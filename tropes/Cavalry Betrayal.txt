Cavalry Betrayal: 
**Maxwell:** Yes, my fellow Christians, we have come to save you...  
**Wounded civilian:** Hooray, it's the Catholic Church!  
**Maxwell:** FROM YOURSELVES!  
**Wounded civilian:** _\[Beat\]_ Oh no, it's the Catholic Church.

The heroes have been cornered by the unstoppable hordes of evil, with nothing left to do but hunker down and make the last of their remaining ammo count, when suddenly they hear approaching hoofbeats. They scarcely dare to look - but yes, that is The Cavalry approaching, with the bad guys falling back in their path. A Red Shirt leaps to his feet, waving and shouting for help — and is promptly run through with a sabre.

Basically any instance in which apparent rescuers turn on the heroes — due to either having a secret agenda or mistaking the protagonists for bad guys.

Subtrope of Hope Spot and Friend or Foe?. Compare with: Cavalry Refusal, Changed My Mind, Kid, Betrayal by Inaction, Big Damn Heroes and Always a Bigger Fish. See Also Salvage Pirates, who appears as "help" to the heroes in dire need, but don't intend to rescue them, in fact, they intend to kill them and take their stuff.

## As this is a Betrayal Trope, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.

Cavalry Betrayal Example in Anime & Manga

-   In **Code Geass: Tales of an Alternate Shogunate**, this happens to the villains; Suzaku and Euphemia's other forces have realized that Perry is trying to make Japan his own property, and as such, instead of helping him, fight alongside Lelouch and the Black Knights against him.
-   **Great Teacher Onizuka**:
    -   In the first episode of the anime. When the three punks who try to blackmail Onizuka are gloating about how much money they're about to get, they accidentally anger a large group of biker thugs who are going to wreck them for their arrogance, when Onizuka shows up and punches his way through the crowd, cowing the bikers who recognise his fearsome reputation. The students are practically crying with relief at being saved by their teacher, only for Onizuka to declare none of the bikers can touch them... because they're his prey.
    -   Zig-Zagged later on in Episode 8. After his students at another school have pranked him (by gluing his fingers to bowling balls) and run off, they also find themselves threatened by a gang. Onizuka shows up and at first seems to refuse to help, even going so far as making them bungee jump off a bridge to prove their manliness. However, he then punches all but one of the gang members off the bridge, and Drives Like Crazy after the last one (in the vice principal's Precious, Precious Car).
-   **Hellsing**: Shortly after Millennium attacks London with a battalion of Nazi vampires, an army of some 3,000+ knights in helicopters and gunships are deployed by Section XIII Iscariot. The arrival of this force catches the Millennium forces initially off-guard and relieves the surviving population of London and they are greeted as saviors — until their leader Enrico Maxwell, who has at this point gone far off the deep end, issues the order to kill **everyone** in London, civilian and vampire alike, resulting in the Iscariot forces indiscriminately mowing down everyone.
-   In the 2015 anime adaptation of **The Heroic Legend of Arslan**, during the disastrous Battle of Atropene, Arslan is in numbed shock after he witnesses firsthand the bloody destruction. He hears Kharlan calling for him and is initially relieved that a familiar person is close, only to realize that the latter and their troops are not here to help him, but to kill him.
-   In the first episode of **K**, our hapless protagonist, Yashiro Isana, is being chased by people who want to kill him-and he has no idea why. He is saved by a total stranger, Kuroh Yatogami who just wants to kill Yashiro himself.
-   A rare example of this happening to the antagonists shows up in **Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny** when Chairman Durandal tries to reinforce his game-ending super-weapon by bringing up the Home-guard. However, the Calvery in this case happened to be lead by veterans of the previous war who'd had enough of Extremists. A few minutes after entering the battle they switch sides, taking a good chunk of the Big Bad's forces with them.
-   **Ninja Scroll**: Despite what he said earlier about the wisdom of remaining neutral, the lord of the Mochizuki clan turns up with his forces to help the protagonists take on the Devils of Kimon. But when Kagerou reports to her lord, he runs her through with his katana, as he's actually the Big Bad.
-   In **One Piece**, during the Arlong arc, after being under Arlong's thumb for eight years and all Marines attempts to save them had been blockaded by the Arlong Pirates, Cocoyashi Village finally had marines reach the island...only for them to be there to confiscate Nami's money, preventing her from buying the village from Arlong.
-   **Read or Die**: It's already been suggested that the British Library has a secret agenda, but the full extent of it isn't clear till they show up in force.
-   In **Saint Beast**, Goh, Shin, Rey and Gai turn against Luca and Judas at the moment they are most needed due to brainwashing, which isn't lifted until it's too late. Then, after Judas and Luca are banished to hell the others plot to free them with the help of the Goddess. The Goddess, however, is plain old sick of fighting and sells them out to Zeus. They get Taken for Granite and have their souls sealed away in darkness. And Judas and Luca are still stuck in hell.

-   **Secret Invasion (2008):** Nick Fury and his Secret Warriors teleport into the middle of New York to save the Initiative and Young Avengers from being executed (a little too late to save Geldoff of the Initative). Then, once Yo-Yo's grabbed all the kids, Nick shoots Ms. Marvel, figuring she's a Skrull, and leaves her to be mobbed by the Super-Skrulls. Note that thanks to her origin, Carol is part-Kree, the last person anyone'd suspect of being a Skrull. But, that's Nick Fury for you.
-   In **Thunderbolts**, right after Baron Zemo revealed they were the Masters of Evil, most of the team revolted.

-   Inverted (and literal) example in **Guardians, Wizards, and Kung-Fu Fighters**.

-   One takes place in the appropriately titled cavalry battle of the U.A. Sports Festival in **My Hero School Adventure Is All Wrong As Expected**. All of Class 1-A agrees to assist each other when possible against the other students and to not attempt to steal each other's points unless doing so is absolutely necessary to advance to the final round while 1-A is in possession of all the points on the field. Todoroki's group betrays the agreement after his mistake allows Monoma to copy his Quirk, despite Hachiman warning the entire class about 1-B's abilities, which puts their chances to make it to the next round at risk. Instead of continuously attempting to retrieve their points from Monoma, Todoroki instead switched targets to Hachiman's party after briefly assisting them because the former knew the latter wouldn't think of them as an enemy until it was too late. It's also heavily implied that Todoroki (and likely Yukinoshita too) didn't want Hachiman in particular to get to the next stage because he's just that dangerous of an opponent.

Cavalry Betrayal Example in Literature

-   In **Animorphs**, this is a common role played by the Andalite military: The final book has the Andalites ready to destroy the human race rather than let it become a resource used by the conquering Yeerk Empire.

    -   A backstory example in **Fire & Blood**; at the final battle of the Dance of Dragons, an army loyal to King Aegon II clashes with a rival force of his late half-sister Rhaenyra's supporters, now battling to put her son on the Iron Throne. Once both armies are locked in battle, Aegon II's commander Borros Baratheon orders his reinforcements to attack...but most of said reinforcements are former Rhaenyra loyalists fighting under duress for Aegon II, and they promptly attacked Lord Baratheon's army from the rear, exterminating Aegon II's last remaining army and leaving his enemies with a clear path to the capital city to depose him.

Sundancer in particular has a power that could decisively and permanently end the threat.

-   One of the Video Examples for this page shows an example from **Firefly** where Malcolm Reynolds is an Independent (Browncoat) trying to call for reinforcements, who pull out at the last moment because the Alliance had just sent in forces so large that they would most likely have annihilated both the ground troops and the cavalry.
-   **Game of Thrones**: During the last days of Robert's Rebellion, Tywin Lannister's forces entered King's Landing as allies, then proceeded to sack the city in Robert's name. Varys and Jaime guessed what was about to happen, but their warnings went unheeded.

-   Happened during the (in)famous WCW Invasion angle, while Chris Jericho & Kane were being beaten down at the hands of the nefarious WCW crew, Lance Storm and Mike Awesome. Then, holy shit, Rob Van Dam and Tommy Dreamer show up and join in! Then a bunch of WWF guys ran in for the save: Tazz, Rhyno, Justin Credible, Raven, The Dudley Boys... wait a minute, what do **all** those guys have in common? Jericho & Kane were promptly pronounced screwed when Paul Heyman left the announce table to proclaim that this invasion had been TAKEN! TO THE! EXTREEEEME! Then later in the same episode, since ECW seemed to have launched a two-front war, there was a match with those ten guys versus five WWF guys and five WCW guys... only to reveal the Alliance of WCW and ECW. Cue fifteen-on-five beatdown.
-   Matt Hardy running down to ringside with a chair during his brother Jeff's match with Edge at the 2009 Royal Rumble. This one still managed to surprise because Matt had legitimate gripes with Edge, and even if you did not know that, Edge had sent Matt packing from Monday Night Raw after stealing his girlfriend (well, Kane stole her first, but we digress).
-   After BxB Hulk became Open The Freedom Gate Champion, Davey Richards, who lost in the first round of the tournament to decide who would be holding the title, ran out to attack him. The surprise here was that it was Richards' opponent, Yamato, seemingly coming out to stop him, only to join Davey's attack.
-   At **ROH SoCal Showdown**, Colt Cabana ran out to stop Scotty 2 Hotty from performing his finishing move, the Worm, on guest referee Johnny Fairplay, only to give Fairplay the Worm himself.
-   At **Shine 16**, Jessicka Havok, Angelina Love, Amber O'Neal, and Serena Deeb ran out to save new Shine Champion Ivelisse Vélez from Made In Sin, who were none too happy with Velez for retiring Valkyrie leader Radiant Rain. After Havok, Love, and O'Neal dealt with April Hunter, Allysin Kay, and Taylor Made, Deeb hit Velez over the head with the title belt before retreating with Made In Sin and replacing Rain as Valkyrie's leader.
-   Joe Bravo and Escobar came out on a February 2015 World Wrestling League show to help Mr. 450 defeat Americas champion Phenomeno BJ. Then they turned on him before Richard Negrín demanded a referee count three on Mr. 450, bringing the Americas Title into the Gentlemen's Club.

Cavalry Betrayal Example in Tabletop Games

-   **Warhammer 40,000:**
    -   During the Horus Heresy, the Imperium sent seven legions to Isstvan V to crush Horus's insurrection. Three legions formed the first wave and met horrific resistance. When the other four landed, they expected relief and reinforcement; unbeknownst to them, their "reinforcements" were in league with Horus and the three loyalist legions were suddenly caught in a pincer attack between **eight** traitor legions. Out of hundreds of thousands of loyalist legionaries, only a few thousand escaped the Drop Site Massacre.
    -   This also often happens when Inquisitorial forces show up to assist. They only tend to be called when the situation has gotten to the point where the only answers are 1) Kill It with Fire and 2) No Witnesses.
    -   The Grey Knights used to have an Apocalypse formation that invoked this trope. They could only deploy if the enemy had at least one greater daemon or warp rift on the table and if, at any point, there were no longer any Chaos models on the table control of the Grey Knights would transfer to the opposing player and the Grey Knights would immediately begin slaughtering their allies to make sure there were no witnesses (why this couldn't wait until after the battle was over is never satisfactorily explained).
    -   Due to the cold hard logic they use when devising their battleplans, the Iron Hands Chapter of Adeptus Astartes are more than willing to fire on their allies if they have calculated that this is the most efficient way of defeating the enemy.

Cavalry Betrayal Example in Video Games

-   An extremely rare **villain** version happens in **Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood**, during Sequence 8, where after destroying all of Cesare Borgia's support, he sees one last chance in his Papal Guard army arriving at Roma's gates, only for them to arrest him on orders of the new Pope.
-   Happens in **Command & Conquer: Tiberium Wars** when Killian's reinforcements turn against Nod's Temple Prime. **Kane's Wrath** reveal that it was actually Alexa who ordered LEGION to pretend to be at the head of Killian's forces.
    
    **Kane**: "Of course I could not have planned for an ambush BY MY OWN FORCES!"
    
-   In **Dead Rising**, if the player follows the path to the best ending, the heroes will call for help. What they get, instead, is a spec ops squad come to ensure the truth behind the zombie outbreak remains a secret, and everyone is fair game, living or undead.
-   The American soldiers and pilots in **Desert Strike**, who are stranded behind the enemy lines and waiting for the player to rescue them, aren't exactly immune to friendly bullets.

-   Towards the end of **Dragon Age: Origins: Awakening** you have the option of doing this to the City of Amaranthine. The city has been overwhelmed by darkspawn while Vigil's Keep has been ambushed by an even larger darkspawn army. You have the option to burn the city down with Arrows on Fire, killing all the people and darkspawn that your soldiers have trapped inside, freeing you to save your fortress. Fortunately, you can Take a Third Option and save everyone if you have built up the fort enough that it can stand without you.
    -   The original game, **Dragon Age: Origins**, has a "It Was His Sled" moment: when Alistair and the Warden light the beacon at the top of the nearby tower, signalling Loghain's forces to charge, Loghain orders a retreat instead. Cailian and the rest of the Grey Wardens, including Duncan, are overwhelmed. Whether the act constituted a betrayal or not is still debated in- and out-of-universe.
-   This happened in the Backstory of one of the towns in **Dragon Quest VII**. When the monsters first appeared and started terrorizing the town and kidnapping people, one man convinced his neighbors to stand against them. He went ahead to start the fight... and everyone else chickened out. To twist the knife further, this betrayal caused his sister Matilda to hate everyone, allowing the monsters to turn her into a Tragic Monster Barrier Maiden.
-   In **The Elder Scrolls** series' backstory, King Joile of Daggerfall convinced Gaiden Shinji, the legendary Redguard hero and leader of the Order of Diagna, to join him in the Siege of Orsinium (the home city-state/fortress of the Orcs). Joile then convinced Shinji, the Blademaster and founder of the Imperial City Arena, to participate in a Combat by Champion Duel to the Death against the Orc leader, Baloth Bloodtusk. As Shinji and Baloth were fighting, Joile ordered his archers to open fire on both of them. As it turned out, Joile not only wanted to sack Orsinium, but planned to invade Hammerfell after and knew that Shinji would have been a major obstacle. (Joile would get his comeuppance, dying during what would be a failed invasion of Hammerfell.)
-   The player character pulls this off in the endgame of **Fallout: New Vegas** if they're fighting for Mr. House or an Independent Vegas. While you and the Securitrons are fighting alongside the NCR for the majority of the battle, you're also secretly trying to activate the Sealed Army in a Can in order to put yourself in a position to force them out of the Mojave. Once the Legion is routed, you then have to deal with General Oliver, either through force or through diplomacy.
-   Subverted in **Final Fantasy XIV**. when Rhitahtyn sas Arvina is killed by the Warrior of Light, Gaius van Baelsar believes his troops refused to help him (which makes sense as Rhitahtyn is Roegadyn and the Garleans have a massive case of Fantastic Racism) and the soldier tells him he isn't sure at all. However, in actuality, Rhitahtyn had sent his troops away as he didn't want them to die against the Warrior, but some of them came back to aid him.
-   **Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War**, although the lead-up makes it a bit easier to see it coming. Chapter 5 looks like it's going to be the final battle against all of the antagonists, but rather unexpectedly Velthomer switches sides and starts attacking Freege's army as soon as you get close to Velthomer, double-crossing its allies. All this in spite of the fact that Arvis has now been revealed to be in league with the Loptyr Sect. The chapter ends with Sigurd being led to Belhalla, ostensibly to be cleared of all charges, only to learn that he is still labeled as a traitor and will be killed, along with much of the party (though their fates are mostly left ambiguous).
    -   Its interquel **Thracia 776** features a sort-of Meta example: late into a grueling defence chapter, an army of green (NPC) Thracian Dracoknights arrive and start heading for the city. The player will probably be exclaiming "I'm saved!" at this point, as the Non Player Characters fly in and clear out the enemies. Until they actually reach the city, upon which they start attacking **you**. Turns out, they're on **neither** side: they just want the city back under their control, meaning you're just as much of an obstacle to them as the enemy army. Notable in that it's possibly the only time in the entire series where green NPC units can actually attack you.
    -   In the original game and its remake, Marth's father, King Cornelius of Altea, was killed during the invasion led by Medeus, when the army of Gra, who was supposedly allied with Altea, betrayed them and attacked them from the rear.
    -   **Fire Emblem: Awakening**: In Chapter 17 some of your allied forces infiltrate the enemy fort partway through the battle, but Excellus quickly appears and sways them to his side, via holding their families hostage.
    -   In **Fire Emblem: Three Houses** provides an example happening to the **enemy**. On the Crimson Flower route, during the battle for the Great Bridge of Myrrdin, the enemy commander Judith of House Daphnel receives Leicester Alliance reinforcements led by the noble Acheron, who has been noted for being a Dirty Coward and conveniently spawns near the exit to the map away from the majority of the reinforcements. Should Byleth and the Black Eagle Strike Force strike down the majority of said reinforcements (including their general), he will abandon Judith and leave with his personal guard to save his own hide, which prompts her to order the remaining Alliance soldiers to retreat (and unfortunately for her, it's mission-critical to kill her before she escapes).
-   A villainous example happens in the third **Galaxy Angel** game. Tact defeats Rowil of the Valfask, but takes notice that a fleet of enemy reinforcements suddenly turned around and left him to die, which leaves the heroes unsettled about it. After Wein reveals his true colors, he takes command of those remaining forces.
-   In **Half-Life**, the HECUs sent in to quell the alien invasion of Black Mesa are also there to contain all information of the outbreak by killing every Black Mesa employee they meet, and that includes the Player Character, Gordon Freeman. Some aren't happy about the job, others are. Whatever it is, it gets justified quick when they come to think that Gordon is a psychopath (due to how Gordon by that point has been singlehandedly slaughtering scores of their buddies) and responsible for the whole mess in the compound. They get some karmic justice in the add-on **Opposing Force**, where the Black Ops soldiers deliver them their own Cavalry Betrayal.
-   Inverted in **Homeworld**: during the final battle a large squadron of Taiidan frigates with two destroyers exits from hyperspace, but they then identify themselves as the Taiidan **Rebellion** coming to support you.
    -   Also played straight in **Cataclysm**: at one point the Kiith Manaan carrier **Caal-Shto** shows up with reinforcements, but when the Raiders you're fighting attack them the **Caal-Shto** is promptly revealed to have been infected by the Beast, and is now an enemy ship.
-   The Komato in **Iji** combine this with Always a Bigger Fish. They're there to kill the Tasen, but you're... well, there.
-   After the finale of **Left 4 Dead**, the characters are rescued by the military in an APC. The subsequent comics show that the army locked them up out of fear that they were carriers and intended to kill them before a horde rush allows them to escape.
-   There's a Japanese DOS-era tactical RPG called **Legend of the Seven Heroes 2** that ends like this. After a Climax Boss battle against the enemy nation's Big Bad General and his army, an army from the friendly nation shows up, and the main character assumes they're there to rescue them. However, the friendly nation's General arranges a truce with the Big Bad General and decides to kill the main characters, because he figures that the main characters' survival would bring peace between the two nations and thus be politically disadvantageous to both of them. The final battle of the game thus has your 7 characters being attacked from the North of the battlefield by the Big Bad General and his army and from the South of the battlefield by the not-so-friendly nation's General and **his** army.

-   The Player Character themselves can do this in **Pathfinder: Kingmaker** during the Kellid invasion. Your patron, Lady Jamandi Aldori of Restov, goes to fight them and calls for your army to join her, but you can choose to go chasing after Tristian instead (which is required if you want to complete his Romance Sidequest). Should you do so, you'll finally arrive to discover the opening rounds have already happened and ended in a Pyrrhic Victory for Restov: the Kellids have been stopped for the moment, but Jamandi's army is shattered and her adoptive son Kassil died fighting in her bodyguard, and you're in for a **vicious** What the Hell, Hero? from Jamandi herself.
-   **Persona 5** opens up with an inversion. The protagonist acts as the cavalry and rescues a woman from a drunk harasser, only for him to pull out some dirt he has on her and convince her to testify that you randomly beat him up. Not only that, later in the game you net yourself a party member in the form of Akechi, who pretends he's helping you because he worries for Sae. Beat Sae's Palace or not, and he's all too willing to put a bullet through your skull.
-   **Pokémon Sun and Moon**: Wild Pokemon will sometimes call for help if they are losing a battle. Usually this help arrives in the form of another member of their own species, more rarely a Pokemon of another species will show up. And sometimes, their **predator** will show up, and attack the Pokemon that called for help.
-   **Sonny** begins and ends with these. At the start, the ZPCI come in helicopters, apparently to wipe the zombies currently attacking you, only to turn on you instead as they don't want witnesses. Finally, the last battle of the game is against Galiant the Paladin, whose help you just impersonated and who you just helped in taking down Baron Brixus. Veradux reasons he won't accept the truth and turn on them, so he decides to turn on him first and take you along.
-   The Alliance attack on Vaadwaur Prime in **Star Trek Online** involves your ship attacking defences closer and closer to the planet, calling in one wave of allied forces from different factions each stage. One wave joins the enemy instead. It is the Kazon — Maje Sessen had secretly suborned most of them. This doesn't really work out for them, as the betrayal was predicted and a contingency worked out (some Hirogen are happy to hunt Kazon and Vaadwaur for a while) — and if called in early enough, it even leads to a **genuine** Cavalry moment (a small group of Kazon show up a stage later to fight beside you, as they found the betrayal dishonorable.).
-   Charlie Nash's ending in **Street Fighter Alpha 2** has him corner M. Bison, only to be shot and killed by his own men.

-   In **World of Warcraft**, the battle of Angrathar contains a genuine example of The Cavalry when Horde wolf-riders charge into battle to help the beleaguered Alliance. But when the Lich King himself emerges, Putress bombards the entire battleground with Blight, Horde, Alliance, and Scourge alike.
-   The famous Wham Level of **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2**, "Loose Ends", ends with the team holding a cabin against an endless stream of attackers while a huge amount of data is copied on a portable hard drive and most of them are dead when all of the data is secured. The last men make a frantic dash down a hillside without any real cover while under fire from lots of automatic rifles, machine guns, and rocket launchers and just 14 meters from the extraction point the player gets downed. When you regain consciousness a few seconds later, your last teammate Ghost drags you by your jacket and finally helicopters of Shadow Company appear from behind you and mow everything down with their miniguns. And when you finally stumble the last steps to the evac chopper, General Shepherd takes the hard drive and shoots both you and Ghost in the chest. The last thing you see is your bodies being thrown in a ditch, a soldier emptying a gas canister over you, and Shepherd throwing his burning cigar at your face, all the while Price is yelling on comm about how the rest of his team is under attack by Shepherd's men and imploring them not to trust Shepherd.
-   In **Ys SEVEN**, after getting the last crest from the Sea Dragon on Ruin Island you go back to your ship only to be attacked by a giant Titano, Just in the nick of time the Dragon Knights show up and Save you. That is only half true however, They are actually here to rescue Aisha and Arrest you for "kidnapping" her and assassinating the King who was murdered mere moments after Adol leaves said King's bedroom.
-   The U.S.M. **Valor** in **Dead Space**. Initially believed to be on a rescue mission, it is later heavily implied that they were full aware of how dire the situation was on the U.S.G. **Ishimura** and that they would have rather nuked the whole ship than even bother with trying to save anyone.

Cavalry Betrayal Example in Web Original

-   Inverted in **Counter Monkey**. During the **Thieves' World** campaign, the players attacked a cult and the DM expected that they would need help by their employer, Tempus Thales, who came with six guardsman to serve as backup. However, The Cavalry Arrives Late and the party wins the day without assistance. When they heard approaching troops, they assumed it was more cultists and ambushed Tempus as he entered the room, inflicting Facial Horror and driving the campaign Off the Rails in the process.
-   In **The Gamer's Alliance**, a regiment of Proninists disguised as Scun Loyalists manage to fool the Maar Sulais army into letting them get closer during the Second Battle of Victoire. They reveal their true colours by attacking the surprised Maar Sulais defenders who then are forced to flee as they're being outnumbered.
-   Parodied in the Anniversary Brawl between the cast of Channel Awesome and The Angry Video Game Nerd when Benzaie shows up, and everyone else who sides with the Nerd over the Critic.
    
    **The Nostalgia Critic**: Benzaie! Clench your fist and strike a blow for our side!  
    **Benzaie**: \*Punches out an already dazed Linkara\*  
    **The Nostalgia Critic**: ...he's on our side.  
    **Benzaie**: \*Punches out Nostalgia Critic\*
    
-   Much like the source material, the Catholic forces in **Hellsing Ultimate Abridged** are being mowed down en masse by Dracula's forces. Unlike the source, however, the Papal Knights are nowhere in sight, the forces under Bishop Enrico Maxwell being comprised of fringe factions, the KKK, and the Sacred Order of the Temple Beth Zion. The last of these take the hardware Maxwell gave them and leave, leaving the extremists, the Klansmen and Maxwell to their fates.
-   In **Worm**, Echidna has stalemated Eidolon and her clones are whittling down the combined forces of the Protectorate and the Undersiders. Then the Travelers, the Undersider's allies, show up to help, but Trickster, the leader of the Travelers, betrays **everybody** to support Echidna, his Protectorate and ex-girlfriend.

Cavalry Betrayal Example in Western Animation

-   In the three part second season finale of **Beast Wars**, Cybertron dispatched agent Ravage to prehisotric Earth to aid the Maximals in capturing Megatron. However, Megatron was the only one who knew that, rather than take them back to Cybertron, Ravage was going to terminate all the Maximals and rogue Predacons. Even worse, Megatron used a secret message from his predecessor to convince Ravage to side with him and attack the Maximals.
-   Used in a Cliffhanger in **He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (2002)**: Adam, deprived of his sword and stuck facing down a group of villains led by Skeletor, thinks he sees the Masters on the horizon. They turn out to be Skeletor's minions using the Masters' vehicles.
-   In **ReBoot**, this was part of Megabyte's grand strategy during the Web World War: he waited for Mainframe's CPU fleet to take heavy casualties before deploying his own forces, and the moment the invasion ended, he immediately directed his troops to destroy the city's remaining defenses. It was this betrayal that ultimately allowed Megabyte to conquer Mainframe.
-   In **ThunderCats (2011)** during The Siege of Thundera, trusted General Grune shows up toting a Flare Gun that seems to bring the enemy Lizards' Walking Tank fleet to a halt, only for him to perform an Insignia Rip-Off Ritual and an Evil Costume Switch while debuting his nasty new Lightning Gun, while trusted General Panthro...**isn't** and King Claudus is stabbed In the Back.
-   The protagonists of **Titan Maximum** weren't actually happy to see Troy Hammerschmitt and his Titan Megamum, but that's only mostly because he's The Ace while they are a Ragtag Bunch of Misfits with bad publicity. Everyone else is happy to see him. And then Troy hands his super-advanced robot to the Big Bad, because he was angry that his father considered him an Inadequate Inheritor.
-   **Total Drama**: After getting picked as Bowie's helper in the final challenge, Julia wastes no time wasting time and is an absolute hindrance to him as revenge for eliminating her last episode. She even blackmails him into signing a legally-binding contract that stipulates he'll fork over half of the million to her if he wins in exchange for her cooperation, only to abandon him once he terminates the contract and also takes the saw away for good measure.

Cavalry Betrayal Example in Real Life

-   Popular theory holds that the Soviet Red Army pulled such an act during the Warsaw Uprising, when Polish resistance fighters sought to rid the capital of the Nazi General Government and military. Research from Polish historians shows this as a complicated and narrow aversion: the Red Army certainly **did not** actively fight the Polish resistance in the Uprising (as they had, for example, during the onset of the war when they invaded Poland alongside Germany)—they didn't fight anyone at all, and in all likelihood, were badly spent from edging out bloody victories against the largest German army groups of the war during the liberation of Belarus. The Red Army instead decided to stand aside during the battle (despite some propaganda broadcasts from Moscow suggesting Soviet support was imminent). Soviet tank units were denied fuel for advancing even if they wanted to, and only after repeated pressure from the Western allies did the Red Army offer basic assistance to the Polish Home Army \[1\]. Soviet leadership, Stalin included, chose to focus on other fronts and take Warsaw afterwards—possibly reflecting the very high level of distrust between the parties involved.
-   Both Russia and Germany made extensive use of captured tanks. In North Africa, a tactic Rommel returned to was to spearhead his armour with captured British tanks. Even though captured vehicles had been clearly repainted in German insignia (to conform with international law and to safeguard the crews if captured), tired British troops in forward positions recognised the familiar silhouette and sound of what they took to be their own tanks - and relaxed their guard for just long enough. This trick was also used in Russia, although as the tide turned it came back to bite the Germans. The USSR captured so many German tanks that it created special armoured regiments with them - whose job was to spearhead attacks and deceive the Germans into thinking it was their own tanks approaching them. In other fronts, the USSR deliberately painted its tanks in the same disruptive three-colour camouflage used by Germany. Quite often, even this deceived German watchers for long enough, or had them holding fire while trying to ascertain if these were captured Russian tanks being used by German units.
-   A naval variant involved the British submarine HMS Morse, which would patrol the approach routes to German submarine bases in France, quite openly on the surface. Tired U-boat crews returning from the Atlantic would see only one of their own - as the Morse was originally a U-boat, captured intact off Iceland. The deception worked, right up until the Morse ran up the White Ensign and fired its torpedos at an unprepared target.
-   In an inversion of the above, Hitler also played this role in the areas of Europe the Soviets occupied prior to 1941. Indeed, many guerrilla organizations (such as the Forest Brothers from the Baltic States and the UPA aka Ukranian Insurgent Army) saw him as a potential savior against Soviet Russia, only to find themselves surrounded by German soldiers and Panzers gunning for them (though Hitler did allow some anti-Soviet fighters to join his puppet organizations).
-   The Battle of Bosworth Field. The Stanleys, nominally allied with King Richard III, waited until he was separated from his army and charged the King's Bodyguard from the rear, surrounding Richard and killing him in the last time that a British monarch would die in battle.
-   The Battle of Sekigahara, the unofficial start of the Tokugawa shogunate that would end the Sengoku Period, was practically Cavalry Betrayal: the battle had **five** factions' betrayals in it, helped by Tokugawa Ieyasu having courted some of the enemy lords for quite a while beforehand and most of the betrayals were probably spurred simply because Tokugawa's side seemed to have been gaining the advantage. It even saw a few Cavalry Refusals.
-   This was how the Bosnian uprising under Husein-beg Gradaščevićes leadership against the Ottoman Empire was squashed in 1850. After routing the imperial army for more than a decade, the final battle that would decide the fate of Bosnia until this day was being fought in what is today the Stup neighborhood in Sarajevo. After defeating the Ottomans, the exhausted Bosnian rebels were overrun by what were supposed to be their reinforcements from Herzegovina-who thought the country would be better off in the crumbling Ottoman Empire.
-   Philip VI, King of France, ordered this to be done to his Genovese allies at the Battle of Crecy. The Genovese crossbowmen, ordered by their French paymasters to fight without their pavises (huge shields that protected them from the murderous English longbows as they reloaded), were massacred by the English. When they began to retreat, the French knights charged right over them, either because their commanders were angered by the "cowardice" of the Genovese or were simply too impatient to wait for the exhausted Genovese to withdraw. The French knights paid for their king's arrogance and commanders' bad tactics, however, as they were also crushed by the English forces, faring little better than the crossbowmen had.
-   Italy in World War I. Before the war they had an alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary against France, Britain and Russia, but, between the terms of the agreement being only to fight on defensive ground when the Central Powers declared war first, the long-standing Italian claim to some Austro-Hungarian territories, the German emperor having done everything in his power to deserve the Italian king's hate and actually having better relations with France and Britain than with their own allies, first refused to enter the war, and when they did it was on the other side.
-   The Battle of Ankara between the Ottomans and Timurids was a crushing defeat for the former, since a substantial force of Black Tatars on their side deserted them when they saw the odds where on their side and joined the stronger side. This battle resulted in the first and only time an Ottoman sultan was taken captive and it was followed by a succession crisis when his sons fought each other in a civil war for the throne.
-   The Ottomans were subjected to this again in the Siege of Vienna when their Wallachian vassals not only retreated when the Polish hussars charged, but it was revealed that their prince Șerban Cantacuzino was secretly in league with the Christians, having warned them about the Turks' plans, movements and tactics in exchange for the throne of Constantinople. Though the Habsburgs promised to give him Constantinople for his assistance, he died suddenly before he could claim his reward - presumably poisoned by his fellow Wallachians due to his highly unrealistic expectations.
