Achievement Mockery: 
Video game achievements are awarded for all sorts of things. Sometimes they are awarded for accomplishing something legitimately difficult. Sometimes they are awarded for doing something that required no effort at all. And then there are these.

Achievement Mockery is when you are awarded for either doing something really, really stupid, or for playing the game poorly; whether it be dying a certain amount of times, finding a specific Non-Standard Game Over, completely screwing yourself out of making further progress in the game, or just doing something the developers decided to have the game mock you for. As a kind of jab at the player, these achievements are ones that, more often than not, players either don't want to get, or only go for because of trying to achieve 100% Completion.

May be a result of Easy-Mode Mockery or a character who Wins by Doing Absolutely Nothing. Compare Yet Another Stupid Death, as well as Earn Your Bad Ending, where you have to be actively trying to end the game on a bad note. Also compare Completion Mockery, which has the game make fun of you for wasting your time completing it. Sub-Trope of Take That, Audience!.

See Medal of Dishonor for dishonorable rewards being awarded In-Universe.

## Examples:

### **Video game examples:**

Achievement Mockery Example in Action Games

-   The **Assassin's Creed** series has a few achievements for doing random or counterintuitive things.
    -   **Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood** has "Your Wish Is Granted" for throwing money in a well, which does nothing except waste money.
    -   **Assassin's Creed: Revelations** gives "Monster's dance" for having a guard incapacitate three civilians while he's poisoned.
-   The Flash game **Amorphous+**. You get awards for dying a number of times, as well as dying in multiple ways. And it's needed for 100% Completion, as it's the only way to get more reward keys.
-   In **Asura's Wrath**, the "View of the Valley" achievement is awarded for staring too long at a girl's bust during the Hot Springs Episode.
-   **Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening**:
    -   The game has a mild example of this on the completion screen for Easy difficulty.
        
        Prequel doesn't mean you can be a newbie.
        
    -   While the game compliments players for SS ranking all missions on Normal and Hard, Very Hard (Special Edition) and Dante Must Die instead reward them with biting remarks:
        
        **Very Hard:** All this, and you didn't break the controller!
        
        **Dante Must Die:** Man, you need to get out more.
        
-   The HD version of **God of War** has two of these. The first is the aptly-named "Zero Health = Bronze Trophy", awarded for opening a Health Chest when your health meter is already full. The second is "Getting My Ass Kicked", awarded for dying enough times to get offered Easy mode.
-   **L.A. Noire** has "Public Menace" for racking up $47000 in penalties during a single story case.
-   In **Lollipop Chainsaw**:
    -   The "I Swear! I Did It By Mistake!" achievement is awarded for looking up Juliet's skirt.
    -   The "Gunn Struck" trophy is awarded for being struck by lightning (or shocked by Vikke's electrical attacks) ten times.
-   In **Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands**, you can permanently lower your current difficulty any time in the game. Doing this earns you the achievement "Our Little Secret".
-   The PS4 ports of **Star Wars: Jedi Outcast** and **Jedi Academy** includes all sorts of wacky trophies for dying in various absurd manners (falling in lava, missing a platform, being eaten by a rancor, etc.), as well as a few that outright **reward** Video Game Cruelty Potential, requiring you to do very non-Jedilike things such as killing helpless NPCs or torturing enemies with your Force powers. You also get a trophy calling you out for beating a level with cheats if you do so, complete with disabling any trophies you would have gotten from completing the level legitimately.
-   **Yakuza 0** has a trophy for having Kiryu or Majima watch an erotic video, appropriately titled "...I Did It for the Trophy". The game also has an achievement for being smashed on the head with a bottle during a quick-time event in a fight scene.

Achievement Mockery Example in Action-Adventure Games

-   **Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon**: The multiplayer mode gives achievements to everyone at the end of each level, based on what they did the most of or did particularly well. Anyone who doesn't get any other type of award gets one of a few mocking achievements, such as 'Prettiest Wallflower' and 'Mostly Harmless'.
-   **Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered** awards "Warning Label" if Lucas dies by taking pills and booze together.

---
Achievement Mockery Example in Adventure Games

-   In **Don't Shit Your Pants**, you receive an achievement if you type in "shit" and have your character soil themselves before the game even begins.
-   A similar achievement returns in **Don't Wet Your Pants** (typing in "pee" before the game begins) as well as "Doing It Wrong" if you enter the command to defecate instead of urinate.
-   Due to its nature, **Heavy Rain** has a few of these.
    -   "Agoraphobia" for knocking down 50 (innocent) people during Ethan's claustrophobia-induced trance.
    -   "Blunder" for shooting Nathaniel, which the game all but tricks you into doing even though he's harmless.
    -   "Coward!" for giving up or failing the Butterfly Trial.
    -   "Bad Cop" for doing nothing to stop Blake from beating up Dupré.
    -   "Hands Up!" for getting arrested by Blake.
    -   "So Close..." for failing after making it to the end with all four characters still alive.
    -   "Perfect Crime" for basically letting the villain get away free without leaving any evidence or witnesses, though it's a hell of a time to actually get this one.
-   **Ittle Dew** has an achievement for being hit by a projectile you just teleported.
-   **Kings Quest (2015)** has achievements which are unlocked by doing things such as **being eaten by a dragon**.
-   **The Oregon Trail (2021)** awards "You have died of dysentery" when a party member dies of dysentery, "Smithereens" when your wagon suffers a Nitro Express accident, and "Sky High" when a party member is killed by a nitro explosion.
-   **Poptropica**: Mocktropica Island, which is themed around video game design and parodying common trends, introduces an achievement system that the game normally doesn't have. They start off as minor annoyances, but turn sarcastic and insulting, with descriptions such as "break the curd machine and force the designer to return to his miserable old job" and "find a man in a perfect zen setting, destroy that, throw him back into the rat race." The very last part of the island is where you repeatedly shoot coins at an achievement popup, causing it to shatter... and then you get an achievement for that, too.
-   **Stray** has two examples:
    -   "Curiosity Killed the Cat" for interacting with a paper bag, which then gets stuck on the cat's head and blinds them (as represented with Interface Screw) until it falls off.
    -   "No More Lives" for dying at least nine times, either to Zurk mobs or Sentinel bullets.

Achievement Mockery Example in Beat 'em Ups

-   In the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Steam **Sega Genesis Classics** Compilation Rerelease, if, while playing **Golden Axe**, you use your potions when no enemies are on screen, you get an achievement called 'What Are The Buttons?'.
-   **River City Girls** has the "Killed By Math" achievement, given out for being defeated in the first room of the game.

---
Achievement Mockery Example in Card Battle Game

-   **Touhou Lost Branch Of Legend**: The player gets the Misplayed award worth 100 points:
    
    Deal lethal damage to oneself.
    

---
Achievement Mockery Example in Fighting Games

-   **Dead or Alive 4** has the "20 Straight Losses in DOA Online" trophy. As you can guess, it requires you to lose 20 times in a row in online matches. To add insult to injury, it doesn't even award any Gs.
-   **Shrek SuperSlam**: The Pause Master trophy is unlocked by pausing the game 100 times: an achievement you can get as soon as you start a match. The trophy's description even points out how desperate you'd have to be to try for it:
    
    For a hero who is desperate for a trophy. Any trophy.
    
-   The PSN/XBLA versions of **Sonic the Fighters** give you a trophy/achievement just for being Squashed Flat (well, squashed down to a short size, anyway).
-   Earlier installments of **Super Smash Bros.** deduct points from your score for things such as dropping items while trying to use them, blowing yourself up with bombs or capsules, allowing your shield to break, deliberately breaking your own shield, taking cheap shots, and making no attempt to recover after being knocked off the stage. And you **have** to get all of them if you want the Diskun trophy (which requires you to earn every bonus and penalty in the game).

---
Achievement Mockery Example in First-Person Shooters

-   **AMID EVIL** has the "A Real Klutz" achievement. To obtain this one, you need to get every possible special death message, one of which can only be obtained through one of the final boss's attacks or the Super Mode of one of your own weapons. There's also "Abysmal," which is for dying in the Gateway.
-   The **Battlefield** series has the Purple Heart, achieved from a certain kill/death ratio depending on game (1:5 for **1942**, 1:4 for **2**, and 1:2 for **2142**).
    -   Later entries in the series also 'reward' the player with a Comeback Bonus, which gives you a pathetically small number of bonus points (which in and of themselves mean almost nothing) for getting a kill after several deaths in a row without killing anyone.
-   **Black Mesa** has achievements for getting killed by your own snarks, getting killed by a headcrab, cooking a grenade until it explodes in your hand, overcharging the Tau Cannon (which inflicts massive damage on the user), getting zapped by the Anti-Mass Spectrometer, getting flung into oblivion by the Gonarch, and even drowning in the Lambda Reactor Coolant System.
-   **Deep Rock Galactic** has the "Darwin Award" achievement for killing yourself with the barrel fire hoop while drunk.
-   **Doom Eternal** has an achievement called "Ow", with an image of the Doom Slayer giving a thumbs up with a bandaged hand, that pops if you try and punch a (thick metal) slayer gate. Another called, "Phew, that was a close one" is granted for blowing a room-clearing BFG shot on a single zombie and nothing else.
-   In **Duke Nukem 3D**, tip a virtual stripper who takes her top off and you'll get the 10G trophy "Shake It, Baby".
-   The **Half-Life 2** mod **Entropy : Zero** has the "Bullet Hangover" achievement for dying 100 times.
-   **First Encounter Assault Recon** awards "Suicide King" for the Pointman killing himself five times, most likely to occur via grenade mishaps.
-   **Frontlines: Fuel of War** has a zero-point achievement named "Noob" for suiciding 10 times in a multiplayer game.
-   **GoldenEye: Source** has a few, including "004," which is awarded for blowing yourself up 25 times with your own mines, "Octopussy" for excessive camping, and "Who Throws a Shoe?", which is awarded to someone who plays as Oddjob (who is widely considered unfair to use due to being smaller and therefore harder to hit, as well as having a borderline-broken Razor Hat) for essentially being the worst player in the round. Then there's the Awards, which are given every match, that point out similar things, and they're similarly both doled out for genuine skill — or a lack thereof.
-   **High Hell** has a secret achievement for getting killed in under 5 seconds.
-   A **Modern Warfare** player who fails to kill anyone in a multiplayer round, and dies at least ten times, gets an achievement.
-   In **Neon White** in order to get the "Idiot Achivement", you need to do one of Neon Violet's sidequest stages, titled "Hellevator". The stage has you Stomping through a series of breakable floors down a shaft towards the goal, however if you don't pay attention to the floor numbers and go too far past the floor limit, you'll end up on a small speck of land with nothing but a sign that reads "Idiot Island" with no way off except dying or resetting.
-   **PAYDAY 2** has over 1,000 achievements to its name, so it should be no surprise it has one in the form of "F in Chemistry", which can be earned by blowing up the meth lab on Rats or Cook Off by putting in the wrong meth ingredients.
-   **Postal 2** has the "It's sterile and I like the taste" achievement, which requires you to make your character piss onto their own face.
-   In **Prey (2017)**, there are two such achievements. First, "No Show", which requires the player to kill themselves on the helicopter blades of the transport to take them to work on their first day (the prologue, before doing anything of importance at all). Second, there is "Intrinsic Value", which requires the player to recycle themselves (that is, to kill themselves using a Recycler Charge).
-   **Serious Sam** has a variety of achievements falling under this category, with each game (sometimes) having at least one, such as:
    -   "Impossible," a vaguely-named achievement in the Serious Sam Classics: Revolution version, with the just-as-vague description "This achievement is impossible to get." The achievement requires you survive five real-life minutes with only one point of health remaining, making it impossible to unlock on the Tourist difficulty that has health regeneration enabled.
    -   The Siberian Mayhem side-mission "Alpha and Omega" has the objective of disabling a force field generator, with the player being allowed to complete a puzzle to do so. The achievement "All Ingenious is Shot" can be unlocked by ignoring the puzzle in favor of blowing up the generator, whereas the achievement "All Ingenious is Hard" with the description "You are here to shoot, right?" requires finding a much more difficult solution to the puzzle.
    -   Serious Sam 4's achievement "Brass Lantern" is completed by doing a side-mission that involves you playing a text-based adventure game to unlock a few pickups, blatantly ignoring the primary objective of escaping the oil rig you're on to head back to an important battle.
-   In the Xbox 360 version of **Secret Service**, shooting the president earns you the zero-point achievement "The Exact Opposite of Your Job". There's also the "Drop The Pin..." achievement, which you get for killing yourself with your own grenade, and the "Expert Marksman" achievement, which you get by firing an entire magazine without hitting anything.
-   **Star Wars: Battlefront** awarded the various units after battles based on their performance with titles. For instance, "Tank Buster" went to whoever destroyed the most vehicles, and "Dead Eye" for whoever scored the most headshots. But then there's "Camper" (most time spent in any one spot, not including turns), "Traitor" (most team-kills), and "Bantha Fodder" (most deaths).
-   **Star Trek: Elite Force** games give the Red Shirt award in a multiplayer game to those who manage to die first.
-   **Team Fortress 2**'s Sniper vs. Spy update introduced the Sniper's "Consolation Prize" achievement for being Back Stabbed 50 times. This can be especially ironic if the achievement causes you to reach Sniper Milestone 3, that would reward you with the Razorback, a shield that keeps you from being backstabbed.
-   In **Tribes: Ascend**, one of the accolades that earns you points is "llama grab", gotten when you pick up a flag at a very low speed — which is likely to result in you dying before you get much of anywhere with it, screwing up a faster-moving teammate's grab attempt, and dropping the flag somewhere that's harder for you to pick up until the flag automatically goes back to the stand. While it still gives you points, it's less than even a standard flag grab and the description even says "not for use in any highlight reels".

Achievement Mockery Example in Hidden Object Games

-   **Awakening 7: The Golden Age** has the "Murderer" achievement for trying to use a razor on some sleeping gnolls.
-   **Puppet Show 6: Lightning Strikes** has the "Reckless Detective" and "Pushy" achievements for using investigation cards wrongly and using an incorrect item five times in a row on the same hot spot, respectively.
-   **Puppet Show 8: The Face of Humanity** has the "Are You Really a Detective?" achievement for trying to use a knife on the gendarme who demands authorization at the start of the game.

---
Achievement Mockery Example in Idle Games

-   **Cookie Clicker** has one, in particular, that was introduced when the ability to rename the bakery was added - attempting to name the bakery "Orteil"('s bakery) (after the game's creator) awards the Shadow Achievement (which does not add to the milk percentage, unlike regular achievements) "God Complex," which calls out the player for not being the game's creator. As of version 2.0 and later, it's even worse - the achievement puts a -1% modifier on all cookie production while the bakery is named after Orteil. And anyone who spells it "Ortiel" instead gets a -2% modifier.
-   **Kittens Game**: Any achievement with a red-coloured border is essentially a Mark of Shame and often obtained by doing something bad:
    -   The "Winter is Coming" and "You Monster" Achievements are awarded to players who had 10 and 100 kittens starve to death respectively in one run, presumably as a form of Video Game Cruelty Punishment.
    -   The achievement "Super Unethical Climax" is "awarded" to players who click the catnip-gathering button 2,500 consecutive times without 2.5 seconds ever passing between clicks — a feat only likely to happen if one is using an autoclicker.
    -   The "System Shock" achievement is awarded for trying (and failing) to sell an AI core during the AI apocalypse — it's not going to let you fix your mistake **that** easily!

Achievement Mockery Example in MMORPGs

-   **City of Heroes**:
    -   The game awards badges for some rather dubious "achievements", including sustaining high amounts of damage, paying off debt (which is accrued each time you are "killed"), and time spent held in status effects. At least most of the badges for such effects have cool names; taking a lot of damage gets you the Tough, Indestructible, and Unstoppable badges, which are at least okay. The final "Death" badge is **Exalted**. The cool titles alone (which could be worn and showed up under the player character's name) were reason enough for many players to work towards them. Also, for melee characters like Tanks and Brutes, the "damage taken" badges were, of course, treated as badges of honor.
    -   There's another badge, Virtual Victim, for dying in an Architect mission in test mode.
    -   The badge descriptions can turn to mockery even if the badge doesn't exactly deserve it; for instance, the Lambda Looter badge, for gathering all the temp powers in the Lambda Sector trial but using none of them, reminds the player that the temp powers can be used to make the fight against Marauder easier.
-   **Dragon Awaken** includes the "Never Surrender" goal, which requires you to be killed 20 times by another player in one event called Battlegrounds. Completing the goal can help strengthen your character significantly, so many people do end up accomplishing this task eventually, whether by having another player agree to kill them or by spamming attacks at another player until they've been killed enough. Typically, if a player removes equipment, gear, and allied heroes, it makes it easier to achieve this goal. There is also another goal, called 'Stranger,' that requires you to get 'wrong' answers to 20 questions in the Soulmate mini-game with a partner. In this case, the answer counts as 'wrong' if you don't select the same answer as your partner.
-   **The Elder Scrolls Online** contains an achievement for swimming out too far and being killed by the resulting slaughterfish.
-   **Guild Wars 2**: One world boss in the core game, the Shatterer, always arrives for his meta-event by landing on a specific spot on the map. The achievement for getting killed when the Shatterer lands on your head gives as many achievement points as killing the Shatterer 10 times, and Death is Cheap, which means it's common to see a bunch of people standing around at Ground Zero to collect that achievement.
-   **Kingdom of Loathing**:
    -   The game has a number of these for the masochistic to collect and proudly display, such as 'Brave Sir Robin', for fleeing from 100 battles, and 'The Ghoul Cup' for eating 11 nasty undead dishes that permanently reduce your stats.
    -   There is even one that you need to acquire by buying it: the "Mr. Exploiter" accessory, which can only be bought for a practically impossible amount of money.
-   In **Mabinogi**, there are several titles for embarrassing failures, such as "the Butterfingers"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>, "is a friend of Ferghus"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> and most notably "who was Defeated by a Fox at Age 17". Even with using Windmill to take out chunks of your HP, gaining the fox title takes a considerable amount of patience since you gain health passively very slowly, but still almost as fast as a fox can damage you.
-   **PlanetSide 2**'s Dasanfall leaderboards track every kill from every weapon from every player. Most players get around 1000 kills on a weapon before moving on. The "Industrial Agriculture" achievement is granted for getting **a hundred thousand kills** on one weapon, with the quip:
-   In **RIFT**, killing innocent animals occasionally drops their tears as artifacts, with flavor text such as "So sad." and "You murderer." Not only is there a full set of these such artifacts, there is even an achievement for collecting 20 of a certain type.
-   **Star Wars: The Old Republic**:
    -   After players started jumping into a sarlacc on Tatooine to quick travel to the nearest regen point, the devs added the "Worm Food" title for doing so.
    -   There's an achievement for killing 100 Jawas on Tatooine while having the Party Jawa item (which has a Jawa suspended by balloons circle around the player while throwing confetti) active. It's called "That's Just Wrong!"
    -   There's an achievement for getting a turtle that wanders around the Rishi stronghold killed. The action for doing so is labeled "You Are a Horrible Person" and it unlocks the legacy title Horrible Person.
    -   The swoop event has an achievement for hitting all the obstacles in a single race for each track – basically impossible unless you're trying. Getting the achievements for all three tracks grants the Perfect Idiot achievement.
-   **Warhammer Online** has a series of titles unlocked by failure, including dying via mobs up to a million times ("The Tragic"), being killed up to 100,000 times by enemy players ("The Feckless"), or falling to your death up to 5000 times ("The Pancake"). In addition to this, there are specific titles for being killed by each enemy class, drowning in lava, and several other dubious rewards that people nonetheless wear with pride.
-   **World of Warcraft**:
    -   An achievement "Stood in the Fire"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> required players to get killed by Deathwing when he strafed zones. It was actually harder than it sounds, given how random Deathwing's attacks were. Played even straighter after Deathwing became killable when the achievement was modified to include dying during either the Spine of Deathwing or Madness of Deathwing raid encounters. Not only does it retain its dubious value, but it now also signifies that it is likely the recipient's first time fighting Deathwing on that character.
    -   Several years and multiple expansions later, the dream lives on with "Still Standing in the Fire" for dying to the Dragonflight raid boss Fyrakk. It is accompanied by extended guttural laughter, voiced by Matthew Mercer!
    -   "It's A Trap" is an achievement given to players who walk across the obvious traps in a scenario.
    -   Some dubious achievements are gained on holidays. The "Disturbing the Peace" achievement is gained during Brewfest by getting completely drunk and dancing in the middle of Dalaran. During Children's Week, you get the "Home Alone" achievement for using your Hearthstone while with your charge, and the "Bad Example" achievement by scarfing down candy in front of him. "Out With It" is gained by eating candy during All Hallows' Eve until you puke.

---
Achievement Mockery Example in Platform Games

-   **Achievement Unlocked** is based all around this concept. The goal is to obtain all "achievements", which requires doing all sorts of strange actions.
-   The PS3 port of **Alex Kidd in Miracle World** has a trophy for losing rock-paper-scissors even while using a Telepathy Ball, and a trophy for running out of lives in Janken's dungeon with less than $400. Both trophies are named "Shameful" and "Tears of Regret" respectively.
-   **Aritana and the Harpy's Feather** has not one but six different achievements for getting hit or dying in different ways.
-   **Battleblock Theater** has the "Consolation Prize" achievement, which is awarded for dying enough times.
-   **Cave Story+** for Steam has an achievement for being killed by Toroko. As in, the harmless little Mimiga who "attacks" by running back and forth waving a stick, which only does 1 damage per hit, and you have to deliberately stand still and wait to die, if you have more than 1 HP. Even the achievement name ("Toroko Wins!") sounds surprised that it ever happened.
-   **Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy** rewards several trophies for dying in various ways over the three games. Additionally, there are trophies in **Crash Bandicoot** for spinning away an extra life and for missing over 40 crates, and one in **Cortex Strikes Back** for completing several levels without collecting the Crystal.
-   **Cuphead** gives you Selling Out for giving in to the Devil at the end of the game.
-   Roughly half of the 32 Steam achievements in **Eryi's Action** involve the many distinct ways Eryi can die. And **then** there are the achievements that involve actions that don't kill Eryi outright but instead impede her progress or make the level Unwinnable by Design, such as **destroying a goal flag**.
-   **A Hat in Time**:
    -   The "Why" achievement on PC is earned by typing something profane or lewd into Hat Kid's computer or responding to a CAW agent's question in a similar manner.
    -   The "False Detective" achievement is unlocked by completing "Murder on the Owl Express" without getting any clues. The achievement description contains the phrase "you suck" in brackets.
-   **JumpJet Rex**:
    -   Dying 500 times awards the player the achievement "JumpJet Rekt".
    -   Failing to escape the asteroid in time after planting the bomb earns the player the bad ending where Rex dies and the achievement "Rex In Peace".
-   The **La-Mulana** remake has a number of Steam achievements for falling for certain traps, but of note is the "This is La-Mulana" series of achievements, three of which involve dying to particular instant-death traps and the last of which involves getting punched by a huge stone fist into a pit in the Hell Temple. None of the things that trigger these achievements are in the original version, just to rub it in for those who have played it.
-   In **Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris**, if you end a multiplayer game with the most deaths, you receive an achievement/trophy titled "At Least You're the Best at Something".
-   In **LittleBigPlanet 2**, there's a trophy called "1,440 Minutes of Create," which is earned by spending a total of 24 hours in Create Mode. The Vita version changes this to "Get a Life". In both of those games, there's also trophies for dying 20 times in one story level, and pins (in-game achievements) for things like dying a certain number of times, coming in last place in races, drowning, killing multiple Sackbots in the story levels, slapping other players to their deaths, or popping yourself to retry. "It's really not too bad..."
-   **Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2** features an achievement for **Mega Man X6** (a game known to be notoriously hard even by **Mega Man X** standards) that requires Rookie Hunter Mode to be on<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>, and you earn it by falling into a pit. Even the **name** of the achievement ("Wait, What!?") is mockery.
-   The PS3 port of **Monster World IV** awards a trophy for jumping off the cliff at the start of the game.
-   **Nihilumbra**: There's an achievement for dying ten times in a row in any void mode level. You will probably earn this in level 1-1.
-   **Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty!** gives you the achievement "Oops..." for pulling a lever and dropping a Mudokon down a pit. The achievement description says "Fail to observe your surroundings", adding further mockery.
-   **Prinny: Can I Really Be the Hero?**: The sequel has "Diaper Rash", a medal earned by clearing 22 stages in Baby Mode. What can add to the sting is that a bonus level is locked behind obtaining all in-game medals... assuming the player doesn't know the cheat code to simply unlock said stage early.
-   **Ratchet & Clank (2016)** has an achievement for getting killed by a Pool Shark on Pokitaru.
-   Enrolling in Direct Dutposit in the very first level of the Rock Cavern will award an achievement called "Get Good" in the Steam version of **Rikki & Vikki**.
-   **SEUM: Speedrunners From Hell**:
    -   "RIP" achievement requires you to die 666 times.
    -   "100 ways to die" requires you to get killed by every type of trap in the game.
-   **Shovel Knight**: In **Plague of Shadows**, after beating the first two members of the Order of No Quarter, the return to Home Base has Plague Knight's assistant Mona dancing by herself while thinking she's alone. Sitting there and watching the entire dance, which goes on for almost 2 minutes, nets you the Feat "Creep".
-   **The Simpsons Game** has a zero-point Achievement earned by dying ten or more times during the game.

---
Achievement Mockery Example in Puzzle Games

-   **Catherine** awards "Take Your Time" for moving a Dark Block (very heavy blocks that take quite a few seconds to move) ten times in a row. Note that every level in **Catherine** is a Timed Mission, meaning this is usually a very bad idea.
-   Half of **Mine Sweeper** achievements are for failing, including losing a game on the second click, or losing an expert game at the last possible click.
-   **Pixelo**: One badge is unlocked for clicking a wrong pixel, while another is unlocked for failing a puzzle. They give gold for doing these actions when equipped.
-   **Portal 2** gives an achievement for falling for GLaDOS's trap... and another for falling for Wheatley's.
-   **The Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition** has "Ten Minutes Later...", awarded for waiting for ten (real) minutes after Guybrush gets thrown into the river.

---
Achievement Mockery Example in Racing Games

-   All games based in the **Alarm für Cobra 11** TV series has an achievement that requires you to wreck your car.
-   The thirteenth achievement in the first **American Racing** requires you to spin off 5 times, which would require you to suck and effectively get pushed around by other cars.
-   **Assetto Corsa** awards "Collateral Damage" the first time you blow your engine.
-   **F-Zero 99**: Several of the obtainable Badges are earned for Crashing Out a certain number of times.
-   In **Need for Speed: Carbon**, to unlock one of the parts, you have to earn the consolation award. You get that for losing. Another one of the parts requires an award where the player has to be arrested in career mode.
-   The **Pepega Edition** from **Need for Speed: ProStreet** has a one achievement named "Captain Slow" in which requires you to complete a race using the 1886 Mercedes-Benz Patent Motorwagen, a 19th century vintage carriage that only has 1HP with a max speed of 11 km/h making it one of the slowest vehicles in the entire racing video gaming that made debut and only in **Gran Turismo 4**.
-   **Wangan Midnight**:
    -   If you somehow time out the first stage of Story Mode (the timer is quite lenient and is only there as an Anti Idling and anti-hogging measure) rather than losing by way of having the opponent cross the finish line, you get the "Fight" title unlocked.
    -   From Stage 41 of Story Mode until the end of the current loop, losing a stage, if you have not done so yet, not only deprives you of "undefeated" rewards, but also unlocks the "First Black Mark" title.
    -   From the second loop onwards, each stage awards a unique title for winning the stage and another one for losing the stage as well. The title obtained depends on whether the loop is odd- or even-numbered.
    -   There are dozens of titles awarded for retiring in Time Attack in very specific locations.
    -   Crash your car too often during races and you'll unlock the title "Creak car".
-   **WipEout HD** (PS3) and **Omega Collection** (PS4) has a trophy for getting eliminated on Novice difficulty, i.e. getting your hovercar destroyed by an AI opponent.

Achievement Mockery Example in Rhythm Games

-   The US PS2 version of **DanceDanceRevolution: DDRMAX** unlocks the song "Celebrate" when you fail for the first time, and "Gentle Stress" when you fail an Oni course.
-   **Guitar Hero**:
    -   **Guitar Hero 3** had an achievement for failing any song a total of ten times, and **Guitar Hero 5** had another for failing after the 95% point on "Do You Feel Like We Do (Live)" by Peter Frampton.
    -   The X360 version of **Guitar Hero 2** gives you an achievement for **your first failed song**.
-   The **Persona: Dancing** spinoff games each have a trophy for failing a song.
-   In **WACCA**, clearing a chart with 1-5 misses awards the "Missless!" status. There is also a special icon of Elizabeth with her Face Framed in Shadow and looking pretty displeased if the player gets 1 Miss on a Hard or Expert chart that would've otherwise been an All Marvelous run.

Achievement Mockery Example in Roguelikes

-   **The Binding of Isaac** **Rebirth**:
    -   The Scissors are unlocked after dying 100 times. That said, unlocking (and picking up) The Scissors is required for Platinum God/Real Platinum God, so if you want that 100% Completion achievement, you'll have to get it at some point.
    -   Some of the Keeper's unlocks are this. Instead of unlocking new items, he gets his own starting items that make the game easier after you've already beaten some of the hardest bosses to get them. The biggest troll unlocks are Sticky Nickels, which permanently sometimes replaces coins with nickels you need a bomb to pick up, and beating Hush, which gives the Keeper **one penny** at the start of every future run. And yes, you'll need to do this for 100% completion. **Repentance** changed the Hush unlock so that it also started Keeper with one extra health coin.
    -   In the Afterbirth+ DLC, Resetting 7 runs in a row also unlocks the Mr. Resetter achievement and Half-Soul Hearts.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> However, this can be advantageous as it gives hearts an increased chance to spawn as a soul heart variant rather than a red heart. Because of this, **Repentance** changed the achievement to unlock scared hearts instead, which are red hearts that run away from you.
    -   Lil Spewer is unlocked by dying to your own explosive Ipecac shot. Again, picking up Lil Spewer is still needed for 100% completion.
-   **Brutal Orchestra** has a few achievements for party members dying in specific ways, such as being killed by Trigger Fingers' Boom, Headshot!, dying to an ability from a party member (such as taking a Divine Protection hit), and having a party member die **twice** to Heaven. Thankfully, these achievements unlock items for future runs.
-   **Crypt Of The Necrodancer** has an achievement for being killed by a green slime. This is actually much harder than it sounds, because the only way for most enemies to hurt you is for them to move onto the spot you're currently occupying, and green slimes don't move at all, so you need to **really** go out of your way to get the slime to attack you. You need to use Dove's flower to confuse the slime (which reverses all its movements) and then use a Scroll of Fear (which makes all enemies move away from you).
-   **Dead Cells** sports achievements for:
    -   Getting killed by a falling elevator.
    -   Dying while carrying 100 or more Cells.
    -   Performing a downward smash onto some spikes.
    -   Actively choosing to explode the Mushroom Boi pet.
-   **Death Road to Canada**:
    -   Killing the Prime Minister not only nets a Non-Standard Game Over, you get an achievement for it. Nice one, hoser.
    -   There's a cheevo that requires you let the Anime Girl explode in the car. Her detonating inside the car is a bad thing, as it'll deal 2 damage (one lethal hit, one non-lethal hit) to everyone and damage the car. In a game where the average survivor typically starts with 3 HP, this will usually leave your characters on the brink of death.
-   **Luck be a Landlord**: Arrows increase the value of symbols they point towards. There are three achievements for having arrows that don't point to anything.

Achievement Mockery Example in Role-Playing Games

-   **The Age of Decadence** has an achievement for dying on the first combat encounter.
-   **Cris Tales** has the "Technical problems" achievement. It's awarded for getting the party killed when one of your party members, JKR-721, overheats and suffers Explosive Overclocking. Thanks to HP to One attacks used by certain bosses, getting this achievement is easier than one would like.
-   **Darkest Dungeon** has a few achievements for losing heroes under specific circumstances, to highlight its brutal and unfair nature:
    -   "The First of Many has Fallen...", awarded for the first hero that dies.
    -   "We all return to dust...", for losing a Level 6 hero, as a reminder that even being at max level will not guarantee your safety.
    -   "No Retreat, No Quarter...", for your first Total Party Kill, with its counterpart "More Blood Soaks the Soil...", for a Total Party Kill against a boss. "Valiant sacrifice..." is its next step up for a Total Party Kill in The Very Definitely Final Dungeon.
    -   "The Stresses were Unbearable...", for losing a hero to a heart attack, and often requires the hero to have endured an absurd amount of physical and mental punishment.
    -   "Gnawing hunger sets in...", "Blocked from life..." and "Watch your step...", for losing a hero to hunger, clearing an obstacle by hand, and trap damage. All three are environmental hazards and you typically need a hero on Death's Door outside combat (an already bad position to be in) to even stand a chance of earning that achievement.
    -   "We return to the worms of the earth...", for losing a hero to a laughably pathetic Maggot.
    -   "That'll do, Pig...", for losing a hero to Wilbur, the Swine King's assistant, whose only attacks are to instruct the Swine King to attack, and to squeal loudly (which does only one point of damage, but also stuns). This is not so unlikely, since the Swine King has probably put at least one of your heroes on Death's Door, and Wilbur **must** be killed last or the boss will always use his strongest attack every turn.
-   **Dark Souls II** has the achievement "This is **Dark Souls**", which unlocks the first time you die. There is no known player who does not have this achievement unlocked.
-   **Disco Elysium** has some achievements like this.
    -   The crowner of mockery is "The Figurines Won't Win Her Back", with the description "They do nothing". To get this, you have to collect all the figurines hidden throughout the game, and then offer them to Dolores Dei, a.k.a. Dora, Harry's ex, when you meet her in a dream sequence. Like the name and description imply, you get absolutely nothing for doing this, not even a satisfying outcome. The whole sidequest seems designed to mock collectathon elements in games.
    -   "Baddest of the Bad Cops", for getting your Relationship Values with Kim to their lowest possible.
    -   Choose enough moralist/centrist options, and you get named "The World's Most Laughable Centrist".
-   **E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy** has several achievements of dishonor; "Nuclear Man" for gibbing yourself with the Excidium cannon, "Low Tech Dummy" for being hacked by a **door**, "Doctor Hyde" for "accidentally" teamkilling an ally through medkit overdose, plus a variety of achievements for going insane.
-   The HD remake of **Fable** has "I Did This For A Cheevo," which requires you to headshot a man standing on the Bowerstone Bridge while crossdressing. It's unlock text is simply "Congratulations. You look ridiculous."
-   In **Fallout 4**, the achievement "Touchdown!" is earned by being killed by a Super Mutant Suicider or a Mini Nuke launched with a Fat Man weapon.
-   In **Final Fantasy VIII**, there is a Steam achievement for losing a rare card in Triple Triad. Then again, you have to lose specific rare cards to the Queen of Cards to advance her sidequest, so completionists will have to get this sooner or later.
-   **Genshin Impact** has some in-game Achievements like this.
    -   **"If you put your heart into it..."** for cooking one suspicious-tasting dish, which requires failing the cooking minigame.
    -   **"...Anyone can be a gourmet."** for cooking 10 suspicious-tasting dishes.
    -   **Boared to Death**, awarded for getting killed by a wild boar (which is not even technically an enemy, rather classified as hostile Wildlife).
    -   **"...Smells Like Asphalt."**, awarded for losing a party member to the dark mud within the Chasm’s Underground Mines.
    -   **Shocking... Positively Shocking**, given for getting struck down by Balethunder, a status encountered in Inazuma.
    -   **The Bleak Midwinter**, given for succumbing to Sheer Cold (a status effect in Dragonspine which causes your HP to steadily decrease unless you're near a source of heat).
    -   **The Hunter Becomes the Hunted**, for being defeated by The Great Snowboar King (a boss in Dragonspine).
    -   **Wrath of the Gods**, awarded for getting struck by lightning.
    -   **Penalty**, given for taking damage from digging a Pyro Slime out of the ground.
-   The updated version of **The Legend of Nayuta: Boundless Trails** has the Spirit of Fortitude achievement, granted for falling 20 times.
-   **NieR: Automata** has a few of them. The first is the "What Are You Doing?" achievement for looking up 2B's dress 10 times. Then there's "Not That I Mind...", which requires you to literally blow the pants off of 9S with a self-destruct attempt, and then spend an hour playing as pantsless 9S. The third is "The Circle of Death", which requires either you or another player to retrieve your dead body (which, obviously, requires you to die first). The fourth is more of a What the Hell, Player? achievement called "Wait! Don't Kill Me!" which requires you to kill 10 friendly machine lifeforms.
-   **Penny Arcade Adventures** episode 2 has "Pervert", for inspecting a pair of binoceros testicles five times in a row, and "Reluctant Hero", for refusing to join Gabe and Tycho at the start of the game five times.
-   There are various badges in **Spore Creatures** awarded for repeatedly doing incredibly stupid or illogical things. These include fleeing combat, taking damage from hazardous terrain, making yourself sick, dying, picking fights with friends, and flubbing saving Flubit.
-   It's possible to get some titles in **Tales of Symphonia** after difficulty in battle. Some of these titles actually give decent stat boosts, especially for the stage where they can first be obtained, and are worth intentionally seeking out.
    -   Raine gets Never Say Never for dying five times in a single battle, and Survivor for being the last ally standing at the end of a battle.
    -   Presea earns Fragile Shield if her guard stance is broken by an enemy ten times in a single battle.
    -   Genis gets Study Harder! for using an elemental spell that the enemy is resistant to ten times in one battle.
    -   Colette earns Oblivious for entering a battle with her poisoned and finishing the battle without curing the poison, and Single-minded for only using one arte with Colette for the entire battle.
    -   Regal gets Pratfall King for being knocked down three times in one battle without recovering.
-   **Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE** has achievements (well, "Play Records") for trying to buy a drink from a vending machine without enough money, walking 500 meters while a party member is poisoned or unconscious, and winning 20 consolation prizes in the lottery.
-   All of **Undertale**'s PlayStation-based achievements are taking the piss out of the achievement system as a whole. They're either for anticlimactic things (acquiring one, two, three, or four items); reaching new areas of the game, which is required by the story; or for entirely superfluous, waste-of-time events (donating various amounts of money to the Dog Shrine, one coin at a time). The platinum trophy at the end? "Don't You Have Anything Better to Do?". Doubles as a Writer Revolt, since the only reason any of these achievements exist is because Sony requires that all PlayStation games have achievements, whereas Toby didn't like the idea of forcing the player to do certain things.
-   **Vindictus** has several titles, such as having one's equipment destroyed a certain number of times, and titles for picking up enough gold dropped from destroyed scenery. "Enabler" is acquired by completing a side-quest that involves bringing large amounts of booze to the town blacksmith, and the reward for spending several real-time hours fishing on Valentine's Day is "Master Baiter". Some of these require a huge number of occurrences to achieve the "highest" level of the title.
-   **Wasteland 2** has the "What Does This Button Do?" achievement, which is awarded for accidentally setting off the dormant nuke in the Ranger headquarters and getting a Non-Standard Game Over.
-   **Wasteland 3** gives you the "No-Show" achievement for dying in the prologue.
-   **Winter Voices** has the "Like A Hen On A Wire" Steam achievement. To get it, you have to obtain the worst score in every major quest of the boat.
-   **Xenoblade Chronicles 1** awards you for suffering a Total Party Kill, dying from Fall Damage, having a heart-to-heart go as badly as possible, missing attacks, and even winning a fight without actually doing anything.
-   **Xenoblade Chronicles X** has a few achievements for things like getting your first Total Party Kill (or getting fifty of them) or jumping into the game's only Bottomless Pit. Unfortunately, the game has a semi-multiplayer mode that is almost always on, and readily broadcasts your achievements for everyone to see. One particular achievement players usually saw several times a day was the one for the first time you get your Skell destroyed.

Achievement Mockery Example in Shoot 'em Ups

-   **Aaero** awards "No Points for You!" if you fail a stage.
-   **Battle Garegga Rev.2016** has "Attempted Pink Flamingos" for getting a Game Over in Stage 2 before releasing the pink flamingos.
-   **BLUE REVOLVER**:
    -   If you restart Stage 1 three times in a row, you get the "The Perfectionist" achievement. Just to rub it in further, the icon is of the pause menu with the "Restart" command highlighted.
    -   If you put in a swear word as your initials, the game will forcibly change your initials to "B★R" and give you the "How Dare You" hidden achievement.
    -   Crashing into an item ship gets you the "Supplies Delivered" hidden achievement:
        
        "Collide with a resupply ship. How?"
        
-   **Mushihime-sama Futari**'s Xbox 360 port awards an achievement for losing your last life with the Stage 5 1-Ups visible on the screen.
-   **Raiden Fighters Aces** awards a 0G secret achievement for dying 256 times.

---
Achievement Mockery Example in Simulation Games

-   **Animal Crossing: New Horizons** has Nook Miles rewards for being knocked out by a tarantula or scorpion and accidentally shooting down a balloon present over a body of water. The Miles they come with are just as good as any, though, and the descriptions on some of these read as Tom Nook trying to ease the pain of the player's mistake (and/or giving advice for the future).
-   In **APICO**, you can get an achievement for accidentally picking up a storage item with other items or liquids stored inside, dropping the former back into your inventory or spilling the latter all over and wasting them.
-   **Car Mechanic Simulator 2018** has "Kinda naked" for a balance of $0.
-   **Chorus** has "At Least You Tried" for dying in Permadeath mode; notably, there is no achievement for **beating the game** in this mode.
-   **Cute Bite**: The Checklist for things to do, has, not winning, but "Lost at arcade games".
-   **Delicious 2 Deluxe** has the "You Should Be Ashamed" achievement for letting 100 angry customers walk out the door.
-   **FreeSpace 2** has "Congratulations, you have attained the rank of Admiral. **Now go read a book.**" This is because attaining Admiral requires completing the single-player campaign roughly a hundred times. (The previous game in the series outright accuses you of cheating and urges you to stop.)
-   **HunieCam Studio** awards the player an achievement for contracting all six STDs on a single save file. While this is technically a matter of luck, STDs can be prevented with the correct items, meaning that catching so many of them would be the result of extremely poor decision-making.
-   **My Summer Car** has a plethora of Steam achievements that can be considered mockery:
    -   "An Idiot": You must break Teimo's Shop glass. Also the description says "An idiot is definition of you.".
    -   And it is gone!: Die with Permadeath mode active.
    -   Bad Guy: Get in a full jail sentence and survive without dying until you're free.
    -   Don't answer that call: As it says you should not ask the call during in an thunderstorm, but if you want to get that achievement, simply ignore the warning and it's yours.
    -   Engine started!: Attempting to play the Game Within a Game Conan McGuinness Global Rally Grand Prix 95 in the Mikropekka computer, the game within a game crashes or freezes depending the graphical settings of that game due to the Mikropekka computer having an inadequate hardware and insufficient RAM. Freezing the computer (not the real one you're using) awards you with that achievement.
    -   Finnish sisu!: You can obtain this achievement by finishing a rally with a missing wheel and its suspension.
    -   I am coward: Obtained by starting the game with permadeath off.
    -   Money well spent: Fail a car inspection.
    -   Pimped!: You must apply a pink plush dashboard cover to your Satsuma and it's yours.
    -   Smoking kills: Can be obtained by smoking while refueling which like in real life, it can be potentially dangerous so you will end up burned to death.
    -   Thank you government: Have a fine of 5,000 mk of the police.
    -   Too much power, too little skill: Get in a BMW 5 Series E34-esque looking car EDM 500LX (Kuski's car) and let him drive recklessly at the point of crashing to death.
    -   Total idiot & full idiot: You deserve this by giving Pena the finger while he's giving you a lift.
    -   Ultimate survivor: Drink your pee.
    -   What a shock!: Die by peeing on the TV, fuse table or the computer. The description says "Too long walk to the toilet perhaps?".
-   In **The Sims Medieval**, some achievements are ones that are not very good. A noteworthy one is "Have 25 people die in your Kingdom," which since the maximum population of hero Sims is only 12, 25 deaths have to come from either questing so badly you have to remake your heroes multiple times, or killing off a majority of your original NPC population, which weakens your kingdom.
-   In **Spore**:
    -   There's the "Joker" badge that you can earn if you enter a cheat code in the space stage. This badge prevents you from getting any further achievements. There's also a hidden "Pathological Cheater" achievement that you get upon cheating 50 times.
    -   The secret badge that you can get from allying with the Grox is called "Dance With The Devil", and getting it does not give you any badge points.
    -   If you get 30 of your pack members killed in the creature stage, you'll be awarded with the "General Custer" achievement.
    -   Should you die at least once in every stage of the game, you'll get the "Can't Win For Losing" achievement.
    -   There used to be a hidden "Bad Baby" achievement that you could get if a creation of yours was banned from Sporepedia, but it had to be removed because players were deliberately uploading offensive creations in order to get it.
-   **Surgeon Simulator 2013**:
    -   "What Have I Done??" requires you to lose your patient within 15 seconds.
    -   "Hammer Time" requires you to lose a total of 50,000ml of blood using the hammer.
    -   "It's In! It's In I Tell You!" requires you to lose the patient even though the replacement organ lands safely in its intended spot.
    -   "Enter The Code" is awarded for successfully typing in a code during the space surgery that opens up the door to outside, leading to a Non-Standard Game Over.
    -   "I Have No Idea What I'm Doing" requires you to quickly smash up all the canisters containing the replacement organs during the alien surgery.
-   **Viscera Cleanup Detail** has an achievement awarded for getting fired, which requires you to leave the area you were supposed to clean up with an even **worse** mess.
-   In **Warhawk**, the Play Station 3 version has several of the bronze trophies be awarded for such dubious feats as stepping on 5 land mines, or flying into your own aerial mine.

Achievement Mockery Example in Sports Games

-   The Xbox 360 version of **2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa** has a "Shameful" achievement for quitting out of an online match five times. It offers no points to your gamerscore and only exists as a badge of dishonor.

---
Achievement Mockery Example in Stealth-Based Games

-   From **Deceit**, you have an achievement called MVP for earning the most XP of the whole lobby in a game (XP tracking how much you accomplish) and one called... LVP for doing the exact opposite. To top it all, the icon for LVP is a hand doing a L sign with the pointer and thumb.
-   If you lose ten times in a standard **Devilish Hairdresser** game, you get the "Angel Wannabe" award, mocking you for failing to mess with the Angelic Hairdresser.
-   In **Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty**, the Snake Beater achievement is a 10G achievement for Snake getting caught, uhm, stimulating himself.
-   **Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots** has:
    -   "You enjoy all the killing, that's why." for killing so many enemies in one area that Snake vomits.
    -   "Handle with Caution" for breaking off a statue's penis.
    -   "You're pretty good." for getting kissed by Ocelot during the final battle, which happens if you don't press any buttons for a while during what appears to be a Press X to Not Die situation.
-   **Octodad**:
    -   "Trim Your Moustache" requires you to get sucked into the riding mower. Normally, the lawn mower section occurs immediately after you attach the fallen birdhouse onto its hook, after which your arm gets glued to it and you can't let go. But if you **throw** the birdhouse onto the hook, then you can enjoy getting yourself a Non-Standard Game Over.
    -   "Number 100 Dad" requires you to die more than 100 times in a playthrough.

---
Achievement Mockery Example in Strategy Games

-   **Advance Wars: Dual Strike**: While not officially achievements, the game has several medals to earn by completing various milestones, such as building/destroying a certain number of each type of unit, capturing a certain number of properties, and so on. Two of these milestones are to earn a specific number of D Ranks and E Ranks in missions. In a strange twist, it can actually be harder to earn these ranks than even an S Rank, since normally if you're doing poorly enough to earn a D or an E, you're probably not far off from failing the map outright. Most people achieve these two medals simply by screwing around on the first mission.
-   **Age of Empires II** and its expansions have Steam achievements...including achievements for **losing** certain amounts of units, buildings and games.
-   **Civilization V**: Some achievements are less than complimentary, including "He threw a car at my head!" for having to buy back one of your cities from barbarian conquerors.
-   **Crusader Kings II**:
    -   "Keeping It in the Family": Sire an Inbred child
    -   "One Is Not Amused": Have a discontented council (**Conclave** DLC)
    -   "An Honest Mistake": While secluded, kick someone out who did not have bubonic plague (**The Reaper's Due** DLC)
    -   "Scarrrrrred for Life": Become one-eyed, one-legged, and one-handed (**TRD**)
    -   "Aptly Named": Die of the bubonic plague (**TRD**)
-   **Hearts of Iron**:
    -   "The weapons of the Third Emu War" requires you to develop a nuclear bomb as Australia and use it to bomb your own territory.
    -   "Panda-monium" is awarded to the player for playing as any Chinese warlord state and going to war with every other Chinese warlord state (simultaneously.)
    -   "You Will Never Kill Me Alive" requires the player to order one of their spies to take a cyanide pill after getting captured.
-   **2nd Original Generations** has a trophy titled "King of Being Shot Down" (roughly translated from Japanese) if you lose five of your mechs in a single stage.
-   **Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis** has a few unflattering medals with penalty effects:
    -   **Bogus Hero**, if you gain 20 or more levels while sparring your own units.
    -   **Don Quixote**, if you attack someone and the counterattack damage deals 2/3 of your max health.
    -   Clerics and Priests can earn a third one, **Gibe of the Fallen Angel**, by killing three enemies with physical attacks.
-   **Total War: Shogun 2** includes an achievement for sinking or capturing a particularly powerful ship. Possibly due to a programming oversight, you still get this achievement if it's **you** that loses the ship in question.

Achievement Mockery Example in Survival Horror

-   In **Alien: Isolation**, you get an achievement for dying to the Alien 100 times, called "100 Times Too Many".
-   **Dead Rising 2: Off The Record** has an achievement for receiving your first medal (out of many you can earn in sandbox mode). The flavor text reads: "It says 'Participant' in tiny letters on the bottom..."
-   **Lust for Darkness** has a sequence when the Apocalypse Cult which serves as the antagonists has an orgy in their manor; there's an achievement for looking at the orgy for 10 minutes. Since the part of the plot when the orgy takes place is very short, linear, features no exploration at all, and ends after activating the only interactable item in the level, getting the achievement means the player spent 10 minutes staring at animated NPCs doing dirty stuff (completing the level normally is much, much faster than 10 minutes). There's also three separate achievements earned by dying during the game (one for being caught by the cultists, one for dying inside the Lusst'ghaa dimension, and one for wearing the mask long enough to become insane).
-   **House of Ashes** has "Six Minutes Of Night", wherein you have everyone survive the game just to be killed in the last few minutes of the story.
-   The HD remaster of **Resident Evil 4** has "Don't Shoot The Water", awarded for provoking Del Lago into swallowing Leon whole, which is done by shooting into the lake.
-   The HD Remaster for **Resident Evil (Remake)** has "Get Used To It", gotten by dying for the first time.
-   The **Five Nights at Freddy's** games have a few of these:
    -   From **Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator**, the bankrupt ending, requiring you to run out of cash:
        
        **"You gave it your best shot. You went all in. You put all your eggs in one basket, and did the unthinkable: you ran out of cash. While we encourage entrepreneurs to follow their dreams, we also recognize a lost cause when we see one. There are no do-overs, and we trust that you know your way out. But before you go, take this Certificate of Bankruptcy. Now do everyone a favor, and get lost."**
        
    -   From the same game is the mediocrity certificate, which requires you to buy/salvage absolutely nothing:
        
        **"Congratulations! You've completed a full week on the job, and you've done it in such a lackluster way that no one is proud or disappointed. It's a fine line to walk, but you did it, completing your job with such an efficient level of laziness that we're surprised you're able to dress yourself in the morning. While such a minimalist work ethic is rare, it doesn't mean that we want you back. In fact, it means you should look for employment elsewhere. But before you go, take this Certificate of Mediocrity. You should be proud. You stood on two feet, and convinced someone that you could do something, when in fact you couldn't. Now get out."**
        
    -   As a general example, every game with an achievement system has an achievement which requires you to get Jumpscared, and these have the lowest Xbox score across the board, with **Five Nights at Freddy's 2's** "You Failed" achievement having a paltry **15** points, with the second lowest, "One Night at Freddy's" having 60 points.
-   **Tormented Souls** has the achievement simply called "Death", where you walk into a unlit area and get attacked by...something
-   **Yomawari: Lost in the Dark**: The "Indomitable" achievement requires you to die 30 times.

Achievement Mockery Example in Third-Person Shooters

-   **Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard**, as an Affectionate Parody of games in general, also takes the piss out of achievements. You get achievements for starting the game, watching the credits, and pausing, and there's even a few achievements for features that **aren't in the game**, such as an interrogation minigame and multiplayer. Matt just throws them at you at arbitrary points of the campaign.
-   **Kid Icarus: Uprising** will reward you with achievements for:
    -   Being turned into an eggplant. This and the one below can be awarded to you in multiplayer provided that player has already "achieved" the status;
    -   Being turned into a tempura, and then being turned into a tempura five times. Be it by enemies or other players going out of their way to humiliate you;
    -   Being "finished" (the game's equivalent of a Game Over) a certain amount of times.
-   Dying on the lowest difficulty in **50 Cent: Blood on the Sand** unlocks the "Not Bulletproof" achievement. Appropriately, it is worth zero Gamerscore on the Xbox 360 version.

-   In **Bully**, if you fail three class minigames in a row you unlock a Dunce Cap as a wearable item.
-   In **Grand Theft Auto III** in the Definitive Edition versions there's a Social Club achievement called, Am Walkin' Here in which can be obtained by getting killed by being run over.

    -   "When Pigs Fly", an achievement for riding a pig while it takes fall damage. Since most animals try to avoid cliffs, this requires the player to direct the mount with a carrot on a stick.
    -   "Serious Dedication", an advancement involving hoes (the tool); the advancement has been altered as of the update that introduced Netherite, but both versions qualify.
        -   Original: building a diamond hoe, diamonds themselves being a limited resource and adding nothing to the tool besides durability, and wearing down all of its 1562 uses until it breaks. The in-game description for this version of the advancement is 'Completely use up a diamond hoe, and then reevaluate your life choices.'
        -   New version: Building a diamond hoe, diamonds themselves being a limited resource and adding nothing to the tool besides durability. Then collecting enough Ancient Debris (which is substantially rarer than diamond, and can only be found in the Nether) to make a netherite ingot, which can be used to upgrade any diamond item. Then, using that ingot to upgrade your diamond hoe into a netherite hoe - which, again, adds nothing to the tool besides durability. The in-game description for this version of the advancement is 'Use a Netherite Ingot to upgrade a hoe, and then reevaluate your life choices.'
-   **Saints Row IV** has a scene where Zinyak asks you to surrender and be executed, and promises that if you do so he'll set everyone else free. Doing so will get you a Non Standard Game Over and the "You Chose... Poorly" achievement.
-   **Marvel's Spider-Man 2**: Trying to perform an aerial trick too long results in Spider-Man face-planting into the ground and gets you the trophy "Splat!"
-   **The Stanley Parable**: Multiple:
    -   There's an achievement for attempting to jump, titled "You Can't Jump".
    -   There's also "Click On Door 430 Five Times", which is meant to parody meaningless achievements. If you try to do exactly what the achievement says, the Narrator will express his disbelief about you being awarded an achievement for something so simple, and thus he'll send you all over the place doing all sorts of odd tasks in order to have you "work" for your achievement.
    -   Finally you can receive the achievement "Go Outside" for **not playing** the game for **five years straight.** The earliest date you could possibly achieve this without cheating is October 17th, 2018. The Updated Re-release ups the ante by upping the amount of time to ten straight years. The earliest date to achieve that one without cheating is April 27th, 2032.
    -   The demo also features a fake achievement (fake as in it produces a real Steam achievement popup but it automatically revokes itself once it's been earned so as to not show up in your profile, and can be re-earned every time you play) called "Video Games!!" for dropping a cup in a trashcan.
-   **Superman Returns** awards the "Not that Super" achievement in the Xbox 360 version for entering a cheat during the game. It's worth zero gamerscore, and includes a picture of Supes wagging his finger disappointingly at you.
-   **Terraria** has achievements like "Watch Your Step!", which is awarded for dying to one of the traps that are randomly generated underground, and "Dead Men Tell No Tales", which is awarded for getting killed trying to open a booby-trapped "Dead Man's Chest".

    -   Having a Heart-to-Heart go as badly as possible.
    -   Suffering a Total Party Kill for the first time.
    -   Suffering a Total Party Kill fifty times.
    -   Dying of fall damage.
    -   Missing 100 attacks.
    -   Winning a battle without actually doing anything, because you had the AI members of your party fight for you.
-   **Xenoblade Chronicles X** awards the player an achievement for:
    -   Suffering a Total Party Kill for the first time.
    -   Suffering a Total Party Kill fifty times.
    -   Getting your Skell destroyed for the first time (you'll see this one a lot, due to the game announcing every achievement that a player on your server gets).
    -   Running out of Skell fuel. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
    -   Falling into a Bottomless Pit.
    -   Falling into a bottomless pit one hundred times.
    -   Failing an online mission.

Achievement Mockery Example in Other

-   Many arcade games, particularly Shoot 'em Ups, will award the player exactly 1 point for using a continue (sometimes also zeroing out the upper digits) up to a maximum of 9 times while everything else is scored in multiples of 10. This makes the last digit of the player's score reveal how many times they continued.
-   The Xbox 360's Achievement System assigns achievements an arbitrary point value, which is tallied as a "gamerscore" on the user's profile. A few games took advantage of this to create mocking "negative achivements" worth **zero** points.
-   **Brawl Royale**: Among the **Epic Battle Fantasy Collection** version's 13 medals is "Masochist", earned by being killed by every in-game opponent in a single sitting.
-   **Capcom Arcade Stadium** and its **2nd** version: For each compilation, getting a Game Over in any game unlocks an achievement.
    
    **Triumph completed!**: First Failure.
    
-   Every installment from **Kuukiyomi** has an achievement list also known as "Hidden List". Most achievements require you to do something (ridiculously) inconsiderate/incorrect. For example: "A Single Bite" achievement from **Kuukiyomi 2: Consider It More! - New Era** is acquired by eating the whole cake piece instead of doing as C-Ko (the player protagonist's girlfriend) says: take a single bite of it.
-   The mobile phone Virtual Paper Doll game **Love Nikki - Dress Up Queen** has "Momo's Nightmare" achievements, obtained by failing styling contest stages.
-   The chess app **Play Magnus** has some less-than-flattering achievements:
    -   "I Pity the Fool": Lose through a Fool's Mate. Even beginners almost always manage to avoid it.
    -   "The Last Straw": Be checkmated despite having a large material advantage.
    -   "Murphy's Law": Be checkmated by Magnus at 5 years. He's programmed to play random legal moves, so if you lose to him and didn't do it on purpose, it's pretty embarrassing.
    -   "The Weakest Link": Be checkmated in 100 games.
-   On Stack Overflow, a badge named "Tumbleweed" used to be awarded for asking questions that get no response from the community. The badge was retired in 2019, as it was found too discouraging.
-   **World of Warships** has the "Detonation" achievement. To obtain this you have to be unlucky enough to be struck in the ship's magazines and fail an RNG roll, which instantaneously obliterates you regardless of how much health you have left. As a crowning irony, you are then awarded ten signal flags which, when fitted to your ship, **specifically prevent detonation**.

-   **South Park**, "Guitar Queer-O": Stan and Kyle succeed at reaching one million points in **Guitar Hero** and they are congratulated... by being called fags by the game itself.
