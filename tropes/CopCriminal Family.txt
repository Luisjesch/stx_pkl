CopCriminal Family: 
The contrast between law and crime is very strong. They're typically stereotyped as Lawful Good and Chaotic Evil respectively, but may even be Lawful Evil and Chaotic Good, or anywhere in between. The point is, a character who works in law enforcement, such as a police officer, a detective, a lawyer, and so on, and a career criminal, will have a strong disparity between them.

With this in mind, a good way to induce drama (or even humor) between a law enforcer and a criminal is to have them be related. They might be siblings, or parent and child, but they should ideally be close.

This raises the dilemma of how the lawful one reacts to the criminal one. Are they aware of their relative's criminal doings?

Despite the name, the "cop" side is not just limited to police officers. It can be anyone who enforces the law, including, as mentioned previously, detectives, lawyers, and also judges, and so on.

Superbeings may apply, as there are likely quite a few familial relations between superheroes/villains, but they are a special case. Some superheroes are purely vigilante, and aim to fight bad people independently of the law. For superheroes to apply for this trope, **they must be clearly working with/for the law.** Please explain this in the context of the examples.

May overlap with The Cobbler's Children Have No Shoes, Sibling Yin-Yang, Foolish Sibling, Responsible Sibling, Outside Man, Inside Man, and Cain and Abel. Compare Dating Catwoman, where the relationship is romantic rather than familial. Related to Standard Cop Backstory, in that many fictional officers were exposed to crime in the family in some way as a child. The cop character may be a Reformed Criminal who's trying to stay straight. If the family as a whole is overwhelmingly on one side or the other with just one odd member out, you've got Black Sheep or White Sheep. Compare Divine–Infernal Family for a cosmic version.

-   Played with in **The Red Line**. The Evans family (Paul, Gary, and Jim) are all cops. Paul accidentally shoots a doctor, mistakenly believing him to be a criminal because he's black.

Things get hilariously inverted and muddy when Investi-Gator gets **himself** arrested despite committing no crime, and Insti-Gator takes it upon himself to investigate some suspicious new characters who he suspects are behind everything (and they are), and then acts as Investi-Gator's lawyer in court. This has the benefit of showing that Insti-Gator really does love his brother, and doesn't just use him to get away with crimes.
