Cyborg: 
Follow

_"The Terminator's an infiltration unit, part man, part machine. Underneath, it's a hyper-alloy combat chassis — microprocessor-controlled, fully armored. Very tough. But outside, it's living human tissue — flesh, skin, hair, blood, grown for the cyborgs."_

Cybernetics: The science of grafting mechanical/electronic enhancements on organic creatures, oftentimes by replacing limbs with robotic parts or even mechanical weapons (such as an Arm Cannon), for instance, though often it's only called cybernetics if it's a smidge more complicated.

Cybernetics (from Gratuitous Greek for "piloting", because Everything Sounds Futuristic in Greek) is the study and development of regulated systems; a cyborg (short for **cyb**ernetic **org**anism) would be a human integrated with a control-feedback system.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  For example, a hearing aid sends amplified signal into the ear canal, and can be controlled with a finger on the volume. A pacemaker detects heart rhythms and sends its own impulses to regulate it. A peg leg neither sends nor receives signal, but more sophisticated prosthetics include voluntary control systems, and even some simulated tactile feedback.

So anyway, what you end up with is everyone thinking of cybernetics as meaning putting mechanical parts on a living being, and it's not even too wrong to use it like that, although in real life, it could also just mean studying any control-feedback system.

As Hollywood Science, cybernetics in fiction often involves replacing an entire body except for half a face/chest with mechanical parts and can go as advanced as having a lone brain reside inside a machine, while cybernetics in Real Life presently peaks at ocular implants with low frame-rate and gray-scale vision. If your generic Mad Scientist has a specialty in robotics, or even dabbles in it, you should expect this trope to come up relatively soon. Those who have been subject to cybernetics are called Cyborgs, as opposed to Androids, which are Ridiculously Human Robots. It's somewhat common in media that take place in the "present", and will almost certainly come up in storylines 20 Minutes into the Future.

There's also the matter of how one starts off. Cyborgs include biological humans with parts replaced with machinery, while machines with biological parts added are instead Wetware Body, Meat-Sack Robot or Organic Technology (or if put together from scratch, an Artificial Human.) Whether or not this detracts from them being a person depends on the series. Sometimes as long as the brain is organic, in lieu of Brain Uploading, it's a person. Sometimes not even then.

In the original definition of "cybernetics", it was the study of constructing machines by mimicking real organisms, e.g., building insect robots that process sensory and motion information like insects do. Thus, "cybernetic organism" can refer to such a pure machine. The "super-prosthetic" part came later, but it has overshadowed the earlier definition. "Bionics" is an older term from the design field, where it meant mimicking nature in order to get an elegant, functional product (see Victor Papanek's seminal book, _Design For The Real World_ for multiple examples). It was used much in this manner by Martin Caidin's early 1970s novel _Cyborg_, to describe mechanical prosthetics designed to look and act like real limbs, but in the adaptation of _Cyborg_ into _The Six Million Dollar Man_, the "elements of nature" aspect was lost, and it became a generic term for the enhancement of people with mechanical parts. Fortunately for those who use it for its original meaning, this definition is seldom seen anymore.

Common things used in cybernetics include the Restraining Bolt, the Arm Cannon and Artificial Limbs. On the highest level of tech we have Nanomachines infusing biological beings. Just be careful not to overdo it, if you're in a setting where Cybernetics Eat Your Soul or where they're treated as Power Upgrading Deformations. Often cybernetics is used as an excuse to bring someone Back from the Dead, even if the brain has been dead a while. One can certainly expect some questions about What Measure Is a Non-Human?, and an attempt to take over or "replace" mundane humanity is not out of the question. Of course, it's also possible for most cyborgs to be Pro Human Transhumans.

Note that in many cases, a Hollywood Style Cyborg will become super strong or super fast just from replacement of arms and/or legs. Actually, the replacement limbs would require extensive attachments throughout the body, otherwise, the limbs would rip themselves from the body, among other non-optimal outcomes.

Outside of transhumanist subculture, cyborgs tend to be viewed as one of the most horrifying monster types in existence by mainstream audiences. If you're trying to convince an audience that your villain is completely morally irredeemable, portraying them as a cyborg is one of the easiest and most effective ways to do it.

See its Super-Trope Transhuman for _all_ ways of enhancement. May also overlapped with Human Weapon. If you're of a transhuman bent, prepare for a dose of I Want My Jetpack. Contrast Meat-Sack Robot, when organic components are grafted onto an artificial body.

Cyborg Example in Anime & Manga

-   In the early '90s OVA **8 Man After**, there are two different types of cyborgs, both of whom rely on stimulants to keep their brains' motor functions from conflicting with the cybernetics. 8 Man himself is a total body replacement with a human brain, while the cyborgs he fights, Cyber Junkies, are street punks who cut off and replace limbs with high-powered weapons and abilities. Unfortunately, the Cyber Junkies rely on a crude version of the stimulant that eventually turns their brains to mush and makes them psychotically violent.
-   Jinno, of **Afro Samurai**, or at least when he is reintroduced in episodes 3-4. He has certain human parts, like his head, arms, and legs, but has to rely entirely on a mechanical body for his strength, breathing, and possibly his vision.
-   Both **Appleseed** and **Ghost in the Shell** by Masamune Shirow have cybernetics anywhere from a replacement finger to a full-body conversion.
    -   Shirow goes into detailed explanations as to the limitations of such enhancements: an organic human frame puts limits on how much ability enhancement cybernetics can impart, so simply having a cybernetic arm doesn't mean that arm would have super-strength, unless it was heavily tied in and firmly attached to the body. Thus, a fully cybernetic body has much greater capabilities than a person with a largely original organic body and more limited cybernetics. Further, in **Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society**, a character with limited cybernetics adds more. He is told to be careful, since his organic body will be put under further strain by this.
    -   Full-body cyborgs get to keep their reproductive systems too, or get new ones. Not so much in **Ghost in the Shell**, especially in the first movie, in which Motoko states she is incapable of birth due to her completely artificial body. In the **Appleseed** manga, however, this is made very clear, since Deunan Knute (a human) and Briareos Hecatonchires (a full-body replacement) are known to have a physical as well as romantic relationship.
    -   **Ghost in the Shell** features "full-body replacement" cyborgs as primary characters, who have been modified to the point where the only thing that's human about them is their brain.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> One of the Tachikomas (insect-like, sentient mecha) successfully passes the Turing Test by claiming to be a full-body replacement when questioned. Motoko Kusanagi occasionally angsts about whether the military may have replaced her brain without telling her, presumably uploading her into a robot. As later events show, this is a valid possibility. The series explores the question of whether Cybernetics Eat Your Soul — a pressing question in this setting because the slope to becoming a full cyborg is slippery indeed.
-   Parodied in **Astro Fighter Sunred** when Florsheim decide to create a horrible cyborg monster to defeat Sunred by... Fusing a moth monster with a piece of lead pipe. Yeah, they replaced his right forearm with the lead pipe. Sunred is unimpressed.
-   **Battle Angel Alita** also goes the full-conversion route. Toyed-with somewhat in the final stages of the original manga, the residents of Tiphares/Zalem, all of whom thought they were wholly human (distinguishing them from the mongrel cybernetic hordes living below), discover that the network governing Tipharean society routinely takes all citizens upon their reaching maturity, downloads the knowledge from their brains onto small black chips, steals their brains, and leaves them with the chip as a replacement. While (almost) every cyborg in the Scrapyard, no matter how modified, has a human brain the Tiphareans can claim no such thing. This comes as something of a shock. It turns out later that Tiphares/Jeru is basically a one giant farm for Wetware CPUs utilized in Ketheres/Zalem computers, and Tiphares citizens are considered second class at best in the Solar System at large. There's also Jupiter whose population is 100% cyborgs of even fuller conversion than the norm elsewhere. Venus avoids this, though, concentrating on Organic Technology, and most of their citizens choose a genetically engineered Humpty-Dumpty-like body.
-   **Change 123**: Col. Ralph Austin (an American soldier) lost his left arm and had it replaced with an advanced prosthetic.
-   **Code Geass**: Jeremiah Gottwald is outfitted with various cybernetics after being nearly killed by Kallen during the Battle of Narita, and then later rebuilt some more in the second season. He ends up with neural interfaces, built-in arm swords and bulletproof armor, and most importantly a Geass Canceller in his left eye.
-   In **Cyberpunk: Edgerunners**, David starts the series with the standard neural interface as well as ocular implants that most people have. He's closer to a Full-Conversion Cyborg after the Time Skip: he has Cyber Eyes, the Sandevistan (Spine), Maine's Cyberarms, jump-boosting Cyber Legs, a Ballistic Torso, and muscle enhancements. Doc lampshades this transformation, as he questions whether David is less organic than machine with the number of enhancements he installed. And this is **before** he installs the cyberskeleton, which exaggerates this by turning him into a Mini-Mecha (aside from his torso and head).

-   **Dorothy of Oz**: Namu initially believes he is an android (a robot that merely looks human), but it turns out he's actually a cyborg and thus half human. This turns out to be the reason behind his unwillingness to let anyone get killed while he's in the vicinity, which is, of course, a good thing for everyone involved.
-   **Dragon Ball**:
    -   In **Dragon Ball**, Mercenary Tao returns as a cyborg after being injured by a grenade he tried to use to kill Goku.
    -   Introduced in **Dragon Ball Z**, unlike most of Dr. Gero's creations, #17 and #18 are cyborgs, not androids. Android #20 is a robot body which houses Gero's brain. Cell is a strange case, being a bio-organism made using cells from powerful warriors. This confusion is because in the original japanese they're called "Jinzōningen", which has no english equivalent and roughly means Artificial Human / Person (like a science fiction golem). The English dub of the anime calls them "Androids", while the French dub calls them **all** Cyborgs, neither of which really fit for Cell. The English dub in particular got bit in the Boo Arc where #18 has a child, something which an Android (fully mechanical) couldn't do but a Cyborg (partially organic) might.
    -   Frieza also becomes a cyborg after being defeated by Goku on Namek. Oddly enough, in Hell he isn't allowed to keep his cyborg body, while Dr. Gero is. Perhaps it was because he was reverted back to how he was before he suffered the massive body mutilation in his fight with Goku. Gero was revived with a new humanoid body after escaping Hell — which was altered from the human flesh once again.
    -   Dr. Wheelo from **Dragon Ball Z: The World's Strongest** is, like Gero, a Brain in a Jar; at the movie's climax, it turns out that the "jar" is actually the torso of a Humongous Mecha, allowing him to battle Goku personally.
    -   **Dragon Ball Z: The Return of Cooler**: The film has the heroes take on an army of cyborg clones of the villain Cooler created by a gigantic parasitic cyber-planet known as the Big Gete Star.
    -   This comes up in **Dragon Ball Super** as Goku decides to recruit 17 and 18 for the Tournament of Power. The Supreme Kai worries that being machines would disqualify them, but Goku counters that they're still humans with incredible power. Beerus just covers his ears and pretends not to hear it.
-   Damaramu from **Dragon Half** is this starting from his second encounter with Mink. By the third, he's little more than a head that plugs into various robotic chassis, something which never helps him in his fights, because no matter how powerful a body he finds, it still can't make up for the fact that he's an idiot.
-   **Eden: It's an Endless World!** features cybernetics prominently, from replacement limbs or eyes to full-body cyborgs (particularly useful to soldiers and hackers). The prosthetic parts are extremely common and seemingly available to all but the poorer characters, despite the story being being set barely a century from now. It's nicely justified by the recent body drying plague that crippled half of the world's population and triggered a technological revolution.
-   **Fullmetal Alchemist**
    -   Edward Elric, with his automail limbs; in particular, he's able to use alchemy to turn his automail arm into a sword as needed. Alphonse is sort of the magical version of this, being a disembodied soul animating a suit of armor.
    -   Buccaneer, Paninya, and Lan Fan fall into this as well. Buccaneer's automail arm has a **chainsaw attachment**.
    -   Canon Foreigner Colonel Archer in **Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)** was blown up at one point, but came back in a half-robot form.
-   **GaoGaiGar**: Guy Shishioh is 90% machine, having been caught up in a space accident involving his shuttle, Galeon, and EI-01 — it's actually Galeon who brings him back safe, and Galeon's technology that's used in rebuilding him. First describes himself as "The greatest cyborg in history", and has a valid claim towards it — but subverts it by collapsing after his first battle, as becoming GaoGaiGar puts a lot of strain on him, even without using Hell and Heaven. It turns out that it takes upwards of a week for his body's immune system to adjust to replacement parts, and if not for Mamoru's abilities with G-Stones, he would not have been able to fight in the second episode, nor survive certain events afterwards. After the end of the series, he (and Mikoto) become "Evoluders", something that isn't entirely explained, other than the effect that he can still use the GaoMachines just fine, but looks like a normal human.
-   **Gundam**:
    -   Starting with **Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam**, we have Enhanced Humans or Cyber-Newtypes, which modify their brain with electronics and other things to grant them Newtype abilities. Sadly, they also have the ability to make people go crazy since you're messing with their mind.
    -   In **Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury**, this is the main purpose of the GUND format, granting people new cybernetic limbs to replace lost ones. The GUND-ARM angle was an attempt to repurpose this into making better Mobile Suits, thus "Gundams".
-   **Gunslinger Girl**. The girls are cyberized, and the cybernetics will kill them eventually, though they still act like little girls when they're not assassinating people for the Italian government.
-   In **Inuyasha**, Ginkotsu of the Band of Seven is a heavily modified cyborg in feudal Japan.
-   **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Battle Tendency** gives us Rudolf von Stroheim, the Nazi cyborg (yes, **Nazi** cyborg), complete with a chest turret and swastika-shaped eye laser. He's on the protagonist's side.
-   **Knights of Sidonia** has a lot of these going around: the cadet dorm manager is a human brain transplanted into a **bear's** body with a mechanical right hand, and Izana has several limbs replaced by robotics after a nasty war wound (she could have had fully organic replacements grown and grafted on, but the mechanical parts were faster and had some other advantages). None of this is treated as strange or remarkable in the slightest by the characters (almost all of whom are Transhuman in some respect or another).
-   **Koi Koi 7**: The titular Amazon Brigade and Gantai are cyborgs, though they mostly appear to be normal humans, save for the superpowers. Otome is the most mechanical of the group, having to "feed" herself through an electric cable.
-   **Kotetsu Jeeg**: Hiroshi was turned by his father into this. Plus, he can transforms into a giant head, which then combines with man-made parts to form a Humongous Mecha.
-   **Lyrical Nanoha** features the Combat Cyborgs: Subaru and Ginga Nakajima and the twelve Numbers. The lore mentions that cybernetic prosthetics are readily available thanks to Mid-Childan medicine, but the Combat Cyborgs take it a dozen steps further, having been genetically engineered from before birth to incorporate extensive combat-oriented cybernetic enhancements without their bodies rejecting it all. The series also offers a justification for where all those enhancements draw power from: all Combat Cyborgs are latent mages whose bodies generate mana (essentially the "energy of life" in this setting) and a special implant continuously converts it to electricity to power the circuits.
-   **Macross**:
    -   **Super Dimension Fortress Macross**: several Zentraedi are shown to have mechanical parts (notably half of Breetai's head). In the movie incarnation of the series, the Big Bad was permanently wired up and connected to his flagship, acting as a sort of living control computer.
    -   **Macross Frontier** shows that humans have begun utilizing cyborg components, and a cyborg pilot proves to be far superior to almost all flesh-and-blood humans, being able to mentally control his machine and withstand far greater G-forces. The Big Bad is the logical conclusion, being an example of Brain Uploading of a large number of people into one mind which controls a robotic, but fully human-looking, body.
-   **Mazinger Z**:
    -   All villains — except Big Bad Dr. Hell — are cyborgs: Baron Ashura, Count Brocken, their Mooks... all of them — except by Archduke Gorgon — are created by Hell himself. Usually he fabricates his cyborgs by modifying corpses, replacing damaged parts with artificial limbs or organs and implanting cybernetic components in their brains to create obedient, brainwashed slaves (and there's at least one scene in one of the manga versions where Baron Ashura kills many people off, gloating they will be transformed into cyborgs and turned into slaves. Now you know what happened to all people who died when a Mechanical Beast attacked). However, in at least one instance he saves the life of the subject — Count Brocken — by turning him into a cyborg. Other cyborg characters are Kenzo Kabuto and in the Gosaku Ota manga Kouji Kabuto himself is turned into one by the end of the series.
    -   **Great Mazinger**: Prof. Kenzo Kabuto and Archduke Gorgon. And if you keep in mind the Warrior Monsters were bio-mechanical Humongous Mecha were controlled by the brain of a Mykene soldier grafted into it, then you have to that series' Robeasts were giant cyborgs.

-   **Naruto**: Sasori turns himself into this, using magic puppetry instead of hard robotics. His gran did the same thing, but only to one arm.
-   **One Piece**:
    -   After he gets run over by the Sea Train, Franky saves himself by replacing just about all his body parts in the front with mechanical parts from a old wrecked warship that was floating around. It should also be noted that Franky built himself. Then there's Bartholemew Kuma of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Unlike Franky he wasn't built from scraps, and it shows. At this point, it's not clear how much of him is still human, or if he's the equivalent of a Terminator now. As of chapter 560 the Pacifista transformation process (which was done gradually over time) was recently completed, leaving him a mute emotionless machine.
    -   After the two year time skip, we find that Franky has "upgraded" himself even more robotic-looking. His shoulders are massive and spherical, and his forearms are cubes attached with giant screws (to list the two most obvious differences). In his own words, he's "completely beyond human understanding now!" Everyone else just finds it cool, though... except for Nami and Robin.
    -   There are a few other minor cyborg characters running around the series, such as Kaido's servant Scotch.
-   **Sailor Moon**: Naoko Takeuchi once planned to make Ami Mizuno a cyborg, to justify her incredible intelligence. She was even planned to Become a Real Boy and to make a Heroic Sacrifice since she "wasn't human anyways", but instead the cyborg elements were incorporated into Hotaru, who had wired limbs and mechanical parts visible through them (this is due to her father experimenting on her to keep her alive). Hotaru even despairs of her body feeling "bloodless".
-   **Science Ninja Team Gatchaman**: Condor Joe was brought back for the sequel as a cyborg after having been killed at the end of the first series. Enhanced strength, speed, senses, reflexes and a bomb for Sosai X next to his heart.
-   **Trigun**: Vash the Stampede. Besides the replacement arm, other parts of his body have apparently been "repaired" with non-organic material. Idem his brother.

Cyborg Example in Comic Books

-   In **All Fall Down**, Pronto undergoes this treatment to regain his lost powers and attack Siphon on equal footing.
-   **Astro City**: El Robo of the Astro City Irregulars is a half-human half-robot hero, though he has no visible human parts.

-   **Bazooka Jules**: The family are a group of cyborgs developed by White Sleep Technologies. Each of them is a previously deceased mass murderer whose brain and spinal column are fused with a robot body.
-   **The DCU**:
    -   Cyborg from **Teen Titans**, Robotman (Cliff Steele) from **Doom Patrol**, and the golden age Robotman (Robert Crane) are on the heroic side. On the villainous side, there are the **Superman** foes Brainiac (currently an alien cyborg from the planet Colu), Metallo (a mechanical man with a Kryptonite heart), and Cyborg-Superman (actually a nomadic, technopathic intelligence with the ability to create bodies forged from cloned Superman organs and Kryptonian technology). And also Tharok of the Fatal Five.
    -   Depending on the version, Blue Beetle's scarab is either separate from its host or integrated into its body.
    -   Violet Paige, the protagonist of **Mother Panic**, has internal augmentations that give her Super-Strength. Outwardly, she shows no signs of mechanical enhancements at all.
    -   **Wonder Woman**:
        -   Doctor Cyber has cybernetic implants in the Post-Crisis continuity. This only fits her Post-Crisis self, as her original iteration just wears Powered Armor and her modern **Wonder Woman (Rebirth)** iteration is an AI who was never human to begin with.
        -   Cyborgirl was given life-saving cybernetic implants when she nearly died due to her drug addiction, and she quickly figured out how to use said implants to become a killer for hire.
-   **Global Frequency** deconstructs this, pointing out the extensive and conspicuous modifications it would take to make a real cyborg. It was so hard, in fact, that most people who underwent the procedure had psychotic breaks, and were intended more as non-nuclear WMDs than foot soldiers.

-   **Last Man Standing** has a few of these are running around. The most notable one is Judge, a zombie Psycho Electro Glass Cannon who used to be a Russian soldier before his death while working for Armtech. He got better, and now he's looking to lay down a Roaring Rampage of Revenge against the people who left him to die.
-   **ManTech** is based around this trope, with heroic cyborgs fighting evil robots. The three dying heroes are made into cyborgs to save their lives, their whole bodies being replaced with boxy robotic bits, gaining superpowers in the process. Aquatech hates what has happened to him, Solartech accepts it as a necessity, and Lasertech loves it.
-   The **Marvel Universe**:
    -   Iron Man is a cyborg, but not from his name-inspiring suit of armor. His heart is kept going with cybernetic parts. Later on in the series he becomes a more traditional cyborg with hollow bones full of nanites and the ability to control technology with his mind. Pepper Potts is also now a cyborg.
        -   War Machine got turned into a cyborg around the time of **Civil War (2006)** storyline, but after the whole **Secret Invasion (2008)** storyline was able to get his brain uploaded into a cloned body, turning him back to normal.
        -   The conclusion of **Civil War II** shows a downside to the self-augmentation approach. The final battle ends with Tony in a coma. The Beast tells Carol that he could probably awaken a normal person from this sort of coma no problem, but Tony's modified his body so much that he has no idea where to begin.
    -   Although ROM: Spaceknight volunteered to be made a cyborg, he loathed it and longed to end his war with the Dire Wraiths and regain his humanity. Eventually, he did! Good for him.
    -   Wolverine's adamantium-bonded skeleton may count (which would also include Sabretooth and Bullseye). He definitely counted prior to having his adamantium removed, because his claws were explicitly cybernetic implants in mechanical housings. They were later retconned into being a natural part of his skeletal structure, extended and retracted through muscular action.
    -   Other cyborgs just from the **X-Men** comics alone include Omega Red, Apocalypse, Cable, Lady Deathstrike, Donald Pierce, Cyber, Garrison Kane, Forge, and many more.
    -   The **Spider-Man** comics have Alistair Smythe, Silvermane and Dr. Octopus. Also parodied in the storyline "Revenge of the Sinister Six" when one battle goes horribly awry thanks to Mysterio and Spidey is rescued by Deathlok (himself a cyborg). When Spidey comes to, he finds himself with various gizmos attached to him, including a metal cyborg-like arm. Turns out that they were all state-of-the-art medical equipment (the metal arm being a sophisticated cast) and its working on healing him double time. It ends up freaking out Mary Jane, who smashes Peter's head with a vase when he sneaks in after another fight.
    -   Hank Pym/Ant-Man ends up being this after he ends up in a Fusion Dance with his own wayward creation Ultron in **Rage of Ultron**. There's not much of his original body left — everything below the upper chest is **gone**. Unfortunately, Ultron is able to take control because he is a copy of Hank's own mind who doesn't repress his darker side.
    -   Bucky Barnes/the Winter Soldier from **Captain America** sometimes refers to himself and is referred to by others as a cyborg on account of his mechanical arm, which he can control telepathically when it's detached from him.
    -   Black Widow in **The Ultimates**, rather than being a Badass Normal as is her mainstream counterpart, instead has cybernetic implants.
-   **Max Ride: First Flight**: The Flock's wings are entirely mechanical, built into their spines and capable of folding inside their own bodies for space (unlike in the book series, in which their wings are the result of genetic engineering).

-   **Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)** has Bunnie Rabbot (now Bunnie D'Coolette), a Mobian that got partly roboticized leaving her with three robotic limbs (her left arm and both legs). She eventually gets these parts upgraded, meaning the process could never be undone. As shown by **Sonic Universe's** "30 Years Later" storyline, her and Antoine's children, Jacque and Belle D'Coolette, have inherited this trait. In the same series we have the Dark Legion, whose Machine Worship lifestyle dictates that **all** their members become this. Trademarks include one robotic dreadlock and a chip implanted into a member's brain **at birth** that allows for their memory to be wiped in case of capture or defection. This is particularly disturbing as it has been revealed that instead of executing prisoners, they forcibly "Legionize" them into cyborg soldiers.

Cyborg Example in Fan Works

-   **Becoming a True Invader**:
    -   The Heboadians as a race are all cybernetically enhanced.
    -   Invader Togan has heavily modified himself with cybernetics to increase his natural psychic abilities.
-   **Children of Remnant**: Tyrian has apparently been damaged by training Pyrrha to the point that he's more machine than man.
-   **Crossover Chaos**: Hawkeye Pierce from **M\*A\*S\*H** was turned into this after getting run over by a car. However, as of Agents of C.H.A.O.S, he is no longer this. However, there's a new cyborg character in the fanfic, France from Axis Powers Hetalia who became this after getting big parts of him blasted off.
-   **Dragon Ball Z Abridged**: The misuse of "android" for 17 and 18 is lampshaded. Cell explicitly refers to them as cyborgs and mocks Piccolo for incorrectly calling them androids. The whole "android" thing seems to have started with Goku, who, being the Idiot Hero of the series, keeps mistaking them for androids, despite Trunks calling them cyborgs. In the end, even Trunks slips up and calls them androids, right before killing them in his timeline.
-   **Girl Adventurer**: In order to get Red in fighting condition to go up against the snakemen attacking the Venture Compound, Sarah is forced to turn him into a cyborg.
-   **Halkegenia Online Zero Hour**: Nanami Shirotaka lost all four limbs to a heated cleaver in Laughing Coffin's death game, so she designed a set of robotic limbs she could control via her VR headset.
-   **Hottie 3: The Best Fan Fic in the World**: Carmen Cole is rebuilt into a cyborg after having been killed in the novel **Hottie** by Jonathan Bernstein.
-   **Inferior or Superior**: Many of the Pokemon native to the Cyberos region have evolved to incorporate technology into their bodies.
-   **Kaiju Revolution**: King Caesar and Pulgasari are both stone-age examples. They were originally wounded kaiju located and modified by an advanced Paleolithic civilisation, with the former being given stone armor and the latter metal.

-   **Mega Man: Defender of the Human Race**: Rather than being straight robots from space as in the games, the Stardroids are biomechanical beings.
-   In **Neither a Bird nor a Plane, it's Deku!**, Mei Hatsume is this, giving her the ability to easily survive getting shot through a ceiling and crashing to the floor and shoot Hollywood Acid corrosive enough to burn a ten-foot hole in the floor of a building. She also has Barbie Doll Anatomy, Going Commando because her legs are metallic.
-   **Origins**: Samantha Shepard becomes progressively more mechanical, from Cerberus' reconstruction to having her legs and lower torso smashed into paste requiring a fancy medical capsule followed by even more reconstructive surgery.
-   **Plan 7 of 9 from Outer Space**: In the Zeerust future of Captain Proton, women are getting cybernetic enhancements to compete with Sexbots and Do Anything Robots who are replacing them in the domestic sphere. However, these enhanced women have little patience with taking orders from men and so decide to Take Over the World.
-   **Reading Rainbowverse**: There was a fad for brains from another dimension to turn ponies into cyborgs, including Carapace, Carrot Top, Spotty Record, Cloudchaser, and Star Swirl, thanks to Brainy Twilight and her mad science.
-   **Tails of the Old Republic**: Tails himself is one, by his own choice. He has reinforced bones, organ function monitors/regulators, nanomachines, and a secondary neural network. Considering the hell he goes through, sometimes it's all that keeps him alive.
-   In **To the Stars**, everybody is a cyborg, with implants that allow for VR, telepathy, and even biological immortality.
-   **Uplifted**: Joachim Hoch and his son John Hoch. Joachim loses his arm in combat, his son has his replaced to prove a point about his company's ability to augment humans.
-   **Voice of the Condor**: Late in the story, an Inca priest named Dorad Elo lost his eyes and half of his face when Spanish conquistadors burned his village and stabbed out his eyes for being gay with a foreign man. With the use of Mu technology, he was given a prosthetic orichalcum half-mask, and green optics.

Cyborg Example in Film — Animation

-   In **Mars Express**, many people are able to have the equivalent of vocal conversations without using any visible external device, which they call thought conversations. Aline has Electronic Eyes that grant her several abilities. A killer has a long blade coming out of their arm.
-   **Treasure Planet**: Long John Silver is changed from the "one-legged man" of **Treasure Island** to a cyborg, with the cybernetic equivalents of an eyepatch, hook hand and peg leg.

Cyborg Example in Film — Live-Action

-   In **12:00**, a shadowy NGO, in order to develop Ghana, has the plan to turn a part of the Ghanaian population into cyborgs who act like mobile hospitals, sucking out diseases with machines in their abdomens.
-   **Alita: Battle Angel**: Alita and most of the hunter-warriors and motorball players are cyborgs, along with much of the civilian population of Iron City.
-   In **Army of Darkness**, Ash builds a fully functional artificial hand out of springs and a metal gauntlet. Why? Because he's Ash.
-   I.S.A.A.C. (Intuitive Synthetic Autonomous Assault Commando) from **Cyborg Soldier** is a genetically rebuilt live weapon of human destruction prototype who escapes a military facility bent on super-being creation. The hunt is on for their agents to retrieve robotized-human I.S.A.A.C., who kicks endless butt on his way to an exposé.
-   DC Comics' Cyborg (real name Victor Stone) made his film debut in the **DC Extended Universe**, first as an Early-Bird Cameo in **Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice** as a torso being "rebuilt" by a Mother Box following the accident that crippled him, then in earnest in **Justice League (2017)**.
-   **Elysium**: Max DaCosta, the protagonist, has an older model Exosuit grafted to his body. Kruger has implants on his body to mount technology to, and facial nodes to interface with tech. Near the end of the film, Kruger mounts a high-tech Exosuit on his implants.
-   **Godzilla**:
    -   Gigan from **Godzilla vs. Gigan** is an alien amalgamation of flesh and robotics. It's not entirely clearly where the natural creature ends and the machine begins, except that he has clearly metal claws and spikes and a mechanical buzzsaw on his chest. In the later film **Godzilla: Final Wars**, he's outfitted with rocket engines, a laser beam, and chainsaws in place of his claws.
    -   Mecha-King Ghidorah from **Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah** is a cyborg kaiju from the future sent to the past to fight Godzilla.
-   **Hardcore Henry**: Henry is predominantly mechanical, his original self being a scientist working in augmentation technology who suffered an accident, forcing his wife to install his prototype limbs in Henry to save him. It turns out that this isn't really the case; Henry is the prototype cybernetic Super-Soldier created by Akan, with several more such soldiers waiting in the wings to be given his memories.
-   **Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth**: The Cenobite minions who Pinhead creates are all fused with modern technology. One shoots CD disks from his mechanical head, another has a projectile camera lodged in his skull, et cetera.
-   **Horrorvision**: Sometimes, Horrorvision sends a little centipede-rat robot to Dex's location through nearby screens, and through Dez's phone, to attack him.
-   In **I, Robot**, Detective Spooner is revealed to be one when he uses what turns out to be an Artificial Limb to fight off one of the evil robots. The cybernetic components include his entire left arm and shoulder.
-   **Jason X**: Thanks to being blown apart and a Contrived Coincidence or two, Jason Voorhees becomes a cyborg.
-   **The Last Sentinel**: Tallis and other soldiers from his unit had cybernetic eye implants. The Super Drones appear to be partly biological too, since when the last unmasks he has a face that although inhuman still looks organic.
-   **Marvel Cinematic Universe**: Although Bucky Barnes is never actually referred to as such in canon, he does possess a robotic arm.
-   **Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn**: Baal has a retractable robotic claw arm that shoots green acid, and some kind of voice synthesizer that allows him to talk without moving his lips.
-   **Resident Evil Film Series**: Alice appears to be this, post-**Resident Evil: Apocalypse**, at once point in **Resident Evil: Extinction** being remotely shut down. Nemesis also appears to be some sort of cyborg, with his POV being shown in a blue-tinted robo-vision.
-   RoboCop's body is almost completely mechanical. The only organic parts are his brain, part of his spinal cord, and his face. Murphy's face was peeled off and placed upon a layer of synthetic support as a posthumous honor to the dead cop. The reboot doesn't leave him with much more (hand, lungs), though unlike the original, it also plays up the human aspect, up until it starts becoming inconvenient to the company.
-   In **Star Trek: First Contact**, Data, an android, has organic parts grafted on, to rather disturbing effect.
-   There are many **Star Wars** characters like this, particularly Anakin (who loses an arm and has it replaced with a mechanical prosthetic) who then turns into Darth Vader (both legs, the other arm as well as extensive internal organ damage, particularly the lungs) and Luke (right hand) Skywalker, Lobot (Lando Calrissian's assistant, direct brain-link to the city mainframe), and General Grievous (entire body except brain, heart and lungs).
-   **The Super Inframan**: The titular superhero used to be a human Badass Normal named Rayma, who allows himself to undergo cyborgification to become the Super Inframan in order to defeat an ancient demon monarch and her army of monsters.
-   Terminators are termed cybernetic organisms, though they can survive without the organic parts. Cameron has said his initial concept had the Terminator would depend on its organic parts, to reflect on how society needs machines. That metaphor didn't make it into the movies. The cyborg terminology is correct in this sense: the flesh is a useful part of the whole stealth weapon system.
    -   While the first three films had Terminators that seemingly lacked any organic part aside from the outer layer of flesh, the fourth one had the infiltration Terminator prototype having substantial wetware including a fully organic heart and a mostly organic brain.
    -   The reason why the T-800 who protects Sarah Conner in **Terminator Genisys** looks like a 60+ year old Arnold Schwarzenegger and not the 30-year-old original model? Because he overshot the mark when sent back in time and his organic parts have been aging. Just like human parts do. He's still the same unstoppable combat chassis underneath the aging meat, though.
    -   A better term for the Terminators would probably be "Hybrot" rather than cyborg. A hybrot (**Hybr**id rob**ot**) is essentially a "reverse cyborg", being a robot with living tissue grafted on, often cultured artificially rather than taken from a living organism. The term didn't really exist when the first few movies came out, though.
    -   A few true cyborgs have been introduced in the series:
        -   In **Terminator Salvation** Marcus is a human turned Terminator who still has his original brain, heart, and most of his internal organs encased in a robotic endoskeleton.
        -   In **Terminator Genisys**, the primary antagonistic Terminator is the John Connor of the alternate future timeline who has been transformed into a Terminator that is, in his own words, "I'm not machine, not man... I'm more." John seems to have become a nanomachine colony capable of mimicking his original human appearance and others.
        -   In **Terminator: Dark Fate**, Grace is an 'Augmented' future soldier, with mechanical implants that give her a Robo Cam and allow for impressive strength/durability feats. But given she's still mostly human, at certain points she gets overexerted and requires medicine to recover.
        -   The Expanded Universe **T2 Trilogy** novels feature the Infiltrator 950s, which are genetically modified humans implanted with various subtle neural and subdermal cybernetics, making them predominantly flesh creatures with some machine enhancements, like wireless networking in their brains. This means they can pass as human far better than even the T-800s.
-   Cyborgs are very common in **Upgrade**'s future, to differing degrees. In the criminals' case, they have extensive gun implants, while Grey just has a single chip in his spine, though it lets him do a lot. People mention also that it's unusual to not have any implants.

Cyborg Example in Live-Action TV

-   **Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.**:
    -   Aquila Amador from the episode "Eye Spy" has a cybernetic eye.
    -   Mike Peterson becomes Deathlok after being blown up by Centipede, gaining, among others, a cybernetic eye and a bionic leg.
    -   Agent Garrett turns out to be a Deathlok prototype.
    -   In season 3, Coulson has a robotic hand.
-   **Babylon 5**:
    -   Shadows use machine-fused humans as Wetware CPUs of their ships. Said humans also are capable of taking over common human tech, which was successfully exploited by protagonists in the series.
    -   The episode "Infection" features a piece of Organic Technology capable of fusing with a human and transforming into a biomechanical battle cyborg.
    -   White Stars, ships, utilizing both Minbari and Vorlon tech, may be speculated to be this, though in this case, both 'living' and 'cybernetic' parts are artificial.
    -   The Technomages in the Spin-Off **Crusade** are also cyborgs. This mechanical enhancement is what allows them to do portents that looks like magic.
-   Most if not all Cylons in **Battlestar Galactica (2003)** are cyborgs. The raiders are almost entirely organic on the inside, and the human-forms are ambiguous. On the one hand, they are extremely difficult to tell from humans. On the other, Sharon once accomplished something useful by cutting her hand open and jamming a fiber-optic cable inside. In a later episode it is stated that the human-form Cylons have some sort of organic optical data port in their hands, which is how they control and receive data from the basestars. Presumably Sharon was inserting the fiber so that she could make a good connection to the Galactica's less advanced hardware. On a Basestar, they just stick their hands in the literal datastream. The Centurions are in fact the only ones who are entirely mechanical.
-   **The Book of Boba Fett** introduces the Mods, a Mos Espa gang whose members have enhanced their bodies with cybernetic additions made from droid parts, to the **Star Wars** franchise. It's revealed in a flashback that Boba sought out the Mods' surgeon to save Fennec Shand's life after she was left for dead in her appearance in **The Mandalorian**.
-   **Buffy the Vampire Slayer**: In Season 4, Adam takes this to the next level — he is part human, part machine, and part **demon**.
-   **Class of '09**: In 2034, Poet is equipped with a cybernetic eye to replace her natural one on the left side.
-   **Continuum** has several cyborgs though they use less technology than most.
    -   Kiera Cameron has cybernetic implants in her eyes that give her telescopic, infrared, and night vision capabilities, a "Cellular Memory Review" chip for recording and evaluating information implanted in her brain, and a communications link able to upload and download large amounts of information. When Kiera's CMR is hacked the hackers are even able to take control of her actions. The rest of her abilities come from her suit (which integrates wirelessly with her implants to dramatically improve their overall functionality), her gun, and her multi-tool.
    -   Travis Verta, Chen, and Jaworski are all part of the super soldier program with implanted technology similar to Kiera's. Presumably there are some distinctions since her implants are the "police model" and their implants are the "military model", but this is never really explored in detail the series. (For example, Travis' CMR seemed to generate a slightly different set of capabilities when it was integrated with a CPS suit than Kiera's did -when he wore the suit it generated a shield around his head that could protect him from a point blank head shot while her suit was able to generate a wider, weaker field that deflected bullets in a wider area so that she could protect civilians around her). At the start of the series all of the super soldiers have had their implants turned off. Jaworski and Chen are killed before theirs are turned back on, but Travis has his reactivated and seems to have at least limited access to some of the abilities of his implants. The super soldiers are also extremely strong, fast, and recover quickly but this seems to be based upon biological modifications and the use of special hormones rather than technology.
-   **Doctor Who**:
    -   The Cybermen. The extent to which they're cybernetic varies from story to story; in earlier stories, the Cybermen's biological hands are visible, while in the revived series, they're simply human brains transplanted into robot bodies.
    -   The Daleks are usually assumed at first glance to be robots of some kind, but in actuality, the Dalek itself is a small, squid-like creature piloting the famous mechanical exterior. It's not quite clear how integrated Daleks are into their "suits", so whether they're true cyborgs or simply machine operators is up for debate. Footage and descriptions by other characters imply that the Daleks are most likely somewhere between mecha and cyborgs. The creature proper could exist outside the mechanical shell, but is very small and weak and must be augmented by the mechanical components. In their introduction, Ian Chesterton is able to "drive" a Dalek shell after discarding the creature. The Expanded Universe indicates that the Dalek creatures are so biologically degenerate that they have no functional digestive system, no vocal cords, and even have difficulty breathing on their own; being implanted in their casings is vital for them to survive for any great length of time, and their nervous and circulatory systems are tied directly into the casing's systems. The Dalek voice is harsh and grating because it is entirely artificial. The "New Paradigm" Daleks introduced in "Victory of the Daleks" have an organic eye visible at the end of their eyestalks; this is apparently the eye of the internal creature, with its optic nerve extruded down a metal pipe.
    -   Davros. Right from his first appearance, it's apparent that his chair is also a life support system, and he will die within minutes without it. Since the chair can move without Davros needing to use a joystick or other controls, it's safe to say it's tied into his nervous system in some way, and of course, Davros also has an artificial eye embedded in his forehead. By "The Stolen Earth"/"Journey's End", his one functioning hand had been replaced with a mechanical one capable of shooting electricity from its fingertips.
    -   The fish-people in "The Underwater Menace" are humans fitted with 'plastic gills' and artificial eyes that allow them to see better underwater.
    -   The Master has been turned into one by the Doctor in the non-canon "Scream of the Shalka".
    -   "Voyage of the Damned" has two characters, both spoiler-tagged due to the fact that they live in a society with prejudice against cyborgs.
        -   Bannakaffalatta had an "accident", and his torso appears to be entirely cybernetic.
        -   Max Capricorn is nothing but a head on wheels. He mentions that at over 160 years old, it's to keep him alive.
    -   "Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS" reveals that a character who believes that he's an android is in fact a cyborg who lost his memories in the accident that led to him needing cybernetics implanted, and was then gaslighted by the other crewmembers, apparently out of boredom.
    -   Psi from "Time Heist". The Doctor describes him as having a mainframe in his head, it lets him wipe his own memory, interface with other systems and upload imprints of close to all the greatest bank criminals in existence making him guilty enough to distract the Teller from Clara.
    -   Nardole, secondary companion of Series 10, is rebuilt by the Doctor with a mixture of organic and cybernetic components after being decapitated in "The Husbands of River Song".
-   **Intergalactic**: A device is implanted in Genevieve's head which sprouts prehensile artificial hair she uses as a weapon.
-   **Kamen Rider**:
    -   It's been a while since this was anything like standard, and cyborgs are not a Recurring Element anymore, but the old-school Showa-era Riders were either (a) kidnapped by bad guys and put through Unwilling Roboticisation to serve them, escaped brainwashing, and kicked Monster of the Week butt (literally — RIDER KIIIIIICK!) or (b) were upgraded by good guys to fight the rising evil organization, usually after losing a friend or family member (or several!) to the bad guys. If **Kamen Rider G** doesn't count, the last such Rider (for heroic ones) was Kotaro Minami of **Kamen Rider BLACK** and **Kamen Rider BLACK RX,** in 1988-89, although **Kamen Rider Double**'s Philip is a person made of data who was used by the bad guys to create the Gaia Memories, which is this trope in spirit.
    -   Although Heisei-era **Kamen Rider** franchise discarded this from their recurring elements, Ryoma Sengoku/Kamen Rider Duke, a villain from **Kamen Rider Gaim**, is one straight rare Heisei-era example though this is temporary.
-   **Lab Rats** and its spin-off **Lab Rats: Elite Force**:
    -   The main co-protagonists, Adam, Bree, and Chase, are teenaged cybernetic/bionic superhumans, whom their original creator, Douglas Davenport, intended to use as bionic super-soldiers, to try and sell them off to different countries' governments for profit.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> However, his younger brother and one of the other main deuteragonists of the show, Donald Davenport, and his wife, Tasha Dooley-Davenport, stole them from Douglas and adopted them as their own children in order to raise them in a safer and more normal environment like regular human beings. As they grow older and as they go to high school, he then trains them to use their cybernetic and bionic powers for good, so that they can become a team of superheroes together and learn how to balance their hero lives with their normal, human lives.
    -   Donald's stepson (his wife Tasha's son), Leo Dooley, also becomes a half-bionic superhuman when he's given a bionic arm and leg to treat the near-fatal, mortal injuries he suffered while trying to fight Douglas and his army of bionic superhumans. What's even more interesting is that in **Elite Force**, Douglas actually has a Heel–Face Turn and becomes a **good guy** when he reconciles with his younger brother, Donald, and he actually decides to reform his army of bionic superhumans he created into an elite army of superheroes who can help different countries and law enforcement organizations to fight crime.
-   **Lexx** features some, though given its surrealistic setting, all examples are questionable to some degree.
    -   Common robots in the first season are electronic heads on presumably organic bodies (as they vanish after being struck by weapons that are said to get rid only of organics).
    -   Kai is a mix of decarbonized (i.e., transformed into silicon-based equivalent) flesh and rarely seen mechanical parts (located in his groin and usually hidden under his trousers).
    -   Mantrid, the Big Bad of the second season, is this, firstly being human remnants, supported by advanced tech, and later transloaded into Insect's brain, again, fused with advanced tech.
    -   While not cybernetic per se, Zev is artificially modified.
-   **The Nevers**: Amalia gets attacked by a man who seems to be a steampunk cyborg, as a large part of his body is mechanical.
-   **Pandora**: Pilar has implants which let her enter into the datastream by thought alone. Unfortunately, the implants are hacked at one point, with her body being taken over remotely.
-   The main character of **The Six Million Dollar Man** and his Distaff Counterpart in **The Bionic Woman** were both normal humans who had been horribly injured in accidents, and had both legs and one arm replaced with super-strong mechanical limbs. He also had an Electronic Eye, while she had a super-sensitive artificial ear.

-   **Star Trek**:
    -   The Borg, whose name is shortened from Cyborg to Borg. Seven of Nine from **Star Trek: Voyager**, though she supposedly had most of her Borg implants removed, always has enough left to solve or create the crisis of the week.
    -   In the problematic **Star Trek: The Original Series** episode "Spock's Brain", Spock's brain (naturally) is stored in a jar and replaced by a remote-control receiver.
    -   **Star Trek: The Next Generation** has Geordi LaForge and his VISOR and, later, cybernetic replacement eyes, as well as Picard and his artificial heart.
    -   In the **Star Trek: Deep Space Nine** episode "Life Support", Vedek Bareil is injured in a shuttlecraft accident and, against Dr. Bashir's advice, has parts of his brain replaced by positronic synapses. They don't work as well as the original. They also can only keep him alive temporarily, as the brain damage was too extensive. The only thing left that could've been tried was replacing **all** of Bareil's brain with cybernetics, which was rejected for obvious reasons.
    -   **Star Trek: Discovery** has Lieutenant Commander Airiam (extensive full-body augmentation following a shuttle crash with at least partial brain replacement) and Lieutenant Detmer (artificial eye and some cranial implants following an injury in the pilot two-parter).
-   **The Twilight Zone (1985)**: In "Father & Son Game", over 50% of Darius Stephens' new body consists of machinery. Almost all of his major organs, including his brain, are artificial. This creates problems for Darius as there is no legal precedent for a person with an artificial brain to be considered alive.
-   **Ultraseven**: In the Grand Finale, Seven battles the two-faced monster Pandon and (barely) defeats it in the first round of combat by chopping off An Arm and a Leg. As a result, Pandon is given cybernetic limbs by its alien masters the Ghose, and rechristened Reconstructed Pandon, who proves to be an even more formidable foe for the slowly dying Ultraseven.
-   **The Wild Wild West**: Colonel "Iron Man" Torres is a 19th century version of this in "The Night of the Steel Assassin".
-   **War of the Worlds (2019)**: The killer robots the aliens sent to wipe out surviving humans are revealed as having organic interiors, with some nervous system driving them. In the finale, we learn humans are being made into cyborgs by the aliens too.
-   **Years and Years**: Bethany wants to become one, and eventually she gets her wish, getting implants placed in her hand that let her access the Internet remotely. It's only the start of her transhuman ambitions.

Cyborg Example in Music

Cyborg Example in Pinball

-   **Iron Maiden**: The women are implied to be this, using thick metal cables and connectors in their hips to interface with a gigantic metal structure.
-   **Iron Maiden: Legacy of the Beast** has a multiball themed after a cyborg version of Eddie, the band's mascot. Fittingly, the display during the mode partially pulls its aesthetic from old computer systems, unlike the rest of the game.

Cyborg Example in Professional Wrestling

-   John Cena/The Prototype's gimmick in Ultimate Pro Wrestling, though he left in 2001 to later return in 2003 as a thug out to get Frankie "The Future" Kazarian.
-   Cibernético, the resident cyborg of the Universal Wrestling Association gym in Mexico. In AAA, he would introduce a "Death Cyborg" or Muerte Cibernética in his efforts to defeat La Parka Jr.

Cyborg Example in Radio

-   Spoofed with the Kenny Everett character Captain Kremmen, who has bionic veins and a bionic left foot with a detachable big toe that converts into a space cannon.

---
Cyborg Example in Roleplay

-   **Dino Attack RPG** has a player character named Dr. Cyborg, and the Non-Primary Characters General and Frozeen. There is also a cybernetic mutant **T. rex** named Cyrista's Bane.

---
Cyborg Example in Tabletop Games

-   **Anima: Beyond Fantasy**: High Arbiter Arkeid — actually a Sylvain (light elf), not a human. Few details, however, are given on what her implants are.
-   **BattleTech**: Implants and augments are available. They range from basic replacement limbs for crippled veterans to full-body musculature replacement with sub-dermal armor plating. The more extreme replacements are often only available to government operatives, and typically come with a host of horrible side effects like the aforementioned muscles requiring surgery whenever damaged and constant painkiller usage. The genocidal Word of Blake invested heavily in cybernetics, and the invading Clans likewise had a fondness for overt replacement cybernetics without the usual faux-flesh, further stigmatizing cyborgs.
-   **Bleak World** has the Cyborg class of the Aliens race. It has little to no infiltration ability (at its highest it can roll 1d10 on sneak checks). But they have very highcombat and science abilities, making them more useful for small scale skirmish and retrieval games. There is also The Android class of the experiment race, which was created by a Mad Scientist using the bodies of dead teenagers and cybernetic implants.
-   **d20 Modern**: The supplement **d20 Future** has some coverage of this topic, and **Cyberscape** expands on it. **Cyberscape** also adds alternate cybernetics, including Golemtech and Necrotic Implants (Golem\- and Necromancy\-based cybernetics, respectively), for a Magitek twist on the cyborg.
-   **Deadlands: Hell on Earth** subverts, inverts, reverts, and blipverts the trope. Basically, in the universe it's impossible to make enough room in a human body to insert any relevant cybernetics. However, there is plenty of room in an undead body since the undead don't need any bits other than the brain anyway. This has the added advantage that with a bit of Mad Science jiggery-pokery you can run the machine parts on the spiritual energies used to create the undead.
-   **Deviant: The Renegades**: Invasives are Deviants who were fused with non-living material. The archetypes examples of these are enhanced with a variety of visibly mechanical parts, such as robot limbs, bound swarms of nanotech, or silicon circuits wired into their brains, nerves or eyes.
-   **Eclipse Phase**: Basically everyone, apart from the comparatively few flats in the Jovian Republic, has some sort of cybernetic enhancement, even if it's only a basic mesh insert
-   **Exalted** has these in the Alchemicals sourcebook. Any Alchemical with an Obvious charm qualifies, as well as many that don't.
-   **Fading Suns** has the option to outfit characters with cybernetic parts. What makes it interesting is that the available enhancements run the full technological spectrum, from simple metal and ceramic limb replacements, to synthetic flesh, to nanobots.
-   **Heroes Unlimited** has Bionics as a superpower type, though in this timeframe it's an emerging technology and extremely expensive (though available to the public).
-   **Iron Kingdoms** has Magitek cybernetics used by the Cryx, which are made of machinery and dead tissue, making all manner of cyborg undead; and their sometime-allies the Cephalyx, who won't wait for you to die, and have perfected their implants to enhance and mind-control their living captives, as well as equipping them for combat. There are others, including a massive farrow beast which is basically a steam-powered borg whose designer had some trouble getting anything other than pulled pork out of the experimental process.
-   **Mage: The Ascension** includes Iteration X, "mages" who can do impossible things with cybernetics and robotics. Besides generally being cyborgs themselves, they frequently make use of HIT Marks against their enemies. Occasionally other science-focused mages, even in the Traditions, also create cyborgs. The degree to which Cybernetics Eat Your Soul varies with the amount of replacement and the manner in which your storyteller enforces the Resonance and Paradox rules. As a nice nod to reality, people with any kind of cybernetic enhancements have to get a full-body reinforcement.
-   **Magic: The Gathering**:
    -   Upon birth, the denizens of Phyrexia are immediately gutted with most of their body parts replaced with mechanical ones. Even the robots they build themselves contain organic components. Someone dissecting one of their artifact creatures pointed out: "its as though someone started out with a living thing, and then replaced bits piecemeal until there was nothing of the original left."
    -   The denizens of the Esper shard of the Alara plane use a metallic substance with numerous useful properties called etherium in making themselves human/mechanical hybrids.
    -   The **Unstable** joke set introduces a proper cyborg type. Its represented by the Order of the Widget, a group of well-intentioned but clearly insane artificers who replace body parts to function better. Its founder started this because he wanted a toaster.
-   **Malifaux** has steam-powered cyborgs working with one faction.
-   **New Horizon** has the Prometheans. Oddly, the cybernetic enhancements are stated to be tailor-made to an individual's biochemistry, preventing both interchangeable prosthetics and cybernetic enhancement to the genetically altered Medeans. Hmm.
-   **Paranoia**: Humans in the robot-loving Corpore Metal secret society often get cybernetic replacements. Inverted by Corporganic, whose robotic members sometimes get organic replacements ("orgcybing").
-   **Pathfinder** is mostly set in a standard medieval fantasy world, but it veers into Science Fantasy in the high-tech nation of Numeria. Some of the more wealthy and powerful denizens are likely to have cybernetic upgrades.
-   **Rifts** splits these into several classifications: Cybernetics are basic mechanical prosthetics and implants (which come in fully mechanical or Bio-Systems), while Bionics actually augment the user to combat-capable levels, and include weapons. Cyborgs come in three levels: Minor cybernetic/bionic enhancements, Partial Conversion (all limbs and some torso reinforcement) and Full Conversion (Entire body except for the brain and spinal column).
-   **Shadowrun**: Cybernetics, called cyberware, are near-omnipresent in the setting. Consumer cybernetics for civilians run the gamut from cybereyes to full limb replacements to replacing most of your chest with cybernetics, and military cyberware grants superhuman strength, speed and endurance. With the exception of the brain and some internal organs, every part of the body can be replaced with cybernetics, but the Essence limit puts a hard cap on how many implants a single body can handle. Practically all shadowrunners that aren't dabbling in magic get at least some cyberware, making almost every player character and most NPCs a cyborg by default. By the 2070s cyberware is getting replaced by bioware in some sectors (especially in prosthetics), but cyberware is still cheaper and has a few options that simply cannot be replicated by biological implants.
-   **Warhammer 40,000**: Cybernetics factor heavily into the fluff:
    -   The most prevalent example is the Adeptus Mechanicus (and their Chaotic counterparts, the Dark Mechanicus). Mechanicus dogma shuns the weakness of the flesh and encourages its members to increasingly replace their organic parts with cybernetics to become closer to the Omnissiah, to the point that it's almost impossible to tell if there's anything organic left.
    -   Servitors, cybernetic automatons used in all aspects of Imperial function, from scribes to maintenance workers to gun platforms. Their personalities and higher mental functions are completely wiped and their bodies are cybernetically rebuilt to whatever function they are meant for. They are usually vat-grown, but criminals, heretics, and failed Space Marine candidates can also face servitor conversion. The Imperium considers fully artificial AI heresy of the highest order, and requires all robotic lackeys of relatively high sophistication to be biologically human, supplemented by cybernetic augmentation. This taboo on A.I. (which stands for "Abominable Intelligence") stems from the Robot War that helped bring in the Age of Strife tens of thousands of years in the past.
    -   Space Marines handle this in a number of different ways:
        -   The Black Carapace implant, universal to all Space Marines, is a subdermal plastic sheath that neurally interfaces a Marine with his armor.
        -   Space Marines commonly get cybernetic replacements for limbs, eyes, organs, etc. that are lost in battle.
        -   Dreadnoughts, heavily armed bipedal mecha which house Marines too physically broken for baseline combat but too strong-spirited to die, secured inside a life-support sarcophagus which is hooked up to the Dreadnought body's motive systems.
        -   The Space Wolves make use of animals such as ravens and giant wolves, partly cyborged to make them more powerful and dangerous.
        -   The Iron Hands chapter shares the Mechanicus' belief in the superority of cybernetics. Initiates replace one hand with a bionic and continue to add parts as they go. The Iron Hands were inspired by their Primarch Ferrus Manus. Ferrus Manus once fought and defeated a strange silver metallic dragon by dunking it into lava. The dragon's skin bonded to his arms. Manus' arms gave him the ability to forge weapons by simply beating them into shape. Ironically, Manus himself did not believe the Iron Hands should replace their flesh with machinery. He intended to remove the metal from his arms to convince the Iron Hands to let go of their obsession with cybernetics, but died before he had the chance.
    -   The Necrons appear fully robotic at first glance, but are actually full-body cyborgs created from a long-extinct alien race. However, **Devourer** reveals that some of them are actually robots programmed with the thought patterns of long dead Necrontyr.
    -   Eldar Wraith technology is somewhat similar to the Necron example in that once-living souls are grafted into completely artificial bodies.
    -   Orks make extensive use of cybernetics, partly to make themselves tougher and partly because their combat-heavy lifestyles tend to cost them limbs and eyes more often than not; individuals with extensive cybernetic implants are called cyborks. Due to their extremely tough physiology, they can survive having extremely crude and improbable cybernetics added (and in one instance, replacing a large portion of their brain). Also, some Ork tribes make use of gigantic boars, some of which are cybernetically modified into, you guessed it, cyboars.
-   **Warhammer Fantasy**: Ghoritch's Rat Ogre body is heavily agumented with warpstone-powered mechanical components, most notably a pair of piston-driven claws replacing his hands.
-   **Yu-Gi-Oh!** has quite a few monsters that qualify, the most obvious being Cyborg Doctor. Others include Nanobreaker (who is based on Jake, the protagonist of a Konami video game with the same name as the card), Battle Footballer (as seen by its card text), and maybe D.D. Warrior Lady, who seems to have at least a bionic arm, and maybe a few other cybernetics.

Cyborg Example in Web Animation

-   **Dreamscape**:
    -   Betty is a cyborg from the waist down, as a result of one of Melinda's Mooks crushing her legs with a pillar.
    -   CHEN is a cyborg **chameleon!**
-   **Helluva Boss**: Even though the clown Fizzarolli was just a regular imp growing up, by the time of the series, not only are there robotic replicas of him, but his real body seems a lot like those robots too — he's at least got extendable mechanical arms and legs after having been caught in an explosion and a fire that destroyed a lot of his body.
-   **Inferno Cop**: The titular character gets turned into a cyborg by Southern Cross. It gives him the power to turn into a car and travel back in time.
-   **Mani Mani People**: Alisa lost her arms and legs in a truck accident. A company later contacted her, and they were replaced with cyborg parts.
-   **Meta Runner**: The namesakes of the show’s title, Meta Runners are professional gamers who’ve replaced their arms with robotic limbs designed to enhance their skills and performance.

-   **RWBY**: General James Ironwood, a character loosely based on the Tin Man. While it initially seems that only his right arm has been replaced, Clothing Damage during the Volume 3 finale reveals that the entire right half of his body is mechanical. He is a major supporter of his kingdom's technological research, and provides Yang with a custom-made replacement after she loses her right arm in battle.

Cyborg Example in Webcomics

-   **Among the Chosen** has secondary cyborg characters Tantek and Xand, as well as a host of minor ones, though it tends to blur the line between this and Bio-Augmentation.
-   **Autumn Bay**: In the Bad Future, Dr. Deacon has a number of cybernetic enhancements.
-   **A Beginner's Guide to the End of the Universe**: The Everyman's two companions, Snuffy the pooch and Chairman Jack the giant sparrow, gradually become more and more extensively cyborgs as their COMPLEXITY increases and the Everyman fuses them with gears, weapons and mechanical components (with his Reality Warper powers).
-   In **Bicycle Boy**, the story follows a mysterious cyborg named Poet. About 70% of his body is mechanical, excluding his head and part of his torso.
-   **Bob and George**: Mike has half his body replaced with robotic parts. Typically, he wonders whether he's robotic or a freeloader.
-   **Cassiopeia Quinn**: Cyborgs are very common in the setting, ranging from people with comparatively minor augmentations (such as Katya Kreuz's mechanical limbs) to much more heavily modified ones (such as Dr. Botz and her bevy of augmentations) to full-conversion 'borgs with only minor organic components left (such as Zeke, who's down to a mostly organic brain in a fully robotic body, and Motor Minx, who has a partly organic head and is entirely mechanical from the neck down).
-   **Commander Kitty**: Nin Wah, a red panda with a cybernetic arm that can convert into an Arm Cannon.
-   In **Cwynhild's Loom**, Cwynhild is a cybernetically enhanced human, though her enhancements are mostly internal and not visible to the naked eye.
-   **Dresden Codak**: Kimiko Ross cyborgified herself after having received very severe injuries during the **Hob** Story Arc.
-   **Enemy Quest**: The alien Floaters are an entire species of these. They all possess some form of rocket-propelled flight, some have weaponry mounted on their bodies, and there is an array of various other augmentations for Floaters to be equipped with. As every Floater is a clone and created for a specific task, individual augmentations tend to vary.
-   **Harkovast**: Shogun has a mechanical hand that can crush metal. How this was constructed using the medieval technology levels of Harkovast has yet to be explained.
-   **Heroes Unite**: Bombshell has a cybernetic arm.
-   **Homestuck**:
    -   Vriska gets a robotic arm (also made by Equius) after her original one gets blown off. Aradia may be an additional case, as she spends a good part of the plot as a ghost-sprite inhabiting a realistic robot (again, made by Equius).
    -   After Tavros was confined to a wheelchair due to Killer Game Master Vriska, Kanaya sawed off his legs while he was sleeping so Equius could fit him with newly-built robot legs instead. In the Dream Bubbles, a number of ghosts show that his previous universe counterpart Rufioh went through a similar process in some timelines — except that his case involved his head being grafted onto a mechanical horse body; all those instances of Rufioh seem to hate their life as a result.

-   **The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!**: The giantess Djali ("Jolly") is given cybernetic parts to help her move and respirate at a size that would otherwise run up against the Square-Cube Law. Since the Nemesites explicitly have technology to reduce an object's mass and to manipulate gravity, this isn't too unreasonable.
-   **Last Res0rt**: Daisy Archanis has a potent prosthetic leg... that's detachable (presumably for upgrades). It helps her about as often as it hurts her.
-   **Monsterful**: Michelle Flammel can transform into a PHC (Psychotic Homunculus Cyborg) by fusing with her guardian golem Ourox, Gaining tons of gadgets, from the classic Arm Cannon, to Jetpacks and more.
-   **Not a Villain**: The Dude refers to Kleya as one. When we see her in Reality, she does appear to have metal implants in her spine and the back of her hands.
-   **The Petri Dish** features Bob who is mainly a robot but has a brain, digestive system, and urinary system, Irene who is another robot with a brain, and iBall who is a robot with a whale's eye.
-   Several characters in **Schlock Mercenary**:
    -   Company chef Ch'vorthq after sacrificing his own limbs got cybernetic replacements that were originally being used by Der Trihs.
    -   Elf was going in oversized, armored "Odin Boots" when her legs got blown off before eventually getting them regrown.
    -   One of the background members of the company is a member of a species who has one mind occupying two bodies connected by an organic radio link who has a hypercomm node installed to extend his range, allowing him to pilot two tanks at once.
    -   The most stand-out example would be DoytHaban, a mercenary who has an extensive upgrade system, including the Haban AI.
    -   Haban II is an... odd example. Originally just a gate clone of DoytHaban, he got shot in the head, killing Doyt but leaving the Haban AI unaffected. Medical technology allowed the missing brain tissue to be regrown but as a blank slate, allowing Haban to... move in.
    -   Also, "common" soldier boosts got some parts interfaced to the user's brain.
        
        **Kathryn:** That's **terrifying**.  
        **Ennesby:** It's **awesome!** It makes you meat-sacks a lot more like me.  
        **Kathryn:** That's what I just said.
        
-   **Sidekicks** gives us Metaroid and Goldrush. The former gets humiliated by the protagonist twice, despite getting an upgrade, and the latter is a mechanical creature made entirely of 24k gold (his only organic part is his brain). In season 2 we have Alex from the "Alex Project". The cyborgs from the Alex line are special in that they also possess superpowers.
-   **Sluggy Freelance**:
    -   This shows up as part of a Borg parody. Riff and Torg actually become cyborgs for a couple strips, but have all their cybernetic implants taken away when they get kicked out of the Collective.
    -   The Mecha Easter Bunny is created partly based on the original Easter Bunny's DNA, but is only organic on the surface, much like a Terminator.
    -   Dr. Crabtree hasn't got any specific part replaced with cybernetics but is so full of integrated nanites throughout that she is capable of things impossible for humans but would go splat if exposed to an EMP.
-   **Unit-M**: Meteor is part-Monster, part-machine. He can also activate battle armor.
-   **The Water Phoenix King**: The lunar ambassador's bodyguard in Chapter 2 has both arms replaced with densely folded ribbons of razor-edged, thought-controlled metal. It's explicitly described as Magitek and other artifacts of the same sort exist.

Cyborg Example in Web Original

-   **Bosun's Journal**:
    -   The canmen of the corpocaste era are a rather extreme example of this. They are artificially created posthumans grown directly within a tubular cybernetic shell, with no exposed parts except for their flat faces, short arms and a "plug" of flesh at their bases, visible through the shell's open side. Their shells can be plugged into a variety of machines and computer systems, which the canmen can control using mind/machine interfaces through the direct wiring connecting their brains to the shell's own computer systems, and elderly canmen tend to stop even using their biological arms in favor of having mechanical limbs installed on their shells; their digestive systems are also routed through external ports that funnel water and nutrient paste directly into their stomachs and remove waste. They were created to be ideal white-collar workers, capable of working more or less continuously in minimal space — their equivalents of cubicle farms are basically just walls fille with cylindrical sockets — and excel at this job.
    -   The sailbuilders of the sailing era are a species of clones with organic bodies grown within biomechanical ones. A sailbuilder has a tall robotic body, completely vacuum-sealed, with long limbs and a set of transparent domes making up its torso and head sections. Within these, grown into and around the mechanical components, is the organic body: this consists of two ribcages, an outer one modified to serve as a growth trellis for plants that produce oxygen and food for the sailbuilder and an inner one protecting their vital organs, as well as a long neck and arms capable of moving through the entire body cavity, and a secondary, shorter set of arms limited to the rib area.
-   **Orion's Arm**: Present and very diverse, ranging all over the scale of biology-vs-technology.
-   **Pay Me, Bug!**: The Kung are "known for three things: their skill at robotics, their enthusiastic embrace of slavery as a commercial venture, and their tendency to replace parts of their body with machinery."

-   **Whateley Universe**: Plenty. At the Whateley Academy there's She-Bot. One of the Powers Lab teachers has a couple robotic limbs, probably from when he used to be a superhero (although that's just guessed by one of the protagonists). And the dreaded supervillain Deathlist is all robot except for his brain and his face. There is even at least one Cyberpunk style street gang, the Cyber-Tribe (Magical Native American theme firmly placed in the writer's cheek, next to their tongue), wandering around Brooklyn. The general availability of cybernetics (outside of Whateley Academy, that is) seems a bit inconsistent; 'street' cybernetics are about as common as medical-grade prosthetics of comparable ability, if not more so, and can often do things the medical-grade stuff can't. This is probably justified by the fact that most of the unlicensed 'black clinics' and 'black labs' are dealing mainly in Devisor tech, which don't need no steenkin' laws of physics and biology, whereas the more reliable and readily mass-produced Gadgeteer Genius prosthetics which are accepted for medical use are more restricted in what they can accomplish.
-   **Worm**: A number of characters have cybernetics. Defiant/Armsmaster upgrades himself with robotic limbs and a number of other augmentations after suffering severe injuries, Mannequin sealed himself into a puppetlike body, and Bonesaw has given herself a prehensile spine, among other things.

-   **To Boldly Flee**: After her assimilation is broken and she turns human again, The Nostalgia Chick still maintains robotic abilities.

Cyborg Example in Western Animation

-   **Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers**: Technically, all of the lead characters, as they have an experimental cybernetic implant that acts as an Amplifier Artifact. Team leader Zachary Foxx is a more extreme case, having undergone an Emergency Transformation after being gunned down in the pilot episode. Over half his body is replaced by cyberware, including having an Arm Cannon installed.
-   **Adventure Time**:
    -   Finn has a strange tendency to lose his arm in any given time-line, generally receiving a clawed cyborg arm that he seems to function well with. This is first seen in the Farmworld timeline introduced in **The Lich**, where he had a mechanical arm with no explanation. His prior incarnation before the timelines diverged, Shoko had a very similar one, only built by Princess Bubblegum to replace the arm her parents sold to buy a computer. Since then, it's happened twice in the main timeline; thrice if you count pillow-world as part of the main timeline. He made do with a succession of kludgy artificial arms given to him by various princesses the first time, a pillow arm in the pillow world, and then, via a complicated series of events involving a curse and some magic blood, regrew a natural seeming arm, which he later lost when his grass sword became sentient and burst out of his arm. Since then, he's used an intelligent mechanical arm which becomes various tools in response to voice commands. He's also mentioned wanting bionic legs, though this might be a joke. He does seem to avert Cybernetics Will Eat Your Soul quite well.
        -   This is also the most likely explanation of Finn's auto-tune voice, which he supposedly got from swallowing a tiny computer. He sure does seem to be destined to become a cyborg, doesn't he?

-   **Ben 10**: In the pilot of the first series, Vilgax is badly wounded and spends most of the first season in a Healing Vat. He gets impatient and makes himself into a cyborg so he can take the Omnitrix personally, which has the added benefit of making him powerful enough to curb-stomp the fledgling hero. By the time of **Alien Force**, he has fully recovered and ditched the cybernetics.
-   **Centurions**: Doc Terror and Hacker, as well as some of their Evil Minions are all cyborgs. Doc Terror seems to have everything but the left side of his head replaced with mechanical parts, while Hacker has a bit more organic pieces remaining. One episode had Ace require a cybernetic arm and leg after he was badly injured in a fight. This turned out to actually be a ruse to let him join an underground group of ex-military cyborg criminals, at the end of the episode he revealed that he actually wasn't a cyborg, he'd just been wearing fake parts over his undamaged arm and leg.
-   **Challenge of the GoBots**: The title characters are cyborgs of the Brain in a Jar variety, being organic brains installed in Transforming Mecha bodies.
-   **Futurama**: "The Six Million Dollar Mon" has Hermes gradually have his body parts replaced with cybernetics until only his brain is left. Zoidberg collects Hermes' body parts and manages to restore his organic body when his brain is replaced. Unfortunately, the robot brain turns out to be that of Roberto.
-   **Gargoyles** has two recurring villains, Jackal and Hyena, become cyborgs in order to gain new, more deadly abilities. Coldstone is a cyborg as well: a character for whom robotic parts (and magic) were used to join three fragmented Gargoyle corpses (and minds).
-   **Godzilla: The Series** has Cyber-Godzilla, the resurrected form of GINO.
-   **Grojband**: Trina Riffin gets turned into one for a good chunk of "Ahead of our Own Tone" after she was the first guinea pig— er... "Lucky Customer" to try out the new Blab Tab in-brain Implant, which caused her to undergo an Evil Makeover upon getting her brain implanted.
-   **Inspector Gadget**: The Inspector has robotic parts, but several episodes imply that he used to be human. For example, he still has basic human needs such as hunger and sleeping.
-   **Invader Zim**: The Irkens takes this one step further; they are implanted with back-mounted devices known as "paks" immediately following decanting. The pak contains the actual mind of the Irken; their body is essentially only a Meat Puppet used by the pak to interact with its surroundings (a good analogy would be to compare the pak with the hard drive of a computer; the irken's brain is the processor). We also have the more classical mechanical-limbs-and-eye Sergeant Hobo in "Hobo 13", and the Irken Tak, who also sports a cable implanted in her head (which may be the source of her neural suggestion power).
-   In one episode of **Kaeloo**, Olaf turns Stumpy into a cyborg.
-   **Mighty Ducks: The Animated Series**: Dr. Droid (a.k.a. Otto Maton) had most of his body replaced with mechanical parts (Not because he was in an accident, but because he "got a kick out of it").
-   **The New Adventures of Speed Racer**: Professor Tick-Tock is described as half-man half-machine.
-   **Phineas and Ferb**:
    -   The Platyborg from **Phineas and Ferb The Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension** is an evil, brainwashed cyborg Perry from another dimension.
    -   "Tales from the Resistance" includes several Animal Borgs, such as Pandaborg and Chihuahuaborg.
-   **Rick and Morty**: Zig-zagged. According to "The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy", Rick Sanchez's body (or at least the body he currently has) contains a lot of advanced cybernetics. It's never said whether his original body was this, though it'd admittedly explain a lot of his unnatural strength. "Rest and Ricklaxation" resulted in Rick's body being killed off by Toxic Rick, but his quick thinking allowed him to grow a new body out of Toxic Rick himself, which brought him back to full human, but **then** he gets his right arm ripped off in "The ABCs of Beth", but has a replacement robotic arm ready to immediately replace it. Within the same episode, he's already grown back his organic arm.
-   **Roboroach**: Rubin Roach becomes the titular Roboroach after having a bunch of microchips inserted into him, and getting shocked after jumping into an electrical wall outlet.
-   **Robotix**: The heroes are aliens who got their minds transferred into Humongous Mecha without their consent.
-   **Sealab 2021**:
    -   The first episode centers around the cast debating whether they'd turn themselves into cyborgs or not. Quinn is later revealed to be one.
        
        **"Would you put your brain in a robot body?"**
        
    -   A later episode has Murphy and Sparks blackmail Quinn into turning them into a cyborg (sharing one body), with the rest following suit after they get jealous. However, since Quinn is drunk, their bodies...are kind of lame.
    -   The episode centered around the premiere of The Movie has as **Tinfins**'s central premise Quinn turning a shark into a cyborg... and why it's a **bad** idea turning one of nature's predators into a killing machine.
-   **The Secret Files Of The Spy Dogs**: Recurring antagonist feline Catastrophe lost his tail when he ran into a rocking chair factory. He had it replaced with a mechanical prosthesis.
-   **SilverHawks**: The Hawks, as the Theme Song is fond of reminding us, are partly metal, partly real!

-   **Teen Titans (2003)**: Cyborg's body is mostly mechanical but there's still some skin and (presumably) organs in there. His brain is stated to be half grey matter and half CPU.
-   **Transformers**:
    -   **Transformers Generation 1**:
        -   The episode "Autobot Spike" has Spike's mind being transferred to a mechanical body while his human body underwent risky surgery.
        -   Doctor Arkeville. At first, he has **just** a mechanical right hand as well as the upper part of his skull. In the episode "Countdown to Extinction", after he attempts to double-cross Starscream in Cybertron, he is rendered unconscious due to an electric discharge and awakens with half of his body cyborgized and strapped to a mechanical wheelchair.
    -   Nearly every Transformer from the Beast era, which were the opposites of the typical cyborg, being robots who had living tissue grafted onto them.
    -   Seen in the technorganic Blackarachnia, Waspinator and Sari Sumdac in **Transformers: Animated**.
    -   The Headmaster, Powermaster, and Triggermaster characters in both the cartoon and comic books, as the Transformers themselves were now partly organic, but the human or Nebulan character they'd bonded to underwent extensive cybernetic implants as part of the bonding process.
-   **Voltron: The Third Dimension**: During a climactic battle prior to the start of the series, Lotor was badly injured and had to be rebuilt as a cyborg.

Cyborg Example in Real Life

-   Pacemakers. Cochlear implants. Hearing aids. Bionic eyes. Artifical arms. Dentures. Joint replacements. The age of cyborgs is already upon us! Repent!
    -   Bone-anchored hearing aids have existed for decades now, too, although they're quite expensive, a bit exotic compared to ordinary hearing aids and cochlear implants, and come with a few (usually easily mitigated) complications. Essentially, a titanium implant is surgically affixed to part of the bone that comprises the human skull and linked to an abutment embedded in the soft skin tissue; the whole arrangement is strategically placed, such that an electronic device that posts to the abutment picks up sound and transmits it through the implant and the bone directly to the inner ear organs — which makes it possible for people deaf in at least one ear (due to either conductive, congenital, or unilateral hearing loss) to hear sound on that side.
    -   Glasses/Corrective lenses and contacts lenses
    -   If we included purely mechanical aids, this trope is Older Than Feudalism, if not Older Than Dirt.
    -   In the broadest sense, even **clothes** probably qualify, as artificial "skin" that improves upon our own flimsy human integument. And artificial hands too, if they have pockets.
-   The Hybrot: one thousand rat neurons on a circuitboard remotely controlling a small robot. Now that's good biology. **Warhammer 40,000** here we come.
-   Stephen Hawking and Kevin Warwick. The former depended on cybernetics to move and communicate because of his disease. The latter is a cybernetics researcher who interfaced his nervous system with computers to remotely control his home, operate a robotic arm, and telepathically communicate with his wife just to demonstrate the technology's Potential Applications (and probably also For the Lulz).
-   Meet Rob Spence, The Eyeborg. after an accident with a shotgun that resulted in his right eye being completely destroyed, he had said eye replaced with a camera that can actually track his vision and transmit video to a handheld receiver. He was actually hired by Square Enix to host a promotional documentary for Deus Ex: Human Revolution, showcasing several real-life people with advanced prosthetics, as well as talking about their future development. It was actually the second offer that he got because of that. The first was that Intelligence and Documentary services wanted him to go to the Middle East as he would have a camera that no one could spot and so could film things that no one else could.
-   North Carolina State University have created and demonstrated cyborg cockroaches. The roaches are remote controlled through a lightweight wireless receiver attached to the roach's antennae and cerci, sending signals that trick the roach into thinking it is avoiding an obstacle or a predator, in essence "herding" it with a surprising degree of accuracy. The planned applications include using them to find disaster survivors trapped in rubble or damaged structures. The Robo Roach, developed by Backyard Brains, is the world's first commercially available cyborg cockroach kit. It uses a smartphone as the controller to remote control cockroaches attached with a wireless receiver.
-   The CIA once attempted to deploy a cat rigged with a surgically-implanted bugging device to listen in on Soviet diplomats' park bench conversations. The project failed when the world's only cyborg spy-cat was hit by a car on its first "mission".
-   Meet Freddy, the cyborg tortoise.
