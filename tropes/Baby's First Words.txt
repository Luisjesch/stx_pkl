Baby's First Words: 
_"Anyway, Simon and I have this little bet on what her first word will be. Simon thinks it will be 'Dad'. But I know it's going to be 'Mum'. Isn't it, Molly? Mum, mum, mum."_

Unless somebody is mute, there comes a time when everybody says their first word. Sometimes, this is as young as six months, other times it's as old as two, and sometimes even older in people with certain disabilities and (in some, but by no means all cases) with autistic people. But anyway, this trope covers a baby saying their first word in fiction.

Sometimes, the whole plot is about the family trying to get the baby to talk, other times it only takes one scene, and other times, a Flash Back to a character being a baby and saying their first word happens.

When Played for Laughs, common gags include the baby not talking until the parents give up and _then_ they say their first word, the baby's first word being a ridiculously big word for a baby, the first word having to do with something they really like (for example, a Big Eater having "dinner" as their first word), the first word being rude (for example, a swear word, an insult, or a minorly impolite word such as "poop"), the baby's first word stemming from them copying another character's catchphrase, and the baby becoming 100% verbal after saying their first word.

Commonly, the people will be trying to get the baby to say their name or their position in the family (for example the mother trying to get the baby to say "mommy"), and this may lead to arguments between the parents over whether the baby's first word will be "mommy" or "daddy".

If the baby does say "mommy", "daddy" or a person's name as their first word, it might lead to an emotional (as in making you cry happy tears) moment.

If somebody could talk all along but they never do up until now, that's Suddenly Speaking. If they become verbal extremely fast, it's a good bet they're a Brainy Baby. Can overlap with Early Personality Signs.
