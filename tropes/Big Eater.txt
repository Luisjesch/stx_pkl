Big Eater: 
That's just the appetizer!

_"This... this girl's stomach is a Cosmos unto itself! It's connected to the void of the universe!"_

Characters, who may or may not be fat, but either way regularly eat enough for an entire football team, often devastating the whole table — and sometimes entire restaurants — in their insatiable hunger. They often use a speed-eating technique that makes food seem to vanish spontaneously from the plate. Primarily a comedy trope, a common sight gag with these kinds of characters in cartoons or anime is having piles upon piles of plates and bowls stack up as the character chows down. Cut a Slice, Take the Rest is a common joke involving this type of character, as is I'll Take Two Beers Too.

Extreme Omnivores and people with eating related powers tend to be Big Eaters by default. Large characters, such as the Big Fun and Boisterous Bruiser, tend to be this trope. In fact, the Fat Comic Relief is almost always a Big Eater. However, Big Eaters who remain thin despite their habits are considered the best examples.

Don't interrupt a Big Eater's meal, or worse, try to steal their food, as this is a very good way to piss the character off...

Although it's often Played for Laughs, serious examples and deconstructions are known to exist. For example, a Big Eater may be suffering from bulimia or overindulging as a symptom of deeper emotional problems.

Characterization-wise, it can also be used to fulfill the needs of many Required Secondary Powers, adding depth to a trait commonly dismissed as a comedic quirk and make a character's abilities more believable. Characters with a Healing Factor, Super-Speed, or the ability to change shape and size don't have to flout the laws of physics, they can simply explain that the extra mass and energy come from their over the top eating binges. Magic users in general can use this trope and say that they cast from their calories, which would explain why mages are often rather thin characters (though obese wizards aren't unheard of).

In action series, this is often a trait belonging to the Kid Hero, Boisterous Bruiser or other types of high-energy characters. Because many wild animals exhibit this in real life it's also a popular trait for Wild Child and Raised by Wolves characters.

In comics and manga it's common to make a Comically Serious character or badass a Big Eater as a way to add a humorous quirk that doesn't take away from the character's seriousness. A common justification for a female big eater is that all the fat goes straight to her breasts. Consequently, female characters with big boobs are often big eaters. Occasionally they have Bizarre Taste in Food or are Obsessed with Food when not eating.

Truth in Television, though without proper exercise it can lead to obesity. People with higher metabolisms are better able to avoid weight problems caused by overeating and teenagers are known for being able to eat amounts of food that will make them fat if they continue to eat like that in their 20s and beyond. Vegetarians and vegans can come off as this because vegetable matter doesn't contain a lot of calories, so they often have to eat larger portions of food in order to get enough calories. Most wild animals need to be this because they usually have no idea when or where their next meal will be, especially in harsh environments like deserts or polar regions.

See Extreme Omnivore for when someone doesn't limit themselves to things usually considered food. If two Big Eaters are pitted against each other, it's an Eating Contest. For a villain that has this as their biggest vice (especially an obese villain), see Villainous Glutton. Players can invoke this trope in any video game where the characters have a Hyperactive Metabolism and eat food to heal their injuries. If a Big Eater tries to gain weight, it's a case of Intentional Weight Gain. Compare Really Fond of Sleeping, which has a similar attitude toward sleeping and also are themselves likely to be a Big Eater. Characters like this may have a Delicious Daydream or sing an Ode to Food.

Don't expect the question of how exactly they manage to compact so much material into the space of a human stomach to be addressed.

He's so well known for it that his name has entered the dictionary meaning "a thick sandwich filled with a variety of meats, cheeses, dressings, and condiments", and he's the Trope Namer for that type of sandwich. It's also a popular name for sandwich shops in the midwest.

-   Peter and Roger from **FoxTrot**; while Peter does this year-round (even eating groceries before his mother has gotten them to the parking lot of the store), he and his father really shine on Thanksgiving. This is often exaggerated as he's shown to be very heavy despite the similar body shape.
    -   Daughter Paige has her moments of this when candy or other sweets are involved. This is shown when the ice cream man comes running at the sound of **her** bell.
-   Jeremy in **Zits**. Truth in Television, as anyone who knows teenaged boys can assert. Add in his friends Pierce (also thin) and Hector (on the bigger side), and they need a pizza that requires a forklift to transport, and drive all you can eat buffets to close early or make it 21 and over.
-   Sergeants Orville Snorkel and Louise Lugg from **Beetle Bailey**. He's usually specifically excluded from local "all you can eat" offers, and together they need a table for four at a restaurant, as well as being fond of other variations of I'll Take Two Beers Too. One time Beetle comments that Sergeant Snorkel must be adhering to his diet because everyone else received an extra helping of food recently.
-   Fat Bastard hitman Oodles from **Dick Tracy**.
-   Subject of a couple of gags in **The Far Side**, such as the owner of an "All You Can Eat" buffet watching a towering block of a man coming in through the front door; it's not just that he's huge, but he has a mouth about a foot wide.

    Several liters of cream soda and a dozen deviled eggs.**

    Then you had something really awful,  
    Four kippered herrings on a waffle,

Somewhat justified in that it's an Earth spirit and believes it's cleaning up trash, but it considers almost anything trash (cameras, clothing, cars, you name it). More mundanely are Chell and Sid, notably when they arrive at the Fall Festival and declare their intent to eat their weight in fried dough. Chel's player Jake even compares Chel to Rusty from **Oceans Eleven 2001**.
-   Integrity from **Trials & Trebuchets** loves to eat; she always helps herself large quantities of food from the dining hall, and is frequently seen snacking between meals.

    -   Walter and Clay Pigeon may also be an example of this. In one episode, they managed to clean the entire roof by eating up all the popcorn.

-   In **Thunderbirds**, the eldest Tracy son Scott has next to no self-control when it comes to his beloved apple pie.
-   **The Dark Crystal** and **The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance**: Villainous Glutton skekAyuk the Gourmand, the most voracious of the Skeksis. He likes sweet liquors and hot spices, and he boasts to have a different menu for every feast. He's in charge of the Crystal Castle's kitchens and feasts, and cares little for etiquette, possessing few table manners and shamelessly urinating in public.
-   **The Letter People**: If it's not enough that Mister M's sound is "Munching Mouth", his song cements his status this way as he lists foods starting with M that he loves to eat. If that's still not enough, his introductory episode had him at a market, eating foods beginning with M, making a mess.
-   **Sesame Street**: Cookie Monster. "ME WANT COOKIE!!!"
-   **The Adventures of Slim Goodbody**: The Gobbler was an obese mafia-esque villain whose sole purpose in life in his introductory episode seemed to be to eat as much as possible, to the point where he had his henchman hypnotize an entire city's children into losing their appetites so that he could eat all their food!

---
Big Eater Example in Radio

-   "The Stoned Pelican": Mike August, a frequent guest on The Adam Carolla Show, is notorious for never turning down free food, ever, even if he just ate and it's the same thing he just ate (famously once eating a free steak at a live show and then eating another one when Adam took the gang out later).

---
Big Eater Example in Roleplay

-   **Dawn of a New Age: Oldport Blues** has Emmanuel, a Formerly Fat super-speedster who burned off all his weight but kept his healthy appetite — in fact, it's necessary for him to eat lots so that he can regain all the calories he loses speeding around. His introduction has him scoffing down a classroom's worth of cookies after Mirielle drops them.
-   Ronove in **The Gamer's Alliance** eats a lot and always seem to stay hungry no matter how much he has eaten. His favourite foods are strawberry cakes and sand gnome legs.
-   In **Survival of the Fittest**, Reika Ishida is shown to be one of these in pre-game, judging by the fact that when she orders something from A&W she gets a large hamburger meal alongside some chicken all for herself, and **then** snags some of the KFC bucket her sister and a friend are sharing. Note that this is a 4'9 tall and 95 pound teenage girl. Jay Holland also shows tendencies of this when he orders six McDoubles that have fries **inside** them, small cups normally used for condiments to be filled with Oreo McFlurry, four more burgers stacked together, a bunch of milkshakes, a large Pepsi, and coffee at a McDonalds. Though, he does use the justification that he just survived a terrorist attack, so he has the right to get fat.

Big Eater Example in Scripts

-   Terry Munford of DeviantArt's script series, **Chris**.

---
Big Eater Example in Theatre

-   **La Nona**: Played for Drama. La Nona's ginormous food consumption severely strains her family's finances while she herself cares little for the situation. Every few hours, she re-enters the kitchen to demand snacks or meals and is appeased with increasingly smaller portions (what little her family can offer her). Later, she gets married to the owner of a bodega and manages to eat all of the establishment's candies in a month and a half. Her finishing monologue has her alone, as all of her relatives have either died or left, reminiscing about the fantastic meals she enjoyed in her youth.
-   Algernon Moncrieff from Oscar Wilde's play **The Importance of Being Earnest**. In his Establishing Character Moment, he's seen eating the cucumber sandwiches his butler left for his aunt. In fact, it's Lampshaded by the protagonist Jack Worthing on more than one occasion — including his very first line!
-   Little Red Riding Hood from **Into the Woods** is described as being rather plump, and when she's at the Baker's she nearly cleans him out of his bread and sweets. She says it's for her grandmother, but she ends up eating all of the sweets along the way as well as half of a loaf of bread. When she gets eaten by the wolf later on, who just at Granny as well, the narrator laughs and comments that it was a full day of eating for both.
-   Falstaff from Shakespeare's **Henry IV** plays. In addition to being a drunkard, he runs up quite the food bill at Mistress Quickly's.
-   The titular protagonist from **Ubu Roi** attends a banquet his wife cooked up for their various co-conspirators including such delicacies as "tarty-farts", "turkey bum", and "balogna soup".

-   **The Transformers**: G1 Sparkabot Guzzle is described in his bio as having originally been known to his friends for his extremely energy-efficient alt-mode, but after the war broke out he upgraded himself to transform into a powerful tank. This caused his fuel consumption rate to skyrocket by a factor of 100, so he has to consume massive amounts of Energon to stay operational.

---
Big Eater Example in Visual Novels

-   **Ace Attorney**: Maya Fey, who even claims she has separate stomachs for particular foods she likes.
-   Taiga Fujimura and Saber from **Fate/stay night**. Saber has the excuse that food replenishes her mana. Taiga doesn't.
    -   Then again, the guy they hang around with is a Supreme Chef. Who would blame them for wanting some more munchies?
    -   Of course, with the exception of the anime, the amount Saber eats is not that great. Her reputation actually comes from proof of the inverse: implying she's not getting dinner incurs her wrath and one of the most memorable comedic scenes in the game.
    -   Saber's supposed obsession with food is hugely exaggerated in some spinoffs, notably **Carnival Phantasm**.
-   Emma Cee from **Halloween Otome** is known for this to her companions. In fact, her frequent visits to the kitchen grant her a chance conversation with her host.
-   Emi Ibarazaki from **Katawa Shoujo**. At one lunchtime at the rooftop, she brings a lunchbox who is twice as larger as Hisao's and Rin's. Justified as she's the local Passionate Sports Girl, thus does a lot of exercise and burns more calories than most people so she kept her girlish figure.
-   **Marco & the Galaxy Dragon**:
    -   The titular heroines both have big appetites and are easily distracted by the thought of food. In Arco’s case, this is because she’s born from a black hole: she’s **always** hungry, and can clear out all the food on their ship by herself. Other characters quickly figure out that they can bribe Arco (and Marco, to a lesser extent) into doing whatever they want by offering free food.
    -   Gargouille is no slouch in this department either. The local news dubs her "Hydration Girl" after she drinks a public fountain dry.
        
        **Gargouille:** As someone born on the planet of sand, I really longed for a planet with tasty water. It’s been my dream to one day drink a bottle filled up completely with water. **(looking proud of herself)** And now that dream has been fulfilled.
        
-   Momoyo Kawakami from **Majikoi! Love Me Seriously!** is notable for this at times. It gets brought up in the anime several times, and she can clearly put away a lot<small>◊</small>.
-   **Minotaur Hotel**: As if Luke wasn't already a huge American stereotype, he can gobble down whole hamburgers and fries in one bite. How he manages to not get fat is anyone's guess.
-   **Shall We Date?: Ninja Shadow** has Ukyo, the local Fair Cop, who is known for having a huge appetite and a massive Sweet Tooth. i.e., in Kagura's path he takes some of Kagura's sweet dumplings during a talk and without asking, much to the ire of Haru aka the Supreme Chef who made said dumplings for Kagura himself.
-   In **Sickness**, Misa **devours** a bunch of meat while on a picnic with Suoh (leaving him to his dismay with mostly vegetables) and ends up making herself sick.
-   Licia in **Strawberry Vinegar**, especially around rice. However, she learns the limits of her body when she gets sick one morning as the consequence of overindulging for three days straight on human food.
-   In **Virtue's Last Reward**, during the route where Phi goes to the Pantry in Round 2, she apparently spent the whole time eating everything in sight while her teammates did all the work solving the puzzles. She lists off seven different dishes that she ate, and ten later adds an eighth one that she forgot about. Her excuse for her gluttony is that she's a "growing girl"... except she's 20. As Sigma points out, people tend to stop growing before then. However, it's likely that the "growing" she's trying to do isn't related to her height.
-   In **Season of The Sakura**, Meimi and Seia are observed as being this by Shuji when he has dinner with him.

---
Big Eater Example in Web Animation

-   Chocolatey from **Brawl of the Objects**. She loves candy so much, that she could just **burst**.
-   Nikki from **Camp Camp** certainly qualifies. In the opening number of the show, she's shown to have the largest amount of food on her tray, and is shoveling it in with a fork in each hand. And in the episode "Nikki's Last Day on Earth," she clears an ENTIRE TABLE full of food as a "last meal."
-   **DSBT InsaniT**:
    -   Anyone Sushi eats is always Swallowed Whole.
    -   White Killer Eels aren't as voracious as Sushi, but they still have a nasty appetite.
-   Gaston loves to eat throughout **The Gaston Trilogy**, mentioning food at least twice in every single section, with the third being entirely about him trying to obtain Taco Bell.
-   Deandra from **The Most Popular Girls in School**, exhibit A to your right. She eats ****$57.28**** worth of food in her lunch. Her menu there is an Overly Long Gag in itself.
    
    **Deandra:** Can I have a hotdog?... Lemme get some tater tots. Oh, and, also, a slice of pepperoni pizza, and, also a basket of jalapeno poppers, and some chicken nuggets, a ketchup boat, three potato pancakes, a creamsicle, two quesadillas, a bread loaf, side of ranch, some pixie sticks, taco salad, an order of ribs, aaaAnd a Diet Coke\- no. Strawberry shake. No! Diet Coke. NO! Both.
    
    -   Fun Fact: This trope even applies to Carlo Moss (the VA of Deandra) himself. According to a "Live In The Bathroom" livestream video, Lily says that when they went to a buffet, Carlo got **eleven full plates** for **himself.**
-   **Revenge Films**: In this story, a man always orders a lot of food at restaurants and can finish it in one sitting without taking any leftovers, which spikes up his credit card bill due to the humongous meals he eats.
-   **RWBY** has Ruby, a teenage speedster with a a major Sweet Tooth and a killer metabolism, demonstrated in the first episode when she eats an entire plate of cookies offered to her in only a few seconds. She repeats the feat five volumes later with a plate of sandwiches prepared by Jaune's sister Saphron and her wife Terra, scarfing down sandwich after sandwich. There's also Nora, who **inhales** entire pancakes and drinks maple syrup straight from the bottle.
    -   All of the main characters early in Season 3 order bowls of noodles roughly the size of their entire torsos. Blake's also has several huge fish stacked on top of the noodles. Each of them finishes their entire bowl, and have contented expressions like that was **just** enough food to fill them up. Except for Jaune. He looks (and sounds) like he’s about to throw up. Later in Season 5 they cook a giant pot of ramen (specifically meant for a party of several adults) and eat the whole thing themselves. The combination of rigorous Huntsmen training and teenage growth spurts is probably to blame for it.
-   The King of Town from **Homestar Runner**.
    
    **Strong Bad:** I'm looking for disgusting eating records. Why don't you just have lunch? I'm sure you'll set several without even trying.

Big Eater Example in Web Novel

-   **Can You Spare a Quarter?**: Between having undernourished on the street and in the age where boys eat a lot, Jamie consumes a lot of food when he is with Graham. This is not unexpected by Graham, who knows from his neighbours on Valdez Island and their son how much growing up boys eat.

Big Eater Example in Web Videos

-   Like Doug Walker, The Nostalgia Critic seems to live off booze, cereal and junk food but never gets spots or looks fat.
-   The guys from **Epic Meal Time**, who routinely prepare massive dishes with five- (sometimes six-) figure calorie counts and then eat them on camera. What probably helps their frames is that Harley is rather tall and Muscles Glasses (a personal trainer in real life) often hits the gym.
-   Ian and Anthony of **Smosh** both qualify, although Ian seems to be the bigger eater.
-   **Steve 1989 MRE Info**: Some of the rations Steve features include multiple meals, breakfast, lunch and dinner, all of them high calorie and designed to keep soldiers on their feet and he lets nothing that's edible go to waste.
-   Strippin jokingly refers to himself as a food disposal unit, and the premise of one of his challenge videos is to face off against Smiffy from Hat Films in a burger eating contest, with the forfeit being that the loser is slapped with a half-eaten burger. Smiffy wins. It is worth nothing that Strippin gets away with this since he is very well-built and does lots of exercise to counteract this. Since moving to LA in early 2014, this has started to catch up with him.
-   Not exactly thin, but beefy/muscular **Pretty Dudes** character Jay is constantly eating.
-   Turpster, by reputation. Smiffy of Hat Films says that Turps has bought an entire family bucket meal from KFC and eaten all of it, **himself**. He and Turps have a gentleman's agreement that they will, at some point, do an eating challenge.
