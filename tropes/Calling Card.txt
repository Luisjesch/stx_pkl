Calling Card: 
**Lance:** Hey Captain, what's that?  
**Willard:** Death cards.  
**Lance:** What?  
**Willard:** Death cards. Lets Charlie know who did this.

A Calling Card is a piece of evidence or item deliberately left at the scene of a crime to serve as perpetrator's "signature". Sometimes it's a literal playing card or gamepiece left near the scene of the crime, or perhaps the victims are arranged in strange poses.

The term comes from a largely Forgotten Trope from a time before the invention and proliferation of the home telephone. Back then, if you wanted to talk to your friends in real-time, you had to actually talk to them face-to-face. Women had a system where they would stop at each other's homes unannounced, to meet with (usually, though not always) the lady of the house just to chat. Needless to say, there was no guarantee of actually getting to do so at that moment, because she might not have been home. If Alice wanted to visit with ("call on") Betty, but Betty wasn't home, then Alice would leave a "calling card" with her name on it. (Kind of like a modern-day business card, except for personal use.) Like the trope, it was unique to her, and she may have left several of them throughout the neighborhood or town, depending on just how many of her friends she unsuccessfully attempted to call on. She would either leave it in a dish left for this purpose, or if Betty was wealthy enough to have one, leave it with the maid or the butler, and it was expected that Betty would "call on" Alice when she got the chance. When the telephone was invented and came to more and more homes, it simply wasn't necessary to go running around to others' homes _just_ to chat, and thus both "calling" and _literal_ "calling cards" died out.

Actual calling cards are rare in Real Life, because it would make it very easy for the cops to track you down; but in fiction, it seems like _every_ villain has to have one for stamping their achievements with.

Phantom thieves and particularly cocky crooks may even send their calling card _before_ committing the crime, warning their target about what's going to happen. This may be for practical reasons, such as turning the increased security against the target or distracting them by focusing the police's attention elsewhere, or simply as a Badass Boast: if the criminal can pull off their crime even when the target is on highest alert, surely they must be incredibly skilled.

Occasionally, a smart character may even use another villain's calling card to frame them. If the villain is well known, and their calling card shows up before they're introduced in the current continuity, (or if said Villain has been missing or dead for some time), then it's a nice Sequel Hook, or simply a hint of what's to come.

Sometimes, the calling card may be a result of the villain's M.O. (not necessarily a Card-Carrying Villain) or distinctive weapon of choice. One obvious example: vampires always leave their characteristic two-holed neck bite. For people who literally use this trope as a weapon, see Death Dealer.

See also Criminal Mind Games, Idiosyncrazy, Poetic Serial Killer. See Hacked by a Pirate for the computer hacking version.

This has become a Dead Horse Trope in Comic Books, where it was once a staple. A hero may also have a calling card, especially one who typically disappears after stopping the criminals rather than hanging around to discuss things with the police.

For actual calling cards (which a criminal may also leave, although it's a bit obvious), see My Card.

## Examples:

Calling Card Example in Anime & Manga

-   **Cat's Eye** has two different calling cards. The titular girls leave a business card with a stylized cat and the words "Cat's Eye" on it, while the thief Masato Kamiya (nicknamed "The Rat" by the police) leaves a coin mounted on a pendant. Like many Gentleman Thief characters, the girls sometimes send calling cards before the heists: the police squad assigned to capture them has two members with the bad habit of confiding to them their strategies to capture Cat's Eye (and, in one memorable occasion, discussed the strategy **in their coffee house**), and live near their police station enough to use binoculars and lip-read the rare plans the officers won't discuss with the girls.
    -   While Kamiya does it for fun, the girls have a good reason for it: their assumed name as Cat's Eye and them stealing only Michael Heintz's paintings are part of a complicated and desperate attempt to contact their father, Heintz himself, or at least find out if he's still alive, without tipping off the men who tried to kill him and stole his paintings in the first place.
-   The **Death Note** allows its user to not only kill remotely but also control victims' behavior shortly before they die. Light Yagami uses this ability to send a taunting message to L.
    -   He also uses the "default method" of killing with a spontaneous heart attack as a sort of calling card. So that people would know someone was responsible for all the dead criminals. (At one point his game plan was to phase this out, noting that after using this trope to gain the public's attention, he's best served by changing their perception to attribute every death to His divine will, but either he or the narration gets distracted and loses track.)
-   In **Dragon Ball**, when Tambourine is sent by his father Demon King Piccolo to murder martial artists to prevent them from sealing him away, at the site of each murder he would leave a piece of paper with the Japanese symbol for demon near the body.
-   Eroica in **From Eroica with Love** leaves a card with the series title on it.
-   In **Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex**, The Laughing Man had a smiley-face surrounded with a quote from **The Catcher in the Rye**. As it turns out, all the crimes that were marked just by the smiley-face were performed by copycats, but following the J.D. Salinger quote eventually led Section 9 to the real Laughing Man.
-   **Kaitou Saint Tail** examples:
    -   The title character has the habit of sending them to Sympathetic Inspector Antagonist Asuka Jr. before her heists in rather crazy and even spectacular ways, including writing her message on Asuka Jr.'s face while he sleeps or on his towel while he showers, on balloons, and even on an **advertisement blimp**. They hold each other on Worthy Opponent status to the point they actually make The Promise over it, and it eventually becomes the key to their romantic resolution in the final episode/chapter when an Insult Backfire gets Asuka Jr. to realize that they also doubled as love letters, since the fact she kept up with their promise so diligently indicated that she never truly gave up on wanting him to have his goal. Seira's comment in the epilogue about their upcoming marriage being an "eternal" version of their promise indicates that the cards were effectively an allegory for their ability to communicate and take care of each other.
    -   Before falling in love and retiring, Saint Tail's mother was a Phantom Thief, and would sometimes send calling cards just as spectacular as her daughter's (who actually got the idea of the blimp from a news article showing her mother doing the same). Differently from her, she did it only for love of the challenge... and to show up and piss off her rival Rosemary.
-   Spoofed when **Kinnikuman** goes Charlie Brown from Outta Town to disrupt the World Superman Council; part of his disguise is a pair of sunglasses, which he drops after roughing up each of the WSC's district champions. This wasn't drama, however- Kin was just clumsy fleeing the scene. Eventually, he runs out of normal shades and is reduced to using novelty glasses.
-   The titular thief of **Lupin III** often sends calling cards **before** he pulls off his heists. It seems rather foolish, but often his targets' attempts to increase or alter their security end up playing right into one of his Batman Gambits and allow him to accomplish the theft. Also a reference to Arsène Lupin, his grandfather.
    -   Lupin uses two calling cards in **Lupin III: Dead or Alive**. One is in the form of a video where he uses a Parody Name of 20th Century Fox, announcing that he would steal the treasure of Drifting Island. In the other, he uses an advertising balloon to announce his theft of Headhunter's Daughter.
    -   In **Lupin III: Island of Assassins**, Tarantula forges one of Lupin's to get him involved in their plans.
-   This is done by Kaitou KID in **Magic Kaito** and **Case Closed** to announce where, when and what he is going to steal, sometimes in riddle form. That also allows him to know when someone is trying to frame or impersonate him and take steps to stop them.
-   Phantom Thief X from **Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro**, who leaves a "red box" at the crime scenes (actually a clear glass box filled with the liquefied remains of his victims).
-   The titular character from **Mouse** leaves his card, **before** the theft like several other Phantom Thieves.
-   **One Piece**: After the Bellamy Pirates rob the Saruyama Alliance, they paint their Jolly Roger on a nearby tree. This proves to be an incredible **bad** decision; Luffy would quickly track down Bellamy and hammer his head into the street for attacking his friends.
-   In one early episode of **Sonic X**, Rouge the Bat steals a very large diamond... and replaces it with a card with a stylized picture of her on it, along with the words "thank you".

Calling Card Example in Comic Books

-   **Mr. A** has a business card that's half-black and half-white, representing his worldview, that he usually displays before beating up some criminals.
-   **Baker Street**: In "Honour Among Punks", the killer targeting members of the Gothics gang always cuts off a chunk of their hair as an insult.
-   **Batman**:
    -   From The Golden Age of Comic Books through The Bronze Age of Comic Books, most of Batman's Rogues Gallery left calling cards, either explicitly (The Joker's playing cards and the Riddler's conundrums), or in the form of Signature Crimes: Two-Face's crime sprees always revolved around the number two, for instance. This was often Lampshaded; even in The Golden Age of Comic Books, the Riddler's compulsion was flat-out stated to be his downfall. Several stories have shown that the Riddler is psychologically incapable of committing a crime without the riddles, no matter how hard he tries. In the current comics, however, it's a Dead Horse Trope.
    -   The serial killer from **The Long Halloween** would kill on a holiday and leave behind some knickknack related to the date—the press dubs them The Holiday Killer. And in the sequel **Dark Victory**, the next serial killer leaves behind incomplete Hangman games.
    -   The Joker is also famous for leaving victims with a hideous grin on their faces due to Joker Venom (or in one case, carved Glasgow smiles).
    -   Hero example: Batman himself sometimes leaves a card with a bat-symbol next to unconscious thugs.
    -   In the famous "Joker's Millions" story (Which was adapted into an episode of the animated series), Joker, after finding out that most of his "inheritance" is fraudulent, needs to drum up some cash NOW. Of course, he's supposed to have gone straight at this point, so he's forced to perform a mundane burglary, without one of his trademarks. Coincidentally, there's a theater across the street that was playing **Pagliacci** (Y'know, the one about the sad clown?), and a sharp wind blows a poster onto the site of Joker's crime!
-   Black Diamond, from **Black Diamond Western**, has a playing card with the suit of diamond as his calling card.
-   The Penny Murderer, the main villain of **Brody's Ghost**, leaves, of course, a penny on his victims' foreheads. Brody questions why a murderer would leave such a silly calling card, although it's later revealed to have symbolic importance.
-   **Captain America**: The Red Skull used to have two calling cards: his Dust of Death, a poison that made the victim's face turn red and skull-like, and a leitmotif of Chopin's "Death March" which he would arrange to have played when he struck, sometimes in very clever ways. He hasn't used either of these in years, having gone to more subtle evil schemes.
-   The Clock, from **Centaur Publications** and later **Quality**, leaves as his calling card an image of a clock-face over a domino mask along with a message.
-   **Disney Mouse and Duck Comics**:
    -   The Phantom Blot's calling card is an ink blot. He'll usually leave a message with it, but sometimes not — one time Mickey finds himself framed by the Blot, and then notices there is an actual ink blot on his jacket.
    -   Fantomius, being a Gentleman Thief, leaves a **literal** calling card on the site of his heists. He had been planning to leave them since before he became a thief, as when he crossed the line and committed his first heist on the same day he already had a calling card ready.
-   The MAX version of the **Foolkiller** elaborately stages the bodies of those he kills and leaves a "Fool" tarot card at the scene, often with a message.
-   **Hellboy**: Lobster Johnson would burn his symbol, a stylised lobster claw, into his victims' foreheads using the palm of his hand. He also had actual calling cards that he would leave for the police.
-   In **The Incredible Hulk**, Leslie Anne Shappe became a serial killer with the code name "Infinity", and would carve the infinity symbol on her victims. However, an ignorant cop mistook it for "some kind of crazy eight". From then on, she became known to the press as "Crazy Eight".
-   Despite going to some effort to make his murders look like accidents, the killer in **Judge Colt** #4 also leaves an American Civil War medal pinned to the chest of each of his victims.
-   Some of the many serial killers in **Judge Dredd** leave tokens.
    -   One was nicknamed Lefty due to his habit of always leaving his victims' left hands near the scene of the crime. Turns out there was a grisly justification for this: he was attempting to set a record for the number of people killed in a single night, and leaving behind the left hands ensured that all the kills would be credited to him.
    -   Oola Blint took to leaving a black rose with each of her victims after a rash of copycat killings. This detail is never made public, which means the Judges are able to determine which murders were actually done by the Angel of Mercy.
-   Gentleman Thief 'The Rogue' in **The Maze Agency**. His Calling Card is a note informing his victims that their stolen paintings have been selected for his 'Rogue's Gallery' and 'signed' with a cartoon figure (a'la The Saint's haloed stick figure).
-   Mister Midnite, from **Silver Streak Comics**, leaves a watch dial with the hands set at midnight as his calling card.
-   The Golden Age Sandman and Vigilante, both from DC Comics, left poems.
    -   Sandman:
        
        There is no land beyond the law  
        Where tyrants rule with unshakable power!  
        'Tis but a dream from which the evil wake  
        To face their fate, their terrifying hour!"
        
    -   Vigilante:
        
        Some play games for sky-high stakes,  
        And some play penny-ante.  
        But those that gamble with the law,  
        Must pay the Vigilante!
        
-   **Spider-Man**:
    -   Early in Carnage's killing sprees he would write "Carnage Rules!" in his victim's blood near the body.
    -   Spider-Man himself would occasionally leave a note to the police tacked onto a felon he had left webbed and hanging from a streetlamp, signed, "Courtesy of your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man".
-   **The Supergirl-Batgirl Plot**: When Robin and the Batplane disappear, Batman finds a Bat-compact lying on the ground. He quickly deduces it was intentionally left by Batgirl \-in reality, Batmite impersonating Barbara- to taunt him.
-   In **Tomahawk**, Lord Shilling's trademark (and hence his code name) was leaving a single shilling with a hole in the middle after a successful mission.
-   In **Watchmen**, Rorschach's calling card is a piece of paper with a mirrored lowercase letter R written on it.
-   **X (Dark Horse Comics)** would send his targets a photo of themselves with a single diagonal red slash across their face as a warning to mend their ways. If they ignored the warning, they received a second diagonal slash, meaning death.

Calling Card Example in Comic Strips

-   In **Calvin and Hobbes**, when Susie gets smacked in the head with a snowball, she immediately goes to Calvin. She deduces that it was his snowball given the bits of bark, mud, gravel and ice in his mittens.
    
    **Calvin:** The curse of a signature style.
    
-   **Mandrake the Magician**: The Clay Camel would always leave a small clay camel figurine at the scene of a crime, and whenever he escaped capture. His daughter, The Brass Monkey, did a similar thing.
-   **Modesty Blaise**: In "The Grim Joker", the murderous trio leave the words "Ho Ho Ho" on all of their victims.
-   **The Phantom**: The main character has two calling cards, both in the form of rings. He wears a ring with a skull emblem on his right hand, which leaves a permanent skull-imprint on the faces of his enemies when he punches them hard enough, forever branding them as the Phantom's enemies. On his left hand, he wears a ring with a symbol of four 'P's in a circle. By pressing the dye-emitting ring into the hand of an ally, he leaves the four-P emblem as a permanent mark on their skin, a sign to the world that they are protected by the Phantom.

-   **Ace Ventura: Pet Detective** leaves one at the beginning of the film when he rescues a dog from a dognapper.
-   Uncle Eddie of the eponymous murders in **Anamorph** leaves the word "DEAD" on each of his victims. The fact that this doesn't appear in the later murders suggests that it's a copycat killer at work.
-   In **Apocalypse Now**, Colonel Kilgore throws "Death cards" with the emblem of his Air Cavalry Regiment around corpses to let the Vietcong know who killed them. As he complains to his XO, none of the kills are even notable enough to earn a jack.
-   In **Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery**, the Irish killer has his little charm bracelet from which he leaves little trinkets at the scene of each crime. Cue joke: Scotland Yard is "always tryin' to get me Lucky Charms!"
-   In **Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice**, Batman has a habit of leaving a batarang at places he's been, such as the hideout of a human trafficker.
-   In **Beverly Hills Cop II**, the so-called Alphabet Bandit leaves behind cryptic clues that leave the cops scrambling to decode them. In fact, the code was there to confuse the cops while the culprits were busy doing something else.
-   The eponymous **Black Butterfly**, a Robin Hood-esque master thief, who steals from wealthy, corrupt officials, will leave behind hairpins shaped like black butterflies at the site of each theft. Hence how she gets her nickname.

-   In **Death Machines**, three of the eponymous assassins' targets find red Buddha figurines shortly before the Death Machines kill them.
-   Played with in **The Exorcist III**: the police, when reporting the crimes of a Serial Killer, **made up** a calling card in order to weed out people making false confessions - if they said they carved a mark into the victim, they could be dismissed. (The killer's **actual** calling card wasn't revealed to the media for the same reason.) This is an actual method the police use to weed out attention-seekers in high-profile cases.
-   **Fantômas** sometimes left behind his cards (at least in the French movie adaptations).
-   **Golden Swallow**: The expert swordsman and killing machine, Silver Roc, will leave behind swallow-shaped golden darts on the corpses of bandits he killed.
-   In **Home Alone**, the "Wet Bandits" (well, actually just Marv) would leave the water running (after clogging the sink) in the homes they robbed. Harry thinks it's stupid and berates him for it. The trope is deconstructed near the end of the movie when they both get caught. The arresting officer mentions that they know which houses were the ones they robbed due to the running sinks.
    
    **Harry**: You left the water on again? That's sick.  
    **Marv**: All the great ones leave their mark. We're the "Wet Bandits." \*awkward pause\*

Later, Bond drops the brooch in Locque's car in memory of Ferrara before making the car tumble down a cliff, killing Locque.
    -   In **No Time to Die**, Madeleine Swann brings Bond to Matera specifically because Vesper Lynd is buried there, so he can forgive her and turn the page on her death once and for all.

Calling Card Example in Literature

-   In the Hercule Poirot novel **The ABC Murders,** the killer always leaves an "ABC Alphabetical Railway Guide" near the victim, as he's **framing** some other guy as a serial killer.
-   The second **Alex Rider** novel opens with someone being killed by "The Gentleman," who lives up to his moniker by anonymously sending a dozen black roses to the houses of the families of his victims after he's completed a job.

-   In S. A. Steeman's **L'assassin habite au 21**, Serial Killer Mister Smith slips a card into the bodies of his victims. This was especially justified - Mister Smith is actually a criminal identity shared between three different people, and the card lets them suggest the idea that Mister Smith is a single killer, allowing any of them to swoop in and provide alibis should any of the others be compromised in police custody.
-   **The Black Arrow**: The darts of The Black Arrow gang's members have their owner's name carved in the shaft.
    
    **Dick Shelton:** **"This is a strange shaft."  
    **Bennet Hatch:**** "Ay, by my faith! Black, and black-feathered. Here is an ill#favoured shaft, by my sooth! for black, they say, bodes burial. And here be words written. Wipe the blood away. What read ye?"  
    **Dick Shelton:** **"'Appulyaird fro Jon Amend-All'. What should this betoken?"**  
    **Bennet Hatch:** **"Nay, I like it not. John Amend-All! Here is a rogue's name for those that be up in the world!"**
    
-   The suspense novel **The Caper of the Golden Bulls** is about a retired thief coerced into a new caper; he laments that he can't get the aid of another master thief known as the "Ace of Diamonds." The Ace had a bizarrely elaborate signature: the ace of diamonds playing card, with a gryphon's head drawn on it, and then a stiletto driven through the card. It's eventually revealed that the gryphon's head referred to the thief being a lovely young woman named Grace — "gr" from "gryphon" plus "ace" — so she was **telling the authorities her name** every time she pulled a theft. And she turned out to be the hero's girlfriend, so the Ace of Diamonds **was** available to help.
-   **CHERUB Series** agent Bruce Norris once joked that he wanted to make business cards to leave in the mouths of the people he knocked out.
-   **The Crimson Shadow**: The cloak of invisibility Luthien finds has the idiosyncracy that if he stays in one position for too long he leaves behind an indelible crimson silhouette.

They believe he left it deliberately to taunt them, and after seeing their reaction he starts deploying it deliberately for that effect.
-   **Discworld**
    -   Weirdly used in **Thud!**, in which the Summoning Dark **is** its own calling card: wherever the Dark-inhabited Vimes goes, objects tend to fall in such a way as to form the eye-with-a-tail symbol.
    -   Technically, the fact Thieves and Assassins always leave a receipt could be considered a calling card. This is how you know you were visited by a licenced professional, and not a common criminal.
-   The **Domino Lady** leaves behind a literal one: a black card with white writing reading "Compliments of the Domino Lady".
-   **The Executioner**. Elite sniper turned Vigilante Man Mack Bolan leaves a miltary marksman's medal at the scene of his killings. Sometimes he has one delivered to a future target as psychological warfare. His enemies have been known to leave such medals at murder scenes, either to frame Bolan or cover up for their own internal disputes (one Mafia **capo** who cut the throat of a rival might have gotten away with it, if Bolan hadn't chosen that moment to attack in a completely different area). The latter tactic was used so often that one underling reporting a Bolan hit got beaten up "for pulling that stunt", until Bolan (who'd let him live so he could follow the man to his superiors) walked through the door and started shooting.
-   Deconstructed in **From The Deep Of The Dark**. Although the Middlesteel press assume she's playing this trope purely for theatrics, the spies who hire the Sable Caracal to steal a royal artifact confront her with the **real** reason she leaves a calling card behind at the scene of each art theft: it's a clue to potential **black-market art buyers**, hinting which crime lord they should contact to purchase what was stolen.

To people who lost family members to him, like Viktor Krum, it's a major Berserk Button.
-   "Kissin" Kate Barlow from **Holes** was famous for giving her victims The Kiss of Death, leaving a lipstick mark.

        -   The "death blossom" is less a calling card and more a warning to get one's affairs in order. Which is, as far as hired killers go, remarkably considerate.
    -   In "Passing Through Gethsemane", it is revealed that a monk in Brother Theo's order, Brother Edward, was once a serial killer before being sentenced to mindwipe. He was known as "the Black Rose Killer" because he left a black rose at the scenes of his murders.

However, upon raiding the balloon killer's house and shooting him in a fierce firefight, the balloon killer implies that he was not responsible for the boy's disappearance this time around, which was shortly thereafter confirmed by Patrick Jane via both a phone call and a note in one of his partner's pocket that he somehow planted in there.

    -   In the episode "The End", a guard in the prison where the Conspiracy's failed hired assassin is held (pending questioning) hands the prisoner a threatening note ("You're a dead man") written on the cut-out side of a Morley cigarette carton—indicating that it was a message from the Cigarette-Smoking Man. A second time, the prisoner receives another cut-out carton side, which has nothing written on it, right before the guard shoots him.
-   Subverted in the Turkish crime-drama **Yılan Hikayesi**. Investigating an elusive crime boss called "The King", the protagonists occasionally find a single rose flower was left in the places that the King was believed to have been. The subversion comes from the fact that they were not meant for the cops. They were meant as a message for his ex-wife whom he could not meet face-to-face for fear of retaliation by his enemies but still loved dearly. The locations where the roses were found were the places his ex-wife had gone as part of her own investigation on her husband's disappearance.

Calling Card Example in Professional Wrestling

-   Played for Drama in Ring of Honor, where Raven, The Prophecy and Chris Hero all left calling cards on their victims, especially if the attack happened off camera. This allowed BJ Whitmer to get away with attacking CM Punk's girlfriend Lucy, as Punk naturally went after Raven, then Christopher Daniels when Raven said Not Me This Time. Played straight with the third party, as Eddie Kingston probably would have reflexively attacked Hero for any otherwise unknown slight against him even without a card, and Kingston **was** right.
-   Subverted when a wrestler associated with the International Wrestling Cartel was stalking Daizee Haze, beating up her ROH Dojo students, and leaving behind switchblades.

Calling Card Example in Tabletop Games

-   Fourth Edition **Dark Champions** had this as a disadvantage as well. It's not specifically noted in 5th edition, but several NPCs have one anyway.
-   Infernal **Exalted** don't **have** to leave these at the scene of whatever horrible mess they just made, exactly, but if they do, it lets them reduce the Yozis' disapproval of them because that's just kind of how Szoreny rolls.
-   **GURPS** calls this disadvantage "Trademark,". The more they increase the character's risk of getting caught (by narrowing the list of suspects or requiring the character to spend extra time at the crime scene), the more points they're worth.
    -   Examples of the most elaborate Trademarks include dousing captured thugs in a certain colonge, painting an entire crime scene pink, and writing a long poem to the police.
-   **Hunter: The Vigil** allows the characters to modify their Karma Meters to allow different breaking points in pursuit of the Vigil; to make up for it, though, they need to take certain "Triggers" that risk being activated in times of stress. One of them is "Calling Card"; you **have** to leave a sign at the scene of a kill. Needless to say, this Trigger carries over well if the hunter becomes a Slasher.

Calling Card Example in Video Games

-   In **Batman: Arkham Knight**, Professor Pyg suspends the corpses of his victims from chains, then leaves behind a loudspeaker blaring opera music. He also paints a word dismissing them as flawed (such as "FAILURE" or "DEFORMITY") on the spot.
-   **Condemned: Criminal Origins** more or less makes a game out of this. As the protagonist is an FBI investigator looking for serial killers, these come up quite often - a prominent one from the tutorial is the "Match Maker", who kills women and then sets their corpses up in scenes with male department-store mannequins who have been given a unique marking on their cheek. Once the protagonist starts finding victims who don't match their respective killer's usual targets (to go from the above example, a male victim with a scar like the above marking matched with a female mannequin), it becomes apparent that the Big Bad who framed him at the start of the game is a Serial-Killer Killer who employs his victims' own methods against them. Other such victims of his include "The Torturer", who drives his victims to off themselves, and an unseen "Bone Cutter", who would dissect his victims, remove their internal organs and individually label them for the police investigating the murder.
-   In **Cultist Simulator**, Rose, one of your Edge-aspect followers (read: assassins), always sends her future victims a yellow rose as a gift before she murders them.
-   **Dragon Age II**: Quentin, the serial killer who kills Hawke's mom always sends white lilies to his victims before he strikes.
-   In **Fallout 4**'s "The Silver Shroud" questline, you get to dress up like the titular vigilante hero from pre-War radio dramas and gun down some of the worst lowlifes in post-apocalyptic Boston, then leave patented Silver Shroud calling cards on their corpses.
-   One of the many categories of collectibles in **Far Cry 4** are the "Masks of Yalung", demonic masks left by a Serial Killer calling himself "The Goat" at the scenes of their grisly murders, which the player is tasked to destroy or otherwise remove. Radio DJ Rabi-Ray-Rana wonders on-air what his Calling Card would be if **he** were a serial killer: Playing cards are too overdone, masks are taken... so maybe he would just take a shit on his victims.
-   The Thief of Many Faces, the antagonist of the **Hildibrand** sidequests in **Final Fantasy XIV**, sends the titular inspector a red and black playing card with the details of his next heist every chapter. The card's usually tossed into someone's head for good measure (and slapstick).
-   Mr. Valentine in **Guilty Party** always leaves rhyming Valentine's cards for his victims.
-   **Heavy Rain**: The Origami Killer, so called because s/he leaves an origami figure next to their victims.
-   The serial killer in **L.A. Noire** usually strips his victim, stamps on her chest, writes a message in lipstick, and forcibly removes her ring.
-   According to the artbook of **LISA**, Geese Thompson, one of the recruitable characters, was a serial killer who left rhymes about his identity near his crime scenes. However, due to the fact that he's really bad at writing, none of the rhymes made any sense, meaning that they absolutely failed as clues.
-   In **Love & Pies**, The Purple Fox always leaves a purple fox figurine after they rob a place. This makes them a suspect of the café arson, but since their motive is to steal and then return the stolen goods afterwards, Eve rules them out. However, after she leaves, Amelia discovers a box of Purple Fox figurines while cleaning the kitchen, which was left behind by her mother.
-   **Love Nikki - Dress Up Queen** has Sapphires the Phantom Thief from the Pigeon Kingdom, whose outfit can be purchased with Association Coins. He is described as an "elegant and handsome" Sharp-Dressed Man who "is in fact, a thief!" The outfit comes complete with his Warning Letter.
-   In **Mass Effect 2**, the Classy Cat-Burglar, Kasumi Goto, tells Shepard that she left a rose in place of what she stole earlier in her career, but her partner made her realize that continuing to do so wasn't a very smart thing to do.
-   From **Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty**, Fatman's calling card is placing cologne on his C4 explosives, which his mentor/rival Peter Stillman is able to take advantage of to create a sensor that can detect the bombs. He soon catches on to this and tricks Stillman with bombs that **don't** have that trace of cologne on them.
-   In **Persona 5**, the Phantom Thieves of Hearts send a calling card to their target prior to the grand heist (as a nod to **Lupin III**). The specific purpose of the calling card is to render their target psychologically vulnerable for a brief period of time, allowing the Phantom Thieves to steal the Treasure (which is unformed and intangible until the target is made aware that it exists and is a target for theft, causing them to think of it as an object that can be stolen), a manifestation of the target's twisted desire and ego, from the target's Palace. In gameplay, sending a calling card triggers a Point of No Return that initiates a boss fight on the following day; clearing this boss fight progresses the story once the in-game deadline is reached.
-   **Sly Cooper** always leaves a raccoon-head-shaped card in place of the valuables he steals.
-   **Team Fortress 2** has several item sets, such as the Tank Buster and Gas Jockey's Gear, which leave a gravestone on the site where the victim was killed.

Calling Card Example in Visual Novels

-   Genocider Syo/Genocide Jack of **Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc** has two: writing "BLOODSTAIN FEVER" on the wall in the victim's blood (written as "BLOODLUST" in the NISA translation), and leaving them crucified. A detail about the second— that said crucifixion is carried out with specially-made ornamental scissors— is kept secret from the press, which proves instrumental in determining if a certain murder was Syo's work or that of a copycat. Throughout the entire story, Syo/Jack kills a grand total of **zero** people — as a hedonistic serial killer, leaving her calling card is the main enjoyment she gets out of killing, but doing so after being outed in a Closed Circle situation would be signing her own death warrant. So she doesn't.
-   Professional Killer Shelly de Killer in **Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Justice For All** leaves a card with a seashell symbol on it near the bodies of his victims so his clients know for sure that De Killer successfully carried out his task.
    -   He actually states that he leaves the card to save the police the trouble of investigating, and to deflect suspicion from the one who hired him. Naturally it backfires.
    -   Mask☆DeMasque from **Trials And Tribulations**; he plants the card **long before** robbing the place.
    -   The Yatagarasu from **Ace Attorney Investigations** doesn't leave a card at the scene, but rather gives it to the media along with the item stolen, with the intent of exposing corrupt dealings.
    -   In the second case of **Dual Destinies**, Phineas Filch's grandfather left statues of himself in the place of the things he stole.
-   The Gilded Poppy in **Queen of Thieves** use the poppy as their signature. In the prologue, Jett leaves behind the burning outline of a stylized poppy which he had traced out in lines of gunpowder and had the heroine ignite for him.
-   Serial-Killer Killer Pi from **WILL: A Wonderful World** leaves a smiley face on all of his victims. It's how he got his nickname, since the smile and the eyes were close enough to be mistaken for the Pi symbol (π) when viewed upside-down.

Calling Card Example in Webcomics

-   In **Blood And Smoke**, the serial killer called The Heart Ripper rips out hearts.
-   In **The Last Days of Foxhound**, Fatman runs off immediately after getting rescued from an enemy base.
    
    **Fatman:** Just wanted to leave my calling card.  
    **Raven:** What's that?  
    **Fatman:** A pile of smoking rubble.  
    **Enemy Base:** KABLOOEY

Calling Card Example in Web Original

-   **RWBY**: In Volumes 2-3, Cinder uploads a virus to the CCT and Beacon computers. The hacker programme has a calling card of a curly "W" and blanks the screen to display a black queen chess piece logo. However, who these two calling cards belong to is revealed later. Cinder herself is associated with black glass, something that Ruby latches onto in Volume 2 as an identifying trait of her's that is not a Semblance. In Volume 7, Ironwood relives the helplessness he felt in Volume 3 when confronted by the black queen logo. The "black queen" is the Big Bad, Salem; in Volume 7, Ironwood admits that he feels powerless when confronted by that symbol as he interprets it as Salem's way of showing she's there and in control. The curly "W" is confirmed in Volume 5 to be Watts' symbol, an expert scientist, programmer and hacker who works with Salem. In Volume 7, Watts and Tyrian are in charge of a Paranoia Gambit to drive Ironwood over the edge. Just as Ironwood thinks he has them and the situation under control, he finds a chess piece in his office made from black glass. Because the chess piece is Salem's calling card and the black glass is Cinder's, Ruby realises that Cinder is in town. Unfortunately, the chess piece is the final straw for Ironwood's sanity, and he begins a downward spiral into villainy.
-   Being a group of sociopathic "Anartists",<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> Are We Cool Yet? of the **SCP Foundation**'s Groups of Interest probably meant to use their group name as both this **and** a signature for their deadly "pieces". It doesn't just limit itself to the phrase; if you see or hear "Cool" in any way, shape, or form on a work or even see the acronym AWCY, you're about to be part of a new exhibit.
-   In "Ayla and the Grinch" of the Whateley Universe, a serial killer is loose in Los Angeles, leaving the heads of the victims behind as an identifier. Heads that are apparently burned off the still-living bodies.
