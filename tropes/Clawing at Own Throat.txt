Clawing at Own Throat: 
Human fingernails can be remarkably powerful. They assist grip, and protect the soft skin under them.

Unfortunately, they can also be turned into a tool for Self-Harm.

Scratching one's throat is often the result of Sanity Slippage and is often done in an absent minded way. The character scratching their throat may have an unfocused gaze or Hidden Eyes. Their voice may have dropped to a monotone level, if the character is still capable of talking after causing a lot of damage to their throat.

If the character is in serious danger of killing themselves, there will always be blood.

Clawing your throat would cause a lot of damage, but is a very slow method of suicide, so suicide by clawing the throat is not very common. Yandere characters often do this, but rarely end up dying from it. This trope is almost always played for drama, and is frequently a major source of Nightmare Fuel.

Lastly, it's not always played for self-harm: It's also a frequent reflex for characters that are strangled, especially telekinetically, or to try to save themselves from a hanging.

Clawing at Own Throat Example in Visual Novels

-   In **Higurashi: When They Cry**, advanced stages of the Hate Plague infection manifest themselves in the infected clawing at their own skin, particularly the throat. This is shown repeatedly throughout the series:

    -   In the DS and PS3 adaptation of **Meakashi-hen**, there is a "Bad Ending" (though on net, fewer people actually die in it than the "Good" Ending) where Keiichi correctly guesses that the "Mion" preparing to torture him is actually Shion, and then she promptly claws her own throat out.

Clawing at Own Throat Example in Real Life

-   It was documented during WW2 that Japanese soldiers taken prisoner by the Allies were prone to attempting suicide by whatever means were available, so as to wipe out the shame to their families that they had not died in combat. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>. Japanese soldiers picked up unconscious and wounded on the battlefields and sent to Allied field hospitals for treatment would often seek death when they awoke and realised where they were. A documented case from a British military hospital in Burma describes the death of a Japanese patient who really did manage to claw his own carotid artery open, bleeding out through his neck.
