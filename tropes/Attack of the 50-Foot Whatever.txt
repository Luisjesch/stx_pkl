Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever: 
Follow

We got BIG trouble!<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

_"There were some serious copyright issues with that, so she is not the 50-Foot Woman. She's the 49-Foot-11-and-Three-Quarters-Inch Woman."_

This is, in essence, Incredible Shrinking Man turned on its head, where the ray gun that zapped the character was set on "Grow" instead of "Shrink". And the protagonists have a huge problem to deal with.

For maximum disaster potential, the victim of the growth is usually a pet, wild animal, baby human or other character without a firmly developed sense of morality or sentience who might innocently topple the downtown skyscrapers without really meaning it. If the victim is a normal person, the growth process will inevitably fry their synapses or they'll go on a power trip with delusions of Godhood, requiring the hero of the story to find a way to put them back to normal just the same.

This generally violates the Square-Cube Law, but that's okay. For humans, expect Magic Pants to be in effect — can't have a giant _naked_ person, after all. The Moral Guardians would freak. Their voices may get lower as well.

Differs from Shapeshifting in that the character generally just becomes a much bigger version of whatever they were before. Pet monkeys and lizards, however, tend to seamlessly morph into either King Kong or Godzilla knock-offs along the way, no matter what their original species were. (And if _that_ happens, expect two or more Japanese tourists to shout "Ahh! Gojira!" and run away.)

Episodes of this kind are quite likely to include a Stock Parody or Homage of King Kong: The 50-foot (15-meter) whatever will climb a tower, often with a Damsel in Distress in hand and airplanes buzzing like flies. Imitators often omit the Downer Ending where Kong falls to his death, though. See "King Kong" Climb for examples.

If the hero wants to fight back, he may be in for a Colossus Climb, if deploying Humongous Mecha is out of the question. Counterattacking from the air is another option, but risks invoking Helicopter Flyswatter.

A standard plot for animated shows, but tough to pull off seriously for live action. B-Movies latched on to this trope for a time. After all, why settle for the standard-size Monster of the Week when you could have a giant one? Advances in special effects technology have kept this from becoming Discredited.

Note that, in real life, no living organism of such a size can exist (the dinosaurs were the biggest land animals ever, but their actual size was nowhere near the likes of King Kong or Godzilla as we see them in the media). As an animal gets bigger and bigger, it must use more and more resources of the body (bones, muscles, etc) just to sustain itself on its feet, and will require higher quantities of food. See here for details.

Written on a billboard. With a broom. He, wearing Lee's Dungarees, doesn't flinch.

Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever Example in Anime & Manga

-   **Attack on Titan**: This show could be called **Attack Of The Fifty-Foot Whatever: The Series**, to put it simply. True to form, the typical Titan is a humanoid creature about 50 feet tall, being described in the series as 15 meters. Some can grow to be hundreds of feet tall and there are several smaller variations, though even the "tiniest" Titan will still be about 9 feet tall (3 meters). The largest one in size is the Colossal Titan, standing at 60 meters (200 feet). At least until the Founding Titan is introduced; it's large enough for the Colossal Titan to stand on its spine.
-   The first opening for **Bakemonogatari**'s anime adaptation features Hitagi as a giant whose footsteps can take up city intersections. This has nothing to do with her arc.
-   **Black Clover**:
    -   Demons are titanic beings of immense magic power but little to no intelligence beyond primitive instinct. One of them alone is powerful enough to raze an entire country within a week if left unchecked.
    -   Dante can use his Body Magic to turn into a giant, musclebound being with enough physical strength to obliterate the ground with a punch and send the resulting countless debris flying with an arm swing.
-   **Bleach**:
    -   Once Yammy Llargo releases his Zanpakuto, Ira, he turns into a kaiju-sized behemoth. If he gets particularly angry, he can grow even larger, becoming truly titanic in size.
    -   Choe Neng Poww becomes a giant, humanoid whale after releasing his Zanpakuto, Calderón.
    -   Gerard Valkyrie becomes a giant through the power of his Schrift, The Miracle, once he's sufficiently injured. When he's frozen and shattered to pieces by Hitsugaya, he reforms as an even larger giant, large enough to flatten an entire city.
-   **Bokurano** has a group of 15 kids pilot a 500 meters tall robot... against other 500 meters tall robots... in a tournament where the fates of little over 32000 universes are at stake.
-   The anime of **Cardcaptor Sakura** featured this with (what else?) the Big Card, whose most malign effect was visited upon a cat (it seemed perfectly content at schoolbus-size.) However, the Big Card was needed in that same episode to fight the giant dragon, which Sakura's friend was describing in the book form of the Create card, and which was preparing to attack Toemeda. Sakura grew to giant size to fight the dragon, and, miraculously, no one noticed.
-   Though not all measure up to Fifty feet, the Awakened Beings of **Claymore** are all fairly massive, the smallest standing at least 18-20 feet.
-   The Ecchi comedy **Colorful**. In one episode, there is a movie about a giant man with a camera. He shrinks back to normal when he spots a panty shot. In a later episode, there's a 50-foot high school girl.
-   One of 007's abilities in **Cyborg 009**, though he only used it once when he and other cyborgs were under attack of cyborg animals.
-   Most of the Akuma in **D.Gray-Man** are roughly human-sized, but when a ton of level 3s are combined, they turn into a skyscraper-sized black giant of death referred to as a level 3.5. Naturally, one of them wound up fighting General Tiedoll, who turned his Innocence into a wooden mecha to fight it.
-   The kraken from **Delicious in Dungeon** is basically a house sized squid. It's even prepared and eaten like one.
-   **Digimon** is replete with examples of this, with several of the good guy and Big Bad title creatures taking on titanic proportions at one time or another.
    -   Special mention has to be made to the stars of Episode 50 of **Digimon Adventure: (2020)**. Holydramon, Goddramon and Milleniumon are large enough that one of the latter's claws dwarfs mountains and makes WarGreymon and MetalGarurumon (themselves now at the size of your typical kaiju) look like ants, and then there's ZeedMilleniumon, who makes the aforementioned Holydramon and Goddramon look **microscopic** in comparison.
-   **Dragon Ball Z**:
    -   Piccolo and a one time villain Namekian from one of the movies, Slug, have displayed the ability to make themselves grow to gigantic sizes. Piccolo completely forgets about this power until Krillin reminds him in **Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero**.
    -   Prior to those two, we had Goku, who turned into a gigantic destructive monkey known as an "Oozaru" when looking at a full moon. This is later revealed to be an inate trait for all Saiyans and, as seen with Vegeta and **Dragon Ball GT**'s Baby Vegeta, they can be tamed, turning them into gigantic destructive **intellegent** monkies.
-   **Fairy Tail**: Lullaby was huge in the manga. He's noticeably even **larger** in the anime.
-   **Fighting Foodons**:
    -   Beefsteak looks like the combination of a cow and Godzilla.
    -   Also Makarov. His Titan magic allows him to change his size at will.
-   In an episode of **Flint the Time Detective**, a Time Shifter causes Sara to grow to giant size.
-   In **Fullmetal Alchemist**, when Envy transforms into his monster form against the Flame Alchemist, Roy Mustang mocks him:
    
    "I can't believe you made yourself a bigger target. You really thought **bigger** would be **better**?"
    
-   In **Green Worldz** plants have overtaken the land and oxygen levels have skyrocketed, causing bugs to grow giant as well, since insect body size depends on the amount of oxygen in the air.
-   Various **Gundam** series usually feature extremely large robots, that dwarf the "normal" mecha. Funny enough, those larger mecha are typically stated to be 40 meters by Word of God, while Gundams are 18 meters (normally), but the large mecha are actually at least 4 times bigger than the protagonist's, making it just as much a case of Sci-Fi Writers Have No Sense of Scale.
    -   **Mobile Suit Gundam**, the original, introduced this with Big Zam, a huge cannon with legs.
    -   **Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam** had Psyco Gundam, a much bigger version of Gundam, painted black.
    -   **Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ** had the return of the Psyco Gundam and the Psyco Gundam Mark II.
    -   **Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn** has a huge Zeong-like armor for Full Frontal's Mobile Suit. That armor's fist was just as big as Unicorn itself!
    -   **Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny** introduced the Destroy Gundams, expies of Big Zam and Psyco Gundam combined.
    -   **Mobile Suit Gundam 00** had **several**. Ali's Agrissa during the battle in the Taklamakan Desert, the Alvatore from the season 1 finale, the Trilobyte from Season 2, and a few others...
    -   **Gundam Build Fighters** had a scenario that actually made sense in-series (and wouldn't be physically improbable outside the series either). Halfway through the show, the normal 1/144 sized Gunpla are facing... a 1/48 scale Zaku, which turns out to be surprisingly tough for a Zaku. All of those Gunpla appearing in the show are **real-life toys produced and sold by Bandai**, including the 1/48 scale Zaku.
    -   **Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans** had the Graze Ein in the first season, which was somewhat of a downplayed example, since it's only 22.1 meters big, whereas the other mecha are around normal size. Gets played straight with the Hashmal in Season 2, however, which is more akin to the size of the aforementioned Psyco Gundam.
-   In one damnation sequence from **Hell Girl**, both Enma Ai and Kikuri are super-sized. They're mocking the victim's desire to be a "big shot".
-   In **Hime-chan's Ribbon**, Himeko acquires the ability to increase or decrease the size of things. She's able to transform herself into a giantess, but since she is trying to keep things secret, she seldom uses the growth ability.
-   The fifth **Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?** novel has an aptly named Goliath as its boss. It falls onto the ceiling of the 18th floor, and attacks the adventurers.
-   **Jungle de Ikou!** ends with Mii turning into a giantess to stop Ongo from destroying the world.
-   One episode of **Kimba the White Lion** is titled "The Gigantic Grasshopper".
-   This happened to Kankichi Ryotsu in one chapter and anime episode of **Kochikame**.

-   **Lyrical Nanoha**:
    -   **Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha** also had an episode where the adorable little kitten was enlarged into an adorable giant kitten by the collectible Plot Coupon. A previous episode had a cute puppy getting enlarged as well, though that one's giant form was less cute and more demonic-looking.
    -   Chapter 48 of **Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid** reveals that one of Fabian's devils could grow to the size of a small house.
-   **Macross**:
    -   **Super Dimension Fortress Macross**: The point of the Humongous Mecha is that the Earth forces knew the Zentraedi aliens coming to claim the SDF-1 would fall under this trope, and built them so they could fight the invaders at their own scale.
        -   You don't really get the sense of scale until you see Breetai and his minions (none of whom are wearing their Powered Armor) fighting against Hikaru and Max... while the latter two are still in their Valkyries.
        -   ... and Breetai's **still** taller than them! He's **big** even for a Zentraedi, though (if the average 30-feet-tall Zentraedi warrior is equivalent to a 6' human, Breetai's easily 6'7" to 7' proportionally); most other Zentradi are as big or slightly smaller than a full Battroid-form Valkyrie.
    -   In **Macross Frontier**, the trope is gleefully subverted as the Zentraedi have become part of accepted human society... and many of them still spend most of their times as 10-meter-tall people who still do simple stuff like farming. A highlight is two humans hanging out with a Zentraedi at a mixed-size mall... and in order to be at eye-level with her, the humans are on a **third-story balcony**.
    -   That said, full-sized Zentraedi seem to be fairly rare in colony fleets outside of the Macross Frontier fleet, as the majority of "cultured" Zentraedi seem to prefer shrinking themselves to human-size. The Macross 7 fleet had no full-sized Zentraedi other than Exedol, and the Zentraedi-exclusive Macross 5 fleet had none either. "Cultured" Zentraedi living at full size are apparently so rare that even Mylene Jenius, half-Zentraedi herself, had never met one and was shocked to do so.
        -   There's also Mylene's sister Emilia, who must have macronised herself only recently, since Mylene was surprised to see her at full size when they met up again.
        -   Which makes sense, since by being probably dozens of times a normal human's mass, full-sized Zentraedi would use dozens of times a normal human's resources in food, air, and space, which are rather valuable commodities in a self-contained environment like say... a **space ship** (let's not even get into why the Protoculture thought making their space-faring warrior race over-sized was a good idea to begin with...).
        -   Background material also indicates that full-sized Zentraedi are not permitted to set foot on Earth after the first series, though "micronized" Zentraedi are perfectly fine. Apparently Earth got fed up with Zentraedi revolts after a while and wanted an easier time of keeping dissidents under control.
    -   Besides the Zentraedi, **Macross Frontier** also has the Vajra, who are basically Big Creepy-Crawlies IN SPACE!, with the largest ones bigger than most capital ships.
-   Volume 2 of **Magical Girl Apocalypse** has a Kaiju-sized magical girl with an upside-down head. In its appearance, it crushes a platoon of soldiers under its foot, downs some helicopters, and ends up destroying the mall that the protagonists are hiding in.
-   In episode 10 of **Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi**, a paper doll transforms into a giant teddy bear, which rampages throughout the fairy tale land. After a failed attempt to trap it in a magical barrier, it grows so big that its head leaves the atmosphere.
-   Many **Mazinger Z** Robeast could switch sizes (the first was Baikong 09). In an early episode, Dr. Hell built a size-changing ray and turned Baron Ashura in a giant with it.
-   One episode of **Midnight Horror School** had Ampoo turn Piranin into a giant so he can become a terrifying sea monster.
-   Most of the dragons in **Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid** have true forms that are a few stories tall. Lucoa on the other hand is much, **much** larger (as in "several times bigger than a mountain" large), with even her eyes individually dwarfing Tohru's entire body.
-   One episode of **Mon Colle Knights** is specifically titled "Attack of the 50-Foot Lovestar" (for the dub anyway), and has the normally fist-sized Lovestar grow huge after drinking some water near a farming village.
-   In one chapter of **Monster Musume**, Kimihito encounters a rampaging dryad who's grown to an enormous size because of experimental fertilizer waste being dumped in her forest. Suu ends up falling into it and growing to a similar size, resulting in a very odd Kaiju battle.
-   Some of the **Mushishi** creatures-of-the-episode were quite large. The dying swamp, in particular.
-   **My Bride is a Mermaid** has this happen to Nagasumi, averting Magic Pants in the process.
-   **My-Otome** essentially qualifies for this in the late episodes, when Nina Wong uses the Harmonium and grows into a several-hundred-foot-tall shadowy version of herself. The physical nature of the transformation/manifestation is debatable, but **cities** get crushed, hinting at plenty of mass.
-   **Naruto**:
    -   The very first scene of the series is of a giant Nine Tailed Demon Fox attacking the Hidden Leaf Village then being magically sealed inside the title character. We are later introduced to the other 8 Bijuu demons, all of which are gigantic in their own right. And **then** we're introduced to the Tailed Beast's progenitor, the 10-Tails, which is **at least** three times the size of the other Tailed Beasts in its first form alone, and gets even bigger as it advances through its subsequent forms.
    -   Summoning Jutsu allows you to call forth giant beasts to attack enemies on your behalf, providing you have a contract with them. The actual size varies both from species to species and creature to creature, from normal sized dogs to "Boss" Snakes, Toads and Slugs that tower over tall buildings.
    -   One of the Akimichi clan's abilities is the ability to grow to an incredible height. It's firstly demonstrated by Chouji's father Chouza, who turns into a giant and stomps on enemy ninja, and then by Chouji himself in the fight against Jirobo where he becomes so huge, **his body occupies a clearing**.
    -   The purpose of Pain's Animal Path is to invoke this trope. **Literally**: he summons giant monsters to fight for him.
-   **Negima! Magister Negi Magi** episode 20 has Evangeline turning giant. She's not aware of anything she's doing, and changes back at the end of the day.
-   **The End of Evangelion** takes this trope to the Logical Extreme: Attack Of The **1200 KILOMETER** Naked Girl!
-   Episode 4 of **Oku-sama wa Mahou Shoujo** features a giant teddy bear walking through the town. It's soon revealed that it was only a model of the town in Cruje's room.
-   **One Piece**:
    -   This is the essence of Luffy's Gear Third. Although he hasn't turned into a full-sized giant as of yet, he can expand parts of his body to the point of outclassing regular giants — who themselves measure at least 60 meters.
    -   In the Marineford arc, the Giant Squad on the Marines' side and Oars Jr. on the Pirates' definitely counts. Fleet Admiral Sengoku is also this when he reveals his Zoan Devil Fruit powers.
    -   In the Dressrosa arc, Pica is an already naturally towering man, but thanks to his Devil Fruit that allows him to assimilate and merge with stone, he can become truly **gigantic**.
    -   Filler character Lily Enstomach is a giant, but she has eaten a Devil Fruit that allows her to shrink in size at will, so the trope is naturally invoked when she returns to her true size.
    -   Kaido's Devil Fruit allows him to turn into a truly massive Azure Dragon, one big enough to dwarf a small town.
    -   After Luffy awakens his Devil Fruit and gains Gear Fifth, he gains small-scale Reality Warper powers, which amongst other things allow him to actually become a giant.
-   The final battle of **Overman King Gainer** features an Overman-sized Overdevil-controlled Gainer.
-   In one episode of **Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt**, Stocking turns into a giant as a result of some magically fattening sweets.
    -   God descends from Heaven as a pair of stockinged thighs so tall the clouds obscure everything above the garter belt, crushing the ground beneath spiked heels.
-   A couple episodes of **Pokémon: The Series** had the cast encountering Pokémon the size of buildings.
    -   Ash's Treecko and a Gulpin becoming giant due to some Applied Phlebotinum.
    -   An inexplicably gargantuan Claydol appears as a Sealed Evil in a Can and goes on a rampage when Team Rocket frees it.
    -   A scientist's experimental treats cause a Caterpie that ingests them to turn gigantic, subsequently re-enacting a parody of **Mothra** (complete with metamorphosing into a Butterfree). Team Rocket uses the same treats on Jesse's Dustox and James' Cacnea.
    -   Another time involved an amusement park island with Pokémon-shaped automatons that were several times the natural size of the critters they emulated — and the cast was stuck ON the island for the duration of the episode.
    -   The giant tribal marked Alakazam and Gengar, and the giant similarly marked Jigglypuff Ash and Co. have to summon to sing them back into containment.
    -   The episode where a Tentacruel grows to a huge size and destroys a city. Misty talks it down and convinces him and his normal-sized kind to go back into the ocean.
    -   An episode set in Galar (where this happens frequently) has Ash's Pikachu unintentionally Gigantamax to combat a Gigantamax Drednaw.
-   In **Pokémon Golden Boys**, Gold encounters a giant Sudowoodo.
-   In **Ranma ½**, the forest of Ryugenzawa is home to a variety of exotic animals, such as koalas and platypuses, who have grown to titanic size (think "rabbits the size of grizzlies" and "flying squirrels the size of fighter jets") due to the magical properties of the Water of Life —itself a product of the magical moss that grows on the snout of the mountain-sized Yamata No Orochi.
-   Chiri from **Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei** grows into a giant in one episode to fight an alien invasion in a parody of the **Neon Genesis Evangelion** movie. There's also a Giantess panty shot, but only because it was relevant to the episode's theme.
-   Episode 30 of **Sgt. Frog** introduced the Flash Spoon, a device that could make its user grow to enormous size. In the first half of episode 57, Keroro uses it to one-up Viper the Elder when the villain grows to giant size in a last-ditch effort at beating the Keroro Platoon. In the second half of the episode, a trip to the Nishizawa Group's private island (while waiting for the effects of the Flash Spoon on Keroro to wear off) results in a cuttlefish, a crab, and a turtle being turned into giant monsters by the spoon, while the rest of the cast also grows in an effort to stop them (except Dororo, who doesn't get his hands on the Flash Spoon until the batteries have run out).
    -   The same thing happened in the dub, only it was called SpoonWow (made in Germany, you know the Germans always make good stuff).
-   Mana Eimiya, the titular **Super Dreadnought Girl 4946**, stands at 49M and 46CM and fights alien monsters of comparable size.
    -   Then at the end, she enters a Super Mode where she grows to the size of 4946M.
-   Let's not forget **Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann**. It went from the 50 feet tall variety in the beginning all the way to the size of a galaxy! What can you do when your opponent is also that size? Obviously you throw galaxies at them. Super Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann is stated to be roughly 3,5% of the size of the observable universe. Its only weapon? A huge energy-drill that's 10 times bigger than the thing itself. The Anti-Spiral counters by growing to 3,5% the size of the observable universe and wielding a 10 times as big drill... Yes, the final battle has over 77% of the observable universe occupied by mecha and their weapons!
-   **UG♥Ultimate Girls**: Three High School girls grow to 30 meter stature, then fight the monster of the week. Lather, rinse, repeat. However, subverting the Magic Pants trope is the whole point of the show.
-   In **Unlimited Fafnir**, the dragons that attacked humanity are huge, standing several hundred feet/meters tall.
-   Early on in **Violinist of Hameln**, the Demon King Drum assumes his true form — as a colossal, multiheaded dragon — and attacks the royal city of Sforzendo. At one point during the battle, Hamel proposes magically enlarging Flute so she engages Drum in a Kaiju battle, but is shot down immediately when they realize the equally-colossal upskirt view she'd give the whole city.
-   One of Keima's captured targets in **The World God Only Knows** grew enormous due to her desire to become "bigger" than a dojo leader.
-   **Yaiba** has the Orb of the Great Buddha, which can make him grow to gigantic size. At least once he grew so big that his head was out of Earth's Atmosphere. After few seconds he started choking and was forced to shrink back to a more manageable size.
-   **Yu-Gi-Oh!: Capsule Monsters** has the Five-Headed Dragon, Seven-Armed Fiend and Reshef the Dark Being, all of whom are villains or controlled by villains.

        -   The **Legion of Super-Heroes** has Colossal Boy.

        -   **The Plague of the Antibiotic Man**: Superman tries to stop Jevik, a thirty-foot-tall, bipedal yellow-furred alien monster which looks like a cross between a dog, an elephant and a lizard, from rampaging through Central City.
    -   There's Atom Smasher (formerly of the JSA), the Wonder Woman villainess Giganta, and Apache Chief from **Superfriends**, later reimagined as Longshadow on **Justice League**. Atom Smasher is somewhat unique in that his powers are more limited than most examples — his maximum height is well below 50 feet, probably closer to 30.
    -   DC also has Elasti-Girl of the Doom Patrol who has straight growth (and shrinking) as her power as opposed to the Rubber Man powers her name would normally suggest.

-   The **Doctor Who (Titan)** Twelfth Doctor story "The Swords of Kali" climaxes with the Attack of the Giant Alien-Possessed Clara Oswald!

-   In **Eight Billion Genies**, one common wish is to grow gigantic, with everyone from children to adults wishing to tower over buildings. One page shows that a man who wished to grow so tall he could be seen from space... and promptly begins to suffocate, since his head is in the stratosphere.
-   AC Comics, in general, has nearly half of its female characters able to turn into giantesses. This is explicitly Fanservice; their first giantess character was so popular that they ran with it. In particular Tara Freemont and Garganta of **Femforce** have this as their superpower.

    -   Captain America foe the Ameridroid, a 20-foot tall Killer Robot that looks exactly like Captain America, possessed by the mind of a Nazi scientist.
    -   Used hilariously in an issue of **Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane**, in Mary Jane's dream.

It shrinks back to a normal size after Somnambula and the serpent's other victims escape from its gut and take the stone with them.
-   The **National Lampoon** did a comic-book parody of the genre called "Attack of the Sizeable Beasts", where a well-intentioned scientist's growth-hormone test animals get loose. Not monstrously big, just...bigger than normal. A really large raccoon falls out of a tree and dents a car, a remarkably large bird flies off with a baby's sweater, that sort of thing. They don't wreak havoc so much as a low level of annoyance.
-   Recurring villain Zoster of **Paperinik New Adventures** in his last appearance stole Xadhoom's powers and use them to become as big as the **SUN**. How many foot are those? Fortunately it was all a plan of Xadhoom that she created before dying. In fact it was the last appearance of Zoster because the experiment killed him.
-   A ray gun operated through an altered blueprint makes Bubbles and Talking Dog grow giant size in **The Powerpuff Girls** story "Big Bubbles' Blues" (issue #61, DC run).

-   The first **Simpsons Comics** book involved Homer being on the receiving end of one of Mr. Burns' experimental growth rays. He ended up rampaging through Springfield until a dose of an experimental formula returned him to normal.
-   In **The Simpsons Futurama Crossover Crisis**, the giant Homer from the very first issue of the **Simpsons** comic ends up being brought back during the climax of the second miniseries.
-   Gargamel in **The Smurfs** comic book story "The Smurfnapper" tries to pull this on the Smurfs near the end when he drinks a formula that is supposed to turn him into a giant, but because the Smurfs had switched the potions in the bottles, the formula Gargamel ended up drinking instead shrank him until he was no more than Smurf-size.

-   Dr. Manhattan from **Watchmen** can boost his size to become bigger. **Much** bigger. Actually semi-justified in Manhattan's case; he rebuilt a body for himself after the accident, so the fact that he made it human-sized is largely nostalgia/convenience.
-   Played tragically in Issue 4 of the **Weird Science** comic anthology. A scientist helps a short man get taller with an experimental procedure on his hormone glands. Unfortunately, his body doesn't respond to the treatment to stop it, and he keeps growing until he becomes a giant. Becoming incapable of getting any work and getting negative press from all the food it takes to feed him he's ultimately hounded by the military until he's bombed to death trying to escape in the ocean.
-   **WILQ – Superbohater**: Happens in Opole rather regularly. Most cases are caused by Doctor Wyspa who, being an avid wargamer, loves humongous killer robots; Godzilla also happened to visit the city at least once.
-   **Zombo**: After Obmoz gains "the power of a million Zombos" thanks to Zombo's Mad Scientist creator, he becomes a gigantic zombie who proceeds to rampage around the city killing anything in sight.

Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever Example in Comic Strips

-   A recurring theme in **Calvin and Hobbes**:
    -   One strip has Calvin imagining he drinks a magic elixir and grows to over 300 feet. He proceeds to rampage through an imaginary town. His mom is not amused when Calvin asks for replacements for the toy cars that were lost in the rampage.
    -   He also built several castles in his sandbox and said they were downtown Tokyo. Then he stomped across them with a growl and said he was Godzilla.
    -   One winter day, he built about fifty tiny, foot-tall snowmen... at the base of a hill... and then went up the hill with his toboggan.
        
        **Calvin:** For the townsfolk below, the day began like any other day...
        
    -   And, of course, the many strips involving a rampaging carnosaur qualify.
    -   In one of Calvin's Imagine Spots, he becomes "the size of a bug **to** a bug" and a giant bug starts trying to step on him. The trope is then inverted when a giant frog saves his life by catching and eating the bug.
-   A number of **The Far Side** strips feature giant monsters, including one skyscraper-sized mailman and a group of dogs rallying to save the city.
-   **Garfield**:
    
    **Colonel Exposition:** **Don't make me shut off the wi-fi!**
    
    **Garfield:** That's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever Example in Fan Works

-   the Help Me! Dr.Hazama fanfic known as **Disaster Piece Theatre** has Professor Kokenoe grow to gigantic sizes after her rage consumes her. She is brought down after Ragna shrinks her with an antidote. It was, indeed, a strange day.
-   One **Digimon Tamers** fanfic, poking fun at all the references other fanfics make to Digimon games and anime, took this, Revenge of the Sequel, and Colon Cancer Up to Eleven with the game-within-a-show-within-a-fic Digimon Explorers: Heroes Of The Space Time Continuum, Part Sixteen: The Brave New Digital World: The Attack of The Seventy Foot Kunemon From Beyond The Stars. Some members of FanFiction.Net are trying to turn this into Memetic Mutation, but it's not catching on since no one can remember the name. Some other members are thinking about writing DE:HOTSTC:TBNDW:TAOFTSFKFBTS because this trope can (and does) get played for Rule of Funny a lot in the Digimon fandom.

-   In **With Strings Attached**, the four are at one point shrunk to six inches high. George transforms himself to normal height (unfortunately, his clothing doesn't, no Magic Pants for him), which makes him **seem** like he's grown to about 400 feet high in relation to the others. Whether he can really grow that tall remains to be seen.
-   In **The Keys Stand Alone: The Soft World**, the first person the four encounter is the Magic Taxman. When they laugh off his demands for a quarter of their magic, he suddenly turns into a giant purple monster and picks up John to eat him. After John gets away from the thing by turning into water, George turns into a stone giant and jumps on it.
-   In **Fantasy of Utter Ridiculousness,** a group of fairies are transformed into giants by some wind-borne magic powder. It doesn't increase their threat level all that much, however; they still get thrashed just as easily by the story's protagonists as they would by Reimu or Marisa.
-   **Mario and Sonic: Heroes Unite!**: Eggman's Doomsday Machine is described by the narration as being "over 50 feet in height." The heroes were left utterly speechless by it.
-   Fluttersized is all about Fluttershy becoming huge after a misfired spell by Twilight. There's even an Alternate Continuity where she gets "Discorded" into a mean persona and starts rampaging through Canterlot, Godzilla-style. She even fights a giant Rainbow Dash!

-   The story **Rainbow Dash: The Big Battle** from the MLP:FiM fanfic collection **The Monster Mash** features both a giant salamander and a giant Rainbow Dash.
-   Attack of the 50-Bit Nicelanderis what happens you combine Nicelander Gene with malfunctioning power-ups from **Sugar Rush**. Things are funny up until the point everyone learns that the game can not handle Gene's added bit-space and might malfunction because of it. With many non-Fix-it-Felix Jr. characters blaming him for the inevitable crash, Gene actually goes on a rampage in Niceland after suffering a breakdown and nearly takes out Felix and Ralph in the process.
-   **It's A Dangerous Business, Going Out Your Door**: One of these poses the final threat that Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity face in their quest — a World Snake. While exact measurements are never given, one fan did the math based on the in-universe estimates, and calculated that this creature is roughly the size of **Guam**.
-   In **Tealove's Steamy Adventure**, Tealove's train trip ends abruptly when a giant turtle attacks it. Like many things in this fic, the giant turtle gets no explanation whatsoever.
-   In **The Legend of Total Drama Island**, a giant lamprey attacks Leshawna, and Chris subsequently refers to the incident as "the Attack of the Fifty-Foot Lamprey". <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
-   **Demigod Power**:

    -   Cetus definitely qualifies, being even larger.
-   One story of **Avatar: The Last Airbender** has Katara being jealous of Aang's new growth spurt and takes a potion to get her to his height.

-   **Pokédex** features giant Skitty whose fathers are Wailord that destroy cities without realizing what they're doing.
-   Shows up **Ponies and Dragons** every so often:
    -   The "March of the Giants" game played by the Mane Six. Their characters even have a rampage through an evil pony baron's castle, literally crushing any opposition from the tiny Mooks with some lucky dice rolls. Applejack's character even (accidentally) kills the baron by slipping on some ice and sitting on him, prompting her to quip this gem:
    -   The Cutie Mark Crusaders (and some friends) get in on the action with a game of "King of Manehatten", where they play various Kaiju battling to conquer the city.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
    -   Later, we get an instance **outside** of a game with Queen Supia: a titanic Neighponese Changeling Queen resembling a Japanese hornet. She delivers a **terrifying** "The Reason You Suck" Speech that leaves the normally arrogant Chrysalis a trembling wreck.
    -   Then there was the time where there was a fight for Spike's love between a greed-grown Ember, Mina, and Rarity (Who had been turned into a dragon.)

-   **The Nightmare House**:
    -   Subverted in Lori Loud's nightmare. It appears as though Lucy is growing but really Lori is shrinking.
    -   Played straight in Leni's nightmare, where some spiders grow after drinking "Super Spider Growy Stuff".
-   **The Secret Return of Alex Mack** sees "Terawatt" fight a 200-foot (and still growing) tarantula, and later a 90-foot woman affected by an unknown mutagen. Being able to fly is quite helpful in both fights. Makes sense as it's a crossover with (among other things) lots of B-movies.
-   In **Shazam!** fanfiction **Here There Be Monsters**, Doctor Sivana douses Red Crusher with a growth serum which turns him into a 50-foot giant, and then he sends the mace-wielding human soldier out to rampage through North America.
-   **Infinity Train: Boiling Point** features a Dire version of a Mandragora in Chapter 6 which is big enough to swallow Skara whole.

Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever Example in Films — Animation

-   **A Bug's Life**: The finch, from the insects' perspective. Its snorts and squawks even sound a bit like Godzilla.
-   Willie the Giant in the "Mickey and the Beanstalk" scene of **Fun and Fancy Free**.
-   In **Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius**, Jimmy and Goddard both grow to the size of planets to defeat King Goobot.
-   Played for laughs in **The LEGO Ninjago Movie**, in which the mighty Meowthra is depicted as one of these... from the perspective of the main characters, who are all LEGO minifigures living in a world built out of LEGO. In actuality, Meowthra is a perfectly normal house-cat.
-   Ursula grows to giant size after she steals Triton's trident in **The Little Mermaid (1989)**.
-   In **Minions**, Kevin is turned into a giant by one of Herb's inventions, and uses his newfound size to save the day.
-   **Monsters University**: The Librarian is actually a giant 50-foot tentacled monster and if you make too much noise, she will throw you out. Literally.
-   **Monsters vs. Aliens**:
    -   The leading woman is turned into a 50-foot (well, 49-foot, 11 and 1/2-inch) woman by being doused with Quantonium. Naturally...
    -   Insectosaurus, a 350-foot grub from Japan (where else?).
-   **Phineas and Ferb The Movie: Candace Against the Universe**: During the climax of the film, Mama, the mind controlling plant, grows to a massive size due to the large amounts of carbon dioxide on the planet before coming to life, becoming the Final Boss of the movie.
-   A Shout-Out in **Planet 51** as there's a manual about how to handle yourself when a giant woman attacks with a picture similar to the poster above on its cover.
-   **Shrek**:
    -   In **Shrek 2**, the main characters bake a giant gingerbread man named Mongo to lay siege to the castle.
    -   In **Puss in Boots (2011)**, the Mother of All Gooses (well, one Golden Goose) rampages through a Spanish town.
-   **Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas** has Eris, Goddess of Chaos. She's a little different in that she intentionally switches between being normal size and 50-foot size with no problem. It seems to mostly be for the sake of intimidation and just because she can, as she favors manipulating people and sending the occasional minion over stomping on random things herself.
-   **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem**: Near the end of the movie, Superfly's mutagenic Doomsday Device backfiring turns him into "Superduperfly", a gigantic amalagam of mutated animals that goes on a rampage in New York City.

Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever Example in Films — Live-Action

-   **The ABCs of Death**: In the "W" segment, the city is attacked by a giant walrus that fires laser beams from its eyes.
-   **Alligator** featured a pet baby alligator flushed down a sewer where it grows to massive dimensions eating test animals illegally dumped by a chemical company. Well-done comic horror, and written by John Sayles, yet.
-   **Arachnid** was about a bunch of people on a tropical island getting attacked by a giant spider from outer space and all its mutant babies. It spawned giant centipedes, giant ticks, another spider, and at the very end, what looked like a grasshopper.
-   The trope gets its name from **Attack of the 50-Foot Woman**, a 1958 B-Movie about a wealthy socialite who has a close encounter with a giant alien, grows to the titular height, and has her revenge on her philandering husband. Known for its not-so-special effects and famous poster, it has become a cult classic. Remade as a Made-for-TV Movie for HBO starring Daryl Hannah.
    -   Interestingly, the famous poster used as the page image actually depicts the woman as around 200 feet tall. Perhaps she just wasn't big enough for the poster artist?
    -   **Attack of the 60-foot Centerfold**. And, 17 years later...
    -   **Attack of the 50-foot Cheerleader**. Both featuring the producing talents (uncredited in the first) of the legendary Roger Corman, with all that that implies.
-   In the Greek movie **The Attack of the Giant Moussaka**, Athens is attacked by a Moussaka accidentally rendered gigantic by a ray from an alien spaceship.
-   While most of the tomatoes in **Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!** were smaller than people, they were very large for tomatoes, though one human-stomper-sized tomato did appear at the climax.
    
    **Scientist examining giant tomato:** "Gentlemen, it's worse than we thought. This, God help us, is a **cherry tomato**."
    
-   **The Blob**: One of the key features of the Blob is that every person it consumes adds to its own biomass. When it is discovered it's about the size of a grown man's fist, but by the climax it's eaten enough people to become building-sized. Potentially, it could envelop the whole planet.
-   Seen in **Cloverfield**, which featured a monster that can only be described as a 400-foot whatever. Seriously, look<small>◊</small> at the thing!.
-   In **Dude, Where's My Car?** the alien Amazon Brigade morphs together into one "Super Hot Giant Alien" that goes after the main characters.
    
    **Young boy:** **(looking up as SHGA walks above him)** I wanna go on that ride Daddy!  
    **Young boy's father:** **(looking up with a grin)** Me too son, me too.
    
    -   Just don't ask her if she spits or swallows. She will devour you.
-   **Evil Alien Conquerors**: You must acknowledge CROKER!!! or he will eat your head! It then gets played with when he gets shrunk down to human size as a result of being teleported to Earth, but doesn't acknowledge it and still acts as if he's gigantic.
-   The little-remembered Japanese monster movie from the makers of **Godzilla**, **Frankenstein Conquers the World**, featured a child who emerges from the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, grown from the irradiated heart of Frankenstein's monster, and turns into a giant wild-man who fights a giant lizard-beast. Whew.
    -   The Japanese version climaxes in a fight with a Giant Octopus From Nowhere.
        -   That was actually an ending filmed for the American version, but it wasn't used. Both versions end with Franken-boy and Baragon falling into the earth.
-   **Godzilla**, the skyscraper-sized dinosaur is this. At 350 feet, a total length of 550 feet 2 inches long, and 90,000 tons, the 2014 version is the biggest and heaviest Godzilla of all time. Until he was one-upped by **Shin Godzilla** who is 118.5 meters tall, a full 10 meters taller than his Legendary counterpart and much meaner, uglier, and in a sense more pitiable.
-   **Ghostbusters**:
    -   An entertaining example comes from the climax of **Ghostbusters (1984)**, when Big Bad Gozer makes the Busters choose a form for the monster it will summon to destroy New York City. While the other Ghostbusters try to empty their minds, Ray tries to think of the most harmless thing he can imagine: the mascot for Stay-Puft Marshmallows. Which results in a giant, grinning, sailor-hat wearing humanoid monster made of marshmallows stomping through Manhattan.
    -   They turn it right around in **Ghostbusters II**, when the Ghostbusters themselves using Jackie Wilson's "Higher and Higher" to animate **the Statue of Liberty**, and use it to break into the art museum to stop Vigo the Carpathian from coming back to life.
-   Giant monsters were the stock in trade of director Bert I. Gordon, better known as Mr. B.I.G. He directed many of the 1950s radioactive monster movies, including **The Amazing Colossal Man**, **Earth vs. the Spider**, and **Beginning of the End** (about giant grasshoppers). In the 1970s he did two more films in this vein, **Empire of the Ants** and **The Food of the Gods** very loosely based on works by H. G. Wells.
    -   **The Amazing Colossal Man** (mentioned above) might just as well be called **Attack of the 60-Foot Man**, and it came out in 1957, the year before the trope-namer.
-   In **Hellboy (2019)**, London is attacked by a giant skinless demon with blade-like limbs during the finale. There's also a trio of bog-standard (though heavily armed) giants terrorizing the English countryside that Hellboy is called upon to deal with.
-   In **Honey, I Blew Up the Kid**, Wayne Szalinski's 2-year-old son Adam gets hit with a growth ray. The more electrical appliances that the little guy gets exposed to, the bigger he gets. Near the end of the movie, Adam goes to Las Vegas and gets even bigger, and at one point, two Japanese tourists briefly appear:
    
    **Female Japanese tourist:** Gojira!
    
    **Male Japanese tourist:** No!... Big baby!
    
-   **The Jungle Book (2016)** has King Louie. Instead of being a orangutan he's an **gigantopithecus blacki**, which basically amounts to being a giant orangutan.
-   The **Indominus rex** is stated to be 50 feet long in **Jurassic World**. What makes it an example of this trope is that she's part Tyrannosaurus rex and part Velociraptor, and she's bigger than **both**.
-   The 25-foot tall ape known as King Kong is one of the most iconic examples in fiction, though his height varies across interpretations (largely depending on whether or not he'll be pitted against Godzilla).
-   In the original ending of **Little Shop of Horrors**, Audrey II turns into a giant monstrous plant and takes over the world.
-   **Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus**, dear god. Z grade disaster flick where a Mega Shark and a Giant Octopus get unfrozen by Global Warming, with scenes of the Octopus sinking an offshore oil refinery, the Mega Shark biting a section out of the Golden Gate Bridge, and best of all, the Mega Shark jumping god knows how far into the air to bite a 747 in half.
-   In one scene from **Misfit Heights**, a female tenant is seen running in terror, when a nearby door opens up. A massive hand grabs her, pulling her towards the door, and the massive face that's behind it.
-   A heroic example turns up in the climax of **The Muppet Movie**. Doc Hopper has just ordered his hired goons to kill Kermit the Frog and company, and as they prepare to do so a rumbling is heard...a previous scene had set up that Dr. Bunsen Honeydew had created "Insta-Grow Pills" that have "sadly, temporary" effects. It turns out that Animal has taken some of them, and when he bursts out of one of the buildings and roars, the villains flee and the good guys cheer.
-   **Night of the Lepus** features **Giant Killer Bunny Rabbits**. It is not intended as a comedy. It is, however, inspired by the Australian satire **The Year of the Angry Rabbit** by Russell Braddon. In that novel though the (ordinary-sized) rabbits are infected with a highly-toxic (to humans) strain of myxomatosis.
-   In **Pacific Rim**, after Kaiju emerge from the Pacific hellbent on destroying humanity, giant robots are built to combat them.
-   **Pokémon Detective Pikachu** features Tim and company coming across a Torterra garden in the laboratory houses, thinking that this was really the Torterra garden.

-   In the classic '50s monster movie **Them!**, the US Army learns what's worse than a single giant radioactive ant: A **hive of them**.

-   At the climax of **This Is the End**, Jay and Seth come face to face with Satan himself — and he's the size of a skyscraper, made of hardened magma, has multiple eel head sticking out of his back, and is **anatomically correct**.
-   In **The Troll Hunter**, one of the titular trolls is at **least** 50 feet tall, big enough to make a land rover-type vehicle look like a toy.
-   The classic sci-fi film **Village of the Giants**, from the aforementioned Bert I. Gordon, features a gang of delinquent teenagers becoming giants. They then take over the small town ... and dance a lot. (Interestingly, does not feature Magic Pants for the growing characters.)
-   **X-Men: Apocalypse**: The eponymous villain turns into a giant during his Battle in the Center of the Mind with Charles Xavier to represent the difference in their mental power.

Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever Example in Literature

-   **Alice in Wonderland**, wherein it is Portal cakes, tonics, and pieces of mushroom that cause Alice's vast changes in size — though these changes are irregular: when Alice first expands in the White Rabbit's house, she appears to be as normally proportioned as ever, but when she eats part of the Caterpillar's mushroom, her neck is described as having grown serpentine and winding compared to the rest of her.
-   In the apocryphal work **The Ascension of Moses**, the angels Af, which means "Anger", and Hemah, which means "Wrath", stood 500 parsangs in height and forged out of black and red chains and made to enforce His will. The angel Sammael, "Venom of God", stood so tall that it would take **500 years** to cover the same distance by walking. Sammael is described as begin covered from head to toe in glaring eyes and his job is to "\[take\] the soul away from man". The trio aren't exactly "nice" or "good" but they have a job to and they do it well.
-   **Discworld**:
    -   When the movies in **Moving Pictures** break the barrier between reality and the Dungeon Dimensions, a giant copy of the lead actress, Ginger, steps out from the screen. She soon grabs the Librarian (an Orangutan) and climbs to the top of The Tower of Art, thus simultaneously parodying **King Kong** and **Attack of the 50-Foot Woman**.
    -   At the end of **Unseen Academicals**, reports arrive of a seventy-foot monster chicken rampaging through Pseudopolis.
-   An interesting inversion of the "army battles giant monster" is the Stephen King short story "Battleground", where a hitman finds himself battling toy soldiers that have come to life. This is specially brought across in the short film adaptation, where we often see things from the POV of the toys.
-   The **Dragons of Requiem** series has immense creatures that make even the Vir Requis look like ants. **Dragonlore** has a burly, enormous monster called a Starlit Demon, while **Requiem for Dragons** has the aptly-named Behemoth, a six-legged beast that can crush a Vir Requis beneath its feet.
-   In the TSR **Endless Quest** book **Revenge of the Rainbow Dragons**, if you chose to drink this unknown potion that said it'd make you "strong," then you got an ending where the main character turned into a giant.
-   In **The Fairly OddParents!** storybook **A Mighty Big Wish**, Timmy wishes to be a giant so he can stand up to the school bully, but it proves to be more trouble than it is worth.
-   The Film Noir Monster Mash **Fifty Feet of Trouble** features both a Giant Woman and her abusive and philandering boyfriend, a Killer Gorilla. And, of course, a climactic Behemoth Battle.
-   **The Food Of The Gods And How It Came To Earth**, by H. G. Wells, is about a substance called Herakleophorbia IV that causes whatever consumes it to continue growing throughout its life cycle. Soon giant insects, animals, and plants abound, causing no end of trouble for the remaining normal-sized population. The novella ends on the eve of a war between the "Children of the Food" and the "Pygmies."
-   The second **Franny K. Stein** book **Attack of the 50-Ft. Cupid**, as one might guess from the title, had Franny fight a gigantic winged cherub.
-   **Funnelweb** by Richard Ryan has giant mutant funnelweb spiders rampaging across Australia.
-   In "Genre Savvy", Edgar and Charlotte are joking about what animals in the Mojave area could become B-Movie monsters. Edgar suggests a giant rattlesnake while Charlotte favors killer roadrunners.
-   **Goosebumps**:
    -   The Monster Blood series.. except the fourth one.
    -   The Deep Trouble series has island-dwelling creatures exposed to the chemical D-13, which causes them to grow to gargantuan size.
    -   The Blob That Ate Everyone definitely falls into this category as well. Averted in the TV adaptation, since it's much smaller.
-   Happens in the first chapter of **Gulliver's Travels**. To the Lilliputians, the protagonist **is** the fifty-foot whatever.
-   **Kaiju Rising: Age of Monsters** is mostly full of original (and illustrated) monsters. However, there are a few cases where simple giant versions of existing animals are mentioned.
-   Giants from **The Prism Pentad** are quite huge. The same goes from the Big Bad's current form, the Dragon. The Greater-Scope Villain Rajaat push this even further and turn into a colossus made of thunder and clouds.
-   On page 73 of the Canadian grade 9 French textbook **Sans Frontieres** we see a movie poster for **Zagora**. The monster is just a Horned Lizard with wings badly photoshopped onto in.
-   An early David Sedaris essay talks about trying to write erotica for a Giantess fetish magazine. He harbors no such fetish himself, he simply needs any job he can get. He ponders the more mundane aspects of being a giant that tends to get glossed over in such works. (How would they find enough food to eat? Wouldn't it be lonely? Wouldn't a bowel movement evacuate a city?)
-   In **Shadowkeep** we have the Demon King Dal'Brad, described as being taller and heavier than a medium-sized medieval city.
-   **Tiny Hamster is a Giant Monster**, in which a mad scientist's goo and lightning combine to create a massive monster hamster that starts eating a city.

Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever Example in Live-Action TV

-   **The Amazing Extraordinary Friends**: In "Attack of the Atomic Bombshell", a nuclear genetic accident results in Dr. Dominique Brioche Hulking Out into the 50-foot tall Atomic Bombshell when she gets angry.
-   **Ash vs. Evil Dead**: In the closing moments of the penultimate episode, the Dark Ones summon Kandar the Destroyer, a demon roughly the size of Godzilla, who goes on a rampage in Elk Grove and shrugs off everything the military throws at it (and in fact, grows stronger from the aggression). Ash manages to kill it thanks to a borrowed tank.
-   **The Bush Tucker Man** mentions a story told in Northern Territory, Australia about a mosquito that was so big it landed at Darwin airport and was filled with 100 gallons of fuel before anyone realised it wasn't a mosquito. The host Les Hiddins is skeptical. "I've never seen a mosquito that big. Ninety gallons, but not a hundred."
-   Even **Doctor Who** hasn't been able to resist this trope:
    -   Classic **Who** had "Robot" where The Brigadier's attempt to use an experimental disintegration gun on the eponymous robot results in it growing to gigantic size.
    -   The climax of "The Next Doctor" involves the Doctor taking on a giant steampunk Cyberman in Victorian London. The Doctor of course is in a hot air balloon.
    -   In "The Angels Take Manhattan," the Statue of Liberty turns out to be an alien statue called a Weeping Angel and naturally, it is gigantic. Oddly, since the Angels use stealth as their greatest strength, it isn't as threatening compared to the other Angels and is just background. It's also portrayed a lot smaller than the real thing.
        
        **Rory:** I always wanted to see the Statue of Liberty. I guess she got impatient.
        
-   **The Electric Company**: Do not bother this tiny person. Or he will send his big brother after you!
-   In the **Genie in the House** episode, “Pony Tale”, Louise wishes to be bigger and Adil grants her wishes and… well, you know.
-   **Good Eats** manages to invoke this trope in "Fry Hard III: Fry, Tempura, Fry!". Alton Brown introduces the topic of the episode using a kaiju-style prop monster, made to look massive using clever camera angles and prop placement.
    
    **'TEMPURA!!!**'
    
-   In **The Goodies** episode "Kitten Kong" Applied Phlebotinum transforms Twinkle the kitten into a monster that destroys London.
-   **Hey You! What If...**: "You Could Turn Into A Giant?" shows that being a giant might seem like a fairy tale, but if you somehow became a giant in reality it would be anything but. You'd have slow reactions and be so heavy that you couldn't stand up. In fact, you'd have to live in a bath.
-   In the Honey I Shrunk The Kids TV Series, Grandpa Murdock accidentally swallowed his whole family when they shrunk. The Honey I Shrunk The Kids franchise has many examples of giant and tiny things, living and not.
-   In "The Twenty-Foot Root" from **Johnny and the Sprites**, Root ends up making himself grow to 20-feet tall after being upset about being the littlest Sprite. Johnny teaches him that "You're the right size naturally / You're who you're supposed to be..."
-   **Kamen Rider**:
    -   Kamen Rider Arc is the largest Kamen Rider to date at **3.2m** tall, without use of CGI!
    -   **Kamen Rider J** is a heroic version of this trope, able to grow to building-size in order to fight Fog Mother
        -   Doras gains this ability after merging with Fog Mother in the ZO/J Crossover movie.
    -   Parodied in Kamen Rider Decade. When Momotaros appears via Final Form Ride, the camera took an angle that made it **look** like Momotaros had become giant. Decade quickly shattered that perception.
        -   Played straight in Decade's first movie, **All Riders vs. Dai-Shocker**, with King Dark, J, and Jumbo Complete Decade.
-   The 1970s series **Land of the Giants** dealt with a bunch of people from earth whose airship somehow crossed over to another world where the people, animals and things from that world are all 12 times normal size.(One example: a dial telephone on a desk is about 4 feet tall.)
-   The crew of **Lexx** fought enormous alien replicas of human women in two episodes.
-   **Massive Monster Mayhem** is a game show where one of the 3 pre-teen contestants grows massive size to combat one of Master Mayhem's Monsters, via finding power pods and activate the Megalaser to defeat the monster. Master Mayhem can teleport his monsters to Earth, Mega-Sized, by pressing the green button.
-   In **Monster Warriors**, Klaus Von Steinhauer specialised in giant monster movies, and now that he has access to the Monster maker, these make up the majority of the beasts he unleashes on Capital City. Aside from the Big Creepy-Crawlies (listed under that trope) other giant creatures he created include: lobsters ("The Giant Lobster Invasion"); a giant Muck Monster ("Revenge of the Mud Maniac"); a sea cucumber ( "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea Cucumber"); frogs ("Ribbit" and "Ribbit 2: Froggy's Revenge"); a jellyfish ("Beast from Below"); vampire bats (Megabatua"); a giant robot ("Astrosaurus vs. Gigantobeast"); a rat ("Ratblaster"); penguins ("Penguins"); and gnomes ("Gnome for the Holidays").
-   In the "Killer Cars" sketch on **Monty Python's Flying Circus**, the cars are eventually gotten rid of "by the miracle of atomic mutation" — that is, they're chased away by a giant cat walking on its hindlegs.
-   **The Mr. Potato Head Show**: In one episode, Dr. Fruitcake grows to enormous proportions after eating radioactive sludge. In another episode, Dr. Fruitcake ends up in a parallel universe where he's chased by a giant, carnivorous Mr. Potato Head.
-   A common type of movie featured in **Mystery Science Theater 3000**. Besides the Bert I. Gordon films above, there was **The Giant Gila Monster**, **The Black Scorpion**, **The Crawling Eye**, and many, many more. In the episode featuring **Earth vs. the Spider**, Crow decides to write his own giant monster movie, **Earth vs. Soup**.
-   **The New Avengers**: The threat in "Gnaws" is a sewer rat mutated to monstrous size by an undiluted experimental growth formula spilled down the drain.
-   **Odd Squad**:
    -   At the end of "Happily Ever Odd", Donnie, serving as his brother's best man at his wedding, is revealed to have eaten five of Oona's lab carrots, and as a result, he has grown tall enough to where he can't even stand up properly and has to crane his head forward in order to fit.
    -   One of the superpowers Orson has is the ability to grow into a giant, although he doesn't age up and still remains a baby. "Saving Agent Orson" shows this power in action when Oprah recounts a story to Xavier and Xena in order to convince them not to fire Orson. When everyone gives up on trying to save Odd Squad from two rampaging Hydraclops, he refuses to do so and reveals that he is a Sizeshifter. It's such a sudden turn of events that it manages to leave both Oona and Oprah — who had also given up and were about to abandon Precinct 13579 — in a wordless shock as he towers over them. With this power, he managed to defeat both Hydraclops and save the town (and the precinct) from destruction.
    -   Blobs, a species of odd creature, are usually small when they are infants, and can be both red and blue. However, as "Running on Empty" shows, they can grow to be enormous, about half the size of Big Ben.
-   **Power Rangers** / **Super Sentai**:
    -   The climactic scene in almost every episode ever made. The villain uses some form of Applied Phlebotinum to make the monster grow which usually necessitates the use of a Humongous Mecha in order to take the monster down once and for all.
    -   The final episode of **Power Rangers Zeo** had **the Rangers** grow as well as the villains.
    -   In **Uchuu Sentai Kyuranger**, Koguma Sky Blue, whose powers are based on the Ursa Minor constellation (and is also Just a Kid) recieves a powerup based on Ursa Major that makes him do this. Though it does **not** mean that he's the same size as the Humongous Mecha, heck no. That mecha easily breaks through the **atmosphere.**
-   **Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World** not only featured dinosaurs but also giant sized versions of normal creatures (such as bees) for no adequately explained reason.
-   Parodied on **Taskmaster**. In the first episode of Series 10, the contestants are given the task of making the largest thing they can find appear to vanish without using any kind of editing trickery (i.e. without cutting from a shot of the object present to a shot where the object as been removed). Johnny Vegas decides to interpret this through a combination of this trope and political commentary on Jeremy Corbyn's decisive defeat in the 2019 British general election, by staging a "400-foot" taxidermied mutant socialist chicken, unleashed by Corbyn upon his political enemies, attacking a paper version of Westminster.
-   **3-2-1 Contact** subverts this trope with a very convincing explanation of why a giant insect ala **Them!** is physically impossible.
-   The **Ultra Series** made its enormous success through bringing the giant monster battles of films like **Godzilla** to the small screen. In nearly every episode, humans transform into enormous alien heroes to battle kaiju or alien invaders who have turned themselves gigantic. In fact, a fair fraction of Toku series involve something small growing to meet the height of something already quite large. Then they fight.

Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever Example in Music Videos

-   For some reason giant, beautiful women guest starring in music videos is really popular. However for the musicians in these videos the encounters with these giant ladies usually end unpleasantly.
    -   Averted in Go West's video, "Call Me", where she doesn't eat them, but **literally** gives the two singing leads the brush off!
-   Bubble Butt features "Buttzilla," a Giant Woman who can fly, Summon Backup Dancers, and produce prehensile bicycle pumps from her mouth that she uses to inflate women's butts. She also uses the hose to grab a backup dancer and eat her alive.
-   In The Cars video, '"You Might Think"', lead singer Rick O'Casek imitates **King Kong** in the middle of it, grabbing the girl he's after.

-   In the Czech band Lucie's music video for "Panic" features a gigantic woman in a red dress. For most of the video the lead singer is standing in her hand serenading her. At the end of the video the lead singer slips a ring on the giantess' finger. Unfortunately for him the giant woman then decides he looks tasty and eats him alive.
-   The music video for "Love Machine" by Morning Musume does this to Mari Yaguchi, who happened to be the shortest member of the group at the time. The video for "Kare to Issho ni Omise ga Shitai" also had this with Risa Niigaki fighting a Godzilla expy, apparently with The Power of Love.
-   Ayumi Hamasaki's video **Sexy Little Things** include a gigantic woman bursting through a wall, her head almost as tall as the wall itself.
-   The music video for The Rolling Stones' "Love Is Strong" features giant versions of the band playing around.

Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever Example in Tabletop Games

-   **Changeling: The Lost**: One of the Kiths available to Ogre characters gives you this as its special power. Depending on how powerful you are and how big you are already, you grow to anything from the size of a gorilla to bigger than an SUV. Coincidentally, this Kith is called the Gargantuan.
-   The 3rd Edition of **Dungeons & Dragons** has a supplement called the Epic Level Handbook. Aside from monsters that are tremendously powerful, a disproportionate number of the monsters are also tremendously **big**, such as the Flesh, Stone, and Iron Colossi (super-sized versions of the more common flesh, stone, and iron golems) and the devastation vermin (**really** big bugs). In Monster Manual II, there is also a template to take a tiny or smaller creature and make it bigger than a house.
    -   Hence ... The Titanic Toad!
    -   In the older **Spelljammer** setting, there were Giant Space Hamsters — roughly the size of bears — bred from regular hamsters by Krynnish Tinker Gnomes. And then they bred some of them back to regular hamster size, creating Miniature Giant Space Hamsters, because Tinker Gnomes are ****weird****. Famously, Boo of **Baldur's Gate** may or may not actually be a Miniature Giant Space Hamster.
        -   And then we get into the ****really**** out there variations, like the Sabertooth Giant Space Hamster or the Flying Carnivorous Giant Space Hamster.
        -   And the Firebreathing Phase Doppleganger Giant Space Hamster.
    -   The Classic D&D rules and its Known World setting have a long history with this trope, from the corpse-formed colossus in **X2: Castle Amber** to creatures such as the earthquake beetle. And that's not even counting the Immortals boxed set, which introduced critters like the draeden, one of which has long been mistaken for a **layer of the Abyss**.
-   **Exalted** has some of its behemoths, and any Lunar with Emperor Ox Expansion. One character, Leviathan, has spent the past two millennia as an orca roughly the size of a small island.
    -   Many of the Shintai charms, native to the Green Sun Princes, turns its user into a 50-feet version of their patrons, themselves are **hundreds of feet** scary things. For example, you can turn into massive humanoid sandstorm, massive tentacular sea monster, massive green radioactive star... And if you go Devil-Tiger route, you can have Attack of the 50 Feet **You**.
-   **Gammarauders** has the bioborgs, giant cyborg creatures that can be fitted with various weapons. There are also conventional forces (in the form of aircraft, tanks, and infantry), which are collectively referred to by players (and the official manual) as **popcorn**. They **can** make a difference in a battle between bioborgs ... but not much of one.
-   **Magic: The Gathering** has Giant Growth, one of the most commonly reprinted cards of the game.
    -   Spoofed in the (deliberately silly and not tournament-legal) **Unglued** expansion set with the B.F.M. (Big Furry Monster), a creature so big it doesn't even fit onto a single **card**.
    -   The world shard of Naya, the home of Godsire, from **Shards of Alara** is home to enormous creatures known as "gargantuans", which are worshiped by the local elves and humans. It has a "big creatures matter" mechanic, there was even one card that would win you the game if you had a 20-power creature after you untapped at the beginning of your turn, as well as speeding your creatures on a path to such a size. The Tarkirian clan known as the Temur Frontier has a similar effect, although it's tuned down to just 4 power instead of 5 and doesn't seem to consist largely of adding keywords to giant monsters.
    -   Even more with the release of **Rise of the Eldrazi**, which feature some of the largest creatures EVER printed in the history of the game.
    -   The "Timmy" demographic in **Magic: The Gathering** is defined as caring first and foremost about massive creatures that can slam the opponent (or, in a broader sense, any spell with a huge, sweeping effect), and **Magic** sure has no shortage. The classic "biggest and baddest" is Leviathan; other notables include the devastating Dragon Tyrant, the unspeakably large Denizen of the Deep, and the majestic Godsire. The single biggest, baddest, most **monstrous** monster in the whole game, though? The dread goddess Marit Lage, who is so powerful she can't even be summoned by normal means.
-   **Warhammer 40,000** seems to have a fondness for using "battle tank" as a standard size for wildlife, and Tyranids revel in this trope with their heavier creatures, especially the Bio-Titans.
-   **Warhammer**: Giant monsters are not uncommon in certain armies, and several resemble supersized versions of common animals.
    -   Giant Spiders are common sights in the forests of the Empire and goblin warbands. Most grow to around the size of a horse, but the Arachnarok Spider of the deepest forests can comfortably outsize a house and makes for a devastating war animal in greenskin horde.
    -   The skaven of Clan Moulder specialize in breeding gigantic, ferocious monsters to sell to other clans as war monsters. One of their crowning achievements, the Brood Horror, is a huge, hairless rat larger than a tank.
    -   **Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay**: Extreme gigantism is one of the most common mutations caused by Chaos on normal animals; while most cases aren't quite extreme enough for this trope (giant rats and spiders, for instance, are "only" the size of a wolf), others, like fen worms (common marsh snakes turned into 20- to 30-foot long monsters), certainly are.
-   **Yu-Gi-Oh!** has a variety of monsters that range in appearance and size, and as you can imagine some of them are outright gigantic
    -   From the **Yu-Gi-Oh! anime** come the depictions of the Egyptian Gods Obelisk, Slifer, and Ra. By extension, Horahkty is fairly massive too, and Exodia (based on Osiris) is massive as well. Exodia Necross, Exxod Master of the Guard, Exodia Incarnate, and Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord likely rival Exodia in imposing size.
    -   The Wicked Gods Dreadroot, Avatar, and Eraser are direct opposition to the Egyptian Gods, so they're about the same imposing size. Since Avatar takes the form of the strongest monster on the field; it's only this is mimicking another example of this trope. This is also true for the Sacred Beasts Uria, Raviel, and Hamon, and their fused form, Armityle.
    -   The Earthbound Immortals were the largest monsters in the franchise bar the Great Leviathan, matching skyscrapers in size. They're mainly massive animals based on the Nazca Lines.
    -   Thor and Loki are pretty large, but not to much bigger than the average example of this trope. Odin, on the other hand, is so big he towers over the horizon behind the city.
    -   Supreme King Z-ARC from **ARC-V** is around the size of the Earthbound Immortals — and his truly bafflingly insane wingspan and tail length add to this.
    -   The Kaiju archetype uses exactly what it sounds like, Kaiju sized monsters based entirely on Godzilla characters, and as any idea of this would be, most of the monsters range from giant robots to massive fire lizards to three-headed lightning shooting monsters.
    -   The Alien archetype has Cosmic Horror Gangi'el and Cosmic Fortress Gol'gar, monsters clearly based on Lovecraftian design and depicted as large collections of tentacles and claws. Exactly how large they are isn't certain, but one of them **is** called a **Fortress**. The similar Worm archetype has Worm Zero, which is basically the size of a city.
    -   The absolute king of this trope in Yu-Gi-Oh! is Star Eater. The name says it all.

Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever Example in Theme Parks

-   When Chessington World of Adventures (near London UK) first opened, one attraction was a dark ride called "The Fifth Dimension", on which the riders were "shrunk" and travelled through a series of scenes of giant domestic items. Needless to say, the riders got "restored" just before the ride ended. (This ride has since been rethemed into "Forbidden Tomb".)
-   A musical version of **Creature from the Black Lagoon** at Universal Studios Hollywood features an enormous puppet of the Gillman at the end, made his unnatural size by an accidental application of... ahem... male anatomy enhancers.
-   In **The Simpsons Ride**, also at Universal Studios, Maggie wanders into a nuclear reactor and later appears as a giant, serving as something of a Deus ex Machina.

Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever Example in Toys

-   **BIONICLE** Rahi Nui is already about 50 feet tall in its standard form (and it also attacks). But it has the power to grow even larger. So large, in fact, that this has once caused its molecules to split, since it couldn't control its density.

Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever Example in Video Games

-   **Against the Storm**: Threats lurking in forbidden glades include the Drainage Mole and the Giant Stormbird, giant wild animals who can summon earthquakes and storms respectively.
-   Unintentionally subverted in **Age of Mythology**, as the Giants, Frost Giants, Fire Giants and Greek colossuses are only about two or three (four tops) times the size of the human figures. Then you buy the expansion pack and watch and marvel as your enemies get goomba stomped by a giant birdman which took you an hour or so to build.
-   In **Amea**, a good number of the bosses are this. Special mention goes to Mish, who was only a small child the last time he was seen.
-   **Asura's Wrath** takes this to a RIDICULOUS level, as the final form of the first boss turns to the size of a planet and tries to CRUSH YOU TO DEATH WITH A FINGER THE SIZE OF TENNESSEE!
    -   Probably the ultimate example of this in both **Asura's Wrath** and possibly all of gaming is Chakravartin, who's extension of his power is so big his basic projectiles are Planets and Small Stars, he throws suns at you later, and Galaxies are small in comparison to him. He's really , REALLY big.
-   **Attack of the Mutant Camels**. To quote from the manual:
    
    The evil alien nasties have invaded the earth — but not in person! They have abducted some camels from earth and used devious genetic engineering to mutate the normally harmless beasts into 90-foot-high, laser-spitting, neutronium-shielded death camels!
    
-   Colbear of **Battle Bears**, who is **so** huge that you can only see his large legs in the first phase of the boss, and even when he picks you up, you don't even see his entire arms.
-   The Famicom version of **Bokosuka Wars** has a rather silly animation on its Game Over screen depicting King Suren and his troops being chased by a giant version of King Ogereth. If the player manages to win, the ending is a reversal of this scene, with a giant Suren chasing after Ogereth and his troops.
-   The Final Boss of **Cho Aniki: Kyuukyoku Muteki Ginga Saikyou Otoko** is a 50-foot tall wrestler wearing a Speedo and a Viking helmet, whose attacks include nasal fireballs, Fartillery, and a navel Wave-Motion Gun.
-   **City of Heroes** has the 'Giant Monster' enemy class for foes that fall under this trope. Most of them spawn in open areas and are specially coded so that characters of any level can deal substantial damage to them. Some like the Kraken, Eochai and Devouring Earth monsters are simply giant versions of regular mooks, but there's also Lusca the gigantic octopus, Jack In Irons the giant... well, the giant, and one of the ultimate Big Bads of the game; Hamidon- a colossal **single-celled organism** that takes dozens of players and special tactics to defeat.
    -   Adamastor the giant zombie, and the Humongous Mecha piloted by U'kon'Grai, Rikti Master at Arms with a name that's one big in-joke<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
-   In **Command & Conquer Red Alert: Counter Strike**, there is a secret campaign where you fight giant ants
-   Almost every single boss in the **Contra** series is a 50-foot robot or alien.
-   The game **Corruption of Champions** has quite a few giants in the game. From smallest to largest are Minverva (8'5"), the Sand Mother (8'6"), Izumi the Oni (9'0"), Corrupted Dridder (10'), and Venus the turtle-girl (**bigger than everyone else**).
    -   Shouldra, a ghost you can befriend, has spell that make certain body parts bigger but occasionally she messes up an makes the person she's inhabiting much, **much** bigger, almost as big as Venus.
-   In **Crush, Crumble, and Chomp!**, the player **is** one of these.
-   In the Japanese PS2 game **The Daibijin** or **Demolition Girl** depending on the version, the player must pilot a helicopter, and in one stage an airplane, against a bikini-clad woman who had been brainwashed and turned into a giant by aliens. Seriously.
-   Lordran in **Dark Souls** is littered with dangerous giant beasts, such as wolves, armored boars, and magic-shooting butterflies.
-   **Destroy All Humans!**:
    -   The final chapter of **Destroyall Humans 1** was called Attack of the 50 Foot President in a reference to the '50s B-movie. Funnily enough, you fight a **50-foot robo-president Brain in a Jar**.
    -   **Destroy All Humans! 2** has a boss fight in Takoshima with Kojira.
-   Referenced in **Discworld II**, where you see a movie poster advertising **Attack of the 50-Foot Dwarf**. Also, in the endgame, a 50-Foot Elf Queen comes out of the cinema screen and you have to defeat her.
-   **Dino Rex**: All of the playable dinosaurs in this game are already pretty oversized, and the bonus stages that you play after beating each two story mode levels allow your dino to wreck a modern city, stomping military vehicles, reducing buildings to rubble and eating soldiers and unlucky bystanders in true Kaiju style.
-   **Disgaea**:
    -   In **Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories**, Flonne's angelic attacks from the first game are obviously unusable. Instead she gets to grow to giant size, wear a big patchy dinosaur costume, and breathe fire while prop planes with obvious strings fly overhead. One of the worst, yet probably the greatest, attack in the game.
    -   Monster units in **Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten** have the ability to fuse with another monster to approximately triple them in size, also widening the area of their skills.
    -   **Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless** features the Jumbofication system, allowing units to grow to titanic sizes to loom over the entire map. Aside from cracking open similarly sized Treasure Chests, these units can also hit a 5x5 grid with their attack, or directly attack other jumbified characters. Jumbified characters also add new passives to the field, such as extra attacks or evading lower-altitude attacks.
-   **Doom Eternal** has this in the game's final boss, the Icon of Sin, which is seen as the Khan Makyr's Godzilla Threshold against the Doom Slayer. It has to be defeated by destroying all of its armor and then shooting it to Ludicrous Gibs and even then, it cannot die because it's completely immortal. The only way Doomguy gets rid of it is to jam the Crucible into its brain and break the blade off to seal it away.
-   **Dragon Quest V**: Bjorn the Behemoose is an ancient goat-like mountain-sized demon. He is easily one of the largest bosses in the franchise.
-   In **Drakengard**, the canon Final Boss is fighting a giant Manah. Play the game more, and you'll run into a no-less-gigantic Grotesquerie Queen.
-   **Dungeon Fighter Online** has a Shout-Out to the above in the form of Quattro Manus, currently the last boss on the last Special Dungeon (King's Library on the Castle of the Dead), you fight him on top of a tower a la Onslaught, complete with attacks from the background, a grab that it's lethal if you don't button mash enough, and a obscene number of life bars. If you aren't prepared for this fight, you (or your party) WILL lose many Life Tokens.
-   **Dwarf Fortress** has giant versions of many animals, the largest being the giant sperm whale which is larger than a real world blue whale. Gods help you should a giant sperm whale ever be infected with undeath as they will then proceed to come onto land to murder your entire fort. Other giant animals include giant sponges, which while not as deadly as in an earlier version where they were effectively invincible (except to copious amounts of magma, a drawbridge, having the water they were in drained, or a cave in) can still fuck your shit up far more then any sessile animal ought to be able to, and giant cave spiders which have a poison that will slowly but inevitably kill your dwarves (and most other creatures) via total paralysis followed by suffocation.
    -   Forgotten Beasts are usually depicted as this trope in fanart. Considering how much resources can be harvested from one, it is safe to say they are quite large.
-   **EarthBound (1994)** has one area, the Lost Underworld, where everything is so huge that the characters' sprites shrink. This includes the enemies.
    -   Fortunately, they later encounter the Dungeon Man (a man the size of a dungeon!) who sees them through.
-   **Earth Defense Force 5**: The player finds themselves fighting giant bipedal alien frogs and Grey aliens in armored suits both armed with energy weapons and accompanied by the hordes of giant bugs.
-   **The Elder Scrolls**:
    -   The series' standard Giants typically stand 11-12 feet tall, but legends hold of Giants reaching epic proportions, standing "several times the size" of an average man.
    -   When Mehrunes Dagon, the Daedric Prince of Destruction, manifests in Mundus (the mortal realm), he typically does so in this fashion. When he briefly took form during the 11th hour of the Oblivion Crisis, he towered over everything else in the Imperial City.
-   Pandemonium in **Everlong**.
-   **EXTRAPOWER**: A staple in the series, given some of its tokusatsu influences. Certain enemies like Stone Mack or Sinner Shiner are already gigantic, recurring bosses Mensouma and Undata are sometimes imbued with dark energy to double their size. In **EXTRAPOWER: Star Resistance**, Undata becomes large enough to be as tall as half the stage, and one of the final bosses is against the gigantic, muscle-bound Shakun Star Central Computer.
-   **Fallout 3** has Super Mutant Behemoths, and on the player's side, Liberty Prime.
-   David Crane's **Ghostbusters** from Activision has the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man make an appearance to stomp down buildings on the city map if the player doesn't lure it away using ghost bait, as well as block the entrance to the building that the Ghostbusters must enter to stop Gozer in the final battle.
-   **Gigantic** is a MOBA centered around two teams fighting alongside giant creatures known as Guardians, with the goal of defeating the enemy team's Guardian.
-   There is a pill that allows this in **Streets of Rogue**, and doing so allows you to break wall blocks and squish people.
-   The **God of War** series absolutely loves this trope. The first game features, among its bosses, a Hydra so large it more or less takes up the entire level, a gigantic robot/cyborg/Steampunk minotaur, and Ares, who could probably wrestle Godzilla. The sequel has Kratos get in on the act briefly, pulling a Godzilla-Of-War on Rhodes, and then fighting the Colossus of Rhodes while normal-sized. While Zeus is **close** to Kratos' size the time you fight him, he's still noticeably larger than the already-abnormally-large Kratos. Titans, giant monsters, and oversize gods abound in the rest of the series.
-   In **Hitman (2016)** completing a secret challenge in the Bangkok level summons a Kaiju sized Cockroach to destroy a city.
-   In **It Came from the Desert (1989)**, humanity falls under attack from giant ants.
-   **Jet Island** has giant spiders, lizards, and worms, as well as multiple drones scattered about that all dwarf the player.
-   **Kao The Kangaroo: Round 2** has a lot of bosses like this, to the point where the train engineer you fight at one point is **bigger than the train itself**.
-   **King of the Monsters**, is a Fighting Game where the competitors are giant monsters.
-   **Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards** downplays this. Rock + Rock turns Kirby into an oversized Mighty Glacier version of himself. Take Fridge Logic and the fact that Kirby's 8" tall, and you realize that the Rock + Rock Kirby is 1'04"! (50 feet would actually be 37.5 times as large as Rock + Rock Kirby)
    -   Star Dream in **Kirby: Planet Robobot**. While it was already quite huge to begin with, when it merges with the Access Ark in the second phase it becomes the size of a **small planet,** being one of the largest final bosses in the series to date.
    -   King Dedede goes through this in **Kirby's Blowout Blast**. After his defeat, he absorbs the power of a Sparkling Star and grows to the size of a giant. The final time he does this, he combines it with the Cool Mask of Masked Dedede to make Giant Masked Dedede.
    -   Void Termina in **Kirby Star Allies**, fitting for his role as the "True Destroyer of Worlds". His outer shell, at least. His core is at least thrice as big as Kirby.
-   In **The Legend of Zelda** game **Hyrule Warriors**:
    -   With the Summoning Gate, Lana can bring up a gigantic Cucco to devastate the battlefield.
    -   Ganon's Fury mode lets you play as a Giant Boss. Link's Great Fairy "weapon" (read: she does the fighting while Link is stuck in a bottle) works similarly in other modes. And you can unlock the Cucco as a playable character in Ganon's Fury.
-   **Lemegeton**'s first episode ends with a fight against Gaap, a **huge** demon who may **literally** be 50 feet tall. The best way to describe him is a kind of humanoid fort that periodically sweeps one side of the room with a petrifying beam.
-   An early level in **3D Lemmings** is "Attack of the 50 foot Lemming" — your lemmings start on the giant lemming's head and make their way down to the feet. Unfortunately there's no attacking, just a level designed to look like a giant lemming.
-   The arcade rail shooter **Let's Go Jungle!** features hordes of giant critters as enemies. In addition to giant spiders, there's giant wasps, giant frogs, a giant mantis, and the final boss is **a giant killer butterfly**.
-   Late in the Japan-only PC-FX game **Makeruna! Makendou Z**, after our heroes are put to sleep by Honmayaner, Hikari dreams that she is a giantess fighting a three-headed dragon.
-   **The Matrix: Path of Neo**. At the end of the game, which corresponds with the end of **Matrix Revolutions**, two avatars of the Wachowski siblings themselves speak directly to the player and explain that, while the Martyr ending was OK for the movies and the story, it just wouldn't work that well for a videogame. So instead, all the Smiths get together and grab various bits of destroyed junk and debris, as well as a giant pair or sunglasses from an ad, and for a GIANT Smith.
-   **Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story**: Parts of the game have Bowser grow to enormous proportions and fight giant enemies, usually after he's been nearly crushed to death by them, and needs the Mario Brothers to revive him from within.
-   **Moshi Monsters**: In Humongous Haven, people randomly shrink and turn into giants.
-   **Muramasa: The Demon Blade**:
    -   Momohime's fourth boss, Ippondatara. You have to fight his giant foot first (which refers to a legend regarding one of Kyoto's mansions), then his huge body. From time to time he will turn into the harmless Inosasao (a giant boar with bamboo leaves on his back).
    -   And then there's the giant centipede, the second boss in Kisuke's story.
-   In **Octogeddon**, cities worldwide are destroyed by the titular giant octopus (which can mutate its tentacles in various other animal parts like crab claws or penguin heads).
-   One scenario in **Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan** revolves around a Salaryman growing to gigantic height to fight a giant blue mouse that was attacking the city. The second **Ouendan** game had a giant cat called Nyaragon. Nyaragon was based on the monster from a movie that was being made in **Elite Beat Agents**, **Ouendan**'s sister series.
-   One stage of **Parappa The Rapper 2** involves Parappa and an ant being repeatedly shrunk and then grown to enormous size.
-   **Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness** starts with Gabe and Tycho chasing after this giant robot that flattened your character's house.
-   In **Persona 5**, the final form of the Big Bad is a 20 story tall giant robotic god covered in gold and crystal armor, who you end up fighting with an even **bigger** demon king on a giant tree like dungeon looming over Tokyo, Japan.
    -   The Updated Re-release, **Royal**, has Adam Kadmon, the Persona of Dr. Maruki also grow to this size... and the player **doesn't** have access to a similar ability.
-   In **Pokémon Legends: Arceus**, the final and largest noble Pokemon Hisuian Avalugg. The thing is huge and the player character looks rather small next to it.
-   In **Pokémon Sword and Shield**, there is a phenomenon called Dynamax which unique to specific locations in the Galar region. Pokémon affected by this phenomenon can temporary become giant. The Galar league harnesses Dynamax by building Gyms on those locations, and trainers gain access to this power with a Dynamax Band. There's also a variant called Gigantamax, in which Pokémon become giant and change form akin to Mega Evolution from **Pokémon X and Y**.
-   One of the movie scripts in **Pokémon Black 2 and White 2** is this; the protagonist's girlfriend/sister is turned into a giant in the middle of the city by a cursed Poké Ball, and much panic and flailing ensues.
-   In **Poptropica**'s 24 Carrot Island level, Dr. Hare sends giant robot-rabbit to attack you as the final line of defense against your (heroic) assault.
-   In **Psychonauts**, stepping into the mind of a giant lake monster transforms you into an enormous monster called ''Goggalor."
-   In the classic arcade game **Rampage**, you play a human turned into a giant monster by an experiment gone wrong and demolish everything in sight.
-   **Ratchet & Clank** has had robot Clank turn into a Humongous Mecha, who gets to level the surrounding area. A later game in the series, fittingly called **Size Matters**, features a lot of both this and Incredible Shrinking Man as part of it's plot.
-   A series tradition in **Resident Evil** is fighting creatures that became giant sized usually as a direct result of the T-Virus. So far, in order, the heroes have had to fight a snake as big as a bus, a great white straight out of **Jaws**, a spider big enough to crush a tank, an alligator that can barely fit in the hallway you fight it in, a caterpillar that that can swallow a man whole, an earthworm that can swallow a man whole, another spider that can crush a tank, and a salamander so large it can drag a boat around. All of the Tyrant bosses meanwhile, are Was Once a Man now anywhere from 8 to 10 feet tall with Wolverine Claws. A standard enemy in most of the games are spiders big enough to tackle a person, and in **Resident Evil 3: Nemesis**, mutant fleas bigger than Jill.
-   **Scooby-Doo! Unmasked**: The giant Pterodactyl animatronic that serves as the game's final boss.
-   **Scribblenauts**: The addition of adjectives allows you to make any living creature into a gigantic version of itself.
-   The final boss of **Serious Sam: The First Encounter** is Ugh Zan III, a giant four armed monster who is so big that Serious Sam only reaches up to his foot. Almost all of the second-to-last level is about outrunning him to the super weapon stored inside a pyramid because he's too damn big. He's an actual enemy inside the level, not just an Advancing Wall of Doom (though he functions the same way).
-   Every boss except the final episode in **Shaw's Nightmare.** They are huge compared to the tiny protagonist.
-   **Shin Megami Tensei IV** gives the ultimate DLC challenge against Tokyo local protector deity Masakado. While in other games is a normal sized human, in this case is a being so giant that skyscrapers protrude from his shoulders, his hands are giant roots ripped from the earth, his waist is connected to the ground via magma, and is so big that he could be measured in kilometers. He can completely cover the whole city of Tokyo (creating the Firmament) and also host a complete medieval society on his very back (several villages, a big lake and fortified city with several protective rings, huge castle included). His inner body includes Naraku, a giant maze cave which is home to several demons connected to the freaking Sky Tower that links both Tokyo and Mikado. And he's also **strong enough to tank a last-gen nuke**. You actually can't beat him in the game, you have to calm him down in ten minutes (ten turns in game) so he can tank the Nuke before it turns Tokyo into Blasted Tokyo. A pic  for reference.
-   **Shin Megami Tensei V** has Surt, a giant humanoid demon whose flaming BFS alone is as tall as the buildings in his immediate vicinity, and Lucifer, who's **as tall as the Tokyo Tower** <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> in this game. His true form isn't **as** gigantic, but he's still several times taller than the Nahobino.
-   This happens quite a bit across **SimCity** series, including Godzilla, Bowser, and a cycloptic floating Giant Spider with a Wave-Motion Gun.
-   The end of the second chapter in **Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves**. Due to unforeseen combination of sleep darts and Mask of Dark Earth's influence, Carmelita starts growing. And yes, the Dating Catwoman protagonist Sly gets to solve the problem with a Carmelita Climb, as put by the game.
    
    **Bentley:** You've always wanted to get closer to her. Can't get much closer than climbing up her boot laces!
    
    -   Much later in the game, Dr. M attacks you with a large mutant... Thing.
-   In the **Sonic the Hedgehog** series, Sonic and friends tend to fight these things as final bosses, usually either as Humongous Mecha created by Dr. Eggman or monsters unleashed by Dr. Eggman. Since our heroes are no bigger than three feet (with a fex exceptions), it makes the bosses even bigger.
-   In **Spider-Man and the X-Men in Arcade's Revenge**, Gambit's level boss is a gigantic Selene robot. The Final Boss is also a giant robot based on Arcade.
-   **Spore** gives us Epic creatures, larger versions of creatures made by other players that start off at a large, but not ridiculously so size in the creature stage, but become downright massive in Civilization. In Space phase, you can use the "Supersizer" tool to enlarge creatures, turning the scenario into "Attack Of The 50 Foot Whatever You Want". Furry Confusion ensues when the game selects a species whose hnau version you brought up to Diplomat Hero in the last game.
-   The right parameters when spawning mobs in **Star Trek: Elite Force 2** will allow you to make Map sized lizards and borg collosi, among other things.
-   **Super Mario Bros.**:
    -   In **Yoshi's Island**, the bosses are normal enemies made giant by the magic of Kamek (except for one battle that involved Yoshi and Baby Mario getting shrunk). In fact the final battle involved Kamek enlarging Baby Bowser to a size bigger than the castle they were in.
    -   There's also **New Super Mario Bros.**, **Super Paper Mario**, and **Super Mario 3D World**, where there are power ups that can make the player character grow as tall as the screen and tear through enemies and obstacles.
    -   There's also Giant Land in **Super Mario Bros. 3**, where all the standard enemies are now bigger than Mario or Luigi.
    -   A recurrent boss in the 3-D games is a Goomba as big as a house.
    -   Bowser at the end of **New Super Mario Bros. Wii** looks rather similar to Godzilla.
    -   **Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story** has Bowser being super-charged on adrenaline and growing super giant in order to battle his hijacked castle, a giant robot coming out of nowhere, a train, and **Princess Peach's Castle** (as remodeled by Fawful), preceded by Bowser being crushed by the buildings.
    -   **Mario & Luigi: Dream Team** has Luigi grow to giant size in the Dream World to face off against giant bosses. In a nod to the previous game, he ultimately gets to face off against a giant Bowser in what's probably his most triumphant moment in the series.
    -   **Paper Mario: The Origami King** has the Paper Macho Soldiers, large versions of existing enemies made of papier-mâché. Most are only three to five times Mario's height, but the Paper Macho Shy Guys in Overlook Mountain are about ten times Mario's height, and the Mega Paper Macho Pokey in Scorching Sandpaper Desert is at least the size of a building. The latter is a deconstruction, as its size causes it to fall over every several seconds, which gives Mario the opening he needs to fight it—as it gets shorter as Mario destroys whatever segment is at the bottom at the time, the Mega Paper Macho Pokey falls over less and less. Then, King Olly folds himself into a giant origami beast for Mega Bowser to take on. He then gets even larger as Mega King Olly during his Villainous Breakdown.
-   **Mario Party 10**: Bowser towers over Team Mario in Bowser Party mode, being even larger than the nearby buildings like the mid-boss fortresses. He destroys much of the scenery as he charges through the boards in pursuit of Team Mario.
-   **Super Mario RPG**:
    -   An important part of the story involves a giant sword that destroyed the Star Road and crashed right into Bowser's Keep.
    -   Throughout the game, there are also power-ups that either double or half a character's size, and allows that character more or less control respectively over his partner.
-   **Super Metroid**: When they called this game "Super" Metroid, it was for good reason. Fortunately, despite its innocent, insatiable hunger, the giant Metroid is on your side. Kraid is also much bigger than he was in **Metroid**, which is now his canon design and size.
-   **Super Smash Bros.**:
    -   In **Super Smash Bros. Brawl**, Jigglypuff's Final Smash, Puff Up, causes her to grow/inflate to such a size that it can push other characters off the stage. Most evident on small stages.
    -   Bowser's equivalent Final Smash move involves turning into the dreaded Giga Bowser and wreaking havoc on everybody. Giga Bowser is much larger in **Melee** than he is in **Brawl**, and can get Super-Mushroomed to a downright ridiculous size.
-   **Team Fortress 2** lampshades this in their promotional material for an update to Mann vs. Machine, when the robotic Engineer was added.
    
    And as the incredible art above this paragraph illustrates, (the Mecha-Engineer) will be over **one hundred feet tall!** (It will not.) Not to worry, though, because it looks like Engineer will also be **one hundred feet tall!** (He also will not.)
    
-   **Theia - The Crimson Eclipse**: After becoming the spirit of Ariathale's third moon,Rudra becomes a gigantic spectral Varzan with enough power to kill a similarly gigantic Halcon/Themis in one slash.
-   In **Total Rampage**, you play a giant monster trying to terrorize a city. Very similar to it's arcade counterpart, **Rampage**, mentioned at the start of this folder.
-   **Touhou Project**:
    -   Suika utilizes her control of density to grow herself really large and heavy for some of her attacks in **Immaterial and Missing Power** and **Scarlet Weather Rhapsody**.
    -   The plot of **Hisoutensoku** boils down to three characters seeing an impossibly huge shadow of something and going off in pursuit of whatever it was (though only one of them successfully tracks down the cause of their respective shadow). The last boss fights of Cirno's and Meiling's scenarios do this to a doll and a catfish, respectively. In the latter case, the catfish starts off as merely huge and continues to grow each time it attacks. Sanae's scenario inverts this by making her last boss the shortest character in the game.
    -   **New Super Marisa Land** does this for the final boss.
-   One of the bosses in **Transistor** is "The Spine of the World", a massive Process that resembles a horseshoe crab with a long, spiked prehensile tail that it uses to attack Red as she climbs Highrise to get to it. Its mere **presence** causes the Transistor to go haywire and become delirious. And even worse, there's more than one.
-   **WarioWare: Snapped!**: Jimmy T. makes comics after all of his microgames are played, though a panel will not show if a player fails a single microgame. If all of the microgames are successfully cleared in a certain order, there will be a comic where the player gets hit in the face by a boy named Jack. A guy proceeds to give the player magic beans that, when consumed, cause the player to grow to an enormous size, giving the player an advantage over Jack, who is promptly swatted away by the player.
-   **World of Warcraft** has a few monstrous foes.
    -   Vanilla has the Devilsaurs, various giants, and the Fire Lord Ragnaros.
    -   **The Burning Crusade** added Fel Reavers, Colossi (crystalline giants), and the one-eyed Gronn.
    -   **Cataclysm** is bringing in Whale Sharks and Neltharion himself, who is FREAKING HUGE!
    -   In **Wrath Of The Lich King**, the Ulduar raid dungeon is a Titan city, and thus is made of this trope, by this trope, for this trope.
    -   You also get to be this in one of the new dungeons (Throne of the Tides) for part of the last boss, where you have to drive away a gigantic squid from the equivalent of a water god's lair.
    -   The Badlands quest "The Day That Deathwing Came" features three characters drunkenly telling tall tales about how they defeated Deathwing (a dragon). You play out each tale from the character's perspective - one involves a gnome growing to gigantic size and yanking Deathwing from his hiding place **in the sun**. You then throw him to another continent.
-   **You Are Empty** has the Lenin Komsomol Hens, ordinary chickens transformed by Soviet Superscience into vicious giants.
-   **Zombies Ate My Neighbors**:
    -   The game features such bosses as giant babies, giant snakes, and two mad scientists who turn into giant red tarantulas.
    -   The level with the giant ants. It's not a boss, but a level where the enemies are giant ants.

Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever Example in Web Animation

-   In **Gaming All-Stars**, many of the antagonists’ one-winged angel forms count as this (E.g. Giga Bowser in **The Ultimate Crossover** and **Remastered**, Zarok’s cobra form in **2**), as well as villains who are already rather jumbo-sized in the first place (E.g. The Negativitron and Ralph in **The Ultimate Crossover** and **Remastered**). Either way, they absolutely **dwarf** all of the human-sized characters.
-   **Homestar Runner** spoofs this in the Strong Bad Email unnatural, where Bubs is turned into the gigantic "King Bubsgonzola Supreme" and goes on a rampage, so, Strong Bad, Homestar, The Cheat, and their friends must find a way to stop him.
-   A giant Discord razes Ponyville for much of the **PONY.MOV** series. In **SWAG.MOV**, Rainbow Dash grows to an equal height to battle him.
-   **I'm Anton!**: A giant mantis began roaming around the city, destroying buildings and eating people. It was eventually taken down by the military and Terada bought the remains.
-   **AstroLOLogy**:
    -   In "Roachzilla", the city is attacked by a giant cockroach with Drama Queen Pisces being a witness and scared to death of it. It's actually just her overactive imagination exaggerating the size of the insect, though.
    -   In "Robopocalypse", the Gemini twins defend against another giant cockroach.

José would die from Granny throwing him to a helicopter blade.
-   Darkwing Duck spends the end of "Planet of the Capes" this way. So did the villain, until the ray they were using to grow was broken. When you start using astronomical phenomena as melee and thrown weapons, you've put on a little weight.

    -   The 2nd pilot episode, "Big Sister" has DeeDee becoming a giant after consuming one of Dexter's experimental super cookies. Which leads to him using a giant robot in a attempt to stop DeeDee from accidentally wrecking the city.

-   In "One Big Wish" on **Dragon Tales**, Max is tired of being smaller than Emmy and his dragon friends and unable to do certain things. He makes a wish on a wishing well to grow bigger, but doesn't specify a limit. This is what eventually results. He ends up even taller than the parents of the dragon friends, which is quite something, as those characters are so tall they're normally shown on-screen from about the middle of the belly down because they just wouldn't fit in a normal frame.
-   **Duckman** ate a combination of odd chemicals that caused him to grow whenever he got angry. Duckman being Duckman, by the end he was taller than a two-story house, and went to a deserted island so his anger wouldn't hurt himself or anyone else. While he was isolated, his depression shrank him to mouse size, but he had no frame of reference, so he couldn't tell.
-   **DuckTales (1987)**:
    -   One episode was called "Attack of the 50-Foot Webby".
    -   "A DuckTales Valentine": The towering Vulcan shows up to attack Scrooge toward the end of the episode.

-   **Futurama**:
    -   Spoofed in the What If? episode, with Bender coming to earth as a 500-foot version of his regular self, and Dr. Zoidberg being supersized to battle him. (The spoof aspect comes when Zoidberg is seduced by power and begins destroying the city himself — "Ah, the famed Apollo theater. "Boo" **me** off stage on Open-mic night, huh? I'll show you!")
    -   Played straight in the episode "Benderama", wherein a 50-foot nerd attacks New New York City.
-   Oberon in **Gargoyles** makes himself gigantic when trying to kidnap Alexander Xanatos.

It's agreed they can stay together, without Lenny being shrunk.

-   **The Hill Farm**: The bear is **gigantic**. It's bigger than the barn that all the humans and livestock hide in.
-   Ultra-Pipi from the **Invader Zim** episode "Hamstergeddon". He even gets back ridge-plates and atomic breath after demolishing a nuclear power plant. And somehow a cybernetic foot. (Because it looks cool, presumably.)
    -   Professor Membrane also warns that altering the timestream will cause a giant fish in a bear suit to rampage through Tokyo.
-   Happens to Jade in the **Jackie Chan Adventures** episode "Little Valmont, Big Jade" as she tries to cast a spell to become older and instead becomes huge. Her destruction, however, is limited to a demolition zone as she battled a giant ogre conjured by the Big Bad. Also see Po Kong the Mountain Demon, who is Exactly What It Says on the Tin. Tohru, in reference to this, becomes one briefly too.
-   The 'music video' to "I Am A Giant" from **Jem** has a giant Pizzazz parodying **King Kong**. The song itself is an egotistical song instead of literally being about a giant.
-   In the **Johnny Bravo** cartoon "Jumbo Johnny", an overdose of protein shakes made Johnny fat, and enough of them eventually made him grow to a gigantic height.
-   In Episode 102 of **Kaeloo**, the characters use pages from books to turn themselves into whatever the books are about, and Mr. Cat and Stumpy use a copy of Gulliver's Travels to turn themselves into giants.
-   **Kim Possible**:
    -   In "Rufus vs. Commodore Puddles", a fifty-foot naked mole-rat squares off against an equally large French poodle, in combat at Area 51. The garrison there kept giant, truck-mounted dog whistles and bombers full of dog biscuits available for just that situation. "Full frontal assault by giant canine. That's a forty-one stroke five-S scenario."
    -   The credits for the first three seasons have a brief clip of a scene (that never appeared in the show) of a gigantic Shego battling Kim (or perhaps a miniaturized Kim battling a normal-sized Shego).
-   As usual, Tex Avery played this trope to the hilt in **King Size Canary**, in which a bird, cat, dog, and mouse enlarge themselves by drinking Jumbo-Gro plant food. The cartoon ends with the cat and mouse standing over a basketball-sized Earth.
-   **Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts**: Mega-Mutes are bigger than most buildings and are some of the few animals that still act like animals. They usually have quite a few extra appendages, like leg, ears and/or noses. Towards the end of the first season it turns out Kipo is able to transform into a Mega-Jaguar due to her parents' genetic experiments. And halfway through season 2 the Mega-Monkey is revealed to be her mother suffering from Shapeshifter Mode Lock.
-   From **The Legend of Korra**, after fusing with Vaatu to become a Dark Avatar, Unalaq grows to gigantic size, goes to Republic City, and starts wreaking havoc. Korra does the same thing, but she does this to fight against her corrupt uncle in a massive final showdown.

-   **Muppet Babies (1984)**:
    -   In one episode, the gang are pretending to have a magic lamp and take turns making wishes. Gonzo wishes he had a "great, big kiss from Piggy", but what he gets is a kiss from a **great, big Piggy**.
    -   In an earlier episode, Piggy is a giant dough monster attacking a city. Bunsen tries to stop her with his Beast Blaster, but Beaker gives him a **yeast** blaster by mistake, which makes her bigger still. They make Gonzo bigger to stop her, but the two just end up falling in love.
-   In the **Muppet Babies (2018)** episode, "Animal Kong", Animal gets upset when he can't play his drums during quiet time, and he becomes Animal Kong, a gigantic version of himself. It's up to the other babies to calm him down and try to get him back to his normal self.
-   In the **My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic** episode "Secret of My Excess", Spike undergoes an abnormal growth spurt when he gets greedy on his birthday and his draconic "hoard-building" instincts kick into overdrive. He ends up the size of a full-grown dragon before finally being brought back to normal.
    -   He's also turned giant in the **Sparkle World** magazine story **The Hero of Ponyville!**, in this case due to having brushed against a magic plant. As a giant baby dragon, he retains his usual appearance (read: the illustrations use resized stock art of regular Spike).

-   On **Phineas and Ferb,** Candace uses a growth potion the boys made in order to grow an extra two inches; it makes her gigantic instead. The episode was aptly called "Attack of the 50-Foot Sister".
-   In the **Pinky and the Brain** episode "Tokyo Grows" Brain enlarges Pinky and himself so that Pinky can disguise himself as Gollyzilla (a parody of Godzilla) and Brain would defeat him in combat so he can be deemed a hero; things don't go as planned when the real Gollyzilla shows up.
-   **Pocoyo**: Parodied in "Poczilla". Pocoyo and Pato find a miniature toy city and pretend to be giant monsters, unaware that they're endangering tiny civilians.

    -   Mecha-Streisanduh!
    -   And Trapper-Keeper Cartman.
    -   And Cthulhu.
    -   Played for laughs with Scott the Dick in "Royal Pudding". At first, it appears to be played straight, but a change in the camera angle reveals that he's actually seven feet tall.
-   There are several **SpongeBob SquarePants** episodes that feature this trope. In one episode Squidward becomes a giant after getting sprayed with plant fertilizer, and in another episode SpongeBob inadvertently becomes a giant after shrinking everybody in Bikini Bottom. Unfortunately, a giant (to them) Plankton is returning from his vacation only to find the inhabitants small enough.
-   **Steven Universe**:
    -   Most of the fusions fall in this category. They're all taller than their component Gems, but some are only tall by human standards (like Garnet, Stevonnie, Rainbow Quartz, and Smoky Quartz), while some are just massive. Opal can carry Steven under her arm, Sugilite is the size of a building, Sardonyx is as tall as Sugilite but narrower, and Alexandrite and Malachite are straight Kaiju-size. "Know Your Fusion" shows that Sardonyx has to squeeze herself to get into the temple door, and she can block it with her hand.
        -   The largest fusion yet seen, Obsidian, is about the size of one of the Diamond Mecha's hands, thus making her bigger than any of the Diamonds, and quite possibly more powerful. She **does** have one of the Diamonds themselves as a component, after all.
    -   This is taken Up to Eleven with the Cluster, an enormous fusion comprised of billions and billions of gem shards, with a diameter comparable to the size of the Empire State Building. Except, that diameter is not the diameter of The Cluster itself, but of its **gem**! Peridot reveals its actual size in "When It Rains".
        
        **Steven:** Peridot, you're saying there's a giant mutant gem the size of the Earth under us **right now**?!  
        **Peridot:** Oh no, when it forms it'll be much, much bigger than the Earth!
        
    -   For non-Fusion examples, the Diamonds. Blue and Yellow Diamond are between 30 to 50 feet tall; at one point Yellow is shown holding two Pearls (who are about human-size) comfortably in her hand. White Diamond, who wasn't seen until near the end of season five, turned out to be even taller than that. Pink Diamond averts this — she's only about twice as tall as Pearl.
-   Apache Chief from **Superfriends**. And Giganta, his arch-enemy. And, if you count **Justice League**, Long Shadow from the Ultimen.
    -   Also from **Justice League Unlimited**, Supergirl once fought a giant fire-breathing turtle creature in Japan. (Its shock of red hair and the way it shrunk when defeated means it might have been a Shout-Out to Jimmy Olsen's Silver Age stint as "Giant Turtle Boy" as well as Bowser and/or Gamera.)
    -   Also from **Superfriends** is the episode "The Giants of Doom". Guess what happens to Bizarro, Sinestro, Captain Cold, and Toyman in that one.
-   In the **Sushi Pack** episode "A Very Big Deal", Ikura is shot by a malfunctioning shrink ray and grows to enormous size, fulfilling his earlier wish to be bigger.
-   In the first **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles** series, Krang became giant using a "molecular amplification unit". The Turtles entered his body to disable the device, and return him to normal.
    -   In the same show, exposure to a meteor from space turned April's nerdy work-mate Irma into a giant in the episode "Attack of the 50 Foot Irma".
    -   How about when Donatello became huge and fought a giant ape?
    -   In **Turtles Forever**, the Utrom Shredder, having applied Krang's technology to his own exosuit, does this in the final battle.
-   **The Tick vs. Dinosaur Neil**, in which a paleontologist in a dinosaur costume turns into the real thing after mistaking prehistoric genetic material for pasta salad. One scientist who bears more than a slight resemblance to Dr. Strangelove wanted Niel to put on some pants. So he made a giant pair of pants and planned to have the army lure Neil to the pants so he could put them on. The pants caught on fire before anything could be done with them.
    -   A later episode had the series' Big Bad Chairface Chippendale using a pill to turn Neil back into a dinosaur on his wedding night.
-   This episode of Tiny Toon Adventures has a giant Elmyra hugging a building.
-   There was also the **Totally Spies!** episode "Attack of the 50 Ft. Mandy". Here, Mandy is subject to this, and Clover became also a giantess to stop her.
-   **The Transformers**: Now granted, your average Cybertronian is generally around 20 feet tall to begin with, but some of the larger 'bots like Metroplex and Fortress Maximus made them look tiny by comparison. Taken Up to Eleven with Primus and Unicron, who transform into **planets.**
-   Happened once in **Trollz**. Dragon vs. Fifty-Foot Kitty.
-   In "Frookie Sitting" from **True and the Rainbow Kingdom**, the magical flower first turns the puppy Frookie into five Frookies. After this problem is fixed, it ends up working its magic again, this time making her into a giant dog.
-   The Woody Woodpecker short **Woody the Giant Killer**.
-   Eileen from **WordGirl** increases in size if she does not get what she wants, and she even grew taller than a skyscraper in the episode "The Birthday Girl".
-   There was an episode of **Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!** called "Attack of the 50-Foot Fleegle," featuring an animal called a fleegle that would grow in size when given candy.
