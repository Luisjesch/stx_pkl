Autocannibalism: 
_"left hand washes the right don't let your left hand know what your right hands doing  
one potato two potato three potato four we got a refrigerator with a store-more door hahaha.  
Who cares, this hand or that. good food good meat good God let's eat.  
lady fingers they taste just like lady fingers"_

How do you take the already-disturbing concept of cannibalism and make it even more screwed up? Why, by making the diner what's also being served, of course!

The reason why someone makes a meal of themselves tends to fall under one of the following three categories:

-   an extreme last resort due to imminent starvation
-   a form of Cold-Blooded Torture inflicted upon someone by a particularly sadistic captor
-   simple insanity

A character eating a clone or duplicate of themselves also counts. Also see I Taste Delicious, which tends to be about characters finding themselves irresistibly delectable after becoming or being covered in food (try to keep examples of that on its page). Some of the more disturbing examples of Let's Meet the Meat (like the image on that page) can involve this. If someone else tricks or forces the character into self-consumption to dispatch of them, it serves as a means of Eating the Enemy where the eater is the enemy themselves.

Your body will also actually do this automatically in the later stages of starvation; breaking down redundant organs and muscle to keep the more vital parts running. Autophagy is a similar process of self-digestion and is naturally carried out by cells to recycle defective or worn-out organelles to get their materials back for later re-use.

Autocannibalism Example in Literature

-   The **Animorphs** novels use this as an aspect of the Taxxon race's Horror Hunger. Though sapient, the extreme harshness of their initial environment caused them to evolve a super-powerful hunger response that neither their own will, nor even infestation by a yeerk, can control it. Whenever Visser Three or Ax turns a Taxxon into Half the Man He Used to Be (which is often, considering that Visser Three is a Bad Boss who doesn't take negative news well), the half with a mouth will instinctively try to eat the other.
-   In Jeff Long's **Deeper**, a monster gets his comeuppance when he's paralyzed from the neck down and left to starve to death in a desolate cavern.

Then gets attacked and killed before he can move anything else, meaning he chewed himself up for nothing.

    -   In book 4 (**Beyond the Blue Moon**), during the first chapter, Hawk and Fisher have to defeat a sorcerer commanding a zombie army and augmented by having a small parasitic demon connected to him. To stop it, Hawk cuts the umbilicus that connects the demon to its host. Denied its source of nourishment, the demon attacks Hawk, jabbing at his throat with the severed cord's end in an attempt to make him its new host. Hawk grabs the cord and jams its end into the demon's own belly, and it sucks itself bodily into its own umbilicus and disappears.

-   **John Dies at the End** has a brief example. The narrator and main protagonist, David, is being haunted by unknown supernatural forces he's managed to upset with his occasional heroism (or maybe he's just crazy), and at one point, he hallucinates a display at a McDonald's warped into a picture of Ronald McDonald eating his own intestines.
    
    **But it was those eyes that got me. His expressive cartoon eyes pulsed with a terror about to boil over into madness. Tears streaked his face, sweat beaded his forehead. Those eyes pleaded with me, looked right into me and screamed to be put out of his misery. Those eyes told a story, not just of a man eating himself, but of a man** being forced **to eat himself. And only I saw it.**
    
-   In the novel **The Journeyer** by Gary Jennings, set in 12th-century China, a section of the book is devoted to the art of torture.

-   Exaggerated in the short story "The Savage Mouth" by Sakyo Komatsu: the unnamed protagonist not only commits this trope out of sheer spiteful perversity, but he takes advantage of cybernetic medical technology to replace each body part as it's removed so he can keep going, cooks each piece with the care and sophistication of a gourmet chef, and records the entire process. When the police find what's left of him — just a skull with a still-working cybernetic jaw and a dead, partially scooped-out brain — they **immediately** destroy the recordings and declare him the victim of a psychopathic Mad Scientist rather than horrify the public with the truth.

Autocannibalism Example in Myths & Religion

-   The Ouroboros is a snake that eats its tail; it represents eternity and perfection and shows up as symbolism in a lot of works.
-   Classical Mythology also has a story of Erysichthon, king of Thessaly, who was punished by the gods for killing a dryad with an insatiable hunger that drove him to poverty, and forced him to wander the lands with just his daughter to help him scam money out of people for food until she finally left him. He then raised his shaking fist to the sky to curse the gods, prompting him to notice how plump, meaty, and juicy his hand looked. The curse placed on him by the gods then evidently made it possible for him to consume his entire body, including his own mouth, which of course had to be eaten last.

-   One of the many, **many** white cards in **Cards Against Humanity** reads "Autocannibalism."
-   **Dungeons & Dragons**:
    -   Trolls are sometimes depicted as doing this if there isn't enough food for them, using their regenerative abilities to heal the damage. Don't think too hard about how this would actually work.
    -   Weaponized by the vaaths, unbelievably sadistic roach-lizards debuting in the **Planescape** setting. Vaaths like to paralyze prey with their poisonous bites, then stick a feeder tendril into their helpless victim to eat them alive. What's worse is that vaaths are natural telepaths able to "broadcast" both the taste and texture of the meal they're eating, as well as their feelings of satisfaction from it. Other creatures subjected to this will take some Wisdom damage from the horrific experience, unless they commonly feed on the same prey the vaath is, but the vaath's victim takes even **more** Wisdom damage from this psychic assault, because "no creature, not even another vaath, is immune to the horror of experiencing what its own entrails taste like."
-   In **Pathfinder**, one of the resident Eldritch Abominations known as the Spawn of Rovagug is Great Doom Chemnosit, whose gaze induces overwhelming violent cannibalistic urges in the victims. If they can't perceive any other victims, they immediately turn on themselves. Chemnosit's modus operandi is to erupt in the hearts of cities and infect the entire population with this madness. Then, when the orgy of mutilation has died down, it devours the survivors.
-   **Princess: The Hopeful:** The Self-Consuming Hunger Caligo lets creatures of the Darkness take resistant damage to generate Willpower to cast other Calignes. This trope is one of the possible explanations for how that works.
-   In **Transhuman Space**, "Clonibalism" (clone-cannibalism) is a whole **thing**, described in **Toxic Memes** as having started out as a way of bringing back traditions of ritual cannibalism.

-   **Bugsnax**: Floofty Fizzlebean cuts off their own leg as part of an experiment to see if eating Bugsnax will regenerate missing limbs. They eat said leg the following night because it had already been turned into strawberries before it was severed, so it's slightly more palatable than a normal Grumpus leg.
-   Parodied in **Cuphead**, as the titular character's brother Mugman drinks the liquid from his own head through his own straw at the start of every boss battle in co-op. Presumably, it just ends up being put back into his head. Which is kind of odd because according to the game's developers, what's inside Cuphead's and Mugman's cups-for-heads are their spiritual essences, or, in other words, their immortal souls.
-   **Darkest Dungeon**: The weakest mooks in The Darkest Dungeon eat the flesh from their arms. This **heals** them since they're eldritch-infested cultists. Cutscenes from The Crimson Courtyard also show a Countess-born vampire's first instinct is to **eat themselves**, and not the other vampires around them.
-   **Dead Island** features the Butcher enemy, rabidly aggressive zombies that have their forearms ending in chewed bone. It's implied that they chewed off their own hands as the virus set in.

-   **Eastern Mind: The Lost Souls of Tong-Nou** has minor character Pang Xie, a crab-like creature who constantly eats his own quickly-regenerating limbs, which are apparently his favorite dish.
-   You can do this in **Eat Me**, but you'll just pop right back.
-   In **Fallen London**, if you choose to Seek Mr. Eaten's Name one of the potential cards you can draw involves you burning down a candle shop. Your character will then attempt to eat their own burning flesh because it smells so delicious.

-   **Moshi Monsters**: Shambles and his species eat their own ears, but it's painless and they grow back so it doesn't matter. Fabio once tried to eat his own teeth, but they tasted bad.
-   In **Plague Inc.**, the Necroa virus can evolve the Autophagia symptom which "compels Infectees to bite and devour their own bodies".
-   In **Sonic Shuffle**, one of the Forcejewels in the game is the Carbuncle, which is really a disguised fairy that eats the other Forcejewels in the inventory of the player who possesses it. Once there are no other Forcejewels left, the Carbuncle will resort to eating itself.
-   The final boss of **'Splosion Man** is a giant monster, made from meat. You trick it into eating its own arms off, leaving it vulnerable to the final killing blow.
-   In **Sunset Overdrive**, Troop Master Bryllcream was trapped in a garbage truck for 16 days without food or water.

-   In **The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt** Geralt feeds a werewolf its own flesh in order to break the curse of lycanthropy.
-   In **Zork**, the command "eat self" returns the message "Autocannibalism is not the answer."

Autocannibalism Example in Webcomics

-   **Awful Hospital**: The door to the Burgrr Zone tries to convince Fern to eat a sloppy joe made of her own body parts. Since the Zone is entirely focused on meat consumption and has a rather hazy understanding of life and death as they apply to humans, it might actually have been intended as a treat for her.
    
    **BBQ Girll:** I do hope the sweet little thing enjoys her complimentary autoconceptual foodmatters!
    
-   **Freefall**: In strip 607:
    
    **Florence:** **\[thinking\]** Winston said when my blood supply rebuilt, I'd wake up feeling hungry.  
    What he didn't explain is that feeling hungry is going to mean "Hope you can make it to the kitchen before you start eating your own appendages."
    
-   **Paranatural**: The "racist whale-frog" invades Max's home, creates a clone out of its own reflection, and then eats the clone. Max, PJ, and Lefty are all appropriately horrified.
    
    **Max:** Okay that's a little out of my comfort zone. Gonna call for some backup.  
    **Alt Text:** A pragmatic ghost hunter would be happy with this turn of events, as the number of foes has decreased.
    
-   In **Unsounded**, Duane has struggled with insatiable Horror Hunger ever since becoming The Undead but hit a low point in his early non-breathing days when his body was literally rotting around him.

Autocannibalism Example in Web Original

-   This happens at the end of the **DEATH BATTLE!** between Omni-Man and Homelander in the "one forces it upon another" fashion. At the start of the fight, Nolan vows to feed Homelander his own heart for murdering Debbie, and he very literally makes good on that promise: The deathblow involves Omni-Man ripping Homelander's lower jaw out of its socket. Then, he rips out Homelander's heart, shoves it into the Supe's forced-open mouth, and makes him 'swallow' by crushing Homelander's head.
    
    **Nolan**: "Remember what I promised you...? **Now swallow.**"
    
-   **Homestar Runner**:
    -   Played for Laughs in the **Strong Bad Email** "island". Strong Bad imagines that in a typical cartoon scenario, if he and Homestar were stuck on a deserted island, Strong Bad might try to eat his own foot at one point.
    -   In the email "interview", Strong Bad claims that being around Homsar for too long makes him start to think "gnawing my own leg off would be a more better way to spend my time."
-   Implied case on **Neopets**. If a Skeith (an omnivorous dragon species of Neopet) were to be painted Biscuit (and given an appearance like it's a sentient cookie), it will appear to have a large bite taken out of its own arm, with a telltale gathering of crumbs around its face, chest and upper belly.
-   **Orion's Arm** has autovory, eating a brain-dead clone of oneself alive while hooked up to the clone's sensory outputs. In some polities, one can buy clones of celebrities for this purpose as well. Or, for a slightly less disturbing example, the setting mentions the practice of cloning pieces of one's own body to eat being a "fad" for a while.
-   The Christmas Episode of **Retarded Animal Babies** had Puppy receive a Gag Penis for Christmas as a present from Satan Claus, and as a result, he sucks on it until he explodes.

-   **SCP Foundation**:
-   In **Smirvlak's Stone**, Lorko Maeliss is repeatedly (and rightfully) called out by Karlnok for his various actions getting most of the Yellow Fang tribe killed.

-   Used in **Zero Punctuation** to describe a level of absurd, maddening frustration caused by unfair game design paired with having victory snatched away at the last moment. This puts it more into the third category, representing insanity as brought on by anger. Notable for having Yahtzee's avatar visibly gnawing on his own foot with a fair bit of blood but **not** having removed it first and the 'crazy' expression as shown in his stick-figure sort of style.

    **Dr. Weird:** (**with his hand behind his back**) My ass has finally decided to eat MY HAND! (**sharp convulsion**) IT HUNGERS... FOR MORE!  
    (**Dr. Weird's entire body gets sucked into itself until there's nothing left but a small ball of flesh with a piece of Dr. Weird's muumuu sticking out**)  
    **Steve:** (**back on the phone**) ...Uh, yeah, just the one hoagie.
    
-   An early episode of **Beast Wars** had Dinobot dispose of a fully biological clone of himself by eating it.
    
    **Dinobot:** I'm afraid he's gone for good. A shame, really. He was such a handsome creature...and quite tasty. (Flicks a small leftover piece from his teeth to Optimus Primal's face.)

        **Homer:** You see how she is, doc? Always negative. She makes me feel like nothing.

    -   In an **Itchy & Scratchy Show** short, Itchy (disguised as a restaurant employee) serves Scratchy his own belly. The unknowing Scratchy's attempt at eating it only results in the bits of it he swallows popping back out of a hole cut in it.
-   **SpongeBob SquarePants**:
    -   Played for Laughs in "Graveyard Shift" when Squidward tells SpongeBob a Ghost Story, prompting SpongeBob to bite his nails.

-   One horrific case of child abuse in Gloucester, Virginia, revealed a 6-year-old girl starving in a filthy cage made from a crib and a piece of plywood stuck on top. She was so hungry (she'd only ever be fed Pop Tarts or sandwiches twice a day at the very most) **she was eating flakes of her own dead skin.** Fortunately, she's far better off now and eating real food. Her parents, Brian and Shannon Gore, have been sentenced to 30 years in prison.
-   A female octopus ceases to hunt while guarding and tending her eggs, typically dying of starvation around the time they hatch. If she's already underweight when the eggs are laid, she may consume one or more of her own arms to sustain herself long enough that the eggs aren't left undefended.
