Addled Addict: 
"When I was sober, my family loved me. And my hat wasn't blue..."

_"I need morphine! Is it true that my eyes are like buttons? I feel gripes inside my belly, as if I am filled with straw."_

When a drug addict is left a physical and mental wreck from their addiction to drugs or alcohol. The signs are typically what they would be in real life; their visage noticeably deteriorates, they are increasingly unreliable and regularly fail to meet obligations, are often visibly drunk or strung out and, if they are on drugs, may be associating with sketchy and often dangerous people, and are also prone to theft, scams, and scheming to acquire money to feed their habits. The decline is often documented as a way of showing Drugs Are Bad and may be the focus of a Very Special Episode. This is distinct from the Functional Addict (who is still capable of accomplishing the tasks of everyday life), but the Functional Addict may reach this state. In cynical works, this can be the endpoint of a Descent into Addiction character arc.

Also distinct from The Alcoholic (where the character trait is simply that they are usually drunk), but there definitely can be overlap.

The Logical Extreme is someone being killed by their addiction, often a Long-Lost Uncle Aesop so that none of the main cast needs to die. If they get support and have great Heroic Willpower, they may become a Recovered Addict.

He doesn't even seem to know he just nearly murdered someone when Diana disarms him and rescues the cop, and the cop is furious — her shoulder was injured because Diana was trying to help both of them and she sees the junkie as beyond help.

Addled Addict Example in Fan Works

-   **Codex Equus** has Moon Ray Vaughoof. Moon Ray's entry notes that he consumed so much drugs and alcohol that his judgement and music-playing were severely impeded, and he became prone to making dumb choices. When he started having prophetic nightmares about himself drowning in water no matter how hard he tried to swim up, Moon Ray tried suppressing them with **more** alcohol, and he later collapsed and nearly died on tour as a result. Both doctors and Zebra musician Smooth Neck predicted he wouldn't live long to the age of forty (which came true, but in a different way) because of how much he damaged himself with his habits. Fortunately, Moon Ray's near-death experience motivated him to clean himself up and cut out all the toxic people in his life, including his wife at the time, Crystal Light, whom he divorced after discovering her unsavory traits. Meeting Velvet Heart, his fiancée and later wife, made him swear off alcohol and drugs completely, and he was a completely Recovered Addict by the time of his death. His presence in the Fourth Age as an Alicorn god implies he has been sober for **over tens of thousands of years**.

-   Happens to Matt in the **It Matters** collection of **Death Note** fanfictions, brought on by Mello's (Canon) decision to leave Wammy's House (and thus Matt) behind without bothering to say goodbye or make contact with him until the (also Canon) explosion. Matt began using drugs (opiates in particular), alcohol, and empty sex (as well as Self Harming) to cope with the pain of losing Mello. When they are reunited, he starts on a path to recovery by Going Cold Turkey. He is **mostly** successful, though he does fall Off the Wagon every now and again, which does put a strain on his marriage to Mello.
-   In the **Laying Waste To Halloween**, Annabeth becomes addicted to drugs, which have both physical and mental side effects. She has sores on her mouth from the drugs and she's started to disassociate and not be **there**.
-   In **Their Bond**, Link is a Shell-Shocked Veteran and former Child Soldier who took to alcohol and illegal potions to help calm his demons. After finding out about the drug usage, Impa considers him a danger to Zelda because Link already holds too much power while sober, nevermind if he isn't in the right mind.
-   Discussed in **Empty Arms**. Slade notes that Laurel has a sharp mind, and that he's grateful she dulled it for the past few months with alcohol, giving everyone else cause to doubt her. After arranging for him to arrested by the Australian government, she throws this back in Oliver's face:
    
    **Oliver:** He might tell them my identity when they question him. Sara’s, too.
    
    **Laurel:** And what reason would they have to believe him? He’s been high on some drugs for half a decade. As you may recall, the word of an addict isn’t taken all that seriously.
    
-   **What It Takes**: It is indicated that if Quentin was drinking less, he'd be able to recognize that Darhk is a villain. It's also preventing him from doing his job effectively. In Chapter 9, he tries to draw his gun on Laurel (again), only for her to flatly state "You're too drunk to aim".

In fact, not having Jules around quickly results in his death.
-   While all the main characters in **Requiem for a Dream** have their lives destroyed by their drug addiction, for three of them it's the things they do in an attempt to feed their addictions rather than the effects of the drugs themselves that do them in (although Harry loses his arm to gangrene).

Addled Addict Example in Literature

His handler **actually hides** the herb in question and then gives it back to him as "reward" for carrying out assassinations.

-   **Discworld**:

-   **The Confessions of Frannie Langton**: Frannie is addicted to laudanum, like her mistress/girlfriend Marguerite. This explains why she had slept through Marguerite's parents murders without stirring.

She is so dependent on pills that at one point, she implores Adèle for assistance because she is no longer able to convince the school doctor to issue her any kind of downers.
-   **Miami Vice** has quite a few, but the worst is probably Yvonne from "Too Much, Too Late," who lets her dealer rape her adolescent daughter in exchange for crack.

    -   **Star Trek: Picard**: We learn more about Raffi's backstory in "Stardust City Rag".

When we find her, she is surrounded by Med-X needles, implying death by overdose.

-   In **Far Cry 5**, Bliss is a powerfully psychoactive drug that, in addition to its euphoric effects, can be used to condition and brainwash people.

He typically alternates between begging for more drugs and conjuring up food to satisfy his own munchies (when asked why he doesn't just conjure up drugs for himself too, he broke down in tears, apparently having never thought of this before). During one of his drug-fueled incoherent ramblings, he reveals that he just wants to grant wishes and make people happy, but can't, because some Jerkass wished him into his current state, and then made a **second** wish to make the first wish **irreversible**, purely For the Evulz.

    -   Sarah Lynn is a great example from a TV show about a horse.

She died at only 31 years old after nine months of sobriety due to a heroin overdose.
        
        **BoJack:** Well you should... not... do that. \[contact one of the billion people who **will** let her party at their house\]  
        **Sarah Lynn:** Oh, I know. I know, but I can, so I will. I'm at a point in my life where I don't have to "grow as a person" or "rise to an occasion," so I can just keep surrounding myself with sycophants and enablers until I die tragically young.  
        **BoJack:** Wh-what?  
        **Sarah Lynn:** Yeah, it's pretty much too late for me.
        
    -   Season 5 sees BoJack himself get hooked on opiates after a stunt goes wrong and, rather than allow him time to recover fully, is pressured back onto the set of **Philbert** to keep filming the first season. This leads to him driving into traffic when he runs out of his medication in the hopes of getting more at the hospital and, in the penultimate episode of the season, **strangling his costar** because he could no longer discern between reality and fiction. And the finale reveals he has **no** memory of what he'd done, only finding out after watching the footage.
-   **Captain Planet and the Planeteers**: "Mind Pollution" involves Skumm making and dealing a drug called "Bliss." Befitting its Drugs Are Bad message, it portrays all addicts who get any significant screen time as pretty messed up (to say the least).
    -   Linka's cousin Boris starts out as a charming teenager but has undergone a Descent into Addiction offscreen by the time he appears. His father is worried about him; he calls Linka (his favorite cousin) names after she tries to take his drugs away and tells Skumm that he'll steal her power ring in exchange for more. When Skumm tells him to bring Linka instead, he balks, but the threat of being cut off leads him to drug Linka with contaminated food. Ultimately, he overdoses and dies on screen.
    -   Linka herself goes from a driven young woman to a haggard mess who only cares about getting her next fix. When Gi tries to keep her from taking another pill, Linka attempts to blow her off the roof of the Capitol building (which is luckily circumvented by the cloudiness of her mind in a drugged state). She only manages to yank herself out of it after seeing her cousin overdose and ends the episode in withdrawal.
    -   The background Bliss addicts are perfectly willing to do anything Skumm asks to keep taking the drug, from giving him everything of value that they have to attacking a group of teenagers.
-   Dr. Rockzo, the deranged "Rock-and-Roll Clown" from **Metalocalypse**, has cocaine addiction as one of his primary character traits. He was once a famous rock star, but has since deteriorated into a drug-addicted mess.
