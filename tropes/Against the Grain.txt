Against the Grain: 
_"No, no, no_ (No, no, no)

_Stick to the stuff you know_

_If you wanna be cool_

_Follow one simple rule_

_Don't mess with the flow, no no_

_Stick to the status quo!"_

Every protagonist has a goal in a story. It's elemental to plot-building, character development and establishing genre. But in stories where the character is just one of many similar beings (in a colony, a company or other collectives), one of the most effective ways to make them stand out is to disregard stereotypes and class traits.

Against the Grain entails plots where a character doesn't want to follow social expectations. There may be years of cultural standards, evolved traits or requirements that create a consistent idea of their kind. But the protagonist, unlike the others, doesn't _want_ to fit into this mold. They seek something completely different, much to their peers' disappointment. The trope commonly has older, more conservative members judging the character for their radical behaviour. These guardians could be strict fathers or controlling mothers who are Knight Templar Parents or conservative elders who have their heads in the sand. An exaggerated example similar to this is Individuality Is Illegal.

The character wanting to be an individual is usually rewarded for their behaviour, and may even spark change across their society. Those who refused change or were against it are thus depicted as foolish and closed-minded, and often receive comeuppance for resisting change. Parents in the trope may realise they need to stop dictating their offspring's behaviour, and start accepting their independence.

The trope can sometimes be political in nature, most commonly about gender roles. A woman may find expectations of her gender restricting, so she defies everyone else and chooses her own path. In childrens' films especially, the alienation of being different may be an allusion to racism or homophobia.

Another iteration of the trope is that someone is _incapable_ of doing a certain task, and the plot is either about them reckoning with their inabilities _or_ about their journey to accomplish their destined tasks. The attitudes around the character usually still remained however. They may be bullied for their differences, and family members might feel helpless or embarrassed about the character's failures.

The trope is used frequently in children's animated films. This is perhaps to inspire young audiences to go against societal expectations. Be Yourself is arguably the most utilised Aesop in children's films, and it's simple enough for young viewers to understand. The trope could also relate to a child's resistance to their parent's wishes for them; children often feel alienated by their parents because of age-gaps, tastes in pop culture and differing talents or attributes. Animals feature in the trope in numerous examples, likely because animals have clear-cut behavioural traits, and seeing them defy these traits creates a comedic effect. They are also easily animated and well-liked among children.

Compare with I Am What I Am, Deliberate Values Dissonance, Screw Destiny, Calling the Old Man Out, Square Race, Round Class, Jackie Robinson Story, and Painful Persona. Supertrope to Anti Anti Christ.

Against the Grain Example in Advertising

-   In an ad for the grain-based chip Grain Waves, an anthropomorphic young boy grain wants to grow up to be a chip, despite his father telling him that grains don't grow up to be chips, and everyone else in his family growing up to be bread (except for his uncle, who was porridge). The grain sticks to his dream and becomes the first Grain Waves chip, only to be eaten.

Against the Grain Example in Anime & Manga

-   **The Legend of Sun Knight**: This turns out to be the case for just about all of the Knights, who are chosen early in childhood by the current Knight as a replacement. Not just in skill, appearance and ability, the Knights are forced to adopt the personalities, likes, dislikes and even relationships of the original Knights to preserve the sense of continuity of their organization.
    -   Sun is forced to act as a Chaste Hero, be best buddy to Earth Knight (they sabotage each other's flirtation attempts whenever they see each other), an alcoholic who pretends to faint after three cups, can use all magical elements but has to restrict himself to Light, and is best friends with Judgement Knight but has to show polite contempt as the originals couldn't stand each other.
    -   Storm Knight is a Casanova flirting with every woman he sees and skipping out on his duties. In reality he's a workaholic spymaster (and still a virgin).
    -   Stone Knight is easygoing but is supposed to be stubborn,

-   **The Sword of Paros**: Both Ermina and Fiona are opressed because they won't fit in the local society. Ermina likes dressing like a man, fencing and riding horses, instead of being "feminine" (for a noblewoman, that means obsessing over her appearance and talking about trivialities like hunks and sweets). Fiona, in turn, is ridiculed and mistreated by her class colleagues for daring to dream about a prince charming, although she is a poor orphan with no future.
-   **Revolutionary Girl Utena**: Utena has a totally tomboy attitude and refuses to wear a girls' uniform even before the Academy Ohtori. In the manga, she explains she prefers a boys' uniform because she loves jumping fences and running, and she hates that the boys are always trying to see the girls' panties. The teachers, of course, don't buy any of this. They sigh in relief when Utena suddenly dresses a girl uniform and starts behaving as a Proper Lady after she loses Anthy for Touga. And the boys... in the manga version, they practically throw themselves over the new, 'feminine' Utena! Nobody see (or care) that she's suffering a Heroic BSoD; fortunately, Wakaba snaps Utena out of this.
-   Sacrificial Princess & the King of Beasts: Leonhart was raised to be a proper king, which meant to marry a princess, keep the status quo and follow the royal traditions, like the human sacrifice. Instead, he fights discrimination and tries to give equal treatment to all the beasts, independent of their clan or race. He nominates Jormungand, who was rejected for being a reptile, to be his captain and secretly lets the girls brought to be sacrificed to run away. And he decides to marry Sariphi, a human, scandalizing the entire kingdom.

-   **Hellboy**: Just about every supernatural creature Hellboy meets tells him he (and more specifically his hand) will bring forth the Apocalypse.

-   This is Acerola's main source of angst in **Infinity Train: Crown of Thorns**. The ghosts of her ancestors constantly pester her to try keep the Alolan royal family legacy alive, despite that being something she has no interest in.

-   **Junior Officers**: As revealed in "Margaret's Story", Humphrey always wanted Margaret, his tomboyish daughter, to be more feminine. He expected her to take part in women's sports and forced her to quit her job so she could work at home. However, she never accepted this and always fought back against him. Ultimately, on the day of her sixteenth birthday, Margaret lost her temper and gave Humphrey a massive "The Reason You Suck" Speech for never letting her follow her dreams. At age eighteen, she moved out and decided to never speak to him again, and she became the leader of a Girl Guides group.

-   **Disenchantment**:
    -   In the first episode, Rebellious Princess Bean does everything in her power to escape from an Arranged Marriage. Instead, she prefers wearing pants, drinking and getting into all kind of trouble.
    -   All the citizens of Elfwood must produce candies and be cheerful all the time. Elfo gets sick of this because he wants be sad or happy in his own terms.
    -   Oona underwent an Arranged Marriage to a man that never loved her and insulted her. She gave him a male heir and tried to be a proper queen for a court that rejected her because she is a Dankmirian. In the season 2, she gave up and became a pirate queen.
-   **The Owl House**: A very recurrent theme in the series.
    -   Starting with Luz Noceda, who decided to spend some time at the Boiling Islands and follow her dream of becoming a witch instead of going to a camp that supposed to teach kids how to be "normal" (it didn't work for Vee's friends). In the first episode, she frees from the Conformatorium people imprisoned there because of their quirks (like writing fanfics about food in love), repeating Eda's phrase "Weirdos must stick together." In "First Day", she rebels against studying only one kind of magic and meets other kids who study secretly what they want. They eventually convince Principal Bump to allow all the students to learn whatever they liked, and that makes them strong enough to defeat the Emperor's Coven and save Hexside in "Labyrinth Runners".
    -   Eda Clawthorne spent years running away from Belos' coven and her sister because she didn't want to join them nor have her magic sealed.
    -   Amity Blight was once forced to break up with Willow, her best friend, and have friends she hated but her parents considered suitable. They also expected her to join the coven when she was old enough, and she dyed her hair green like her mother. After befriending Luz and the rest of the owl gang, she learns she can be appreciated without having to follow others' expectations: she becomes Luz' girlfriend, dyes her hair purple, refuses to join the cover and makes friends with Willow again.
    -   Steve defects from the Emperor's Coven because he's tired of scaring and oppressing other people.
    -   King refuses to be treated like a god just because he is a titan.

    -   Bows' parents expect him to become a historian like them. Instead, he practices archery, builds gadgets and join the Rebellion.
    -   Frosta was sternly educated to rule the Ice Kingdom and was not allowed to have a childhood or friends; also, her kingdom had a neutral position towards the war. She joins the Alliance against the Horde, makes friends, develops a cheerful side and enjoys smacking robots.
    -   Played with Entrapta. Because of her autism and of the years she spent isolated, she is socially awkward at the point of wearing her usual, greasy stained clothes in Princess Prom, and frequently annoyes the other members of the Alliance with her quirks and love for science (and yet, they tolerate her because they need her scientific knowledge. Talk about Hypocrisy). She feels a lot happier in the Horde because she can be whoever she is there, as much as what they do is wrong, and her experiences with rejection makes it possible for her be empathetic to Hordak's issues. After Entrapta is brought back to the Alliance, she truly tries to atone, but feels forced to repress her quirks (a little). She loosens up during the trip to space, where her friends are very dependent of her habilities to survive (also, they are too busy to pick on her).
    -   Hordak is mistreated by Horde Prime for having shown initiative and given himself a name; he has his memories stolen and all his displays of personality (including clothes and hair color) washed away to become a living puppet. He hides the crystal Entrapta gave to him and, with it, the small memories he recovered; and, in the end, shoots Horde Prime, telling him he's not just a regular clone, claiming back his name and his will.
