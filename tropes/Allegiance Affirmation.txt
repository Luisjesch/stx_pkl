Allegiance Affirmation: 
Where a character's true loyalties lie aren't necessarily clear and/or obvious, especially in works with more than one Anti-Hero and/or Anti-Villain. Perhaps this character previously fell under Hazy-Feel Turn, and/or Heel–Face Revolving Door. Maybe they've decided to take a side. Or maybe they want to make a statement, Sudden Principled Stand or otherwise. Either way, this trope is when they actively and explicitly confirm where their loyalties lie, whether through their words, and/or actions.

One common variant involves someone getting thrown out of (or otherwise leaving) a group. They join another group, initially - but not necessarily - reluctantly, but gradually grow to enjoy being part of their new group. Then, their old group tries to welcome them back - only for them to reject their former group, affirming that they now belong with their new group.

Another variant involves a Double Reverse Quadruple Agent finally making it clear which side they ultimately work for.

A third variant involves a Heel–Face Turn (or more rarely, a Face–Heel Turn) being cemented. May result in a Heel–Face Door-Slam, or otherwise come back to bite the one invoking this trope.

Related to Initiation Ceremony, wherein a ceremony or ritual is used to affirm one's loyalty to a group. In some situations, declaring your allegiance can prove deadly, making it a Dying Moment of Awesome.

Compare If You're So Evil, Eat This Kitten!, Insignia Rip-Off Ritual, and Smash the Symbol. Contrast Heel–Face Revolving Door. Super-Trope to Shoot Your Mate. Can occasionally (but not necessarily) overlap with Deadly Graduation and overlaps more often with Shut Up, Hannibal!.

Note that this trope does not apply to reveals about one's true allegiance in general - this only applies to an active decision by a character to establish where their loyalties lie. Passive reveals (e.g. a character coming across evidence revealing another character's true loyalties, a mole being caught out and forced to reveal themselves, instances of Foreshadowing, etc.), or one character revealing another character's loyalties (deliberately or otherwise), are _not_ this trope. Not to be confused with Allegiant.

Due to the nature of this trope, **unmarked spoilers** lie ahead.

Allegiance Affirmation Example in Anime & Manga

-   **Martian Successor Nadesico**: The crew of the Nadesico have fled the ship, and are being hunted by the military and Nergal. But they have a plan to retake the ship. They stage a strike on the dock where the Nadesico is waiting. Nergal Chairman Akatsuki points out to Erina Wan that the crew won't get far, as they have the master key. The crew board the ship, to find Goat Hoary there. He looks at them, and reaches into his coat (the audience is meant to think he is drawing a gun). Cut to Akatsuki laughing, saying he never even saw it coming, as he thought Hoary was just another "yes-man", holding up a note that Hoary had left saying that he had taken the master key, He had decided to stand with the Nadesico crew rather than with Nergal.
-   **Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V**: Between the Jigsaw Puzzle Plot and the Morality Kitchen Sink, it's difficult to establish the allegiance of several characters at first.
    -   Yugo is initially thought by basically everyone to be an Academia spy from the Synchro Dimension, mainly because he looks identical to the guy who kidnapped Ruri, and he fights against Yuto (Ruri's boyfriend) quite viciously. However, halfway through the Maiami Championship arc he's seen fighting **against** Academia. The beginning of the Synchro arc reveals his true allegiance: he doesn't have one. Instead he saw his friend Rin getting kidnapped by a guy who looked identical to him, and then somehow ended up in Heartland which was invaded by Academia, and so he turned against them in spite - or because - he had no real clue what was going on. He chooses to side with the Lancers, who are against Academia.
    -   Sora was initially an extremely loyal Academia soldier who was sent on a mission to spy on the Standard Dimension and LDS. However, while he's there he grows close to Yuzu, Yuya and the others and teaches them Fusion Summoning. As a result, he is extremely conflicted when the Professor - the leader of the Academia - orders him to capture several people including Yuzu, and tries to bring back Serena in exchange for her. Yuya points out that this won't work - creating more doubts — and eventually Sora pulls a last minute Heel–Face Turn, introducing himself to Crow as one of Yuya's friends and giving him information, and later fighting against Academia's Mooks along with Tsukikage even though he carded his brother in an earlier episode.
    -   Jean Michel Roget initially appears to be an Academia spy stationed in the Synchro Dimension, which is further emphasized by reveals such as having no background information, introducing Real Solid Vision technology and later on adding Fusion cards to a cop's deck. However, he also seems oddly nervous when Fusion summoning is brought up in any context, and he doesn't deliver Yuzu and Serena to the Academia even though he has the locations of both of them (he even **arrests** Serena). Eventually he reveals that he betrayed Academia and now he's out for himself.
    -   Shinji Weber first appears as a friend of Crow's who's not too sure about the Lancer's claims to be from another dimension but rolls with it due to circumstances. However, it turns out that his real allegiance can be boiled down to "the only ones who deserve to live are the Commons, fuck the Tops". He then rallies the Commons and turns against **everyone** despite of being repeatedly told that there are bigger and more immediate problems, because he thinks that anyone who doesn't agree with him must be in allegiance with the Tops. He even turns against Crow, who tells him that his actions will only lead to a Full-Circle Revolution.
    -   Another ambiguous figure in the Commons vs Tops conflict is Jack Atlas, who was originally of the Commons but rose to the rank of the Tops thanks to his dueling skills. He's a Base-Breaking Character In-Universe, as half the Commons think he is a Class Traitor, while the others think he is someone to look up to. Jack's Stoic, Jerkass personality and cryptic gestures and comments don't help. Eventually it's revealed that Jack was one for **unity** between the classes and that he never forgot his Commons roots. However, his gestures only had a real meaning to **him**, and even though he's a Jerk with a Heart of Gold and a Stealth Mentor, most people never picked up on it because he only clearly showed the "jerk" part. He only clearly confirms his alliance when he duels against Sergei, who is Roget's pawn, and even **then** people have their doubts. It takes his duel with Yuya to affirm to the Commons that he's a good guy.

-   The current page image for Even Evil Has Standards: a Batman/Captain America crossover has the Joker declare to the Red Skull, "I may be a criminal lunatic, but I'm an **American** criminal lunatic!"
-   In the **Villains United** miniseries, the Secret Six are kidnapped by the Society of Supervillains and subjected to brutal torture. However, there's a twist: their captors keep going easy on Scandal, which causes her teammates to wonder if she's been selling them out for better treatment. After they finally manage to escape, Scandal grabs Fatality, one of their guards, bites her ear off, and then swallows it. As Fatality is an Ax-Crazy Blood Knight whose entire schtick is violently avenging slights against her, and therefore Scandal has just made one hell of an enemy, the other Secret Six members quickly decide that she's probably not a traitor.
    
    **Ragdoll:** She makes a compelling case with that ear thing, don't you find?

-   **Codex Equus**: Gicelig does this upon defecting to the Equestrian Pantheon. After leaving the Elternteil Deer Pantheon and making sure the Leymits are running, he publicly apologizes to Blue Suede and Princess Twilight for his peers' actions, then takes off his old armor, freezes it, and shatters it to symbolize his official defection to the Equestrian Pantheon.
-   **The Mountain and the Wolf**: The Wolf makes it fairly clear he's not an obedient servant after Daenerys catches him trying to take the Iron Throne away (the reader knows he's been Running Both Sides for quite a while). Downplayed in that he seems honestly confused that she'd be angry at him for that, because he seems to sincerely believe she's a ruthless butcher in the vein of Warhammer Fantasy's Chaos Lords. Daenerys siccing Drogon on him prevents the situation from being cleared up.
-   **Friday Night Funkin': Corruption**: When initially introduced in Week 8's first song, "Tormentor", Soul Boyfriend is set up as the manifestation of The Corruption that's taken control of Boyfriend's body. "Neuroses" throws that into question, as Soul reminds Boyfriend to stay focused when he falters and that the corruption "isn't my doing". "Discharge" firmly establishes Soul as a distinct entity with Boyfriend's best interests in mind; performing a Dynamic Entry and tossing him a guitar, Soul pulls Boyfriend out of his funk and the two play one final duet, ultimately breaking him free from the corruption's control.

Allegiance Affirmation Example in Literature

-   One of **Aesop's Fables** is "The Dilemma of the Bat." Enmity between the birds of the sky and the beasts of the ground was growing, and war seemed imminent. Some birds approached the bat to side with them, but the bat dreaded becoming involved in battle. The bat declined, declaring (on the grounds of having no feathers), "I am a beast." Later, some beasts approached the bat to side with them, but the bat declined, declaring (on the grounds of having wings), "I am a bird." An eleventh hour truce was reached between the two sides, averting warfare. Now, both the birds and the beasts shunned the bat as an outsider, not to be trusted. "Better to choose sides and risk enemies, than to remain aloof and have no friends," he lamented.
-   **Animorphs**: As Ax usually fights in his own Andalite body while the rest of the team use terrifying animals, the Yeerks speculate that it's done to announce that the "Andalite bandits" are here, and possibly that he can't morph like the others. The former is correct, as it helps fuel the impression that they're all Andalites instead of mostly humans.
-   In the **Circle of Magic** books, Daja is exiled from her people and ends up at a temple where she begins studying smithing magic, which she wouldn't be allowed to do in her culture, and becomes part of a very close group of friends. When she gets a chance to rejoin her people, she declines, saying she's changed too much to go back.
-   This, combined with a helping of Bad Guys Do the Dirty Work, is how Tywin Lannister justified carrying out The Purge of House Targaryen in the backstory of **A Song of Ice and Fire**. Tywin and his considerable forces had stayed neutral all throughout a Civil War, until he saw that Rebel Leader Robert Baratheon not only won a key battle but also killed Prince Rhaegar. Tywin knew he had to act swiftly both to endear himself to the new regime and also to save his son Jaime, who was an implicit hostage in the King's Praetorian Guard. So Tywin rushed his army to the capital (which was also the last major Targaryen stronghold), convinced them that the Lannisters had come to join them, then promptly sacked the city and killed every member of House Targaryen they could get their hands on, most notably Rhaegar's young children, who would have otherwise been potential rivals for the throne that diehard Targaryen loyalists (or ambitious lords looking to use them in a Puppet King fashion) might have rallied behind.
    
    We had come late to Robert's cause. It was necessary to demonstrate our loyalty. When I laid those bodies before the throne, no man could doubt that we had forsaken House Targaryen forever. And Robert's relief was palpable. As stupid as he was, even **he** knew Rhaegar's children had to die if his throne was ever to be secure. Yet he saw himself as a hero, and heroes do not kill children.
    
-   **Harrow the Ninth**: The God-Emperor demands that everyone present in the climax declare whether or not they're loyal to him, including people who've served at his side for ten thousand years. His oldest companion answers, "No, John", and teleports the entire Space Station into The Underworld in a last-ditch attempt to kill him for his crimes.
-   **Harry Potter**: Severus Snape pulls one of these during Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, finally confirming where it is that his loyalties ultimately lie.
    
    **Dumbledore:** After all this time?  
    **Severus Snape:** Always.
    
-   **Watership Down**:
    -   Bigwig is battling General Woundwort in the runs of the warren on Watership Down. The General offers Bigwig a position in his own Owsla, "the Mark of his choice" if he'll surrender. That fails. Then he tells Bigwig that he had enough rabbits to bring down the wall in four places, so why doesn't he just come out. Bigwig's response fills Woundwort with terror, as he had assumed Bigwig was the Chief.
        
        **Bigwig:** My Chief Rabbit has told me to defend this run and until he says otherwise I shall stay here.
        
    -   This is important for two reasons. First, at the beginning of the novel, Bigwig had said that he would never call Hazel his Chief, but here, in a life or death battle, he says it without hesitation. Also, Woundwort can't conceive of a warren where the Chief would be more clever than strong, so he immediately assumes that someone bigger and stronger than Bigwig is waiting for him, even if he finishes Bigwig off. The conviction of his allegiance to Hazel, though, is so intense that it breaks the spirits of all the other rabbits from Efrafa who had come to take down the warren at Watership Down.

Shortly thereafter, poor Cubby dies, and while his final moments are attended by his biological mother and most of his former House siblings, he still effectively dies without being attached to a House. Incensed by Lemar's callous treatment of his longtime brother, his former House Mother Elektra rallies all of her surviving children to join the dormant House of Evangelista, led by Blanca, so that they can challenge the House of Khan and knock them down a peg. Consequently, they all adopt (or in some cases, re-adopt) the surname Evangelista to show their affiliation, even Elektra, despite this technically making her a subordinate to Blanca (who started out as a daughter in Elektra's old House of Abundance.)

    -   In "The Eternal Engineer", when Boki, one of Wilford's staunches supporters, learns that Wilford organized the murders of his fellow breachmen, he approaches Layton and gives him a token that Wilford gave him many years ago, and advises him to shove it up Wilford's ass if he ever gets the opportunity.

And if you disrespect him in my presence again, I will re-dedicate the rest of my life to ruining the rest of yours. And if you think I'm just mouthing at ya, you should ask around about me. I have absolutely no conscience about these things.

        **Picard:** Which requires I now ask you a very serious question. Since the two of you are closely related to each other...  
        **Data:** The answer, sir, is that my loyalty is to you and Starfleet. Completely.  
        **Picard:** Thank you, Commander. I was certain of that.

Allegiance Affirmation Example in Real Life

-   There's the mostly British idiom "Nail ones's colours to the mast," defined as "To clearly show one's support for a side or opinion in a dispute, often indicating an intention to defend that side to the end." This comes from the Age of Sail, where a warship wishing to indicate that they had surrendered would "strike their colors", i.e. lower their national flag. Nailing one's colors to the mast would mean that the officers in question would not surrender **under any circumstances**.
