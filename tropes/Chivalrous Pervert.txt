Chivalrous Pervert: 
**Sophie:** That was very sweet of you, Alex. Especially for a man wearing such tight pants.  
**Alex:** It forces all the blood to my heart.

He can't stop ogling the ladies. But unlike some who ogle the ladies, he actually _cares_ about them as people. Woe betide anyone who wrongs women, for he's watching you like a hawk—when he's not watching them, that is. Undoubtedly the best type of pervert. Always a good guy, and just to reaffirm that he's a good guy, they'll occasionally give him a rival in the form of an actually dangerous pervert who would cross the boundaries the Chivalrous one never could. Such a serious Chivalrous Pervert is very likely to also be an Ethical Slut with a benevolent For Happiness morality. However, it could also be that some part of him might also believe that Sex Is Evil and make him feel guilty about his "immoral" horniness and overcompensate for it by being extra nice. Or his hypersexuality could be an outlet for more complex personal issues, often making him The Woobie.

Compare Handsome Lech, whose morals are a bit more loose but not as much as the villainous perv; Covert Pervert, who is also sympathetic but in no way vocal about their… tastes; and Lovable Sex Maniac, who fulfills the latter half of this page's title but most certainly not the former (though there are examples that do overlap) _and_ tends to go for the Rule of Funny. A Chivalrous Pervert who prefers to spy on those of his preferred gender may be The Peeping Tom. The Dirty Old Man will often be this, or at least act the part, if for no other reason than his being too physically weak to commit sexual atrocities. Also compare his Distaff Counterpart, the Good Bad Girl. May end up setting a girl to Pervert Revenge Mode or even an Unprovoked Pervert Payback. Contrast the Chaste Hero and Sex Is Evil, and I Am Horny.

Chivalrous Pervert Example in Anime & Manga

-   Eita Touga of **12 Beast**. However polite and professional he is, the universe will **always** put him in an awkward situation, within range of violent retribution.
-   Hachibe Maeda of **Ai Kora** is a strange case. While admittedly an individual who values women for the aesthetic appeal of their various body parts, he is willing to go to extreme lengths to protect the owners of those parts.
-   Daisaku of **Albegas**. He shamelessly crawls into a girl's bed during a treasure hunt, and also constantly thinks naughty thoughts about Hotaru. Many episodes have him gawk at porn magazines.
-   Shinsuke Edo, the protagonist of **Amai Seikatsu**, is an interesting case, as the chivalry was effectively forced upon him. Despite being obsessed with women's underwear, his slightest touch sending waves of pleasure through a woman, and the underwear he makes being an extension of his touches, he has practically zero sexual interest in anyone. It's eventually revealed he had a very strict upbringing involving five sisters and a single mother.
-   **Aquarion Evol** has Sazanka, who is nothing but friendly and enthusiastic as she hawks suggestive photos of her classmates.

-   In **Black Clover,** Finral is a Casanova Wannabe and also one of the nicer and more levelheaded guys in the Black Bulls, with his incorrigible flirting in contrast to his low self-esteem. It's eventually revealed that he's in love with his brother's betrothed; when he realizes that he still has a chance with her, he finds it a constant struggle not to flirt with every **other** attractive girl he sees.
-   Shunsui Kyoraku from **Bleach** loves flirting with his lieutenant, Hot Librarian Nanao, and was known for chasing girls during his days at the shinigami academy. He promptly rescues Nanao when she collapses after Yamamoto sends out his **enormous** reiatsu and it overwhelms her. He's also a very badass captain who first tries to convince his rivals to give up on their purposes **and** only accepts to fight so he won't disgrace his opponents.
-   **Booty Royale: Never Go Down Without a Fight!**: Iba is a recurring titty-flick director and Amazon Chaser who once spends a night in jail after filming Misora and Chae Yun-Hui sparring naked in an outdoor bath while they're acting in an action B-movie he's making—but the only reason he was caught was that he rushed in to check if they were all right after the match ended in a Double Knockout. He also knows quite a lot about martial arts and starts giving Misora pointers about her potential opponents' fighting styles during the Tournament Arc.
-   Kurozuma Wataru from **A Certain Scientific Railgun** is a super rare type of guy who can make a sincere comment about a girl's figure (and he does so to two people who are likely to fly off the handle at that) and give no offence. As Misaka and Kuroko said, he commented on their breasts in a strangely unperverted manner <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>.
-   Denji in **Chainsaw Man** is a teenage Loser Protagonist and Lovable Sex Maniac whose primary motivation for working as a Devil Hunter, even more than the fact that they'll kill him if he tries to leave, is the possibility of getting with his female coworkers — especially his boss, Makima. However when Mrs. Robinson Himeno tries sleeping with him while she's drunk, he shoots her down because he felt he'd be betraying Makima's "kindness".
    -   Denji's Cool Old Guy mentor Kishibe is revealed to have been this in his younger years, as he pursued his Sexy Mentor Quanxi for almost a decade before becoming a Broken Ace.
-   Hideki from **Chobits**. Make no mistake, he is an underwear-ogling porn addict, but would never take advantage of Chi in that way. And heaven help you if you do.
-   **City Hunter**:
    -   Ryo Saeba is sometimes this and sometimes just an Handsome Lech. The "chivalrous" part is mainly when he's getting serious. When Ryo gets too close to the women he ogles, his partner Kaori Makimura is always behind him to calm him down in most cartoonishly violent ways by hitting his head with big mallets (which she pulls out of Hammerspace).
    -   Mick Angel also sways between this and Handsome Lech.
-   The deceased Prince Clovis la Britannia from **Code Geass**, who despite being a tyrannical bastard, isn't a misogynist in the least. You'd never guess it if not for the 6th Picture Drama, though: it has his half-sisters, Cornelia and Euphemia, checking on some stuff he left… and Cornelia frets over the sweet and naive Euphemia being willing to wear one **very** revealing swimsuit that Clovis designed in his free time. Milly also has shades of this.
-   **Daimos**: Kazuya isn't above groping his little sister Nana's ass for fun, and also thinks that Cairo's plan to photograph her nude (while bathing) is hilarious.
-   Cross Marian **D.Gray-Man**. His character info in the fanbook, lists one of his likes is "good women." He has no problem hitting on pretty girls, even younger ones like Lenalee. But when he found out about the death of one of his lovers, a young woman named Anita, he was genuinely saddened and despite him not wanting Anita to follow him, he says she was a good woman. It's also stated, by Allen, that under his bed at his church, is filled with keepsakes from his lovers-pictures and accessories. Seems to show a sentimental side to Cross.
    -   With the aforementioned Lenalee, he holds her close, and protects her on the crumbling ark, while simultaneously trying to halt download of the Akuma Egg, but he never lets go of her, until after danger has passed. He also only stayed at the Order, which he hates, because Lenalee asked him to. It ended being a Fatal Flaw.
-   In **Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba**, Zenitsu's colorful rant about women and their curves gave him a bad first impression with the Butterfly Estate girls, but Zenitsu is actually seriously committed to the idea of marrying someone fully intent on loving them, even when it made him suffer, as in the past there were women who entertained him, with bad intentions, like the unknown woman whom Zenitsu had eloped with and piled him with debts, where he had to be rescued by his future swordsman master, prior the beginning of the series.
-   Shoei Jinnai of **Desire Climax** evolves into one of these throughout the Story Arc, albeit most certainly starting off as a bit of an I Have You Now, My Pretty with Mio Omori.
-   **Dragon Ball**: Goku's late Grandpa Gohan is hinted to be quite a ladies' man; when he briefly comes back to life in the Fortuneteller Baba Saga, he mentions having a lot of friends in Other World, "and most of them are brunettes." Nonetheless, Goku mentions to Bulma that Gohan always taught him to be respectful and polite towards girls, and in any case, he's nowhere near as much of a Dirty Old Man as Master Roshi.
-   **Dragon Pilot: Hisone and Masotan**:
    -   Uniform designer Ikushima certainly acts like a pervert with his comments about Hisone's body but it's Played for Laughs as he has zero attraction to anyone and is actually very dedicated to his job. He is only obsessed over women's bodies in regards to making their flight suits fit them perfectly.
    -   Yukata is a self-proclaimed ladies' man and initially complained how Hisone did not have any sex appeal to attract him. But later on, he tells off some of his coworkers for getting too friendly with some visiting high school girls, though this may also be attributed to his growing feelings for Hoshino. And after his Break His Heart to Save Him with Hoshino, when Hoshino semi-casually offers to sleep with him, Yukata becomes flustered and tells her that was never his intention.
-   No doubt, Loke/Leo from **Fairy Tail** is a player, but he's always there for Lucy when she needs him (unless he's out with his girlfriend).
-   Shigure from the anime version of **Fruits Basket**. He is berated by many of the other Sohmas for it, but it becomes an almost endearing Running Gag nonetheless. In the manga he uses sex as a tool to have revenge against Akito, his cousin and ex-lover, for running in the arms of their cousin Kureno... by sleeping with Akito's **mother** Ren. And let's not forget the deal with Rin, either, though to his credit he doesn't take her offer.
-   Worick Arcangelo of **Gangsta.**. Though thoroughly a Jerk with a Heart of Gold even when nursing wounds the man can't pass up a chance to grope a cute girl's butt.
-   Emishi Haruki from **Get Backers**. He considers harming a woman to be just about the most terrible sin imaginable, and opponents admitting to it is nearly a Berserk Button; meanwhile, he happily flirts with every woman he meets. The closest he's come to 'pervert' was abruptly burying his face in a female friend's breasts, while desperately trying to cheer himself up after Amon's Heroic Sacrifice.
-   Kintarou Oe from **Golden Boy** is this combined with Brilliant, but Lazy. He has a ridiculously high libido and tends to get caught up in erotic daydreaming at the slightest provocation, but he can always hold his horniness at bay whenever the situation calls for it, and he will always end up putting his various love interests' happiness over his own.
-   **Great Teacher Onizuka**: Onizuka, when he's not being an inspiration to everyone around him. Always thinking of sex, looks up girl's skirts, has sex toys and porn galore, sizes up **every** attractive woman and became a teacher specifically for the schoolgirls. Yet when given the opportunity to act on these impulses with the young girls he's responsible for, his conscience doesn't allow it. (To wit, when Urumi semi-seriously offered herself to him he **knocked himself unconscious** rather than kiss her.) A lot of that also has to do with the fact that Onizuka is a man-child who is **terrified** of actual sexuality, and just plays up his lothario qualities for show. In fact, the comic establishes pretty early on that he's still a virgin.

-   **Gundam Expanded Universe**:
    -   Roybea Roy from **After War Gundam X**. One episode has him buying swimsuits for the crew girls after checking their measurements **by mere sight**, another has him visiting each one of his old girlfriends to see how are they holding up (including an ill girl whom he buys medicines for and the tombstone of the woman who actually gave him his Gundam). He also is very upset when one of his lovers, Femme Fatale Yurina, is shot to death, and very gracefully accepts Sala Tyrrell's apologies and definitive rejection of his affections.
    -   **Mobile Fighter G Gundam**: Chibodee Crocket is a bit of a flirt and loves teasing Rain, but when needed he's extremely protective of her and the Four-Girl Ensemble that forms his crew.

-   Maru from **Heavenly Delusion** counts as this. When he’s not making a romantic move on Kiruko, a young woman who is traveling with him on his journey as his bodyguard, he instead has perverted fantasies about her. Despite this, he is respectful to her as well - never going overboard and making sure she is alright - and she has grown close to him as true friends trying to survive post-apocalyptic Japan. Also, anyone harming Kiruko will press Maru's Berserk Button, which isn't a good idea against a seemingly ordinary teenager who is unusually strong, fast and tough compared to the average person. And as Robin (Kiruko's former Big Brother Mentor) found out later on after raping and gaslighting Kiruko, Maru is capable of extreme violence that came dangerously close to ending Robin's life, which was only prevented because Kiruko talked Maru out of doing so at the time.

-   Meisuke "Nube" Nueno from **Hell Teacher Nube** is a Covert Pervert for his busty workmate Ritsuko and more or less often ogles pretty women, but never ever tried to ogle his students no matter how well-endowed some of them are (\*cough\* Miki \*cough\* Ai), and lectured highschool-aged Izuna harshly when he believed she was into Enjo Kosai (which is the Japanese equivalent of teen prostitution, to say it simply). And when a very pretty 15-years-old girl with ice powers claims to be in love with him, he repeatedly refuses her affections by saying that she's too young for him - which is technically true, as he's 26 already. She has to die and then be revived before he comes to love her back.
-   In **The Heroic Legend of Arslan**, Gieve will flirt with every pretty girl within the vicinity but when Silvermask kills one of the Queen's handmaidens, Gieve was visibly saddened and angry and respectfully covered the girl's body afterwards.
-   Greece from **Hetalia: Axis Powers**, especially when compared to resident Lovable Sex Maniac France. He's known as #1 in the frequency of sex among nations and has even fewer problems with nudity than France does, but his overall personality is **very** different from France's. This becomes most obvious when he's shown with Japan: he's made one or two sexual advances towards him (which may or may not include actual sex), but most signs of his genuine affection for him are less centered on sex and actually pretty sweet (seriously, trying to speak Japanese? Taking all of Japan's snacks after the other nations ignore them? Being worried about his hair looking unkempt to Japan?).
    -   Not to mention, the nations generally panic at the prospect of France being around because they fear he'll jump on them (And let's be honest, he probably WILL). Greece, despite being known as \*very\* sexually active, does **not** incite that same reaction.
    -   A subtler version is Prussia, who might talk big about how fearless and awesome he is, but freaks out at the sight of a teen Hungary's half-naked body and, once he realizes she's a female, he quickly hands her his cape for cover.
    -   There's also Seborga, who is a Latin Lover but doesn't hit on female nation-tans who are too young for him, like Wy. (He does promise to do it when She Is All Grown Up.)
    -   France sees himself is this. "Love should never be forced on anyone," indeed. However, in practice, he himself pushes boundaries without fully crossing them. He will not outright rape anyone, true, but he has flipped skirts, undressed people of both genders against their wills, etc. Not to mention openly admitting he's a pervert and takes some degree of pride on it, which is something an average example would most likely think twice before doing.
-   **His and Her Circumstances**:
    -   Arima's best friend, Hideaki Asaba, loves being surrounded by his "kittens." In the manga's epilogue, he becomes an artist famous for portraits of women. Part of his success is that he always paints them (except for Yukino...) as ten times prettier than they actually are. When they point this out to him, he just shrugs and says that's how he sees them.
    -   While Asaba may have entertained the notion that Arima and Yukino's future daughter would be his soul mate, he gave up on that idea pretty quickly when she was born and became another father figure to her. When she turned fifteen and confessed her love for him, Asaba was really disturbed.
-   **Interspecies Reviewers**: While none of the others can compare to Crim in this regard, every member of the Interspecies Reviewers, despite being sex-obsessed horndogs, are genuinely good people. None of them ever mistreat their partners, even if on **very** rare occasions their partners might mistreat them, they always make sure their succu-girl partners are also enjoying the experience, and even outside of the succu-girl scene, many of them are upstanding members of society who help out others whenever the situation arises, even if they mainly do it for the cash involved.
-   Miroku from **Inuyasha**. Somewhat subverted by the fact that he eventually becomes a one-woman man **without** losing this quality in the slightest, much to his fiancée Sango's exasperation. In a rather early arc, there is a young woman named Koharu, whose life he saved years ago; she's very enamoured with him but Miroku actually **turns her affections down**, believing it was a case of Loving a Shadow.
-   A less pronounced example would be Joseph Joestar from **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure**. He's predominantly known as the series' resident cuckoosnarker, but he's dipped his toes into the pool of perverted actions a few times. The list includes (unknowingly) peeping on his naked mom taking a bath through the keyhole, hitting on multiple Egyptian women who're decades younger than him after he's married, and cheating on his wife with a Japanese college student and impregnating her.
    -   Jean Pierre Polnareff from Stardust Crusaders is this kind of guy. He's been seen a few times trying to flirt with pretty women but is never seen being downright disrespectful to them. He's somewhat of an example of Everyone Looks Sexier if French.
-   Dr. Akari from **Karneval** **knows** that he's a handsome bastard that women want (yet whom the nurses hilariously deny), but seemingly hasn't exercised the "pervert" portion as far as the viewer is concerned.
-   Ma Kensei from **Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple** is a Martial Arts grandmaster firmly on the side of Good. Between spending his free time trying to take panty shot of women and evading evisceration from these women he was able to steal the underwear of a psycho samurai chick FROM UNDER HER ARMOR! Turns out he just wanted to strip her from her soul-corrupting armor and rescue her from the path of evil.
    
    **"Why can't the world be just more ero and peaceful?"**
    
-   **Kill la Kill** has the males of the Mankanshoku family (including the **dog**), who both treat protagonist Ryuko like a sister/daughter, and peep on her more or less any time she's less than clothed, but at one point when the family gets Acquired Situational Narcissism thanks to increasing their status she's actually **disappointed** to realize that none of them are peeping on her.
    -   Even Mako Mankanshoku can count as this, as she rather frequently gropes Ryuko and makes remarks about her sexiness. At one point, she can be seen peeping through her fingers and getting a nosebleed while Ryuko is scantily clad. The perversions don't stop her from being Ryuko's most loyal friend and saving her life multiple times.
-   **Knight Hunters**: Deconstructed with Kudou Yoji. He's both shamelessly flirtatious toward and protective of women (at one point proclaiming that "woman's enemy is my enemy"), but he's also an assassin and male Honey Trap, and any woman he makes any kind of emotional connection with is inevitably either a target he is using for information, a target who's trying to use **him** for information, or just plain doomed to become a statistic. By the sequel series **Weiß Kreuz Glühen**, the emotional toll on Yoji has become so bad that he's developed habits like talking to his dead girlfriend on the phone and unconsciously throttling his partners during sex, and he nearly pulls a Face–Heel Turn in his desperation to forget about all of it. He only recovers after a complete case of Victory-Guided Amnesia allows him to leave it all behind and marry the Hospital Hottie who takes care of him.
-   Sakanami from **Koe de Oshigoto!** considers sexual harassment to be the ultimate compliment to a girl, but he himself will never touch a woman unless she wants him to.
-   The female genderbent version of Zhao Yun/Chou Un from **Koihime†Musou** is a female example, in that she never gives in to outright harassment - so far.
-   Manabe from **Kotoura-san** repeatedly teases Haruka by having pervy fantasies about her with the express purpose of winding her up (she **is** a telepath, mind you), but when he finds out Haruka's being bullied he confronts the bully about it— even the bully in question is his Childhood Friend.
-   The eponymous **Lupin III**, in the anime. The manga incarnation goes way further in matters of perversion, to the point that he's a Casanova Wannabe.
-   Michel Blanc of **Macross Frontier** eyes up and down all the pretty girls with his devilish charms, but he makes a clear effort to remember the names of those he only met for five seconds months ago, and **will** headlock suspected two-timing Jerk Asses who are setting up girls for a heartbreak. Gives decent relationship advice, too. And ultimately sacrifices his life for Klan, the girl he loves.
-   **Magic User's Club**: While Takeo may burst into perverted fantasies at the drop of a hat, he's very protective of his fellow club members, especially Sae, and tries his best to perform his duties as president without acting on his desires.
-   Usui Takumi in **Maid-Sama!** delights in teasing Misaki, enough so that she habitually calls him a "perverted space alien." Aside from stealing a couple of kisses, however, he scrupulously refrains from actually taking advantage of her in any way. Most notable during the incident in which Misaki is hypnotized to behave as though drunk, and begins trying to take off her clothes - Usui rolls her up in a blanket so that she can't do anything she'd really regret later.
-   Nanashi from **MÄR**. He's a perv and ladies man since you see him constantly making remarks about ladies and hanging around them. (Interestingly enough, he's also quite the chick magnet.) But at the same time, he will allow women to go first when he battles them, even going so far as to let Loco move first when she herself is a child. though once was a woman. He also was shown to have let Aqua in their battle win and when Girom killed her, he picked up her corpse, quite distraught, and dropped it in the water.
-   Kaminari in **My Hero Academia**. But unlike Mineta, who is more shameless than chivalrous, Kaminari knows how to constrain himself.
-   This is one of the reasons that Shizuru Viola from **My-Otome** carries the Code Name of "Bewitching Smile". This being Shizuru, she only charms the ladies... even if by accident.
    -   Chie Hallard also behaves like this a little bit, especially early on. Chances are good that she probably picked it up (as well as the "flirts with other girls" thing) from Shizuru.
-   **Naruto** has Jiraiya, who openly writes pornographic novels and compliments women on their bodies but like his mythological namesake "Jiraiya the Gallant" is the epitome of this trope. He is always protective and respectful of any women under his supervision, as shown in all his dealings with Konan.
-   **Negima! Magister Negi Magi**:
    -   Alberio Imma generally acts like this.
    -   Flashbacks reveal that Negi's father was like this as well, although he limited it to a single person and only when they had the luxury of privacy.
    -   Jack Rakan certainly likes "collecting" panties, much to the consternation and mortification of Fate Averruncus' minions; and his comments to Nagi about the latter's aforementioned beau leaves little doubt that his mind has already hurled itself through the proverbial gutter. He never quite crosses beyond those boundaries, however, and developed his infamous technique to defeat female opponents by stealing their panties and flipping their skirts until they concede to gain the upper hand without directly hurting them.
        -   Also, after defeating Homura (the only girl who kept attacking him **after** that), when her leader Fate stepped in to fight - Jack immediately asked her to step aside not because she had lost, but because he didn't want her to get caught in the crossfire.
    -   Johnny Raidein, who often comments on how pretty and grown Yuna Akashi looks despite her extreme youth but never goes beyond that. And he even pulls an Heroic Sacrifice later.
-   Ryoji Kaji from **Neon Genesis Evangelion** fulfills this trope very faithfully. He hits on women left and right and comes off as an aloof playboy, but is secretly very caring, driven, and responsible. He is the closest to a Big Brother Mentor that Shinji has, refuses to take advantage of the much younger Asuka's affections even after she literally throws herself at him, and clearly cares very deeply about his old girlfriend Misato - it's a shame she doesn't come to terms with her own feelings for him until it's too late.
-   **Nisekoi**
    -   Comes in the form of Shu Maiko, who is the foil to the serious but Accidental Pervert prone protagonist Raku. Shu is a happy-go-lucky boy whose main hobbies include taking voyeur photographs of his female classmates and lustfully chasing after Joshikouseis. But in truth, he's actually quite popular among the girls of his class due to his kind and sincere personality, confusing both Raku and his Unwanted Harem.
    -   In Chapter 141, a beautiful underclassman tried to confess her feelings to him. Woah to Shu's friends when, even though he's known for ogling cute girls, respectively rejects her due to the fact that his heart was still healing from losing his love. Even the tsundere Ruri Miyamoto, who's been kicking his perverted butt since the series' beginnings, was both confused and impressed.
-   **One Piece**:
    -   Sanji, of course, so much so that he refuses to harm a woman even if it would cost him his life. Do **not** mistreat women in his vicinity unless you want him to literally explode with rage. He gained one of those "actually bad" rivals in the form of Absalom, a Quirky Miniboss Squad member who can turn invisible (destroying Sanji's dream of gain this power) and who licked both the female protagonists and attacked Nami when she was bathing. That ended **very badly** for Absalom. And considering that he gave his Honey Trap Pudding a compliment right when she was about to kill him, his chivalrous pervert nature **saved his life**. His response to Queen hitting a woman while invisible? Unlock a new Super Mode and kick the bastard to oblivion, of course!
    -   Brook is a jovial skeleton man who's suffered 50 years of isolation, so he's lost touch with what is socially acceptable in conversation. He's keen to politely and respectfully asking any woman he sees to show him their panties, and it's actually worked once or twice. Besides this, he usually acts like a proper gentleman.
    -   Sanji also has a VERY hot big sister who flirts shamelessly towards Luffy right after giving him a Kiss of Life to Suck Out the Poison.

-   Near the end of episode 3 of **The Pet Girl of Sakurasou**, Sorata tells Jin to head back to Sakura Dormitory to comfort a heartbroken Misaki, who had seen Jin and Mashiro in front of a Love Hotel. Jin declines, stating that if he saw Misaki in that state, he'd only want to do perverted things **to her**, and doesn't want that to happen.
-   PG-rated version: Brock from **Pokémon: The Series**. He actually hurts friends sometimes when going after women, or gets hurt himself. One time he actually stood on Ash for a full minute before Ash stood up knocking him over. Another time he was ogling a lady on the beach (a lady who was at best not alive anymore, or at the absolute craziness was never a female or even human to begin with) only to get trampled by the people behind him.
-   This is Yuushi Oshitari's basic characterization in **The Prince of Tennis** Dating Sims. He's very sweet and chivalrous to the lead girls of the games but isn't above draping himself over them without going too far, and Word of God says that his ideal female is a girl with long, shapely legs. We don't see that so much in the anime or the manga, except when he tries to comfort Kotoha after Atobe sees through her Bitch in Sheep's Clothing act and refuses the bento she brings him.
-   Prince Wilfred from **Private Prince** loves to tease Miyako over her big breasts and often hugs and steals touches from her, but he has also rescued her several times from other people and comes to genuinely care for her. And they end up getting married.
-   Warrant Officer Oreldo in **Pumpkin Scissors** embraces the trope completely. He loves the ladies, and unlike many similar characters, he enjoys quite a bit of success with them. He's also always willing to get the crap beaten out of him for the sake of some cute girl he's just met, and frequently sets himself up as the bad guy in order to make sure things are made right for the girl of the moment — such as when, angered by how a poor girl's drug-addicted father was wasting her money and opportunities, he made a show of offering to buy her from him and then pretended to assault her in order to finally goad her father into taking action on her behalf.
-   The character Ral from the manga **Ral Grad** is this. Finding out the difference between men and women is a big part of his Character Development. (The fact that women have boobs and that he loves said boobies helps a lot.)
-   **Ranma ½**: Tatewaki Kuno is this Played for Laughs. How far he falls onto the chivalrous or pervert side, usually depends on what's funnier. Usually when he thinks a girl is coming onto him sexually, he'll back off, say they're too young for such things, and should start things slow.
-   **Reborn! (2004)**: Dr. Shamal once claimed that he "treats every cutie equally"... that, and he was also dating over 2,000 women at a time.
-   **Rosario + Vampire**:
    -   Ginei Morioka is incredibly perverted, and after his introduction, he's very blatant about it. However, he's very protective of his friends, and at one point he shields them from a massive fireball when he's perfectly capable of dodging. Yet even in tense situations, he's quite lecherous. At one point, he grabs Kurumu's breast as his "reward" for rescuing them.
    -   Kurumu Kurono is a rare female example. She openly flirts with Tsukune and inflicts Marshmallow Hell on him on a regular basis, but adamantly refuses to use her powers to take advantage of him, preferring to win him over fairly.
    -   Tsukune himself has his moments of this: for example, his initial reason for wanting to join the Swimming Club (before finding out water is a vampire's Kryptonite Factor) was so he could see Moka in a bikini. Nonetheless, he's **much** more respectful of girls than the other boys at Yokai Academy, who openly lust after women and publicly comment on their breasts.
-   **School Rumble**: Yakumo is often treated with the utmost chivalry by the men around her, but her mind-reading power tends to see much more lewd ideas in their heads. Haruki Hanai, who's most forward with her, is the most chivalrous of all the men, though he actually subverts the idea by being perfectly honest with what he says and thinks.
-   **The Seven Deadly Sins**: Meliodas usually won't pass up a chance at being a pervert (though only to Elizabeth) but he is still chivalrous when protecting Elizabeth (who is too naïve to complain, though does make her discomfort known) and others.
-   **Sorcerer Hunters**: Carrot Glace. He's the main character and obsessively tries to date every woman he sees despite the constant rejection and the fact he already has two very Clingy Jealous Girl teammates, one of whom constantly throws herself at him naked. The reason he never takes advantage of their affections? They're like sisters to him. Carrot does have a good reason to run from Chocolat and Tira. Both have a transformation sequence that turns them into dominatrixes, and they've hurt him more than any of the bad guys. Though to be fair, Carrot suffers from Power Incontinence: any spell that hits him turns him into a beast and the sisters have to beat him up to keep him under control. And in terms of all the other girls he leches on, if he learns that the girl in question is already in a relationship, he will immediately back down and leave the happy couple in peace. At the end of the manga, Carrot does marry Tira. Chocolat isn't resentful about it at all, as she plans to take the honeymoon night.
-   **Suzuka**: Yasunobu Hattori. While he is a pervert and generally thinking lewd thoughts, his advice to protagonist Yamato Akitsuki would have saved everyone in the show a lot of trouble.
-   **Tona-Gura!**: Yuuji will not touch or dream of touching underaged Lonely Rich Kid Nina, her giant boobs aside. Despite Marie's early explanation of her role in 'punishing' brother Yuuji and it being for her safety as well, there are places he will never go. Unless the target is Kazuki.
-   **Trigun**: Vash the Stampede is an obvious example, though the sincerity of his perversion is up for debate as many of his apparent emotions act as covers for his overwhelming inner pain. This aspect of his personality is also mostly absent in the manga as he never really demonstrates significant attraction to any characters.
    -   The movie **Trigun: Badlands Rumble** continues this trope with Vash and cranks the comedy element up when it comes to Amelia. Anyone who's seen the anime series in full knows that being the way he is towards women is about the best he can do to enjoy a woman's company without letting them find out just who he truly is. He acts like a pervert, but he would never **actually** take advantage of a woman.
-   **Trinity Seven** main character Arata Kasuga is **incredibly** upfront about how much he likes women with large breasts (but still likes women with no breasts, too), will openly comment on the attractiveness of his classmates, thanks women "for the meal" whenever he sees them nude or in revealing clothing, and generally makes it clear that he would enjoy having all kinds of perverted fun with anyone he finds attractive. Despite all that he is **very** respectful of their feelings: he doesn't try to sneak peeks at women when they expect privacy and doesn't force himself on women physically **or** verbally. Probably the most clear-cut example is when he turns down Lilith Azami in the OVA when she offers herself to him for sex so that he might learn about her thema, Lust. Arata surprises her by turning her down flat, reasoning that since everyone's thema is the opposite of their core personality, having sex so casually is the **last** thing she would ever want to do; as much as he wants to do perverted things with her, he only wants to do them **if she will enjoy them, too**.
-   **Uma Musume**: The Team Spica Trainer has a bizarre quirk for feeling up horse girls' legs, commenting on their muscle tone and racing potential. But he is a caring coach and acts like a good friend to them.
-   **Urusei Yatsura**: Ataru Moroboshi normally shows more the pervert than the Chivalrous, there are incidents like when he's been inflicted by a contagious toothache that he can ease the pain of by biting (and infecting) other people, initially the entire class tries barricading themselves away from him, but then the girls realize that he would never do anything like that to a girl and apologize to him for mistrusting him. And in a later story, when he finds himself stuck with a pair of gloves that make him hug then punch anyone who comes close to him, when Lum gets close, he blocks the gloves punch by pushing his own face in its way. Then does this again and again till he knocks himself out.
-   **Uwakoi**: Yukiteru is a Nice Guy at heart and wants more out of sex than just satisfying his Extreme Libido.
-   **Video Girl Ai**: Toshiki is an unrepentant, irresponsible, flirty The Casanova who dates and dumps girls and constantly tries to peek on Len Momono to see her naked. He's also a loyal friend who hugs Hiromu and cries with him when he's heartbroken, takes beatings from delinquents to save Hiromu and Ayumi, and when Len offers to have sex with him to see if her mission would be easier, he does **'not** take her offer. Yeah, the guy may be a major pervert, but when his friends truly need him he's very much there for them, so it's no wonder that with all of his high libido he **still** was pure-hearted enough to see the Neo Gokuraku store.
-   **Voltes V**: Ippei Mine. He has a bit of a big head due to being a famed Japanese-American rodeo star.
    
    **Ippei:** "Megumi, I'd like to rest. You're welcome to stare if you'd like." (slaps his shirtless, bare chest)
    
-   **X/1999**: Yuuto Kigai. He sleeps with his Femme Fatale boss and is very aware of the local Emotionless Girl's crush on him, but doesn't take advantage of the latter's feelings for him. Might be because he seems to partially see her as a Replacement Goldfish for his sister...
-   **Yona of the Dawn**: Jae-ha who loves to generously share his beauty and charm with women (including Yona) and is the sole reason for scenes in red-light districts. Often, however, he ends up helping those women without ever taking advantage of their situation.
-   **Yu-Gi-Oh!**: Yugi. In the manga he has lots of fantasies involving pretty girls, and specially about Anzu, but he doesn't act on them and is otherwise a really sweet Nice Guy. **Our protagonist, ladies and gentlemen!**
-   **YuYu Hakusho**: Yusuke Urameshi. Somewhat different in that he only acts this way towards one girl: his best and oldest friend Keiko Yukimura, who has, apparently, been putting up with it since they were in kindergarten.
-   **Zatch Bell!**: Parco Folgore is a shining example of this. Being a handsome Italian pop star, he is a hit with the ladies. He basks in their attention and it is made straight-out obvious that he is a huge womanizer in his first appearance (he even has a hit song solely about breasts. In the original Japanese version, that is). However, he would never lay a hand on a woman who showed no interest in him and is very concerned about their well-being (for example, he took Suzume to the hospital after she hit her head against a pole and fell on her bottom, and in that same episode he performed for and handed out gifts to a group of sick children). He always puts his friends (and especially his mamodo partner, Kanchome) first and would never abandon them, even if he is a bit of a coward.

Chivalrous Pervert Example in Comic Books

-   **Batman**: Depending on the writer, Dick Grayson can fall under this trope.
-   **The Incredible Hercules**: Hercules. He hooks up with the Girl of the Week every other issue, partly because he wants to get laid and partly because he finds them interesting people. Taken to its logical extreme in **Fall of an Avenger**. after his death, it was revealed that Hercules had long-term relationships with different women all over the world. He would even support them with his investments until he could see them again. All of them were saddened when they learned that he was dead.
-   **Iron Man**: Tony Stark is famously the biggest womanizer in the Marvel Universe, yet he's incredibly polite to the women he's chatting up, cares deeply about most of his exes (the Marvel Now relaunch's opening story arc essentially boils down to him wanting to protect the legacy of one of his exes after her life's work is stolen and abused), is VERY protective of his on-again/off-again love interest Pepper, honestly loved (and still loves) Madame Masque, and is always completely supportive of his female teammates, no matter how they dress and pose.
-   **Superboy**: Kon-El's first girlfriend thought there was no way they'd work out due to his "wandering eyes", though he did mature out of the less savory aspects of this by the time he picked up the name Conner Kent. Once in **Public Enemies**, he and Supergirl are caught in a "walls closing in" Death Trap and he complains he would have preferred to be trapped with Power Girl <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>. In one **Superman/Batman** issue, he finds some sexbots of the female Teen Titans, belonging to the teenage Toyman (**not** the original villainous version) which Kon-El clearly enjoys... until Tim Drake (Robin) destroys them.
    
    **Superboy:** I hate you. I hate you more than anyone I've ever known.
    
-   **Teen Titans**: Beast Boy/Changeling, far more so than his animated counterpart. He hits on anything in a skirt, although this is part of the fact that he acts goofy as a way to deal with his own problems. In one instance, the Titans are swimming and Dick and Starfire are skinny-dipping in the hot tub. Something Gar says causes Starfire to stand up, and even though Dick manages to cover her with a towel, Gar freaks out and starts apologizing profusely.

Chivalrous Pervert Example in Fan Works

-   **A Brief History of Equestria** interprets Commander Hurricane as this. An excerpt from Clover the Clever's diary informs us that the only thing he was more renowned for than his sexual prowess was his sense of honor.
-   **Codex Equus** has a justified example in Blue Suede Heartstrings, who is the Alicorn god of Music and Humility, and is based on Elvis Presley. Blue grew up during the Second Age in a time where being a "tail-chaser" was the norm for colts and stallions, so naturally, this rubbed off on him and gave him flirting tendencies. However, his religious upbringing taught him the value of humility, and it influenced him later on to never go beyond simple flirting, and respect those who are in established relationships and/or are married. He even had a few past relationships with both mares and stallions where he was completely faithful and loving, and never forgot his partners' names and faces long after they died.
-   **Destiny is a Hazy Thing**: Kiba's to Karin (who is attracted to his chakra like an addict and thus is generally kept in his presence) when Ino jokes that he should make a move as she would be willing to do anything he wants. Kiba immediately puts down the idea saying that while Karin is cute, he's not comfortable taking advantage of her because A) he'd prefer it if she liked him for him and not due to his chakra and B) it would count as rape and he respects women too much to do that.
-   The Reading Rainbowverse interprets Thunderlane as one of these. He ends up dating Princess Luna.
-   **Fluttershy's Night Out**: The first stallion teenaged Fluttershy meets at the bar, who kindly tells her that she's a nice kid and really should just go home and think about whether she actually wants to be doing something like this. She should have listened to him - the next one she meets, Nosey, isn't as nice.
-   The hero of **A Long Night at the Hippodrome**, Piercing Gaze, is definitely lecherous, but he is only interested in mares who are "willing and experienced enough to know what they want." He broke this rule once in the past, with Trixie Lulamoon, because True Love is Exceptional, and destroyed their developing friendship, something he greatly regrets. He also refuses to use his position as a theatrical impresario to exploit aspiring female performers.
-   In **Friendship Is Magical Girls**, Spike's particular vice-based ninja magic is powered by lust, which he fuels with perverted acts. However, despite this, he's still a decent person and has the utmost respect for the girls.
-   **My Lesbian Life with Monster Girls: Monster Yurisume**: A rare female example. Yuisu is often prone to spacing out and drooling when it comes to beautiful women but is able to control herself.
-   BJ completely subverts this in **Cinderjuice**, if only because he Can't Act Perverted Toward a Love Interest. But in the sequels, with the Relationship Upgrade confirmed, he's a one-woman man version of this - mostly to tease her.
-   Mack from the **Cars** fanfic, **I'll Meet You on Route 62**, is portrayed as one. Though he's not as perverted as some of the other guys in the story, he can still be flirty when he wants to. Regardless, Mack still respects women and the thought of women selling themselves out for men disgusts him.
-   **Total Drama**
    -   **A TDA Love Triangle with Betty, Cody, and Gwenny**: Cody, as usual. He openly admits being a horny teenager, but he's also a very Nice Guy who will put the girls' comfort and necessities over his hormonal urges. He even feels guilty over having lusty thoughts on Gwen and Bridgette once he knows about their past bad experiences with guys.
    -   **Unbreakable Red Silken Thread**: Basically defines Cody's character. He's not above taking advantage of opportunities when they present themselves but only to a limit. As was the case with Jasmine and Sammy's first time having sex when he shot down Heather's one-sided bargain to give them a place where they could have some privacy.
-   In **Son of the Sannin**, Jiraiya becomes an even bigger example of this, with special focus on the "chivalrous" part. Living with Tsunade under the same roof gets him to hold back his antics for her sake, and this endears him to her enough that she falls for him and they get married.
-   Minoru Mineta, of all people, ends up being this in **Izuku's Pet Noumu**, being able to hold back his perversions not just for his love interest Ningyou, but for the other nomu monster girls' sake. 1-A is shocked at Minoru's courtesy, but those who were present with him when the neurotoxins within said girls nearly killed them aren't surprised that he's dedicated to becoming a decent person.
-   Izuku again in **Quirk: Incubus** is a shameless flirt who uses (in other circumstances) what amounts to sexual harassment to activate his powers, but he always ensures that consent is involved and is otherwise the same babyface Nice Guy his canon-counterpart ever was.
-   **Heroes Never Die**:
    -   Kaminari takes Meneta's place as the class pervert, but the girls immediately note that he's not as bad. Even Uraraka says that his flirting would have been fine, but they were in the middle of a combat test so it was hardly the time.
    -   Izuku is chivalrous enough that Ashido initially thinks he's gay. He is a healthy heterosexual teenage boy, though, so when Todoroki freezes the arena and a certain part of Ashido's anatomy gets cold, Izuku is very insistent that she wear his jacket.
-   **A Possible Encounter for a Phantom**: It's painfully clear Danny has an interest in Kim and has fought off the urge to use his powers to see her naked. The one time he did see her naked, however, was an accident of her part and he promises not to speak of it. Regardless, it's also clear he respects her as a hero and not just a pretty face, which causes Kim to return his interest.
-   The **RWBY Abridged** version of Jaune Arc zigzags this trope, as he can get pretty saucy with his comments towards women, but he's very polite in how he goes about it. He compliments women on their skills, independence, and intelligence as much as their looks, takes being harshly rejected multiple times pretty well, and seems to like it when women don't immediately fall for his good looks. That being said, Jaune is also a total dick to women he perceives as hussies and accuses Pyrrha of being obsessed with trying to gain the attention of random men because she dresses like a slut.
-   Sanji's mixture of chivalry and perversion is deconstructed in the **One Piece** fanfic **Mellorine! Mellorine!**. After a mysterious phenomena causes a post-Skypiea Luffy, Zoro and Usopp to turn into women, Sanji eventually comes to a Heel Realization when he realizes that his constant "innocent" idolization of the now-female Usopp is driving "her" deeper into a mental breakdown. His refusal to fight girls as part of this chivalric lechery is also deconstructed, as he finds he can no longer stop the insatiable glutton Luffy from raiding their supplies whenever he pleases, as Luffy only responds to physical violence as a deterrent.

Chivalrous Pervert Example in Films — Animation

-   Phoebus from **The Hunchback of Notre Dame (Disney)** will gladly watch Esmeralda's erotic dancing at the Feast of Fools, but that doesn't stop him from respecting her.
-   Prince Naveen from **The Princess and the Frog**. Despite his well-known reputation as a womanizer, he seems to respect women for the most part.

---
Chivalrous Pervert Example in Films — Live-Action

-   Lester Burnham from **American Beauty**. He spends the movie obsessing over a Fille Fatale girl who is the same age as his daughter. When he actually gets a chance with her, he stops once he finds out she's actually a virgin, and her suggestions of sexual prowess were made up.
-   Luigi in **Another Time, Another Place** is a bit of a graceless sleazebag, but at least he does take Janie's initial rejections gracefully and he doesn't browbeat her about it.
-   Austin Powers, despite some implied deviant sexual behavior, is still for the most part courteous toward the ladies he's trying to woo. He makes outrageous passes at Vanessa, but when she tries to kiss him, he refuses because she's drunk. Back in the sixties, he was clearly attracted to Vanessa's mother but never made a move on her because she was married. Considering who he's a parody of, this is to be expected.
-   In **Back to the Future**, George McFly is introduced spying on Lorraine Barnes through binoculars while she is getting undressed (Marty: "He's a Peeping Tom!") but later he walks in on Biff Tannen's attempt to rape her and knocks his bully out with a single punch. After Biff is dealt with, he tenderly asks if she is alright and offers his hand to help her up. This results in a much happier 1985 when Marty returns to his time, because George is much more confident and because Lorraine married him because he was her hero rather than because she pitied him.
-   Peter Sellers in **The Bobo** plays a wandering musician who agrees to a wager where he can get a theater engagement if he beds the local gold digger (Britt Ekland) within three days - but resists taking advantage of her when she gets drunk. Possibly averted as the deal specified his being in her apartment one hour with the lights out, and they were far off in another location.
-   Howard Stark in **Captain America: The First Avenger**. He may be a playboy inventor (much like his son) but he is respectful to coworker Peggy and he later explains to Steve what he meant by having "fondue" with her (he was essentially asking Peggy that after a mission if she wanted to go out and eat with him. Steve had never heard of fondue before, and assumed it was a sexual euphemism.)
-   Theater impresario Henri Danglard in **French Cancan**. He goes through starlets/creative muses/lovers like Kleenex, but whatever woman he's with at the time he treats like gold.
-   Peter Venkman from **Ghostbusters (1984)**. Despite relentlessly pursuing Dana (often to her annoyance), he refuses to take advantage of her even when presented with the opportunity.
-   Captain Phoebus in the 1923 version of **The Hunchback Of Notre Dame** is still presented as a womanizer, but cares about Esmeralda's safety in contrast to his un-chivalrous book counterpart.
-   **James Bond**: Pierce Brosnan's Bond is just as prone to bawdy innuendos and sleeping around as the other incarnations. The big difference is that he genuinely cares about the women in his life, and does everything he can to keep them safe. He is affectionate towards Natalya, Paris got "too close for comfort," he is unusually protective of Wai Lin even before they officially become allies, he falls in love with Elektra, and his sheer panic (and later relief) when he attempts to resuscitate Jinx proves that she's not just a notch on his bedpost.
-   Downplayed with Eggsy from **Kingsman: The Secret Service**, as should be expected from a Bond-in-training. He's not an inappropriate flirt, but he had no problem having Rescue Sex with a woman he hardly knows — although, to be fair, he only asked for a kiss; the rest was her initiative.
-   Harry Lockhart in **Kiss Kiss Bang Bang**: although he appears to spend a lot of time thinking about Harmony in a sexual way, he is quick to become upset when she **isn't** upset over the idea of being groped in her sleep.
-   James Lennox in **Men with Brooms**, the kind of classy guy who brings a "Rent-A-Girlfriend" to a funeral of a beloved friend, refuses to take advantage of Amy when she makes a drunken rebound attempt at him. He even goes on to berate Chris for unintentionally causing Amy to fall Off the Wagon.
-   Jim Kirk in the reboot **Star Trek (2009)** franchise may flirt with any women he sees, but he is never overly pushy with them. He also treats Uhura, Spock's girlfriend, respectfully and even apologizes to her when there was a moment he was frustrated with Spock.
-   **Stroker Ace**: Stroker starts off as a womanizer who doesn't even believe in the word 'virgin'. He spends the entire movie finding a way to bed Pembrook and settles on getting her drunk. However, he ultimately turns into a chivalrous pervert when Pembrook passes out in his hotel room. He undresses her, and he can be seen resisting his urges until he decides to just leave her alone. He confesses the next morning that nothing happened after she passed out.
-   In **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014)**, Mikey has April on his mind in pretty much every non-action scene where they interact. He even apologizes for how creepy his "We will find you" line sounded when she first meets them.
-   Van in **Van Wilder**. He flirts mercilessly with love-interest Gwen but he never actually makes a pass at her since he knows she has a boyfriend, even though the guy is a complete Jerkass. He does the same thing with Kaitlin in **Freshman Year**.
-   Monty in **Waiting...** actively pursues the hostess. He backs out at the last minute because she's roughly a week shy of being eighteen. However, he instructs her to tell everyone that he totally nailed her. You know, for his image. Of course, this is part of his Character Development, as he had **zero** hangups with violating the Jail Bait Wait.
-   Subverted by Sam Lombardo in **Wild Things**. Although it seems like he's upset at Ray killing Kelly on moral grounds, it's clear that he's really only concerned about a potential Spanner in the Works wrecking the plan. He has no compunctions about exploiting Kelly's love for him for sex and money, and intends to frame her for what will probably be a life sentence for Suzie's murder.
-   Randy "The Ram" Robinson from **The Wrestler** is a regular patron at a sleazy strip club. But he treats his favorite stripper, Cassidy, like a real person rather than a piece of meat, even going as far as to defend her when some other patrons make insulting remarks to her.
-   **X-Men Film Series**
    -   **X2: X-Men United**: Iceman adores Rogue, and although he's supposed to be looking the other way, he can't resist taking a peek at her while she's changing into his mother's old clothes.
    -   **X-Men: First Class**:
        -   Charles Xavier boldly hits on co-eds, but when his latest target for conquest sincerely needs help, he's all business.
        -   Sean Cassidy is introduced flirting with a girl, who seems to find him comical more than anything else. He also wolf-whistles at Angel.
    -   **X-Men: Apocalypse**:
        -   In this French interview, James McAvoy discloses Xavier's lust and adoration for Moira.
            
            "Definitely he has... the hots for her! **(laughs)** She gives new meaning to his life, undoubtedly. \[...\] Charles is madly in love with Moira and he will do everything to protect her."
            
        -   Professor X may even have a bit of competition because Quicksilver blows a couple of kisses at Moira and holds her in a traditional dance pose before rescuing her from an explosion. In this commercial, Peter Maximoff **sniffs the hair** of the young woman he's (very much) interested in, and he performs elaborate gestures just so that she can better enjoy the romantic movie she's watching.

Chivalrous Pervert Example in Literature

-   The literary James Bond is one of these in spades. Movie Bond, however, is more of a cad.
-   Nicholas van Rijn of Poul Anderson's **Polesotechnic League** stories. If you are an attractive woman, expect to have him make constant references to your looks as well as many passes. But should danger appear, you couldn't have anyone better at your side.
-   In the same mould, Heslet Quillan from James H. Schmitz's **Federation of the Hub** series takes instant advantage of the situation when the naked Action Girl falls into his arms—but never hesitates when a lady needs his help.
-   Akatsuki Oosawa from **Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero** is one HELL of an Hormone-Addled Teenager and uses his powers to this purpose, much to the embarrassment and anger of the girls in the cast... but he **cannot** stand to see a girl in tears, and will go to great lengths to fix it.
-   Conan the Barbarian. Perhaps most notably in "The Slithering Shadow" where Conan is actually embarrassed at the way The Vamp glomped onto him, because his slave girl Natala is watching, even though "He was no more monogamous in his nature than the average soldier of fortune"
-   Count Giacomo Casanunda, **Discworld**'s his business card reads in full as "World's 2nd Greatest Lover. Finest Swordsman. Outrageous Liar. Soldier of Fortune. Stepladders Repaired." (as for the "second greatest lover bit" as he says "I try harder"). A charming romantic scoundrel like his real-world namesake, he never mistreats a lady he has taken an interest in, even during his try at being a highwayman, and he's decidedly a lover rather than a fighter. He was even willing to stand up against The Fair Folk to defend Nanny Ogg (who didn't really need defending, but that's beside the point).
    -   Cohen the Barbarian may count also. At one point there's a discussion between several other characters where one of them says that barbarians like Cohen pillage and rape and another one says something like "Well, pillaging, certainly; raping ... no. **Ravishing,** possibly." The first character asks what's the difference, and the second says "For one thing, I don't believe that there were any actual **complaints**."
-   Quite a few Deadpan Snarker detectives. Most notably Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe and Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade. Both of whom have been played by Humphrey Bogart.
-   Possibly, Travis McGee, in John Macdonald's novels. Bitter, but utterly a believer in the healing power of good sex, occasionally waxing highly poetic about it. He admits he sleeps with women to make them feel better; he's quieter about the healing effect it has on him as well, being not inclined to discuss his dark past.
    -   Averted in **Pale Gray for Guilt**; it's his truly chivalrous and chaste behavior towards Janine Bannon the widow of an old and dear friend that finally reveals to her the Knight in Sour Armor her husband liked so well.
-   Dr. Tachyon of **Wild Cards**. Consider: Roulette tries to kill him; he heals her and sends her off to rebuild her life.
-   In Sandy Mitchell's **Ciaphas Cain** novels, Cain alludes to his numerous amorous adventures (at least, prior to meeting Amberley Vail), but never to getting into trouble as a consequence, and the one occasion where he meets up again with an old flame she is perfectly happy to see him.
-   Saito in **The Familiar of Zero** (more on the chivalrous side in the Light Novels and more on the perverted side in the anime). He's attracted to pretty much his entire Unwanted Harem, including his master Louise, his maid Siesta, the flirty Kirche, the quiet Tabitha, the naive Tiffania and even Princess Henrietta. Despite his perverted side, he never takes advantage of them even when given an opportunity. Not even when Louise becomes a lovey-dovey Clingy Jealous Girl under effect of a Love Potion.
-   **Full Metal Panic!**: Kurz Weber. Best summed up when he rejects a We Can Rule Together speech by suggesting a counterstrategy: "I'll kill you, ask Tessa for a picture of her in her swimsuit as a reward, and sell copies to everyone on the ship for $20 apiece." Shortly afterward, when Melissa Mao turns up in nothing but her underwear to save him and then passes out, his only reaction is to sit dolefully next to her and lament that he doesn't have a camera. He also tends to use his reputation as a pervert to distract others and avoid conversations he doesn't care for. Probably better demonstrated just before that when he gets genuinely mad at Sousuke for making Kaname cry, despite missing no opportunities to generally be a lech over the series.
-   John Ringo's **Ghost** gives us a chivalrous **rapist** as the protagonist. Say it with me... OH JOHN RINGO NO.
-   Lucien de Barenton, Count de Chretien, in Vonda N. McIntyre's **The Moon and the Sun**. A sharp-witted, cosmopolitan seventeenth-century aristocrat with a colorful love life, who respects all of his girlfriends as people and eventually settles down with the heroine.
-   Fitz Kreiner from the **Doctor Who Expanded Universe** novels. He at one point has three girlfriends at the same time, but other than that is nothing but sweet and lovely to all of them. He once justified deflowering a naive ingenue with the fact that his mum always told him that if someone is sad, you should try to cheer them up. He starts off as more of a Fairly Attractive Lech, though. One novel features this scene, which gives one the impression he's an intentional example of this trope:
    
    Without hesitation Fitz stepped forward and cracked Robin on the jaw with a straight punch which probably hurt him more than its victim.  
    Robin staggered backwards, looking shocked.  
    Fitz rubbed his aching knuckles. ‘If there’s one thing I can't stand it’s bullies. Especially people who bully women.’
    
-   Judge Dee's faithful lieutenant Ma Joong is always ready to take his pleasure, but when he rescues a mistreated prostitute - who turns out to be from his own village - he is the soul of chivalry. Eventually he buys her out so she can marry the young man she's in love with.
-   A favourite of Christopher Pike's in his novels: the **Final Friends** series (Bubba); **Monster** (Kevin); **Witch (1990)** (Randy); **The Eternal Enemy** (Ed).
-   **The Dresden Files**:
    -   Carlos Ramirez is the resident The Casanova, but is unfailingly polite to all women. He's also a virgin, to the amusement of everyone present.
    -   Harry Dresden has a self-proclaimed chivalrous streak that gets him into trouble often enough, but it doesn't extend to looking away... When Harry encounters a beautiful woman, he often spends an inordinate amount of time describing them. The short stories in the series told from other characters' viewpoints, as well as other books written by Jim Butcher, lack these overly detailed descriptions, giving a subtle but clever indicator as to what Harry's thinking of a lot. Some fans have even noted that said descriptions become much less vivid during the periods in Harry's life when he's getting laid regularly.

-   Kyon from **Haruhi Suzumiya**, even though he rarely has actually needed to avenge the dishonor of a beautiful lady — but push the right buttons and he'll defend.
-   **High School D×D**: Issei Hyoudou, the protagonist, is this trope par excellence, constantly ranting out loud about the wonders of boobs and not sparing even his (many) love interests of his antics. For all of it, though, he has great respect for women and loathes when he sees them being mistreated. When Riser molests his Queen in front of him just to make Issei jealous, then makes a comment that his arranged fiancee Rias will make a nice notch on his belt, he didn't know he pushed Issei's Big Red Berserk Button. You can only imagine what happened next.
-   **Inukami!**: Keita, and those four Citizens of Darkness guys who he often shares a jail cell with. They're peeping toms and panty thieves but that's as far as they go. They're the 'good' perverts that contrast the evil perversion of the Big Bad, who likes undressing people and putting them in embarrassing cosplay.
-   **A Thread of Grace**: Renzo Leoni has elements of this. His ability to play this role allows him to get close to the Nazis who are in charge of his area of Italy.
-   Captain Bel Thorne of the **Vorkosigan Saga**. Thorne was a Betan hermaphrodite but tended to act more male than female, most of the time, although the balance generally depended on the known preferences of who it<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> was trying to seduce. However, when asked to smuggle an attractive young refugee away from a hostile force it refused most of the money, just keeping one token note to make it a legal contract. Thorne also once passed up a chance to seduce its commanding officer's clone brother by blackmailing young Mark into submitting lest Mark blow his cover. It already knew it wasn't really Miles it was seducing, knew Mark was a scared teenager trying to impersonate a man in his twenties, and refrained from either exposing Mark or... exposing Mark.
-   Eon in the **Belisarius Series** is rather like this. As a teenager, he played around with the palace staff as well as his two concubines whom he was quite fond of before he married. Interestingly when asked by the title character to play a role as a spectacularly abusive pervert for his cover in a covert op he is rather repulsed. Before Eon's coronation the elders of his kingdom question all the palace staff on his treatment of them on the assumption that this would indicate how he might treat his people.
-   In **A Whiff of Death** (a.k.a. **The Death Dealers**), the minor character Dr. Foster seems to be constantly flirting with any female but has never been seen or heard doing anything inappropriate; he's simply very gregarious.
-   Genderswapped with the Princess Lylia in **A Brother's Price**; though it's heavier on the "Chivalrous" side, she's intensely interested in sex and rather mischievous about it. Her female cousins want her one male cousin, Cullen, to be a Proper Young Man, holding still, keeping his legs together, being pure and safe and brainless, but she "corrupts" him by sneaking him wine, cigars, visits to horses, and pornographic tintypes. As a result, he's something of a Lovable Sex Maniac. They have kissed for practice but are Like Brother and Sister and have vowed that whoever has sex first, tell the other **everything**. She is **very** interested in the beautiful Jerin.
-   Double Subversion in **Of Fear and Faith** with Aiden. He plays the part of the charming and likeable ladies' man and is very nice to the women he flirts with, but his narration makes it clear that it's an act and he doesn't really care about them at all. And then he meets Lilac and he's pretty much the reverse of the above, trying to act aloof and disaffected despite caring about her a great deal (much to his chagrin).
-   Simona Ahrnstedt's male protagonists have a tendency to be this. They might have had affairs with many different women, and alas, they can be jerks too. But they mostly try to show women proper respect. And when it really matters, they will show a strong chivalrous streak.
-   In “Down to a Sunless Sea” The Hero, Captain Jonah Scott, is a complicated example. He sleeps around (especially with the stewardess of his plane) following the death of his wife in the backstory, but he does seem to care for the feelings and happiness of his partners and displays some loathing for the Sexual Extortion being carried out by the airport manager, despite initially seeming indifferent towards it.
-   **Please Don't Tell My Parents I'm a Supervillain**: Ray, after he gains superpowers. Penny admits to liking his "leering charm".
-   **Stinger**: Ray draws his own porn and is constantly ogling "Nasty" Slattery, but after the final battle, she passes out from exhaustion and suffers some Clothing Damage that exposes her breasts. Upon realizing she's too exhausted to notice, Ray contemplates groping her, but covers her up with a jacket instead.
-   **The Year of the Rat**: Alk Haskil is an example. As his Love Interest states, "ANY talk of his ends with some horrid perversion", and she is positive she can sense his immoral thoughts about her. But he never fights a woman, never rapes one, and always rushes to help any Damsel in Distress he meets.
-   In **The Chessmen of Mars**, the creepy old taxidermist I-Gos tries to rape Tara, but fails. Later, after learning that Gahan loves Tara, and after seeing how brave and honorable Gahan is, I-Gos helps him to rescue her from the tyrant O-Tar.
-   Razza from **Don't Call Me Ishmael!** joins the debate team to meet girls at debates, flirts with nearly every girl he meets, and fancies himself a casanova, but he is devoted to his girlfriend Sally and perfectly willing to wait until she wants to have sex.
-   Sam Aylward of **The White Company** is a shameless rake, with three girlfriends in various places on the go at once, and will chase anything in a skirt in between - but the maid has to be willing and Sam knows the difference between 'coy' and 'no'. In the latter case, he tips his steel cap and moves on. Insult or threaten a woman in his presence, and you die.
-   The Wyrm of Erch from **The Traitor Son Cycle** doesn't hide his interest in any pretty woman who happens to pass by. He never forces himself on them and is extremely nice and caring for his (many, many) lovers.
-   **Nightrunners series**: Seregil is bisexual and perhaps less eager to seduce random strangers than most examples here, but he's had several lovers in the past, is perfectly willing to have near-anonymous sex when asked to for reasons of cultural expectations (just wishing privately that his partners had better personal hygiene), and he is a frequent and very welcome guest at his home city's most expensive brothels, to the point of winning one of the madames as a personal friend. Not just because he's attractive and very generous with regards to payments, but also because he does stuff like compose and perform praise songs about his favourite prostitutes (despite most definitely not being smitten with them - "sparing his feelings while sating his body" is the main reason he prefers prostitutes over relationships) and probably because he's described as "eager to please" in bed. He also generally has a feminist attitude - though he does call prostitutes "whores", if not to their faces.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
-   All the male members of the Gentleman Bastards in Scott Lynch's series of fantasy novels are charming and **very** respectful towards women, considering the macho-culture Wretched Hive they grew up in. This is largely because the only female member of their gang was a strident non-straw feminist who didn't let them get away with any of the usual teenage male sexist bullshit (especially not Locke), and partly because the Fagin-expy who raised all of them was a genuinely, and for their city's underworld very unusually, good and decent man.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> However, since Jean is too much of a romantic to use prostitutes and is quickly bereaved once he falls for a woman in the second book, and because Locke has genuine Single-Target Sexuality to the point that he can't get it up for anyone else, only the Sansa twins are true "Chivalrous Perverts". They might not be very polite about women (and the women they know well are perfectly capable of defending themselves and thus don't need White Knighting), but their heart is certainly in the right place and it's stated that they never bother a girl again after being rejected once. Their well-earned in-universe horndog reputation is also used to make the point that rapists rape because of their sociopathy / sadism / socially accepted entitlement, not because of mere opportunity or lowered inhibitions from being drunk.
-   Randall Trevelyne in **Bloody Jack**: while he attempts to seduce Jacky and encourages her to become his mistress, he doesn't hesitate to step up and defend her from other men when the need arises. Jacky herself notes that while he would cheerfully have his way with her if she consented, he would never force himself on her.
-   **Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai**: Main character Sakuta Azusagawa is a genuinely Nice Guy who goes to great lengths, including putting himself into danger, to solve the rest of the cast members' problems with Adolescence Syndrome.<sup>i.e.&nbsp;</sup> He's also a typical fifteen-year-old boy with a typical fifteen-year-old boy's sex drive, and is quite forthright about it when he finds girls sexually attractive. Fortunately his girlfriend Mai Sakurajima finds it amusing: when she holds hands with him in a grocery store, she teases him about the "lewd thoughts" he's probably having about her. Without missing a beat, he replies, "My thoughts are a hundred times lewder than what you're imagining."
-   **Record of Grancrest War**: Villar only hires female mages to work for him and makes them wear skimpy outfits for his enjoyment. However, it is revealed that the reason why he hires them is to protect them from the various people who are prejudiced against mages. He also helps his mages find husbands after they leave his service.
-   **So, I Can't Play H!**: Ryousuke is a total pervert who takes every opportunity to peep at girls or see them in revealing outfits. He also considers women to be the greatest treasures in the universe and cannot tolerate anyone harming or disrespecting them.
-   **Student Council's Discretion**: Sugisaki. Very strong on the pervert end of the scale as his declared goal is to turn the student council into his harem and compares them to a dating sim, where after finishing Chizuru's route he would get the Best Harem End. That way (insert noble pose) everyone can be happy!
-   Inspector Morse, in the books at least. This character trait was apparently Adapted Out of the TV series at the insistence of John Thaw, who played Morse.

Chivalrous Pervert Example in Live-Action TV

-   **Highlander**: Duncan is a downplayed example. When he's not in a dedicated relationship he has a knack for bedding nearly every adult woman he meets and it's shown passionate one-night stands is how he befriended several of the immortal women he knows. Yet he also acts like a perfect gentleman and adheres to an old-school code of chivalry through and through. One notable incident early on his him flying into a rage when he finds out a mortal friend's son is being stalked by an immortal because he raped the man's adopted daughter and considers just throwing him to the wolves despite his dislike of vigilantism. He also has the personal honor to draw the line when a newly immortal 18-year-old girl he's known since she was a child starts coming onto him.
-   **Game of Thrones**:
    -   Tyrion Lannister's reputation across Westeros for his drinking and whoring is such that the brothel in Winterfell awaits his arrival with great enthusiasm. However, he almost always treats women with great respect (his sister excluded, though that is quite another matter), and loathes to see them harmed or abused in any way. Given his disgust for people who treat weaker people badly and his personal history, this makes perfect sense. When he and Sansa Stark are forced into a political marriage by his father, Tyrion can plainly see her reluctance to go through with consummating the relationship. Even though he's extremely drunk, he still stops her from undressing and tells her that he won't bed her until she actually wants him to. And if she never wants to? His reaction says it all.
        
        **Tyrion:** And so my watch begins.
        
    -   Grey Worm is entranced by nude Missandei, but since he's a eunuch it is much more about intimacy than sex.
    -   Daario forgoes prostitutes and rape because he prefers making women **want** to fuck him. Salladhor Saan also refuses to rape anyone but has no issues cavorting with prostitutes. Before the Battle of the Blackwater, Saan makes it clear he wants to sleep with Cersei by seducing her, not forcing himself upon her.
-   **Boston Legal**: Alan Shore and Denny Crane. "If you ever need anything, an ear, a shoulder **\[pause\]**, an erection, I'm here."

-   G'Kar from **Babylon 5** after some Character Development. The ending of the series implies that his patience paid off. His last appearance in the series in broadcast order implies he got to get jiggy with Lyta Alexander, who five years earlier had replied to his proposition with something along the lines of "not even if you were the last male in the Universe, and the salvation of the Universe dependent on it." Of course, in between he'd become much less of a Jerkass and she'd done some Boldly Coming with Kosh, at least in heavy subtext.
-   **Skins**: One of Cook's better moments comes when Naomi suddenly changes her mind about having sex with him and he immediately accepts it.
    
    **Naomi:** You're not even going to try and convince me? Most guys would.  
    **Cook:** Most guys aren't me, babe.
    
-   Xander from **Buffy the Vampire Slayer**. The one time he had any success with Buffy, his Love Interest in the early seasons, he turned her down because he realized that she was under the influence of magic.
    -   Sid the Dummy in the first season and other appearances keeps flirting and throwing lewd remarks to Buffy, but he always lends a hand to help the gang, even risking himself.
-   Joey from **Friends**, at least when it comes to the members of his group of friends. He hits on them on numerous occasions and tries several ploys to either see them naked or see them kiss each other, but when everyone believes Phoebe's been in a porno movie, Joey is the only member of the gang who refuses to watch it. He also freaks out quite a bit when Rachel calls his bluff and actually offers to sleep with him.
    -   Joey is so good to his female friends, that upon hearing Phoebe was pregnant, he goes out to beat up the supposed father... then comes back and proposes to Phoebe so she won't be alone. Later when he finds Rachel is the one who is actually pregnant, he promptly proposes to her too.
    -   In one episode, when a drunken Rachel responds favorably to his "How you doin'?" line, he tells Ross not to let her drink any more.
    -   In another, when he mentioned that he found a drunk girl passed out on the couch in his and Chandler's apartment (following a party), in response to everyone's horrified questions of "What did you do to her?", he rather angrily declares, "I put a blanket over her in case she was cold and a bucket next to her in case she needed to throw up!", making it abundantly clear that he never even **thought** about taking advantage of her.
-   Jack Harkness, from **Doctor Who** and **Torchwood**. Forget **ladies,** he's after the population of every galaxy. He is **introduced** in **Doctor Who** ogling an endangered Rose Tyler's behind through a pair of binoculars. True to the "chivalrous" part, he immediately goes to rescue her. And slaps the other soldier coming to ask him what he was doing on the bum, commenting that his was nice too. In a notable subversion of the trope, he's extremely committed when he's actually dating someone who's monogamous. He also refuses to do anyone with anyone else who's in a monogamous relationship — although all his friends keep randomly kissing him.
    -   Also of **Doctor Who**, Vislor Turlough also applies to a good degree.
-   Admiral Albert "Al" Calavicci from **Quantum Leap**. Lost his virginity at an age where most boys were still putting lizards in girl's lunchboxes. "I have been absolutely in love with every woman I have ever slept with — at **that** moment in time." He's easily Distracted by the Sexy and takes advantage of being a Virtual Ghost to peep to his heart's content. But he never stopped loving his first wife who remarried when it looked like he was killed in Vietnam, and the only thing he won't do for a woman he's involved with is keep it in his pants. And the surest way to press his button is to harm or belittle a woman. Don Juan needs to go knight this guy RFN.

-   **Happy Days**: The Fonz. His Cool factor kept him from being as perverted as many on this list, but as one episode showed, going even one day without **l'amour** was a severe trial to him. It also meant he rarely had to actually pursue a woman, unless the plot called for it.
-   Jay from **The Inbetweeners** is perpetually lying, in revoltingly graphic detail, about all the girls he has apparently had sex with even though he's obviously a virgin, and generally talks as though he thinks of women solely as sex objects. In one episode, though, he actually gets into a relationship, and has utter respect for his girlfriend's sexual boundaries, and is a pretty good boyfriend until he gets some bad advice from his father, who seems to believe that Stalking Is Love.
-   Dennis from **Just Shoot Me!** has moments of this towards Maya. A good example is the episode "Miss Pretty", where he is secretly the magazine's new advice columnist. When Maya asks for an interview, Dennis gets a friend of his (a scuzzbag who specializes in bogus lawsuits) to pose as the columnist. But when Maya starts dating him, Dennis becomes concerned, and eventually confesses to being Miss Pretty rather than have her go out with someone more depraved than he is.
-   **Power Rangers Dino Charge** has Chase, who has quite the reputation as a womaniser (prior to settling down with a girlfriend in Dino Supercharge), but was worthy enough to be chosen as a Ranger by an Energon, which only react to true heroism.
-   Francis Bryan in **The Tudors** showed signs of this during his first episode. He bluntly asked a woman to be his mistress and offered her an expensive necklace. He then told her that if she refused, he would bother her no more.
-   **Castle (2009)**: Richard Castle fits this to a T. He loves the ladies and will quite happily drop Double Entendres like nobody's business, but in one episode he befriends a call girl who is helping them solve a case. She comes to his house crying, with a black eye, and even when she tries to kiss him he refuses and insists on getting her medical attention.

-   The anti-heroic Prince Justin Greystone from **Wizards & Warriors**. He occasionally tears himself away from his wine and women to reluctantly do something noble.
-   Buck Wilmington from **The Magnificent Seven** TV series. Hits on/sleeps with every woman he meets but treats them all with respect. He attributes this to the fact he was raised in a brothel but his mother taught him to treat every woman like a lady.
-   Tristan, from **All Creatures Great And Small**, seemingly has a different nurse on his arm every week, but he also seems to treat them all beautifully.
-   Tony DiNozzo from **NCIS**. He started out as a regular The Casanova, hitting on every skirt he could find, and even after six seasons of character development is still interested, but he would never even think of hurting a woman. And his father is one as well.
-   Canalo from Kishiryu Sentai Ryusoulger is looking for a wife to preserve his bloodline. But he never forces the issue if the girl is not interested, in a relationship or engaged/married, and he's as heroic as the other characters on the side of good.
-   Hank Moody of **Californication** could qualify. While he sleeps with almost every woman he meets (including ones who hate him), he is usually the first to assault (read: knock out) anyone who either inappropriately insults a woman or mistreats them somehow.
-   James T. Kirk from **Star Trek: The Original Series**. In fact, for one episode, Spock and McCoy were clued in that something wasn't right with their captain (Kirk's jilted ex-lover was inhabiting his body), despite having no physical proof, because the fake captain had struck a woman (who the real Kirk was inhabiting).
    -   Kirk has two classes of women. There's the Girl of the Week with whom he's often only romancing as a means to save/protect his ship and crew. Then there are his genuine love interests who are strong, intelligent professionals who are just as Married to the Job as he is. With the exception of the mentally unhinged woman mentioned above, all those we meet in the present seem to still have a great deal of love for him.
-   Jack Tripper from **Three's Company**. He's had **numerous** Girls Of The Week and never passes an opportunity to get a kiss from either or both of his two female roommates, but he never actually goes any farther than that with his roommates and goes steady with his latest girlfriend in the series finale.
-   Captain Benjamin Franklin "Hawkeye" Pierce from **M\*A\*S\*H**, Depending on the Writer. For the most part, he sleeps around, but has defined morals; he appreciates the company of women for their own sake and he is contrasted with actual perverts in the form of '50s-style chauvinists, whom he opposes and he doesn't get along with the '50s masculine persona. In one oddly Out of Character episode where they believe the war is about to end, he's shown having three girlfriends, each of whom apparently believes she's in a serious, exclusive relationship with him. When they want to make plans for after the war, like a chickenshit he tells them he's been married all along.
-   Sam Axe from **Burn Notice**. He's certainly The Casanova and (for the first two seasons, at least) had a collection of sugar mamas, so we know he's appreciative of the ladies. But should you actually want to harm one? Run. Just run.
-   Dean Winchester from **Supernatural**. He flirts with most of the women he meets, but when we see him with Cassie, we find out that he really loved her, but she didn't believe him when he told her what he did for a living, breaking his heart as she left. And he isn't exactly thrilled when he discovers that his pal Castiel plans to hand a girl named Anna (a Fallen Angel whom Dean had slept with) over to the angels.
-   Jim Longworth from **The Glades** is constantly flirting with the married Callie but doesn't pressure her into cheating on her convict husband. When he prevented an imminent assault on her by a rapist breaking into her house, he didn't tell her so she wouldn't feel she owed him.
-   Don Draper of **Mad Men** is The Casanova **par excellence**, to the point where it costs him his marriage (combined with his pathological addiction to lying). However, he has serious problems with other men being crude and creepy around women (whatever he might be, he is never crude or creepy), particularly in the office; as he says to Peggy, "I have rules" about this sort of thing. When he breaks these rules and drunkenly seduces his secretary Allison in Season 4, it's used as an indication of how far he has fallen.
-   Damien Scott of **Strike Back** is a regular The Casanova but is usually honest with the women he sleeps with or at least as honest as being a secret government operative allows him to. When he is held captive together with a female hostage he quickly seduces her. However, once they are rescued he declines to have sex with her because he realizes that it would be taking advantage of her vulnerable emotional state.
-   Mel Frohike of **The X-Files** (and later spinoff **The Lone Gunmen**) is a short, squat, balding man with a Porn Stash that rivals Mulder's. His reaction to Scully was to openly ogle her and make comments on how attractive she was. However, he showed up at Scully's hospital room with flowers, he kept vigil on her while Mulder was hunting down her attackers, and he saved her from a hoard of randy men who were shamelessly taking advantage of her drugged-and-turned-to-a-bimbo state. When it comes to the Gunmen's own cases, he's fiercely protective of women unless he thinks they're pulling a Wounded Gazelle Gambit.
-   **The Legend of William Tell**: Will does like his ladies. This dropped off towards the end of the series. Xax also likes the women, but not quite so chivalrously.
-   **WKRP in Cincinnati**: When Johnny needs a temporary place to live, Bailey invites him to stay at her place, as a favor to a friend. When he suspects the worst in getting a mandatory vacation, she puts a positive spin on it and tells him to take advantage of his situation. He takes that cue to set up a romantic evening with her, but when she storms in furious over their coworkers jumping to conclusions about their staying together, he promptly drops the idea - then indignantly calls them out on it the next day.

-   Aramis in **The Musketeers**. He will flirt with any pretty lady he sees but is always polite and respectful towards them, never taking advantage of them and genuinely falls in love with some, including Queen Anne. This facet of his character gets lampshaded by the proto-feminist character, Comtesse De Larroque. "You are a contradiction Monsieur Aramis, a soldier who preaches love and a famous libertine who cherishes women."
-   Jack Stiles in **Jack of All Trades**. Understandable, considering he's played by Bruce Campbell. He's constantly hitting on his partner Emilia Rothschild, despite her insistence that she's not interested, as well as every other attractive woman who comes across his path (including Catherine the Great). In fact, his assignment to Pulau-Pulau is partly due to him sleeping with Thomas Jefferson's niece, whom he'd been sent to rescue. However, he will never force himself on any woman nor will he stand idly by while a woman is being abused, usually donning his Daring Dragoon outfit. Additionally, while he's clearly attracted to Emilia, he will not ruin their relationship and partnership by taking advantage of her while she's under influence. A memorable scene involves him tricking an attractive undergarments seller to model for him, claiming that he's picking out an intimate gift for his wife for their anniversary. He does end up buying one of them at the end of the episode... as a wrapper for the real, much more romantic, gift.
-   Neal Caffrey from **White Collar** flirts with every woman he meets, usually successfully, but he always cares about the women he sleeps with on a surprisingly deep level, as well as having a lot of respect for the women he has no romantic or sexual involvement with or interest in. Kate, Alex, Sara, Elizabeth, June, Ellen, Rebecca, Diana - he'd go to the ends of the earth to ensure their safety. too bad it didn't work for two of them, and one of them was manipulating him the entire time.
-   Johnson and Pal in **Sze U Tonight**, although this trope is played up more with Pal.
-   Both Autolycus and Joxer from **Xena: Warrior Princess**. Both leer at scantily-clad women quite openly, and yet in spite of their Jerkass tendencies, they both possess a heart of gold, being two of Xena's more loyal friends, and often acting for the greater good (even if Autolycus would never admit it).
-   Doc Holiday (yes, **that** Doc Holiday) from **Wynonna Earp** is always charming and happy to have casual, no-strings-attached sex with any attractive woman who offers (including the titular heroine). But he will not stare at a couple of lesbians making out, because he's a gentleman. And he's also **amazingly** up-to-date on feminism, considering he's been trapped down a well for the last 130 years (and before that, he was the kind of guy who'd make jokes about betting "wives and horses" on poker games...). He basically never says the wrong thing in the present, and even knows when to play the protective White Knight (i.e. when the woman is drunk and/or traumatized) and when not to insult a capable woman with any such controlling / infantilizing behavior. Yes, this show is written by a woman.
    
    **Doc:** **\[to a guy not taking a "no" from a very drunk Wynonna; pulls a knife\]** "Back aaaall the way up, friend. She ain't anybody's but her own.  
    **Doc:** **\[to a pregnant Wynonna\]** Things have changed since my day regarding male participation in these matters but I'll be as involved as you desire. No more, no less. All I want, and excuse me for being old-fashioned, is for you to be healthy and for you to be as close... **\[voice breaks\]** to happy as possible. And I will do anything; I will give anything to ensure it.
    
-   **Victorious**: Andre likes to chase girls and is also the nicest member of the main group. He treats the girls in his group with respect and even feels guilty when he starts developing feelings towards his best friend's girlfriend.
-   **Bonekickers**: Dolly. He often makes open sexual comments toward women (mostly Viv). She realizes he's joking though and doesn't cross the line. He clearly does care about Magwilde and her as well.
-   Dan Fielding from **Night Court**. In the first couple of seasons, he's a Metrosexual who's lucky with the ladies. From Season 3 on, he's a shameless lothario, quick with a leer and a come-on line. But he also takes pride both in always being honest about his intentions and leaveing his partners satisfied. His reputation is sublime or deplorable, depending on who's being asked.
-   Gus from **Psych** is a shamelessly flirtatious womanizer to the point where even Shawn is weirded out by his behavior. However when he is dating Rachael, he is hell bent on remaining a good and loyal partner to her and turns down the advances of two women in Season 7 for this reason. In one episode (before he met Rachael) he confides in Shawn that he genuinely wants to find a "special someone" similar to how Shawn has Jules.

Chivalrous Pervert Example in Music

-   Mr. DNA from Devo's **Smart Patrol/Mr. DNA** is an "Altruistic Pervert." While not explained further in the song, the connotations seem to indicate a chivalrous pervert.
-   A trend in 21st century rnb/rap songs is that a rapper will be rapping about a woman he saw in a club who he thinks is perfect and who he'll always treat right. This is popular enough to be the subject of most mainstream rnb these days.
    -   David Guetta and Akon's Sexy Chick/Bitch is one of the better examples, where the singer explicitly states "I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful."

---
Chivalrous Pervert Example in Pro Wrestling

-   WWE commentator Jerry "The King" Lawler is this in spades. He spends much of the Diva matches talking about the female wrestlers' "puppies" and other assets, but when one of them gets hurt, he's always the first one up to help, sometimes getting himself badly beaten when he tries to rescue a Diva in distress from a monster heel.
-   When Curry Man and Shark Boy burst into the knockouts locker room demanding The Beautiful People return SoCal Val's ring, Shark Boy's plan was to simply beat up Angelina Love and go through her stuff till they found it, but Curry Man insists on being diplomatic, but also insisted on Angelina going on a date with him.

---
Chivalrous Pervert Example in Roleplay

-   Paul Smith from **Survival of the Fittest** is one of these, although arguably he's slightly more pervert than chivalrous. Nevertheless, he still does care about the ladies' feelings... somewhat. It's also notable that he doesn't actually consider himself be a pervert.

---
Chivalrous Pervert Example in Theatre

-   Norman of **The Norman Conquests** by Alan Ayckbourn.
-   The Mrs. Hawking play series: Nathaniel's older brother, Justin Hawking. It's so reliable that the team ends up using that fact to lay a trap for a target.
-   Bobby, the protagonist of **CompanySondheim**, is this, with a dash of Handsome Lech. He has absolutely no problem with fooling around with multiple women and is clearly no stranger to one-night stands and casual sexual relationships, and the man can't make a commitment to save his life. But he's usually a perfect gentleman to everyone and is affectionate to his various girlfriends. He also knows where the line is; he playfully flirts with pretty much **all** of his female married friends, but even their husbands don't mind because they know Bobby would never **do** anything.

Chivalrous Pervert Example in Video Games

-   In the **.hack//G.U.** games: "I, Kuhn, cannot allow this atrocity to go any further!"
    -   He says this when a girl is wandering a dungeon alone - he wants to protect her. And then, he finds out her true age...
    -   Although he's a nice guy in general, and has a strong (albeit sometimes hidden) sense of justice, he is **particularly** nice to women. This backfires on him when he hits on a Cross Player in the sequel OVA.
        -   Saburou is generally fairly obvious as to "her" real gender, which just made it even more of an Epic Fail for Kuhn.
    -   Surprisingly, one of the characters he doesn't appear to be attracted to is Atoli. Of course, he's more of a Shipper on Deck with her and Haseo, which might be why...
    -   Ironically, Kuhn is Tomonari Kasumi, Mai Minase's boyfriend from **Liminality**. The audience gets the pleasure of seeing "the only serious girlfriend he ever had."
-   **Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War** has an entire **helicopter** full of them, in the form of the "Sea Goblin" Marine Ops team. They shamelessly flirt with Nagase, Wardog's sole female member, even while **rescuing her from behind enemy lines**, and later flirts with her some more when they meet again while rescuing Osea's kidnapped president. Despite this, they don't let it distract them from their missions, and keep their behavior strictly lighthearted.
-   Kaname Date from **AI: The Somnium Files** lives and breathes this trope, where he's often ogling the busty receptionist at Lemniscate or will steal panties if possible, to the point where his Robot Buddy Aiba will always factor in a porno magazine (real or imaginary) during battle simulations since he has ridiculously superhuman reaction times and speeds if he's told there is one nearby, which comes in handy if he needs to dodge bullets or get to a location **fast**. In the end, after re-obtaining his real body and starts a normal life, his horny tendencies have been toned down particularly around Hitomi. The sequel **gives a backstory** to his pornography superpowers and Hitomi happily engages in petplay with him.
-   Ezio in **Assassin's Creed II** was heading towards The Casanova route before the plot intervened. He still uses his charm to imply that he would be delighted to work closer with his female co-conspirators, but treats them with respect and can keep his mind on the job when necessary.
-   Bang Shishigami from **BlazBlue**.
    -   Kagura Mutsuki, one of the new characters for **BlazBlue: Chronophantasma**, takes this to a hilarious degree. Unlike Bang, however, he's quite the stud. He usually flirts with many a playable character, carries another woman into the match and tossing her up before showtime (only for her to land on him one way or another after the fight), and makes overt passes at Makoto (which gets him no small measure of pain). However, he sees the many ladies he interacts with as **people**; he cares for their well-being and will suffer none who visit harm upon them. Arakune learned this the hard way.
-   Jimmy Hopkins from **Bully**, while he can be a jerk and a player, he is always kind when it comes to a **truly** distraught woman. Maybe his motives are questionable, but still, he's a good person deep down.
-   Zevran Arainai plays around with this in **Dragon Age: Origins**. While he is a Professional Killer who wears The Casanova facade, when genuinely pursuing a relationship with someone, he switches into this mode. He makes a point of only having sex on an amateur basis, though. Sleeping with the target only makes things complicated.
    -   And his Distaff Counterpart, Isabela the Pirate Queen. While a **pirate** with some extremely dubious morals and an endless source of innuendo, she believes sex should always be fun for everybody involved. Men, women, men dressed as women, vice versa - even all at once, if the participants are willing! She and Zevran have actually met (as well as **met**) and they get along very well.
    -   In **both** cases, the option is there for a threesome (or more) with Zevran and/or Isabela, but it's your call (or the call of your other love interest) if it's acceptable. If not, they won't press the point. . . or if **you** do, flat-out say it's not going to happen since one person has a problem with it.
-   **Dragon Quest V**: Prince Harry has a soft spot for the ladies and is prone to flirting good-naturedly, though his marriage with Maria hampers that considerably.
-   Taiga in **Duel Savior Destiny** is clearly sex-crazed and willing to employ some dubious means to obtain it, but when he comes across someone genuinely innocent like the ninja Kaede he is unwilling to exploit the situation too far despite obvious signs that he could.
-   **Duke Nukem** has made it his life's mission to rescue Distressed Damsels from hideous, alien behemoths. But that doesn't mean he won't ogle them once he's saved them.
    -   It's also worth pointing out that he's otherwise a total Jerkass (one that is really funny). All of his dialogue is bragging about how awesome he is, he once wrote a book titled "Why I'm So Great", he throws money to strippers when any sane person would be evacuating them out of a war-zone, and he once vowed to a large alien monster to "rip your head off and shit down your neck" and **followed through with it**. He's never so much as once insulted a woman though.
-   **The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind** has Crassius Curio, a quest-giver and Councilor of Great House Hlaalu. Insists on calling the PC things like "dumpling" or "pumpkin pie," no matter the gender, and his first order is to see you naked. However, it's largely implied nothing **really** happens... and in any case, he's one of the few House Hlaalu councilors above the corruption of the Camonna Tong and is actively working to make Morrowind a better place. Curio also famously wrote a light pornographic play titled "The Lusty Argonian Maid", where the main characters are an Author Avatar named Crantius Colto and a female Argonian named Lifts-Her-Tail. Argonians are Lizard Folk. Curio's tastes apparently cross species boundaries as well. **Skyrim** introduces an equally filthy sequel, as well as a Gender Flipped version for the ladies, "The Sultry Argonian Bard".
-   Haken Browning from **Endless Frontier**. He has no qualms about giving people breast-themed nicknames and identifying women based on their rears, but he acts like a perfect gentleman to any woman who hasn't gotten on his bad side. Notably, the only time he brings up sex outright, he's politely offering it as payment for the use of a mermaid's ship. He never even makes any advances on his Love Interest, and agrees to turn off the lights when she finally makes the first move. "I wouldn't want to embarrass a fine lady like yourself."
-   **Fate/Grand Order**
    -   The Caster-class version of Cu Chulainn is introduced jumping into a battle on your side to defend Mash's life and her honor... and then compliments her behind.
    -   Rider Edward "Blackbeard" Teach plays up the appearance of a predatory paedophile, especially in the Okeanos chapter where he is determined to capture Euryale against her will. But as your Servant, he strongly implies it's just an act to mess with people and he'd never willingly harm a lady. His "Gentlemanly Love" skill provides extra healing to female or Ambiguous Gender allies.
-   Ready? Here comes the list of **Final Fantasy** poster boys for this trope:
    -   Desh in **Final Fantasy III**. Gave us the famous quote: "Hey, we have a ship! Now we can pick up girls from all over the world!". Makes an apparent Heroic Sacrifice soon after.
    -   Edge in **Final Fantasy IV**. A prince who will fight like a wildcat to protect his people, but never misses an opportunity to get close to pretty ladies.
    -   Edgar from **Final Fantasy VI**. A king who tells little girls he'll marry them when they grow up... and spends his days working as a Gadgeteer Genius to protect every last one of his subjects. He hits on Terra when Locke first brings her to Castle Figaro but is also willing to put himself (not to mention his own kingdom) in great risk in order to protect her from The Empire.
        
        **Kefka:** A girl of no importance recently escaped us, and we heard that she found refuge here...  
        **Edgar:** That's a tough one... You see, there're more girls here than grains of sand out there. I can't keep track of them all!
        
    -   Cloud in **Final Fantasy VII** is not automatically an example, but the game is set up to encourage the player to act like this, with other characters reacting appropriately. You can have him flirt with Jessie, flirt with Aeris, flirt with Tifa, flirt with Yuffie, flirt with Barret, flirt with a girl in a bee costume, check out girls on the beach, rub suntan lotion into the back of a Fanservice Extra, strike a pose and then **run** into a brothel shouting "Let's go!", peek through keyholes into other rooms at the brothel, and make a party out of himself and two of the girls (Barret: "Thought you'd do that.") You are also given the opportunity to mistreat the girls, but usually it's either jokes at their expense or misjudged negging. Whatever way you play him, he's extremely protective of the girls - even Yuffie, with whom he has a more argumentative relationship, he makes a point of comforting at times.
    -   Irvine in **Final Fantasy VIII**. It's mostly an act, at times even bordering on Have I Mentioned I Am Heterosexual Today? -practically the first thing that he does upon meeting the team is to suggest a party composition of himself and two of the girls, but as the plot unfolds it becomes clear that he's actually still hopelessly infatuated with his childhood crush and his biggest concern is looking out for his friends.
    -   Zidane in **Final Fantasy IX** is practically the poster boy for the series alongside Edgar. He actually has "Protect Girls" as a support skill which lets him intercept attacks on women, and is constantly flirting with females throughout the game. He also subverts Can't Act Perverted Toward a Love Interest, as he shamelessly makes passes at Garnet the entire game, though he backs off slightly when he realizes he's actually in love with her. There's also an instance when he touches Garnet's butt by accident, and his immediate response is remarking how soft it is.
        -   **Dissidia Final Fantasy** reveals that not even gods and Eldritch Abominations are off-limits to him, as his battle quote to the Cloud of Darkness is "You are impressive, in more ways than one", and when Cosmos appears before him he instantly replies "Today's not a good day for a date".
    -   If we're putting all the **Final Fantasy** examples together, add political mastermind Al-Cid Margrace (NOT Cid) in **Final Fantasy XII** and, more obviously, **Final Fantasy Tactics A2**.
        -   Similar to Zidane, Al-Cid in A2 has most of his combat abilities become stronger the more female units there are in your party on the battlefield. He also has one or two abilities that only work on females! To drive the point even further, when you fight him and his party of ladies before he joins your party, the law forbids you from harming females!
        -   Balthier gets this characterization in the **Final Fantasy XII** manga, romancing Ashe before he even knows her name. The original game gave him shades of this, but it was rather subtle about it compared to the manga's interpretation.
    -   Haurchefant from **Final Fantasy XIV** in the Japanese dialogue. He's shown to be a brave, helpful and caring man, but constantly compliments and hits on the player character, at one point offering them a place in his own bed to help them "warm up." Heavily downplayed in English, French and German translations due to cultural differences.
-   It's practically a **Fire Emblem** tradition to have at least one of these in each game.
    -   Alec from **Genealogy of the Holy War**. Though if he gets married, he sort of quits flirting for the sake of his wife. Doesn't stop him about complimenting women in general, though (as described with his last dialogue with Brigid, if paired).
        
        **Brigid:** What's Chalpy like?  
        **Alec:** It's a country full of beautiful girls.  
        **Brigid:** Alec! You better not try to double-time with me!  
        **Alec:** Okay, okay, I know...
        
    -   Saul from **Binding Blade** alternates between preaching and flirting with every woman he sees. He even straight out tells Elen, another priest, that he's loose and may do "undesirable things" to her, but she thinks he's better than that. (His other female supports, like Cecilia, tend to see through his religious charade easily though.) But when he gets serious, well, **he does get serious**: if you promote him and make him face the Sinister Minister Oro, Saul is clearly PO'd to see a fellow clergy member playing the villain role, and tells him "You disgrace the Gods, and you **will** pay for that!".
    -   **The Blazing Blade** has perhaps the series' best example: Sain. He knows how knights in this particular genre of game pick up women, so he inserts a lot of stereotypically "knightly" phrases into his speech. Which would probably work, if anyone else in the game talked like that. He does a lot of stuff — like trying a "heroic" pose with a lance in the middle of a fight, but in the process forgetting the Tactical Rock–Paper–Scissors and taking an axe to the face for his trouble — that show how he's trying to be honorable and heroic but is really just perverted and hilarious. Sadly, he shows up less and less as the game gets Darker and Edgier, and notably has no plot-mandated lines after the Disc-One Final Boss. Darn shame. So many good opportunities missed.
        -   Despite this, he never had any support talks with his lord, stating a more professional relationship between him and Lyn. Also, he is one of the few guys who can distract a girl from her troubles in their supports (Priscilla's conflicted feelings for Raven, Fiora's Survivor Guilt after losing her squad, Serra demanding vassalage as a part of her Stepford Smiler facade, Isadora's angst over her relationship with Harken).
        -   It's worth emphasizing: Aside from Kent, Sain **only** has women in his support list!
        -   Sain has no support talk with Lyn because she's already taken: His best friend Kent has a huge Bodyguard Crush on her. So, he steps aside for his friend, and openly tells him so in their supports. (Heck, Sain's dying quote is: "Lady Lyndis, I was... so happy...!") And then Fridge Brilliance kicks in: Sain fears that if he ever **was** alone with Lyn, he'd give in and declare his love for her, which in his mind could be a potential betrayal against his closest buddy. He's a perv, but he's not stupid!
    -   To a lesser extent, Forde from **Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones** fits this bill. He does flirt with Vanessa a bit and teases Kyle about his love life, but he's not **too** forward and is still dedicated to serving Ephraim.
    -   Bastian from **Path of Radiance** fits the bill. Add Shakespearian dialogue to the mix as well.
        -   Gatrie fromt the same game is re-recruited later in the game while protecting Astrid and he won't be recruited back into the Greil Mercenaries unless she talks to him first. Shinon snarks Gatrie would hit on a tree if it had a skirt on.
        -   The sequel, **Radiant Dawn**, adds Heather. She flirts with several girls (Nephenee, Mia, Ilyana) and once stripped a guy who fancied her from all his gold, but her main motivation is her ill mother whom she supports and loves very much.
    -   Virion from **Fire Emblem: Awakening** qualifies, but errs more on the side of 'Chivalrous' rather than 'Pervert'. He's a shameless flirt who spouts reams of flowery compliments upon the ladies, often throwing in a proposal even if he's only just met them, and it's been repeatedly and strongly implied that he sleeps around quite a bit (whether with maids or noblewomen). He actually has incredibly high standards for how a lady ought to be treated and will react with appropriate vengeance if he feels someone else has violated those terms. Not to mention, when he learns about a girl's boundaries, he will **not** step over them; i.e., when he learns that Olivia is too shy to learn a duet dance from him, he **goes to the other side of the room and teaches her from there**.
        -   Unsurprisingly, he becomes quite offended and/or hurt (depending on who he's talking to) if anyone suggests his intentions are anything but honorable. (Which separates him from the likable and cheery but-more-loose, bed-hopping Inigo, no not that Inigo. And it's really Hilarious in Hindsight when you recall that Virion **is** one of Inigo's potential fathers, should you make him romance Inigo's future mother — who **happens** to be the aforementioned Olivia)
        -   To a milder degree, there's Gregor. Quite a few of his supports with females involve him teasing them about having crushes on him, but he tries to serve as a matchmaker for Cordelia despite his possible feelings for her and **never** forces the girls into anything they don't want to do. In his support with the Avatar, Gregor suggests ways for him/her to keep up his/her health... such as sharing body heat with him in bed.
    -   Laslow from **Fire Emblem Fates** is rather loose, flirty, and implied to sleep around or at least try to, but he's also capable of giving rather wise advice to his friends (specially his partner Peri) and holds Undying Loyalty to his lord, Prince Xander. That's because he **is** the aforementioned Inigo, only Older and Wiser after becoming a Dimensional Traveler.
    -   In **Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia**, the mercenary Jesse is always fawning over women but will go to any lengths to help a Damsel in Distress. In fact, Celica recruits him from an infamous pirate's dungeon, since he got captured trying to save a girl named Est. Heck, when he changes class in a Shrine to Mila, his promotion line sounds a LOT like **he's flirting with a goddess**!
        -   Jesse also rescues Silque (with **far** more success) before the start of the game, as seen in a Memory Prism flashback. Afterwards, she notes he's much friendlier than she assumed at first. It suggests that his rescues are out of genuine concern, despite all his flirting.
    -   Lorenz from the **Fire Emblem: Three Houses** also seems to fit the bill. In his case, he keeps trying to "charm" women because he's sizing them up as a potentially suitable wife (which he sees as his responsibility as a noble in order to forge ties for his House) and seems **shocked** when Byleth has to explicitly tell him it's making them uncomfortable, but he never treats any girl he supports with like anything less then a lady, even if they are commoners like Dorothea, Leonie or Mercedes.
        -   Sylvain flits between this and Handsome Lech. On the one hand, he's known as a skirt-chaser and has a reputation for dating girls for a short while before breaking up with them as he secretly believes they are only dating him for his Crest and thus holds them in contempt and Byleth even walks in on him being accused of cheating in their C-support. (Also unlike Inigo, Sylvain is definitely not unsuccessful at scoring girls.) However, despite this, Sylvain confirms that while he is a heartbreaker, he really doesn't enjoy it and hates seeing a girl cry. His interactions with Bernadetta and Marianne also prove he does care about their feelings - he never flirts with Bernadetta because he knows she's too emotionally fragile for it and genuinely compliments her writing skills instead, and in his Supports with Marianne when he sees his behaviour is making her uncomfortable, he immediately backs off and instead gently encourages her to smile because he believes it will help her be more confident when interacting with others.
-   Advocat of **GrimGrimoire** flirts with students and makes blatant innuendos towards almost everyone, however he takes his role as teacher and protector very seriously and is highly honourable, especially compared to other demons.
-   Johnny from **Guilty Gear** is the head of a crew of air pirates and a guy with LOTS of contacts in-story. He's a master of iaido and a very stylish man, with Cool Shades and Badass Longcoat (as well as an enormous nice hat and an epic voice). And he flirts with **every** female character that crosses his path. Those pirates, by the way? All girls. **Young** girls (and all of them are orphans, like Johnny himself, who gave them a home as he took them into his Badass Crew), with the exception of the cook. And then **XX** has him flirting with Bridget, who is revealed to be male. But alongside these little details, he's extremely badass as a fighter **and** much smarter than he looks, being able to keep up with people as powerful and competent as Ky and Testament, and while he's definitely not a law-abider, he's usually on the good side of the axis. **And** he cares for the safety of all the girls in his crew: should someone harm one of them, Johnny will NOT be happy.
    -   Axl Low is also very flirty with the ladies of the cast, especially Millia and I-no, although he has a girlfriend Megumi back in his original time he is dedicated to getting back to, and in **\-STRIVE-** we learn that I-no actually **is** Megumi from another timeline, which would explain why Axl is the only person in the cast who can get the odd act of kindness out of her. He is also a quintessential British gentleman and Nice Guy - even the anti-social Anti-Hero Sol Badguy treats him like a buddy.
-   Gruff of **Heavy Metal F.A.K.K.²** is a Witch Doctor of Ambiguous Species living at the edge of Mooagly Swamps. He bluntly compliments the heroine's sexappeal in onoxiously loud and hammy fashion, but not before rescuing her from a bunch of Dark Creepers. He also further helps hern on her quest by providing much exposition ... and a chaingun.
-   Benimaru Nikaido from **The King of Fighters** is an excellent and good-looking fighter who's clearly VERY full of himself and willing to hit on almost all the pretty girls in his surroundings — but he also chides his best friend Kyo on his borderline neglectful Long-Distance Relationship with his girlfriend Yuki, refuses to hit on a girl who's clearly too young for him at age 14 (though he'll complain about it and will be horrified when said girl overhears him), whines when Yuri sees through him but doesn't insist, treats Athena with the due respect owed to a fellow fighter when she tells him not to look down on her ("I see that you're a warrior more than a little girl anyway"), and when push comes to shove he's a very loyal friend and companion.
-   Hyo Amano from **The Last Blade** flirts a lot with Hibiki, but also supports her when needed and shows concern over her Superpowered Evil Side. Is it also awkward that both he and the aforementioned Kyoraku are voiced by Akio Ōtsuka in Japanese?
-   Jansen Friedh from **Lost Odyssey** fits this trope to perfection. He joins your party with a woman on each arm and stone drunk and shortly afterwards falls hard for a Stripperiffic amnesia-ridden immortal queen, acting overprotective at every turn. Hilarity Ensues.
    -   Ironic in that, by comparison, Jansen is the one that needs protecting, as said queen is arguably the best magic user in the game.
        -   Jansen is a powerful mage in his own right: the real irony comes from the fact that, even **before** she gets her memory back, Ming is arguably more chivalrous and self-sacrificing than him.
-   Dekar in the **Lufia** series has a habit of flirting with just about every woman he comes across...and typically making a complete fool of himself in the process. Even in **Curse of the Sinistrals**, when he's in an actual relationship with fellow party member Tia, he still entertains the thought of marrying every woman who's interested in him.
-   From **Mass Effect**, Joker. However, the perversion is mostly implied with him and doesn't come out too much in dialogue.
-   The **Mega Man Legends** incarnation is a champion of justice who has a nasty habit of peeping at his adoptive sister in the bath.
-   Roy Campbell of **Metal Gear** is shown to be this in **Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops**. Namely, Roy has attempted to give advice to his fellow soldiers that prove to be completely inappropriate for the soldiers' current situation despite the similar wording (For example, if a soldier attempts to call Campbell asking for advice in regards to distance between themselves and the enemy that is far enough away to not trigger an alert, and he ended up giving advice about personal space in regards to dating a girl.), as well as teased Snake about getting a girl like Elisa into joining his side as he thinks that she's about five years too young to be sexually mature. However, he has shown himself to have quite a bit of restraint in regards to dating girls: For instance, he passed an opportunity to date a girl he had an attraction to for his brother's sake (they were both attracted to the same girl) and joined the Green Berets. This carries over to **Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots**, where he's in a relationship with the much-younger Rose. This is all a ruse to keep the Patriots from finding out that Rose's child is Raiden's, thus trying to prevent them from using Rose and the baby as leverage against him.
-   **Metro Exodus**: Alyosha definitely has an eye for the ladies and frequently brags about his exploits, but under his crude exterior he is actually quite the romantic. He himself claims that the reason he is rarely seen with any women in the Metro is that the women there want to find a husband and provider, while he is only interested in short-term romances and doesn't want to string anyone along. He also never makes a pass at Katya, noticing that she has fallen hard for Stepan. His whirlwind romance with Olga is pure romance novel fluff, and very sweet.
-   **Mortal Kombat**: Johnny Cage starts off story mode of part 9 as a straight-up Casanova Wannabe, hitting on a very exasperated Sonya Blade and not taking no for an answer. But right after he beats her up when she attacks him to shut him up, his expression is one of contrition and he makes it a point to defend her from Kano right after, which does earn him her gratitude. In the flashback of his chapter in **Mortal Kombat X**, he's much more respectful, deferring to her lead and after defeating Shinnok, gently cradles her as she regains consciousness. The smile on his face when she calls him "Johnny" says it all.
-   Gannayev in **Neverwinter Nights 2 Mask of the Betrayer** starts out as a jaded Casanova but a female player can turn him into a Chivalrous Pervert instead, with a little care.
-   Issun from **Ōkami** is an example heavy on the "Pervert" and light on the "Chivalrous". He blatantly ogles women, is introduced climbing into Sakuya's robe to nestle himself in her bosom, and even encourages Rao to relieve herself in the ocean while he and Amaterasu are there. This becomes a character flaw in the second act; as he believes that Beauty Is Goodness, he is initially suspicious of Queen Himiko (thinking she is plotting something bad) and completely taken in by Rao (who is actually an evil Kitsune and the real source of all of Western Nippon's problems). When Ninetails later murders Himiko, Issun takes her death poorly and passionately urges Ammy to avenge her death.
-   **Persona**:
    -   Junpei Iori in **Persona 3** makes some pretty lecherous comments towards the girls on the team, but when push comes to shove, he's always got their back, as best seen in his **Persona 3 Portable** Social Link. After all, it's because of his kindness that Chidori Yoshino falls in love with him.
    -   Yosuke Hanamura from **Persona 4** is also pretty perverted, given how he fanboys over Rise Kujikawa and at one point encourages the girls to wear swimsuits that **he himself picked out**. Somehow, his eventual roommate Teddie is an even bigger perv who's constantly trying to "score" with women. Nonetheless, both of them are good friends and dependable teammates who are wholly invested in the team's goal of foiling the killer, and Yosuke in particular is absolutely disgusted when he finds out just how misogynistic the killer is.
    -   Ryuji Sakamoto from **Persona 5** is not above peeking on his closest female friend when he has the chance to, but he's a still kindhearted boy who always respects a woman's physical boundaries and hates people who don't, which is one of the many reasons why he absolutely hates Kamoshida.
    -   In general, the player characters from **3** onward can be this depending on your chosen actions and dialogue. In particular, **5**'s protagonist seems to be this no matter what; the whole reason he's on probation to begin with is that he tried to save a woman from being molested, but he's not above peeping on Ann Takamaki during cutscenes.
-   The Adventure Sphere of **Portal 2** spends about half his screentime hitting on Chell and commenting on how beautiful she is. However, he also sincerely wants to help her and is obviously harmless, so his advances come off as endearing. It helps that he's one of the only characters that actually seems to sincerely **like** Chell.
-   Winfield from **Record of Agarest War** is this, across all the Generations. It becomes more apparent in the Second Generation, when his character is given more limelight - notably, hitting on Sharona, with Ellis giving the aside that he could use some slapping around.
    -   Thoma also shares this trait, much to Ellis' and the others' (except for Winfield, for obvious reasons) dismay. Though this turns out to be nothing more than a front so that when his time comes to keep the age-old promise, his other comrades aren't too bothered by it. This unfortunately doesn't go according to what he intended and only makes them more attached in a way he didn't foresee.
    -   Jainus from **Record of Agarest War 2** hits on every attractive woman in sight but at least knows where to draw the line and immediately backs off if he makes the girls uncomfortable.
-   In **Rune Factory 4,** Arthur is a Chivalrous Covert Pervert. He's a kind wise prince and businessman who believes in being polite and kind to everyone... and he also admits having a fondness for looking at girls in swimsuits. When the protagonist chooses to date him, he is both incredibly polite towards her and clearly lusting after her, being the only Love Interest besides The Tease Leon who implies that when he's visiting your room, he'd much rather be doing something other than talking.
-   Zimos from **Saints Row: The Third** is a rather surprising case in that he's an old pimp who helps the boss dominate the prostitution industry in Steelport. That being said, he seems to genuinely care for his hoes, even allowing them to unionize, trying to comfort them as you take them off the hands of the Syndicate and the hitman missions he asks of you involve killing people who dare hit his women.
-   Magoichi Saika from **Samurai Warriors** is portrayed as a ladies' man and a shameless flirt, but is nothing but gracious towards women and flatly refuses to take advantage of Gracia Hosokawa, portrayed in the game as a teenage tagalong who idolizes and follows him around.
-   Gilder of **Skies of Arcadia** seems to be one of these. He certainly doesn't go after Fina or Aika, and has a sense of humour about it - even if Vyse chooses to tell him that his motto comparing women and sunsets ("beautiful, but there will be another one tomorrow") is messed up when they first meet.
-   Ernie Eaglebeak of **The Spellcasting Series**. While he Really Gets Around as a rule, he does rescue a drugged Gretchen from a fraternity party. She attempts to jump his bones back at his place, but she passes out and Ernie leaves her be out of chivalry.
-   In **Star Fox**, Panther Caroso may be The Casanova, but he still cares about who he woos, making him this.
-   Kyle from **Suikoden V**. Note that he actually **is** a Knight.
-   **Tales Series**:
    -   Loni from **Tales of Destiny 2** flirts with several women, but won't lead them on and will back off (after trying to persuade them) if they're not interested. Being the Butt-Monkey, he's not very successful in his endeavours, especially due to some of his preferences towards women. Once he lets go of this view and stops flirting with others so much, he becomes more successful in attracting Nanaly.
    -   Zelos from **Tales of Symphonia**. He heaps compliments on **every** woman he sees, which includes cutely complimenting little girls and flattering old women with sweet-talk. It actually benefits him to talk to every female character he sees, as they'll give your party items if Zelos is in the lead.
    -   **Tales of the Abyss** gives us Emperor Peony, who is a hopeless, incorrigible flirt, going so far as to be just about the only person who actually encourages Gold Digger Anise and flirts back at her. However, he's all talk: rumor around the city has it that he's still pining for a love he was forced to give up on ten years ago (who just happens to be Jade's sister).
    -   Spada Belforma from **Tales of Innocence**, at least when it comes to Ange.
    -   **Tales of Vesperia**:
        -   Raven is this, flirting incessantly with the female party members (not that Judith does much to discourage him), while having a chivalrous side that becomes especially noticeable halfway through the game. It also helps that he's actually a knight captain. Hell, even as **Schwann** he'll compliment Judith's beauty if she's in the party during the boss fight with him.
        -   Yuri manages to be this **and** a Celibate Hero. He's not afraid to appreciate Judith's figure and can, playfully, flirt with Estelle or Rita at times. Still, he shows no signs of being interested in romance.
    -   **Tales of Zestiria** has Zaveid, a wind seraph who never, **never** stops flirting with every woman he meets, hitting relentlessly on party members in the post-fight Victory Pose skits. He also respects personal boundaries and backs off when things get serious. The prequel **Tales of Berseria** strongly indicates that it's helping him get over his lover who turns into a dragon and dies during **Berseria**, and that he just isn't ready for anything truly serious.
-   **Tekken**: The silver-haired demon himself, Lee Chaolan, has become a combination of this and Lovable Sex Maniac over the course of the games, at least once he stopped caring about taking over the Mishima Zaibatsu. He was a bit too.... touchy-feely with Alisa in **Tekken 6**, prompting her to go into self-defense mode to fend him off. Despite this, he's extremely affable to both her and Lars throughout the story mode, very sincerely helpful to them, and repairs Alisa at the end. **Tekken: Blood Vengeance** sees him cheerfully offer shelter and protection to her and Xiaoyu when he discovers them at night; and 7 sees him calmly talk an Amnesiac Alisa down when she attacks him again, and reunite her with Lars, treating her kindly like a real person in the same way Lars does. **Tag Tournament 2** also shows him to be a fairly Benevolent Boss to his female employees, his constant hitting on his Fight Lab assistant notwithstanding, and he's surrounded only by several **very** willing women in his ending in **5**.
-   **Turovero: The Celestial Tower**: Ruby is a female example, as she is known for talking about (and flirting with) cute girls, making dirty jokes, and is constantly trying to hook up her friends Leilia and Edric. In an optional late-game scene, she confesses that her flirting and playing matchmaker stem from her unfulfilled desire to be in a relationship during her previous life, as well as her desire for her friends to experience the same.
-   **World of Warcraft** has an example similar to the Morrowind one: The **Steamy Romance Novels**. The books detail the adventures of Marcus, a paladin who appears to spend more time sampling the races of Azeroth than fighting the undead/demons. While he spends much time and ink describing the various beauties he encounters, he's never coercive. If a girl turns him down, he's perfectly happy to go off in search of greener pastures. Also, he's very up-front about both the fact that he's writing a book and the fact that he can't start a relationship because he's in the Argent Crusade. And he uses protection (alongside sheepskin condoms, magical protection also exists apparently).
-   **Yakuza: Like a Dragon**:
    -   Ichiban might not be above cheating on six different women **at least**, but he's also well above forcing himself onto them as well as Slut-Shaming, especially if they're sex workers with little other choice. Him being born and raised in a soapland<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> might have something to do with that.
    -   Adachi might be the one who Really Gets Around in the party, but even he's willing to put himself on the line to make Kume and his Bleach Japan cronies eat pavement for their Slut-Shaming and for mocking Nonomiya's death.

Chivalrous Pervert Example in Visual Novels

-   Klavier Gavin from **Ace Attorney**, will flirt with pretty much **anyone**, but doesn't take well to the suggestion that he doesn't treat his "lovers" (or guitars) well, and is an all-around Nice Guy.
    -   From **Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth 2**, Tateyuki Shigaraki's (Raymond Shields from the Fan Translation) first order of business whenever he starts a conversation with a woman is to ask them for a hug. He typically gets rejected on the spot, but this doesn't stop him from being one of the genuinely nicest people in the game, and being polite to the people he respects.
-   Ikki from **Amnesia: Memories**. He's a complete chick magnet and has had many relationships already, with his teasing comments and innuendoes making it clear that he's also very experienced in bed. But he never forces his partner into advancing further than she feels comfortable with. One memory of the heroine's shows Ikki flat-out saying this to the girl he's agreeing to date — it'll be a physical relationship, but he won't force her into anything she's not okay with. Even in **Later**, when he does want his relationship with the heroine to get physically intimate, he mostly asks if she's ready to go further and only once ends up pushing her boundaries beyond what she's comfortable with. And that's because he's kinda drunk, and he immediately apologizes for his actions and pushing her.
-   Keenan Caine from **Bliss Stage: First and Final Act** is this in spades:
    
    "Yukiko is my anchor, my friend and my one true love. She comes first. The moment she tells me she's uncomfortable with my... activities with Mulan is the moment they cease."
    
-   Youhei Sunohara from **CLANNAD**.
-   **Ikemen Sengoku**:
    -   Masamune Date is extremely flirty and has No Sense of Personal Space where the female main character is concerned but when she tells him that he can't just kiss her whenever he wants because she wants to be aware and the mood to be right before they kiss, he complies with her wishes and never pushes her into doing anything more with him before she's ready.
    -   Shingen Takeda makes Masamune look downright prudish with his endless supply of cheesy pickup lines and shamelessly brazen flirting with the MC, but the MC's friend Sasuke assures her that he's never forced himself on a woman and will back down if he senses that she's not interested. He also sticks to his promise that he won't leave his designated mat whenever he visits her room unless she invites him to join her (except for one time, and that was just to kiss her wrist before he left) and immediately backs off when she turns down his offer of a one-night stand.
-   **Minotaur Hotel**: Luke is a shameless flirt and sex addict, but that doesn't change the fact that he legit cares about you and Asterion, and will do his best to be a good friend to everyone.
-   Kurt from **Nicole** is a shameless flirt who pretty much never lets up on the one-liners, innuendos, and come-ons — but he never tries to pressure Nicole into anything, and if she doesn't resist when he first tries to kiss her, he pulls back and becomes upset because it's clear that she's not into it, and he's not interested in kissing her if she doesn't feel the same way.
-   Goemon in **Nightshade** openly admits to "having fun" with ladies. However he will only have sexual relationships with those who know what they are getting into, which is why he doesn't do more than flirt with Enju. He can tell she is inexperienced in the romance department.
-   Makoto Itou from **School Days** can potentially be played this way if the player makes the right choices. He has a seemingly limitless sex drive, will lay any girl who so much as gives him an invitation, and is not above lustfully masturbating in the privacy of his room. That being said, when he isn't been driven by his carnal urges, he can be a surprisingly upstanding Nice Guy who hates bullying, respects boundaries, and will occasionally even be Above the Influence and reject a girl's advances. Having said that, his good nature is often a liability, as it leads him to being indecisive and unable to bring himself to say no, leading him to carry on a simultaneous relationship with at least two young women in spite of the damage it causes.
-   The player character of the Dating Sim **True Love Junai Monogatari**. He shamelessly comments on seeing girls' panties and the size of their breasts, would clearly love to get laid by any beautiful girl he meets, **and** one of the first talks to his Childhood Friend Mikae involves him potentially asking her for a lay. However, he won't force a girl to do anything she doesn't want to do and is disgusted by the misogynistic statements made by the school's resident womanizer Toshio. Heck, there are **several** events in which he must either go the Rescue Romance way ( saving Remi from a kidnapping, rescuing Mayumi from a rapist) or be Above the Influence ( not kissing Ryouko when she's angry at her brother, thinking twice about hugging Yumi-sensei when she's drunk)
-   Battler Ushiromiya from **Umineko: When They Cry** attempts to grope every girl he sees, expecting it to fail and for the expected slap to lighten the mood. Especially odd as many of those girls are his cousins. However, when Shannon actually appears to be about to let him grope her, Battler freaks out and scolds her not to do that since he's actually uncomfortable with taking advantage. Not only that, but in **Legend of the Golden Witch** he insists that Shannon has the right to smack him if he gets within 10cm of her breasts — and the **obligation** to if he gets within 2cm. The Umineko fighting game makes Battler's love of groping into **one of his attacks**. Seriously, it has to be seen to be believed.
    -   Rudolf, his father, is also somewhat on this territory, although he also has an unfortunate tendency to cheat on his wife.
    -   Ange's bodyguard, Jugo Amakusa, also qualifies. He got fired by her aunt and guardian Eva for disobeying instructions not to talk to Ange while he was on duty. Never mind talk to her, he hit on her!
-   **Zero Escape**:
    -   Akane from **Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors** combines this with Single-Target Sexuality. When she and Junpei search the 2nd class cabins she makes multiple sexual comments, including suggestion to take shower together. Later, during the infamous elevator scene she manages to describe her fear of drowning in the most sexual way possible, heavily turning Junpei on, before he realised what she's talking about. Considering their Mindlink it's very likely that she knew what's going on through his head and was teasing him on purpose. At the same time, she's a Nice Girl and it's pretty clear that she really loves him. For better or worse her naughtiness is almost completely gone in **Zero Time Dilemma**.
    -   Sigma from **Virtue's Last Reward** is basically a complete pervert. He doesn't exactly try to hide it either - he gets explicitly turned on by Clover pulling on a lever due to comparing it to a certain sexual act; in one ending when he's stuck in the facility, he laments that it's not so bad because he's the only fertile man among 4 young women; and asks Clover, Luna, and Phi for "swimsuit action" as a reward. Except he does genuinely care about them all, and obviously values them as people. Especially Luna, whom it's made clear that he has a strong bond of trust with. His attraction to Luna also seems to go beyond just perversion, since it's mentioned a number of times that his favorite things about Luna are her warm smile and cheery voice.
    -   In **Zero Time Dilemma**, Sigma's love interest for that game, Diana, starts dissolving into alcoholism after being stuck in the underground shelter with Sigma for months on end begins to mess with her emotionally. One night she gets very drunk and asks Sigma to have sex with her. Sigma flat-out refuses, even after Diana insults him for not being a real man for it, and instead tries to get her to stop drinking. After Sigma mentions Diana's abusive ex-husband to her, the two begin to overcome their emotional trauma by supporting each other, resulting in them having romantic sex. Diana ends up falling pregnant and giving birth from this to a daughter and son, the former of which is her and Sigma's currently dead best friend, while the latter is the terrorist mastermind who locked everyone in the underground shelter in the first place.

Chivalrous Pervert Example in Web Animation

-   Boomstick from **DEATH BATTLE!** is unashamedly obsessed with gorgeous women and prone to making boasts about his sexual prowess, but he's perfectly respectful of strong, gifted women (and chides his misogynistic Grandpappy Boomstick for deeming them the weaker sex), refuses to make double entendres about female combatants if they are underage (like Toph and Yang), and objects to Batgirl having a codename based off the male Batman's, because "her individuality and identity shouldn't have to be anchored to the patriarchal idea that women are publicly defined by the men in their life".
-   Oddly enough, despite being the Sin of Lust, Asmodeus from **Helluva Boss** is an example. Sure, he'll get all up in your face and sing about how lust is superior to love, lyrics dripping with innuendo. However, his relationship with Fizzaroli is built on genuine love despite their claims to the contrary. Plus, he refuses to give people love potions as he feels that they're "artificial bullshit".
-   Tucker from **Red vs. Blue** is constantly making smutty comments, but usually treats the female cast members with respect.

Chivalrous Pervert Example in Webcomics

-   Lawrence Spectrum from **Monsterful**. A playful ghost who even though he tends to nosebleeds a lot from many situations he is a very respectful young fellow, he's just very lucky that he's very cute. He especially respects older woman and tends to be a funny innocent pervert with her two best friends Sapphire and Lily, specially with Lily who he teases a lot.
-   Sam from **Sluggy Freelance**. He is a particularly goofy example, highly incompetent and easily distracted even after becoming a Sampire, but he does mean well and has managed to help save Zoe on at least two occasions.
    -   Sam thinks he's a Casanova and ends up being a Chivalrous Pervert in spite of himself.
-   Tedd from **El Goonish Shive**. I mean seriously, **Grace** has used the X-Ray on his glasses more than **he**!
    -   Elliot had this as part of his early characterization, before it marched on.
    -   Ashley turns out to be one as well: she has all kinds of fantasies about recklessly and gratuitously transforming others in sexual ways, but she is such a good person that she would **never** actually **do** any of those things without permission.
-   Rainer from **MSF High** is either this or the Handsome Lech. Amongst other things, he's used his 360 vision to look up girls' panties, attempted to have one of his friends turned into a cute girl. (By the Friendly Neighborhood HIVE MIND!), and one telepath mentioned his mind 'was like a sewer'. Still, he's a really nice guy who has helped couples get together, at risk, (or LOSS) of his own life!
-   Jake Packard in **ISO** is this trope to a T. Even the Guys Want Him and there's almost no one he won't hump, but he's actually genuinely sweet and honorable and won't go an inch further than he's been permitted to.
-   Joe Rosenthal from **It's Walky!**. Started out as a Lovable Sex Maniac ("every 50th girl gets a coupon for half-off any entree at Fazoli's<small>◊</small>", note that this adds up to some 40+ coupons), but over the years he became quite chivalrous.
-   This page of **TwoKinds** sums up Eric's motivation for preventing genocide quite nicely.
-   **Bittersweet Candy Bowl**, When the well-being of Daisy or Lucy is in danger, Paulo tends to forget his perversion in favor of helping them or, at least, trying to. He also reacted this way when Sue got hurt in Confrontation.
-   Minmax the Unstoppable Fighter of **Goblins** humiliates his adventuring partner by calling out the charisma stats of every woman he walks past on the street, but upon finding out that his idol Dellyn Goblinslayer is raping and torturing a captured yuan-ti girl, Minmax flings Dellyn through a window and beats him almost to death. When the yuan-ti comes along with Minmax and Forgath, Minmax goes out of his way to loophole his own principles which say he should just kill her for XP, and respects the fact that she understandably Hates Being Touched. Earlier on, he tells off Drowbabe for not remotely resembling a real woman: "It's like you're created by some lonely, horny teenage guy who's never kissed a girl and has no idea how women react realistically in any situation!"
-   Fedya from **Rhapsodies** will hit on just about anything that moves but he will take no for an answer and is more than happy to be "just friends". Of course with his gregarious nature, and warped idea of a good time, many women find themselves missing being treated as a sex object.
-   Betelgeuse, in **Cobweb and Stripes**, is graduating from a Dirty Old Man into this as the story progresses. (Slowly.)
-   Milo from **Tripping Over You** has a good time teasing and flirting with Liam, before and after they get together, and never misses a chance for an innuendo. But when Liam asks him to cut down on the PDA, Milo concedes, and he doesn't even bring up the subject of sex because he doesn't want to push Liam to it and instead waits until Liam himself articulates an interest.

Chivalrous Pervert Example in Web Original

-   **Emily H The Viking Princess**: Garth the Thief, though how chivalrous he is is up for discussion. He is allowed to go unscathed on the dangerous treasure island for being a "good sole" and eventually joins the heroes, but he commits some morally questionable actions which include molesting an unconscious Emily in his very first scene.
-   Ayla Goodkind, codename Phase, of the **Whateley Universe**. He looks so much like a girl (because of his mutation) that he can shower in the girls' bathroom... and look at everyone else in there. On the other hand, he's really considerate of his girlfriend and his female friends, even if he's only about fifteen. And the girls in the bathroom haven't asked him to leave (yet).

Chivalrous Pervert Example in Web Videos

-   In **The With Voices Project**, the Mogekos of The Gray Garden act this way towards the heroines. The Mogekos of Mogeko Castle, are just thoroughly evil, unchivalrous perverts.
-   Linkara. Apparently, being feminist gives him an "appreciation for the female body".
    -   Shown even further in **Linking with Linkara**.
        
        **MarzGurl:** I think, what it comes down to is, it has to be just you and me. Lesbianism.  
        **Linkara:** Can I watch?  
        **The Nostalgia Chick:** No, you're a feminist, and that's exploitation.  
        **Linkara:** **\[breaks down crying\]** I KNOW!
        
    -   In his joint review of **Alone in the Dark (2005)** with Spoony and The Nostalgia Critic, when raving at the absurdity of the love interest visiting the protagonist of the film just to sleep with him, and start doing so without asking or even **talking**, he then admits that he wishes some women **would** do that.
    -   That said, he has repeatedly shown his disgust towards certain people in the comic book industry that focus so much on female sex appeal, they might as just start making porn.
-   More subtly, The Nostalgia Critic. He will fall in love with any Action Girl, he's a subby masochist, he has a Berserk Button of women not having the power they should, and he takes a lot of offense to the Faux Action Girl trope due to the way it treats women, but he'll make it clear if he's having the hots for someone in whatever he's reviewing. (Female **and** male.)
-   Mister X of Geek Juice Media will often make sex jokes but loves strong women, a trait he got from being raised by women.

Chivalrous Pervert Example in Western Animation

-   **Avatar: The Last Airbender**: Sokka comes off as a Casanova Wannabe sometimes, but his devotion to his actual Love Interests, Yue and Suki, is obvious.
-   **Batman: The Brave and the Bold**: **Plastic Man**. He hits on **every** attractive superheroine he meets. He seems to be doing it for fun more than anything, as can be seen in "Night of the Batmen!" where, after Catwoman expresses her interest in him, he replies "Tempting. But I'm really more of a dog person". Eel's married and has a child, but that doesn't affect his... admiration.
-   **Family Guy**:
    -   Very, very much downplayed to the point of being averted with Glenn Quagmire, who is a Serial Rapist with only one exception: Meg. Despite his lust for — and later, near-sexual relationship with — Meg, he has shown on many occasions that he cares for Meg, comforting her and giving her advice in her time of need. Again, this only applies to Meg; to almost everyone else he's somewhere between Lovable Sex Maniac (at the best of times) and Blatant Perv (all the other times).
        -   Another episode has Quagmire suprisingly condemning the idea of cheating on one's wife, saying that marriage is a sacred bond between two people, which is why he will never marry (though this didn't keep him from sleeping with his friend's wife).
    -   Herbert the pedophile MAY be this, also only for the one person whom he doesn't want to merely have his way with. Although he frequently preoccupies himself with ensnaring little boys, he harbors an unrequited crush on Chris Griffin that appears to go beyond mere lust, evidenced in his song "Somewhere That's Green" (parodying musical score for the off-Broadway & Broadway stage musical and later, film adaptation of Little Shop of Horrors) where he's dressed as a woman, marrying Chris, and settling down a quiet family life. In another episode, he rescues Chris from an evil possessed tree and fights it in another parody of the battle between Gandalf and the Balrog in **The Lord of the Rings**. He also faces off against an old enemy from his days as a soldier in World War 2 to save Chris.
-   **Generator Rex**: Rex has shades of this. He's a Chick Magnet well aware of his charm and in no way modest about it.
-   **Harley Quinn (2019)**: Kite Man is a rare example of a villain exhibiting this. He has a blatant interest in Poison Ivy, making the wrong assumption she wants to have sex with him in her apartment and making cheesy pick up lines. However, he admits he's rather nervous and once loosens up, it's clear her cares more about having a healthy relationship with her than sex.
-   **Justice League** and **Unlimited**: The Flash hits on Wonder Woman and Hawkgirl **constantly**, is thrilled at the prospect of visiting Themyscira, and is not above using his cred as a superhero to chat up the ladies. He's also, well, **The Flash**, a genuine hero and as gentlemanly as Superman, when it comes down to it.
    -   Though, remember, "Because I'm a Stud!"
    -   This is played for laughs in one episode, where two girls are seriously turned off when he flirts with them; then a car crashes through the diner they're in, and he has to move them to safety before they're crushed, then rush after the driver. Then one of them gets angry at the other for telling her to ignore him!
    -   When he developed a crush on Fire, he becomes shy and nervous around her.
-   **Looney Tunes**:
    -   Speedy Gonzales is depicted in many of his shorts as actually quite the romantic, in one case serenading a female mouse while rowing a gondola and then later with a guitar on a balcony. And Speedy's advances are usually quite welcome. After all, not only is he a gentleman with the ladies, he **is** the fastest mouse in all of Mexico!
        
        **Mouse:** But amigos, why-for would Speedy Gonzales come all the way here from Guadalajara?  
        **Mouse:** Señores! Speedy Gonzales would come all the way from Guadalajara to visit my sister Carmella.  
        **Mouse:** Speedy Gonzales would come all the way from Guadalajara to visit **anybody's** sister Carmella.
        
    -   Pepé Le Pew, who in most cases is more or less a Stalker with a Crush who imagines himself to be a great and worthy lover, shows a genuine willingness to save the (not) skunk he falls for from harm if the situation calls for it, such as when he's chasing Penelope Pussycat underwater and just after catching up to her, he spots a shark and hides Penelope in an oyster before tackling the shark.
-   **Miraculous Ladybug**: Adrien Agreste is reserved and shy in his civilian identity, but as Chat Noir, he can never resist expressing his admiration for his beautiful crime-fighting partner through endless puns and cheesy one-liners. However, underneath his Casanova Wannabe attitude, his feelings for Ladybug are serious, so serious in fact that it's hard for him to seriously consider anyone else.
-   **She-Ra: Princess of Power**: Magical Girl Warrior Castaspella is a female version. Adora catches her ogling her twin brother openly at least twice.
-   **Teen Titans**: Beast Boy. In the **Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo** movie, he gets his own legion of Japanese fangirls, and enjoys it very much. Initially. After several minutes of their attentions, he begins to grow weary of them, and eventually even ends up running away from them, though it's implied to only be a case of him seeing it as too much of a good thing.
-   **Total Drama**: Cody. His Establishing Character Moment makes it clear that he's an Casanova Wannabe, but usually seems cheerfully indifferent when girls reject him. His main target is Gwen, but he actually helps set her up with Trent once he realizes that they're the season's Official Couple. He winds up being her Romantic Runner-Up again in season three when she gets with Duncan; he's mad at **him** for "stealing" her, but never blames Gwen at all, remaining her only real ally after everyone else turns against her.
