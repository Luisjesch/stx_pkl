Cop Killer: 
**Street:** Another officer is dead because you shot your mouth off.  
**Montel:** That's how I like cops — dead ... He knew the dangers, no? That's why he signed up to be a police officer. Carry a gun in the Wild West — like you, Cowboy. Would you be sitting here if this job wasn't dangerous? Huh? Anyway... killing him probably got you 20 new recruits. You should thank me.

"Officer Down!" The two words that haunt every police officer's nightmares.

A staple of the Criminal Procedural when the writers want to create a "This Time, It's Personal" episode. Pretty much Exactly What It Says on the Tin: a criminal kills a cop and the dead officer's colleagues have to avenge him via a Cop Killer Manhunt. These episodes frequently end with Police Brutality, as cop killing is _very_ serious business. When the cops find the cop killer, they don't treat him very well. Not to mention that they're more likely to have "accidents" or be "driven to suicide" at some point between arrest, trial, and imprisonment. Or even just make no effort to capture the cop killer alive in the first place and declare that he was "shot while resisting arrest" regardless of whether it's actually true. Conversely, a cop killer will likely be regarded as particularly notorious by fellow criminals (which may very well be why the cop killer does it in the first place).

If the criminal is purposely going after cops who previously arrested him, this can overlap with Rage Against the Legal System. Other times, cops may be killed in the line of duty by trigger-happy criminals. Of course, they're in particular danger if they're three days away from retirement. May also be done by a Cop Hater.

While this is often a villain trope, there are cases that this trope may be applied to an Anti-Hero or a vigilante outside of Cowboy Cop types (particularly if the character suffered some form of Police Brutality that would result in the Anti-Hero or vigilante hunting down cops as well). If The Bad Guys Are Cops this may be one way for them to meet their fate. Still, it's very rarely condoned, even if opinions about the sanctity of cops are declining. If the anti-hero in question is a Cowboy Cop or a Serial-Killer Killer, then Duel to the Death ensues during their encounter with a Cop Killer.

The inverse of Killer Cop, a cop who is a murderer, although in some cases they do overlap. Particularly with cases of a Dirty Cop killing an honest one who's discovered his crimes, or the local Vigilante Man making an Asshole Victim of a Killer Cop. See also Police Brutality and Pay Evil unto Evil, possible reactions by the police when they find the cop killer.

Cop Killer Example in 

## Examples:



---
Cop Killer Example in Anime & Manga

-   Throughout the **Bloody Monday** manga, several police officers are killed via virus infection or from shootouts by the bad guys.
-   **Case Closed**: One culprit specifically targets traffic cops because of his grudge for slowing him down when he was rushing to prevent his girlfriend from committing suicide. When he's caught after a series of murders, he's confronted about the fact that his girlfriend already committed the act before the traffic cops stopped him, making his killing spree absolutely pointless.
-   This was a subplot in **Darker than Black** when Huang's old public security partner Isozaki was killed by Shihoko Kishida under orders from Syndicate leaders in order to prevent an operation from being compromised. While Huang wanted to get his hands on Shihoko for killing his partner, he couldn't kill her because he fell in love with her.
-   Happens in **Death Note** when Light begins to target law enforcement officers trying to solve the deaths perpetrated by the Death Note. If Light didn't cross the Moral Event Horizon earlier by killing Lind L. Tailor because of an insult to his Pride, he definitely crossed it here, Jumping Off the Slippery Slope and establishing himself as the Villain Protagonist of the series.
-   The Anti-Villain Scar in **Fullmetal Alchemist** very rapidly built up a reputation for murdering State Alchemists. Scar is a greatly sympathetic example (to the point of being given a Face turn), as the State Alchemists are an elite formation within Amestris's army, and were crucial in annexing Scar's home country of Ishval (and massacring a large portion of the population). Scar's reputation is so fearsome that State Alchemists tend to transfer en masse out of areas where he's known to be operating.
-   In **Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex**, a plainclothes officer working the Laughing Man case was killed in what appears to be a car accident. Until Section 9 learns that the accident was engineered by the bad guys in the first season in order to prevent another investigation of the case.
-   In **Hi-Speed Jecy**, Cross has no qualms about attacking a patrol ship with lethal force and sending it into a field of the WMD phantom space.
-   In **Jiraishin**, it happens a lot with police officers being killed by determined criminals and assassins. The following are examples of police officers being targeted directly as the main plot in various story arcs.
    -   Kyoya Iida's first partner, Tsuyoshi Yamaki, is shot to death by an illegal immigrant from China as he tried to stop an assassination attempt at a local bar.
    -   Lin Fei, the wife on Taiwanese criminal Fan Tiamin, recruits a Taiwanese hitman to assassinate police officers throughout the Greater Tokyo Area until the Tokyo Metropolitan Police agrees to send the corpse of her sister back to Taipei instead of having it buried in Tokyo since it's against their Taoist beliefs.
    -   Narita was gunned down by a hired assassin named Kei Amami near the end of the manga after she received a heart transplant from his deceased daughter. This began to conflict with her mental health that Kei decided to kill those who were close to her to end the "mental torment".
-   The assassin squad "Orchestra" in **Jormungand** are notorious for killing police officers in their line of work.
-   **One Piece**: A non-lethal (yet also with the lethal option) example is introduced very late during the series, after the climax of the Wano Kuni arc, where it is revealed that Marine soldiers are now given bounties on their heads and are free to be hunted by pirates. The bounties on the Marines are issued by the pirate alliance Cross Guild. One of its main members, Dracule Mihawk, was formerly known as "Marine Hunter" before he became one of the Shichibukai (Seven Warlords of the Sea).

Cop Killer Example in Comic Books

-   Lono from **100 Bullets** kills several police officers when resisting arrest. When he is sent to prison the corrupt prison guards make it clear to the cliques that run contraband that Lono is to be left alone as they intend to break him for it, as they don't want other inmates to think fighting the order is cool.
-   **All-Star Comics**: Boss Williams has ordered hits on multiple cops, and is willing to kill them himself if the opportunity arises. He likes to collect their badges and other paraphernalia which he keeps framed in his "personal museum". Unfortunately for him, he runs afoul of Detective Corrigan, who is not only already dead but also the incredibly powerful and sadistic Anti-Hero The Spectre.
-   Paul Saetta kills several police officers in **Back to Brooklyn**.
-   Batman has dealt with a few:
    -   Wrath is an Evil Counterpart of Batman who specialises in murdering law enforcement officials.
    -   The Hangman from **Batman: Dark Victory** mostly targeted cops, though Sofia Falcone also made an attempt on Batman and killed her brother, Alberto, with her ultimate target being Two-Face for killing her father.
    -   Among the victims of the Joker are police officers including a SWAT team in **Knightfall** (albeit in this case, he's working with the Scarecrow) and Commissioner Gordon's second wife, Sarah Essen, at the end of **Batman: No Man's Land**. Additionally, the alternate reality version of Barbara Gordon who was still Batgirl seen in **Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!** was from a reality where the Joker opted to kill Commissioner Gordon instead of crippling her.
    -   **Robin (1993)**: Johnny Warlock uses his life draining powers to kill his way through a whole slew of cops in his initial rampage, and is only stopped by Tim beating him to apparent death which Tim was only able to do because Johnny overdid it and Tim had a motorcycle to drive into him to start with. While the GCPD is usually ravenous for the opportunity to go after one of their local masked crimefighters if there's even the slightest chance they may have messed up and killed someone Robin is left alone for taking down a cop killer.
    -   In **Batgirl (2011)** storyline "The Darkest Reflection", the villain Mirror, whose obsession is killing people who he thinks didn't deserve to have escaped from certain death, kills several cops in one go. Batgirl bluntly warns him Gotham City cops **will** hunt him down and will not stop until he's behind bars.
        
        **Batgirl:** I don't know who you are, big man. But you've shot a Gotham cop. It's over for you.
        
-   Many show up in **Diabolik**, with the cops usually being officers killed in the line of duty. The title character has the largest body count, as his usual reaction to being caught in action by a cop is to throw a knife at them.
-   **Empowered**:
    -   This is the main reason why the titular protagonist just gets tied up a lot. The oft-referred-to "unwritten rules" against killing or raping a superhero means that the majority of mooks, henchmen and lower-tier villains do **not** want to get branded as a "cape killer" because it **will** drive the rest of the hero community to come after them with extreme prejudice. This is why the disastrous attempt to capture Willy Pete at the end of Volume 5 is such a huge deal, and causes the caped community to stamp down very hard lest criminals and villains think the unwritten rules can be broken with impunity.
    -   This is why Deathmonger is so feared by every cape: the villain goes after heroes **on purpose**, and gets little respect by other villains because the actual target is **everyone with superpowers** that happens to be killable. Those who know **why**, namely that she can control Bargainers, that is superpowered individuals who got their powers through a Deal with the Devil or similar whose superpowers keep them more or less alive even after death, are even more scared.
-   **Frank Miller's RoboCop**, based on Miller's original script for **RoboCop 2**, sees the Rehabs attack the remaining Metro West cops and kill some of them when they try to stop the Rehabs. Additionally, their plan to discredit Murphy is kicked off by the assassination of Sgt. Reed.
-   **Judge Dredd**: The Judges of the Mega Cities, considering they have Judge, Jury, and Executioner built into their job, already have the authority to pass out sentences as they wish. However, (attempted) murder of a Judge is considered among the most serious offenses and always carries an instant death penalty.
-   **Nemesis (Mark Millar)**: The titular villain's main recreational activity. His main target isn't politicians or landmarks, but well-known police commissioners.
-   Oxymoron murders swathes of cops during his rampage in Swanstown.
-   Shazam!'s Arch-Enemy Dr. Sivana was a vehement Cop Hater during The Golden Age of Comic Books, on one occasion resolving to gun down every policeman he came across the moment he realized Shazam was out of town (before getting caught in the act by Lady Shazam).
-   **Sin City**: Dwight and the girls of Old Town kill his ex's abusive ex-boyfriend, realizing too late that he's actually a hero cop. If the body is found, the fragile truce between the corrupt cops and the Band of Brothels will be broken, and the cops and the mob will be free to take over Old Town and brutalize anyone they please, so they need to disfigure and get rid of it.
-   **Superman**:
    -   In **Who is Superwoman?**, Lucy Lane murders Agent Liberty and then kills several more cops to cover up her crime. Inspector Henderson, who was attempting to capture her, only survives thanks to Supergirl's timely arrival.
    -   In **Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl**, Joe Chill shoots Commissioner Gordon and his wife instead of the Wayne family. Before he can run away, though, Barbara Gordon grabs her father's gun and makes him stand still until the cops arrive. This tragedy leads to Barbara becoming a vigilante.
    -   In **Superboy (1994)**, Knockout offhandedly kills a cop during a fight. As Superboy is misled into thinking she's innocent, the cops put together an impressive force to track down their two superpowered suspects.
-   **Tex Willer** has more than a few. A story also shows what happens to those who kill a Texas Ranger, even one who just got the badge: **the corps goes after them**, with one or two (Tex and Carson in that story) physically chasing them to the other side of the US and the rest using all the corps' resources to point them in the right direction.
-   **Wanted**: The members of the Fraternity are above the law. At one point Wesley Gibson goes on a shooting spree in a police station like some unstoppable Terminator-supervillain because he was bored.
-   In **Wildcard**, Puck's third victim is a police officer.

Cop Killer Example in Fan Works

-   **Soliloquy** is a fanfic that rewrites the last two episodes of **The Defenders (2017)** to make the Hand a lot more sinister. With the Hand's leadership in disarray due to Stick killing Sowande and Elektra having just abruptly killed Alexandra and asserted herself as in charge of the Hand, the remaining three "fingers" — Madame Gao, Bakuto, and Murakami — decide once Elektra is out of sight that they need to stop Matt Murdock, Jessica Jones (2015) and Luke Cage (2016) from coming to rescue Danny Rand and interfering with their harvest of the immortality substance, and the best way to do so is by attacking their loved ones. Subsequently, Bakuto, Murakami, and their henchmen attack the 29th Precinct, which is where Colleen Wing, Claire Temple, Foggy Nelson, Karen Page, Malcolm Ducasse, and Trish Walker are being held, at the time that Matt, Jessica, and Luke are there being questioned. Bakuto and his men storm the precinct, killing numerous cops with their guns and katanas. Bakuto kills Misty Knight's captain, then overpowers Misty and tries to kill the heroes' loved ones, but Colleen and Claire engage him, until he manages to stab Claire in the shoulder with a poisoned dagger. Luke and Jessica then attack Bakuto and his men, and hold them off while Matt and Misty get everyone else out of the precinct. They don't get too far, as they are ambushed by Murakami and his ninjas on the street right outside the precinct. A second fight breaks out, with Matt and Karen fighting Murakami, Colleen and Misty fighting Bakuto, and Luke, Jessica, and Trish fighting Murakami's ninjas. By the end of the fight, Murakami has managed to stab Karen in the leg with one of his tonfas, while Bakuto cuts off Misty's right arm (like in the actual show), although Matt intervenes and stops Colleen before she can decapitate him.

Cop Killer Example in Films — Live-Action

-   The ruthless and amoral hitman Lee Woods from **2 Days in the Valley** casually kills a pair of police detectives investigating the scene of one of his murders, and in the final shootout that follows shortly afterward, he tortures another officer by repeatedly shooting him in the legs just to try to draw the man he's fighting out into the open.

One hooker who Ganz roughed up even tells the cops that he seems to like killing cops more than getting laid.
-   **21 Bridges**: The plot takes off when two robbers shoot and kill several officers who were answering a call about a robbery in progress. However, it soon becomes evident that there was no call to the police, but rather that those cops were secretly on their way to take over the same narcotics that the robbers wanted to steal. The detective investigating the murders himself later shoots three dirty cops defending himself from them. He'd also earlier lost his own cop dad to criminals.
-   **Ambulance**: Keeping the cop in the back of their hijacked ambulance is a high priority for the criminals, because as long as he's alive, the cops in the chase will go easy on the chase. Whereas if he dies...
-   **American Ultra**: The TOUGHGUY assassins Crane and Laugher murder five cops so as to get Mike, who's then in police custody inside their station. Upon surveying the carnage after, Lasseter lampshades how stupid this is since it draws them extreme attention as it's probably the least subtle means possible for this.

-   In **Drive Angry**, Piper kills two policemen who were unknowingly enlisted by the Accountant, posing as an FBI Agent.

-   **The Elite Squad**: When a bunch of crooks mortally wound an off-duty member of the BOPE (the Brazilian equivalent of a SWAT Team and quite the Badass Army), they have a massive Oh, Crap! moment and rush him to the hospital (where he dies anyway).

-   **Face/Off**:
    -   Castor kills an undercover FBI agent he caught early on, then kills several more over the course of the film.

Then, as Carl is dragging the trooper's body off the road, two motorists come along in a passing car, prompting Gaear to chase them down and shoot them dead as well.

(2003)**: Alex Montel never actually pulls the trigger on a cop, but two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies, an LAPD helicopter crew, and one SWAT officer die as a result of his actions and the team considers him no better than the people who **did** pull the triggers. And neither does he, apparently:
    
    **Montel:** American greed. It's so reliable.  
    **Street:** **SHUT UP!** Another officer's dead 'cause you shot your mouth off.  
    **Montel:** That's how I like cops: Dead.
    
-   **Terminator**:
    -   The T-800 in **The Terminator** massacres a police station in an attempt to get to Sarah Connor. Radio reports later reveal that quite predictably a nationwide manhunt was started for the mysterious gunman. The LAPD are still looking for the shooter more than ten years later in **Terminator 2: Judgment Day** to get justice for the officers who were killed on that night.
    -   The T-1000 of **Terminator 2: Judgment Day** is introduced killing a cop who stumbles upon its arrival in 1995, then proceeds to add the cop's uniform to its appearance and steals his patrol car.

    -   In **Terminator Genisys**:

Cop Killer Example in Literature

-   **Cop Hater** is the title of the first **87th Precinct** novel. Here, a murderer kills three policemen; as it turns out at the end, the third was the true target, and he only killed the first two to mislead the police into thinking that he's a Serial Killer who targets cops.
-   In **Beka Cooper**, a group of drunk thugs kill Rollo and Verene in a bar fight. They're later captured, and Ahuda makes sure to defy the 'Imprisoned Cop Killer Suffers Unfortunate Accident' part by telling the Dogs under her to **not** kill them, as the law would make them pay for what they did.
    -   Two thugs **attempt** become this by killing Beka in **Bloodhound** (they end up not finishing the job because Achoo the dog kept barking). As before, it doesn't work out well for them: Rosto the Rogue is rather annoyed by them trying to kill one of his friends outside his court and has them beaten to death.
-   "Earthquake", by Damon Runyon: The title character kills a cop in the course of a bar fight, then flees New York for New Orleans, then Managua, Nicaragua.
-   **Discworld** has Carcer from **Night Watch**. He's killed several cops over the course of his career, including at least one who bumped into him by chance while off-duty and didn't even recognize him.
-   **Girls Don't Hit**: One of Joss' early hits was an NYPD detective who'd been investigating a gambling ring. She managed to seduce and kill him, then made this look like she'd been struck by the hitman before he'd been murdered. The cops bought this, though the criminal who ordered the hit is later arrested for ordering his death.
-   **In Death** series: This has happened a few times, and when it does, you can bet that this a considered a Moral Event Horizon for the cops at least and maybe the reader. This happened in books like **Ceremony In Death**, **Survivor In Death**, **Judgment In Death**, **Treachery In Death**, **New York To Dallas**, and **Apprentice In Death**.
-   A variation in **Prizzi's Honor**. While the police are normally in the pocket of the mafia, after a policeman's wife is killed during a hit, they call off their special arrangement until the killer is turned in or killed.
-   **Rose Madder**: Two of Killer Cop Norman's victims during the book are cops.
-   **The Running Man**: Richards kills three Boston police officers in a gas explosion during his underground escape from the hotel. He already had a target on his head, but now every cop in the city wants his blood.
-   In the **Savannah Reid** mysteries, the bad guy in **Cooked Goose** is a cop killer **and** a Killer Cop.
-   Subverted in **Serpico**. Serpico arrests an illegal gambler and hauls him into the police station for processing, only to find he's on friendly terms with all the officers there. Serpico is even less impressed when he looks up the man's record and finds that he served time for the murder of a police officer. The other officers can only say, "Well how were we supposed to know?"
-   In the **Shadowrun** novel **Lone Wolf**, deep-cover gang investigator Wolf Larson is listed as a Cop Killer as part of his cover identity, to enhance his credibility with the Cutters street gang he's infiltrated. This backfires when he loses contact with his handler and needs to get word to authorities quickly, as he's afraid any other cop he contacts may retaliate against him as soon as they look up his "criminal history".
-   **Star Wars Legends**: Part of Corran Horn's backstory in the **X-Wing Series** is that his father Hal Horn, a Corellian Security Force officer like his son, was gunned down by the Trandoshan Bounty Hunter Bossk (who was after a confidential informant of Horn's, a smuggler whom he was meeting at the time). In **I, Jedi** he explains to Luke Skywalker that after he caught Bossk, he could've frog-marched him into the lobby of One CorSec Plaza and shot him "resisting arrest", and nobody in the building would've batted an eyelash.
-   **They Talked To A Stranger**, an "only the names have been changed to protect the innocent" set of case studies of juvenile delinquents of the 1950s. The first case discussed is of "Moustache", who killed an officer while escaping custody. The police were sympathetic to his situation (Moustache was a non-violent offender whose crime was the result of a string of poor decisions bad luck on both his and the officer's part) but that didn't stop them from pulling out all the stops to capture him. He was scheduled to be released sometime in the 1980s, with good behavior.
-   Acidbath from **Worm** was a cop and capekiller with the ability to shoot and turn into acid before getting thrown in the Birdcage.

---
Cop Killer Example in Live-Action TV

-   Happens throughout the **24** TV series when local police officers alongside CTU officers are killed by armed terrorists or criminals, serving as Red Shirts.
-   **Adam-12**: "Elegy For a Pig". The actual crime (a beat partner and close friend of series protagonist Pete Malloy being killed in a gunfight with burglary suspects) is not seen, but the aftermath of the police officer's death is the one that takes center stage. To wit: When a "cop" gets killed, you've also taken someone who has a family, who is a key part of the community, and who is a friend and valued co-worker who follows the sworn duty to keep people safe and stop the bad guys.
-   In the pilot of **Almost Human**, InSyndicate attacks the precinct and assassinates LAPD Detective Vogel and another officer using a biological weapon.
-   **Andor**: Andor's situation on Ferrix was already going downhill, but things only get really bad after he kills two corrupt Pre-Mor cops trying to shake him down. The first was an accident, but the second was to cover his tracks, knowing Pre-Mor would come down hard on cop-killers. And they do, if only because Deputy Inspector Syril Karn wanted to throw his weight around (against the wishes of the Chief Inspector, who'd already deduced the ignominious death of two corrupt cops wasn't an issue worth pursuing).
-   **Babylon 5**:
    -   "The Quality of Mercy" involves a serial killer who has murdered a number of people on the station, including a security officer, for which Garibaldi wants him Thrown Out the Airlock.
    -   An odd variation in "Chrysalis" where we get the typical police reaction without the actual death. Garibaldi is shot In the Back by one of his own men after uncovering a plot to assassinate President Santiago. He doesn't actually die but he's comatose until "Revelations" in season 2. The security man who shot him (who is still above suspicion at the moment) then guns down his co-conspirators in cold blood and claims to the other guards that they took a shot at him. The other guards go along with this, despite the deceased's PPG clearly not having been fired, because it's a fellow cop (their beloved boss) who got shot. When the perpetrator is identified, the other guards rough him up a bit before taking him into custody (and it's only "a bit" because Sheridan interrupts them).
    -   "Learning Curve" has Trace, a criminal overlord who brags about how he had heads of security on his last turf killed until he found one he could work with and he's trying to do the same on Babylon 5. A young Ranger gets involved, and since Trace sees them as some kind of law enforcement, he decides to use what he's got. The Ranger survives, barely, but Trace now has the Rangers' personal attention.
-   **The Beauty Queen Of Jerusalem**: Ephraim's first murder is of a British soldier, who he suffocates and then steals his gun. He becomes a thorn in the side of the British occupying authorities, who hunt him as a terrorist. Later on he plants a bomb at a party attended by British officers, killing several soldiers and civilians.
-   A complicated case was seen in **Better Call Saul**. Mike Ehrmantraut is a retired cop from Philadelphia whose son Matty also became a cop. Matty was completely idealistic, and when he found out that his partner and sergeant were dirty, was ready to turn them in to Internal Affairs. Mike frantically convinced Matty not to do this, because he knows cops will do **anything** to avoid prison, which could include killing Matty. Matty eventually backed down, but by that point, the two Corrupt Cops killed Matty anyway, convinced that he was snitching on them, and made it look as though Matty was killed by a criminal they were pursuing. Mike eventually lured the two into a trap and killed them both. Because of the complications at work, there's also a schism in the response of other police: younger cops who don't know how notoriously corrupt those two cops were want to bust Mike and are willing to follow him all the way to New Mexico to do so, older cops who know everything that was going on want to just let sleeping dogs lie and figure the two cops got what they deserved.
-   In **The Blacklist**, the FBI gets into this part when they face off against heavily armed criminals and terrorists, resulting in their deaths.
-   **Blue Bloods**:
    -   Joe Reagan, brother to Danny, Erin, and Jamie, was a patrolman who was killed in the line of duty before the series began. Jamie's unofficial investigation into his death forms season 1's Myth Arc and leads to the unmasking of the Blue Templar, a fraternity of dirty cops in the NYPD.
    -   In "Officer Down", a patrol officer is mortally wounded when she blunders into the path of mafia-affiliated diamond thieves while coming back from lunch. The Mafia itself joins in hunting them down, because cop killers put the whole department on edge and make life difficult. Grandpa Henry Reagan remarks that when he was on the force the mafia even had explicit rules that, outside of certain circumstances, cops were off-limits. The killer gets cornered, tries to shoot his way out, and is hosed down with lead by several detectives and an ESU team. While searching for the killer, Danny finds and arrests an accomplice (whose father is a retired NYPD officer), who he takes to a spot on the water, then explains 50 years earlier the man's father took a cop killer to that exact spot, shot him twice in the head and dumped the body in the river. It was ruled an accidental death. Danny then explains the man's father would likely disown him if he killed a cop and was executed in such a fashion. This breaks the man into giving the real killer.
    -   In "The Bitter End", Jamie Reagan and his partner Vinny Cruz are lured into the Bitterman Housing Projects by a Latino gang with a beef against the NYPD. It's an ambush, and Vinny is fatally shot. By the end of the next episode, the NYPD, with Mayor Carter Poole's blessing, conducts a massive sweep of the Bitterman Projects, rounding up over 47 members of the Los Lordes organization for various charges including conspiracy to murder Vinny, an assassination attempt on the Mayor (which leaves the Mayor paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair), narcotics possession with intent to distribute, enterprise corruption, racketeering and a number of other criminal offenses.
    -   Used a little oddly in "Above and Beyond". Steve Tomlin, a detective from Danny's precinct, is killed, and in typical fashion Frank firmly promises the widow to bring the killer to justice. They catch the killer at roughly the twenty-minute mark, however, and then the plot turns into a bit of a lurid look at the double life this detective was leading (due to the discovery that someone had emptied Tomlin's locker after his death without authorization). Turned out the undercover detective's cover was blown when his wife drunk-dialed a number on the detective's contacts list, thinking it belonged to the other woman, when in fact it was a member of the drug cartel her husband was investigating.
    -   The two-part season 5 finale concerned the death of recently-promoted Assistant Chief Donald Kent of the NYPD Gang Division, gunned down along with his wife Maggie in a drive-by shooting by members of the Warrior Kings gang. The hit itself was carried out on orders of an incarcerated gang member. Frank uses a loophole in the law from Kent's work on a federal case to have the Gang Banger charged federally with capital murder, having him transferred to Indiana for trial and execution.
-   **Bosch**:
    -   In the first season, Raynard Waits wounds Crate and kills Deputy District Attorney Lou Escobar during his escape from custody.
    -   In the second season, Deputy Chief Irvin Irving's son George is doing undercover work infiltrating a ring of corrupt cops who work for Carl Nash, an ex-cop who works private security for a gated community and is a person of interest in Bosch's investigation into the murder of a mob-affiliated producer who lived there. When George's wires are found by Nash, Nash promptly sends a masked gunman to execute him as he's doing some late night shopping at a mini mart. Irvin goes on the war path to find his son's murderers, recruiting Bosch for an off-the-books investigation to skirt around city politics. They interrogate George's partner in the crew, Eddie Arceneaux, and he gives up Nash as the one who ordered the hit. When Arceneaux informs Nash about how he's been compromised, Nash has two of the other cops in the crew, Maureen O'Grady and Nate Riley, murder Arceneaux in his house and stage his death to look like a suicide.
    -   Late in the third season, Jerry Edgar fatally shoots Woody Woodrow, one of a group of corrupt private military contractors who are smuggling illegal money to the United States. In retaliation, one of the other members of the group, Xavi Moreno, attempts to kill Edgar by sniping at him in his driveway from a nearby hillside. Edgar takes a bullet in the shoulder, which puts him out of action of three months, and only avoids a fatal shot to the head because he has the sense to use his car's engine block for cover.
    -   Over the fifth season, Jerry Edgar has a subplot where he is investigating the murder of Gary Wise, one of his informants. By the end of the season, he has determined that Wise was set up to be murdered by Ray Marcos and Daniel Arias, a pair of corrupt cops in the pocket of Jamaican warlord-turned-criminal Jacques Avril. By the start of the sixth season, Internal Affairs has opened an investigation into them. Marcos and Arias sniff out the investigation, call a meeting with the gangsters, and tell them that they're going to have to dial back on criminal activities for a while. The Jamaicans decide that the two cops are liabilities and elect to have them assassinated. Things get even more complicated as DEA agent Charlie Hovan's informant in Avril's crew, Winston, is one of the shooters. When Hovan goes undercover as a money launderer to get access to Avril, Winston chooses to burn him rather than admit to being a cop killer.
-   **Bones**
    -   Sweets' death counts. Booth is so angry at the guys who did it between Sweets dying and his near death and Frame-Up that he gets ready to go Cold Sniper and kill them himself. Brennan has to pull him back and convince him to use the system to solve the case instead.
    -   Also a case of the week with "The Doom in the Boom". Four officers die, Aubrey's Tuck and Cover leaves him critical, and Hodgins is paralyzed.
-   **Breaking Bad**:
    -   The Cousins, Leonel and Marco Salamanca. Marco uses his chrome axe to murder a tribal police officer who happens to stumble upon them. They later are directed on Gus Fring's orders to assassinate Hank (since Gus forbids them from killing Walt). However, Hank gets tipped off by Gus about their impending arrival one minute before the attack begins. Hank is shot four times and critically wounded, but manages to fatally shoot Marco in the head and crush Leonel's legs with a car. Leonel survives, forcing Gus to send Mike to the hospital to finish him off. This orchestration of events allows Gus to force the cartel into a sitdown and also turns up the heat on the cartel's operation since DEA agents are normally off-limits for assassinations.
    -   Jack Welker and his Neo-Nazi gang, who are responsible for the deaths of Hank and Steven Gomez.
-   In the first episode of **Brooklyn South** a guy goes on a shooting spree and kills a bunch of cops right outside the precinct house, then is himself shot and dragged into the house. He dies while waiting for paramedics to show up, and his relatives sue the police force alleging that the cops purposely let him bleed to death in revenge.
-   **The Cape**: In the pilot Chess murders Palm City's police chief and frames Vince (a police detective) for it. All this is part of his plan to control the city.
-   **Castle**:
    -   A variation in "Love Me Dead" where the victim is an A.D.A. rather than a cop. It's treated the same way by the cops at the scene, though.
    -   Subverted in "Almost Famous". Castle and Beckett respond to an "officer down" call, but it turns out the victim is a male stripper in a police officer costume.
-   In **CHiPs**, a patrolman is killed in an auto accident by a motorist who was trying pull off an insurance scam. The accident happened when a delivery van got in the way of the driver and his target.
-   In **Copper**, a rookie police officer is stabbed to death and the other cops tear through the Five Points neighborhood looking for the killer. When they have no success, the local ward boss, an ex-copper himself, orders the closing of all the local pubs until the killer is found. In a neighborhood populated by Irish immigrants, this is extremely Serious Business. The killing was actually a gang initiation intended to make sure that the new member would never dare inform on the gang to the police.
-   **Counterpart (2018)**: Baldwin kills two different German cops in her very first scene, and she goes on to kill more without hesitation.
-   **Criminal Minds** has a number of unsubs who've killed cops. The most notable was one in the episode "Brothers in Arms" with an unsub that targets policemen. In another episode, there was a cop-killing unsub who turned out to be a cop himself.
-   In **CSI**, there are a few notable examples.
    -   The Red Shirt who gets killed when Warrick leaves her alone at a crime scene in the pilot.
    -   A random officer who's killed outside a burger joint...by another cop who claims it was an accident but might have had a grudge ( it was dark and said cop was losing his vision).
    -   Warrick Brown was killed at the end of a later season by The Undersheriff.
    -   Arc Villain "Dr. Jekyll" makes his presence known at the end of his arc by blowing away a Red Shirt cop with a shotgun and severely wounding Nick.
    -   A two-episode arc immediately following the "Dr. Jekyll" arc guest-starred Justin Bieber as a part of a sibling team of Right-Wing Militia Fanatic Mad Bombers that bombed the cop's funeral and (once the big brother was killed) driving the younger brother into a vendetta against Nick.
-   **CSI: NY**:
    -   One example is Flack's Love Interest, Angell, who's shot in the season 5 finale while protecting a Donald Trump/Rupert Murdoch expy's son (who was due to testify against him; the killers turn out to be kidnappers, who knew this would put immediate suspicion on their target's father). The episode also ends with the bar they're holding a wake for her in being shot up in a drive-by. Nobody's killed (although Danny ends up in a wheelchair for a while), but it fits the trope in spirit.
    -   Aiden also counts, despite no longer being on the team. They were dead set on finding the perp and Danny was willing to beat up the guy he thought did it. Mac's speech in the beginning has a double meaning. He's talking about the dead Marine, being one himself, but it clearly shows with Aiden too. "You attack one, you attack us all."
    -   Mac himself was a variant in the season 8 finale, having been shot In the Back after stumbling into a drug store robbery. He only **nearly** died, but the NYPD's reaction was largely the same as in a straight example.
-   **Dark Matter (2015)** is a show about amnesiac ex-criminal Anti-Hero protagonists being hunted by, among other factions, the Galactic Authority (read: Space Police). At one point, Five — the teenage and most innocent protagonist (she'd just been a pickpocket) — orders the Android to kill a whole room full of cops who'd been holding the two of them prisoner. Contrary to the normal application of this trope, this is treated as a heroic act by the writers, or at least as not particularly bad or something she should be conflicted over later. Partially justified, in so far that the lead officer, after several failed normal interrogation attempts, was holding a gun to Five's head to make her betray the rest of her (formerly mass-murdering) crew, but the rest of the victims were just random low-ranking cops doing their job.
-   **Downtown Precinct**: Babayof arranges for a car bomb to eliminate the police tailing him, resulting in the death of Ivri, Arik's partner.
-   From the 1960s **Dragnet** series:
    -   Discussed in one episode. While appearing on a talk show Joe Friday explains to a TV audience that the reason cop killers get such a heavy response from the department isn't **just** because it's their friend. To paraphrase, if someone's willing to kill a cop, would they hesitate to kill a civilian?
    -   In another episode Friday gives the same speech to a store owner when he comments that the police always put more effort into catching someone who has killed a cop than someone who has killed a civilian.
    -   In another episode two officers, a rookie and his training officer, are shot apprehending bank robbers, one of whom escapes. The older officer dies shortly after coming out of surgery and, according to the end of the episode, the captured robber was sentenced to death.
-   **Due South** begins with the murder of a Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman in the wilderness of the Northwest Territories. The plot of the pilot episode centers around his son, Benton Fraser (also a Mountie), teaming up with a Chicago detective to track down the killer after he crosses the border into the United States. It turns out the killer was hired by another Mountie, a close friend of the Frasers, no less.
-   The **Elementary** episode "End of Watch" starts with the murder of an NYPD Highway Patrol officer and the discovery that his sidearm has been replaced with an airsoft gun. The officer had been trading police guns for oxycodone, replacing them with airsoft replicas, and when he tried to quit, the arms dealer killed him in order to use his funeral as a diversion while he robbed the ESU armory. After the traitor gets exposed and his funeral cancelled, he then murders another cop (who was completely honest and got picked at random,) to ensure there's another funeral. When the killer gets arrested and dragged out of his hideout, his Smug Snake attitude towards the couple of officers holding him gets a severe knocking as he's greeted by the sight of **dozens** of cops lining the street as he's put in the car, reminding him that he's made a lifelong enemy of every single person in the NYPD.
-   **Eye Candy**: Ben, a police officer, is the first onscreen victim of the killer.
-   **The F.B.I.**: In "Slow March Up a Steep Hill", a bank robber guns down an FBI Agent while making his getaway. Erskine and Jim visit the agent's widow, which is particularly poignant as Jim has just become engaged to Erskine's daughter.
-   **FBI: Most Wanted**: In "Hairtrigger", the FBI investigation starts when Doug Timmons shoots and kills a cop who tries to look in his trunk. Watching the footage of the shooting, Jess notes that the sight of a police uniform seems to put Timmons on edge and theorises that he has a deep-seated hatred of the police.
-   **Gotham Knights (2023)**: In "Night of the Owls", the Talons slaughter at least half a dozen GCPD officers while going to kill the Gotham Knights, who are now in their custody.
-   Happens a lot in **Hawaii Five-0** with HPD officers sometimes being killed off while supporting Five-0, acting as in the capacity of Red Shirts. Others include FBI and ATF officers, which drives the plot of a few other episodes.
-   **Homicide: Life on the Street** did this at least twice, with the same twist both times: the cop killer is himself killed shortly afterward, and the unlucky detective assigned to the case finds that nobody cares about justice for a dead cop killer.
    -   "End Game" has a racist Smug Snake (played by Steve Buscemi) get away with cop killing and practically brag about it — only to be shot dead in the last few minutes. In the follow-up, "Law and Disorder," the detective assigned to solve Buscemi's murder has to admit defeat because no cop will help him.
    -   In the "Justice" two-parter, a cop killer is acquitted in court and murdered shortly thereafter. The dead cop's son (played by Bruce Campbell) is suspect number one, but nobody can figure out the evidence trail until one of the detectives casually mentions that Campbell owns a derringer. Da Chief explains that when he was a junior policeman, the Baltimore police always executed cop killers without trial, and usually did it with a derringer (which was easy to dispose of and couldn't be traced back to the department).
-   **Justified**: Since protagonist Raylan Givens is a US Marshal, most villains end up as attempted cop killers by default. In Season 3, Raylan's father Arlo Givens becomes the genuine article when he shoots and kills Raylan's friend, State Trooper Tom Bergen, believing him to be Raylan. In Season 5, Boyd Crowder becomes one when he has Sheriff Nick Mooney assassinated—though given that Mooney was deeply corrupt, nobody cares—and Daryl Crowe Jr. narrowly avoids it when he shoots, but fails to kill, Raylan's boss, Art.
-   **Law & Order**:
    -   **Law & Order** used this plot at least half a dozen times. In one case it got very personal for Logan, as it was his partner Max Greevey who was killed.
    -   **Law & Order: Criminal Intent**: Occasionally dealt with; in particular, Alex's first husband was a police officer killed in the line of duty.
-   The **Madam Secretary** episode "Standoff" revolves around the extradition to the United States of Carlos Ochoa, a Mexican drug runner who killed a Texas state trooper. The Mexican government insists on the US taking the death penalty off the table before they'll extradite him, angering the trooper's family and Texas Governor Caleb Lockwood.
-   **Major Crimes** has the Reverend Daniel Price, known as "Reverend Cop Killer" to the LAPD. As a member of the Bloods he murdered an off-duty police officer during an armed robbery, but the case was dismissed with prejudice due to one of the investigating officers perjuring himself on the stand. In the present he claims to be a changed man and has become a pastor and community leader, which turns out to be true in season four's five-part episode "Hindsight".
-   **Marvel Cinematic Universe**:
    -   **Daredevil (2015)**: Wilson Fisk has numerous NYPD cops and FBI agents on his payroll who are so corrupt they're willing to murder fellow officers who aren't on the take. Fisk also has no qualms about having the corrupt cops and agents on his payroll killed when they become liabilities.
        -   "Into the Ring": Clyde Farnum, a guard who owes money to Fisk, is threatened by James Wesley into attempting to hang Karen Page in her jail cell. When the attempt fails due to Karen clawing out one of his eyes, Fisk has Farnum bailed out and then killed by a hitman who stages his death to look like a suicide.
        -   "Condemned": Officer Sullivan, a rookie with just six months on the job, stumbles upon Matt Murdock and a wounded Vladimir Ranskahov in an abandoned building. Despite Matt's efforts to talk him into leaving, Sullivan calls in a hostage situation, forcing Matt to knock him out and handcuff him to a pole. This ends up summoning numerous cops to the scene including Christian Blake and Carl Hoffman, a pair of corrupt detectives who Matt just witnessed killing one of Vladimir's men in custody earlier that day for saying Fisk's name. Blake has become a liability to Fisk as in the time since that incident, Matt has attacked Blake, broke his right arm, and stolen his cell phone, which contained the addresses of Vladimir's stashhouses. While Blake is trying to shoo away an increasingly suspicious Ben Urich, an ESU sniper in Fisk's employ suddenly opens fire on the cops, critically wounding Blake with a bullet to the chest and killing two uniformed cops nearby<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>. The ESU team that enters the abandoned building, meanwhile, kills Officer Sullivan by cutting his throat with a knife.
        -   "Shadows in the Glass": Because Detective Blake survived the attempt on his life, Fisk and Wesley know that he'll probably snitch on them. So they threaten Hoffman into killing Blake by injecting a syringe of poison into his IV. Matt shows up and overpowers Hoffman, but is unable to get anything out of Blake before he dies. Hoffman, wracked with guilt over the incident, is scooped up by Leland Owlsley and hidden away as a bargaining chip. When Fisk learns of Hoffman's location, he sends a team of corrupt cops to kill Hoffman, but Matt manages to stop them.
        -   "Daredevil": Multiple FBI agents and NYPD cops are gunned down by the paramilitary team that are hired to free Fisk from the armored van transporting him to jail. It's implied retroactively in season 3 that the mercs responsible for breaking Fisk out were tipped off by Tammy Hattley, his mole within the FBI.
        -   In season 2, we learn that Frank Castle's family was killed in a three-way shootout between three gangs. Frank's family's deaths were all covered up by the medical examiner, but when Karen interviews him, he tells her that he also disappeared one more body: an undercover DEA agent, whose presence at the scene would've made it established that the whole shootout was a police sting gone bad. That is, until it's revealed in **The Punisher (2017)** that the whole shootout was a smokescreen set up by federal operatives seeking to kill Frank for threatening to blow the whistle on war crimes he witnessed in his tour in Afghanistan.
        -   "A Cold Day in Hell's Kitchen": Nobu's lookouts on the roof of the warehouse where they are holding Karen and a bunch of other Daredevil survivors, end up killing the first pair of cops to respond after Karen activates Turk Barrett's tracking bracelet, by shooting them with arrows.
        -   Benjamin "Dex" Poindexter makes his introduction in the second episode of season 3 singlehandedly wiping out an Albanian hit squad that ambushes the FBI convoy transporting Fisk to an FBI safehouse. The unit manages to kill five FBI agents and wound several more before Dex kills them all.
        -   This ends up being how Ray Nadeem learns Fisk's corruption of the FBI isn't limited to Dex. He and OPR Agent Winn visit his SAC, Tammy Hattley, at her house, and Nadeem breaks his suspicions about Dex. Too late for him, Hattley is also working for Fisk and proceeds to kill Winn with Nadeem's gun. Fisk's fixer Felix Manning then enters the room, pockets Nadeem's gun and the tape recording of the interview, and promptly blackmails Nadeem into working for Fisk as well.
        -   In "Reunion", Fisk beats one of his FBI bodyguards to death in the backseat of his limo for informing him that Nadeem has gone rogue and prevented Dex from finishing off Karen Page as revenge for her murder of James Wesley. He then sends his men to Nadeem's house to get rid of Nadeem and his family, but Matt shows up in time to help Nadeem take them down. Notably, this is the only time in season 3 that Fisk personally kills someone as opposed to having someone else do it for him.
        -   In "One Last Shot", Dex kills Ray Nadeem on Vanessa's orders, to keep him from talking after Fisk thwarts Nelson & Murdock's attempt to have Nadeem speak out against him in front of a grand jury. This ends up being Fisk's undoing, as Matt gets Felix Manning (who was in the room when Vanessa gave the order) to spill the beans, allowing him to blackmail Fisk into leaving him, Karen, and Foggy alone (knowing that Fisk's love for Vanessa is his greatest weakness). On top of that, Nadeem is wise enough to record a confession video on his phone, that he sends to his wife prior to his death with instructions for the video to be plastered over the Internet, in which he apologizes to them for letting them down and also gives an outline of the extortion racket Fisk has set up using the FBI agents as his enforcers. And due to Nadeem being dead, the confession video (which would otherwise be easy for Fisk to discredit) is admissible in court per the "dying declaration" exemption rule.

        -   Jessica herself accidentally kills in self-defense Dale Holiday, a corrections officer assigned to guard her mother and who turns out to be a serial killer who loves torturing inmates for his own amusement. Those that defy his authority, he murders them, makes their deaths look like suicides, and collects their numbers as trophies.

He then flees the scene shouting "I'M LUKE CAGE!"

Comanche, who's tried to cover his ass by claiming Sugar is the snitch, abruptly shoots Ridenhour dead and tries to lie to Shades. But Shades doesn't buy it and proceeds to shoot Comanche with Ridenhour's gun, intent on making it look like the two men shot and killed each other. Except, he botches the coverup because he is unable to bear letting Comanche slowly bleed out, and decides to grant him a swifter death by shooting him a second time with Ridenhour's gun.
    -   **The Punisher (2017)**:
        -   The reason Frank Castle's family was killed was that Frank executed Dinah Madani's partner Ahmed Zubair on the orders of William Rawlins.

Rawlins and Schoonover then ordered Frank be assassinated because they were led to believe Frank was the one who sent Micro a videotape of the Zubair assassination, as opposed to Gunner Henderson, the one who actually made the recording.
        -   Once Frank is drawn back in to hunting down the people who ordered the death of his family, his first victim is Carson Wolf, the Special Agent in Charge of the DHS's New York City field office and Dinah Madani's current boss, and who, according to information dug up by Karen Page, was involved in the coverup of David Lieberman's faked "death".

The crime is believed to be the work of a man whose brother Stottlemeyer had killed in a bank robbery, and who'd fired at Stottlemeyer in a parking lot a few months prior to the party. When the suspect turns out to be innocent, Monk finds that Terry in fact had been the intended target all along, and he was killed by his spurned ex-girlfriend, a fellow police officer who was pissed off that Terry had decided to end their relationship and get back together with his wife and kids.
    -   "Mr. Monk and the Badge": A police officer named Russell DiMarco is shot and killed in a stairwell.

Only, said friend double-crossed DiMarco, and thus shot him and kept the reward money for himself. This plotline is a loose adaptation of a similar plotline from the novel **Mr. Monk and the Blue Flu**.
-   In **Nikita** the series, Nikita, as in the movie, kills a cop while high. However, the adaptation changes the circumstances in order to make Nikita's actions more sympathetic and blameless. Instead of killing a cop during an incident her homicidal friends instigated, here the cop was part of a corrupt duo who had been extorting Nikita's caretaker and had just killed her friend. However, that she killed a cop is enough to make all of these mitigating circumstances—as well as the fact that she was barely eighteen—immaterial, and she is ultimately sentenced to death.
-   **Oz**: Augustus Hill, the show's narrator, is in a wheelchair because he shot a cop while trying to escape arrest. After he was arrested and handcuffed, another cop threw the helpless Hill off a building as payback.

The Don Carl Elias is not so scrupulous and has him killed in the hospital because he liked Carter.
        -   The page quote comes from a flashback in "The Devil's Share", where Fusco is unburdening himself to a police shrink that his first on-the-job kill wasn't a good shoot. He had hunted down and murdered a drug dealer who had killed an off-duty rookie and gotten off scot-free.

-   **The Wire** repeatedly hammers home that criminals doing **anything** to incur the ire of the police is a very, very, bad idea, and everyone involved in organized crime is cognizant of this. Only the extremely foolhardy or most aggressive criminals try to do such a thing.

Kima lives, but the police proceed to crack down hard on the Barksdales. Avon, Stringer Bell, and Wee-Bey acknowledge the utter stupidity of Little Man's improvised actions. For acting impulsively without checking with his boss, Little Man is killed by Wee-Bey as part of Avon's orders to clean house, and every other crook who hears about the incident is pissed off because of the massive, city-wide crackdown that has happened as a result.
    -   In season 3, Kenneth Dozerman, a Western District cop in Carver's Drug Enforcement Unit, is trying to buy drugs when the dealers he's talking to simply rob him, shoot him, and steal his gun. Dozerman survives, but once again it triggers a massive police reaction. When McNulty sees the brutality inflicted on the shooter, Bunk explains that the arrest van took an "unscheduled stop" at the Western District parking lot for a tune-up, and the officers "mistook him for a pinata." Major Colvin sees the incident as the impetus for forming his Hamsterdam project. Bunk meanwhile finds himself tasked with the menial duty of recovering Dozerman's missing gun, and is only saved from this when Omar hunts it down for him.
    -   The first part of painting the infamous Stanfield Organization as more dangerous than the Barksdales is the fact that they're perfectly willing to threaten if not outright use violence against anyone who goes up against them. Major Colvin sends Herc and Carver to tell Marlo Stanfield to show up at a parley that Colvin is doing with the drug gangs in the Western District for his "Hamsterdam" project. When Marlo refuses, Herc gets up in his face over this disrespect....and then Carver notices that the various other members of Marlo's gang are all starting to reach for weapons. If not for Carver getting a proper read of Marlo's men and getting Herc to back down, they'd have a pretty bad day, and if they didn't have police badges, they'd be dead. The scene itself is an early hint about just how ruthless and bloodthirsty the group will turn out to be.

        -   Following on from the above spoiler, a drug kingpin refuses to kill McCarty or Gorner, because "unlike you, I'm not a cop killer." But he's not above leaving them both guns so they'll kill each other. Fortunately, Sara and Danny get there in time.
-   **Series/Wiseguy** Season 2's 'White Supremacy Arc' 3rd episode **Revenge of the Mud People** has Vinnie unjustly framed for this by what's found to be a member of the racist 'Pilgrims of Promise' who when arrested as the real culprit, kills himself in his cell.

-   "Cop Killer" by Body Count, Ice-T's Heavy Metal side project. A Protest Song against Police Brutality, the lyrics are about Ice-T's desire to shoot and kill members of the Los Angeles Police Department as revenge for their mistreatment of the city's Black community. The song caused enough controversy, including criticism from President George H. W. Bush, various police associations (who called for a boycott of all Time Warner products until Warner (Bros.) Records pulled the song), and Charlton Heston, that he ultimately made the decision to withdraw it from circulation, including removing the song from later copies of Body Count's Self-Titled Album. (Ironically, Ice-T went on to play a cop himself on shows including **Law & Order: Special Victims Unit**.)
