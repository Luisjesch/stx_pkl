Comedic Underwear Exposure: 
In his defense, most probably aren't expecting the wall to get breached when they're changing, either.

_"I see London! I see France! I see_ \[Insert Name Here\]_'s underpants!"_

— **Traditional children's rhyme accompanying such an event**

A Comedy Trope in which a character's underwear is exposed while other people are present, usually by accident, and much to their embarrassment. Generally involves Goofy Print Underwear or Uncool Undies. For extra embarrassment, the person might have their name written on their underwear. The primary use of this trope is comedy, catching a character in their most embarrassing state. Often this is the result of Defeat by Modesty. Fully-Clothed Nudity is the feeling this creates.

Compare Marilyn Maneuver for a specific situation in which this happens. Compare Panty Shot, which usually shows viewers up a girl's skirt while it's still up, but can overlap with this trope when said skirt is blown or flipped upward. In addition, Panty Shots are always played for Fanservice, while Comedic Underwear Exposure usually isn't. Compare Naked People Are Funny.

Comedic Underwear Exposure Example in Web Series

-   In the **Troom Troom** video "26 Awkward Situations at College", one of the awkward situations profiled involves a young man in a P.E. class, which is very invigorating for him until the elastic on his nylon pants gives out, causing them to fall down and reveal his blue briefs to the rest of the class. Despite his efforts to keep his pants up, he is unable to do jumping jacks with the rest of the class without his pants continuing to fall down.
-   In the "123GoTrends" video "We Tested Tik Tok DIY Clothes Hacks", Adam is embarrassed on a first date when his pants sag and his date inadvertently gets a peak of his bright red boxer briefs with white stars on them. He is then able to repurpose a pair of suspenders and clip one end to his socks and the other end to his tucked-in shirt under his pants, thus his shirt stays tucked in even if his pants start to sag.

Comedic Underwear Exposure Example in Real Life

-   In January 2023, during a concert in Inglewood, CA, Harry Styles slid across the stage while performing his song "Music for a Sushi Restaurant", which caused him to accidentally split his leather pants. Because a large part of his bare leg was visible, there was much online debate over whether he was wearing underwear at all, but one prominent video of the incident showed that he was definitely wearing what appeared to be black briefs, as too much of his leg was bare for them to have been boxer briefs.
-   The issue of pants falling down unexpectedly in public is a frequent issue in karate and other forms of martial arts, given the baggy pants often required to be worn as uniforms, along with the relatively flimsy drawstrings on the pants that can snap or break easily, especially given the amount of leg and waist movement required in martial arts:
    -   In 2011, a video went viral of a Wushu performance given by a University of Viginia student named Keenan Stone at UCLA in California. In the middle of his routine, the elastic waistband of Stone's uniform pants snapped, causing his pants to fall to his ankles and leaving him in his black boxer briefs in front of the hundreds of people in the stadium. Despite his embarrassment, Stone kicked off his pants and successfully finished the routine in his underwear.
    -   A similar (albeit less publicized) incident happened at a Kyokushin Karate Tournament in Laval, Quebec in 2008. As two young men were fighting in the tournament, one of them unexpectedly had his pants fall down, leaving him in his black boxer briefs and jockstrap in front of the roomful of spectators. Despite having his pants around his ankles, the young man was able to sweep his opponent. The video of this incident was later uploaded to You Tube.
