Bully Bulldog: 
**Stewie Griffin:** Ooh, I wonder if I'll have one of those pug-nosed British dogs that licks its own snot all day. _\[sees a bulldog doing just that\]_ Ew, that's gross.  
**Bulldog**: Piss off, you little wanker! I'm not gonna be the dog to some poof baby!

This trope is prevalent in (but not exclusive to) old cartoons from the 1940s as both Warner Bros. and MGM had a surfeit of bulldog characters. Generally they were vicious guard dogs or bullies, especially toward cats and smaller dogs.

Since a lot of the examples are in cartoons and because of the stubby snout and large jowls, the bulldog was probably used where they wanted what Preston Blair called the "Heavy Pugnacious Character". In many cases, the breed's characteristic features are exaggerated—for example, the lower teeth that protrude slightly from the mouth in many bulldogs may be depicted as full-on tusks like those of a pig.

Bulldogs being vicious and short-tempered is a Dead Horse Trope now since bulldogs _were_ vicious many years ago when they were still bred to fight Brutish Bulls for sport, hence the name. When this sport was outlawed, bulldogs had their viciousness bred out of them so they could be kept as pets. It's reflected in fiction, too: Modern "mean dogs" are almost always Rottweilers, Pit Bull breeds, Doberman Pinschers, German Shepherds, and Chihuahuas.

Almost Always Male. Subtrope of Dog Stereotype.

Compare Psycho Poodle, another breed-specific trope. Contrast Big Friendly Dog.

Bully Bulldog Example in Comic Books

-   Zig-Zagged with Terror from **The Boys**. On the one hand, he's a fairly decent dog if you're a friend of the protagonists. On the other hand. . . well, let's just say there aren't many dogs who have been trained to **rape on command.**
-   Donald Duck comics have this in almost every issue. Normally it's someone climbing a fence just to notice he's landed on the bulldog territory. This is a stock scene, and is sometimes parodied. It might not be a bulldog, but an equally vicious poodle for instance, or even if the dog is just a sleeping puppy, the character is terrified.

    **Bulldog:** Your whiskers tickle cats, and since I can't stand to be tickled by no cats, I'm going to tear your tails off and have 'em for breakfast.  
    **Meowrice:** **(pleading)** We understand your feelings, sir, nothing like cats' tails for breakfast, but **(spots Mewsette)** back there among those barrels is—  
    **(The bulldog at Meowrice and his goons and attacks them)**  
    **Meowrice:** Please, let's talk this over!

Bully Bulldog Example in Literature

-   Discussed in **Doglands**. Kinnear, a soft and lazy English bulldog, talks about how bulldogs were once vicious bull-fighters, but the aggression has been bred out of them to make them placid and "perfect" pets. Furgul (a lurcher) finds this more pitiful than anything; he loves being a wild and free dog.
-   In **Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban**, Harry's mean aunt, Marge, breeds bulldogs. She brings one of them named Ripper, which has some nasty implications, when she visits the Dursleys, who used to chase Harry around when he was ten. In that case of course, its more the owner who is the bully and the dog is a product of its upbringing.
-   Jack from **Little House on the Prairie** is the pet English Bulldog in the 1800s. He is an aggressive guard dog towards wild animals and is wary of strangers, but is friendly and protective towards his family.
-   Terror from **Survivor Dogs** is a pit bull-mastiff mix who is a Bad Boss to his subordinates. He gets Killed Off for Real in the first book, however.
-   **Underworlds**: Mad Dog, from the Babylonian Underworld, is basically a giant bulldog.
-   In the novel **White Fang**, the wolf fights a bulldog in a dogfight. Cherokee the bulldog subverts this trope because he is described as neither vicious or bullying: "Cherokee did not seem anxious to fight. He turned his head and blinked at the men who shouted, at the same time wagging his stump of a tail good-naturedly. He was not afraid, but merely lazy." He's more an instance of Killer Rabbit with a side Implacable Man, calmly wearing White Fang down to the strangling point.

Bully Bulldog Example in  Live Action TV

-   In **Power Rangers S.P.D.**, Drill Sergeant Nasty Sgt. Silverback owns a robot bulldog, similar to the team's own robot dog Team Pet.

Bully Bulldog Example in Tabletop Games

**Fraidy Cats** is a Roll-and-Move game where the gimmick is that a motorized bulldog roams the board hunting for the players' cat tokens, which he'll send flying if he bumps into the fencepost they're standing on. Later editions Bowdlerize the vicious bulldog into an Ugly Cute, clumsy pug.

Funnily enough, Snubbulls are also popular pets among fashion conscious young women — and as of Gen VI, they're both pure Fairy types.
-   Muggshot from **Sly Cooper** series is a super-tough Nigh-Invulnerable Jerkass with two gigantic Tommy guns — definitely not a nice guy. Ironically, his Freudian Excuse is that **he** was bullied as a child.
-   Jim from **Toonstruck** is a narcissistic bulldog who can be found in his gym punching a punchbag (next to machine that does nothing but stomp a cat who just sits there for no reason), barking (figuratively) at anyone daring to touch his exercising equipment. He will also show his athletic skills to anyone who asks, without even double-checking his equipment.

He gets what he deserves at the end of the short when he overeats and winds up in a hospital, and the cat and mouse force feed him gravy.
    -   Spike, in all of his appearances looked and acted like a tough guy, even down to wearing a bowler hat. He also acted very rudely and aggressively even towards his fawning toady Chester, shouting at him and hitting him to shut him up. Nonetheless, he did care about his opinion saving face in front of him, when against apparently Sylvester (who in truth was either an escaped panther or the Mister Hyde version of Sylvester). He wasn't so tough with them.
    -   Hector. Most of the time his role consisted of presenting a physical protection of Tweety from Sylvester whom he effortlessly beat up. Many times though this seemed to be an excuse rather than the reason, making him more of a Heroic Comedic Sociopath.
    -   Subverted with Marc Anthony from **Feed the Kitty**, who turns out to be a completely nice and kind dog, though not unless he has to deal with Claude.

-   Kevin from **Mr. Bogus** will very often chase Bogus around the house, but he will sometimes assist him when there's any kind of problem.
