Coming of Age Story: 
_"Son of man, look to the sky  
Lift your spirit, set it free  
Some day you'll walk tall with pride  
Son of man, a man in time you'll be!"_

A story featuring an adolescent making the mental leap from child to adult. In real life, this happens over the course of several years. Literature, films and some television series are media that have the space to show the story at a slow pace. But for a movie, things have to be compressed to several months at the most, so expect some _really_ accelerated character development. The words _bildungsroman_ (Ger. "educational novel") or _bildungsgeschichte_ (Ger. "educational story") are sometimes used to describe these kinds of stories. A note on the translation: the terms originated in the Age of Enlightenment, when "Bildung" meant not only "education" but also "self-improvement" (cf. English "building") — or as Werner Heisenberg put it, _Bildung_ is "that which is still there after you've forgotten everything you had ever learned". In other words, it's not a "novel to educate the readers" but a "novel about the hero becoming someone".

**Usually includes some combination of the following**:

-   Bittersweet 17
-   Coming Of Age Queer Romance
-   Death by Newbery Medal
-   Declaration of Personal Independence
-   Down the Rabbit Hole
-   The Hero's Journey
-   First disagreement with parents.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   First experimentation with drugs, alcohol, tobacco or any combination of the three.
-   Growing Up Sucks
    -   Having One Last Field Trip
-   The divorce of the main character's parents.
-   Sex as Rite-of-Passage
-   Coming-Out Story
-   Combat (often replaced with sports in more peaceful times)
-   Hunting or the main character getting their first job
-   Finally seeing one's Parents as People
-   Trying to stand out, paradoxically, by fitting in
-   Wanting to have friends or be popular
-   First crushes or relationships
-   Receiving The Talk
-   Going through some kind of Rite of Passage
-   If The Protagonist is female, possibly some Women's Mysteries
-   Sometimes involves Aesop Collateral Damage
-   First experience with grief, loss, death, rejection, etc.
-   Break the Cutie
-   Puberty and developing sexuality
-   Leaving one's parents
-   Questioning religious beliefs, or societal traditions/rules/customs. Perhaps even doing away with any one of them, or changing them.
-   First experience with sexism, racism, homophobia, or other prejudice (either their own, or that of others)
-   A loss of innocence: Things truly get worse to get better for the character as the story fully breaks the character's comfortable yet stagnant lifestyle. The character's mental health is pushed to its breaking point but characters are able to grow and mature through their suffering. as it can allow them to show some incentive to move forward with their lives. It is important that the character is still dealing with the traumas of their story, i.e. death of a loved one, injustice, etc.
-   Identity: Metaphorically speaking, it's losing the nativity of childhood, reflecting on the choices made in their childhood, and the character maturing from their bad habits. In literal cases, it could be getting a tattoo for the first time, changing hairstyles, and going into new territory (new job, apprenticeship, new country, etc.). In the simplest form, it's self-awareness and a struggle between self-identification and addressing who the character ''really'' is.
-   Senior Year Struggles: Facing the future in one's last year of school.
-   Break the Badass: Forcing an action hero to confront the emotional and psychological baggage they left behind on their adventures, baggage that has stunted their psychological growth and overall maturity.

A variation is the _Delayed Coming of Age Story_, in which the person has remained mentally a child their entire life and only finally experiences these things sometime between their late 20s and mid-40s.

Mainstream film coming-of-age stories tend toward dramedy. Independent film or novel stories lean toward drama, sometimes jumping headlong into Wangst.

## Examples

Coming of Age Story Example in Anime & Manga

By Creator

-   Once you look past the Fanservice, many of Masakazu Katsura's works turn out to be this. Specially obvious in:
    -   **Video Girl Ai**
    -   **I"s**; both of them feature highschool students dealing with their friendships, viewpoints in life, and their first romantic and sexual experiences.

By Work

-   **Akatsuki no Aria** is one set in Imperial Japan, where future Elegant Classical Musician Aria Kanbara begins a rocky journey to stardom and to love.
-   **Akebi's Sailor Uniform** is essentially one for main character Komichi Akebi, as she adjusts to middle school while interacting with other girls her own age for the first time (since she grew up in the remote countryside and was the only member of her elementary school class). At several points Komichi has to stop and consider her overall image and the kind of person she wants to be, especially since her Sailor Fuku makes her stand out despite her desire to be part of a group.
-   **Anohana The Flower We Saw That Day**: Five friends who have fallen apart after the sixth friend died five years ago are brought back together and decide to work through their trauma after her ghost appears to one of them. By the end, they're all at least on the path to healing and growing up.
-   **Ashita no Nadja**: It starts when Nadja has to leave the only home she has known, travelling with the Dandelion Troupe to find her origins and grow up...
-   **Asteroid in Love**: Relatively unusual among series serialized in **Manga Time Kirara**<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>, the series gives large emphasis on how the cast grows up and seeks self-improvement. More obvious are cases of Grew a Spine that Ao and Mai goes through, but even **Mira**, who is otherwise relatively static, also sees improvement in her intellectual side.
-   **Baki the Grappler**: Baki Hanma starts the series as a fight-happy and attention-starved 13 year old fixated on defeating his father Yujiro. Over the course of the series, Baki's growth is both physical and mental, most notably when he has sex for the first time with his girlfriend Kozue, after which he's described as having finally "Become a man" in a sense.
-   **Beastars**: The manga is this for every character, but particularly for the protagonist Legosi. The setting is a world where anthropomorphic animals, carnivores and herbivores, live together in relative peace, though with multiple tensions regarding the carnivores necessity to eat meat, their drives and desire for it, the herbivores fears of being eaten, and how society should accommodate those needs. The characters are in the last years of high school, and come to realize the uncomfortable realities lying beneath the facade of the town, as well as having to decide how they want to fit in, or even how they want to transgress the rules of the society they exist in, like the fact that most main characters start realizing how their romantic preferences are taboo for the world at large, most notably, the romance between the carnivore Legosi and the herbivore Haru.

-   **Black Clover** is this for the main characters: Asta, Yuno and Noelle. Asta leave his home to become a Wizard King, Yuno must use his powers to be one of the best Magic Knights for Golden Dawn, and Noelle has to prove herself as a successful Magic Knight.
-   **Blue Period** focuses on the end of high school/start of college in Yatora's life, how he grows up, learns about art, and about himself in the process.
-   **Bokurano** can be interpreted as such. The story begins with a narrative of the protagonist, Waku Takashi, who recalls the event that changes his life, and 14 other kids, during a summer field trip. The death of each pilot can be seen as a metaphor for growing up, in which a child loses its innocence and becomes an adult. The ending also implies that Jun Ushiro was the one to narrate the story, not Waku. This ties to the coming of age theme, given that he experienced the most growth throughout the story, and was alive long enough to witness the "maturity" of other pilots.
-   **Bokura no Hentai** is three coming of age stories crammed into one story. It revolves around three middle schoolers who meet on a website for crossdressers. The story takes place over the course of three years and has their personalities develop and mature. For example, Tamura has to overcome his Dark and Troubled Past and the lingering mental trauma it has caused him. In his case, he never really does.
-   **Chrono Crusade** seems to be a coming-of-age story for Rosette, particularly in the manga. It might be one for Chrono as well, although he'd be a "late bloomer" example as he's Really 700 Years Old.

-   **A Cruel God Reigns** is very much a coming of age story for not only Jeremy and Ian, but also for many of the supporting characters, like Vivi, Nadia, William, Cass, and Marjorie. However, the story focuses mainly on how Jeremy and Ian break into adulthood after the trauma of Jeremy's Rape as Backstory and Ian dealing with the fact that Jeremy killed his father.

-   The entire subplot of **Dragon Ball Z** is essentially Gohan growing up with adventures similar to Goku's, his father, albeit far more violent. Like its predecessor, **Dragon Ball**, the series ends when Gohan is married and has a family of his own.
-   **Candy Candy** covers Candy's whole life since she was taken in by Miss Pony and Sister Maria as a baby, until she's at least in her twenties.
-   **Cat Street** focuses on protagonist Keito's mental development, overcoming her Dark and Troubled Past as a child actress and finding out how she wants to live her life from now onwards.
-   **Claudine** tells the story of a noble young trans man who grows up from a boy to a young man during early 1900s France.

-   **Eyeshield 21** boils down to the main character growing out of his wimpy kid mold and becoming a man (albeit a rather wimpy man).
-   **Fate/Zero** has this as a subplot, specifically Waver Velvet, a mage with great potential only marred by his belief of his genetics limiting him and his self-hatred due to how he was treated by others. He learns to stand up for himself, by entering the Holy Grail War and teaming up with a Boisterous Bruiser version of Alexander The Great, who functions as Waver's mentor figure. By the end of the story, he manages to earn Gilgamesh's respect and is the only surviving Master who is better off at the end of the war than he was at the start.
    -   In a sense, the main character Kiritsugu Emiya could be seen as going through this as well. Though Kiritsugu is an adult, he still clings to childish beliefs about dividing the world into clear cut good and evil, as well as believing that he needs to become a "Hero of Justice" who can destroy all evil and create world peace, at any cost. Kiritsugu in his backstory started to question this ideal because of the tragedies he saw while fighting what he deemed evil but in the main plot, does his best to believe that world peace and becoming a true "hero" is attainable. In the end, Kiritsugu finds out from the Holy Grail that world peace is not possible and morals are extremely complex, to say the least. By this point, Kiritsugu has sacrificed everything from his ideals to his wife and best friend for a shot at world peace, just to get nothing out of it. Kiritsugu does manages to save the world but not give it peace and is left saddened by the fact he needs to grow up and accept the world as it is, as well as how he lost everyone he cared about.
    -   In addition, Kirei Kotomine, the Foil to Kiritsugu, goes through this as well. Kirei, despite being highly intelligent and capable at almost anything he ever tried, has never felt as if his life is worth living or indeed any life if worth living. There is nothing that brings him joy so he does whatever anyone else tells him to do, and due to this is nothing more than a pawn of the Church and its Ancient Conspiracy. He also has childish aspects in how he tries to cling to simple beliefs about good and evil, specifically any beliefs about good and evil that the Church tells him, all while ironically being an assassin for the Church and also being taught Thou Shalt Not Kill. Kirei eventually finds himself questioning why as an adult he still listens to his father and mentor figure, and does not think for himself. Kirei meets Gilgamesh, who teaches him how to figure out what he truly desires, which Kirei knows deep down but is fearful to accept. Kirei accepts that the only thing that brings him the desire to live and happiness is causing other people to suffer and die. From that point on, he fights in the war for himself and his own amusement, except for wanting to meet and defeat Kiritsugu, who he believes is like him.
    -   Arguably, many of the main characters are going through this in varying ways, not just the ones above.
-   **FLCL**, but since it's made by Studio Gainax, it's a coming of age story combined with Humongous Mecha, a Mind Screw plot, and loads of confusing and gratuitous sexual symbolism and humor. Basically, protagonist Naota tries really hard to be an adult — or what he considers to be an adult — and picks up the slack for his absent brother, who has left to play baseball in America. This includes taking care of his brother's ex-girlfriend, not enjoying sweet things and trying really hard to come off as stoic and cool. However, after meeting Manic Pixie Dream Girl Haruko, he comes to realise that he should act his age — in this case, being selfish, having fun and acknowledging his childish crush on Haruko.

-   **Full Moon** deals with the protagonist, Mitsuki, having to grow up while dealing with the fact that she doesn't have much time to live.
-   **Fushigi Yuugi** is a coming-of-age story, among other things, for just about all the good guys — especially Miaka. While it takes somewhere between a few weeks to a few months for them to finish their journey in the book, it's only two days in the real world.

-   **Goodnight Punpun** is a particularly dark (and strange) example about a boy (who is stylized like a cartoony bird) and his development as he grows into an adult. He starts off as an optimistic, rather innocent elementary schooler but very quickly takes a downhill journey into cynicism and depression as he ages. The other characters don't fare much better.
-   **Grand Blue** is a rare college example of this.
-   **GUN×SWORD** is a coming of age story for Wendy. It's not the main plot, but it's a pretty important subplot.
-   The main premise of **Hidamari Sketch** centers on Yuno's desire to be seen as mature. Lampshaded, as she becomes overjoyed every time someone compliments her on her supposed maturity.
-   **Hitohira**: Shy school girl — check. Situation that forces change—check. Affectionate friends to help her—check. It's still very well done, though.

-   Much of **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 7: Steel Ball Run** is dedicated to the character development and growth of the protagonist Johnny Joestar. It's even spelled out at the beginning of the story:
    
    ”This story is about how I got up on my feet. Not in the physical sense, but how I went from adolescence to adulthood."
    
-   **Kill la Kill**: Not only is the show a uniquely female coming of age story (which tend to be more rare), but it's cranked up until the knob pops off. Blood as a metaphor for menstruation, as well as other body image issues? Senketsu is a sailor uniform that drinks Ryuko's blood to transform into a superpowered garter-belt bikini thing. Bullies that the adults never do anything about? The Student Council President runs the school like a dictatorship, and everyone — including the teachers — are under her control. Feel like the entire school is against you? At Honnoji Academy, literally the entire school is actually trying to kill Ryuko. Worried about living up to your parents' expectations? Ryuko and Satsuki (who are sisters, by the way) were designed by their parents to be weapons in various ways. And high and mighty Satsuki is the **failed** version. Feel out of place among your peers? Ryuko is a Half-Human Hybrid. And of course, The Power of Friendship saves the day at the end, and everybody learns that not only does everybody have their own reasons, but they have their own crazy friends.
-   **Kokou no Hito** is a story about the main character, a highly introverted and lethargic young man, reaching manhood, struggling to get by life as a "solo climber" but finding out that it isn't that easy to just turn your back on society and be a hermit.
-   **Hello! Sandybell** begins when Sandybell is a pre-teen and is about her searching for her long-lost mother after her father dies. The anime ends when she reunites with her after a long journey, in the small island of Lefkada, Greece - by this time, Sandybell's sixteen.
-   The **Macross** TV shows (**Super Dimension Fortress Macross**, **Macross 7**, **Macross Frontier**, and **Macross Delta**) all feature this, with Hikaru Ichijo of **SDF** being the first in the franchise to fit this trope. He starts off not wanting anything to do with the military, but the death of Roy Fokker forces him to mature and become a great pilot.
-   **March Comes in Like a Lion** is essentially one for the protagonist Rei Kiriyama, as many of the story arcs build upon his Character Development with the events that transpire in both the world of shogi and his home life, as well as with the life lessons he learns from them.
-   **Megazone 23**, at least the first part. It contains elements of most of the examples from the top of this page and ends on a decidely negative note.
-   In **Mob Psycho 100**, the final arc of the series and the ending comes full circle in settling the entire story was truly this. Every person Mob meets, every new friend he makes, every battle he wins, all served to make Mob slowly but surely learn new things to break through his repressed emotions; the series' climax appears to be Mob having one final challenge: confess his feelings to Tsubomi in hopes he becomes her boyfriend, however, the true climax was Mob having to finally face ???, the part of him Mob has denied for so long, it is through accepting ??? wholeheartedly as himself all along, not some secret failsafe personality only to be used to win battles and then tuck it away. It is telling that Mob being rejected by Tsubomi is just another hurdle to make Mob look beyond just wishing for a girlfriend, his true reward at the end is becoming a person completely free of all the previous emotion suppression, Mob has made many friends along the way, he lives a happy life, he is open to all possibilities because Mob now believes in himself, including remaining friends with Tsubomi; the finale being a simple shot of Mob's only honest laugh in the entire series is the perfect portrayal of that.
-   Amuro Ray of **Mobile Suit Gundam** was probably the best of the earliest examples in mecha anime. Amuro got slapped very often by Bright Noa and this helped shape him into a man. Even Bright explicitly tells him that a good smacking would force him to become one.
    -   Kamille Bidan in the sequel **Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam** is forced to mature to an even greater extent, as he faces the harsh circumstances of warfare, starts having a romantic relationship, and loses many of his loved ones.
-   **Mobile Suit Gundam AGE** features this in the first two generations with their protagonists, Flit and Asemu Asuno, respectively, though their development differs wildly (Flit develops from a Messianic Archetype into a Dark Messiah, whereas Asemu develops from a "Well Done, Son" Guy into his own person).
-   **Mokke**, where ghosts are being used to illustrate lessons about life.
-   This is the main plot for **My Daddy Long Legs**, which chronicles Judy's development from a young teenager to an adult.

-   **Naruto Shippuden** shows the title character's growth from the least talented **and** least loved ninja in his village to a fully recognized prodigy who has saved thousands of people and faced down some of the worst criminals the world has to offer. Also (to an extent) Sasuke, who has matured from being the Rival to being homicidally crazy.
-   If you boil all the Unwanted Harem bits and leave only the core of the plot, you can see that **Negima! Magister Negi Magi** is basically a story of Negi growing from good-natured and smart but somewhat clumsy and socially awkward kid into a great hero, a true successor to his legendary father. Only with magic and kung-fu. It's also a literal coming of age story, as his constant use of Evangeline's Year Inside, Hour Outside resort has presumably aged him up by at least a year.
-   **Neon Genesis Evangelion**: Zig-Zagged. For a while it seems like the characters are **failing** to come of age and are suffering for it, but most of them play it straight in the end. Shinji overcomes his self-hatred and resolves to continue living in order find happiness — rejecting Instrumentality in the process. Misato accepts her love for Kaji and fulfills her role as Shinji's guardian, saving his life at the cost of her own and motivating him to continue living. Rei affirms her individuality by abandoning Gendo and subsequently becomes a god-like entity and Spirit Advisor to Shinji. Even Asuka is hinted to have changed for the better when she gives Shinji the equivalent of a Cooldown Hug as he strangles her at the end of The Movie — the first genuinely nice thing she's done for him.

-   **Okko's Inn** is about Okko learning to come to terms with loss, and also to be more self-sufficient and helping others.
-   **Onani Master Kurosawa** started out as a parody of **Death Note** with fapping. However, it gradually turns into a coming-of-age story once the titular character realizes the consequences of his dispensing of "justice" (i.e. masturbating on the clothes of female students who bully one particular girl who caught him fapping in the first place). "Coming"-of-age never sounded so dirty.
-   **One Piece** is described by Oda as a coming of age story. Namely, what it is to become a man.

-   **Real** heartbreakingly deals with teenagers forced to grow up because of the disabilities that they've suddenly had to accept in order to deal with the world around them.
-   **Reborn! (2004)**, when it boils down to it. It's really mostly about Tsuna being shaped and trained by Reborn into becoming a real man fit for being the 10th Generation Vongola boss.
-   **Ring ni Kakero** doubles as this and as a sports manga. Ryuuji and Kiku, the main characters, escape as children from an abusive household and decide to fulfill their shared dream to have Ryuuji become the best boxer in the world. In their way they grow not just as a boxer and his trainer, but as persons as well.
-   **Rosario + Vampire** is this for Tsukune, once you take out the Unwanted Harem elements. He starts of as a directionless Ordinary High-School Student, but gradually becomes a more mature and confident individual, and dedicates himself to promoting peaceful relations between humans and monsters.
-   **Sakende Yaruze!** is basically a Coming Of Age Story for Nakaya that runs parallel to a Children Raise You story for his father Shino.
-   **Seishun Kouryakuhon** revolves around this, being a Slice of Life manga focusing on the four main characters' journey to high school graduation.
-   **Shadow Star**. Shiina copes with loss and tragedy and learns a great deal about friendship, love, and the complexities of people and the world. Then she and her partner/Shadow Archetype, Mamiko, wipe out all of mankind together.
-   **Shuukan Shounen Hachi** is about teenagers entering a special school to be become pro manga artists, but according to the author himself the story is less about manga than about Hachi's growth as a person. It applies not just to Hachi but also the people he interacts with like Handa and Inohara, as the characters learn from each other, acknowledging and facing their own flaws. The theme was already very prominent in one of Masuda Eiji's previous works **Sakura Discord**.

-   **Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann**, also made by Studio Gainax, plays this straight with its main character, Simon. Specially the first arc, where it's pretty much the whole point of the story.
-   **Tokyo Magnitude 8.0** is about a bratty thirteen year old girl named Mirai who, along with her Cheerful Child brother Yuuki, get stuck while visiting a museum due to earthquakes. Mirai's Character Development has her maturing out of her aggressive and cynical personality.

-   **Wandering Son** has this, but the anime and manga portray it in a different way. The anime seems to be more so about kids learning to be comfortable with their bodies and growing up, apparently changing the protagonists from Transgender to Wholesome Crossdressers. The manga isn't nearly as obvious as the anime, but it's still apparent. The manga began in late elementary, and follows the protagonists as they graduate high school. They develop as they grow up. For example, Nitori starts as a sensitive child prone to Tender Tears but matures over the course of the series and becomes more confident in herself.
-   **Welcome Back, Alice**: Depicts high school students struggling mightily to navigate adolescence, and they end up hurting each other in their attempts to get a handle on how they feel about gender and sexuality.

-   **Wolf Children** follows the first decade or so of the two title characters' lives, as they grow up with only their mother and each other, and struggle to straddle the two worlds they were born into: that of humans and that of wolves. Yuki goes from a Plucky Girl to a more humble and mature person, while Ame matures from a Shrinking Violet into The Stoic. At the end, the siblings go their separate ways, with Yuki choosing her human nature while Ame lives out his life as a wolf.
-   **Wonder Egg Priority** is about a group of teen girls who hunt monsters representing suicidal thoughts, representing their own personal growth and the development of more nuanced, supportive relationships.
-   Almost all of the **World Masterpiece Theater** series are Coming of Age-stories, but it's played the straightest in **Anne of Green Gables**, where Anne visually gets older as the story progresses.

Coming of Age Story Example in Comic Books

-   Anya in **Anya's Ghost** struggles to deal with highschool life and becomes a more mature person, with goals beyond impressing boys or looking cool.
-   **Black Science** gives Pia one in the background of Issue 22. She crash-lands without adult protection and survives by securing a political engagement and negotiating a peace agreement between the warring tribes. Grant is shaken by how much she's grown when he catches up to her.
-   **Bloom (2019)** is this, as well as a Queer Romance. The story focuses on the main character Ari becoming less cynical and bitter about having to stay behind working at his family's bakery and growing up and becoming a more loving individual and being who he is.
-   **Bone**: Thorn goes from a sweet Farm Girl clueless of her upbringing, to a troubled girl who has a tough time coping with her identity once she finds out who she is, to finally a competent young warrior who ends up saving the valley and becoming queen.

-   The story of **Democracy**, apart from retelling how this government was formed, is also about the young protagonist reaching adulthood.
-   **The Flash**: Barry Allen died just when Wally West was reaching into adulthood.

-   **Spider-Man**: In nearly all his incarnations. Spider-Man's origin story includes Peter Parker getting superpowers, using them for profit, and then failing to help stop a criminal who later kills his Uncle Ben. This causes Peter to realize that with great power comes great responsibility. Note that as a coming-of-age story, Spider-Man's origin story is lopsided. It includes the decision to be an adult, but not the learning to be an adult.
-   **Superman**:
    -   Most of Superman's origin stories — like **Action Comics** #158, **Superman: Secret Origin**, **Superman: Birthright** and **Action Comics (New 52)** focus on teenager Clark Kent discovering his powers — and occasionally his alien heritage — and figuring out his place in the world. In Pre-Crisis continuities, his transition to adulthood was marked by his biological parent's deaths from disease, which worked as a perpetual and bitter reminder that his powers cannot do everything and he cannot save everybody.
    -   **Red Daughter of Krypton** is about teenager Supergirl joining a group of rage-fueled anti-heroes after failing to fit in among humans and becoming unable to get over her anger and grief caused by her home's destruction and her family's demise. In the course of the story, Kara meets and befriends badly-damaged people, fights mass-murdering monsters, learns how to manage her anger, manages to overcome her pain, loneliness and Survivor Guilt, and at the end she accepts she has a new home to protect.
    -   **The Unknown Supergirl** focuses on 16-years-old Linda Lee being adopted, leaving the orphanage, and adjusting to her new life while she deals with abrupt physical and psychological changes. Finally, her cousin reveals her existence to the world, and she has to struggle to take on new responsibilities and to live up to Superman's legacy.
    -   In **Way of the World**, Supergirl promises to save a little boy with brain cancer. Her more experienced peers warn that she is over her head, but Kara dismisses her warnings and counters super-heroes should be more proactive. At the end, she fails to save little Thomas, she fails to bring him back to life, and she even considers time travel to set things right. At the end, though, she comes to accept that her powers cannot do everything, and she should move on and learn from her mistakes and focus on what she can do instead of fighting against the inevitabilities of life.
-   In **Tales of the Jedi**, the last arc, "Redemption," centers around Vima Sunrider when she becomes old enough for Jedi training. She starts as a rash and lonely girl, but with the help of the Force, seeks out Ulic Qel-Droma as her teacher and gains the maturity she needs to be a Jedi.
-   **X-Men**:
    -   The story starts with middle-aged Professor X training the five original X-Men, who are all teenage rookies, into becoming the heroes their world needs. Even if this world hates them for it. Over the years, the rookies become seasoned veterans who no longer depend on their mentor, and more people join the ranks. With the process or rookie to veteran repeated, at least for those who manage to survive the near-constant battles. Characters who used to be the students, have long since graduated into teacher-mentor positions.
    -   **New Mutants** and its sequels focus on the coming-of-age story of a new generation of teenage mutants, and then their students, who even had an arc called "Childhood's End".
-   In Emilka Sza one of biggest arcs is around character Maya who turns from irresponisible Spoiled Brat who cant take care of herself, to much more mature person who owns up to her flaws and confronts her. She literaly goes from having a 9 year old boy helping her go to bed, to becoming a Cool Big Sis to him.

-   This is the plot behind the entire series of **Pokémon: The Great Adventure**. Ash travels across the régions with a mysterious mentor and learns to become a stronger Trainer and Aura Guardian while growing up and facing the reality of life.
-   **The Ragged Lady**, a **The Dresden Files** fic, portrays the first manifestation of a wizard's magical talent as something akin to this trope.
    
    Everything felt different now. When Molly was a child, she was sure she'd feel like a completely different person when she started her first period—she'd be a woman, she'd be almost grown up. But a period turned out to be messy and just another chore. But this… this was what she'd been looking for, trying out new clothes, reading new books, hanging out with new people. She'd been searching for it the last two years, she thought, when she'd first felt restless and out of place. This was it. It was **here** and it was **now**.
    
-   **The Blacksmith's Apprentice** is at least partly this for Hiccup; after being disinherited and rejected by Stoick when he failed to perform well in dragon training, as the fic starts Hiccup is just Gobber's assistant and basically reduced to the status of village thrall, with only Astrid consistently kind to him. As events unfold, Stoick is 'forced' to temporarily allow Hiccup to act as heir again as he recognises that his current choice of Snotlout is inadequate (even if Stoick initially argues that Snotlout just isn't ready **yet** rather than acknowledging that he never will be), which gives him a chance to see Hiccup demonstrate his leadership and ability to make decisions. Finally, Stoick officially outcasts Snotlout when the other Viking tries to rape Astrid, openly stating that he now recognises that Hiccup was just a late bloomer rather than a runt, even before he learns about Toothless and Hiccup's new group of dragon riders.
-   **Knight Errand**does this for Antoine D'Coolette as he goes on a knight errant to find himself, a classic example of The Hero's Journey.

-   **Neon Genesis Evangelion: Genocide** has Shinji and Asuka grow up, overcome their worst issues and learn to open up and love each other.

Coming of Age Story Example in Films — Animation

-   **How to Train Your Dragon 2** has Hiccup who is not sure of his place in the world at the beginning of the film and is unwilling to take up the mantle of chief that his father Stoick is trying to force upon him. But by the end of the film, after his father's death, Hiccup finally finds his place, and is now ready and willing to become the Chief of Berk.
-   Downplayed but present in **Inside Out**. Riley is twelve, and during the course of the movie the landscape of her mind changes in ways to indicate she is maturing. For instance, large sections of her imagination are demolished and her imaginary friend is erased, replaced by a machine that spits out idealised, devoted boyfriends. It also shows many of her oldest memories being lost as she moves away from her early years, and her idyllic, happy core memories and the personality islands they created are replaced by a wider selection produced by multiple emotions, showing her developing beyond "happy kid who likes hockey".
-   **The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part**: In a way. "Growing up" is a recurring theme in the narrative, with a lot of Emmet's personal conflict having to do with still being upbeat in a world where everyone is telling him to change his tune and "get with the times". As Emmet, Wyldstyle and the rest are arguably Finn's Author Avatars, it reflects his own struggles with growing up now that he's a teenager. There's also a point to be made that the film deals with how to grow up, with Rex representing the easy, angsty, and cynical method that helps no one but yourself — "don't let anyone else play with you, even if that means breaking everything, putting all your toys into storage, and giving up on your imagination" — as opposed to the much harder route of being aware that life has letdowns and compromises with others, but rolling with the punches and persevering through it to find the fun you can have by including people other than just yourself, as detailed in the Everything's Not Awesome song.
-   **Monsters University** is a college campus coming-of-age story mainly for Mike Wazowski as well as Sully, as they study to be scarers, while trying to figure out if they're really meant to be scarers.
-   **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem** is a film about a quartet of brothers who happen to be… well, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as they come into their own and seek to journey into the world and be accepted by human society.
-   Many interpret **The Thief and the Cobbler** as this for the main character Tack, who begins the story skinny, pale, and mute, but by the end becomes muscular, tan, is much more confident in himself and has the voice of Sean Connery!
-   The main themes of the **Toy Story** series revolve around growing up, moving on, and that nothing lasts forever. Andy goes from being a carefree young boy to a young man heading off to college, and his toys realizing, and eventually facing the fact that Andy will inevitably outgrow them. This reaches its ultimate conclusion in **Toy Story 4** when Woody learns owners do not constrain toys, and he can live an impactful life not tied to another kid.
    
    "How long will it last, Woody? Do you really think Andy is going to take you to college? Or on his honeymoon? Andy's growing up... and there's nothing you can do about it."
    
-   **Turning Red** is about Meilin "Mei" Lee, a 13-year-old Chinese-Canadian girl whose sudden transformations into a huge red panda correspond with how she's learning more about herself and how to embrace the wilder, messier side of her that her red panda form represents.

Coming of Age Story Example in Films — Live-Action

-   A perennial subgenre is the teenaged ensemble comedy. Examples include:
    -   **American Graffiti** was the Trope Codifier for the nostalgia version of this type of film. It's a Random Events Plot involving teenagers at the end of summer vacation in the early 60s. Most of the film is based on George Lucas's own memories of growing up in that era.
-   **The Confirmation**: A major focus is the tween Anthony maturing and witnessing harsh realities about the world.

-   **Fast Times at Ridgemont High** follows a group of high school students over the course of one year as they all grapple with issues of impending adulthood.
-   **Stand by Me** starts out as a road movie where four boys walk a few miles to see a dead body, but morphs into this as the boys talk about their hopes for the future. Also subverts the Nostalgia Filter hard as it shows that 1950s suburbia was far from Arcadia.
-   **The Outsiders** deals with a feud between two rival gangs — Greasers and Socs. The protagonist is a teen who has to deal with running away from home, attempted murder, rebuilding his relationship with his brothers and the deaths of two friends.

-   The first **American Pie** film deals with four teens on the verge of graduating high school, who view Sex as Rite-of-Passage and want to all lose their virginity together. Throughout the film, Jerk Jock Oz discovers a sensitive side, Kevin realises that his relationship probably won't last after school and nerdy Jim realises there's more to life than just sex.

-   Time Travel elements aside, **About Time** is about a 21-year-old leaving his parents' home for the first time and going through adulthood. Most of Tim's experiences are very typical of a coming-of-age story: he gets a job, goes through heartbreak after getting rebuffed by his First Love Charlotte, falls in love with Mary, and deals with the grief of his father's death.
-   **American Honey** follows teenaged Star as she joins a traveling sales crew and experiences all the hallmarks of adolescence—first love, finding her own identity, heartbreak, and belonging.
-   **A Monster Calls**: Despite the fantastical themes, the story is ultimately about the brooding and cynical Conor coming to terms with not only the inevitability of his mother's death, but his guilt over his feelings about it. Specifically, Conor unconsciously **wants** his mother to die, because watching her die slowly is so painful to him, and he wants that pain (and hers) to end. But the end of that pain will only come with her death, which he doesn't really want. Part of what the Monster is ultimately trying to teach Conor is that it's OK to want to stop hurting so much, despite the only way it can do so, and it doesn't mean he doesn't love his mother or really wants her to be gone.
-   **Antopia** is about a young ant named Buzz Lightbee. He begins as a naïve high school boy trying to impress his crush, Princess Samanta, to saving his town from certain destruction.
-   **An Angel at My Table** is a biographical film about writer Janet Frame and follows her from childhood to adulthood, covering experiences ranging from family tragedy to mental illness and first love.

-   **The Big Night**: On the night of his 17th birthday, George La Main goes gunning for the man who savagely beat his father: undergoing a traumatic passage into manhood in the process.
-   **Blue Is the Warmest Color**'s more accurate title is **Life of Adèle: Chapters 1 and 2** rather than **Blue Is the Warmest Color** as in the original comic book. The film is more of a chronicle of how Adèle transitions from adolescence to adulthood rather than a lesbian love story even though their relationship is the centerpiece of Adèle's life.
-   The overriding plot of **A Bronx Tale**, where teenage Italian-American youth Calogero grows up in the changing and divided world of the 1960s while trying to find his way. Influences pulling him in different directions include, but are not exclusive to his Opposed Mentors, (one being his honest, hardworking and poor immigrant father, the other being the intelligent Affably Evil and wealthy Mafia capo who is like a surrogate father to him) his racist, thuggish neighborhood friends, and his black love interest.
-   **Call Me by Your Name** is about a young Jewish-American boy in 1980s Sicily who develops into an adult through a same-sex romance with his father's summer guest.

-   **The Generation Gap** stars David Chiang and Agnes Chan as a pair of Star-Crossed Lovers who fled from home after their romance is forbidden by their families. Respectively being a school dropout and a teenager, both protagonists learns the hardships of growing up, struggling in a society that rejects them, matures as a result of their actions, but in typical Chang Cheh fashion don't expect the story to have a happy outcome.
-   **The Getting of Wisdom** is about a teenage girl in 1890s Australia being sent to a prestigious boarding school, where she struggles with such issues as acceptance, conformity, romance, friendship, and achievement.
-   **Ginger Snaps**: More for Brigitte than for Ginger. The film juxtaposes both of them growing up as teens while having to deal with Ginger's lycanthropy (and her normal development, as she gets her period at the same time, which ties into this since both are controlled by the moon). Brigitte has to become very much a young woman, finding the way to cure Ginger but then when that doesn't work at last stabbing her to death in self-defense.
-   **The Graduate** is about directionless college student Benjamin Braddock trying to find himself and escape the suburban ennui that his parents and his girlfriend's parents have found themselves in. He more or less fails.

When things don't go according to plan, they end up learning more about themselves in one day than they ever did in school.
-   **Handsome Devil** deals with the coming of age of nerdy outcast Ned and star athlete Conor at a rugby-mad boarding school, when they're forced to share a room together.
-   **Labyrinth**: A girl learning to grow up, at least to some extent, and leave childish things behind and value her family. Note the scene where the Junk Lady starts digging up all of Sarah's old toys to distract her, and Sarah says "It's all junk!"
-   **Lady Bird**: The titular character is a strong-willed and stubborn teenager navigating her final year of high school as she falls In with the In Crowd, attempts to find love, clashes with her equally strong-willed mother, and tries to escape her Hated Hometown of Sacramento by applying to college in New York.
-   **Licorice Pizza** follows the complicated friendship, bordering on romance, that forms between Gary, a 15-year-old child actor eager to grow up, and Alana, an aimless 25-year-old who has no idea what she wants to do with her life, set in the San Fernando Valley during the summer of 1973.
-   **A Little Princess** is a pretty dark version. The rich heroine Sara Crewe is left an orphan and has to work as a servant to survive. Throughout the story, she learns to hold onto her kindness and use her imagination to survive the bad days.
-   **The Man in the Moon** is about 14-year-old Dani, who is in the early stages of adolescence and experiences first love, sibling rivalry, and heartbreak.

-   **On the Wrong Track** is a Shaw Brothers drama revolving around a rebellious teen juvenile delinquent with a disapproving father who forbids his romance with a Vietnamese refugee. One of the examples with a Downer Ending.
-   **Picture Day** is about a Canadian high school student who has to repeat her senior year, and finds herself getting romantically involved with a freshman she used to babysit.
-   **Pitch Perfect**, despite being often described as a film about a cappella singing competitions, is actually about Beca Mitchell's journey from misanthropic jerkass protagonist to a more emotionally mature person capable of friendship and love. It can be argued that the most important musical numbers are not the competition but the more impromptu numbers: the riff-off in which she discovers that despite having joined the Bellas because of a deal made with her father she actually enjoys singing with them, singing Party in the USA on the bus shows her accepting that she's one of those weirdos and likes them, and the practice in the pool in which, by asking Aubrey to pick a song, she shows that she respects the other Bellas.
-   **Plan B (2021)**: Definitely. Two friends have to run away from home to brave the wilds of conservative South Dakota to get contraception.
-   **Punch!** is about a high-school senior in Korea trying to find a direction in life, while simultanously bonding with the Missing Mom who abandoned him as a baby.

By the end he has grown from his shy awkward self, to a self-confident young man determined to take charge of his own life.
    
    **Tagline**: Every boy deserves an adventure.
    
-   **Smooth Talk (1985)** is about Connie, a teenage girl caught between childhood and womanhood. The film is about her exploring her sexuality and the effects that come with that.
-   **The Spectacular Now** has a shallow party boy falling in love with a Geek girl and learning that there is more to life than just having fun and living "in the now".
-   As noted above in Comic Books, Spider-Man across all three film continuities fits this in some way.
    -   The Sam Raimi-directed **Spider-Man Trilogy** featured this across each installment. Firstly dealing with Peter leaving high school, his first job, and learning how judgemental the world can be. The second film dealt with him seeping into depression and losing his powers, and him trying to figure out how he's supposed to live his life. The third film played a more fantastical version of the 'first experiment with drugs' version, as he's exposed to the alien 'black suit' that causes him to begin behaving like a drug addict, and eventually overcome the unstoppable rage it gives.
    -   The Mark Webb-directed **The Amazing Spider-Man** and its sequel (and most likely, the cancelled third entry), played even more like a Coming Of Age movie. The first film explored Peter's issues concerning his birth parents, and dealt extensively with his grief over Uncle Ben's death in more focus and detail, showing how he goes from being angry to learning the 'great responsibility' Aesop. The second film follows the first films' love story as it grows into an adult romance, Peter's continued issues with his parents' mysterious death, and reconnecting with a childhood friend.
    -   The Jon Watts-directed Spider-Man: Homecoming Trilogy: **Spider-Man: Homecoming**, **Spider-Man: Far From Home** and **Spider-Man: No Way Home** takes this a step further, trying to emulate classic John Hughes films. **Homecoming** follows Peter getting his first job and him throwing himself into the excitement of the 'grown up world', and learning to slow down and appreciate his youth and school life. **Far From Home** deals with his grief following Iron Man's death in **Avengers: Endgame**, and going in the opposite direction of the previous movie, learning to step up and become a more responsible, adult figure. **No Way Home** concludes the character's journey, with Peter learning his "great responsibility": keeping going in spite of all the hardships he may encounter and all the mistakes he might make, but above all - sacrificing his happiness for the sake of the others. The trilogy ends with young Spider-Man stripped of his privileges, resources and relationships. But the boy has grown into a man. And he's ready for whatever life holds in store for him.
-   **Splendor in the Grass** is about two high-school sweethearts coping with their sexual awakening in a repressed small-town 1920s environment.
-   **Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope** and **Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace** for Luke, Leia, Anakin, and Padme. Luke and Anakin Skywalker leave their home and family to begin their training as Jedi Knights while Princess Leia and Padme Amidala have to prove themselves as successful leaders.
-   **Submarine** plays with this. The film has the typical arc of a coming of age story, with a teenage protagonist who gets his first girlfriend, and has some adventures. Oliver, the Genre Savvy narrator and protagonist, seems to think he's the star of his own bildungsroman narrative. However, he steadfastly refuses any character development, and ends the movie throwing a temper tantrum that makes him look incredibly immature.
-   **Summer of '42** has its teenage protagonist falling hopelessly in love—and lust—with a young war bride whose husband is off fighting.
-   **Super8** is the tale of a young boy and the girl he likes coming to grips with a shared family tragedy... while a scary escaped alien runs amok in their town.
-   **Thelma**: A horror-filled version. Thelma leaves home for university, the first time she's out of her strict Christian parents' supervision, doing more adult things such as going to parties, drinking and becoming involved with another girl (against their beliefs). Along with that however she's coming to show extreme psychic powers, which Thelma cannot control at first. Breaking out into her own person (for better or worse), accepting her own sexuality and controlling these powers are main intertwined themes.
-   **3 Generations**: The film is about the life of a teenage trans boy as he tries to transition and find out about his Disappeared Dad.
-   Though a minor theme in the first three installments of the **Transformers Film Series** regarding its human characters, the Continuity Reboot **Bumblebee** hones in on it, which makes sense given it focuses on the Kid-Appeal Character of the franchise and tells a more character-driven, low-key story. While Bumblebee himself deals with recovering from a horrible attack by a Decepticon seeker that leaves him unable to talk and without his memory, he befriends a human girl named Charlie who, in-turn, is dealing with the recent death of her father, her mother's remarriage, and her difficulties in life. While Bumblebee re-learns who he is and develops an appreciation for earth, Charlie learns to open herself up again, comes to term with her father's death, and begins to grow more confident.
-   **Ultraman Gaia: The Battle In Hyperspace**, taking a break from the series' norm of being set in the Ultra's universe, is instead a Real-World Episode taking place in **our** reality. For most of the film, it's about a friendless young boy named Tsutomu who idolizes Ultramen, and wishes the Ultras are real, and most of the film deals with Tsutomu struggling with his peers and dealing with bullies in school.
-   **The Wanderers** is about a youth gang in the Bronx. The story focuses on their coming of age in the social turmoil caused by the Kennedy assassination and the Vietnam War.
-   **The Way He Looks** deals with both sexuality and wanting to be independent, with being handicapped as an obstacle.
-   **The Way, Way Back**: Summer vacation, first job and a family crisis.
-   **Wild Boys of the Road** is a pretty dark example of this trope. Two fresh-faced, golly gee-whiz teens hit the road as hobos during The Great Depression because their families don't have enough money to feed them. They suffer through things like brawls with railroad goons, brawls with police, rape, and losing limbs in railroad accidents.
-   **The Wise Kids** involves Crisis of Faith and dealing with sexuality in a heavily Christian small town.
-   **Wish You Were Here (1987)**: A coming-of-age story about a teenage girl in 1950s England without a maternal figure, to be exact.
-   Given its genre **Wonder Woman (2017)** has a very nuanced and coherent coming of age story. Diana starts the movie with a strong moral core and a desire to do make the world a better place, but she is also impulsive, prone to Black-and-White Morality, and judgmental. Throughout the movie she learns more about the world and about herself, and by the end of the movie she has applied the lessons. Some of the key lessons she learns are:
    -   Forgiveness
    -   Seeing the difference between a person and the role they act or are forced into
    -   The relationship between fear and courage
    -   She herself can fail to uphold her ideals
-   **You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah**: The entire movie centers around Stacy preparing for her bat mitzvah, and her Character Development is learning what it means to grow up.
-   **Youth (2017)**: The story follows a group of Chinese youths through the 1970s as members of a military performing arts troupe, facing personal struggles, loss of innocence, and war. When the troupe is ultimately disbanded, it's a sad day all around as they close a chapter of their lives and have to leave the place and people they've spent years with.

Coming of Age Story Example in Literature

By Writer:

-   Nearly anything written by Judy Blume.
-   Author Sarah Dessen specializes in these. All of her novels are coming of age stories for her protagonist, usually following their last school year or last summer before college as they come to terms with their messed up families, gain some true friends and/or fall in love for the first time (sometimes all three).
-   **Robert A. Heinlein** juvenile novels (and a few other short stories) always follow this trope.
-   Stephen King is fond of this trope, though, because it’s Stephen King, they’re usually incredibly dark examples. This includes:
    -   **It**: Half the novel revolves around the Losers’ Club bonding over their shared social isolation and learning about courage, loyalty and the Power of Friendship... whilst battling a malevolent entity that feeds off their fear and eats kids. Some of the kids learn to stand up to their abusive or overbearing parents and Beverly comes to terms with her burgeoning sexuality (which she was previously afraid of due to her creepy father) ...by having sex with all the boys in the Club to maintain their bond.
    -   **Carrie**: The title character stands up to her abusive, zealot mother and learns not to be ashamed of her body, gaining the confidence to dress up and attend prom where she finally feels accepted... only for the school's Alpha Bitch to pull a nasty prank on her, causing her to snap and unleash telekinetic hell on her tormentors.
    -   **The Body** (which later became the film **Stand by Me**) revolves around a group of boys bonding and standing up to bullies over the summer... whilst searching for the corpse of a missing kid.

-   In **The Adventures of Caterpillar Jones**, C.J.'s journey of growth involves him literally transforming from caterpillar to butterfly and, in doing so, symbolically letting go of what's holding him back and embracing his new life.
-   **Aeon Legion: Labyrinth** is about a girl named Terra graduating high school and enlisting in a time traveling army. She leaves her home for the first time and enters a strange new world that constantly challenges her assumptions.

-   **Animorphs** follows five 13-year-olds (and one alien teenager) as they fight a Secret War against invading alien brain slugs, and lose their innocence in the process. At the end, after three years of keeping heavy secrets from everyone they know, having to contemplate the possibility of failing to save their loved ones, in some cases actually causing the death of those loved ones, and killing countless enemies (and enjoying it sometimes), the surviving Animorphs come out of the war struggling to find an identity that doesn't revolve around being a child soldier.
-   **Anne of Green Gables.** She grows the most in the first book, and the last book is a Coming Of Age of her youngest daughter, Rilla.

    -   In **Voices**, Memer grows up hating the Alds for their brutal occupation of her city, but slowly comes to realize that simple revenge won't help, and they're really not that different.

Love Interest Ce'Nedra is also forced to grow up, maturing from spoiled princess to responsible queen.

You're The Chosen One of Altana Herself, charged with going back in time and putting an end to the Crystal War to stop the Goddess's sorrow.

-   In **Mass Effect 2** this is Grunt's loyalty mission. As a young member of his species, and a tank-bred clone for that matter, finding an identity is important to him. Being a Krogan, Grunt's coming-of-age ceremony relates to him learning to control his innate aggressions; on a more abstract level, he is often seeking the advice and approval of those around him, and interactions with him typically entail helping him sort out his identity and making him a valuable member of his current group.
-   **Mega Man Star Force** seems to be one of these, as the main character (Geo) starts out by shutting out the world in the first game, then grows up through the second game, so that by the third he is able to step up and take charge of the gang when Luna Platz has been datafied.

-   Some **Pokémon** games play with this. Ostensibly, a meek kid from a town in the middle of nowhere becomes powerful and confident, growing more mature over their journey and becoming a battle protégé. The first installment in the series even refers to the protagonists journey as this. From the player's perspective, the Player Character, who is largely featureless, is mostly a receptacle for other characters to speak into, with your rival(s) receiving the actual character development; the player is left to imagine the player character's maturation for himself.
-   No matter what choices you make in **Stray Gods**, Grace comes into her own after beginning as a washed-up musician.
-   **Tales of the Abyss** for Luke. He starts out as a self-centered, sheltered brat, goes through phases of Jerkass, Heroic BSoD, The Atoner and various identity complexes, and ends up declaring his independence from the quasi-father-figure Big Bad and saving the world. Yay!
    -   **Tales of Graces** is also **technically** a coming of age story, due to the prologue-maingame-future arc structure, but the development is spread across five characters — Asbel, Cheria, Hubert, Richard **and** Sophie — so it ends up a little less focused.
    -   "Tales of Vesperia" acts as a moral coming-of-age for all its characters as well.
-   The entirety of **The Walking Dead** can be seen as one for Clementine.

She's more capable than before, but still requires help from adults around her, despite being Wise Beyond Their Years. At the end of the season, she becomes fully responsible for someone else for the first time: she starts taking care of AJ, the newborn son of a deceased couple who used to be members of her group. Come the third season, and Clementine is now a 13-year old cynical gunslinger, fully capable of living and surviving on her own. After constant disapointments from other people, Clem decided that she prefers to live by herself. As the season progresses, she befriends Javier and his family, convincing her that living as a loner won't get her anywhere. Finally, in the final season, Clem is now a mature 16-year-old, who becomes a leader of an entire community of teens and kids, is tasked with teaching AJ morality and living in a group.
-   The entirety of **The World Ends with You** is this for Neku Sakuraba, detailing him growing out of his Jerkass personality and childish preconceptions of others into becoming a much more mature person who learns to let other people into his life and to embrace the individual values of them. This also extends to his partners as well, who each learn to accept their flaws and make better strides towards becoming better people.

The story is very much about him learning about the world beyond the safety of his home and him truly becoming an adult as he faces trials. He's still prone to outbursts and high emotions and has to learn to regulate himself.
-   Invoked in **Homestuck**. The game Sburb is designed to force its players to grow as people, and the protagonists are playing it together. Some characters are challenged to face their fears (Tavros, Eridan, Dave); others are...encouraged to overcome insecurities or flaws (Vriska, Kanaya, Nepeta).
-   **Outsiders** is a lesbian drama that follows Siobhan Pattinson and Ebony Larsson's progression from idealistic teenage girls to hard working women with careers.
-   **Stand Still, Stay Silent**: This is happening to all four younger members of the crew. Emil starts out as New Meat, Reynir as a Sheltered Aristocrat and the Hotakainens, while no strangers to the hardships of the real world by comparision to them, are still going against their guardian's wishes for the first time by joining the expedition.

Coming of Age Story Example in Western Animation

-   **Avatar: The Last Airbender**: The Character Development of Sokka, Katara, and especially Avatar Aang and Prince Zuko involves a lot of this.
-   **Ben 10: Alien Force**: The first two seasons are about Ben Tennyson and Gwen (and Kevin) becoming more accomplished superheroes with 5 more years of experience under their belts. For Ben especially, he does his best to fill the shoes that Grandpa Max left behind, first when the latter disappeared, and the second when the latter was exiled to the Null Void.
-   **Gargoyles** has a rather subtle story arc featuring Brooklyn changing from a wild-hearted hipster into an effective second-in-command and a brilliant tactician, yet a romantically frustrated character. The episode **Kingdom** highlights this.
-   **Gravity Falls** is this for Polar Opposite Twins Dipper Pines and Mabel Pines. It's most obvious near the end of the series, when their 13th birthday becomes a major plot point — Dipper is rushing to grow up, Mabel comes to fear it, but both make peace with the issue by the end.
-   **Infinity Train**: In many ways, the show acts as a Deconstruction of adventure stories where kids travel to a magical world and overcome their problems, ala **Labyrinth** or **The Pagemaster**. The train defies the Year Inside, Hour Outside and All Just a Dream tropes that usually accompany these stories, the magical and quirky companions that become loyal friends to our heroes are created solely to be avenues for their character development, regardless of the lives they live outside of that, and refusing to accept any sort of growth means you're trapped for years, maybe even decades, until you do.
-   **The Loud House**: By Season 5, everyone is a year older. In this case, Lincoln Loud goes to middle school, Lori goes to college, and Lily is in preschool. This era starts in the Season 5 premiere, Schooled!.
-   **The Magic Pudding**: Bunyip's adventure begins literally on the day he comes of age.
-   **My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic** has "The Cutie Mark Chronicles", which shows how the Mane Six discovered their own special talents and earned their cutie marks, which fans agree is definitely not a metaphor for adolescence.
-   **Over the Garden Wall** has a lot of elements of a coming-of-age story for Wirt, especially when it comes to him confronting his problems instead of running from them or giving up. He finds himself in an unfamiliar place, has his identity questioned, makes new friends, suffers tragedy and nearly gives up in the face of it, and learns to fulfill his responsibilities to his family.
-   In **Peppermint Rose** Rose learns through her journey to put others' needs before her wants, and grows into the caretaker of the magical world.
-   Parodied in **The Powerpuff Girls (2016)** episode "Horn Sweet Horn". It features a pony who wants to be a unicorn. Near the end his mother arrives with a gang of unicorns and informs him she needs to tell him something, but she needed to wait until he was old enough and had gone on "an intense journey of adolescent self discovery". His mother reveals that she's a unicorn, and then pulls back his mane to show that he had a horn the entire time but didn't notice it due to having Messy Hair.
-   **South Park**:
    -   The show has been toying with these in later seasons. "You're Getting Old" and "Assburgers" plays this mostly straight for Stan; "1%" flips this trope around in its handling of Cartman.
-   **Star Wars: The Clone Wars** has Ahsoka, who grows from snippy and aggressive to open-minded and wise.
-   **Star Wars Rebels** has **Ezra Bridger** and **Sabine Wren**, as a Deconstruction of the Kid Hero genre. The former having been alone for years and finds himself becoming surrounded by both good and bad people, while the latter has already been caught between all sorts of people and **wants** to be alone. Both believe they have seen the worse of the Galaxy, unaware of the burdens that come with becoming leaders and soldiers in a fight where everything seems to be against them. As Word of Saint Paul puts it for Sabine, she is a character that 'must sacrifice who she is now for who she must become'.
-   **Steven Universe** has Steven Quartz Universe, who grows from a Tagalong Kid to becoming an equal member of the Gems, while also fulfilling the same role his mother had in protecting the Earth.
-   **Thundercats 1985** is all about Lion-O growing up to be a worthy Lord of the Thundercats. Made interesting because in the beginning of the series his age suspension capsule malfunctioned, leaving him mentally a child in a buff adult body. The entire series shows his mental age catching up to his physical age.

Coming of Age Story Example in Anime & Manga

-   **I Want Your Mother To Be With Me!** is an unusual example, as only Ryo truly comes of age, learning what it means to be an adult. Yuzuki is already a mature parent, and Asahi and Haruka are young children. All of them have Character Development though. Ryo starts the series as a self-centered loser, but becomes more helpful and caring towards Yuzuki, Asahi, and Haruka. His parents give him some good advice about how maturity is learning to accept support from others, and don't fault him for moving back in with them.
    
    **Mr. Ishizuka:** It's because you're an adult that you should rely on us. A person faces more hardships the moment they become one. They'll need someone they can depend on.
    
-   **Neighborhood Story**, like many Shōjo manga. Only, since it's Ai Yazawa, the characters' motivations for maturing and growing are mainly their dreams and aspirations of becoming graphic artists and fashion designers.

Coming of Age Story Example in Comic Books

-   **Scott Pilgrim** has this with the titular character Scott Pilgrim. Having lived more or less the same, his life becomes more dangerous and everything is shaken up when he meets Love Interest Ramona. While fighting her Evil Exes, he (along with Ramona herself) end up recognizing their faults and troubles and learning how to overcome them. Scott's friends also have this a lesser extent (Kim overcoming the tension between her and Scott since high school, Steven coming out of the closet, Knives becoming a young woman and so on.) Notable in that everyone hasn't finished growing, but they're on the right track.
-   **Y: The Last Man** features a reasonably realistic delayed coming of age story amongst the Gendercide, war, cloning, cultists and conspiracies going on all over the place.

Coming of Age Story Example in Films — Animation

-   Simba of **The Lion King (1994)** becomes convinced by Timon and Pumbaa to live a carefree hedonistic lifestyle that carries on well into adulthood, avoiding his past and his responsibilities as the future king. Only after Rafiki gives him a rather creative lesson on facing his past does he decide to grow up and go back to reclaim his rightful throne.

Coming of Age Story Example in Films — Live-Action

-   **The 40-Year-Old Virgin**. It's in the title — the question is rather who the truly mature person is: Andy or his partying friends?
-   **Black Swan** Nina is close to 30, still lives with her mother and is quite sexually naive. This makes her perfect to play The Ingenue White Swan in the production of **Swan Lake**. But she must embrace her sexuality and grow up to be able to play the Femme Fatale Black Swan.
-   In **A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!**, Timmy has decided to keep acting like a child well into his twenties so he doesn't have to be separated from his fairy godparents. When he falls in love with Tootie, he ultimately has to choose between staying a Manchild or growing up so he can be with her. In the end, he grows up but Jorgen allows him to keep his fairy godparents anyway since he loved them so much, as long as he no longer uses them for selfish wishes.
-   **Failure to Launch**. Doubly subverted. Tripp is presented to the audience as a 35-year-old who has failed to transition into adulthood, as are all his overgrown-child friends. By the end of the movie, however, we find that Tripp's apparently juvenile behavior is not "failure to launch" but because his fiancee died and his friends' situations are also not as they seem.
-   The film version of **Fight Club** is essentially this, in contrast with the Downer Ending of the book.
-   **The Fly (1986)** is about Seth Brundle, a thirtysomething quantum physicist who, due to an astonishing intellect that is implied to have manifested at least as early as his teens (he was shortlisted for the Nobel Prize in Physics at 20) and a Workaholic attitude, has been toiling away in seclusion on a teleportation machine for at least six years and by his own admission has no life beyond his work. His awkward attempt to flirt with a beautiful science journalist as the film begins turns out to be the first step in crossing the threshold of maturity; they become lovers and his new understanding of "the flesh" allows him to finally perfect the machine. But he has trouble handling his awakened passions; a misunderstanding involving her editor/ex-lover drives him to drunkenness and he teleports himself, unaware that a housefly is in the telepod with him. In the days that follow, he becomes stronger, more energetic, and **much** more virile, but also emotionally unstable and violent — having been genetically fused with the fly, he is undergoing a Slow Transformation into a monster. Even as his better self re-emerges, he must face the human inevitabilities of decay and death in a way no other human ever has, and eventually becomes **desperate** to hold them back.
-   **Frances Ha** features a 27-year-old aspiring (and underemployed) dancer whose life is on autopilot, with her both revisiting her youth and trying to find greater certainty in her future. By the end of the film, her life seems to be on something resembling the right path, but she still has trouble wholly adapting to the adult world.

-   **Gran Torino**: Walter Kowalsky, even when he is a senior who has raised a family, still lives emotionally as the young soldier that crossed the Moral Event Horizon at the Korean War. He must acknowledge he is a Grumpy Old Man Jaded Washout Cranky Neighbor Racist Grandpa who has alienated his own family and now that his wife has died is completely alone, so he can be a real Papa Wolf.
-   **A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints** constantly flashes back to the protagonist's life as a teenager, but his actual coming of age doesn't happen until he's in his thirties and finally revisits the father he ran away from.
-   **High and Tight** features an early twenties boy who has never done anything with his life trying to join the army.
-   The **Iron Man** movie is basically about Tony Stark going from an extremely rich manchild to an extremely rich man. By building a robot suit and fighting crime.

-   **Kicking & Screaming** by Noah Baumbach is about a group of recent college graduates who completely **refuse** to move on with their lives.
-   **Labyrinth** has a 16-year-old girl at the start of the movie throwing tantrums like a 12-year-old. It takes having to use her brain a bit and making some genuinely tough choices in order for her to appreciate what she has. Plus meeting David Bowie, that probably help the old hormones.

-   **Sirens** has this happening to a repressed Edwardian housewife as she visits real-life artist Norman Lindsey, and meets his free-spirited models. The models engage in a Corrupt the Cutie with her and a maid in the household — but it's shown as a sign of positive character growth.

-   **The Third Man**: Holly Martins is something of a Manchild: the books he makes a living writing are Escapist westerns with Black-and-White Morality. His naive search for justice in the death of his best friend Harry Lime forces him to come to terms with a World Half Empty.
-   **The Waterboy** is about Bobby Boucher, a 31-year-old waterboy who still lives with his mother and has done nothing with his life (thanks in no small part to said mother brainwashing and coddling him). After finally learning to stand up for himself, he ends up getting a college scholarship, becoming the star linebacker of the football team and at the end of the movie, getting married to his girlfriend Vicki Vallencourt.
-   **The World's End** is about five men reuniting to finish a pub crawl they never managed to finish when they were young adults. Four of them have moved on... Gary King hasn't. He's still wearing the same old clothes, driving the same car and talking the same old crap. Luckily the events of the film force him to grow up a bit and starting taking responsibility for his shortcomings. Well, MOST of his shortcomings.

Coming of Age Story Example in Live-Action TV

-   The characters of **The Big Bang Theory** are all in their thirties, but initially were fairly immature, despite being accomplished scientists. Over the course of the series they have slowly been transitioning to adulthood. The two standout exampels are Howard, who started out as a Casanova Wannabe living with his mother, and is now married with a child of his own, and Sheldon, who, over the course of the show, fell in love for the first time, lost his virginity, slowly began developing empathy and social skills, and moved in with his girlfriend.
-   **Buffy the Vampire Slayer** is one enormous coming-of-age story (only, you know, with monsters and superpowers) for Buffy, Willow and Xander, and the run of the series is structured to follow specific stages of adolescence.
-   In the **Firefly** episode **Jaynestown**, the local magistrate, Higgins, has hired Inara to bed his timid son Fess, who is 26 and is not yet "a man". She reassures the naïve Fess that he need not be like his father, only to be himself, which will make him stronger. Afterwords, in Inara's shuttle, Fess expresses disappointment in not feeling different after losing his virginity.
    
    **Inara**: You're very quiet.  
    **Fess**: I'm sorry. I just...I just thought I'd feel... different... after. Aren't I supposed to be a man now?  
    **Inara**: A man is just a boy who's old enough to ask that question. Our time together... It's a ritual, a symbol. It means something to your father. I hope it was not entirely forgettable for you.  
    **Fess**: No, it was...  
    **Inara**: But it doesn't make you a man. You do that yourself.  
    **\[Fess ends up proving himself a man by defying his father's attempt to capture the "hero of Canton" who was traveling with Inara.\]**

Coming of Age Story Example in Western Animation

-   **Star Wars Rebels** has Kanan, who experienced Order 66 when he just began his Padawan training and deployment into the Clone Wars, and because of that, he never grew past the thinking process of a teenager until the events of the show. His defining trait is focus, but this also means that he cannot multitask without worrying that the task he is currently on will never work, leading him to become oblivious to others' opinions or more practical methods, like becoming unaware of Hera's worry when he has to leave for Malachor soon, or his Determinator behavior to keep Ezra under control and safe rather than putting faith in him. It usually takes for someone to tell him about taking the obvious solution for him to snap out of it.
