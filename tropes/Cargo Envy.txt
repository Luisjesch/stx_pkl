Cargo Envy: 
_"See how she leans her cheek upon her hand._

_O that I were a glove upon that hand,_

_That I might touch that cheek."_

It never fails; show a sexy woman touching a particular object (especially if she's hugging it, sitting on it, or has it in her mouth), and somebody will say "Boy, I wish I were a \[object\]." Sometimes may lead to the envious person having enmity/rivalry with said object.

See also Cargo Ship, when the audience imagines a Crack Pairing along similar lines.
