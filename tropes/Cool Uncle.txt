Cool Uncle: 
_"That seems like the kinda thing a responsible parent wouldn't want you doing... Good thing I'm an uncle! Avenge me, kids! AVEEEEEEENGE MEEEEEE!!!"_

Lots of families have that one uncle that gets on great with all the kids. Most often, he's a youngish bachelor with no children of his own and has no intention of settling down any time soon, though he may be romantically involved. He may travel a lot and wow the kids with stories of meeting celebrities and traveling the world (and if so, he _always_ brings back the coolest souvenirs, which he naturally gives away as presents), and he's much more free-spirited than the kids' straitlaced parents.

Regardless, he will often be secretly envious of the stability and loving home life that his sibling enjoys with their spouse and kids, even as he boasts of his own independence. The uncle may be the Black Sheep of the family. Often he's the kids' godfather as well; if they ever lose their parents, he'll be the one who steps in to become a Parental Substitute. This can lead to character development if he has to tone down his lifestyle and become a responsible guardian for the kids' sake. But if only _his_ sibling dies, his surviving in-law may feel obligated to keep him in the kids' lives, even if he and the in-law clash.

This trope is usually male, but the role will occasionally be taken on by an aunt.

Contrast Evil Uncle (although there can be overlap) and Creepy Uncle.

Cool Uncle Example in Anime & Manga

-   In **Another**, Kouichi has a close relationship with his aunt Reiko (his mother's much younger sister), who serves as his guardian while he's in Yomiyama, as well as his homeroom teacher. She looks after him, gives him advice on matters such as whether to pursue a career in art and generally is the person he's closest to in his family. By the time he realizes that she's the "nonexistent person" and has to be killed in order to end the calamity, he realizes that he's come to think of her as being like his mother.
-   **Bakuman。**: Nobuhiro Mashiro, also known under his pen name Taro Kawaguchi, was this to his nephew Moritaka Mashiro. Mashiro admired his uncle's work when he was a little child and the series shows several times that other characters are fans of his work. However, Nobuhiro's death not only hit Mashiro hard, the young Mashiro believed that his uncle committed suicide due to his current lack of success rather than being killed by overworking, which causes Mashiro to lose faith in becoming a mangaka. Years later, after deciding to become a mangaka with his partner Takagi and learning how much work is needed to make manga in practice makes him realize the truth of his uncle's death and he regains his full respect for Taro Kawaguchi.
-   **Dragon Ball**:
    
    -   Goten is very playful and caring to Pan his niece as seen by the Ubb Distant Finale, **Dragon Ball GT** and **Dragon Ball Super**. Helped by the fact he isn’t actually that much older than her.
    -   17 is this for Marron in **Dragon Ball Super**. In **Dragon Ball GT** not so much, though granted he was Brainwashed and Crazy there.
    -   **Dragon Ball Heroes** reveals Cooler is this for Kuriza (Frieza’s son) to extent he’s is willingly to help his nephew out in a fight.
    
    **Cooler**: Although I'm MORE than enough to crush these pathetic lice... fine. Don't say Uncle Cooler never gave you anything!
    
-   In **The Guy She Was Interested in Wasn't a Guy At All**, Mitsuki Koga works as a clerk in her uncle's record store. He dotes on his niece and takes her out to buy a guitar when he notices that she's feeling depressed.
-   In **Innocent** Nicolas-Charles-Gabriel is this very kind to his eldest nephew Charles. Downplayed, since he's also an intrigant who tries to "steal" his nephew's position as executioner of Paris but fails due to being traumatized by Damien's horrific execution.
-   **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure**: Played with for Jotaro Kujo to Josuke Higashikate. He's technically Josuke's nephew since the latter is his grandfather's son, but their interaction involved Jotaro as the admired older relative mentoring the much less-experienced Josuke.
-   Main character Yuuta Segawa of **Listen to me, girls. I am your father!**, whom all three of his nieces admire (one of the girls even has a crush on him), especially when he adopts them.
-   **Naruto**:
    -   Hiashi Hyuga may count to Neji, who's his younger twin brother Hizashi's son. He starts out as a stern and distant authority figure whom Neji loathes due to his belief that Hiashi let Hizashi die in his place. However, after Neji learns the truth, he forgives Hiashi, who often trains him.
    -   Yashamaru was this to Gaara. His assault on Gaara was ordered by Gaara's father to test his son. Yashamaru really loved him.
    -   Tsunade is Naruto’s great aunt and is consistently the sole caring mother figure in his life, though the fact they’re related somehow never once comes up between them.
    -   Hanabi is this to her older sister Hinata's children Boruto and Himawari in the Sequel Series, **Boruto**, though her clinginess and Genki Girl personality can annoy Boruto.
-   Genjuuro Kazanari from **Symphogear** is Tsubasa's uncle and leader of the 2nd Division Mobile Disaster Response Corps. He's a Badass Normal who **punches** a BFS and **breaks** it. Season 3 revealed he isn't Tsubasa's uncle but her half-brother. Doesn't stop him from being any less cool.
-   Kittan from **Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann** provides an awesome example towards his sister Kiyoh’s infant daughter, taking on a Mugann armed with nothing but a shotgun to protect her.
    
    "I'm not about to let my cute little niece die in some alleyway! Go on without me, Dayakka! Look after Kiyoh for me.... GO!! IT'S ABOUT TO OPEN FIRE!"

Cool Uncle Example in Comic Books

-   **Disney Ducks Comic Universe**: Donald Duck to Huey, Dewey, and Louie (when they're not pestering him), and his own adventurous wealthy uncle Scrooge McDuck, who is also considered an "unca" by the triplets.
    -   And Professor Ludwig von Drake, Donald's other uncle, an Omnidisciplinary Scientist who is also quite the Absent-Minded Professor.
-   **Fantastic Four**:
    -   Reed and Sue's children consider Johnny to be a cool uncle since he's a superhero that sets himself on fire. Ben also gets this treatment, although he's not a blood relative. Johnny is even willingly to give his life for them.
    -   Doctor Doom of all people is considered to be this by Valeria Richards since he is basically the relative that spoils her the most. That, and he indulges her Token Evil Teammate tendencies. You'd think that'd be something he'd try to hide, to save face (er, mask), but no, he has placed her under his royal protection, and allows her to call him "Uncle Doom".
-   **The Flash**:
    -   The first Kid Flash and third Flash Wally West pretty much worships his uncle (and mentor) Barry Allen, the second Flash. At least after he found out Barry was the Flash; when his aunt Iris introduced Wally to her then-boyfriend Barry Allen, he thought Barry was a loser and asked the Flash why Iris didn't date ''him'', rather than that loser Barry.
-   Oliver from **Invincible** as a mark of his Character Development from the brat he was prior is a caring uncle to Terra his niece.
-   **Persepolis**: Marji really liked her kindly Uncle Anoosh, who told her stories of participating in a rebellion against the Shah and his stay in the USSR. She was quite brokenhearted when the authorities executed him on suspicion of being a Soviet spy.

    -   Peter Parker's Uncle Ben was a pretty cool guy since he fought in World War II and shaped Peter into the man he is today.
    -   Aunt May though she is not related to Peter by blood is most assuredly the greatest aunt in comic history as she absolutely cherishes Peter and would do anything for him.
    -   Peter himself is considered Honorary Uncle to Harry and Liz’s son Normie and Peter does care deeply for him and willingly to do whatever it takes to prevent Gruesome Grandparent Norman from trying to get Normie to follow his Villainous Legacy.
-   **Supergirl**:
    -   In her Post-Crisis book **Supergirl** likes, trusts and relies on her cousin's adoptive parents Jonathan and Martha and her surrogate aunt Lana Lang whenever she feels she can't talk to Clark.
    -   In **Supergirl (Rebirth)** she's a kind of cool aunt to her first cousin once removed Jonathan "Superboy" Samuel Kent. He pretty much worships her.
-   **X-Men**:
    -   Alex Summers aka Havok is always shown to be a supportive uncle to Rachel and Cable despite the latter being older than him, whenever Scott and Jean are absent he feels they are his responsibility and in **Cable and X-Force** gives his nephew unofficial approval to continue with his quest to improve the future, without the Avengers hunting him. He is certainly a better uncle than Gabriel aka Vulcan who almost killed Rachel, though he got better.
    -   Quicksilver though he claims otherwise does actually love his nephews Tommy and Billy very much, particularly Tommy who inherited his Super-Speed. He is very willing to come to aid in **Young Avengers**.
    -   Surprisingly Cain Marko aka Juggernaut is this for David Haller aka Legion (son of his stepbrother Charles) as shown in **Legion of X**. They get along remarkably well with David affectionately calling him “Uncle Cain”.

-   It doesn't take long after their first meeting for Eda to establish herself as this to her nephew, Nero, in **The Silver Raven**, with him being able to better open up to her about his problems and her providing a much needed outlet. She even kicks ass alongside him against Mega Scarecrows in Chapter 12 and they work together to face off against Echidna in Chapter 13.
-   The **Dragon Age** fic series **Skyhold Academy Yearbook** plays with the trope by assigning several uncles to Skye Rutherford, all of whom think they are the Cool Uncle. They have an "uncle-off" in one installment, by which they try to determine which of the six is her favorite; one of her mother's brothers is absent, so he can't participate, and honorary uncle Varric (the "whiskey uncle") abstains, but the other four have great fun with the competition.

In the manga adaptation, his uncle also taught him how to hack computers and could outplay him at basketball.
-   **The Book of Joe**: Joe is a cool uncle — and his brother calls him out on it for being a little too cool/a bad influence.

-   **Discworld**: City ruler Lord Havelock Vetinari is the epitome of cool and cunning. But from the novel **Night Watch** onward, the character of his only living relative, the aunt alluded to in **Guards! Guards!**, is opened up a little: it is hinted that Vetinari learned a lot of his skills from Auntie Bobbie (Lady Roberta de Meserole), who is a political manipulator, a Seamstress where she needs to be, possibly one of only a handful of female Assassins, and a lady of guile, insight, cunning, and wisdom.

A second wise woman in Havelock Vetinari's life, an aunt-like character, has been the vampire Lady Margolotta (although some interpretations hint at a sexual relationship).
-   **Dive (2003)**: Adrianna and her brother spend most summers with their archaeologist uncle, who has imparted a lot of knowledge to them, while their parents constantly neglect them.

-   **Eight Cousins**: Uncle Alec is this for Rose and the boys.

-   **Harry Potter**:
    -   Sirius Black and Remus Lupin, neither of whom were actually related but who nevertheless filled the role in Harry's life.

-   **Of Fire and Stars**: Casmiel, called Cas, is Thandi and Mare's paternal uncle, along with advising their father (his brother) who's the king. He's far more laidback and reasonable by far than their father. Mare in particular is much closer to him, as he tolerates her rebellious behaviors, as he realizes they can be useful (e.g. intelligence is brought back from her ventures into the city).
-   **The Pendragon Adventure**: Uncle Press will show up at Bobby's doorstep and take him on some cool outing, like a helicopter ride, or tell him about his adventures in some exotic locale.

    -   Theon remembers his uncle Aeron being this way in his youth, but upon his return home finds that Aeron has discovered religion sometime in the last ten years and becomes considerably less fun than the rowdy, drunken womanizer he remembers.
    -   Theon's sister Asha considers her maternal uncle Rodrick "the Reader" Harlaw this, though unconventionally; he rarely leaves his home and the gifts he brings back are books, advice, and political support. Of course, the field of competition is not strong; her paternal uncles consist of a dim-witted brute, the aforementioned sour religious fanatic, and an Ax-Crazy schemer.
    -   There's also Catelyn Stark's uncle Brynden Tully, who is **definitely** this trope with regards to her and her siblings, Lysa and Edmure.
    -   Eddard Stark's younger brother Benjen Stark (who is First Ranger in the Night's Watch) is a Cool Uncle to Ned's kids, especially to Ned's illegitimate son Jon Snow, who adores his uncle and has wanted to join the Night's Watch his entire life like his uncle. Like their brother Jon, Arya and Sansa also idealize the Watch based on their uncle, and Benjen is held in high esteem by his other nephews Robb, Bran, and Rickon as well. While Benjen loves all his nephews and nieces, he seems to have an additional soft spot for his nephew Jon.
    -   Averted with Edmure Tully, who — despite having all the personality traits of a Cool Uncle — only actually meets one of his nephews and none of his nieces; and even then, since a war is going on, he doesn't have much chance to be one.
-   In the Sanson Mémoires, which I count as literature due to the heavy fictionalization, Henri Sanson has loads of them simply due to the fact his grandfather had ten children and it is frequently mentioned that he gets invited by them for dinner.
-   **Summers at Castle Auburn**: Jaxon Halsing. He travels widely, lives an exciting life, showers his nieces with gifts, and is pretty determined to live and die single, but there are hints he isn't as happy as he appears.
-   **Swallows and Amazons**: Nancy and Peggy's Uncle Jim, also known as "Captain Flint". He lives on a houseboat, owns a Pirate Parrot, and has traveled all over. A great part of the first book revolves around his nieces starting a private war with him, since he's taken up writing and become distant, therefore, in their minds, ceasing to be cool.
-   **Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina**: Greedo's uncle Nok teaches hunting to his nephews and pilots the starship when they narrowly escape from the hired killers who find their refuge.
-   **Theatre Shoes**: Mose and Lindsey Cohen are both very kind and helpful to their nieces and nephew, Sorrel, Mark, and Holly Forbes. Mose Cohen is a famous comedian, adding to his coolness.
-   **Tolkien's Legendarium**:
    
    -   Bilbo the titular hero of **The Hobbit** is utterly idolised by his Took nephews and nieces such as Pippin much to the irritation of the stuffier Hobbits. But it is Bilbo’s cousin Frodo the protagonist of **The Lord of the Rings** whom he adopted that cherishes the old Hobbit the most.
    -   Thorin was this to Fili and Kili his two nephews and the youngest Dwarves in the party. Thorin deeply cared for his “sister sons” and they in turn refused to leave his side in the Battle of Five Armies though it cost them their lives defending him.
    -   Théoden is a truly epic and heartwarming example towards his nephew Éomer and especially his niece Éowyn both of whom he loves as dearly as his own children after losing his only son Théodred.

Just see Théoden‘s quote to Aragorn while watching Éowyn bond with Gimli in the extended edition of **The Two Towers**.
    
    I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time. She was a girl when they brought her father back dead. Cut down by Orcs. She watched her mother succumb to grief. Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear. Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.

-   **Village Tales**: Has lots of these.

-   **The Barrier**: Marta has cool relatives on both sides. Her her paternal uncle Álex acts more like an older brother to her at times, providing fake a voiceover for the news or tickling her out of nowhere to amuse her.

-   **Bob Hearts Abishola**: When Bob officially gets engaged to Abishola, his siblings Douglas and Christina discuss this trope, both quite excited to become the fun, chill uncle and aunt to Bob's stepson-to-be, Dele. They're both self-aware enough to realize they're too reckless and irresponsible to be parents, and this is much more their speed. Even before the couple ties the knot, Douglas and Christina are quite lenient towards Dele when he's at their house; Abishola won't let him play video games or eat junk food at home, but the way they see it, what she doesn't know won't hurt her.

-   **Everybody Loves Raymond**: In one episode, Raymond laments the fact that Robert is always willing and able to play with Raymond's kids when he comes over, never seeming to be too busy or too tired to do so. When Robert discovers this, he explains that **he's** only able to do it because he only ever sees the kids for an hour or so at most. Raymond, meanwhile, cares for his children effectively **all the time**, and shouldn't be ashamed that he lacks the energy to "Play Monster" with them all day.
-   **Family Ties**: Had Uncle Ned, played by Tom Hanks. He was really cool, but he had a drinking problem.
-   **The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air**: Zig-zagged with Uncle Phil, even though Will is actually blood-related to Philip's wife Vivian. He and Will get on each other's nerves occasionally and he is not the typical easygoing uncle, but at the end of the day, he's awesome and Will learned to respect him as a true father figure. Ironically, in the early episodes Vivian was much more of a Cool Aunt, but by the end of the show Will is closer to Uncle Phil.

-   **Game of Thrones**:

    -   Zigzagged by Tyrion, who is very friendly to Tommen and Myrcella, but is not adverse to slapping and insulting (a very deserving) Joffrey when the situation calls for it. While he sends his niece Myrcella to Dorne for political reasons, he also does it in an attempt to ensure her safety from the dangers in King's Landing. He even admits to Cersei that Tommen and Myrcella's deaths broke his heart because he honestly loved them.
    -   Brynden Tully acts this way with Catelyn, but treats her brother Edmure rather poorly, bullying him with phrases like "The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth."

-   **Good Eats**: Alton mentions that his parents would go off on romantic getaways and leave him and his (TV) sister Martha in the care of their Uncle Rudy back in The '70s. Rudy lived a bohemian lifestyle out of a van and was fond of kabobs, despite lacking cooking skills.

-   **Heroes**: Peter Petrelli, though his interaction with his nephews is limited, his niece Claire definitely looks up to him.
-   **Kirby Buckets**: Has an uncle named Leon who is always willing to do "solids" for other people. At first, Leon's solids seemed to work out great for Kirby, as he got him new subscribers for his web channel, a gourmet crab lunch, a girlfriend, a basketball session with NBA superstar Zach LaVine, new sneakers and a car. Unfortunately, Leon's gifts eventually backfired, as they were all either cheap knockoffs (the sneakers, the crab lunch, the subscribers — actually inflated by a bot) or outright stolen (the car). It later turned out that he did all of it on purpose because Kirby's mother specifically told him not to contact him. Needless to say, Kirby was amazed his mother was able to come up with such an elaborate scheme.
-   **The Law According to Lidia Poët**: Lidia encourages her niece Marianna to be more independent like her and aids her to follow her wishes, even when it goes against what Marianna's parents want.
-   **Leave It to Beaver**: Beaver and Wally's way cool, sorta whack Uncle Billy. Just don't take him for granted; he hates that.

-   **Psych**: Shawn Spencer had his treasure hunting Uncle Jack.
-   **Snowfall**: Played with. In the first season, it looks like Jerome fits this role for Franklin, as he helps Franklin gather the manpower and firepower needed to establish his business.

-   **Two and a Half Men**: Uncle Charlie.
-   **WandaVision**: Invoked when Wanda's brother Pietro seemingly comes back from the dead and moves into the family house. Billy and Tommy instantly take a liking to "Uncle Pete," especially Tommy (who inherits his speed powers). When Wanda starts to question him, he admits he's pretty much there to give her and Vision grief while bonding with the kids, as part of TV suburbia style life Wanda's living. Then it turns out he was an imposter bewitched by Agatha Harkness to spy on Wanda.

According to Buffett, this all actually happened back when he was 17.
    
    **Billy pulled in in a Jaguar  
    Red convertible '65  
    Headed home to Mississippi, he'd been around the world  
    That black sheep uncle of mine  
    His ship had come in, he was looking to sin  
    Singing his own song  
    When he yelled from the drive, my heart came alive  
    "Jimmy boy come along!"**

    -   Based on the group dynamics in **Dragon Age II**, if Varric is the Team Mom and Aveline is the Team Dad, that would make Hawke fill this role. S/he's the one person everyone is willing to go to and is more or less on good terms with everyone.

Canas has this kind of relationship with Nino, teaching her how to read and write after she says she never learned how to, which tracks with the reveal that he is, in fact, her uncle.
-   Amusingly, the De Santa kids from **Grand Theft Auto V** see Trevor like this, calling him "Uncle T" and Tracey even hugging him when he shows up at Michael's house. While he is legitimately fond of them, he's also aware that they're little more than Spoiled Brats and is prone to giving them horrible advice (such as telling Jimmy to give up smoking weed and switch to meth).
-   Uncle Brent, in the third installment of the **Hero of the Kingdom** series, is clearly seen this way by his nephew, the Player Character, whom he raised.

-   Judas to Kyle in **Tales of Destiny 2** even if Kyle doesn't know they're related. His nephew immediately takes a liking to him and trusts him after they've known each other for probably an hour, and Judas becomes his Cynical Mentor (though he gradually loses the cynicism).
-   Happens in **Tales of Berseria**, although which two characters are involved are a bit of a spoiler. It turns out that Laphicet the malak is the reincarnation of Artorius and Celica's unborn child, making Velvet his Cool Aunt.

-   Lee and Lars in **Tekken** care greatly for Jin their nephew to the extent they are willing to go out on a limb to rescue him despite the horror he has inflicted on the world.

Cool Uncle Example in Visual Novels

-   Subverted with Morgan’s uncle, Tommy, in **Double Homework**. Although he’s a former rock star with lots of tattoos, he wasn’t very keen on raising a child, and he does his best to direct Morgan in a fairly traditional way to the straight and narrow. The exceptions, meanwhile, are his frequent cursing and his lame, inappropriate jokes regarding the name of his old band (“The Tits”).
-   Amy from **Melody** is a cool aunt to the title character. She acts as a parental figure and confidant for Melody. Plus, she’s only 11 years older than her niece is. Lampshaded in that the ending where the protagonist ends up with Amy is called the “Cool Aunt Ending.”

However, he's also an exceptionally talented hunter, having saved the girls once when they were little and Yang got them lost in the forest, and he was the one who taught Ruby how to wield a scythe (the most dangerous Huntsman weapon, something that's implied to be against school policy). Whenever he's around he dotes on the girls, playing video games with them and telling them stories about his adventures and missions, and the girls absolutely adore him. The only reason he's not around more is that he's busy with his work and because his Semblance is an always-on bad luck power and he doesn't want to risk hurting his nieces with it.
-   **Tanabata Manga**: Natsu's aunt is one of the family members that Natsu looked up to, they later work together to expose Natsu's mother and sister Rie to their extended families for mistreating Natsu.

Cool Uncle Example in Webcomics

Rayne actually acknowledges this.
-   Theo's uncle from **The Noordegraaf Files** taught him to Sword Fight. Kinda.
-   Subverted with crazy uncle Duncan in **The Perry Bible Fellowship** here.
-   Stomp's Uncle George in **Stomp!**.

Cool Uncle Example in Western Animation

-   **Arthur**: The episode **Arthur's Perfect Christmas** introduces clumsy, but well-meaning Uncle Fred, whom both Arthur and D.W. find hilarious. After Arthur accidentally breaks the Christmas present he got for his mom, Fred saves the day by passing off his own gift to Jane (a tea set he broke last Christmas) as being from Arthur.
-   **American Dad!**: One of Roger’s many personas, a relative known as "Uncle Cappy", has shades of this. When adopting this persona for Thanksgiving dinner (as a precaution against Stan's half-brother recognizing him as an alien), Roger discreetly slips Steve a switchblade knife and a nudie magazine.
-   **Avatar: The Last Airbender**: Uncle Iroh was this to Zuko during his childhood. As a teenager, Zuko initially sees his uncle as more of a buffoon, but eventually comes around to accepting Iroh's guidance, which encourages Zuko to reject his father's philosophies and lighten up a bit. Iroh is implied to have continued this trend with his great niece, Izumi, considering that she named her own son after him.
    -   In the Sequel Series, **The Legend of Korra**, Bumi II is this for Meelo, Ikki and Jinora, much to Tenzin's annoyance. Tenzin's sister, Kya II, is also a Cool Aunt to Jinora. Iroh continues to be a mentor from the Spirit Realm, although he and Zuko don't meet.
-   **Bobby's World** has Uncle Ted, who between being a Large Ham and something of a Manchild gets along really well with the title character.
-   **Daria**: Daria's Aunt Amy (Helen's younger sister) is a Cool Aunt due to having much more in common with Daria than anyone else in her family.
-   **The Davincibles**: Leo Davinci is this to Pablo and Zoë, though he combines it with being the Cloudcuckoolander.
-   Donald Duck is one to Huey, Louie, and Dewey. He in turn has two uncles, Professor Ludwig von Drake, the Absent-Minded Professor, and Scrooge McDuck, who appeared more in the comics before **DuckTales (1987)** made him the cool granducle of the triplets when Donald had to join the Navy.
    -   Inverted in the **Duck Tales** reboot with Donald and Della's relationship to Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Donald is their uncle, but he has been taking care of them since before they hatched, so they know him as their only parent regardless of how they address him. Donald's twin sister Della is their mother, but they didn't meet her until they were eleven; and because she is still learning how to be a mother, most of her attempts to bond with her children involve fun and exciting activities more associated with a Cool Aunt.
    -   Also in the reboot, Gladstone Gander takes on this role for the triplets (while technically he's Donald's cousin and the boys' first cousin once removed, they still call him "Uncle" in an honorary sense). Louie especially idolizes him, as his easy get-something-for-nothing lifestyle is the young duck's dream. However, after the boys get a front-row seat to how self-centered he can be and how his easy life has stunted his personal growth, he loses a lot of their respect, and his subsequent appearances show the boys as much less excited to spend time with him.
-   **Gravity Falls**: Grunkle Stan is actually the children's great-uncle, but he fits this trope to a T anyway: unmarried, knows lots of cool magic tricks, and allows them to climb on the roof. Oh yeah, and he's also a wanted criminal and the shifty owner of a run-down tourist trap. Not the most responsible uncle in the world, but still a good guy. Later, we meet his brother Ford, the local Mad Scientist slash monster hunter, who takes very little time to charm the kids with his various cool inventions, particularly Dipper who idolized him because of his writings long before he knew they were related.
-   **Jackie Chan Adventures**: Despite his name, Uncle is more like Jade's **grand** uncle because he is her uncle's uncle. However **Jackie** fits the trope quite well. No matter how much Jade gripes, it's shown on multiple occasions how much more freedom Jade has with him than with her traditional parents in China, and how much she idolizes Jackie.
-   **Little Bear**: Little Bear has his Uncle Rusty, Father Bear's 'little' brother, a huge and rustic red bear who works as a logger and visits occasionally; Little Bear admires him greatly.
-   **Molly of Denali**: "Molly of the Yukon" has Uncle Cliff, Nat's little brother. Cliff is a nice guy who shares Molly's enthusiasm for fishing.
-   After going through a Heel–Face Turn and Character Development, Lilith Clawthorne from **The Owl House** settles into this role, especially to her honorary niece Luz. The episode "Elsewhere and Elsewhen" focuses on them going to an adventure to find Philip Wittebane in the distant past, with the two geeking out over their discoveries together and Lilith punching Philip in the face after they act threatening and dismissive towards Luz.
    
    **Lilith:** Let's boogie down to history town **\[does awkward dance and scats\]**.  
    **Luz:** **\[completely genuine\]** She really **is** cool aunt Lilith.
    
-   **PB&J Otter**: Aunt Nanner, who is a very cool aunt to Peanut, Baby Butter and Jelly. Around the end of the series, she gets married to Redolfo, who is rather cool in his own right. Discussed in one episode where they worry about how boring they must seem compared to all of her adventures. She assures them that coming home to be with them is precisely what she looks forward to while on those adventures.
-   **Ready Jet Go!**: Uncle Zucchini. He's a fun and friendly guy who is an intergalactic garbage-man.
-   **Rosie's Rules**: Rosie's aunt, Tía Margarita is exuberant about pretty much everything. She also owns a Mexican fusion restaurant.
-   **Scooby-Doo**: Scrappy-Doo thinks of Scooby as a Cool Uncle, despite Scooby's cowardice.
-   **The Secret Saturdays**: Doyle Blackwell, Zak's uncle from his mother's side. Zak even said in the fourth episode he might be "the coolest guy he's ever met", before knowing they were related and while he was still an enemy nonetheless.
-   **The Simpsons**:
    -   The titular family has Homer's half-brother "Uncie Herb", a wealthy entrepreneur who's fortune seems to amass and crash periodically after his first appearance.
    -   Milhouse apparently has two: In **Special Edna**, one is a military pilot who takes him and Bart riding in a Blackhawk helicopter; and his uncle Zack who took him in when Milhouse thought his parents had died at sea.
-   **Tangled: The Series**: Rapunzel's aunt Willow is an energetic, impulsive lady who Prefers Going Barefoot; a complete contrast to her sister Queen Arianna. Rapunzel bonds with her over their shared free-spirited nature. In doing this, they accidentally make Arianna feel left out on her birthday.
-   **Taz-Mania**: Taz and his siblings have an Uncle Drew, whom they adore. Maybe because he's an Expy of Bob Hope.
-   **Uncle Grandpa**: Takes this trope to a whole other level. He's a cool uncle **and** grandpa to **everyone in the world**.
-   **Young Justice**: Green Arrow may not be Artemis's biological uncle, but he takes on this role in her life when he becomes her mentor. He also held this role for Supergirl in a different series, **Justice League Unlimited**.
    -   Like their comic book counterparts, The Flash is an uncle by marriage to Kid Flash. Unlike comics though, his Parental Substitute role has been downplayed due to Wally's own family being already functional.

Cool Uncle Example in Real Life

-   King William IV was this to his niece, the future Queen Victoria, and rather infamous for being a casual man. He was blistering to Victoria's emotionally abusive mother and made sure to live until Victoria was 18 to ensure that Victoria's distant and controlling mother and advisors couldn't become a Regent for Life for her.
-   In queer culture, a "guncle" (gay uncle) is a gay man with no kids who dotes on his nieces and nephews with his worldly ways, unorthodox wisdom, and, often enough, disposable income. Stereotypically he embodies this trope to the fullest. Unfortunately, there's no widely-recognized lesbian or gender-neutral equivalent, though lesbians are generally more likely to have kids of their own.
