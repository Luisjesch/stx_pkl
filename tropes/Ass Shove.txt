Ass Shove: 
Follow

A demonstration of _both_ versions of the trope.

_"Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass for two years."_

Quite simply, this trope covers the act of putting something into or pulling something out of a character's rectum — or, alternatively, merely implying the act. Usually, this is done for comedy.

A variation of this trope is to give a character a rectal examination, an enema, a rectal laxative, or some other similar medical procedure, whereupon hilarity ensues. Often, just having the character bend over while the physician or Battleaxe Nurse snaps on a rubber glove is enough to play the joke.

In Science Fiction and Alien Abduction stories, this is usually an Anal Probing.

Sometimes paired with All Gays are Promiscuous, to demonstrate that gays chase anyone.

Also see Trouser Space, Bowel-Breaking Bricks, Orifice Invasion, Suppository Gag, and Thermometer Gag. Nose Shove can be a variation used in child-friendly works. See Mister Seahorse and Homosexual Reproduction for when the ass in question belongs to a male and the object in question is an infant.

Truth in Television, but such things are almost never as funny or as safe as they are in fiction; the rectal walls are surprisingly fragile and can be easily ruptured if a foreign object is recklessly inserted. Indeed, a number of people who got a little _too_ experimental with their exhaust pipes have suffered serious blood loss and even death from accidentally tearing these walls open. For these reasons, Don't Try This at Home.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

Subtrope of Joke of the Butt. Not to be confused with Ass Pull, which is when a plot device or explanation seems so poorly contrived as to have a rectal genesis (_although sometimes both happen to walk hand-in-hand — or rather, dance cheek-to-cheek_). Nor to be confused with Ass Kicks You, when using one's backside as an actual weapon. Or with the saying "Shove it up your ass!"

Ass Shove Example in Anime & Manga

-   **Arifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest**: When faced with a dragon attack, after getting the dragon onto the ground, Hajime rams a sizable pile bunker up the dragon's ass, revealing the dragon to be female, then tortures her by repeatedly hitting and twisting it. This awakens the dragon's masochistic side, and after he pulls it out, she gets an orgasm, then takes her human form as Tio Clarce and begs him to be her master and punish her some more.
-   **Are You Lost?**: Homare and Shion are stranded in the middle of the ocean with no drinkable water. To stave off dehydration, they are forced to give each other enemas with the sea water so that their anuses can absorb the water and not the salt.
-   **Attack on Titan**:
    -   Team Dad Reiner claims this is the other way to kill a Titan. That some of his comrades think he's serious makes it funny during an otherwise bleak situation. It gets arguably funnier when you realize that Reiner himself is a Titan.
    -   Another soldier, trying to get a Titan's attention, threatens this (the Titan's expression when it turns on him would almost suggest that it even understood).
-   **Ayakashi Triangle**: When Reo goes to fight a kappa, she uses its habit of Anal Probing humans to take their **shirikodama** against it with a fake covered in anti-ayakashi poison. A bonus comic even shows her head poking out of a bush when she's preparing herself.
-   In **Boku no Sexual Harassment**, a guy first gets **the contents of a bourbon bottle** poured up his anus and then has **a whole corncob** shoved up it as punishment for being a rapist. More specifically, for forcing Mochizuki aka the uke of the series to be his Sex Slave. **Mochizuki** is the one who, with the help of the seme Honma, came up with this "revenge". The corncob part has reached massive levels of infamy among anime fans, specially after being featured in **AMV Hell**.
-   **Cross Ange**:
    -   This happens to main heroine Ange in the first episode. She's imprisoned in a dungeon, where she's forcibly bent over and manacled to a table. She's then given a rectal cavity search so vicious that it leaves her lying in a pool of blood.
    -   Later, Ange attempts to escape captivity after having been stripped naked. She retrieves a case holding her ring and hides it either up her ass or her vagina.
-   **A Cruel God Reigns** plays the trope straight in a horrifying way when Greg uses the wooden Easter egg Valentine gave Jeremy on the latter before raping him.
-   **Date A Live**: Origami Tobiichi, because of her obsession with and desire to seduce him, once tried to get Shido Itsuka to take her temperature by sticking the thermometer up her butt, but he refused.
-   During Ninja Murasaki's fight with Goku in **Dragon Ball**, Murasaki jumps into the air and Goku positions his magic pole in such a way that when Murasaki lands, it ends up lodged up his ass. To make it even more painful, he accidentally jerks it around when he hits against a tree and Goku yanks it right out when he wants it back.
    
    **Goku:** Ahahahahahaha! Now you have a tail! Just like mine!
    
-   In Episode 26 of **Excel♡Saga**, the doctor shoves a gigantic syringe up Hyatt's butt.
-   In **Fairy Tail**, after every Bar Brawl, Max gets knocked out with a broomstick up his ass.
-   In the first chapter of **Finder Series**, Asami punishes Akihito for trailing him by shoving a film roll **up there**.
-   **Frame Arms Girls**: In episode 9, the FA Girls gather materials to try to cure Ao's illness, but end up bringing lots of useless items including live chickens, potted cacti, and a hard drive with an antivirus software installed. Ao appreciates the Materia Twins bringing a negi because it's something she could cook into a stew... until it turns out they want to shove it up her ass as per a traditional folk remedy.
-   Envy of **Fullmetal Alchemist** gets kancho'd in a big way. His reaction is so very outraged by it.
-   In **Gamaran**, there's Kashitarou, a genius teen studying both anatomy and martial arts, who also happens to be a pervert with the recurring fantasy of sticking apples or tangerines up women's asses. He offers to do this twice to the same girl, and both times he gets beaten for his trouble.
-   In the **Ginga Densetsu Weed** manga, a running gag has Sasuke shoving either a long pole or his paws into GB's butt during comic relief moments.
-   **Gintama** loves this, with Hattori and Kondo being the most frequent victims of it. They aren't always so fortunate as to be wearing pants or underwear when it happens, either.
    -   Kondo willingly subjects himself to it on one occasion when Otae suggests the aforementioned "Spring onion up the butt" remedy for his influenza. Having him do it outside while naked (in the **dead of winter**), standing on one leg and posing with two other onions was something she added in just because she knows how willing he is humiliating himself at her demand.
    -   Doman gets subjected to this from Gintoki, who hits him with a kancho multiple times while Gedomaru bends him over, and was also given the same treatment from Seimei in the past (which is a joke on the fact that his family name of Shirino literally means "butt").
    -   Gintoki spends the majority of the Excalibur arc with Kusanagi using his butt as a makeshift scabbard since he feels insecure without one. Unfortunately for Gintoki, the sword is able to resist being removed by force, even when Kagura attempts to do so with a truck and a length of rope.
-   **Girl Friends (2006)** combines this, Trouser Space, and Victoria's Secret Compartment in the third omake. First, a tiny Akko hides between Mari's breasts, but the train is so crowded that she is getting crushed. Where she moves next is heavily implied.
-   **Great Teacher Onizuka**:
    -   Onizuka hides a Treasure Map up his ass for a while before realizing what it is.
    -   The class (specifically Urumi) punishes him for trying to use them as a free work force by forcing him to wear an S&M outfit. The whip naturally goes up his ass.
-   **Gyo** plays this trope straight in the least comedic and most horrifying way possible with the victims of an airborne plague which are strapped to mechanical walkers. The disease produces gas within the infectees that is used to power the machines carrying them, which siphon the gas out with tubes going both into their mouths and literally up their asses. This is not immediately clear with the sea creatures that initially caught (or were caught **by**) the disease, but it most definitely **is** with later instances of infected humans.
-   **HEYBOT!** has Awesome Fine Screw show he's the savior by defeating a Turtle Burger this way...with his screw head, visibly in the anus, making the Turtle Burger blush.
-   **Hybrid × Heart Magias Academy Ataraxia**: When Hayuru Himekawa cosplays as a Cat Girl, it is revealed her tail is attached to a line of anal beads that are stuck up her butt. Inserting or pulling it makes her orgasm. She develops a fetish for anal sex.
-   **Himouto! Umaru-chan**: In one chapter, Taihei catches a cold from Umaru, who goes to the store to get several gross/unpleasant home remedies for him as revenge for him not pampering her when she was sick, including a leek to shove up his butt. When she gets back home and sees how much Taihei is suffering, she feels guilty and instead tries to nurse him back to health, with an Imagine Spot where she defeats the cold germs (which look like Umaru) with the leek.
-   **How Clumsy you are, Miss Ueno**: This is Ueno's fate with a small, suspiciously shaped invention of hers, when she slips and falls down, causing her to painfully land her butt on the object. She tries to hide her accident from the unknowing Tanaka (in a squeaky voice), before Yamashita looks up Ueno's skirt and determines it only got stuck in her panties.
-   **Is This A Zombie?** has a Running Gag of Ayumu getting something (usually a bamboo shaft) rammed up his ass. He actually orgasms from it.
-   In one of the **Kämpfer** OAV's, Shizuku de-brainwashes Mikoto via pulling one of these on her. It's done Thousand Years of Death style... With a cover of the Ode to Joy as backing music...
-   **Kill la Kill** has Sanageyama finishing off Takarada by shoving his bamboo sword up his opponent's ass violently and repeatedly.
-   Non-comic example: it's said explicitly that Munakata of **Medaka Box** probably has around thirty-something or **more** swords shoved in there. Yowza.
-   In an early chapter of **Moyashimon**, Tadayasu discovers one of the downsides of going to an agricultural school when he gets volunteered to give a cow a rectal examination. He just stands there with a horrified look on his face, one (thankfully gloved) arm up to the elbow in a cow's butt.
-   In a **My-HiME** sound drama between Episodes 9 and 10, when Natsuki gets sick and her fever rises despite efforts to reduce it, the group turns to a folk cure which involves shoving a spring onion up the sick person's ass, much to Natsuki's horror and Shizuru's pleasure.
-   In **My-Otome**, the same trick is used when Aoi becomes ill, although Arika initially hangs the leek around her neck. Shizuru, when she comes in, proposes the ass-shove method.
-   Akira Shiodome from **Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea** is very, **very** fond of kancho-ing people, and he hilariously demonstrates it on his own aunt Chisaki much to the exasperation of his mother Akari.
-   **Naruto**:
    -   Kakashi has his infamous scene with an unorthodox **jutsu** called **Sennen Goroshi** ("One Thousand Years of Death"), where he **shoved his fingers up Naruto's ass-crack**, and sent him **flying**. This is based on a real-life prank called **Kancho**. Naruto nearly gets revenge on Kakashi for this during **Shippuden**'s third episode, but a terrified Kakashi managed to dodge it.
    -   Naruto used it himself on Ebisu to check if the man was really unconscious or just pretending. As he didn't react, Naruto concluded he was unconscious.
    -   Naruto used it himself against Gaara. With a kunai. One of the summoned toads thinks it's absurd that Naruto wasted his time giving the giant sand monster "an enema"... and then the kunai explodes. Ouch.
    -   Lampshaded by Tenten, in the fourth chapter of the spin-off **Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth**.
        
        **Tenten:** It's just a KANCHO!!!!
        
    -   Apparently Kakashi's father used the same technique.
    -   For more on the real-life version, check the earlier articles on **Gaijin Smash**. Warning: may result in an Archive Binge.
-   **Negima! Magister Negi Magi**:
    -   A Running Gag in is Chizuru's attempts to test out a folk remedy for fevers, which involves shoving a spring onion up the sick person's ass (as if having a fever wasn't bad enough already). Kotaro and Natsumi are understandably terrified of her. Doubles as a Stealth Pun since a spring onion in Japanese is "Negi".
    -   It's no longer just a gag: Chizuru does it for real with her artifact (yes, a leek) in chapter 348! And to poor Negi himself!
    -   Ako's Artifact is a Giant Medical Syringe (the needle alone is noted to be 1.8 cm wide) that can bestow effects like boosting her allies' abilities or messing with an enemy's sense of direction. It has to be injected through the butt.
-   The male characters, such as the Sextuplets and Iyami, of **Osomatsu-san** can be a victim to having **flag poles** shoved up their asses.
-   **One-Punch Man**: Puri-Puri Prisoner is revealed to keep his cell phone up his ass. Which actually makes sense, as his fighting style consists of his muscles ripping his clothes to shreds before beating the crap out of the enemy.
-   In **Ox Tales**, Cecil the Skunk becomes a bit of a problem, so Ollie corks him.
-   In **Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt**, Brief accidentally swallows Panty and Stocking while they were shrunken. After a while, the two are near the end of his digestive tract but get stuck. Garterbelt straps Brief down and shoves his hand up Brief's butt to retrieve them, despite Brief's horror and protests. Afterward, Brief is incredibly miserable and sore.
-   A skit in episode 1 of **Please Tell Me! Galko-chan** discusses this. Galko even mentioned when she was in elementary school, a boy attempted to do this on her and broke his finger in the process. According to chapter 20, that boy is Charao.
-   In **Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl**, Croagunk has taken up Misty and Max's role as the one to take Brock away from girls (before he makes a **complete** fool of himself), by using Poison Jab, paralyzing him. It's almost **always** depicted as Brock being stabbed in the **ass**. It's still better than the alternative, where Croagunk cockblocks him.
-   **Pokémon Adventures**. A girl in Fortree is busy getting her Zigzagoon out of a tree when the branch breaks and sends them both on a messy fall—or it would have been if Sapphire didn't jump down (from a higher altitude, no less) and catch the branch with her bare hands, occupants and all. The girl notes that her Zigzagoon isn't feeling too well and needs to get it to a Pokémon Center; Sapphire saves her the trouble, produces a berry, and feeds it to the Pokémon, curing it of its affliction. Where this trope comes in is how she came to this conclusion—she **sticks her nose up its butt!**
-   Kiyoshi from **Prison School** gets a stiletto heel and later on part of a tree branch lodged on his anus. Despite bleeding profusely from his butt in both cases he takes his injury surprisingly well.
-   Another not-comedic example in **Sakura Gari**: one of Katsuragi's torture methods against Masataka included him forcibly shoving a household object up the guy's anus **right after having raped him**.
-   **Seitokai Yakuindomo**:
    -   It was briefly mentioned in that at a time Yokoshima was a student in the Ousai Academy, the aforementioned kancho was a common prank.
    -   What was in Aria's mind when the topic of "temperature tolerance" included, among others, a large enema syringe, implying she would do this... should Shino didn't clarify what was in the latter's mind.
-   One time, **Sgt. Frog** is forced to study overnight, and assorted devices are used to keep him awake. One splashes water into his face. Another drops a tin bath on his head. A third one involves a massive **Kancho** prop made of plastic and mounted under his chair... with a pretty powerful spring.
-   **Seven Mortal Sins**: When Lucifer gets hospitalized, her enemy Belial disguises herself as a nurse and subjects Lucifer to a humiliating and extremely painful suppository.
-   **Slam Dunk**: Hanamichi Sakuragi does it to Ryonan's coach, Taoka. Let's remember that Sakuragi is extremely strong, almost superhumanly so, and that he doesn't know what "holding back" means. The mere memory causes poor Taoka to jump from his seat and grab his ass... several weeks **afterward**.
-   **Super Radical Gag Family**: Minor recurring character Shonji Anagawa is very passionate with the kancho, striking his victims with his "44 Kancho" which he coined. It's an addition which this series run on toilet humor.
-   In a deleted scene from the Hot Springs Episode of **Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann**, Kamina attempts to look into the lady side of the bathhouse through the impossibly tall wall that separates both sides. While he tries to see while riding on Simon's shoulders, he asks Gimmy to "find a hole". Misunderstanding this request, Gimmy sticks his finger into Simon's "personal hole", which causes Simon to leap into the air with a scream of pain, rising high enough to get a glimpse of the other side. When Kamina finds out what he managed, he asks Gimmy to poke him as well. While this scene was among the content that wasn't included in the TV version of the episode (which replaced much of its racier content with a Clip Show), it did go on to serve as the inspiration for the "attack" Gimmy uses on various characters in the very NSFW fifth Parallels Works video.
-   **Time Stop Hero**: Kuzuno Sekai freezes time and strips Lovisa naked, only to find that she saw this coming and concealed pieces of paper with messages for him. He finds one in her cleavage, one in her vagina, and one in her butt.
-   In the second season of **The Tower of Druaga**, little kid character Ki fights soldiers and people that annoy her by employing this technique with a spoon.
-   **Why the Hell Are You Here, Teacher!?**:
    
    -   Satou is forced to give Kana a suppository when she gets a cold. Making matters worse, since he was blindfolded to let Kana keep her dignity, the first try was... “not successful.”
    
    -   The next day when Satou gets her cold, Kana returns the favor when she finds out he pretended to be sick to skip class. And she's **not** gentle about it.
-   **YuYu Hakusho**: Yusuke performs a kancho on Kuwabara before the Chapter Black arc.

Ass Shove Example in Comic Books

-   Deadpool has Hammerspace-like abilities which he once explained as "involving an awful lot of lubricant".
-   Averted in **Warlock and the Infinity Watch**. Most of the Watch keep their Infinity Gems on their foreheads, but Drax swallows his<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> and when Pip is asked where his is, he is seen walking away from the camera with the focus suspiciously close to his backside. A later issue reveals that he somehow stored it between his toes.

    **Victim 3:** Aaagh!  
    **Victim 4:** Noooo!

    **Victim 6:** Somebodeee! **Pull this churrito out of my ass!**

-   A rather nasty Ass Shove occurs in **Preacher** (and given the general nature of the series, that's **really** saying something) when Jesse is attacked by a psychotic goth punk with a sword. Though the actual act occurs off-panel, the next page shows the sword tip poking out of the man's stomach and the hilt protruding from the seat of his pants. Ouch.
    -   An even worse one where Jesse uses the Word of God when telling the asshole sheriff to go fuck himself. As the paramedics explain to the sheriff's son, they can't **pull his father's severed penis from his rectum**.
    -   In the "Good Ol' Boys" arc, Jodie is tricked into pit-fighting a gorilla and is given a baseball bat as his only weapon. After winning, he asks the promoter if he needs the bat back.
-   It is implied that this is where Max of **Sam & Max: Freelance Police** keeps his gun, though it's still none of your damn business. Though maybe later, when everyone's sitting down, he'll tell us.
-   In **The Sandman (1989)**, Loki tells the Puck about a prank he once played on the "not very bright" Thor. Disguised as a doctor, he convinces Thor that he's pregnant and tells him to lie face down and wait for him to deliver the baby. Loki then feeds him a gallon of castor oil and sticks a cork up his butt, then goes off to sleep with Thor's wife. Eight days later, Thor is still lying there waiting when Ratatosk, the squirrel of the World Tree, comes by and, curious, pulls the cork out, releasing eight days' worth of backed-up feces. Thor picks up the stunned Ratatosk, embraces him, and says "You're ugly, you're hairy, and you're covered in shit. But you're mine, and I love you!"
-   Something similar occurs in **Sin City - The Big Fat Kill**. Miho apparently shoves her katana up a merc's ass. We see the hilt behind him and the tip protruding from his face. Considering the angle, that's exactly what happened. In the same story, Jackie-Boy slips and falls on Miho's swastika shuriken and it gets stuck in his backside.
    
    **Jackie-Boy:** DON'T NOBODY LAUGH! THIS ISN'T FUNNY!
    
-   A rather serious example is implied in a two-part story in **Spider-Man's Tangled Web** featuring Tombstone as a Villain Protagonist. While in prison, he recruits small-time super-villains Hyno Hustler, Rocket Racer, and Big Ben to work for him, and in an early part of one issue asks what they've managed to "hold onto". Racer says he has some vaseline, and Tombstone says that "might be useful". Later, after Tombstone is beaten up by a corrupt corrections officer working for the Kangaroo, he manages to smuggle a knife into his cell. When Racer asks where he got it, Tombstone says, "Hid it. Told you the vaseline would be useful." (A career criminal like Tombstone would probably be good at a trick like this, which Real Life convicts can and do manage on occasion.)
-   In the JMS iteration of **Squadron Supreme**, Emil Burbank once shoved Tom Thumb (who, as his name suggests, is quite small) up Shape's rectum, ostensibly to gauge the feasibility of using Shape to smuggle things into battle. Knowing Burbank, his actual intention was probably just to make both Shape and Thumb miserable out of spite.
-   **Superman**:
    -   **Supergirl (1982)**: As she is arguing with a police in issue #12, Supergirl is said to get a badge if she wants to play cop. Kara retorts by asking if he wants to know what he can do with **his** badge.
        
        **Lieutenant Peters:** You wanna play cop, join the department and get yourself a badge! Until then, stay out of my way!  
        **Supergirl:** You need a hint as to what you can do with your badge, Peters?

-   One crossover event in Marvel's Ultimate universe feature the Hulk walk into a diner, stark naked, and politely ask for pancakes, producing a wad of bills to prove that he could pay for them. The diner staff immediately noted that as he A) had no pockets and B) his hands had been empty before he'd produced the money and were disturbed by the implication of where that meant he'd been carrying it.

Ass Shove Example in Comic Strips

-   One **Dilbert** strip has Dilbert open a software package, and by doing so agree to a full-body cavity search at any time. Enter a woman with the Glove Snap.
-   The implication of this is the punchline for one **The Far Side** cartoon, which depicts a time-traveling scientist with a giant thermometer approaching a dinosaur from behind.
    
    "An instant later, both Professor Waxman and his time machine are obliterated, leaving the cold-blooded/warm-blooded dinosaur debate still unresolved."
    
-   **Madam & Eve**:
-   In one **Ogri** strip, Mitzi responds to a loutish driver's proposition by shoving his head up his own arse.
-   When Bob's Player Character is exploring Uzer's pyramid in **Knights of the Dinner Table,** he finds a valuable-looking medallion. He has his character "keister" it so he doesn't have to share it with the others. This turns out to be instrumental later when it's revealed to be a component for the Scepter of Five Parts. Amusingly, Bob had actually forgotten about it, meaning it's been... keistered for some time.

    **Bruno:** Or?  
    **Scott:** Or I'm going to wipe the ground with you, punk. I'm tired of your insult throwing, bad attitude, delinquent wannabe, whiney-ass, momma's boy, country-music-reject, self, already. If you don't behave, I'm going to take the nearest blunt object, something close to the size of Warren, Hank, and their tents and stuff it up your largest body crevice. I don't like bullies and I won't tolerate them. Bullies tend to bring out the worst in me. Did I make myself perfectly clear to you Bruno?
    
-   RealityCheck's Nyxverse: **Nyx's Family** starts with Shining Armor treating a visiting Twilight Sparkle and her adopted daughter Nyx coldly due to his unfortunate history with the latter during her stint as Nightmare Moon.

-   Referenced in **The Tall Guy**. Dexter is talking to Kate at the hospital, when a man on another guerney starts groaning.
    
    **Patient:** Nurse, if you wouldn't mind? I am in some pain here.  
    **Kate**(walks over to him): You will be treated when I see fit. You forfeited the right to be treated in a reasonable manner when you made the decision to stick a vacuum cleaner pipe up your bottom.

-   **Watch Your Stern**: When Commander Fanshawe tells Chief Mundy that he knows what he can do with his bicycle, Chief Mundy's first thought is that Commander Fanshawe is telling him he can stick it up his arse.

Ass Shove Example in Jokes

-   There's a joke about three explorers who were captured by a native tribe. The natives say that the explorers may survive if they collect and bring back ten pieces of a fruit of their choosing. The first explorer returns with ten berries and is told he'll go free if he gets all ten inside his anus. He succeeds and is released. The second explorer returns with ten apples and is told the same. He suddenly bursts out laughing; when the natives ask what's so funny, he tells them that the third explorer was collecting pineapples.
    -   A variation has the third man arrive, have the task explained to him, and choose death after some consideration. The natives then proceed to execute him in the traditional way, by inserting a fatal number of pineapples into his anus.
    -   Yet another variation has the natives telling them that they will kill them if they make any facial expression whatsoever during the 'challenge', and the one telling the joke is encouraged to announce the number out loud. The first explorer, having something large-ish (like apples), is killed after a few (3-4) for grimacing. The second explorer, having picked something small (berries or grapes), allows the one telling the joke to count up to 7 or 8, then the explorer inexplicably bursts out laughing and gets killed as a result. The two explorers meet in Heaven, and the first one is distressed, asking the second what had happened since he was doing so well... the second explorer, still laughing, says "I just saw the third guy, and he's got PINEAPPLES!".
    -   Yet **another** variation: a trader is heading through the jungle with a load of bananas, but then he's captured by cannibals. They decide they want to stuff him before cooking him, so they proceed to shove the bananas up his ass...and the trader starts laughing hysterically. The cannibal chief asks, "What's so funny?" The trader's response? "My partner's a half-day behind me, with a load of pineapples!"
-   There's a Christmas joke that an angel approaches Santa Claus while he's in a bad mood and asks "Where should I put the Christmas Tree?" As you might have guessed, Santa's reply was something along the lines of "Stick it up your ass!" ...and that's why the angel goes on top of the Christmas tree every year.
    -   One version has him asking for it by saying "Oi, fatty! Where should I stick this?"
-   This joke from a WWII vet regarding rectal exams: "Well, first he put his right hand on my shoulder. No, wait, he put his left hand on my shoulder. Wait a minute, he put both his hands on my shoulders."
-   A doctor is making his rounds through the hospital when he stops to talk to the head nurse. The nurse says, "By the way, doctor, did you know you've got your thermometer stuck behind your ear?" The doctor feels around his ear and says, "Great, some asshole has my pen."
-   A farmer looked out his window and saw that one of his cows was near the road and having difficulty giving birth, so he went out and took a hold of the calf's legs and started tugging. Before long a luxury car stopped and a man got out asking if he could help. The Farmer said it would be appreciated. The man took off his Rolex and rolled up his sleeves, and after both men did some tugging the calf came out just fine and healthy. The farmer thanked the stranger, who said: "I just have one question... how fast was the little cow going when it hit the big cow?"
-   A doctor was surprised when he examined his elderly patient. "Sir... do you know you've got a suppository in your ear?" The old man promptly takes out his cell phone and calls his wife. "Martha, you can stop looking for my hearing aid. I think I know where I put it."
-   A hillbilly goes to the doctor for the first time in decades. The doctor prescribes him some suppositories, which he doesn't know how to use but isn't about to admit to some city slicker. A week later, he comes back absolutely furious. "Dammit doc, I took them suppositories like you said and the damn things don't work! One a day for a week with a glass of water, and lemme tell you, I could've shoved'em up my **ass** and it'd have had more effect!"
    -   Another variation has the doctor tell the patient to put the suppository "in his back passage." The punchline is the same but suggests the patient left the supp on a table just inside the back door of his house.
    -   Yet another one has the patient complain that he'd used all the suppositories but there was no effect whatsoever. To which doctor incredulously replied: "How can this be? Did you eat them or something?" - and got this response, Sarcasm Mode full on: "No, dammit, I shoved them up my ass!"
-   A man walks into a bar with his pet monkey. He orders a drink while the monkey hops up onto the pool table. The monkey grabs one of the pool balls, shoves it in his mouth, and swallows it whole. The angry bartender tells the man he has to pay for a new ball and the man agrees, paying. The man returns several weeks later, with the monkey. The man orders a drink, while the monkey hops onto the bar and goes for the jar of pickled eggs. He takes out an egg and shoves it up his ass. Then he takes it out of his ass and eats it.
    
    **Bartender:** **\[disgusted\]** Gross! Your monkey just ate a pickled egg that he shoved up his ass!  
    **Man:** Yeah, ever since that pool ball came out of him, he makes sure to measure everything first.
    
-   A man goes to the doctor and is diagnosed with a tapeworm. The doctor says he can get rid of it if the man comes back the next day with a banana and two cookies (or some other combination of health and junk food). The man comes back with the items, and the doctor tells him to drop his pants and bend over. The doctor then shoves the banana up his ass, followed by the cookies. He then instructs the man to come back the next days with the same items. Wanting the tapeworm gone, the man obeys. The next day, the process is repeated, and the doctors tell him to come back tomorrow. For a length of time, the man comes every day and has the items shoved up his ass. Finally, the doctor tells him to come back with a banana and a hammer. After a sleepless night wondering what the hammer is going to feel like, the man returns. The doctor shoves the banana up his ass, grabs the hammer... and waits. After a few minutes, the tapeworm sticks his head out and demands his cookies, at which point the doctor hits him with the hammer.

-   In the tenth **Captain Underpants** book, Tippy Tinkletrousers' Robo-Trousers are equipped with a thermonuclear bomb, which are activated by having a robotic tentacle pull it out through the nether regions. It Makes Sense in Context... sorta.
-   In part of Greg Stillson's backstory in Stephen King's novel **The Dead Zone**, some people who anger him end up with objects inserted in their rectum. To be fair to the character, said people were mooks send to give him a hard time. In a 3 to 1 fight. Armed with brass knuckles. Guess what it is that ends up there.
-   In the **Deathstalker** series a woman was forced to approach a man who would decide her fate completely in the nude.

-   In "Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption" from **Different Seasons**, this is apparently how Andy smuggled several hundred dollars into jail, and how Red gets his manuscript out... Willing suspension of disbelief (or perhaps Fridge Horror) applies because the manuscript is better than 100 handwritten pages. Ahem.
-   Inverted in **Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency**, when Dirk demonstrates his facility with stage magic by (apparently) drawing a string of colored handkerchiefs from the posterior of a small dog, and from Richard's, a slim bunch of anemones.

    -   The whole bit about the monkey's nut **and** the garderobe in **Lords and Ladies**.

Instead of snitching, he tells her a location where she can safely take out the gun and gives her a fanny pack to store the ammo.
-   **Gangsta Granny**: Ben talks about how in the olden days, people were punished with a "red-hot poker up the bum".

Ass Shove Example in Tabletop Games

-   The Ass of Holding. Exactly What It Says on the Tin.
-   This<small>◊</small> story from 4chan's /tg/ board details how one player played as a concubine who was nothing but The Load to the party throughout the entire campaign, much to the other players' great frustration. When the party reaches the Dark Lord's fortress, the concubine immediately betrays the party and declares her undying love for the Dark Lord. The party is locked in the dungeon while the concubine and the Dark Lord get married. They return to his chambers to consummate the marriage, and as soon as he turns his back, a halfling rogue emerges from the concubine's ass, shoots straight up the Dark Lord's ass, and tears him apart from the inside. The rogue was the poster's real character all along, making use of the "Extremely Tight Space" skill, and the concubine was merely a hired NPC. He had even secretly been making rolls the entire campaign in order to avoid falling out early and ruining the surprise for the rest of the group, who were all naturally left speechless by The Reveal.
-   The infamous "arseplomancer" build for **Dungeons & Dragons** 3.5: the Exemplar class lets you pick one skill which can be used to impress people, and a high enough Escape Artist skill lets you pass through a space narrower than your head. The result is a character who climbs into a guy's rectum in a manner so awesome that everyone in 60 ft becomes undyingly loyal to him. Then the poor guy explodes.

-   This trailer for **Marvel vs. Capcom 3**, where a stray attack by Morrigan touches an unsuspecting Deadpool in a bad place. The look on her face when she realizes what she's done is priceless. Or maybe she's just confused by the giant "GYAAAAA" sticking out of the building.
-   **Arc the Lad: Twilight of Spirits**
    -   In-game example, whenever you have Delma in your party. So, you're in a fight, maybe you're in trouble, one of your characters is in critical condition, you'd really need a healing item... Then you remember that you put one in Delma's inventory. Come on, try and guess where she pulls it from. Exactly.
    -   Also seen in cutscenes when Darc draws his sword. We don't actually see much apart from Darc reaching toward the hem of his kilt-like garment and seeing the sword in his hand after a sword-drawing sound effect. Its never explained where he stows his sword between fights but...
-   Inverted in **Assassin's Creed II**, where Caterina Sforza's rant against the Orsi brothers includes the threat to shove their heads up her vagina; this isn't scripted dialog but something the historical Caterina actually said.

Afterward, you can even hunt down that goat and retrieve the eye; the item description now states that it smells really bad.
-   **Baldur's Gate II**: Minsc manages to keep Boo hidden from Irenicus's capture party. Supposedly there is ever so much of Minsc to search. Imoen speaks for everyone by going, "Ew, I don't want to know." Not that Minsc looks anything like Richard Gere, but...
-   **Bloodborne**: An unfortunate, unforeseen consequence of making backstabs in this game work by way of ramming your hand into the foe and ripping it back out, along with making one of the game's enemies a giant boar, is the fact that backstabbing this same boar looks less like a brutal finisher, and more like, well, this trope.
    -   Exaggerated in the Buttborne montage.
-   The Korean arcade game **Boong-Ga Boong-Ga** requires players to jab a plastic finger into a protruding butt (euphemistically described as "spanking" in English advertisements). Higher scores are rewarded for stronger pokes. However, to win the prize (which is a gold-colored plastic keychain in the shape of a poop, by the way), you need to deliver a poke that is within the strength marked by the power bar on the screen.
-   **Burrito Bison Revenge** is a Launch Game about a buffalo-man trying to retrieve his wallet from the Gummies that stole it in the previous game.

    -   When two fire imps decide to burn Conker up, one of the imps asks his friend what he should do with his lit cigarette. He tells him to shove it up his ass. The first imp responds… by actually doing it.
-   Since most enemies in the **Dark Souls** series are much taller than the player, the majority of backstabs in these games become ass shoves. The Fang Boar in the Undead Parish also has an opening in its armor around its tail, allowing "backstabs" straight up the wazoo. But, importantly, the ones in the Duke's Archive **do not**, making them much harder to damage.
-   The skills in **Disco Elysium** tries to convince the Detective to do this to himself at several points.
    -   By choosing enough dialogue options, where the Detective makes a pledge by swearing on his honor, causes the Authority skill to chime in, and try to convince you to perform the "Rite of Honour":
        
        **Authority:** You need to bring the thumb of your right hand — your sword hand — to your rectum and stick it in there to form the Arch of Honours.
        
    -   Upon getting the flask of Blue Medicinal Spirit, the necktie and the Electrochemistry skill are both gleeful:
        
        **Horrific Necktie:** **Bratan**, I am so proud. Now — whatever you do, don't drink it. This deserves so much more than just regular **oral** consumption.  
        **Electrochemistry:** The tie is **SO** on the money there! Up the bum it goes!
        
-   In **Discworld II**, Rincewind has to convince the mortician that he's dead and uses some ice to lower his body temperature. Guess where the thermometer, and thus the ice, have to go...
-   Similarly, in **Dragon Age: Origins** the player might run into a prisoner who offers a key in exchange for food. If the player asks how he managed to slip the key past his captors' search, he'll answer that he swallowed it and it has... later come back into his possession. The key, upon further examination, is... "Strangely warm."
-   **The Elder Scrolls**:
    -   Implied at one point in **An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire**. When asking a Scamp where it hid the key:
        
        **Scamp:** Keys? Keys in dark, NASTY place. Near my tail. Want look? See?
        
    -   In **The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion**, there is an imprisoned Morag Tong assassin and a note from his captors mentioning how they have no idea who hired him to kill them because they couldn't find his orders anywhere on his person.

    -   In **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim**, if the player is arrested and sent to prison, and they elect to escape, they will have a single lockpick on their person to use to try to get free. Precisely how they got it into their cell isn't stated, but considering **all** of their other possessions, including clothes, are confiscated, it is implied that they smuggled it in someplace that wasn't searched....
-   **Fear & Hunger: Termina**: Failing the Poe's coin flip attack sees it inflict one of these on the player, slamming them onto the floor before repeatedly ramming one of its hands up your backside.
-   In **Fighter Maker** for the Play Station, It's possible to create a long and intricate **fatality** attack that ends with a deadly **kancho**.
-   This is implied to have happened in an early scene in **Final Fantasy IX** when Steiner inspects a large barrel by poking it with his sword, only for Zidane to pop out howling in pain.
-   In **Guilty Gear** one of Faust's overdrives has him do this to his opponent using his oversized scalpel. The vocal responses he gets out of them are rather comical at times (Such as Chipp's "OH YEAH!").
    -   In **Xrd -SIGN-** he switches to using a typical kancho... and the overdrive is now cinematic, allowing the players to witness the comical facial expressions of his victims.
-   In **Hypnospace Outlaw**, Counselor Ronnie warns teens about a new recreational drug, T-Nubs, that is taken as a suppository. Ronnie is an Invented Individual, and T-Nubs don't actually exist. The **Plus** DLC adds a minigame, **Drug Runners**, where Ronnie has to escape from drug dealers who are trying to "shonk" him.
-   At one point in **Knights of the Old Republic**, the player character runs into a prisoner who says he'll give you a hacker's tool if he's freed.

-   **Marvel: Avengers Alliance** has an enemy attack called "Where the Sun Don't Shine", though the sprite animation (thankfully) is just a generic attack.
-   Used as a possible solution in a disturbing amount of puzzles in **McPixel.** Actual success rate of this solution varies.

-   Like its anime counterpart, Croagunk in **Pokkén Tournament** kanchos both its trainer for the heck of it, (which you can experience in first person before some matches) and its opponents.
-   The **Postal 2** Expansion Pack **Apocalypse Weekend** has this as a possibility in one of its levels where the Postal Dude is running around smashing cow heads with a sledgehammer. It's possible to throw said hammer at the cows as well. If it hits the front, it kills them. But if it hits the back, the hammer... erm... gets stuck. At which point you can **pull it out of the paralyzed cow's anus**. Making matters worse is the audible \*pop\* when you retrieve it.
    
    **The Dude:** Geez. Those things are like black holes!
    
    -   Not to mention how, in the base game, the Dude can **stick his guns up cats' buttholes to use as makeshift silencers**.
-   Another Rareware example; in **Banjo-Kazooie**, one of the tasks in Mad Monster Mansion is to take a Jiggy from Napper, a sleeping ghost, without waking him up. Once you successfully get the Jiggy, this exchange occurs between Napper and Grunty:
    
    **Napper:** Grunty's gold, how it shone, she'll be mad, now it's gone!  
    **Grunty:** Yes I'm mad, my boot I'll put, up your useless spooky butt!
    
-   The **Ratchet & Clank** series is quite fond of innuendos. The third game in the series is actually named **Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal**, after all.
    -   This bit from the opening of **Ratchet: Deadlocked**, when Al activates the speech function on Ratchet's new armor:
        
        **Ratchet:** Let me **outta** this thing you Blarg-headed frack monkey! I can barely breathe and my tail feels like it's shoved right up my—! **\-speech function cuts off-**

-   Turn your enemies around and propel them into orbit, by shoving the Alien Anal Probe up their butts in **Saints Row IV**.
-   **Salt and Sanctuary**: Sometimes you may end up behind a Split Swordsman who has fallen to his knee after being parried, and the result of a backstab can be this.
-   The Headless miniboss in **Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice** has this as one of its most dangerous attack. If it lands the hit, it'll take out a huge chunk of Sekiro's health as it rips out his **shirikodama** (a mythical organ located in the anus that contains the human soul).
-   The player can use an "Ass Shove" execution in **Shank 2**.
-   In the fighting game **Skullgirls**, Cerebella has the kancho version of this trope as a move.
-   In **South Park: The Fractured but Whole**, two of your Buddy Powers used to clear through obstacles involves shoving things up your ass.

Rebecca also threatens to do this to the New Kid in her intro.
-   In **South Park: The Stick of Truth**, Mr. Slave is a summon who can one-shot enemies by shoving them into his ass.
    -   Taken to extreme lengths when the New Kid has to shrink down and journey into Mr. Slave's ass to defuse a Snuke. Inside, you'll find a number of semen blockages, a condom, an iPhone with an incoming call from Big Gay Al, a flashlight, a vibrator, a live bat, a rodent skeleton, anal beads, Mr. Hat, two armed guards protecting the snuke that the government agents placed inside Mr. Slave's ass, along with the snuke itself, and of course, the spirits of the Frog King, the Sparrow Prince, and the Catatafish. You can also somehow summon Mr. Slave to shove your enemies into his ass **while you are inside his ass**, however that works. Doing so gets you the "Inside Joke" achievement.
-   Subverted in **Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow**: In a late-game mission, you have to get a USB drive from a guy, who has been taken hostage. When you get to him and take it you can say "Where were you keeping this? It might be good to know." His response: "Not where you think I had it. I just have experience hiding things."
    -   Implied in the first mission in the same game, however, where you get a storage device from a hostage, and when Sam asks how he hid it, he says to "just wash your hands when you're done with it."
-   **S.T.A.L.K.E.R.**:
    -   Mentioned in the very first mission the player takes when you have to obtain a Flash drive off of a captured Stalker. When questioned where he hid it, he claims "I didn't hide it down **there,** so don't worry." Also, when stalkers sitting around campfires begin to play guitar, the way in which they get the guitar out can raise players' eyebrows. It appears out of thin air and they pull downwards, and it sure did not come from their backpack. Sure, it's hammerspace, but still.
-   Implied in **Star Wars: Republic Commando** where you get these lines:
    
    **Boss:** Did they find the data?  
    **Scorch:** No, I hid it pretty well.  
    **Boss:** Where, exactly?  
    **Scorch:** Mmmm, you don't wanna know.  
    **Boss:** Roger that.
    
-   Chun-Li seemingly reaches into her strongest butt in the world in **Street Fighter V** Shadow Falls to grab the MacGuffin to show to Cammy.
-   **Tales of Monkey Island**:
    -   Near the end of Chapter 5, while Morgan stabs LeChuck after Guybrush has trapped him, Elaine gives the villain one by stabbing him with the Cutlass of Kaflu... let's just say... **right in the fundament**! And this is an E10+ rated game, too!
    -   Previously subverted near the end of Chapter 1: when the player tries to use the ancient weather vane on De Singe while he's in the messed up idol, Guybrush will say, "Oh, I'd love to, but I'm pretty sure that De Singe doesn't have the necessary... slots."
-   **Tales of the Abyss**: In the scene before the final battle with Van, Anise makes this comment:
    
    **Anise:** We're gonna take the Commandant's ideals and shove them up his ass!
    
-   Mentioned by a few of **Team Fortress 2's** characters.
    
    **Demoman:** **(to Engineer)** You come wide at me again, boy, I'll stick that wrench right up yer arse!  
    **Demoman:** **(to Engineer again)** Go on and build more o' yer little guns. I'll shove every one of them up yer arse!  
    **Soldier:** Merasmus! I am going to pull a rabbit out of your ass!  
    **Soldier:** **(to Medic)** I'm gonna mail my boot to the Kaiser with your ass around it!  
    **Soldier (to Administrator):** Then I guess you'd better take me to the gravel pit and **shoot me**, lady. 'Cause if you ever ask me to kill my friend again, I will put my **boot so far up your ass** it will be on the **news**.  
    **Soldier (to Merasmus):** Tonight, your ass will be visited by three ghosts: my foot, my other foot, and a ghost!

    **White Mage:** "This hammer will be introduced to your anatomy in a way that is neither comfortable nor sanitary. The White Mage's oath forbids me from speaking further on this matter, but consider it a guarantee that you will taste splinters for a week when I'm through with you. However, that very same oath precludes me from enacting this extremely warranted if invasive act until I have made every effort to save the lives of those still trapped in the debris."

    -   To handle the toxic atmosphere of Ghanj-Rho when the Toughs were going on a mission to get a new set of eyes for Schlock, they are given with a device to filter the toxins out of their blood. They're not, unlike one grunt thought, to be swallowed...

-   **Something\*Positive**:
    -   Mike and the Redneck Trees. While nothing actually happened, it was only because Peejee allowed her conscience to get the better of her and put a stop to things; otherwise, the audience is led to believe Davan and company would indeed have gone there. So to speak.

        **Dr. Weird:** My ass has decided to eat...****my hand!!**** (**shoves his hand up his ass even further**) It hungers for more!
        
-   **Archer**:
    -   When the eponymous Archer goes on a rampage, this happens during an interrogation. With a **fragmentation grenade**, though he thought he was lying, and had intended for it to be a smoke grenade.
        
        **Archer:** Did you know that men can also benefit from Kegel exercises?
        
    -   In an earlier episode, Archer pulls out a grenade immediately after a threesome with Lana and the villain. Lana asks the obvious question of where he got it, and while his **response** is "Hanging from the lampshade", it's pretty clear it was a combination of this and Ass Pull.
-   **Beavis and Butt-Head**
    -   In "Prank Call", after Beavis and Butt-Head repeatedly play telephone pranks on the biker Harry Sachs, he ends up thinking that Stewart's father is responsible and shoves the cordless phone right up Mr. Stevenson's ass. Afterwards, the duo calls Stewart to ask about the police cars and ambulance in front of his house, and it rings while inside Mr. Stevenson's butt.
    -   "Butt Flambé" features Beavis at the hospital in agony over **something** that's charred his butt and bursts into a propelling flame when the doctors try to examine him. It's never explained and thus, unfortunately, left for us to imagine.
    -   There's the infamous episode where a joke was made about sticking a live firecracker up a cat's behind, which caused so much outcry that MTV was forbidden from airing it again. Clearly, the fact that they thought it went too far was saying a lot, given the type of humor this show is famous for.
    -   In "Huh Huh Humbug" (the show's rendition of Yet Another Christmas Carol), Buzzcut (playing the Ghost of Christmas Future) threatens to do this to Beavis (filling out the Scrooge role), by promising he'll resort to sticking a Christmas tree where "the sun don't shine" if he doesn't change his ways.
-   This is taken to ridiculous proportions in **Celebrity Deathmatch** in the match between Lucy Lawless and Calista Flockheart. An accident in the fight has Callista wind up with her head up Lucy's butt, at which point, after a few minutes of struggling, Lucy is able to completely "absorb" Callista into her body through that end of her. This somehow causes Callista to end up in her womb, which results in Lucy, at the end of the episode, giving birth to Callista as she would a newborn daughter.
-   In **Cracké**, Ed ends up sliding right up a rhino's rear in "Factory".
-   In the John Dilworth short **The Dirdy Birdy**, one of the ways Fergurina retaliates to Purdy mooning her is by shoving a helium pump up his ass. After inflating his buttcheeks, she then pops them with a safety pin.
-   **Family Guy**:
    -   In "Stewie Loves Lois", Peter gets his first ever prostate exam and thinks he got raped.
    -   At least two Winnie the Pooh-related cutaway gags use this as part of the gag. In "Road To the North Pole," Pooh finds out that Eeyore is a grouch all the time because "I have a nail in my anus." In "Saturated Fat Guy," Pooh – when lodged in the door to Rabbit's house (after overeating) notices what feels like a fist up his rear and, when commenting about why Rabbit isn't using his shoulder for leverage, is told, "Don't worry about it!"
    -   Another episode involves Quagmire returning from a vacation in Mexico with a large number of "illegal" fireworks smuggled in up his rectum...even though fireworks aren't illegal in Rhode Island.
    -   Quagmire also claims to do this with carrots; it's best not to ask why.
    -   The episode "Barely Legal" has yet another example involving Quagmire: when he, Peter, and Cleveland go to the police academy, the first lesson is on doing cavity searches, with Peter as the police officer and Quagmire as the suspect. Among the many, **many** things inside Quagmire's rectum are a cellphone, a doorknob, a wedge of cheese, a wind-up toy car, a fish (which, judging by its flopping around after hitting the ground, **was still alive),** a DVD copy of **Good Burger**, and a xylophone, complete with mallet.
        
        **Peter:** I... think that's everything.  
        **Bruce:** You want me to double-check?
        
    -   When Stewie is preparing to compete in a tennis tournament, he declares that he knows exactly where he's going to put the 1st place trophy. Cut to two doctors looking at his X-ray after he apparently died shoving the trophy up his ass (he doesn't actually die for that episode).
    -   In the "Fellas at the Frickin' FCC" musical number, Stewie responds to the mention of the FCC sending a warning to your mailbox by remarking that he can think of quite another place they should've stuck it first. While he's saying this, he is shown to have made a sculpture around the mailbox the warning letter has been inserted, which makes it all the more obvious that Stewie meant they can shove it up their asses.
    -   According to Mort, he had pine cones shoved up his ass by other kids during his youth.
    -   When Peter lost his memory, he tried to give Stewie a diaper change and stuck the new diaper up his ass, traumatizing him.
    -   In "Peter's Two Dads", Peter, as "Pee-Pants the Inebriated Hobo Clown", accidentally crushes Francis while riding a unicycle, then tells Lois to call an ambulance for each of them because the unicycle got lodged in his ass.
-   **Father of the Pride**: In "Sarmoti Moves In", Sarmoti hides his poker winnings in the rectum of his zebra rug.
-   **Futurama**
    -   "The Deep South":
        -   Professor Farnsworth presents Fry with an enormous egg-sized pill.
            
            **Fry:** I can't swallow that!  
            **Farnsworth:** Well, then good news! It's a suppository!
            
        -   Later in the same episode:
            
            **Farnsworth:** Before we go out, has everyone taken their pressure pill?  
            **Amy:** **(Annoyed look)** Yes. Stop asking.
            
        -   Referenced later still, when the crew is introduced to a more efficient nose-plug-based method of breathing underwater:
            
            **Farnsworth:** This is uncomfortable and humiliating! Now, if they could put it in the form of a suppository...
            
    -   Also, "Parasites Lost":
        
        **Zoidberg:** I'm going to have to take a look inside you with this camera.  
        **(Fry opens his mouth.)**  
        **Zoidberg:** Guess again.
        
    -   Later in the same episode Fry decides to confront the parasites using a microscopic robot duplicate that goes inside his own body. He inserts the robot by dropping it down the back of his underpants.
    -   From "Xmas Story" when Fry tries to placate a homicidal Santa robot with milk and cookies:
        
        **Santa:** You dare bribe **Santa?** I'm gonna shove coal so far up your stocking you'll be coughing up diamonds!
        
    -   From "Law and Oracle" as Crazy Roberto makes demands of the cops while holding the Planet Express Crew at knifepoint.
        
        **Roberto:** Listen up piggies! I want a hover-copter, and an unmarked sandwich, and a new face with like, uh, a Hugh Grant look! And every five minutes I don't get it, someone's gonna get STABBED IN THE AASSSS!  
        **Zoidberg:** He's bluffing. **(Slicing sound)** Aahh! He's not bluffing!
        
    -   In "Lethal Inspection", Bender demonstrates his built-in pencil sharpener, which is located exactly where you expect. The owner of the pencil immediately picks it up with a pair of tongs and throws it into a furnace.

-   In **Johnny Test**, the titular protagonist gets a suppository shot up him in "Johnny Testosterone" as a last-ditch solution to undo him being Hulk-like.
-   **Kaeloo**:
    -   In the episode "Let's Play Treasure Hunt", Kaeloo sets up a fun game of treasure hunt for Stumpy and Quack Quack with the promise of a "surprise" at the end. Mr. Cat changes the clues to make the game so they get injured. In the end, Kaeloo gives them the "surprise" she had promised, and it turns out to be a photo of herself. Stumpy decides to shove it up his ass just to spite her, but she stops him before he does.
    -   In another episode, Stumpy sticks a pencil up his butt because he thinks it's funny. To his chagrin, nobody else finds it amusing.
-   **King of the Hill** had an episode where a doctor inserts a camera into Hank's anus to check for an intestinal blockage. Hank is humiliated, but nobody else understands what the big deal is. Also, it is implied that Dale's constipation remedy using bacon grease (which Hank reluctantly tries later) involves doing this with it.
-   In episode 8 of Season 2 of **The Legend of Vox Machina**, a de-powered and cursed Grog needs to receive a huge magical suppository in order to recover. Since he's too weak to do it himself, Scanlan volunteers to do it for him.
    -   In order to bypass the dragon Umbrasyll's Acidic Breath, Scanlan proposes they enter through the other way. Cue Scanlan's magic hand carrying him and Vax in position to make a prostate check, flying straight towards Umbrasyll's cloaca.
-   **Looney Tunes Cartoons** has Sylvester go up an elephant's rear in **RHINO ya DON'T**.
-   **My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic** has a subtle one in **Feeling Pinkie Keen** where Twilight rescues Spike from being Hydra lunch by putting him up on her head before running away. As it so happens, she's a unicorn, and unlike a similar maneuver earlier in the episode, her horn is not seen bent to the side, and Spike looks none too comfortable as his upper body and limbs jiggle, but his butt stays firmly in place.
    -   Troubleshoes also has a cactus enter where the sun don't shine in **Appleoosa's Most Wanted** as the climax of a string of slapstick mishaps in his house.
-   **My Little Pony: Pony Life** features multiple instances of Hammerspace storage conspicuously using the butt near the tail base on ponies not wearing pants:
    -   The first time, in **The Fluttershy Effect**, is the most blatant, as before Rainbow Dash pulls out a tablet about the size of her torso out seemingly from her butt, it makes a notification noise with **visible sound indicators to say it's inside her butt**.
    -   **The Rarity Report** features two nearly back-to-back, with first DJ PON3 pulling a vinyl record out from seemingly between her cheeks, and then Rarity pulling a microphone out from below her tail, conveniently obscured by a TV news overlay.
-   **The Penguins of Madagascar** has quite a bit of butt humor, and King Julien seems to be the literal butt monkey of these particular kinds of it:
    -   In "The Big Squeeze", Cloud Cuckoolander King Julien mentions how happy he is not to be a mammal when the mammals start disappearing. In order to verify his warm-blooded nature, Kowalski produces a thermometer from Hammerspace and briefly moves it under the table before yanking it back out. Julien's expression makes it abundantly clear what's going on.
    -   King Julien tries to catapult himself into a penguin party, but ends up going in Roy the rhino's butt in "Action Reaction".

-   Happens twice in the **Ren & Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon"** episode "Altruists". The first is Ren accidentally shoving his finger into Stimpy's ass while they were performing their routine beatings, and the second happens when Ren intentionally pushed a tile in between Stimpy's buttcheeks.
-   **Rick and Morty**:
    -   In the first episode, Rick asks Morty to hide some alien tree seeds "all the way up" his butt to get them through customs because Rick has done the same so many times that the seeds would just fall out.

He picks up on this and says that he sure hasn't.
-   **South Park**: Considering that this show is known for its adult-oriented usage of Toilet Humour, it should be no surprise that this comes up every now and again:
    -   The premiere episode, "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", culminates with a 50-foot satellite dish emerging from Cartman's ass.
    -   "Canceled" shows the return of the said satellite, having it emerge and retract again:
        
        **Kyle:** Are you all right?

-   **Teen Titans (2003)**: In "X", when Red X returns, the Titans want to make sure that Robin (who was Red X before) is really himself and not some kind of trick. After Starfire establishes he's not a hologram, they consider a cavity search to rule out other possibilities:

    **Robin:** **(Horrified)** Wait! Please! It wasn't me this time! I promise!
