Cruel Twist Ending: 
And they lived happily— Never mind.

_"It's not ironic, it's just mean!"_

A Twist Ending that serves no purpose other than to be _excessively cruel_ to the subjects of the story, who oftentimes do not deserve their fates.

The Cruel Twist Ending is basically the Evil Counterpart of the Karmic Twist Ending: in the latter, the twist is a form of divine justice, a bad thing happening to stop a bad person from getting away with it (or a good thing happening to someone who deserves it). In the former, it's just Finagle's Law: the universe is a mean place and wants to hurt you. Often, a Cruel Twist Ending is what happens when a writer attempts a Karmic Twist Ending, but fails to carry it off. It can be used for cruel irony and very dark humour but has to be undeserved and unsatisfying in order to be different from the karmic one.

Most common in genre anthologies with a darker tone such as _The Twilight Zone_: _Tales of the Unexpected_, _Tales from the Darkside_, _Monsters_, _The Outer Limits (1995)_ (so often, in fact, that "Outer Limits Twist" was the previous trope name), etc.

Lighter-weight versions come up very often in shows where Failure Is the Only Option, especially when the show has run for a long time, and the writers need to contrive more and more extravagant reasons why the protagonists can't win. It can also be used as a shock subversion of a stereotypical happy ending. If it's overused, it becomes a Mandatory Twist Ending. If the ending makes you wonder what the point of the story was, it can come across as a Shoot the Shaggy Dog. The Diabolus ex Machina also often gets involved. And Then John Was a Zombie is often an example. Compare Not Quite Saved Enough and Sudden Downer Ending. Frequently becomes an Audience-Alienating Ending.

Cruel Twist Ending Example in Advertising

-   An awareness campaign about child dyslexia showed a young boy sitting listlessly through a prizegiving ceremony at school, aware that he hasn't done well enough in any of his classes to receive a prize. Suddenly, his name is called, and he discovers he's won a prize for art and design (the only subject that involves little reading and writing) - then finds out his prize is a book token.
-   British charity St. John Ambulance, which trains people in first aid and provides voluntary first-aiders in the community, ran an advert showing a father undergoing cancer treatment. He survives, but then at the party intended to welcome him home from the hospital, he chokes to death because no one knows how to do first aid. The intended message was that the death rate from cancer is only slightly higher than that for people who could have been saved by basic first aid knowledge.
-   A controversial GoDaddy.com ad intended to run during the Super Bowl featured a puppy named Buddy getting separated from his owner and trekking a long distance to return to her. She is happy to see him...because she just sold him on her GoDaddy-hosted website. The ad drew ire from many viewers, with some activists accusing it of promoting puppy mills, and it was withdrawn.
-   The commercial for Capcom's **Beat 'Em Up Bundle** features three kids playing Capcom games at an arcade in The '90s, when suddenly Captain Commando appears beside them and asks them if they want to play those games at home. The kids say yes, so Captain Commando opens a time portal and brings them to 2018, where they can play those very games on the Nintendo Switch. Everyone's happy, but Cap then mentions that the portal's one-way only, meaning that the kids will never go back home again.
-   This British advert depicts a man being released from prison determined to improve his life and reconnect with his young son. He devotes himself to finding employment while spending time with his son and manages to get himself a job. With his ex-partner wishing him luck, things are looking bright...until the morning he is due to start work, as he is unable to get out of bed due to arthritis and is seen struggling to even move as his new boss gives up on him.
-   **The Myth of Orpheus and Eurydice** has Orpheus and Eurydice both make it out of the Underworld without looking back, and it seems he fulfilled Hades' condition... only it turns out he can't look back at her at **all**, and doing so after they've escaped sends Eurydice back to Hades.

-   In **Time Masters**, a ragtag bunch of space travelers are thrown back in time 60 years by an Omniscient Council of Vagueness made up of space aliens. Turns out that the little boy, Piel, is actually the same person as Silbad, the cheerful old man with them, and they just represent two different times in his life. Silbad has a Burial in Space all because the aliens felt it was right. Unnecessarily cruel?

Cruel Twist Ending Example in Gamebooks

-   A very, **very** common trope in **Choose Your Own Adventure** books, which take an extreme amount of pleasure in describing in great detail how many ways you get killed, even when everything up to the very last sentence leads you to believe that you reached a good ending.
-   Similarly, the **Give Yourself Goosebumps** books all have far more bad endings than good endings for the reader. Many involve the player dying horribly (getting Eaten Alive is pretty common), but readers can also end up permanently transformed into something awful (ex: an insect, a monster, or an immobile-yet-self-aware statue), enslaved or imprisoned, getting hopelessly lost, or simply missing out on the whole adventure.
-   These show up in the similar **Nintendo Adventure Books** as well. In one particular ending, you can have Mario knock down a brick wall with a hammer you found earlier in the quest (collecting certain items is necessary in all of these books)...after reading an entire page, the wall collapses **on him** in the **very last sentence**.

Cruel Twist Ending Example in Music

-   The country music standard "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia". The song starts off as the narrator talking about a murder that occurred in Georgia with a man murdering his unfaithful wife. The narrator mentions in the chorus that an innocent man was hanged. Near the end of the song, you learn that the innocent man was the betrayed husband. The true killer is the innocent man's sister. She killed her sister-in-law for cheating on her brother. So basically an innocent man was killed for a murder his sister committed. And she allowed her brother to die for her crime.

Cruel Twist Ending Example in Newspaper Comics

-   Zany gag strip and **Funky Winkerbean** spinoff **John Darling** (in)famously ended<small>◊</small> with the title character having his career ruined without ever achieving his dreams and then, completely out of the blue, being murdered on live TV by a crazed gunman. This was partially motivated by Tom Batiuk being in a contract dispute and wanting to discourage his syndicate from claiming and using the character, but Batiuk later stated the primary goal was to give the strip (which was on the verge of cancellation due to the TV pages - which the comic was usually run on due to its TV-oriented humor - being crowded out by the explosion in cable channels) a dramatic sendoff rather than let it "wimp off into the sunset."
    -   This turned out to be mere foreshadowing. Two years later, **Funky Winkerbein** itself (as well as **Crankshaft** to a lesser extent) made the jump from a zany gag strip to a depressing and grim drama where Cruel Twist Endings are the norm.

Cruel Twist Ending Example in Theatre

-   Martin McDonagh's **The Cripple of Inishmaan** is a Deconstruction of the various ways the media treats disabled characters— and especially how it likes to kill them off. And yet, it's set up in such a way that because of a fake-out death scene early in Act 2, the audience isn't suspecting that Cripple Billy **really will** be dying of tuberculosis. It also happens just when things are looking up for him.

Cruel Twist Ending Example in Visual Novels

-   **Bible Black** has this twice in the White Room ending, where you and your teacher are constantly fighting to stop the villain and her cohorts, and are subjected to a number of punishments that you get through using your wits and quick thinking. The two of you manage to reach the main villain at the last moment before she escapes her Deal with the Devil, the teacher pulls out a gun, and...hesitates, being unable to shoot until it’s too late. The villains win. Cut to a few days later and you show up late to class, pull out the gun, and shoot the villain in the head point blank, as well as her lead cohort. You tell the truth, get deemed insane, and locked in a white room at a psych facility, but are satisfied with justice being served. You’re then told you have a visitor, and it’s the villain, completely unharmed.
-   **Doki Doki Literature Club!**: The normal ending can be easily classified as this.

-   **Raging Loop** intentionally does this in its second true ending, A Wedding Celebrated By All. After snagging the final two wolves in a single Feast, where only three humans died in the entire route, Haruaki and Rikako announce their love for one another, he brings Meiko to the police station to hopefully find her home again, then sells all his things so he can live a happy, married life in Yasumizu with Rikako and the rest of the survivors. When he gets back, he finds everyone except Rikako and Nosato with their heads split open. He searches for the other two, and finds them in the meeting hall, where Nosato is holding an axe and babbling about how the wolves are coming...and Rikako hanging from a noose in the center of it. He then kills Nosato and jumps off the cliff at the Hanging Pine. The intentionally part ties in, when it's revealed very late in the game, the entire reason behind the cruel twist was that Rikako was behind the entire event the game is around, which requires the wolves winning the Feast alongside Rikako staying alive. She was responsible for all the death, as the timeline resets upon presumably everyone in the Feast's death. In spite of this, she was having second thoughts; a part of her did legitimately want to live happily with Haruaki.

Yukiri then reveals to a despairing Ryouji that she was manipulating him all along so to get information about the Minamoto clan. Ryuji is then captured and Yukiri mocks him for breaking the six rules before he's executed. **Another View** reveals she betrayed Ryuji in order to get love and recognition from her family...but the last words reveal that despite her intervention in the death of the Minamoto clan, her family is still cold to her and she's still as miserable as before.

Gouda was cursed by her patron to "always be the hero", meaning she is doomed to wander the Demi-planes of Dread for all eternity, spreading chaos in her wake. Krusk will follow Gouda for the rest of his life, unaware of just how damaging her actions are. Only Boshack had a happy ending.

These new apps eventually take over all the Americans' jobs.

He slips on a skateboard and narrowly avoids crashing into people carrying food or paint, but just when he thinks he's going to end up falling into a cake, he instead gets brutally impaled on a fence. Audience reaction is practically split down the middle on this one, with some calling it brilliant Dark Humour and others seeing it as disturbing, especially as it really is such a jarring shift in tone from the rest of the cartoon.
-   The **Let's Play Grand Theft Auto V** episode "The Grand Heist": The Fake AH Crew (Geoff, Jack, Ryan, Michael and Gavin) are able to escape into a Titan and take off with Ray pulling off a Heroic Sacrifice to get them all into the air.

-   "What If Wertham Was Right?" uses this trope for an **absolutely **vicious**** Take That! against Fredric Wertham's hypothesis about comic books inducing violence in children, widely publicized in **Seduction of the Innocent** and cited as a major contributor to the creation of the controversial Comics Code Authority. The premise being that Wertham's claim was true instead of being based on falsified data, the comic shows three kids discovering some comic books in the woods with one of them taking one home, only for the military to be called in when the book is discovered. The effect of the comics is demonstrated when the boy becomes a homicidal Enfante Terrible who slaughters all but one of the soldiers and his father, and is about to kill his mom as well when the surviving trooper shoots him down. Only afterward is it noted that **there were multiple comic books**, and it's then shown that many **other** kids have been turned into murderous berserkers as well. In the end, the mother and the soldier, the latter having turned his gun to his head, can only watch in horror as the entire neighborhood is overrun.
    
    **A now-deleted reply on Tumblr:** I wouldn't be surprised if this is what people literally think about most entertainment media.
    
-   Jon Bois has pointed out a number of these instances in the history of the Atlanta Falcons, in his 7-part documentary on the team. By far the most infamous of these was Super Bowl LI, in which the Falcons had a 28-3 lead over the Patriots, in a game that would be incredibly meaningful if they were to win. This would be the Falcons' first championship in the team's history, it'd knock the highly successful Patriots down a peg, and since this was happening only a few months after Donald Trump (who used to spend a lot of time with the Patriots) won the presidential election, the whole atmosphere of the game was highly politicized. Atlanta, and the rest of the country supporting them, **really** needed a win at this point. And then... the Patriots rallied in the last few minutes of the game, sent it to overtime, and won. Jon concludes that the falcon from the team logo must be some sort of cruel trickster god, playing a joke on all of football.
