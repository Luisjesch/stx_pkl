Apocalyptic Log: 
_"This is the audio log of research specialist Simon Garlick, dated August 10th, 2145. It's been two days now since I've seen any other team members. I don't know how I've survived this long or how I got away. They were just, uh... torn apart. Um... um..._ \[sighs\] _They could only be described as demons. I have never seen such a big thing move so quickly. Oh dear God, what has happened to us. The teeth. That's the last thing I remember seeing._ Teeth. _The sounds. Words I cannot describe. I'm sure it's just a matter of time before they find me again. I'm convinced they are toying with me, allowing me to stay two steps ahead of them. I... I can see them in the shadows sometime._ Why do they taunt me? _I'm not sure how much longer I... I... I... I can... I'm shooting at shadows here. And every moment, I feel them creeping closer toward me. Oh God. Oh God, we should never have—"_

— **Simon Garlick's audio log "Still Separated from Team"**, _Doom³_

A story is told through a log, diary, or journal that a character used to document their activities and progress through the backstory before something bad happened to its writer. A staple of Post-Apocalyptic Fiction to explain to the cast how the world ended up the way it is, it can also be used in horror as a handy way to fill in heroes who arrive Late to the Tragedy, and one of the first (or last) things that a "rescue" party answering a Distress Call will find when they arrive at the empty ship.

You can expect that whoever made this log will have recorded events up until their last breath. If the heroes (and thus the audience) choose to read this log from the beginning, the log will no doubt start and progress the same way, with hopeful characters recording the casual details of their lives and work, until things start going sideways and the entries shift towards concern, disbelief, desperation and/or (ultimately) insanity. The final — and usually the most important — entry may range from incoherent gibberish as the remaining character tries to warn the world of what happened to them, to a final cogent statement warning the reader not to repeat their mistake (or how to otherwise clean up after them).

This log can be written or recorded in a variety of ways; if it's a video log, the downhill progress of the situation will be punctuated visually, e.g. degradation in the appearance of the character, their surroundings, or even the video itself, perhaps with the Snowy Screen of Death on the last log. Bonus points if a video log's final entry shows the character ultimately succumbing to whatever horror took over, with blood splattering everywhere. If it's written, expect the open pages to be written clearly, but the last pages are an almost illegible scrawl, due to their panic. Grand prize if it's a written log that somehow _still_ records the author's final dying moments.

Depending on the timeframe and nature of the apocalyptic event, the log may have gone through Ragnarök Proofing in order to be legibly retrieved by the heroes.

See also Lost in Transmission, Distress Call, Late to the Tragedy, Action Survivor, Almost Dead Guy, Harbinger of Impending Doom, Send in the Search Team, Ignored Expert, Undead Author, Posthumous Character, Posthumous Narration, That Was the Last Entry. See also Video Will, the various times when the Cassette Craze applies to disappearances, and some of the less pleasant cases of Message in a Bottle. Found Footage Films are movies that use this as their framing device. Deadline News is a related trope where the very bad thing happens to the TV news crew reporting live on it; Unintentional Final Message is another related trope where the doomed sender doesn't know they're about to die.

Not to be confused with Post-Apocalyptic Dog, or the apocalyptic Loge from Richard Wagner's _Götterdämmerung_, or with the Captain's Log (but you can use one for this purpose), or with the result of consuming a Masochist's Meal with a Gargle Blaster. Occasionally overlaps with Blood-Stained Letter.

Apocalyptic Log Example in Anime & Manga

-   **3×3 Eyes**: near the end of the manga, after the seemingly total annihilation of humanity by Kaiyanwang's spell, Chen Ya Li is seen talking in a recorder, narrating how now that humanity has vanished, maybe the Earth could recover from all the enviromental damage and bloom once again, but also talks sadly about how centuries of human efforts to make a just and working society vanished without a trace. He even lampshades the fact that he doesn't even know why he's bothering doing this, being one of the last survivors.
-   **Attack on Titan** features one in the side-story "Ilse's Notebook" — about the titular Ilse Langner, a woman from the Survey Corps who religiously documented her activities and findings in a journal. Even as she's running for her life, she continues to write and she only stops when she's devoured by a Titan. It ends up being found a year later by Levi and Hange, and contains information that proves vital to the story later on. It reveals Ymir to be a person significantly connected to the Titans, but also provides the first hints that Titans may have very sinister and **human** origins...
-   Two are discovered in **Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet**:
    -   The first is in an OVA, when the Gargantia fleet stumbles upon a giant derelict fleet that's apparently been abandoned and rusting away for quite some time. Based on the captain's logbook Ridget finds, along with some detective work from Pinion in the engine room, some light bugs crystallized the main engine, rendering it useless, and forcing the survivors to get on smaller ships and sail away. It also gives Ridget some closure as a Flash Back of seven years earlier reveals her friend left Gargantia to go with a guy she met on this particular fleet, and she had been wondering what happened to them since then.
    -   A second one occurs in episode 9, when Ledo finds an old recording at the bottom of the ocean, which details humanity on Earth a long time back when it was starting to freeze up. The contents are a shocking revelation to him, and contradicts everything he'd been taught by the Galactic Alliance about their losing battle in the Forever War with the Hideauze aliens.It turns out that the Hideauze, which were also present on Earth, were genetically modified humans. The predecessor for the Galactic Alliance, the Continental Union, who believed humans should stay humans, were opposed to the genetic experiments performed by the Evolvers, who wanted to modify humanity so they could survive in space to leave behind an increasingly freezing and hostile Earth, and would later become the Hideauze. In space, both groups went to war with each other over their beliefs, while on Earth humans forgot about the Evolvers, and the Earth Hideauze gradually "evolved" into the "whale-squid" that humans generally stay away from and treat with some respect.
-   In the manga adaptation of **The Legend of Zelda: Oracle Games**, Link finds the logbook used by the ghost pirate crew, and realizes that they were stuck into a never-ending storm.
-   The horror manga **Mail** has a story titled "Portrait"; it starts with a woman picking up and arranging her sister's belongings after she had committed suicide via self-immolation and discovering her diary. The diary describes the last few weeks of her sister's life including finding a rare portrait and her growing obsession with it. It starts of with her trying to discover more about the painting, to learning more about the girl in the painting, to writing in her diary that she thinks there is something creepy going on in her apartment, to thinking that the source of the creepiness is that new painting she is so fond of to realizing that sometimes, the eyes of the sleeping girl would open up, to finally writing over and over again how she wants to die. When reading that last page, the woman who finds her sister's diary realizes that the last few pages handwriting slowly changes from her sister's handwriting to someone else's. When she realizes this, she looks at the portrait and realizes that it's looking straight at her. It turns out that the portrait of the girl still has the girl's spirit trapped inside due to the sympathy she got in life, cheering her to live on despite the fact that the only thing she ever wanted was to die and end her suffering and since then, has been committing suicide through the various owners of the portrait!
-   The Director's Cut of episode 21 of **Neon Genesis Evangelion** opens with a security video taken about a month before Second Impact. It starts off in a mundane way, picking up not only chatter from staff but a conversation between Gendo and Keel on the nature of scientists. Then with a crash, the scene cuts to the moment when Adam begins to grow into the Giant of Light, and we hear shouting from scientists trying to get the Angel under control. The picture cuts off just as Adam's giant, glowing hands reach into the frame. Similarly, all we see of the activation of Unit 04 is a mushroom cloud rising up from the test site, followed by static.
-   In **Ōoku: The Inner Chambers**, as Blessed Kasuga lay on her deathbed; knowing that a new outbreak of the Red-faced Pox was killing most of the boys in Japan, a severe famine was making inroads into the rest of the population, and the line of Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu was extinct save for a single unacknowledged female by-blow and her infant daughter; she ordered a record of the collapse of the country to be written by a young scribe employed within the most hidden areas of Edo Castle and named Chronicle of a Dying Day. Some 70-odd years later, Shogun Tokugawa Yoshimune called upon an ancient scribe living in a quiet corner of her harem in the hopes of learning more about some of the oddly illogical customs of her domain<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>. The **Chronicle** continues to be written up to the day the Tokugawa regime fell...and then is burned by the Meiji forces as part of their policy to hide any evidence Japan had been ruled by women, making the **Chronicle** All for Nothing.
-   **Pokémon: The First Movie**: Dr. Fuji records logs showing his team's eventual creation of Mewtwo. The final log shows their deaths at the mind of their enraged creation.
    
    **Dr. Fuji:** We dreamed of creating the world's strongest Pokémon... And we succeeded.
    
-   In the manga **7 Seeds**, most of humanity died out in an apocalyptic event. The "7 seeds" are people who were put into deep sleep far below the surface, and then woken and released far in the future when the Earth has become habitable again. However, it turns out they were not the only humans to survive past the event. The main characters later find one of many vast underground shelters built before the event, but nobody is alive there anymore. They find a desiccated body and a journal kept by one of the entertainers asked to come work in the shelter to raise morale. Most of the inhabitants of the shelters were deceived as to why they were there, but come to accept their new life; at first the outlook is hopeful, and there are other shelters they can communicate with. However, eventually technical problems cause the food supply to fall short, and many of the residents of the shelter are told they are to be sent off to another shelter - in reality they are going to be killed. Supplies dwindle and, in addition, eventually contact is lost with all other shelters, presumably because everyone is dead. The journal's author writes of how he and the people in charge fabricate new communications from the other shelters so that the residents won't lose morale. Finally a virus breaks out and slowly the entire population of the shelter falls ill and dies. As he dies the journal's author manages to trap the virus in a freezer where it cannot infect anyone else. His last act is to paint a X on the freezer door, and then he dies outside it with his journal.
-   **Tales of Wedding Rings**: In chapter 60, Amber leads the party into an abandoned underground dwarven city. They venture into the city's largest structure, a memorial, and discover a console containing a message left by the last of the dwarves. It details how the dwarves helped the Ring King to defeat the Abyss King, only to fall victim to an unbreakable curse which killed them all off one by one. The message was left so that people would know the dwarves once existed, and why they were now extinct.
-   **Uzumaki** features a map discovered in the ruins of an aging row house apparently drawn by someone who lived in the town during the last period when the Eternal Spiral awoke. The text on the map can't be read, but it appears to depict the final stages of the curse.

-   **Magic: The Gathering**: A number were posted on a special Wizards of the Coast website to fit the storyline of Scars of Mirrodin block — Farris of the Anvil, Unctus of the Synod, Kessla of Temple Might, Ria of Bladehold, and (technically) Roxith, Thane of Rot, a full-time bad guy. The final scorecard: Farris fighting a hopeless battle in the Phyrexian Furnace layer, Ria having saved her home city once but without a great deal of hope for next time, Roxith torn to shreds, Kessla killed by her own bomb, and Unctus corrupted by Phyrexian oil.

-   Brilliantly used in **Grendel** to illustrate the self-doubts and conflicts within Brian Li Sung, as he slowly succumbs to the Grendel identity. The brilliant part is that what at first seemed to be mere doodles in his journal's margins turn out to be the musings of the increasingly self-directing Grendel spirit, itself!
-   Doctor Strange's log in **Marvel 1602**.
-   Twitch's journal in **Spawn**.
-   **Superman**:
    -   In the **Supergirl** storyline **Bizarrogirl**, Jimmy Olsen's camera auto-uploads to the server of Daily Planet pictures of Jimmy being dragged for someone wearing an S-shield and disappearing in a smoke cloud.

    -   In **Last Daughter of Krypton**, Kara is watching a recording of Zor-El's last words (essentially: "Our world and all of us are about to die, but I hope you survive, my dear daughter—"), when her father is suddenly shot in his chest by some off-screen attacker. Zor-El lets out a shout of pain... and the recording abruptly ends.
    -   **The Killers of Krypton**: During one of his journeys across the galaxy, Z'ndr Kol finds the ruins of a ravaged Kryptonian outpost.

        **"More meteors breaking through the shielding! The radiation is affecting everyone! This is my last report! Good luck!"**
        
-   **A Town Called Dragon**: The viking ordered to take the dragon egg to present day Colorado kept a journal and ensured it as a warning to others, and doubles as an instruction manual on how to kill dragons.
-   **Transformers: More than Meets the Eye**: First-Aid records a log when the medical station is hit with a disease that causes the recipients to have their internal organs turned to liquid and cry out their eyes.

-   Dr. Delia Surridge's journal in **V for Vendetta**. In the graphic novel (though not the movie), she describes V's art projects in fascinated detail; these turn out to be intricate bombs and poisons that he later uses to destroy Larkhill and escape. The graphic novel also mentions that many pages are missing, leading to much speculation over what info they may have contained. Finch suggests that the missing pages contained information on V's identity and the reason he was imprisoned in Larkhill, also claiming that given where the journal was found in the police search that he deliberately placed it there so the government could collect it.
-   Rorschach's journal in **Watchmen**.
-   The entirety of the narration of **X-23: Innocence Lost** is in the form of a letter from Sarah Kinney wrote to her daughter and creation, X-23, in the event she was unable to tell her about her origins herself. Unfortunately, that's exactly what ended up happening. Even worse, because the letter was so badly fouled by Sarah's blood, Laura was never able to read it herself until she was given the copy Sarah had the foresight to also send to Wolverine just in case.
-   Phase IV of **Zenith** features one of these serving as the narration. Essentially Dr Michael Peyne's account of how the Lloigor apparently won the final battle and have free reign to turn the Earth into their own private playground, it's being written under especially trying circumstances: Peyne is virtually alone in a World of Chaos and he's been cursed to grow progressively younger at an increasingly rapid pace. For good measure, the Lloigor mockingly point out that this log is completely pointless, given that no human beings remain alive to read it and the Lloigor themselves will destroy the account along with all human history as soon as he's finished; however, Peyne makes it clear that he's writing this mainly because he has absolutely nothing better to do with what little time he has left. True to form, as he reaches the final stages of regression, Peyne's handwriting deteriorates into barely-coherent scrawls, until at last he gives up on the entire log to take a nap - during which he reverts to infancy and finally ceases to exist. However, it's soon revealed that the Lloigor aren't as victorious as Peyne thought they were...
-   The entirety of the illustrated novel **Zombies: A Record of the Year of Infection** is treated this way. The book is framed as a journal that was being kept by a young doctor attempting to survive the Zombie Apocalypse. It cuts off suddenly, mid journal entry, several days after the character reaches a supposedly safe haven. No explanation is given, and it is simply stated that the journal was recovered later, and no-one knows what happens to the journal writer, or the other people from the safe haven.

-   Hiro's Journal, one of Disney's **Big Hero 6** books, is a journal written by Hiro that continually goes downhill due to Tadashi's death, including aggressively scribbled out pages of solid black. Averted in that it takes an upturn at the end.
-   **Felidae**. The progressively alcoholic veterinary Dr. Preterius holds a pre-mortem camera diary of him and his two lab assistants trying to develop a new "**glue**" for organic tissue, by experimenting with homeless cats in his practice in his house's basement. The first trials lead to gruesome deaths of several cats, as the prototype glue turns out to be acidic. The next trials on a special homeless cat promptly named "Claudandus" are way more successful. However, they have to cut the agonized cat open again for further experimenting. Then, the experiment's funding is cut, and both of Preterius' lab assistants quit. Preterius, who is slowly succumbing to his alcoholism, keeps on working independently, and seemingly goes mad at the end when he claims Claudandus to be talking to him. It should be noted that **Felidae** is a crime story told from the viewpoint of a talking cat. Therefore, Preterius' ravings aren't as nutty after all.
-   In **Frozen II**, when Elsa and Anna find the wreck of their parents' ship, Anna immediately starts looking for the sealed waterproof compartment built into all Arendelle ships. Inside the compartment she finds a map of the ship's intended journey and a handwritten note from their mother on the map.
-   In **Suzume**, the titular character kept a diary as a child where she would draw a picture each day. When her hometown was destroyed by a tsunami, she instead blacked out the entirety of a page with marker for each day she was unable to find her mother. The final entry is a drawing of the door to the Ever After where she met her future self.
-   **Wall E**: before AUTO goes into "Override Directive A113" mode, he shows up one of those, where the President of Buy n Large, in the same set of an earlier message, only trashed to hell, says that Earth is unsalvageable.

-   **MonsterVerse**:
    -   **Skull Island: The Birth of Kong**: The supplementary materials includes the detailed notes of **Kong: Skull Island** character Bill Randa on the titular island and its inhabitants, which were evidently written during his time on the island before he met his death by a Skullcrawler during the movie.
    -   Randa attempts to make another one on his handheld camera in the Distant Prologue of **Monarch: Legacy of Monsters**, but a Mother Longlegs destroys the camera while chasing him. Instead, Bill throws his backpack containing plot-triggering Monarch files into the ocean, so that they'll be dredged up and read four decades after his death.

    Well, this is it. No more discussion to do.  
    I don't know much, but I know I should be trusting in... BEEEEEEEEEEEEP...**
    
-   "The Chariot" by The Cat Empire.

    When the news it had been telling me  
    About one more war and one more fight

    I thought about my friends

    And make it quick before they \[message redacted\]**
    
-   "Experiment IV" by Kate Bush.
    
    **Then they told us  
    All they wanted  
    Was a sound that could kill someone  
    From a distance.  
    So we go ahead,  
    And the meters are over in the red.  
    It's a mistake in the making.  
    ...  
    We won't be there to be blamed.  
    We won't be there to snitch.  
    I just pray that someone there  
    Can hit the switch.**
    
-   David Bowie:
    -   The last verse of "Space Oddity" details the last exchange between ground control and Major Tom when his communication circuit breaks down, leaving the latter stranded in space (presumably forever).
        
        **Ground Control to Major Tom  
        Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong  
        Can you hear me, Major Tom?  
        Can you hear me, Major Tom?  
        Can you hear me, Major Tom?  
        Can you....**
        
    -   Even more appropriate is Peter Schilling's answer to "Space Oddity", "Major Tom (Coming Home)":
        
        **Earth below us, drifting, falling  
        floating weightless, calling, calling  
        home...  
        Across the stratosphere a final message,  
        give my wife my love, then nothing more.**
        
    -   The acoustic version on the **Sound+ Vision** album even ends with a choked sob, and the Morse Code for S.O.S. repeating into the fade.
    -   Bowie's final studio album, **★**, was recorded while he was terminally ill with cancer. The album is loaded with themes about a man who knows he's not long for this world.
-   On a similar note, **Innuendo** was the final album that Queen released before Freddie Mercury succumbed to AIDS. Like Bowie's album **Blackstar**, many of the songs can be read as Mercury's final messages to the world, ranging in tone from frightened ("I'm Going Slightly Mad") to affectionate ("These Are The Days Of Our Lives") to courageous ("The Show Must Go On").
-   Dr. Jekyll sings an Apocalyptic Log in the musical version of **Jekyll & Hyde**.
-   “Minoans” by Giant Squid is a general story of about half a dozen apocalypses that destroyed the Minoans and their legacy. However, the song “Phaistos Disc” details how the Minoans struggled to survive and wanted to leave a record on the Phaistos Disc for future people to avoid their fate.
    -   No one can read it any more.

-   Billy Joel's "Goodnight Saigon" - the first two lines let you know that it doesn't end well.
-   Loudness's song **S.D.I.,** which is about a world going into nuclear war:
    
    **All the nations will be glowing  
    On their way to hell**
    
    **Angels of death are marching closer  
    The last supper's held  
    Here in the land you'll see no more  
    I'll see you in hell They call it war**
    
-   Similarly, EZO's **Fire Fire**, with the entire song describing nuclear war and the world after, with a plea at the end to stop the war before it happens. Lyrics here as the **entire song** is this.
-   Iron Maiden's "Satellite 15...The Final Frontier" is about a pilot in a damaged ship giving his last report.
    -   The title track of **The Number of the Beast**, which describes a man recalling a Satanic Ritual he witnessed, only for him to be consumed by it at the end.
-   "Pioneers over C." by Van der Graaf Generator, which, like "Space Oddity" deals with space exploration gone wrong:
    
    **We left the earth in 1983  
    Fingers groping for the galaxies  
    Reddened eyes staring up into the void  
    A thousand stars to be exploited  
    Somebody help me, I'm falling  
    Somebody help me, I'm falling down...  
    Into sky, into earth, into sky, into earth**
    
-   Rush's "Cygnus X-1" is about a space pilot flying his ship directly into the heart of a black hole. Subverted in the second part, "Hemispheres", where he comes out the other end.
-   mind.in.a.box's "Stalkers". By the sound of things, the singer is either suffering from a mental breakdown from paranoid schizophrenia, or being forcibly assimilated by a Hive Mind.
    
    **I can feel my thoughts dying out  
    so my last thought is just your name  
    and it is all that will remain...**
    
    -   Subverted in the later song "Overwrite", wherein the singer is implied to be an Artificial Intelligence in the process of being overtaken by what is revealed to be free will and self-awareness.
        
        **It is not too late...  
        To open my eyes.  
        To cure the blind.  
        It is not too late...  
        It is my decision.  
        It is my mind.**

-   The radio edit/commercial edit remix version of Violet UK's **Blind Dance.** It is an ambient sound / Spoken Word in Music / Electronic Music Apocalyptic Log of the end of the world. The line about the nuclear facilities became even Harsher in Hindsight after the Fukushima meltdown disaster. (The original song is Gothic Metal Intercourse with You and Obligatory Bondage Song.)
-   cosMo's Adventurous Girl and Miniature Garden Game starts out as a song about a cute little girl exploring a Sugar Bowl. At around two minutes in, the music video zooms out, superimposing the image of a heartbeat monitor onto the girl. She then discovers a pile of what appears to be stick figures with Xs drawn over their faces. The rest is a parade of really confusing imagery, which gets more and more distorted as the song goes on, while the beeping of the heartbeat monitor goes on behind the music. Eventually, the video starts glitching to the point when it's very difficult to see anything. The song ends with the girl saying she'll see everyone in the aforementioned Sugar Bowl again, and then fades out to the monitor flatlining. In a later song, it's revealed that the world that she's in is an artificial reality, and she has no idea what's going on.
-   Comedy Musician Stephen Lynch's **Dear Diary** series is diary entries by either celebrities or famous figures in history before something really bad happens to them. One example is: Christopher Reeve writing an entry about a horse he hopes to tame...
-   "Powderfinger", from Neil Young's ''Rust Never Sleeps', is written from the point of view of a young man defending his family farm from hostile invaders. He's shot and killed, and the final chorus acts as a kind of epitaph.
-   "Olkinainen" by the Finnish band Miljoonasade is about longing, but the lyrics are about writing a "should you find this letter" letter at night. In his longing the singer built a woman out of straw, and by now dancing and laughing on the roof of the barn with its head under its arm. As he finishes he leaves for the hoe and the gas canister.
-   This is effectively what Finnish Folk Metal band Moonsorrow's albums **Viides luku: Hävitetty** and **Varjoina kuljemme kuolleiden maassa** boil down to: the former depicts The End of the World as We Know It and the latter depicts life, such as it can be called, After the End.
-   "Nosferatu" by Blue Öyster Cult mentions an example in the form of a Captain's Log:
    
    The ship pulled in without a sound  
    The faithful captain long since cold  
    He kept his log 'til the bloody end  
    Last entry read: "Rats in the hold  
    My crew is dead, I fear the plague"

Apocalyptic Log Example in Poetry

-   Shel Silverstein combines this with Subverted Rhyme Every Occasion in some of his poems:
    -   "Boa Constrictor":
        
        **Oh no, he swallowed my toe  
        Oh gee, he's gotten my knee  
        Oh fiddle, he's up to my middle  
        Oh heck, he's up to my neck  
        Oh dread, he's** mmmmmfffff...''
        
    -   "The Slithery Dee":
        
        **...He came out of the sea;  
        He ate all the others,  
        But he didn't eat—SL-U-R-P...**

Apocalyptic Log Example in Podcasts

-   **The Message:** "If it kills us, they'll find us at our desks."
-   Halfway through the first season of **TANIS**, a recurring segment of a woman reading from the journal of an expedition to the titular Tanis begins. The journal chronicles the strange events and occurrences throughout the trip, never referring to anyone in the expedition by names, only titles: The Runner, the Novelist, the Zealot, and the Witness, who's writing the journal. The season finale reveals that the Witness is the show's host, Nic Silver.
-   **The White Vault** is told through the recovered audio logs of expeditions that went horribly wrong after the discover of bizarre, alien ruins. Seasons 1 and 2 are about an expedition to Svalbard, and Seasons 3 and 4 are about an expedition to the Pantagonian mountains.

Apocalyptic Log Example in Radio

-   Orson Welles' infamous radio version of **The War of the Worlds**:
    -   Commentator Carl Phillips<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> describes the effects of the Martian heat ray right up to the bitter end:
        
        **Phillips:** A humped shape is rising out of the pit. I can make out a small beam of light against a mirror. What's that? There's a jet of flame springing from the mirror, and it leaps right at the advancing men. It strikes them head on! Good Lord, they're turning into flame! **(screams and unearthly shrieks)** **Phillips:** Now the whole field's caught fire. **(explosion)** The woods... the barns... the gas tanks of automobiles... it's spreading everywhere. It's coming this way. About twenty yards to my right... **(crash of microphone, then dead silence)**
        
    -   An even better example is the announcer broadcasting from atop the CBS building in New York, watching the Martian's poisonous smoke drift across the city.
        
        **Announcer:** <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> Smoke comes out, black smoke, drifting over the city. People in the streets see it now. They're running towards the East River, thousands of them, dropping in like rats. Now the smoke's spreading faster. It's reached Times Square. People are trying to run away from it, but it's no use. They're — They're falling like flies. Now the smoke's crossing Sixth Avenue... Fifth Avenue... a hundred yards away... it's — it's fifty feet.... **(a thud, as he collapses)**
        
    -   Made even creepier with the other half of the Apocalyptic Log from the radio<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> immediately following: **"2X2L calling CQ... 2X2L calling CQ... 2X2L calling CQ... New York. Isn't there anyone on the air? Isn't there... anyone... 2x2L—" \*silence\*** Now remember that this was being portrayed as a news broadcast...
    -   And while the fake newscast portion of this show is what people remember, the last third of it abandoned the news format, instead taking the form of a reading from Pierson's Apocalyptic Log diary as he travels on foot from Grover's Mill to New York City.
-   The Big Finish **Dark Shadows** audio play **The House By The Sea** is told through a collection of tapes a man is leaving for his psychiatrist. The recordings tell of how the man, Gerald Conway, gradually tries to unravel the mysteries surrounding the house he has rented (rented because he kept seeing it in his dreams). Things start heating up when he keeps reporting finding human teeth throughout the house, he sees a ghost, records a conversation with Barnabas Collins (whose voice fails to appear on the tape) and holds a seance in which we hear him being briefly possessed by the assorted spirits who occupy the building. Of course, it all culminates in true Lovecraftian fashion when he breaks into the cellar, finds a human skeleton and a living shadow which starts making **pump pump** noises causing Conway to have a heart attack and the final moments reveal that he has been taken over by the freed remains of the warlock, Nicholas Blair.
-   In Season 2 of **Earthsearch**, the protagonists encounter Solaria, one of the orbiting artificial suns used when Earth was being moved to another solar system, now adrift in space. They search through the hologram recordings left by its crew to find out where Earth went, but only find routine technical reports. Until they play an unlabelled disk that shows the commander of Solaria calling on Earth to cut the tractor beams holding Solaria in orbit because its artificial intelligence has gone insane and is about to burn up a city unless its demands are met. The commander is then killed by a welding android controlled by Solaris.

Apocalyptic Log Example in Roleplay

-   In **The Gamer's Alliance**, Nymgrock finds the elven sages' forgotten diaries which chronicle the first spread of the Blood Fever which occurred hundreds of years earlier. The first entries show some curious, out of the ordinary events in the sages' lives. However, as the entries progress, the effects of the Blood Fever start showing up in more gruesome ways and the writings become increasingly desperate and terrified, eventually culminating in the respective final entries where the writers perform a Heroic Sacrifice to end the plague. It doesn't work because the plague shows up deadlier than ever in the present day, which has been the very reason Nymgrock sought out the diaries in the first place to find information about what could be causing the plague.
-   Several notes in **Ruby Quest**, particularly Filbert's journal, detailing his... tests... of the limits of the treatment. It's a Cosmic Horror Story where everyone has recurring amnesia, so what else would you expect?

---
Apocalyptic Log Example in Theatre

-   Conversed in **Mary Mary**, where Mary, blaming Bob for being too analytical, compares him to "those people who take an overdose of sleeping pills, and sit there making notes while they're dying: '4 A.M. Vision beginning to blur.'" (Later in the play, Bob does in fact take an excessive but non-fatal dose of sleeping pills.)

Apocalyptic Log Example in Theme Parks

-   At Disney Theme Parks, one of these can be heard while waiting in line for the **Jungle Cruise** ride.
    -   The queue for **Expedition Everest** features a museum about previous failed expeditions on the mountain. Among them are photographs which began to track the yeti, and the last ones show the group being attacked.
-   At Busch Gardens Williamsburg, **Curse of DarKastle** is an Apocalyptic Log... set into an Endless Loop.
-   The plot of Curse of Pompeii and many other Howl-O-Scream attractions is often one of these, too.
-   Universal's Halloween Horror Nights occasionally uses this on their websites to build up the storyline for the houses and scarezones. A notable example was the 2004 house, Disorientorium, supposedly a Wonderworks-style tourist attraction based around disorientation and illusions. Most of the story is told through the Blackberry of a man who became more and more obsessed with the attraction, to the point of breaking in and gradually losing his faculties, until the final entry is a blood-splattered phone with a bullet hole in the screen and a garbled message frozen below it.

Apocalyptic Log Example in Visual Novels

-   **Analogue: A Hate Story** and its sequel **Hate Plus** revolve around reading through the archives of the **Mugunghwa**, a Korean Generation Ship that had been drifting derelict and lifeless for some six hundred years before being found again. The Player Character is a Private Investigator hired by a historical society to figure out what the hell happened. Unusually, the log entries are presented in Anachronic Order.
-   The **CLANNAD** visual novel, **Kotomi's route**, her parents left her a testimony and a teddy bear in a briefcase despite many important scientific files being contained in it, and they wrote the testimony **during** a horrible airplane crash.
-   In the visual novels of **Higurashi: When They Cry**, The TIPS show that Shion kept a journal as she was going mad due to Hinamizawa Syndrome. Although you actually do get to see many of the events that the journal refers to, it gives a closer look into her mind as the events unfold and ends with the "Notebook of Happiness" entry, which ends, as you might guess from the ironic title, "I'm sorry for having been born". Naturally, it was cut from the anime.
-   Parodied in **Sunrider Mask of Arcadius**. The second half of the game begins with Ava composing a log about how the Sunrider's crew has been marooned for months on a desolate planet, how the chain of command is breaking down and how it falls to her to restore order and prevent a mutiny... only for Asaga to interrupt the dictation, revealing that they're just on shore leave at a beach resort. Ava, being an uptight workaholic, is simply going stir-crazy.
-   In **Umineko: When They Cry**, the first arc ends with a note written by Maria Ushiromiya that relates to the murders that took place on the island of Rokkenjima in 1986. Later on, it's revealed that the note was actually written by Yasu, who is also revealed to have written the first and second arcs; they washed up on the mainland in message bottles.
-   In **Virtue's Last Reward**, you'll find a diary in one of the safes. Phi translates it to reveal it's what has happened in the wake of Radical 6: bodies are just piled up to the point flies are blocking out the sun while cats are getting fat off the rats that come to nibble on those iles.
-   Professor Imagawa in **YU-NO** left one of these to chronicle her last days after becoming trapped underground. While she eventually discovered the way out, she grew too weak to actually take that method of escape and instead wrote down how to do it. Unfortunately, the solution is no longer at her body because Takuya wasn't the first one to find her, so he has to figure it out himself.

Apocalyptic Log Example in Web Animation

-   The Gamebook-style video series **The Journal of Morning Mist**, based on **My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic**, features Morning Mist going to a seemingly-deserted island and finding evidence of a Religion of Evil that worships an Eldritch Abomination known as "Mother", and writing about what he finds. Whichever path the viewer chooses, the expedition all goes to hell quickly, and none of the paths end well for Morning Mist. Some entries feature him getting brainwashed by the cult, some feature him dying from Mother making him tear his own eyes out, and a few have him begging for help after the cult captures and tortures him. Even the entries where Morning Mist isn't dead, tortured or indoctrinated are ambiguous, but the implications are clearly unpleasant.
-   Gleefully parodied along with several other horror game cliches in the "Oh the Horror" segment of this Flash game released for April Fools' Day.
    
    "I have never kept a journal before, but I figured that the occasion of moving into that house where that occult-inspired mass suicide happened 30 years ago was an excellent time to start."
    
-   **If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device**: One of the letters sent to the Emperor in the second Q&A session takes this form, written by a man left behind on a world affected by the Tyrant Star. Notable for containing almost no humor in it at all, with the exception of a mention of a "hyper-realistic Furby" (which cried 666 liters of blood as the Star's influence reached its peak). It's mentioned that the letter was discovered sealed in a box on a ruined planet devoid of life, explaining how it got delivered.
    
    "The scratching at the walls has stopped. They come."

Apocalyptic Log Example in Webcomics

-   **8-Bit Theater**
    -   In issue 522: The descent into sanity, the Light Warriors end up trapped in an ice cavern: Black Mage keeps a journal over the next five days, documenting the group's growing insanity as they explore the caves and their infestation by horrors from beneath the earth. Subverted when it's realised that Black Mage has gone temporarily insane, and the experiences he records in the journal never happened.
    -   Later, when they travel to the sunken Sea Shrine in a submarine which is **really** their aptly-named airship "The Deathtrap", Black Mage falls into a spoken version. After he tells you of his team's decent into madness, Red Mage tries to tell him it's only been a few hours since they started the journey. Black Mage keeps narrating with something to the effect of "I ignored the gibberish which sprouted from my former teammates misshapen lips." Apparently he really likes doing this. Or he just wants to see them all dead. As usual.
-   **American Barbarian**: One of the survivors of "The Great Clusterfuck" claims that it really did live up to its name; everything that could have caused the apocalypse **happened all at once**. It was so confusing that they built a time machine just to record exactly what went wrong, even though they knew they didn't have a chance in hell of preventing all those things going off at the same time.
-   If the Junior Biovessel Explorers in **Awful Hospital** had valued self-preservation over writing journal entries, they'd have been able to write more journal entries.
-   **Homestuck**

Apocalyptic Log Example in Web Original

-   There's a web-only story which isn't an apocalypse log, but a diary found in a life raft out at sea. The sole survivor of a shipwreck saw dolphins around her all the time and believed that she was turning into one; the last entry is more or less a heavily misspelled variant of "Flippers are useless. Fuck it, I'm going into the water."
-   **The Journal of Kith** chronicles one dwarf's ill-fated quest to re-discover the ruins of an (in)famous dwarven fortress — Boatmurdered.
-   A web programmer who has seen too much reports back from the abyss.
-   The "Active Area" entry in the "That Insidious Beast" series from Something Awful. It's written by an everyman rather than a scientist, but it does describe unspeakable horrors and it also ends with his suicide.
-   The forum game is especially creepy due to the fact that it's never implied what's really going on. Justified in that an unexplained setting would practically make it easier for people to write logs as creepy as they can imagine them since the mystery would remove most limits to their logs, allowing them to establish any horrific event as probable since there are no specific details to abide by.
-   The Alternate Reality Game viral campaign for the Nine Inch Nails album **Year Zero** is a wide collection of barely decypherable websites That describe a Crapsack World. These websites are sent from the future by a team of computer programmers and quantum physicists as a warning to those of us living in the time of the events triggered their circumstances. Bonus points for one entry written by a White House aide describing the monster sent to allow the Earth to... shall we say, start over.
-   The blog **The Darth Side** records the thoughts of Darth Vader from Episodes 4-6, ending with Vader preparing to take Luke to their final meeting with the Emperor.
-   Stars, a story in **The Wanderer's Library**, describes the stars descending to earth and destroying The Land of Elrich as punishment for returning to ways of violence and warfare.
-   **The Sick Land**, the blog of a researcher posted at a remote station on the fringes of an Eldritch Location.
-   Two of Robert Brockway's **Cracked** columns focus on him taking a series of drugs, driving him steadily more insane until concluding with a note from Dan O'Brien describing his behavior at the point where he can write no further - the first, nootropics (which according to Dan, were all actually cocaine in false packaging), the second, various methylphenidate formulations and a natural ADD "remedy" that turned out to have a dangerous interaction with the methylphenidate.
-   One **RPC Authority** record contains a log of anomalous disasters ravaging the planet in an Alternate Timeline, in addition to documentation of an experimental drug with extremely detrimental side effects. In possession of these documents was RPC-101, a dimension-hopping, mindless Humanoid Abomination called "The Refugee".
-   Numerous **SCP Foundation** records.
    -   Notably the personnal journal of Dr. Bishop. Attempted rape on machine goddesses is bad, especially if you're a cyborg, m'kay?
    -   Perhaps more notable is the rather chilling, not to mention, literal, example revealed by SCP-093.
    -   SCP-1025 is a subversion. There was no threat. All the SCP does is make people **think** that other people are infected with horrible diseases. After the research staff go completely out of control with hypochondria-by-proxy, somebody from O5 comes along and just sticks the SCP in a box somewhere.
    -   **Document Recovered From The Marianas Trench**
    -   SCP-370 has Incident-370-A, a personal log written by the Foundation doctor in charge of the expedition that found SCP-370. It details the progressive infection and death of expedition personnel caused by SCP-370's influence. Although he had been infected himself, he managed to use a ritual (which required 80% of his blood supply) to contain it. It ends with a That Was the Last Entry that breaks off in mid-sentence.
    -   SCP-772 ("Giant Parasitoid Wasps"). The scientist who discovered the wasps kept a journal. It details how he found a body filled with wasp larvae, let them hatch and contained them, and how they escaped, attacked and implanted eggs in him. It ends with a That Was the Last Entry of him cutting himself open so the larvae could escape.
    -   SCP-827 ("The Soup"). Dr. George Farrow was suffering from cancer and had less than six months to live. He tried to cure himself with stem cell therapy and ended up changing himself into a mass of protoplasm.
    -   SCP-930 ("Seagull Island"). One of the survivors of the wreck of the U.S.S. Kete kept a journal of his experiences. One by one the other 18 survivors vanished in the night, apparently just walking away. The remaining survivors sometimes found the bodies hanging in the trees, but none of the others ever came back. The last survivor saw glimpses of something in the bushes that was worse than anything he'd ever seen.
    -   SCP-1811 ("Shelf Life"). SCP-1811's previous owner, Adrian Balswell, kept a diary explaining how he discovered and experimented with it. It ends with a That Was the Last Entry about how he was going to burn one of the books in SCP-1811. Only the burnt cover of the book was found - Adrian Balswell had disappeared.
    -   SCP-1983 ("Doorway to Nowhere") is an extensive one, left by one of the many agents sent inside, the last one left alive when he wrote it. It details what he saw, how the creatures he saw inside work and reproduce, and what he thinks may work to take them down, punctuated with several statements of hopelessness. He finishes saying he'd leave the report where it could be found, and then make sure the creatures wouldn't be able to use his heart for their nest. When they finally found the note, the SCP had been neutralized by a surprisingly heroic and undeniably badass D-Class (read: a death row convict whose entire job at the Foundation is to be an expendable guinea pig For Science!). He didn't manage to survive, but it's assumed he found the note and followed its instructions. He was posthumously awarded the Foundation Star for his sacrifice.
        
        **Good luck. Morituri te salutant**
        
    -   SCP-2249 ("The Failed Dreamland"). A medical doctor is taught how to create a small idyllic universe so the children in a hospital have a place to play. Things go terribly wrong and the new universe ends up filled with gamma radiation, with the doctor dying after being trapped inside of it.
    -   SCP-2661 ("The Hoof Diary"). A man who took an anomalous drug was compelled to build an enormous maze. After he did so a cow-like humanoid appeared out of the maze, killed him and ate him. The man left a diary describing his increasing compulsion to build the maze and worship the being who would appear from it.
    -   Bees, which documents the author's Sanity Slippage as everything around him becomes bees.
    -   The entry for SCP-3001 is accompanied by the logs of a researcher trapped in a pocket dimension with dangerously low levels of reality, going mad from loneliness as his body slowly disintegrates.
    -   SCP-ES-19, a pair of headphones that tune to transmissions of several human extinction scenarios. Not all of them are described, but these include implied extraterrestrial invasions, nuclear wars, genocide, and the use of humans as cattle for food. This is bad already, but on an certain percent of times, the listeners begin to suffer of aftereffects of said event, from becoming convinced of what actions should have been taken to prevent it, to presenting PSTD and physical effects related to what they listened.
    -   SCP-4823 ("The Whole World Has Gone Bananas!"). A fruit fly accidentally hitches a ride with one of our Foundation agents to an Alternate Universe populated by humanoid fruit and starts laying eggs. 6 months later, a journal written by a teenage girl is spat out of our end of the portal, detailing how her whole world and everyone she loved was utterly annihilated by The Swarm.
-   **The Death of Basketball** details Jon Bois's attempt to kill the NBA in **NBA 2K** by feeding it only the worst possible players.
-   Twilight's Journal, a **My Little Pony: Equestria Girls** audio log by Wubcake. In the journal, Twilight details a Crapsack World where the Dazzlings have taken over Canterlot, and she's using magical research to figure out how to stop it. While Twilight does make progress, it's only by kidnapping and killing people as unwitting test subjects. As Twilight gets more affected by guilt, her Superpowered Evil Side Midnight Sparkle arrives as a split personality, who has far looser morals than Twilight does. Twilight even turns to alcohol to block out Midnight. Eventually, Midnight kills Twilight's dog Spike to provide them with an Equestrian magic source, which makes Twilight hit the Despair Event Horizon. Even though the ending implies that Twilight's device worked and that the Dazzlings are gone, Twilight is Driven to Suicide because of her guilt.

-   **NOC +10**: Two videos contain audio of someone besides the machine talking, one of which involves them desperately calling for help as the station floods.
-   ProtonJon was one of many who dared to try **Kaizo Mario World**. His breakdown over the ridiculous, soul-crushing difficulty of the game became the stuff off legend.
    
    **Proton Jon:** **(audibly on the verge of tears)** MOVE FASTER POKEY!
    
-   It is very common in **The Slender Man Mythos** for the stories to be told in an Apocalyptic Log format. But then, if you're writing about seeing Slendy, that means you've seen him, and if you've seen him, it means he let you...
    -   **Everyman HYBRID**:
        -   Doctor Corenthal's reports, which are left in bags for viewers to find. The weirdest part is that the three patients he mentions have the same names as the main characters, despite the reports supposedly being written in the 1970s.
        -   "The Princeton Tapes" featured audio and writings from multiple Vinnies existing in different iterations, where he detailed his situation; the tapes end after one of the Vinnies met up with a doctor at Corenthal's old hospital, and suddenly collapsed, dying.
        -   HABIT's updates on "Can You See The Words?" included blogs written by people HABIT was torturing, speaking about their situation and what HABIT was doing to them, shortly before they ended up dying.

His Red Lion is critically damaged with only 10 minutes of oxygen left and only enough power to send a single message. He starts a recording, explaining that the unthinkable has happened and that the Galaxy Alliance must now prepare for King Zarkon's attack. As he sends it out, the eyes of the Red Lion wink out, the computer is able to tell him goodbye before shutting down.
    
    **Sgt. Lance Rainier:** Someday, somehow, Voltron will rise again to become the defender that this great universe deserves. Until that day, Godspeed. Good Luck. Red Lion, out.
    
-   In **Winter of '83**, various audio and video clips are shown, detailing the fall of the sleepy town of Fawn Circle, MN. There's also a set of tapes showing **how** this came to be.

**Well, that about wraps it up for... Good God! What's that coming out of the garbage disposal — eeeeyahh! glub, glub. . . .**
