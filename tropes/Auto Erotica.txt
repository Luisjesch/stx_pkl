Auto Erotica: 
Follow

An important criterion when choosing a new car.

_"Automobiles. A type of land vehicle used for transport. Also used in teenage mating rituals."_

Two characters have sex in the back seat of a car. Extra points if it's somewhere with a name like "Make-Out Point", or in the back of a Shag Wagon made for this purpose.

Being in the back seat, while typical, isn't 100% required. It also happens in the front seat, though it's more cramped. A different kind of bonus points if it takes place _while one of them is driving_ (which is absolutely possible but extremely dangerous just from a distraction standpoint).

Moral or divine punishment for Auto Erotica (particularly at an isolated Make-Out Point) often manifests itself in the form of a Serial Killer on a prison break looking for fresh meat, a cop making his rounds, or an overprotective knight templar father armed with a shotgun or a baseball bat and out to defend his daughter's purity. Other forms of interruption, with varying levels of humiliation, abound.

Truth in Television, obviously — the romantic potentials of cars have been recognized from the beginning of the automotive age. The Edwardians dubbed them "brothels-on-wheels". Teenagers have been, and largely remain, the traditional people portrayed as doing this, due to not having privacy at home, and not being able to afford a hotel room. Not as common as it used to be, as today both parents usually have full-time jobs, giving teens more opportunity for time alone in the house, but it's still there.

Not to be confused with sexual attraction/relationships with cars, robots, or vacuum cleaners, sexy people posing on the outside of cars, (or actual autoerotica). It is also not to be confused with Car Porn (where the "porn" part is metaphorical).

Supertrope of Don't Come A-Knockin', where the car is noticeably rocking around.

Compare Mile-High Club (having sex in an airplane in flight).

## Examples:

Auto Erotica Example in Advertising

-   In this Chrysler Concorde commercial, Savannah learns that she was named after the place where she was conceived, and so was her baby sister, Concorde.
-   Around 1970, a rather innocuous European car (Renault?) had a magazine ad touting its qualities as macho, including seats that folded down into a bed (later ads dropped a line about 'extending your manhood' at that point).
-   A Peugeot ad consisted of little more than a couple having (very enthusiastic) sex in the advertised car.
-   This Volkswagen ad has a couple enjoy some quality time in their car. Cut to them buying a new Volkswagen with a kid. Then they do it a second time and buy a new Volkswagen with a second kid. Then a third time, same results. The final shot has their newest vehicle shaking... from the shenanigans of the kids inside.
-   In a commercial for State Farm auto insurance, a teen girl just got her own car with her own insurance and no longer needs to drive her parents' hand-me-down. The parents present said car as a "surprise" gift to her younger brother, who laments that he'll never get a date in this car. The dad says "We had a lot of great dates in this car," much to the son's disgust.
-   In a TV ad for a classical music radio station, two cars (a Camaro and a Volvo) are parked at "Make-Out Point" overlooking the city below. Both cars are rocking on their shocks, and we can hear music coming from both: pop music from the Camaro and classical music from the Volvo. After a few seconds the pop music ends and the Camaro stops rocking, but the classical music and the Volvo's motion continue. As the camera pans up to view the stars overhead the voiceover announces, "The average pop song lasts three and a half minutes, but the average classical song is fifteen minutes..."

Auto Erotica Example in Anime & Manga

-   In **Fairy Tail: 100 Years Quest**, when Earth-Lucy asks Edolas-Lucy how she and Edolas-Natsu ended up getting married, the latter says that "he came really strong on her" when they were in his car.
-   A chapter of **Futari Ecchi** is dedicated to this trope. Containing useful advice (both social and hygienic) on how to do it properly. (Like explanations on why it's inadvisable to do it on the front seat or why it's preferable to turn off the lights.)
-   **Initial D**:
    -   One episode has Takumi and Natsuki making out in Takumi's Trueno, to the point where we see the car rocking for a bit.
    -   Subverted in the Second Stage OVA when Itsuki literally sleeps with a girl in his Levin.
-   In the **Junjou Romantica** manga, this happens in a parking garage after Misaki sprains his ankle and Usagi-san (of course) comes to his rescue.
-   **Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans**: Mikazuki and Atra were only even **able** to have sex in a mobile suit cockpit (or perhaps floating around right outside it). Thanks to abusing his suit's Brain/Computer Interface, Mikazuki was half-paralyzed whenever he wasn't hook up to it.
-   In a flashback in Episode 10 of **Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt**, Fastener had sex with a cheerleader in his convertible.
-   **Revolutionary Girl Utena** employs this trope in a way that deliberately makes it unclear how just what kind of business people are getting up to. Every major character takes a ride in the "Akio Car", and the car itself explicitly represents the world of adulthood - it is powerful, sexy, and seems simultaneously luxurious and sleazy.
    -   On the more literal end, Akio indulges Wakaba's girlish crush on him by taking her for a drive, which is the most innocuous use of the car in the show. This leads into Akio's seduction of Utena in the car as Anthy looks on from afar. The Duellists' rides to the End of the World are more subject to interpretation. There are psychosexual implications for all of them, and Ruka and Shiori pretty obviously have sex in the back seat, but the ride takes on different sorts of meanings for each of the characters.
    -   All of this contributes to an automotive/driving-based symbolic language, and the show puts it to devastating use in the episode where Utena has (dubiously consensual) sex with Akio to convey aspects of Utena's feelings about this event that she is barely even consciously aware of.
-   Happens in **Sekai-ichi Hatsukoi** when Ritsu and Takano go on a date on Takano's birthday. It gets a Sexy Discretion Shot in the anime adaptation. Ritsu later claims his memories of Takano's car aren't exactly good as a result.

Auto Erotica Example in Comic Books

-   **Scott Pilgrim** and Kim Pine are seen doing this in a flashback.
-   "Hot Rod Boogie", generally regarded as the first true **Cherry Comics** story, is all about this.
-   **Domino Lady**: In the Eros Comix miniseries, Domino Lady and Det. Rob Wyatt start having sex in the back of Ellen's limousine when they are affected by the Mind-Control Music. Their liaison is cut short when Delglyn drives the car off a bridge and into the river.
-   **Red Ears**: One gag has a young couple having sex in a car. The girl then says the guy was great and she adds that the fact that it was "their first time" was the most exciting part. The next shot shows the guy tick off another stripe on the side of his car.
-   Averted in **W.I.T.C.H.**: a minor character tries this on Irma, who was using her older and more attractive Guardian form to flirt with him, but she wasn't ready and accidentally turned him in a toad.

Auto Erotica Example in Fan Works

-   In the second season of **Children of Time**, the Holmeses have their first time since their reunion in the back of Beth's police cruiser. ...they really **did** wait a **very** long time for this.
-   This **Engine Sentai Go-onger** fanfic involving Sosuke and Miu making love in the backseat of his car. Much like the **Misfiled Dreams** example above, it's lampshaded due to the major car motif of the Go-ongers.
-   In **Forbiden Fruit: The Tempation of Edward Cullen**, two gay men and a gay **panda** all manage to fit in the back of a car to have a three-way. The fact that a panda took part (and owns the car) means the car was most likely a semi-truck of some description.
-   In a deliberate reference to **NCIS** (see Live-Action TV, below), in **From Bajor to the Black** Eleya loses her virginity with another member of her training platoon in the back of an infantry fighting vehicle.
    
    **Author's Note:** Bajorans are basically post-Holocaust space Jews in a lot of ways and Eleya’s a badass action girl, so what the hey?
    
-   **Guys Being Dudes**: There's a flashback of Candela and Arlo making out in the back of her car when he comes out to her. Spark and Arlo do the same in Arlo's car after their visit to the Sleepless Bakery.
-   In one HookerVerse fic, The Cinema Snob has sex with the Critic in the back of his limo.
-   KITT Copycat had Pepper and Tony having sex at the back of his car while 'JARVIS was driving'.
-   One chapter of **Meg's Boyfriend** had Meg and Zack doing it **in a tank**. Of course, it's not at all comfortable, and they end up blasting Cleveland's house.
-   Naturally, since **Misfiled Dreams** has cars as a major theme like the original story, this had to happen at least once. It's even lampshaded with the line "Somehow… I knew we’d wind up doing this in a car."
-   In **My Immortal**, Draco and Enoby have sex in Draco's flying car.
-   **My Old Kentucky Home**:
    
    **Harry:** Whoa is that an E type \[Jaguar\]?  
    **Lily:** I told you Sirius was nuts about cars. Back before you were conceived he and James had a stupid Dodge Charger brought over they rebuilt. That might actually have been where you were conceived after I think about it.
    
-   In Timing is Everything, Beast Boy and Raven have their first time in the T-Car. Cyborg (who considers the car his "baby") doesn't find out until it turns out Raven became pregnant during that time, at which point he is really upset at his car being desecrated, demands to be the child's godfather and forces Beast Boy to clean the car something like 50 times straight. Then Beast Boy recommends that Starfire sits in the car during the next IVF attempt... the Law of Inverse Fertility has been at work for her and Robin a bit too hard the last time.
-   **Vow of Nudity**: Fiora keeps a succubus company in her carriage while Haara's washing the outside to pay off a debt.

    It doesn't work.
    
-   **Animal House** includes a scene in which Babs is implied to have given Greg Marmalard a hand-job in his car - this isn’t shown, she appears sitting in the front seat, removing a rubber glove...

-   Subversion: in **Back to the Future**, George McFly intervenes to **prevent** Biff from raping George's future wife Lorraine in Biff's car. Then again, Lorraine seems like she may or may not be trying to get someone else in the backseat before Biff shows up. Specifically, Marty.
-   **Beast (2017)**: At one point, Moll and Pascal have sex in his truck. It gets a Cerebus Call-Back when she and Pascal are driving down the road at the end of the film, and, having learned that, he's the killer, Moll grabs the steering wheel and drives them off the road, killing him.
-   **Bedazzled (1967)**: Stanley wishes for himself and the woman he loves to be really nice people, madly in love with each other, in a cozy domestic setting - and ends up in just that scenario...with her married to his best friend. They try trysting in her car, but they're **so** nice that they're positively grievous with guilt for even trying it.
-   **Beyond the Valley of the Dolls**: Harris has sex with Ashley in the back of her Rolls Royce. During the act, Ashley keeps talking about how nothing compares to sex in a Rolls. "Not even a Bentley!"

-   The B-movie **The Chase (1994)** with Charlie Sheen and Kristy Swanson features their characters having sex in a car. **While Sheen is driving.** **And being chased by police.**
-   Being an Awful British Sex Comedy, this trope is naturally present in **Confessions of a Driving Instructor**, although Timmy Lea finds out repeatedly that having sex in a car (a British car at that) is quite difficult.
-   Bizarrely exaggerated in **The Counselor**. In one of the movie's most infamous scenes, the drug dealer Reiner recalls his girlfriend Malkina once telling him that she wanted to "fuck \[his\] car"; he assumed that she wanted to have sex with him **in** his car, but she assured him that she meant exactly what she said. In a flashback scene, Malkina then proceeds to bring herself to orgasm by masturbating herself against the windshield of Reiner's car while he watches. It Makes Just As Much Sense In Context.
-   **Crank**: Chev gets Eve to do this to him while they're being chased by gang members.
    -   He's **very** upset that she doesn't finish the job, but she points out that he needs to keep his adrenalin **up**, not fall asleep immediately after. In frustration, he walks out and shoots the bad guys, much to Eve's horror.
        -   Then again, it could be payback for **him** not finishing the job earlier in the movie, when he forced her to have sex in public in front of dozens of people (she resisted at first but got really into it later).
-   The opening scene of **Death Screams** provides a variation with two lovers on top of a motorcycle.
-   Parodied and Averted in **Dragnet**, in a scene where Streebek tries to figure out where Friday is:
    
    **Streebek:** For a minute I pictures him introducing Ms. Swail to the one piece of his equipment not issued by the department. But then, I figured Joe Friday wouldn't be the type to spring for some third-rate motel. And since making love in a Yugo was a scientific impossibility, I knew something was up.
    
-   **Dressed to Kill**: Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson), a sexually unsatisfied suburban housewife, both seduces and is seduced by a handsome stranger in the Metropolitan Museum of Art; he consummates the seduction by dangling her glove (which she'd taken off earlier as a flirtation tactic) from the window of a taxicab.

''"I was conceived in the Riviera …but not the French Riviera. The Detroit variety."'

-   At the beginning of **GoldenEye**, James Bond seduces his evaluator after a car chase in his Aston Martin DB5. He even has champagne and glasses stashed in the center console to help things along.

-   In **Heathers**, J.D. and Veronica rapidly strip and pretend to engage in this, after having killed a couple of football players, when a couple of police officers approach. The next scene opens with them still in the car, J.D. with his clothes and hair slightly disheveled and Veronica lying down with her head in his lap, mirroring an earlier scene where they were cuddling just after having had sex. Some viewers have taken this to mean something **else** happened offscreen, but it's never stated outright.

-   This happens twice in **K-9**. The film opens up showing two people making out heavily in their car, though no nudity is presented. The other scene is when the dog, Jerry Lee, spots a poodle in the other car in front of him.

-   Subverted yet played straight in the movie **Once Bitten**. Mark Kendall (Jim Carrey) tries to get to first base with Robin Pierce (Karen Kopkins) but she doesn't want to make out with Mark, especially in an ice cream van.

Poor Mark.

    -   Tony has sex with Annette later, but stops when he finds out she's not "fixed" (no pill, no "IOU", no diaphragm). The implication of course is that he wasn't using a condom. At least it averts Can't Get Away with Nuthin'.

-   **Tragedy Girls** begins with what appears to be the standard opening for a slasher film: a blonde girl and her boyfriend making out in the backseat of a car with steamed-up windows at the local make-out spot (in this case, a covered bridge). The girl hears a noise and sends the boy out to investigate. However, when the Serial Killer does show up, the film goes in a completely different direction.
-   In the first part of **Transformers (2007)**, Bumblebee seems to be trying to encourage Sam and Mikaela to do this. The situation is made weirder by the fact that Bumblebee **is** the car. The ending scene shows Sam and Mikaela making out on top of Bumblebee's hood while the other Autobots calmly watch in vehicle mode, quite possibly making the term "Auto-erotica" a little too literal.
-   **The Tripper**: When Samantha is looking for Ivan she slides the van door only to find Jade and Muff having sex inside. They don't stop while telling her that they haven't seen him.
-   Zig-Zagged in **True Lies**. When Simon and Helen are driving in his Corvette, Simon acts like they're being followed and pushes her head into his lap, telling her to "keep your head down until we're out of the city." While Helen doesn't actually take the bait, it looks awfully suspicious to Harry's surveillance team.
-   In **Les Valseuses**, the two titular crooks pick up apathetic and terminally bored hairdresser Marie-Ange, who tags along for the ride. She informs them that she is incapable of orgasm, whatever they do to her, either singly or collectively. The guys take this as a challenge. In one scene, Pierrot is less than enchanted at being the third wheel, driving their car around a French city by night whilst his buddy Jean-Claude (played by Gérard Depardieu) makes love to Marie-Ange in the back seat, practically testing out the proposition. She does admit to a certain frisson of interest, but no orgasm.
-   In **Vampires vs. Zombies**, Carmilla and Tessa have lesbian sex in the Jeep on the side of the road.
-   Parodied and subverted in **Whip It** when the protagonist comes home to find her father's van rocking outside the house, and hear him shouting "YES! YES!".

    But last night in a taxi I \[mildly suggestive humming\]  
    Last night in the rumble seat \[slight giggling and more humming\]

    It's gone too far inside this car  
    I know I'll feel a whole lot more  
    When I get alone**
    
-   The Bluetones' hilariously unsubtle "Autophilia (Or, How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love My Car)", which is so ridiculous that it could easily be mistaken for the lust being directed towards **the car itself**. She does come in sixteen colours, after all.
-   Bon Jovi:
    
    -   "Never Say Goodbye":
    
    **Remember when we used to park  
    out on Butler Street out in the dark.

    Makes me think of my back on it.**
    
-   Paul Evans' 1959 hit "Seven Little Girls Sitting in the Back Seat" is kind of a G-rated version of this. The narrator/driver keeps trying to capture the attention of the titular girls, to no avail:

    You climbed in the backseat,  
    really had a good time.**
    
-   Marina & the Diamonds reference it in "The Outsider", in the context of the rest of the song, could be viewed as a little creepy...

    Hop into the backseat baby  
    I'll show you some fun**

-   During the Pink Floyd song "Run Like Hell" from **The Wall**, Pink warns that even lovers in cars are not safe from the wrath of the Hammers:
    
    **You better run all day and run all night  
    Keep your dirty feelings deep inside  
    And if you take your girlfriend out tonight  
    You better park your car well out of sight  
    Cause if they catch you in the backseat trying to pick her locks  
    They're gonna send you back to Mother in a cardboard box!  
    You better run!**
    
-   Prefab Sprout averted the Springsteen version of the trope, very explicitly, in "Cars and Girls":
    
    **Brucie dreams life's a highway too many roads bypass my way  
    Or they never begin. Innocence coming to grief  
    At the hands of life - Stinkin' car thief, that's my concept of sin  
    Does heaven wait all heavenly over the next horizon ?  
    But look at us now, quit driving, some things hurt more much more than cars and girls.  
    Just look at us now, start counting, what adds up the way it did when we were young?  
    Look at us now, quit driving, some things hurt much more than cars and girls...**

    making up for lost time.**

-   In **J.B.**, Nickles described this as one of the things Satan sees through the open eyes of his mask in the course of Walking the Earth:
    
    He sees the parked car by the plane tree.  
    He sees behind the fusty door,  
    Beneath the rug, those almost children  
    Struggling on the awkward seat—  
    Every impossible delighted dream  
    She's ever had of loveliness, of wonder,  
    Spilled with her garters to the filthy floor.  
    Absurd despair! Ridiculous agony!
