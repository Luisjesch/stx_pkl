A Party, Also Known as an Orgy: 
_"Tonight, 10 PM, at the Pit, Everyone Gets Laid."_

— **Moles Mullaney**, _Part of Moles_ radio commercial for the Pit Party, _PCU_

For fictional people past puberty, any wild party with all genders, teen or otherwise, is all about one thing: getting it on. This can be a good or bad thing, depending on many factors. Although one absolute in fiction is that if it's a teenage girl going, and you're her guardian, it's always a bad thing.

Part of the reason for this is simply that All Men Are Perverts and All Women Are Lustful.

**If it's planned and advertised as an orgy, it doesn't count.**
