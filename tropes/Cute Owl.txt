Cute Owl: 
_Hoo_ is the cutest little bird?

Owls are, to put it bluntly, adorable. There is something about those perfectly round shapes, those big eyes, and their beautiful fluffy plumage that appeals to us. They also have silly features like their Abnormal Limb Rotation Range, faces that read to humans as a perpetual mix of The Comically Serious and Eye Take, and their cute little hoots which have served so many "Who's on First?" jokes that it became its own sub-trope.

Even if you are ornithophobic<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , you can at least admit that they are rather Creepy Cute, or at the very least pretty rad.

There are two kinds of **Cute Owls** that mostly coincide with the two real-life families of owls:

-   The _Tytonidae_ - Barn owls and their relatives - is mostly represented cute in an elegant way because of its softer features and lighter colors and is as such depicted almost always female in fiction. It doesn't necessarily forbids her to be Badass Adorable and she could still have Silk Hiding Steel.
-   The _Strigidae_ - 'Typical' or 'eared' owls<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  - is often depicted as an Endearingly Dorky nerd, coupling this trope with The Owl-Knowing One, the most common Animal Stereotype associated with owls. Expect this Cute Bookworm to have scruffy feathers, wear Nerd Glasses (the big circles around its eyes being a natural inspiration of this), bowties and other geeky accessories. For a long time, this variety was almost Always Male — leading to a common misconception that the two varieties are from the same family with Bizarre Sexual Dimorphism — but the growing representation of female geeks in media is slowly discrediting this cliché.

Contrast Ominous Owl and Feathered Fiend, who are very much not like this. Compare The Owl-Knowing One and Noble Bird of Prey. Note that cute owls could still be evil, even the nerdy ones.

For other birds with similar connotations, see Doves Mean Peace and Bluebird of Happiness.

Cute Owl Example in Anime and Manga

-   **Basara**: The heroine Sarasa has a pet in the form of Shinbashi, an utterly adorable, tiny pet owl (she adopted him precisely because he was the runt of the litter) that's always with her. His presence often serves as a reprieve from **Basara**'s heavy story of destiny, rebellion and political intrigue.
-   Rowlet is already one of these in the games, but Ash's Rowlet in **Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon** is even more so, with its ditzy, perpetually sleepy personality and its habit of hiding in Ash's backpack.

Cute Owl Example in Comic Books

Cute Owl Example in Video Games

-   Feh from **Fire Emblem Heroes** is an adorable tiny white owl who delivers you items throughout the game.
-   Blathers from the **Animal Crossing** series can be considered cute in a dorky kind of way. His little sister Celeste however is completely cute with her Black Bead Eyes, Blush Stickers and pink bow. You can even tease Celeste about her being cute.
-   Cedric the Owl in **King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder!** is your standard Wise Old Owl / Exposition Fairy, but his monocle and jacket definitively makes him cuter. His voice and role in the game however didn't please everybody.
-   Mahina from **Octopath Traveler II** qualifies when Ochette chooses her as her Animal Companion. She's a malamaowl (an owl with elemental powers) who's Ochette's best friend, and she has a more openly-sweet personality than Akala does (who still cares about Ochette, but is a tad more strict with her). Very much averted if Ochette chose Akala instead, as Mahina ends up being Ochette's final boss instead.
-   **Pokémon**:
    -   **Pokémon Sun and Moon** introduces the Grass starter Rowlet, a bowtied Mon so round that it can almost be considered a Waddling Head. Its later evolutions are more cute in a dorky way, as Dartrix is a Neat Freak who tends to bungle things up and only makes things worse, while Decidueye acts all cool until someone gets the drop on it which then it panics.
    -   Back in **Gold and Silver**, Hoothoot could arguably be described as Creepy Cute with its round shape, its big red eyes, and crazy eyebrows and "eyeliner". Its evolution Noctowl however completely drops the cute act for a more imposing stature. Note that Hoothoot line is based on the **Strigidae** while the Rowlet line is based on the **Tytonidae**.
    -   The Togepi line, particularly Togekiss, may also be partially based on owls.
-   In **Monster Hunter: Rise**, Hunters get the services of a new pet called the Cohoot in place of the Poogie as a village pet you can pet and dress up. While on the hunt, Cohoots serve about the same purpose as Scoutflies, tracking down and scouting monsters your Hunter is pursuing among other things.
-   The mascot of the Edutainment Game Duolingo is Duo, a small green owl, also a case of The Owl-Knowing One.
-   Hootle from **Tales of Arise** is an adorably round owlet who serves as the Team Pet and overall mascot of the game. The longest sidequest in the game involves using Hootle to track down other owls to help them find their way back home to the Owl Forest.

-   Octavia, Stolas's daughter from **Helluva Boss**, was **adorable** when she was a little girl. These days, she's more of an embittered Emo Teen as a result of having to deal with her mother and father's relationship. Likewise, Stolas was quite cute himself when he was younger.

Cute Owl Example in Web Original

-   The Art Student Owl meme averts this, being a cynical, lazy, and jaded character who is always seen smoking. However, his counterpart, Art Newbie Owl, completely fits the bill, being a young Wide-Eyed Idealist owl who is very excited about art.

-   In the second season of **Bojack Horseman**, BoJack starts dating a cute female owl named Wanda Pierce, although it is less her cuteness and more the fact that she has no idea of all the gossip surrounding him, having just awakened from a 30-year coma, that made him fall in love with her.
-   Owlowicious from **My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic**. Everybody immediately falls in love with the cute bird, Rarity even giving him a gems-encrusted bowtie at one point, except for Spike who is jealous of the owl getting so much attention. Through his eyes, everything he does is ominous.
    -   Chad the Owl from **My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Holidays Unwrapped**, who hangs around Fluttershy in the "Winter Break-In" segment. Sunset wants to use him as a distraction in her plan to sneak into a locked Canterlot High, but Twilight shoots the idea down.

    -   The Cosmic Owl was presented as a mysterious and all powerful deity that everyone fears and respects as he appears in Prophetic Dreams. When he is formally introduced in the show, it turns out that he is a nerdy and awkward guy who just wants to play Tabletop Games with friends.

Orgalorg manipulating him to appear in Princess Bubblegum's dream and turn it into a prophetic nightmare.
-   **Puffin Rock** has Otto and his younger siblings Pip and Pop.
-   **The Owl House** has Eda's palisman, Owlbert. She even admits at one point that she can't get mad at him because he's so cute.
