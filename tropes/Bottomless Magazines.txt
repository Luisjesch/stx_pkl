"_You know, a lot of professional officers, even up to field rank in the combat branches, seem to think that ammo comes down miraculously from Heaven, in contra-gravity lorries, every time they pray into a radio for it._"

Possibly one of the oldest and most abused tropes when it comes to gunplay is the frequent ignorance of just how many shots the good guys/bad guys have fired from their guns without stopping for a reload. In Real Life, most revolvers hold between 5 to 8 shots, depending on caliber, while semiautomatic handguns have magazines that usually hold 10–15 shots. Pump-action, bolt-action, and lever-action longarms generally hold 5–8 rounds (but the magazine can easily be topped off) and detachable-magazine semi-automatic or automatic rifles generally hold at least 20, if not 30 rounds.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  But keep a running count, and you'll sometimes see a weapon go for much longer without hesitation.

Ammo capacity of guns on TV seems to be totally dependent on how much drama and suspense is needed. The hero will always have plenty of ammo to mow down the mooks, but will run out just before reaching the Big Bad, or confront him with One Bullet Left. Reloading is usually only done when it adds to the drama or when you need to show off how badass the gunslinger is. If someone is firing an automatic weapon that's belt-fed or has a large banana-shaped magazine in it, forget it — he's _never_ going to run out until you shoot him dead. The only thing that seems to stop a movie or TV gun from firing is the inevitable and dramatic jam.

Can be partially explained by editing in some of the less unrealistic movies. If multiple shots of a gunfight flow well together, shot counts might be ignored, rather than breaking the flow by putting in a reload shot. Likewise, editing has temporal considerations, and if the camera cuts to a different angle while the shots are occurring, you may be seeing the same shots repeated from different perspectives, making the actual number of shots fired lower than what was perceived.

This is a common characteristic of Energy Weapons; seldom do you see a ray gun run out of zap juice.

An adjunct to this would be the Bottomless Quiver for archers. Many an archer in animation and video games can pour out a stream of arrows without ever hitting the supply cart.

See also Infinite Supplies, Hammerspace. Unorthodox Reload is an aversion of this trope. Not at all related to Topless Magazines.

This may end up becoming an acceptable break from reality in many Video Games; who wants to pull their fighter plane over to the side to top up on the 20mm ammo in the middle of a Shoot 'Em Up?

Even in video games where you _do_ have to reload, typically shooters, the game doesn't keep track of individual magazines. You can reload at any point without wasting bullets or having to move bullets from one magazine to another. When the game invokes Universal Ammunition, the rules just get that much fuzzier. If you're unlucky, though, some people's magazines might be more bottomless than others.

A common justification in science fiction stories is that future firearms actually fire extremely tiny projectiles (hundreds or even thousands of which can be packed into a single magazine). Since kinetic energy is a factor of both mass and velocity, firing mechanisms that allow the projectile to be shot in a very, very high velocity can compensate (or more) for the size of the bullet. Stronger characters sometimes have the 'cheats' of an absurdly large magazine relative to their body size (e.g. having their gun belt-fed from a backpack) or internal magazines whose capacity cannot be accurately calculated. Neither of these can actually _be_ bottomless, but since viewers can't tell the actual number of rounds, they're less likely to have their Willing Suspension of Disbelief broken.

This trope often goes hand-in-hand with More Dakka. Compare against Counting Bullets, which is about limited magazines.

**There's a separate "Exceptions" subsection on the bottom of this page. Please post aversions and subversions there.**

**NOTE:** Clips are devices used to help load cartridges into a magazine, such as the en-bloc clips used to help feed the M1 rifle's fixed magazine or "moon clips" used hold multiple rounds in-place for loading revolvers. It's a common and understandable mistake to mix clips and magazines up, especially since most people already refer to magazines as clips in movies or video-games. Regardless, it's a Berserk Button among many firearm enthusiasts.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Anime & Manga

-   In **Brave10**, Kakei's matchlock musket is perfectly historical, but its bullet supply as the plot demands along with the pistols he later invents are decidedly less accurate for 1599.
-   **City Hunter**: Sometimes the anime will have guns firing more than they should. Averted in the manga, where Ryo needing to reload his six-shooters tend to be a plot point once in a while.
-   **Corpse Princess**: Makina fires something like 500 rounds each from her dual submachine guns before changing magazines.
-   Mad Pierrot's cane gun in the **Cowboy Bebop** episode "Pierrot le Fou" can be fired as rapidly as he feels like, despite it having no conceivable place to store any ammo besides the one round in the chamber. This adds to the Surreal Horror nature of the episode.
-   **Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children**: Loz and Yazoo's Velvet Nightmare gunblades qualify for this trope. Averted with Vincent Valentine: see the Exceptions section.
-   In **Full Metal Panic!**, Sosuke is evidently **not** used to running out of bullets and having to reload. Rather, he's instead developed the tendency to discard an empty weapon and pull out new, fully-loaded one. This is evidenced in an episode of **Fumoffu** when he plays a First-Person Shooter arcade game and gets flustered when he runs out of ammo, proceeding to pull out his **real** gun and blowing the game away (and when told the method to actually reload — namely, pointing the light gun away from the screen and pulling the trigger — he replies that this would be horribly unsafe). It works for him, though — he certainly manages to carry an unlimited amount of firearms on his person.
-   Possibly in reference to this, **Gaiking: Legend of Daiku Maryu** has a robot known as Vulking, a Mighty Glacier who specializes in More Dakka. It's final attack involves firing EVERYTHING at the enemy... and is known as **Endless Burn**. Vulking also has this in effect by not running out of ammo in its FINGER CANNONS every few seconds (though most of the rest of its arsenal are energy based). Similar to this, we never see the Kill Jaguar reload its Vulcan Storm either.
-   **Gundam** is inconsistent on this, as on some occasions weapons (both kinetic **and** energy) are shown to have ammo limits, but generally mobile suits will only need to reload when it is **least** convenient to reload.
    -   The original Gundam is shown to run out of power for its beam rifle on several occasions, at least, though at these points he'll rather toss the rifle away because, in that series, the ability to actually reload beam weapons in the field doesn't exist yet. Other requirements like fuel are also skimmed over entirely, despite how much of a big deal outside sources make about it.
    -   Heavyarms has been shown to run out of ammo on multiple occasions, most pointedly in its battle with Sandrock early in the series, as well as in **Endless Waltz**; its magazines aren't bottomless, but they're sure as hell high-capacity.
    -   **The 08th MS Team** mostly follows this as well, though there is one occasion, during the battle with Norris Packard, where Shiro expends a hell of a lot of ammo and promptly runs out in the middle of emptying his gun in the enemy's direction. Interestingly, power requirements for the ground-type Gundams' beam sabers are rarely acknowledged, despite the fluff mentioning they only carry enough power for a single minute of use and then require **fifteen** to recharge.
    -   **Mobile Suit Gundam SEED**, though, is an odd one — as its beam weaponry is connected to its power source, it doesn't run out unless its suit runs out of power. It's averted, though, when the suits using nuclear power are introduced.
    -   Taken to an extreme early on in **Mobile Suit Gundam AGE**, the AGE-1 has only one ranged Dods Rifle, and the unskilled Frit Asuno fires it all day long just trying to land a hit on enemies. Averted however in a later episode with Kio Asuno and the AGE-FX. After using the FX's Stungle Rifle to take out the Vagan border guards when raiding a base late in the show and being inefficient with it because of a desire to keep the pilots alive it runs out of ammo and has to be discarded right before Zeheart and Fram show up, forcing him to have to rely on melee and putting him a major disadvantage in a 2 on 1 battle.
-   Beyond the Grave in **Gungrave** reloads his guns **once** in the entire series.
-   **Hellsing**:
    -   The manga does this, as nearly every gun user, and one character who fights by throwing bayonets, is shown to have unlimited ammunition, or at least Super-Speed combined with an implausibly large number of reloads. This stands out because Alucard's guns are noted to fire very large and powerful bullets that would logically give the guns a small magazine size (one of them is explicitly given a six-shot magazine), and as the rounds they fire are made of solid silver and blessed by the Church, counting shots would make a lot of sense—Alucard, though, routinely dumps dozens of bullets into any foe that can survive the first hit. The creator jokingly states at one end-of-manga rant that Alucard's firearms are "cosmoguns" that hold an enormous amount of ammunition, while the bayonet-using Anderson is just "fourth dimensional".
    -   An exception to this is Seras' Harkonnen anti-tank rifle used during the attack on Hellsing mansion. It holds only one shell and reloading takes a realistic amount of time. Then again it might very well be done purely for drama. Though this becomes a Double Subversion when she then gets fully-automatic versions.
    -   Alucard **is** seen to reload in the manga and at least once in the anime, but that's more Rule of Cool.
    -   Averted in the final episode of the **Hellsing** anime when, during his fight with Incognito, Alucard runs out of ammo for The Jackal until Seras brings him a reload. Of course, he then goes on to fire 8 or so shots from a magazine that's explicitly stated to hold 6 rounds.
-   **Musashi Gundoh**'s main character uses revolvers. **Musashi Gundoh** is one of the stupidest series in history. You can probably see where this is going.
-   Ninjas in **Naruto** can easily carry a ton of shuriken and kunai by using seals to basically store them inside **scrolls**.
-   **One Piece**:
    -   Franky is the most noticeable offender, apparently having a nail machine gun in his arm (which should logically hold only four nails) and a cannon, which he is never seen reloading.
    -   A number of characters use flintlock pistols that they fire faster than they could possibly reload. According to Word of God, the really are capable of holding multiple bullets. While such things did actually exist in real life, they were rare prototypes that were both bulky and unreliable, whereas the flintlocks shown look identical to the normal single-shot types.
-   Elie's Guns Tonfa in **Rave Master** are often used for full auto bullet-spraying. There are no visible magazines, integral magazines for guns the size of tonfas shouldn't have that much capacity, and she is never shown reloading. It could be a helical magazine, which would have the right shape and ammo capacity for the tonfas — except that such a design would leave little space for the firing and shell-ejection mechanism.
-   None of the girls ever seem to need to reload their weapons in **Strike Witches**. It feels a bit odd too considering how much ammo they can sometimes burn through to take down one Neuroi. What makes this especially glaring is that Charlotte, armed with a BAR, actually complains about her weapon's low capacity (even with a magazine extended to twice the capacity the real M1918 ever got) compared to the MG 42s most of the rest of the cast lug around, despite as above it not actually being an issue in the slightest.
-   A standard feature of the **Symphogear** system is Spontaneous Weapon Creation, which might just justify Chris' ability to fire continuous streams of lead from her Billion Maiden configuration; the bullets are created as fast as she can fire them. Downplayed for her more explosive weapon options, which she needs more time to create and thus function as a sort of Charged Attack.
-   Played straight with Vash's opponents in **Trigun**, who never seem to run out of ammunition. This becomes even more confusing/distressing with Elendira the Crimson Nails, who seems to have an infinite number of giant nails hidden in her briefcase gun. And except for a hilarious subversion of a Mexican Standoff at the beginning (and despite complaining that bullets are hideously expensive), Vash never runs out of bullets, either.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Card Games

-   An Equipment Modifier in one of the Munchkin games is "...With Unlimited Ammo."
-   Made fun of in the card game **Ninja Samurai on Giant Robot Island**, where the flavor text on a gun reads: "There is no word in the Chinese language for 'reloading'."

Bottomless Magazines Example in Comic Books

-   **2000 AD**:
    -   In **Nikolai Dante**, it is explicitly stated that the Huntsman 5000 creates ammo internally and replenishes automatically, so there is no need to reload.
    -   **The Grievous Journey of Ichabod Azrael**: Quite literally; Ichabod's revolver continues to fire an unlimited amount of bullets despite the chamber being entirely empty when he checks it.
-   This was the explicit power of Tec-9 of **Blood Syndicate** (from DC's Milestone imprint): Any gun he fired never needed reloading.
-   In The DCU, the Modern Age version of Jonah Hex has guns that channel his own psychic energy, and the Modern Age Crimson Avenger has the original's guns, now magically attuned to her. In both cases the effect is the same, they never run out of ammo.
-   **Hitman** can't make up its mind on this, variously using it, subverting it, and lampshading it.
-   Played dead straight with the Holiday Killer in **The Long Halloween**. Either he/she had a .22 pistol able to fire fifty shots at once, or the Riddler was a good sport and stayed stock-still while Holiday put a bullet outline around him, not moving **even while Holiday was reloading**.
-   **Lucky Luke**:
    -   The title character does this often. When asked "Do you ever reload?" in one Animated Adaptation, he replies "Yes, at the end of the episode." This is a transcription of the original comic, where he replied, "Yes, between each album."
    -   Another lampshade comes in the animated series: when asked if he ever reload, he answers with his catchphrase "Yes I do, faster than my shadow", then the camera moves and show that the shadow is STILL reloading the bullets shot during the previous gunfight.
    -   Averted at the end of one comic when he tries to get the attention of a crowd by firing in the air, only to realize that he has spent the whole issue without reloading. And if you go back and count, he has indeed fired a total of six shots up to that point.
    -   Also partially averted in one album, where Lucky Luke comes in reinforcements to a cavalry detachment (for once, the situation is inverted) attacked by Indians. Luke rides from the top of the hill, keeping shooting, until the Indians run away, and you can count at least 36 gun shots without the hero reloading. When the Captain of the detachment says that it was about time that they flee, Luke agrees: "Indeed it was about time. My revolver is empty."
-   Hand waved in **Preacher**, wherein the Saint of Killers has a pair of Walker Colt revolvers that never run out of bullets because they were forged by Satan from the former Angel of Death's sword. For the same reason, his guns are incapable of missing and kill anything they hit. The origin of his guns **also** explains why the wounds they make are much less like pistol fire and much more like cannon fire. It should be noted that every other firearm in Preacher makes these kinds of wounds - it's just that only the Saint of Killer's weapons are actually **justified** in doing so.
-   **Sin City: That Yellow Bastard** has Bob firing about 8 shots from a 6-shot revolver early in the first issue. It's pretty rare that anyone ever reloads.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Fan Fiction

-   **A Crown of Stars**: The M1911 that Daniel loans Asuka is pretty close to this in practice. Its magazine extends about half a mile into some sort of dimensional pocket and contains so much ammunition that someone firing a couple of dozen practice rounds a week wouldn't need to reload it for a couple of decades.
-   In **Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past**, Mr. Weasley finds a handgun Harry steals. When he goes out to test it, he notices it has been enchanted to conjure new bullets as it runs out.
-   In chapter 11 of **If Wishes Were Ponies**, the Equestrians, as-per their Magitek, have managed to create a version of this by using a single round inside each of several conventional ammunition magazines that have duplication spells attached to them. They come in at least 5 flavors. Standard 5.56mm NATO rifle rounds, .50BMG, 40mm grenades, 155mm artillery and a flamethrower version. The British Government is extremely worried about news of this development being accidentally leaked into the outside world due to the threat of it falling into the hands of criminal or terrorist organizations.
-   In **Light and Dark The Adventures of Dark Yagami**, the titular character is confronted by a million stormtroopers, so he pulls out his gun and realizes he only has one-hundred thousand bullets left. A magazine with that many bullets would be about a "killmeter" long <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>, and there's no way you could count them. Then again...
-   Ebony in **My Immortal** manages to shoot Snape and Lupin "a gazillion times" with an apparently non-magical gun.
-   **Fantasy of Utter Ridiculousness**: This is how the Spell Card system translates Megas's missile-based weaponry. As long as it's taking part in a duel, Megas will never run out of firepower. The aversion, though, is noted below.
-   **One for All and Eight for the Ninth**: During the Kamino Raid, Mei uses a justified example as the belt of her gatling gun is being created by Momo even as she fires it, giving her functionally infinite ammo.
-   **This Bites!**: Lassoo the Dog-Gun is a bazooka brought to life with the Mutt-Mutt Fruit, Model: Dachshund. Just as a living dog can produce blood, bile, and mucus, his Devil Fruit allows him to perpetually reproduce any ammo he uses without ever having to reload. That includes the exploding baseballs he started with and the different types of ammunition Usopp added into him when Lassoo joined the Straw Hat Pirates.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Films — Animation

-   **Boogie** fires what seems to be a few hundred rounds out of his double guns throughout the movie, yet the amount of times he's seen reloading can be counted on one hand.
-   In **Batman: Under the Red Hood,** the newest Red Hood fires around 50 (that we see, many more if we assume that the fight isn't taking place simultaneously) shots from akimbo pistols.
-   **Beauty and the Beast**, during the tavern scene, Gaston fires three shots into a keg, causing beer to spill out and fill his mates' glasses, in under a second. He used a muzzle-loaded black powder blunderbuss (early Short-Range Shotgun). Even the fastest shooters (such as soldiers) can only get three shots off in a minute.
-   In **Fantastic Mr. Fox**, the hunters fire bolt-action rifles and double-barrel shotgun several dozen times without working the action before eventually reloading.
-   **Old Master Q In The Water Margin** has wacky Time Travel shenanigans taking our three protagonists back to the events of the legendary novel **The Water Margin**. Big Potato takes a revolver back with him but no spare ammo. It is later lost in a scuffle and stolen by a corrupt minister who has gone mad with fear. Said minister manages to fire several hundred shots despite never actually reloading, let alone having that many rounds to begin with!
-   Played with in **Ratatouille**. Mabel fires at least 10-12 shells from a pump shotgun whose magazine tube is nowhere near long enough to hold them all, but she does eventually have to stop and reload.
-   In **Tarzan** Clayton has a double-barrel shotgun that can fire up to five times between reloading.
-   In **Toy Story 2**, the Emperor Zurg toy fires **a lot** of nerf balls out of his tiny plastic ion blaster during the elevator fight scene.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Films — Live-Action

-   In **3 Ninjas**, the boys' father leading the FBI task force fired 9 shots from a revolver at the crime boss escaping on a helicopter.
-   **21 Bridges**: The two robbers fire hundreds of bullets combined from their submachineguns. Not only are they never seen reloading, but it's a major plot point that they never expected to get into a firefight, so why did they bring so much ammo with them in the first place?
-   In **Army of Darkness**, Ash fires his double-barrel shotgun three and later four times in a row without reloading. He also fires at least two dozen rounds at the deadite in S-Mart from a lever action rifle at the end. Also, his chainsaw seems to never run out of fuel. Or need any fuel, for that matter. However when his shotgun fires both barrels, the camera switches away from Ash and a soft clicking sound is heard (which would still mean a very fast reload, especially for a man with only one hand). Of course, the question still remains, where he's getting all those shell in the first place.
-   Almost averted in the '50s monster movie **Attack of the Giant Leeches**, where we do see a character reload. **Almost**, because before and after reloading, he manages to fire off five shots from a double-barreled shotgun.
-   **Battle Royale**: Kazuo Kiriyama's Uzi. This seems to apply in some form to every gun handed out in the film, but that Uzi and, fittingly, someone else's Micro-Uzi are the biggest offenders because of just how **much** ammo gets pumped through them without anyone ever touching the magazines.
-   In **Battleship,** the **USS Missouri** is shown firing several rounds from her main guns, before switching to Alex Hopper yelling "Reload! Reload!" The big 16" guns on an **Iowa**\-class battleship max out at two rounds per gun per minute. There is no such thing as an automatic 16 inch cannon, they have to be reloaded after every shot.
-   In **Birdemic**, no one ever reloads, and the protagonists fire a truly insane amount of rounds at the birds. Of course, at the end when the heroes are trapped, they suddenly the realize they're out of ammo.
-   **Black Dynamite**. The titular character regularly fires upwards of 10 shots from his six shot revolver. Of course, this is probably on purpose.
-   In **The Blue Max**, the aircraft-mounted machine guns apparently had no ammo tracks at all, the props simply spouting flame.
    
    **"No big deal. People just watch the muzzle flashes."**
    
-   In the first half of the final gun battle in **Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid**, Butch and Sundance are shown reloading their guns every six shots... but then they go the entire rest of the fight without ever reloading.
-   In **Carriers**, Brian is seen to use his gun to shoot a Christian couple in a car an abnormally large amount of times without any sign of reloading. He also uses the gun multiple other times throughout the film, and given the scenario (post-apocalyptic disease-ridden society), it's unlikely that he would have any other ammo than the bullets in the gun handy.
-   In **Commando**, the ammunition belt on John's machine gun actually gets longer between every cut away and cut back.
-   Pretty notable in **Constantine (2005)**. Angela fires her gun consecutively 30 times without reloading, but her Smith and Wesson Model 6906 holds a total of 13 rounds.
-   In **Dead Heat**, Roger Mortis and a mook (both zombies) unload into each over from about four meters away for several seconds of full-auto fire from an Uzi and an MP5 respectively.
-   **Deep Rising** (with the exception of a Karmic Death) has people firing automatic weapons at the monsters with never-ending bullets. At one point they even start shooting up an empty room. Just for the hell of it. There's at least an attempted justification: in the beginning they mentioned the magazine can hold 1,000 rounds of ammo which would last quite a while but would be far bigger than shown in the movie (the guns do exist in reality but only have a maximum capacity of 50 rounds).
-   **Die Hard**:
    -   In the first **Die Hard**, no one ever reloads unless it's plot important. The Steyr AUG has a magazine capacity of 30, and the bad guy fires constantly for minutes. On the other hand, it was one of the first action movies to have the characters carrying spare magazines as a matter of course.
    -   In **Die Hard with a Vengeance**, the security guard in the bank vault fires his shotgun about 15 times before coming up empty, nearly twice as many shells as a typical law-enforcement model can hold.
-   Averted in **Dredd**. Judges Dredd and Anderson are shown reloading throughout the film. In fact, Dredd ends up killing so many Mooks that he runs out of ammo. He ends up getting more ammo after Anderson dispatches a corrupt judge.
-   **Equilibrium** deals with this by having the main character have a mechanism under his sleeves that loads his pistols with new magazines. This does not explain how exactly the mechanism works however, or how many magazines it holds. He also has sort of elaborate decoy magazines, magazines on round bottoms that he tosses to the floor, runs out and shoots down several guards before dropping to the floor and slotting the magazines into his gun. Careful counting of shots along the hallway scene in which both the sleeve reload and the weighted weeble clips are used reveals at least 30 rounds per magazine are being fired all the way along. At best count, about 40 are fired before the first reload, possibly more.
-   Snake's revolver in **Escape from New York** is like a magic gun that doesn't even need ammo. When all of his gear is displayed before he sets out on his mission, you can see **two** extra speedloaders for his scoped S&W Model 67. Not only is his gun never reloaded onscreen, but it fires about 10x as many bullets as he had with him.
-   In **The Fast and the Furious (2001)**, the villain fires way more rounds than the submachine gun he's carrying can hold in a magazine during the final chase scene. Furthermore, he's doing so while riding a motorcycle, giving him no realistically-conceivable means of reloading. When they destroy Brian's Eclipse, each of their submachine guns fires like an anti-materiel machine gun, about 150-200 rounds of API ammo each. After so many rounds, any machine gun with one barrel would have gone white hot.
-   Occurs twice when Lana Ravine is firing her revolver in **Fatal Instinct**: when she's at the firing range and when she's shooting Max Shady.
-   An extremely frequent cliche in Filipino action films. This scene in particular being one of the more famous examples.
-   In **Gentlemen Explorers**, this is an explicit property of the Infinity Pistol: the MacGuffin of the movie. The Infinity Pistol is magical gun that is enchanted to never run out of bullets.
-   **Grosse Pointe Blank** has this in abundance. Oddly, his lack of ammo then becomes very important in his brief stand-off with Grocer.
-   **Gunfight at the O.K. Corral**. Doc Holliday fires three shots in a row... from a double-barreled shotgun.
-   Some scenes in **Hacksaw Ridge** have soldiers firing their guns a lot longer than typical. Most notably with Smitty and his BAR and Sergeant Howell with his M3 "Grease Gun".
-   A minor version of this happens with the original **Halloween II (1981)**. In the first **Halloween (1978)**, Dr. Loomis shoots Michael Myers once with a six-cylinder revolver, then after Myers staggers back a few steps, Loomis takes aim and fires the other five bullets in his gun, causing Myers to fall off a balcony to the ground below. However, the scene where Michael is shot and falls off the balcony was re-shot for the second film, leading to two rather glaring continuity errors: the balcony looks completely different than the first film's, and Loomis shoots Myers with **six** bullets instead of five following that initial shot. Which mean that, instead of shooting him "six times", as Loomis claims, he actually shot him **seven times**.
-   **Hellboy**:
    -   In **Hellboy (2004)**, the title character's revolver The Samaritan clearly holds and is loaded with four bullets, but when he shoots at Sammael in the museum he fires it six times before putting it back in his belt, then on the street twice more. When he reloads it with a tracking bullet a while later he doesn't remove any shell casings. He shoots it more than four times while fighting the tooth fairies in **Hellboy II: The Golden Army** as well.
    -   In **Hellboy (2019)**, Hellboy is never seen reloading his six-shooter regardless of how many shots he fired in any given scene.
-   In **Hitman**, 47 loads a pair of MP5s (30 rounds per magazine) and proceeds to slaughter a room of baddies without ever stopping to reload (you know there weren't any reloads off screen, because 47 was frisked when he entered the room).
-   In **Hot Fuzz**, the bartender fires 8 shots from his double-barreled shotgun before ducking to reload. Given that the movie is both a parody of, and tribute to police and action flicks, this may have been intentional.
-   The **Commando** parody in **Hot Shots! Part Deux**. When the action cuts away from Topper Harley firing a machine gun several times. Each time the camera cuts back to him, the pile of shell casings around him is higher (up to his **waist** by the end of the scene) and the belt is the same length.
-   Lampshaded and ruthlessly parodied in **I'm Gonna Git You Sucka**, where the protagonist chases down a thug with his Magnum, and keeps shooting. After a brief chase, the thug stops him to point out:
    
    **Willie:** Now, you got a .45 revolver that holds six bullets! Now, I counted at least twenty shots and you never reloaded!  
    **Slammer:** That's right.
    
-   They tried to avert it in **Independence Day** with the fighter jets running out of missiles, but then they had the pilots "plough the road" with a seemingly endless supply of bullets from their Gatling cannons. One wonders why they used their precious supply of missiles to shoot down alien fighters when machine guns were just as effective. In real life, fighter jets carry enough rounds for less than ten seconds of continuous fire.
-   **I, Robot** was a big offender. Spooner never reloads any of the several pistols he uses throughout the movie, but even worse, he has a submachine gun that gets a **lot** of use toward the end. By 2035, apparently bullets are infinite.
-   In **John Wick** this is averted. We regularly see John reloading, and even reloading BEFORE he runs out of ammo, which is actually considered the right way to do it. You reload as soon as you have opportunity.
-   In **Kingsman: The Secret Service**, one of Dean's mooks somehow manages to fire eight shots from a six-shot revolver.
-   **Komodo vs. Cobra**, an already remarkably bad movie with technical mistakes every few seconds, **really** goes to town with this. The .45 semi-auto pistols (which are misidentified by multiple characters as .38 revolvers, somehow) have apparently infinite ammo. There's one scene where a character fired one gun around 45 times, and another scene where he had one gun in each hand and fired at least 60 times total. Note that they never stocked up on ammo when they were at their base, nor did the movie ever show them re-loading between action scenes, let alone during them. Since the two titular beasties are also somehow Immune to Bullets, they're basically just loud flash-toys.
-   Played Straight and subverted (as are many, many other tropes) in the movie **Last Action Hero**. When they are in the movie, everybody's shooting left and right without ever pausing to reload. When they exit the movie to real life, Arnie's character realizes things work differently: cars don't blow up with little provocation, and guns need reloading. In one of the final scenes, as the Big Bad is shooting his revolver randomly in Arnie's direction, he apparently runs out of ammo. Arnie pops out of his hiding place and pokes fun at the Big Bad forgetting to reload, only to discover he has faked running out and has one last bullet left... with which he's immediately shot.
    
    **Jack Slater:** Oops! Did you make a movie mistake? You forgot to reload the damn gun!  
    **Benedict:** No, Jack. I just left one chamber empty.
    
-   Seymour's revolver in the film of the musical **Little Shop of Horrors** has at least 12 shots.
-   Particularly evident during the climax of **The Lone Ranger**.
-   In **The Lord of the Rings** film adaptations, the accusation is sometimes made that elf-archer Legolas never seems to run out of arrows. Ironically, this is actually because the narrative is a bit condensed in adaptation: in the books, Tolkien actually notes on multiple occasions that in lulls between major fight scenes (i.e. between enemy waves during the Battle of Helm's Deep), Legolas has to go foraging for more arrows. This is a large reason why he lost the Body-Count Competition he had going with Gimli at Helm's Deep: he only has about two dozen arrows on him, and he was winning at first because he could fire them more quickly than Gimli could kill foes with his axe — but after Legolas ran low on ammo, Gimli started to catch up.
-   In **The Man Who Fell to Earth**, a six-cylinder revolver is fired **seventeen** times in succession.
-   **The Matrix** films.
    -   The scenes in the Matrix can be explained by the same logic that gives humans and programs super-strength and speed. In fact, the weird part is when they **do** run out of bullets, especially the Agents, who are literally a part of the environment, and have full support of the world-building program, so if anyone has a legit excuse to have infinite ammo, it should be them. It is also justified for the people since they are able to hack it.
    -   **The Matrix**: Neo fires a gatling gun from a helicopter for almost a minute. That's upwards of **six thousand** bullets at the rates those sorts of guns fire at.
    -   **The Matrix Revolutions**: The lobby shootout scene (the ones with bad guys on the ceiling), in which **no** character ever reloads or throws away guns, and in the subway chase when The Trainman fires at least 11 rounds from his 6-shot revolver, without reloading (or being shown to, anyway).
    -   Also prevalent in **The Matrix Reloaded** during the highway chase. The twins seem to have a UMP45 with at least 200 rounds in its magazine, whereas the real-life counterpart has only 25.
    -   During the battle for Zion, in the real world, the legion of APUs can be seen firing for extended periods of time on full auto. In fact, many APUs reload at different times despite all beginning to fire at the same time.
-   **Max Payne**, in which Max fires roughly thirty shots from an 92FS during one shootout and is never seen reloading. In-game however, everything reloads, complete with scattered empty magazines. In the sequel, an effect of getting deep into bullet-time is to make this even more badass.
-   In **Miller's Crossing**, Leo fires over five hundred rounds from a Thompson submachine gun loaded with a hundred round magazine.
-   In **Ms. 45**, Thana never reloads, never purchases additional bullets after taking the gun from the second rapist, and never runs out of ammunition.
-   In **The Mummy (1999)**, during the riverboat battle, one American fires a total of twelve shots from a six-cylinder revolver. Have fun with some drinking games based on this one. In the same riverboat battle, Rick fires about fourteen times without reloading, whereas with exactly the same gun three years before he ran out after about three shots in each. During the camp battle he only fires six, so that's okay.
-   In **Night Train to Munich,** Randall fires a revolver more than six times, and then arbitrarily runs out of bullets at the most dramatic time.
-   Played for Laughs during the opening credits of **The Outlaws IS Coming!**. The credits appear on the mirrors, windows, bottles and drinking glasses in the saloon set, as well as on a dancing girl's abdomen. Trigger Mortis shoots up all of the glass items, firing more than 30 shots from his six-shooter without reloading. Just as he is about to shoot the dancer, he stops, looks at his revolver and mutters "lucky for you I've got to reload".
-   The director's commentary for **Planet Terror** notes that even the actors were wondering about it. The director told them, "It's not that kind of movie."
-   **Predator**, in which a character fires a Minigun (rate of fire 1,200-2,000 rounds per minute, easily half the **actual** rate of fire of an M134) for several minutes before it empties. The total ammo expended is easily more than he could have possibly carried for such a heavy weapon. During the famous More Dakka scene, Dutch and Dillon are seen reloading — albeit after firing about six times as many rounds as they had any right to — and Mac's M60 runs dry before he grabs the Minigun rather than load a fresh belt.
-   Appears during the hilarious chase scene in **Raising Arizona**: a cashier reloads his double-barreled shotgun after firing one shell at H.I., but then fires off five shells in a row without stopping.
-   In **Rambo IV**, Sly opens up on the bad guys with a fifty-cal machine gun mounted on a small jeep. He keeps it up for a while, far longer than a single belt could possibly allow. It does eventually run out, but not before shooting a lot more rounds than a small jeep would reasonably carry (.50 BMGs are **big**). And then he **reloads**.
-   **Robin and the 7 Hoods**: When Will (Sammy Davis Jr..) is shooting up the casino during the "Bang, Bang" number, he fires more shots than either gun holds (12 from one, 11 from the other).
-   **RoboCop (1987)** plays with this trope. Although the film features plenty of gunplay, characters are seen to reload. However the title character, while tending to fire short, controlled bursts, expends a lot more bullets than is possible for the size of his admittedly oversized Auto-9 before returning it to his leg holster **at the end of any given engagement**, and is never seen performing a reload action during combat at all. Additionally, the ED-209 robot appears to carry more ammunition than a fighter plane; in its Disastrous Demonstration it empties three 20mm cannon into a hapless executive for nigh-on half a minute.
-   In **RoboCop 2**, RoboCain's rampage includes his firing hundreds if not thousands of rounds from his built-in rotary gun- far more than he could be carrying.
-   In **Saving Private Ryan**, the American sniper fires more than five shots from his Springfield sniper rifle without reloading, exceeding the weapon's capacity.
-   **Scarface (1983)** has loads of guns on full auto, and most of them seem to have nigh-unlimited ammo. Micro Uzis always keep blazing like miniguns. The final shootout takes it to ridiculous extremes. Tony's M16 has two magazines Jungle-Style'd together, but it certainly goes through more than 60 rounds before Tony has to reload. And he has to reload twice. And there's the countless bullets pumped into him which barely get him to stumble, let alone kill him. One single shot from a double-barrel shotgun finally does.
-   In **Snatch.** the trope is averted and later followed. Bullet Tooth Tony is unable to kill Tyrone because he runs out of bullets killing Boris the bullet dodger — he pulls the trigger, the gun goes click, and he comments "You lucky bastard". In this sequence, he reloads at least once, and each magazine holds 7 shots, exactly as many as the real Desert Eagle in .50 AE holds. Later on, however, Cousin Avi gets the gun and fires 10 shots at a dog without a reload.
-   In the 1939 movie **Stagecoach**, during the final chase scene, nearly every male riding the stagecoach has a Winchester or revolver, and are shooting them as fast as possible, but none of them are shown reloading them (the Native Americans, on the other hand, sometimes have to reload theirs). Then suddenly, without warning, they're out of ammo and about to be overrun (before The Cavalry saves them).
-   The film version of **Starship Troopers** downplays it. In the attack on Klendathu most of the MI's guns fire continuously without needing to reload, but in the battle in Whiskey Outpost later in the film they start running low on ammo. Keep in mind this is after around four minutes of almost continuous firing, long enough for the bugs to be able to start **crawling up to the top of the outpost's walls on piles of their dead.**
-   Nobody ever seems to run out of bullets for their six shooters in **Tall Tale**. However, given the dreamlike nature of the movie, this may be intentional.
-   Noticeably averted in **The Terminator** with reloading scenes or magazines running empty. An exception is the parking garage chase where sloppy editing caused Arnold to fire numerous times from a pump-action shotgun without racking the slide or inserting more shells (or driving). Also it's not clear where Kyle Reese got the spare shells to reload his shotgun, since he is not shown taking any spare ammo when he steals it from the police cruiser early in the film. One must assume that at some point between then and the shootout at the Tech Noir, Reese must have found some way to acquire more ammo, perhaps by stealing it from a sporting goods store.
-   Both Arnie and the T-1000 are shown reloading in **Terminator 2: Judgment Day**, but for Arnie that just raises the fridge logic of where he got the spare shotgun shells. One could handwave the spare pistol mags by saying they were in the jacket he stole, but he famously took the shotgun and only the shotgun (after one shot had already been fired). The shotgun also fires 7 in excess of the model's 5 plus one in the chamber, and the T-1000 also makes use of two different 9mm pistols that each hold, at maximum, 15 bullets per magazine, yet fires more than twenty shots from each of them before reloading.
-   In **The Thing (1982)** Blair fires seven shots from a six shot revolver without reloading.
-   Happens in quite a few shorts of **The Three Stooges**, the most blatant example being in the short Tricky Dicks, where the villain fires a six shot revolver numerous times without reloading once.
-   Silent Slapstick comedy **Tillie's Punctured Romance** offers an egregious example. Tillie whips out what looks to be a standard revolver, and fires about 20 shots from it.
-   **Tombstone**: During the Gunfight at the OK Corral scene, everybody fires more than 6 rounds from their revolvers. Some of this comes down to sloppy editing; Doc shoots a cowboy during the OK Corral gunfight once with his shotgun (having fired the first barrel into the air), but the scene's cut to show the same shooting twice from different angles. Moments later, however, Doc unholsters his pistols and fires seven shots into Billy Clanton, then immediately fires **fourteen** more at Dirty Coward Ike Clanton trying to ambush him from behind.
-   Notably averted in **Transformers: Age of Extinction**, where Hound runs out of ammo during the Final Battle and is forced to improvise.
-   In **Undead**, the police officer's revolver fires a rather obscene amount of rounds in the first gunfight.
-   In the **Underworld (2003)** series, Selene **can** occasionally be seen reloading. She does however, fire far bullets than her guns could hold. The scene involving the escape via a Bullet Hole Door is one of the worst (Best?!) examples out there as she fires what must be far more bullets than the mass of her berettas.\[1\] Why these guns even have a fully automatic mode is odd, since an extended clip won't last long. (Not that she had extended clips...)
-   In **The Villain**, Arnie's character Hansum Stranger has a **seven** shot revolver which otherwise looks like an ordinary gun. When Cactus Jack, disguised as a preacher, fires six rounds, he then waves the gun around thinking that it's empty. Then, he pulls the trigger, spooking the horse hitched to the buckboard he's standing on.
-   In **The Walking Dead (1936)**, Nolan and Loder fire 17 shots from a six-shot revolver without reloading.
-   Lampshaded in **What's Up, Tiger Lily?** (and referencing **Peter Pan**) — when the hero is in a shootout and runs out of ammo, he tells us "If all you people in the audience who believe in fairies clap your hands, my gun will be magically full of bullets!"
-   In **Where Eagles Dare,** Clint Eastwood's character fires an MP 40 submachine gun minute after minute, never once reloading for a quarter of the movie. Since there are no convenient ammo trucks following him around, the ammo fairy must be helping out.
-   John Woo movies. Almost every single one, with the exception of the **The Killer (1989)** — in that movie's final battle you see one of the main characters toss a magazine to the other so he can reload. The only time the guns **ever** seem to run out of ammunition is when it's somehow relevant to the plot. Woo has stated in interviews that showing a reload detracts from the action of a gunfight and he wonders why American film audiences are so obsessed with it. Correlates with the MST3K Mantra.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Jokes

-   There is an Israeli joke about a **Golanchik**<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> in the IDF, stereotypically a Lower-Class Lout Colonel Kilgore who once found a genie who gave him three wishes. He asked for a bottomless magazine. Later, in a battle, he fights very, very hard in his unit’s encounter with enemy forces, thanks to never having to reload; everyone praises him as a hero, so when the genie comes to ask him for his next two wishes, he says, ‘That was fucking A, mate! Gimme two more of these!’

Bottomless Magazines Example in Literature

-   The King of Ward 3 in **Blindness** has a revolver that has capacity of more than six bullets. Oddly, it is NOT used as a plot point, so this trope comes into play despite the person wielding it being blind.
-   **Chakona Space**: Neal's Betsy is no ordinary shotgun. The ammo tube contains a transporter target beacon so Tess can transmit more rounds during a firefight.
-   In **The Half-Made World**, Agents of the Gun carry magical, demonic revolvers that do not need to be reloaded.
-   A rare Justified example appears in the third entry of the **La Fuerza Series**, **The Inquisitor**. A mercenary named Witch Doctor’s superpower is Illogical Construct Creation, and one such creation is a pair of minigun pistols with no recoil and infinite ammunition.
-   **Katanagatari** has Entou Jyuu, a pair of guns that never run out of bullets. Justified as they were created using future technology.
-   In his article "Meanwhile Back at the B-Western", the humorist Patrick McManus writes about his love of that film genre, and grumbles about nitpickers who insist on pointing out this trope when it appears in such productions. "Ol' Roy must be usin' a nine-shooter!"
-   **The Night Mayor** is set in a virtual reality realm that runs on movie logic. Several times the protagonists note that somebody's just shot off more bullets than their gun should be able to hold.
-   In John Scalzi's **Old Man's War** series, the standard issue gun that each soldier is given (the MP-35) is powered by an ammo block of nanites that can create eight different types of ammunition. While the blocks don't last forever, they hold 100 times more ammo than a regular rifle.
-   **Ready Player One**: Firearms in the OASIS never run out of bullets, as more ammo gets teleported into the weapons whenever necessary. It's still necessary to be mindful of how many shots one's taken, however, as there's a monthly bill on ammunition that can get expensive quickly.
-   Curveball, a minor Epic from **The Reckoners Trilogy**, has the power that any gun he uses will never run out of bullets.
-   Downplayed with Merlin's prototype revolvers in **Safehold**. They're normal revolvers, with six shots each. But since the only firearms anyone else has are flintlock pistols that have at the most two shots a gun (and that only with the double-barreled models), they still get treated as this trope in their first appearances.
-   Tim and Tom, two gunslinging geezers in **The Worst Shots in the West**, manage to accidentally kill a hundred man gang using **revolvers**.
-   David Drake's **Redliners** uses the abovementioned "tiny bullets" justification, with the titular Space Marines' "stinger" weapons being described as electromagnetically accelerating grain-sized pellets at high velocities, with 200 per magazine. Yet, it is actually a subversion, as despite that a great deal of attention is given to proper ammunition management and very frequent mentions are made of troops reloading between or during fights. It also points out that the drawback of such tiny projectiles is that, while many fit in a magazine, you also have to fire ''a lot'' of them at the enemy to achieve much beyond sandblasting them a little.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Live-Action TV

-   **Angel**: In the Season 5 episode "Underneath", Lindsay's (fake) wife fires an Uzi continuously for almost ten straight seconds.
-   **Bosch**: Near the end of Season 2, when Bosch and his partner approach the cabin where the season's Big Bad is holed up, the villain opens up with a long unbroken spray of fire, emptying several times more ammo than can be stored in his rifle's 30-round magazine.
-   **Breaking Bad**: In "One Minute", Hank is attacked by the Salamanca twins. Between Leonel and Hank, Leonel's pistol is fired 14 times before it is empty and Marco fires his 11 times before needing to reload. Since they both carry a Colt Gold Cup National Match (essentially an M1911A1), they would've only had 8 shots each at most (7 in the magazine and 1 in the chamber).
-   **Brooklyn Nine-Nine**: Parodied in an episode where the detectives investigate a burglary surrounding a TV cop show, and Detective Peralta keeps badgering the producers to name a character after him. In a sign of how immensely irritating they found him, not only does "Jake Peralta" turn out to be a cannibalistic serial killer and self-described "biggest pervert who ever lived", but he ends his story with one cop shooting him at least a hundred times with a handgun without ever reloading.
-   **Combat! (1962)**: Neither Pvt. Kirby's BAR nor Sgt Saunders's Thompson need a lot of reloading. In fact, the rest of the squad seldom need to reload their M1's.
-   **Garth Marenghis Darkplace**: After remarking that he only has five shots left in his revolver, Dr. Rick Dagless, M.D. fires off nine shots in a row. Thorton Reed is also known for firing his shotgun repeatedly without reloading, often in a clearly different background. It's deliberately So Bad, It's Good, so it gets a pass.
-   **Heroes**: In one episode, Ando and Hiro take cover as a stripper and a cop begin firing at each other. They fire countless times at each other, even though they both have "regular" guns, and the stripper even has a bullet left when they're done shooting. Commented on and mocked on the audio commentary for that episode.
-   **Kamen Rider** has an abundance of toyetic firearms which never seem to need reloading. In some shows such as **Kamen Rider 555** or **Kamen Rider Gaim**, the guns **do** need to reload after a few shots... by pressing a button or pulling a lever on the gun, which causes it to magically and instantly restock its ammo.
-   **The Muppet Show**: The Swedish Chef in one episode shoots three bagels with a blunderbuss, which can only have one shot at a time, and 5-10 minutes of reloading before shooting again. He shoots two bagels after the first without reloading.
-   **Mystery Science Theater 3000**: Lampshaded in "Escape 2000", when Crow remarks of the main character: "He must be playing in God Mode with unlimited ammo."
-   **Police Squad!**, being a parody of cop shows, features a lot of this. In the first episode, Frank gets into a gunfight where he fires around thirteen shots from a six-shot revolver before he runs out of ammo... against a criminal less than ten feet from him.
-   **Sledge Hammer!**: Lampshade Hanging, where almost every episode had this trope. (Heck, every time we look at the chamber of Sledge's gun it's not loaded, but ten seconds later the revolver can fire ten rounds without him even touching a bullet.) In one episode during a shootout, Da Chief yells "Where the hell is he getting all this ammo?"
-   **Stargate-verse**:
    -   Often plays this straight, particularly noticeable when after firing a P90 for a few seconds, you can still see that the magazine is full thanks to its see-through properties.
    -   Staffs and other Energy Weapons have nearly limitless power, and can be used good as new despite millennia of neglect. The power cell from a single staff was sufficient to power a wormhole to another galaxy, albeit only once and with heavy modification. Likewise, in **Stargate Atlantis**, Wraith stunners never need a recharge. Traveller energy pistols, however, have been shown to run dry eventually, but the character that accomplished that used one to melt through an Ancient door at full power and fired continuously for at least a minute.
-   **Star Trek: The Original Series**: In "Shore Leave", Sulu finds a six-shot revolver. He fires four shots from it while doing some target practice, then Kirk uses it later to fire three more shots at the knight.
-   **Torchwood**: The episode "Something Borrowed" is fairly bad about this. In one scene, Owen fires his pistol roughly two dozen times without pausing to reload. Could be hand-waved with alien tech...
-   **The Walking Dead (2010)**: Hershel in Season 2 fires eleven shots over the limit with his Remington 870 5-shot.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Pinball

-   You'll begin every session of **Doom (Zen Studios)** with a pistol that has unlimited ammunition.

---
Bottomless Magazines Example in Tabletop Games

-   **BattleTech**: Battle Armor only tracks ammunition for missile weapons under normal game rules. Typically, this isn't a huge issue as most Battle Armor carry a couple dozen shots for most ballistic weapons and if they're out in the open making shots for more than six rounds it typically indicates that either the enemy forces are being routed or the squad is about to get splattered by artillery or a Battlemech.
-   **Eclipse Phase**: Most guns fire flechettes or electromagnetically accelerated projectiles small enough that you can in essence hold an infinite quantity of ammo on your person; the recommended rule is to ignore total ammunition entirely and only make players pay attention to the magazines, which need to be switched out when they're empty and can prevent certain firing patterns when they're partially depleted.
-   **Feng Shui**, in all its cinematic glory, offers a gun schtick that specifically replicates this trope. A character who purchases three shticks in Lightning Reload is allowed infinite ammo and never needs to reload **no matter the circumstances**.
-   **Fudge**: Players don't keep track of ammo, instead the GM declares that they've run out whenever it is most dramatic.
-   **GURPS**
    -   The "Infinite Ammunition" option means the players always have extra bullets or arrows. It's also a perk in the **Gun Fu** splatbook.
    -   **GURPS Magic** has the enchantment "Cornucopia" which allows a container to always a single count of projectile or ammo ready. You have to take it out by hand, so I doesn't work on magazines.
-   **Hong Kong Action Theatre**: As long as your gunplay attack rolls on D20 don't come up a 3 or worse, you can blast off to your heart's content, but if you do roll that 3 or worse, you need to take a full round to reload. This can sometimes get annoying if this happens two to three shots into a freshly-loaded mag.
-   **It Came From The Late Late Late Show**: You're playing an actor in a B-movie. Any missile weapons you get have the same number of shots as your Fame score (basically your experience points). If your actor has forty-eight Fame points, then the derringer he's got up his sleeve has forty-eight shots.
-   **Mutant Chronicles**: Played with in 3rd edition. You can buy reloads for your guns, but the only time you use them is when the player rolls badly enough to get a Reload result, or the storyteller spends Dark Symmetry Points to force a Reload, or for special maneuvers that increase the damage and the chance to hit, like fully automatic fire. Otherwise all guns have bottomless magazines.
-   **Mutants & Masterminds** generally assumes that weapons operate under this trope, with a PC's blaster running out of ammo counting as a complication.
-   **Mutant: Year Zero**: Scrap and Breach-loading firearms only have one shot per round and can only be reloaded on move turns. Weapon artifacts that have any sort of multi-bullet chamber or magazine do not have to be reloaded at all, as the game assumes you reload outside of combat.
-   **Pathfinder**: The empyreal lord Cernunnos spontaneously creates fresh arrows when firing a bow.
-   **Scion**: The god-level War Purview boon Blessing of Ammunition gives a gunslinger this ability. In fact, if the character is willing to kiss a permanent Willpower point goodbye, the effect is **permanent**.
-   **Sniper** has optional rules for a Super-Soldier, including never needing to reload.
-   **Spirit of the Century**: Played straight. Following the pulp tradition, characters generally don't have to track shots and are assumed to reload as needed without having to take explicit actions to do so; but running out of ammunition can still happen when "dramatically appropriate", such as by a relevant aspect being compelled to earn that character another Fate point for his or her trouble or as a possible consequence of losing an exchange in a gun-related conflict. There's also the stunt "One Shot Left", which lets a character who has it make **one** attack at a significant bonus by declaring it to be his or her last shot...but then he or she definitely **is** out of ammo for any and all of his or her weapons until further notice.
-   **Super Awesome Action Heroes**: You never run out of ammo as long as you mention that you grab an extra clip.
-   **Warhammer 40,000**:
    -   One of the first symptoms of the Obliterator virus is, along with absorbing weapons, the ability to conjure ammunition.
    -   More traditionally in line with this trope, there's the Space Marines' bolters. Most images and models of them show them carrying no spare magazines for reloads at all yet they are described as fighting and shooting for hours — even days — on end. **Dawn Of War 2** shows them taking magazines out of their Awesome Backpack to reload. That being said, those backpacks never run out of magazines either.
    -   The ork species-wide psychic field (the one that really does ensure that Red Ones Go Faster) is often used as an explanation as to how their enormous rapid-fire weapons never run out of ammo, although it's more a "heat of the moment" thing: who has time to look at ammo counters when you nee to make More Dakka by pulling the trigger?
-   **Wild Talents**: A superhero game taking place in a world in which Reed Richards is most definitely NOT useless, the influence of super intelligent heroes has made it so the vast majority of firearms in use after the 1960's are electromagnetic railguns with magazines containing hundreds of tiny bullets.
-   **The World of Darkness**:
    -   **Mage: The Awakening**: There is an actual magical item **called** a "bottomless magazine". It isn't actually literally bottomless. Instead it is enchanted to continuously teleport bullets from a specially set aside cache (containing hundreds of them) into the magazine.
    -   **Mage: The Ascension**: Any mage with even a small amount of matter could infinitely fire a gun so long as the magazine was large enough that a mundane viewer couldn't keep count. With more obviously small-mag guns you could only cheat a little bit (firing six rounds from a revolver was common, when most revolvers hold only five shots) but even then you could always pull more from your pocket without the universe calling you on it.
    -   **Werewolf: The Apocalypse**.
        -   The urbane Glass Walkers know a Gift that transports rounds directly from spare cartridges to the gun. The Garou temporarily skirts the inconvenience of reloading as long as he has mags on his person somewhere.
        -   Another Gift (Garefena's Crown, Level 2) gives them the infinite-ammo cheat for the duration of the scene. The cost is one Gnosis point, and you have to wear a hat.
        -   Also, they can create magical one-shot items called Bottomless Magazines, which do just what you'd think they do for one scene.
        -   The Cyber Dogs camp had a cyber-fetish solution to the problem of reloading as well: A surgical steel tube into their own stomach, which allowed bullets to mystically form there and be fed out to the gun.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Video Games

-   **Halo: Combat Evolved**: Although most modern FPS games do require you to reload your guns, some feature unrealistically large magazines, allowing you to fire for a prolonged period of time before needing to reload. In this game, for example, the assault rifle loads 60 rounds of 7.62mm FMJ ammo, which would make the mag **much** larger than it actually appears in-game; its replacement in **Halo 3** dropped it down to a more reasonable (but still too large for its size) 32, and then the DMR in **Halo: Reach** only fits 15 rounds in mags of the same size.
-   **Black**: The M4 Carbine had an unrealistically large mag size of 70 rounds (despite being a standard 30 round mag in appearance). Then again, it was admitted by one of the artists that visual style and aesthetics were prioritized over accurate depictions.
-   **Command & Conquer: Renegade** features an assault rifle toting a 100-round mag. It may be noticeably larger than normal, but it's still far too small to hold that much ammo.
-   **Final Fantasy IV** is a notable exception within the RPG genre, as any bow-wielding character must have arrows to fire (mostly to allow you to use different ammunition). In the DS remake, you only have to buy one generic arrow-type item, which was indeed bottomless, carried over from **Final Fantasy XII** 's ammo system.
-   **Ace Combat** and **Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X.** do the same - launched missiles rematerialize on their hardpoints when the player is able to use them again, and cannons have infinite ammo (only on lower difficulties for the former, governed by a heat gauge in the latter). **Ace Combat Infinity** has a variation, where the cannon has a limited amount of ammo, but will instantaneously replenish itself after you let go of the button upon being emptied, and regular missiles as well will very slowly regenerate two at a time once you run yourself out of ammo. **Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere** technically has finite missiles... and your airplane packs at least 100 of them.
-   **After Burner Climax**, where missiles will automatically rematerialize on your plane after they have been fired, to say nothing of the Macross Missile Massacre "Climax Mode" Limit Break where you can lock onto and fire on more targets than the usual max missile capacity of your plane. By the end of the game you probably have launched more missiles than are available to a small country's air force. Your cannon also has unlimited rounds. Then again, you are a One-Man Air Force going up against what feels like an entire air force.
-   The Pepper Grinder in **Alice: Madness Returns** will never run out of pepper, and the Teapot Cannon will never run out of Tea Grenades. Instead, firing them too much will cause them to overheat, and you'll have to wait a few seconds before firing them again. Also, you have an infinite stock of Clockwork Bombs, with the only restriction being that one must detonate before you may place another.
-   Occurs in **Army of Two**'s Overkill mode.
-   **Battalion Wars**: A player-controlled Assault Veteran can fire indefinitely with only the danger of overheating his weapon to stop him from shooting momentarily.
-   **Battlefield**:
    -   In **Battlefield 1942**, this is treated oddly. Guns have limited magazines, and soldiers carry no more than 3 grenades, but suitcase-sized boxes contain infinite amounts of ammo. Whether a weapon is used by Americans, Brits, Canadians, Soviets, Germans, or the Japanese, it can be reloaded from any ammo crate. Even worse: if, for example, an Allied soldier uses one of these crates to grenade spam, he will throw Mk 2 grenades. If the player picks up a weapon from a dead Axis soldier, he will start taking Stielhandgranates out of the same grenade crate and throwing them.
    -   **Battlefield 2** has the MEC Assault and Medic classes' AK-101, which has two magazines taped together. The reloading animation always consists of your character taking the current magazine out and flipping it over to load the other one — he never switches out those two magazines for a fresh pair. What makes it odd is that this **also** still counts as dropping the other magazine entirely and thus losing every bullet still in it, like with every other weapon in the game.
-   **Battlestar Galactica Online** usually averts this but plays it straight with mining cannons. The downside is that they simply don't have the combat specs to compare with full military-use guns.
-   **Bayonetta**:
    -   The series, already famous for its Dual-Dual Wielding of guns which are allegedly repeaters in the hands and feet, uses this like **Devil May Cry**. Made funnier by the fact that nobody is sure where the magazine is.
    -   A post-boss fight cutscene shows her loading in her lipstick to shoot Balder, the barrels being in the double-barrel shotgun configuration. Her primary guns **don't have any magazines**.
    -   It takes a bit of digging, but the game explains the lack of magazines: her custom guns don't have any magazines because she's making the bullets out of her spirit power channeled through the gemstone built into the gun, and they're being placed directly into the chamber without the need for storage.
-   In the original Xbox/Play Station 2 game **Black**, after completing a level on multiple difficulties, you can unlock "Silver Weapons" which make the guns shinier, and invoke this trope. Which makes sense, when you start with a pistol or shotgun (Reloading Optional), but when you find a RPG mid-level, pick it up, and can turn anything breakable in the level broken, it turns it up to eleven.
-   In **Bloodborne**, all firearms are loaded with Quicksilver Bullets, a type of mercury bullets infused with a hunter's blood, the hunters can also use their own blood as makeshift ammo. While there is a capacity of how many ammo you can carry, you don't have to reload your guns regardless the fact that they are **break-action guns**. The only time you see a hunter reloading their guns is when Father Gascoigne reload his own Hunter Pistol, which fires blunderbuss rounds.
-   The **Boktai** series has a protagonist whose main firearm is powered by sunlight. Give him some sunscreen and he can literally shoot all day.
-   **Borderlands**:
    -   Some guns are equipped with a regenerating ammo stat, and one particular gun, The Dove, doesn't consume ammo at all, and requires no reload. This is lampshaded by the description for The Dove itself, which is "Sometimes I forget to reload..."
    -   Some class abilities allow more ammo to be used than some guns can hold. In some cases this allows for five shotgun rounds to be used when normally two are loaded as well as sub-machinegun and assault rifles being able to hold as much as THOUSANDS of rounds.
    -   In **Borderlands 2**, there is a Legendary pistol dubbed Infinity that literally has infinite ammo, and operates like The Dove, with no reload, hence the name. It even fires in an infinity shape!
    -   S&S Munitions guns in **Borderlands 1** and Bandit guns in **2** also have their manufacturer gimmick being having **huge** magazines — an average Bandit submachinegun can have as much as 120 bullets per clip.
    -   **Borderlands 3** has the Children of the Vault guns, the latest incarnation of Bandit guns, which don't use magazines and fire directly out of your ammo reserve. To keep the game balanced, they build up heat as you fire them; if you hold the trigger too long, which typically happens after firing 50-70 pistol/rifle bullets, they will overheat.
-   The player's weapon in **The Breach** never needs reloading. Even when it's upgraded to fire three bullets at once.
-   **Bullet Witch** intentionally uses a variant of this trope. One of the powers the lead character possesses is to convert part of her constantly-regenerating supply of MP into more bullets or shells for her gun. She can't fire forever without reloading, but she can reload forever.
-   The World War I era Turn-Based Tactics game **Call of Cthulhu: The Wasted Land** has all the characters having an infinite supplies of ammunitions and absolutely never had to reload them.
-   **Call of Duty**:
    -   Played straight in both total ammunition and lack of reloading with mounted weapon emplacements, even when they were just fixed-in-place versions of personal weapons, such as the M249 SAW, that **do** have finite ammunition and reloads. Some such weapons, like the recurring M134 Minigun, do have heat gauges, though.
    -   Your reward for collecting all the intel across the game in **Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare** is the Infinite Ammunition cheat. With it active, while weapons with heat gauges still overheat and your thrown/set explosives are still limited, actual ammunition otherwise lasts forever, even for single-shot weapons like the RPG-7 and grenade launchers.
    -   **World at War** does something similar with the flamethrower, which never runs out of fuel, but has a heat gauge that fills continuously while the trigger is held. The secondary part of this trope is also played straight in the mission "Black Cats". The ammo for your PBY Catalina's various gun turrets runs out just as another group of Zeroes prepares for an attack run on you, right before the Corsairs show up.
    -   The multiplayer modes for most of the games from **World at War** onwards allow the player to attach extended magazines to their weapons to get a little more ammo. With the exception of **World at War** itself, **Black Ops**<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>, and **Black Ops III**, the weapon model will not change to account for this, and the player instead somehow stuffs up to half an extra magazine's contents into an already-full one. Singleplayer will also generally give a handful of weapons greater mag capacities than they have in multiplayer; the first mission played as Ramirez in **Modern Warfare 2**, in particular, gives you a SCAR-H that holds 30 rounds in its 20-round magazine, and which also has an underbarrel shotgun attached that fits 7 shells into a shortened mag tube that barely holds three.
    -   **Call of Duty: Black Ops II** does this in a mission where Big Bad Raul Menendez attempts to fight his way through rebels to save his sister, Josefina. He's so blinded with rage that all of his weapons are given unlimited ammo<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>, with the SPAS-12 he starts with also holding twice as many shells as it should and being able to be fully reloaded if there are more than three or four shells missing just by dropping it off-screen for half a second.
-   If you use Munitions attacks in **Champions Online**, while in theory your ammunition only lasts as long as your energy does... the Munitions Energy Builder attack requires you fire **even more** bullets to charge it back up again.
-   Pick the Assault Rifle powerset in **City of Heroes** and blast away. Even using Full Auto doesn't empty your mag. Of course, this gun is a SMGsniperrifleshotgungrenadelauncherflamethrowermachinegun that disappears when you're not using it. Same deal with Archery and Trick Archery, and the Dual Pistol powerset.
-   **Command & Conquer**:
    -   Ballistic missile launchers, like the GLA Scud launchers in **Generals** and Soviet V3 Rockets in **Red Alert 2**, are basically a rocket on a truck, visible all the time. A new missile magically appears in the launcher after every shot. **C&C**'s fliers typically have an ammo limit that requires a regular return to an airbase for reloads, but ground units are almost always unlimited.
    -   Helicopters in the original game would fire a salvo of rockets, wait a bit to reload, and then fire another salvo of rockets. Endlessly.
    -   C Lore handwaves this; all weapons systems make their own ammo.
    -   And then **Renegade** averts this for infantry firearms, requiring a reload and limited by reserve ammo, but the pistol has a limited mag with infinite reserve (a la the later Left 4 Dead). Vehicles still play this straight; even the Orcas/Helicopters have infinite ammo now.
-   **Dead Island** normally averts this trope and requires players to scavenge ammo for guns and keep track of their throwing weapons (which are usually just regular melee weapons that happen to be thrown at that moment), but Purna's special ability lets her use her personal sidearm with unlimited ammo for a limited time, and Logan's gives him unlimited throwing knives.
-   **Dead Rising** does this... but with good reason. You can't pick up new ammunition for your gun, instead you need more guns. And reloading in the middle of zombies coming at you? That would suck. Still doesn't excuse the survivors, who seem to have infinite ammunition, anyway... and are too stupid to use them properly.
-   **Devil May Cry**:
    -   If you cannot pump out a constant stream of handgun bullets, it just won't be the same. In fact, Hideki Kamiya stated that he wanted to keep the action of the game as fast as possible, and forcing the character to stop and reload would only slow things down.
    -   **DMC4**'s Nero needs to reload his revolver and spends a good few seconds in a cutscene pulling off a slo-mo Unorthodox Reload; but in regular gameplay, you can keep firing as long as you want, only when you stop will Nero flick his wrist, presumably reloading it at super human speeds. Partly subverted in **Devil May Cry 5**, where he has to load in bullets for charged shots.
    -   Lady is a peculiar case; although she is shown reloading her small arms regularly, she seems to carry more magazines that should be possible, while she is never seen reloading her "Kalina Ann" rocket launcher.
-   **diep.io** has a particularly egregious example: **none** of the tanks ever run out of ammo. The Overseer branch can only have a set amount of drones (usually 8), but have an unlimited amount waiting to come into battle.
-   **The Dishwasher** gets "The Arsenal" in the first game while both the Dishwasher and Yuki get an SMG and a Gatling arm in the second with limited effectiveness in most situations. They later get far more effective shotguns. Both weapons (which The Arsenal consists of) can be reloaded as much as you want, with the character ejecting the old mag/shell, with the new magazine magically showing up as soon as the old one hits the ground.
-   There is only one weapon out of many that use this trope in **Dynamite Dux** — the water pistol, which is the only way to harm fire bosses, thus justifying the trope. It doesn't really matter anyway, as the water pistols are lost shortly after the boss dies.
-   **EVE Online** averts this when players use Hybrid and Projectile turrets as well as Missile weapons. Laser turrets just feed off the ship capacitor, as regular "ammo crystals" don't break (the upgraded variants do though). Fortunately, combat ships all have enough cargo space that one can just carry nothing BUT ammo and usually never run out. Of course, the proportions on the ammunition are rather unrealistic, and the ammo is **One Size Fits All**, for example working all the way from Dual 425mm autocannons to 1400mm howitzer Artillery.
-   In **Fall To His Death**/**Fatal Descent**, a character mentions that a book he is editing has 13 bangs from a 6-shot gun.
-   Happens with two Bosses in **Final Fight** (Not a shooter, because almost no-one uses guns, so the above rule really doesn't apply). The third Boss, Edi.E, uses a handgun when brought down to about half of his health, and has unlimited ammunition. The final boss, Belger, uses a crosbow, and never runs out of quarrels. (And unlike Edi.E, he can use it from the beginning of the fight.)
-   **Fury Unleashed** uses the limited magazine/infinite clips variation.
-   In **Geist**, you are a ghost that must possess other soldiers in order to fight. You have to reload, but you never run out spare magazines or ammo, ever. Since you frequently jump from body to body, and thus wouldn't be able to keep track of ammo anyway for a significant amount of time, it's an Acceptable Breaks from Reality.
-   The arcade **G.I. Joe** game gives all four playable characters infinite rounds for the guns they carry, and they can be powered up to fire even faster as long as you avoid getting hit.
-   **Granado Espada** uses it too. Of course, it is done for class balance, but there is something funny about the musketeer class using the skill "Covering Fire", which shoots 20 rounds in full-automatic mode — from a front-loading matchlock rifle.
-   **Grand Theft Auto III** and all the later **Grand Theft Auto** games until **IV** used this with pump-action shotguns, presumably to compensate for the slower firing speed since automatic and double-barreled varieties starting from **Vice City** did have to reload. Submachine guns, which normally have limited bullets per magazine like the other (non-pump-shotgun) weapons, also get this treatment when firing them from a vehicle, with magazines simply instantly replenishing themselves whenever they're emptied or whenever you let go of the button for looking out whichever window you just shot out from.
-   **Gungrave**, much like its companion anime. Beyond the Grave's dual "Cerberus" handguns can be fired as much as you want without ever having to touch the magazines, so much so that the games never even make it apparent **where** the magazine is (it slides in underneath the barrel like a shotgun tube according to the anime). His coffin's special attacks do have a limit, however, but even though they still involve physical projectiles, you never need to do any more to replenish them than just killing a lot of people in a short enough time.
-   The first **Half-Life** has the Hornet Gun/Hive hand that **regrew** ammo. **Opposing Force** had the Shockroach, which recharged itself, and the Barnacle, which apparently doesn't need ammo. Living infinite ammo weaponry, "lovely".
-   **Half-Life 2**:
    -   The game and its Episodes have the fortuitous Infinite Ammunition Crates. Slightly believable for pistol and machine gun ammunition, for which they could reasonably contain a large amount, less so for crates of missiles that are also always placed near an enemy that can only be killed with explosives. Even less so for the absolutely tiny crate on the back of the dune buggy you use for "Highway 17", which is just as full of SMG ammo as the gigantic pre-placed crates before and after.
    -   **Half-Life 2** also has the infinitely throwable bugbait. The Vortigaunt that teaches you how to use it does explain throwing it as "tearing off a piece" of it, even if that's not what's actually happening on-screen.
    -   In the **HL1** mod **Afraid of Monsters: Directors Cut**, obtaining all 4 endings gained a weapon that had a scope and infinite ammo. Considering most of the game is freaking dark, the Muzzle Flashlight will be very handy. The Spiritual Successor **Cry of Fear** likewise has an infinite-ammo FAMAS assault rifle for beating Nightmare difficulty.
-   **Halo**: Invoked from **Halo: Reach** onward; when making a custom multiplayer/firefight mode, in setting character weapon traits, there are two kinds of infinite ammo: vanilla (infinite extra mags), and this trope. The second option also turns off the "overheat" mechanic of plasma weapons or turrets. It can play merry hell with aiming reticles.
-   **Heavy Rain**: Played with when Shelby has a shootout late in the game. Shelby's gun is a model which can hold up to seventeen shots, and throughout the encounter there will be seventeen targets to shoot. Assuming you do all of the QTEs perfectly, this trope is avoided and Shelby has exactly enough ammo needed. If you fuck up some QTEs, you'll end up firing multiple shots per target and generate bullets out of nowhere, invoking this trope.
-   **Hellgate: London**: Firearms never run out of ammo.
-   In **Intrusion 2** so long as you have ammo weapons can be fired indefinitely, with the exception of the grenade launcher which automatically reloads after each shot.
-   **JASF: Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters** has your missiles regenerate over time.
-   In the **Jazz Jackrabbit** games, your special weapons all have limited ammo, but the basic blaster you start out with has no limits (indicated, appropriately enough, by an Infinity sign in the ammo meter).
-   In **Just Cause 2**, detachable mounted guns are found in most bases and have limitless ammo, detached or otherwise. On top of that, the mounted guns destroy anything that creates chaos when blown up in about two seconds flat; finding a mounted gun makes most stronghold takeover missions a breeze. More Dakka indeed.
-   **Killer7**: Even though every character has to reload (except for Kevin, who uses knives), they never run out of extra bullets or magazines. Dan and MASK in particular get upgrades about halfway through the game that let them reload faster, by speeding up the part of the animation where they dump spent rounds — and then completely skipping the part where they load in new ones before closing up and getting back to shooting. MASK's penultimate upgrade later gives him full-on infinite ammo.
-   In **The Last of Us**, all enemies and friendly NPC's have infinite ammo, though Ellie stops having infinite ammo whenever there is a section where she is controlled by the player. There is also a section where Joel takes control of a sniper rifle with infinite ammo.
-   **Left 4 Dead**:
    -   Your pistols' magazines have finite bullets, but the magazines themselves are infinite. Other weapons can eventually run out of ammo, but there are strategically placed ammo piles lying around that you can use to reload nearly any of the guns you find as many times as you need. Such piles are spaced out farther in the sequel, however, so running out of ammo is a much more common occurrence, unless you're using pistols or melee weapons to save ammo or swapping primary weapons regularly. Also, some weapons have unusually-higher round capacities than depicted in the player models (both the Uzi and Assault Rifle in the first game hold 50 rounds in magazines that should hold about 30, for instance).
    -   And played perfectly straight in the Gib Fest mutation; every player starts with an M60 LMG, with infinite ammo. Combine with boomer bile to get all the common infected in one spot, and, to quote another of Valve's games, "SO MUCH BLOOD! HA HA HA!"
    -   In the same mode, there's a small chance that the AI director will glitch and spawn a Grenade Launcher (which it shouldn't, as the mode basically erases all weapons from the spawn table). Using it reveals that the Grenade Launcher was coded with a 1 shot-magazine, but was **never given a firing cooldown**. You can literally lob grenades at the speed of an assault rifle at zombies (the game mode removes reloading on primary weapons, as the M60 doesn't have a reload animation).
    -   Pistols were originally given ammo reserves, but Valve decided that running out of ammo on both your primary and secondary weapons and resorting to weakly shoving sprinting zombies was no fun. Similarly, melee weapons were originally supposed to break after a certain amount of hits, but it left you with a single pistol at the end so instead they became infinite-use. The Chainsaw is the sole exception to this, as it's so incredibly powerful that you can literally run with it on through the entire map if you had the ammo (and there is another mutation where this is the only weapon you have, with infinite fuel like Gib Fest).
    -   Mounted miniguns and heavy machine guns also have infinite ammo (despite the former using a small ammo box that would, at its rate of fire, empty itself in about four seconds), but they overheat so quickly and take so long to cool down (only the hordes from a finale will keep coming long enough for it to cool down before you've killed everything and moved on) that they may as well be limited.
-   **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild**: Unlike Link, bow-wielding enemies have unlimited arrows and can shoot at him forever without running dry of ammo. This can be exploited by the player, because their arrows can become embedded in surfaces like wood, soil and sand, allowing Link to pick them up when they miss and have access to a steady (but slow) supply of free arrows.
-   **LISA** has a rather odd inversion with its Russian Roulette minigames. The two (the party member you're risking and your opponent) can pull the trigger a lot more than the gun should seemingly allow, **without** ever firing a bullet.
-   A training mission in **The Matrix: Path of Neo** has Tank lampshade this trope by outright telling you "In this simulation, you'll never run out of bullets". Otherwise, you have to have a special ability equipped for this to work.
-   In **MechWarrior Living Legends**, the humble Machine Gun has infinite ammo unlike every other projectile or missile based weapon, albeit with an Over Heating mechanic. The machine gun originally had ammo, but the weapon's DPS was so low and the magazine so huge the developers just made it infinite to prevent players from accidentally wasting valuable spare ammo space on it.
-   **Medal of Honor**:
    -   The original **Medal of Honor** for the Play Station lampshaded this trope. One of the unlockable bonus cheat modes was called 'American Movie Mode', which gave unlimited ammo (and had the enemy soldiers speak English instead of German).
    -   Zigzagged in **Medal of Honor: Vanguard**, The MG42 has one when the player uses it but surprisingly, when the enemies use it they have to reload occasionally, allied soldiers will even tell the player when the enemy with the MG42 is reloading.
-   A common item throughout the **Metal Gear** series is a bandana that grants its wearer infinite ammunition. It's typically awarded as a story completion bonus of some capacity.
    -   **Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty**:
        -   In Snake's fight with Olga she regularly has to reload her USP, but never seems to run out of spare magazines... until you defeat her and take her USP for yourself, of course, at which point you will not find any ammo for it until you've gone far enough away that the game will remove her unconscious body from the arena.
        -   Also, late in the game, when Raiden and Snake help each other fight their way out of Arsenal Gear, Snake assures Raiden that he can offer ammo if Raiden runs out; when Raiden asks if he has enough, Snake points at his headband and says "infinite ammo". Since in the first **Metal Gear Solid** Snake earns the infinite ammo bandana if you comple the game without submitting to Ocelot's torture, this confirms the canonicity of that ending as well as the bandana's effects in-universe.
    -   **Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater**:
        -   The game plays this straight but still lampshades it with the Patriot, a gun you obtain after beating the game once. When you call up Sigint over the radio, he asks how it never runs out of ammo or needs to be reloaded. Snake's answer: "Because the internal feed mechanism is shaped like an infinity symbol." It apparently explains the whole thing adequately.
        -   The on-rails action against the Shagohod, where you do get unlimited ammo of whatever weapons you had at the moment. The explanation is that the sidecar of the motorcycle that you're riding in has lots of ammunition in it. Which gets more than a little ridiculous when you start using the RPG and quick reload (equipping and unequipping weaponry, a bit of bizarre MGS-logic).
        -   The "Infinity" face-paint is this game's equivalent of the infinite ammo bandana. One camo pattern for Snake's uniform unlocked by beating the game once does the same for his battery-powered items.
    -   **Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots** averts this with four exceptions: mounted weapon emplacements (the machine gun turrets have infinite ammo while the mortars are single-shot but each use causes a mortar shell to appear for loading), the two vehicular chase sequences (finite ammo but infinite magazines), and the Patriot (the only personal weapon with infinite ammo).
-   In **Metal Slug**, the default pistol never runs out of bullets (because otherwise you'd be screwed). However, wait after firing a certain number (or more) of shots (9 for the male characters, who have automatics, and 6 for the revolver-packing girls), and your character will yank the magazine out and replace it. Not that they **need** to, but the animators just felt like paying attention to that detail.
-   In **Metal Slug Defense**, the reloading animation is used as a form of "lag time" after a character fires their special move.
-   In **Mortal Kombat 9**, Stryker's gun never needs reloading during a match. (But he is seen reloading it in one scene between fights during the Story Mode.)
-   In **Mortal Kombat X**, Erron Black does this **with revolvers**.
-   **Muri**: The initial gun shot has infinite ammo, and there are powerups for infinite ammo of each type of shot, scattered throughout certain levels, like for Rapid and MKV in Level 2.
-   In **Overwatch**, D.Va can fire her Mech guns and Moira can keep firing her drain beam without reloading. The other characters need to do some sort of reload after firing enough shots, but they all carry an endless supply of ammunition. Reaper in particular will discard his shotguns when he is out of ammo and pull out two new ones from Hammerspace.
-   In **PAYDAY 2**, most weapons carry more ammo in their magazines than they should, even with you attaching extended versions to them.
    -   The Reinfeld 880 and Locomotive 12G shotguns are probably the most notable, as both get a pair of attachments that can increase the number of shells they hold at a time by two each. Those attachments are, respectively, a very small extension for the magazine tube that should **at best** add only one shell, and a shell-holding rack on the side of the gun that's nowhere **near** the mag tube and should, if anything, only increase your **total** ammo supply rather than how many shells you can stuff into the gun at once.
    -   Several skills increase the number of rounds held by the magazines of specific weapons, regardless of the magazine's actual physical size. Close By Aced adds 15 shells to shotguns with magazines; Surefire Basic adds 15 rounds to SMGs, LMGs, and Assault Rifles; and Gun Nut basic adds 5 rounds to pistols. The last one can be a little silly, as it also applies to revolvers, allowing them to hold 11 bullets when they clearly have 6 chambers.
    -   Other skills allow you to fire your weapons without consuming ammo. Swan Song Aced allows you 6 seconds of continuous fire, while Bulletstorm lets people who use your ammo bags gain up to 5 (Basic) or 15 (Aced) seconds, depending on how much ammo they replenished from the bag.
    -   The Ammo Efficiency skill is a downplayed version of this trope; every 3 (Basic) or 2 (Aced) consecutive headshots you get with SMGs, Assault Rifles, or Sniper Rifles fired in single-fire mode will return 1 round to your magazine. If your aim is on point, you can manage to squeeze 11 shots out of a 6 round magazine.
-   **PAYDAY 3** makes this possible with any weapon by the combination of two skills from the Mower tree: Ammo Funnel, which directly adds picked-up ammo to the gun's magazine, and Replenish, which automatically picks up ammo dropped by killed cops. Whilst both must be activated by gaining Edge, they can let you keep firing practically indefinitely.
-   **Perfect Dark Zero** has the M60 machine gun, equipped with a belt of maybe seven or eight rounds that somehow lasts for 80 shots before requiring a reload. There's also the FAMAS-esque Plasma Rifle, which being an energy weapon has an infinite supply of energy but requires time to recharge it after a long period of firing or using its Invisibility Cloak Secondary Fire.
-   **Pillars of Eternity** eschews any ammunition requirement for bows and firearms, unlike the **Dungeons & Dragons**\-based CRPGs it draws inspiration from.
-   Lampshaded in **Portal 2**'s Aperture Science Investment Opportunity trailer, with the turrets that shoot endless streams of bullets.
-   The sidequests in **\[PROTOTYPE\]** where you need to destroy stuff and kill folks using only a specific weapon or vehicle give you unlimited ammo for the duration of the sidequest. At other times, though, there is a finite stock of ammunition.
-   The **Princess Remedy** series uses guns that fire medical supplies and never runs out of shots.
-   **Quake II** and **Quake IV** have the blaster, an energy pistol with infinite ammunition. Which is rarely useful.
-   In **Rambo III** for the Sega Genesis, Rambo's primary weapon is a machine gun that, unlike some of his secondary weapons, never runs out of ammunition.
-   The shotgun in **Realms of the Haunting** never needs to be reloaded. Adam just fires the first round of the next reload when the gun is empty. Other cartridge-based guns require a reload sequence.
-   **Resident Evil**
    -   The rocket launcher is usually the most powerful weapon a player can obtain in these games, but you usually only have one shot at a time. Most of the games, however, have some way to unlock one with unlimited ammo. Never easily, of course — for example, in **Resident Evil 5**, you have to finish the game in under five hours, much easier said than done.
    -   **Resident Evil – Code: Veronica**. The protagonist hands her sidekick **empty** twin Ingram MAC-11s. A cutscene slightly later involves handing him a **single** magazine. He can keep blasting (in game and during cut-scenes) literally hundreds of bullets from both guns, up until a pivotal cutscene takes place (a cutscene which involves Steve firing both MAC-11s until they run out of ammo at the same time — despite the fact that 15 seconds earlier, he shoots a wall with a long burst with only one gun). To top it off, he'll still fire in both cutscenes even if the player drains the guns of ammo during the playable Steve sequence, with only his first line at the end of said sequence acknowledging whether he actually still has ammo or not.
    -   Once you clear the game and unlock the Survivors mini-game, you can fire Steve's twin MAC-11s for almost 30 continuous seconds before they run out, despite the fact that a MAC-11 empties a full magazine (32 rounds) in just under two seconds.
    -   Even more amusing are Steve's Gold Lugers. Claire actually finds them first, with no ammo in them. Then Steve takes them. Later on, Steve rescues Claire by going Guns Akimbo with the Gold Lugers, then trading them back to you - with no ammo. Not only that, but there's no ammo for them in **the entire game** — their use is strictly to place into a door so it unlocks. To add insult to injury, he actually complains that you "tricked him" since the MAC-11s have no ammo, then makes **you** grab that single magazine for him (though Claire gets back at him for this by making him act as a stepping stool to reach it).
    -   If you start **Resident Evil 3: Nemesis** on Easy Mode, you start with a fully loaded M4A1 and a single magazine — which contain **300 rounds, **each****. Combined, that gives you enough bullets to reach the second half of the game before they run out, provided that you use other weapons to kill Nemesis. And on that note, defeating the Nemesis in every optional fight makes him drop an attachment that allows you to give a single gun infinite ammunition.
        -   Fully-automatic weapons in general up to **Code Veronica**, including the above M4, another MAC-11 in **2**, and the AK in **CV**, are given a percentage-based ammunition system rather than tracking specific numbers of bullets, with the games varying in how many bullets make up each percentage but generally going for at least three, or at least 300 bullets per magazine that should hold around 30. This is typically made up for with A) Arbitrary Gun Power making them much weaker than just plinking away with your starting handgun (or blowing their heads off with the resident Magnum), and B) very little spare ammo for when you eventually run out (each game that follows this system has a single spare magazine for their respective automatic, **2**'s MAC-11 only available if you leave it until the B scenario, **3** starting you with one extra magazine for the M4, and **CV**'s AK only getting a half-full mag in the second half of the game).
    -   **Resident Evil 4** & **5** start the player off with reasonable, though a bit high, magazine sizes. The upgrade system plays this straight, eventually allowing your small handgun to hold 50+ bullets per mag, twelve rounds in a revolver, or **one hundred** shells in a shotgun - fully reloaded by just putting two more in. Don't forget about the infinite rocket launcher you can buy after defeating the game once.
    -   In **4** and **5** the Handcannon can also be upgraded to have infinite ammo. However, prior to getting its Exclusive upgrade that grants it unlimited ammunition, the Handcannon's ammo is **very** rare. **5** goes even further, in that you can do this with **any** gun. Played completely to trope in **4** with the Chicago Typewriter (a Thompson submachine gun). Amusingly, it does have a reload animation which doesn't do anything at all, except look awesome, moreso with Leon's unlockable mobster costume.
    -   **Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles** and **Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles**, being rail-shooters, gives the player's starting pistols infinite ammunition, on top of an upgrade system that lets guns hold increasingly-ridiculous amounts of ammo. In addition, counter-attacks can be used as many times as the prompt appears for the player, even if they look to take up some sort of resource — like Chris's counter-attack, wherein he jabs a knife into the attacker's head before kicking it away, without taking back the knife,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> or Rebecca's, wherein she pushes the offending zombie away and then blows it up with a **grenade**, without requiring any grenades in your inventory or taking one away if you do have any.
    -   The first two **Gun Survivor** games (along with **Dino Stalker**, a **Dino Crisis** spinoff) give the basic handguns infinite ammo as well.
    -   **Resident Evil: Outbreak** and **Outbreak File #2** offer "Infinity" mode, which can be purchased in the collection for 50,000 points after being unlocked. It makes guns bottomless and also keeps melee weapons from breaking.
    -   The **Resident Evil 4 (Remake)** has both flavors of infinite ammo: Bottomless magazines and bottomless bullet reserves. If Leon equips the Cat Ears, he gains infinite ammo for all weapons (excluding the Bolt Thrower and regular Rocket Launchers), however the magazine itself is **not** bottomless. Instead, it is treated as Leon having pockets full of ammo of all types stashed in his inventory. Thus, you must reload, but you still have infinite ammo. On the other hand, the Infinite Rocket Launcher comes with infinite shots and never has to be reloaded, and the Chicago Sweeper and Handcannon can be upgraded to have infinite ammo and never need to reload, allowing you to shoot forever. This can even be mixed. If you have the Chicago Sweeper and the Cat Ears, but haven't full upgraded the Sweeper, it will still need reloading, but you'll have infinite bullets to do so with. Once you get its exclusive upgrade, you'll then notice the ammo count vanish and you can now fire indefinitely.
-   In the MMO Third Person Shooter **S4 League**, most of the shooting weapons have limited magazine sizes but unlimited ammo reserves. Justified because it takes place in a virtual setting where ammo is unlimited because the designer said so.
-   **Saints Row 2**:
    -   The game allows you to unlock infinite ammo for different weapon types by completing diversions, on top of the weapons usually holding more bullets than their real-world counterparts would be able to (the most extreme examples being some shotguns, a double-barreled one holding six shells and a concealed cane-shotgun that should only hold one or two gets **sixteen**). **Saints Row: The Third** and beyond instead makes this an ability you can unlock at the maximum respect rank, and also has slightly-earlier upgrades that let you skip reloading entirely for weapons of specific types. There are also certain sections where you are given guns with infinite ammo, mainly during intense action sequences.
    -   The STAG weapons in the third game never have to be reloaded due to firing energy rounds. Zin weapons in **IV** work the same way. In both cases, they still have a finite ammo supply and will overheat if you hold down the trigger too long.
-   None of the projectile weapon wielders in **Samurai Warriors** needs to reload. In order from least to most ridiculous: Ina with her bow, Masamune with his pistols, Magoichi with his musket/rifle(/shotgun), Goemon with his backpack cannon, and Ieyasu with his cannon-spear.
-   Tony Montana in **Scarface: The World Is Yours** gains infinite ammunition when he enters a Blind Rage mode, then abruptly returns to needing to watch his ammo usage once he goes back to normal.
-   In **Scribblenauts**, YOU can only use firearms a certain number of times before they are destroyed. But anyone else can use a firearm infinitely.
-   **Septerra Core** handwaves this by explaining that the guns use a fancy piece of Applied Phlebotinum to synthesize ammo from energy harvested from the rotation of the planet's seven world shells.
-   **Serious Sam**
    -   In all games, the attachment of a "Techno-Magical Ammunition Replenisher" allows for the starting pistols to have infinite ammo, though you have to reload every certain number of shots. Similarly, the usage of an advanced fuel cell hand waves the unlimited run-time of the chainsaw. Multiplayer also has a server setting to let **every** gun have infinite ammo.
    -   In **Serious Sam 3**, there are infinite ammo crates similar to those found in **Half-Life 2**, which grant you an infinite reserve of rockets or C4 packs. You'll only find those where they're absolutely necessary.
-   The Terran marines of **StarCraft II** carry gauss rifles with magazines that must stretch all the way into hyperspace and back, since they can keep holding down the trigger and shooting things forever on full-auto without ever having to reload. And as we see in the cinematics, they are shooting **big** bullets. However, a couple of these cinematics avert the trope. Secondary material suggests the giant shoulderpads are for ammo storage. More mystifying is how missile-bearing units such as the Goliath never run out — or, for that matter, how hydralisks never run out of venomous spines.
-   **Stranglehold** plays this in the same manner as classic first-person shooters — as long as your gun has ammo, you can fire continuously without stopping to reload. In fact, the only time Tequila reloads is when he's gearing up to unleash a Barrage attack.
-   **Super Mario Bros.**:
    -   The Bill Blasters from the series games, which can fire an unlimited number of Bullet Bills. Adding to this is the fact that the Bills are approximately the same size as their Blasters. This is also true with Lakitus, especially in the early years where their Spinies are all the same size as their butts, which in turn are the same size as the Lakitus themselves, as with the Hammer Bros., which can throw an unlimited supply of hammers.
    -   Lampshaded in **Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door**. A character complains that her guidebook on a hammer-throwing enemy tells you everything except where they get the infinite supply of hammers.
-   **SWAT 4** averts this for human players and AI-controlled squadmates, but plays it completely straight for AI-controlled suspects.
-   In **Syndicate Wars** your agents have built-in micro-fusion reactors that create ammunition for their weapons. Where they're keeping those weapons, though, we don't ask.
    -   In the remake, the minigun plays this absolutely straight, without even a handwave.
-   **Tales Series:**
    -   **Tales of Innocence**: This is one of the few games in the series not stuck in Medieval Stasis, so guns are fairly common. Iria uses twin guns and Ricardo uses a shotgun. While they don't have to reload at any point, both have bullet belts incorporated into their designs. They just do it off-screen, apparently.
    -   Patty from **Tales of Vesperia** is the worst offender, using what appears to be a flintlock pistol. Some artes has her shoot from it several times.
    -   Ludger from **Tales of Xillia 2** also uses twin pistols which never need reloading. His movement speed takes a huge hit, however, when equipped with guns.
    -   Bizarrely played with in **Tales of Arise**. Shionne has a gun, and her design features a strap with bullets. Her gun appears to fire magic charges, and she never has to reload after normal attacks. Some of her special artes has her throw a bomb, that she also never runs out of. However, she has an option to shoot said bomb to make the blast stronger, and **these** bullets are limited. Moreover, if she runs out of said special bullets, she has to reload before using normal attacks… but not artes. And then there are Mystic Artes and Boost Strikes, for some of which she throws bullets around.
        -   Some of this can be explained by Renan technology, that allows Summon to Hand. Why there is a need to ever reload, with technology like this, is a mystery.
-   Justified in **Trails Series**. Most guns in the setting work on orbal energy, the same force that powers battle orbments. They take their ammo **literally** from the air, by gathering dispersed orbal energy. As a trade-off, guns are far less deadly than they should be.
    -   Played straight for actual gunpowder guns, even though there's not many of them. Tita never runs out of bullets, no matter how much she fires her Gatling gun, that this little girl apparently lugs around.
-   **Templar Battleforce** plays this straight; every Templar has both infinite ammunition and no need to reload without even an attempt at an explanation as to where the ammunition is coming from.
    -   This is particularly glaring given how difficult other supplies like med pacs are to get.
-   **Tomb Raider** is another classic example. In almost all of the games, Lara's basic pistols have infinite ammo and never have to reload. Her other guns, while having limited ammo, never needs a fresh magazine. The harpoon gun, grenade launcher, rocket launcher, and crossbow all need to be reloaded. And all gunmen enemies Lara faces also have infinite ammo.
    -   In **Legend**, the infinite-ammo pistols have a set magazine size, but the slow-mo flip attack overrides this, allowing her to fire non-stop until she lands.
    -   You can earn rewards to increase the magazine size based on how many of the game's secrets you find.
-   **Unkilled** invokes this trope with the "Infinite Ammo" booster, allowing you to shoot continuously without having to reload for as long as it has remaining uses.
-   In **Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War**, every weapon can and will be fired continuously for as long as required without ever depleting its ammunition. This is slightly more reasonable for Imperial Guard laser weaponry or Necron gauss weaponry, less so for the others. In **Dawn of War 2** nearly every unit performs a brief reload animation after every dozen-or-so shots, averting one part of this trope, but that simply raises the question of where they get all those magazines.
    -   Perfectly justified for the Orkz, whose gear runs entirely on Clap Your Hands If You Believe.
-   Hunters in **World of Warcraft** needed ammo in the earlier days for their ranged weapons; having a quiver (for arrows) or pouch (for guns) increased reload speed, in **Burning Crusade** Ranged Players were finally granted "Thori'dal, The Stars Fury", a Legendary Bow dropped from Kil'Jaeden in the Sunwell Plateau Raid that didn't require ammunition in order to fire as it instead created arrows made out of Magic. The "Cataclysm" expansion changed ranged weapons to no longer need ammo, though if you had a quiver or pouch on your person (they've turned into normal bags) beforehand, it will still display. The "Mists of Pandara" expansion goes one step further and strips out the differences between ranged and melee weapons.
-   Unlike other Wargaming titles, the ships in **World of Warships** have unlimited ammunition in their magazines. According to the developers, this is because ships hold so much ammo that they actually could not expend it all over the course of a match so they didn't bother. Remember real naval battles take place over hours of not days rather that minutes.
-   Played straight with any pistol in the **XCOM** remake. Rifles and shotguns do need to reload... but have unlimited reloads. And not, this isn't just with energy weapons but with regular ballistic guns as well. The only weapons that run out of ammo are bazookas and fusion ball launchers.
-   **X-Men: The Ravages of Apocalypse** adds reload or recovery time to weapons to prevent them from firing constantly. However, there's a rapid-fire powerup that removes this and allows you to fire weapons as if there's a bottomless feed.
-   **Yakuza**: Downplayed. Kiryu is given a gun to fend off attackers from a car, which hold 15 bullets per reload. Completely reasonable... if the gun was a modern semi-automatic, but the gun is repeatedly shown to be a snub-nosed six-shot revolver.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Web Animation

-   Played straight in the **Lackadaisy** animated short when The Highwayman Serafine, a gleeful Blood Knight member of the villainous Marigold Gang, wields a custom sawed-off M1918 BAR and fires it full-auto near constantly without running dry. While its possible she reloads during pauses in the Car Chase Shootout she's in, it's never shown. The BAR has a pitiful 20-round magazine, and Serafine's seems to lack evidence of an extended one. Freckle, the gunsel of the more heroic Neighborhood-Friendly Gangsters of Lackadaisy, is comparatively forced to abide by the laws of physics when his Tommygun and pocket pistol exhaust themselves in course of the same shootout.
-   Parodied in **Halo**\-based machinima **Red vs. Blue**. Played straight with the Warthog turret, but that's ripped straight from (and parodies) the actual Halo game mechanics.
-   Also parodied in **There's Something About Halo 2**. MC's firing his pistol at the Covenant, who respond: "Does he not need to stop, and reload?" "He must have a really big clip or something..." Cue MC running out of bullets, and a magazine several metres long dropping out.
-   **RWBY**: Countless characters have weapons that also double as guns, many of which also have gatling-like firing rates. There are occasions when Ruby and Weiss have been shown switching their weapon ammo from one Dust type to another, and one or two occasions where Yang has been shown reloading her ammo in a dramatic way to indicate she's about to get serious. However, for the most part, Huntsmen are almost never shown running out of ammo or needing to reload, even in those weapons that seem to hold very few rounds, such as Blake, Ren and Nora's. Many characters also have designs that look like they can't carry any spare ammo, or have tiny ammo pounches that can't carry much. So, even on the rare few occasions where a reload happens, it's not clear how on earth the character is able to carry spare ammo in the first place; for example, Ruby's cartridges are massive square cases that are bigger than the tiny pouch she wears at her waist, which might be able to carry a single cartridge at very best.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Webcomics

-   Guns in the **Adventurers!!** webcomic don't have to be reloaded and never run out of ammo, because **Adventurers!** takes place in a Console RPG.
-   Justified in the Index Arc in **Another Gaming Comic**, where infinite ammunition can be produced by a "copy/paste bug", letting Dang's character, the John Woo-inspired gunslinger Prism, never have to reload.
    -   Incidentally, this is actually a fairly substantial Game-Breaker, since Prism has a **lot** of special bonuses that only apply when using his own guns.
-   **Homestuck** has Caliborn blazing away at Gamzee with a machine gun for an indeterminate but lengthy amount of time, accompanied by calming elevator music. He then makes sure to Double Tap, still without reloading.
-   Amical from **morphE** has a bottomless **flintlock pistol** of all things. It is magically enchanted to never need to be reloaded, filled with gunpowder and worst of all can fire a volley of five shots in under a second.
-   Spoofed in this strip of **Strange Candy**.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Web Original

-   In the **12 oz. Mouse** third season webisode, mouse is in a gun fight that dramatically freezes long enough for him to think "I'll tell you what's cool right now, and that is a gun that never runs out of ammo."
-   Repeatedly throughout **Code Ment**, although the most triumphant example would have to be Episode 8. One spends about a minute and a half firing about 70 shots from a pistol. The guards right outside the room(who ignore the sounds of SUSTAINED GUNFIRE but bust through the door when they hear a cough) take two more bullets. Only THEN does the pistol inexplicably run out of bullets.
-   In **Curveball**, whenever Agent Grant puts ammo in his gun, all his clones gain access to it. Thus, he's able to blaze away non-stop, so long as another clone is in a safe location swapping magazines.
-   In **The Daisy Saga**, Daisy's primary weapon is her "Magic AK-47 that Never Runs out of Ammo".
-   Repeatedly parodied in **Italian Spiderman**, starting with a fifteen-round barrage from a six-shooter.
-   In **Survival of the Fittest**, a particularly blatant example occurred with Madison Conner, who had taken an MP5 with only one magazine of ammo. She was specified to have "emptied the clip" (or other variations) at least three times with no mention of reloading whatsoever. This was semi-prevalent in all versions of the game (at least in terms of reloading but never actually running out of bullets) until v4, where each firearm assigned has a specific ammo count.
-   Parodied in CalebCity's Guns in movie scenes. Two robbers attempt to escape only to get ambushed by a single officer with a handgun. The robbers discuss that the average handgun bag holds fifteen rounds and that they can strike back while he reloads, but the cop proceeds to keep shooting at the two with no reload. The two robbers eventually give up and surrender the money after **four hours of continuous shooting.**

Bottomless Magazines Example in Western Animation

-   **Family Guy**
    -   In one episode, Peter fires a double barreled shotgun five times. After loading it with four rounds.
    -   In the Stephen King episode, Stewie fires another double barreled shotgun three times.
    -   In a Cutaway Gag from much earlier in the series, Peter fired yet another double-barreled shotgun **at least** six times.
    -   When Brian and Stewie are recruited into the Army in another episode, they try to get out by shooting each other in the foot. They end up firing at least 17 bullets from a pistol that should at most hold 16.
    -   And then there's the cutaway where Dick Cheney shoots Peter with God-knows-how-many bullets. Then casually claims afterwards, "I thought you were a deer".
-   **Jonny Quest** TOS episodes:
    -   "The Sea Haunt". The captain of the Dutch ship fires off 12 shots from a six-shot revolver without reloading, and a pair of Very pistols (single shot Flare Guns) are fired off 12 times without reloading.
    -   "Treasure of the Temple". After Perkins enters the cave with the stalagtites, he fires 9 shots from a 6 shot revolver without reloading.
    -   "Turu The Terrible": The boat captain fires 9+ shots from a 6 shot revolver. Dr. Quest loads Race Bannon's bazooka seven times, even though they are clearly not carrying any rockets.
    -   In "Monster in the Monastery" one of the villains dressed as a yeti fires at least 70 shots at Jonny and Hadji from an automatic pistol without reloading.
-   In all old Looney Tunes cartoons, people like Elmer Fudd clearly use double barreled shotguns, but always cock them between shots.
-   Lampshaded in **The Secret Saturdays**. When faced with a robot that can fire tiny bombs from its Arm Cannon, Drew complains about its seemingly limitless supply after it's been firing at them continuously for a few minutes.
-   On one episode of **The Simpsons**, Moe Szyslak somehow manages to get three shots out of a double-barreled shotgun.
-   In **The Legend of Vox Machina**, Percy uses a six-barreled pepperbox revolver which normally averts this trope, but in the first-season finale, he fires it so many times in a row that other characters actually make note of it. Justified because the pepperbox is actually an Evil Weapon channeling a demon, and it has chosen that moment to drop its disguise.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Anime & Manga

-   The eponymous **Death Note** has an unlimited supply of pages with which the user can write the names of the people they want to kill.
-   Ryōga Hibiki from **Ranma ½** uses bandanas as projectiles that he never seems to run out of.
-   Rowan of Strata from **Ronin Warriors**. His armor magically generates an infinite supply of arrows.
-   Not quite guns, but just as important: Duelists in **Yu-Gi-Oh!** never seem to run out of **cards**. A duel deck typically consists of 40 cards; during a duel, the players will draw 10, 20, or even 30 cards from their deck to place them in their hand — and yet, the deck **never grows smaller** (unless the plot requires it).
    
    **Kaiba:** Now we must both chose three cards to form a new deck, and the rest of our deck goes to the graveyard.  
    **Yugi:** Our whole deck?!  
    Yugi has already used 31 cards at this point (what whole deck?), but that doesn't stop him from pulling out an all-but-complete deck to chose from. Handy. (And no, they didn't reuse the graveyards.)
    
    -   There was one duel where Yugi/Atem exploited the special effect of Osiris and a regenerating slime monster of the opponent's deck to make him continuously draw until he had no cards left, in which case, his opponent loses.
    -   Another duel has Yugi's opponent use an absurdly overpowered card that also requires Yugi to discard half of his deck every turn. When Yugi only has one card left in the deck, the card fails and Yugi pulls out the win on the last possible turn.
    -   Another exception was in **Yu-Gi-Oh! GX**, where Judai's opponent was the pro duelist X, who used a Mill Deck. Judai managed to beat him by also using a mill trick very similar to what Yugi did against Strings. Both Judai and X's decks were visibly being depleted, and the duel keeps up a running tally on both sides.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Fan Works

-   Played completely straight by Heroic weapons in **Heroes of the Desk** (Raynor's rifle, Valla's crossbows, etc.). The Heroes notice this and exploit it.
-   The Automatic Crossbow that Glintlock receives in **Manehattan's Lone Guardian** is enchanted to have its already souped up ammunition return to its magazine a short time after use, letting him fire as much as he wants without reloading.
-   In **Origins**, this is averted, then played straight for the Badass Crews working for Aria. Initially, the heatsink system from **Mass Effect 2** is used, but it's lampshaded that they cannot expect Blatant Item Placement, therefore it would be wise to switch back to the unlimited-ammo cooldown-based weapons previously seen in **Mass Effect**. One Hand Wave later (an engineer did it), the squad is back to cooldowns instead of sinks.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Films — Animation

-   **Toy Story 2**: Evil Emperor Zurg's ion blaster sure has a big supply of those foam balls.
-   No guns or ammunition, but **Wallace & Gromit** fulfills this trope to a T in **The Wrong Trousers**'s Chase Scene: Gromit pursues Feathers McGraw by rapid-fire laying of model train tracks from a box that never runs out. There's no justification other than Rule of Funny.
    -   Best of all, they're exactly the right shape — when Gromit is about to hit something on the floor, curved pieces come out to take his path around the obstacle and then back to his original course.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Literature

-   Susan in **The Chronicles of Narnia** has a Bottomless Quiver, but it's a magical one.
-   One of the forms the Swiss-Army Weapon called a memory sword can take in **The Dark Side of the Sun** is a projectile weapon that creates ice-bullets out of the water vapour in the air.
-   **Dungeon Crawler Carl**: Hekla's magical crossbow contains just one standard bolt, but can fire copies of it an unlimited number of times — which is good, because the crossbow's other ability is to fire faster and faster as more women join the party, until it's practically a machine gun. It can load other bolts if special enchantments are needed, but they're not unlimited. Katia later acquires another bolt, with magically enhanced damage, that can work in the crossbow unlimited times.
-   **A Piece in the Game of Gods**: Cassandra's arrows, as described:
    
    With that, Cassandra pulled back her bow and an arrow just appeared in her hand, already notched and ready to fire. I’d seen that kind of thing in video games, where the inconvenience of having to carry a ton of arrows was often ignored, but not in real life.  
    \[...\]  
    Cassandra stood up and moved away from the table, then in a burst of sparks, she was suddenly dressed in her armor. Her wicked looking bow was now clutched firmly in hand, though she didn’t seem to have any arrows on her at all. Of course, when you had the ability to actually summon your own arrows, there was no real reason to carry a quiver.
    
-   **Princesses of the Pizza Parlor**: Gwen's quiver that Helen chose for her character, as said in Book 1 when discussing heirloom items:
    
    "I picked a magic arrow-holdering thing," Helen added.  
    "A quiver."  
    "Yeah, that was it. Thanks, Uncle. It never runs out of arrows."  
    Uncle had been more than happy to let her have that one, too. There were enough things to pay attention to that he didn't want to add keeping track of arrows in a big fight.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Live-Action TV

-   **Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers**: Kimberly's Power Bow has an endless supply of arrows. (She doesn't even carry a quiver.) Said arrows can explode and chase after monsters like guided missiles. The Dragonzord seems to have an infinite amount of missiles.
-   In **Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide** episode called Mondays, a monkey gets his paws on Ned's small cup of Matzo balls and throws a way beyond the actual amount he had for a number of weeks.
-   In **Smallville**, Green Arrow naturally never runs out of arrows. In "Siren", he is clearly shown to only have 4 arrows in his quiver. But then, in the same scene he manages to take one arrow and then shoot three, so it is not like they cared about consistency.
-   **Star Trek: Voyager** starts off trying to avert this (by explicitly stating that they have 38 photon torpedoes and no way to replenish them)... but then proceeds to play it extremely straight by using approximately three times this number over the course of the series — sometimes in barrages of five at a time.
    -   To be perfectly honest, they only said they couldn't REPLACE the torpedoes. This could easily be interpreted via rules-lawyer interpretation to mean that they couldn't restock from officially sourced torpedoes. They could of easily replaced them with either alien substitutes or they simply could of replicated the constituent parts to build new ones. Nothing in the technical information suggests that a antimatter/matter warhead couldn't be replicated, and then fuelled from the ship's own dilithium and antimatter supplies. Plus, they don't even need the impossible-to-replicate dilithium stabiliser crystal, as they intentionally create a unconfined antimatter explosion to use as a weapon in the first place!!!

Bottomless Magazines Example in Roleplay

-   Unless it's specifically included as a gameplay limitation or gimmick, any weaponry used in **Destroy the Godmodder** will never, ever, have to reload.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Tabletop Games

-   **Dungeons & Dragons**:
    -   An actual bottomless quiver called the Endless Quiver is available in **Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition**.
    -   And 3.5. They called it the **Quiver of Plenty** back then.
    -   In the "far too many shots for the object" vein, there's the **Quickloading crossbow** (+1 enchantment). It will store 100 bolts and effectively give you the Rapid Shot feat.
    -   **Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition** has a Ranger spell, "Swift Quiver," that lets the caster's quiver or ammo pouch produce infinite ammo for a minute — with an additional perk of giving the caster two additional ranged attacks as a bonus action; at the level you'd get this spell, this could translate to four attacks a round.
    -   Fifth Edition Artificers have the Repeating Shot infusion, which is applied to a weapon that uses ammunition, like a bow, crossbow, or pistol (if guns are allowed). It causes the weapon to magically generate appropriate ammo every time it's readied.
-   In **Mindjammer** weapons with the Regenerating Ammunition aspect contain a small Makepoint (or just a zip reactor for energy weapons) that replenishes ammo as it's fired.

---
Bottomless Magazines Example in Video Games

-   Many roleplaying games in a fantasy setting will let your ranged weapon users do this. Marle of **Chrono Trigger** will never run out of bolts, Yuffie of **Final Fantasy VII** can chuck as many shuriken as she wants, and so on.
-   **Secret of Mana** — though whoever uses the bow only shoots an arrow about **four feet** away, so they may be just picking up the arrow and shooting it again.
-   **Final Fantasy**:
    -   Series-wide, nearly every game features this in one way or another with primary weapons, whether it be with arrows, bullets, even playing cards. However, some games have a "Throw" command where a character throws an item (such as ninja stars, a sword, or money) - it tends to do high damage, but whatever you threw is lost forever.
    -   **Final Fantasy IV** features bows that use limited amounts of arrows (which you tend to get in lots of ten.) That said, the DS remake does away with this: Arrows in this version are only consumed when switching weapons.
    -   Ranged weapons in **Final Fantasy XII** have bottomless magazines, but you have to have the right kind of ammo (arrows, crossbow bolts, ammo, and bombs) equipped in order to attack with said weapon.
    -   **Final Fantasy XIV** originally had arrows as a resource that had to be purchased to use the Archer and Bard's bows, but a later patch removed this for balancing purposes. With the addition of actual firearms with the Machinist class in the **Heavensward** expansion, this got even more ridiculous, in that until a major rebalance with the third expansion, guns explicitly had an ammo limit of three bullets and two separate reloading skills (one to pop in all three bullets at once and one with a quicker cool-down to quickly add one shot) — but not only could you reload as often as you needed to without ever needing to buy more ammo, but in fact the guns continued to function just fine **without** ammo loaded. The only reason to reload was that the bullets hit harder, let you fire faster, and triggered bonus effects more often when you do. Even the old "Throw" command gets in on the action now, as several tank and melee-focused DPS classes get a skill to toss their weapon (or something else, like Gladiator/Paladin's shield), with the weapon immediately returning to their hands after it hits the target; only maybe one of them gets a justification of you simply tossing a magical projection of your weapon rather than your actual weapon.
-   In the **Age of Empires** series, projectile weapon users (archers, siege weapons, Hand Cannon wielders and unique units who throw a weapon) have unlimited projectiles; you're never charged additional resources or even time to obtain new ones.
-   In **Battlezone II**, infantry and vehicle weapons have infinite regenerating ammo — be it missiles, plasma projectors or cannons — though it's typically too slow to be reasonably useful once the magazine is depleted. However, large "siege" vehicles, like the Attila LM walker can often regenerate their ammo **faster than it can be shot**, especially with small weapons like miniguns or AT-Stabbers. Standing on a Service Bay or having enough Service Trucks servicing you can give you bottomless magazines on **any** weapon.
-   **Baldur's Gate II**:
    -   The base game has two bows that have a built-in bottomless supply of arrows - the Tansheron's Bow and the Bow of Gesen (and at least one sling). They can still be loaded with magical varieties of arrows with limited uses, though.
    -   **The Throne of Bhaal** expansion also adds Infinite Quivers and Arrows, which can make any bow or sling into this. As well as the Firetooth Crossbow which has infinite bolts.
-   Every single incarnation of **Bangai-O** never runs out of missiles to fire, even while using EX Attacks.
-   In the last level of the **Bible Adventures** NES game "David & Goliath", where you actually go after Goliath instead of herding sheep, you have infinite stones to throw. A far cry from the **five** in the source text, but then, **he** wasn't climbing a mountain with soldiers coming out of caves to stop him, and **you** don't have a divine guidance system in the game.
-   In **Bloodline Champions**, the bloodlines never run out of ammo. There may be Cooldowns and energy requirements, but ammo isn't an issue.
-   **Bully** gives you infinite ammo for your slingshot and the secret Rubberband Ball. All other weapons have some ammo component to them.
-   **The Curse of Monkey Island** introduces "self-reloading cannons", which fire every time you pull the cord. These reappear in **Tales of Monkey Island**.
-   **Cyber Chaser**: The default weapon you've equipped has infinite ammo. It's the other weapons you can pick up that are limited, but they can be bought and equipped later.
-   **Devil May Cry** also has Nero's **sword** (yes, sword). His sword can be "injected with a special fuel" to briefly power it up. This fuel never runs out and never needs to be refilled. Back to his gun, given that he can power-up his shots in exactly the same manner Dante can, maybe he really is capable of generating ammo. Then again, maybe it's best not to think too much about it.
-   In **Diablo II**, quivers hold an utterly ridiculous but finite number of arrows (350 arrows in the same amount of inventory space as a short sword). The Amazon skill Magic Arrow creates arrows out of Mana and completely removes the need for a quiver. One unique bow, aptly named Endlesshail, has the property that it fires Magic Arrows as its default attack and does not cost any mana.
-   **Diablo III** plays it straight: quivers are utterly unnecessary for bows and crossbows, and indeed are not even usable except by Demon Hunters, for whom they function more like Stat Sticks. Demon Hunters can even wield a crossbow in each hand and fire them continuously without difficulty.
-   In the original **Donkey Kong**, Kong throws barrels at Mario that he gets from a stack he's standing at, and could throw them all day if not for the fact that this was a Timed Mission.
-   **Dragon Age** gives you unlimited non-enchanted arrows and crossbow bolts, but limits your magical damage-bonus ammunition.
    
    -   In **Dragon Age II**, Bianca, Varric's Automatic Crossbow can fire off hundreds of arrows without ever needing to be reloaded. Interestingly, in cutscenes, on two separate occasions, Varric is shown retrieving a single arrow, even after he's already fired off enough to equip a small army.
    -   In **Inquisition**, this gets lampshaded.
    
    **Dorian:** Where do you get all your arrows, Sera? You have... hundreds.  
    **Sera:** From your arse, that's where.  
    **Dorian:** My arse should open up a shop. It's apparently quite prolific.
    
-   Played straight nowadays for any **Dynasty Warriors** character who uses ranged weapons as part of their move set, although in earlier games arrows were only used in first-person mode **and** finite; you started stages with 20 and could find more (in quantities of 20) as item pickups.
-   All NPC's in **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim** have unlimited arrows. While this is mainly because The Computer Is a Cheating Bastard on their part, this also applies to some of your followers, which means you can give them just 1 of your best arrows and they can use it repeatedly like nobody's business. Also, you can replace the arrows used by guards practicing on dummies and they have unlimited arrow of that type, which you can then pluck off the dummy/target they fire at.
-   **Elemental Gearbolt** is a Light Gun Game whose setting fantasy setting lets it eschew ammo and reloading. The player character's BFGs are magitek; they shoot magic instead of bullets and they are their own power source, so they're always ready to fire.
-   In the **Fable** games, equipping a bow automatically causes a bottomless quiver of arrows to appear on the character's back.
-   **Fairyside**: With a MP Regen stat of 3, Shirley can fire her magical shots forever at the starting Cast Speed of 2.
-   **Gauntlet**, in all its incarnations, succumbs to this.
-   In **Ghost 1.0**, Ghost’s futuristic weapons have finite ammo that regenerates constantly, with some guns regenerating more slowly or quickly than others. If she runs out of bullets for one gun, she can just switch to another while the empty gun replenishes itself.
-   **God of War (PS4)**: Atreus can only fire four arrows in a short period of time, but his quiver will quickly regenerate arrows, so the limitation is about rate of fire rather than quantity. On his character model, his quiver looks like it contains about six arrows.
-   **Iji**: Enemies have infinite ammo for their Nanoweapons, and Iji does not except for her Shotgun and Resonance Detonator. There are also no clips, with the automatic weapons never needing to reload except for a slight weapon-swap cooldown.
-   **The Jungle Book**, the regular banana projectiles are the one weapon Mowgli never runs out of. Naturally, it’s also the weakest weapon. Averted with the other, stronger, weapons.
-   **LEGO Indiana Jones**: Not only are the ranged weapons capable of firing limitless shots, but Marion Ravenwood carries a ridiculous number of bottles to throw.
-   Lampshaded in **The Lost Vikings** when Baleog mentions that he carries "a lifetime supply of arrows" with him.
-   In **Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom**, Tepeu is never going to run out of stones. It doesn’t matter whether you're out in the desert or inside a castle.
-   **Mass Effect**: Justified.
    -   The first game's codex explains that ammunition clips consist of a solid block of metal which the gun shaves sand-grain-sized pieces off of and uses mass effect fields to fire them at relativistic speeds. Ammunition is technically still limited, by since each clip makes thousands of bullets you'll functionally never be reloading in a firefight. Wrex actually tells a story about how he once fought an opposing bounty hunter for so long, they both actually did run out of ammo and had to scrounge up guns from other hunters Wrex had killed during the gunfight.
    -   The games do still keep mechanics that serves a similar purpose to limited ammo magazines forcing you to reload. In the first game guns have built in heatsinks which overheat, meaning that you'll have to take breaks from firing to let your weapon cool down. To varied opinions among the fanbase, the sequel adds reloading back to the game by way of "thermal clips". Each one is essentially a mini-heat sink that is swapped out when overheated, with the justification that this actually allows soldiers to fire faster than if they were waiting for their weapons to cool back down. The massive logistical strain of now having to supply troop with thermal clips, or what soldiers do when they run out, is not addressed, although the fact that they're universal is said to aid with logistics.
    -   The computer-controlled NPCs never run out because The Computer Is a Cheating Bastard, but in-universe it seems that Shepard is the only one who smart enough or capable of carrying as many as they need; they only steals them from dead bodies.
    -   The **Citadel DLC** has Shepard find an old M7 Lancer from around the time of the First Contact War, which still relies on the old cooling system. After running out of shots, Shepard goes to reload, only to realize it doesn't use thermal clips and nearly burns themselves as a result. It's also discussed that adding the system of quick-replacable thermal clips to weapons in **2** and **3** required removal of their prior cooling systems, which leads to one character complaining that the system is a step backwards.
    -   **Mass Effect: Andromeda** brings an Item Crafting system that allows you to manufacture weapons introduced in **2** or **3** with a "Vintage Heat Sink", returning them to the original bottomless magazines. This can turn some of the higher-powered weapons into unstoppable murder machines with an infinite ammo pool limited by a cooldown. Remnant weapons also run off bottomless magazines with a cooldown, as they fire beams, not bullets.
-   The **Metroid** series uses this, but explains it with Samus's suit having the ability to convert almost anything into ammunition and health.
-   **Midnight Resistance** has the default gun with an unlimited ammo. The powerful and expensive BFG's are an exception.
-   Ranged weaponry in the **Might and Magic** series (the original series, not Heroes — for that, look under Exceptions) never run out of ammunition. This may be justified for blasters<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> (there's dialogue in **VI** that indicates they may well have a limit when it needs to be recharged... but it's so extremely high that you'd have to be adventuring with them for **years** to actually run out). Bows and crossbows, not so much.
-   In **Minecraft**, the aptly-named "Infinity" enchantment for the bow causes it to consume no arrows when fired although, oddly, you still need at least one arrow in inventory to shoot. Apparently it teleports the arrow back to you, or something. You still can't use it endlessly, though—like all tools, an Infinity bow wears out and eventually breaks (it can be repaired, but this uses up materials and "enchantment levels"), and special status-effect arrows still get used up.
-   In the **Monster Hunter** games, the Bow weapon has unlimited arrows. Coatings to put on the arrows are finite, but the arrows themselves never run out. Also, the bowguns have unlimited ammunition of the most basic type. All other types are limited.
-   **Mortal Kombat 11**: Good lord Cassie Cage. One youtuber even commented on whether she was using the same magazine in the black dragon hideout from Shinnok's temple.
-   In **Mystic Towers**, the trope is played straight with the weaker Ice spell, but averted with all other attack spells.
-   Certain magic bows in **Neverwinter Nights** and **Neverwinter Nights 2** have the Unlimited Ammunition property, which generates a new arrow every time you fire. And high-level characters can get off four (in **Neverwinter Nights**) or six (in **Neverwinter Nights 2**) shots every six seconds. Say hello to the magic machine gun crossbows! Though the magic enhancements that can be applied to the unlimited arrows/bolts are limited, so you can't give them on hit fireball bolts without messing about with the scripting.
-   The remake of **Ninja Gaiden** has Ryu with unlimited normal shuriken created through "ninja magic", but limited stocks of the incendiary kind. His stock of arrows, whether standard, armour-piercing or explosive, was also finite. The enemy forces never ran out of projectiles, though, and not just the explicitly demonic enemies.
-   **Ninja: Shadow of Darkness**: You will never run out of throwing knives. Ever.
-   **Pathfinder: Kingmaker** and **Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous**: Bows and crossbows have infinite normal ammunition, but you can find quivers of special arrows that are consumable items.
-   There are a few areas mandatory to complete **The Persistence** where you'll get a weapon with unlimited ammo. On Deck 2, you'll get a Valkyrie gun with unlimited needles and on Deck 3, you'll get a Gravihook you can use to throw enemies around forever. Both suddenly have finite ammo once you clear the story mission.
-   Lampshaded slightly in **Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney: Trials and Tribulations**, when Phoenix wonders if Victor Kudo is using an infinite ammo code for his never-ending supply of seeds that keep getting thrown at him.
-   Handwaved humorously in **Planescape: Torment**:
    -   The four-armed, dual crossbow-wielding modron (creature of pure Law) named Nordom never runs out of basic crossbow bolts (though he has only a limited supply of magical or otherwise special bolts). Explained in that Nordom's crossbows are a pair of "gear spirits", denizens of the same plane Nordom is from, whose whole reason for being is to take on the form of various tools and be helpful. This means that, as crossbows, they can use their powers to generate their own ammo.
    -   Ignus has endless mini-fireballs for throwing at enemies. Explained by the fact that he has a gate to the elemental plane of fire opened through him as part of a cruel and unusual punishment for arsony.
-   **The Punisher**. Frank Castle can keep launching knives as long as the "Slaughter Mode" is running. Even in the prison level, where all he has on is a jean and a simply white shirt. Averted slightly elsewhere as he can empty the ammo mags of dropped weapons... unless the ammo is incompatible with the weapons he is carrying.
-   **Ragnarok Online** had this with archers and hunters who could use an infinite number of arrows so long as they never actually shot them. Using the skill Double Strafe and Arrow Shower however would allow you to shoot a target without actually using an arrow. Players would carry 1 silver or fire arrow for ghost monsters and undead and other types of arrows as needed and a handful of normal arrows for standard shooting. Sadly due to bots exploiting this it was later removed. Some private servers still have the old system.
-   In **S.T.A.L.K.E.R.**, it's never made clear exactly where The Marked One gets all those bolts from.
-   The **Splatoon** series has this for all weaponry, not just guns, and while you don't have bottomless magazines per se, you do functionally have an infinite number of refills. Your weapons are fueled by ink, and you play as a humanoid squid or octopus, which are creatures that naturally produce ink: do the math. Your ammo will slowly refill on its own, but you'll find that fully submerging yourself in your own (or a teammate's) puddle of ink gets the job done much quicker. Though the magazines are not bottomless, they are very close to it, as you only require a small puddle to submerge yourself to refill your ink, but a fully refilled weapon can cover a much larger amount of ground in ink. This results in a match beginning with very little ink, then using that very little ink to cover a much bigger amount, and using that bigger amount to cover an even bigger amount, until much of the stage is covered in ink.
-   Laser weapons in **Star Wars Battlefront (2015)** will overheat if fired too much, but there's no limit on magazine capacity. Grenades and other secondary gear recharge over time rather than needing to be reloaded or using ammunition.
-   Supergiant Games likes to zigzag this trope.
    -   In **Bastion**, all weapons have infinite magazines, but two (the Fang Repeater and the Dueling Pistols) require The Kid to stop and reload them periodically in exchange for a faster average firing rate.
    -   **Hades** has the slow Heart-Seeking Bow, which doesn't need to reload, and the fast Adamant Rail, which does. But via Daedalus Hammer upgrades, you can make the Bow fire as fast as a machine gun and the Rail have infinite ammo (in exchange for a slower fire rate). Also, normally Zagreus's Cast ability relies on a fixed supply of Bloodstones, and once fired they need to be retrieved to use them again... unless you pick the Stygian Soul mirror upgrade, which gets rid of the retrieval mechanic and instead gives you a free Bloodstone every few seconds.
-   All over the place in **Tales Series**
    -   Chester from **Tales of Phantasia** fights exclusively with normal bow and arrows, never using any kind of magic weapon or even artes (before the remakes, anyway), but he still never runs out of arrows. At very least he has a quiver, unlike most archers in the series.
    -   All three archers from **Tales of Destiny** and its sequel produce arrows from thin air, and some artes has them shoot several of them at once.
    -   Raven from **Tales of Vesperia** never runs out of arrows. Heck, one can't even tell where the arrows come from in the first place…
-   In **TaskMaker** and **The Tomb of the TaskMaker**, all ranged weapons (bow and arrow, slingshot, blow gun, etc.) have infinite projectiles.
-   The Classy Cat-Burglar Zoya from **Trine** is equipped with a bow that follow this trope — she can fire as many arrows as she wants, with the drawback that she needs to ready her bow to get any range on them. However, she can also level up an ability that reduces her time needed to ready a shot, which combined with her Bottomless Quiver, makes her a Game-Breaker in combat.
-   **Two Worlds**: Quivers never run out of arrows.
-   **ULTRAKILL:** None of the weapons you wield need reloading or even ammunition, so you don't need to worry about managing any resource that isn't your own health while slaughtering the denizens of Heaven and Hell. The Lore in the terminals does take the time to explain this: The weapons are hyperadvanced and either use microscopic accelerated ammo like the Pistol, are energy weapons like the Railcannon and Shotgun, or just straight-up generate matter from nowhere (including the plentiful bloodshed) like the Rocket Launcher and Nailgun. As to the gameplay explanation, the devs stated they didn't want players to worry about conserving ammo when they should be busy styling all over their enemies.
-   **Unreal** and **Unreal II: The Awakening** both feature models of the dispersion pistol, a self recharging energy weapon. The first dispersion pistol become quite powerful after a few upgrades but still takes **seven and half minutes** to fully recharge. The second is more of a proper Emergency Weapon for when you've run out of ammo for everything else.
-   Played straight in the **Warcraft** RTS series. In **Warcraft III**, a Night Elf archer named Shandris does a Lampshade Hanging, if clicked repeatedly enough, by openly wondering why she never runs out of arrows.
-   **Warframe**:
    -   While most weapons use limited magazines, some weapons don't actually swap out their magazines when "reloaded". The Boltor rifle has a lever that recocked which somehow puts more nails in the gun, the Ogris rocket launcher has you punch two buttons on the back to load more rockets, etc.
    -   Arch-Guns (during Archwing missions) and certain other weapons run off a "Battery" mechanic, regenerating chambered ammo when the weapon isn't firing. The Kitguns have a unique Arcane which grants them this mechanic. The Nataruk Laser Bow simply has an infinity symbol for its ammo count.
    -   "Ammo Efficiency" determines how much ammo is consumed per trigger pull(s); while Arcane Pistoleer and certain Mods can add Efficiency, certain weapons have it built-in, usually triggering on a headshot. One of the first places players will experience this tends to be in Void Fissure missions, as the reactant buff for Primary and Secondary weapons is 100% Ammo Efficiency for the duration of the buff. One skill node in the "Madurai" Focus School can give this buff, and the Helminth has "Energized Munitions" as an ability that can be granted to any frame you choose.
-   **Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader**: Downplayed. Ranged weapons do have a limited ammunition capacity, but your Player Party carries an infinite number of reloads.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Webcomics

-   In **Saffron And Sage** when Saffron first faces off against the assassin Cinnamon, she quickly finds out that Cinnamon's bow has infinite arrows. This is Justified/Handwaved by the bow being magic and able to generate an unlimited number of arrows.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Western Animation

-   Mai from **Avatar: The Last Airbender**, whose robes are stocked with an endless hidden supply of metal arrows and shurikens that never run out, without impeding her movement at all. It's lampshaded in the Ember Island Players, where the "Mai" on stage draws a knife from her hair, throws it and **immediately has a replacement waiting in her hair.**
-   Batman's batarangs: he **never runs out**.
-   In **Here Comes the Grump**, the eponymous Grump has a Bottomless Quiver when he fires a bow in some episodes.
-   Green Arrow from **Justice League Unlimited** seems to have a bottomless supply of arrows.
-   **Samurai Jack**
    -   In the episode "Jack and the Blind Archers" has three superhuman archers that apparently never leave their tower that actually made it **rain arrows for nearly a minute**. (They don't even have quivers, so their bows are likely enchanted.)
    -   In the episode "Jack and the Super Robots", this is Zigzagged. One of the robots uses a flamethrower, another uses a machine gun, and another uses shuriken. But while a flashback scene in the beginning shows their weapons being loaded with ammunition and fuel, they never have to reload over the course of the story, destroying at least four cities before Jack even encounters them. (Indeed, they seem to have no home base, having destroyed the one they were built in.)
-   **Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur (2023)**: Lunella has way more boxing gloves than she should be able to carry. Lampshaded by Aftershock as she's pelted by them.
    
    **Aftershock:** How many gloves do you have?
    
    **Lunella:** It's gloves all the way down, baby!
    
-   In the **Steven Universe** episode "The Kindergarten Kid," while helping Peridot understand the perspective of a Gem monster, Steven pelts her with an incredible number of marshmallows and the bag still appears to be almost full.
-   Speedy on **Teen Titans (2003)**: How many arrows can he fit in that quiver? In the Season 3 finale, he's firing them off nonstop three at a time but always with plenty to spare for the next scene.

## Exceptions

Bottomless Magazines Example in Anime & Manga

-   The pilots of **Area 88** regularly run out of missiles and gun shells in longer engagements. A few get shot down because of this.
-   Played with in **The Big O**. Roger never seems to run out of ammo for his titular megadeus during a battle, but in his fight with Big Duo, he learns too late that Norman hadn't had time to restock his ammo after his last fight. As such, Roger's stuck with only his Sudden Impact. A later episode shows Norman using several local bums to help him care for the Big O, including reloading it's many guns.
-   Played with in **Black Lagoon**. When the scene is serious, Revy needs to reload realistically (no one else lives long enough to get the chance). When it's not, everyone can empty enough rounds to swiss cheese a car without reloading.
-   **Digimon Tamers**:
    -   The series averts this with Gargomon, who runs out of ammo twice. The first time, Henry uses a recharge card. The second time, Gargomon is defeated before he can reload.
    -   Happens again with Megagargomon, but he's so confident that it doesn't matter. To wit: "Who needs ammo when you're a whooping machine?
    -   Beelzebumon also runs out of ammo in one of his shotguns (he loses the other one) near the end of his battle against Dukemon.
-   **Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children**: Vincent Valentine's triple barrel "Cerberus" handgun runs out of ammo **very** quickly during the battle with Bahamut SIN, which gives him a chance to reload on **Bahamut's shoulder**.
-   In Episode 19 of **Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood**, we get an inversion of the trope. When Riza is emptying her guns into Lust, the last firearm she pulls is a six-shot revolver, but she only fires off 5 bullets before it starts clicking dry. Even stranger is that earlier in the episode, we got a clear look at the chamber, and she had 6 rounds loaded into it. She ran out of ammo too soon.
-   Zigzagged in **Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex**. Some episodes have characters frequently reloading, while others show characters firing weapons for far longer than they should be able to (even if the weapons used caseless ammunition).
-   **Grenadier**. A fairly accurate bullet count is kept since the highlight of every episode is when Rushuna Tendo reloads her revolver. Fresh bullets are ejected from her considerable cleavage, then scooped out of the air with the cylinder. In this case it's her cleavage that's bottomless. It's subverted once, when even her cleavage runs out of ammo and it's up to her companions to supply her with bullets. It's then lampshaded in the final fight scene when she and her rival have their bras cut, and a literal cascade of bullets spill out from each of them.
-   Generally averted in **Gunsmith Cats**, if only to remind the reader that author Keneichi Sonoda is a serious gun otaku.
-   Even though they're using magic bullets, no one in **Lyrical Nanoha** ever uses more bullets in a single battle than their gun can hold without reloading in between. During the longer battles they even keep track of how many spare magazines they have.
-   The **Macross** franchise tends to avoid this trope a lot, most evident in episode 2 of **Macross Frontier** where Alto very quickly runs out of ammo for the gunpod of the VF-25 he hijacked due to constant sustained fire without relaxing on the trigger. The one place it will always play this trope completely straight is with missiles. Nobody in the history of the series has ever run out of missiles, despite firing them in salvos consisting of dozens at a time.
-   The title mech of **Mazinkaiser SKL** tends to have an amazing amount of ammo for its chest-mounted pistols, but it **does** run out. However, its pilot (in that mode, as it’s a two-seater) is skilled enough to keep attacking and reload at the same time.
-   In **Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn**, Banagher has to keep a close eye on his Beam Magnum as, unlike other beam weapons, he only has five shots per magazine as the magazine is five **normal beam rifle magazines hooked together** and each shot drains the entire thing.
-   Also generally averted in **Noir**. Kirika and Mireille are often seen reloading during gunfights with mooks, though sometimes the reloading is presumed to happen off-screen (e.g., Mireille fires off a dozen rounds from her gun's 15-round magazine, the action cuts away to show Kirika fighting, then we cut back to Mireille firing another dozen rounds or so). Where they keep their spare magazines is never shown, though.
-   **One Piece**'s first Non-Serial Movie, in which the villain's henchmen carry an enormous box of flintlock pistols (which can only fire one shot each) for this reason.
-   In Volume 1 of the **Read or Die** manga, Yomiko whirls to face a henchman, only to find that she's out of paper — but he's out of bullets, too, and they both take a moment to reload before continuing.
-   In the **Rurouni Kenshin** manga, Takeda Kanryu, the opium and weapons dealer, is defeated when his Gatling gun runs out of ammo. In the anime, however, the gun becomes jammed when Aoshi's underling lodges a thrown projectile on the bullet belt.
-   In one episode of **Saiyuki Reload Gunlock**, Goku, Gojyo, and Hakkai attempt to keep track of how many shots Gato has fired, knowing that two six shooters means twelve shots (and twelve shots means they each get four, and everybody has to take their fair share), and try to attack him while he's reloading. The Gunslinger Sanzo sometimes follows the trope and sometimes averts it, but it's worth noting that he never has to **buy** ammo. Cigarettes, yes; ammo, no.
-   **Trigun**:
    -   Averted, as we often see Vash reloading with speedloaders (a cylinder's worth of ammunition held ready for loading like a magazine). How he never seems to run out of these is another question, just like the "finite rounds in infinite magazines."
    -   In the manga we see where he keeps them: they're in those tubes on his coat. Plus we see him buy bullets.
    -   The first scene of the anime itself involves Vash nonchalantly surviving an incredible tavern-demolishing volley of gunfire; frequent cuts to the mooks delivering said volley show that they do stop to reload. He then pulls his gun to return fire... then cut to him running away because his gun was empty.
    -   Another exception is the standoff with Knives at the end of the series, where both of them have only one bullet each and are playing Russian Roulette with the other person's gun in their **eye**.
    -   The Movie "Badlands Rumble" has Vash counting the bullets of a group of bounty hunters during the opening Blast Out.
-   **Undead Unluck** averts the trope as ammo follows real-conventions and do need to reload, with one exception being Creed because as Undecrease, he is able to negates an exhaustable item's ability to be exhausted, allowing him to infinitely replicate bullets, grenades, and the like as long as he keeps firing. Andy even notices the fact Creed is able to fire his mini-gun without reloading as likely a Negator ability.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Comic Books

-   Subverted in **100 Bullets**. Most of the plots revolve around a protagonist who is given a finite supply of untraceable bullets. Guess how many.
-   Subverted in **Batman: The Dark Knight Returns**, during one of the first real fights a recently-returned Batman has against some would-be bank robbers. One in particular starts to reload his pistol when it runs empty after firing on Batman, but before he can replace the magazine, Batman catches him by surprise from below. The thug aims at Batman and pulls the trigger on reflex, but nothing happens but an empty click before Batman pulls him down with him to take him out of the fight.
-   Averted a couple of times during the original **ElfQuest** series, where Strongbow does run out of arrows, and during the final battle with the Trolls is forced to use the large sword, which he doesn't do at all well with.
-   **The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck** actually averts this — when using two six-shooters, Scrooge does fire exactly twelve shots and then spends one frame reloading.
-   Averted and played for laughs in a **Richie Rich** comic book story, where one of Richie's many uncles is a compulsive gambler. When a robber with a handgun threatens the bank Richie and his uncle are in, the uncle says "huh, ten to one it isn't even loaded" and, by offering new bets at higher odds each time, manages to make the robber use up all five shots. Justified because Richie's uncle had recognised the handgun model and knew how many shots it could hold.
-   A **Runaways** arc one dealt with time travel to the 1900's. One of the villains there had a particularly nasty pair of magic revolvers that hit its target every time. He ended up being killed when he wasted his shots on an undead hero who couldn't be killed so easily.
-   **Thor: The Mighty Avenger** has fun with this.
    
    **Chief:** He's getting away!  
    **Officer 1:** We're... We're out of ammo, chief.  
    **Chief:** Then **reload!**  
    **Officer 2:** No, he means we're **really** out of ammo. That was it. Small-town budget. We never thought we'd **need** it.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Fan Works

-   **Fantasy Of Utter Ridiculousness**: Continuing from above, the bottomless magazines granted by the Spell Card system don't seem to apply to most of Megas's non-missile-based weaponry, such as the beam-gatling guns used against Yuuka.<sup>*&nbsp;</sup> Those are more akin to bombs, and are thus in limited supply.
-   In **Fates of Ice and Fire**, Joffrey Baratheon is summoned as Archer. He is armed with a crossbow and three trebuchets that launch wildfire bombs. While he can create new arrows and bombs with magic, his weapons have to be manually reloaded.
-   **Heroes of the Desk** shows that even SPEAR's Magitek has limits, for instance the MR-7 "Merida" only holds five rounds per magazine. In the sequel **Heroes of the Desk: Repercussions** said rifle is upgraded to the MR-8 but still has a five-round limit. One Hero wielding such weapons finds out the hard way that non-Heroic weapons aren't affected by this trope.
-   In **Origins**, a **Mass Effect**/**Star Wars**/**Borderlands**/**Halo** Massive Multiplayer Crossover, this is averted specifically for Trans-Galactic Republic starships in a fashion—a component of the Applied Phlebotinum that enables turbolasers to fire is actually limited (though large amounts are carried). Thus, while it's not an issue initially (when the fleet thinks it is in for a short battle) it becomes a problem over time as the war stretches on for years. Characters are also shown to stop to reload on occasion, though this appears to be more Rule of Drama/Rule of Cool than anything attempting "realistic" portrayals of limited munitions.

-   Subtly averted in **Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door**; fighting Spike on a monorail, Vincent unloads a ridiculous number of bullets from his gun before dramatically reloading. Close inspection will reveal, however, that his pistol is an Infinity made by Strayer-Voight, and the magazine actually holds nineteen rounds in some calibers. That said, even closer inspection shows that the casings are marked ".45 ACP", the one caliber the gun in question comes in that **doesn't** hold that many.

-   Averted in **The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother**. If you count carefully, Moriarty shoots off exactly 6 rounds from his revolver while pursuing Sigerson. When he catches up:
    
    **Sigerson:** A Webley's #2, I think, carries only six cartridges.  
    **Moriarty:** **\[tries to fires the revolver at Sigerson\]** Click.  
    **Sigerson:** Yes, that's right.
    
-   **Aliens** carefully avoids this. Hicks instructs the Marines to use "short, controlled bursts" to avoid wasting ammo. Vasquez is eventually reduced to a sidearm when her rifle runs dry, and Ripley's ammo counter is constantly shown during the finale. In the extended version, the Marines watch the ammo counters on the sentry guns' laptops quickly count down as wave after wave of aliens attack the guns, listening to the guns firing in the distance before they run dry, fall silent, and is replaced by the sound of the aliens thumping open the pressure door behind where the guns were.
-   **The Avengers (2012)** averts it, if you pay close attention. Hawkeye runs out of arrows during the final fight (though he does seem to have an inordinately large stock of them), and he is forced to tear one out of a killed Chitauri in order to use his grappling-hook arrow head. Notably, by the time of **Avengers: Age of Ultron**, he's upgraded to an expanded quiver, presumably to counter this problem.
-   Averted with Rhodey's War Machine suit. **Avengers: Infinity War** gives a first hand perspective of how the suit actually change the minigun's magazine during the Battle of Wakanda.
-   **The Book of Eli** is one of the few After the End movies in which it is mentioned that bullets are hard to come by (even if this doesn't seem to be true). While the scarcity of ammunition is used to explain why raiders attack the main character, it seems to be a complete non-issue when the main character fires twenty some rounds with perfect accuracy from a ten-shot pistol. One scene involves shooting with automatic weapons until a house literally falls apart, though some guns are reloaded from cover in the same scene.
-   Spoofed delightfully in **Bottom Live 2**:
    
    **Eddie:** I know what you're thinking, Parrot. You're thinking how many shots did I fire back there in Act 2, Scene 1? And to tell you the truth in all the excitement of Rik forgetting his fucking lines, I've kind of forgotten myself. So, Parrot, do you feel lucky? Come on, make my day.  
    **Parrot:** You already fired six, you overweight bastard!  
    **Eddie:** That's right.  
    **(Shoots the parrot six times)**  
    **Eddie:** But I fucking reloaded!
    
-   Done oddly in **Captain America: The First Avenger**. The saboteur who assassinates Erskine runs out of ammunition after firing sixteen bullets from a gun with an eight round magazine. One could argue that he had two magazines, but if so, given what he was doing while firing shots eight and nine, he was able to rapidly reload a gun while driving a car without losing control of the vehicle.
-   Averted in all three of the endings to the **Clue** film when the characters question the remaining ammunition in the Revolver.
-   Avoided in **Collateral**: Vincent is shown reloading twice, and it actually becomes a plot point in the film's finale, putting the shot count from him at 36. In the Club Fever scene, he actually fires the exact capacity of his pistol with a loaded magazine.
-   While **Commando** suffers from this trope in some scenes, as mentioned above, the fight between Duke and Matrix nicely averts this with Duke firing six shots from his revolver before getting the drop on Matrix and pulling the trigger only to have a loud \*click\* result. The Fridge Logic of two special forces veterans both failing to track the number of rounds he fired is not however addressed.
-   Scrupulously and rigorously averted at the end of Italo-Spanish **Mystery Science Theater 3000**\-bait spy film **Danger!! Death Ray** as superspy Bart Fargo constantly changes magazines for his Schmeisser during the confrontation with the Big Bad and his Mooks. In fact, the film is so rigorous about this it slows the action down considerably, which is part of why it was MST3K fodder.
-   Averted in the bank robbery scene at the beginning of **The Dark Knight**, when the bank manager shoots Chuckles in the back with a shotgun and chases Grumpy and the Joker down the lobby.
    
    **Bank Manager:** Don't you have any idea who you're stealing from?! You and your friends are dead!  
    **Grumpy:** **\[to the Joker\]** He's out, right?  
    **\[The Joker hesitates for a moment, then nods. Grumpy stands up, at which point the bank manager fires his shotgun, hitting Grumpy in the shoulder, and spending his last round\]**  
    **Grumpy:** What—?! **\[The Joker breaks cover and guns down the manager\]** Where did you learn to count?!
    
-   In the highway fight at the beginning of **Deadpool**, Deadpool only has twelve bullets on him and he counts them off (each bullet also has its number engraved on the end of the case). One goon tries to catch him, but didn't check his ammo and fired on an empty chamber. Deadpool shoots a dead man twice, leaving him with One Bullet Left to deal with the last three mooks. Oddly enough, the pistols he uses are underloaded, carrying six rounds each in a Desert Eagle that holds seven. At least he wasn't surprised by this- he's clearly seen counting how many bullets he has in the cab, **before** the shootout.
-   After the bar shootout in **Desperado** both El Mariachi and the last Mook left try to shoot each other simultaneously, only to realize they're both out of ammo. It takes several tries for either of them to grab a gun that still has any rounds left.
-   **Dirty Harry**:
    
    -   Scorpio's sub-machine gun seems to spray a lot of lead with very few reloads. Given, a lot of SMGs tend to have fairly large ammo capacities and is shown to have several magazines in his suitcase. And avoided of course in the movie's most quotable scene.
    
    **Harry Callahan:** I know what you're thinking. "Did he fire six shots or only five?" Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement I kind of lost track myself.
    
    -   It's often averted. During gunfights the shooters are regularly seen changing out magazines, which also takes quite a bit of time. This is especially noted in **Magnum Force** where one of the antagonists is nervously firing rounds down the hallways. He is is then quickly dispatched with several jabs to the throat while attempting to reload.
    -   Avoided in **The Enforcer**. Kate Moore is rescuing the Mayor from kidnappers on Alcatraz, and in one scene, she reloads her service revolver.
-   In **Heat**, the characters are shown frequently reloading in the background of scenes.
-   Averted in **Iron Man**. Iron Man's power source, the arc reactor, will run out of power if the power drain from the suit outstrips the power output of the reactor for too long.
    -   Played straight with everyone else who fires kinetic weapons, though.
-   A major plot point in **I Stand Alone**. The Villain Protagonist's revolver only has three bullets. He plans out very carefully which of his enemies will receive each bullet.
-   **James Bond**
    -   Averted in the 1962 **Dr. No**. Bond (Sean Connery) hides behind the door as an assassin fires several shots into blanket-covered pillows on the bed. Bond disarms the assassin and the two converse, but Bond "carelessly" allows the assassin to retrieve his dropped pistol — which clicks on an empty chamber. Bond doesn't even flinch and says "That's a Smith and Wesson, and you've had your six." before killing the assassin.
    -   In **GoldenEye**, during the final battle the Big Bad clearly has to reload his pistol after eight or nine shots. Played straight earlier in the movie with Bond and the assault rifle, though they attempted to mask this by having him toss away his guns and grab new ones from bad guys rather than actually reload.
    -   Live and Let Die has Bond fire exactly 6 shots from a .44 before switching to hand-to-hand combat.
-   In **The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies**, Bard fires every arrow he has at Smaug until he completely runs out. In the climax, Legolas shoots down Orcs attacking Thorin...leaving him with none left when he sees Bolg about to kill Tauriel. The shocked and panicked expression as he desperately reaches into an empty quiver is priceless. Clearly he decided to never be in this situation again, and got a bottomless quiver for future movies.
-   **John Wick**:
    -   The filmmakers are so dedicated to averting the trope that action scenes are scripted and storyboarded with John's ammo count in mind, making sure he never fires more than what he's carrying, and forcing him to reload or grab another gun once he should be empty. They also make Ammunition Conservation a character trait; John, whenever possible, takes precise single shots (especially since he favors headshots over center mass, a smaller, difficult target), and only sprays blind fire as a last resort (as in the start of the catacombs firefight in **Chapter 2**, when he does not have cover and must flee from a wave of incoming shooters). Specific examples include:
    -   John frequently has to reload his guns in **John Wick**, and the number of bullets he shoots before he has to reload in usually accurate to the gun model in question. In one scene, he punches a mook in the neck with his gun, tries to deliver a headshot, grimaces, reloads, and shoots him in the space of three seconds.
    -   Becomes a plot point in the climactic battle of **John Wick: Chapter 2**, where John is given a .45 with precisely seven rounds. He fires all seven rounds in the first few seconds of the gunfight and is forced to scavenge weapons from downed enemies. Earlier in the film, he's shown repeatedly reloading when he has the opportunity, and he never fires more rounds than the weapon he has could hold.
    -   John uses up all the rounds in a shotgun and is required to reload, while pinning a mook to the wall with the business end of the weapon, when he finishes reloading the results are spectacular
-   The film **Kick-Ass** averts this — in the climax, Hit-Girl reloads her guns in the air... literally. Something that has to be seen, preferably widescreen. And at some point she finally does run out of bullets.
-   Averted in **Kingsman: The Secret Service**. Guns run out of bullets and need to be reloaded or replaced throughout the movie, especially in the church scene.
-   Used in **Last Man Standing**. We do see Bruce Willis using up mags and having to reload, and there is a scene which shows him loading numerous spare magazines from boxes of cartridges, but he seems to be able to fit an inordinate number of magazines in his pockets.
-   Averted in **The Last of the Mohicans:** The 18th Century weapons only fire a single round before being empty. The amount of time it takes to reload is even shown. At one point, Hawkeye and Uncas have to provide sniper cover for a runner. They are seen loading several weapons before the runner starts, and simply pick up a new one after they shoot. In the climax, Hawkeye shoots one Mook, reloads his gun **while running**, picks up another rifle, and then shoots two different targets with them. He then discards the previous enemy rifle (which is now empty) and picks up a new one, uses that one to kill another Mook, and then takes the others hostage with his now empty gun.
-   **Live Free or Die Hard**. John McClane seems to spend over half of the first action scene repeatedly slamming new magazines into his automatic, to the point where you start wondering where he got all those from (of course, McClane bringing five to ten extra mags to a run-of-the-mill arrest, just in case, is actually kind of in-character). Even John falls victim to this aversion in the first movie. He only fires 16-17 shots before he first reloads his Beretta. This means that he at most fires one more bullet than the gun can carry. He also probably takes his reloads from his enemies' corpses, and the amount of ammo he has left becomes an important plot point.
-   Averted in both film adaptations of **Lolita**. Humbert has to stop and reload his revolver in the middle of trying to kill Claire Quilty, which only adds to the Black Comedy of the scene.
-   Averted in **The Road Warrior**, where it's revealed nearly halfway through that the Sawed-Off Shotgun Max threatened the Gyro Captain with was unloaded, and only one of the shells he finds at that point is usable (and even then it ends up being a dud when he tries to actually fire it in the climactic fight).
    
    **Gyro Captain:** Empty! All this time...! That's dishonest.
    
-   The final showdown in the serial **The Masked Marvel** has the Big Bad and eponymous Masked Marvel shooting at each other while taking cover behind furniture. Ten shots in, the villain leaves cover and announces he's been counting bullets: The Masked Marvel has shot six times (so his gun is empty) but the villain has two shots left. The Masked Marvel similarly leaves cover, agrees with the villain, then **shoots him**. A lampshaded case of this trope? No, the Masked Marvel simply reloaded during the villain's "now I have won!" speech.
-   **The Matrix** avoids this, at least in the first movie's Lobby Scene... to some degree. The protagonists take cover until the mooks shooting at them begin to reload, then run out and dodge the bullets of other mooks, who are not out of ammo. Likewise, the protagonists use Throw-Away Guns in their counterattacks.
    -   Demonstrated even more dramatically when Neo fights Smith in the subway. They charge each other, firing away and wrestling in slo-mo until they have their guns pointed at each other's head... but they are both out of ammo. Which is, amusingly, one of the cases where having bottomless magazines **would** make sense, since they are inside virtual reality, Smith is even a part of it, the Matrix was clearly demonstrated to be capable of altering the surroundings on the fly, and the whole point of Agents is that they possess supernatural abilities.
-   In an early scene of **Mission: Impossible III**, Ethan Hunt invokes one trope, averts it a few seconds later, and then averts this one. He manages to shoot the wing of an airplane with a high-powered machine gun and takes it down. He then runs after Philip Seymour Hoffman's villain character who is escaping in a helicopter. Not only does he miss the first few shots but he runs out of ammo soon after.
-   In the Troma flick **A Nymphoid Barbarian In Dinosaur Hell**, which is set After the End, Marn acquires a gun. An old man warns him that it has limited ammo. It runs out after six shots.
-   In **Predators**, after the group sprays bullets with reckless abandon at the first alien they see, Royce warns everyone to count how many bullets they have left and to conserve ammunition. Isabelle's sniper rifle runs out in one scene. As the movie goes on, **every** character eventually runs completely out of ammo and is forced to improvise.
-   Averted in **Pulp Fiction** where Jules is shown running out of ammo after repeatedly shooting Brett. It's debatably the only reason why he stopped firing.
    -   And yet despite the gun being clearly empty (the slide is locked back), when they replay the scene to include the last guy running out to shoot them, he just raises his gun and fires.
        -   The camera does cut away for a while, so it's possible that, like the **Noir** example above, Jules and Vincent reload off screen.
-   **Thoroughly** averted in **Punisher: War Zone**, where the Punisher is almost **constantly** reloading during his firefights — either conventionally or in the "New York" fashion.
    -   It also shows a very rare example of character changing mags **before** they went dry just to make sure he won't run out of ammo in the middle of shootout.
    -   Also Jigsaw and Loony Bin Jim surrender only because they run out of ammo and they apparently haven't brought spare mags.
-   Reversed in **The Raid**. Lt. Wahyu acquires a S&W 327 from a thug near the end of the movie. Over the rest of the film he fires six shots, and then tries to commit suicide with it. The gun fails to fire with a big CLICK. That particular revolver is notable for having an eight shot cylinder, instead of the usual six.
-   **Saving Private Ryan** — The Squad mostly runs out of ammo during the climactic battle and are reduced to hand-throwing mortar shells and other Improvised Weapon attacks. Both Capt. Miller and Sgt. Horvath are down to nothing but their sidearms and Reibin's BAR seems to be the only primary weapon that still has rounds left.
-   Averted in **Scarface (1983)** to the point that characters with submachine guns tend to get shot exactly when they have to reload after spraying out all ammo.
-   Averted in **Serenity**, where Jayne runs out of ammo for his submachine gun during the Reaver chase at the beginning. Later, during the final battle against the Reavers, the crew rapidly runs out of ammunition while killing wave after wave of enemies, to the point where Jayne comments that he's down to "three full mags, and my swingin' cod."
-   Somewhat avoided in **Shoot 'Em Up**, as he continually switches weapons (taking fresh ones from any old dead mooks, of which he creates plenty). However, every gun does seem to have lots of bullets before needing to be replaced.
-   Averted by, of all things, **Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2**. Ricky uses exactly six bullets from his revolver during his "Garbage Day" rampage, then when he goes to commit suicide when more cops come to arrest him, he discovers that the gun is empty.
-   Subverted in **Silver Streak**; the protagonist quickly runs out of bullets in a shootout. His sidekick chastises him with "What do you think this is, a Western?" It's a reference to Gene Wilder's previous role as the Waco Kid in **Blazing Saddles**.
-   In **Sucker Punch**, the girls never fire more than their weapons can hold, and constantly pause to reload.
-   **Terminator**, with occasional loading shots. In fact, in **Terminator 2: Judgment Day**, the number of shells Sarah loads into a particular gun turns out to be important several minutes later.
    -   Additionally, a few SWAT team members engage the Terminator with their backup pistols. Given that they'd been firing their MP5 submachine guns for a good thirty seconds straight before that, it's implied that they were out of magazines for them.
    -   The T-800's M79 is something of an inversion, as how many grenades he has in his bandolier varies between scenes, and ultimately he starts with eleven grenades but runs out after only eight (seven fired plus one dropped mid-loading).
    -   Sarah's shotgun also has an inversion despite the continuity. Right before the T-1000 skewers her shoulder, she chambers a shell. When she loads the six other shells, she pumps the gun again, which would've ejected the first shell and only leave her with six shots instead of the seven she later fires.
-   In **This Means War (2012)**, Tuck runs out of ammo in two fight scenes, causing FDR to scold him for not carrying extra magazines like he does.
-   Averted in the first **Tomb Raider** movie. How Lara reloads her guns is shown (if in an implausible, Hand Wave way), and mooks are repeatedly seen changing magazines.
-   Averted (and lampshaded) in **Tremors 2: Aftershocks**, when Burt Gummer drives up in his truck.
    
    I am **completely** out of ammo. **(slumps down, pause)** That's never happened to me before.
    
-   Averted in **True Lies**. During the chase scene at the beginning, Arnie's character fires off exactly eleven rounds from his pistol before being seen to reload.
-   Averted once in **Ultraviolet (2006)**. The bad guys' helicopter-mounted gatling gun runs out of ammo and needs to be reloaded, giving the heroine a chance to drive/jump a motorbike through the heli, blowing it up in the process. Otherwise ignored through literal Hyperspace Arsenals.
-   Averted in the film version of **V for Vendetta**.
    
    **Creedy:** We have guns.  
    **V:** No, what you have are bullets, and the hope that when your guns are empty, I'm no longer standing, because if I am... you'll all be dead before you've reloaded.
    
-   Averted in **The Way of the Gun**, which shows many characters reloading various weapons as they crouch behind cover. Christopher McQuarrie employed his brother, a former Navy SEAL, in an effort to treat firearm usage realistically.
-   Averted thoroughly in **Zulu Dawn**, in which the British at Isandlwana have the Zulus pinned down with hideously effective gunfire and are holding their position well, but suddenly find themselves scrabbling for their last few rounds. Meanwhile, the quartermasters are handing it out to the drummer boys a packet (20 shots) at a time, as if they were at peacetime manoeuvres, to take to troops several hundred yards away. Historically accurate. The few survivors who got to Rorke's Drift before the fighting reached there tipped the troops at the Drift off as to what had happened, and all the ammo boxes were opened at once before the battle started. Things then went very differently. And by the end of that one, their 20,000 rounds were down to about 900.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Literature

-   Averted in **1632**. Even with as much ammunition as there would be in a West Virginia mining town circa 2000, they have to be careful about spending too much of it, as it is terrifically hard to make **more**.
-   In **The Adventures of Samurai Cat**, Tomokato's older brother Shimura demonstrated in the second book that the "Badass" part of Retired Badass still applied: he carried an utterly ridiculous number of Colt .45 semi-automatic pistols in his kimono, and his wife had an even more ludicrous amount of extra ammunition. But they **still** ran dry during the big shoot-out of that story.
-   Louis L'Amour usually averted this in his Western novels, even pointing out that even in a loaded pistol, the chamber under the hammer was left empty to prevent accidents, meaning one less bullet than modern audiences might expect.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
-   Subverted in **Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident** when after learning about the goblins using supposedly-destroyed weapons adapted to human batteries, Foaly remarks that 'You'd only get six shots, but you give every goblin a pocket full of cells and that's a lot of shots.' Whereas normal fairy weapons use nuclear batteries that essentially have unlimited ammo, Holly even comments on it when the goblin shooting at her runs out of shots.
-   In the Jack Ryan novel **The Bear and the Dragon**, during the inevitable war sequence, a hardened target comes up to be hit. The initial idea is to use ground-penetrating bombs (aka Bunker Busters), until someone points out that **getting** the bombs that have already been used in the campaign required several days of direct, non-stop flights, and that the bombs might not even be available. True to form, the arsenal has been depleted, and while the manufacturer is making more, they won't be available for weeks.
-   Averted in **The Dark Tower** series. In the first few novels, Roland worries about how much ammo he has left, until he makes a pit stop and buys a few hundred bullets. Also, during every firefight, Roland and his friends must reload.
-   An allegedly bottomless magazine is the key clue in an **Encyclopedia Brown** mystery. A (crooked) lawman claimed that he received two minor gunshot wounds before taking the gun away from the man who shot him and then killed the gun's owner and his four cohorts with one bullet each. The town hailed the sheriff as a hero until somebody pointed out that you can't shoot seven bullets from a six-shooter without reloading at some point.
-   Mentioned in **Fatal Descent** by Carter Dickson and John Rhode: One character is editing a book in which the protagonist carries a six-gun, but fires 13 times without reloading. Another character suggests giving him two guns and taking out a bang.
-   In Dan Abnett's **Gaunt's Ghosts** novel **The Guns of Tanith**, it's a crucial point, because they were supplied with the wrong sort of power pack and must jump practically unarmed.
-   Averted during some of the later **Honor Harrington** books. In addition to all the other destruction it caused, the Oyster Bay strike destroyed Manticore's missile production lines. For the next several books, Manitcore's strategic and tactical decisions are constantly being influenced by the need to conserve their limited missile supplies.
-   Carefully averted in **The Hunger Games**: Katniss is limited to a total of twelve arrows, and retrieves used arrows whenever she can. Several times throughout the story, the reader is informed about exactly how many arrows she still has.
-   An energy-weapon aversion in **Galactic Patrol**; Kimball Kinnison drains the power packs of several blasters while waiting for his suit batteries to recharge.
-   Averted in **Les Misérables**, in the barricade sequence; several plot points hinge on the need to conserve powder and bullets, not least the death of Gavroche, who's shot while out in front of the barricade scavenging ammo from fallen guardsmen.
-   Legolas is mentioned to be out of arrows at least twice in **The Lord of the Rings**. He often has to pick up orc arrows to refill his quiver. This never causes him any problems, despite orcs using smaller bows and thus shorter arrows.
-   Averted in Kerry Greenwood's **Murder in Montparnasse** when the Big Bad gets taken out after running out of bullets.
    
    **Phryne:** Six shots. He has six shots in that gun. That was the third.  
    **Lin:** What are they going to do?  
    **Phryne:** I don't know, but as soon as he runs out of ammunition, I wouldn't be René for a thousand pounds.  
    **(two more shots, then a third.)**  
    \[one of the guys hunting René\]: Bugger!  
    **Phryne:** That's six.
    
-   Purposely averted in all adaptations of the Intellivision game **Night Stalker**. In the Intellivision version you get six shots for each gun. In the Atari 2600 version **Dark Cavern** each gun gives you up to 10 shots, which you can accumulate throughout the game, up to 99 shots.
-   In **Only Sense Online**, one of the reasons why the bow is disdained by players of the titular VRMMORPG is because arrows are one-use consumables and acquiring them from shops is very inefficient.
-   Averted in **REAMDE**, which contains an almost fetishistic level of detail on firearm handling. Stephenson even credits someone as his firearm copyeditor.
-   The ammo in the father's revolver is a constant concern in the Post-Apocalyptic novel **The Road**. He starts with only a few bullets and at one point gets so desperate that he fashions fake bullets out of spent casings so that he can bluff people.
-   Consistently averted in **A Simple Survey**. When firearms show up, they almost always have a specific amount of ammunition, and its scarcity is a plot point. The most extreme example of this is a story in which each character has a handgun with exactly one bullet.
-   Averted once in the **Star Wars** novel **Tyrant's Test**: Chewbacca and his son are on a mission to rescue Han, and in the final battle they switch out their blasters for bowcasters, partly because the enemy has blast shields, but also partly because they're almost out of power for the blasters.
-   Averted in H. Beam Piper's **Uller Uprising**, when the male protagonist is impressed by his new, previously civilian adjutant taking their supply of ammunition into account (see page quote). They can't produce ammunition as fast as they've been expending it, and need to end the war before they run out.
-   Averted in Marion Zimmer Bradley's **Warrior Woman**, in which gladiators using slingshots are handicapped by being given a fixed number of stones (fourteen); the crowd chants the number of shots taken.
-   **Whateley Universe**: Predictably, given how Gun Tropes are generally treated in this series, this is mostly averted; several of the authors are meticulous about things like magazine sizes, jams, reloading times, weapon maintenance, and so forth. However, given the presence of both Functional Magic and Mad Science hypertech, there are exceptions, though they are usually explicit ones. The most notable of these are the Aegis reloaders, which use Hammerspace to reload the REACT team's heavy weapons. There are only a few of them, however, and they are carefully monitored because the bullets fed through them completely disintegrate after a few minutes, making them a potential nightmare for law enforcement. They also tend to jam during extended firing in a way which destroys the mechanism.
-   Invoked in Karl May's **Winnetou** novels and related work. Author Avatar Old Shatterhand's "Henry carbine" (not to be confused with the real life Henry **rifle**) actually packs "only" twenty-five shots into a magazine that's apparently complex enough that few if any enemies who manage to get hold of the gun ever figure it out, but because that's still a lot of shots between reloads and he rarely needs to expend them all before topping it off again a number of his more superstitious adversaries — especially those who only know him by reputation — do end up convinced that the weapon is somehow magical and a straight example of the trope, and he in turn takes full advantage of that misconception quite a few times.
-   Subverted in **Wolfhound Empire** from Peter Higgins. Investigator Lom goes through several different weapons, while the first instance was him losing his favourite gun because of getting captured and interrogated by the militia, the other examples were simply him running out of ammunition and not being to get more (for instance he throws away a high-calibre submachine gun that had been modified to take 100 round drum magazines and was strong enough to kill an especially strong giant in a single burst).
-   **World War Z** — In the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Yonkers, the US military engages the horde of 8 million zombies shuffling north of of Manhattan with anti-tank weapons, against what was obviously a human wave attack. Veteran (more accurately "survivor") of Yonkers Todd Waino explains that even if they thought the armor-piercing depleted-uranium rounds the tanks fired were useful against a massed zombie horde (which they are not)...all of the heavy artillery ran out of ammunition after under an hour of sustained fire. Waino says that it simply **never occurred** to the officers commanding the battle to count how many rounds they had. Something as basic as "this tank can carry 40 rounds, and fire once a minute; wow, they'll need a reload in 40 minutes". Maybe they thought a single shot would take out hundreds of zombies each time...but against a horde literally numbering in the millions?
-   **The Zombie Survival Guide** also averts this trope in several ways. It notes that power tools can be effective against the undead...until the batteries run out and they provide as much protection as a hand-held stereo. Also, using battery-powered sights on guns should be avoided, as they'd just be blank tubes once the batteries run out. Finally, there's Maxim #4: "Blades don't need reloading."

Bottomless Magazines Example in Live-Action TV

-   **Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.**:
    -   Averted in the first season finale; Coulson's BFG runs out of charges just as he defeats out all but the two most dangerous opponents in the room.
    -   During Skye's big fight scene in "The Dirty Half Dozen", she runs out half-way and reloads. Notably, her pistol isn't slide-locked empty, indicating her skill by reloading before she's empty
-   **Arrow**:
    -   Generally played straight, but subverted in one of the earlier and more realistic episodes where the Villain of the Week makes sure to have as many henchmen as Oliver has arrows, so that by the time Ollie gets to him he's out of ammo.
    -   In a much later episode, Cupid's partners tell her not to waste time retrieving her arrows from dead bodies. She replies "Do you have any idea how expensive these are?"
-   **Batman (1966)**: Averted on the old TV series, where the villains are shooting at Batman behind smoke; when the smoke clears, it's revealed that not only does Batman have a shield, he knows the villains are now out of bullets and can attack them.
-   **Doctor Who**: Averted in "The Doctor Dances" when Capt. Jack's Sonic Blaster runs out of power; amusingly, a few moments before, he was making fun of the Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver.
-   **Due South**: Averted at least once. Constable Fraser confidently approaches a criminal pointing a gun at him, telling him that he's out of ammo (the pistol is a 9-shot), while his partner and another cop argue over whether he is, or whether he still has a bullet or two left (one says he's heard 8 shots, the other says only 7). Turns out Fraser was right and he had used all 9.
-   **Farscape**:
    -   Seems to play this straight as pulse pistols have absurd numbers of shots...but in one episode John runs out of ammo. Lampshading how unlikely it is to run out of shots with a 500 round battery, and then getting understandably irate when the pulse pistol he loots from an enemy ALSO runs out of energy after only a handful of shots.
        
        **Crichton:** You are the most powerful hand gun in the Uncharted Territories and I don't know whether you've fired 500 shots or 600 but - **(checks the cartridge)** - 600. Empty. Damn you! Winona would never do this because Winona is very reliable!
        
    -   Played for Laughs in another episode where John and Aeryn start firing at each other during an argument (the crew are being driven nuts by a Poisonous Person they picked up). After a few seconds both of their weapons run dry leaving them pulling the triggers to no effect. Aeryn asks John if he has any spare cartridges but he doesn't. The pair toss aside their useless weapons and opt for charging at each other to continue the fight.
-   **Firefly**: Averted with Energy Weapons no less, for at least one character who discovered that, although a hand laser looks pretty cool, it starts giving the "low battery" warning after only three shots or so.
-   **Get Smart**:
    -   When Max and 99 are in a department store, Max suggests that he shoot out the lights for cover. He fires six shots, but there's still one light. He tries to shoot that one, but he's out of ammo. 99 then turns off the light switch. For the rest of the episode Max tries to bluff KAOS agents with his empty gun.
    -   When Max and his boss are in a gunfight with a KAOS agent, Max suddenly stands up and says that he's going on strike until his boss approves a better contract for him. His boss then sighs and signs the contract while Max and the KAOS agent discuss what sorts of benefits KAOS offers. When he signs the contract, the KAOS agent pulls the trigger on his gun, but nothing happens. Max then captures him and calmly says that he heard him fire six shots. When his boss says that he only heard five shots, Max takes the gun and tries to fire again - when it goes off and Max sheepishly says "Six."
-   **Hou$e of Lie$**: Averted for comic effect in the first season finale, where the protagonist—even though he's using imaginary (and invisible) pistols in a breaking-the-fourth-wall fantasy—has to take a few seconds to reload once he's out.
-   **Jake 2.0**: Averted, where the protagonist caught in a predator/prey situation is able to beat an armed villain. After deliberately coming out of hiding, the man raises his gun to shoot Jake, only to realize that he's out, told that he should keep track, and is promptly knocked out with a lead pipe.
-   **Jericho (2006)**:
    -   Averted, wherein the people of the town are very conscious of their ammunition, and the heroes are continually requesting new magazines and fighting over the actual weapons themselves.
    -   Used by Hawkins and Jake during a gunfight when they count the number of shots a bad guy spends before making their move.
-   **Leverage**: Surprisingly averted in the Season 3 finale: despite the totally over the top nature of the rest of the gunfight, Eliot stops to reload several times, raids bodies for spare magazines, and does not significantly exceed the potential capacity of the guns he's using.
-   **Revolution**: Averted, since a major factor in the story is that ammunition for modern weapons is in very short supply. In fact, Monroe was discussing the issue with Miles in a flashback in episode 10. If characters gets hold of a loaded gun, it will usually only have a few bullets in it and they quickly have to go back to using bows and swords. In some instances the trope even gets inverted when weapons that should have a full magazine, run dry after 2-3 shots.
-   **The Rockford Files**: Generally averted. It is frequently important to the plot that Jim's gun fires only six shots, and he never has any extra ammunition.
-   **Stargate SG-1**:
    -   The SG team members actually have to reload their guns now and again, and not just for the sake of dramatically running low. One episode that still stands out has a rogue NID agent escaping from a special forces team, using a machine pistol to lay down suppressive fire and shoot a lock out of a door. At least twice, after a couple of sustained bursts, he ejects his magazine and slaps a fresh one in.
    -   In another episode, they give the villagers guns and join them to try and repel Ori footsoldiers, but are overrun when they run out of ammo... and judging by the befuddled looks of the villagers, they didn't have time to warn them beforehand.
    -   In the early episode "Emancipation", O'Neill trades his sidearm to a warlord in exchange for Carter. The warlord proceeds to show off to his companions by Firing in the Air a Lot and O'Neill quietly mutters they should get moving before he finishes the magazine and realizes he was duped.
-   **Viper**: Averted in one episode, where robbers take hostages, one of them manages to seize a robber's gun — and the robbers start calculating whether it has any bullets left.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Tabletop Games

-   **BattleTech** mostly averts this. Non-energy weapons draw upon a finite supply of ammunition stored in the carrying unit and individual shots or salvos are tracked not just to determine when they run out, but also to compute the damage caused by an exploding ammo bin on an appropriate critical hit — shots already expended obviously can't blow up anymore. Some weapons still do pack fairly silly numbers of shots into a single ammo slot, though (machine guns being particularly bad offenders), and ammo expenditure for most infantry-level weapons is indeed not tracked on the boardgame level (which, to be fair, is more concerned with the interaction between larger units with bigger guns).
-   In **Infinity**, most weapons are assumed to be unlimited, but certain weapons have limits - the Panzerfaust, for example, is basically a two-shot mini-rocket launcher.
-   Averted in **Psionics: The Next Stage in Human Evolution**. Every gun has an ammo capacity and firing on fully automatic (if possible) will empty your clip in one round.
-   Laser barrels in **Paranoia** are rated for six shots (with the usual 5% chance of exploding during any given shot). You **can** go over the limit, but the chance of explosion keeps going up. Some gamemasters keep careful count of shots fired; others just pick someone who hasn't reloaded in a while, roll some dice, ignore the result and declare that their weapon explodes. Now please report for termination, Citizen. Have a pleasant day. The Computer is your friend.
-   Shadowrun gives limited ammunition for all weapons (yes, even the laser guns). Some have absurdly large magazines (the Fichetti Security pistol is a light handgun with a 30-bullet magazine), but they are all limited. Most even make sense.
-   The **Star Wars d20** game gives limited ammo for most blasters, which makes sense as they are actually shooting plasma (ionized gas), not laser bolts. However, blaster pistols don't need a new power pack until you have fired **a hundred shots** (blaster rifles are slightly more reasonable at 50).
-   **Warhammer 40,000** has a few exceptions: combi-weapons are boltguns with a one-shot special weapon attachment, the Manticore missile launcher gets four missiles and then is done, the Black Templars get the Holy Orb of Antioch (a one-shot super-grenade), and a few other one-shot powers.
    -   The spinoff game Aeronautica Imperialis has limited ammunition for every weapon. Yes, even rayguns.
    -   The community ruleset for 40k using the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay rules has not only limited ammunition but a 10% chance of jamming every time you fire a full-auto weapon.
    -   The Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer Fantasy rules state that they assume all models have sufficient shots to last the entire battle (given the average game length, that translates to around six or eight bullets/laser bolts/bursts of small metal shuriken/arrows/powder charges/crossbow bolts/javelins/etc. per person, which is perfectly reasonable). However, certain scenario rules do limit the number of shots units can take in a turn (mostly justified by limited supplies).
    -   On the whole, the 40k and Fantasy universes tend to avert the trope - some by the simple expedient of "The model has enough shots to last the battle", but in the specialist games this is looked into in more details. The fantasy spinoff **Mordheim** has certain weapons (such as barbed arrows and vials of holy water) that had limited ammunition, but the 40k narrative game **Inquisitor** took it to ridiculous levels with noting down the number of shots, the time taken to reload, the number of magazines a person has and even what order the special bullet types were preloaded in. As a general rule, the less models to keep track of, the more detailed the mechanics.
    -   Certain rules advert this. The Dire Avengers can use a special attack called "Bladestorm" where each member of the squad gets an additional shot to their standard gun, but doing so expends the remainder of the ammunition in the gun, forcing them to reload next turn (and thus cannot fire, but curiously can still fight in close combat). Heavy Weapons also have this limitation, being unable to move and fire in the same turn unless the wielder has Relentless, rationalizing that the bearer has to load up the gun(in the case of Missile launchers) or charge it up and brace himself for the attack. Likewise, Ordinance weapons and Barrage Artillery Weapons must remain stationary to fire even on a tank, as the crew needs to manually load each shell into the firing chamber.
    -   One Apocalypse formation, the Tyranid Endless Swarm, has an entertaining special rule: if any one unit rolls five or more 6's to hit while shooting at them, their weapons all jam and the Tyranids take no damage.
    -   Discussed in the Horus Heresy novel **Know No Fear**, while some Ultramarines are talking about Orks. One of them points out how important round count is, since while it's not too hard to kill an Ork with massive damage, this needs to be balanced against how many friends he brought along (which is usually quite a large number).
    -   The massive gatling gun mounted on the Stompa can fire out a ludicrous amount of bullets in a single turn, but there's a chance that the loaders would get a bit too zealous and load ALL of the ammunition into it. This is represented by the weapon firing a (ridiculously huge) random amount of shots determined by dice, and if a certain result comes up it means the gun has run out of ammo.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Video Games

-   **Ace Online** hilariously averts the biggest argument (who would want to pull the plane over to reload) almost because it can: You **do** have to pull your fighter plane over and top up on bullets and missiles. And you can carry over **1400** of some types of missiles.
-   **Advance Wars** gives ammo limits to the heavy weapons — most notably the main guns on artillery, AA guns, tanks, ships and mechanised infantry. Of course, towns and APCs have a seemingly bottomless supply of ammo to provide them. In addition, the secondary weapons (typically machine guns) never run out of ammo.
-   In **Akane the Kunoichi**, Akane never runs out of kunais to throw, and can easily go through hundreds. Enemies don't run out either, although their rate of fire is low enough that it's less conspicuous.
-   Averted in **Alien Shooter TD**. Normally in Tower Defense games, defense buildings and Hero Units have unlimited ammo to cut out that extra bit of management when you're constantly being Zerg Rushed. **Alien Shooter TD** is an exception and even worse reloading your ammo costs a ton of money - the exact price of whatever gun you have equipped, making use of more powerful weapons disadvantageous. This is why We Will Use Lasers in the Future, the energy weapon troops' guns not only have the best statlines, they can also learn a skill which allows their weapons to self-charge a percentage of the magazine (giving them "unlimited ammo" that'll quickly exhaust in major fight until you either wait out for the next recharge period or shell out money and buy a new magazine).
-   Averted in **Alien Soldier**. Having to conserve your ammunition makes the game that much harder.
-   Averted in **Amagon**: Amagon uses a machine gun as his weapon, but it only has 300 bullets to start out with.
-   **Armed and Dangerous** has conversations between Q and Jonsey that blatantly poke fun at this trope. Unfortunately for Roman, he gets the burden of having both reloads and finite ammunition (though it's plentiful to where running out is of no concern).
    
    **Jonsey:** Q? Do you ever run out of ammo?  
    **Q:** No. Never.  
    **Jonsey:** Me neither. Weird isn't it? I reload sometimes but I have limitless ammo. It's creepy!
    
-   Averted in **Assassin's Creed** titles that include firearms: the player character has to reload their guns after every use and have limited ammunition. Enemies also have to reload after each use but conceivably have infinite ammo (such as during the Bunker Hill sequence in **Assassin's Creed III** in which there is a large mass of soldiers in firing lines who will fire at the opposite side forever, but have to reload each time. Non-gunpowder weapons (such as throwing knives, bows, and blowguns) don't have reload times but **do** have limited ammunition. Enemies, however, get unlimited arrows.
-   Averted in **Blitzkrieg** where transports, trucks and haulers must be used to resupply units, down to the last rifleman. Skilled players could cripple their enemies by destroying their supply vehicles, adding a strategic dimension.
-   Like its older brother **Duke Nukem**, **Blood (1997)** was an early pioneer in avoiding this with its sawn-off shotgun. It can fire two shots, then a reloading animation plays. Going for a double-barrel shot will always have it be followed by a reload. This is a more subtle example, as Caleb's reloading animation still takes less than a second, meaning the weapon can still rapid-fire somewhat effectively. The other weapons in the game also toy with this; the flare gun needs to be reloaded after every shot, and most of the other weapons are fantastical, leaving only the tommy gun as a weapon that holds more rounds than the real one could ever manage (it holds 500 rounds total, which even the infamous drum mag could only manage a fraction of).
-   In the Fighting Game **Bushido Blade**; during your fight with the Giant Space Flea from Nowhere Katze, he has a pistol and you have a sword. However, he only has six shots before he has to stop and reload. While he reloads, he's absolutely helpless and can be easily killed. This was repeated in the sequel, although one of your opponents carries a freaking machine gun and both of them are practically impossible to kill while reloading now.
-   In **Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth**, not only you have to reload your guns as in real life, but you also have to memorize how much ammo you have left in your magazine, since there is no visible counter! And there's no crosshair, so you'll have to manually aim using the normal iron sight on the gun. Which is not necessarily an easy task, one might add, as broken bones are not only possible but probable.
-   **Usually** the case in the old Arcade Game **Charley Chuck's Food Fight**, whose objective is to fight your way past four mean chefs to get to an ice cream cone by throwing food from large piles of it. In most cases, this depletes the pile quickly. The one exception are the watermelons, which have an unlimited supply.
-   Downplayed in **Deep Space Nine: The Fallen** with the smallest pistol, which has infinite power, but must be recharged.
-   In the **Close Combat** series of strategy games (not the first person shooter **First to Fight**) you command platoon- or company-size units of infantry and tanks which start each mission with an allotment of ammo and NO re-supply. If you shoot your machine gun dry trying to suppress the enemy positions, that's it. If your tank expends all its shells trying to blast the enemy out of buildings, that's it. Mortars, tanks, and machine guns have particularly serious problems with this. Running the enemy out of ammo is actually a valid tactic in some situations.
-   **Company of Heroes** is an exception to the no reloading clause, with individual rifleman doing so in addition to the various artillery/heavy weapons pieces.
-   In the original **Conflict** for the NES and its sequel **Super Conflict** for the SNES, any units with "special weapons" had to re-supply those at a city (or airport for flying units). The standard weapons, which were all variations of machine guns, never needed to be reloaded.
-   Zig-zagged in **Control**. The Service Weapon is a shapeshifting Eldritch Abomination that takes the form of typical video-game guns. It has a limited number of shots that varies depending on which form it's using, but the ammo regenerates when it's not being fired. There are some upgrades that even have a chance to refund a shot when you hit an enemy.
-   The video game adaptation of **The Crow: City of Angels** has a very unfair zigzagging of this trope. All of the enemies with firearms come out with guns already drawn carrying unlimited ammo, while you need to pick up guns and ammo off the ground before you can fire, and you only get a few shots before running out of ammo.
-   In the **Crusader** games, waaaay back in 1995/96, you had to manage magazines for the various projectile-based weapons.
-   Kind of played straight, kind of averted in **The Darkness**. Jackie is given a pair of guns for his birthday in the opening cutscene, but "ammo" for this weapon makes him pick up and use the guns of dead mooks instead. He will carry and go through dozens of these guns until you reach your last "magazine", at which point he will revert to using his birthday presents.
-   **Darksiders**: Strife's guns, Mercy and Redemption, have unlimited ammo. Justified, since Strife is a Horseman of the Apocalypse, so these aren't normal firearms. **Darksiders Genesis** plays slightly with this trope: standard shots are unlimited, but enhancements (such as electric or fire) need ammo. Thankfully, it drops fairly often, so it's not that big of a problem.
-   Zigzags in **Dark Sun** games. Averted for the most powerful ranged weapon — bows need arrows (though there is a magic bow that uses a spell instead). Magical arrows are rare, but plenty of non-magical arrows can be picked off dead enemies or bought in a friendly civilized area. Number of arrows in a single inventory slot is unlimited and their weight doesn't matter. Played straight for weaker slings (supposedly rocks are everywhere) and chatkchas (thri-kreen thrown propellers).
-   **Deus Ex** avoids this. You and your enemies have to reload, and a limited amount of magazines, when they've spent all their ammo they'll usually start hitting you with melee weapons instead — and though bots appear to have bottomless magazines, they will run out of ammo if you wait long enough (usually long enough to kill you several times over). When the bots run out of ammo they'll say "Low Ammo" and attempt to run away.
-   In **Dirge of Cerberus** you can equip your guns with an auto reload contraption so you can shoot until you really run out of ammos (very useful when you sacrifice mag space for power or range)
-   In **Doom Troopers** you need to find ammo pickups to top up the ammo pool on your basic guns, but you never have to reload. This trope is also played with, in the following way. The Doomtroopers can run out of ammo, but when they do they will slowly regenerate up to 10 bullets. Max and Mitch will do this infinitely until you find more ammo or the level ends. Note that their special weapons don't regenerate in this manner.
-   **Duke Nukem 3D** was one of the first FPS games to avert this. The semi-auto pistol went through a reloading animation (with Duke ejecting the spent magazine and replacing it with a fresh one) every twelve shots. However, this being an old game for MS-DOS-era PCs when having a 144 MHz Pentium MMX and 32 MB RAM counted as state-of-the-art, the game engine didn't actually keep track of the shots present in your magazine; instead, the game engine blocked the firing hotkey and played the reload animation whenever the ammo counter hit a multiple of 12. This had the side effect of making it impossible to change magazine other than by depleting your current one. The modern DukePlus Game Mod keeps a separate ammo counter for it, however, and Duke can reload whenever he wants. The same goes for the MP5 replacement for the Ripper, and in both, One Bullet Clips is in full effect.
-   **Earth 2150** has limited ammo for all weapons. Energy weapons recharge over time, but units using grenades, bullets or rockets need to be resupplied by plane. Guard your supply center well.
    -   Every non-energy/chemical vehicle-mounted weapon in the sequel, **Earth 2160**, also have limited ammo. Fortunately, it's easier to supply that ammo. For the ED, an ammo supply can be built, which will automatically take care of supplying ammo via a projectile. For the UCS, it's a lot more annoying as ammo can only be supplied using an air unit that's highly susceptable to anti-air weapons and because ammo-limited vehicles are the staple units in their army.
    -   The computer, of course, plays it straight. Due to relatively low damage output and lots of hit points of most units sometimes even truly incredible superiority in numbers for a single battle is nothing if you don't have supplies.
    -   Played straight with the artillery in **Empire** and **Napoleon**, as warfare in the featured time periods was heavily influenced by cannons. Musket- and rifle-armed infantry do have limited ammo, although you're not likely to run out in most battles, especially since you'll be often sending in the same infantry on bayonet charges after a few volleys. In **Empire**, until you develop ring bayonets, your soldiers will not be able to shoot for the rest of the battle if you have them plug up the barrels with blades and charge.
-   Most weapons in **E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy** have quite limited magazine sizes; players will reload frequently. Every set of two or three magazines takes up a spot in the player's inventory, so some planning is needed on how much ammunition will be required for every gun the user is taking — and indeed the choice of how many guns to take — with every gun in the player's inventory cutting into the ammunition space of the others.
-   **Fallout**:
    -   All weapons have limited capacities and can only be fired a limited number of times (using action points) before you need to manually reload them (which also costs action points). If an NPC runs out of ammunition, he usually switches to a melee weapon and closes the distance, though it happened very rarely due to most NPC carrying enough rounds for a few full reloads and most fights being over before that point (unless you stole their spare ammo \[meaning they would be left with only a full mag\] or picked a trait turning you into a Walking Disaster Area \[thereby potentially making them lose ammunition through Critical Failure\]). An idling animation for pistols, on the other hand, has the character empty a magazine from the gun and load another one without that actually affecting the number of bullets in the gun at the moment.
    -   The Final Boss of **Fallout** — The Master — never had to reload the gatling guns connected to his chair. The boss of **Fallout 2** — Frank Horrigan — has to reload his weapon and did run out of ammunition eventually, whereupon he whipped out a really long knife.
    -   Additionally the spare ammo for a gun takes up room in your inventory. For pistols and rifles this is negligible but for heavier weapons (such as machine guns and rocket launchers) carrying enough ammo for a prolonged engagement can put a crimp in the amount of space in your inventory for loot.
    -   In **Fallout 3**:
        -   While you do have to reload regularly depending on weapon, your ammo weighs nothing, which means you can carry absurd amounts of ammunition around the world with you, especially if you trade excessively with the outcasts who trade ammunition for other equipment. Amusingly enough, **nuclear warheads** count as ammunition for game purposes.
        -   An interesting variation occurs with the Gauss Rifle from the "Operation Anchorage" expansion. Each shot requires a new microfusion cell (a type of ammo for energy weapons), but the actual projectiles are pre-loaded into the weapon and never run out (unless that's what the weapon's Durability measures, rather than physical wear as with other weapons).
    -   This is also played with for the enemies of the game. They reload like the player but have literally infinite ammo. They can even spawn ammo for a weapon they pick up off their slain comrades.
    -   In **Fallout: New Vegas**, companion characters are coded to use "Magical Companion Ammo" for their default gun so that they never run out of ammo, though any other weapon you give them uses regular ammo. Also, activating Hardcore mode also gives ammo weight, meaning that you cannot carry a limitless stack of them.
    -   **Fallout 4** features a "Never Ending" modifier for Legendary weapons that plays like the classic use of this, where your weapon still requires ammo, but as long as you have any on your person you can fire it all at once without ever having to swap for a fresh magazine. The Never Ending Laser Musket, on the other hand, behaves entirely different by being able to load as many Fusion Cells as you want and firing it all in one shot, more than enough to drop down a Deathclaw in one hit. A "Never Ending" gatling laser like the Aeternus plays this straight, as it theoretically has infinite ammo, as when you load a fusion core it never depletes it, though some bugs cause it to occasionally use up a fusion core.
-   Averted in **Final Fantasy IV**. Several characters can use bows, but they're entirely worthless without also providing a steady supply of arrows. However the DS remake will not do this, as they wish to balance the characters and removed this restriction.
-   **Final Fantasy Type-0** does much the same thing with King as **Kingdom Hearts** does with Xigbar. While he has infinite magazines, their clip size is limited (initially at 6 shots to each of his two pistols, for a total of twelve shots before a reload). It probably says something that Tetsuya Nomura is associated with both characters (Xigbar is his favourite character for 358's multiplayer mode, and the 'Support Personnel' under his name in Type-0 HD uses King).
-   In the **Fire Emblem** series of games, all weapons have limited ammo, after which they break. Archers, swordsmen, axemen, spearmen and spellcasters all run out of ammo. The only ones who don't attack with their teeth/claws, which would be troublesome if they broke, to say the least.
    -   The weapon's "ammo" actually represents its durability. After using it all up, the weapon breaks. One has to wonder, however, why archers never need to carry arrows, they just pull infinite amounts out of the quivers. And why does a spell book, which only has a single spell written in it, break after casting that spell 40 times?
-   In **Flashback** a pistol has unlimited ammo. The game even tells you it works by shaving small bits of metal and launching them (essentially the same solution **Mass Effect** used later), which effectively means you never need to reload.
-   **Frontlines: Fuel of War** averts this, and doesn't give you much ammo to begin with for some loadouts. Your assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper classes had comfortable ammo slings, but your machine-gunner and submachine gun classes have precious little of it. Your pistol has infinite ammo, but it's largely ineffective; infinite ineffectiveness only gets you so far! Even vehicles can run out of ammo, but they have a suitably large amount of it. This does tend to reduce the horrifying effects that a good tank-driver, jet- or helicopter-pilot can do by a small amount. Once they've reloaded at the airfield, though...
-   In **FTL: Faster Than Light**, neither you nor the enemy has an infinite supply of missiles or drones. Energy weapons never run out, though.
-   Your units in **Girls' Frontline** have limited ammo supplies; they have room for five units of Ammo,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> and they spend one every time they get into a gun fight. To resupply them, you must either move them into a Heliport space or back to your Command Center and use the Resupply action, or end your turn with your squad on one of those spaces (assuming you've left your settings to auto-resupply echelons in this case). If they get into a gun fight with no Ammo, their performance will be crippled.
-   **GoldenEye (1997)** was also one of the earliest games to have a reload function that could be triggered whenever the player wanted and use realistically-sized magazines (the only exception to the latter being the P90's 80-round magazine, because of a mistake in how it was programmed).
-   Subverted in **Guacamelee!** with Flame Face, who has a bad habit of wildly firing his guns into the air/ground, to the point that his first two attempts at boss fights are postponed because he used all his ammo on that and has nothing left to use on the player. Eventually played straight by the time his boss fight finally comes around, where he's apparently finally brought enough ammo to never have to worry about running out.
-   Semi-averted in the **Heroes of Might and Magic** series, in that archers generally have a limited number of shots (everything except the Medusa in the fourth iteration), unless they're acompanied by an Ammo Cart, which allows an infinite number of reloads. Although this gets rather weird when applied to creatures like Beholders whose ranged attack is shooting energy beams out of their eyes, so unless the cart also held high-energy food supplements, there's really nothing it should be able to do for them.
-   All ammunition types in **Ikari Warriors** are limited.
-   **Ikaruga** averts this in the console-exclusive Prototype Mode. Firing a shot uses one bullet, and firing your Homing Lasers uses 120. If you run out of bullets you'll be downgraded to a short-range attack. Bullets can be replenished by absorbing enemy bullets, and you can store up to 999 bullets.
-   Mercenaries in **Jagged Alliance** require ammo, but if they've got spare ammo when their current magazine runs out, they reload by themselves.
-   In the **Jak and Daxter** series the HUD implies that the weapons use limited magazines, displaying ten or twenty rounds below the current weapon's overall ammo count. These deplete with each shot fired, and refill when empty. Actual gameplay completely ignores this, however, letting you constantly fire until you run out of ammo. The trope is played totally straight with turrets and vehicle mounted weapons (turrets do overheat, though).
-   Variation in **Killzone**: Whenever the player reloads with the squad leader's default assault rifle, he always flips over two magazines taped to each other — the second time, he discards these magazines and bring up a new taped pair of magazines. Now becoming common for AK-47s and other weapons using box magazines. Many games play the trope straight by having the character simply flip over the magazine pair, with no indication that the other magazine is refilled or replaced. Based on accounts of real-life bearers who rig the magazines together for efficiency, but eventually have to dispose of both when empty.
-   **Kingdom Hearts** manages to avoid this with the Organization's gunner, Xigbar. While he has unlimited "magazines"(seeing as his bullets/arrows seem to come from nothingness itself) he does have to reload. This is the character's biggest weakness in the multiplayer mode in **358/2 Days**.
-   Downplayed in **Little King's Story**. Animal Hunters have finite arrows (forty for each Hunter) and when they run out of them, they're pretty useless. However they all seem to share the same pool of arrows.
-   The game adaptations of **The Lord of the Rings** is kind of wishy-washy with its ammo. Legolas gets 30 arrows, which is reasonable. Aragorn also gets a reasonable 20 arrows. And Gandalf gets 20 ... magic staff blasts. Where it gets silly is with the hobbits and Gimli, whose throwing items are daggers and axes — and they, too, appear to be carrying upwards of 10 or 20 at any given time, far more than would fit anywhere on their character models.
-   In **The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers** licensed game Aragorn gets forty arrows and Legolas sixty, while Gimli has twenty axes. Enemy archers will never run out of arrows, however.
-   Lionel Starkweather doesn't have extra bullets for his revolver when you confront him at the end of **Manhunt**. If he uses up all six shots without killing you, he'll be out of ammunition and spend the rest of the scene running from you as you chase him with a chainsaw.
-   **Marathon**. You can only carry magazines, not individual ammo. If you want to reload manually... you can't. The only way is to waste the rest of the magazine and wait for a new one to be loaded. Note that some weapons do have almost-instantaneous reload speeds (the fusion pistol), one has an Unorthodox Reload (even the manual teases the player on how the shotguns are supposed to reload themselves by flipping them over T2-style), and one just doesn't have ammo and has to be replaced when running out, usually at the worst time possible (the alien rifle). The enemies, however, have no such limits.
-   **Master of Magic** units have limited ranged shots per battle, whether they use bows or magic. Warships have 99 ammo, though (draw is called after 50 turns, but Haste spell doubles the unit's actions).
-   During regular gameplay in **The Matrix: Path of Neo** your guns will always run out of ammo, unless you pick up more guns.
-   **M.A.X.: Mechanized Assault & Exploration** has a limited amount of ammunition for all vehicles and turrets. You need supply trucks or a visit to the depot to reload vehicles, though if turrets are connected to a supply source, they will reload automatically. The sequel does away with ammunition and supply connectors all together for a more streamlined gameplay.
-   **Medal of Honor** built upon **Goldeneye 007** by being among the first games to implement reloading animations — in **Goldeneye** the reload animation was just Bond lowering his gun for about two seconds, whereas in **Medal of Honor** the MP40 and the Tommygun actually had Patton replace the magazine and cock the bolt.
-   Mostly averted in the **Mega Man (Classic)** and **Mega Man X** games. Any acquired weapons or tools will run out of energy and need to be recharged before they can be fired again. The default Mega/X Buster plays the trope straight since it's connected to the user's power generator.
-   Not only do all units in **Men of War** need to reload their weapons, but they all have limited ammo (even vehicles and stationary guns). It's very common to send your soldiers to scavenge fresh ammo from both friendly and enemy corpses, or loot ammo crates and wrecked vehicles for fresh tank and mortar shells. Fortunately, Universal Ammo means that all submachine guns use the same ammo, all machine guns (including vehicle ones) use the same ammo, all tanks and anti-tank guns use the same shells etc. So you'll never end up totally bereft as long as there are corpses, crates, and armored cars to rifle through.
-   **Metal Gear Solid** has Vulcan Raven lugging around a huge minigun... and an ammo drum that's almost as big as he is. And the guy's **giant**.
-   **Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater**:
    -   The game averts this one in a cutscene. When Ocelot first uses a revolver against Snake in a gun battle, it eventually ends with the two in a standoff. Snake then lowers his gun and comments, grinning, "You don't have what it takes to kill me." Ocelot pulls the trigger several times, only to find that his revolver has run out of ammo - it holds two fewer shots than the semi-auto pistol he'd been using in their first confrontation. It is possible that this was intentional, however, as Ocelot turns out to have actually been Snake's CIA support, ADAM.
    -   In the boss fight later, he uses a second revolver to get around this. The game also goes out of the way to show you how much ammo **he** has remaining, and shooting him while he's reloading is an important tactic.
    -   In a later cutscene Ocelot is shown to be carrying **three** revolvers, apparently for juggling, and towards the end of the game he uses an attachable stock to brace a revolver against his shoulder for a long shot. The man really loves revolvers.
    -   Enemies have to swap magazines after a certain number of shots when in combat, even if they have an infinite number of mags in reserve. However, if you blow up a nearby ammo dump with high explosives, they will be left with a single magazine for their rifle and their backup pistol, leaving them to engage you with a knife if you set off an alert. The game then goes and screws this all up by letting the player unlock a gun with a drum magazine with the feeding ramp shaped like an infinity symbol, which Snake amusingly acknowledges would give him infinite ammo.
-   Averting this trope is one of the cornerstones of **Metro 2033**. Ammo is **incredibly** limited due to the nature of the setting, which is part of what makes it so tense through much of the early and mid game. On top of that, ammo is also technically currency (the good, military-grade stuff at least, although the dirty metro-made handloads could be bartered) — all of it can be used on enemies, but all of it can also be used to trade for much-needed supplies and better weapons, even if they are scratch-built improvised guns. Get used to being one of many searching every nook and crany of any given location for every useful bits you can find, and get used to being incredibly stingy with your ammo.
-   **Neverwinter Nights** and **Neverwinter Nights 2** have limited ammunition for bows, crossbows, and slings, but the ammunition limit is absurdly high, with the only practical limitation on how many shots you can take being the weight of the ammunition, and 99 arrows only weigh about a pound in the **Neverwinter Nights** world. Spellcasters, however, have significantly limited ammunition on attack spells.
-   Averted totally in **Clive Barker's Undying** with the pistol and other real-world weapons, including shotguns and dynamite. Further subverted with the Tibetan War Cannon, which has infinite power, but must be recharged.
-   **Oni**, which is very strict about ammunition limits. Though issue of different types of ammunition is solved (by having generic "ballistic cells" and "energy cells" for ballistic and energy weapons), ammunition is not only limited by the number of ammo cells available, but also by differentiating the number of shots each gun gets from a cell (a ballistic cell means 10 shots for a standard pistol, but two for the sniper rifle). This tends to make the game's hand-to-hand fighting the most reliable form of combat.
-   Completely avoided in **Operation Flashpoint** and its sequels. All guns in the game, including ones in vehicles or mounted on tripods, run out of ammunition. Reloading early moves that magazine to the end of the queue, and it's possible to end up loading that magazine again depending on how much ammo you expend and how often you reload.
-   Lucasarts' **Outlaws**. Each gun had to be reloaded, **one painful bullet at a time**.
-   Happens in the **Déjà Vu (1985)** games. Guns were opened as any container to insert rounds. It's not a gunplay-heavy game, though.
-   In **Painkiller**, you have limited ammo, but you never reload.
-   Weapons in the first **Parasite Eve** may as well have bottomless magazines, because just about every enemy drops ammo (and in larger amounts towards the end of the game) and you can find it scattered everywhere throughout the game. The game uses the same kind of ammo for handguns, rifles, shotguns, machine guns, etc. The one kind of ammo that is scarce, however, are rockets, which you'll only get a handful of throughout the game. Using the rocket launcher is only advised against very tough bosses.
-   In **Perfect Dark**, it's possible to catch a guard needing to reload his gun, but it may just be a random occurrence that happens once if he does it.
-   Subverted in **Persona 5**, where you have model guns that act like real ones in the Mental World of the Palace. But despite not having **any** actual bullets in them, you can still only fire a certain amount of ammo before you run out and have to reload. In the base game, you only had one magazine's worth of shots for each character each time you entered the Cognative World, with expendable items that could be used to reload your guns. In **Persona 5 Royal**, however, your guns automatically start each fight with a full magazine because enemies will expect the guns to be fully loaded.
-   In the **Rainbow Six** games, both you and the bad guys could run out of ammo. However, given the one-shot death nature of the game, this was unlikely to happen normally unless you made prodigious use of suppressive fire. Subverted and averted in the **Vegas** subseries. You only get unlimited ammo for your sidearm. You do have to reload, but you'll never run out spare ammunition for it. Averted in the fact that you can see and hear your teammates and enemies reload<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>, and mounted machine guns, like your sidearm, must reload but do not have a total ammo limit.
-   In one of the levels in **RC Helicopter**, the player uses a water gun attatched to their copter that drains its battery.
-   Even leaving aside the obvious aversion of this trope for the player in **Receiver** (not only are your magazines limited, you have to manually reload them yourself), the machinegun turrets only carry about fifteen rounds each. That said, trying to run them out of bullets is awfully dicey...
-   In **Red Faction**, the mooks can and do run out of ammo, at which point they will melee rush you.
-   Ammunition is a precious commodity in the various **Resident Evil** games, most notably in **Resident Evil – Code: Veronica** where there is simply not enough ammo to kill everything — fortunately, it's also the first game in the series where the knife is truly useful.
-   **Resident Evil 6**, along with the 4th and 5th games in the series, have infinite ammo as an unlockable, but it still requires you to reload when the mag is empty. It makes a lot of sense from a gameplay perspective to have reloads needed for infinite ammo, especially since it's a skill and players can match skills to help their playstyle, but also to stop players from making a powerhouse out of an automatic rifle.
-   Although characters have to reload in **Shadowrun Returns**, they never run out of ammo. It goes against the "conserve ammo" maxim, but obeying that would have made the game more cumbersome.
-   **Shadow the Hedgehog**: Guns and melee weapons have a set amount of uses before they are discarded. More ammo can be added by picking up weapons of the same type. Also played straight during the brief periods Shadow is in Chaos Mode.
-   Unlike in most other **Shin Megami Tensei** games, gun ammo in **Soul Hackers** is finite and can be depleted.
-   In **Silent Hill 3**, one of the weapons you can unlock for an Extra New Game is the Unlimited Sub Machine Gun. It's as hilariously broken as it sounds. The only downside to using the weapon is that it negatively affects the player's ranking.
-   Averted in **Soldiers of Anarchy**. **Every** single weapon in the game has limited ammunition, from pistols to tank guns. Even worse, all vehicle weapons except the Humvee M60 and Humvee Plamya grenade launcher can only be reloaded in the base between missions, by virtue of the ammo being too heavy for infantry to carry.
-   Most of the guns on **Space Station 13** are energy weapons, but security officers' tasers and the energy guns and laser rifles carried in the armory only have a handful of shots before they need to be plugged into a recharger (same with the stun baton). Only the captain's personal laser (which is a possible target for traitors to steal) has unlimited ammo, but it needs time to recharge. For projectile weapons, they need to be reloaded regularly and it can be a pain with the clunky interface: weapons with a detachable magazine or speedloader needs to have the empty magazine ejected or casings removed (by clicking on it) and the new magazine or speedloader transferred to an empty hand and THEN into the gun to reload it. The bartender's double-barrel shotgun needs both shells loaded into it one at a time (and fresh shells and spent shells look identical, so it's possible for someone to scavenge "new ammo" and find that it's already been fired), and the syringe gun available in Medbay needs to have a new syringe loaded after each shot....which has to have been loaded with whatever drug the shooter wants beforehand. A good syringe gun user will have a medical belt loaded with syringes (typically tranquilizer or poison) and a bottle or two of extra drugs in their pockets BEFORE getting into a fight.
-   Partial exception: Reavers in **Starcraft** must build their own ammo (it costs money) and have a maximum number of shots they can hold at once.
-   **Star Ruler** averts this with kinetics; when designing your starships you must take into account how long they can fire with the ammo stocks they have on board and add more ammo caches if they do not pack enough. Or you could design dedicated ammo colliers and send them with your expeditionary forces, but best hope the enemy doesn't shoot them first... Energy weapons on the other hand have no such problems, giving you a reason to put time into improving them. Later research allows you to unlock the Matter Generator, which can generate ammo; with a high enough research level you can generate more ammo than you expend, conforming to this trope again.
-   Mostly averted in several versions of an old DOS game based on the **Star Trek** franchise. Your spaceship continually generates power for its energy weapons and shields, but has only nine missile weapons and it's possible to use up energy much faster than it can be generated. Docking at a space station replenishes both energy and missiles. There is an emergency procedure to gain more energy, but this often results in **Explosive Overclocking**.
-   Averted in **Star Wars: Battlefront** and its sequel. This is actually very strange, as the source material commonly portrays most of the weapons as having unlimited ammunition, or at least very large magazines. For example, the Stormtrooper blaster rifle canonically has 100 shots per power pack and hold enough blaster gas for 500 shots before they need a refill.
-   Lampshaded in **Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords**, where one sidequest has you help out (or blow up) a Mandalorian whose blaster rifle had run out of juice. One conversation option is to mock him for leaving all his spare ammo in his (lost) backpack, whereupon he angrily asks if **you've** ever had to reload in the middle of a fight. Since the game's magazines are bottomless, he has a point.
-   In **Submarine Titans** every sub has a limit on how many torpedoes it can carry (usually 20). Fortunately, if they run out, the unit in most cases needs only to stop fighting for a few seconds, while swimming a few meters toward the player's home base to replenish them.
-   Averted in **Sundered**, where the Valkyrie Cannon—a very powerful plasma gun—has a (very) limited amount of ammo and can only be reloaded by picking up somewhat rare ammo drops (which each restore a single unit of ammo). The Bullet Transfabricator Perk allows the player to Invoke this trope in a limited fashion, as it regenerates the Cannon’s ammo, one unit at a time, in set intervals.
-   **Super Robot Wars** is very conscious about ammo. In fact, the Alt Eisen's Revolver Stake, which is shown to be shot six times every time it is used, is reloaded by a reloader afterwards. This actually explains the fact that it shoots so many times, and yet the attack can only be used six times. There are equipment, accessories, and abilities that allow ammunition-based weaponry to be used more. Kyosuke's Revolver Stake can be upped from six shots on a mission to nine or twelve by adding a Magazine, which is fair enough, or just by Kyosuke being badass.
-   When Kirby copies Inkling's Splattershot in **Super Smash Bros. Ultimate**, he'll eventually run out of the ink used as ammo. However, he can't turn into a squid to recharge like Inklings can, so he automatically lose the ability when he runs out.
-   Most units in **Supreme Commander** have infinite energy or ammunition for their guns, but tactical missile launchers, strategic missile launchers, and strategic missile submarines all need to be ordered to construct missiles. Considering how short the lifespan of most units in the game is, it's unlikely an ammunition limit for normal units would matter.
-   Inverted in **SWAT 4** where reloading is done realistically: you have a limited number of magazines, with real-life number of bullets. And each of your magazines keep the rest of their bullets if you reload prematurely, so you can just go back to a half-depleted magazine later on.
-   **System Shock** in 1994 was an early example of an FPS putting ammo limits on all guns. Reloading also isn't automatic and has to be done manually via the game's... archaic user interface, which can screw you over if you aren't keeping track. It also averts One Bullet Clips.
-   **Team Fortress 2**: Zig-zagged.
    -   The Sniper ejects a spent casing from his bolt action rifle after each shot, but is never seen loading a new bullet afterwards. However, in the promotional video "Meet the Sniper" it's shown that he actually holds a new bullet between his ring and index fingers before pulling the bolt and loads it into the barrel simultaneously alongside ejecting the old one.
    -   Though for gameplay purposes it still has a bottomless magazine as he can switch to another weapon before the reloading completes, switch back to the sniper rifle, and it will still be able to fire immediately. In fact, immediately switching back and forth right after firing a round will let him fire slightly **faster** than reloading normally (it saves slightly less than 1/5 of a second). The Flare Gun and its variants can also have the reload interrupted and fire as normal, but it can't be fired faster this way. In contrast the Huntsman and Crusader's Crossbow have actual 1-arrow/bolt magazines that must have their reloads completed without interruption before firing again.
    -   Standing next to a dispenser effectively grants infinite ammo, since it replenishes your ammo faster than you can use it up. Strangely, sentries (built by engineers, just like dispensers) have limited ammo and can only be reloaded manually. Why can't the engineer combine the two devices?
    -   Potentially the case for the Engineer's Widowmaker shotgun. It uses 30 metal per shot but you get back metal equal to the damage you deal. So a good player can in theory fire infinitely so long as they do at least 30 damage per shot.
    -   Mann vs. Machine uses this as a gameplay mechanic. You are able to upgrade the clip size of each weapon, which seems ridiculous when your 9-shot shotgun still ejects only 2 shells to reload. Robots, on the other hands, have **truly** limitless ammo but regular-sized magazines (meaning they still have to reload once they empty their clips — cue the Giant Rapid Fire variant of whatever class, truly the stuff of nightmares). Frustratingly, the special Halloween mission has Pyro bots, whose weapon draws directly from its ammo supply without reloading, taking advantage of this to shooting fire **at all times** making playing as Spy much more difficult.
    -   The Righteous Bison and Cow Mangler 5000, despite being laser weapons, must be reloaded by pumping their mechanisms
-   Averted in **TERA online** with archers — the class description states that arrows are outright magical. Not only that, the bowstring on their weapons is not even real — as in, it's a string of arcane energy.
-   In the **Total War** series, missile soldiers and siege weapons have limited ammo that can only be refilled between battles.
-   The spiritual predecessor **Total Annihilation** says that all non-nuclear-missile weapons in the game are actually energy weapons. This is quite noticeable with the long range artillery which take a big chunk of out of your energy reserves when fired.
-   Partial exception: Energy weapons in **Total Annihilation** require energy (a global resource) to fire, and some weapons require the output of multiple fusion reactors to produce enough energy for continuous fire. Missiles and projectiles are unlimited, however.
-   Averted by Sakuya Izayoi from **Touhou Project**, who can actually run out of knives (at least, according to the Word of God). She fixes this by simply recollecting them while Time Stands Still.
-   **Uncharted 2: Among Thieves** has a multiplayer booster called "Keep Firing" that lets you fit more rounds in your standard-sized magazines. During the campaign, enemies will always have unlimited ammo, though they have to reload (except for the GAU-21, which the enemies can fire endlessly). Mounted weapons actually **don't** have bottomless magazines (they generally hold 200 or so rounds), and if you activate the infinite ammo cheat, you still have to reload.
-   An odd mix of aversion and straight invocation in **Valkyria Chronicles**. Scouts, troopers and engineers have a limited amount of ammunition in their magazines, but an unlimited number of magazines. The same applies for armor-piercing shells and machine gun ammo for the tanks. But the lancers, snipers, and mortar and smoke rounds for the tanks are all explicitly in finite supply, as are grenades. One round of all expendable ammunition magically replaces itself every phase. Also, engineers appear to have an infinite supply of reloads for everyone else that they can pass along whenever they want.
-   **Vega Strike** has even some beam weapons consuming ammo. Then again — Light Ion Burster with 10,000 (!) vaporization plates per slot, Micro Driver with 5,000 balls last forever and both are common ammo in human space in case they didn't. Jackhammer (long-range laser) and Rlaan Mini Grav-thumper ammunition are much less ubiquitous.
-   In the original version of **Viper Phase 1**, special weapons avert this trope, reverting back to the infinite-use standard shot once the weapon meter empties. The "New Version" gives special weapons infinite ammo, playing this trope straight.
-   In **Wasteland**, not only is your own ammunition limited, the faster you kill gun-toting enemies, the more bullets they're likely to have left. They also have to reload if they run out and want to fire again.
-   **Warrior Kings** from Microids is one of those rare RTS games that limits your ammo for troops, it does this as the game puts especially high importance on supply - your troops can even end up starving to one hit point. This trope is played with in that your missile troops have an ammo gauge that will eventually run out but if they're near a supply cart, then they have Bottomless Magazines.
-   In **Westerado**, you will never run out of bullets, but this won't stop you from having to reload once all six chambers of a revolver are emptied. Plus, you have to reload it bullet-by-bullet.
-   The entirety of the **Wild ARMs** franchise, where characters possess limited ammunition and usually attack with other methods, such as with the gun's bayonet, to conserve ammunition (1 and 2) or have to at least spend a turn reloading after firing a few shots (3 onwards).
-   **The Wolf and the Waves**: While in human form, you can throw infinite rocks (except in the tutorial, where you run out so the game can showcase your wolf form.)
-   In **Wolfenstein: The New Order**, Those Wacky Nazis employ turret-mounted laser Gatlings, which have infinite ammo due to their being hooked into power batteries. The player can un-mount these guns and carry them around, but they'll eventually run dry and need to be returned to the mount to recharge (or else just discarded). The Humongous Mecha you use when escaping from a concentration camp plays this straight with both its laser gun **and** rocket launcher.
-   Averted in the classic **X-COM**, where other than the laser weapons, all hand-held and all craft-mounted weapons have finite magazines, soldiers and craft have limited carrying space in which to cram replacement magazines, and you have to buy, build or scavenge replacement ammunition unless you want your entire organization to run out. As if that wasn't enough, you have to fund research to develop most of the weapons and equipment you'll be using. It is inverted in the original game - any magazine still loaded into a gun at the end of a mission could only be salvaged for reuse if it was still full (loose part-full mags were still scavenged) - meaning that, when ammo was tight, it was worth going round unloading all non-laser guns that had been fired during the mission when you got down to the last alien or two. **And** you have to specify where on the paper doll the various pieces of equipment are. If you put your mags on your belt, they cost less time to reload than ones put in the leg pockets of the cargo pants.
-   The **UFO After Blank** series goes in odd directions with this. Every weapon needs to be reloaded when it runs out of ammo. However, in the case of advanced technology (and weapons based on advanced technology), you can research larger mags to allow your soldiers to shoot longer. In the second and third game, not only do you have to make sure your soldiers have enough weapons, you also have to make sure they have enough ammo by manufacturing it. If you don't keep up with the expenditure (especially in **Afterlight**, where the time spent building ammo is almost always time you could better spend on more/better weapons or armor or whathaveyou), your soldiers will quickly have to start counting their rounds...and they never get good enough to hit consistently.
-   In **XCOM: Enemy Unknown**, while your operatives won't run out of ammo on ground missions anymore, they still have a limited number of rounds per magazine and need to reload.
-   Subverted in the opening of **Xenosaga Episode 2**, where while the mecha piloted by the characters is descending onto a planet and assaulted by mooks, the giant energy gun (capable of firing through five enemies at once) runs out of energy. Of course, it is then used to stab the last enemy, ejected, and replaced by a blade weapon and a machine gun that doesn't run out ammo..
-   **Xenogears** has Billy, who is the only playable character to use guns. His ammo is limited, and has to be bought or found in chests regularly. This also extends to his Gear.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Web Animation

-   In **Madness Combat** series, the guns do run out of ammo. After that, you might expect Pistol-Whipping or the gun being thrown. Krinkels **always** makes sure to keep meticulous count of each gun's magazine capacity to defy this trope.
-   In **Monkey Wrench**, Shrike's blaster runs out of ammo at a critical moment, forcing him to try to stop the person he's chasing by throwing a roll of duct tape at them.
-   A Season 2 episode of **Red vs. Blue** subverts it hilariously, just after the Reds launch a pretty epic (though wasteful) More Dakka assault on the Blues:
    
    **Simmons:** Ah, crap, I'm out. Give me some ammunition, Grif.  
    **Grif:** Me? I don't have any extra. I'm down to one bullet!
    
    **Simmons:** Wha—? How can that be? You're the one who carries all the extra rounds into battle!
    
    **Grif:** Wait, since when?
    
    **Simmons:** Since the last staff meeting.
    
    **Grif:** We actually **talk** about stuff in those things? I just fall asleep inside my helmet.
    
    **Simmons:** Well, you missed your job assignment, and now we have no ammo.
    
    -   By Season 4, Sarge has started ordering Simmons to **also** carry ammunition into battle, as it's only expected Grif will forget and they'll then run out of ammo.
    -   This actually saves Grif's life in **Revelation**, as he once again forgets to bring extra ammo, which causes Sarge's shotgun to run dry right when Tex is pointing it in his face.

Bottomless Magazines Example in Web Original

-   Subverted in **Cereal Killer**, a short by Rocket Jump. Freddie's gun, a six-shooter, runs out of ammo after killing two goons. Since he took the gun from a robber who was holding him up and he was forced to retreat after things went south he doesn't have the ammo for the gun so no luxury of reloading. The robbers, most notably the last one, do have the ability to shoot more, but that's because their guns have a higher bullet capacity and they can reload when Freddie isn't looking.
-   Averted in **Darwin's Soldiers**. The characters spend a fair amount of time reloading and several of their enemies have been killed because they ran out of ammo.
-   Averted and subverted in **The Mercury Men**. Although The League’s zap-gun-of-choice - the **Lumiére** — resembles a modified six-shot revolver, so at first glance this trope appears to be played straight, the blueprints on their website reveal that each of the six glowing **mercury pin** bullets is actually good for 24 shots, for a total of 144 energy blasts per full reload.
-   **SCP Foundation**:

---
Bottomless Magazines Example in Western Animation

-   Averted and lampshaded in **Archer** several times. Apparently, Lana combines this with A-Team Firing enough that she earned the name "Spray and Pray" Lana, as well as having about 10 seconds of combat effectiveness with a gun. Archer also had several instances where he had to remind people that, no, his handgun does not hold more than 7 bullets and, yes, they get emptied very fast. Archer himself uses this trope to his advantage due to a preternatural ability to not only keep track of how many bullets he has fired, but how many his opponents have fired as well.
-   Hawkeye in **The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes** goes through arrows at a rapid pace and repeatedly finds himself with an empty quiver in mid-action. He usually doesn't seem to have much trouble resupplying himself **between** fights, but right in the middle of one...
-   Averted in **Code Lyoko**, in which early on, Odd is equipped with a certain amount of "Lazer Arrows", and once he's out, he's out until Jérémie restocks his arrows. Through Season 1, barely any episode went by without Odd running out of arrows at some point. Jérémie, however, is eventually able in Season 2 to upgrade Odd's virtual form, enabling his gloves to hold 10,000 arrows apiece. Played straight in "False Start", however, where Jim uses a nail gun to fight Xana's monsters, and never has to reload it.
-   Averted on the **Dungeons & Dragons (1983)** cartoon, as Hank's magical bow fired Hard Light rather than physical arrows.
-   The Avalon Arc of **Gargoyles.** Elisa empties her handgun at the Big Bad, and for the rest of the adventure is handicapped by not having more ammo for it. Several times during the arc, she pulls her gun in reflex to a threat, only to remember she's out of shots.
-   **Justice League**:
    -   In "Dark Heart", the Batplane runs out of missiles.
    -   In "Patriot Act", when Green Arrow and Speedy fight General Eiling, they run out of arrows and Green Arrow humorously steals a couple of them from Speedy's quiver.
    -   In "Destroyer", Batman runs out of Batarangs. Lex Luthor offers him a gun, but he instead resorts to hand to hand combat.
-   **Miraculous Ladybug**: While most akumas play this trope straight, the Collector is an exception. His book can absorb anything that touches it or that he touches with it, but each thing stored uses up a page, and once they're all filled he can't absorb anything else until he takes the time to clear some pages.
-   There's one **Robot Chicken** sketch, based on the fable about the scorpion and the frog, where the frog pulls out a revolver and shoots at the scorpion twice when it tries to sting him. When a gerbil on the other side asks for his help again, promising not to crawl into his anus, the frog pulls the trigger six times – four shots and two clicks. Another sketch parodies The Tortoise and the Hare with a movie-western style gunfight. The hare has enough time to empty his guns before the tortoise even reaches his. Unfortunately, bullets don't bounce off hares.
