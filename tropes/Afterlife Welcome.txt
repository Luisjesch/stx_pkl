Afterlife Welcome: 
_"For this last night I saw the heavens suddenly open, and choirs of angels descend to meet the soul of the holy Brenden; and so great and incomparable was the brightness, that in that same hour it illuminated the whole world."_

— **St. Columba**, _The Life of Columba_ by St. Adomnan

One of the ways to turn a death scene bittersweet or a clear case of Died Happily Ever After is to show other souls and/or angels joyfully meeting the character on their deathbed (or in an Afterlife Antechamber, or during their ascension to Heaven). It can be a case of Together in Death, when the character is met by their (romantically or platonically) loved ones who died earlier, but not necessarily.

A darker version involves the character being welcomed, but not to Heaven. The extreme case may be a Welcome to Hell played literally.

If the angels and/or the departed souls greet the character but reveal the latter is Only Mostly Dead and has to go back, then the trope is It Is Not Your Time.

The trope's earliest mentions are Older Than Dirt, as Ancient Egyptian texts already speak of supernatural beings meeting the soul on its journey through the otherworld.

Compare Together in Death, Nostalgia Heaven (when the character sees not just their loved ones but the places they loved), Ghost Reunion Ending (when the ghosts appear to the living), Give My Regards in the Next World (when the living send greetings to the afterlife with the dying). Contrast Barred from the Afterlife, The Nothing After Death.

Afterlife Welcome Example in Anime & Manga

-   In **Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba**, many characters are greeted by loved ones in the afterlife, mostly the heroic demon slayers but some really tragic demons are given this closure as well, even if they are about to go to hell, albeit the buddhist version where damnation isn't eternal but a cleansing process instead. Those are:
    -   Rui, the Lower-6 Kizuki demon, even after living as a murderous demon, he was just a sickly human who tragically mistook why his parents tried to kill him, and now in death with his parents Rui finally remembers they were trying to kill him and themselves in repentance for what their demon child turned out to be, and for trying to kill their own son.
    -   Kyojuro Rengoku, he valiantly dies holding off against Akaza, the Upper-3 Kizuki; his late mother, Ruka, promptly greets her son who followed the strong heroic ideals she imparted on him throughout childhood.
    -   Shinobu Kocho, she falls against Doma, the Upper-2 Kizuki, but she lingers on limbo for a while, confident Doma will be killed by her companions since the plan counted on her own sacrifice; accordingly Doma falls next, after witnessing her plan succeeding and mocking Doma, Shinobu goes to paradise as she is greeted by her entire family: her older sister Kanae and their parents.
    -   Akaza, the Upper-3 Kizuki, throughout his battle against Tanjiro and Giyu his memories as the good human Hakuji slowly resurface, that's when the efforts of his long dead fiance Koyuki gets through him, as she now can intervene through Akaza's mind, prodding him to awake as Hakuji once more, forsaking the demonic Akaza; after all that Akaza truly accepts his defeat against Tanjiro, proceeding to finish his own regenerating body off for good, reuniting now with bride Koyuki, his father-in-law Keizo and his own father, as they willingly choose to accompany Akaza to hell.
    -   Muichiro Tokito, he falls against Kokushibo the Upper-1 Kizuki, brutally giving his entire body, **literally**, to assist in defeating the demon; in the afterlife he is greeted by his late older twin Yuichiro Tokito, the elder tearfully doesn't want to accept his young brother died merely 3 years after him, thinking his life was wasted but Muichiro happily corrects Yuichiro, saying he enjoyed the time he had by being friends with great people in the Demon Slayer Corps.
    -   Gyomei Himejima, after Muzan's confirmed death he finally lays down to rest, a permanent one as Gyomei succumbs to his injuries and Demon Slayer Mark; the giant warrior is immediately greeted by all the children that died way back when Gyomei was just a monk who raised them, in the night a demon breached through their wisteria incense, through a traitor, and killed many of the children.
-   **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind**: When Abbacchio dies, the scene changes to him sitting outside a cafe and meeting a police officer. Said police officer turns out to be his old deceased partner who tells him that he's dead when he tries getting on a nearby bus to get back to the others.
-   Done heartbreakingly in the anime adaptation of **Utawarerumono** with Teoro after he managed to deliver a message that Yamayura Village was under attack. As he slumps down from his previously hidden mortal wounds, he first sees the spirit of his wife followed by the rest of the villagers before seemingly getting up and joining them, revealing that everyone are already dead and that he had lied about about them escaping before he too succumbs to his wounds.
-   At the end of **Yu-Gi-Oh!**, when Atem walks through the door to the afterlife, his contemporaries from Ancient Egypt are there to welcome him.

Afterlife Welcome Example in Comic Books

-   In issue #300 of **Cerebus the Aardvark**, after Cerebus dies, the typical heavenly light appears. He sees practically every major character from the comic in the light apparently pleased to see him, and then specifically sees his best friend Bear, his former lover Jaka, and his favorite author Ham Ernestway appearing together and beckoning him to join them. However, it turns out that this is just a lure by the YHWH to trap Cerebus' soul, and the comic ends with him being physically dragged into the light, which means he will never be able to reach God (per the...unusual religious framework the comic eventually became built on) and is essentially in hell.

Afterlife Welcome Example in Films — Animation

-   In **South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut**, Kenny receives his halo and wings from other angels at the very end.
-   **Corpse Bride**: In contrast to the dull colors and creatively oppressing land of the living, the land of the dead is incredibly vibrant and, ironically, lively, with Victor, and later Mayhew, awakening inside a bar surrounded by the land's friendly inhabitants and just having a good time drinking and partying. It's implied this only happens to people who were, at the very least, pretty okay in life, as the last we see of Lord Barkis after he dies is him being dragged out of the church and to the land of the dead, with a knife wielding Mrs. Plum menacingly saying, "New arrival" before closing the door behind her.

-   When Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel ascend to Heaven in **This Is the End**, they are greeted by Craig Robinson (who had earlier performed a Heroic Sacrifice, which earned him a place in Heaven) at the Pearly Gates.
    
    **Craig:** Welcome to Heaven, motherfuckers.
    
-   This is one of the main interpretations of the ending of **Titanic** (the other interpretations being that it is a dream or a Dying Dream): Rose dies and is welcomed in the afterlife by Jack, surrounded by everyone else she has known in her life.
-   In **The Song of Bernadette** Bernadette is dying and confides to her priest her worries that she'll never see her lady again because she "didn't suffer enough". But the lady does come for her, suffused with light and holding out her arms.

Afterlife Welcome Example in Jokes

-   A minister dies and discovers himself in a long line of souls approaching heaven. He gets into a conversation with the man ahead of him in line, who was a New York taxi driver during his life. The line moves forward slowly, and eventually the minister and the taxi driver are able to see what happens when somebody reaches the head of the line. St. Peter welcomes each person into heaven, and gives them each a robe, a pair of wings, a staff, and a new car. They also notice that the value of those items varies from person to person. Eventually, the taxi driver makes it to the head of the line. St. Peter says to him, "Welcome to heaven! Here's your silk robe and satin wings and gold staff and a new Lexus!" Then the minister goes up to St. Peter, who says, "Welcome to heaven! Here's your burlap robe and cotton wings and wooden staff and a brand new VW!" The minister says, "Wait a minute! I spent my life serving the Lord, and I don't get rewards as good as a taxi driver?" St. Peter says, "You don't understand. Here in heaven, we judge souls by results only." The minister says, "Results only? What's that supposed to mean?" St. Peter replies, "When you preached, people slept. When he (referring to the taxi driver) drove, people prayed!"

Afterlife Welcome Example in Myths & Religion

-   Buddhism: The Raigou, or Welcoming Approach, is this trope in Japanese Buddhism. It consists of the Amida Buddha and two Bodhisattva, most commonly Senju Kannon/Thousand-Armed Guanyin and Seishi/Mahasthamaprapta, descending down from The Moon (representing the Pure Land) upon a purple cloud to escort an enlightened or virtuous dead away from the impure world's suffering. The imagery for this has been used in countless works of Japanese fiction throughout history, from The Emissaries of The Moon who come to fetch Princess Kaguya towards the end of **The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter**, to Mergo's Wet Nurse descending down from The Moon at the end of **Bloodborne**.
-   Christianity:
    -   It is believed that the Virgin Mary was met on her deathbed by Jesus Christ and a choir of angels.
    -   Many Christians believe that a person on deathbed is met by their Guardian Angel (sometimes accompanied by another angel or angels), and sometimes by other souls. There is a lot of examples in the Sacred Tradition, such as: **The Life of St. Columba** describes many such occasions (for example, there is a tale of a virtuous woman whom St. Columba sees ascending to Heaven and then, about a year later, meeting her husband's soul); in **The Life of St. Anthony**, St. Anthony sees the inhabitants of Heaven welcoming the ascending soul of St. Amun.
