Blow You Away: 
All the windmills fear my might!

Elemental Power, mainly dealing with air or wind (and thus a Sub-Trope). It doesn't always mean Razor Wind, but includes the power to manipulate winds, such as _literally_ blowing the enemy away, creating tornadoes, or used as a free Flight power. Any character who uses this is almost guaranteed to land in the role of a Fragile Speedster. Sometimes, this power is a natural extension for those with Super-Speed, usually running around in circles very quickly to create a tornado. Wind users tend to be cheerful, free-spirited types. If The Hero uses wind powers, then The Lancer will often use fire. When combined with earth, it can create a sandstorm; with water, it can form a mist or _regular_ storm; and with fire comes lightning. The very lucky may have this as merely a subset of Weather Manipulation.

May overlap with (or be the in-universe justification of) ash or sound powers and deadly music. Often green, yellow, blue, purple, white or pastel. Wind from Beneath My Wings is a Subtrope. Healing Winds is another that specifically focuses on using winds to heal. Super-Breath is another stock superpower that can produce similar effects. In a Four-Temperament Ensemble, unless a Power Stereotype Flip is in effect, expect this character to be Sanguine. May also appear as part of Fire, Water, Wind.

Also, compare Spectacular Spinning.

Not to be confused with Blown Across the Room or other Guns and Gunplay Tropes.

Blow You Away Example in Anime & Manga

-   Technically, anyone with any skill in **Air Gear** since all power is based on wind, but mainly Ikki, Ringo, Agito, and Sora and Nike, after the former's Heel–Face Turn.
-   In **Arata: The Legend**, this is the primary element of Kugura's Hayagami, which is usually used to aid in his flight.
-   **Ayakashi Triangle**: Matsuri Kazamaki and the rest of his family are exorcist ninja who specialize in wind ninjutsu. Most often he uses it for offensive blasts of winds or to aid movement, but also more esoteric tasks like sucking out evil spirits possessing people's bodies.
-   Koushirou Chikuma from **Basilisk** can create small tornadoes with his breath and use them with Razor Wind effects.
-   Serpico from **Berserk** focuses more on the Razor Wind aspects of this power through his Sylph Sword, but his Sylph Cloak allows him to jump farther and higher than normal. Serpico also averts the usual Personality Powers of wind users, even commenting that the sylphs are unlike his usual reserved nature.
-   Wind is one of the four major magic attributes in **Black Clover**. The most notable user is Yuno, who often manifests his magic in the form of whirlwinds or blades. He later gains the favor of the spirit of wind Sylph, increasing the power of his Wind Magic. It's later revealed that Wind Magic is not Yuno's natural attribute, but rather that of the soul of Licht's unborn son, who died while in Tetia's womb during the massacre of the elves 500 years ago and stayed with Yuno after the elf reincarnation.
-   **Bleach**:
    -   The Big Bad of the Bount arc has wind-based powers, up to and including a **wind drill sword**.

-   In **Brave10**, Kamanosuke's elemental specialty is wind, usually using it to physically blow people away, but with some handy defensive possibilities, like defusing and blowing away grapeshot grenades.
-   **Bungou Stray Dogs** has Margaret Mitchell and her ability, Gone With the Wind, which is Exactly What It Says on the Tin.
-   The Windy card of **Cardcaptor Sakura**. By virtue of being the first card introduced and a powerful one to boot, it is essentially Sakura's signature card.
-   **A Certain Magical Index**:
    -   Vento of the Front in has the power over wind (enough to knock over buildings) among God's Right Seat, and her ability, God's Divine Punishment, deprives anyone who is hostile towards her of oxygen.
    -   When Saten briefly becomes an esper in **A Certain Scientific Railgun**, her ability turns out to have something to do with air manipulation, demonstrated by her spinning some leaves above her palm in a miniature cyclone.
    -   Kongo's "Aerohand" ability causes whatever she touches to be violently propelled away by a rocket thruster-like gust of wind. And we're not talking about small fry; her first on-screen use of it involves lobbing a truck at two helicopters, nailing both. The rest of the battle she spends running around, throwing mooks in Powered Armor like ragdolls. Though it was kinda foreshadowed by her constantly playing around with a fan. When she **really** pushes herself, she can launch things into outer space.
    -   Ouma Yamisaka wields a magic crossbow that gives him wind powers. He can use wind to launch himself through the air or create gusts that can demolish small buildings.
    -   Accelerator can control winds due to his ability to control any vector.
    -   Saiai Kinuhata can control nitrogen. Since nitrogen makes up about 70% of the atmosphere, she can generate air currents by controlling the nitrogen.

-   **Daimos** has the attack "Double Blizzard". Despite the name, it's a pair of tornadoes, not a pair of freezing blizzards.
-   **Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba**:
    -   Wind Breathing, the swordsmanship art best showcased by Sanemi Shinazugawa the Wind Hashira is suitably called as such for his sword strikes are so ridiculously strong that he can create shock waves and wind gusts, and Sanemi himself moves swiftly like the wind.
    -   Inosuke’s self taught Breathing style is an unintended Wind Breathing branch as per stated in the 1st Databook, Inosuke had no formal teaching of the art yet what he came up with as Beast Breathing has inherent similar foundations to Wind; the air vibrations Inosuke naturally feels to accurately dodge incoming attacks is the closest thing he has to Wind Breathing users, that and his final Fang Forms, 10th and 11th, are using his blades like a repelling fan and a boomerang.

-   **Doraemon: Nobita and the Windmasters** have the gang entering the Wind Village, a Small, Secluded World of wind-manipulating wizards whose citizens are trained since birth to control the flow of wind, all of them capable of creating tornadoes, gusts, and using the wind for flight, hunting, as well as menial tasks like laundry.
-   **Fairy Tail**:
    -   Erigor can create a wall of wind that can trap enemies and even make an armor out of the wind.
    -   Wendy is the adopted daughter of the Sky Dragon, and therefore the Sky Dragon Slayer. She doesn't start out with many offensive abilities, but the ones she has (and gains over the series) fit this pretty well, creating twisters and razor winds to blast people away and enhance her physical strikes.
    -   Sherria Blendy has powers that are similar to Wendy's thanks to her Sky God Slayer magic. The winds that she summons are black, but despite this and the fact that the only other God Slayers are psychotic or full of themselves, she's very kind and upbeat.
    -   Tempester's curse allows him to throw natural disasters around, including tornadoes. In fact, tornadoes seem to be his preferred attack style.

-   Fuuko Kirisawa from **Flame of Recca**, using the wind Madogu Fuujin.
-   Limdo/Uruki from **Fushigi Yuugi: Genbu Kaiden** is known as the "Merciless Wind Slasher". Guess what his signature power is. However, don't piss him off; after suffering a Heroic BSoD when his bodyguard and lifelong companion Soren died in a Heroic Sacrifice, he **turns himself into a friggin' tornado**.
-   In **Guardian Fairy Michel**, Baron the wind fairy has this power.
-   **Inukami!**: Kaoru's specialty is wind magic. Though, oddly, he invokes the "White Mountain God" to do it.

    -   Kagura uses attacks that mix this with Razor Wind.
    -   The titular character can use a hurricane attack known as Wind Scar.
    -   Miroku's **kazaana** (Windtunnel) is the inverse: a black vortex that'll suck in anything it can unless controlled by his sacred beads.
-   **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure**:
    -   The Pillar Man Wamuu from **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Battle Tendency** has an ability called the Wind Mode, which can generate mini cyclones and torrents of wind just by him twirling his barbed dreadlocks or spinning his arms. He can also form a light-bending suit of wind around his body to protect himself from the sun's rays which also provides Invisibility as a side-effect.
    -   Tama from **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable**, a cat-plant, has the Stand Stray Cat, which has the ability to manipulate air, capable of creating air bubbles strong enough to hold a person against a wall or enter their veins, blocking blood passage. This is powered by its photosynthesis; the stronger the light, the stronger the control Stray Cat has over the air.
    -   **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: JoJolion**:
        -   Kei Nijimura, whose Stand, Born This Way, creates winds as strong as a hurricane around itself. On top of that, this wind is extremely cold.
        -   Aisho Dainenjiyama has the Stand Doobie Wah!, which takes the form of a little tornado that grows in intensity with the breathing of his targets.
        -   Poor Tom, whose Stand, Ozon Baby, can manipulate the air pressure of the surrounding area, with small, closed-off areas building in air pressure, while more open areas become depressurized.
-   Otohiko from **Kamisama Kiss** is a wind god, three guesses what his powers consist of.
-   Kazuma Yagami from **Kaze no Stigma** is an incredibly powerful wind mage, partially (but not entirely) because he's one of the legendary Contractors who's formed a pact with the elemental god of wind. To put that in perspective, the members of the Kannagi Clan, including his cousin, Ayano Kannagi, are highly skilled users of fire magic because their distant **ancestor** was a Contractor with the elemental god of fire.
-   The Ougi clan, and especially its successor, Ougi Shichirou, from **Kekkaishi**: Flight — check, Razor Wind — check, creating giant tornadoes - check, and once, he reduced a small shrine to dust in an instant using his wind powers.
-   Junichi "B.J." Baba from **The Law of Ueki** is a power user, with the power to turn coins into giant whirlwinds.
-   **Lyrical Nanoha**:

-   Fuu Hououji, Magic Knight of Wind from **Magic Knight Rayearth**.
-   **Mazinger Z** has the Rust Hurricane attack, where the robot blows a wind charged with corrosive particles to disintegrate the enemy. **Great Mazinger** has the Great Typhoon, where the robot generates an incredibly strong wind, and **Mazinkaiser** has the Rust Tornado, a combination of both attacks.
-   **Moriking**: Oki Samura, the Great Purple Emperor king candidate, has powerful wings that can reduce every house on a city block to rubble should he ever flap them once at full strength.
-   **My Hero Academia** has multiple examples:
    -   Inasa Yoarashi (Hero name: Gale Force) from Shiketsu Academy, his Quirk, Whirlwind, gives him the power to manipulate varying types of wind with enough precision and strength to both tear objects from his opponents' hands without significantly affecting them or directly attack them with air blasts.
    -   Shota Aizawa/Eraserhead and Present Mic's old school friend Oboro Shirakumo (Hero name: Loud Cloud) had the Quirk, Cloud, that gave him the ability to summon and control clouds of various sizes and textures.
    -   The Super-Strength power granted by the Quirk, One For All, is strong enough to create powerful blasts of wind. This allows both All Might and Izuku Midoriya to use ranged air attacks, such as Midoriya's Delaware Smash Air Force and All Might's Detroit Smash. It also allows them to achieve Not Quite Flight by punching or kicking while in the air and allowing the momentum of the blast to propel them in the opposite direction.
    -   The movie Villain Nine from My Hero Academia: Heroes: Rising has the Quirk, Weather Manipulation, which does exactly what it says, including manipulating wind and air to do things like create tornadoes.

-   **Naruto**:
    -   There's Temari and a good percentage of the rest of the Hidden Sand Village (which is located in the Land of Wind), as well as Asuma Sarutobi, Naruto Uzumaki himself, and Danzo Shimura from the Hidden Leaf, though they all focus more on the Razor Wind aspect.
    -   There **are** more concussive wind jutsus as well, like Orochimaru and Gaara's Great Breakthrough or Kakuzu's Pressure Damage. The Tailed Beasts are capable of leveling towns and causing all sorts of natural disasters just by roaring.
    -   Might Guy's third-most and second most-powerful attacks, the Daytime Tiger and the Evening Elephant, involve him punching/kicking the air so hard that it turns into a tiger and elephant legs respectively. Unlike the other techniques mentioned above, they're not powered by chakra.
    -   In **Boruto**, Naruto's eponymous son is shown to be quite adept at wind techniques even as an Academy student.

-   Fuusuke of **Ninku** is the captain of all wind-using ninja despite only being 12.
-   **One Piece**:
    -   Franky, who can use his cyborg enhancements to fire wind with the force of a cannonball.
    -   It is speculated by fans that Dragon has an ability connected with controlling wind or weather.

-   Hayate from **Prétear**, the Leafe Knight of Wind.

-   One of the lewd Blue Gaurdians from **Rave Master** has a Super-Breath Dark Bring called "Hard Breath", which allows him to blow incredibly powerful (and stinky) gusts of wind. Power Perversion Potential ensues.
-   **Re:Zero** shows Ram. She can create blades of wind and attack her enemies in this way.
-   **Sailor Moon**: According to the artbooks, Sailor Jupiter can create hurricanes and cyclones in the manga.
-   **Saint Seiya**:
    -   Shun has his most powerful attack, the Nebula Storm, a deadly version of Nebula Stream where his cosmos swirls and combines into a destructive storm. However, he mostly uses his trusty chains in battle.
    -   Shun's brother Phoenix Ikki can create small tornadoes on fire.
    -   The Mariners' Scylla Io with his Big Tornado attack.
    -   The Spectre Wyvern Rhadamanthys. His Greatest Caution attack is a wind-type move that charges up Rhadamanthys's Cosmo to the highest point of power. It is then unleashed at a central point via two opened palms. The opponent becomes helpless as powerful, typhoon-like winds blast them into oblivion. It can take two forms: a dark energy blast, or the form of Rhadamanthys's spirit, the mythical Wyvern.
    -   Anime-only character Docrates. In his attack, Heracles Fierce Onslaught Fist, Docrates crosses, then flexes his arms, concentrating his Cosmo in his fists and causing the winds around of him to change due to the pressure. Next, he attacks with both fists, projecting two powerful blasts which affect a large area.

-   Takeda Shingen of **Sengoku Basara** is so strong, a strong enough swing from his big freaking ax has enough force to summon a giant, mook-destroying tornado on the battlefield.
-   Wind is Cure March's personal element in **Smile PreCure!**. Considering her theme color, it also doubles as Wind Is Green.
-   **Hoshin Engi**:
    -   The Hero Taikobo wields the wand-shaped paope Dashinben (God-Smacking Whip), which allows him to summon and manipulate wind, usually in the form of powerful gusts, whirlwinds, and blades of compressed wind strong enough to damage stone and dirt. It becomes even more powerful with the help of another paope and after being destroyed and reborn. Chou Koumei even states that the wind currents summoned by Dashinben are almost living creatures.
    -   Totenkun, member of the Juttenkun, wields the Spatial Paope Fukojin (Howling Winds Formation), which consists of a dimension containing nothing but an inescapable typhoon, a floating stone pillar for him to cling to in the middle, and razor-sharp nets at the bottom end of the funnel. Once victims fall inside, they'll inevitably fall towards the net and be diced. He can even increase the speed and power of the current to force his victims to fall faster to their doom.

-   Keith Goodman/Sky High from **Tiger & Bunny** has NEXT powers that allow him to control wind and float/fly.
-   This forms a major point in **Windy Tales**.

-   **Yaiba**'s Big Bad, Onimaru, wields the power of the Fujin Katana, which allows him to use tornadoes, Razor Wind, and mighty gusts of wind. Later, Yaiba himself gains this power.
-   **Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon** has Setsuna who uses a Naginata as a weapon. One of her attacks, **Senpu-jin**, creates a huge vortex of wind that sucks in enemies and causes tremendous damage. This attack can also act as a projectile attack.
    -   Yawaragi combines this power with her claw attacks, which makes them much more effective.
    -   The half-demon Futa has a magical fan that she uses to attack with wind blades to defeat her opponents.
-   Jin of **YuYu Hakusho**. His powers involve the use of wind to the point where he can even glide seamlessly and much of his strategem is diving down at the enemy like a hawk snatching his prey.

Blow You Away Example in Comic Books

-   Windfall, one of the Masters of Disaster in The DCU.

-   Breathtaker is an assassin and **Teen Titans** villain who teamed up with Circe in "The Witch and the Warrior" who uses her aerokinesis abilities almost exclusively to suffocate people.
-   Thor can project whirlwinds from his hammer, summon them naturally, or generate them with his cape. He can use these whirlwinds to carry people safely or shield them from harm.
-   Hay Lin from **W.I.T.C.H.** has this power, manifesting in high pressure wind, air bubbles to breath under water, and lifting heavy objects or even people, and, as a side effect, being the only Guardian with the ability of flight until the New Power arc (the power-up of that arc grants all Guardians the ability to fly, but Hay Lin is noted to be both faster and higher flying). By the New Power arc, her powers over air are so great she easily **imprisoned a tornado in a box small enough to stay in a pocket**.
-   **Wonder Woman (2011)**: Siracca has control over and can hear far away conversations on the winds.
-   **X-Men**:
    -   Storm uses wind powers, among her other weather-related abilities; usually, though, just to fly.

Blow You Away Example in Fan Works

-   **A Diplomatic Visit**:
    -   In the sequel **Diplomat at Large**, the Storm King utilizes wind during his battle, though it's only really mentioned once.
    -   In chapter 6 of the second sequel, **Diplomacy Through Schooling**, when Starlight explains her Cutie Mark, she tells Spike and Twilight how she got it when she used precision magic to simulate a careful breeze and free a kite from a tree.
-   **Child of the Storm**:
    -   Thor, unsurprisingly, with his precision control over weather and, indeed, weapons like Razor Wind, being noted as extraordinary.
    -   Harry later gets in on the act, managing to restrain several tornados in the second book, and — in a move straight from **The Hellequin Chronicles** — stuff a small compacted hurricane down the Arc Villains throat. Since said villain had a monstrously powerful healing factor, they were mostly fine, but they weren't really enjoying life afterwards.
-   **Destiny Intertwined**: Wind manifests in its most basic form as a strong gust of exhaled air. It does not deal much damage by itself, and is instead mostly used to keep opponents off-balance or to throw them into harder objects. Basic mastery allows its users to create longer-reaching and more controlled gusts. More extensive learning allows for the creation of localized whirlwinds and whips of air, the use of wind currents to enhance flying speed, and the ability to suck the air out of an opponent's lungs.
-   **Dungeon Keeper Ami**: In **Nero's Spell (Part 2)**, a vampire "unleashes a gust of wind" against Marda, as Nero orders with "You! Blow that troll away from the reaper!"
-   **Heart of Gold (Cardcaptor Sakura)**: Shina, the goddess of wind, can perform such feats as Razor Wind and create vacuums, the latter of which she uses to snuff out Syaoran's fire attacks and nearly suffocate him.
-   In **Keepers of the Elements**, Lindsay has this as her Element.

-   **Pokémon Wack**: In the original games, the closest thing to this trope was the Flying type. In **Wack**, there is the Wind type, which is much closer to this trope and it has moves based around manipulating air and wind to attack foes. Moves such as Whirlwind and Razor Wind have been converted from Normal-type to this type, and Tornadus' type is now Wind/Flying instead of just Flying.
-   **The Portal**: Blizzard's girlfriend, Storm, is a Wind Dragoness who can breathe mini tornadoes, one of which ends up hitting Blizzard when they first meet each other. This story also has the Wind Guardian, Nova.
-   **Pretty Cure: Magic of the Rainbow**: A literal example in "Let's Go for a Fly", in which Abigail's wind powers accidentally send Aroma flying into the air.
-   Macroburst and Terrordactyl in **Rise of the Galeforces**.
-   **Roar of the LION**: Iris's Semblance allows her to control the wind.
-   **Shadows over Meridian**: The authors interpret several incidents in canon as Jade having a wind element motif. So as a fully embraced Shadowkhan, this translates into her now having the ability to summon and attack with intense storm winds (which are also filled with paralyzing shadow energy).

-   **This Bites!**: During the climax of the Strong World arc, Vivi eats the Gust-Gust Fruit and becomes a wind-based logia, in order to give the Straw Hats an extra edge during the showdown with Shiki's forces.

Blow You Away Example in Film — Animation

-   In **The 3 Little Pigs: The Movie**, like in the original tale, Big Boss can blow away the first two pigs houses easily. Strangely (or impressively, in a way) enough, he is capable of this despite being a heavy smoker.
-   In **Frozen II**, the air/wind element is named Gale, an invisible character who playfully (or sometimes even forcefully) appears in the film among the others. It helped Iduna rescue Agnarr after they were both trapped by the wall of mist from entering the Enchanted Forest.

Blow You Away Example in Film — Live-Action

-   **Black Adam** has Maxine Hunkel/Cyclone. Her wind powers are apparently due to nanomachines.

-   **Brahmāstra: Part One – Shiva**: The Pawanastra has the ability to control the winds.
-   **The Brave Archer**: In the spin-off movie, **Brave Archer and his Mate**, Guo Jing demonstrates that he can unleash massive gales of wind from both his palms using his **chi**, which he use to great effect in the final battle. The problem however is that Guo needs nearly a full minute to charge his powers to make the gale strong enough.
-   **Buddha's Palm**: Certain martial artists with **chi** in air manipulation can summon powerful gusts of air, notably Lord Dugu (who uses his powers to... destroy a latrine) and Lord Tianzun when showing his skills.
-   **Constantine**: After telling a helpless Constantine his plan, Gabriel blows, sending him crashing through a door.

Blow You Away Example in Literature

-   In **After the Golden Age**, the superhero Breezeway is able to fly and manipulate wind.
-   **Air Awakens**: Windwalkers have powers over air, which include summoning a tornado.
-   Trisana Chandler in Tamora Pierce's **Circle of Magic** quartets has the ability to control weather, including earthquakes, heat, lightning, and wind. When traveling to a hot country, she uses her breezes to pick up rumors, cool herself, lift herself to the top of a tower, block somebody's path, etc.
-   In **Codex Alera**, everyone bonds with one or more "furies" of an element, one of which is wind. Wind furies grant flight and speed to powerful crafters, but don't work well in enclosed or underground spaces, and salt hurts them. A Knight Aeris without any significant furycrafting besides wind (such as Amara) also falls straight into Fragile Speedster territory. Windcrafting is also extremely useful for spying, too, as a windcrafter can cause the air to bend light to generate impromptu telescopes or to conceal people or objects, or to generate fields to hush out noise. In one extreme case, a team of Knights Aeris actually use their ability to bend light to create a giant magnifying glass that focuses sunlight into an impromptu Death Ray that sweeps an entire bridge clean of invading Canim.
-   **Cursed World**: after Verde trains to become a wizard, they're shown using a variety of wind based spells.
-   In Devon Monk's **Dead Iron**, Cedar's arrival at the mine is announced by dust devils that form without any wind.
-   **The Dresden Files:**
    -   Harry Dresden uses wind magic almost as often as fire magic in the early books (he begins using force magic instead in later books), maybe even more often but to less destructive effect - except in the case of the napalm-firing Renfields in **Blood Rites**. He later brings it back occasionally when he wants to move lots of small somethings rather than one big thing (this 'somethings' varying from 'a bit of dust' to 'a small horde of Little Folk'), or redirecting attacks, as he does against a Lasciel-powered Hannah Ascher.
    -   Elaine, in what is almost certainly a Shout-Out to **The Mighty Thor**, twirls one of her foci, a chain, to summon a powerful whirlwind. Harry does the same (with his staff) one book before, creating a tornado that picks up the debris of a battle and promptly slices/pulps a lot of very powerful creatures.
-   Air Masters/mages in the **Elemental Masters** series by Mercedes Lackey, the main ones being Nigel Barrett (**Reserved for the Cat**), Reginald Fenyx (**Phoenix and Ashes**), Rosalind Hawkins (**The Fire Rose**), Lionel Hawkins (**Steadfast**), and Giselle Schnittel (**From a High Tower**). Wind mages, unless they are **very** powerful, aren't much good in combat, but they **can** feed energy to fire mages, who are **excellent** at it.
-   Glinda the Good Witch of the South is said to "commands the spirits of the air" in **The Emerald City of Oz**. Most adaptations of the first book play this up:
    -   In the 1902 opera, Glinda sends frozen winds to destroy the poisoned poppies and later creates a second cyclone to send Dorothy back home. The libretto even calls her the "Mighty Ruler of Storm and Calm". Technically, Locasta, the Witch of the North, is the one to instigate both cases, but has to invoke Glinda in order to do it.
    -   In the 1939 film **The Wizard of Oz**, she forgoes a broomstick for a bubble. Added to that, the film reuses the idea of Glinda sending a snowstorm to rescue Dorothy from the poisoned poppies.
    -   In **The Wiz**, Glinda is behind the storm that sends Dorothy to Oz.
    -   In **Journey Back to Oz**, Glinda sends a second cyclone to send Dorothy back home. Possibly a coincidence, but it could be an allusion to the original opera.
    -   In **Oz the Great and Powerful**, Glinda casts spells invoking aerokinesis, specifically fog and clouds, as well as the traditional bubbles.
-   Windsingers in **The Empirium Trilogy** are able to manipulate the air and air currents through the use of their castings.
-   **The Hellequin Chronicles** has Air as one of the standard forms of Elemental Magic used by sorcerers and elementals, including the main character (who has Air and Fire as his two elements, which can be combined to make lightning - though he's well into his second millennium before he has that kind of control). Aside from the obvious, it can be used to carry and project sound, it makes its practitioners quicker and more agile, to decrease temperature by replicating the upper atmosphere (though that takes a few minutes of work), create semi-solid constructs, and some other, very unpleasant things.
-   **The Hobbit**: During his Big Entrance before the time of the book, Smaug's physical arrival at Dale and the Lonely Mountain was preceded by "a noise like a hurricane" and a "hot, dry wind" from the north which made the mountain's pines creak and crack. Implied to be Wind from Beneath My Wings specifically.
-   Aiz Wallenstein from **Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?** has a wind spell with which she can fly briefly in order to attack flying or very large enemies.
-   **Journey to the West**: The Princess, Iron Fan, who can summon massive gusts of winds and tornadoes using her enchanted fan. One story arc has the monk Tritakas and his disciples trying to convince the princess to lend her fan to them so they can extinguish a flaming mountain.
-   In **Kingdom Keepers**, Maleficent gets this added to her bag of tricks, though she uses it as a scare tactic more than anything.
-   **Merkabah Rider**: In "The Dust Devils", the Evil Sorcerer summons a minor demon which manifests as a wind that sets up a permanent dust storm around the town. He later sends it to attack the Rider, and it blasts him with cyclonic force winds. The Rider finds the body of one of the demon's previous victims who had the flesh stripped from his bones by the sand blasted by the wind.
-   **Of Fire and Stars**: Air is a common elemental Affinity. It can be used for moving things, hitting people and even kill them through sucking the air from their lungs.
-   In the first **The Paper Magician** book, the protagonist, Ceony, learns how to Fold a paper fan that magically produces gusts of wind. In her mentor's words, "Made well, it can give gusts that would embarrass a thunderstorm." She puts it to good use later.
-   The fifth and last introduced main character from Anthony Horowitz's **The Power of Five** series, Scarlett, has powers over the weather, including the wind. This first manifests itself when she unconsciously brings down an awesomely powerful hurricane onto the Necropolis and, with concentration, is able to lead her friends through it unscathed.
-   Ruahks in **The Quest of the Unaligned** have power over air and, to some degree, weather, as well as the ability to "pop" from place to place. Unfortunately, they also tend to be, well, **airheads**, having extreme trouble staying focused on any one thing and having a tendency to act on a whim without really thinking.
-   Wind- and weather-based fairies in the **Rainbow Magic** series can do this.
-   In Alexander Pope's **The Rape of the Lock**, as part of their Personality Powers, coquettes turn into airy sylphs upon death. They also have the ability to manipulate air — but not to any great effect, as Belinda barely notices the **faint breeze** on her neck that is the top sylph trying to warn her that Doom is Nigh.
-   **The Reunion With Twelve Fascinating Goddesses**: Ryura (and Tooi when contracted with her) has power over wind. Applications include creating tornadoes, Razor Wind, holding objects in mid-air, and changing the distribution of gases (removing oxygen to asphyxiate an opponent or concentrating it in preparation to cause explosions).
-   In Robert E. Howard's **Conan the Barbarian** story "The Scarlet Citadel", Pelias explains that he is calling on air spirits to form Conan's transport.
-   In **Shadow Ops**, aeromancy is one of the "legal" elemental schools of magic. The school not only allows for control of wind and flight, but it also allows the aeromancer to generate lighting and control storms.
-   In Ryuunosuke Akiyama's **A Terribly Dangerous Coat**, Ishiria and Luran can both use wind magic.
-   In **Trapped on Draconica**, the character Rana is a Dragonkin, and her Breath Weapon allows her to exhale at hurricane force.
-   In **Vampire Academy**, Kenneth, a torturer, uses air to pressure Lissa's skull, smother her, and leaving her gasping for air.
-   In **The Vazula Chronicles**, Bianca has this power. During Heath, Bianca, and Brody's expedition to Vazula in **A Kingdom Discovered**, she keeps the wind blowing in the direction of Vazula so their ship reaches the area in record time.
-   **The Wheel of Time** generally averts this even though it has an elemental system, as Air is generally used for telekinesis-like effects instead of wind effects.
-   The titular **Wind Witch** of Susan Dexter's **The Warhorse Of Esdragon** series has this power. At the climax of the book she calls up a hurricane that completely destroys the sea raiders that had been threatening them.
-   Airwitches of **The Witchlands** have this ability, though the extent of it differs from person to person. A Windwitch can create gusts of wind, "sense" through the wind, and use it to fly, while a full Airwitch is capable of this and more, up to and including summoning storms.
-   The Air Clan in **Wrong Time for Dragons** can do many things with Air magic, from flying on air currents and listening to wind whispers (which tell them what they need to know) to rending flesh from their enemies' bones with focused blasts of air. The protagonist's main opponent is the head of the Air Clan, a true master of this Element.

-   **Ring of Honor**: Attempted on the first night of **Super Card of Honor X** when Dalton Castle's attempt to pin Donovan Dijak with a sunset flip failed and The Boys futilely tried to blow Dijak over by waving fans at him. It **may** have played a factor in Castle's match with Silas Young at the previous year's **Best In The World**, however.

One of his old nicknames is the "Perfect Storm" (which will be later used for the billing of his match against Triple H at **SummerSlam 2012**) and the name origin of his F-5 Finishing Move is taken from the highest rating of the Fujita Scale, which was used for rating tornado intensity.

Blow You Away Example in Visual Novels

-   **Fate/stay night**: Saber has the Noble Phantasm "Invisible Air: Barrier of the Wind King", which shrouds her sword in a cocoon of light-bending air to conceal it from sight because the sword is Excalibur and would almost instantly reveal her identity to anyone who got a good look at it.

-   **Homestuck**:
    -   John Egbert is the Heir of Breath and, as such, is associated with and wields power over wind, but he is more of a Jack of All Stats than a Fragile Speedster. When he first develops control over his power, he generates a massive cyclone that blows out the fire covering almost an entire **planet**. After ascending to the God Tiers, John's control over wind becomes even stronger. His first trick after this is making a car fly while inside it; later on, he develops abilities such as controlling throwing weapons, evading attacks by dissolving into wind ribbons and reforming behind the opponent, and preventing animals from tracking him by scent by using the wind to dissolve and confuse his scent trail. One of his most notable use of his powers is to create a tornado so powerful that it drills into the core of a Baby Planet.
    -   Tavros Nitram was the Page of Breath, and so at least had the potential to have similar wind powers. He's never seen using them, though.

Blow You Away Example in Western Animation

-   **Avatar: The Last Airbender** has the mostly extinct Air Nomads, a highly spiritual people who were capable of "bending" the air. And not just them; their sky bison steeds were the **original** Airbenders.

        -   Tenzin, Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo are the son and grandchildren of Avatar Aang and are all airbenders, as is Aang's successor, Avatar Korra. Interestingly, in contrast to the Elemental Rock-Paper-Scissors trope, Korra has the most difficulty learning Airbending due to her Hot-Blooded nature; she has to go through hell and back before airbending for the first time near the end of Season 1.
        -   The occurrence of Harmonic Convergence at the end of Season 2 releases a mass of spiritual energy that gives airbending to a lot of random people, including Zaheer, who uses airbending in far more aggressive ways than the mostly pacifistic Air Nomads ever did. Such as the one dangerous technique long suspected by the fandom, suffocation.
        -   On the more positive side, many of these new airbenders would join Aang's descendants to became the Air Nation, the successors to the Air Nomads. This includes Kai, who first uses his abilities as a thief before becomeing one of the most devoted airbenders and a love interest for Jinora. In a bit of irony, Toph's granddaughter Opal is one of those who becomes an airbender and takes to it quite naturally.

More advanced Sky magic techniques include growing wings and making the air freezing cold.

    -   Generation 1 has the Flutter Ponies and their "Utter Flutter". It takes a whole bunch of them (maybe all) to do it, but it's pretty powerful, and magical, able to do more than simply physically blow stuff around, such as "blowing away" nasty magical effects when all else has failed. It's practically a Deus ex Machina.
    -   **My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic**:
        -   All Pegasi in seem to have this, going hand-in-hand with their ability to manage weather.

    -   **Transformers: Cybertron**:
        -   Jetfire uses his jet turbines for this.

-   Raimundo in **Xiaolin Showdown**. Despite them commonly being Fragile Speedsters, wind elements probably packs the biggest punch of all the characters in the show (literally and with regard to power). In the Final Showdown, he knocks out all the bad guys by himself (who pretty much rule the alternate timeline) once, then completely takes them down while injured, using their own evil statues, all the while surrounded by a holy glow.
