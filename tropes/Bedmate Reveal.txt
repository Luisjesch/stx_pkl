Bedmate Reveal: 
Believe it or not, alcohol did not play a role.

**Wade:** Must have been some party, though, right?  
**Sam:** You wake up in a strange bed with a strange man, and your first guess is "party"?  
**Wade:** Strange people in a strange bed sounds like a party to me, man!

Someone (usually a guy) wakes up in bed, and the audience assumes he's alone. But then either he moves or the camera pans, and we see there's someone else. Usually, it's implied that hanky-panky has just taken place, and if it hasn't, the guy will either anxiously ask for confirmation, or just assume the worst with hilarious consequences. Sometimes, it's used as a Secret Relationship reveal, occasionally by subverting the trope — the audience is shocked to see the characters together, and then further shocked when the characters themselves _aren't shocked_. A common variation is to have the guy wake up to find another guy in his bed. In that case, either he's _really_ anxious to ask for confirmation about why he's there, or he's too afraid to ask. Harem Genre loves this to death.

If the character is usually The Casanova and wouldn't be too put out to find any old stranger in his bed, the partner may be an Abhorrent Admirer.

With a little bit of tweaking this can also be a Horror Trope - say if the hapless victim rolls over in bed to find the monstrous villain in bed with them. Of course, the sexual connotations to this aren't an accident. Another variant is The Murder After, when the surprise bedmate is a freshly murdered corpse—or even part of one, particularly the head.

-   Happens in **DNA²**, when Junta finds Karin sleeping in a futon located near his bed, only in her undies plus one of his shirts.

-   In **Fairy Tail**, this has happened at least once when Lucy has gone to bed, or woken up, only to find Natsu and Happy sleeping peacefully. They never seem to understand her shock.
-   In **Fate/stay night**, Shirou awakens after the battle with Berserker to a lecture from Saber. However, they are both interrupted by a muffled, "Keep it down!"

Cue to Sousuke freaking out so loud Kaname wakes up too and comes to see what's going on.

-   **Gintama** does it twice to Gintoki. First with (only) Sa-chan who fell through his roof and landed next to him, but convinces him that they are together now and must go on a ninja mission.

-   Used dramatically rather than comically in **GUN×SWORD.** Celibate Hero Van is shown waking up after a battle, apparently alone.

-   Kougyoku from **Magi: Labyrinth of Magic** wakes after a banquet to find herself in bed with a stark naked Sinbad, and assumes the worst. As a princess, the issue is complicated by the fact that she believes her honour can only be regained through either both their deaths, or marriage, and Sinbad's reputation as a drunken womaniser means that no one believes him when he denies taking advantage of her. The situation is eventually resolved peacefully. Interestingly, in the manga Sinbad's hand is resting on Kougyoku's thigh when she wakes up, but the anime removed this detail, apparently finding it **too** suggestive.
-   Used for opposite the usual reason in **Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS**.

Then, as Nanoha wakes up and sleepily watches Fate, their bed cover twitches, and she opens it to reveal that Vivio was also asleep between them.

-   **Monster Musume**. Kimihito wakes up to find that Cute Monster Girl Miia is in bed with him, her being Snake People and thus needing a warm body to warm herself up. Unfortunately that also means her instinctive reaction to someone trying to wriggle free is to grasp him tightly in her coils. At first this only means Marshmallow Hell, but Kimihito quickly faces the prospect of being crushed to death.

    "I'm not in YOUR bed! You're in mine! How the hell did you get into my apartment?" Asuka shouted.

    Shinji woke up, opened his eyes, and was then absolutely certain that he hadn’t done either. He could not possibly have woken up, for several reasons. Number one, that he was still alive. Number two, this was exactly like other dreams he’d had in the past, so it must be one. Number three, it had to be a dream, since the likelihood of him actually being awake, alive, and having Asuka not just in his arms but also smiling in her sleep must have been astronomical. That he was in fact holding her tightly against him and looking at the impossibly beautiful smile on her sleeping face from a few inches away, pre-dawn light giving her a surreal pale glow, was so unlikely that he must still be asleep. Q.E.D.

-   The male/male trope was used seriously in the film **Mongol**, when after the drunken party, they show the sleeping Jamukha, and Temujin rises from the covers of the blanket on the other side, and joins his wife a short distance away. The reason they were sleeping under one blanket was to symbolize their blood brother status to their troops, as real brothers would share a blanket for warmth (especially since Mongolia's freezing). Still a bit odd to seen used in that context in a modern movie though.
-   **Murder by Death**. After Milo Perrier gets into bed, he looks across and sees his male chauffeur Marcel Cassette in bed with him.

    **Bond:** (Gasp!) Fancy meeting you here, Fräulein! **(A goon lunges out of the darkness and clubs Bond unconscious.)**
    
-   **Prince of Darkness** (1987) uses this to grisly effect. Though not grisly enough to keep the internet from picking it up, replacing the bedmate with anything from Lex Luthor to Arnold Schwarzenegger, King Leonidas, the Burger King and even a copy of L Ron Hubbard's Dianetics.
-   In **Shanghai Noon** Chon Wang wakes up in a tent with a splitting headache after partying with the Indians all night until he passed out.

-   There's a bit in a later John Wayne movie, **Rio Lobo**, where he wakes, after sleeping under the stars, to find the attractive young woman of their party snuggled up to him, and his arm draped over her. His startled, "Hey! What's she doing here?" is quite funny. So is his irritation that she cuddled up to him because she thought it'd be safer than with either of the young studs in their group. Occasionally during the rest of the film he sarcastically describes himself as "comfortable," because that's how she had put it.

-   In the John Carpenter film **They Live!**, the last shot in the movie has a rare awake (and **during** sex) version. The twist? The bedmate is an alien and the woman didn't know until **right now** due to mind control. This scene is both gross and hilarious. It's the slick voice coming out of the lifeless prop head that makes it funny. Every time.
-   **Ticket to Paradise**: Bitter exes David and Georgia freak out upon waking up after a drunk night out and finding themselves sharing a bed. Georgia is wearing David's clothes and David isn't wearing pants. They have to remember exactly what happened to assure themselves that they didn't do anything.

There's a similar scene a year later in the second season premiere, after Dr. Benton and his mother's physical therapist spend the entire day acting very uncomfortable around each other, barely exchanging two words. The viewer is led to believe that this awkwardness comes from them deciding not to act on the sexual tension that had developed between them, until the end of the episode finds them in bed together, revealing that they **have** in fact been carrying on an affair for several months and that the awkwardness was so that they could conceal it from their coworkers.

Actually Picard slept with a fellow female cadet, but apparently she's Not Staying for Breakfast and Q teleported into the bed just to mess with Picard. Given the dialog, it's pretty clear this was written to be funnier out of context.
    
    **Q:** Morning, darling.
    
-   **Star Trek: Voyager**:
    -   The scene is given a bit of a Continuity Nod when Q does it to Janeway (except this time the indecent proposal is more serious). Janeway is not amused. Made even funnier because Q is wearing a silly nightcap.
    -   In the episode "Non Sequitur", Harry Kim wakes up with his girlfriend on Earth. The problem is he should be stranded with his shipmates on the other side of the galaxy.

    **Colin:** I don't know.
    
-   In **Warehouse 13**, Pete and Myka wake up in bed together at the start of an episode. Naked. In Artie's bed at the Warehouse.
