A Threesome Is Hot: 
_"I have a Jules and Jim fantasy, definitely — you know, two men and a woman in love. And I remember reading in a magazine that the high you get from falling in love only lasts about four years. So with two men, you might be able to make it last eight."_

Threesomes are one of the most common sexual fantasies in Real Life, thus one that regularly shows up in fiction when writers/directors want to spice things up a bit.

However, like most sex-related tropes, Double Standard applies.

When one means a threesome, it was almost always 2 girls and 1 guy. Given that Most Writers Are Male and that threesomes are closely connected to porn, the hot threesome is almost always a lucky guy having two hot babes waiting for him in his bed. And since this is pure Fanservice, expect the girls to be bisexual and more than willing to make out in front of their male partner. In fact, it's a very rare case where the girls are _not_ bisexual. To ramp things up a bit, writers may even make the girls lesbians just to prove the attractiveness of the male lead. And when a girl isn't initially attracted to women, she will almost always give into temptation and explore this side of her sexuality, much to her boyfriend's pleasure.

However, the reverse scenario of 2 guys to 1 girl poses more of a problem, since it's seen as even more inseparably connected to porn than the other way around. So much indeed that depictions thereof were once vanishingly rare in fiction and are still uncommon to this day. At best, expect vague mentions of it. That's mostly because, due to the possible connotations attached to a woman willing to have two hot studs in her bed, few writers dare to take this scenario on. Their character just might lose audience sympathy and become disliked, if not outright hated. Moreover, Most Writers Are Male and, unlike the reverse scenario, this version is seen as a _female_ sexual fantasy with limited interest for straight men, so...yeah. In the rare cases where this variation does appear, the guys are almost never bisexual, even though Guy on Guy Is Hot for many women. Unless it's a minority show, of course.

The whole trope, when exaggerated, gives off the Broken Aesop that women _should_ be bisexual but men _mustn't_ explore this side of sexuality, mostly because male bisexuality is a much less comfortable subject for straight male viewers than female bisexuality. Add to this the belief that lesbian sex doesn't threaten a woman's femininity, but the masculinity of a man sleeping with another man may be called into question.

In fanfiction, this is often reversed, with two-guys-to-one-girl threesomes in abundance. Since most fanfiction authors are women, this makes sense.

Unisex threesomes (i.e. three women or three men) only ever show up in LGBT shows or in porn (again, including fanfiction, because we all know there's a lot of overlap there).

-   Most **Hurog** fanfics: **Laying Foundations** ends with an implied threesome, **Human Magic** has a more explicit one, all with Tisala, Ward, and Oreg, the fandom's OT3. Apparently Tisala thinks Guy on Guy Is Hot, and anyway, Oreg has such a tragic past, she can't steal Ward away from him, and heap more misery on him, can she? The Ho Yay in the original is there, the fandom takes it to the logical conclusion.
-   See the **Vikings** subversion of this trope below? Well, there is fanfic where Athelstan isn't so celibate.

    -   Taken a step further when Lauren and Kenzi try to stop her by seducing her in a doctor and nurse getup. Kenzi finds the idea gross, but recognizes it as their best chance. The fact that Bo previously **raped** Lauren makes the seduction all the more uncomfortable, and Lauren barely makes it through the ordeal. Though they stop her before they have sex, Kenzi and Lauren are deeply shaken by it, and feel "dirty" afterward.
-   **Kataang Island Adventure** has one with Aang, Katara, and Aratak. They break it off in the sequel, though.

    -   Bumblebee, Aqualad, and Speedy fully embrace being Friends with Benefits.

-   Very common in **The Avengers** fandom, mostly of the M-M-F variety. Among the more common pairings is Captain America/Iron Man/Pepper Potts, as well as Hawkeye/Black Widow/Phil Coulson. Less common variations include Bruce Banner and Tony Stark with either Potts or Cap.
-   The **ER Fanfic** The Eternal Quadrangle'' takes four characters—Kerry, Abby, Luka, and Carter—and pairs them in various duos, threesomes, and caps it off with a foursome. It's the threesome scenario that comes up most often and gets the most elaborate, graphic detail.
-   In the **Hero: The Guardian Smurf** adaptation of "The Smurf Menace", Hero's Gray Smurf counterpart is married to both Gray Smurfette and Gray Wonder at the same time, who not only love Gray Hero but also themselves.

A Threesome Is Hot Example in Literature

-   **My Dark and Fearsome Queen**: Claire jokes about joining Erik and Catie for a threeway, but Catie shoots the idea down by saying Erik can barely satisfy her. She does, however, suggest that she'd be up for the **other** kind of threesome. Especially if the guys interact with each other.

Her greatest fantasy is to have on-again/off-again lover Blomkvist join her and her husband in the bedroom, and her greatest disappointment is that he is adamant that this will not happen, him having no bisexual inclination.
-   **Knowledge Of Angels**: Palinor gets both his male and female servants to have sex with him, plus each other as he watches them.
-   **Inversions**. King Quience enjoys the attentions of a couple of buxom beauties, despite the disapproval of his female Court Physician Vossil who's in unrequited love with the king. Vossil's assistant however is just disappointed that he's not a king himself.
-   The story **Tales of the Foxtaur Clans #5: Obligation** from the Chakona Space universe heavily deconstructs the two-lesbian version, with the lesbians treating Garrek solely as a sperm injector, expecting him to perform without any fluffing or foreplay and impatient that he is, shockingly, not ready to do so, when they aren't flat-out ignoring him to concentrate on each other; he has to threaten to leave to make them behave any better, and even when he does manage to perform, it is clearly bad sex.

A Threesome Is Hot Example in Live-Action TV

-   **Batwoman (2019)**. At the start of Season 2, Tommy Elliot uses one of Alice's Latex Perfection masks to impersonate Bruce Wayne, whom he's always envied.

Alice ends up killing one of the women (and it's implied, the other as well) when she walks in on their meeting.
-   In **Bones**, a guy at the bar tries to get Brennan and Hannah into one at the end of "The Body in the Bag" — they tell him to get lost.

Before their fertile imaginations begin any more speculation, Bobby and Peter begin getting clues that the footsteps belong not to two girls, but to ... a goat!
-   **Charmed (1998)**: Downplayed in the Season 5 finale "Oh My Goddess", which sees the Charmed Ones being given goddess powers.

-   **How I Met Your Mother**: Ted meets up with an old one-night-stand (which he was too drunk to remember the details of) and her old sorority friend. He gets close to "Riding the Tricycle" as Barney calls it. Barney claims to have "ridden the tricycle" but admits later he chickened out at the last minute, as while it seems enticing on paper, the pressure on how to divide your attention during the act is intimidating. The same episode featured Barney refering to the other type of threesome\]\] negatively by calling it "The Devil's Threeway". Ted is actually implied to have gone through with it with Trudy and her friend, but we never know for sure.
-   An episode of **Coupling** focuses on two lead male characters trying to get into one of these threesomes ("It would be like a breast octopus!"), only to find out a woman is trying to get into the other kind with the two of them. The Seinfeldian Conversation of the week on threesomes pronounces that they never really happen, but a good girlfriend won't crush a man's hope that it might happen to him some day.
-   **Nip/Tuck** features several, including one for Matt with his cheerleader ex-girlfriend and her girlfriend, Christian with a mother-daughter combination, and Sean and Christian with a hooker where they mostly take turns with her.

When they finally ask her to choose between them, she cheerfully admits she couldn't sleep with one of them because they all have good qualities... Therefore she'd rather have sex with all three of them. After a moment's consideration the hicks burst out laughing and decline, knowing Wayne would kick their asses for it.
-   One **Leverage** episode has Parker stumbling in on the mark's daughter making out in a food pantry - and being invited to join in. Given later reveals in the episode, she may have invited Parker more to squick her out and get her to leave, giving her the privacy to kill the power as part of her plan to murder her father.
-   Bo, who is openly bi, has one with a married Fae couple in **Lost Girl**. The wife later reveals they have threesomes fairly often, as it keeps their century old marriage interesting.
-   **Friends**:
    -   In episode "The One Where Ross and Rachel Take a Break", Chandler and Joey once thought they might end up having sex with the same woman. When Joey asked who would go where, Chandler suggested flipping a coin:
        
        **Joey:** Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?  
        **Chandler:** Well, if you don't know that I'm not sure I want to do this with you!
        
    -   Subverted in the episode "The One That Could Have Been". Ross makes several suggestions to his wife Carol to spice up their ailing sex life and she immediately jumps on the idea of a threesome. Unfortunately for Ross, Carol is a lesbian <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>, and Ross ends up getting sidelined pretty quickly. He confesses to Joey that he got bored and made himself a sandwich when it became clear they'd forgotten about him.

-   **Motherland: Fort Salem**:
    -   During the festival of Beltane the witches participate in a dance ritual (the Reel) which matches them up with someone or someones compatible for an evening of pleasure (whatever that means to you). While it's not always sexual, it typically is. Several threesome and moresome groups walk off together at the end, most notably Abigail and her two male witch suitors. It starts off as an MFM threesome, but at Abigail's request, the guys engage in a heavy make-out session and she has to divert the attention back to her, making it an MMF example.
    -   When Tally and Gerit are caught in bed together by his wife Hilary, the latter two suggest this, but Tally is not interested, though this might have more to do with how it was suggested to her rather than the idea itself (to start, they just sprung this on her, and had staged the "Hilary walks in" scenario). Overall it seems like there's no taboo about threesomes in witch culture.
-   **Roman Empire**. Emperor Tiberius removes himself from public life to the island of Capri where he engages in decadent pleasures. Naturally this involves him watching three beautiful prostitutes have sex with each other, and at one point he invites a young Caligula in and insists that he join them so he can "learn what it is to be an emperor". When Caligula falls into debauchery, he has the inevitable Bed Full of Women.
-   In **Roswell, New Mexico** Alex, Michael and Maria have Glad-to-Be-Alive Sex after going through a near-death experience. A rare MMF example.

-   In the **Parks and Recreation** episode "Born & Raised", Ben and Tom take the local talk show host Joan Callamezzo out to lunch in order to persuade her to feature Leslie's book in her book club. While there, she gets drunk and eventually tells them what she'd like to do to both of them at the same time. Most of it is bleeped out, but what we do hear involves bending over.
-   **Vikings**:
    -   Subverted: Ragnar and Lagertha (Viking husband and wife) invite their new slave Athelstan into their bed. Being a monk, he declines and they don't force him, though they could, considering the Viking ways.

Eventually, Greg finds out that the reporter is a lesbian who's attracted to Allison and, as payback for something Jimmy did to Greg the last time the two were attracted to the same woman, tells Jimmy that she likes him. When Jimmy walks in on the reporter kissing Allison, he's amazed and thinks they're going to have a threesome.
-   In the "Crush" episode of **Buffy the Vampire Slayer**, Harmony told Spike when Drusilla comes back to him:
-   Implied in the **ER** episode "What Life?", when Doug arrives home with one of his on-again/off-again girlfriends (played by Andrea Parker), only to find **another** of his on-again/off-again girlfriends waiting for him. After they both dismiss his feeble attempts to make excuses, the scene ends with the three of them smiling at each other ...
    
    **Linda:** **\[Parker's character\]** So, let me count, that makes three, am I right?
    
    -   Dr. Simon Brenner's first scene is of him waking in bed with two women.
-   **Herman's Head**. Herman forces a reluctant Jay to attend a Sex Addicts Anonymous meeting. His reluctance disappears after hearing a Hello, Attorney! describe her constant sexual fantasies, including this trope. "Were you the bread or the meat?"

    **Jay:** **\[nervously\]** So, I'm the meat.
    
-   **Faking It** does this twice:
    -   When Karma feels like she's losing Liam because of her (fake) lesbian relationship with Amy, she suggests a threesome, figuring that Amy would drop out when it gets to the actual sex...but then **Karma** backs out after it seems Liam wants Amy more than her (which he was coached to do by a couple of bro jocks: "Always kiss the one you want less first!")
    -   Karma and Shane are competing for the same (bisexual) guy, who they take on a "thruple date" to prom under the guise of sticking it to the tyrant principal Turner. Shane then suggests the night end with a threesome. One episode ends with them all entering, then the next enters with Shane and Karma leaving. A "Rashomon"-Style set of flashbacks ensues before we know what really happened: the bisexual backed out, realizing that he was only doing it because he missed his ex.
-   **Robin of Sherwood** has an odd tendency to associate its villains with MFF threesomes. Baron de Belleme has two girlfriends who resurrect him after his death; King John, while still a Prince, is seen retiring to his chamber with two women; and in his final appearance Gulnar is accompanied by two witchy and scantily-dressed barbarian babes who are described in the credits as his "maidens", but really don't look or behave like it. On the good side, however, Nazir is rather suggestively welcomed by two women when the outlaws arrive at the Blessing festival in "Lord of the Trees". Maybe he's allowed to do it as a good guy because Muslims accept polygamy?

    -   In "Deceptive Little Parasite", three women dressed up like Detective Chloe Decker come on to Lucifer, wielding Kinky Cuffs. Lucifer has to refuse this "triple-Decker".
-   **House of Cards (US)** averts the male bisexuality avoidance of this trope: Frank, his wife Claire and Edward have a bisexual <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> threesome. Frank is the Vice President of the United States and Edward is their bodyguard.
-   **Red Dwarf**: In "Can of Worms", Cat has an Erotic Dream about being in bed with a pair of beautiful lady cats.
-   **Game of Thrones**.
    -   After his squire Podrick Payne saves his life at the Battle of Blackwater, Tyrion Lannister rewards him with four highly-experienced courtesans at Littlefinger's brothel. However it's not this scene that makes Pod a Sex God, but the fact that the prostitutes let him keep his money afterwards!
    -   Oberyn Martell and his paramour Ellaria Sand arrange a bisexual orgy at Littlefinger's brothel, though they keep being interrupted by affairs of state.
    -   In "Winterfell", Bronn has organised three prostitutes to pleasure him, but they're more interesting in complaining about the loss of their regular clients in the war than doing their job. Worse, he too is interrupted by affairs of state.
    -   Used for Fan Disservice with Theon Greyjoy. When two attractive female servants start coming on to him, he correctly assumes this is another Mind Screw by his sadistic captor. He's right, as they get Theon aroused and then Ramsay castrates him.
-   On **Third Watch**, a woman tries to defer her co-workers advances by telling him that she likes threesomes—with two **guys**. He calls her bluff upon realizing that she's deliberately trying to freak him out.
-   The scenario comes up several times in **Sex and the City**:
    -   Samantha almost has sex with two gay friends of hers who want to experience sex with a woman, but they can't go through with it—they're simply not attracted to her due to their Incompatible Orientation.
    -   Miranda isn't really interested in doing this, but answers the ad of a couple seeking a third partner to see how they'll react upon meeting her (she's been feeling undesirable). Once she's satisfied that they find her attractive, she makes up an excuse and leaves.
    -   Samantha's boyfriend Richard asks her to do threesome for his birthday. She isn't happy about it, but goes along anyway so as to please him, only for **him** to be disappointed in the whole experience—the other girl isn't a bad lover, but having fallen in love with Samantha, Richard has zero interest in her. They end up literally kicking the poor girl out of bed.
    -   Played straight when Steve goes to confront Miranda's ex Robert over smashing his TV. When Robert opens the door, we see two gorgeous women in the background, making it quite clear that he's moved on.
-   In the Mini Series **The Search For The Hillside Stranglers** (Based on a True Story of a pair of serial killers operating in late-70's Los Angeles), the younger one is seen waking up in bed with two women at one point. Though the encounter was consensual, this is clearly meant to demonstrate how depraved he is.
-   Occurs in the series **Flight of the Conchords**, when Bret and Jemaine are hanging out with two hot girls, and one of the girls propositions each of them in turn for a threesome. They're initially excited, until it turns out that the girl meant to have a threesome not with her friend, but with Bret and Jemaine together. Also hilariously discussed:
    
    **Bret:** You ever had a threesome?  
    **Jemaine:** Nearly.  
    **Bret:** What do you mean, nearly?  
    **Jemaine:** I had a twosome.  
    **Bret:** ...That's just the normal way! Yeah, I've done that. I've had a one-way and a two-way. This is my chance to have a three-way.
    
-   On **Schitt's Creek**
    -   Bisexual Jake, who is dating both Stevie and David, suggests that the three of them become a "throuple" in order to lessen the tension between them, which makes Stevie and David uncomfortable for fear of ruining their friendship. In the online video extra "The Threeway" Stevie claims to have been open to the idea of the "throuple" but not necessarily the threeway, while a skeptical David expresses offense at the term "Devil's Threeway" and strongly implies he has had a unisex threeway in the past.
    -   Jake later casually suggests a foursome between himself, Stevie, David, and Patrick, which David quickly rejects.
    -   Alexis, when discussing the idea of "throuples" with David, advises him against it based on her own past experiences with one of the partners always getting jealous.
    -   David tells Patrick he came out to his parents by bringing a male-female couple home with him from college and telling them to deal with it.
-   **Killing Eve**: Villanelle has an offscreen threesome with two random women whom she ran into (possibly a same-sex couple), and treats it with her usual casual manner after they leave when Eve's there. Also, in Season 1 she had a threesome with a couple when it was established that Villanelle Really Gets Around.
-   **Vida**: Emma meets up with the AFAB nonbinary couple Sam and Alex in a club (after she'd previously hooked up before with Sam) and they have sex (offscreen).
-   **The Wilds**: Fatin admits during a "Never Have I Ever" game that she's had sex with two guys together.
-   **Deadly Class**: Petra proposes she, Billy and Lex all get into one when stuck in lockdown, as she's aware they both find her attractive. The guys spend a long time discussing what position to use so they'll avoid anything conceivably homoerotic though, and by the time it's ready they're released, so Petra calls it off, saying that she's hungry (but really finds their feelings discomforting).
-   **The Nevers**: Pansexual Hugo is introduced while in bed with a man and woman.
-   **Betty**: Honeybear goes to bed with her girlfriend and a female bartender they like. She's unhappy when this leads to them having sex together when she's not there, as they hadn't agreed on polyamory.
-   **Control Z**: Rosita invites Ernesto and Dario for one in Season 2, though the latter is unable to perform.
-   **The L Word**: In **Generation Q** Alice and her girlfriend Nat have a threeway with Nat's ex-wife Gigi as they still have an attraction for each other.
-   **Gossip Girl (2021)**: Aki, Audrey and Max have threesomes together on more than one occasion. It's an unusual MMF bisexual version, before it evolves into a long-term trio.
-   **Twenties**: Marie and Chuck, her fiancé, are both turned on by threesomes, watching a porn video of two men with a woman as their foreplay.
-   Played with in **CSI: NY**. In "Stealing Home," the team discover that one of the Victims of the Week is a member of a committed threesome. A married couple asks another woman to join their relationship and goes so far as to have a commitment ceremony. Later, the three get bored so they add another guy, whom they call "the pinch-hitter;" he's just there to watch unless they "call him up to the plate." The original wife gets jealous of the new woman getting all the attention, so she sleeps with the new guy, steals his gun, and shoots her husband for laughing and telling her to get over it. During the investigation, Sid tells Sheldon that he'd been involved in a threesome, but that it got difficult dealing with drama from two women, so it wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Sheldon politely excuses himself before Sid can go into too much detail.
-   **The White Lotus**: Dominic makes a valiant effort at resisting Lucia's advances since he wants to get a handle on his sex addiction. When she dangles the possibility of a threesome with Mia in front of him, he folds right away.
-   **Fate: The Winx Saga** depicts a rare two boys and one girl variant. Beatrix is in some kind of thruple with Dane and Riven, and Season 2 ends with a scene of both of them pleasuring her in bed. Beatrix then directs the two of them to kiss obviously for her own pleasure.
-   **Gen V**: Emma certainly thinks so, speaking of desiring threesomes with people she's into to Marie and suggesting she does the same if at all possible.
-   **Peep Show**: Jez tells his girlfriend that a threesome with two women is his ultimate fantasy, and she surprisingly agrees to do it - confusing him because he had been trying to break up with her. He gets hyped up for it hoping the other woman will be Big Suze, but instead it's a dour High-Powered Career Woman with a foot injury who seemingly wants nothing to do with him. The whole thing ends up being a big chore for everyone including Jez, not a fantasy fulfillment.

A Threesome Is Hot Example in Pro Wrestling

-   This was the idea behind the Twins Attraction gimmick of Quebec's DM Strokes and LJ Strokes.
-   This was also the idea behind the Basham Brothers Tag Team, in their own mind. Other wrestlers disagreed since Dough and Danny were totally submissive to Shaniqua.

A Threesome Is Hot Example in Video Games

-   In **Overlord II**, the titular Overlord can solve his three mistresses' constantly bickering for his attention with a Hell-shaking foursome.
-   **Dragon Age: Origins**:
    -   Alistair excuses his acceptance of a threesome with the player character he's romancing (female only) and Isabela with "What can I say? I'm a weak, weak man." If Zevran is offered to join in too he will decline, probably due to this trope and/or to not Squick out the heterosexual Alistair.
    -   In the same scenario Leliana will insist on coming along with the player character (male or female) and Isabela in order to "keep an eye on things..." Hearing her decision will make Oghren faint. Zevran will **not** decline in this version as everyone in this scenario is bisexual.
-   **Dragon Age II**:
    -   Hawke can imply this during conversation with Anders (if pursuing a relationship with him): the third party in this instance is **Justice**. It's even lampshaded later, by Isabela.
    -   Hawke can also have a threesome with Isabela and Zevran, if she—or he—is involved with the former and the latter survived the Origins playthrough.
-   In **Mass Effect**, Shepard can suggest this as a way to solve their Love Triangle with Liara and Ashley/Kaidan. The latter doesn't go for it.
-   In **Mass Effect 3**, the Citadel DLC plays this straight. One of the party scenarios can have Female Shepard overhear a totally hammered Tali tittering about the possibility of a threesome with Fem Shep and Garrus, if you're romancing him. To the surprise of exactly no one, Tali suggests nothing of the sort when playing a Male Shepard who is romancing her, and never even mentions Garrus.
    -   If one wants to be charitable, a possible explanation for this is that she suggests the threesome because she's not interested in Female Shepard, but rather wants to get into bed with Garrus (and this is the closest she can get since Female Shepard is with him). When she's in a relationship with Male Shepard though, she's not really interested in Garrus because she already has a boyfriend and a very strong relationship with him for 2 games now.
    -   Another explanation is that it could be a nod to the original idea that Tali could be romanced by a male or female Shepard, but the option was cut from the game due to (according to rumour) Tali's voice actor being uncomfortable doing scenes of romancing another woman.
-   In **Jade Empire** it's possible for a male character to have a threesome with Dawn Star and Silk Fox. There's a bit of incest in that, since they're revealed to be cousins.
-   In **Choice of Robots**, if you make a robot with a high Empathy stat, you can eventually build a "companion robot" who might fall for you. If you invite him/her along with your partner (if you have one) to go stargazing, the companion bot will suggest a threesome in order to experience physical pleasure without breaking up the Player Character's marriage. If your choices have been right up to this point, your partner will agree. However, things get awkward after the act, when the companion bot suddenly declares his/her love for you. You can either reply in kind (which will alienate your partner) or reject him/her in one of two ways (which will alienate the companion bot and get him/her to leave for good shortly after).

-   **Homestar Runner**: In the **Strong Bad Email** "sisters", Strong Bad gets an email from "Ali" telling him that she and her sister think he's cool, and asking "Do you have a girlfriend? There is two of us." Strong Bad is intrigued ("Oh, there's **two** of them!"), but unfortunately the Tandy malfunctions and accidentally deletes the email before anything comes of it.

A Threesome Is Hot Example in Webcomics

-   Threesomes occur occasionally in **Ménage à 3** (funnily enough); they sometimes go badly, but many are treated as successful and hot, and may be regarded as Fanservice. The double standard is largely avoided; most possible permutations can and do happen. (The men involved in the M-M-F groupings are sometimes twitchy about doing anything sexual with another man involved, but may get over it.) Some fairly unambiguously "hot" occasions are listed here; see the notes on the comic's own page and under Three-Way Sex for a more complete list of occurrences.
    -   A flashback shows Zii's foursome with (male) triplets, which was certainly enthusiastic on her part.
    -   Zii gets a threesome with Sonya and Jake. The night ends badly, but no one is objecting at the start — and Jake subsequently develops an excessive taste for (mostly off-screen) group sex.
    -   Matt manages to bag two cast members (one male, one female) from Dillon's play, simultaneously.
    -   Zii is pleased to get Erik and Adrien into bed simultaneously, the first night that they all meet.
    -   The trope is played with when Amber offers Gary a threesome, and he fantasises about her and Chanelle. Unfortunately, she means with her and Dillon, which isn't to Gary's tastes.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
    -   Matt arranges a foursome with Gary, Kiley, and Peggy, but then Kiley discovers his dubious motives, dumps him, and storms out. The scene reduces to a threesome, which Matt for one refers to as hot. However, he's later shown sobbing over the loss of Kiley, suggesting that he was using the sex to block thoughts of his loss.
-   In **El Goonish Shive**, Dan likes to tease the threesome of Grace, Sarah and Tedd through Threesome Subtext in canon strips and all but explicitly confirm them being a threesome in sketchbook strips. This has resulted in sketchbook strips ranging from this to this.
-   **Grrl Power** has alien Cora proposition both Math and Hiro. The next morning indicates that they accepted.

A Threesome Is Hot Example in Western Animation

-   **Bob's Burgers**: Played with in "Two For Tina", where Tina finds herself in a Love Triangle with Josh, a kid from a fancy art school, and her usual crush Jimmy Jr. Near the end of the episode, Tina suggests that she and the boys "put the 'try' in 'triangle'," but it just makes things weird and both boys leave.
