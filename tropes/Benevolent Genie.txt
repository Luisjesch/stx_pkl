Benevolent Genie: 
You ain't never had a friend like me!

_"See all you gotta do is rub that lamp, and I'll say:  
'Mister Aladdin, sir,  
What will your pleasure be?  
Let me take your order, jot it down.'  
You ain't never had a friend like me!"_

As it turns out, not all genies are by-the-book bureaucrats who are more interested in doing exactly what you say than actually getting you what you want. Nor are they all complete jerks who seem determined to make whatever wish you utter cause suffering regardless of how well you word it. Some genies are just really cool. Maybe you helped them do something and they're giving away wishes as a legitimate reward rather than out of obligation. Maybe you're a good person at heart and the genie just can't bear to screw you over at risk of helping the bad guys. Or maybe the genie is just so nice, so subservient, or both, that they can't even conceive of granting a wish in a way that directly hurts good ol' master.

This is the Benevolent Genie, the generally lesser-used character type of the three. This is because the very existence of such a genie is a _major_ story-breaker if the genie is so powerful they can just magic problems away. One common way of adding conflict is to make the genie so ditzy that their usefulness can end up screwing things up, ultimately providing the wisher Unwanted Assistance, by limiting the number of wishes that can be made, or at least giving the genie some sort of exploitable weakness. In other cases, the source of conflict can come from the wish-maker demanding an impulsive and short-sighted wish with consequences that no amount of benevolence can prevent. Additionally, a Benevolent Genie does not actually have to be **good**, as long as the wish itself is fulfilled to the spirit of the wish - this does not stop the genie from being a jackass in other ways, and thus another common trope is to have the wish granted at a hefty cost to the wisher.

Note that the attitude of this genie can quickly revert to one of the other two if they're exploited by a character they dislike enough.

Please note that Benevolent Genies are not immune to being used by bad guys, due to being Loyal to the Position. Of course, just because they're forced to do their evil master's bidding, it doesn't mean they have to like it.

More often than not, the ultimate ending for this type of Genie tends to be its master wishing it free. Depending on the work, this sometimes makes the Genie have unlimited power or in other cases makes them normal humans.

Benevolent Genie Example in Advertising

-   This Israeli ad for RC cola grants two wishes to three friends and gives them exactly what they want. The first asks for a beautiful palace and the most beautiful girl in the world. the genie gives him both the palace and a girl. the second asks for the girl's sister and a boat and the genie grants it with ease. The third wishes for the commercial product RC cola and then quietly points to his friends hinting at the genie that he wants his friends to disappear to have everything they wished for, and the genie catches on and makes the guy's friends disappear, leaving the last guy to have the girls, the boat and the palace.

Benevolent Genie Example in Anime & Manga

-   The Goddesses from **Ah! My Goddess** run a wish-granting service to help balance karma's books, allowing someone who's been horribly unlucky but lived a good life to be rewarded with a single wish. They attempt to be as helpful as possible, though the wish-granting system itself isn't as benevolent (it operates in accordance with its own laws and doesn't cleanly fit into any of the three tropes).
-   **Dragon Ball**:
    -   The eternal dragon Shenron (Shen Long) may not be all that polite, but he grants you anything you want according to your intention, no strings attached. Unless it is beyond his power to do so, in which case he will state plainly that he cannot do it, and demand a different wish. Note however, that "benevolent" here does not mean "good": Shenron is entirely neutral in all the series conflicts, and has no qualms granting the intended wishes of evildoers. He has even been known to warn people when a wish might have consequences they didn't consider:
        -   In the Buu Saga, when Bulma tries to revive all the people killed by Majin Vegeta, Shenron asks if she really wants **all** the people back, which makes Yamcha hastily amend the wish to exclude the **really really bad** people.
        -   In **Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn**, when the dead start escaping Hell, the heroes try to wish them back into Hell, but Shenron warns that while he could do that, they would simply escape again immediately, and suggests a different wish since he's unable to fix what allowed them to escape.
        -   In **Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F'**, when Frieza's minions try to wish him back to life, Shenron warns them that Frieza will come back in the same condition he was in when he died (cut into several pieces, courtesy of Future Trunks), and makes sure they're okay with this before granting the wish.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
        -   The first time he resurrects someone on screen it's Bora, who had been buried, and while Shenron has to revive him while he's still underground he also silently gives him the strength to dig himself out.
        -   In **Dragon Ball Super**, when Mai wishes for ice cream, Shenron also gives her a mini fridge to store the ice cream she doesn't eat for later.
        -   Shenron also appears to have some degree of omniscience when it comes to wish-granting. When the heroes are discussing whether they should just wish to kill the Saiyans before they arrive, he interrupts to say he can't do it as they exceed his power. The Saiyans were arriving from space and Shenron had never left Earth or even heard of them, yet he instinctively knows that this wish won't work.
        -   Other case in point: amusingly, the usually unflappable Shenron is extremely scared of Beerus (which none of the characters had met), and he also happens to be able to grant the wish for the knowledge to bring forth the Super Saiyan God, knowledge beyond even the freaking God of Destruction.
    -   Porunga, the other wish-granting dragon from the Frieza arc of **Dragon Ball**, is even nicer, despite his rather frightening and demonic appearance. When our heroes wish for Krillin to come back to life, he repaired Krillin's body and clothes as a bonus. When our heroes wish for everyone on Earth to be resurrected after Buu killed them, he goes the extra mile and rebuilds all their cities and buildings free of charge.
    -   The manga version of **Dragon Ball Super** adds the dragon Toronbo. Many of his wishes require a hefty price to be paid, but he makes sure to throughly explain what exactly the price of a specific wish will be, so that people can decide whether or not to go through with their request.
-   In **Cheeky Angel**, the finale reveals that the Jackass Genie was a Benevolent Genie all along who granted Megumi her wish to the best of his ability and pretended to be a jackass genie to faciliate the illusion.
-   Alluka from **Hunter × Hunter** will grant anyone a wish, and done in the most beneficial way possible, to anyone who fulfills three of her requests. However, the requests vary in difficulty and expected willingness based on the scale of the previous wish. Said requests range from patting Alluka on the head to donating vital organs to her, and if someone fails to fulfill these requests, that person dies, along with a number of other acquaintances, again depending on the scale of the previous wish. A story arc revolves around Alluka, particularly the exact rules and exceptions of her wish-granting powers. (Alluka is not a Jackass Genie, as only the requests are potentially dangerous. No known wish asked of Alluka has ever been detrimental to the person who wished it.)
-   Oddly enough, Kyubey from **Puella Magi Madoka Magica** usually grants wishes to the exact spirit of the wish (the **cost** of the wish is horrible, but the wish itself is granted with no strings attached). The problem is that most people (especially at the age he recruits) either don't know what they truly want or don't think through the consequences their wish would have on them or their families, even when granted flawlessly.
    -   Case in point, when Madoka thinks her wish through, Exact Words included, Kyubey complies and executes the wish flawlessly, merely commenting on the reality-rewriting consequences in an as a matter of fact manner, even though the wish was expressly crafted to thwart Kyubey's own designs.
-   In the **It Was All for the Tuna** chapter of **Hotel** a scientist named Jun Shiozaki saves the world from the apocalypse presented in the first chapter several times over, but feels unfulfilled because all he was actually trying to do was to recreate the extinct tuna species. He was the last one to ever eat them, and feels it is his duty to bring them back. Then an Eldritch Abomination he happened to create demands to take his soul with them to their journey into the beyond. He asks them to bring the tuna back in exchange and they comply, noting that recreating an extinct species and adapting the environment to accommodate them is indeed no easy task but they owe him that much.
-   The "Angel of the Wishes" from **Only One Last Wish** by Mia Ikumi varies between this and Jackass Genie depending on what you ask: as she hates people asking to be given something they could get on their own, such a wish will be interpreted in the worst possible way, but if the wish is something they couldn't possibly achieve (such as raise the dead) she'll go out of her way to help them.
-   In **My Monster Secret** Koumoto Akane is a very old demoness who loves playing the trickster, Trickster Mentor, and tormenting her great-grandchild for fun. She will do pretty much anything for sweets. It is revealed about twenty years prior to the series start, she was friends with main character Shirihami Youko's human mother and vampire father. Youko's mom, in exchange for some candy, got Akane to always protect her then-boyfriend, Youko's dad. As the request was "Protect Shirigami," Akane sees nothing wrong with continuing to protect Youko either as she too is "Shirigami."
-   **Osananajimi wa Onnanoko ni Naare**: Sylphie is a fairy who wants to repay Shuichi for saving her by granting his wish for a cute girl Childhood Friend. The complication is Sylphie can't make a new person or change the past, so she changes his guy childhood friend Iori into a girl—over and over again, because Iori keeps changing himself back. Iori is rather displeased, but Shuichi isn't concerned so long as the transformation is reversible, thus making Sylphie a genie that's both benevolent and a major nuisance. Sylphia's mother Seraphie is a darker example with even less grasp of what Shuichi or any other human wanted. Rendering Iori perpetually naked and altering his and other's memories are perfectly acceptable means of fulfilling Shuichi's wish to Seraphie—though she is able to be talked out of them.
-   The twist in **Bakemonogatari**'s Kanbaru arc is that the Rainy Devil, despite looking like the famous cursed Monkey's Paw, is in fact **not** a Jackass Genie. Instead it ignores what the wisher claims to want and give them what they **truly** desire. For example, when Kanbaru wished to be the fastest runner in class, everyone that had picked on her for being the slowest got beaten up and couldn't run anymore. This isn't actually twisting the wish but rather that the Rainy Devil was granting her subconscious wish for revenge against the bullies.

Benevolent Genie Example in Comic Books

-   Subverted in a Mickey Mouse comic story where Mickey encounters a genie that lets him wish for infinite wishes and hangs around to guide him. Mickey seems to have a lot of trouble with Be Careful What You Wish For, but the genie is always helpful. Then it's revealed that the genie is not so much Genie in a Bottle as Sealed Evil in a Can, and though the wishes made by Mickey's friends in particular **were** rather thoughtless, he would have made sure none of the wishes worked out as hoped regardless.
-   In **Dylan Dog**, Baba Yaga is this: she wants the wisher's soul in exchange, but once the wish is made she grants it on the spot at the best of her abilities, with enough initiative to make sure they enjoy it. The specific example shown is that of a terminally ill man wishing revenge on the murderers of his family: Baba Yaga teleported him to where they were, blew up the place and made sure the murderers would be set on fire, and once the job was done she asked him if he was satisfied, and **then** demanded her payment.
-   **Eight Billion Genies**: While the genies are amoral at best given how they're happy to grant blatantly destructive wishes like turning a person into a vampire, they're never malicious about what they do. They're also happy to be consulted for context and advice up to the point that the wish is actually made, and will fulfill a wish to the full spirit of the wish rather than to the letter. But they can still act as a Literal Genie if a wish is ill-thought out, and will not care about the consequences of a wish unless they're "boring" or would deny others from making wishes.
-   The d'jinni Anhikiahl in **Poison Elves** acts as a (somewhat) Benevolent Genie for Lusiphur, but only because she feels guilty for attacking him after being freed. When Lusiphur tries the old Wishing for More Wishes trick she points out that she can be a Jackass Genie too if he doesn't keep his wishes reasonable. (It later turns out that the wishes she ended up granting weren't that problem-free either, due to certain "mandatory bylaws".)
-   The Gangreen Gang in **The Powerpuff Girls** story "I Green Of Genie" gets superpowers from a girl genie (from a magic lamp they find in a dump) which they use to overcome the girls. It looks like the girls are finished until Big Billy, who was sad because his power was being overly stinky, wishes things were back to normal.
-   In **W.I.T.C.H.**, a banshee from the world of Arkhanta is this to anyone who captures them: they have to grant them three wishes, and while they'll be jerks about it (after all, they **have** been captured) they'll grant the wishes in the spirit they were asked-or state they cannot if it's beyond their abilities. Just don't use the last wish to bind them in servitude: Ari of Arkhanta did just that with the most powerful of them all, and she twisted his most critical wish at just the right moment to leave him powerless before the Guardians, and only survived because they were trying to find a peaceful solution to the whole situation.
-   The genie in the **XXXenophile** short "Wish Fulfillment". Though he is bound by the three wishes limit, and acts as a Literal Genie when he wants to, he is very benevolent towards his "chosen" mistress. Specifically, he chose to interpret the villain's words in such a way that the heroine wasn't legally the same person as she'd been when she'd made her first three wishes and was therefore entitled to three **more** wishes. Specifically, it allowed her to get rid of the villain, then free the genie, whom she was in love with.

Benevolent Genie Example in Fairy Tales

-   **The Fisherman and his Wife** has its fisherman protagonist spare the life of a talking fish. The fish is so grateful that it offers the man **unlimited wishes**. The man consults his wife about what to wish for... which was probably inadvisable. Each time the fish grants a wish, the wife becomes increasingly greedy and power hungry, to the point where she wishes to be Queen of the **Universe**. This is the last straw for the fish and it revokes all of its gifts.
    -   Or, in another version, rather than revoking his wishes, the fish grants the final one with a clever twist: when the fisherman tells the fish that his wife wants to be like God, they are returned to destitution, as God has no need for titles or material possessions.
    -   In yet other versions, the fish would ask what the **fisherman's** wish is, and fisherman would say he wished his wife would be happy, to which the fish would make the wife happy with what she already has.
    -   In a famous Russian version, the wish that finally pushes the fish over the edge is when the wife wishes to be the ruler of the sea, and to command the fish itself.
    -   A similar fairy tale talks about a woman who lives in a vinegar bottle whose wish for a proper house is overheard by a passing fairy. Unfortunately, not only does the woman show no gratitude, but every time the fairy returns she wishes for a more prominent position in the world, until she wishes to be the Pope.
-   The original version of **Aladdin** in **Arabian Nights** has **two** genies, and they both seem to fit this trope, although they seem to be unable to disobey or harm anyone able to command them (as the lamp genie follows the evil magician loyally when he gains the lamp). The ring genie is later unable to directly help Aladdin against the magician, as he cannot undo anything his much stronger brother has done, but is still willing to give him a useful warning that helps him defeat the villain.

Benevolent Genie Example in Fan Works

-   In **II**, Eden Aspect (also known as Destiny) is an interesting version of this. While she is very much a Benevolent Genie, she's also the Big Bad of the story, a Well-Intentioned Extremist who wants the Elements of Harmony and is willing to do **anything** to get them.
-   In the **Batman**/**Ranma**/**Ah! My Goddess** crossover **A Wish for Batman**: Batman is granted a single wish; reluctantly, he wishes for "the only thing he could" — that Gotham be safe. His wish is granted, and much more: "Even though he wished for what he thought he had to, he still got what he wanted. That's what we do."
-   In **The Mermaid and the Genie**, when Ariel (**The Little Mermaid**) finds Genie (**Aladdin**) after the destruction of her collection of human things, she uses her first wish to become human, but then admits to Genie that she doesn't actually want anything else from him. In keeping with his usual attitude, when Ariel suggests that she could use her second wish to set him free, Genie advises her to wait and see how her humanity plays out rather than let her essentially waste two wishes just to set the Genie free.
-   **Madoka Magica** dōjinshi **Thanks Kyubey** is based on this premise: What if Kyubey were honest, helpful, and empathetic, more like a traditional magical mascot than the canonical Manipulative Bastard?
-   The **Invader Zim** fanfic **Gaz Dreams of Genie** has the titular genie, Azie, who grants Gaz three wishes after Gaz breaks her bottle, freeing her. While she's a little condescending to Gaz and trolls her a bit, she's mostly pretty helpful in granting Gaz's first two wishes, and tries to give her honest advice when she's carefully contemplating her last one. Though when this final wish results in her and Gaz switching lives, she smugly gives Gaz a "The Reason You Suck" Speech, informing her that it would have happened anyway because Gaz broke the bottle, but that this curse could have been avoided if she'd only made a Selfless Wish, then leaves Gaz trapped in the restored bottle.
-   The **Spider-Man** fic "Jackpot" presents Peter and Mary Jane finding a genie in an alternate post-**One More Day** world where they didn't take Mephisto's deal and Aunt May died, with Peter accidentally summoning the genie when he saves its bottle during a robbery of a museum. Not only does the genie leave a duplicate of his bottle in the museum while Spider-Man takes the original home, counting it as a favor rather than a wish as Spider-Man saved his vessel, but when Peter and Mary Jane are thinking about their three wishes the genie explains that it can answer certain questions about the afterlife and what might have been and count these questions as one wish, depending on the complexity of the questions. As a result, Peter uses one wish to ask if Aunt May's soul is happy where she is and what would have happened if he and Mary Jane had made the deal, one wish to erase all public knowledge of Spider-Man's true identity (only their true friends will remember the truth afterwards), and the third and final wish to bring Gwen Stacy back to life (with the stipulation that Gwen can stay dead if she doesn't **want** to come back).
-   **Codex Equus**: Princess Jiniri, G3 Razzaroo ascended to godhood, is the Goddess of Wishes and Miracles and Mother Goddess of the modern incarnation of genies. As such, she's this trope and wants her children to be such, and she imprisons the one who are malevolent or Jerkass Genies in their lamps with the requirement they must grant an equal number of benevolent wishes to the evil ones they did to be free.
-   In **Lady Luck's Favor**, Danny Phantom meets Desiree and wishes that she could choose which wishes she wants to grant, thus turning her from one of his villains into a kind, caring ally who's always willing to help him out when he needs it.

Benevolent Genie Example in Films — Animation

-   Disney's **Aladdin**:
    -   The Genie is the Trope Posterboy for this, even interpreting an unconscious head bob in the best possible way (as "Genie, I wish for you to save my life"). In fact, he's nice to a fault — when Jafar takes control of him late in the film, it doesn't even occur to him to try to use some Literal Genie interpretations to screw Jafar out of his wishes (for example, simply teleporting Jafar to a Death World when he wishes to be the most powerful sorcerer in the world, or making Jafar the "sultan" of some far-off barely-inhabited oasis). Fortunately, Aladdin himself thinks of a loophole and tricks Jafar into using it. The Genie doesn't even realize what Aladdin's plan is until after he already granted the wish. (Compare Eden from The Series under "Western Animation", who is smart enough to play this as a Zigzagging Trope.)
    -   The sequel **Aladdin: The Return of Jafar** shows that Genies are not required to be benevolent; Jafar is very promptly a real jerk. Genie chose to be friendly to Aladdin, showing when Aladdin was drowning he really liked Aladdin and actively **wanted** to save his life, but was limited by his own previous statements ("no more freebies"), so he took what he could get.
    -   Some of the limitations may be self-imposed. The Genie claims he can't bring people back from the dead, but implies that it's because they Came Back Wrong rather than being unable to do it. The prohibition against killing is definitely a real limitation, though; Jafar mentions in the sequel that he is unable to kill Aladdin directly.
    -   While he usually falls under the opposite trope, Jafar in the sequel does understand how to cut a deal with Abis Mal. After using the Jackass method to coerce the bandit into cooperating, but once they've apparently won, he gives Abis Mal all the treasure he could possibly want and more without a wish, so that Abis Mal could free him with his final wish. Abis Mal **still** manages to screw that up out of suspicion, but Jafar did honestly try.
-   In **DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp**, the genie is a curious but good-natured fellow who even tells the nephews that he is "eternally grateful" when they first free him. He takes no pleasure in granting wishes that are liable to cause trouble or are otherwise harmful, but he can't resist for long before he is somehow compelled into bringing it into existence anyway. He even warns them early on to try and keep the wishes relatively subtle, as flashy displays of his magic invariably cause trouble. Not least of which is a former master of his, an immortal sorcerer who has a talisman that gives him limitless wishes and a very cruel nature. Two other wishes the genie was forced to grant him included sinking Atlantis back when it was a prime vacation spot after the sorcerer couldn't get a reservation, and causing the eruption of Mount Vesuvius (in his words, "Poor Pompeii! Vesuvius wouldn't have blown its top if Merlock hadn't blown his!"). The genie openly weeps when recounting these facts.

Benevolent Genie Example in Films — Live-Action

-   The 1992 comedy **Miracle Beach** shows a coastal town semi-homeless bum named Scotty who lives in a garage and spends most of his day hanging around a beach until he meets a beautiful blonde genie appropriately named Jeannie who helps turn his life around for the better. Jeannie is quite generous for a genie, as she does not set any quotas on how many wishes Scotty may grant but she hesitates to pair him up with another woman because she has feelings for him (the viewer could tell she wanted to be his mate since the beginning).
-   Fakrash al-Amash (Burl Ives) in 1964's **The Brass Bottle** is a djinn who is so grateful to architect Harold Ventimore (Tony Randall) for freeing him from his bottle, that he is continually making extravagant gifts to him — all of which only complicate Ventimore's life and make him miserable. Barbara Eden is featured in this film, though not as a djinniyah.
-   Josephus in **Bernard and the Genie** befriends the much-harassed former art dealer Bernard and grants him **unlimited** wishes. Although they as expected mess things up at first (Bernard gets arrested for having the Mona Lisa on his wall, and stabbing a policeman with a sword), Josephus later reveals that he can just turn back the clock, and they set everything straight. They then decide that since it's Christmas, they should make a few Christmas miracles and spread good cheer. (This includes getting back at Bernard's cheating ex-girlfriend and ex-best friend, as well as his ex-boss, who is played by Rowan Atkinson.) Josephus only became one after the wish "I wish you would stop trying to kill me", however. Before that he was more "pissed-off former thief with a large scimitar who had been trapped in a bottle for thousands of years."
-   The titular genie in **Kazaam** (played by Shaq, of all people) turns out to be a good friend to Max far beyond the typical master-genie relationship. When prompted by Max, Kazaam reveals that his greatest wish is to be free, a djinn (whom Kazaam considers a myth). After the Big Bad kills Max to claim Kazaam, Kazaam does the impossible, kills his new master, and revives Max (despite claiming earlier that he can't bring the dead back to life). In return, Max uses his final wish to free Kazaam.
-   In the Italian movie **Superfantagenio** the genie, played by Bud Spencer, not only instructs his master on how to get the best of his wishes, but when temporarily Brought Down to Normal (as his powers need to recharge at night) he decides to protect him from a group of gangsters with his bare hands (this being a Bud Spencer character, he makes short work of them), and when a villain attempts to take his lamp and use it to Take Over the World he's willing to sink it in the Bermuda Triangle (and sentence himself to stay imprisoned there forever) rather than have his powers misused.
    -   He still insists to rehearse throughly the rules every time he interacts with his young master, explaining hom how to phrase exactly what he needs, telling him clearly that unless he asks for things in the proper way he'll be unable to provide. The difference between him and a Literal Genie is that he actually corrects his master each time giving him a **redo** every time he goofs or is unable to have him act properly (when he asks the Genie to let him fight a bully and the bully beats him, the Genie asks him to wish again to let him **beat** the bully, and he does. Later, when he sees some mooks acting, he waits for his master to return, and then asks him to order him to stop the mooks)
-   Another example of benevolence leading to jackassery is found in the German 2010 version of the Grimm tale "Das blaue Licht". The Genie (smoking pipe, not lamp, but it amounts to the same) evidently must have worked at a hotline in an earlier life and bombards the wisher with loads of trifle questions and pointless alternatives concerning his wish, peppering the deal with snarky asides about stupid wishers. Can get very annoying, for example if you are about to be hanged.
-   The Genie in **Aladdin (2019)**, the live-action remake, takes the trope even further: he explicitly shows Aladdin how vague wording could cause problems ("Make me a prince" could be interpreted as "create a prince for me"), then goes out of his way to coach Aladdin on how to woo Jasmine (although part of this is so Genie can end up with Dalia) even though Aladdin did not specify that as part of his wish. It's also zig-zagged in regards to Jafar: Genie grants his wishes literally, but not maliciously, so there are blind spots in the wish (i.e. becoming sultan doesn't mean the people have to obey you). He also catches on to Aladdin's gambit in the final act, so that wish is definitely done with malice.
-   **My Darling Genie**, a Shaw Brothers film about a genie summoned from an umbrella. The first thing the protagonist (played by Derek Yee) releases her is heal a young boy who was left wheelchair-bound after an accident. She then accompanies him through life and befriends him. She states all she won’t do is have sex with him.

Benevolent Genie Example in Literature

-   **Starik Khottabych** ("**Old Man Hottabych**") by Lazar Lagin is about a Soviet boy in the 1930s who accidentally frees the genie Hassan Abdul-rahman ibn Khattab (and disrespectfully dubs him "Hottabych"). The book is about Hottabych adapting to Soviet everyday life while trying to "serve" his master. Later in the book, Hottabych finds his Aloof Big Brother, a classical malevolent genie, who eventually gets sealed away again. It should be noted that Hottabych's brother wasn't always malevolent. However, the centuries of being trapped in a jug led him to change his mindset from "I will grant the person who frees me 3 wishes" to "I will kill the person who frees me in the manner he chooses".
-   There's a short story where the main character is so stupid that he uses up all three of his wishes on the rhetorical style of literal wishing, because he thinks he's talking not to a genie, but to some annoying guy who came into his house for no reason. Two of the wishes really did go to waste, but his second wish was "I wish you jerks would just stop giving me a hard time." After his third wish, he realizes that he just blew his chance to make some good wishes. But the next morning, he discovers that all the bad drivers on the freeway are staying out of his way, his boss is uncharacteristically understanding of his difficulties, and the IRS has sent him a letter saying that he is now exempt from all the duties of a taxpayer. His life promises to be much easier with this wish granted.
-   Isaac Asimov's **Azazel** is a demon (or, in some stories, a hyper-tech alien) who grants wishes to his master's friends. He really does do his best, but virtually all of his wishes end up backfiring horribly anyway.
-   In Isaac Bashevis Singer's book for children, **A Tale of Three Wishes,** three children go out on the night of Rosh Hashanah because they've heard that Heaven opens its doors then—and anyone who sees the doors open will be granted one wish. One of the boys wants to be as rich as King Solomon; the second boy wants to be as wise as the Talmudic scholar, Moses Maimonides; and the little sister of the boy who wants to be rich wants to be as beautiful as Queen Esther. Each wish gets wasted—but, when the kids grow up, the boy who wanted to be rich becomes a hard-working and extremely wealthy businessman called "a modern Solomon"; the boy who wanted to be wise becomes a Talmudic scholar known as "the Maimonides of our time"; and the little girl who wanted to be beautiful spends all her time helping her people, to the point where everyone says she's as lovely and as kind as Queen Esther.
-   **As You Wish** by Jackson Pearce is about a genie (known as jinn in their universe) who appears to a random girl, Kayla, and they fall in love with each other. The jinn (who has no name) is supposed to be more of a Literal Genie, but he falls in love with her and ends up being nice to her.
-   Somer, from **A Fantasy Attraction**, embodies this trope quite nicely, being, according to him, a guardian genie; and does in fact spend most of the story helping and protecting the other characters.
-   Near the end of **The Seventh Tower**, Tal meets a being known as the Old Khamsoul, which is some kind of sentient whirlwind that is said to be an oracle: you may ask it one question, which it will answer truthfully. Tal asks several questions, each of which the Old Khamsoul says don't count because, really, if Tal thought about them a bit, he already knew the answers. Ultimately Tal decides that he will come back one day when he has found a worthy question, and the Old Khamsoul replies that it will be waiting.
-   An interesting version in Mikhail Akhmanov's **Earth Shadow**. As Dick finds out after returning to Earth That Was, the supposedly apocryphal story of the discoverer of interstellar travel about an entity that naturally evolved on the Internet, whom he dubbed "Genie", is actually true. The Genie managed to survive the scattering of humanity across the galaxy (which, naturally, resulted in the destruction of the being's natural habitat, the Internet) by downloading itself into a large memory storage unit on the Moon. While the Genie almost never interacts with humans, he did help the first man who found him and gave the man one question to ask. The man asks "How can I save humanity?" The Genie provides him the answer in the form of the Ramp, a method of creating wormholes between any two points. In the end, Dick convinces the Genie to deactivate the generator that creates a No Warping Zone throughout the Solar System.
-   **The Master Key**: The Demon of Electricity, who gives Rob stupendous inventions that could solve all human problems with no catch, and does what he asks, even including pressing the Reset Button.
-   Nate the snake in **The Longest Joke in the World**. When the protagonist, dying of thirst and unaware that he's just stumbled on a wish-granter, says he wants to not be thirsty anymore, the snake makes it so that he can survive on much less water than a normal human needs. Then he gladly explains all about himself and the nature of his power, gives good advice on what else to wish for, and directs him back to civilization for free.
-   In the ending of **Finn Family Moomintroll**, the Hobgoblin/Magician decides to grant everyone a wish — he has some special power to do that, so that he can grant just about any wish to others even though he can't do the same things for himself. Most of the people present end up satisfied with their wish, with the only exception being Snorkmaiden, and even then, that's because she didn't think about the consequences of her wish (to have her face look like the one on a beautiful wooden figurehead they had found earlier), which made it impossible to grant it in a way that would make her happy. Even then, the Hobgoblin asks if she's sure that's what she wants before granting the wish, and then allows her brother Snork (or Moomintroll in the 90's anime adaptation) to use his own wish to undo it when Snorkmaiden is horrified at the results.

Benevolent Genie Example in Live-Action TV

-   **Beetleborgs**: Despite not being an actual genie, Flabber fits this trope, as he still grants wishes. When the main characters wished to become Beetleborgs, he wrongly interpreted their wish twice, but corrected himself afterwards.
-   The eponymous Magical Girlfriend of **I Dream of Jeannie** tries to be as useful as she could, although her attempts rarely go particularly well, partly because she's a bit scatterbrained, and partly because she's from a time and place so different than the 20th century US, she might just as well be an alien. It doesn't help that she is easily jealous, either.
-   In **The 10th Kingdom**, Snow White is one of these.
    
    **Snow White:** You may ask for one wish, and I will try and grant it. But be sure to ask for the right thing.  
    **Virginia:** Okay, I wish... I wish that Dad's bad luck was over. Oh! And that his back wasn't broken anymore.  
    **Snow White:** Strictly speaking, that's two wishes. But it's done.
    
-   In **Bernard And The Genie**, Lenny Henry plays one of these to Alan Cumming's Bernard.
-   **The Twilight Zone (1959)**: The episode "I Dream of Genie" features a genie who can only grant one wish and so encourages the man who finds him to carefully consider what he really wants. The hero rejects various ordinary wishes for wealth, love and power, and finally wishes to become a Benevolent Genie himself, one who can grant three wishes and arranges for his lamp to be found by the homeless and needy.
-   **You Wish** features a genie who is accidentally freed by a single mother with two kids. The mother rejects various ordinary wishes for wealth, love and power, and through the short series of only 13 episodes mother, genie, and children learn to function as a family helping each other become better "people".
-   **Kamen Rider Den-O**:
    -   The heroic Imagin, who choose of their own free will to help the Kamen Riders battle their evil brethren, and do so **without** granting wishes — since wish-granting opens a portal to the past, which lets evil Imagin wreak havok. The few times they do grant wishes, it's always for a noble purpose, like Gentle Giant Kintaros turning Ryotaro's New Year's Resolution into a wish so he could pull a Big Damn Heroes moment.
    -   Kintaros deserves special mention because he started off contracted to a young man who wanted To Be a Master of karate; Kintaros decided to fulfill the wish by helping him train (the fact that Kin-chan trained his contractor in **Sumo** rather than karate owes more to his being ditzy rather than malice), which completely surprised and confused the heroes. He does eventually go back in time, but only to protect his contractor from a more traditional Imagin, and is mortally wounded in the process. Ryotaro recognizes Kintaros' noble nature and offers a contract in order to save his life, which results in his joining the Den-O team.
-   The Japanese Super Sentai series **Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger** featured a genie named Djinn who was found by a group of children, and used to grant a number of simple and childish but otherwise harmless wishes. Djinn truly seems to enjoy granting the wishes of children, however, and plays with them happily until the witch, Bandora, tries to turn the genie's formidable power to her side.
-   Zig-zagged with the genie Thunderbolt in **Stargirl (2020)**. Thunderbolt as a person is a completely benevolent genie that is nothing but helpful. His ability to grant wishes, on the other hand, falls more under Literal Genie, such as granting a request to be taller by elevating the person without actually physically altering them. Thunderbolt isn't strictly doing it on purpose, though he does have some control over the execution, but the intent and confidence behind the wish seem to drive the outcome just as much as the literal wording.

Benevolent Genie Example in Pinballs

-   The benevolent **jinn** who helps the player Rescue The Princess in **Tales of the Arabian Nights**.
-   The titular character of **Jinni Zeala,** who just wants to help the player **PARTY!**
-   The main character in **Genie** playfully teases the wizard who summoned her.

Benevolent Genie Example in Puppet Shows

-   While not a genie, in **Muppet Classic Theater** Gonzo plays a wish-granting satyr in the story of "King Midas". He initially offers King Midas a wish in exchange for his life, and at the end of the story, after Queen Midas admits that there are more important things than gold, he decides, since they were such good sports, to grant them one more wish for free.
-   **Fraggle Rock** has two episodes in which Wembley encounters a wish-fulfilling creature; while the first one is a Jackass Genie who initially refuses to grant any wishes, the second one (a spider-fly that Wembley rescued and turned out to be a sort-of Fairy Godmother) is a clear example of this trope, even stopping Wembley from wasting his one wish on trivialities.

Benevolent Genie Example in Roleplay

-   **Dorf Quest** has Aldwin seeking out a djinn and wishing for Goldmoon to be brought back to life, which surprisingly turns out well with no negative side effects (at least, none that were the djinn's fault). It may have helped that Aldwin had the foresight to ask the djinn what it might want in return - and his dialogue even implies that it would have done so even without payment.

---
Benevolent Genie Example in Tabletop Games

-   In **Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine**, the Wish-Granting Engine itself appears as an incarnate spirit (either Lilimund Cartaign or Laodemus Schwan, depending on personal take) and is active as a masked heroic adventurer; they are also willing to do favours for characters, such as serving as a substitute parent to get the Magical Detective enrolled at School. It's only the actual **wishes** that are prone to backfiring, and even then that depends on how true a wish is to Chuubo's own spirit; wishing for a best friend, for example, has had no disastrous side effects at all, while ice-cream-related wishes tend to go to hell quite frequently.
-   The **Dungeons & Dragons** spell "Wish" is more famous for the opposite trope, but the spell description does instruct the Game Master to treat it this way if the request is within reason, and lists several specific effects, such as duplicating spells of 8th level and below or granting 10 creatures resistance to a chosen damage type, that are guaranteed to work without issue.
    -   While their wicked efreet cousins are Literal Genies at best, the rare noble djinn are quite genial and Good-aligned. Though their Wishes still might have limits, they generally won't try to screw the wisher over unless the wisher's done something to majorly piss them off.
    -   Pazuzu's an odd case of this. While he is a demon prince and his wishes are the result of a Deal with the Devil, he grants wishes how the wisher wants them and takes care no evil comes from the wish itself. The trick is that each time you summon him for a wish, the price gets higher (and more corrupting), and he wouldn't get any repeat summons if he screwed over everyone who did it once.
    -   Some treatments of the clerical counterpart to "Wish", "Miracle", suggests treating it as this — since it is granted by a being who to at least **some** degree has an interest in your success (the deity you are a cleric of), it is more likely to look to intent rather than exact wording and more likely to outright fail to do anything rather than provide some form of undesirable partial or cruelly interpreted result if you ask for something unreasonable.
    -   5th Edition's Genie Pact Warlocks can make Wishes to their patron at high enough levels; while limited in power, they're exclusively effects that won't screw you over (spell replication) and granted at a rate of one every few days (4 at a maximum). After all, even for the avaricious Dao and tyrannical Efreet it wouldn't do to screw over a valuable asset like the warlock in question.

Benevolent Genie Example in Toys

-   The **LEGO** Genie Girl minifigure his against the rules and makes her lamps holder rephrase their wishes so they don't end up with superpowers and the proportional speed of a slug or wish for a castle and get one that's underwater.

---
Benevolent Genie Example in Video Games

-   In **King's Quest VI**, evil Vizier Abdul Alhazred has a genie named Shamir who keeps trying to get you to kill yourself in creative ways. It's explained that genies don't have personalities of their own, rather they reflect the personality of their master. This makes them "benevolent" in the sense that they can't subvert their master's wishes. Once you capture Shamir's lamp, he's relieved that he no longer has to work for a villain.
-   A similar genie appears in **Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3** when you fight Captain Syrup in the end and she unleashes her genie to battle. When he's on her side he seems pretty aggressive, but when you get his lamp in the end he seems like a pretty nice guy who will give you, depending on how much money you accumulated in the game, your own "castle" that ranges from a bird house, a tree trunk, a log cabin, a pagoda, a castle, and **your own planet**.
-   Shara in **Sonic and the Secret Rings**. She has unlimited wishes but she's limited in power and certainly can't do anything against the all mighty (3-wish) granter and villain Erazor.
    -   Despite being the Big Bad, Erazor unwillingly acts as a Benevolent Genie in the end. Erazor's triumph is completely undone when Sonic reveals that he has **Erazor's lamp** and forces him to fix everything.
-   Solmyr in **Heroes of Might and Magic III** to some extent. He was so grateful to the man who freed him from a genie bottle that he swore himself to his service for the rest of his life (for all eternity, since the man happened to be immortal). Although in the next game Solmyr's master turned crazy/evil. But HoMM IV takes place on a different planet and Solmyr had promised to be in his service "as long as he walks the earth" or some-such. So he finally had a loophole to escape his master. Different world, no longer bound.
-   **Kingdom Hearts**:
    -   Following the movie **Aladdin**, Genie is very much a benevolent genie in **Kingdom Hearts**. During the first boss fight against Jafar, although the Genie is forced to serve Jafar and attack Sora's party, his attacks are generally very weak, he usually says, "I'm sorry, Al," and "Get out of the way!" before attacking, and sometimes after an attack will generate health balls for the party to pick up, increasing their health points. Later, after Aladdin wishes for Genie's freedom, Genie agrees to travel with Sora to help find Jasmine. He even comments that, although he is no longer required to grant Aladdin's wishes, he's quite happy to do him a favor.
    -   In **Kingdom Hearts II**, Genie is actually somewhat disappointed that Aladdin always asks such simple favors from him when he would be happy to do much more, like dispelling "one measly little sandstorm," and putting Agrabah back "exactly the way it was" after Jafar's defeat, when Genie wants to make improvements like adding swimming pools.
-   The titular protagonist of **Shantae**. While she's only a half-genie, she's also an Action Girl who has defended her home of Scuttle Town from various evil threats, most notably the pirate queen Risky Boots, multiple times.
-   **RPG Shooter: Starwish** has a bit of examination of wishes and genies. However, the Wishing Star herself will go above and beyond the call of duty to be benevolent in her last act. She'll give you what you want, likely far beyond the wording of a single wish, and usually do what she can to help you finish off your chosen Romance Sidequest. If you can already accomplish the wish yourself, she'll say so, explain how, and then give you another gift for free. And in one ending, she goes out of her way to give **everyone on your crew** their wishes.
-   While he usually acts as a Jackass Genie, Calypso from **Twisted Metal** **can** act like this, such as fulfilling Mortimer's wish to be able to return to his grave and sleep again in **Head-On** with no strings attached. Endings where a character wishes for Revenge against someone who screwed them over are also usually granted by him without screwing the winner over.

Benevolent Genie Example in Web Comics

-   Ship of **Ship In A Bottle** is a good example. Even when she disagrees with her master, she makes sure to help him as needed and grants wishes as accurately as possible. It probably also helps that she and her master are sex buddies.
-   Obscure web comic **Sakana Yama** had main character Urchin find a genie, who granted him the wishes he wanted. However, Urchin only used his wishes to improve the lives of his friends, keeping none for himself. This impressed the genie so much, he granted Urchin unlimited wishes. (Not that the genie ever told him that.)
-   Angelique of **The Wotch** is one of the few genies that actually likes humanity. Unfortunately, when she's summoned, she's summoned through a cursed bottle that forces her to grant any wish she hears from **anyone**, not just Jason, who summoned her. Some of the wish-granting on poorly-done wishes is done in Jackass Genie style, but it's implied that Angie isn't doing it deliberately.
    -   It's intentional. The bottle was made by a Knight Templar that hated humans and wanted to provoke a war, but was willing to settle for humans never summoning them again.
-   In **Krakow!**, a character makes a wish for a perfect girlfriend, and specifies that she must be "an airplane". She has metal wings and fins and consumes gasoline. Could be a Literal Genie, but it's hard to imagine what else that wish could have possibly meant. Of course, the character's roommate claims that it was nothing more than a hallucination due to a case of the flu.

-   **Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal**: In "Three Wishes", a guy encounters a genie that follows the letter and the spirit of the wishes he gives. Unfortunately, instead of granting any wishes, he follows the last wish of his **last** client, who was a jerk and made a wish about what the next one would get.

Benevolent Genie Example in Web Original

-   **SCP Foundation**:
    -   SCP-1481 used to be this kind of genie, by his own admission... until some Jerkass wished he was permanently stoned out of his head, just to be a dick. Now, SCP-1481 is rendered completely incompetent because of his drugged-out state, and the **really** sick thing about it is that the jerk who wished for him to be in this state used his second wish to make his first wish irreversible... and then **walked away without even bothering to make a third wish**.
    -   Mr. Deeds qualifies, though despite being a wish-granter he does not actually use magic to grant wishes, or possibly he does but it has arbitrary limitations. And even if he can't directly comply with a request he can still offer helpful suggestions and assistance in carrying them out. According to SCP-978's photographs, which reveal what an individual truly desires at the moment they're taken, all Mr. Deeds really wants to do is comply with what he's asked, and he's perfectly happy with that.
    -   SCP-3063 is a very cruel twist of the Power at a Price variety, in that it grants a wish to the spirit of the wish, but the wisher invariably gets devoured alive by maggots about six and a half years after making their wish.
    -   SCP-5655 plays the trope for laughs: It 'wants' to help, but is so ineffectual that it can only grant wishes in the most mundane and useless ways. For example, if asked for a 'heavy stone', SCP-5655 will procure a stone heavy for **it** (around 4 lbs). It actually has a good and benevolent reason for this: The reality of the dimension the SCP-verse is in is fraying at the edges, and granting wishes in grandiose ways will make things even more unstable. Hence, SCP-5655 grants wishes in ways that both cause as little strain on reality as possible and that makes people unwilling to use its wish-granting powers in the first place.
-   Jinn of **RWBY** is an omniscient question-answerer rather than an omnipotent wish-granter, but as a genie summoned from a lamp she fits the spirit of this trope. When Ruby asks her the question "What is Ozpin hiding from us?", Jinn goes into great detail about his and Salem's backstory and the past of Remnant and how these have shaped them into the figures they are today.

Benevolent Genie Example in Web Videos

-   The **Angry Video Game Nerd** encounters one in the Aladdin Deck Enhancer episode. The Genie is just happy to be free, granting whatever Nerd asks him for. Even when Nerd wishes for the Genie to go skinny dipping in a septic tank, he obliges albeit reluctantly.
-   In **Dragon Ball Z Abridged**, Shenron is this more or less to the same degree as the original, though he's more put-upon by the fact that the cast tends to use him for whatever they feel like. In fact, his main gripe with them seems to be that they don't use his power **efficiently**. He'll go so far as to advise people on loopholes in his power that could let them get what they wanted (for instance, he can't **directly** kill a strong person, but he can get rid of them in other ways, like sabotaging a vehicle they're in), only to be ignored. The only time he's dipped into full-on Jackass Genie is when Krillin, after accidentally burning down an entire large forest, wished for the perfect Christmas tree instead of for the forest's restoration. Shenron is so disgusted at Krillin's selfishness (and keep in mind, he's granted wishes to out-and-out villains with no strings attached) that he grants it by instead directing the Space Pirate Turles, cultivator of the Tree of Might, to come to Earth.

Benevolent Genie Example in Western Animation

-   Prismo from **Adventure Time**, while obligated to give "monkey's paw"-like twists by the rules of his magic, is actually an **absurdly** nice wish-granter. He even ignored Jake's wish for a sandwich to just make him one for free and essentially told Jake exactly the wish he needed to save everyone.
-   **Aladdin: The Series**:
    -   Following up from the movie, Genie is not even obligated to help Aladdin or Jasmine at all anymore. Since Aladdin used his final wish to free him, Genie is no longer a true genie. He just does so because he likes them. (And there are hints that they're better friends than any other humans he's known.)
    -   There's a female genie called Eden, who is also benevolent. Unlike Genie, however, she's wise enough to become a Literal Genie when dealing with Jerkass Abis Mal. When the villain wishes Genie imprisoned in the bottom of the ocean, she gives him an escape hatch because Mal didn't say forever. When Mal wishes to be the biggest and strongest being in the world, she includes a method of relieving him of his power; and when the little girl who finds her wishes for everything to be all right, she turns Abis Mal into a bug as a "freebie". She also goes out of her way to encourage the little homeless girl to come up with better wishes; when the girl wishes for a sandwich, she convinces her to wish for a lifetime supply of food instead. She even acknowledges that she has to play with the rules a bit for this, and has the girl say the wish along with her.
    -   A different episode features a benevolent "genie" surrounded by jackasses — it's a little fuzzy creature that grants the wish of whoever scares it as a defense mechanism. Iago befriends it, and at episode's end, shows it a mirror while screaming. "Squirt scared himself", so its own wish is granted — to return to the homeland of its species.
-   **Captain N: The Game Master** once had the heroes stumble upon a genie who granted their wishes as they intended them. It was a critique of the newly-developed patch devices; Kevin wishes for enhanced skills, and quickly realizes Victory Is Boring. Mega Man wishes for enhanced strength, and nearly **knocks down the palace.** Princess Lana immediately wishes that "no one had made any wishes", returning things to normal for the moment so they can get on with the plot.
-   Cosmo and Wanda in **The Fairly OddParents!**, since making Timmy happy is their job as fairy godparents. On the other hand, they sometimes make mistakes, and Timmy's wishes can have unintended consequences. They **do** warn Timmy about the possibility of a wish backfiring and urge him to alter his wishes to minimize risk if possible. It also seems that sometimes they **have** to be literal, or at least, can't undo something they've already granted literally. Or something; it kind of changes with the plot. They always **mean** well, though.
-   One episode of **Garfield and Friends** featured Odie finding a genie at the beach, who was a rather nice guy. Since Odie only had one wish (to fly), he even decided to give Odie his wish three times so that his wishes wouldn't be wasted.
-   Played with on **Gargoyles** — Demona, a villain, summons Puck of the Third Race and tries to use him to Kill All Humans (or at least, as many as his great-but-limited power can). The thing is, Puck likes humans, so by acting like a Jerkass Genie and Literal Genie to Demona throughout the episode (getting rid of the humans in Manhattan by turning them into gargoyles) he's actually keeping humanity safe.
-   **Looney Tunes**:
    -   In **Ali Baba Bunny**, Daffy Duck briefly obtains a treasure that includes the services of a genie who really wants to help him... but Daffy, being who he is, attacks the genie as a rival for his treasure. The consequences are not good.
    -   Smokey, the Jim Backus-voiced genie in the Bugs Bunny cartoon "A Lad in His Lamp", is addled but effervescent and benevolent. He gets cross when Bugs, in a pickle with a greedy sultan, interrupts him a couple of times.
-   The Meeseeks from **Rick and Morty** will generally act this way... provided, of course, said wishes are possible to complete reasonably. Meeseeks **really** want to complete their tasks so they can properly die, so if they go more than a few days without being able to complete a request, they may get violently creative with how they solve it. Making someone popular at school and assuaging concerns about a marriage are done exactly as requested, but when Jerry asks them to take two strokes off his golf game while **also** absolutely refusing to improve his game... they end up coming to the conclusion that killing him would fulfill his wish by taking **all** the strokes off his golf game.
-   An animated version of the "The Fisherman and his Wife" tale on the **Rocky and Bullwinkle** show has a happier ending (and also replaces the fish with a mermaid, but that's not important). The story follows the same plot, but in the end, the mermaid asks the fisherman what **he** wanted. When he says that all he wants is for his wife to be happy, the mermaid reverts things back to the way they were before — except now the fisherman's wife appreciates what she already has instead of complaining about what she lacks.
-   The genie in the Hanna-Barbera cartoon **Shazzan** promptly does whatever the protagonists want. Except taking them home, which is ostensibly the whole plot. Mostly, he just answers wishes of "save us from this evil guy who wants your power". In the one cartoon where the bad guy succeeds, he uses a Literal Genie interpretation of his wish to keep from killing his "real" masters.
-   The title characters of the Nick Jr. show **Shimmer and Shine**. The three daily wishes they grant to their human friend Leah don't always go as planned, but they mean no harm with them, and always help her out in the end.
-   Dez from **Wishfart** is a leprechaun who actively grants wishes for his friends and others. While his wishes almost always go completely wrong, he usually means well and tries to fix the consequences to the best of his ability.
-   **The Emperor's New School**: Every Giftmas, Papa Santos grants one wish to each person in the "nice" list. Kuzco wishes to become the Emperor again but he's on the top of the "naughty" list.
-   **Heathcliff & the Catillac Cats** episode "Wishful Thinking" has a cat genie. The genie is not really bad but he does uses Mungo in his favor to be freed. He does wishes at the end that all his dreams come true (metaphorically).
