Call a Human a Meatbag: 
**Red Volcano:** You stand no chance against me, humans.  
**M'gann and Superboy:** WE'RE NOT HUMAN!  
**Red Volcano:** Apologies. I suppose the properly inclusive term is — "meatbags".

When humans are referred to as "meatbags" or as otherwise meaty things as a slur by non-meaty, non-human beings. Another, equally valid version, largely in the case of aliens, is that the term is used not as an intentional slur, but simply to express shock or novelty or because the alien does not have another term sufficient to describe them. These examples still count as this trope because they may still be interpreted as insults by humans (including the audience). In fact, this may be played for laughs.

An additional variation which may or may not warrant its own subtrope involves vampires and similar creatures referring to humans derogatorily as a food source, with the implication that this is all they are good for.

May frequently overlap with Humans Are Ugly, Humans Are Morons and Humans Are Flawed. A subtrope of Fantastic Slur. Compare Son of an Ape, Call a Rabbit a "Smeerp" and Humans by Any Other Name.
