Blown Upward by a Blowhole: 
Among the most distinct features of cetaceans, the order of aquatic mammals that includes whales, dolphins, and narwhals, are their blowholes, derived nostrils at the tops of their heads that allow them to breathe air while still keeping their bodies mostly submerged. When cetaceans surface to exhale, they also spray water up from their blowholes, making them resemble miniature geysers.

In fiction, the strength of these "geysers" is often heavily exaggerated. The blowholes are portrayed as natural high-pressure hoses able to forcefully move objects as big as grown humans, sometimes to the point that the gushing water serves as a watery platform for people to move atop of. A character who was Swallowed Whole by a whale can even be blown out from the whale's gullet to the outside, often the result of using a Uvula Escape Route. (Though real life whales do not have uvulas — in fact, very few animals do.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ) And sometimes, the cetacean uses its blowhole as a weaponized water cannon.
