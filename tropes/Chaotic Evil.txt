**Character Alignment**  
Lawful Good | Neutral Good | Chaotic Good  
Lawful Neutral | True Neutral | Chaotic Neutral  
Lawful Evil | Neutral Evil | **Chaotic Evil**

_"You're looking at it rationally — there are people who are useful to you, and people who ain't, and the people who ain't got to go. Me, I'm **not** rational. I don't **care** if you're useful or not. I **feel** like taking you out, Devo, so that's what I'm doing."_

One of the nine alignments from the best-known Character Alignment system. If Chaotic Neutral is the truly free spirit, Chaotic Evil is the truly free _evil_ spirit. Whereas the Chaotic Neutral character is just concerned with his own freedom but doesn't seek to hurt others, the same cannot be said for Chaotic Evil characters. They take pleasure in hurting others and will do whatever they want whenever they want to do it, which, seeing as they are evil, usually entails lots and lots of death and destruction. These characters are usually the most aggressive of the Evil alignments, more often than not being possessed of an impulsively violent nature and a total disregard for people, laws, or even the world around them. In short, Chaotic Evil represents the destruction of not only life and goodness, but also the order upon which they depend. This makes Chaotic Evil, potentially, the most terrifying evil to fight because it's so unpredictable and often incomprehensible to most, lacking the order and rules of Lawful Evil, or the inherent yet understandable selfish pragmatism of Neutral Evil.

Chaotic Evil characters come in several deliciously evil flavors in different variety:

-   **Chaos Over Evil** — Above all things they value their _personal_ freedom, and as personalities they are greedy, selfish and hedonistic; therefore they want the freedom to fulfill their greedy, selfish and hedonistic desires. It is often seen in The Friend Nobody Likes and the Token Evil Teammate. What sets them apart from the below type is their occasional demonstration that Even Evil Has Standards — they sided with the good guys, didn't they? Don't turn your back on them for a moment though, because if they feel like their freedom is being infringed they may well go nuts just to prove you can't control them. They're too wild-spirited to really reform, but in the right company their Pet the Dog moments may increase in frequency.
-   **Evil Over Chaos** — They are so Evil that they would rather side with the bad guys even if they have to take a few orders. They place more value in unleashing fiery death and mayhem over the ability to do it at any time, so they take orders grudgingly but take them nonetheless. This type of Chaotic Evil makes for a particularly unpleasant brand of Mook, given that they may well revel in collateral damage and killing any fellow Mooks unfortunate enough to get in their way. If the Big Bad handles his great big stick skillfully enough, this type may become Neutral Evil or even Lawful Evil simply out of habit. If, on the other hand, they _are_ the Big Bad, expect them to go out of their way to violate any sense of honour, tradition, loyalty, or responsibility normally associated with the leadership position, such as betraying their own Mooks purely For the Evulz.
-   **The Feral Beast** — If you're not a predator, you're prey, and God forbid this type should see you as prey, since weakness is unforgivable. A clever Big Bad may be able to manipulate this guy, but they must dominate the Feral Beast completely in both strength and intelligence. The Feral Beast has a good chance of turning on their evil master and becoming the new, tougher, meaner Big Bad.
-   **The Intelligent Monster** — This type doesn't care who they destroy or how they destroy them; the fact that they can be destroyed is enough. They create plans deliberately structured to spread chaos and misery, and are generally batshit insane with a complete Lack of Empathy.
-   **The Terrorist Freedom Fighter** is a Well-Intentioned Extremist who saw (or a Knight Templar who sees) himself as Chaotic Good (Just Like Robin Hood) but slowly passed over to the evil alignment, often without being consciously aware of it. You know what they say about slippery slopes...

Chaotic Evil is probably the hardest alignment to depict _sensibly_. Far too many people assume that Chaotic Evil means a babbling lunatic incapable of walking through a village without inducing wanton, meaningless slaughter and destruction. "Chaotic Evil" does not mean the most evil or stupid, in it For the Evulz (which can be a motivation to any villain of any Evil alignment), nor even psychotic.

The least dangerous (well, the bottom-rung at least) character of this alignment is the unwilling Mook — they hate their master, they hate taking orders, and they enjoy their job but not the fact that it _is_ a job; they'd have a lot more fun causing all that terror and discord for free, and they only behave mainly out of the fear of punishment. The most dangerous character of this alignment, on the other hand, is undoubtedly The Chessmaster mixed in with Omnicidal Maniac, with his cruel calculation and intelligence and the will to use it in the most horrible ways. When these types do come up, being Chaotic, they tend to specialise in the Xanatos Speed Chess variation, excelling at adapting plans as events unfold rather than having every contingency prepared ahead of time.

Can _easily_, and almost always does, overlap with Complete Monster.

Not to be confused with Always Chaotic Evil, which is about an entire race falling under **any** of the Evil alignments.

Chaotic Evil Example in 

If you have a difficulty deciding which alignment an Evil-aligned character belongs to, the main difference between Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil and Chaotic Evil is not their devotion to their evil wishes, but what methods they believe are best to realizing it:

-   Even though there are some situations where they can't always use this method, Lawful Evil characters believe the best way is to have a specific, strict code of conduct, whether self-imposed or codified as a law. Their first impulse when making a moral decision is to refer back to this code; those with externally-imposed systems (codes of laws, hierarchies, etc.) will try to work within the system when those systems go wrong. Depending on whether they are more Lawful or more Evil, they will either refuse to break the code even though it would hurt their evil objectives, or else break it only very reluctantly, and only when it would hurt their evil objectives if they kept their code.
-   Neutral Evil characters are indifferent to Order Versus Chaos, and their only interest is in realizing their evil wishes. They will use whatever means will help in realizing their evil wishes, whether that means tearing down a code of laws, following a code of laws, creating a new code of laws, causing the breakdown of justice, or just avoiding society altogether. Their only goal is to realize their evil wishes, full stop.
-   Most Chaotic Evil characters don't constantly break the law, but they don't place much value in laws (or, for weaker-C CEs, do not see the value in laws that do not function solely to their depraved objectives or increase their own personal freedom). They believe that their own evil impulses are their best guides, and that tying themselves to any given code of conduct would be limiting themselves. They often react violently to anyone who tries to instill any form of order over them, believing these people to be restricting their freedom. Chaotic Evil characters often focus very strongly on their own individual rights and freedoms, and will strongly resist any form of oppression over themselves.

A Chaotic Evil character is perfectly willing to work for or with another individual or group, even of a totally different alignment, if it gives them an excuse or licence to behave the way they want to — the distinction between this and Neutral Evil lies in the nature of the behaviour and how far and how frequently they push the limits that the job description permits (if such limits exist). Characters such as the Magnificent Bastard, The Dragon or Big Bad, The Chessmaster or Psycho for Hire etc. will all vary between Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, and Chaotic Evil — if a character has Undying Loyalty to a villain or is willing to obey orders but is otherwise drowning in Chaotic Evil motives and/or behaviour, odds are they are still Chaotic Evil.

Chaotic Evil characters **can** actually rule over people (since they only care about **their own** freedom), but it typically takes the form of "Do whatever the heck I say NOW!". The Omnicidal Maniac can be of any alignment, and chaotic evil characters are, on average, only likely to fall into that behaviour when they are bored or if they are a Straw Nihilist — plenty of others believe in Anarchy Is Chaos or even just mundane evil behaviour that does not operate on that scale.

Not to be confused with Chaos Is Evil, though due to that trope Chaotic Evil is often thought of to be the most evil alignment, despite Dungeons & Dragons being consistent all evil alignments are just as bad.

## When dealing with the examples of specific characters, remember that assigning an alignment to a character who doesn't come with one is pretty subjective. If you've got a problem with a character being listed here, it probably belongs on the discussion page. There will be no Real Life examples under any circumstances; it just invites an Edit War. Plus, real people are far too complex and multi-dimensional to really be classified by such a straightforward alignment system.  
On work pages: Character Alignment is only to be used in works where it is canonical, and only for characters who have alignments in-story. There is to be no arguing over canonical alignments, and no Real Life examples, ever. Its subjective nature makes it very good kindling for a Flame War.

Chaotic Evil Example in Comedy

-   Jeff Dunham puppet Achmed the Dead Terrorist fancies himself as this, and just might be if he didn't totally suck at doing anything evil. Being a skeleton limits his ability to do anything beyond making empty death threats.

Chaotic Evil Example in Fan Works

-   Voldemort of **My Immortal** was most likely **supposed** to be this. In the actual story, he doesn't really do anything besides hijack MCR concerts and yell at Ebony for not killing Vampire/Harry, making him more Chaotic Neutral.
-   The dezban high chieftain Takavor Derishama in the **Mass Effect** fanfic **The Council Era** is wild, law-disregarding Chaotic Evil. This is kind of a given for his race, though. The best example of his nature is when he ignores the attempts of a salarian soldier to get his attention, and when the salarian fires a round into his shoulder, he throws his spear through the salarian, and has his clan slaughter and eat the salarian's squad. This does not bode well for him.

-   In **Prison Island Break,** the psychotic Shadow the Hedgehog values his freedom hugely. Sometimes he goes right off the rails just to prove he can't be controlled. Sonic thinks of this as "Shadow Logic" — his personal term for Chaotic Stupid.
    
    **Narration:** "Damn Shadow Logic. It probably all made sense in the black hedgehog's head, but Sonic didn't want to know how."
    
    -   Scourge commits evil acts because it's fun, with no concern for any of his victims, but incorporates some planning to make it easier.

Chaotic Evil Example in Films — Animation

-   Some of the more violent or just wanton Disney Villains fit Chaotic Evil:
    -   Maleficent from **Sleeping Beauty**
    -   **Mulan**: Shan Yu, a barbarian who decides to start a war against China because he sees the Great Wall as a challenge.
    -   Madame Mim from **The Sword in the Stone**
    -   The Hyenas from **The Lion King**
-   Hal Stewart/"Titan" from **Megamind** starts off as a mild-mannered nerd given superpowers and training by Megamind, in the hope of making a worthy hero to his villain. Unfortunately, the initially harmless Hal turns out to be a Psychopathic Manchild, who uses his new abilities to satisfy his desires with no thought to the consequences and feels entitled to the affections on his crush. When denied, his response is a hyper destructive temper tantrum that endangers the whole city.
-   Unicron from **The Transformers: The Movie**. He even has the titles "lord of chaos" and "the chaos bringer"
-   The North Wind, the titular elemental entity from the obscure spanish animated film **The Legend of the North Wind** is an ancient, malevolent and savage spirit with cryokinetic powers who wants to turn the world into a frozen wasteland and exterminate the whales out of spite and sadism.
-   **DC Universe Animated Original Movies**:
    -   **Superman: Doomsday**: Toyman is a lunatic who believes the entire world is his plaything, and loves murdering children.
    -   **Wonder Woman (2009)**: Ares is a War God who causes horrible violence simply with his very presence, and wants to plunge the whole of existence into horrible violence.
    -   **Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths**: Owlman is filled with existential angst after learning that all of his decisions simply create another timeline where he took the opposite route, and decides to destroy the multiverse as an attempt to have some level of control over his existence.
    -   **Batman: Under the Red Hood**: The Joker beat Jason Todd to death for giggles, and uses being broken out of Arkham Asylum to fight off the resurrected Todd as an excuse to kill more people, including his own bosses.
    -   **Justice League: Doom**: Vandal Savage sets up an elaborate plot to destroy the Justice League, all as a distraction to his **real** scheme to create a solar flare and destroy all of society because he preferred the days when humanity was a bunch of warring cavemen.

Chaotic Evil Example in Music

-   If you ever shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die, you just might be Chaotic Evil.

-   **The Beatles**: "BANG BANG Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon his head / CLANG CLANG Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that he was dead..."
-   "I dunno what I want, but I know how to get it / I wanna DESTROY passers-by"
-   Eddie the Head seems to get a kick out of random violence judging from the album covers.
-   Most of the characters from GWAR are chaotic evil (with the remainder tending to be Lawful Evil characters such as Cardinal Syn who oppose the main characters). The band's lyrics talk extensively about unprovoked murder, semi-provoked murder, revenge, pointless destruction of property, extreme sadism and sexual deviancy, genocide, destructive drug-fueled benders, and more unprovoked murder.
-   The Metallica song, "Battery", depicts the singer as being wholly consumed by a driving desire to batterize everything he can find.
    
    Lashing out the action  
    Returning the reaction  
    Weak are ripped and torn away  
    Hypnotizing power  
    Crushing all that cower  
    Battery is here to stay
    
-   Eminem's famous "Slim Shady" persona is reminiscent of The Joker, mixing brutal sadism with twisted Black Comedy.

Chaotic Evil Example in Mythology & Religion

-   Satan is portrayed this way when he's not Lawful Evil, who always keeps his word once given, never goes back on a bet, etc., in Irish, Scottish and American (especially Southern) folktales, sometimes outwitted by a Trickster.
-   In the Hebrew Kabbalah, there are demons known as the Golachab or "Burning Bodies" who set themselves on fire so as to cause more burning and destruction in their wake wherever they go. That's Chaotic Evil (and Stupid Evil) all over.
-   Kullervo, the tragic Anti-Hero/Antivillain of the Finnish **Kalevala**, is a vicious mass murderer with an Hair-Trigger Temper and mental illness.
-   In Egyptian mythology, despite the Hollywood interpretations of Anubis, one of several gods of death, he was not this, and was in fact Lawful Good, since his duties consisted of protecting the bodies of the dead. However, the god Set, the god of darkness, sandstorms, and chaos, most certainly qualifies here... except when he doesn't. Yeah, there's that business he pulled with Osiris and Horus, but he also regularly saved Ra from Apep. Apep himself is the only figure in Egyptian mythology that is truly Chaotic Evil, seeking nothing but the destruction of the god Ra, the embodiment of justice, righteousness and the physical representation of the sun. In short, an Omnicidal Maniac.
-   The terrifying Navajo Skinwalker absolutely revels in inhuman depravity for its own sake.
-   The Wendigos from Algonquin mythology are personifications of pure, murderous, cannibalistic hunger.
-   In Norse mythology, the wolf Fenrir, son of Loki, likes nothing better than to devour and consume anything that comes near him. Ditto the dragon Nithogg, who does nothing except gnaw at the World Tree Ygdrassil. Loki himself is usually depicted as Chaotic Neutral, but his gradual descent into evil will reach its climax at Ragnarok, when he will lead the forces of darkness to destroy creation, and his son Fenrir (or depending on the myth, his grandson, Fenrir's son, Sköll) will eat the Sun.
-   Spring-heeled Jack seemed motivated by the desire to do evil for its own sake, and petty evil at that. Physically assaulting random people, jumping in front of carriages to scare the drivers for the hell of it, coming up to and slapping soldiers at their barracks and generally scaring the bejeesus out of the citizens of London and the rest of England, for no reason other than its own amusement.
-   In Classical Mythology, Ares, the Greek god of war, is pretty much just a glorfied bully who seeks to smash anyone who irritates him, and is a Jerkass God even compared to the other Greek gods.
    -   His little sister Eris (goddess of discord) is similar, although she prefers more subtle methods of starting violence and discord. Unsurprisingly, Ares is the only one of the other gods who can stand her.

Chaotic Evil Example in Professional Wrestling

-   Kane is not motivated by any of the standard pro wrestling goals — he doesn't care at all about being a champion, being famous, making lots of money, the thrill of competition, Doing It for the Art, or anything along those lines. No, he's a wrestler for one reason and one reason only — to inflict pain. Lots of it, to whomever he can get his hands on. And he smiles and cackles maniacally the entire time he's doing it. Other than that, he's a singularly unmotivated individual. He'll also run in on random matches and beatdown other wrestlers regardless of their alignment. Because of this he's perpetually a tweener or switching alignments.

-   Randy Orton in early 2009. Orton did whatever he wanted when he wanted, whether he was braining his own boss or kissing the unconscious wife of his nemesis Triple H, and blamed it all on a mental condition so he couldn't be fired. His ultimate goal was to be WWE Champion and destroy the McMahon family at the same time. And he got a lot of cheers for it.

-   Kevin Steen after turning on El Generico. The man who convinced Steen to turn, Steve Corino, is also Chaotic Evil. They would later go on to found **S**uffering, **U**gliness, **C**haos, **M**ayhem with Jimmy Jacobs with the tag line being "Evil Is Here To Destroy ROH".
-   For much of 2011, we had R-Truth. Muttering to himself, acting wildly vicious in nature, and trolling various members of the audience, and by extension, roster. As of early 2012, he's much the same, only now he's Chaotic Good.

---
Chaotic Evil Example in Theatre

-   Shakespeare did it

-   Don John in **Much Ado About Nothing** plots to destroy the love of Hero and Claudio for no reason at all. Don John is also Stupid Evil and / or Chaotic Stupid as he clearly hasn't thought any of his plans out and he seems to get caught out more than once. Without his Hypercompetent Sidekick Boraccio providing the brains behind his schemes he'd get nowhere.
-   Iago from **Othello**. He claims initially to have a motive for hating Othello and Desdemona, but it changes each time he brings it up and he eventually admits that he's just acting For the Evulz.

-   Stanley from **A Streetcar Named Desire** turns out to be clearly evil after he rapes Blanche and later has her sent off to a mental institution. His great emphasis on personal freedom and his random, brutal behavior lands him into Chaotic Evil territory.
-   Mr Punch from **Punch and Judy** is a pretty clearcut example of this alignment. In a typical show, he kills his own baby by throwing it out of a window, beats his wife to death with a stick, kills several other characters whom he encounters and finally outwits the devil himself to get away completely scot free.
-   This is the defining character trait of Marlowe's **Doctor Faustus**, in stark contrast to Lawful Evil Mephistopheles. He really, **really** hates having to put up with limitations of any kind, and his whole reason for devoting his life to Satan-knowing full well this would result in his death and probably getting sent to Hell for eternity-is because he can't bear to have the inherent limitations of **being human**.
-   Arturo Ui and his gang in **The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui**, though Roma shows some Lawful Evil traits. Ui seems to regard breaking the law as an end unto itself rather than a way of achieving goals. He does seek power and fame, but goes out of his way to do so through robbery, murder, etc. rather than through legitimate means. Borders on Stupid Evil, but his methods are fairly effective nonetheless.
-   Erik, the titular **Phantom Of The Opera**. Rejected by society for his deformities, Erik is unable to acquire power through legitimate means. Instead, he seeks control of the Paris Opera House through intimidation and extortion, bullying the proper owners of the establishment into having his way. He remains out of sight from the production crew, only making his presence known through the havoc he causes when the managers defy his orders. Even his relationship with Christine could be described as this, having taken advantage of her father's death in order to come into her life as an "Angel of Music", and tutoring her from his hidden lair with the intent of marrying her.

Chaotic Evil Example in Web Animation

-   Pillow from **Battle for Dream Island** is a rather comedic example of this. While she was originally a rather Chaotic Neutral character in **Battle For BFB**, this aspect of her gets dropped completely by the time of **The Power of Two**, instead opting to have her be a perpetually happy, Ax-Crazy lover of murdering people who doesn't hesitate to find an excuse in innocuous situations to murder others.
-   Hell in **Hazbin Hotel** and **Helluva Boss** is a terrible place not because of fire and brimstone but because it's full of cynically evil beings and random mayhem. Cannibalism seems to be an everyday event, and people keep randomly breaking everything from small items they are holding to brick walls.
    -   The Demon Lord, Mammon turns out to be as depraved, greedy and exploitative as previously rumored. There's no low he would stoop, just to be successful and pigheaded. However when the masses disagree with him? He's left childishly mean and vindictive, with a mouth soo vulgar it HAD to be censored.
-   Carl from **Llamas with Hats**. Among his many crimes include: stabbing a man 37 times, burying a woman alive, sinking a cruise ship on purpose, toppling a South American government, nuking a city, intentionally tearing a hole in the fabric of space-time, mutilating **millions** of babies from alternate universes, making a dragon out of the meat of orphans he'd killed and then eating it, and **ending all life on Earth**, all for **no reason whatsoever**.
-   **RWBY**:
    -   Tyrian Callows is a Practically Joker maniac and Serial Killer, who sadistically revels in chaos, evil and death. He clearly enjoys what he does, outright stating that you're doing it wrong if you're not loving what you're doing. Though he initially appears to be tempered by his Undying Loyalty to Salem, he manages to remain in Chaotic territory when he reveals that he only believes in her so strongly because he sees her as the Anthropomorphic Personification of destruction.
    -   Adam Taurus starts off as a Neutral Evil terrorist, balancing his obsession with Blake with his loyalty to his cause. When said loyalty is shown to be non-existent, however, he becomes undeniably Chaotic, proving to be little more than a manipulative, abusive yandere with a possessive, destructive obsession with an ex that openly wants nothing to do with him.

Chaotic Evil Example in Webcomics

-   Voltaire from **El Goonish Shive**. Unwillingly The Fettered like all of his Immortal kin, Voltaire's objective is to manipulate the rest of the immortals into collectively removing their limitations on interacting with humanity... so he can treat humanity like his personal playthings. And he is both willing and seemingly **eager** to kill to make this happen, even if he can't do so directly.
-   Bangladesh Dupree from **Girl Genius**, a former pirate who works with Baron Wulfenbach because he gives her lots of opportunities to kill and torture people.

-   Pierre Buzarde, Psycho for Hire villain of **Ruby's World**, kills his own Mooks on a whim, talks about torture like an art form, and believes that taking someone alive means he can still render them brain-damaged from asphyxiation.
-   **The Order of the Stick**:
    
    -   Belkar Bitterleaf. Word of God has his alignment written down pat. Once got in the middle of a barroom brawl between old friends (offscreen) and **stabbed fifteen people to death**. He later gets visited in a dream by Shojo, who tells him that rather than trying to actively act outside of society's rules (which would make others kill him eventually), he should instead try to play by the rules and cheat whenever he can, making others believe he's playing by the rules. Belkar sums this up as faking Character Development. Following a lot of group upheaval, he begins to realize he's Becoming the Mask, and starts to actually \*try\* to be a better team player.
    -   Xykon, the Big Bad from the same series, also very much fits in here. Killing for the fact that it's the only thing that he can enjoy since undeath, he has since stopped caring about anything save for his own amusement, which usually results in horrible atrocities for others. He sees either standards or justification for evil actions as merely cowardice. Late in the comic, he straight-up admits that the main reason he plots to take control of the world is so that no one, not even the very gods themselves, can ever tell him what to do **ever** again; being subordinate to anything but his own whims is perhaps his only anathema.
    -   According to the Order of the Stick wiki page, Sabine and Thog are also Chaotic Evil. Sabine qualifies because she's a demon and therefore Always Chaotic Evil, and Thog is a Psychopathic Manchild — he's innocent and not deliberately malicious, but thinks killing is fun and will kill without remorse.
    -   Fenrir, the God of Monsters of the Northern Pantheon, manages to define Chaotic Evil in just one line. The gods are voting whether to destroy the world to stop something that threatens the gods themselves, and he votes "yes" because
    
    "Tear down the world! Murder everyone! Piss on their graves!"
    
-   **8-Bit Theater**:
    -   Black Mage. His most powerful spell is powered by love — in the same way that an automobile engine is powered by gasoline. It burns away a small part of the total amount of love in the universe each time he uses it, which he says manifests as a small increase in divorce rates. You know things are bad when he Hadokens a supply ship for orphans out of existence.
    -   King Steve, The Caligula of Corneria, is all too happy to start wars on a whim and has babies killed to make shoes. Holding an election for his throne with the option of him or a sword to the head, he kills off 52% of his own people.

-   Aram of **Men in Hats**. His hobbies consist of poisoning, immolating, bombing, insulting, and psychologically torturing his "friends." Also, television.
    
    **Aram:** I'm bored. Jump around with this scorpion on your face.  
    **Gamal:** Whaaaaaahh!
    
-   **Homestuck**:
    -   Jack Noir kills people to pass the time, having started his killing spree over being forced to wear a silly hat. He isn't exactly picky, having abandoned all pretense of allegiance in favour of more teleporting murder. The only people spared his ire are the Draconian Dignitary, who acts as his Mission Control, and the ascended Peregrine Mendicant. In the case of PM, it's less "spared his ire" and more "unable to kill her, since she's his opposite alignment counterpart and exactly as powerful as he is." He also seems to be incapable of directly harming Jade, because he's partly her devoted guardian Becquerel (it's complicated). This doesn't mean he doesn't want her dead, it just means he has to send an agent (Courtyard Droll) to do it instead of handling it personally.
-   **Sluggy Freelance**:
    -   The demons of the Dimension of Pain in general are mainly motivated to inflict pain on mortals, and since they've run out of mortals, they'll just do whatever. Some of them randomly eating each other's pets or their own children is treated as business as usual.
    -   The group of pain-crazed mutants accidentally created by the Nofun Corporation and taking it over are similar, but even more so. They're so chaotic they have trouble getting anything done, and their leader Pang feels that he's Surrounded by Idiots, but he's also the worst offender in that respect. Hint: killing and torturing people randomly isn't a good way to get anything else done.
    -   The arch-demon K'Z'K's reason for existence is to cause The End of the World as We Know It, and not just once but over and over again. He's impulsive, has a cheerfully horrible sense of humour about hurting others, and unconcernedly bends any deal that he makes to a breaking point. It's the behaviour not of only someone motivated to destroy everything but also someone powerful enough to disregard everyone else's objections.
    -   Lodoze is a parody of Lobo who goes around killing people randomly (for reasons such as getting "Don't know" as an answer to a question) and acts with complete impunity because he's totally invulnerable. As Bun-bun remarks, it's easy to be "tough" when you're invulnerable.
-   Tlodnal, the God of Death in **Our Little Adventure**. His portfolio includes agony and sadness, and his clerics preach this dogma by spreading as much pain and misery as they possibly can.
-   **Bruno the Bandit** claimed that supermodels are all Chaotic Evil, in so many words.
-   The cartoonist of **Kevin & Kell** classifies Angelique as Chaotic Evil: she can hold a **serious** grudge and will screw over anyone to make sure she gets out on top, including seizing control of her ex-husband's company and nearly liquidating it to make a profit, selling out her fellow rabbits, and spurring her Neutral Evil husband R.L. into more overt attempts at sabotaging Kell's rival company.
-   **Tower of God**:
    -   The FUG organisation exists to overthrow and destroy the rulers of the Tower, King Jahad and the ten great families. While that's not an unambiguously evil goal — considering the kind of abuses of power by the rulers that often drive people to join FUG — FUG is shown as routinely manipulating, coercing, and killing people without hesitation.
    -   Quaetro Blitz is Axe-Crazy with fire. He later becomes friendly with the heroes, but that doesn't change the fact that he's still a crazy guy who likes to burn people to death for fun.
    -   As of the end of the second season, Khun Maschenny Jahad's proclaimed motive for wanting to create a great war within the Tower is basically bloodlust. If that's really all to it, she counts. Given the scheming nature of her family and herself, though, her motives might not be as obvious as they seem. Whatever they are, her methods leave little doubt about the Evil part of her alignment.
-   **Kill Six Billion Demons**:
    -   Aesma, the goddess of want, from the background mythology. It's typical for her to storm into a place and lay waste to everything and fight everyone on a quest to satisfy some foolish desire. She's definitely Chaotic Stupid, but Evil rather than Chaotic Neutral because of the sheer amount of death and destruction, and because there's kind of an explicit theme about her being extremely wicked. Someone expresses the opinion that only the Omnicidal Maniac Red Eyed King is her equal in wickedness, and when she meets him, she falls for him because he's so Obviously Evil.
    -   Speaking of which, the Red Eyed King is a Generic Doomsday Villain bent on destroying absolutely everything. He has no qualms about lying and breaking promises, either.
    -   Apparently the default state for devils — beings created from chaos and, unlike the angels who were created from the stuff of order but are not especially good, clearly evil too. Not a lot of exceptions have been seen. When Allison goes on a heist with a bunch of devils, and one of them tries to kill her for a bigger share and is killed by her in turn, the others just continue walking ahead and, when asked, comment that that was a bit sooner than expected. The only rule for devils is "Do as thou wilt."
-   Sparklelord from **The Adventures of Dr. McNinja** was once a unicorn in the Radical Lands who became an Evil Overlord to fight the radical people because they were jerks to him apparently... Anyway, by his first appearance in the comic, he just wants to spread death and destruction for no reason.
-   **Slightly Damned**: The foul-mouthed Fire Demon Azurai enjoys fighting and killing, frequently insults his teammates, and has a tendency to kill people who might have some use to the villains without hesitation.

Chaotic Evil Example in Web Original

-   Tez On Toast of **KateModern**. His earlier personas are slightly more open to debate, but from mid-season 2 onwards, he is a drug-crazed homicidal lunatic who switches motives in the blink of an eye, and takes great pleasure out of killing and torturing.
-   Flippy's evil side from **Happy Tree Friends**. When he sees something that reminds him of war, he turns evil and kills everyone around him.
-   Satan from **The Salvation War** is remarkably Ax-Crazy even for his usual image. So is Yahwee.
-   A few of the Enemies from A-GENTS. Kilk is a Chaotic Evil Combat Sadomasochist up to his ears in Evil Feels Good. Grin, on the other hand, is definitely a Psycho for Hire with a real fondness for tentacle rape. And then there's Alice... most everyone is very, very happy that she's dead.
-   **Noka**: Found is implied to be this by Az. It's safe to assume that he's a **much** better person now, seeing as his old self is spoken of so negatively.
    
    **Az:** But Found isn't as bad as he used to be. Sure, he's still frickin' crazy sometimes, but he's not an outright psychopath. God have mercy on your soul if you somehow managed to make the old Found come back, even for a few seconds.
    

-   Several supervillains in the **Whateley Universe**, including Don Sebastiano. Don Sebastiano has a couple helpless mindslaves... so he mistreats and violates them for fun.

-   Insanity Wolf, a meme regarding a Ax-Crazy Savage Wolf deepening advice that works out to this or Stupid Evil, whichever's funnier.
-   In this video, William is portrayed as a Serial rapist stalker.
    
    William: I was looking for someone... someone with unforgettable eye. And now that I've found her, I'm not going to let her get away from me! — Voice of the Legion — AND YOU WON'T TELL ANYONE ABOUT THIS, YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP QUIET... LIKE A GOOD GIRL.
    
-   **Ask That Guy with the Glasses**. At one point, a man who's dying of cancer and only has one day to live asks him whether or not he should go around killing people he's always hated. Ask That Guy tells him not to, because that wouldn't be random enough and he should instead go around killing people he's never met.

-   Charles Green (aka Angry Grandpa) from **The Angry Grandpa** is an iconic example of this alignment. Supremely destructive, violent, and with a temper shorter than any normal human being. Very rarely is he nice, and he has a range of weapons that could impress any psychopath. Destructive, yells a lot, and just plain obnoxious to ANYONE who dares piss him off or express a simple opinion.
-   Any Creepypasta antagonist (or Villain Protagonist) is, in theory, this. Most iconic examples being Jeff The Killer (Or Stupid Evil, depending on your view of him. Though the official remake makes him out to be a particularly violent True Neutral), Slender Man (more sympathetic examples portray him as Lawful Evil or True Neutral), Zalgo, Mr. Bear, BEN (Like Slender Man, more sympathetic examples portray him as Chaotic Neutral) and Skin-Taker.
-   On the **Dream SMP**, Dream is described as this, desiring to disrupt the status quo, and has a tendency to do things For the Evulz at times. Despite claiming to be a Well-Intentioned Extremist who wants to reunite his server (under his rule), he tends to use extreme methods to do so, having no qualms about destroying countries and gaslighting and manipulating minors, once to the point of suicidality, among many other things.
-   Charles Oswald of **What Madness is This?** is a totalitarian dictator and Ax-Crazy lunatic, who murdered his entire family for personal gain and then joined the military, where he committed every known war crime with unhidden glee, including mass genocide with flamethrowers, becoming known as The Beast of America, a name he and his men were proud to use. Once he becomes president, not only does he conquer almost the entire continent and exterminate the natives in just a few decades, but even starts massacring his own people and destroying cities by nuclear fire. He is so unstable that eventually even his right-hand man decides he’s a threat to their goals and must be put down, at which point Oswald tries to nuke his own capital, failing only because he is shot first.

Chaotic Evil Example in 

## Casavir and Bishop

During some "party banter" while traveling, Casavir, Paladin of Tyr, and Bishop, CE ranger, clash over their mutual attraction to the female player character. Casavir instinctively mistrusts Bishop's intentions towards her and calls him out for his disrespectful language, while Bishop retorts that 1) if she has a problem with it she's perfectly capable of dealing with it herself, which he respects, and 2) he thinks Casavir feels exactly the same way and is just refusing to express it. In Obsidian's script for the game, the two were supposed to form a love triangle over the female PC but the conclusion of Bishop's romance path was cut, as was the explanation for why Casavir behaves the way he does (he killed a man in a rivalry over a woman's affections and left town to fight orcs out of shame).
