Beary Funny: 
Wocka Wocka!

The only time _this_ bear is bad news is when his jokes are flat.

Perhaps it's because of the proliferation of the Teddy Bear as a child's toy, but bears are often portrayed as Boisterous Bruisers or sometimes just Big Fun, and aren't really looking to eat _people_ so much as just looking to eat. (Truth in Television; most bears are omnivorous and will gladly eat nuts and berries; also, while grizzlies _are_ aggressive, their favorite food is salmon.) Seems most common in Western Animation, although circus bears are common in Real Life.

Ursine Aliens can invoke this trope. Contrast Bears Are Bad News. Compare Beary Friendly, which examples here can also be.

Beary Funny Example in Puppet Shows

-   The Muppets seemed to be quite fond of showing off ursine characters in this manner:

Beary Funny Example in Theme Parks

-   Disney Theme Parks:
    -   The **Country Bear Jamboree** at Disneyland and Disney World. Bears playing musical instruments! And singing! Want to know why the **Country Bear Jamboree** is preserved when Disney could easily have replaced it with a more modern updated version? It's widely believed that Walt himself walked into the office of the Imagineer working on the designs and was in hysterics from the pictures of some of the proposed characters and the general idea himself. He then told the man to keep working on the funny bears and said "good-bye." Walt passed away that weekend. Legend has it that the Country Bears were the last happy moment in the life of a man who brought so many happy moments to so many people.
    -   Also, in the original circus segment of the Main Street Electrical Parade, one of the floats was a bear balancing on one foot on a set of barrels while having hoops looping around its arms and legs and balancing a honey pot on its head.

Beary Funny Example in Video Games

-   Teddie in **Persona 4**. Though he's not exactly a bear, he's actually a Shadow that takes form of a stuffed bear plush to endear himself with humans, and through interaction with party members, he grew a human body and thus his bear form is just his 'suit'. Otherwise, he fits the trope like a tee, with additions of tons of bear puns. Shadow Teddie, on the other hand... This is Lampshaded in the fighting game.

-   The Brothers Bear from **Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!**.
    -   In **Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze**, the penultimate boss, Bashmaster, the Unbreakable, is a rather odd example, given that he is a ferocious polar bear who wields a giant hammer with ice spikes on one end. When he is first seen, Bashmaster is casually reclining on an ice floe, licking a popsicle, only for DK and/or another Kong to fall on the floe and accidentally knock the popsicle out of the bear's paw and into a purple pool of fruit juice the ice floe is floating on, where the popsicle is eaten by a school of piranhas. This prompts Bashmaster to angrily turn on DK and/or another Kong, who put(s) on a hilarious guilty smile before the battle begins. Then, as the battle goes one, every time you hit Bashmaster, he falls into the pool, which slowly stains his white fur purple!
-   Claire the Bear of **The Sims** has a flower by her ear, digs through trash cans, interacts with certain appropriate objects (such as teddy bears, bear-skin rugs, and beehives) in silly ways, walks on tiptoes, and does not interact directly with Sims at all.

Beary Funny Example in Webcomics
