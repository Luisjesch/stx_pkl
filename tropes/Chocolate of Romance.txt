Chocolate of Romance: 
They say that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach.

_Flowers say, "I'm sorry" — chocolate says, "I love you!"_

— **American proverb**

Chocolate is one of the main components of romance, relationships, and sometimes even sex (not necessarily of that kind, obviously, though it may happen). Some believe that chocolate simulates the same part of the brain that sex does, but this is an Urban Legend; still, the two combine well.

Chocolate is used, primarily, within these three contexts:

-   The context of courting or inviting, when one character gives to another a box of chocolates, for example. A box may also appear in special celebrations, like the one year anniversary of a relationship or Valentine's day;
-   The context of sex and intimacy, when one character gives to another a bit of chocolate, usually a bonbon or praline. Generally, it precedes the sex act itself, being part of the foreplay;
-   The context of mending issues with their relationship (which is less frequent), with the character who gives usually asking for forgiveness or a pardon.

Though becoming far less common in Western countries, in countries like Japan it remains highly popular and important (see the Real Life section), which also justifies the fact that it's common in romantic settings present in Japanese media. In the case of Western media, it's more prevalent in period pieces or in movies made before The '60s and The '70s.

They're usually seen as either part of or on its own as a Grand Romantic Gesture. It is also often paired with some Flowers of Romance.

Often used with Erotic Eating. Can be involved in Romantic Spoonfeeding. May overlap with Through His Stomach. Compare Tastes Like Friendship and Girls Love Chocolate. Contrast Heartbreak and Ice Cream. Compare and contrast Food as Bribe.

First Love."

Chocolate of Romance Example in Anime & Manga

-   During the Valentine's Day Episode of **Asteroid in Love**, Moe gives Misa one of this in full **honmei-choco** mode, which is effectively a Love Confession. It is also through this Moe came out as a lesbian, somewhat a rarity in **Kirara** series, but won't be surprising in-universe.
-   **Handsome Girl and Crossdressing Boy**: An omake from the first volume has Iori expecting to get chocolate from Hazuki on Valentine's Day, but she asks if he has anything for her (since she generally acts as the "guy" in their relationship). After seeing his startled face, she admits she was kidding, and gives him a Spaghetti Kiss with a long piece of chocolate.
-   In **Hayate the Combat Butler**, Hinagiku Katsura gets a massive pile of chocolate on Valentine's Day.
-   In **Hetalia: Axis Powers**:
    -   The Valentine's Day strip involves, well, Valentine's Day chocolate. England goes to give America a chocolate bar that he had heard America wanted but sees that he already has an entire bucket full of chocolate.
    -   The Valentine's Day strip from **Hetalia: World Stars** features Japan, France, and Italy talking about the Japanese habits surrounding this day. Japan feels a bit of unease and tension in this particular day due to the social pressures. Cue Taiwan giving him some chocolate gifts (something which she does yearly) and France and Italy staring at him with a certain amusement.
-   A flashback in Chapter 31 of **I Think Our Son Is Gay** discussed this trope. A fourth-grade Hiroki complained it's unfair that in Japan, Valentine's chocolate must be given by a female to a male. His mother Tomoko explained that Platonic Valentine and male-initiated gifting are not unheard of and is common elsewhere, but Hiroki still ends up sulking because in any rate, it must involve a female... In retrospect, Tomoko found Hiroki must have been thinking of giving one to a boy, now she's quite sure Hiroki is gay and closeted. This scene is also the earliest instance when Hiroki identified his feelings to some boys as romantic.
-   **I Want Your Mother To Be With Me!**: Chapter 19 has Yuzuki, her son Asahi, Ryo, and his niece Haruka making chocolate together in the kitchen of Yuzuki's family's restaurant on Valentine's Day, and gifting the chocolates they've made to each other.
-   In an OVA DVD of **Kanokon**, Chizuru is trying to figure out what kind of chocolate to get for Kouta for Valentine's Day, her various ideas being a chocolate bar wedged in between her breasts, chocolate molds of her breasts, and finally, a chocolate bikini, which Kouta is to eat off of her. She just ends up giving him a traditional box of chocolates.
-   In **Love Hina** all of the girls do this for Keitaro since they all have feelings for him, in different ways and magnitudes.
-   During Valentine's Day in **Ranma ½**, Akane ends up having to give some chocolate to Ranma as a favor. She spends the entire chapter trying to figure out how to make sure it's not from her. Ranma is cautious about her in case they're homemade while also nervously looking forward to it. Eventually, Ranma gets the chocolate but is disappointed to learn the truth about it. Later that day, it turns out Akane bought a tiny heart-shaped chocolate, which Ranma gladly accepts.
    -   Not chocolate but a reverse situation happens in a later story when Ranma has to give Akane what appears to be an engagement ring.
-   In **Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei**, Itoshiki gets gifts from his entire class, although only two of them are clearly chocolate hearts - a normal one from Nami and one from Chiri which is strongly implied to be an actual human heart.
-   In **K-On!**, for Valentine's Day, Azusa thought about giving Mio some chocolate before giving a Suspiciously Specific Denial to Ui.
-   In **Potemayo** a girl gives Nene's friend Kyo (the athletic, cool girl) chocolate on Valentine's Day.
-   The twelveth **Tantei Team KZ Jiken Note** novel (and the fourth animated) **The Valentine Knows** practically surrounds this trope.
    -   Aya found she has nobody to give these to—Sunahara is distant, and she treats the rest of the Detective Team as Just Friends.
    -   Soccer Team KZ's member are so popular with the girls that they're no longer allowed by their Cram School to accept those personally.
    -   After knowing Sunahara being in a group of Japanese Delinquents, Wakatake came up with exploitation of this trope to check what's happening to the former—by having Aya sending him one of those, since no boys can resist it (the rest of the team agrees). The problem is Aya told them she would like to give this to Sunahara, so that's a really good chance...
    -   Most of the drama of the story derives from the long journey for Aya to deliver hers to Sunahara, which include a brief case of a nervous breakdown.
    -   The ending of the arc actually makes the situation between the members of Detective Team KZ ambiguous—they made a chocolate cake at Wakatake's home on Valentine's Day, and share among each other. This can be interpreted anywhere from True Companions to Reverse Harem.
-   In **Vampire Knight**, all of the vampires get incredible amounts of chocolate from the unknowing in-universe fan girls.
-   In the anime adaptation of **Hidamari Sketch**, it is related by Chika that Sae received Valentine's Day chocolates from girls when she was in junior high.
-   In **Zekkyou Gakkyuu**, one Valentine's Day story has a shy girl making handmade chocolates for her boyfriend. **Horrifically** subverted when it's revealed that she's not his girlfriend at all. She's his Stalker with a Crush who's so delusional that she **thinks** she's his girlfriend, all while blocking out how miserable she's making him and his real girlfriend. When she ignores his last attempt to get through to her and tries to give him her chocolates, he knocks them out of her hands. It only gets worse from there...
-   Tohru makes homemade Valentine's Day chocolate for Kobayashi in **Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid**, though Kobayashi refuses to eat them on the (correct) assumption that she spiked them with some sort of love potion. Kanna also makes chocolate for Saikawa in her spin-off series.
-   The Dark Agency shamelessly takes advantage of the situation in **Codename: Sailor V**, with Debrine using Valentine's Day as the occasion to sell chocolate so good it's addictive, so everyone in town will get fat and, in the attempt to get slim again, they'll go at her shop where she can drain their energy — but not their fat, as she has the looks of a Big Beautiful Woman and wants everyone to look like it. It was also effective: in the entire Minato Ward, the only ones who escaped were Hikaru, who was on a diet and didn't care of the Valentine traditions, Wakagi, who hated sweets and ran like hell every time someone tried to give him the chocolate, and Minako, who, upon noticing she was getting fat, started exercising like a madwoman to lose weight and got so obsessed with it she not only ended up getting it back in muscles but **missed Valentine's Day entirely**.
-   **Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun**:
    -   Nozaki, being a Shoujo mangaka, loves Valentine's Day and spends the whole day running around watching girls give boys chocolate. At the end of the day, his classmates are confused when he's so happy despite not getting any chocolate himself.
    -   However, he finds White Day chocolates to be boring and not fun to draw, so he tells girls he hates it, making them think he's selfish and just wants chocolate without having to give anyone any.
    -   Sakura **tries** to give Nozaki chocolates of her own, but can't keep up with him running all over the school to find romantic material for his manga. In the end she eats them herself.
    -   Kashima wants to give her senpai Hori homemade chocolates, but he hates homemade sweets, so she disguises them as store-bought ones.
-   **The Quintessential Quintuplets**: As Valentine's Day approaches, Miku spends a lot of her free time trying to learn how to make chocolates for Fuutarou. It's quite a challenge for her because, one, she doesn't like chocolate herself, and two, she's a Lethal Chef, to the point she needs some help from Nino to make sure they're tasty enough.

-   **Wonder Woman** Vol 1: Back in the Golden Age Etta Candy giving chocolate to a love interest—like Oscar Sweetgulper or Pierre Marchand—was a sign things were getting serious, and a love interest giving her chocolate was a good way for them to have a chance at actually starting a relationship.

        **Peter:** Cocoa. By Chanel.

He happily eats it out of her hand.

Chocolate of Romance Example in Visual Novels

-   Most of Voltage, Inc.'s romance games get a Valentine's Day Episode side story sooner or later, and the protagonist's efforts to present her love interest with handmade chocolate for the holiday feature prominently in all of them. Drama caused by lost, stolen, or damaged chocolate is also common, as are various other obstacles ranging from cross-cultural confusion to angst when the guy in question seems to have accepted chocolate from another girl.
    -   In the "A Chocolate Kiss" side story of **Love Letter from Thief X**, the chocolate goes missing before the protagonist gets the chance to give it to her lover, in most cases requiring extreme measures to track it down and get it back in edible condition.
    -   The "Black Valentine's Day" side story in **10 Days with My Devil** requires the protagonist to explain the tradition to the demons, most of whom don't know enough about human culture to be familiar with the holiday and its customs. Not all of them manage to wrap their brains around the significance: Kakeru, for example, takes a while to grasp that the protagonist putting her feelings into the chocolate she's made for him does not mean it literally contains her soul.
    -   **Be My Princess**, **My Forged Wedding**, **My Sweet Bodyguard**, and **Class Trip Crush** also include Valentine's side stories focusing mostly or entirely on the protagonist's desire to give her guy homemade chocolate, and in most cases his eager expectation of receiving it.

Chocolate of Romance Example in Real Life

-   In Japan, Valentine's Day was commercially imported from the West by chocolate/candy companies, where the idea is for ladies to give gifts of chocolate to gentlemen they like. This idea is so popular and important that some artistic representations of the act even have the woman giving herself with chocolate poured all over her body. White Day was later invented for March 14, where guys "return" the sentiments with a gift of their own. The usual method is that of giving him homemade chocolate and cookies, packaged in an embroidered handkerchief and tied with a ribbon. Sometimes, it will involve a handmade sweater as well.
    -   It should be noted that there are two general classifications for the chocolates given to men on Valentine's. Homemade or premium-grade/expensive **honmei choco** follows the traditionally romantic connotations of the day as it is meant for women to give to men they are romantically involved with (a husband or boyfriend) or interested in (as a way to confess their feelings), while the cheaper **giri choco** is meant for work colleagues and acquaintances, and **tomo choco** is meant for friendships.
-   In the West it was generally common practice for a gentleman to give a lady, either for going out or on Valentine's day, a box of chocolates and/or flowers. Sometimes, a greeting card was also included. In the cases where this is still practiced, the receivers of said box are usually women over the age of 40 or 50. (Or going out with a fellow whose mother taught him how to treat a woman.)
-   The aforementioned association between chocolates and romance is why, to this day, chocolates and other sweets are common Valentine's Day gifts. As such, grocery stores and convenience stores will have sales on candy around Valentine's Day, and young children often see Valentine's Day as a day where they get candy from their friends and family members rather than a day about romance.
-   According to various studies, chocolate (especially of the dark variety) is one of the recommended foods that you can eat before having sex. Chocolate triggers feelings of relaxation, intoxication, and pleasure. It also releases mood-boosting, stress-reducing serotonin, stimulates physical contact desires and lowers inhibitions.
    -   Subverted in that, due to the above-mentioned effect, people tend to eat lots of chocolate when lovesick. Chocolate also mitigates the negative side effects of love. If it's really bad, anti-depressants may be more effective in the serotonin-increasing department.
