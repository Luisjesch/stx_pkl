All Guys Want Cheerleaders: 
Two, Four, Six, Eight, who gets every guy that's straight?

_"I'm sexy! I'm cute!  
I'm popular to boot!  
I'm bitchin'! Great hair!  
The boys all want to stare!  
\[...\]  
We cheer and we lead! We act like we're on speed!  
Hate us 'cause we're beautiful, well we don't like you either  
We're cheerleaders! We! Are! Cheerleaders!"_

— **The Rancho Carne cheerleading squad**, _Bring It On_

In almost no movie or TV show from the USA that has one will you find a male character who finds cheerleaders anything other than a turn-on. This, despite the fact that the cheerleaders are almost universally presented as shallow, bitchy and led by the Alpha Bitch.

It might have something to do with the (greater or lesser) element of sexual titillation in many of the cheers, the athleticism they display or their often revealing outfits that expose their midriffs and legs. Besides being a lifesaver for people who hate sports but like girls, a little sexual excitement can boost the transient testosterone of the competitors, or at least remind the crypto-warriors of 'what they're fighting for', as well as who they don't want to be embarrassed in front of...

This is part of the same syndrome that leads to Hollywood Homely. Most American television also banks on the idea their viewing audience may not have gone to college but did go to high school, where cheerleaders were prominent, attractive, and unattainable.

It is worth noting that Reality Is Unrealistic in terms of the girls' outfits. Fictional cheerleaders often perform in uniforms that wouldn't be allowed in a high school. In real life, sleeves are optional (and usually reserved for colder weather), but bellies are covered and skirts are fingertip-length. Not that it really matters, since cheerleaders on screen are usually played by adults anyway.

It should be stressed again that while cheerleaders are universally seen as _sexy_ in American TV and movies it is by no means a certainty that the male lead will end up with them; indeed they will often be depicted as a vindictive Alpha Bitch or shallow Brainless Beauty who will be dumped in favor of a Girl Next Door or any array of Hollywood Homely or Endearingly Dorky unpopular girls.

-   Suzuna, the head cheerleader for the Deimon Devilbats in **Eyeshield 21** took the place of Sena's love interest (To a broad extent) after the writer seemed to want Mamori and Hiruma. Though this is a bit of a variation as Suzuna is the least developed of the cheerleaders along with the fact that, as a shounen series about football, the romance between the two isn't very developed either.
    -   Although she's the lead's love interest, in a subversion, it's the team's manager who's wanted by most of the guys.
-   Lina from **Heroman** doesn't conform to the usual stereotypes, being neither an Alpha Bitch nor a Brainless Beauty, and actually shows a liking for Joey. And the only people who object to any interaction between these two are Lina's brother and his friends.

All Guys Want Cheerleaders Example in Films — Live-Action

-   Played with in **A History of Violence**, where Tom Stall's wife decides that since they didn't grow up together, he deserves a night with a cheerleader. Turns out she can still fit into her old cheerleading uniform, or had one specially made...
-   Played straight and subverted in **American Beauty.** Kevin Spacey's character becomes infatuated with his daughter's cheerleader friend, Angela to the point of having weird fantasies about her in the middle of her routine. However, one of her classmates pointedly ignores her in favor of depressed, introverted Jane. Jane, ironically, is also a cheerleader, but so far from the stereotype that she doesn't really count.
-   Parodied in **Animal House**. Budding playboy (and future gynecologist) Otter subverts the main cheerleader's romance (such as it is) with the college jock by cheating with her (and getting further than he does). True to her archetype, she casually blows him off and dismisses his performance, the only blow to his persona that occurs. He consoles himself by seducing and satisfying the wife of the Dean of the college.
-   **Bottoms**: The cheerleader characters (Brittany, Isabel, and Stella-Rebecca), are universally seen as beautiful and desirable by people around them, especially by the female protagonists PJ and Josie, and frequently indulge in fanservice of their own volition. Isabel is also dating star quarterback Jeff. And while Josie is able to genuinely connect with and romance Isabel, PJ's interest in Brittany is implied to start and stop at how she's a hot, popular cheerleader.
-   Double Subverted with Brian Flagg in **The Blob (1988)**. He doesn't show much interest in Meg at first, but they end up together by the end of the movie.
-   Mocked in **Bowfinger**. Eddie Murphy's main character keeps getting in trouble for exposing himself to the LA Lakers cheerleaders. It's how they blackmail him into doing the movie at the end.
-   **Bring It On**: Most notably Cliff from the first movie, but a **lot** of men across the franchise. This is the reasoning behind the bikini car wash as a fundraising effort in the first movie.
-   In **But I'm a Cheerleader**, Megan is a cheerleader and is dating a football player. When accused of being gay, she uses her being a cheerleader as proof of her heterosexuality. Subverted in that she actually is gay (although in denial about it) and seems to quite enjoy being around the other cheerleaders herself.
-   **Can't Buy Me Love** from 1987... can a nerd find true love with a cheerleader?
-   Main selling point of **Cheerleader Camp**.
-   In **Dead Poets Society**, Chris is a cheerleader, and while this doesn't seem to make a difference for Knox, it probably has something to do with why she's with Chet, a football player.
-   Played for laughs in **DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story**: the teenage member of the gym is in love with a cheerleader at his school - however, his response to try and win her over is to join the cheerleading team himself. It's subverted, however, that the cheerleader is clearly in love with him as well, but he's a little too geeky to actually realize this.
-   **Fired Up!** plays this for comedy. Two of the most popular guys in school ditch football camp to go to cheer camp, originally for no other reason than to score with all the female cheerleaders. In the end, they end up **enjoying** being male cheerleaders, and for one of them, lust is replaced by love.
-   **A Face in the Crowd** presents the 1950s version of this trope when Lonesome Rhodes returns to his hometown of Pickett, Arkansas to judge the local high-school girls in a baton-twirling competition. Near the beginning of this scene, the drum majorettes are doing an old-fashioned Scatting-like cheer with some not so old-fashioned bumps and grinds. Lonesome makes a corny introductory speech extolling baton twirling as "an honest-to-God American art form" and knowing "just how hard it is to do it right." The camera angles during the contest itself suggest rather less wholesome intentions in mind, not to mention his immediately subsequent elopement with the contest winner, a curvaceous seventeen-year-old by the name of Betty Lou Fleckum.
-   Played with in **The Gals Of Galaday** in that more attractive girls aren't cheerleaders to begin with, but still get most of the attention.
-   **The Goonies**: In Brand's case it’s a girl who happens to be a cheerleader.
-   Somewhat lampshaded in **Grosse Pointe Blank**, as the character played by Jeremy Piven confesses that despite all of his successes, he feels worthless without gaining the attention of the Alpha Bitch from high school.
-   Averted in **High School Musical**. There aren't any major cheerleader characters until #3, and even then, the only reference we get to a date with a cheerleader (in this case, Jason wanting to date Martha, the hip-hop loving nerd) is in a deleted scene.
-   **Gregory's Girl**: Dorothy immediately becomes the most popular girl in school when she joins the soccer team, gaining her a lot of attention from the boys, much to Gregory's frustration.

-   Heather from **John Tucker Must Die**. Kate later joins the cheer leading squad in order to get John's attention.
-   Inverted in **Juno**: the titular character observes that guys are secretly more attracted to the edgy oddball girls than the generic cheerleaders. This is perhaps wishful thinking from Juno, who is an oddball girl herself.
    -   Although it's pretty understated, Steve the cool kid is seen staring at her a couple of times during the movie.

-   A deleted scene from **The Last Seduction** has Bridget dressing up as a cheerleader for Mike.
-   In **Little Giants** Kevin exploits this to convince Becky to become one instead of a player in order to attract his attention.
-   In **Lord of War**, Andre Baptiste, Jr., the Ax-Crazy son of an African dictator, has a troupe of women in tow with him dressed as the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders.

-   Subverted in **My Best Friend is a Vampire**. Blonde cheerleader Candy is nowhere near subtle about being interested in Jeremy, who is completely indifferent to her and fascinated with nerdy Darla.
-   **The New Guy** has this, with a few twists along the way.
-   In **Quantum Apocalypse**, Leo's girlfriend Lindsey is a blonde cheerleader whose creepy ex-boyfriend Sean is still obsessed with her.
-   **The Replacements (2000)**: Shane falls for the gorgeous head cheerleader for the Sentinels but in his defense, she's sweet, funny, and probably knows more about football than he does...even if she does drive like a maniac. She's also a cheerleader who owns a sports bar. That **has** to be a Geeky Turn-On for sports fans.
-   The less nerdy nerd in **Revenge of the Nerds** finds a compatible girlfriend, a quietly pretty girl-next-door who shares his love of computers. However, the Chief Nerd will not rest until he has had the Chief Jock's Cheerleader, who also happens to be the Alpha Bitch of the story. Breaking not only the trope but also a few laws of the universe; **he actually wins her over in the end**.
-   Subverted in **Saved!** in that Patrick is willing to hang out with the Alpha Bitch but is really interested in very non-cheerleader Mary.
-   Averted in **Sky High (2005)** with Penny. Nobody in the film seems to consider her particularly attractive, at least not in comparison to the more "preppy" Gwen.
-   On almost a stalkery level in **Sugar & Spice**.
-   Subtle, but there in **Unfriended**. The main character, Blaire, is a cheerleader and apparently good enough to win a trophy, which you can see in the background during some shots of her room. She highlights her bruised knees and does a flirt based cheer with Mitch after she promises to have sex with him after prom during the opening of the film. Mitch's best friend, Adam, also secretly likes Blaire and already had sex with her behind Mitch's back, twice.

-   Averted by Mox in **Varsity Blues**, who actually turns down a cheerleader because he prefers his girlfriend.
-   Essentially the premise of **The Wrong Cheerleader**. Despite being physically attractive and likeable, none of the male students are interested in the protagonist Becky until she makes the high school cheerleading team - which gets her noticed by a crazed stalker.

-   Averted by Jalil in **Everworld**, or so Christopher claims.
    
    **Christopher**: When you go to the library, you actually do research instead of downloading pictures of naked cheerleaders, don't you? You are a very, very disturbed young man.
    
-   **Sweet Valley High**'s Jessica Wakefield was head cheerleader and had a different boyfriend every book. The other members of the squad did pretty well too.
-   Played as background in **John Ringo**'s **Troy Rising**: several characters are doing a background analysis on Tyler Vernon in order to get him to agree with their plans. One of their points is confusion over Tyler's relationship with Dana Parker, who they thought was his girl-friend but actually isn't. Part of their analysis is that Tyler, who is the richest and most powerful business man in the Solar System by several orders of magnitude, perceives Dana as socially superior to him because "back in high school, Tyler was a low status nerd and Dana was high status as a cheerleader".

Denny find this to be quite exciting, as does his friend and fellow Shirley-admirer Alan Shore when Denny shares this information with him. In a later episode, the two men find the uniform in a box (presumably left there by Shirley herself to cheer them up), and they dance with it while making alternatingly affectionate and lewd comments about it. To be fair, both Alan and Denny were sexually attracted to Shirley long before they knew about her cheerleading tendencies.
-   In **The Brady Bunch** episode **Greg’s Triangle** Jennifer Nichols knows **exactly** how to play Greg's sweet spot and weakness for hot-looking chicks, especially when she is so wanting that head cheerleader spot.
-   **Buffyverse**:

        **Xander**: Who said I was pretending?
        
    -   In **Him** RJ's friend hears about the cheerleader tryouts and asks if the girls are going to be jumping up and down a lot. And later...
        
        **Buffy**: You shredded my outfit.  
        **Dawn**: I'll buy you a new one.  
        **Buffy**: That's not the point. I don't want a new cheerleading outfit.  
        **Xander**: Now, now, let's not be hasty...

-   On **Flash Forward (1996)** Tucker starts off with a crush on Kerry.

-   On **Friends**, Rachel claimed that she had never failed to score when wearing her cheerleader uniform, leading to her donning it at a party in a desperate attempt to win the attention of one particular guy. It almost doesn't work, he's newly-divorced and Rachel's coming on way too strong, but at the end of the episode he agrees to go to her place for coffee. As she lets the guy into her apartment Rachel turns to Chandler, waves her hand over the uniform and points out that it worked again.
-   Subverted on **Glee**. Finn the star quarterback is dating 'Cheerio' Quinn, however not only is he attracted to Genki Girl Rachel but he is also sexually frustrated due to Quinn also being president of the celibacy club. It should also be noted that all the female celibacy club members are cheerios and all the male members are guys just trying to get into their pants.

-   **MAD**'s parody of **Glee** had the Sue Sylvester stand-in loudly explain that the only reason for the gratuitous sexy cheerleader scenes is to appeal to the straight male demographic that doesn't care about the musical numbers.

All Guys Want Cheerleaders Example in Music

-   The Cheer Up, Charlie Daniels song "Pig Tails" is about one of these guys realizing that his girlfriend's a Cruel Cheerleader. (She's already a cheerleader, but as far as personality goes.) He notes that she "used to be sweeter", indicating that she may have been nicer before.
-   Averted in **The Midnight Beast**’s "Booty Call", they'd rather engage in a Ho Yay\-filled slumber party.
-   Subverted in OMI's "Cheerleader." While the lyrics make it seem like this trope applies (the chorus does "Oh I think I found myself a cheerleader"), the rest of the song makes it clear she's a metaphorical cheerleader, in that she's supportive and roots for him no matter what.
