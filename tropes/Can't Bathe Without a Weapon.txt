Can't Bathe Without a Weapon: 
"Ask me if I want a towel one... more... time..."

_"Yeah, except my gun's all soapy. Pretty stupid to bathe with a gun...."_

When a character is bathing it's not unusual for someone to barge in on them, or for them to be interrupted by something, or for something to attack them. But then said bather suddenly pulls out a gun to try to shoot the intruder. Or draw a blade and try to stab them, if firearms aren't an option. This indicates that the bather is an anticipator, Crazy-Prepared or Properly Paranoid type of person that does not like to feel vulnerable. They also usually don't have modesty as a priority.

The weapon is normally just placed within reach of said bather, but sometimes they may simply produce it from Hammerspace. This commonly happens in Outdoor Bath Peeping scenarios, but can also happen in Shower, Furo or Bathtub Scenes.

If Played for Laughs this can result in the intruder suffering a Pervert Revenge Mode or Unprovoked Pervert Payback from the armed bather. If it's Played for Drama a Full-Frontal Assault between bather and the intruder is likely to take place.

If the bather improvises something in the area as a weapon see Improvised Weapon. If they employ their _towel_ as said weapon, see Cloth Fu. If the bather starts throwing random objects at the intruder, see Tantrum Throwing. If their clothes, weapons, or equipment are stolen from them while they're bathing see Gone Swimming, Clothes Stolen.

See also Pillow Pistol for a character that keeps a weapon under the pillow as they sleep and Hidden Supplies for keeping hidden stashes of supplies and Where's My Gun? for a character struggling to find their weapon in a tense situation.

-   In **The Caves of Steel**, the future-NYPD rules require this; Elijah keeps his blaster (in a waterproof holster) with him whilst showering. As restroom and shower facilities are communal (though socially still "private" as men are expected to ignore each other) and securable lockers seem nonexistent the rule logically follows.
-   **A Certain Magical Index**: Touma and his father learn the hard way that Kaori keeps her nodachi with her when she bathes when they walk in on her just as she's coming out.
-   In the Charlie Parker Series, a flashback to Louis and Angel's first meeting has Louis emerge from the shower and pull a gun on Angel, who has broken into his apartment and is attempting to steal his television.

-   In the first **Doom** novel, Flynn Taggart decides to risk taking a shower in the Phobos Lab infirmary. He takes the trouble to lock the doors and turn off the lights except for the one in the shower stall and keeps his trusty shotgun within arm's reach.

He gets attacked **immediately** after leaving the infirmary though.
-   **Dragonlance Chronicles**: In **Dragons of Winter Night** when Silvara hears Gilthanas watching her bathe, she runs over to her clothes.

He offhandedly tells them that he takes it everywhere — sleeps with it, bathes with it, goes to the fresher with it... He's **probably** just messing with them, of course; even in Wraith Squadron, someone carrying a meter-long laser rifle on his person at all times would have earned him some weird looks.
-   In **Lord Marksman and Vanadis**, when Tigre accidentally walks in on Ludmila's bath, he discovers she keeps her Ancestral Weapon Lavias (a magical pole-arm of ice), with her at all times and finds her pointing it at his neck in no time. But he's actually more worried over her coming out of the water naked and tells her to Please Put Some Clothes On, but she scoffs at the idea, since she finds no shame in being seen naked by someone she considers to be lower than an animal and eventually simply smacks him with Lavias's shaft.
-   In **Matadora**, Dirisha Zuri is told that the bathrooms are not off-limits in Matador Villa's running spetsdöd-tag game, and to therefore use the following procedure when washing her hands: take off one spetsdöd, wash that hand, put the spetsdöd back on, then do the same with the other hand.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

Needless to say, the neighbors are a little freaked out by a naked guy firing a gun.
-   **Strike the Blood**: Kujo finds out Yukina keeps her lance with her when she bathes after accidentally wandering near where she was bathing and suddenly having the tip of her spear at his neck while she warned him not to turn around.

-   **Legend of the Seeker**: Averted in "Mirror" when two thieves hatch a plot to steal Richard's Sword of Truth. One of them gets disguised as Kahlan via a magical mirror and she coyly tries to convince Richard to go Skinny Dipping with her in a lake. Richard is reluctant to bathe without his sword, but she turns up the sex appeal and tells him to loosen up and she gets him hooked when her Dress Hits Floor and they're soon both frolicking in the water while her partner successfully steals the sword he left in the bank. When the real Kahlan finds out, she's less than pleased.

-   The **Forgotten Realms** spell "Laeral's Gesture" is the result of Laeral being tired of being attacked while bathing, and thus not having her spell components on hand (it quickly fires any currently available low-level spell, skipping its material or verbal components).

-   In a scene cut from the US release of **Breath of Fire IV**, Ryu sneaks in upon Nina and Ursula conversing while enjoying a hot spring (after Nina told him not to, no less) in an island the group is currently stranded on. The moment his curiosity gets the better of him and he tries to take a peek, he finds out that Ursula apparently prefers to soak with her firearm close by. See for yourself. In fact, given that there was literally **zero** reaction time between him starting to peek and the rock he was hiding behind getting shot, she probably heard him and knew he was there the whole time, just waiting for him to try his luck.
-   **Crush Crush**: Claudia takes her BFS with her everywhere including the showers, and even **spoons** with the blade in bed.
-   **Disgaea 3**: In the Vita remake, the Kunoichi's "Three Year Crush Kill" special has up to five enemies peep on her in the middle of a bath. The second she figures out she's being peeped on, she hurls multiple Kunai into their faces. **Disgaea 5** updates the skill with one last batch of Kunai being hurled at the camera, briefly cracking it.
-   In a cutscene in **God Hand**, Olivia is talking to Gene while taking a bubble bath and pulls an ax from under the bubbles to discourage him from getting too close. (Of course, **she's** crazy, and Gene's not known for keeping his hands to himself.)
-   **Hitman: Codename 47**: In the Thermal Bath Hotel, the pool guy will direct you to the changing booth where you'll find some complimentary swimming trunks. If you wish, you can pick up your weapons after changing (and magically stuff them into your chest, mind you), but it's not necessary to shoot anyone.
-   Not a gun, but in **The Granstream Saga**, the hero sneaks onto a flying vessel in a treasure box. Said treasure box is delivered to the female leader's personal quarters. The hero sneaks out of the box at just the right time (said leader is taking a shower in the same room), said female leader notices and throws a **battle axe** across the room, barely missing his head and comes out of the shower dressed in a Modesty Towel and holding a massive **morning star**.
-   **Kid Icarus: Uprising:** Hot springs scattered around the chapters serve as healing points but are also used by many characters for recreational purposes. According to a conversation between Pit and Magnus in Chapter 2, "the angel's code of conduct states that \[angels\] must always be ready for duty"; this means going into a hot spring fully dressed and armed doesn't just happen in gameplay.
-   **Looters of Dystopia**: Hatsuki's sprite still has her sword even when she's bathing.
-   In **Mass Effect 3**, a background NPC character called Aeian T'Goni is a Shell-Shocked Veteran from an incident where she found herself helpless when the farm she was guardian was attacked while she showered without her gear. What followed was a horrible, horrible line of traumatic events. It wasn't funny at all and as a result, she requests permission to carry a firearm in the bathroom. If you use your Spectre status to let her have a gun, she uses it to kill herself.
-   **No More Heroes**:
    -   Averted at a critical moment: Travis doesn't have his beam katana when Ermen Palmer attacks him on the toilet, almost costing him his life.
    -   A nod to this is in the sequel, which upholds this trope — Travis keeps all his beam katanas on his belt at all times in the sequel, most likely due to the above incident.
-   **The Operative: No One Lives Forever**: Cate isn't attacked in the Shower Scene, but you can see she's ready for that contingency, as her handy revolver is right there.
-   **Rage of Bahamut**: The artwork for Bloody Mary has her lounging in a bathtub while having her rusted blade right by her side.
-   **Shadow Warrior (1997)**: Follow the singing to find a woman taking a Waterfall Shower. But watch out, she only looks unarmed. If the Player Character stands too close his pickup lines will lead her to whip out an Uzi.
-   While not a gun, in **Summon Night: Swordcraft Story 2**, when The Protagonist is asked why they always carry their smith hammer around (Which they just used to defeat a monster.) They reply by pointing out, as a Craftknight, they carry their hammer around with them EVERYWHERE. (They mention taking it to the bathroom, so it's not too much to assume they also bathe with it)
-   **The Witcher 3**: During the "Get Junior" quest in Novigrad Geralt goes to talk to Dijkstra in a Public Bathhouse, since it's a meeting ground for the heads of the big four crime syndicates in Novigrad as it ensures no one will be armed with anything but for a Modesty Towel. But Dijkstra is still Properly Paranoid enough to keep a hidden stash of weapons nearby **anyway**, which comes in handy when they're all attacked by Whoreson Junior's Mooks hoping to take advantage of their lack of equipment.
-   **Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana**: Adol first meeting with Laxia in Seiren is a fairly standard Accidental Pervert scenario where he walks on her bathing in a river. Granted, she's wearing a Modesty Towel, but it doesn't stay on for long since her reaction is to reach for her nearby rapier and attack him with it, but this proves to be a mistake when Adol parries her attack and it causes her to lose her grip on the towel, which pools at her feet. The player doesn't see anything beyond a Shoulders-Up Nudity shot of her covering herself while having a Naked Freak-Out. The scene ends with her Skyward Scream followed by a slap sound.

-   **Danny Phantom**: In the Made-for-TV Movie **Reality Trip**, Jack is shown to be so paranoid of ghosts that he even showers with his anti-ghost weaponry.

-   George MacDonald Fraser's way of describing the dangers of serving in the British Army in Palestine in 1946 was, "You took your service revolver into the shower with you." He was not exaggerating.
-   A variant: the legendary Miyamoto Musashi supposedly had poor personal hygiene because he refused to bathe very often, with the reasoning that even if you brought a weapon with you, you could be caught off guard too easily.
