Can-Crushing Cranium: 
**Wilson:** Well I decided that being a little bit more like you wouldn't hurt.  
_\[Wilson takes off his hat and crushes a beer can against his forehead\]_  
**Tim:** How do you feel now?  
**Wilson:** ...I hurt.

Crushing a can of beer or soda with your forehead.

Often starts by a drunken person wanting to show how tough they are, and hey, they just HAPPEN to have an empty beer can in their hand...

Sometimes it's a macho thing, and sometimes it's Played for Laughs. The most frequent variation involves the can being full, with resulting cranial trauma.

In Real Life, this could result in a concussion if you slam the thing against your head (as opposed to placing it there and applying steady pressure). Using a full can is especially not recommended, as these are strong enough for you to _stand_ on them.

It should also be noted that the ability to smash a can against one's forehead is not as impressive of a feat as it used to be, because modern beverage cans are made of thinner aluminum than vintage beverage cans (which were usually steel).

Can-Crushing Cranium Example in Literature

-   Invoked by Mr. Tulip, in **The Truth**, who smashes a bottle of alcohol against his forehead.

This is implied to be what causes the other customers in Biers to later lock the door in case Mr. Tulip and his partner come back. For those less familiar with Discworld, Biers is Ankh-Morpork's resident bar for the **undead**.
