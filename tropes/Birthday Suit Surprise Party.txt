Birthday Suit Surprise Party: 
_The door burst open she stood there,  
With all of me mates from the docks,  
And they all sang "Happy Birthday to You,"  
And all I had on were my socks._

Nakedness. Nobody ever gets tired of it. The exact reasons for being naked are irrelevant, for inevitably the time must come when we must end this plot. Cast aside the foolishness of a naked person traipsing around the universe gay as a chickadee, and finally have them safely at home where the nakedness can bother no one and so—

SURPRISE!

Well, so much for the comfort and all that. Looks like at just the right time, nakedness has become funny again. Because after all, as far as embarrassing humor goes, it's hard to top having all your friends and family see you without any clothes on while celebrating your arrival into this world (amusingly enough, in the same state as you were back then).

Usually the disrobing happens for a deliberate reason. The character in question is under the impression that he or she is about to get some. Oh, you adorable sex hounds! Obviously, this does not show up so much in G-rated versions, which rather involve Naked People Trapped Outside.

This trope is based off an old story, as Snopes explains here and here. The Reveal of the surprise guests almost always ends the story — very rarely does the party happen and then we see what happens next.

See also Caught with Your Pants Down. Compare Open the Door and See All the People. A Naked Freak-Out is an entirely justified reaction. It's nearly always a birthday party, making this a subtrope of Birthday Party Goes Wrong.

Birthday Suit Surprise Party Example in Films — Live-Action

-   The title moment of **American Pie** - even funnier, more explicit and more em-bare-assing in the unrated DVD version.
-   Played With in **Chalet Girl** - Kim is having her birthday party at the Chalet she works on and she and her friends are hanging out in the hot tub when a drunk Kim climbs out of it naked to dance in the snow... just as the Chalet owners arrive to catch her naked, including her Love Interest.

-   Subverted in the film **In Good Company**, where Dennis Quaid's character guesses about the surprise party and comes in his underwear as a joke.
-   Happens in the movie **Riding The Bullet** as the main character is contemplating slitting his wrists.
-   Although the party's not for him, this still happens to Patrick Dempsey's character in the movie **Some Girls**.

Birthday Suit Surprise Party Example in Live-Action TV

-   There was a sketch on **The Benny Hill Show** involving a man being invited back to his girlfriend's flat. She leaves to "slip into something more comfortable". He strips off in the expectation of sex, then all of his friends leap out shouting, "Surprise!"
-   Happens to Jeri Ryan's character in **Boston Public**. She strips down to just a shirt for some goodbye sex with her ex-boyfriend in the office, only to be surprised by everyone jumping out and shouting "Surpri\**\**ohh."
    
    "OK, you got me."
    
-   **Coupling** has a wonderfully Exaggerated variation of this. Jeff's Love Interest blindfolds him in the office after hours and says she has a surprise for him. He jumps to the understandable conclusion that she was going to have sex with him right then and there. So, happily singing to himself, he triumphantly dances around the room stripping off every last item. At which point the Love Interest returns — **with his parents** — and reveals there was a room full of people waiting to surprise him for his birthday party, and they'd been standing there watching the whole strip in mute horror. Still, it ends better for Jeff than any other example on this page, as the girlfriend herself found the whole thing a bit of a turn-on...
-   In the episode "War" from the **La Femme Nikita** TV series, assassins break into Nikita's apartment. They thought they'd get the drop on her. They're wrong.
-   Happens to Kenan on **Kenan & Kel**, although he was not completely naked—just below the waist.
-   An episode of **L.A. Law** also does the "in anticipation of sex" version.
-   The Cinemax show **Life On Top** manages to invert this trope: being the kind of show that it is, all of the **guests** are naked - then when the birthday girl shows up, it's with her parents in tow...
-   An early **Newhart** episode has a mild version of this, with Joanna showing up at the surprise party in a black negligee.
-   **That '70s Show** has a clothed version of this by crossing it over with Raging Stiffie. Eric has an Erotic Dream about what sort of "gift" Donna might give him for his birthday, only to wake up to family yelling "Surprise!" and serving him breakfast in bed. His parents don't seem to notice how embarrassed he is, but his sister Laurie snarks "Nice tent" before following them out of the room.

-   "Splish Splash" by Bobby Darin is about a guy taking a bath on a Saturday night, getting out of the tub and leaving the bathroom, and finding there's a party going on in his house when he's just got a towel on.

Birthday Suit Surprise Party Example in Western Animation

-   Happens in the NFB's **Bob's Birthday**, the animated short on which **Bob and Margaret** was based. In this case the guests never get to yell "Surprise!"; they just stay in their hiding places and endure the awkward conversation that follows.
-   **Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends**. "I Only Have Surprise for You" Bloo arranges a surprise party for Mac, just as he got out of the bathtub and all the towels were gone. Bloo does this same prank again, only this time, he provides Mac with a ballerina costume.

When Hamton finally makes it home, a surprise party is awaiting him and Plucky was aware of it. Note that this time, we do see what happens next: Hamton uses a "happy birthday" banner as a loincloth and starts eating the cake.
-   Variation on **The Venture Brothers**: it's the Monarch's birthday, and he takes hostages Brock and Hank to his lair, where Dr. Girlfriend surprises him wearing panties and a strategically placed bow — he's embarrassed, she isn't.
