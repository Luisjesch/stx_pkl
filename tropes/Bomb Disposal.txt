Bomb Disposal: 
Here, it's a metaphor. But it's always a good metaphor.

_"Some days you just can't get rid of a bomb!"_

Bombs, mines, and other explosives are a lethal threat, and sometimes, you have to disarm them rather than go around them, if they're blocking your way, hidden, or threaten the whole block/city. In fiction, our talented heroes can quickly and safely set them off (from a safe distance), disarm them before continuing on, throw them far away, or, if they're a cartoon character or huge monster, eat them, etc.

In Real Life, this isn't so easy. Even a bomb disposal expert with proper equipment finds it dangerous and difficult to disarm explosives. And it's probably worse if you have to set them off using nothing but a stick, or defuse them with nail clippers. Thankfully, in the 2020s, police have remote controlled robots that help make the job a little safer. Hence why this trope is a subtrope of Artistic License – Explosives.

In shows where physics is on a vacation, such as kids' cartoons, expect people to do things like swallowing the bomb or stuffing it into a not even nearly bombproof container, like a paper bag. See also Bombproof Appliance for more "serious" shows.

Gritty, realistic war movies and police shows may have a fairly accurate depiction of bomb disposal. Blockbuster action movies tend to depict defusing as simply a matter of choosing the right colored wire to snip; of course, if our hero is wearing Plot Armor, they'll always snip the right wire at the last second.

Truth in Television is that bomb and mine disposal is stressful and dangerous, even for the most seasoned professionals.

Bomb Disposal Example in Anime & Manga

-   **Desert Rose**: Given all the terrorists in the manga, naturally the protagonists have had to deal with bomb threats on a regular basis, with Jessica and Colleen's job focusing entirely on this. One story arc entirely focused on Jessica dealing with a new model of particularly tamper-proof time bombs that were filled with all sorts of booby traps.
-   **Excel♡Saga**: One of Ropponmatsu I's skills.
-   **Gunsmith Cats** has a few chapters here and there devoted to Minnie May or her boyfriend Ken Taki defusing bombs.
-   **Night Raid 1931** has a more realistic take on bomb disposal in the third episode: Two are moved using psychic powers to relatively safe places to blow up, while the third is disarmed after Yukina is able to read the memories of the man who built the bomb.
-   Multiple instances in **Terror in Resonance**. In the most applicable, a character is held hostage in a vest full of explosives on a timer. Another races to disarm them all before they go off and kill both parties.

Bomb Disposal Example in Comic Books

-   In the **Superman** story "Time And Time Again Again", the quantum field generator that Superman and the Metal Men try carefully to extract from a pile of wreckage in Metropolis becomes volatile and ready to explode. Superman tries to fly it safely away from Metropolis, but it ends up exploding...though its explosion is stopped in its process by Liri Lee of the Linear Men transporting both the generator and Superman to Vanishing Point to study it. The Linear Men, however, have no interest in stopping the bomb from exploding and killing people in Metropolis, but Waverider, seeing what their technology can do, takes one of their time-travel controls and uses it to transport the generator to the distant past, where it explodes harmlessly without hurting anyone.

-   **Godzilla (2014)**: Subverted. Ford's job in the army is defusing bombs, but he's unable to manually defuse the timer on the modified nuke in San Francisco because the MUTOs' goo has welded the casing shut. Instead, he gets rid of the nuke by putting it in a motorboat and sending it out to sea before the countdown hits zero.
-   **Godzilla Minus One**. Shikishima takes on the well-paid but dangerous work of clearing the thousands of sea mines laid in Japanese waters during the war. Clearing involves two small boats made of wood (to avoid setting off magnetic mines) towing a cable between them to cut the mine's tether so it will float to the surface and be detonated with gunfire. When Godzilla makes an appearance, they are ordered to use some of these cleared mines to try and stop it. Naturally the crew think this is even more suicidal than their usual job.
-   **Heimat** features Otto and Pieritz, two engineers, and later, EOD Technicians. Otto dies.

-   **James Bond** has naturally had to disarm bombs, typically nuclear, on more than one occasion.
    -   **Goldfinger** is apparently set before he's been trained in this, as he clearly as **no idea** how to disarm it.

With "007" reading on the timer.
    -   An interesting variation in **The Spy Who Loved Me**, where he isn't disarming an armed nuke, but instead removing the non-nuclear explosive from one in storage. Naturally there's a failsafe to prevent this, namely a magnetic ring that has to pull the explosive through (think **Operation**, with detonation for failure). He then uses the bomb to get into a secure room.
    -   In **Octopussy** he has to disarm a nuclear bomb. Fortunately, he saw how this one was armed, so all he has to do to disarm it is do the exact opposite. Just in Time, naturally.
    -   In **The World Is Not Enough**, the terrorists put a nuke on a tram in a pipeline and then send it off.

The first time fails, the second succeeds due to Julia reviving Ethan.
    -   **Mission: Impossible – Fallout**: The film's climax involves Ethan and co. disabling two nuclear bombs. The bombs are synchronized with each other, so both have to be defused simultaneously while the countdown is running. The fuse must also be pulled from the detonator before the countdown reaches zero, otherwise the bombs will detonate.
-   Played for Laughs in **Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell Of Fear**. Frank tries and fails to disarm a nuclear device before tripping over its power lead, pulling the plug from the socket, disabling the bomb.
-   In **Rambo**, the villains are shown using prisoners to clear minefields on two separate occasions. The second time shows this to be pure sadism rather than evil pragmatism when it is shown that the minefields are ones they make **themselves** just so they can do this and make bets about which prisoner will blow up first.
-   **Rewind (2013)**: Opens with an abandoned van discovered in Midtown Manhattan. Police call in a full bomb disposal squad when they open it up and discover the mass of cables and blinking lights hooked up to a timer.

He gingerly gropes underwater for the timer and disconnects it, breathing a sigh of relief. Unfortunately for him, the saboteurs had been taught to use **two** timers for redundancy.
-   On **M\*A\*S\*H**, a bomb lands in the compound but doesn't explode. The doctors are sent to defuse the bomb and are given step by step instructions.

The bomb explodes but fortunately it is full of propaganda, not explosives.
-   A few episodes of **MythBusters** address various methods of disposing of explosive devices. Many of them are ineffective, but a surprising number actually do work. The best strategy seems to be putting the bomb somewhere that **directs** the blast away from you (or any other innocents), preferably upwards, as attempting to contain the blast generally creates more harmful shrapnel.
-   **The Professionals**:
    -   In "Private Madness Public Danger", Bodie and Doyle have to defuse a bomb connected to a gallon drum of hallucinogenic drugs which is floating in a reservoir, so they have to do this while treading freezing water with a device that they're can't even see.

They use the same tactic in "Stakeout" this time with an **atomic** bomb.
    -   In "The Purging of CI5", Bodie dials the first number of his phone and suddenly realises it's booby-trapped. Fortunately, he's got his radio to call Doyle for help, who disarms it with their usual exchange of banter (though somewhat terser).

-   In **The Six Million Dollar Man** episode, "The Price of Liberty" (1975), the Liberty Bell is stolen, and rigged with three time bombs by an embittered explosives expert. Steve Austin and another bomb expert — a convicted criminal serving a prison sentence — disarm the bomb. Short on time, the convict suggests connecting wires to short out the timing mechanism, and Austin remembers the bomber's last dying words: Red, White, and Blue. They connect the red and white wires, and then Austin has a hunch that "blue" was deliberately misleading, "his final stab at the country he'd grown to hate," and correctly selects the yellow wire instead.

-   **Warhammer 40,000**:
    -   The Orks use Gretchin as primitive demining tools: throw one into the suspected minefield, let it walk around until it blows up, and throw another one in, repeat until completely cleared or bored, initiate WAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! charge. Not that Orks mind if other Orks get blown up, it's just funnier with gretchin.
    -   This is Also how General Chenkov of the Imperial Guard uses his men (other uses include bogging the enemy down and calling in artillery, or attacking fortresses without waiting for tanks). His losses are almost always near 100%, but he manages to win.

Run out of time or chances, and the bomb explodes, leading to a Non-Standard Game Over.
-   **Counter-Strike**: it's the whole point of the "bomb defusal" missions for the counter-terrorist team after the bomb is set by the terrorists. Normally takes a bit of time, but is faster if one has a "bomb defusal kit".
-   **DC Universe Online** has one mission where you throw The Joker's bombs off the nearby docks to defuse them.
-   One driving mission in **Die Hard Trilogy 2: Viva Las Vegas** has you delivering bombs to a disposal facility. One too many bumps makes your truck explode. Later, you have to evacuate a Time Bomb from Hoover Dam before it detonates.
-   Presented as an Unexpected Gameplay Change in **Death Stranding**. Most of the gameplay hinges around helping Sam deliver important cargo across the ruins of America from outpost to outpost, but at one point, he ends up being given a shady-looking package by an even-sketchier looking "maintenance worker", and upon investigating the contents, you'll find that it's a **thermonuclear bomb** that will explode in thirty minutes unchecked, and **immediately** if Sam lets go of it or it enters the city it was being delivered to. The only solution is to locate a massive tar pit through enemy-infested lines and chuck it in for a reduced explosion.
-   **Deus Ex: Human Revolution** has a bomb that can be defused by find out the code, hacking into it or shooting a hole in it<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>.

-   In **Half-Life 2**, Gordon can pick up Combine hopper mines with the Gravity Gun, which doesn't merely disarm them, but resets their target sensors to consider Gordon an ally. This is all due to some questionable design elements that weren't really **flaws** until the gravgun came along.
    -   And in Episode 2, you get to destroy one of the minespam choppers by throwing its mines at it.

-   The **Knights of the Old Republic** games enemy mines; using Awareness skill to notice them before you set them off, and demolitions skill to deal with them. With a high skill, you can disarm the mine or even recover it to use yourself. If your skill level wasn't high enough, the mine might go off (or the disarm can simply fail). A jedi character with an anti-droid force power can fire it to detonate the mine at a safe distance.
-   The **League of Legends** champion Ziggs (an explosive themed champ) has a joke the goes "You wanna see how to disarm a bomb?" he then swallows one of his bombs which explodes in his stomach.
-   **McPixel** is a game all about disposing of bombs in a number of ridiculous ways.
-   In **Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty**, bombs can be disarmed with a coolant spray that freezes them. Notably, the bomb disposal expert who gives the player the coolant spray stresses that they will **not** be actually permanently disassembling the bombs here, as that is no task for amateurs. However, the coolant spray will keep the detonators frozen, preventing them from going off long enough to bring in a formal bomb squad to more thoroughly deal with them later. The facility itself is later destroyed when Arsenal Gear starts up, rendering the question of bomb disposal moot.
-   **Minesweeper**
-   **Papers, Please**, one entrant drops a bomb in your booth. A guard comes and proceeds to mock how amateurish it is and how to disarm it. He doesn't even see it a good reason to close the checkpoint.
-   In **Ring of Red,** certain support units for the game's AFW's have the ability to lay a variety of mines (in order of leg-breakiness, Mines, Adhesion Mines, Chain Mines).

-   **Spider-Man 3** has many missions dedicated to disarming bombs left by the "H-Bombers" gang.
-   In **KOTOR**'s MMO sequel, **Star Wars: The Old Republic**, many quests often involve disarming bombs of some sort. No skill needed this time, as all it takes is a few seconds for any class.
    -   In the Trooper's first mission, players will destroy the Ord Mantel separatists' cache of explosives ordinance by kicking it with their foot and having it explode in their face. They're somehow fine afterwards.
-   **Suzuki Bakuhatsu**: The core of this game. You, as Suzuki, must dismantle the object carefully and fast to dispose the bomb which is planted inside that object.
-   **Team Fortress 2**: the Demoman's Sticky Bombs can be destroyed after they're planted by using any weapon that shoots bullets, any melee weapon (if one is brave enough), the Scottish Resistance, Detonator, Scorch Shot, or Short Circuit (which can destroy even sticky bombs that haven't landed and Grenades from the normal Grenade Launcher), or moved away using the Pyro's airblast or any sort of explosion.
-   **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants In Manhattan**: A recurring element in the game are timed segments where the turtles have to defuse bombs set by the Foot. The more turtles doing the disarming at a time, the faster it is.
-   **Trauma Center** is normally a surgery simulator. But in one mission you get to disarm a bomb instead. Conveniently, you get guidance from someone who has **dated** someone from the bomb defusal team. The mission was entirely redone for the wii port, but it's still a bomb being defused.
-   **Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon** has underside-mounted Light Lancers, which are used for firing at incoming torpedos and mines. Minelayers are also useful for this, in addition to their primary use of planting mines, as they have the largest number of underside-mounted Light Lancers out of any ship.
-   **The Ultimate Stuntman**: One of the gameplay styles is a bomb disposal. In it, you have to get rid of microchips by moving a tool and making sure there's always a path that lets you keep going. The number on the chip indicates how many times it must be touched, the ones with arrows push you in the respective direction, the goal chip must be reached last. The bomb acts as a time limit and if the spark goes down the fuse and reaches the bomb, you lose a life.
-   Engineers in **Valkyria Chronicles** and Armored Techs in **Valkyria Chronicles II** are the only classes able to clear away mines.

Prowl had limited flight capabilities and Bumblebee had rocket jets for that episode, so Bulkhead made the initial launch, Prowl lifted him higher and Bumblebee got even further, throwing the bomb into the lower stratosphere.
-   **Transformers: Prime**: To hide a virus that will transmit the Iacon Archive from the **Nemesis**, Ratchet and Wheeljack place a grenade inside Lazerbeak. When the Decepticons discover the active grenade, Megatron tasks Knock-Out to get rid of it as punishment for failing to acquire a relic before the Autobots can.
-   **Wallace & Gromit in A Matter of Loaf and Death**: A direct spoof of the Batman scene occurs as Gromit tries to get rid of a bomb, eventually settling for throwing it across the Yorkshire border. He fails, and the bomb ends up in Wallace's trousers; Gromit resorts to filling said trousers with dough to soften the impact. This leads to Wallace accidentally Mooning a couple of passing nuns.

Bomb Disposal Example in Real Life

-   Subversion: Archduke Franz Ferdinand was attacked by a Serbian terrorist group (supported by Serbian Military Intelligence) who threw a grenade into his car. He tossed it under the car behind him, killing several people but sparing the crowd. He was later successfully assassinated when his driver got lost on the way back from visiting the people who were hospitalized as a result of the earlier attack. The rest is history.
-   One design feature of many foxholes or trenches is something known as a "Grenade Sump". In essence, it's a deep hole or ditch in the bottom of the foxhole. If a bad guy tosses a grenade into the foxhole, kick it into the grenade sump, then get as far away from it as you can. The ground absorbs much of the explosion, and directs the rest upwards.
    -   Some cities use concrete garbage cans for a similar reason: If someone decides to drop an explosive device into a trashcan (a convenient hiding place in a crowded area), the shape of the garbage receptacle will focus the blast upwards instead of outwards. Of course, many other cities simply get rid of public trash cans to avoid the issue entirely... with the obvious drawback that people who have trash they can't (or don't want to) carry home will probably dispose of it in a manner inconvenient for the city (and generally illegal to boot).
