Cast Full of Pretty Boys: 
**Marik:** There are no women in _Yu-Gi-Oh!_. There are only extremely girly men! And _I_ am the most girly of them all!  
**Pegasus:** Keep telling yourself that.

An array of pretty people as eye candy isn't just for the guys. Girls get their Cast Full Of Pretty Boys to ogle too in the name of fanservice. This tends to be less noticeable than its female counterpart because exclusively (or near-exclusively) male casts are already common and expected (thought not always with the intentional appeal to females) and the fanservice tends to be along the lines of "he cooks" or "naked chest" and thus usually objectifies in a different way than in male-oriented shows. The writers sometimes leave it to their audience to retrofit the standard group of friends into the Unwanted Harem if they wish.

Some series of this flavor go the reverse harem route and have an ordinary female lead among the Pretty Boys as an audience surrogate, although the girly keet type can be used this way too.

Sometimes these stories have their own version of Those Two Guys. One will be a 'normal' audience surrogate and thus a young (but non-threatening) girl. Another will be a more 'ideal' woman, often a clever, sexy, and mature lady who barely fits into her dress.

## Examples:

Cast Full of Pretty Boys Example in Anime & Manga

-   **07-Ghost** main cast has only males, with only a few women on the side. Not only that, but every male character who isn't a geezer is \*fabulous\* , and good looks are apparently required to be a bishop. Then there's all the rampant Ho Yay...
-   **ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept.** has this. The only major characters who aren't attractive men are the attractive woman General Director Mauve, the cute little sister Lotta, and the 99-year-old king. Notable in that quite a few of the pretty "boys" are over 30. It does take place in the offices of a government agency, after all.
-   **Aruosumente**: With only two named female characters, the cast is overwhelmingly male and everyone below the age of fifty and with a name is **pretty**.
-   **Amatsuki**: Plenty of good-looking male characters for the fans to enjoy, both human and non-human. The artist lampshaded this by doing a Gender Flip chapter special without changing the guys' faces.
-   In the 2013 The Anime of the Game **Amnesia: Memories**, the entire plot revolves around a group of simply gorgeous young men, all of whom are interested in the heroine.
-   **Betrayal Knows My Name**: Every character is a bishonen.
-   **Black Blood Brothers** proves that being hot and being a vampire or werewolf are not exclusive.
-   **Black Butler**. Nearly every single male character is an outright bishounen, with few exceptions.
-   **Black Cat**: Filled to the brim with good lookin' guys. You can count the non-pretty characters on one hand, and none of them are prominent.
-   **Blood Blockade Battlefront**, to the point where even the **fish man** is ridiculously pretty, and The Merch plays it up for all its worth.
-   **Cells At Work! White Brigade**: The main cast is staffed by U-1146 and his all-male Neutrophil squad, and the male Band Cell who is training to become a mature Neutrophil. They're all mostly rather handsome, though the dark areas under their eyes make them look a bit odd.
-   Although **Chrono Crusade** has quite a bit of fanservice based around its mostly female True Companions, it's not hard to notice that every single important male character is **very** good looking, and these characters probably have as many Shirtless Scenes as the girls have Clothing Damage scenes, if not more. Obviously, the manga-ka knew how to widen his demographic.
-   Several CLAMP series, especially **Clamp School Detectives**, **X/1999** and **Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-**.
-   **Cute High Earth Defense Club LOVE!** takes place at an all-boys school, with the main cast being made up entirely out of Ambiguously Gay Bishounen.
-   **Death Note** has quite a few Bishounen in its cast.
-   **Descendants of Darkness**: The average female character has the life expectancy of a particularly stupid gnat or falls off the face of the earth after one or two appearances, and only one major character is not bishonen.
-   **Di\[e\]ce**. There's only one significant female character. The rest of the cast consists of pretty, pretty Bishōnen.
-   In **D.N.Angel**, if they're plot relevant and male, they will be Bishōnen. (Bar Daisuke to some people but he could be considered cute in a clumsy sort of way.)
-   **Free!** has a cast that, by far, only consists of five attractive and well built male swimmers.
    -   And season two introduces a new set of pretty boys in addition to the old cast.
    -   The prequel film **High★Speed! - Free! Starting Days** introduces a new set of swimmers in middle school - who return as well-built and pretty university boys in season three.
-   **Fruits Basket**, while having several plot-worthy female characters other than the main character, spends a disproportionate amount of its time on Yuki and Kyo. The rest of the cast is also heavily bishonen.
-   **Fushigi Yuugi** has them littered everywhere. Miaka, the main character, has a personal harem of them. Yui gets Nakago, and Nakago gets... everybody else, at some point or another in the story.
-   Also in the "shounen manga for girls" category, **Get Backers** dishes up plenty of Fanservice in the form of scantily clad women with impossibly huge boobs, the series still appeals to some girls who are attracted by the predominantly bishounen cast.
-   **Gravitation**, **Gakuen Heaven**, and any other Boys' Love series.
    -   Similarly occurs in the **Saint Beast** prequel series. There are no women in heaven apparently—those pretty youths with female names? Male. Rei too.

-   **Mobile Suit Gundam Wing** is considered a Cast Full Of Pretty Boys among its female audience, despite the fact that it is not only a shounen series, but has a deliberate 1:1 ratio of male to female main characters and more or less assigns one female to each male.
-   **Hana-Kimi** is about a girl disguising herself as a man so she can get into an all-boys school. Obviously, most of the cast are bishounen.
-   **Hetalia: Axis Powers**: All of the main characters, the Axis 3 and the 5 Allies, are young men. The main reason for this? The author has trouble drawing women. Ironically, many of the main characters were initially meant to be middle-aged. The first and most prominent female character is Hungary, who appears in the center of the volume 5 cover. It's probably not a coincidence that's she's a fujoshi. She is not the female audience surrogate, however; Seychelles was made for that purpose.
-   **Inuyasha** has this in **spades**. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> If the character is central to the plot and male, he will be Bishonen.
-   Except for a few deliberately ugly characters, Parts 4, 5, and 7 of **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure** are full of very feminine/androgynous male characters. (Part 6 takes place in a women's prison). Part 2 is more like a Cast Full of Shirtless Hunks.
-   **Junjou Romantica**. Understandable, since it's a BL series.
-   **K** is about a magic system where seven powerful Kings form Clans of followers with superpowers. With the exception of three beautiful **girls**, they're all pretty boys. They're good with appealing to a variety of tastes, too - younger, older, elegant, rough, nerdy, action-oriented... take your pick!
-   In **Kamisama Kiss** nearly every male in the series is attractive.
-   **Karneval**: Most of the male cast could qualify.
-   **Knight Hunters**: Arguably the biggest draw — despite its poor animation quality and plot holes large enough to drive a tank through, its four angsty, sexually ambiguous bishonen have garnered a wide fandom.
-   95% of **La Corda d'Oro**'s main characters are male and pretty.
-   **Laughing Under the Clouds**, wherein even the army mooks are mostly Bishōnen. Basically, if you have as much as two words to contribute to whatever's happening, you will be pretty.
-   **Les Misérables: Shōjo Cosette** has almost all of The Friends of the ABC. The exceptions are Grantaire and Lesgle, but their appearance was upgraded.
-   **Love Mode**: Nothing but good-looking guys.
-   **Marginal Prince**, it's based on a Romance Game after all. In fact, there isn't a single reccurring female character except for Yuuta's faceless older sister (who serves as an Audience Surrogate).
-   Downplayed in **Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun**. Of the 7 main characters, 4 are boys and 3 are girls, but all the boys are some flavor of Bishōnen except Nozaki, who's a Hunk, and one of the girls (Kashima) is a Bifauxnen.
-   Almost every major male character in **Moriarty the Patriot** are drawn as Bishōnen: i.e. the Moriarty brothers, Sebastian Moran, Sherlock Holmes as a Long-Haired Pretty Boy, and Dr. Watson. Even Mycroft, who is less conventionally "pretty" than his brother, still looks quite handsome.
-   **My Hero Academia**: Most of Class 1-A counts as this. **Especially** their top dogs. Even less major characters can qualify as Bishounen.
-   **Nabari no Ou**: Every major and minor male character under 30 is Bishōnen. No exceptions.
-   **Nanbaka**: It's a prison action comedy/drama, so it's probably inevitable that the men inside would be this. There's actually only one woman around and she's the head warder.
-   **Number**: The only male characters who **aren't** bishounen are the Number assassins' two corrupt targets and the ninja-maid's master, who's a Frank Booth\-level sadist. The rest of the handsome/pretty cast love to torment the handsome/pretty teenage main protagonist.
-   **Ouran High School Host Club** plays with this, along with Haruhi's crossdressing letting girls gush over **her** too.
-   **Ouja No Yuugi** has a cast that almost entirely consists of pretty boys and Bishōnen.
-   About half the cast of **PandoraHearts** are pretty boys and beautiful young men.
-   **Papuwa** has only one human female character, and she's... Let's just say she is six feet tall, over muscled, and has a beard. The rest of the cast are Funny Animals, children and attractive men. If you haven't figured it out yet, it's a comedy series.
-   **Patalliro!**: This comedy series, started in 1979 and having an anime adaptation in 1981, counts as one of the earliest mangas to utilize this trope.
-   **Peacemaker Kurogane**: Most of the cast is male and Bishōnen and Ho Yay is rampant. The only identifiable females are Saya and Susumu's sister.
-   **Prétear**, created entirely on the premise of combining a Magical Girl anime with a male Unwanted Harem. Even if a few of them are far too young to be bishonen yet, they are clearly meant to be bishonen in training and before the series started, they **were** bishonen until they were killed by the villain.
-   It's very easy to confuse **The Prince of Tennis** for a Boys' Love series due to its largely male cast and mostly Yaoi Fangirl following. Actually it's a Shōnen manga and anime, however, it's a very fine example of the increasingly prevalent Bishōnen Jump Syndrome (and what a surprise, **Prince of Tennis** happens to be serialized in Shounen Jump).
-   Shonen Jump title **Reborn! (2004)** has Tsuna and his guardians. Plus the side characters. Plus 99% of the villains. In fact, the number of times there is fanservice for guys can be counted on one hand.
-   Arguably, Masami Kurumada as the author of **Saint Seiya** popularized this. After all, who else would have the guts to name a **man** Aphrodite?
    -   His next big work, **B't X** is even more into this trope. Because as vaguely homoerotic as it was when Shun revived Hyoga by cuddling up to him, **nothing** surpasses the bishieness of Demon Knight Sapphire. Because **really**, he himself says he's really into "what's hot and what's not" and goes so far as to kiss Teppei.
    -   Fou and Quattro— born in Sodom, died in Sodom!
    -   CLAMP started off drawing **Saint Seiya** doujinshi (there's still some of it online, I think) and the fandom actually consolidated the use of the word 'yaoi' in the 80s. It also has only one instance of female fanservice in the entire thing (although this is not so in Next Dimension)-compared to the amount of times we see Shiryu shirtless and Saga naked...it's certainly one of the best examples of this trope.
-   **Saiyuki**: The basic series premise is not 'A loose retelling of **Journey to the West**.' It's 'Throw three hot guys and their cute surrogate little brother in a small jeep and watch the fireworks.' The only significant female characters are Lirin and Yaone. Yaone was added in to increase the number of girls and in one volume a note from Minekura at the end states: "There are no women in this volume, I looked back and found a couple of pages with Kannon." As for Kanzeon? Close but no cigar.
-   With a 2:1 gender ratio and three of the four male characters being rather attractive humans and a Half-Human Hybrid (the fourth is a bear, though even he may be considered attractive for his species), there's no question the cast of **Sands of Destruction** is full of pretty boys. DVD Bonus Material acknowledges this by making Agan a model, Naja his up-and-coming rival model, and Kyrie an apparently-random choice for the world's third-best-looking man (behind Agan and Naja, of course).
-   **School Teacher** has a small classroom of cute/pretty boys who are actually animals trying to become human (**tsundere** fox, horny rabbit, hyperactive squirrel twins, and very eager-to-please puppy; the puppy thought the teacher was a parrot due to his red hair and later declares that he "will be **sensei's wife**!"). The two exceptions to the all-male cast are the sexy **oujo-sama** cat with full lips, long hair, and female kimono who's actually a neutered male and the woman who had a crush on his master who only appears in flashback.
-   **Sk8 the Infinity**'s main skateboarder cast; they and their spectating fans of all genders certainly seem to know it. It was also directed by the same woman who directed "Free".
-   **Star Driver**, where basically every single male of the important cast is very, very pretty. Hell, the main character is called **Ginga Bishōnen**, for crying out loud! You know you're there when even the villain, who's actually so old that he's the hero's father, is confused for a hot high school guy.
-   Every speaking male in **Tokyo Mew Mew** is an eye candy. Take your Teen Genius boss, your amazing dessert chef with the red sports car, your murderous Human Alien stalker, or your perfect boyfriend.
-   Since it's by the woman who practically invented Yaoi, **Toward the Terra** already had a fair share of pretty boys in manga form. Then someone decided to adapt it into an anime and put Nobuteru Yūki (aka, the man responsible for the bishonen overload in **The Vision of Escaflowne**) in charge of the character designs. The end result is that there are simply no ugly men in this series. At all.
-   **Trigun** borders on this, as almost all of the major male characters are attractive bishonen, including Vash, Knives, Wolfwood, Legato, etc, and the manga has the Hunk Livio. The series even has Those Two Girls, in the form of Milly and Meryl.
-   **Tsuritama** is an extremely rare slice-of-life example where every male character have their own unique quirkiness.
-   **Undertaker Riddle**. The male/female radio is 1 female for 5 males, all of them pretty.
-   **Vampire Doll**: All of the men are gorgeous flamboyant eye candy who lay on heavy fanservice. What few girls in the series are adorable too.
-   **Vampire Knight**: While it has its female characters, the cast is predominantly made up of very pretty boys. Even the headmaster could be considered bishonen.
-   Not even **The Vision of Escaflowne** escapes this treatment. Though Van isn't super girly he is still very handsome; Allen, on the other hand....
-   **The Wallflower**: Each member of the unwanted harem is a liberal user of Bishie Sparkle.
-   **Wolf's Rain** is known for having an attractive cast (when they are in human form).
-   Marvel Comics has made several attempts to court manga readers, both Japanese and Western. Their latest attempt is OEL **X-Men** Shoujo manga entitled **X-Men: Misfits**. In this manga, Kitty Pryde, the Audience Surrogate character, is the first female to enroll at Xavier's for a very long time and thus surrounded by an Unwanted Harem composed entirely of bishonen. Poor Kitty.
-   **Yona of the Dawn** has Hak, Kija, Shin-ah, Jae-ha, Zeno, and Yoon escorting Yona on her goodwill tour around her country. Her first love Su-won adds his beauty to the central conflict of her life. Also deconstructed; how is it that the descendants of the Four Dragons are all under thirty when they meet Yona? Because every Dragon before them died young. Zeno doesn't count.
-   **You and Me** centers on a group of bishounen childhood friends, especially the twins Yuki and Yuta.
-   As the page quote states, almost all the characters on **Yu-Gi-Oh!** are men, and most are either feminine or American, sometimes both. The best evidence of this is the **Marik's Evil Council** videos, where all the villains appear in succession, and aside from Zorc and possibly Akun (or Bob), ALL of them are incredibly bishonen. It's even more obvious in the other two. Latter has emphasis on the **Ghetto**.
-   **Yuri!!! on Ice** focuses on male figure skating, and a good chunk of the cast is made up of good-looking young men as a result.
-   **YuYu Hakusho** is another great example: while the central True Companions gender ratio is almost 50/50, the focus is overwhelmingly on guys, many of whom are quite Bishounen. The big exception is Kuwabara, but **damn** if he doesn't make up for that with his great physique! This was not at all the case back when the premise was 'dead delinquent having heart-warming yet hilarious ghostly adventures', when the main characters were Yusuke and Botan, with Keiko and then Kuwabara becoming increasingly important, and also Shota who appeared twice and Sayaka the ghost girl who joined up for a while.

Cast Full of Pretty Boys Example in Comic Books

-   The **Jem and the Holograms (IDW)** comic is a comic series that adheres to this. The guys weren't exactly unattractive in the **Jem** cartoon but the reboot made them much more prettier. They updated the fashion and the animesque style makes them look bishonen. Rio, Craig, Riot, and Techrat are all slim and fashionable. Eric is now an attractive, glasses wearing businessman. Even Shana's boyfriend is a cute looking Big Beautiful Man. **Jem And The Holograms** is female aimed so that might be a factor behind all the main males looking as they do.

Cast Full of Pretty Boys Example in Fan Works

-   Most of the male Capricorn Pirates from **One Piece: Parallel Works**. One reviewer Lampshades this by saying, "All of the Capricorn males are either Bishounen or had the potential to become one - Yes, even Hatori and Thierry."
-   While the characters on **South Park** look identical aside from their hair and clothes, the vast majority of **South Park** fanfiction describes its main characters as attractive pretty boys.

Cast Full of Pretty Boys Example in Films — Live-Action

-   **The Covenant** is also famous for its five attractive leads including Sebastian Stan. Then, we have a scene in the locker room.
-   **Dunkirk** has become so infamous for its pretty cast that its gang of young actors are referred to as "the Dunkirk Boys."
-   **Fight Club** seems to do this on purpose. It gives the audience highly attractive men like Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Jared Leto in varying states of undress, a ton of Ho Yay... and then has them violently beat the shit out of each other. If you're into that kinda thing you'll be in heaven.
-   **Gattaca**, thanks to Designer Babies.
-   **Interview with the Vampire** had young Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater as the main cast.
-   **Les Misérables (2012)**. Seriously, at least half the movie focuses on a whole band of ridiculously attractive young men in a revolutionary fervour and singing gorgeously. And the older guys are played by Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe and Sacha Baron Cohen.
-   **The Lord of the Rings** movies have a grand total of three female main characters. Much of the rest of the cast varies between Pretty Boys and Hunk. Even uncursed Theoden is a Silver Fox. The costumes don't help matters: these clothes would make almost anyone look good. Neither does the Ho Yay between main characters. Subverted in **The Hobbit** where the prettiness of the cast is reduced by a half, since most of the dwarves are older.
-   **The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones** has a **ludicrously** attractive array of males<small>◊</small> in the cast - the females are pretty too, but there's much fewer of them since the movie's target audience was teenage girls.
-   **The Outsiders** had Rob Lowe, Tom Cruise, Matt Dillon, Patrick Swayze, Emilio Estevez, C. Thomas Howell, and Ralph Macchio. All were young, sometimes shirtless, and barely a girl in sight.
-   **Star Trek (2009)** Its cast invoking youth and sex appeal more than other **Star Treks** while keeping the cast mostly male.
-   **Stop-Loss**'s three leads are Ryan Phillippe, Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. And they're soldiers in uniform too. As with many a Channing Tatum movie, there's a colossal ton of Ho Yay in there too.
-   Both **Top Gun** and **Top Gun: Maverick** feature extremely attractive individuals playing some sort of ball-sports whilst scantily clothed on a beach. The original offers up Tom Cruise, Anthony Edwards, and Val Kilmer, among others, while the sequel most prominently features Miles Teller, Glen Powell, Monica Barbaro, and Tom Cruise.
-   Most of the men in the movie franchise **Twilight** are young and handsome.
-   **Velvet Goldmine**. Very young Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and still young Ewan McGregor and Christian Bale (clad in glitter, makeup and feathers, of course).

Cast Full of Pretty Boys Example in Literature

-   **½ Prince**: The sheer number of pretty boys is astounding.
-   **Ai no Kusabi**, due to there being very few women on the planet it takes place and much of the population being the product of LEGO Genetics.
-   **Corsair**'s cast, with the exception of Barbossa is very much this, plus Aura and Katarina to fill the beautiful women quota. There's a reason for this.
-   Most of the guys in **Durarara!!** could qualify. There are exceptions, but most of the male cast is rather pretty.
-   Only 6 of the 32 name characters in **Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation: Mo Dao Zu Shi** are female. Most of the men, even the older ones, are noted to be rather handsome. The entire Gusu Lan sect is noted as never having an ugly disciple.
-   In Alessandra Hazard's **That Irresistible Poison**, all the guys in the main cast are drop-dead gorgeous.
-   **Kyo Kara Maoh!**: Yuuri even has an Unwanted Harem, and he's actually engaged to one of them! Complete with Those Two Girls: the flirty curvy ex-Maou Cheri and the younger inventor Anasina, sometimes joined by a trio of servants who are essentially fangirls themselves. (They write yaoi fanfic about their employers!)
-   **The Legend of Sun Knight**. So much so that you could say it feels off when they tone down the copious amount of Bishie Sparkle after the first couple chapters.
-   A 2000 year old example in **The Metamorphoses**
-   In an unusual example, the main character of **The Reader And Protagonist Definitely Have To Be In True Love** is a shapeshifter who has eight different forms, making him an in-universe one-man example of a cast full of pretty boys.
-   **The Story of Saiunkoku** has the heroine making friends with dozens of gorgeous Long Haired Pretty Boys. If there's one thing to be said about the series, it's that it's very, **very** pretty.
-   Taken to a ridiculous extreme in **Sukisho**. There are no female characters in the entire series, and all characters are either pretty boys, handsome men in their 30s, or young boys, and one crossdresser housewife. There is one single woman in the background who is visible for about half a second, and one character mentions his mother in one scene.
-   **Tantei Team KZ Jiken Note**:
    -   The main cast of consists of four boys and one girl. While the boys are not exactly Bishōnen, they are good-looking enough that western viewers of the anime adaptation often wondered the possibility a case of reverse harem (as the girl is The Protagonist). Being a series written for tweens, that is obviously downplayed.
    -   The spinoff **Genie Team G Jiken Note**, however, plays this trope the most straight; the male cast<small>◊</small> there is the most Bishōnen allowed in a Middle Grade Literature artwork.

Cast Full of Pretty Boys Example in Live-Action TV

-   **Charmed** didn't have this in the main cast but rather in the guest stars. It was noted that most of the recurring love interests for the sisters were lantern-jawed, chiselled Hunks and Pretty Boys. Julian McMahon became a 2000s sex symbol because of his role on the show and later **Nip/Tuck**.
-   **Band of Brothers** has many characters, most of which are played by attractive young men (not restricted to just-starting-out Damian Lewis, Michael Fassbender, Tom Hardy, James McAvoy etc.). The likes of Ross McCall (Liebgott), Eion Bailey (Webster), Scott Grimes (Malarkey) and James Madio (Perconte) have huge female followings. The uniform might have something to do with it. The series has a huge Periphery Demographic of female fans precisely for this reason.
-   A number of Korean dramas fit this trope, but particularly **The First Shop of Coffee Prince**, in which a sexy 30-something rake overhauls a coffee shop by hiring only sexy young men. Of course, one of them is someone he only **thinks** is a young man.
-   At first, in **Flashpoint**, the only female character on the team was Action Girl Jules. Before Leah joined the team after Lewis Young's death. Even Lampshaded the episode when Leah joined and the woman's locker room's sign was changed from **Jules** to **Women**.

-   The Warblers in **Glee** are, for the most part, very hot and very good at singing. And it only becomes more so after Kurt transfers to Dalton.
    -   All the other hot guys on the show - Finn, Sam, Puck and Mike for starters. Also Will, Sebastian and Joe.
-   **Heroes** has about a dozen main characters, all but two of whom are male. And they're so pretty...
-   **Highlander** has this in spades. Duncan, Methos, Richie...many of the baddie immortals aren't exactly ugly either. It's not an \*all\* male cast, due to Tessa in season 1 and the recurring Amanda and Dr. Lindsay later on, but it fits. The films have it as well, but the series is more noticeable.
-   **Home and Away**, where the men below the age of 50 almost invariably have perfectly sculpted physiques, are smiley and very well-groomed, even (perhaps especially) the lower-class and criminal types, such as the Braxton brothers.
-   Thanks to Toei noticing why there's a sizeable number of women who watched the series, most of the main characters in Heisei and Reiwa era **Kamen Rider** are young, good-looking males. Even before that, a good chunk of the old ones were considered "Showa Hotties" when their series were on.
-   In Season 4 of **Merlin**, Prince Arthur assembles his Knights of the Round Table. Recruitment seems to be based on how very, very pretty they are.<small>◊</small> Also, how drop-dead gorgeous our title character<small>◊</small> is.
-   **Noah's Arc**: The only man of even average attractiveness in the main cast might be Alex (even that point is debatable), with all the other guys having absolutely perfect physiques.
-   Even the most feminist-leaning seasons of **Power Rangers** have an almost two-to-one ratio of male to female characters (standard procedure is four male rangers, two female; changes to the formula only lead to fewer females such as the five-to-one **Ninja Storm.**) This leads to an almost all-male cast of young, good-looking, athletic pretty boys year after year.
-   **Schitt's Creek**: For a small rural town, there sure are a lot of handsome young men in Schitt's Creek. The 30ish crowd includes David, Mutt, Ted, Jake, and Patrick as well as bit players like Dr. Miguel and the "hottie" that hits on Patrick at the store. It's so noticeable, that Buzzfeed journalist joked with Annie Murphy and Noah Reid about it in an online video.
-   **Shadowhunters** may have the prettiest cast of any Urban Fantasy series. Jace, Alec, Simon, Raphael, Magnus and Luke are all good-looking young men in good shape. Hodge is given Adaptational Attractiveness to become a Pretty Boy too. Of course the other side of the spectrum isn't left out either - since Clary and Isabelle are both quite pretty too.
-   **Shakespeare Unwrapped** - an Irish Edutainment Show went for a Younger and Hipper cast to make **King Lear** more relatable to school children. As the play only has three female parts, the majority of the cast are twenty-something guys. Notably this also plays up the Ho Yay between Kent and Lear, as well as between Cornwall and Gloucester.
-   **Skins** seemingly uses a very simple recipe for casting: "hot" and "in their late teens" which naturally results in this trope on the male side. Especially present in the third generation, when Nick, Matty, Rich, Rider and Alex can all be counted as pretty boys.
-   The perpetually angst-ridden, ridiculously good-looking, fanservicey-as-hell (almost entirely) male cast of **Supernatural**, especially since the show likes to kill off any supporting female character. Combined with the unavoidable Ho Yay, it almost seems as if it is being written solely to appeal to fangirls.
-   **Teen Wolf**. Those poor, beautiful, beautiful lacrosse players. They can't even manage to keep their shirts on for more than ten minutes at a time.
-   **The Vampire Diaries**: The Salvatores, Jeremy, Tyler, Alaric, Klaus and Matt - and that's just the main cast! The spin-off **The Originals** follows suit as well.

Cast Full of Pretty Boys Example in Music

-   This trope defines the Japanese talent agency Johnny's and Associates.
-   Two words: Boy Bands. It doesn't even matter if they can play instruments or have talent. If all the members are fairly good looking, they fall under this trope.
-   All K-pop boy groups. Don't even try to deny it.
-   New Romantic bands tended to have this image, especially Duran Duran.
-   Hair Metal bands from The '80s also qualify, albeit with long hair.
-   A fictional example would be Hypnosis Mic, which mainly focus on Battle Rapping. It's an Otomate series, what do you expect?

Cast Full of Pretty Boys Example in Pro Wrestling

-   An accusation Delirious threw at Último Dragón's Toryumon promotion while he was working for it, one that many people agree with though most of them don't find it such a bad thing. This is less true of regional variants such as Dragon Gate USA and Toryumon Mexico, but only slightly. There's a reason Delirious's pretty boy rival Matt Sydal was the first gaijin to win the Open The Brave Gate in Dragon Gate proper.
-   Most of the WWE roster, to the point that quite a few wrestlers have even made their pretty looks a part of their gimmick, or given themselves a nickname to reflect that they're a part of this trope. Examples include "Prince Pretty" Tyler Breeze, "The Shaman of Sexy" John Morrison, and of course "Dashing" Cody Rhodes. Scotty 2 Hotty jokes that towards the end of his term in WWE, he asked if he could drop the "2 Hotty" part of his ring name, in contrast to some of the more attractive guys on the roster.
-   Celtic Championship Wrestling of Ireland has a startling collection of good looking young guys on their roster. The likes of Ricky Combat, Bingo Ballance, The Wood Brothers, DOC, Jody Fleisch, Xavier Burns and many others all provide their own form of Fanservice. Though they do have prominent Ms Fanservices in the form of Katey Harvey, Kazza, Siren and Marie.

-   **Pili Fantasy: War of Dragons**: And pretty girls, but mostly boys. Just about every character, good or evil, is incredibly handsome or beautiful, with only a few exceptions for age, being comic relief, or demons.

-   Big Finish's ''The Confessions Of Dorian Gray''<small>◊</small> (yes that Dorian Gray) manages to pull this off despite it being a sound only medium (which is a great pity)

Cast Full of Pretty Boys Example in Theatre

-   The anime series with these kinds of casts are the ones most likely to get "2.5D" stage play adaptations. Popular series include **The Prince of Tennis**, **Tsukiuta**, and **Touken Ranbu's** **Tou Myu** and **Tou Stage** series.
-   **Cesare - Il Creatore che ha distrutto** isn't strictly 2.5D, but it is based on a manga, and the original cast featured actors from all of the above series (alongside more famous musical actors). And it's set in the Italian Renaissance.

Cast Full of Pretty Boys Example in Video Games

-   **100 Sleeping Princes and the Kingdom of Dreams** is a puzzle game where you collect handsome princes - voiced by popular voice actors, of course. The game also features collaborations with anime such as **Black Butler** and **K**, where the characters from these series get transported to the Kingdom of Dreams and get Prince forms.
-   **Akanesasu Sekai de Kimi to Utau** features a large cast whose age ranges from little boy to old man and attractiveness ranges from macho muscular to Bishōnen to out-and-out Dude Looks Like a Lady. And since all of them are stand-ins for historical figures, that automatically means they have been treated to a heavy dose of Historical Beauty Update.
-   The entire **Angelique** series. Ditto **La Corda d'Oro** and **Harukanaru Toki no Naka de**. This is the **point** of the NeoRomance series.
-   **Ayakashi: Romance Reborn**. We see both male and female Youkai, **all** highly attractive, but being an otome game it's mostly Bishounen. And the human love interests are no slouches either.
-   **Band Yarouze!** is filled with so many cute boys, even **the lone girl group** is a troupe of extremely convincing crossdressers.
-   **Bungo to Alchemist** with the objective of bringing famous novelists from the 19th and early 20th centuries Back from the Dead as attractive men to protect literary classics from corruption.
-   The later **Castlevania** games are filled with elegant Bishounen among the heroes and villains, due to Ayami Kojima's character designs.
-   Nearly every male character in **Dynasty Warriors** is, if not a downright Bishōnen, rather good-looking, although all of the bishonen are from one of the Three Kingdoms (when they're not moonlighting due to game circumstances). Before DW7, Wu had the highest concentration of bishonen; now, Jin takes the crown, seemingly **designed** to be a Ghetto. Since **Samurai Warriors** is derived from **Dynasty Warriors**, it's only natural that the trope applies there as well.
-   **Ensemble Stars!** has a huge cast of idols, with **over thirty** characters, all of them male, meeting every possible standard of bishonen beauty. There is one female character, but she rarely is seen onscreen outside of a few small cameos in cards with the male characters and you never see her face.
-   The **Final Fantasy** franchise has always catered to this trope on some level, though only by including one or two "token" bishonen rather than a whole harem. However, **Kingdom Hearts** relishes in coming up with more and more bishonen to throw into the fray, the biggest example being **Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories** and **Kingdom Hearts II**, in which the villains are a sprawling organization of super-hot men with one token female on the team.Even True Organization XIII counts, because except for two old men, the rest of the members are one cute young Bishōnen and the rest are fine hunks, because Master Xehanort isn't as awfully disfigured as Voldemort, and all of his other incarnations are either cute young Bishōnen or hunks. Even those whose bodies he stole, Terra, and Saix, are fine hunks too. Gee, is Master Xehanort's goal of collecting his other incarnations are to make him easier to dominate the world or to make a boy band of his past hunky selves?
    -   The all-star fighting game **Dissidia Final Fantasy** includes the main hero and villain out of the first ten games in the franchise. This leads to 21 out of 24 male leads. The heroes only have one girl on their side (leaving out Shanttoto, who's a bonus character). By default, the game qualifies for this trope just for including Cecil and Kuja in the same cast. The female headcount goes down by one when you realize that Cloud of Darkness is actually genderless and only takes the form of a beautiful woman.
    -   **Final Fantasy XV** takes this trope and runs with it, featuring an all-male party that fans have compared to a boy band.
-   **Fire Emblem Fates** has an equal ratio of men to women, but several of the male characters are young adults with Bishounen features, but especially the Hoshido Kingdom. The Aggressive Submissive Takumi, or alternatively, in a certain path he is crazy and tragic, but still beautiful anyway,Nice Guy ninja Kaze, the Little Bit Beastly Kitsune Kaden, the playful Subaki, Cloud Cuckoolander Izana, the diva Shigure... The Nohr Kingdom only have half of Bishōnen Hoshido have, but it's there. The Jerkass Battle Butler Jakob, the cool Leo, and his Dude Looks Like a Lady son Forrest... Take your pick.
-   While **Harvest Moon** games have the option of playing a female and thus providing a list of eligible bachelors, some of the more recent ones have started slipping in greater amounts of this into the bachelor selection. **Harvest Moon: Tree of Tranquility** even includes a guy feminine you can woo him with flowers. Not surprising, as one of the chief complaints of female players was that the roster of wives were significantly better looking and interesting than the grooms. The spinoff **Rune Factory** and its sequels amps this up: even the main character, who is male, can be considered cuter than one or two of the bachelorettes.
    -   **Rune Factory** tends more toward the opposite end of the spectrum, though; more often than not, almost every job in town is done by a cute, single girl (and/or her sadly unmarriable mother). Particularly glaring in **Rune Factory Oceans**, the first game to feature a female player option at all; Sonia gets four choices for marriage (including Aden), while Aden gets ten. **Rune Factory 4** and **Rune Factory 5**, which allow you to play as a female character from the beginning, have an equal amount of bachelors and bachelorettes.
-   **Ichu** has an entirely male cast of idols with a crossdressing girl group.
-   **Idolish 7** has 2 (later 4) idol units consists entirely of beautiful boys.
-   Many characters in **Inazuma Eleven** are this. Some of them even look prettier than the female cast. Of course this applies to the anime as well.
-   **Meine Liebe** follows this trope with unabashed faithfulness, adding plenty of Ho Yay thrown in for good measure.
    -   The anime was worse, reducing the female character in the games to token appearances.
-   **Namu Amida Butsu! -UTENA-** is about collecting, training and sending attractive male (and one female) Buddhas into battle.
-   **Onmyōji (2016)**, while having a lot of good-looking women in it, has more than a few beautiful boys and men (including a few that could pass for girls). Even some of the animals have a human form and of course they're beautiful!
-   **Sengoku Basara**, the Capcom rival to Koei's **Dynasty Warriors** and **Samurai Warriors**, is loaded with lots of male characters, who are things for female players to ogle at. Most of its characters satisfy some kind of fetish, but it's usually arguable that guys like Date Masamune, Sanada Yukimura, Mori Motonari and Chosokabe Motochika come out on top of the popularity list. It's telling that they are really gunning for this trope moreso than Koei, like how they turn the usually macho, gung-ho Shibata Katsuie into a rather mopey but very pretty young man (same with Tokugawa Ieyasu, who usually got portrayed as an old man but here a clear cut young man), as well as how in **Yukimura-Den** installment, they eschews the notion of adding a new female character (they stuck with their rendition of Saika Magoichi, who's got a Gender Flip), when Koei usually is fairer to the X-Chromosome.
-   **Touken Ranbu** is about bringing famous Japanese swords to life in order to fight an evil force...and all of these swords take on the forms of pretty boys and handsome men.
-   The entire cast of **Twisted Wonderland** consists of pretty boys. In a twist, these pretty boys are based on various Disney villains, their animal sidekicks, and even their **items**.

Cast Full of Pretty Boys Example in Visual Novels

-   The cast of **NU: carnival** is entirely made up of attractive men with a variety of appearances and personalities. Being a gay man with a high libido, Eiden is very happy to see that the Klein Continent has no shortage of good-looking men living in it.
-   **Obey Me! – One Master to Rule Them All!** takes place in a supernatural school where you are surrounded by several handsome men where at least seven guys are interested in your heart.
    -   Any **Shall We Date?** game is this trope. It's an otome series, so yeah.
-   **Yo-Jin-Bo**, being a Romance Game, is all about the bishounen. The only girl who appears onscreen besides yourself is Hatsuhime (who kinda is still you, in a way). A couple of maids may speak during the endings, but they never get to be in the picture.

Cast Full of Pretty Boys Example in Web Animation

-   **RWBY**: Most of the guys, teenager or adult, are attractive. Heck, even the youngest males are very cute.
-   Parodied in **Senpai Club**. The titular senpai (bar the one female) are all varying degrees of anime stereotypes such as the Long-Haired Pretty Boy and the keet. The problem is that they're drawn in a very simplistic and stylistic way compared to everyone else, who is animesque.

Cast Full of Pretty Boys Example in Webcomics

-   **Black Haze**, to a **ridiculous** extent. Almost every male character, young or even older, is absolutely **gorgeous**.
-   **Blood Bank** has a decent proportion of female characters for a Yaoi, but every male character with even a miniscule amount of panel time is highly attractive. The ones that aren't in the present day are inevitably revealed to have been handsome in their time. Made all the more noticeable when **very** pretty characters are called ugly in-story.
-   In **Grrl Power** all of the male heroes in Arc Swat are this. Justified in-universe since almost anyone who has powers is generally a perfect physical specimen.
-   **The Dreamer** has almost every taste, and only one major female character.
-   **Ennead** has every character be incredibly attractive and dressed skimpily, presumably because of how warm Egypt is. Not that anyone's complaining.
-   **Hanna Is Not a Boy's Name** has many, many pretty men to suit everyone's taste, and a total of two significant female characters (one of whom at first seems like a Villain of the Week). Check out the cast lineup.
-   **The Law of Purple** frequently displays its prettyboys shirtless.
-   **Ménage à 3**: Attractive guys are not lacking in the series or any of its spin offs. For some stories its even a plot point.
-   **My Dear Cold-Blooded King** takes place in a land like ancient China, and the majority of the males are definitely bishonen.
-   **Nightmare Factory** has mostly male characters. Kreyul and Phirre fit this, as does Kissae's male form.
-   **Noblesse** the online manhwa, has hot bishonen aplenty—and they end up living in the same house. Yaoi fangirls, right<small>◊</small> this way.<small>◊</small>
-   Large enough portion of the cast of **Roommates** are Pretty Boys to qualify despite having several strong women characters who get **panel time**.

-   **Sanrio Boys** features a wide variety of handsome Sanrio fans. Justified since it's about Sanrio's Periphery Demographic.
-   Over two hundred men have worked for No Rules Wrestling and most of them were much prettier than what you'd see at a live pro wrestling show.

-   The series **Pretty Dudes** is built on this trope, in addition to So Beautiful, It's a Curse.

Cast Full of Pretty Boys Example in Western Animation

-   Possibly unintentional on the part of its creators, **Metalocalypse** fits this trope. Dethklok and their manager are all attractive (even Murderface has his offbeat charm) males, the only female characters are extras or, in one case, a recurring villain, and the show is liberally peppered with Ho Yay.
    -   This was Lampshaded in a season 4 episode where the band goes on vacation to the Middle East and are mistaken for women by absolutely everyone. Even the few guys who believe they're men still find them attractive.
-   Judging by the many statements and fanworks of the fangirls, **Transformers: Prime** follows this trope.
