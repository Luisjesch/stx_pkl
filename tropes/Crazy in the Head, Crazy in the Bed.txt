Crazy in the Head, Crazy in the Bed: 
_"Today, after a 2-month relationship, I realized two things: A) Dating a known psycho because "crazy chicks are great in bed" is a dumb idea, and B) What crazy chicks are actually great at is beating the crap out of you and driving you to alcoholism."_

The stereotype that a person who's mentally unstable makes for a passionate and satisfying lover.

This is due to the belief that their mental instability makes them more enthusiastic and uninhibited, often being into unthinkable kinky stuff that a "normal and boring" person never would be. Power Dynamics Kink and Romanticized Abuse are frequently involved.

If they're obsessed with a person in specific, such as a Yandere or a Stalker with a Crush, there is the idea that they're so utterly devoted to that person's needs that they will go to any lengths in order to satisfy them.

This can be the excuse for why someone would want to remain in a relationship with someone who's obviously unhinged or why they want to have Sex with the Ex with their Psycho Ex-Girlfriend.

This archetype is most commonly attributed to women since All Men Are Perverts and are more willing to look past a person's flaws as long as they're getting laid. Sometimes they can see it's a bad idea, but will still consider the experience to be Worth It. Openly crazy men are usually not seen as attractive to women unless they also invoke a bad boy aura or a woman dates them under the belief they can "fix him".

Sister trope to Cute But Psycho, which tends to feature characters who are somewhat younger, focusing more on things like high school crushes than adult sexual relationships.

Expect the phrase "Daddy Issues" to be mentioned at least once.

This stereotype is commonly applied to Goths.

Compare Aroused by Idiocy, which is about intelligence rather than mental illness. Frequently overlaps with The Ophelia; see also Dominatrix, Mad Love, Sadist, Sex God, and Sex Is Violence. The trope itself can be considered Unfortunate Implications due to it sexualizing and fetishizing women with mental health issues in addition to being an offshoot of Hysterical Woman, which itself portrays women as overly emotional and mentally unstable.

Crazy in the Head, Crazy in the Bed Example in Literature

-   **The Age of Madness** has the Judge, a ruthless and unhinged revolutionary who takes great pleasure in having people thrown off of a tower. Her insanity is reflected by her visual appearance as well: she always wears a ragged red dress and goes barefoot, and likes to demonstratively put up her dirty bare feet on the table during the court hearings. However, she emits so much sexual energy that it's difficult even for her enemies to resist her charms (like Gunnar Broad, who eventually becomes her lover).
-   **Binder of Shame**: The narrator mentions that one of his returns to gaming happened after he fell foul of this belief.
    
    I had been torn between a very pretty and level headed brunette and a deeply disturbed redhead. For a time I couldn't decide which of the two I was \[to\] date exclusively.  
    Like most men I went with the crazy redhead and it ended in disaster. A very sexy disaster but a disaster nonetheless.
    
-   **Odd Thomas**: Odd's father firmly believes that the more unstable a woman is, the better she'll be in bed. Odd's mother must have been a fantastic lay by that logic since her method of dealing with stress in Odd's childhood was to threaten to shoot herself every time he needed something (and once even pressed a gun to his eye because he was coughing).
-   Played for disturbing horror in **A Study in Emerald**, where a debauched German prince (the Humanoid Abomination spawn of a Lovecraftian cosmic entity and a human) is lured into a trap by Sherlock Holmes with the promise of raping a virgin driven to madness by his appearance.
    
    Having learned a little of his recreational predilections, I told him I had procured for him a girl, abducted from a convent in Cornwall where she had never seen a man, and that it would only take his touch, and the sight of his face, to tip her over into a perfect madness.
    
    Had she existed, he would have feasted on her madness while he took her, like a man sucking the flesh from a ripe peach leaving nothing behind but the skin and the pit. I have seen them do this. I have seen them do far worse.

Crazy in the Head, Crazy in the Bed Example in Podcast

-   In the podcast **Based Camp**, Malcolm theorizes that emotional outbursts are indulged in very attractive women, people are more likely to comfort and soothe them when they're upset. This positive attention serves to reinforce this behavior, and so a hot woman who's treated that way — especially in adolescence — is less likely to learn the kind of emotional regulation that's expected of everyone else. But while a hot woman loosing her composure might get her positive attention in the short term, it doesn't work out for her in the long run. Subpar emotional regulation skills aren't wife material, it doesn't make people want to stick around in the long run.

-   **Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines**: The Malkavians are the vampire clan defined by their madness. Four outfits per clan and gender become available through the course of the story, and while male Malkavians only get sexualized in that their final outfit resembles a pimp's, all four outfits for female Malkavians are heavily sexualized. The first is a cheerleader outfit with too high a thong and too low a skirt. The second is a cowgirl outfit with a bare butt. The third is a sexy cop costume with thigh-high boots. The fourth outfit is a tight leather jumpsuit that would be decent if not for the "XXXploit me" bit on the back. No other player character wears clothes that can be called "inviting" like these.
