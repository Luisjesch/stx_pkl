Beauty Breeds Laziness: 
**Martha**: Aren't you going to help, or are you too pretty?  
**Bethany:** I'm too pretty.

Being attractive certainly has its perks, such as favors, good grades, even getting away with crimes. One subtle, but useful advantage of having good looks is that you can get other people to do work for you.

Some people try to coast through life without any effort whatsoever; For lazy beautiful people, their method of coasting by involves using their looks to manipulate people into doing work for them; they might be an Alpha Bitch who seduces the nerds into doing their homework, an Office Lady who seduces their coworkers and bosses into doing work for them, or a Gold Digger who uses their looks to snag a rich spouse to mooch off of.

While some beautiful people simply use their looks to get out of work by using their beauty as a tool, others see their good looks as an excuse to not work; they hold the opinion that good-looking people are too good for work, and expect the less attractive to enable their survival.

Typically, receive punishment for their slothfulness in one of two ways; either they run into a situation where they cannot use their looks, such as trying to seduce someone who isn't fooled or interested in their seductions, or they lose their looks, and by extension their power, via injury or age.

These characters are often contrasted with a less attractive, but hardworking character; stories that use this dynamic often start with the beautiful character coasting by on their looks, while the ugly character has to work hard and develop character to get ahead. These stories tend to end with the beautiful character experiencing hardship due to relying solely on their looks to get ahead in life, while the ugly character achieves success thanks to their hard work. The overall lesson of these stories is that people who possess a strong work ethic and good character will gain lasting happiness, while those who rely solely on their looks will end up miserable in the long run.

**Note: a character using their good looks to manipulate people into doing stuff for them is not this trope; in order to qualify for this trope a character must use their good looks to either manipulate people to get out of work, or use their good looks as an excuse to avoid work.**

Differs from Pretty Freeloaders in a number of ways:

-   This trope describes characters who deliberately use their looks to mooch off of others and avoid work, whereas a Pretty Freeloader doesn't use their looks to freeload.
-   Characters with this trope don't necessarily live with a character, while a Pretty Freeloader does.
-   Characters with this trait are almost always meant to be disliked, while Pretty Freeloaders are meant to be liked.
-   Characters this trope describes are almost always antagonists, while Pretty Freeloaders are almost always Love Interests.

Sub-Trope of Lazy Bum, Screw the Rules, I'm Beautiful!, and Beauty Is Bad.

Compare Brainless Beauty, Favors for the Sexy, Hired for Their Looks, I Have Boobs, You Must Obey!, Proud Beauty, and Gold Digger. When this type of character is contrasted with an ugly, hardworking person, it's a case of Ugly Hero, Good-Looking Villain and/or Misery Builds Character. See also, Sextra Credit, Sleeping with the Boss, and Sleeping Their Way to the Top for the sexual equivalents of this trope. Related to Privilege Makes You Evil, with beauty being the privilege and laziness being the evil.

-   _The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You_: Defied by resident narcissist Mimimi. She puts in as much work as possible toward making herself beautiful by earning her own money and learning elocution. She's also aware that beauty isn't limited to outside appearances, showing considerable maturity compared to most narcissists, and is able to recognize other people's beauty both inside and out.
-   _Tomie_ is an example of this trope being Played for Horror; she's a beautiful human-like... thing who uses her beauty to leech off of people for luxuries like jewelry, fancy food, and fine clothing to the point of bankruptcy, and when she wants to torment or kill someone, she prefers to manipulate others to do her dirty work for her.

     Fan Works 

-   _The Many Dates of Danny Fenton_ and its spin-offs combine this trope with Future Loser; characters who were good-looking jerks in their respective shows (i.e. Dash Baxter, Bonnie Rockwaller, Mandy Luxe, etc.) end up miserable both financially and romantically because of this trope; in terms of finances, because none of these characters took their education seriously or simply made others do their homework for them, in addition to not having plans for the future, they end up with low-income and crappy jobs. In terms of romance, many of these types of characters end up unlucky in love, due to their good looks being their only positive quality, and most of them lose that advantage as adults.
-   _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_ strongly implies that Misty's sisters offer sex to trainers to throw their matches. Considering the fact that 1: their 8th badge team <sup>For Context&nbsp;</sup>  is as strong as a _2nd badge team_ due to their negligence in training their Pokèmon, 2: they are in danger of being fired as Gym Leaders due to their poor win-loss ratio 3: Violet _outright suggesting sleeping with Ash to make him throw their match_, and 4: they use large amounts of plastic surgery to retain their looks and are spoiled Brainless Beauties, its pretty clear that they are certainly _willing_ to use their looks/sex to avoid work if they can get away with it.

-   _30 Rock_: Deconstructed with Dr. Drew Baird, who's played by the incredibly good-looking Jon Hamm. He doesn't necessarily _want_ to be lazy: he's a medical doctor with various hobbies including tennis, drawing, and cooking. However, Drew is so handsome that everyone always excuses his failures, gives him whatever he wants, and lets him win, so he's never had to try to accomplish anything, to the point where he's not even aware that he's coasting through life—he just assumes everyone's experience is like that. When Liz shows him up by actually putting in some effort at a tennis game, he's genuinely confused about why he isn't automatically winning and ends up throwing a tantrum.
-   _Devious Maids_: Genevieve is clearly used to coasting on her looks. She's a Book Dumb Brainless Beauty and takes pride in how little she can do around the house (which makes her dependent on her maid, Zoila).

-   In _Euphoria_, Maddy's life plan was to use her good looks to land a rich boyfriend and become a kept woman.

-   _Girlfriends (2000)_: Lynn is very well educated, having several college degrees, but due to being a Granola Girl, she doesn't actually like working and would rather get by via mooching off from her friends and from her many lovers, all while keeping her bohemian lifestyle.

-   _Married... with Children_: Marcy's second husband Jefferson is ridiculously attractive, but also incredibly lazy and honestly believes he's "too pretty to work", leaving Marcy to be the breadwinner of the house.

-   _Scream Queens (2015)_: Unsympathetic Comedy Protagonist Chanel Oberlin is a vain Proud Beauty and Alpha Bitch who believes she's entitled to anything just because of how attractive she is, while also being a Brainless Beauty who barely understands how real life works because she coasted through it due to her looks and money. She's even too lazy to remember the names of her Girl Posse and just refers to them by numbers. This is even reflected in her sex life, where all she does is lay in bed while she lets her boyfriends do all the work, and has no sympathy for them if they complain she's a terrible lover.
    
    **Chanel:** I'm sorry, okay? But... I'm hot. I don't have to be good in bed. I just lay here and let hot dudes pork me.

    \[...\]
    
    **Ja'far:** I know that I'm no prize, I'm not so easy on the eyes, I can't rely on looks to get me by.

-   In _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_, Hilda of the Golden Deer House fits perfectly. She's attractive and _knows it_, with several of her supports involving her getting male classmates to perform her tasks and chores for her. Many of her pre-Time Skip conversations and battle quotes imply laziness in other areas as well, such as requesting not to be used in battle. In addition to her beauty, she's the Crest-bearing younger sister of Lord Holst, the greatest hero in the Alliance, making her a very desirable marriage candidate for the aspiring male nobles at the Academy. She knows she doesn't have to work hard to get the cushy life she desires... She then subverts the trope after the time skip where a continent-wide war has broken out and, if the Golden Deer House was chosen, quickly becomes the #2 in the Alliance as well as the monastery's logistician.
