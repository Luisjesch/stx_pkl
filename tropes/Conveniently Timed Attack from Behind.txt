Conveniently Timed Attack from Behind: 
Emilio Largo did not expect to be harpooned in the back.

_"Man, your timing really doesn't suck."_

The hero is cornered. His back is to the wall, his gun is out of ammo, he's bleeding from at least one wound, and the bad guy has him dead to rights. Perhaps the hero is hanging from a ledge by his fingertips with a bad-guy standing over him, and the bad guy is about to play a round of "stomp the fingers". Whatever the case, things look bad for the hero.

But just before the mook can end both the hero and the franchise, one of the hero's allies shoots the mook from behind (or runs him through with a sword, or hits him over the head with something heavy) and thus takes out the mook. Regardless of means, someone has just come to the hero's rescue.

Unlike the In the Back trope, this is rarely presented as morally dubious, even though it literally involves shooting someone while their back is turned. The fact that the villain is threatening someone else is justification enough.

Often involves Version A of Bait-and-Switch Gunshot, or in some cases Impaled with Extreme Prejudice. A variation on Big Damn Heroes, sister trope of Thwarted Coup de Grâce. Compare Stab the Scorpion and The Cavalry.

-   In **Baccano!**, when the anachronic storyline finally gets around to showing us some context on Jacuzzi Splot it's to see him in an alley, reasonably enough but a little overeffusively cowering and weeping in front of three guys with guns, begging them to put the guns down. They're rather puzzled because they were expecting a badass. Then it gets weird.
    
    **Jacuzzi:** Please, **I don't want to kill you!**  
    **Mook:** Huh? Isn't it, you don't want to be killed by us?  
    **Jacuzzi:** No... I don't want you to be killed! So please... Donny... I'm sure they're going to put the guns down now... there's no need...
    

And then a giant crushes one of them and an Action Girl cuts their throats, from behind. Jacuzzi has pals.

    -   In fact, for a guy that spends half of the time banging on about his noble blood, and the importance of pride and honour in battle, Vegeta sure does like to fight dirty.
    -   Vegeta's not the only one who does this, though. In the non-serial movie **Cooler's Revenge**, after Cooler is defeated, Salza reveals he's still alive and is about to attack Gohan and the exhausted Goku, but proceeds to eat a Special Beam Cannon through his back courtesy of Piccolo.

-   In **Puella Magi Madoka Magica**, Madoka is about to sign a contract with Kyubey to help Sayaka at the end of episode 8, when suddenly, time freezes, and the next thing you see is a frozen Kyubey with holes shot through him, resulting in a ...the heck just happened?" reaction if you're watching for the first time. We then find this was caused by Homura, who stopped Madoka just in time by shooting Kyubey.

    **Thresh:** Just this time, Twelve. For Rue.
    
-   **Indiana Jones**, **Raiders of the Lost Ark**:
    -   Marion Ravenwood knocks out a mook from behind with a burning log during the bar fight near the beginning just as he's about to shoot Indiana Jones.
    -   She does this sort of thing again later during the fight on and around the Nazi plane. A German pilot is about to shoot Indy when he's hit over the back of the head, and we see Marion Ravenwood lifting some airplane wheel chocks triumphantly.

-   **Judge Dredd**:
    -   **Judge Dredd**:
        -   An extreme example occurs where this trope occurs not once, but twice **in the same scene.** During the confrontation with the desert cannibals. Toward the end of the fight, Dredd is about to be speared by the patriarch of the cannibal clan, when the bad guy is killed by a shot from the "cleanup team" sent to make sure that Dredd didn't survive. After the ensuing shoot-out, Dredd is again cornered only to have his attacker shotgunned by Judge Fargo, Dredd's mentor. Fargo is then literally skewered by the cyborg cannibal a few seconds after saying hello.
        -   And at the climax of that same movie, Dredd is hanging by his fingertips, with the recently-deceased Big Bad's mad scientist henchman standing over him with a gun, gloating about shooting him. Cue the Bait-and-Switch Gunshot as Judge Hershey, Dredd's partner, shoots the scientist from behind, saving his life. Using this trope three times in one movie may well qualify for some sort of record.
    -   Handled much more conservatively in the newer adaptation **Dredd** than in the earlier **Judge Dredd** (see above). The timing is a little off here, so Dredd has to stall his intended killer for a few seconds before Judge Anderson can show up from behind and blow the guy away.
        
        **Dredd:** Wait.  
        **Lex:** "Wait?" Are you kidding me? Did you just say, "Wait"? Judge Dredd — **the** Judge Dredd — finally gets on the wrong end of a gun and all he says is, "Wait." You know what? I expected more from you. I mean, wait for what? Wait for me to change my mind? Wait for another two or three seconds of life because you are so fucking weak you can't stand to see it end?  
        **Dredd:** No.  
        **\[Anderson shoots Lex from behind\]**  
        **Dredd:** Wait for her to shoot you.

    -   **The Two Towers** has a similar scene twice. After Merry and Pippin are captured, one of the orcs is about to kill a helpless Pippin, when he's suddenly stabbed from behind by a Rider of Rohan. A short time later, the same orc has Merry at his mercy ... and is promptly stepped on from behind by Treebeard.
    -   **The Return of the King** features a scene where it seems Frodo (captured, naked, bound, weaponless, and Ringless) is about to be killed by an Orc:

While Chisholm is monologuing and prolonging Bogue's strangulation, Bogue is busily fishing a derringer out of his pocket with which to shoot Chisholm. Emma shows up just in time to shoot Bogue before Bogue can shoot Chisholm. Played with in that Emma comes up behind Chisholm and not Bogue in order to deliver the fatal shot.

    -   Inverted in **The Avengers**, when Loki stabs Agent Coulson in the back, killing him and sparking the Avengers Initiative.

        **Pirate:** SAY GOODBYE!  
        **\[a sign's chain conveniently breaks, causing it to smash the pirate\]**

D'Artagnan apologises for this unsportsmanlike action, as he had to save his daughter at all cost.

    **Daumer:** You're incredible, Ryback. It's a shame you weren't working for us...

-   An interesting variation happens in **Unsounded**, where it wasn't completely clear if the person being saved, Bastion Winallis, was going to be killed (or worse) or not, (at least immediately), and that the person saving them (an Efheby, a type of immortal Naga) is the boss of the people threatening them. This boss also doesn't kill the person with the weapon (a knife embued with its venom), but rather the person next to them. By impaling them on it's forearm. It has the same effect, though, thoroughly disuading the attacker from continuing.

Conveniently Timed Attack from Behind Example in Western Animation

-   Occurs in the first episode of **Courage the Cowardly Dog**. Katz manages to tire out Courage by defeating him in a game of squash before grabbing him by the throat and preparing to feed him to one of his man-eating spider pets. However, as he is distracted laughing uncontrollably, Muriel knocks him out with a tennis racket saving Courage.
-   **Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo**: Has a variant in the first episode. Shaggy, Scooby, and his nephew are **above** the other three, though the three manage to launch Scrappy so that he can land **behind** the Scarab's head and cover the eyes.
-   In one episode of **Star Wars: The Clone Wars**, Obi-Wan and Duchess Satine have a terrorist leader at the point of their weapons, the villain gloats that they can't do anything before he pulls the trigger on some bombs, lest the pacifist Satine become a hypocrite, or the lovestruck Obi-Wan be made a monster in his love interest's eyes... cue Anakin running him through with his lightsaber, with a few chords of the Imperial March playing as he does.
-   In **ThunderCats** this serves as Mysterious Protector Cheetara's Dynamic Entry, saving young Prince Incognito Lion-O from a headlock by rapping his mugger in the back of the head with her staff.
