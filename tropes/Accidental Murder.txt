Accidental Murder: 
A little anger can lead to a huge consequence!

**Pi:** I swear, that was an accident.  
**Ennesby:** Congratulations. You just invented "negligent regicide".

Accidental Murder occurs when a situation that wasn't intended to be lethal ends with the death of someone anyway. Occasionally, this happens because a fight just goes too far (Bob and Alice start fighting, and the fight gets more heated than anyone expects, and Alice ends up braining Bob with a heavy object or accidentally knocking him onto something sharp... and she doesn't realize he's dead until it's over). Other times, this happens when innocent bystanders are caught up in someone else's fight and are dead before anyone else realizes they are there (Bob and Alice are fighting; Carol, a friend to both, tries to break it up and gets accidentally shot while Bob and Alice are wrestling for a gun). And sometimes there's no fighting involved at all; the person who dies is killed because the unintentional killer does something stupid.

Either way, it's simply bad luck for the dead guy, and for his killer. No one was meant to die, but someone died anyway. The ultimate result of an Accidental Murder varies. Bob killing Carol (or Alice killing Bob) may cause him to become The Atoner, or make a Deal with the Devil to bring her Back from the Dead. Often the character who committed the Accidental Murder will vow to become a pacifist, although it may just be the first step down a slippery slope of murder and mayhem.

See also I Didn't Mean to Kill Him, which is usually what Bob tells the police when he's arrested<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Compare to Murder by Mistake, where Bob had every intention of killing Alice, but for some reason ended up killing Carol. If the accident involved a gun going off in the wrong place and direction at the wrong time, this trope overlaps with I Just Shot Marvin in the Face. Supertrope to Not-So-Fake Prop Weapon. It can also be caused by someone who's being reckless in a dangerous situation, such as a Drunk Driver or Reckless Gun Usage. Accidental Suicide, i.e. unintentionally killing _yourself_, is an inversion.

Legal note: By definition, in most legal systems "accidental murder" is an oxymoron. For a killing to be considered murder, it requires that the death be intended by the killer or the result of deliberately inflicted injuries the killer could reasonably have expected might be lethal. In most of the situations described above, the charge would be manslaughter, or it might not even be a crime at all, but only a fatal and unfortunate accident. Between the two exists "negligent homicide," which may or may not be the name of the crime (if any).<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  However, that makes for a less evocative title.

There is also a curious variation of the "Accidental Murder" trope, the "Let's Immediately Become Criminals" trope, which involves either an individual or a group. The situation may actually be that there is an abundance of physical evidence and eyewitnesses to corroborate that death was unintentional. Nevertheless, in this version of the trope, it is common for the witnesses and/or the accidental transgressor to decide on faulty logic that, since they will be seen as guilty immediately, that "we have to bury the body" and/or "hide the evidence", despite the fact that in many cases such an act could be ruled death by misadventure. In these cases, trying to cover it up is (ironically) the only actual crime committed.

Not to be confused with Make It Look Like an Accident, a which is when the murder was deliberate but is dressed up to look like this.

Accidental Murder Example in Anime & Manga

-   In **Another**, Reiko's friend Katsumi Matsunaga accidentally killed a student in his class when they were fighting during the summer trip, by pushing the kid to the ground and causing him to get stabbed through the neck with a pointy tree root (the manga has him grab a stone and whack the student over the head during the fight). The kid turned out to be the extra student that caused the Curse of Class 3-3, which made Matsunaga realize what had to be done to lift it. The tape he left hidden in the classroom would prove to be vital 15 years later.
-   Early on in **Bokurano**, the cast is standing on top of Zearth after the first battle after the "tutorial" when Ushiro bumps Waku, and Waku seemingly falls to his death as a result, causing Ushiro to become angry when it seems as though everyone is accusing him of murder. It turns out later that Waku died as a result of piloting Zearth, **and he was already dead before he fell**.
-   **Call of the Night**: Anko ends up shooting Yamori by accident after he tries to stop her from shooting herself, leaving him to collapse on the table. Narrowly subverted when he gets back on his feet less than a minute later, having seemingly become a vampire.
-   Being a mystery series, it happens **many** times in **Case Closed**. A good example takes place when Grumpy Old Man Watanuki tries to push the Office Lady Sanae away from him... but stupidly does so when they're atop of a flight of stairs, causing the poor woman to hit her head and die.
-   **Dragon Ball**:
    -   Goku's grandfather, Grandpa Gohan was killed before the story began. It later turns out that it was by Goku's own hands, after turning into a Great Ape. Since he never retains any memories of said transformation, he didn't put two and two together until **Dragon Ball Z**, when he's fighting Vegeta and sees **him** transform into a Great Ape.
    -   The Tournament Rules state that killing one's opponent in the ring is forbidden. If it does happen, the implication is that the fighter is not held responsible for murder, but are disqualified from the tournament for use of unnecessary force. This almost happens to Videl when she fights Spopovich in the 25th Budokai when she kicks him so hard that his head snaps around a full 180 degrees, and Videl is horrified that it seems she has killed her opponent. However, Spopovich's Majin powers allow him to survive such an injury, so it meant she didn't have a kill on her conscience... and unfortunately, Spopovich retaliated so brutally against her that his partner was seriously creeped out.
-   **Elfen Lied**: When Aiko Takada's abusive father tried to cut a painting she made for her mother with a knife, Aiko pushed him away, causing him to accidentally slash his own throat. Unfortunately for Aiko, her dad's girlfriend happened to walk in at that moment and call the police on her.
-   In **Fairy Tail**, Zeref can do this by standing too close to people as he has Walking Wasteland powers. Understandably, his arrival marks the end of the manga's days as a Nobody Can Die story.
-   In **Full Dive**, Hiro enters **Kiwame Quest** for the first time and encounters two NPCs, Martin and his sister Alicia. When Hiro asks how to exit the village, the pair believe him to be going mad and attempt to stop him from leaving, knowing that it is illegal to do so. The confrontation quickly turns violent and Hiro, reaching his Rage Breaking Point, tackles Martin. However, since Martin was eating an apple slice with a knife, Hiro's tackle caused him to shove the knife through his throat, killing him instantly. Hiro, quickly remorseful, tries to explain it was an accident and he's sorry, but Alicia, who witnessed the whole thing, is too distraught to care about that and is becoming more insane. Thus, Hiro runs out of the house... with a murderously vengeful Alicia following him.
-   **Fullmetal Alchemist**: Scar killed the Rockbells after regaining consciousness after his family was killed, discovering that his brother's arm was now attached where his own once was and freaked out when he saw them and was reminded of the Amestrian soldiers. His brother's arm, which can deconstruct matter for alchemical transmutations, activated, killing the Rockbells and leaving their daughter Winry an orphan.
-   **Future Diary**: In Yuno Gasai's backstory, she got the better of her abusive parents and locked them in the same cage they locked her in as payback, intending to let them out when they repented. She left them in too long and they starved to death.
-   In **Higurashi: When They Cry** during the manga arc **Onisarashi-Hen** (Demon Exposing Arc), it's implied that Aki Kimiyoshi's death, Natsumi's grandmother, actually was an accident due to Natsumi shoving her away and Aki hitting her head. However, Aki's death is still responsible for leading to Natsumi's Sanity Slippage, which Aki herself started to go through as a result of the Hinamizawa Disaster and fear of "Oyashiro-Sama's Curse." Natsumi blocked it out and hallucinated that her mother Haruko had stabbed Aki to death.
-   **In the Beginning: The Bible Stories**: Moses accidentally kills the foreman with the decoration of his necklace when the former jumped over the latter to fight him.
-   **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure**:
    -   **Diamond is Unbreakable**: When Masazo Kinoto is being too conspicuous about not wanting people to see his back, Rohan's curiosity drives him to look. Which activates Kinoto's Stand, Cheap Trick, killing the man and causing the Stand to latch onto Rohan's back instead.
    -   **Golden Wind**: Since Black Sabbath is an automated Stand, Polpo doesn't have direct control over its actions, so the death of Giorno's school janitor death wasn't of his volition.
    -   **Steel Ball Run**: During the last fight with Funny Valentine, Johnny launches several attacks that instantly get diverted by D4C: Love Train, causing the attacks to instead kill civilians from afar each time Johnny makes a move.
    -   **JoJolion**: While chasing Satoru Akefu, Josuke, Yasuho, and Rai are attacked by his Stand, Wonder of U, which seems to amplify the force of objects that collide into them. Josuke injures himself in one of these attacks and accidentally splashes his blood onto a nearby hospital patient, who is angered and tries to grab Josuke. Josuke blocks his hand with bubbles and ends up reflecting the force of the collusion into the patient, which is strong enough to snap his neck.
-   **Gundam**:
    -   **Mobile Fighter G Gundam**:
        -   The rules specifically state that Thou Shalt Not Kill, but also that if a fighter is **accidentally** killed in battle, their opponent won't be held accountable. This plays into one episode's plot, where Sai Saici is hounded by a fighter who was killed by Explosive Instrumentation while fighting Sai's grandfather and got revived by the Devil Gundam. At first Sai, who is TERRIFIED of the supernatural, thinks the mummy wants vengeance, but it turns out that he just wants to have the fight that his death denied him. Sai obliges and his opponent finally passes on, but after the DG Cells forcibly revive him a second time, Domon steps in and uses his Shining Finger to destroy the corpse once and for all.
        -   Also, George De Sand accidentally helped a sociopathic contestant accidentally kill **an entire Coliseum crowd**. See, the contestant was taking pot-shots at the audience, forcing George to block his missiles with his Gundam, and the president of Neo-France decided this was the last guy you'd let represent your country in the Gundam-Olympics and disqualified him. In response, the contestant decided to unleash his payload straight at the president, George grappled his opponent to save the president, but then the entire payload was misfired straight into the audience. **Nobody in the bleachers survived**.
    -   The HD remaster of **Mobile Suit Gundam SEED** did this for Nicol Amalfi's death. In both versions, he's killed when he charges the Strike Gundam trying to protect his friend and teammate Athrun. In the original, Kira swings the Strike's BFS and cuts the Blitz in half; in the remaster, the Blitz runs into the outstretched but motionless sword instead. This change rubbed many fans the wrong way, since not only did it seem stupid for Nicol to just run into the sword, but it added to the perception that Kira is the Creator's Pet of **SEED**'s controversial director, Mitsuo Fukuda, and the change was made to absolve him for the original killing.
    -   In **Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam**, during one of the Titans' attempts to reclaim the stolen Gundam Mk-II, Jerid Mesa is given a bomb and ordered to shoot it if Kamille Bidan tries anything funny. It isn't until after he shoots it that he discovers it was actually a space capsule with Kamille's mother locked inside. Jerid honestly tries to apologize, but Kamille is too blinded by rage to listen and the whole thing just becomes yet another entry in their ever-growing Cycle of Revenge.
    -   Before all of them is Lalah Sune's death in **Mobile Suit Gundam**. Amuro Ray had gotten the advantage over Char Aznable's Gelgoog and was preparing to deal the final blow with his beam saber. At the last second, Lalah flew her Elmeth into Char, knocking him away and getting stabbed herself, forever cementing Amuro and Char's own rivalry.
-   **Rurouni Kenshin**:
    -   Inverted: A bad guy manages to push Kenshin to the point where he reverts to Battousai and starts killing people, the first in line being said bad guy. Only it turns out that the sword Kenshin used was the other Reverse Blade Sword, meaning Kenshin has committed accidental non-murder.
    -   Kenshin also accidentally kills his first wife, Yukishiro Tomoe, before the beginning of the series (he was trying to fight off an enemy, she attempted to help him, both enemy and girl get hit...), which is what motivates him to give up killing in the first place.
-   In the anime-only Asgard Saga of **Saint Seiya**, the warrior Volker was giving an unnamed Worthy Opponent a huge Curb-Stomp Battle but decided to let him go when he found out he was a married man. Said opponent, however, mistakenly thought that Volker was underestimating him and attacked anyway. Volker fought back and, much to his surprise, not only he fatally struck the other warrior **but also killed his wife**, who attempted to protect her wounded husband by Taking the Bullet for him. **Then**, Volker heard the cries of a baby boy coming from a nearby cabin, realizing that he had also orphaned an innocent kid... He'd spend the next 15 years harshly training and raising the boy, Mime, as his heir, brewing a Thanatos Gambit to have Mime grow strong enough to kill him and punish him for his crime.
-   In **Sword Art Online**, Renly and his friend were competing in a sword tournament when Renly's overhead slash broke his friend's weapon and inflicted a fatal wound on him, even though the tournament was not to the death. The incident traumatized Renly and led to him becoming a self-loathing coward.
-   **Takopi's Original Sin**: When Takopi attempts to defend Shizuka from Marina, the blunt force of the Happy Camera hits Marina's head hard enough to kill her.
-   **The Testament of Sister New Devil**: When Basara Toujou and Yuki Nonaka were about ten years old, a member of the Hero Clan got possessed by the demonic sword Brynhildr and went on a rampage. When the possessed man was about to kill them, a desperate Basara unleashed his ability, Banishing Shift, but used too much power, which completely annihilated not only the man, but everyone and everything within about a city block radius except for himself and Yuki. Even though it was an accident, the Hero Clan banished Basara and later tried to kill him out of revenge.
-   **Wolf's Rain**:
    -   Toboe, a wolf pup, unintentionally killed his elderly human owner/grandma because he didn't realize his strength.
    -   Toboe later killed a girl's pet hawk when he tried to grab it.

Accidental Murder Example in Comic Books

-   **The Avengers**: In **The Trial of Yellowjacket**, Hawkeye spots Egghead, the man who had taken advantage of Hank Pym's poor fortunes, preparing to shoot the former hero in the back. Hawkeye fires an arrow in the barrel of the gun, intending on blocking him from firing, but it entered just as Egghead pulled the trigger, causing feedback that exploded and killed him. Hawkeye is horrified by this and is even willing to be put on trial (both by a court of law and his fellow Avengers), being found not guilty of his actions by both groups.
-   **Daredevil**: **Daredevil (Chip Zdarsky)** starts with one by Matt Murdock himself: after Matt goes out as Daredevil despite still being in recovery, he goes after a pair of petty thieves, and accidentally knocks one to the ground, slamming his head against a curb, and causing a fatal brain aneurysm. A lot of the rest of the book is Matt trying to deal with inadvertently violating his Thou Shalt Not Kill policy. Badly.
-   **Judge Dredd**: One story had the judges investigating the apparent suicide of radio DJ Cool Johnny Cool. The pre-cogs discover that the DJ himself was also a pre-cog who was picking up the combined thoughts of all of the people in Mega-City One who hated him and how narcissistic and annoying he was and wanted him to kill himself, which due to his power he was compelled to actually do it. The pre-cogs even note that for Johnny to be affected like this with his power **millions** of people would have to have wanted him to kill himself in order for him to do it. Dredd notes they can't arrest people for just **wishing** someone would off themselves just because it resulted in him actually doing it.
-   **The Maze Agency**: In issue #7, the killer never intended to kill anyone. They were attempting to erase sensitive information on the Victim of the Week's computer using a powerful electromagnet. However, the victim - who was seated at his computer at the time - had a bullet lodged in his chest from an earlier wound. The electromagnet shifted the steel bullet, which hit his heart, killing him: leaving a seemingly impossible murder of someone who had been shot in the heart with no entrance wound.
-   **Spider-Man**:
    -   **Symbiote Spider-Man** shows the first time that Mysterio killed as a supervillain; while robbing a bank, he forced the teller to open the vault for him, only for her to get accidentally shot by a security guard because of how he dodged the guard's gunfire. The experience shocks and traumatizes him badly enough that Mysterio briefly considers quitting crime… until a symbiote-wearing Spider-Man beats him viciously while trying to arrest him despite Mysterio being defenseless, causing Mysterio to redouble his desire for revenge against the Wallcrawler.
    -   There's also the infamous **Spider-Man versus Wolverine** one-shot. Spider-Man and Wolverine ultimately got into a fistfight over the life of one of Wolverine's old flames, Charlemagne. Wolverine decided to back off and walk away and Charlemagne took advantage of this, sneaking up on Spidey. Still on an adrenaline high and his Spider-Sense going crazy, Spidey swung as hard as he could, thinking it was Wolverine coming back to finish him off... and struck Charlemagne, killing her. This is the only time Spidey's killed and it still haunts him to this day, even used in the Daredevil example above.
-   **Superman**:
    -   In **A Mind-Switch in Time**, Euphor sends three minions after Superboy.

Instead of exhausting themselves, though, the three mooks push themselves until their bodies become consumed by their own powers.
    -   In **Final Crisis**, Mandrakk killed Zillo Valla, who was giving Superman advice from the sidelines, in an attempt to silence her. He is unaware that she was his former lover as the look on his face goes from arrogance to horror.
    -   One of these factors into the pre-Crisis origin story of the villain Terra-Man. An alien currency thief attempted to stun a Wild West outlaw who attacked him but overcharged his powers in rage and killed him instead. Feeling remorseful, he took the outlaw's son in as his protege, leading to the boy becoming Terra-Man.
-   **Transformers: Last Bot Standing**: In the backstory, Strongarm, having suffered a Sanity Slippage from Gripper’s Cruel and Unusual Death sometime after they and Rodimus Prime arrived on Donnokt, tried to escape the planet to find other surviving Cybertronians in the cosmos.

-   **Wonder Woman** Volume 1: From their prior fights Diana knows that tossing Artemis's sword away will get the unrelenting undead Amazon to stop attacking her to retrieve it. In their final fight when Diana kicks the sword into a plane she is surprised and horrified to discover that being far enough away from the sword causes Artemis to crumble into ash and die a final death. By her people's reckoning, Artemis was already dead, but Diana is still upset to have brought about her demise.
-   **X-Men**: During **X-Cutioner's Song**, a mutant named Kamikaze attempted to sneak up on and attack Archangel. Unaware of his attacker, Archangel spread his metallic wings, decapitating Kamikaze.

Accidental Murder Example in Fan Works

He tried to sell her little sister Maggie to his pedophile boss in a drunken rampage, and while trying to make him let her go, Selina pushed the man into the path of an oncoming bus. Despite this being her greatest sin according to a magic conscience-reading sword, she's never been **too** torn up about it, since it was done in defense of Maggie.
-   In the **Better Bones AU**, Ivypool doesn't mean to kill Antpelt's spirit; she deliberately uses killing force against him because in everyone's experience Dark Forest cats (who are the spirits of dead cats) always come back when you kill them, but unbeknownst to anyone this only applies when they are killed by another Dark Forest cat. Being killed by a living cat renders them Deader than Dead. Ivypool is thus horrified by her actions.
-   **Blackened Skies**: The first murder happens this way; as it turns out, the culprit was unaware that their recently acquired parasol had a hidden blade until it came out on its own during a struggle.
-   Jin has committed this twice in his life in **BlazBlue Alternative: Remnant**. In Chapter 66, we learn that an envious cousin of his adoptive family tried to kill him when he was named the heir, only for him to inadvertently impale the cousin with Yukianesa in self-defense.

-   In **The Bridge**'s spin-off crossover with **The Shimmerverse**, **The Bridge: A Shimmer in the Dark**, the death of Sunset Shimmer's biological mother at the hooves of Countess Mircalla was this.

-   **Danganronpa: In Harmony's Wake**:
    -   This is a major part of the second trial. It is discussed that the Death Trap that killed Apple Bloom was activated by the stage lights, and Flash Sentry, realizing that since he was the one handling the light for the magic show, wonders if **he** is guilty for her death. Monoponi however declares activating a trap does not make you the blackened, only setting it up with the intent of killing someone. However, the true blackened was aiming to kill Sunset Shimmer with the trap, but Apple Bloom was killed by accident instead, because she spotted the trap and shoved Sunset and Trixie to safety at the cost of her own life.
    -   It is later revealed that Adagio accidentally killed someone once. She explains that a few years ago, she and her sisters came across three homeless men and they used their magic to manipulate them into arguing so they could feed off it as a quick snack. But they underestimated how much hate the three had for each other, resulting in one of them being beaten to death.
    -   This is zig-zagged with Fluttershy's death. It is discussed in the trial that Pinkie Pie was the one who planted the ring on Fluttershy, which got her executed for allegedly breaking the rules. But, Pinkie Pie acted as an Unwitting Pawn, being tricked into planting it on Fluttershy as a surprise, and is thus considered innocent. The one who faked the note, tricking her into planting the ring, was actually Sci-Twi. Although she never intended for things to go that far, believing that Fluttershy would notice Pinkie planting the ring and stop her, as a way to teach Pinkie a lesson about the Killing Game, the fact was she still planned everything and put it in motion herself, meaning it was ultimately her fault and isn't considered an accident.

-   **Emergence**:
    -   Weiss Schnee wakes up in the real world in Ukraine. When she gets accosted by soldiers, she fights back, thinking that her attacks will simply knock them out. Since Earth humans don't have superhuman abilities like Aura, her attacks slice and skewer them, to her horror.

-   **A Familiar Void**:
    -   When Louise summons the Knight after its demise, she believes that she accidentally killed her would-be familiar by her explosion. It is soon fixed when she kissed its mask.

Given Saeros' Hate Sink status, the in-universe consensus ends up being "he had it coming" but Túrin still runs off in shame.

    He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die  
    I told 'em it's too late my friend, its time to say goodbye  
    And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt.

        Yellow tape around my body, it's a homicide

Obviously, the trope is still played straight when the player fails to rescue a trapped person in time.

Accidental Murder Example in Visual Novels

-   **Ace Attorney**:
    -   Dee Vasquez killed Jack Hammer, but it wasn't her intention. **He** was trying to murder **her** — she just pushed him away from her, resulting in him falling on top of a wrought iron fence that impaled him. Self-defense, in a nutshell. Crosses over with Death by Irony, since Hammer had previously accidentally killed someone by pushing him on top of that same fence. In fact, the whole reason he tried to kill Vasquez was that she covered up the incident and used it to blackmail the hell out of him.
    -   Discussed in "Turnabout Goodbyes". Miles Edgeworth has been plagued by guilt and nightmares for fifteen years even since the day his father Gregory died, inspired by the fear that he's the one who accidentally killed him as a child when he tried to another man from strangling him; he picked up a gun that was lying on the floor, threw it at them, and promptly blacked out from oxygen deprivation from being confined in a sealed elevator. When he came to, his father lay there, dead from a shot to the heart. Phoenix and Maya eventually prove that Edgeworth wasn't the killer; the bullet pierced the elevator door and shot Manfred von Karma, who despised Gregory for incurring the one and only penalty on his legal record by exposing him for coercing a confession. The doors opened, von Karma saw Gregory passed out and vunerable, picked up the gun, and got his revenge.
    -   Discussed in "The Magical Turnabout".

    -   Twisted around in **Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair**, where an accidental murder does indeed happen... **exactly as the victim planned**! Nagito Komaeda engineers an elaborate suicide-by-proxy where nobody, not even the killer, would realize a killing had even taken place until it was too late. He did this because he discovered that the entire class including himself were members of Ultimate Despair, except for the traitor. Since the rest of the class symbolized despair in his mind, the traitor must, therefore, symbolize hope, and thus he felt that only the traitor deserved to live. However, he didn't know who the traitor was, and thus counted on his Ultimate Luck to make it so that the traitor was the one to actually murder him. The idea was that the class would either assume he committed suicide on his own and vote for him as the culprit, or they would figure out his plan to make one of them accidentally kill him but wouldn't be able to figure out who it was and have to blindly guess, most likely guessing incorrectly. Chiaki, however, figures out his real motivation and outs herself as the traitor in order to spare everyone else.

-   Played for Laughs in **Captain SNES: The Game Masta**. In Mysidia, the Elder attempts to thank Frog for his valiant efforts by lifting the curse of his frog form, over Frog's objections. One quick casting of **Esunaga** later and Frog is once again Glenn... albeit very briefly, as the curse quickly takes hold again. After the Elder has tried again and again without lasting success, he explains in frustration that Esunaga should be working just fine even on such a powerful curse, because it works by directly addressing whatever cause is keeping the curse in place, to begin with. Frog explains that the curse is tied to the life of his old arch-enemy, Magus, which means the Elder, unbeknownst to either of them at the time, had killed Magus with each casting of Esunaga.
