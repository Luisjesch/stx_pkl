Break His Heart to Save Him: 
_"You're a great actress, Satine. Hurt him. Hurt him to save him."_

So, you've got someone you deeply care about, and who cares just as much about you. However, you know the two of you cannot stay together: being near you, or just the fact that he loves you is putting him at risk. You tried telling him, "It's Not You, It's My Enemies", but it didn't work—he knows he'll be in danger, and he's okay with that.

But you're not. So, you lie to him. You pretend to be mean, callous, and completely disrespectful of his feelings. You say you never loved him. You do everything you can to make him hate you, because you know that's the only way he'll stay away from you and, in turn, from danger: you have to break his heart to save him.

The human version of Shoo the Dog, quite possibly the most extreme manifestation of I Want My Beloved to Be Happy; this is when a character does ostensibly hurtful things to their beloved because they know it's the only way to protect them from some sort of even greater harm. Cruel to Be Kind is the supertrope. Can lead to a character regretting taking an action that they now believe Was Too Hard on Him. Note that when this trope is done poorly, it will often collide with the Idiot Ball if there's an obvious solution to the problem that does _not_ require such a drastic step or your deprivation of key information is actually going to put that person in greater danger than being honest would have. In particular, it's likely to backfire spectacularly when the pain of the breakup just drives the other person to do exactly the thing you needed them _not_ to do (and especially if you skipped the "It's Not You, It's My Enemies" step).

Unsurprisingly, while it usually works temporarily, in many cases, it doesn't hold up for very long.

Break His Heart to Save Him Example in Anime & Manga

-   **Attack on Titan** gives us a rather gut-wrenching one: In Chapter 112, Eren (Yes, **that** Eren) verbally assaults Mikasa over her devotion to him, claiming it was only due to her Ackermann genetic programming and likens her to a slave, to the point that it reduces her to tears and causes Mikasa to stop wearing the scarf Eren gave her when they first met. Come Chapter 130, and it turns out the Ackermann programming story was all a lie Eren made up, and that he had known she was in love with him for a long time, and even reciprocated her feelings; however, due to his Titan-Shifting powers slowly killing him and his own plans to destroy all of humanity outside the walls to protect Paradis with the Rumbling he knew spurning her and driving her away was the only way to keep her from going down with him.
    -   Add in another layer of sadness when it was revealed that he wasn't just trying to push her away, but was also purposely giving her the drive to **kill** him, which she eventually does.
    -   Just to hammer the point, Eren spends his final moments lampshading the meme to Armin, asking him to keep the masquerade forever painting Eren as the villain and Mikasa as the heroine of humanity and adding that he deeply regrets not having been able to love Mikasa as she deserved, but he was left no choice
-   In one of the last chapters of **Beastars**, Louis coldly rebuffs Juno despite the growing mutual attraction between then, as he realizes that his inherited position in the Horns Conglomerate and plans for the future wouldn't fit her. Juno for her part accepts the rejection and parts with him on good terms, though she also remarks that he'll probably never be satisfied with a fangless kiss ever again.
-   In **Case Closed**, a killer presents herself as a vile person and mocks her fiancé for failing to realize what she really was. However, she sheds a tear while being arrested, implying she was trying to break off the relationship so he would be free to live his life. The fiancé sees right through the attempt and promises to wait for her.
-   In **Castle in the Sky**, Sheeta makes a deal with Muska to let Pazu go free. It involves telling Pazu to return to his home town and forget about her, which he reluctantly does. Fortunately the Sky Pirate Ma Dola points out to Pazu that Muska will undoubtably dispose of Sheeta once he finds Laputa so Pazu joins with her gang to get her back.
-   **Chainsaw Man**: In Part 2, Yoru tasks Asa with killing Denji to turn his body into a weapon. When Asa starts falling In Love with the Mark, she tries to push Denji away by saying that she hates him and asked him out only because she was bored. It doesn't work for long before Yoru takes control of her body and escalates the seduction with a kiss.
-   **Code Geass**:
    -   Lelouch does this a couple of times to Kallen in R2. In the first instance, he pretends that he was merely using Kallen as a pawn to drive her away, when in reality he was trying to save her from being killed by the rebelling Black Knights. He betrays his intentions with a soft, barely audible, "Live on, Kallen." In the second instance, when Kallen confronts the newly-crowned Emperor Lelouch about his parting sentence and kisses him, he feigns a lack of emotion to again drive her away and make sure that when he dies as part of his planned Zero Requiem, Kallen will not die with him.
    -   Ironically, she caught on as she saw the Requiem in action, but by that point there was nothing she could do except watch and let it unfold.
    -   The third Compilation Movie implies he was also doing it for the other Black Knights, as this time, they aren’t as convinced by his act and try reasoning with him to tell the truth. Schneizel’s men are the ones that try to kill him, much to the Black Knights’ objection, but Lelouch probably still doesn’t want to put them in danger along with Kallen.
    -   C.C. abandoned Mao with this in mind when she felt he was becoming too obsessed with her. It ended up backfiring big time, when Mao went insane due to his Geass incontinence.
    -   Lelouch also does it to his sister, Nunnally, when she asks if everything he did was for her. Though granted, she was also with Cornelia and Schneizel, so it's not like he could have answered it truthfully anyway.
-   **Cyberpunk: Edgerunners** mercilessly deconstructs this in Episode 8. After David attacks "Doc", Lucy pleads David to downgrade his cybernetics, leading him to consider breaking up with her. This causes her to panic and begs for them to stay together... only to be interrupted by her detecting a netrunner getting close to finding out about David. Rather than telling David the truth about Arasaka targeting him for his tolerance of cybernetics or providing him a firm answer on the future of their relationship, she runs off in the middle of their conversation. This is all however worsened when it's revealed that the "netrunner" was a deliberate trap by Faraday designed to bait Lucy in, creating a situation that necessitates David to voluntarily install the Cyberskeleton and rescue her from Arasaka at the expense of his own life. In trying to keep the love of her life safe, Lucy's actions inadvertently destined him to die, a fact that hits hard on her when she reaches the moon.
-   **Daimos**: To get closer to Olban and accomplish her mission to ensure peace between Earthlings and Balmians, Erika shot Kazuya with a real gun. She pretended she had only been toying with him and that she was willing to get the power from being with Olban, leaving Kazuya utterly heartbroken. If she didn't do that, she wouldn't be in a position to attempt to assassinate Olban and cause the chain of events that led to Olban's death, with their mission accomplished and Kazuya learning the truth.
-   **Dear Brother**: While Kaoru isn't a jerk to begin with, she does this to Takehiko after she shows him her scars from her mastectomy as a result of breast cancer because she doesn't want him to suffer for her illness. They make it up years later and they eventually got married (in the manga, she dies from her illness a few years later and in the anime, they had a child).
-   In a particularly extreme example, Chikane's rape of Himeko in **Destiny of the Shrine Maiden**.
-   In **Dragon Pilot: Hisone and Masotan**, despite harboring genuine feelings for her, Yukata deliberately makes a total ass of himself, even lying and saying that he was only nice to her because he wanted to sleep with her, towards Hoshino to make her despise him, so she could fly with her dragon without distraction. After the Ritual is over, Hoshino finds out the truth and they make up.
-   Miaka tries doing this to Tamahome in **Fushigi Yuugi** because, as she found out, as the priestess of Suzaku she cannot be involved with her bodyguard. Later on, Tamahome in turns tries this on Miaka when he finds out that she will never be allowed to stay in the book, even if she wishes it to Suzaku.
-   In **Gintama**, Hijikata knows that his life choices involve a lot of danger and will probably kill him. So he rejects Mitsuba (Okita's sister) to spare her that grief and give her the opportunity to find happiness with someone else.
-   **Haou Airen**: Once Kurumi's Stockholm Syndrome sets in, Hakuron tries this technique on her a lot because he realizes that his enemies will do horrible things to her if he appears to care for her. He even goes so far as to make her be Fuuron's mistress instead of his own. It doesn't work very well.
-   **Kiznaiver**: This trope is invoked twice in separated occasions, by Nico and Tenga. Both of them believe that the best way to deal with the fact that you have an Unrequited Love for someone is to properly declare your feelings and then, be properly dumped, no matter how painful that is. It'll hurt, but it'll also help both to move on from that.
-   One that ends disastrously in **The Lunacy Of Duke Venomania**: Gumina pretends to be disgusted with her friend Cherubim because her betrothed, Cherubim's brother, thinks they're in love (which they are) and was planning to kill him. Cherubim thinks that it's genuine hatred, and in response slaughters his entire family, steals his brother's identity, makes a Deal with the Devil to charm every woman he wants in order to get her back, becomes the titular Duke and goes slowly insane with lust before being murdered by the lover of one of his victims.
-   **Gundam**:
    -   **Mobile Suit Gundam Wing**: This seems to have been Heero's intention when Relena approached him with an invite for her birthday party, and he replied by shredding it in half, and then threatening to kill her. However, he never follows through with that threat, and several times goes out of his way to protect her despite how that poses a danger for his mission, which leads credence he only acted that way so she'd stay away and not get hurt because of him.
    -   A straighter example in **Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury**: After Miorine confronts Prospera over using Suletta as part of her revenge plot, Prospera agrees to leave Suletta out of her plans… if Suletta loses her next duel, and Aerial along with it. So Miorine ropes Guel (who's also developed feelings for Suletta) into challenging Suletta to a duel, with Aerial as the prize. After Miorine sabotages the duel by shutting Aerial down remotely, she coldly ends their engagement as Suletta loses her status as the Holder.
-   **Musuko ga Kawaikute Shikataganai Mazoku no Hahaoya**: After Chiharu nearly dies from catching demonitis, Lorem and Merii attempt to coldly dismiss her to protect her from the dangers of living around demons. Although it seems to succeed at first, Chiharu returns even more determined than ever to help, going so far as to move into the demon-human compound with them and join a highly-exclusive program to foster demon-human relations.
-   In **My Hero Academia**, Izuku asks All Might if it's possible to become a hero without a Quirk. All Might reluctantly informs him that it simply isn't practical for a Quirkless kid to be sent out into a world of a superpowered villains because of how dangerous it is. He instead recommends that Izuku look into becoming a police officer if he wants to help people. This tears Izuku's heart in two, but All Might did it to keep Izuku from being killed. Then it's subverted when Izuku's reckless attempt to save Bakugo when no one else would inspires All Might to name Izuku his successor and tell him that he **can** become a Hero.
-   **Naruto**:
    -   This is what Sakura truly meant when she gave her infamous fake love confession to Naruto, hoping that he wouldn't keep hurting himself for her and Sasuke. It really didn't work how she wanted it to—he easily sees right through her, calls her out for lying, and rejects her outright by telling her that he **hates** people who lie to themselves.
    -   Two years later, in **The Last: Naruto the Movie**, Hinata reluctantly decides to do this to Naruto by "rejecting" his first Love Confession and "accepting" Toneri's marriage proposal so that she could have a better chance at saving her younger sister Hanabi and the whole world. This time it **works**, albeit with a few bumps, and she immediately apologized to Naruto for it when he came to save her.
-   In the shoujo manga **The One**, the male lead seems to attempt to rape the female lead, who's explicitly told him that she has a crush on him, in order to protect her from being followed and perhaps harmed, either physically or in terms of her career as a model being ruined, by the minions of a very powerful person who is out to get his brother and him, by misleading the stalkers into thinking that he has no feelings at all for the female lead. Yes, it's convoluted.
-   **One Piece**:
    -   When Nami had returned to Arlong Park, she tried to act coldly to the then forming Straw Hats in order to keep them from Arlong's wrath. (Going as far as pretending to stab Usopp in front of Arlong). It doesn't work of course and in fact, against all odds, they end up **beating** Arlong and his crew.
    -   In Chopper's flashback, his father figure Hiriluk does this to spare Chopper from seeing him slowly die from an incurable disease. Chopper later follows Hiruluk and learns the truth, but his attempt to save him only hastens his death.
    -   And later in the series during Robin's flashback, her mother Olvia tries to do this to spare her from the World Government, but she can't deny Robin's pleas to her and breaks down. In that same arc, Robin does this herself to the Straw Hats to protect them from the World Government. They respond by **declaring war on the World Government**, showing that they didn't care about what she had done, and that they were willing to do anything to get her back, because they loved her.
    -   Ace attempts to do this for Luffy as Luffy plunges headfirst into the battle at Marineford and is attacked on all sides by the Shichibukai and Marine officers in an attempt to rescue Ace from his execution. Ace shouts for Luffy to go away, stating that they have their own crews and Luffy is under no obligation to rescue him. He even states that it would be "humiliating" to be saved by a "weakling" like Luffy, all the while silently begging for Luffy not to involve himself in Ace's mistake. Luffy of course just ignores this and shouts that he's Ace's little brother and promises to save Ace even if it killed him.
    -   Platonic example for Sanji in the Whole Cake Island arc; in Chapter 843, he turns down Luffy's attempts to bring him back from Totto Land because his abusive family blackmailed him into marrying Pudding, and if he defied his purpose, his loved ones (especially Zeff) will be killed. Luffy understandably doesn't take it well, to the point that he punches Sanji in the face to get him to come back to the crew.
-   **Sailor Moon**:
    -   In **Sailor Moon R**, when Mamoru starts to have horrifying images about the future where Usagi is in grave danger if they stay together, so he decides to break up with her to protect her. Usagi doesn't take it so well at first since Mamoru refuses to give her at least an explanation as to why they shouldn't stay together, and Mamoru can barely keep up the facade of not liking her since he can still assist her and the other Senshi in fights against Droids. Not shockingly considering the themes of this show, it doesn't stick when Usagi eventually figures it all out and Mamoru finally can't keep up the charade anymore. The real kicker? The visions were actually being sent by his future self, who set up the scenario to ensure the two had a love that was strong enough to withstand the trials ahead.
    -   A much lighter version is done in the manga, when Mamoru gets sick. While he isn't cruel, he still rebuffs her attempts to comfort him and bring him food and medicine, repeatedly driving her away and causing her to feel hurt and lonely. The real reason he keeps doing it is because he knows that there's something unnatural about his disease, and he's afraid that she'll catch it if she goes near him. It turns out that he's right on both counts. The disease is basically caused by an evil power and Usagi does eventually catch it, but doesn't care because she'd rather stay close to him.
-   A particularly weird example happens in a filler arc of **Shadow Star**. A boy who's in a coma but can still use his Dragon uses it to impersonate a friend and tell his young aunt that neither of them ever really liked her. His reasoning is that it'll help her overcome her incestuous crush on him and find new friends as well as soften the blow when he fakes his death to go into the sea with his Dragon and become one of the Virgins.
-   In **Talentless Nana** when Rentarou is hunting down Michiru, Nana tries to save her. When Michiru refuses to leave her side and run away Nana harshly yells at her that she was never her friend and only used her. It seems to work at first.
-   In **The World God Only Knows**, Keima was forced to resort to this during his date with Chihiro, when he realizes that she does not contain one of the Jupiter Sisters. The fact that he was not used to generic character types like her, and that he needs to protect his previous "capture targets" from a looming threat, made him push through with this trope in the worst possible way.

Break His Heart to Save Him Example in Comic Books

-   In **52**, Renee Montoya has gone to an ex-girlfriend, Katherine "Kate" Kane, for information on an abandoned property that her family might own. When Kate reveals that her family **does** own the property, and gives Renee the name of its last occupant, she demands to know what this is about and why Renee needs this information, explaining that Renee at least owes her an explanation. Renee, however, explains that this situation has nothing to do with her and she does not owe Kate **anything**. Kate is visibly crushed, but Renee's narration reveals that, if The Question's theories are correct and Intergang is behind everything, it is not just themselves who are in trouble, but all their friends and loved ones as well. Renee does not want to drag Kate into this. However, unknown to Renee, Kate has her interests in the game.
-   In **Action Comics** #317, Supergirl thinks her friend Lena's boyfriend is an enemy spy so she sets out to break them up and save Lena from a future heartbreak, even if she ruins their friendship.
-   An odd variation from John Byrne's run on the **Fantastic Four**; when Sue Richards was being mind-controlled by Psycho-Man into becoming the murderous Malice, Reed was able to free her from Psycho-Man's control by berating her (and even slapping her across the face) in order to make her hate him, however briefly.
-   **Ghostopolis**: According to her uncle, Frank left Claire because he was afraid his bosses would find out and banish her back to Ghostopolis.
-   The Mall Rats in the **Gold Digger** miniseries **Throne of Shadows**. Lydia McKracken sends away her friends Moisha Rich and Romeo Ellis by insulting them. She knows that as Gothwrain's heir she's the target of every criminal overlord on the planet, and that her friends are as doomed as she is if they stay with her.
-   When Raven of **The New Teen Titans** turned down Beast Boy, he asked if she was doing this. She denied it. He... took it well.
-   In the **Ninja High School: Shidoshi** series, Tetsuo goes against his grandfather in hopes of becoming the clan leader and getting out of an arranged marriage so he can marry his true sweetheart, Nanashi. However his grandfather is too strong and, realizing that he'll kill Nanashi if he continues to defy him, Tetsuo puts on a jerkass performance in order to drive Nanashi away and keep her safe.
-   In **Runaways**, Chase tells Gertrude that sometimes it's necessary to lie to someone a person loves, in order to protect them. She keeps this in mind later, when Chase is in danger of being sacrificed by the past self of Geoffrey Wilder. She pretends to hate Chase for kissing Nico, and tells Wilder exactly how much of a scumbag she thinks Chase is. When she's dying from a knife wound, she is able to tell Chase that she still loved him and lied about him being a bad person.
-   This was common in Silver Age Superman and Batman comics, usually to explain plot twists that would otherwise make the characters out to be total jerks.
    -   In "The Batman Plays a Lone Hand", Bruce tells Dick that he's becoming too much of a bother and he cannot remain Robin any longer. At the story's conclusion, he confesses that it was all a trick to protect him. A gangster named The Thumb warned Bats to keep his nose out of his business or his gang would shoot Robin on sight. To keep his young sidekick safe and catch the crooks, he momentarily tried to put him out of action.

Break His Heart to Save Him Example in Fan Works

-   In the doujin **Alice and Yuuka at Marisa's grave** it's implied that the reason why Yuuka tells Alice that she killed Marisa out of jealousy, and subsequently almost rapes her was that she wanted to snap Alice out of her depression, even at the cost of being hated and remembered as a monster by Alice for the rest of her life. Whether this is true or not (or even if she actually killed Marisa out of jealousy and not by accident) is left ambiguous.
-   A flashback in **Another Fate** has Sakura do this to her brother Rin, saying that she is now a Matou and no longer sees him as family. She does this so that Zouken would not make an example of him or force him through the horrific training Sakura had went through.
-   Professor Layton attempts this in **Beautiful Nightmare**, claiming to have never wanted to be Luke's mentor in hopes that Anton (here actually a vampire) will leave the boy alone if he thought Layton had no attachment to Luke but Anton quickly averts it by casually saying that this just means the Professor shouldn't care if he kills Luke and prepares to start feeding on Luke, which naturally prompts Papa Wolf Layton to beg him to stop.
-   Causes several of the disasters in **But You Alone**, a Hermione/Snape story, in which Severus repeatedly (and at one point, violently) tries to convince Hermione that he doesn't care about her, in order to protect her relationship with Harry (and her life). They eventually reconcile, only to die together. The entire situation really was doomed from the start.
-   A variant in **Cat-Ra**, where Catra does this to Glimmer in front of their captors. Since the latter was mainly caught to act as bait for the former, Catra tries to convince Shadow Weaver to let Glimmer go, and insults and dismisses Glimmer as being a nuisance so she wouldn't argue or attempt rescuing her in turn. While it does work on Glimmer, Shadow Weaver notices that Catra seems to be hiding feelings of guilt when Glimmer starts crying and calls her bluff.
-   **A Chance for a New Dawn**: After Bernadetta is subjected to Mental Time Travel, she transfers over to the Golden Deer and claims that she never cared about the rest of her former classmates in the Black Eagles. She does this primarily because she witnessed all of their deaths in the original timeline, and is hoping to prevent them from getting as involved this time around.
-   In **Cinderjuice**, BJ tries this in order to get Lydia to go back home because she has what the villains are after, and he can't protect her.
-   **Dominoes**: Hakuba and Ran both use this to justify their treatment of Shinichi, believing that it's better to keep him Locked Out of the Loop and out of harm's way. Shinichi turns this tendency against them and breaks up with Ran.
-   In **The Engagement**, the stress of fighting against the extreme elements of her clan makes Hinata attempt to cancel her engagement in order to protect Naruto.
-   **Equestrylvania** has White Dwarf attempt to do this to Pokey Pierce, though it doesn't seem to work.
-   In **Fever Dreams** Light **attempts** to do this with Misa (not because he cares for her, but because Rem is making him protect her) and then Misa says something incriminating and now Light has to create a distraction for the investigators. Played for Laughs:
    
    **Light:** Misa, I admit I've been having sex with Ryuzaki, but it's only because he's so much better looking than you.  
    **Misa:** What!  
    **Light:** Well, to begin with you're too skinny. You should put on some weight. Also, you shouldn't dye your hair. And I hate the gothic lolita style. You should wear regular clothing, like Ryuzaki does. There's nothing wrong with a t-shirt and jeans.  
    **Misa:** But he's a guy! That's disgusting. And he looks horrible. I don't think he even brushes his hair... It can't be. Why would you do this? Light, how do I stop you from seeing him? Is he blackmailing you?  
    **Light:** Misa, I'm not breaking up with you. I can't resist Ryuzaki because I have very exact sexual requirements that he meets, but there is no need for us to stop dating because of this.  
    **Misa:** You'll leave him?  
    **Light:** No, Misa. I told you I can't resist him. The real reason I couldn't leave headquarters is because he always wants to have sex and I give in every time. We're almost constantly doing it. It started before I ever met you. We had sex while we were going to college together. That first night I met you, when you came to my home, and I kissed you, I was thinking about fucking him while we kissed.  
    **Misa:** Light! Light!  
    **Light:** But we don't need to break up, Misa. Let me talk to him. We've had threesomes before, so maybe he'd be willing to let you join in, if I phrased it just right. However, you definitely have to gain some weight first. You don't turn me on at all the way you are now.  
    **Misa:** Threesomes! Threesomes!  
    **Rem:** Light, you're tormenting her!  
    **Light:** Yes, Misa. Matsuda has joined us quite a number of times, and a few other people as well on rare occasions. In fact, I think this would work best if you seduced Matsuda, and then I introduced the idea to Ryuzaki. Yes, why don't you gain a little weight, and seduce Matsuda, and then after that I'm sure Ryuzaki won't object to you joining us. We'll all become a nice stable foursome. You want me to be happy, don't you, Misa? This will make me very happy, and you'll be able to have sex with me that way.  
    **Rem:** Light Yagami, you're giving Ryuk more time, aren't you? This is... necessary.  
    **Light:** Misa, don't worry. Soon everything will be good. Just seduce Matsuda for me, okay? And, one more thing I just thought of. I've never been in anything bigger than a foursome. I'd really like it if you could seduce one of the girls from your modeling agency and bring her along too. Any of them would work. They're all more attractive than you are.
    
-   In **Guardian**, a **Final Fantasy X** fancomic, Lulu joins Zuke's pilgrimage even though (in this story) summoners are not allowed to journey together, which means leaving Yuna behind. Lulu knows it will upset her, but she'd rather leave and possibly die than have Yuna die on a pilgrimage of her own.
-   Shego does this to Kim at the end of **The Healer's Touch**. Their lives are too different and she doesn't want to see a hero like Kim corrupted by her, so she forces Kim away and pretends that their budding relationship was a meaningless fling.
-   **in dreams you follow (but I dream in the dark)**: In order to infiltrate the Akatsuki as The Mole, Kiba kills Danzo and becomes a missing-nin. All of his former friends, family and allies are Locked Out of the Loop, and in order to maintain his cover, Kiba has to pretend he's **happy** to be fighting them, spitting out insults and hitting them where it hurts the most.
-   In **Juxtapose**, All Might breaks Izuku's heart by telling him that he can't become a hero with his limited Quirk. While speaking with Izuku as Toshinori, Izuku says that he doesn't resent All Might for saying that because he knows that the hero only wanted the best for him. But that's when Toshinori tells Izuku that if he worked hard enough, he could apply to Yuuei's General Course and get the recognition necessary to enter the Hero Course by winning the Sports Festival.
-   A downplayed version sets up the premise of **More than Meets the Eye**. Ash rejects Misty's Love Confession by telling her that they're Better as Friends, even though she can tell he's lying to himself, and while she ultimately accepts his excuses, it leaves her heartbroken. Much later, the two once again talk things out, and Ash confesses that his reasons for rejecting her were a mix of thinking that he wasn't good enough for her, and fear of losing their friendship, which he held very dear.
-   **New Game Plus (One Piece)**: After getting his grandfather to train him under the pretense of preparing for a career in the Marines, Luffy ships out to become a pirate. When Garp comes after him, Luffy delivers a Breaking Speech about how he could never become a Marine due to the corruption and extremism of the Marines' highest ranks. No matter what he did, they would always see him as nothing more than the son of the World's Most Wanted Man. Realizing that his efforts to save Luffy were All for Nothing completely **shatters** Garp.
-   **One and Only Son** has a variant where Villetta is breaking both her and Graham's hearts by ending their relationship; however, she's hopeful that they could start over if she survives the coming war.
-   **One Bad Day After**: After the events of **The Killing Joke**, Barbara breaks off her friendship with Supergirl because she believes it's the only way to ensure that she won't be used to hurt her. She breaks not only Kara's heart but her own.
-   **Pray for Us, Icarus**: After Aziraphale's relationships with Crowley's human reincarnations keep ending in tragedy no matter what he tries to do, he begins avoiding Crowley's future reincarnations as much as he can to prevent further heartbreak for the two of them even when it visibly bewilders and saddens Crowley who can still sense that Aziraphale is someone precious to him. However, Aziraphale misses Crowley so desperately that he ultimately can't stick to his resolution to leave him alone.
-   In Volume IV of **The Private Diary of Elizabeth Quatermain**, Elizabeth is blackmailed into marrying the villain, Ben Everett. If she didn't go through with it and put on the happy bride act, he would have her surrogate brother Tom killed and have Skinner, who loves her but Cannot Spit It Out, framed for it. Unfortunately for the villain, the rest of Elizabeth's True Companions figure out what's up.
-   **RWBY: Reckoning** has a unique variant: Yang is blackmailed into doing this to Darrel by Cardin, otherwise, he goes after Ruby and Darrel. It's clear she doesn't want to do it, but she doesn't want Ruby and Darrel hurt either. Thankfully, Cardin gets his just desserts.
-   **RWBY: Scars**: In the past, Qrow attempted this with Summer. The two were High-School Sweethearts raising a baby, but Qrow feared his semblance and affiliation with Salem would harm Summer and Ruby. He lied to Summer and told her that he never loved her, which led to Summer moving out and ending up with Taiyang. This tactic didn't work in the long run as Summer still got involved with Salem and was killed by Qrow.
-   In **spiraling**, Cyrus Drake explains to Ryan that he tried to drive them off on their first day because he met Ryan's future self in the past and knew they would experience many horrors.
    
    **"At first, I wanted to warn you off.” Drake’s face is somber. “The flow of time cannot be undone so easily, but I had to give it a chance. I saw you on that day. The changes, the scars…and before my desk when you came to Ravenwood, a child. I had a glimpse of what you would become. To let a child endure whatever made you into the wizard I saw? It would be unconscionable."**
    
-   In the **Smallville** fic **En Tempus Veritas**, Lana marries Lex with the goal of protecting Clark from Lionel, but this theme is downplayed on Clark's side as he actually made the decision to commit to his new relationship with Lois on the day of the wedding, with the result that Lana's actions are less emotionally painful than they might have been.

-   In **Weightless (Mass Effect)**, Shepard decided to push Garrus away because she thought if she let him love her, she would lose him to death. Her fear of ruining his life, combining with Nihlus and Kaidan's death beforehand also cemented this decision of hers.
-   Notably averted in **Worth of a Soul** when Prince Vince tells Beetlejuice that he should break up with Lydia since he's always getting her into trouble, not to mention almost getting her killed as an indirect consequence of his actions during a recent altercation. To put it simply, she's just too good for him, and if he really loves her he should let her go and allow her to move on to bigger and better things. Beetlejuice responds that he **knows** she's too good for him, and that's why he'll never stop pursuing her.
    
    **Beetlejuice**: Look, I don't know the way you read it in those sappy romance books, kid... But someone's too good for you, and loves your ass anyway? You **don't** fucking let them go.

But when his daughter reveals she's fallen in love with a human, Triton flies into a rage and uses his trident to violently destroy Ariel's collection, believing it is the only way to keep her safe from humans. The crushed look on his face after he finishes the deed shows he isn't too happy with what he's done, but nonetheless believes it is for the best, until Ariel swims away from home, much to Triton's utter despair.

Upon seeing Vanellope's picture on the side of the **Sugar Rush** cabinet, however, Ralph realizes that breaking her heart was a big mistake and, via interrogation, discovers that King Candy was lying.
-   In **Wolfwalkers**, a more platonic example occurs. Robyn is told by Mebh's mother Moll that Mebh and the other wolves must leave her behind and leave the forest before it's destroyed. When Mebh goes into town to find Robyn herself, Robyn confronts Mebh telling her she must leave with the wolves, discouraging Mebh from searching for her mother and leaving her feeling betrayed. Later, when the townsfolk gather to watch Moll being humiliated, Mebh tries to stop them and Robyn, who was told by Moll to keep her daughter safe, tells the wolf-hating kids Mebh is a wolf and has them trap her in a cage so she doesn't get on stage. Robyn explains to Mebh that her mother told her to keep Mebh safe, which understandably further upsets Mebh as her new best friend was lying to her the whole time.

This turns out to be what convinces Eleanor to approve of their relationship, as Eleanor believes that Americans are too self-centered for the more family-oriented Chinese culture in East Asia but Rachel's willingness to sacrifice her own happiness to preserve Nick's tells her otherwise.

Guy completely misunderstands and makes matters even worse.

-   This trope shows up a number of times throughout J.R.Ward's **Black Dagger Brotherhood** series. Example: Rehvenge revealing his life as a coldblooded drug-dealer/pimp to his Love Interest Ehlena in order to drive her away so she wouldn't find out he's half **sympath** and, worse still, marked for torture and certain death. Thankfully, she saw through the act eventually and helped to save him.
    -   Another example occurs in **Lover Enshrined**, wherein Qhuinn is basically marked for death after cutting open his cousin, Lash's, throat so he plans to go underground. On the way he's caught by his best friend Blay, who says he'll never abandon Qhuinn. Qhuinn resorts to outing his buddy and confronting Blay about watching him, making it sound as though he's disgusted by his friend.

Louisa also thinks of Dee as a friend, but is worried that it isn't healthy for Dee to spend all her time hanging out with a dead girl. Eventually, Louisa tells Dee that as a ghost, she wants to enjoy her special powers rather than be friends with a worthless mortal and disappears, hoping that this will force Dee to make some mortal friends and move on with her life.

-   In **The Last Human Getaway** innkeeper Yves breaks off his relationship with protagonist Annie and tells her to leave the glen and never return. It's because he fears the villain has terrible plans for her and he doesn't want to see her hurt.

-   In the **Malazan Book of the Fallen** Apsalar tries this to keep Cutter from following her further down the road of becoming a murderer for hire and possibly getting himself killed in the process.

-   **A Prayer for Owen Meany**: Anticipating his death, Owen does this to Hester towards the end of his life. Unfortunately, after his death, Hester's life spirals into wild abandon.

-   Alix does this twice in the first two books of the **Samuel Carver** series, first in **The Accident Man** and then in **The Survivor**. She genuinely loves Carver, but keeps winding up in situations where she needs to pretend otherwise to save his life, and she's too good of an actress.
-   **The Shadowhunter Chronicles**:
    -   In **City of Glass**, Jace Herondale deliberately picks a fight with Clary Fairchild so she will go back home.

-   **The Summer I Turned Pretty**: In the third book, it is revealed that the reason Conrad has been treating Belly like crap all this time is because he thought of **himself** as a screwed up asshole, and deliberately wanted Belly to stop pursuing him so she would not fall down with him. In reality, Belly is the only girl Conrad genuinely loves (and that's including the fact that he had dated other girls before, meaning he didn't see them as serious relationships), but chose to let her go because he thought she would be happier without him. However, when Belly seems to have taken this hint **too** well and is ready to marry another man, Conrad slowly breaks down until he practically begs her not to marry anyone else, because he still wants her.

-   Toyed with in **The Truth-teller's Tale**. In order to save Roelyn, both the twins say things they know will stay her father's hand, but break their friend's heart. Eleda, who cannot lie, says Roelyn will marry, not the man she loves, but the Prince. Adele, the secret keeper, reveals that she saw the love interest secretly wed the previous day. It works, and Roelyn's father frees his daughter... Only to reveal that Roelyn was the one wed to the love interest, and that the love interest was keeping his identity as prince a secret.
-   **The Twilight Saga**:
    -   Edward attempts this in **New Moon**, because he feels that he's put Bella in too much danger. Bella responds by having a Heroic BSoD **for four months**.
    -   Bella also does this to her father to some extent, shouting at him and basically calling him a loser in every way. She does it so she can justify her flight from the "evil" vampires in order to protect him (by leading the vampires as far away from him as possible). To twist the knife further, she uses the same words her mother used when she left him — leaving him stunned, staring, and unable to chase after her, just like she wanted. Then, as soon as she's out of sight, she bursts into tears.
-   In Robert Jordan's **The Wheel of Time** series, the protagonist Rand al'Thor tries to pull a platonic version of this with his friends Mat, Perrin, and Loial, to get them to leave so they will be safe should the Red Ajah or the Dark One come hunting him (or he just plain goes crazy from channeling the tainted male half of the One Power). It doesn't work (and in fact his ex-girlfiend Egwene completely calls him on it), but the end result is Mat resenting him and wanting nothing to do with him for at least half the series, a bad development when Rand really ends up needing him later.
-   In the **Wild Cards** books, Tom Tudbury, The Great and Powerful Turtle's Secret Identity, had a girlfriend that he loved a lot. But she had a dormant form of the wild card virus, meaning that any children they had would get **at best** a one-in-ten shot at survival (since he, unbeknownst to her, had the virus). He knew that she really wanted kids, so he manufactured a big fight that led to them breaking up but remaining friends so that she could find happiness with someone else (even though it was **killing** him to do so). Tom holds the Idiot Ball and never asks if adopting children would work for her.

Break His Heart to Save Him Example in Live-Action TV

-   **30 Rock**: Parodied, when Jack does this to Frank to prevent him from becoming a lawyer (and subsequently killed by the Mafia). Notable for being a direct reference to **Harry and the Hendersons**.
-   **Altered Carbon**. Takeshi Kovacs is reunited with his long-lost sister, only to find she's now a ruthless crime boss who won't tolerate any rivals for her brother's affection. She also makes it clear that she'll have Kristin Ortega, her brother's current Love Interest, tortured until she goes insane if Takeshi doesn't go along with her Evil Plan. When Kristin turns up searching for Takeshi, The Dragon makes it clear that he's to get rid of her or he'll start killing people on the spot. So Takeshi has to respond coldly in the face of her relief that he's alive, accusing her of only being glad that his body is intact (he's wearing the sleeve of her former boyfriend) and claiming their relationship meant nothing to him. Ortega doesn't fall for it, but is visibly hurt.
-   **Angel**
    -   In "Double or Nothing", Gunn is doomed to a fate that will destroy his relationship with Fred, so he dumps her as cruelly as he can. She quickly runs crying to Angel—not because of what he said, but because she knew what he's doing and realizes that he's in real trouble. Fred later makes him apologize for handling the problem that way.
    -   Also, when Angel fired Wesley, Gunn and Cordelia in the episode "Reunion". He had been getting darker, especially when he let Drusilla and the re-sired Darla massacre the Wolfram & Hart lawyers for turning Darla back into a vampire and destroying his chance of redeeming her. This did not sit well with Wes, Gunn and Cordy, who insisted on watching him so he doesn't do anything that horrible (or worse) again.
-   **Arrested Development**: Parodied in an episode with GOB driving away George Michael for similar reasons, and again in Rita's first appearance, where Michael utterly misinterprets her statement "I'll make you blue."
-   **Arrow**
    -   In the pilot episode, Oliver Queen gets "The Reason You Suck" Speech from Laurel Lance for cheating on her with Laurel's sister Sara and getting her killed. Laurel later tries to apologize but Oliver curtly brushes her off, telling her he's the same self-centered hedonist he was before. This is partly to drive her away so he can carry out his vigilante crusade, and partly because he no longer thinks he deserves Laurel after what he did. He realises he might have overdone his Jerkass Façade however, and apologises in the next episode.
    -   In Season 2 Oliver convinces Roy Harper to break up with his sister Thea, because he might endanger her with his Super Serum\-induced rages. Roy lets Thea catch him with another girl; Thea knows full well what he's doing but is still distraught because Roy refuses to tell her why he's breaking up. This backfires badly because not only is Roy not there to protect Thea when Slade Wilson kidnaps her that very night, it's also one of several trust violations that eventually drive Thea away from both Oliver and Roy.
    -   Invoked at the start of Season 3, when Oliver breaks up with Felicity Smoak, who begs him to say he never loved her so she won't be tormented by the hope that they might get together again. Oliver responds with a "Shut Up" Kiss. "Don't ask me to say that I don't love you."
-   **The Beauty Queen Of Jerusalem**: Ephraim and Victoria call off the wedding after he cheats on her. He later explains that he's joined the Irgun, and might be killed fighting the Arabs or the British. Given her first husband died, he doesn't want to put her through that again. Of course, he could just be making this all up as justification after the fact.
-   **Being Human (UK)**: In the third series finale, Mitchell insults George and tells him their friendship was simply emotional manipulation to try and convince George to kill him. George figures out what he's doing and tells him as much.
    -   Later, Tom tries to do it to Allie, telling her that he actually hates her and thinks that she's annoying. Given that he all but breaks down crying while saying this, no one is fooled. Allie still leaves though, because she knows that he's trying to save her from being made a worse person by his influence.
-   **Better Call Saul**: In the season 4 finale, Werner tries to convince his wife on the telephone to fly back to Germany so that she will be safe from Gus, making up a story that he had to leave New Mexico for work.

In the sequel series, **Girl Meets World**, T.J. Murphy, a political activist who helps Eric run against a corrupt senator and founder of a website called **Thorn in Your Side**, turned out to be Tommy and said that it was the best thing Eric did and the family that took him in was a good one.

After he has a falling out with Mallory for keeping the team Locked Out of the Loop about a potential method of killing Homelander, she gives him a "The Reason You Suck" Speech about his Destructive Savior tendencies and tells him he's just like his father. Butcher storms out and when Ryan tries to stop him he tells him that he doesn't want to look at him for his Accidental Murder of his mother and Butcher's wife, prompting Ryan to tell Butcher he hates him and run off. This backfires horribly as it just ends up driving Ryan back into Homelander's arms.
-   In the third-to-last episode of **Breaking Bad**, **the** Wham Episode of the series, Walt does this with Skyler, pretending in his phone call to be a psychotic abuser who terrorized her into complicity with his crimes, so she would not get ostracized by the remaining family, and that the police and DEA would (hopefully) not treat her as harshly. He's playing it up hard, crying as he delivers the more evil lines, and you can see when she realizes what he's doing.
-   **Buffy the Vampire Slayer**: Angel does this, though, interestingly enough, he is more concerned about the long-term implications of their relationship, rather than the immediate danger they face on a daily basis.
    -   Likewise, Giles in Season 6 (in a platonic love version of this trope) leaves Buffy to force her to become independent.
-   **Castle**: In the Season 8 opener, Beckett becomes very secretive towards Castle, and eventually leaves him, not really saying why (it's because she has a super powerful enemy that could kill both of them, and she needs to take them down alone). Naturally, Castle being Castle, this just makes him redouble his efforts to "save his marriage".
-   **Chinese Paladin**: Ling'er, motivated by a mix of a sense of duty and Leaving You to Find Myself, does this to Xiaoyao. He eventually gets the point and agrees to let her go.
-   **Chuck**: Jill was forced to break up with Chuck when she was recruited into Fulcrum.
-   **Cold Case**: Seen in the episode "Sandhogs". The victim of the week was an avid union activist, but this had made him very unpopular. When his opponents began to make threats against his girlfriend, he abruptly told her he was going to reconcile with his wife and that their racial difference (he was white, she was black) would have doomed the relationship anyway. The woman spent DECADES believing that he had never loved her and was using her, taking comfort only in the existence of the son conceived during the affair until the detectives told her the real reason he had pushed her away.
-   The **Decoy** episode "Night Light" contains a parental example, where a jewel thief rejects his thirteen-year-old son to prevent him from following his footsteps.
-   **Doctor Who**:
    -   The Fourth Doctor does this to Sarah in "The Ark in Space", when she is stuck in a pipe and panicking. He pretends to give her a "The Reason You Suck" Speech, in order to make her angry enough to push her way out of the pipe.
        
        **The Doctor:** "Oh, Doctor." Is that all you can say for yourself? Stupid, foolish girl. We should never have relied on you. I knew you'd let us down. That's the trouble with girls like you. You think you're tough, but when you're really up against it, you've no guts at all. Hundreds of lives at stake and you lie there, blubbing.  
        **Sarah:** You wait till I get out! I can manage. I don't need your help, thank you!  
        **The Doctor:** Yes you do, yes you do. **\[Sarah is fully out\]** Splendid. You've done marvellously, Sarah. I'm very proud of you. I really am very proud of you.  
        **Sarah:** Conned again. You're a brute!  
        **The Doctor:** Oh, don't be ungrateful. I was only encouraging you. Come on.
        
    -   The Seventh Doctor does this with Ace in "The Curse of Fenric". He specifically needs to break her faith in him in order to save the world, so he convinces her that her life means nothing to him and he only traveled with her as part of a bigger plan.
    -   "The Parting of the Ways": The Ninth has a Shoo the Dog moment with Rose, faking an "eureka" moment so he can get her into the TARDIS and send her home while he stays to face a Dalek army, fully expecting to die.
    -   "The God Complex": The Eleventh Doctor does it to Amy Pond, for almost exactly the same reasons as Seven to Ace.
        
        "I can't save you from this. There's nothing I can do to stop it... I've stolen your childhood and now I've led you by the hand to your death. But the worst thing is, I knew. I knew this would happen; this is what always happens. Forget your faith in me. I took you with me because I was vain. Because I wanted to be adored — I'm not a hero. I really am just a mad man in a box. And it's time we saw each other as we really are."
        
    -   Amy tried doing this to Rory immediately prior to "Asylum of the Daleks", booting him out of their home, moving forward with divorce proceedings, and generally acting caustic and unfeeling toward him in the mistaken belief that he would be happier without her. She knew he wanted to be a father and, due to injuries sustained during the events of "A Good Man Goes to War", she could no longer have children.
    -   The Eleventh Doctor does this to Clara Oswald in "The Time of the Doctor", repeating the same gambit the Ninth Doctor did with Rose — tricking her into entering the TARDIS and sending her home and out of harm's way. She is heartbroken as a result, but fortunately an ally of the Doctor's is able to reunite them.
    -   The Twelfth Doctor's plan to erase Clara's memory of himself in "Hell Bent" is a misguided example. He knows it'll break her heart, but he plans to do it whether she wants it or not. Fortunately, she is able to talk sense into him. Sadly, her heart still ends up breaking when the Doctor loses his memories of her instead.
    -   "It Takes You Away" puts a twist on the trope: When just the Doctor and Erik remain in the Solitract's universe, the Doctor entices it to pick her because of her far greater range of experiences compared to him, noting that it can only keep one of them. When the Solitract chooses her, Erik is finally convinced that it's not really his dead wife, which it had taken the form of, and is ejected.

-   **Farscape**: A staged version. Crichton blows Aeryn off and then asks Pilot to check the comm system, which will take them offline for a minute or so. He then explains that Scorpius is eavesdropping using the comms, and if they rekindle their relationship, Scorpius will use both Aeryn and the baby she's carrying as leverage. Aeryn dismisses him as paranoid until Scorpius is heard asking about the comms. They then continue what sounds like a breakup and end it by kissing. Unfortunately, the Scarrens kidnap Aeryn two episodes later, forcing Crichton to offer Scorpius wormhole tech in return for his assistance in rescuing her, making the whole thing completely pointless.
-   **Forever (2014)** has a Break Her Heart to Save Her. Dr. Henry Morgan makes this choice in "The Last Death of Henry Morgan" trying to protect Detective Jo Martinez. Even though she might hate him for it, Henry believes he has no choice but to break Jo's trust and steal the **pugio** Adam was first killed with from Evidence because if he doesn't, Adam may go through her to get it, and Henry's seen the remains of multiple people Adam has tortured to death in pursuit of it. Whatever his feelings for Jo, he can't put her at risk by letting her get involved in dealing with Adam.
-   **Game of Thrones**. Tyrion lies to his mistress Shae in "The Lion and the Rose", saying he never loved her, and delivers an absolutely brutal diatribe against her to drive her off to Pentos before his father Lord Tywin has her hanged. It seriously backfires when a bitter Shae turns up as the Surprise Witness at Tyrion's regicide trial, perjuring herself to get Tyrion convicted. To cap off this Humiliation Conga, Tryion later finds Shae in his father's bed and strangles her.
-   **General Hospital**: Emily tells boyfriend Zander that she's engaged to someone else to spare him the pain of watching her suffer from cancer—and she ends up falling in love with the other guy anyway.
-   **Guiding Light**: Similarly, wanting to protect boyfriend Jesse from the mobsters who are after her, Michelle tells him she's going to marry someone else. Sure enough, by the time she admits the truth to him, he's moved on, and so has she.
-   **Haven**: Nathan and Audrey are on the brink of a Relationship Upgrade when Audrey finds out she's going to disappear in six weeks. Her way of dealing with this is to immediately put on the brakes and start pushing him away, but without really explaining herself, leading to a season-long estrangement that hurts him anyway. Eventually, she realizes it's not working and they're a better team together than separate and ends up apologizing... right before being kidnapped by the Bolt Gun Killer and ultimately being forced into the Barn to end the Troubles.
-   **House of Cards (US)**: In 2x12, Posner makes Lisa go away to eliminate any threats towards her from a constantly opinion shifting Stamper.
-   **In the Dark**: In "The Trial of Murphy Mason, Part Two" Murphy tells Max that she doesn't really love him or want to stay with him, as she's going to become a police informant so her case is dropped, something that will endanger not only her but also her loved ones.
-   Subverted in **Jessie**. Jessie considers doing this to Brooks when Mrs. Chesterfield cut off all of his money and rendered him broke to force them to break up. Fortunetly, just when she was about to go through with it, Mrs. Chesterfield changes her mind after a talk with Bertram and gives Brooks his money and job back finally accepting their relationship.
-   **The Last Man on Earth**: Phil's brother gives him a "The Reason You Suck" Speech while apparently dying of the apocolyptic virus so that Phil won't stick around to watch him die. It doesn't work, so he makes it his "dying wish" for Phil to leave.
-   **Lost**: Pierre Chang does this to his wife, because pretending to turn into a total asshole to drive her away from the island is the only way to persuade her to leave in time before everyone's lives become endangered by The Incident.
-   Deconstructed and eventually averted in **Mahou Sentai Magiranger**. After having a premonition of his upcoming death, Hikaru attempts to abruptly cut the Ozu family off, hoping to not leave behind any memories or attachments that could hurt anyone, but it's immediately obvious to both the audience and everyone in-universe that there's no way in hell they could just forget him after all he'd done for them. On top of that, Urara's fallen in love with him, and the feeling is mutual, but he continues to convince himself that cutting it off is for the best. He's conflicted about it until a pep talk from Miyuki gets him to realize that doing this will only inflict more emotional pain than the alternative, so he goes ahead and proposes to Urara, acknowledging that pushing her away was no better than following assumptions in his head and belittling her by assuming she wouldn't be strong enough to handle it.
-   **Merlin**: (in a way) In 2x09, Freya tries to leave Camelot without telling Merlin so that he won´t leave the good life he has there, and to prevent him from finding out she´s a Bastet.
-   **Motherland: Fort Salem**: Enlisted witches are forbidden from consorting with civilian men, so the first episode sees Abigail dumping her boyfriend and using magic to make sure he forgets about her.
-   **NCIS**: DiNozzo wooed Jeanne Benoit as part of a black ops plan to get at her arms-dealer father. After his cover was blown and Jeanne confronted him, he claimed that the relationship was entirely fake...even though he had really fallen in love with her.
-   **Novoland: Eagle Flag**: Ji Ye tells Yu Ran he never cared for her and to leave him alone, because he's now a prisoner who expects to be executed for treason and she'll be in trouble if she talks to him too much.
-   **Once Upon a Time**: Snow White has to do this to Prince Charming so he will continue with the Arranged Marriage to prevent his father from killing him.
    -   Grumpy also does this to his fairy girlfriend Nova so that she can have a better future.
-   The tearful Heartfelt Apology of his teacher **Obi-Wan Kenobi** after of their second battle for ruining his life **visibly** broke what was left of Darth Vader's blackened heart. To help save him from living in pain for his **own** mistakes, the Dark Warrior forced a pained, monstrous smile through the crack Ben cut in his helmet and took **full** responsibilty for the downfall of Anakin Skywalker; thus absolving his friend's guilt and accepting his apology the only way his pride would allow him to.
-   **One Life to Live**: Sloan abruptly tells Vicky that he's going to marry his childhood sweetheart Beverley, when in truth, he's just learned that his Hodgkin's lymphoma is terminal. It doesn't work of course—Vicky's just as devastated by his inexplicably dumping her and refuses to let the matter rest until he finally admits the truth.
-   **Penny Dreadful**: Ethan does this to Vanessa at the end of season two, believing that his lycanthropy and murderous past has doomed him, and wanting to spare Vanessa the agony of seeing him hanged. Of course, he doesn't actually tell her any of this, and instead of being hanged, he is extradited back to America, leaving Vanessa believing that he abandoned her.
-   **The Princess Wei Young** has a variant. Xin Er pretends she doesn't care about Tuoba Jun to save the Li family, because if the "witchcraft" incident was revealed it would mean the entire family's execution.
-   **Roswell**: Liz does this to Max twice. Once in "Destiny" after hearing that being with Tess was his destiny and again in the "End of the World" after being asked to by time-traveling future Max.
-   Invoked in **Saved by the Bell**: after finding out that Slater's dad may be transferring to Hawaii, Zack - looking to eliminate his competition for Kelly - tells Kelly, Jessie and Lisa that Slater is terminally ill and can only be treated at a clinic in Hawaii, so they need to be mean to him and convince him that he has no reason to stay at Bayside. It seems to work, until Kelly suddenly declares that she will also go to Hawaii to nurse Slater, leading him to figure out what's really going on.
-   **Sherlock**: In "The Reichenbach Fall", Sherlock tells John that his entire life was a lie, that he made up Moriarty to look clever, that he researched John before their meeting to impress him, before faking his suicide so that John, Mrs Hudson and Lestrade won't get shot by snipers. John doesn't believe a word of it, of course.
    -   Sherlock's earlier attempt to do this was, sadly, a lot more successful. John receives a phone-call telling him that Mrs. Hudson has been shot. Sherlock refuses to go with him to see her and acts as if he doesn't care about her when previous events have clearly shown otherwise. Throughout the episode, people have been slowly turning against Sherlock, all except John, who has been fighting in his corner all the way until this moment, which causes him to snap and call Sherlock a "machine" before abandoning him as well. It turns out Mrs Hudson was fine all along and the whole thing was a ruse set up by Sherlock to get John to leave him so he could face Moriarty alone.

-   In **Star Trek: Discovery**, in a platonic variation, Michael Burnham left Sarek's home in an attempt to keep her foster brother Spock from being targeted by Vulcan logic extremists for associating with a human. When young Spock tried to follow her, Burnham, in desperation, told him she never cared about him and called him a "half-breed". They didn't speak for years. When they finally reconnect in Season 2, Spock is bitter and treats her with hostility. He also calls her selfish for constantly trying to shoulder the responsibility for everything. He explains that the logic extremists would have targeted him anyway because he's half-human.
    -   Incidentally, Spock himself did this to an old flame named Leila in **The Original Series**. In the episode "This Side of Paradise" Leila is being controlled by drug-like spores. The spores are killed by emotional extremes, <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> so when he tells her he can't be with her anymore, her abject grief snaps her back to normal.
-   **Supernatural**:
    -   In Season 8 Castiel does this to Dean in Purgatory, running away so that the Leviathan after him will only target Cas himself at the cost of risking Dean will think he's in distress or has outright chickened out and abandoned him.
    -   He then does it **again** in the same season, letting Dean believe they'll get out of Purgatory together only to stay at the last possible moment, because he knows if he tells Dean he doesn't intend to come along, Dean will refuse to get out until he comes around. This particular stunt does its job of getting Dean to safety and back on Earth, but it screws Dean up so much, his brain fabricates fake memories to rationalize the event as himself failing to save Cas, or Cas giving up and his grip slipping.
    -   Towards the end of Season 15 he does it **again** in an unusual way in "Despair". When Billie is on the warpath about to kill both him and Dean, he tells Dean the Empty will take him away at his happiest moment, and that comes with him admitting to his love for Dean, which causes the Empty to appear and take both him and Billie away, leaving Dean a shocked and sobbing mess alone on the floor, although he is said to have been revived offscreen later.
-   **The Twilight Zone (1959)**: In the episode "The Trouble With Templeton", the title character's obsession with his dead wife propels him back to a speakeasy in the 1920's when they were first in love. However, her shrewish, callous treatment of him there forces him to flee back to his present time. After he's gone back, his wife drops the act and breaks down in tears; it was all to make him let go of his obsession with her memory and continue to live his life. He figures it out, too, when he finds her acting script in his hand, back in the present day.
-   **The Vampire Diaries**: Stefan occasionally does this to Elena throughout the series. Stefan breaks up with Elena or turns his back on her in order to protect Elena. This is especially evident in season three when Stefan leaves Mystic Falls with Klaus and becomes a Ripper in order to protect Elena and the rest of the town. Elena also did this with Stefan in season two by breaking up with Stefan in order to protect Stefan and her family and friends from Katherine Pierce.
-   **Without a Trace**: After taking a boy hostage because the kid reminded him of his dead son, a man finally agrees to let him go. However, the boy refuses to leave, so the man begins screaming at him, telling him he's a "brat" and "I was just using you". The kid **still** refuses to leave, being savvy enough, even at his young age, to guess what the man's trying to do and that he's planning to kill himself once the boy leaves.
-   **Wonderfalls**: Jaye basically treats Eric like crap and breaks up with him because the animals told her to and she thinks there will be grave consequences if she doesn't.

Break His Heart to Save Him Example in Music

-   "The Hardest Thing" is a 98 Degrees song about a guy who has to break up with a girl because he's already made a commitment to another girl.
-   "Hate Me", by Blue October, is from the viewpoint of an alcoholic/drug addict singing to his mother.
    
    An ounce of peace is all I want for you, will you never call again?  
    **(...)**  
    So I'll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind.  
    And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind.  
    Hate me today. Hate me tomorrow.  
    Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you.
    
-   "Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home)" by Marvin Gaye (later covered by Paul Young) plays with this trope; the song is about a guy essentially telling a girl that he's a philandering jerk and that the best thing she can do is just walk away from him and forget all about him. However, where Gaye's version is more upbeat in tempo and style, as if the guy's tone is casually along the lines of "hey, baby, that's just the way I roll", Young's version is a lot more melancholy, as if the guy has actually fallen deeply in love with the girl but is trying to push her away because he ultimately knows he's no good for her.

Break His Heart to Save Him Example in Theatre

-   In **La Bohème** by Puccini, Rodolfo leaves a distraught Mimì, ostensibly because she flirts with other men and he is jealous, but the true reason is that Mimì is suffering from lung disease and Rodolfo is too poor to afford medication or even firewood, so he sets her free, hoping that she will fall into more capable hands.

Break His Heart to Save Him Example in Video Games

-   Viconia tries this in **Baldur's Gate II** several times, at least once citing her enemies as an excuse. The other times it seems to just be her Tsundere tendencies.
-   Deconstructed in **Detention** when Mr. Chang breaks up with Ray. He's secretly helping out with an illegal book club, and his fellow leader Ms. Yin convinces him to break up with Ray so that her life isn't in danger if they get caught. However, Ray overhears the conversation and misunderstands it as Ms. Yin and Mr. Chang being in a relationship, and is so overcome with jealousy that she rats out the book club herself, planning on the government removing Ms. Yin from the equation. It backfires horribly; Ms. Yin has enough connections to flee the country with her life, but eventually dies in exile, while Mr. Chang is arrested and executed.
-   **Disco Elysium** has a platonic example, if you're willing to dig. The Wild Pines Corporation usually had a stand-by negotiator for talking with the Dockworkers' Union, who was unusually sympathetic to the workers and favoured by the heads of the union. The current strike, however, is not meant to be a reasonable negotiation — the heads of the Union are intentionally provoking a shit-show so they can seize the dock itself and run it as a co-op. In order to prevent the reasonable negotiator from being remembered as "that guy whose softness cost us the dock", Evrart **intentionally** pre-empted him from the negotiation by insulting him and referring to him as a midget and forcing Joyce — someone the Union has no respect for whatsoever — to step in instead.
-   **Dragon Age**:
    -   Morrigan of **Dragon Age: Origins** tries to drive away a Warden who completes her romance path, partly out of fear of such unfamiliar feelings and partly because a real relationship complicates her own plans. At one point she flat out begs him to say he doesn't love her. The **Witch Hunt** DLC is based on Morrigan having ghosted the rest of the party after the events of **Origins**, and if the Warden and Morrigan were in a romance their meeting during the DLC will be heavily flavoured by this trope (if they were friends, colleagues or in an Enemy Mine situation in **Origins**, the meeting is slightly different).
    -   In between **Dragon Age II** and **Dragon Age: Inquisition**, Hawke did this to his/her love interest, despite going on the run together. S/he knew that said love interest would give their life to protect him/her (noting Fenris in particular), something s/he wasn't going to give them the chance to do. If Hawke is in a relationship with Anders, there is the additional concern that the Big Bad has already taken over Anders's mind once before, and they need to prevent that from happening again. If Hawke survives, the separation is temporary.
    -   In **Dragon Age: Inquisition**, Solas does this to a romanced female elf. Unable to reveal his true identity, he breaks up with her instead. Then in Trespasser he returns, still very much in love with Lavellan, but refuses to let her join him and 'see what he becomes' if she asks to leave with him after he reveals his plans to remove the Veil, breaking her heart for a second time.
-   In **Elden Ring**, Melina, the player's closest ally, sacrifices herself by burning near the end of the game **unless** an extremely convoluted series of steps have been taken to obtain the Frenzied Flame, initiating the process to bring about The End of the World as We Know It, in which case she disowns and abandons the player instead. Proceeding from here will normally lead to a Bad Ending, **unless** **another** ridiculously complex method is used to destroy the Frenzied Flame **after** using it to avert Melina's sacrifice, allowing a regular/good ending to be achieved. However, the game never acknowledges this in regards to Melina, who is not seen reacting to the player's unexpected redemption even though she **is** seen reacting to the apocalypse in the bad ending (provided she's still alive, as it's possible to allow her to sacrifice herself, then go get the Frenzied Flame and bring about the apocalypse anyway).
-   **Inazuma Eleven**: Mahoro started avoiding Amagi after he started getting bullied for standing up to his friend when he was bullied because he didn't want to drag him into his mess. Years later, they eventually make amends.
-   A non-romantic example occurred in **Insanity**. Yanase told Toshiko she was being relieved of her position and let her believe it was because she was too old, in order to spare her from the same fate as Takahashi who was murdered by their master Shigeki after he went insane.
-   In **Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories**, Belle is held captive by Maleficent, who's hoping on stealing Belle's heart. Belle coldly pushes the Beast away and denies she needs rescuing in order to keep Maleficent from stealing her heart, but he refuses, giving a speech about how much she changed him and refusing to abandon her, even if she hates him. Maleficent then decides to steal his heart, and Belle pulls a Heroic Sacrifice to save Beast. During the final confrontation, it's revealed that Maleficent was **also** after Beast's heart, and she tells the truth about Belle in order to remove the Beast's doubts and take advantage of his love for Belle. After Maleficent is defeated and Belle is restored, Belle apologizes to Beast.
    
    **Belle**: Please forgive me. I had to be cruel to you. But no matter how I tried, I couldn't hide my true feelings.
    
-   An odd example Played for Laughs in **Kraken Academy!!**, Broccoli Girl had to break up with her ex,Dimitri, after she was cursed and turned into a living peice of broccoli. It just so happens, Dimitri is allergic to broccoli, so being together would have literally killed him.
-   **Metal Gear**:
    -   Done rather well in the end of **Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots**. Rose told Raiden that their child had died before birth and pretended to have married Roy Campbell, so the Patriots could not use her and the child as leverage against him. Being somewhat unstable before, he didn't take it well at all, but he's very quick to forgive her when she explains her motives and he meets his son for the first time.
    -   Done again in **Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes**, where Paz acts cold and distant and then repeatedly insults Chico while he is being forced to torture her, so as to make Skull Face think that she hates Chico and he is therefore of no use in trying to make her talk. She only reveals the truth to Chico in a recording she left him while he slept, telling him that she meant none of it and was actually really happy that he had come to rescue her; that he has given her hope of survival and that she is grateful to him. One day before her death.
-   A meek variation can happen in **Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer**. If you romanced Gann, were unable to completely get rid of the curse and chose to remain in the City of Justice for all eternity as a vessel for the Spirit Eater, Gann chooses to stay with you. You can try to convince him not to by lying that you don't want him there, but when he realizes you're trying to deceive him for his own good he only becomes even more determined to stay with you.
-   At the end of **Persona 5**, Joker must turn himself into the police in order to make absolutely sure that Masayoshi Shido is convicted of his numerous crimes and can't come after the Thieves. That night, Joker and his Love Interest (whoever that may be) spend the night together. Joker's girlfriend picks up that something's wrong (particularly if she's one of the female Thieves), but there's no option to tell her what's going on so she won't try and stop him.
-   **Rhythm Thief & the Emperor's Treasure** has a non-romantic version with Duchess Elizabeth coldly rejecting her daughter Marie to keep her safe from the conspiracy she's part of. They clear things up in the climax, when Marie ends up falling into the villains' hands anyway.
-   In **Sonic Rush Adventure**, Blaze does this to Marine so that she won't get hurt by the pirates, even if she had to call her a nuisance, she is later shown regretting saying that to her, but Marine won't take no for an answer.
-   You have the choice to do this to your personal ghoul, Heather, in **Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines**. She is head-over-heels for you after you use your blood to save her life, and anytime after she moves in with you, you have the opportunity to either keep her around for money and blood, or kick her out. She'll tearfully cry and beg to stay if you go for the latter option, but it's the only way to free her from a life of servitude. If you keep her until the end, she is eventually killed by the Sabbat. Thankfully, the Unofficial Patch allows you to avoid this fate by ordering her to stay indoors as the streets become more dangerous.
-   In **Wadanohara**, Samekichi is forced to do this for Wadnohara herself to prevent her from regaining her memories from a curse which could break her mind, and to prevent the Dead Sea from manipulating her.

Break His Heart to Save Him Example in Visual Novels

-   In the second **Fragment's Note**, Kyoichi tries to call out Yukitsuki for snooping into his life after she asks about his diagnosis after a hospital visit, since he doesn't want to hurt her by telling her about his terminal illness. Yukitsuki is so shocked by his shouting that she doesn't notice that it's not sincere, despite the fact that she's usually able to perceive peoples' emotions really fast. Afterwards, Kyoichi ends up seriously regretting it.
-   In **Ikemen Sengoku**, this happens on several routes. Regardless of the situation or character, it never works for very long.
    -   Yukimura's route: Yukimura breaks up with the main character after learning that they're working for opposing sides because he doesn't want her to get caught up in a war by getting involved with him. His Dramatic route also has the main character trying to enact this trope on him after she learns that he will die protecting her if she continues to stay in the past and decides she needs to return to her time to avoid this fate.
    -   Ieyasu's route: His Dramatic route has him try to make the main character hate him enough to return to her time because they're being besieged by their enemies and can't hold out much longer, and he fears that she'll die if she doesn't escape to her time.
    -   Shingen's route: Shingen sends away the main character despite having fallen in love with her because he's Secretly Dying of an illness and thinks she deserves a better life partner than a man who doesn't have long to live.
-   In **Mystic Messenger**, Seven does his absolute damnedest in his route to be cold and vicious towards you in order to make you stop loving him and leave, fearing that his job as a secret agent/hacker would only put you in danger, or he'd have to disappear one day and leave you abandoned.
