Chased Off into the Sunset: 
Same old, same old apparently.

_"Begin the end by chasing each other into the distance, then scream comically, followed by an Iris Out."_

So the story has ended. The villain has been defeated, the orphanage will stay open, the girl has been rescued, and everyone just sits back to relax and celebrate their victory — right?

Except, to close the story, a character ends up chasing after another character, usually out of anger. Normally, this trope is Played for Laughs as the chased offender may have insulted someone else, did something stupid or wrong, or maybe committed some offense earlier on in the story. The two (usually it's two characters) end up in a chase while the others may look on, sometimes with indifference or sometimes even in amusement. Bonus points if they're friends or teammates, and extra bonus points if the character being chased is the defeated villain (who apparently does _not_ Know When to Fold 'Em).

For this trope to apply, the chase has to happen at the end of the story. This could be the very end of a movie or TV show episode or just the end of an individual story in an anthology or a skit in a sketch comedy/variety show.

A type of Chase Scene and may overlap with Everyone Chasing You. If the chaser is an animal, it's Exit, Pursued by a Bear. Compare and contrast with Off-into-the-Distance Ending.

Chased Off into the Sunset Example in Anime & Manga

-   The final episode of **Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts** ends with an Escalating Chase that eventually drags in pretty much all the main characters. The principal glances out the window and notices that they're all just running in a circle.
-   In **Daily Lives of High School Boys**, in the strip **High School Boys and the New Term**, Yoshitake and his group attended school one day before the term actually starts because the teacher misinformed them. It ends up with the students chasing after the teacher.
-   **Doraemon**: Occurs in "A World Without Sound". In the final frame, Big G punches Noby while they run off into the distance.
-   The 2nd opening and ending of **The Familiar of Zero** ends with Saito being chased by Louise.
-   At the end of Episode 4 of the **Little Lulu** anime, after the Endurance Test is over and Tubby is awarded the medal for going the longest without any food, Tubby then figures out that someone else also walked the course besides himself, before pointing out that Lulu was the one who brought back the food that he hid the night before. Lulu then tells Tubby that she didn't want him to break the rules, which culminates in Tubby chasing after Lulu. Of course, earlier in the episode, when Tubby explains to Lulu about the food he hid all over the course the night before, Lulu was Obfuscating Stupidity to throw off Tubby's suspicions.
-   **Lupin III**: A number of movies and episodes end with Zenigata chasing the title character off to the next adventure.

-   The **Lamput** episode "Fracture" ends with the Docs chasing Lamput into the distance after he gets back into shape from breaking the one bone in his body.

Chased Off into the Sunset Example in Comic Books

-   An **Archie Comics** story had Jughead timing Archie for the latter's partaking in a track meet, where he is astonished to learn that he just broke the record for being the fastest there is. Come the day of the track meet, after Archie wins the race, Coach Kleats then reveals to Archie that Jughead's stopwatch is actually a lot slower than Archie, which angers Archie so much that he starts chasing Jughead at the end of the story.
-   This happens in virtually every last panel of every story in the Spanish comic series **Mortadelo y Filemón**, with the two bumbling secret agents typically being chased by their boss, his secretary, the agency's scientist, or a combination thereof because they (again) screwed up their case big time. Sometimes, Mortadelo will also use his superhuman camouflage skills to hide as a cactus, cow etc. with Filemon hiding "in" him, and their suspicious pursuers in the vicinity looking around for them. Sometimes, Filemon will be the one chasing Mortadelo instead.
-   **Disney Ducks Comic Universe**:
    -   Frequently pops up in the European Scrooge McDuck stories (see Never My Fault for more details). When one of Scrooge's plans to make more money fails, rather than accept responsibility, Scrooge blames Donald Duck. The story then ends with an angry Scrooge chasing after Donald, often carrying a big club or mace. Huey, Dewey, and Louie usually look on, sometimes with indifference but sometimes chortling with amusement.
    -   Depending on the story, Donald may have indeed caused the disaster for which Scrooge blames him. For example in the finale of **The Seven Wonders of the Ducks** (1990), Donald accidentally activates the Self-Destruct Mechanism of the Money Bin. In **Uncle Scrooge and the Hittite Chariot** (1982), Scrooge has managed to locate the titular chariot, which reportedly had mystical qualities, and assigns its transportation to Donald. Donald decides to remove and throw away some heavy and seemingly useless elements of its equipment, to make the chariot lighter and easier to transport. Much later the Ducks discover that the mystical qualities were solely due to the removed parts, which were by then destroyed. In both cases, the story ends with this trope.
    -   Huey, Dewey, and Louie were victims of this themselves, usually with Donald wielding a switch or other instrument of corporal punishment.
    -   In "Paperino e la card mania", Donald accidentally talks Scrooge into a business decision that ruins the market of telephone card collecting. In the final panel, Donald is chased by furious collectors and quips that, for once, it's not Scrooge chasing him.
-   One of the **Valhalla** comic albums ends this way. Earlier in the story, Loki lures a giant's horse away to make sure the giant can't complete a bet. He does this by disguising himself as a mare — and months later, comes back with a gift for Odin, the eight-legged steed Sleipnir. Loki runs into the stallion again at the end of the story and promptly flees for his life with the horse in pursuit.
    -   The very end of the comic also includes this. Loki believes himself to be the only one of the old gods to have survived Ragnarok, and takes the time to badmouth Thor and Heimdall **post-mortem**. Meanwhile, Röskva's visions have told her the gods have survived the fall of Asgard, and Thor and Heimdall decide to pop in on Loki just as he's done insulting them. The last we see of Loki he's chased off by a very localized lightning storm.

Jocelyne then asks "What off-road vehicle?", making Germain realize she's still suffering from amnesia and tries to hit her again with the frying pan. It ends with Jocelyne running away from Germain, while Carl, Maria, and Dominique are trying to stop him.
