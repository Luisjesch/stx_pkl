Arm Cannon: 
_"An arm cannon sounds great until you need to button your shirt."_

— _Atomic Robo_ points out the flaws in this type of equipment

A specific type of Artificial Limbs that's Exactly What It Says on the Tin: a ranged weapon integrated with a character's arm. Or their leg; we're pretty flexible here, although they'd have to be good at shooting while crouched, as you'd probably have to be on all fours or sitting to aim a leg-mounted weapon. And it doesn't have to be literally a cannon; a machine gun or multi-shot rifle or shotgun is also acceptable. Generally, his trope includes any ranged weapon or gun used in place of (or as) a prosthetic.

While impressive these weapons are far from practical for numerous reasons. First, the recoil from an actual cannon would tear the the rest of the limb off, potentially killing the operator. Second, any ranged weapon (machine gun, shotgun, rifle, handgun) will have some recoil; if it's attached to the person (as a prosthetic would be) the recoil would at least mess up their aim for additional shots, and probably spin them around. Third, any weapon large enough to to qualify as a cannon would be so much weight on one limb that it would be next to impossible to maintain balance or get a steady enough stance to aim it, much less use the arm in melee combat. Fourth, barring some sort of advanced cooling system, any gun like weapon will heat when fired, almost certainly injuring a user keeping the gun directly on their skin. Five, the placement of the gun would make loading ammo or maintenance awkward at best and severely limit the amount of ammo that could be carried. Sixth, triggering an arm weapon requires either mechanical design that may require the other arm or exotic technology to connect directly to the brain. Seventh, having a loaded gun on or replacing a limb is just begging for accidental discharges when doing mundane tasks, even just walking with it.

There are two general types. One is the complete replacement of a hand, or even an entire arm, with a gun. Realistically, these make very little sense, as getting an Artificial Limb would allow you to _hold_ a gun, and do other mundane tasks with the limb when you're not in combat. Arm Cannons that fully replace the limb are also prone to suffering Fake Arm Disarms, as they can be destroyed without gravely injuring the wielder. A specialized version is a robotic hand that _turns into a gun_. This version often overlaps with the Hand Blast trope.

The other, more mundane version, is simply a gun that's attached to the arm — generally with the hand still intact. This might also involve Artificial Limbs, but just as often uses a special harness or weaponised vambrace. Occasionally, the weapon may fit _over_ the forearm and hand, giving the appearance of the first kind. More discreet versions often overlap with Nothing Up My Sleeve. Aiming it is usually a simple matter of pointing in the general direction of whatever it is you want to shoot. Using your free arm to brace the cannon before firing is optional, partly because reducing weapon sway and/or recoil improves your accuracy, but mostly because it makes the resulting shot look more powerful (or at least more awesome).

Both kinds generally come with Bottomless Magazines, and are often fired by thought alone. Larger versions of both types are common on Humongous Mecha, which can be conveniently designed to carry them from the start.

At any case, some arm cannons look like trumpets by design.

For a weaponised arm that _isn't_ a gun, see Power Fist, Rocket Punch, and especially Blade Below the Shoulder (and sometimes Pile Bunker). Not to be confused with Hand Cannon. Or, for that matter, Armed with Canon. Compare Shoulder Cannon, Leg Cannon, and Hand Blast. Finger Firearms is a small subtrope.

Arm Cannon Example in Anime and Manga

-   In **After War Gundam X**, the Leopard Gundam has a damn huge gatling gun instead of a left arm. While its Mid-Season Upgrade, Leopard Gundam Destroy, has the second type of this trope, as a pair of slightly less huge gatlings mounted on both arms.
-   **Astro Boy** in the 2003 series. Before that, he had rocket hands, but rarely used them, as his weapon of choice was instead a pair of machine guns that popped out of his tush.
    -   Remake **Pluto** also has Gesicht, whose hands turn into cannons (one shoots non-lethal gas, the other shoots a powerful shell). Another robot, North Mk. II, cheats a little by having extra limbs devoted to his weapons.
-   The protagonists of **Ayakashi** and **Mushi-Uta** have organic arm cannons. For the former, he normally has a Power Fist, but in the finale, his arm mutated into a dragon cannon. For the latter, his Bond Creature attached to his gun, and as the influence from the merger spread, it mutated his arm and, near the end, most of his body.
-   Guts in **Berserk** has a Steampunk mechanical left hand with a gunpowder cannon under it, the original having been chiseled off with a broken sword by Guts himself after it was caught in a demon's jaws during the Eclipse. To work it, he has to flip the hand up and pull out a lever buried in the side of the cannon. The arm also has a repeating crossbow built into it, which he uses for killing human foes and torturing fallen demons.
-   In **Bleach**, Soi Fon's zanpakutou brings her under this trope for short periods of time. In shikai, her zanpakutou integrates with a finger on her right hand to turn her into the ultimate two-hit kill warrior. However, in bankai, her zanpakutou becomes a stinger missile launcher that is integrated with her entire right arm to turn her into the ultimate one-hit kill warrior.
-   The gun-swordsmen in **Brigadoon: Marin and Melan** have a gun at the end of one arm and a sword at the end of the other, hence the name. They also have a second set of odd-looking retractable arms, which have stubby hands that they use for holding things.
-   An early **City Hunter** villain had a machine gun replacing his right arm. After being defeated and mocked by Ryo, he grafted a cannon in his leg.
-   Kazuhiko, the main character of the CLAMP manga **Clover**, has a prosthetic arm that can transform into a weapon.
-   The cyborg Talos from **Crusher Joe** has a prosthetic arm with a built-in machine gun and a prosthetic hand that fits on the end, concealing the gun from enemies.
-   004/Albert Heidrich from **Cyborg 009** looks normal, but as part of his cyborgization process all his limbs were replaced and now contain variable quantities of armament. The most remarkable are his finger guns (take that literally) and the rocket-launcher in his knees. Not to mention, in older continuities, he actually has **a nuclear bomb stored in his stomach**. Which he's willing to use in a suicidal attack in The Movie. He lives to tell, though.
-   The Golem girl of **Deadline Summoner** has a cannon built into her massive robot hands.
-   **D.Gray-Man**: Allen Walker can turn his (non-artificial) left arm into a cannon that shoots a sort of paling projectile.
-   **Digimon**:
    -   RizeGreymon in **Digimon Data Squad** had a huge revolver arm transformed from his Rookie form's wrist straps.
    -   Omnimon has an arm cannon too, naturally from the MetalGarurumon side of him. It's utilized for his attack/technique called Supreme Cannon (known as **Garuru Cannon** in Japanese). Omnimon Alter-S has the Grey Cannon (formed from BlitzGreymon) on the other arm instead.
    -   Gokumon/Reapermon in **Digimon Adventure: (2020)** has a two-barrelled cannon for an arm. The upper barrel fires beams. The lower one is a Grappling-Hook Pistol that doubles as its hand.
-   **Dragon Ball**:
    -   In **Dragon Ball**, villain Tao Pai Pai also got an Arm Cannon after being cybernetized.
    -   In **Dragon Ball Z**, Android 16 has two cannons called "Hell Blasters" in his upper arms. In order to use them, he has to remove his forearms, usually holding them in his armpits. It helps that his forearms can also be used for a Rocket Punch. A full-power blast from both cannons at once is known as "Hell's Flash" and is Android 16's most powerful attack.
    -   Many of Frieza's soldiers — presumably those too weak to use worthwhile Ki Manipulation — are equipped with arm cannons, which rarely do them any good against anyone who **can** use those kinds of attacks.
-   **Fullmetal Alchemist**:
    -   One character is seen cleaning (or polishing or something) an unused arm cannon. And a much earlier episode featured a man with an "arm gun". Winry also mentioned that she learned how to make an auto-mail Machine gun, causing Ed to ask her if she's a Mad Scientist.
    -   Panynia has a leg cannon.
    -   On top of that, both Edward and Wrath (2003 anime version) have transmuted their arms to machine guns.
    -   In the flashbacks to the Ishval campaign, Brigadier General Basque Gran uses a Philosopher's Stone and suddenly has cannons sticking out of his everywhere.
    -   A one shot videogame/Filler villain used an automail arm with a double barrel gattling gun, he heavily implied that he had them cut off and replaced intentionally to be a more effective soldier.
-   **Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex**:
    -   A political assassin has a shotgun built into her forearm. She cocks it by pulling back her own thumb, and it's modified to shoot a roll of gold coins into the target, a wealthy plutocrat. The plutocrat is guarded by Robot Maids who turn out to be Ninja Maids, one arm unfolding to reveal six gun muzzles and multiple target sensors.
    -   A Russian KGB agent sports a large-bore cannon built into her elbow. It is presumably a last-ditch weapon, as it is rather cumbersome to fire — her forearm must fold backward on a hinge to expose the muzzle.
    -   Terrorist "Angel Feathers" has a shotgun built into his wrist, and nearly kills Batou when he drops his guard after apparently disarming him.
    -   Motoko Aramaki built a grenade launcher into her own arm.
    -   Batou reveals that he has a cannon (well, a single-shot large-caliber firearm) built into his arm.
-   As mentioned in Artificial Limbs, one of Rally Vincent's recurring enemies in the manga series of **Gunsmith Cats** is a tall imposing man named Gray. He lost his hand in their first encounter and replaced his entire forearm with a multi-tooled Arm Cannon. Attachments included a hook and spring-launched machete.
-   Guu from **Haré+Guu** can change one of her arms into a Gatling gun (complete with spent shells popping out of her mouth). Like the rest of Guu, it's inexplicable.
-   The Jeeg Bazooka was, in the anime **Kotetsu Jeeg**, a fairly large bazooka that replaced his arm. In **Koutetsushin Jeeg**, it becomes large enough for him to "hide" in — a BFG.
-   Gordeau has one in **Lupin III: Island of Assassins**.
-   **Mazinger Z**, other than shooting its fists, hid a cannon in each upper arm shot drilling missiles. Several Mechanical Beasts had cannons (or even machine guns like Balkan P5) instead of limbs. An example stands out is Debira X1 (a beast seemed a blend between bat and vampire) had a hidden leg cannon (and blew one whole Mazinger's arm off with it).
-   After losing an arm (and an eye and a leg) in a No One Could Survive That! moment in **Gundam SEED**, Andrew Waltfeld appears in the sequel series **Gundam SEED Destiny** sporting a prosthetic replacement which, in a pinch, turns out to have a gun built into the wrist, revealed by partly detaching the hand.
-   **My Hero Academia**:
    -   Fallen Hero Lady Nagant, introduced during the Villain Hunt arc, can create a sniper rifle from her right elbow, and she's good enough with it that she can hit Izuku going at full speed from a kilometer away.
    -   Katsuki Bakugo eventually develops a nonconventional one on top of his arm-mounted cannons on his gauntlets as a special move he calls "AP Shot", where he focuses an explosion in a small space with his hands, allowing him to pierce solid concrete.
-   Miyu in **My-HiME** and **My-Otome** can turn her arm into an energy gun and a flamethrower, in addition to having **knee** cannons.
-   After a major upgrade, Chachamaru of **Negima! Magister Negi Magi** now sports one of these.
    -   Sayo also gained one after Haruna made her a robot body.
-   **Nichijou**: Nano has a machine gun in her right arm, which shoots beans. This is only Played for Laughs, though, and never used seriously.
-   **Nura: Rise of the Yokai Clan**: Yura Keikain's shikigami Rentei transforms into one in Yura's arm that shoots a powerful stream of water.
-   Franky from **One Piece** has a machinegun/cannon infinite-ammo combination in his left hand. His right hand extends on a chain and is very strong. Both hands are also impervious to normal damage... although those are not the only weapons he has integrated into his body.
    -   Early villain Wapol can morph his arms and tongue into cannons.
-   The Type 99 Helldiver military labor from **Patlabor** mounts a 40mm autocannon on its right arm.
-   **Robot Romance Trilogy**:
    -   **Combattler V**: Combattler-V is the king os this trope among Humongous Mecha. He is equipped with Atomic Burner (its hands withdraw inside its arms and are replaced with a flamethrower), Rock Fighter (it shoots missiles from its fingers) and Battle Guleggar (Combattler releases a chain with metal collar from the arms, used for grabbing opponents by the neck).
    -   **Voltes V**: Voltes Bazooka. The entire weapon is hidden in his right arm, and is deployed by tilting the right hand downward (which also becomes the weapon's grip held by the left hand) allowing the barrel to telescope out of the arm.
    -   **Daimos**: Daimos has the Daimos Chain Shark, two chains with a hook shoot from above Daimos' hands. They can be used to deal damage or to drag the enemy.
-   Hyūgo Kujiranami in **Rurouni Kenshin** first uses an Armstrong Cannon for an arm, and then a Grenade Launcher in his plot to get revenge on Kenshin for cutting off his arm and not killing him as a warrior should.
-   A character in Episode 3 of **Samurai 7** had a drop-down gun in his arm that fires big needles from a revolver-like chamber. It was fired by flexing the wrist.
-   **Sgt. Frog**: All of the Vipers have one. A parody of **Space Adventure Cobra** and the psychogun.
-   Both Ken and Ryuuichi from Snow White and Seven Dwarfs have this ability.
-   The title hero of **Space Adventure Cobra** has a beam weapon replacing his left arm, the "Psychogun", which fires beams powered by his psychic energy. When not in use, he covers it with a prosthetic arm and hand.
-   The Mariage from **StrikerS Sound Stage X** of the **Lyrical Nanoha** franchise. One of the many forms their arms can take is a high-explosive howitzer-style cannon which one of them used on an unprepared mage. Since the mage was Subaru, It doesn't work.
-   Vash the Stampede in **Trigun** has something similar to this: his Artificial Limb folds out into a submachine gun. By tapping into the plant power inside his revolver, each of his arms can also morph into something akin to a Wave-Motion Gun.
-   In **YuYu Hakusho**, when Sensui switches to his Kazuya personality, his left hand morphs into a gun.

Arm Cannon Example in Art

-   In the art book **Drawing and Painting the Undead**, one creature, the Mechanized Corpse, had its left arm replaced with an M60 machine gun. The ammo belt replaced its stomach and intestines.

---
Arm Cannon Example in Comic Books

-   **The Amazing Adventures of the Escapist**: The last issue doesn't feature the Escapist at all, but rather his Empire Comics stablemate Mr. Machine Gun. Mr. Machine Gun has a cybernetic hand that can turn into a powerful submachine gun, magazine included — and he's a hero.
-   **The Amory Wars**: Coheed has his right arm end up one of these. It's quite possibly the most realistic power of all the Kilgannons. (Coheed's left arm has several curved blades that pop out of it, as well as being able to destroy stars; his wife, Cambria, has tele-everything \[-kinesis, telepathy, clairvoyance...\], their surviving child, their son Claudio, has natural star-killing abilities, and can aparently melt through walls. As well as clairvoyance.)
-   **The DCU**:
    -   **Aquaman**: In one of the many, many attempts by the DC writers to counteract the whole **Superfriends** cock-up, Aquaman had his arm chewed off by piranha when his powers were disabled. He got it replaced with a harpoon, and later a cybernetic hand that could morph into a harpoon gun. The hand was later replaced with one made of mystical water. Neither really helped his image much.
    -   **Batman**: The KGBeast, a Russian villain, hacked off his hand out of necessity and had a gun on the stump when he showed up again. Uniquely it often features a bayonet, combining this trope with Blade Below the Shoulder.
    -   **Gotham City Garage**: In Issue #4, Kara Gordon and Nightwing fight Amazo, a robot equipped with two laser cannons built into its arms.
    -   **Green Lantern**: Guy Gardner has an alien lineage that gives him the ability to shift his body into any weapon.
    -   **Legion of Super-Heroes**: The villain Tyr is equipped with a powerful bionic gun in place of one of his real arms. The gun can fire powerful energy blasts, and can somehow control the minds of others. The gun can detach itself from Tyr's body and fly away, in the event he is captured.
    -   **Superman/Supergirl: Maelstrom**: One of the soldiers fought by the titular villain during a gladiator battle has gotten both arms replaced with huge, glowing cannons.
    -   **Superman**: The Cyborg Superman can transform his right arm into a double-barreled energy cannon. that's powerful enough to blow holes in the Eradicator, vaporize humans and even injure Superman himself.
    -   **Teen Titans**: Cyborg can transform either one or (both depending on the story, continuity, medium and etc.) into his iconic "Sonic Cannon". While appearance may very, they usually are used to deal ranged concussive force and also may or may not be backed up by him shouting "Booyah!".
    -   **Wonder Woman**:
        -   The villain Cyborgirl has a gauntlet implanted in her arm that fires electrical blasts and can morph her hand into the barrel of a powerful white sound generator packing the punch of a cannon. She eventually underwent a Rogues' Gallery Transplant and started fighting Cyborg more than Wondy.
        -   In the last issue of "The Contest", Artemis neutralizes one of Widow Saiza's cyborg enforcers by shooting an arrow into the barrel of the gun in place of his hand. When he tries to fire anyway it wrecks his whole arm (prosthetic) as it blows up.
-   **Dungeon Twilight**: Red Marvin gets two powerful one with his armor, he can use them as transportation to leap away from trouble and are the only weapon that can hurt Elyacin, the resident Juggernaut.
-   **G.I. Joe**: The BATs (Battle Android Troopers) have a variety of arm cannons, including machine guns and flamethrowers. Depending on the incarnation involved, they either have to be manually swapped out for hands or transform automatically.
-   **Marvel Universe**:
    -   **Daredevil**: The villain Bushwacker can transform his right arm into a gun thanks to CIA experiments performed on him. He has to swallow bullets whole to provide ammunition.
    -   **Death's Head II**: The titular cyborg has a very high-tech right hand (from the future!) that can transform into a BFG, among other things.
    -   **The Magnificent Ms. Marvel**: Stormranger, a living nanotech super-suit, can transform her hands into energy cannons.
    -   **The Punisher**: The villain Rapido has a Gatling gun mounted in place of his missing arm.
    -   **X-Men**: Random can turn his arms into protoplasm-firing guns.
-   In **Sinister Dexter**, the character Kal Cutter has a Mangapore skin-job replacing his right hand — when he points his hand like a gun and says "skin", his hand turns into a pistol. If he then says "hush" it grows a silencer.
-   **Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)**: The Cyborg Bunnie Rabbot sports one. However, since she is only partly cyborg, the power is drained straight from her life force.
-   **Star Wars (Marvel 1977)**: Valance, a cyborg bounty hunter, has a blaster cannon fitted inside an artificial arm. It's powerful enough to take down a wall, and even comes very close to killing Darth Vader himself.
-   **Storm Force**: John Storm had his left arm amputated above the elbow: he then carried around a rucksack full of prosthetic weapons (e.g., a machine gun arm and a flamethrower arm). He could also connect his stump to vehicles (e.g., a car or an aircraft), as long as they were designed for this.
-   **Transformers**:
    -   Shockwave not only sports a cannon as his left arm, but also transforms into a gun — making him a relatively rare example of "Entire Body Cannon".
    -   Megatron's Fusion Cannon is awkwardly attached to it, making his right hand almost useless to do anything (except perhaps point at things). The Fusion Cannon transforms into the scope of his gun.
    -   Turmoil's entire right arm is a massive cannon which he uses to great effect in **The Transformers: All Hail Megatron** and **The Transformers: Robots in Disguise**.
    -   Galvatron, being a remade version of Megatron in most continuities (the main exception being IDW, where he's a completely unrelated character) also sports a large energy cannon attached to his right arm.
    -   The massive Omega Supreme not only has a cannon for a left arm, his right arm is a simple three-fingered claw that in some versions has another cannon built into the palm. Manual dexterity is not his strong suit.
-   **The Warlord (DC)**: After being resurrected by Deimos, the mercenary Chakal had his right arm replaced with an energy weapon.

Arm Cannon Example in Comic Strips

-   **Dick Tracy** villain Dr Plain had a small flamethrower built into his artificial arm.

Arm Cannon Example in Fan Works

-   In **Amazing Fantasy**, Vulture's Quirk, "Bushwacker", allows him to turn his arm into any kind of single-shot firearm. He can then load marbles into them and fire them like a real gun. But since they run on compressed air taken from his lungs, he has to spend time sucking in air to produce enough force to fire them. The amount of time is proportionate to the strength of the gun he's using.
-   Alpha from **Clash of the Elements** has the ability to create one of these from both of his robotic arms. The primary function of them seems to be to shoot ionic energy in the form of a concentrated laser beam, but only time will tell if they are capable of shooting more.
-   Dyna the Steampunk Fem Bot from **Voyages of the Wild Sea Horse** has a left arm that consists of an interchangeable mount for various firearms. She gets around the limitations that this poses for her manual dexterity by having smaller secondary arms to perform fine manipulation.

Arm Cannon Example in Films — Animation

-   **The Iron Giant**: the titular Giant is revealed at the climax to have a hidden arsenal of powerful energy weapons, and is shown to be able to morph both his forearms into powerful cannons- one firing balls of green plasma that can absorb and disintegrate tanks, and another that fires concussive blasts as well as a secondary weapon that shoots bolts of electricity.
-   Rattlesnake Jake from **Rango** has a Gatling gun where his rattle should be. Instead of shaking his rattle as a warning, he spins the barrels. It's **really** creepy.
-   Emperor Zurg in **Toy Story 2** has one as an add-on accessory that shoots out what looks to be Nerf gun balls.
-   In Disney's **Treasure Planet**, Long John Silver was a cyborg and had an arm that transformed into a cannon at one point.
-   EVE from **Wall E**. Like Mega Man, she can morph it from gun to hand, and even a little transitional mode which she uses most of the time. It's even detachable, and has an outside trigger which lets it be used by other characters as a conventional weapon. Darn it, WALL-E.
-   **Wreck-It Ralph**: As the first demonstration of their assimilation ability, a Cy-Bug that eats Ralph's rifle promptly morphs its forelimbs into rifles and chases after him.

Arm Cannon Example in Literature

-   **Alan Alone**: Dede the robot can weaponise his arms to shoot out loud blasts, much to Alan's surprise. Dede shoots a shot into the air, making a loud sound which disperses the Z-Soldier fighter planes.
-   Aside from many obvious instances mounted on the Humongous Mecha of the setting, two separate characters (who never actually meet) in the BattleTech Expanded Universe **Warrior** trilogy have custom laser weapons built into their prosthetic forearms. One of them finds his rather handy a couple of times when no other gun is available and just slugging an opponent with his metal fist isn't an option; the other never actually gets the chance to use his because when finally confronted with a would-be assassin, the latter reveals that he'd already infiltrated his victim's home days before and among other things made sure to drain the weapon's power cell.
-   The protagonist of **Lone Huntress** is one of the few in her galaxy to bother with such a thing. Among its many drawbacks: it has to be connected to her Powered Armor, and lacks the firing capacity of an external weapon with a separate power supply. On the other hand<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>, the actual weapons themselves are small enough that she can fit a diverse assortment into the single prosthetic.
    -   Of course, when she's not in her Powered Armor she prefers a prosthetic hand and forearm. Which includes a smartphone, Wolverine Claws, and a compartment for carrying additional items. Including a first aid kit.
-   The Cobra cyborg warriors in Timothy Zahn's **The Cobra Trilogy**. Each Cobra warrior (the good guys, by the way) has a laser built into each hand, a powerful shock launcher capable of frying electrical equipment, and a tank-killer class laser built into their leg. All without any external cues that would indicate their augmentation.
-   David Weber's **Honor Harrington** has a pulser (hypervelocity needle launcher) built into her cybernetic arm as a holdout/emergency weapon. She needs a fingertip replaced whenever she uses it, but it does the job of a hand well enough and is almost impossible to spot.
-   Bernard Wolfe's science-fiction novel **Limbo** is all about a society where self-amputation is encouraged by the culture, using Artificial Limbs only during sport. It is seen as a moral equivalent to warfare, a case of literal disarmament. Unfortunately, the old Cold War tensions remain, and during the award ceremony at the Olympic Games the Eastern faction gun down the leaders of the Western faction with arm-weapons. The President of the Western faction, who survived the attack, admits they've been secretly developing their own arm-weaponry as well, everything from rifle-arms to rotary saws and nuclear-powered flamethrowers.
-   Max Barry's **Machine Man** equips Dr. Charles Neumann with one after he's become a Man in the Machine. It's intended to be the first of an entire line of weaponry for Super Soldiers.
-   The titular Murderbot of **The Murderbot Diaries** has "energy weapons" embedded in both forearms, though in this case the ports are small and streamlined enough to be covered by a jacket sleeve when Murderbot is passing for human, and leave its hands free.
-   In **The Oregon Files**, Juan Cabrillo, the leader of a team of heroic mercenaries, has a high-caliber pistol built into a false foot — in addition to a number of other goodies, making it something of a Swiss Army Foot.
-   **Star Wars Legends** includes a type of four-armed nanny droid with blasters hidden beneath detachable hands on two of the arms. They're intended for the kidnapping-vulnerable children of politicians and such. Leia's custom-modified model for her son Anakin included this function on all four arms.
    -   Eanjer in **Star Wars: Scoundrels** uses a sneaky variation: the medical cast on his apparently injured hand conceals...a perfectly normal, fuctional hand, **holding a blaster**. Justified as he's Boba Fett in disguise.
-   Etienne, the eponymous patriarch and head of E.E. "Doc" Smith's **Family d'Alembert**, has a cybernetic right hand that he passes off to casual acquaintances as the consequence of a "circus injury". In fact, he lost the original on Imperial service. The index finger is a compact blaster while the other fingers can be configured for various purposes. At one point, one of them turns out to be a hand grenade.

-   **Blake's 7**. Space Commander Travis has a large yellow Power Crystal (a lazeron destroyer) set on his artificial hand. He lost his left arm after being shot by Blake, so is eager to use it on him. Instead Travis tends to lose the hand whenever someone is Blasting It Out Of His Hand.

-   **Cleopatra 2525**: The Betrayers are robots disguised a humans whose arms can turn into laser cannons. Their creators, giant machines called Baileys, can also deploy arm-like appendages that fire energy bolts.
-   **Doctor Who**:
    -   Autons (of the shop window dummy variety) have guns built into their right hands, which drop open to fire.
    -   "The Pandorica Opens"/"The Big Bang": The Auton Romans, including Rory, have these.
    -   The Pete's World Cybermen that appear from "Army of Ghosts" onwards have retractable laser cannons built into their forearms.
    -   "A Town Called Mercy": The Gunslinger has a large energy weapon in the place of his right hand.
-   **Farscape**. Tavleks wear a gauntlet that fires an energy weapon, but also injects the wearer with addictive Psycho Serum that ups their strength and aggression.
-   **Kamen Rider**:
    -   **Kamen Rider Den-O**: Deneb gives this an odd twist: his individual fingers are guns. When he merges with his partner Yuuto to form Kamen Rider Zeronos Vega Form, his hands turn into shoulder-mounted machineguns.
    -   **Kamen Rider V3**:
        -   Riderman was notable for being a Rider whose only technological augmentation was his right arm, and just for that, he **still** threw down more than any regular human ought to be able to. The arm itself could change somehow, through cassette cartridges inserted in his right elbow, into various forms (a drill, a claw, a net launcher, the **original** Hookshot...) but it wasn't until he showed up in **Kamen Rider SPIRITS** that he got a proper **gun**. A proper Machinegun Arm that could, in a pinch, fire individual shells; seeing as how he just didn't have the firepower to take down some of his foes, these shells were **hardening agents**, on the theory that, if they couldn't attack him, he didn't actually need to blow them up.
        -   The first **Kamen Rider Decade** movie gives Riderman (played here by GACKT) the Blaster Arm, a high-power energy cannon. However, unlike his others, he actually has to **tear off** his original cybernetic arm and attach the Blaster to the severed stump in order to use it.
-   **Revolution**: Charlie gets one in Episode 2, but it's highly inaccurate and only works once.
-   Numerous **Ultra Series** kaiju possess these. One of the more notable examples though is King Joe, who in certain series, notably **Ultra Galaxy Mega Monster Battle**, carries one capable of killing lesser kaiju in only a few shots and doing devastating damage to Ultra heroes.

Arm Cannon Example in Pinball

-   The T-X from **Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines** has a Plasma Cannon in her left arm. She uses it to launch pinballs at the player.
-   The protagonist of "Space Sister" in **Super Pinball II: The Amazing Odyssey** has one. Justified in that she is a Captain Ersatz of Samus Aran.

Arm Cannon Example in Tabletop Games

-   Many Battlemechs in **BattleTech** mount a large gun where a hand would be, and leave the other arm free with a hand. Many other 'mechs do this with **both** arms, turning the 'mech into a dedicated firing platform at the cost of melee combat ability. Suits of Powered Armor traditionally have an arm cannon on the right arm and a controllable hand or claw on the left arm, though armor on the extremes of the weight scale may drop the fixed weapon or the hand for more mobility or combat capability, respectively.
-   Though there are no official "standard" magic items to do such, creating a component for a warforged (from **Dungeons & Dragons**' Eberron campaign setting) that did something similar would be a matter of upgrading the damage an arm**bow** could cause. In 4E, a crossbow can be embedded with the "Armbow" enchantment; the main perk is not having to worry about reloading.
-   The post-Steampunk roleplaying game **Etherscope** includes rules for both cybernaughtic (i.e. robotic) arms and integrated weaponry, allowing a character at second level to integrate a pistol, or even a **miniaturized grenade launcher** into their arms.
-   **Exalted**: Alchemical Exalted can get a Charm installed that allows them to turn their arm into a gun that fires pure Essence, as demonstrated here by Elegant Nova of Progression.
    -   In second edition this was removed from their core Charms and became an Ink Monkeys aftermarket upgrade; while it still took a Charm slot, that selfsame Charm could be expanded to produce a secondary "siege devastator" mode, a sword, or any other piece of kit you could reasonably fit within an Alchemical's body.
-   Games Workshop games
    -   ''Warhammer 40,000':
        -   The Obliterator cult from is a cult of extremely chaos-mutated Space Marines whose bodies have been literally fused to their own weaponry and armour, allowing them to morph their warped body parts (with arms being preferred) into various types of BFGs at will, literally turning themselves into walking humanoid heavy weapon platforms.
        -   Tyranid weapons are all organic parts of the wielder's body, but luckily they have backup arms...
        -   Combat servitors have had one or both of their arms replaced by weaponry of one sort or another.
    -   In **Warhammer**, the Skaven Warlock Ikit Claw, so named because in place of one arm he's got a Magitek prosthesis. With a built-in warpfire thrower.
-   **GURPS**: At least one version of the **Ultra-Tech** supplement lets a gun be implanted inside a character's hand or arm. Alternately, the entire arm can just be replaced with a weapon mount.
-   In **Hc Svnt Dracones** an ordinary prosthetic limb can be used to conceal a small weapon, though only as a hiding place it has to be removed to use. But a reinforced prosthetic may contain a gun of up to medium size (like an assault rifle) which it splits open to reveal.
-   Arm cannons are an available Technocracy implant in **Mage: The Ascension**, either a small but concealable one, or a large and obvious one. Notably, you're required to get the skeletal reinforcement implant before getting one, and since plasma cannons are both blatantly obvious and **not** considered real by the vast majority of humanity, Paradox makes them dangerous to use on a metaphysical level, as well.
-   **Heroscape**:
    -   Majors Q9 and Q10, Zetacron, the Zettian Guards, Deathwalkers 8000 and 9000, and the Blastatrons.
    -   The Marro Drudge also count, although their guns aren't permanently attached to their hands. (They are attached to tubes which come out of their hips.)
-   **MechWarrior**, the tabletop roleplaying companion game to the **BattleTech** tactical game, allowed any character who needed an artificial limb to replace one that they'd lost to also install special equipment in it. Naturally, concealed weapons were included, ranging from the somewhat feasible (such as a hold-out pistol hidden in the wrist) to the highly unlikely (like an **entire laser rifle** built into the forearm). The rules didn't explicitly deny the inclusion of any weapons beyond Game Master fiat, and if a GM wasn't paying attention or didn't care, this could lead to things such as concealed double-barrel shotguns, concealed Gauss pistols, or **concealed anti-'Mech rocket launchers**.
-   The collectible miniatures game **Monsterpocalypse** includes Rogzor of the Planet Eaters, who has **two** arm cannons.
-   The **Shadowrun** RPG offers these as a type of cyberware. The end of the gun is in the palm, and locking one's hand back links it to the rest of the gun barrel. Rarely used as typically not worth the cost or essence, it does allow one to use their hand though. There was also a picture of a character with the more traditional gun as a hand in the older Critter's book.

Arm Cannon Example in Toys

-   LEGO:
    -   **BIONICLE**'s Exo-Toa armor (in place of a hand), Hydraxon (attached to the arm) and Hewkii Mahri (attached to the arm, but he lacks a hand anyways).
    -   Numerous mechs from **LEGO Exo-Force**.
-   The Shogun Warriors toy line is full of these, even with figures where it makes no sense, like Godzilla.

Arm Cannon Example in Video Games

-   In the **Armored Core** series, arms with integrated weapons are possible part selections for your Humongous Mecha. Practically every type of weapon is available — arm machine guns, arm beam swords, arm beam cannons, arm **bazookas**... Weapon arms are much more weight — and energy-efficient than hands holding guns, though less destructive and less versatile. This doesn't stop the EKLAKH machine gun arms from ripping whatever they target to pieces.
-   In **Armorines: Project S.W.A.R.M.**, your Space Marines each have their firearms of choice built into their arms, which can be fitted with all kinds of ammunition, ranging from machine-guns to lasers and grenades.
-   Jack in **Ar tonelico: Melody of Elemia** has his left arm (and most of his torso) converted into machinery, with his arm doubling as a Gatling gun. Of course, he only uses it in his powered-up state, and normally just fires a pistol that he holds in his right hand.
-   **BioForge**: One of the enhancements that the protagonist got as part of his Unwilling Roboticisation. As the weapon is small and concealed, he doesn't even realize it for the longest time.
-   Grobyc (note the Sdrawkcab significance) from **Chrono Cross**.
-   **Command & Conquer**:
    -   The Russian cybernetic Super-Soldier Volkov from **Command & Conquer: Red Alert** has his arm turned into a tank cannon. Depending on the level, he may use a silenced pistol instead.
    -   Also Cyborgs in **Tiberian Sun** and **Kane's Wrath**.
-   Brad Fang of **Contra: Hard Corps** has a gun grafted onto his arm which can function as a machine gun, vulcan cannon, or flamethrower.
-   **Dawn of the Monsters**:
    -   Tempest Galahad can transform her arms into energy cannons capable of firing bullets of Sheol energy.
    -   The Monarch of Tides, Sednagon, can transform her water tentacles into arm-cannons that fire water bullets.
-   In **Dead Rising**, Frank can find toy Mega Busters that fires soft projectiles that are not very effective against zombies. Getting a specific achievement will unlock the **Real** Mega Buster, which fires **real** energy bolts that will kill zombies for **real**
-   **The Divide: Enemies Within** have you piloting a Chicken Walker whose default weapons are dual arm cannons. Who can be upgraded to gatling guns, grenade launchers or flamethrowers.
-   The Rifle Demons in the **Disgaea** series have arm cannons that fire energy blasts and can also generate a Tractor Beam and Laser Blade in some of the games.
-   The towering Cyberdemon from **Doom** has a rocket launcher instead of his left forearm, and the grotesquely obese mancubus from **Doom 2** has both of his hands replaced by rockets as well.
-   In the epilogue of the Trespasser DLC of **Dragon Age: Inquisition**, depending on the decisions made certain scenes show the Inquisitor replacing the arm they lost after the removal of the Anchor with a crossbow of sorts.
-   All weapons wielded by heavy armor in **Dystopia**.
-   In **Evil Dead: A Fistful of Boomstick**, Ash Williams, as an extension of his usage of right-hand replacement weapons, can swap out his chainsaw hand for a gatling gun.
-   **Evolva**: Switching into several of the weapons, like the Spore, makes the Genohunters' hands transform into this.
-   In **Evolve**, Bucket's right arm from the elbow down has been replaced with a missile launcher and targeting laser.
-   **Fallout 3** has Protectrons whose arms have integrated laser cannons. And of course the badass Sentrybots whose one arm is a gattling laser cannon while the other is a rocket launcher. **"Hostile detected. Non-combatant safety can no longer be guaranteed."** No shit...
-   Barret in **Final Fantasy VII** switched his prosthetic arm to a gun when he got permanently pissed off, and changes back in supplementary materials once he's done. In **Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children** he upgraded to a cybernetic arm that can shift to a Gatling gun **or** a particle beam cannon.
-   **Ghost Song**: In direct reference to Samus Aran, the protagonist's Deadsuit has one for a left hand. The fact that it cuts off at the wrist has disturbing implications for the person inside it.
-   Mondo Zappa, from **Killer is Dead**, has a cybernetic left arm that can morph into a machine gun, ice blaster, and charged cannon.
-   K9999/Krohnen from **The King of Fighters** series possesses an arm cannon as part of his transformation weapons which he uses for his You, get lost too!/Fusion Blaster super move, the likes of which include a drill and even a Body Horror abomination ripped straight out of **AKIRA** (which Krohnen would substitute for a giant mechanical claw instead).
-   Aros Helgason from **Jitsu Squad** has a mechanical right arm after losing it to a dragon years ago. And when unleashing his special attacks, his arm can transform into either a Gatling gun or a massive cannon.
-   Pulsefire Ezreal in **League of Legends** is a cyborg from a Bad Future who has had parts of himself replaced with technological weaponry, though it's ambiguous which folder on this page he belongs in. It's never been clarified whether the enormous beam cannon that completely covers his left forearm **is** his left forearm.
-   **Mass Effect**:
    -   In **Mass Effect 3**, Cannibals, batarian-derived Husks use arm cannons that are actually **human** bodies grafted onto their own. It's a combination of a machine gun and grenade launcher.
    -   Scions are built around their massive arm cannon. In **Mass Effect 2**, it shoots an anti-infantry shockwave that deals heavy damage and knocks you out of cover. In **3**, it's upgraded to a burst fire explosive energy cannon, that fires extremely accurate and powerful projectiles that do more damage than any other ranged attack in the entire game — including the anti-tank rockets Atlas Mechs shoot.
-   **Mega Man** in many incarnations. All versions justify this by having his arm morph from the cannon to a regular hand.
    -   Zero has a transforming handheld saber, shield, pogo lance, hookshot, and tonfas, and a looted energy pistol. It doesn't stop him from using the Z-knuckle to graft enemy turrets and flamethrowers onto his arm, classic-style, in the fourth game.
    -   And on the subject of **Mega Man Zero**, Fighting Fefnir. By extension, Model F users in **ZX**, which actually falls into the second category. Model FX users just have Hand Cannons Akimbo.
    -   In the **Mega Man X** series, Zero's arm cannon is actually of the second type, emerging from his forearm. He lost his original body at the Time Skip between the **X** and **Zero** series, and the so-called Z-Buster is a pistol he grabbed off a dead Red Shirt to fight the Pantheons.
    -   MegaMan.EXE in the **Mega Man Battle Network** series can use an similarly to his ancestors, as well as certain weapon battle chips such as the Cannon, Shotgun, V-Shot, and 3-way. The MegaBuster itself, however, starts off very weak and lacks the ability to charge its shots until gets upgraded.
-   In **Metal Arms: Glitch in the System**, **every** robot with a dedicated weapon has them built in (save for Guards). Most Mil enemies even have dual arm cannons (and in one case, **quadruple** arm cannons), were Mil Grunts and Droid Miners only replace one arm. Somewhat Justified in that they're, y'know, **robots** that are actually made to fight, and it makes sense to integrate the weapons into their frames. However, in the case of the Droids, it's implied that they even have Arm Tools, and that they can actually swap various weapons and tools out as needed (This also makes sense; it has the weapon/tool's fire control and power supply directly connected to the Droid it's attached to, while still allowing for modular versatility). Glitch is the only one who demonstrates this, however. He even has a little hand he can snap onto his arm in place of a weapon, although it it functionally useless.
-   At the end of **Metal Gear Solid**, Gray Fox shows up wielding a laser cannon arm; with absolutely no explanation as to where it came from.
-   Pictured atop this page is Samus Aran from the **Metroid** series. Her Power Suit has one of these, which functions as a Swiss-Army Weapon, being able to fire different kinds of beams (and Missiles) that are typically unlocked over the course of a game. While the Power Suit may not have a right hand, Samus herself does, which can be seen in official art, whenever she ends up in the Zero Suit, and in-game with the X-Ray visor<small>◊</small> in the **Metroid Prime Trilogy**.
-   **Mighty Aphid**: Avery "Aphid" Cavor has a cannon as one of the arms of his suit, which he always sticks forward.
-   **Mighty Goose**: The titular character has Megaman-style cannons in place of wings, and uses them to blast incoming enemies.
-   **MS Saga: A New Dawn** features arm cannons and missile launchers as the replacable parts for a mobile suit. Due to how the game's mechanic works, however, these powerful weapons become impractical because the users then can't counter an enemy's close-range attack, being unable to use a melee weapon.
-   In **Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution 2** (and other releases, most likely), the game-exclusive character Bando can detach one of his hands and attach a Big Effin' Arm Cannon.
-   In **Nefarious**, the main character Crow has powered armor with an arm cannon that can shoot grenades.
-   The Fallen in **Nexus Clash** invert this trope and manufacture **ammunition** from one hand to fire it with the other. It hurts to do this.
-   John Cain, the main character of **One**, had his left arm forcefully replaced with one of these.
-   Doomfist from **Overwatch** is an unusual case of this with his "Hand Cannon" — rather than being an example of the Hand Cannon trope, his version is a series of bullet-firing minicannons mounted into his left knuckles, and are likely cybernetic implants. True to his name, this allows him to fire shotgun blasts out of his left hand while he wields his signature doom-bringing gauntlet with his right.
-   In **Persona 3** Aigis gets the deluxe version: Many of her equippable weapons (including her starting one) feature an Arm Cannon that allows her to fire bullets from her fingertips.
-   **Persona 5**: Party member Ryuji Sakamoto's Fighting Spirit, the pirate Willaim Kidd, has a pirate ship cannon instead of a Hook Hand in place of his right forearm. **Royal** gives him the evolution William, who has a more modern weapon.
-   **Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare 2**:
    -   Kernel Corn has an organic version; in lieu of hands he has two weaponized corn cobs spin around and fire kernels and can launch like missiles. He grows new ones to replace the ones he's lost.
    -   Torchwood has one hand replaced with a minigun.
-   **Pokémon**:
-   In **Purgatory 2**, Oliver reveals his nature as a Cyborg when S-001 turns on him, resulting in Oliver blowing his head off with a rifle that was concealed inside his arm.
-   Many Strogg enemies in the **Quake** series, one even has a driller-arm which can shoot lightning out of it.
-   In **The Reconstruction** and **I Miss the Sunrise**, Tezkhra is in possession of one. It runs on energy collection technology he designed himself, and part of the reason for adding it instead of a regular cybernetic arm was field test data.
-   One type of alien baddie in **Redneck Rampage** uses one that the player is able to use after killing the enemy. Since the weapon was grafted on, your character totes the gun around with part of the alien's severed arm still attached, and fires it by yanking on an exposed tendon.
-   The Barrelchest Mk II in **RuneScape**'s "A Clockwork Syringe" quest is equipped with a full-size gunpowder cannon in place of its left hand.
-   In **Saints Row: The Third** the protagonist gets to use an Arm Cannon in the mission "http://deckers.die" and get to keep it after.
-   In **Septerra Core**, the bounty hunter Ayram had a pair of arm **missiles**. They even return after he fires them. He'd still rather have actual hands, though.
    
    **Ayram:** If I had hands I could create as you do.
    
-   **Severed Steel** stars a protagonist who begins the campaign with her left arm missing and gets to graft a prototype cannon that is cappable of destroying walls.
-   **Sol Forge** card Forgeplate Sentry grows one at level 3.
-   **Sonic Adventure**: E-102 Gamma has one. His "brothers" Beta, Delta, and Epsilon each have two.
-   Stinger from **Spyborgs** have a cannon built in place of his left arm after losing his appendage. Which can fire missiles, projectiles, or become a gatling cannon.
-   General Warfield from **StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty** gets one of these after losing his arm to hydralisk venom. It transforms from fully-articulated arm and three-fingered hand to built-in gun and back.
-   In **Super Mario RPG**, all weapons equippable by Geno have to do with some sort of gun. Standard guns shoot from his fingertip, his punches launch his forearms at the enemy, and one weapon, the "Hand Cannon", actually shoots cannonballs from his elbow.
-   **Super Smash Bros.**: In addition to Samus, Dark Samus, and Mega Man, the Mii Gunner has an arm cannon as their default weapon, although some costumes replace this with a normally wielded weapon. Corrin also uses one for his Standard Special Move, Dragon Fang Shot, which has Corrin's left hand morph into a dragon-shaped blaster.
-   **Stormland** sees you playing as a robot with a laser gun built on the back of your wrist, your default weapon. You trigger it by aiming and twitching your forefinger, but needs to access an Auto Doc first due to having your forefinger ripped off in the backstory.
-   Forcystus in **Tales of Symphonia** has one of these; it's never explained how he got it, since he's a minor boss villain, but given that he wears an eyepatch as well, it's likely a replacement for a battle injury.
-   Wild Dog in the **Time Crisis** games. He replaces the arm he lost in the first game with a machine gun, he adds a flamethrower and a rocket launcher in the third game, and in fourth game he adds a grappling hook and a tractor beam.
-   **Touhou Project**:
    -   Reisen is shown to fire her bullets straight out of her fingers (often with her hand in the classic invisible gun pose).
    -   **Touhou Chireiden ~ Subterranean Animism** gives us Utsuho Reiuji, whose right forearm is a nuclear control rod capable of firing (relatively) small suns. Although it wasn't confirmed as an arm cannon until **Hisoutensoku**, fandom nonetheless ran with it (skip to 2:00).
-   **Transformers: War for Cybertron** sees all weapons form in place of the arm, including weapons such as Megatron's Fusion Cannon (which is traditionally a type 2 Arm Cannon) and Optimus Prime's Ion Blaster (which is traditionally held like a normal rifle)<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>.
    -   The Sequel **Transformers: Fall of Cybertron** continues this trait, with the additional ability to switch hands.
-   In **Tribes: Vengeance**. All weapons for heavy armor seem to be the front half of regularly accessible weapons for other classes slotted into the front excluding the mortar launcher which is heavy exclusive.
-   In the No Mercy route of **Undertale**, Mettaton NEO is shown to have one, but due to him being an Anti-Climax Boss, it is never actually used.
    -   **Undertale**'s successor, **Deltarune**, features Spamton NEO, the bonus boss of Chapter 2. Spamton NEO is very much intended to be a reference to Mettaton NEO all the way down to him having an arm cannon. But here, the Spamton NEO encounter is an actual fight, and he actually uses the arm cannon to great extent.
-   Several bosses from **Wolfenstein 3-D** have arm cannons, such as the Grosse Family and Adolf Hitler.
-   KOS-MOS from the **Xenosaga** series. It's usually just a regular arm, but she morphs it into an arm cannon for her R-Cannon attack.

Arm Cannon Example in Web Animation

-   **RWBY**: The right arm of the Colossus is a massive cannon featuring a revolving carousel of huge Dust cartridges that allow it to fire massive energy blasts that produce different types of elemental attacks. Also integrated in the cannon is a chamber of missiles that can pop out and launch up to sixteen missiles.

-   In **Demon Fist**, Jacob's Hook Hand shoots out on a chain, as a combination grappling hook and harpoon.
-   Ollie, a member of Master Payne's Circus of Adventure in **Girl Genius**, has a prosthetic hand that either can transform into a hand cannon or he has a separate hand cannon prosthetic. He is never seen with it in any stage but mechanical hand or weapon so it is unknown if it is two devices or one but it looks like he just removes the hand portion to access the cannon.
-   The superhero Cannon from **Heroes of C.R.A.S.H.** has one as his superpower.

Arm Cannon Example in Western Animation

-   Zachary Foxx from **Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers** has a bionic arm. It needs a bit of charge time before firing, making it an arm-sized Wave-Motion Gun more than an Arm Cannon. "Armada" showed it was capable of knocking a small starship off-course.
-   In **Code Lyoko**, amongst XANA's monsters the "Tarantula" has two laser cannons stubs in lieu of arms (and legs too, though the latter are never seen in use). Its firing position is a crouch reminiscent of **Star Wars**' Droidekas.

-   Rex from **Generator Rex** can create the Slam Cannon<small>◊</small> a giant cannon that uses anything it can grab as ammunition and replaces his arm whenever he creates it.
-   The **He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983)** villain Hordak, also the Big Bad from **She-Ra: Princess of Power**, could transform at will his arm into a cannon — a prominent use of his Voluntary Shapeshifting skillset; he could also turn his whole body into a rocket. The 1980s comics had the exact style of this vary wildly Depending on the Writer — sometimes the cannon was wider, sometimes narrower; generally it was his whole arm to the shoulder that transformed, while with certain illustrators it was just his forearm. Whatever form it took, it always looked awesomely badass — Skeletor never pulled off any trick like that...
    -   In the 2002 reboot, Man-At-Arms and Trap-Jaw could turn their arms into these (The former using Powered Armor and the latter having Artificial Limbs).
-   When Lightning Lad of **Legion of Super Heroes (2006)** has an arm blown off by Big Bad Imperiex, it's replaced with a large mechanical replacement that can be used to channel and amplify his powers. He's surprisingly okay with the loss of his limb. It probably has more to do, though, with finally getting his sister back than with the cool replacement.
-   The titular character in **Major Lazer** has a laser cannon for a right forearm.
-   In the Animated Series of **The Mask**, the titular character has a pirate form that has an appropriately-styled cannon replacing one arm.

-   In **Teen Titans (2003)**, Cyborg has weaponry in almost all of his appendages. No, he's **not kidding** about the shoe rocket. His sonic cannons remain his favorite weapon, though.

    -   Cyborg also sports two in **DC Super Friends**.
-   Loads and loads of **Transformers**, with some being able to swap out for a regular hand and others seemingly being permanent fixtures.
-   **Young Justice (2010)**: Lex Luthor's bodyguard Mercy Graves has a cyborg laser cannon disguised as her right arm. When Roy Harper turns up looking for revenge over getting abducted and having his arm cut off for Luthor's experiments, Luthor is able to buy him off by giving Roy an arm cannon of his own; an undisguised but more powerful model.

Arm Cannon Example in Anime and Manga

-   **Digimon Tamers**: Beelzemon gets a very impressive one, called "Death Slinger" and an equally impressive set of black wings in Blast Mode.
-   **Doraemon**: One of Doraemon's gadgets is an arm cannon that can shoot blasts of air to blow people away. He uses the arm cannon in "My Best Friend Doraemon" to blow Gian out of the way while he is under the control of Suneo, who is using the Buddy Beacon to make him his best friend. Other characters have also use it on few occasions, including Nobita, Gian, and even Shizuka.
-   **Dragon Ball Z**: Frieza's lowly soldiers in the Planet Trade organization often use small arm cannons, though usually to no avail against far stronger foes, as these guys are nothing but cannon fodder for the main characters. Seems like the main use for these weapons is to conserve those fighters' meager store of power.
-   Gates from **Full Metal Panic!: The Second Raid** might count. His Venom has a pair of machine guns on his back which swing forward beneath the armpits into a position where they can be aimed by hand.
-   The Power Launchers in **Heavy Metal L-Gaim** are among these.
-   Nove's Gun Knuckle in **Lyrical Nanoha**, which was modified by Jail to fire energy bullets like a machine gun as well.
-   **Gundam**:
    -   The Gundam "Alex" in **Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket** has a Gatling gun hidden in each forearm, which came as a nasty surprise to the Zeon commando who tried to take it out.
    -   Likewise, the Shining Gundam has a pair of light beam guns on its arms.
    -   And before either of those, the Zeta Gundam had twin grenade launchers.
    -   In **Mobile Suit Gundam 00**, all of the Human Reform League's mobile suits either had an arm-mounted cannon, or a BFG and sensor array replacing the head
    -   There is also **Mobile Suit Gundam Wing**'s pre-redesign Gundam Heavyarms, which sported a massive Gatling gun on it's left arm... and two more in the chest-plates... not to mention the multiple rocket launchers everywhere they could fit them. More Dakka AND Macross Missile Massacre, anyone?
        -   Post-redesign in Endless waltz switched the one gun on the left arm to -two- massive gatling guns on the right arm, and still keeping the rest of its armament.
-   Absalom from **One Piece** combines his invisibility powers with a pair of arm mounted bazookas to surprise his enemies.
-   **Macross Delta**: Both the VF-31 Kairos/Siegfried and the SV-262 Draken III variable fighters have 27mm railguns in their forearms.
-   **My Hero Academia**: Katsuki Bakugo requested these as part of his grenade-shaped gauntlets. They collect the nitroglycerin in his sweat, and flash red when full. He can then aim them and pull a pin trigger to create a devastating blast.
-   **Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl**: Pokémon Hunter J wears a cannon on her left arm that is used to petrify Pokémon.
-   **Reborn! (2004)**: Gokudera obtains an arm-mounted cannon at the beginning of the Future Arc
-   In **Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-**, when the group first comes across a kudan gang war, the gang members are aiming their arms at each other while shooting off energy from just above their wrists, clearly meant to evoke the arm-mounted cannon.

Arm Cannon Example in Asian Animation

-   In Season 3 episode 29 of **Happy Heroes**, the evil duplicate of Careful S. wields an arm cannon on a device he's wearing on his wrist as he's fighting the real Careful S. and his other duplicates.

Arm Cannon Example in Comic Books

-   **ABC Warriors**: Hammerstein has several mounted on his left arm.
-   **The DCU**'s Deadshot has two specially-designed arm-mounted guns which are an iconic part of his character. The design and how the ammo is fed into it usually varies (for example, one design has ammo belts that go around the wrist like a bracelet).
-   In **Supergirl** story **Supergirl: Cosmic Adventures in the 8th Grade** Lena has laser cannons mounted on her Powered Armor's forearms.
-   **The Transformers: Drift**: Turmoil's appearance in the present all fall under type 1, but his flashback form has his cannon arm mounted rather than in place of his arm.
-   **Spider-Man**: The Assassin Spider-Man introduced in **Spider-Verse** has guns on the underside of his arms.
    
    **Six-Armed Spider-Man:** Why do your web web-shooters fire bullets?  
    **Assassin Spider-Man:** Better question... why **don't** yours?
    
-   **Robin (1993)**: The Powered Armor of the assassin Scarab has retractable guns mounted at her wrists and along her forearm.
-   **Valérian - Country without Star**, among the primitive Organic Technology used in that world, Valerian is issued an arm-mounted crossbow type weapon that fires scorpions and deadly dragonflies.

Arm Cannon Example in Fan Works

-   In **Amazing Fantasy**, Clash has sonic cannons built into the palms of her costume. They're powerful enough to blast Fat Gum away and even match his strongest attack, albeit at the cost of breaking an arm.
-   Jack from **Calvin & Hobbes: The Series** gains this when his Morality Dial is switched.
-   Several characters in **Origins**, a **Mass Effect**/**Star Wars**/**Borderlands**/**Halo** Massive Multiplayer Crossover, receive these as part of an armor upgrade. The M-76 Revenant received a huge overhaul, with the enhanced version earning the name "FireHose." These weapons are comically inaccurate without stabilization, so soldiers issued the weapon also equip arm-mounted bracers to handle the huge guns, turning them into this trope. This also enables one person to use two at once.

Arm Cannon Example in Films — Animated

-   **The Incredibles**. Syndrome has a zero-point energy beam weapon mounted in his gauntlet. It freezes a person in place rather than killing them, so hilarity ensues whenever Syndrome starts Milking the Giant Cow while it's activated.
    
    **Syndrome:** I am SYNDROME! Your NEMESIS! **\[throws his arms up, hurling Mr. Incredible out of sight\]** Oh, brilliant...
    
-   Metalbeard in **The LEGO Movie** has at least two of these mounted on his left arm. Note that these are **literal** powder-and-cannonball-based cannons.

Arm Cannon Example in Films — Live-Action

-   The aliens in **Battle: Los Angeles** have guns surgically attached to their arms, prompting the Marines to remark that they are **committed** to their cause.
-   In **Cowboys & Aliens**, The main character steals one in his escape from the Aliens, and the only thing that has a chance of damaging the Aliens.
    -   Interestingly, no one else tries to do the same.
-   In **Desperado**, El Mariachi has cut-down semi-automatic pistols hidden in his sleeves, spring-loaded to jump into his hands.
-   **Marvel Cinematic Universe**:
    -   All of Tony Stark's Iron Man armors except the Mark 2 have some version of an Arm Cannon:
        -   In **Iron Man**, the Mark 1 suit has flamethrowers in both arms and a rocket launcher in the left forearm.
        -   The Mark 3 suit Tony uses against the Ten Rings at Gulmira has an antitank rocket launcher in the right forearm.
        -   The Mark 6 used in the climax of **Iron Man 2** adds powerful one-shot laser emitters in both forearms.
        -   The Mark 7 he uses in the final battle of **The Avengers (2012)** has a newer laser design, in which the lasers are re-usable.
    -   Obadiah Stane's Iron Monger suit, also from **Iron Man**, has a huge Gatling gun on the right arm and a rotary grenade launcher on the left arm.
    -   In **Captain America: Civil War**, the Mark II War Machine armor worn by Rhodey has a gun in the right arm and a missile launcher in the left, plus a sonic cannon in the right wrist area which can severely disorient any human or humanoid.
-   James Bond gets one in **Moonraker**. It's easily concealed and fires darts tipped with either poison or explosives.
-   On **Pandorum** Bower's concussion energy riot gun is mounted on a slip-on gauntlet with a small handle to fire (and charge up) the device. Word of God is that the weapon's design became necessary because of the large amount of time that the characters are running and doing Le Parkour, and thus required both of Bower's hands to remain free.
-   The Predator has a wrist-mounted launcher that can shoot out small, piercing ordinance, such as pincers, needles, or forked blades. Also of note is the shoulder-mounted plasma gun.
-   The 1982 film **The Soldier** features a scene in which a character has a sawed-off shotgun strapped to his arm and hidden by his sleeve. When stopped by a policeman or security guard and asked to put his hands up, he complies... and uses the gun to shoot the guard in the chest.
-   **Star Wars**
    -   Super Battle Droids from the prequel trilogy, of course. Their right wrists are equipped with a blaster and a small-caliber rocket launcher.
    -   Both Jango and Boba Fett. Jango in **Attack of the Clones** has a flamethrower on his arm. Boba uses a wrist blaster during the sail barge battle in **Return of the Jedi**.
-   In **X-Men: Days of Future Past**, the Prototype Sentinels have a wrist-mounted Gatling gun.

Arm Cannon Example in Literature

-   In **Armor**, **Warrior**\-class Powered Armor has a Blazer rifle built into each bracer. **Scout** suits have to make do with rifles, though.
-   **Arrivals from the Dark**: One of the weapons used by the titular **Fighters of Danwait**, is a fingerless glove that has various weapons "attached" to each finger. One of the most prominent weapons is the freezer, which creates a short-lived miniature black hole at the designated point, causing the temperature in the immediate vicinity to be dropped nearly instantly to extremely low levels (hence the name). For bonus points, there is also a rapid-fire version of the weapon.
    -   A character in the book had previously lost an arm in a war, so he replaced it with a prosthetic that has these weapons built into it, making this an example of the first case.
-   The Pyrrans in Harry Harrison's **Deathworld** are born into the losing side of a technology-vs-biology conflict that has an entire planet forcibly mutating to attack them. They train, from about the time they're old enough to walk, with forearm-mounted holsters which automatically slap a pistol into the wearer's hand when he or she positions the fingers for gripping the pistol's butt. If the fingers aren't crooked just right, the trigger finger may touch the trigger before the firer intends, which will cause problems if he or she didn't mean to shoot just yet. These are large-caliber pistols using live explosive rounds, making them exemplars not only of arm-cannons, but several other kinds of insanity as well.
-   The marines' battle suits in **Invasion of Kzarch** have wrist energy guns built in.
-   In Steve Perry's **Matador Series**, the signature weapon of the Matadors (and Emile Khadaji, who inspired them) is the spetsdöd. It's a dart gun mounted on the back of the hand, and fired by extending your index finger and touching the barrel. All you have to do to shoot something is point at it. The darts are tiny, and thus technically nonlethal, but they can be loaded with nearly any sort of drug or poison.
-   One of the first appearances of cybermancy in **Shadowrun** was when three "Hellions" — heavily modified cyborgs — appeared in one of the novels. Each had a triple-barreled machine gun incorporated into one arm.
    -   The Hellions appeared in "Never Trust an Elf".
-   **Spectral Shadows** has Princess Electra in Serial 2, who pretty much is a Mega Man type character, if only an animal character instead of a human.
-   One of the weapons used in the **Death Zone** novels set in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. universe is the armgun — a powerful laser emitter mounted on the forearm. At full power, it can slice a staltech in half.
-   **The Murderbot Diaries**: The titular Artificial Human Cyborg has small Energy Weapons concealed in its forearms, though it prefers bigger guns for serious combat situations. The ports are a giveaway to its status when it's in a Human Disguise, but can be hidden by any long-sleeved shirt.
-   In **Underdogs**, some of the clones have biorifles built into their arms. When the clone dies, the weapon also dies, meaning the Underdogs can't steal it.

Arm Cannon Example in Live-Action TV

-   **Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future**
    -   Soaron and Blastarr from have arm-mounted Digitizers attached to their forearms; they slide over their fist and lock into position when used to digitize a hapless human victim. Blastarr also has cannons on his fingertips.
    -   Additionally, Hawk from the Future Force has a miniature rocket launcher mounted on top of his arm. It fires tiny but devastating missiles.
-   **Doctor Who**: Several new-series versions of the Cybermen have these:
    -   The Alternate Universe Cybus Cybermen have laser guns that pop out of their arms.
    -   Later on, the version of the Cybermen introduced late in the Eleventh Doctor's run also have guns that pop out of their arms.
-   One of the perks of being a Protector in **Earth: Final Conflict** is getting your very own **organic** arm cannon.
-   The Tavleks mercenaries in **Farscape** are armed with a gauntlet that can fire energy blasts, create force-fields, and inject the wielder with a powerful stimulant. Unfortunately, though the stimulant enhances strength and speed, it also has a nasty habit of giving new users delusions of grandeur. The good news is that knocking the wearer out automatically detaches the gauntlet, thus making sure that they can be disarmed without being disarmed.
-   The Interceptor in **Interceptor** had his zapper mounted to his left sleeve.
-   **Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers**: Rito Revolto had a flamethrower that mounted like a glove over his left hand. It was only used in his battles against the Ninja Megazord (the second of which was a recyc of part of the first).
-   **The Mandalorian**: The title character has a flamethrower (which doesn't do much good) in one gauntlet and the other launches needle-sized homing missiles of Mandalorian design called "whistling birds".
-   **Laserblast** as seen on **Mystery Science Theater 3000**.
-   The Kull Warriors from **Stargate SG-1** have an energy weapon mounted on both arms, which is essentially a miniature, rapid-fire staff weapon.
-   Season 3 of **Star Trek: Discovery** features a twist in that the arm cannons manifest when their users want them do; otherwise, they're simply not there.

---
Arm Cannon Example in Tabletop Games

-   Some **BattleTech** BattleMechs do this as well, mounting one or more weapons atop or on the outer edge of the forearm. Early examples from the franchise include the **Shadow Hawk** and **Thunderbolt**, which feature some of the largest gunbarrels relative to their size, while the contemporaneous **Phoenix Hawk** featured smaller weapons in double mounts on the forearms to complement its large laser rifle. Perhaps most impressive is the **Thunder Hawk,** featuring cannon barrels so grotesquely massive that they actually constitute a larger percentage of the left arm than the rest of the arm itself.
-   In **Crucible: Conquest of the Final Realm**, a fantasy warfare game from FASA that took influence from **Warhammer Fantasy** and **Warcraft 3**, had the Infernal Elves faction have archers who use "capu bows" which are arm-mounted shortbows. The archers use these as the volcano that they live in is too cramped for regular crossbows or longbows and the capu bow can fire quicker than either of those two weapons.
-   Games Workshop games:
    -   **Warhammer 40,000**:
        -   Astartes Terminators have the options of taking arm-mounted cannons of one kind or another, with one of the most iconic being the assault cannon.
        -   A number of Space Marine/Chaos Marine heroes have guns mounted on their arms - these include Roboute Guilliman's Hand of Dominion (power fist with heavy bolter), Marneus Calgar's Gauntlets of Ultramar (power fists with bolters on them), Pedro Kantor's Dorn's Arrow (wrist-mounted storm bolter), Huron Blackheart's Tyrant Fist (power fist with heavy flamer), Abaddon the Despoiler's Talon of Horus (lightning claw with stormbolter mounted on it) and etc..
        -   Tau Crisis Battlesuits have weapon hardpoints on the back of their arms, as well as their shoulders, that mount the suit's advanced weaponry.
    -   **Dark Heresy** allows an upgrade for pistols called Forearm weapon mountings.
    -   The majority of ranged weaponry fitted to the highly advanced Spyrer suits during the 1st and 2nd Edition of **Necromunda** were positioned on the wrists or back of the hand. This position kept the Spyrer hunter's hands free to use the suit's integrated close combat weaponry.
-   HITMarks from **Mage: The Ascension**, while more commonly shown using the gatling guns stored in their backs, do have machine guns in their arms as well.
-   Both the first and second kind of Arm Cannon are available in **Rifts**. The rulebook specifically points out the difficulties of the Type One Arm Cannon, but justifies it by pointing out that hands are tricky to get right, and Rifts is set in a (borderline) Scavenger World.
-   **Shadowrun** offers up this variety as well.
-   The **Transhuman Space** setting features a realistic version in the form of "weapon pods"; forearm-mounted modules, usually with two different guns integrated into them. (In fact, these appear in the game because one or two discussions of possible future infantry equipment at the time of its publication actually included the idea.)

Arm Cannon Example in Video Games

-   **Assassin's Creed**:
    -   In **Assassin's Creed II**, Leonardo da Vinci builds a pistol modification into Ezio's hidden blade gauntlet quite late into the game. Maybe you would expect that it allows for some stealth, until the sound it makes almost makes you think that they're making a fireworks missile explode right next to your ear. It does One-Hit Kill everyone, though, even the Brutes. The POPE, and Cesare are both Immune to Bullets. This is strange since the first is an old man in robes, and the other is a whiny 20 year old in light armor (stops "two-handed" claymore swords too...).
    -   **Assassin's Creed: Unity** has the Phantom Blade, an attachment to the Hidden Blade that silently launches blades from a distance. It's essentially a silent version of Ezio's arm-mounted pistol.
-   **Batman Doom**: By necessity—**Doom**'s firearm weapons need to be somehow translated into Batman terms, after all—most of Batman's ranged weapons in this mod are gun-like weapons, set in glove-like frames worn on Batman's arm. They include the Blastguns and Azrael's Glove (both of which fire some unspecified kind of "shells"), the Shuriken Glove (a rapid-fire weapon which oddly enough uses Batarangs as ammo), and the Flamethrower which is, well, exactly, what you'd expect.
-   Robo-Manus from **Battletoads** is often shown with a pair of arm cannons mounted on his forearms in his character artwork. Downplayed in that he only actually uses them in the Gameboy sequel, while the other games depict him using a hand-held blaster, eye lasers or a variety of other weapons.
-   **Bayonetta 2**: The game's release on Wii U made references to other Nintendo franchises quite inevitable. Among the unlockable costumes available is Samus Aran's Power Suit. When she uses her basic gun attack, the suit's arm transforms into the familiar arm cannon. It uses the classic sound effects from **Super Metroid**, and comes complete with a powerful Charge Shot that's almost as strong as one of Bayonetta's own Wicked Weave attacks.
-   Subject Delta from **BioShock 2** has all his guns bolted to a plate on the back of his right hand.
-   **Blaseball** saw a player called Axel Trololol receive a Literal Arm Cannon. It is unclear whether this actually replaced their arm, but given that later players were able to receive and and drop items of the Cannon type, it's **probably** just carried.
-   **Bloodborne** features the Cannon, which is literally a cannon strapped on to the left arm. The **Old Hunters** DLC also threw in the Church Cannon, which is inferior to the Cannon when it comes to raw power but compensates by requiring less Quicksilver Bullets per shot and having an infinite reach (as opposed to the regular Cannon, which's projectiles blow up after a few meters) with cannonballs that arch, making it the best "sniper" weapon in the game... That said, the Cannons are both still Awesome, but Impractical due to their high stat requirements and ammo costs.
-   In **Borderlands 2**, Handsome Jack uses wrist-mounted laser cannons that are disguised as watches. In The Pre-Sequel, he uses larger arm-mounted blasters. His playable body double in that game can be specced so that he also has access to the blasters.
-   **Cyberpunk 2077** lets players install a Projectile Launch System, a small-scale grenade launcher concealed in their left arm.
-   The Majestic XII Commandos from **Deus Ex** have some sort of devices built into the arms of their suits that packs the capabilities of pretty much all the normal weapons in the game (assault rifle, sniper rifle, flamethrower, rocket launcher). To fire, they level their arms at their target while clenching their fists.
    -   Not quite a gun, but JC's minicrossbow is attached to his arm.
    -   **Deus Ex: Human Revolution** has a boss character with a minigun arm. Coincidentally, his name is Barret.
    -   In **Deus Ex: Mankind Divided**, Adam Jensen has been upgraded with an arm that transforms into a gun as well as the ability to launch his nanoblades as projectiles.
-   In the Daud DLC of **Dishonored**, Daud has a wrist-mounted crossbow as one of his ranged weapons. As well as functioning like the crossbow in the main game, it's capable of extending the bolt to pierce necks for stealth kills, similar to the Hidden Blade of **Assassin's Creed**.
-   Max from **Doom Troopers** has twin fireball-shooting bracers as secondary weapons.
-   The bull enemies from **Dusty Revenge** and **Dusty Raging Fist** has gatling cannons mounted to their arms. Reddo, a King Mook version of the bulls in the first game, has one as well which is modified to shoot exploding projectiles.
-   The Artificer in **Dungeons & Dragons Online** has a weapon called the Rune Arm which is essentially a Magitek Arm Cannon.
-   In **Evolve**, Hyde's flamethrower and Lennox's autocannon are both mounted to their user's forearm.
-   Rinoa Heartilly from **Final Fantasy VIII** has a weapon called "Blaster Edge" on her arm, which can launch a variety of disc-like projectiles in a boomerang trajectory. In her Limit Break "Angelo Cannon", she can shoot **her dog** like this. (No, not that way. This way.)
-   Gaius van Baelsar from **Final Fantasy XIV** had a cannon, called the Hand of the Empire, built into the armor of his left arm. It fires blue firy blasts which are likely ceruleum, the fuel of choice for Garlean equipment.
-   Shermans from **Fracture** have had one of their arms replaced by a bio-engineered grenade launcher.
-   In **Front Mission** (SNES) and its later PlayStation remake (and the Nintendo DS port of that) named **Front Mission 1st**, at least one of the early game arm parts has an integral machine gun; it's strong, has good accuracy for the early game and can save you money due to not having to buy a separate machine gun for a regular arm. Its only downsides are the inability to unequip, the weight, and those of a machine gun (as a Short range weapon its priority is higher than Melee weapons but lower than Long range weapons, and between Short range weapons its priority is less than a Rifle which only shoots once per attack).
-   Hunters/Mgalekgolo from the **Halo** franchise have arm-mounted Fuel-Rod Cannons or beam cannon projectors.
-   **MDK2**: Kurt Hectic's helmet is his main weapon, working as a Sniper Rifle when on his face and a rapid fire chaingun when attached to his arm.
-   **Monster Hunter: World** introduces the Slinger, an arm-mounted crossbow, to the hunter's arsenal. It can accept a wide variety of ammunition including rocks, nuts, throwing knives, and broken pieces of monster hide.
-   In **Perfect Dark**, the Laser and the Crossbow are wrist-mounted.
-   All of the MAX Suits in **PlanetSide 1** utilize this. The Terran Republic has a gun fitted onto each arm behind the gloves, whereas the New Conglomerate and Vanu Sovereignty has a single big gun on the right arm instead of hands. **Planetside 2** has the New Conglomerate using this as well for their (now akimbo) cannons, while the Vanu Sovereignty MAX shifts to carrying a large cannon in each hand.
-   **Pokémon**:
    -   In **Pokémon X and Y**, Blastoise gains small cannons on its arms, along with a giant one on its back, with its Mega Evolution.
    -   **Pokémon Scarlet and Violet** has a variation. The Scarlet-exclusive Armarouge, a Fire/Psychic knight Pokémon with giant pauldrons (medieval shoulder armor) on its shoulders, can move its pauldrons to its hands and put them together to form a cannon, which it then uses to fire projectiles. This is exemplified through its signature move, Armor Cannon, which lowers Defense and Sp. Defense when used.
-   An independent game company called Dahku announced a project called "Prism Queen"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>, which is also the name of the planned player character, who has a very Mega Man-inspired design, although, unlike Mega Man, Prism Queen appears to use this of arm cannon.
-   Madogears from **Ragnarok Online** have these, including a cannon, a flamethrower, a Freeze Ray, and a minigun.
-   Colonel Daren from **Red Dead Revolver** has an arm cannon after certain events in the beginning of the game.
-   **Remnant: From the Ashes** has the boss Bruudvak the Rider who, in addition to his spear on a long chain, uses a crude arm-mounted Magitek weapon that fires cold and flame projectiles. Depending on how you defeat Bruudvak and his mount Vargr the Worg, you could gain material that lets you make the Alternator, a primitive Magitek rifle with similar powers to Bruudvak's armcannon.
-   Slipskulls in **Resistance: Fall of Man** have their guns mounted to their arms with metal bands. When you find a pair of their weapons lying around in the New Game + , you just use them like regular machine pistols, though.
-   **Six-Guns: Gang Showdown**, outside of Death's sniper rifle: The Inevitable End, firearms that are armcannons in style are the most powerful ranged weapons in the game as they are the Clock Punk technology weapons of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. War has the Mayhem Gauntlet which is a high-temperature machine gun that fits over an arm brace, Madness has Sanity's Demise which is a shuriken launcher on a similar brace and finally Pestilence has the Contagion Crossbow which is an Automatic Crossbow firing poisoned bolts that likewise goes over the forearm.
-   Firebats from **StarCraft** have twin, wrist-mounted flamethrowers. This continues on in the **StarCraft II** unit, the Marauder, who has twin grenade launchers for arms. It's a giant Mini-Mecha/Powered Armor suit, though, so he can still take it off. The new Firebat has the same design as well.
-   The Alt Eisen and Weiss Ritter in **Super Robot Wars** both have guns mounted on their left arms.
    -   This comes from being based on the Gespenst, since every type of Gespenst has three barrels mounted on their right arm. Strangely, only three variants have built-in arm weapons: the Weiss Ritter and Alt Eisen's guns, and the Gespenst II M, which makes use of the barrels as a close range weapon. Which makes someone wonder why the other types have those barrels but no weapon build in to use them.
        -   On the older Gespensts (**and** the MK II M), those are apparently the hilts of their Beam Sabers. The MK II M's are designed to be able to do the Jet Magnum attack.
-   Tytree in **Tales of Rebirth** fights with his fists and a crossbow attached to one of his arms. For one of his dual hi-ougis, the crossbow turns into a BFG.
-   **Warframe** has a few examples:
    -   As the resident gunslinger Warframe, Mesa has a pair of pistols known as the Regulators attached to her wrists for use with her ultimate power, Peacemaker. Her thumbs serve as the firing pins. When not in use, they flip around to stay out of the way.
    -   The Gammacor is a wrist-mounted laser originally designed for mineral analysis. Its upgraded counterpart, the Synoid Gammacor, comes with Cephalon Suda's Entropy effect baked in.
    -   The Atomos is an experimental heat-based arm-mounted laser of Grineer design.
    -   The Sonicor is a wrist-mounted crossbow that fires off blasts that ragdolls the enemies.
-   **WildStar**'s Warriors have a Power Sword and the "XL45 Hell Mitten," an arm-mounted device that acts as a cannon, a shield, a chainsaw, and many other deadly and practical devices.
-   In **World of Warcraft**, Grandmaster Engineers can attach hand-mounted rocket launchers to their gloves.
-   **XCOM**
    -   Sectoids of all types in **XCOM: Enemy Unknown** and **XCOM 2** have small plasma cannons mounted on their right forearm; in **EU**, it's the only weapon the regular Sectoid has, while more psi-capable variants (the Sectoid Commander in **EU**, and the regular Sectoid in **2**) tend to use it more as a Ranged Emergency Weapon when they know their psi abilities won't work. Stunning a Sectoid in **EU** nets you the cannon intact, and with proper research it can be adapted into a pretty powerful handgun for your own soldiers.
    -   In **XCOM 2**, you can mount a heavy weapon on the left forearm of EXO and WAR suits.

Arm Cannon Example in Webcomics

-   **The Cyantian Chronicles**: Cere, a cybernetically altered anthropomorphic kangaroo, has one built into her arm. But it's not too reliable.
-   Jordan Kennedy, the evil genius landlady from **Exploitation Now**, has a cybernetic left arm with a built-in plasma cannon.
-   In **Schlock Mercenary** book 13, Random Access Memorabilia, starting from this strip, the Toughs are using new suits of power armor where the guns look like the first type of arm cannon but are actually this. The way it works is that the gun's trigger and handle are encased in a protective shroud that completely encloses the shooter's hand protecting it from any harm. Later, a savvy enemy bypasses this protection by just ripping off a soldier's entire arm.

Arm Cannon Example in Web Original

-   Rob from the web fiction serial **Dimension Heroes** sports a Mega Man-esque blaster on his right hand when in Guardian form.
-   Yang from **RWBY** wields a set of arm-mounted shotgauntlets that fire shells full of "burn dust" and use recoil to strengthen punches.

---
Arm Cannon Example in Western Animation

-   Modo, of the **Biker Mice from Mars**, has an energy blaster built into the forearm of his mechanical right arm. It extends and retracts in a manner similar to the **Gargoyles** examples below.
-   Buzz Lightyear, of **Toy Story** and **Buzz Lightyear of Star Command** fame, has a laser built into the wrist of his suit — at least on the latter where it's standard-issue; on the former it's "a little lightbulb that blinks".
    -   His team in the latter had them as well, except for XR, had neither this, nor the other version, but had a much larger arsenal, part and parcel with being a robot. The wrist-mounted laser seems to be part and parcel of the standard issue Star Command combat suit.
    -   Warp Darkmatter is somewhere between this and and his arm being the cannon. Normally, he has a robotic claw hand at the end of his artificial right arm, though it has been switched out with a laser cannon and a flamethrower.
-   Unlike the original, the version of Mega Man seen in **Captain N: The Game Master** has this type of arm cannon.
-   Odd from **Code Lyoko**, in his Lyoko Avatar, fires "Lazer Arrows" from his wrists.
-   The Mooks in **Dragon Flyz** use these.
-   Every robot or cyborg character on **Gargoyles** has a retractable particle beam gun in its forearm, with an almost identical extend/retract mechanism. Sensible, since all of them were evolved from designs stolen from Cyberbiotics by Xanatos, and it's hard to reinvent the wheel when you didn't invent it in the first place.
-   Deadshot from **Batman: Gotham Knight**... complete with **dakka**.
-   Teela has a wrist-mounted laser in **He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983)**. In the 2002 reboot, Man-At-Arms wears a big cannon on his forearm sometimes.
-   Kuvira's colossus in **The Legend of Korra** is rocking one for sure.
-   Wildwing in **Mighty Ducks: The Animated Series** has an "explosive puck" launcher (effectively a grenade launcher) mounted on his right gauntlet.
-   Air Enforcer and Noxious from **Skysurfer Strike Force**.
-   **Steven Universe**: When Peridot was first introduced, she had her limb enhancers. The arm attachments could fire blasts of energy if her fingers were positioned a certain way. Amethyst destroyed the arm cannon, along with the rest of Peridot's limb enhancers, when her physical form was destroyed in "Catch and Release".
-   Megatron has a very big, very intimidating gun attached to his right arm in **Transformers: Generation 1**, **Transformers: Animated**, and **Transformers: Prime**. The **Beast Wars** version had his dino-head take the place of one arm, and serve as the cannon (as did the tail that became his arm when he went Transmetal.) Oddly, when in beast mode, he **couldn't** fire energy bolts from his mouth.
    -   This is good for Megatron in Prime, even if it's not yet been used as a story point; given that without a T-Cog most bots can't use their guns, he's got an advantage should he ever lose his.
    -   Hilariously spoofed here
    -   So do lots of other **Transformers** in varying sizes.
    -   **Animated** Swindle actually has a BFG that he attaches to his wrist like Megatron, and a pair of retractable cannons **on each arm**. This is in addition to his over-the-shoulder lasers, and the gatling gun coming out of his chest.
    -   Starscream plays this a bit differently by having his null rays mounted on his upper arms rather than his forearms. Naturally, all the other Seekers mount their own weapons in the same way.
