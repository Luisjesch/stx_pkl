Big, Thin, Short Trio: 
_Boggis, Bunce and Bean  
One fat, one short, one lean  
Those horrible crooks  
So different in looks  
Were nonetheless equally mean_

Usually a Power Trio of secondary characters, if there are three of them, chances are that one will be large and/or fat, one will be skinny, and one will be short. The big one will generally be good-natured, the short one will generally be grumpy, while the thin one generally remains as a middle ground between the two.

The tall, thin guy will usually be the leader, the short one will be the brains (unless he's The Napoleon), and the big guy will be the right-hand or the brawn. Compare Beauty, Brains, and Brawn, and Nice Mean And In Between.

Sister Trope to Fat and Skinny and Big Guy, Little Guy. Compare with Terrible Trio, which is usually composed of two "skinny" members (one male, one female) and one "short" one.

Fitting with the trope description, Ape Admin/Gori is generally good-natured, Eaglette/Washimi is The Stoic, and Retsuko... well, let's just say they call it **Aggressive** Retsuko for a reason.
-   The three boys in the "Detective Boys" in **Case Closed**. Genta is Big, Mitsuhiko is Thin, Conan is Short.
-   Arguably, the three sister goddesses, Urd, Belldandy, and Skuld, from **Ah! My Goddess!** Skuld is short, Belldandy is skinny, and while Urd is only slightly taller than Belldandy, she has a **much** more voluptuous figure.
-   Somewhat averted in **R.O.D the TV**: Michelle is buxom and bubbly, Maggie is quiet and thin, and Anita is small, young, and grumpy.

    -   Kurita, Hiruma, and Sena.
    -   Yamabushi, Unsui/Agon, and Ikkyu to an extent.
-   **Yu-Gi-Oh!**'s Zygor, Sid, and Bonz definitely qualify for this.
-   Jose (big), Placido (skinny) and Lucciano (short) from **Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds**. Although the usual personalities for the short and big ones are inverted here as Jose is the grumpy one, and sort of good-natured Lucciano.
-   Foxy (short), Porche (skinny) and Hamburg (big) from **One Piece**. Foxy isn't that much shorter than Porche, but he is still about the height of Luffy, which makes him VERY short for a grown-up male (Porche is female) **One Piece** character.
    -   The 3 Captains: Eustass Kidd (big & muscular), Trafalgar Law (lean) and Monkey D. Luffy (short..even shorter after he used his Gear)

-   In **Doraemon**, the human boys in the main cast (Doraemon, Nobita, Shizuka, Gian, and Suneo) form a trio like this, with Gian being the big one, Nobita being the thin one, and Suneo being the short one.

    -   Whenever a Terrible Trio appears in one of the non-canon movies, it's all but a guarantee they'll take this trope's form as well.
        -   **Dead Zone** downplays it; while Nicky is fairly thin, Sansho is only slightly buffer than the others, and Ginger is just a bit shorter.
        -   **Lord Slug** exaggerates it with the titular villain's main henchmen; Angira is a Long-Haired Pretty Boy who can stretch his arms like rubber, Dorodabo is a Fat Bastard who's wider than he is tall, and Medamatcha is a Depraved Dwarf who can create even smaller clones of himself.
        -   Cooler's Armored Squadron from **Cooler's Revenge** have it as well; Doore is a musclebound brawler, Neiz is a gangly freak, and Sauza is a short Pretty Boy.
