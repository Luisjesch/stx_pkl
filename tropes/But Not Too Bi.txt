But Not Too Bi: 
When a character's bisexuality is an Informed Attribute rather than something we ever see portrayed.

Alice is stated or implied to be bisexual, gets flirty with both genders, and/or it's confirmed by the writers, but within the story itself, all of her romantic and sexual partners are men. As one can guess, it is often the character's same-sex attraction that gets shafted, limited to only Noodle Incidents, subtext, and innuendos. This could be an attempt at appeasing Moral Guardians, especially in older works or those aimed at young viewers, but many will note the Double Standard. Sometimes, it might even go the other way if the work is aimed at queer audiences; the character may officially be bi- or pansexual in the name of inclusivity, but the story is focused on a same-sex romance.

**Before adding examples,** it is not this trope if a character has onscreen relations with multiple genders, but seems to be more attracted to one than the other. It's not uncommon for a bisexual to have a gender preference and only be with the other one under the right circumstances, which can range from casual sex to If It's You, It's Okay.

If the character _has_ relationships with the same gender but they're portrayed as more tame than with the opposite, that would fall under But Not Too Gay, as the relationship itself is being portrayed poorly rather than the character(s). See also: No Bisexuals, Hide Your Lesbians. Related to Have I Mentioned I Am Gay?, and many of the tropes on Acceptable Feminine Goals and Traits.

## Examples

But Not Too Bi Example in Anime and Manga

-   **Ai Kora**: Haiji will love anyone whom he considers pure, but he's only shown showing interest in Hachibei, and entirely Played for Laughs at that, what with all the Stupid Sexy Flanders moments he causes Hachibei. Subverted later on in a way, as he randomly starts developing feelings for Ayame, but since Status Quo Is God it doesn't stick for long and he's back to loving Hachibei soon.
-   In **Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba**, the 2nd Databook states that Suma is bisexual, considering she is also revealed to be Tengen original's wife after winning against her older sister by crashing her marriage interview with Tengen, that comes in handy with she being very accepting of Hinatsuru and Makio being married off to Tengen as well, but other than that offhand revelation in a side-material Suma in the series proper is only shown to love her husband Tengen just like her companion wives do.
-   Nene from **Hyakko** says she's bi, but she only shows interest in girls. Since it's a comedy Slice of Life aimed at men, this is probably intentional. In later chapters, she finally hits on a guy, Torako's looks-like-a-Japanese-Delinquent friend — or is just being her normal Lovable Sex Maniac self, as her idea of hitting on him is to ask how big his penis is since he's really tall.

But Not Too Bi Example in Comic Books

-   Deadpool is pansexual by Word of Gay (and in more recent years, actually seen flirting with men in the comics) but has only been seen actually sleeping with women. In addition, his relationships with women are treated as "real" while any interest in men is only ever Played for Laughs.
-   The titular character in **The Incredible Hercules** has no qualms discussing various paramours of any gender; he doesn't shy away from talking about his homosexual encounters during the time of Greek myth, and it's strongly hinted at his funeral that he had a fling with Northstar, Marvel's first gay hero. However, all his confirmed lovers in the present day were exclusively women. This was finally averted in **Guardians of the Galaxy (2020)**, fifty-five years after the character's first appearance, when he begins a relationship with Noh-Varr.
-   **Wonder Woman**: Despite confirmed/assumed by several writers to be bisexual, her supposed queerness is never explicitly shown or elaborated upon besides some (implied) dialogue and all of her onscreen romantic relationships are with men (like Steve Trevor, Batman, and Superman). DC Comics themselves have been largely silent on the subject and if questioned about it is all talk and no action; it's primarily used as positive PR.

But Not Too Bi Example in Fan Works

-   In **My Immortal**, most of the guy characters are said to be bi (perhaps for Yaoi Fangirls), yet the only evidence actually supporting this is that Harry (er, "Vampire") once dated Draco in the offscreen backstory. The same thing can be said for Ebony herself.
-   Klavier Gavin in **Dirty Sympathy.** In the offscreen backstory, he had slept with groupies often enough that he can use them as an excuse but both of his romantic relationships have been with men. It's noted In-Universe when Daryan figures out that Klavier is cheating on him when he hasn't slept with a woman in months.
-   Kurogane says that he slept only with women in Suwa offscreen, but in the story **Shatterheart** he has subtext with Fai and a romantic/sexual relationship with R!Syaoran. According to Souma, his longest romantic entanglement lasted twelve hours.
-   Word of God is Cassandra in **Angel of the Bat** does not see gender in her romantic interests, just personality, so in theory, she can be attracted to someone of either gender. We only see her romantically interested in other women.
    -   Played with in the sequel. In the midst of a crisis of her faith and sexuality, she figures if she can have a relationship with a man it will effectively Cure The Gay. Her attempt to have a relationship with a man ends poorly... but because she hasn't gotten over her break up, not because of his gender.
-   **Everyone Loves Mob**: Mob (female) is bisexual but ends up in serious relationships with guys only.
-   Jon Whitewolf from **A Dovahkiin Spreads His Wings** mentions he made **friends** from both genders. However, his romances with Sapphire and Serana are given depths and treated as a means for him to grow as a person, while his one-night-stand with Sanguine is Played for Laughs and viewed as embarrassing for him.
-   Izumi Midoriya in **My Hero Academia: Mechanical green**. Izumi is officially bisexual, the fic even having the tag "Bisexual Disaster Midoriya Izuku". However, all of her significant romantic moments so far have been with other women, making her come across as homosexual. This is justified in that, when she was younger, she had thought she was heterosexual and tried asking Katsuki out on a date, but was met with an explosion to the face for her trouble, which in turn caused all the guys at Aldera to follow his lead and attack her if she tried asking them out, causing her further trauma. She later realized she was bisexual, and had been hiding that fact from others out of fear she'd be rejected by women too, and only started expressing interest in them after the girls of 1-A managed to get her to lower her emotional walls. She later admits to herself that the trauma she's still suffering all but killed any attraction she had towards men.

But Not Too Bi Example in Films — Live-Action

-   **Better Than Chocolate**: Carla flirts with Maggie and is established as bisexual (or omnisexual, in Maggie's opinion) pretty early on. Her only onscreen partner is Paul though.
-   Bud and Doyle in **Bio-Dome** are supposedly bisexual, even though they are only shown to be attracted to women and never hit on any male character save for a brief moment with each other. Which would be assuming that they weren't going for cheap laughs.
-   **Climax**: In spite of the fact that nearly Everyone Is Bi, the men never engage in homosexual encounters. This might not have been planned, however, since almost the entire film was improvised by the actors themselves.
-   **Crush**: AJ is identified as bisexual, but only shows attraction to Paige, another girl.
-   **Deadpool** and its sequel are the first superhero movies with a pansexual main character but, just like the comics, any allusions to his attraction for men is played for comedy while his relationship with his love interest Vanessa is explicit and played seriously. Ryan Reynolds mentioned the possibility of giving Deadpool a boyfriend in the second film, but ultimately this didn't happen.
-   **Fresh (2022)**: Mollie mentions that she prefers dating women to men, but has an ex-boyfriend whom she slightly regrets breaking up with, and is only really seen finding guys cute.
-   **Respire**: Sarah and Charlie discuss having sex with boys, but they also kiss each other, but are not shown admitting to any explicit attraction.
-   **Somebody I Used to Know**: It's revealed Cassidy's bisexual and has dated women in the past, but isn't shown as attracted to any presently as she's now marrying Sean.
-   **They/Them (2022)**: Veronica tells other people she's bisexual, though she only shows attraction to Kim, a Lipstick Lesbian whom she meets (of course, the guys in the film are mostly gay, so it's not surprising).
-   Valkyrie from **Thor: Ragnarok** is written as a bisexual mourning her lost girlfriend, but the flashback making it clear that they were lovers was cut from the final film, making her bisexuality limited to Word of Gay. This is seemingly rectified in **Thor: Love and Thunder** where she briefly flirts with one of Zeus' handmaids, but that just presents the other side of this trope: Val has never expressed any romantic or sexual interest in **men**, yet the writers insist she's bisexual and not a lesbian. It didn't help that her actress Tessa Thompson teased an arc for ''Love And Thunder'' where Valkyrie would find her "queen", while that arc never came to be in the movie.

But Not Too Bi Example in Literature

-   In as much as Dorian Gray's sexuality can be established, it falls under this, with his relationships with men being largely ambiguous or sexual while his relationship with Sybil is of a more traditional romantic sort. Enforced in that there wasn't much room for any other depiction at the time.
-   The titular **Haruhi Suzumiya** makes it very clear right from the start that she doesn't care about the gender of the one she is with, as long as they're not an ordinary human being. However, aside from her touchy-feely behavior towards Mikuru (which isn't treated seriously, as it's largely Played for Laughs and Fanservice), she doesn't really show any romantic interest in other girls, and it seems as though only boys have confessed to her.
-   Rolas for about ten years prior to the start of the **The Red Vixen Adventures**, due to his m/m relationship going down in the flames over an Anguished Declaration of Love.
-   Oberyn Martell of **A Song of Ice and Fire,** to some extent; he only has one lover throughout the course of the series, and it's entirely possible that it would be unsafe for him to bring a male lover to court. The only evidence we have of his other relationships is rumors and his bastard children, the latter of which couldn't come from his relationships with men. The TV show averts this, however, as Oberyn is shown getting it on with male prostitute Olyvar. Plus, he and his paramour Ellaria Sand specifically prefer sex workers that go both ways.
-   **The Stormlight Archive**: Shallan Davar has a few scenes that can be read as indicating same-sex attraction, and her "Veil" alternate personality is definitely attracted to women (though Veil is also shown to be interested in Kaladin), but Shallan is now married to Adolin Kholin and even Veil isn't going to go beyond flirting under such circumstances.
-   The author of **The Vampire Chronicles** had established that all of her vampires are bisexual, but none of the female vampires seems to have any interest in other women.
-   **Vorkosigan Saga**:
    -   Aral Vorkosigan has lovers of multiple genders in his backstory, but the only relationship depicted in-story is with Cordelia, whom he meets and falls in love with in the first novel. "Do you know your husband is bisexual? - He WAS bisexual. Now he's monogamous". Admittedly, given that his home is a very sexually conservative planet and that he is courting or married to Cordelia throughout the saga, there is little scope for him to believably display attraction to men. (Especially as most of the books are from the POV of his (straight) son.) An implied psycho-analytical explanation is that Aral was so oriented around the military that he was more attracted to soldiers than to women. Cordelia, as a woman soldier, was the solution to his dilemma. (It helped that he actually liked and respected her, too.)
    -   **Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen** focuses on Cordelia and Oliver Jole falling for one another; Jole had been Aral's boyfriend for 10 years, with Cordelia's full consent. It still counts somewhat for both Aral and Oliver, as the relationship is only revealed to the reader after Aral dies.
    -   Byerly Vorrutyer, despite his suggestive name, mannerisms, and confirmed promiscuity with both sexes for professional purposes, has only shown interest in women on the page.
-   **Hani and Ishu's Guide to Fake Dating**: Hani's bisexuality is a main theme of the story. Within it though, she's solely attracted to Ishu, her (initially fake) girlfriend. In the past, she only dated boys. It's even why Aisling is so skeptical that she's bisexual. However, this is deconstructed and justified because Hani had only recently come out, plus she's still a teenager. She's also (correctly) insistent that this does not in any way mean she isn't bisexual. Her dating Ishu is meant to "prove" she's bisexual earlier, before Hani realizes this is entirely unnecessary, then gets together for real with her.
-   **Just Juliet**: Lena is bisexual, though she's only with Juliet in the story.
-   **Zara Hossain Is Here**: Zara is a bisexual girl who has a committed relationship with her girlfriend Chloe. She's never shown or even mentioned to find any boy attractive.
-   In Gene Roddenberry's (cough cough) novelization of **Star Trek: The Motion Picture**, Kirk mentions that 'of course' he's had relationships with both men and women, but denies having a sexual relationship with Mr. Spock.
-   **Tales of Inthya**:
    -   **The Queen of Ieflaria**: Esofi reflects that, like most people, she's bisexual. In the book she only shows attraction to Adale, another woman, however.
    -   **Daughter of the Sun**: Orsina is bisexual, but only shows attraction to other women in the book.
-   **Reign of the Seven Spellblades**: In flashbacks and reminiscences, Chloe Halford was the apex of a Bisexual Love Triangle between at least two men and one woman. She ultimately settled down with Edgar Groves, but in volume 10 she mentions not having told her female suitor Esmeralda that she and Edgar had become a couple, not wanting her to think she never had a chance just because they were both women. Unfortunately, Esmeralda turned out to be a Psycho Lesbian Yandere and ultimately a conspirator in Chloe's murder in the series' first chapter.
-   **The Afterward**: Olsa is bisexual, though she's only attracted to Kalanthe during the book. Her bisexuality is only established by her saying it and once mentioning having had sex with a boy in the past.

But Not Too Bi Example in Live-Action TV

-   Anna from **Chuck** is bisexual, but hasn't seen any on-screen action with women.
-   **Constantine (2014)**: John Constantine. Despite being bi by Word of God, he's just seen vaguely flirting with Papa Midnite and is only ever shown hooking up with women. Averted once transplanted in **Legends of Tomorrow** where he kisses male agent Gary and a tragic relationship with a man is a critical plot point.
-   Jane from **Coupling** claims to be bisexual, though some claim it's just a bid for attention. Oliver calls her out on it in Season 4, showing her pictures from one of his magazines, which she immediately cringes away from.
-   In **Da Vinci's Demons**, the creators have stated that their Leonardo is bisexual. Unfortunately, this doesn't come across well on the show. He has a relationship with Lucretia that is a large part of the plot, has multiple graphic sex scenes, and it is suggested several times that he is in love with her despite her being an enemy spy, while his attraction to men is shown only by a couple of verbal references and one kiss with a man he only slept with once because he was "curious".
-   **Doctor Who** universe:
    -   River Song is confirmed bisexual by Word of God but she flirts with only two women (Liz 10 and a colleague in the library) in throwaway lines. She's more like Doctor-sexual.
    -   Clara Oswald has also been confirmed as bisexual but, again, her bisexuality is only implied with throwaway lines, though more than the Doctor and River, while the show spent much time with her UST with the Doctor in series 7 and her relationship with Danny in Series 8.
-   **Emerald City**: West is shown as attracted to women, and mentions her past involvement with Anna's mother. On the show she's only shown having sex with a man though.
-   **The Good Place**: Eleanor is pretty flirty with women as well as men, explicitly states attraction to Tahani and Janet, kisses a simulation of Simone on the lips, and was even confirmed bisexual by the creators. However, these instances were always Played for Laughs; in the actual series, she only ever had male love interests and male exes.
-   **Gossip Girl** has Chuck Bass who not only is seen almost exclusively with women, but the TV series seems to reduce his connections with men to flirting and kissing.
-   In **Halt and Catch Fire**, Joe MacMillan is bisexual, but the only two serious relationships we see him in are with women, his relationships with men happening in his backstory or during Time Skips.
-   Jane from **Happy Endings** has had past relationships with both men and women but she is married to a man and the one time she engages in any same-sex behavior, it's fanservice for her husband.
-   **Homicide: Life on the Street**: Bisexual Tim Bayliss is never shown with a boyfriend, despite having been stated to have had sex with at least one man. The closest we come is Tim being rejected by one black, closeted, uniformed officer, and going on a dinner date with a man who runs a mostly gay restaurant. It even takes the show a season to actually **use** the word bi(sexual); before that, Bayliss just says he's 'not strictly heterosexual'. As a counterpoint, Bayliss is shown to have had at least one girlfriend whom he had a full blown love scene with. He also had brief affairs/flirtations with at least three of his female co-workers (Cox, Ballard, Sheppard) and Claire Kincaid. Somewhat justified, though, in that Bayliss doesn't fully acknowledge his attraction to men until season 6, just one before the last- and by that point he doesn't strike up a serious romance with **anyone** for the remainder of the series.
-   Hope Mikaelson from **Legacies**. Her only canon love interest in the present has been male, and other than mentioning having a crush on Josie when she was fourteen (for a week) her attraction to women hasn't really been shown, despite promises of the contrary by Word of God and Word of Saint Paul.
-   **Lucifer (2016)** has the title character as being bisexual, with a preference for women. However, his attraction to men never gets more than an occasional nod, with Lucifer's attraction to men rarely, if ever, being shown as anything other than lip service.
-   **Neighbours** has had isssues with this:
    -   Donna Freedman unfortunately turned out like this. Having taken the brave step of having a bisexual character and acknowledging this in a subtle coming-out scene, the producers never explored her sexuality apart from a token peck on the lips with a female character.
    -   Stephanie Scully, after she returned in 2015, was only a slight improvement. While she was quickly revealed to be in a relationship with a woman, this quickly fell apart due to the woman being her former psychiatric nurse. Of her subsequent relationships, two serious ones were with male regular cast members and one very brief one was with a woman, which Steph ended because she didn't want to get between her and her family. For what it's worth, neither of her relationships with men went the distance either, and after she left in 2018 she was mentioned to have started a relationship with a woman.
-   **Nos4a 2**: Vic is bisexual, though she prefers men and she's only seen with guys.
-   Sarah Manning from **Orphan Black** has been confirmed to be bisexual via Word of God, but aside from having a drunken threesome with a woman and her boyfriend, she's only shown interest in men.
-   **Pandora**: Jax is revealed to have dated Cordelia, and Atria's been in a threesome with another woman. Both however show only attraction toward men otherwise, and the relationships presently each has are with them.
-   **Peacemaker (2022)**: Peacemaker is bisexual, which he's berated for by his homophobic Abusive Dad. On screen however, he only sleeps with and expresses interest in women, aside from a possible Prison Rape joke and a threesome with a woman and Vigilante that was Played for Laughs.
-   **Schitt's Creek**: David Rose identifies as pansexual and has a brief fling with Stevie in the first season, but after that all his onscreen love interests are male and he marries Patrick in the finale. There are occasional vague references to him being attracted to or being involved with women in his past, but they are few and far between and often Played for Laughs.
-   In **Skins**, Franky Fitzgerald says she's "into people" when asked which gender she prefers, but only shows **any** kind of interest in guys on the show (Mini's one-sided crush on her in S5 notwithstanding).
-   **Supernatural**: Castiel reveals that he’s always been in love with Dean, but only two minutes before he dies and is never seen again onscreen. Dean is also the only man Cas ever expresses attraction for, having only had female love interests up until his last moments.
-   **The Umbrella Academy**: Klaus is said to be pansexual by actor Robert Sheehan, but throughout the first season the only sex partners he mentions are men, and he fell in love with a man after accidentally time-travelling to the Vietnam War. In the second season when the whole family gets stuck in the early '60s, Klaus founds a cult (long story) and it's implied that he regularly had sex with his followers, including the women. However, he spends most of his onscreen time trying to reach out to the younger version of his Army boyfriend to talk him out of joining the army in the first place since he died in the war.
-   **Veronica Mars** has Lilly reveal that, in an alternate universe where she'd lived, she would've cheated on her college boyfriend with his ex-girlfriend. However, she was already murdered in a storyline that focused solely on how promiscuous she was.

But Not Too Bi Example in Music

-   "I Kissed a Boy", Cobra Starship's parody of "I Kissed a Girl" by Katy Perry, is rife with this trope. Whereas Katy's version is about harmless experimentation, Cobra Starship's is about making out with guys **only** to impress women, making it even more exploitative than the original was accused of being.
-   Parodied in "The College Try" by Garfunkel and Oates. The song is about a girl who **wants** to be bisexual, but when the time comes to actually have sex with another woman, she's completely turned off and realizes she's 100% straight after all.

---
But Not Too Bi Example in Theatre

-   **Hamilton**: Lin-Manuel Miranda has said via Word of God on Twitter that he believes there probably was something romantic between Alexander Hamilton and John Laurens (as has been speculated by many historians) and deliberately inserted some lines into the musical to reference that, but they're so subtle you wouldn't realise it unless you were already familiar with the theory; by contrast, the equally ambiguous relationship between Hamilton and his wife's sister Angelica Schuyler is centered so much she gets an entire song dedicated to their Unresolved Sexual Tension, and it's mentioned in several others. In addition, Miranda bolstered the interpretation with his acting in the original cast, being far more touchy with Anthony Ramos and looking into his eyes soulfully, but later actors have not followed his lead, sticking more to the script and treating Laurens more like just a close friend.
-   The **Mrs. Hawking** play series: Zigzagged with Justin Hawking. He is canonically bisexual, but in his first appearance in part III: **Base Instruments** he barely interacts with any man who isn't related to him. Apart from a brief flirtatious remark to Lord Seacourse ("Unless you'd like to join us, my lord?") he only has opportunities to demonstrate attraction to women.
    -   In **Gentlemen Never Tell**, however, the spinoff in which he stars, Justin demonstrates attraction to both a new woman, Rosaline, and an old boyfriend, Cassius, and his relationships with the two characters are central to the story.

But Not Too Bi Example in Video Games

-   **Bully** is known as a progressive Rockstar game for implementing a bisexual main character and having him addressed as such through the game. An issue here still stood, however; while the player could flirt and make out with both boys and girls, he could only hold hands with girls, and a few more of the perks only applied to girls. The player also exclusively has romantic involvements with girls in the story, though this could be because the boys that Jimmy is interested in take part as antagonists through their respective sections of the story.
-   In **Cyberpunk 2077**, male romance option Kerry is canonically bisexual, but can only be romanced by V if the player has their voice and body type set to male. There are some clues to point to him being bisexual (email exchange with his ex-wife on his laptop, female clothing strewn around his house, saying that he will introduce V to his old bandmates as his newest fling as a cover regardless of their gender), but all of this can be missed by a less inquiring player. In the "Temperance" ending call from romanced Kerry, he will talk about his two past relationships, both with men. In the original Polish script, V will ask "That's how you tag your exes?" after Kerry throws away his ringing phone in annoyance, using the masculine pronouns, implying that all his exes were men (though it's worth noting that Polish doesn't have a gender-neutral word for exes). Word of Gay confirmed that Kerry is bisexual like in the original tabletop game the video game is based on and is attracted to male V because he reminds him of Johnny.
    
    -   Johnny Silverhand, on the other hand, seems to be this but in the opposite direction. Both of his past partners were women and he only talks about having sex with female groupies. He has a lot of Ship Tease with V regardless of their gender but seems more jealous/possessive of a female V. The only clue towards his bisexuality is an ambient voiceline he says when he and V go to a gay strip club.
    
    Johnny: (...) Now and then I've swung both ways; the more the merrier.
    
-   Played with in **Dragon Age II**. Merrill and Fenris do not discuss their orientations with the PC at any point, save to express an interest in them—this allows some fans to insist that they're "player-sexual", being either straight or gay depending on what gender Hawke is. Anders plays with this trope: he was a flirt towards many women in **Awakening** and can obviously romance a female PC, in which he never actually states that he's bi, causing some players to feel that he's "really" straight. But romancing him as a male PC has him admit that he's bisexual, describe how important his romance with Karl was, and flirt with the male PC in a much more respectful manner, implying that he takes romances with men more seriously. The other two love interests, Isabella and Sebastian, are aversions. Isabella openly swings both ways, while Sebastian can **only** be romanced by a female PC.
-   **Fate/Grand Order**:
    -   You can change the protagonist's gender as many times as you want without any consequence, which leads to this trope in regards to the Servant interactions. While there are plenty of female Servants who openly lust for the protagonist regardless of their gender, most of the male Servants don't do the same, even the confirmed bisexuals like Iskander or Gilgamesh. The few overt examples of male Servants being even implicitly interested in the male version of the protagonist are Astolfo, who looks identical to a girl right down to the clothing, and Fergus, who makes it clear he is not interested in pursuing a relationship (but for Valentine's, he offers you the key to his bedroom).
    -   Queen Medb will supposedly sleep with anyone regardless of gender, and she mentions in her interlude that she has no problem charming women if she wants, but in-story she shows an overwhelming preference for men with no interest in other women (though Scáthach-Skaði might be the sole exception).
-   Some of the Homoerotic Subtext regarding Cloud's feelings towards Sephiroth in **Final Fantasy VII** was cut to tone it down (like a line where he ruminates on how, as a teenager, he thought about Sephiroth so much that his mother 'gave up on him' — putting a later flashback where his mother pleads with him to get a 'nice girlfriend' in a different light entirely). He does get a gay Did They or Didn't They? with a male prostitute, but it's played completely for laughs and he doesn't seem particularly into it (compare to the romantic and sincere Did They or Didn't They? scene he gets with Tifa). He flirts with Barret and can even go on a date with him if the player has him do it enough while offending the girls, but it's usually Gay Bravado and, on the date, Barret mostly acts confused that Cloud isn't more interested in the girls than in him.
-   **Fire Emblem Fates** has an interesting same-sex example with Soleil, who is supposedly bisexual but is only shown having any interest in other women. In fact, her defining characteristic is that she's a shameless flirt who loves talking up any pretty girl she meets. Despite this, she is unable to S support with the female Avatar, with her only romance options being the male characters. The English localization tones this down, by changing all but two of her S supports into declarations of deep friendship instead of love. Even of the two that remained romantic, only one has her wholly reciprocate the other person's feelings, that being the effeminate, crossdressing Forrest. The other, the male Avatar, has her explicitly state that she's bisexual with a preference for women, but is willing to see where a relationship with him will go.
-   Yuri from **Fire Emblem: Three Houses** is a notably egregious example as one of the reasons he was added in the first place was to help address the criticisms that the game was homophobic. Particularly towards gay and bisexual men as, pre-DLC, male Byleth had exactly one same-sex ending vs. over twenty straight ones (female Byleth had four). Despite being Camp Gay, Yuri has one romantic ending with another man, this being male Byleth again. His only other male ending is platonic, while all his endings with women are explicitly romantic. Though Yuri became a popular fan favorite even so, this is still a huge sore spot for fans of the game.
-   **Life Is Strange 2** came in for a little criticism for its two main romantic options for bisexual protagonist Sean. The different-sex romance route can end with Sean losing his virginity to Cassidy, and indeed the game actively encourages the player to do so, as well as making her romance scene unskippable. However, the same-sex romance route with Finn is easily locked off by earlier, seemingly unrelated dialogue choices and ends with a kiss at most even if Sean and Finn's relationship is maxed. Lightly Downplayed in that it's more a case of **Life Is Strange** always promoting the female love interest over the male (the other three main titles in the series feature bi women protagonists and also nudge the player towards the female romantic option to varying degrees<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>), but that doesn't really negate the use of this trope.
-   Mochi of **Lonely Wolf Treat** is exclusively shown to be interested in girls in-game. A page in the webcomic "Another Piece of Candy" reveals that she had a boyfriend before (which may or may not be canon) although their relationship didn't really go anywhere.
-   Seven from **Mystic Messenger** mentions in one of the art books that he's attracted to men and women, and some of his banter with Yoosung or Jumin can definitely be seen as flirtatious, but it's never addressed in-game beyond that, and you would only know he's bisexual from reading the aforementioned bonus material.
-   **Paladins**: Caspian is pansexual according to Word of Gay, but his art only shows him interacting with women, which is supposedly the fault of the people the art was outsourced to.
-   Kanji from **Persona 4** is a very confusing and hotly-debated case, in that he technically displays attraction to both men and women, but every possible example is rendered ambiguous by the story. Firstly, his main love interest is a Sweet Polly Oliver with an Ambiguous Gender Identity. Then there's the fact that his shadow — meant to represent repressed, socially inappropriate desires — is a Camp Gay Depraved Homosexual who repeatedly hits on the men of the party. But unlike other characters who actually admitted their shadows did reflect them, Kanji ends up saying that he was just worried that he wouldn't be accepted for his more feminine hobbies, suggesting that his shadow hit on guys because women were more judgmental of him, which apart from being unlikely also straight-up contradicts the rest of the game where Yukiko is by far the most accepting and Yosuke by far the **least**. After his shadow, his social link totally side-steps the sexuality issue altogether, and even his interest in Naoto after the gender reveal is explicitly stated to be at least in part an attempt to assert his heterosexuality (he insists on her presenting as female at one point while yelling "make me a man!" so it's not exactly subtle). And of course, nobody in the game ever suggests he could actually be bi. In all, this is a weird case where **either** his attraction to men **or** women could be discounted as fake or purely comedic — and rest assured that for every single possible interpretation of his sexuality, someone, somewhere, believes it passionately. Also, it's not just limited to Kanji - Chie, Yukiko, and Teddy all express some degree of ambiguous same-sex attraction as well, to the point where Kanji's first conclusion on hearing about the serial killer case is that it's motivated by hate against closeted people in the town, something that the rest of the investigation team shoots down as silly, despite the strong possibility at that point in the investigation that was indeed the case.
-   In **The Walking Dead: A New Frontier**, main player character Javier is bisexual (as confirmed by Word of God). However, his relationship with female romantic option Kate spans the whole season and is a major part of the plot, although optional, while the nominal Gay Option with Jesus is just a few lines of dialogue.

But Not Too Bi Example in Visual Novels

-   Monika from **Doki Doki Literature Club!**. During Act 3, she states that while she doesn't know the player character's gender, she doesn't really mind it at all. However, she refers to the player with the name that they chose at the beginning of the game, implying she is still projecting her affections onto the male avatar. She also refers to the player as her boyfriend in some lines of dialogue during Act 3 as well as singing "write the way into **his** heart" during the credits.

But Not Too Bi Example in Webcomics

-   Paulo from **Bittersweet Candy Bowl** starts as this. Despite having almost two chapters dedicated to exploring it, his bisexuality is rarely touched upon in the comic. While he does occasionally blush over a few boys and it's implied that he has a crush on Mike, his main romantic stories still mainly involve female love interests. Subverted as the years go on, since Paulo discovering and accepting he also likes boys becomes a big part of his character arc, and he's later given a chapter exclusively focused on the fact that he has a crush on one of his guy friends.
-   Zoe, protagonist of **Heroine Chic**, mentions that she dated girls in college, and there is an offhand reference to a female ex of hers at one point. But she never shows attraction to women in the comic, and all her relationship drama happens with male characters (including her flirting with/ dating/ breaking up with Daniel, booty-calling the superhero Valiant, and her crush on her roommate Laren's boyfriend Tom).
-   In **The Order of the Stick**, Haley's bisexuality is limited to a couple of throwaway gags related to her temporary Curse of Babel. When "telling a secret", she says she's kissed girls more than once, and when dealing with the facets of her personality, one of them is named Haley's Latent Bisexuality. Her sole onscreen love interest is Elan, who's male.
-   T-Bob in **Something\*Positive**. He self-identifies as a bisexual but is only seen dating or displaying an attraction to men, the only indication of him being interested in women was a throwaway reference to him coming onto a woman offscreen. And she turned him down.
-   Dimiti in **Spacetrawler** is ostensibly an Extreme Omnisexual who has made it his mission to sleep with any alien with more than 50% sexual compatibility. However, all of his companions so far are either explicitly female or have no mentioned sex, and he has only made passes at female human teammates. His sexual compatibility percentage with another male human has not been brought up.

But Not Too Bi Example in Web Video

-   **The Adventures of Jamie Watson and Sherlock Holmes**: Jamie is bisexual, but all of her love interests among the mostly-female cast are female characters.
-   In **Critical Role**, Scanlan maintains that he's interested in both men and women, but we only ever see him express interest in women.
-   **Out With Dad**: Vanessa realizes she's bisexual after having a mutual attraction for Rose. She's not actually shown as attracted to boys however really, and her only romantic interests on the show are girls.
-   **Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series** does this occasionally. Joey Wheeler (who was straight in the original), shows attraction to other guys (Kaiba, especially), but he and Mai Valentine are clearly each others' love interests, fulfilling the tone/emotion aspect. The show also averts most Unfortunate Implications since Everyone Is Bi and Ho Yay is par the course. As an abridged series LittleKuriboh is (mostly) restricted to the original footage, so there's little potential payoff anyhow. Not to mention that the creator himself is bi.

But Not Too Bi Example in Western Animation

-   In the **DC Animated Movie Universe,** the only time Constantine hints at being bi is a single line in **Justice League Dark: Apokolips War** about King Shark being his ex. They never discuss their relationship during the movie, and the details are never expanded upon (though fans on social media had no problem filling in the gaps themselves), and it's treated as a joke whereas his romance with Zatanna is taken much more seriously.
-   **The Owl House**: Hunter and Willow are bi and pan respectively, per Word of Gay, but the only attraction either of them shows on-screen is towards each other.
-   **Ready Jet Go!**: Jet is never stated to be bi on the show, despite it being indirectly confirmed via Word of Gay. Due to not being a human, however, it can be hard to say if his sexuality can be categorized at all, although he's definitely shown attraction to multiple genders.
