Chic and Awe: 
**Lois Lane:** I hear he's nothing but Gotham trash: rich, spoiled, and...  
_\[Bruce Wayne steps off the plane\]_  
**Lois Lane:** ... _absolutely gorgeous!_

A character is being spoken of by another character. Suddenly, the person being talked about walks through the door and the complainer is utterly awestruck mid-sentence. This happens most often at some sort of formally arranged event (especially dress parties where everyone is in cocktail gowns and tuxedos, or something similar), with friends joking that a friend of the opposite sex would be completely out of place, only to find out that She Cleans Up Nicely.

A subtrope of Distracted by the Sexy. Related to Love at First Sight, but only when the characters haven't met before. Sometimes caused by the strange energy field emanating from The Pornomancer. Often happens to the Deadpan Snarker, the cynic, a Jerkass, or someone similar, who you wouldn't expect to act that way. This also often sometimes happens between friends, especially if the two characters are long term Just Friends. Frequently accompanied by Revenge of the Nerd.
