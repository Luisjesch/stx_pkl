Benevolent Abomination: 
_"Blanche Von Haderach is a powerful humanoid entity capable of interacting with the human mind in unprecedented ways. \[...\] While there is still much mystery surrounding Blanche's nature, origins, abilities and motivations, there's no doubting Blanche's kindness and concern for others."_

The Eldritch Abomination, the centerpiece of any Cosmic Horror Story. Unknowable, ancient creatures that can annihilate humanity with ease, and either despise humanity, see them as toys to play with and break at will, or operate entirely on Blue-and-Orange Morality. Or are they?

Despite their horrific and unknowable nature, not all eldritch abominations are inherently evil or amoral. Perhaps Humanity Is Infectious, and a creature that was once evil or incapable of understanding morality begins to gain it as a result of greater understanding. Maybe their nature is mind-shattering to humans, but they are ultimately Creepy Good protectors despite this.

This trope is very common in Lovecraft Lite works. Many of these characters might also be Humanoid Abominations in order to make them more relatably humanlike and sympathetic, or perhaps they're Adorable Abominations who are just as cute and sweet as they appear to be.

This is obviously a subtrope of Benevolent Monsters. Closely related to Did We Just Have Tea with Cthulhu?, where an eldritch abomination has a pleasant interaction with a human character, though many of them are still capable of being Affably Evil or operating on Blue-and-Orange Morality.

## Examples:

Benevolent Abomination Example in Anime & Manga

-   **Getter Robo**: This is, more or less, the true nature of the Getter Rays themselves (and, by extension, the Humongous Mecha the protagonists use that are powered by them), who are without a doubt **the** most terrifying entity in the series but also firmly on humanity's side.
-   **Housing Complex C**: Kimi Shirokado is heavily implied to be none other than Yog-Sothoth, trapping everyone on the island in a perpetual time loop... which is meant to serve as a utopia, and she has no ill will whatsoever. The only people she gruesomely kills are the Big Bad Duumvirate, the Koshide family, and while she becomes disappointed in humanity as a whole, she chooses to leave them rather than destroy them, even sparing the friendly Kan when he prays to her for help.
-   **How Not to Summon a Demon Lord**: The Demon Lord Krebskulm was just as evil as the other Demon Lords when sealed away, but she underwent a Heel–Face Turn upon being unsealed. Initially, this was because she was only partially unsealed without her memories and took a liking to (demi)human-made sweets, but upon spending time with Diablo and the others, her outlook didn't change even after her memories returned upon the completion of breaking her seal.
-   **Naruto**: The Nine-Tailed Demon-Fox is a colossal Animalistic Abomination shaped like an Asian Fox Spirit, and was sealed inside Naruto when he was a baby to stop its rampage. While it initially wants to take over his body and/or manipulate him into removing its seal so that it can resume its rampage, Naruto's kindness and compassion gradually manage to wear down the self-proclaimed living mass of malevolence, causing it to undergo a Heel–Face Turn by the end of the series. Much of Naruto's inspiration for doing this comes from Killer Bee's example, who long ago befriended his own sealed Animalistic Abomination, the Eight-Tailed Ox Demon.
-   **Neon Genesis Evangelion**:
    -   Rei Ayanami is eventually revealed to be a benevolent Humanoid Abomination. Being a clone of Shinji's mother Yui imbued with the soul of the Blue-and-Orange Morality progenitor of humanity Lilith, she at first unknowingly enacts Gendo Ikari's plan to use her as a method of initiating Instrumentality by achieving ultimate power. While initially seemingly emotionless, she comes to grapple with an understanding of humanity and her care for Shinji, being resolved upon discovering her true nature from Kaworu/Adam. Upon understanding the disgusting moral reaches that Gendo went to and how he had emotionally manipulated both her and Shinji, she betrays him and puts the choice of Instrumentality into Shinji's hands under the impression he'd do the right thing. Shinji, having gone past a Despair Event Horizon, uses it to destroy humanity, but Rei still pleads with him to stop. While the creature she has fused into ultimately initiates Instrumentality, it's as a result of Shinji's decision and not her own. After the physical body of the creature she's fused into is destroyed by Shinji rejecting Instrumentality, her metaphysical form is shown to still be that of her human identity.
    -   Kaworu, despite initially being an antagonist and set up in life to annihilate humanity by fusing with what he believed to be Adam, also ends up becoming this, viewing humanity as more deserving to exist than angels and therefore sacrificing himself in the process. He also appears with Rei after Shinji rejects instrumentality, providing lines that demonstrate their benevolent natures.
        
        **Kaworu and Rei**: We are the hope that people will one day understand each other, and we are the words 'I love you'.

Benevolent Abomination Example in Comic Books

-   **Stardust the Super Wizard** is a (possibly) unintentional example of this. While he's firmly on humanity's side, his very existence is nonsensical, as he lives on the surface of the sun and he has literally no abilities to counter him whatsoever. He's a (again, possibly unintentionally) downplayed version of this trope, however, as the cruelty with which he gives the fates of those he punishes places him in Unscrupulous Hero territory.
-   The obscure Marvel superhero Straw Man, he's a scarecrow shaped thing who is first introduced keeping the demon Kalumai a Sealed Evil in a Can, he possesses a gaze that can induce fear in others and he likes to kill Kalumai's cultists in creative and brutal fashion, but he is still unambiguously a good guy.

Benevolent Abomination Example in Fan Works

-   **As Old As Time**: Atua is said to love humanity and spends his time learning about them and constructing an interstellar sanctuary where his cultists will live after the Elder Gods awaken. Angie is the only one of his cultists we see, but she's a friendly Genki Girl with complete trust in him. Atua also only exposes himself to protect Angie when Kyoko threatens to kill her.
-   **Hosting Mr. ████████** features Sweetie Belle having tea with the titular character, an eldritch abomination from outer space. While his appearance and name cause ponies around him to drop into fits of insanity, he himself is nothing but pleasant. He even (seemingly) agrees to spare Sweetie's universe from his omnicidal rampage, simply because he was asked to politely.
-   **The Land of What Might-Have-Been**: the entity known as the Eyes In The Darkness is a nightmarish being that dwells in the shadows between dimensions, watching everything going on across the multiverse, and constantly looking for a way in. More frighteningly, he's also revealed to be an agglomeration of incredibly powerful souls that have merged into a single Undead Abomination — more specifically, the souls of the Nome King and his many alternates. However, when Elphaba finally meets him, he proves an ally: he helps to guide her across the multiverse, ushers her into a parallel world where Elphaba can finally put one of her longest-running demons to rest, and even helps in the final battle against the Empress. He's more than a bit unscrupulous, but he's very much a Retired Monster and once his old grudges are settled, he just wants to find a place where he can settle down. He's being honest: in the finale, he vanishes off into Oz in a body of his own creation and happily spends the rest of eternity as an itinerant Professional Gambler.
-   **My Little Pony: The Mentally Advanced Series**: Zig-zagged with Thrackerzod. Her intents to kill Twilight Sparkle are wicked, and to even exist in physical space she needs to take over the body of a child, but to the rest of the Crusaders she's surprisingly cordial and lenient. Even when they aggravate her, she sticks with them out of seemingly genuine camradery, and when the universe is reset (which she's aware of) she makes sure to immediately go re-befriend them.
-   **This Bites!**: The mysterious foggy giants of the Florian Triangle from canon are fleshed out in this story. They are the Florian Triangle itself, the aspects of its consciousness in full control of the winds and tides and such that occur within. Yet, the ominousness thereof has a different interpretation: as Soundbite puts it, the Triangle is a mirror that reflects the emotions poured into it. It inspired fear from others and so it grew more terrifying, which only got worse when Moria moved in. But thanks to the Straw Hats, with its true nature known, the inhabitants started pouring out positive emotions, allowing the Triangle to be happy and full of life as well.

-   **The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part**: Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi is a shapeshifter who constantly changes forms, many of which the characters find frightening, and who introduces herself with a definitely-not-a- Villain Song called "Not Evil". The catch is that she's telling the truth; she really is not evil, and is unaware that her song came off as more sarcastic than sincere.

Benevolent Abomination Example in Films — Live-Action

-   **Aquaman**: The Atlanteans have a legend about a creature called the Karathen, which was so powerful even King Atlan feared it, and locked it away. Arthur eventually discovers that the creature is real and every bit as big and powerful as the legends say. Except Atlan didn't fear it, he was friends with it, and he didn't lock it away, it chose to guard his trident out of loyalty. When Arthur spoke to it, it was glad to find out that after centuries, there was someone else that could understand it.
-   **Glorious**: Ghatanothoa is a god or titan (though he acknowledges such human terms are insufficient to truly describe him) who was created by his "father" to wipe out all life in the universe when he enters the material realm, but was banished to the aether by his siblings. Ghat has grown rather fond of life and does not want to see it destroyed, making a sincere effort to befriend the human Wes to help him save the universe from his father. Only to do so requires Wes to satisfy Ghat physically...

Benevolent Abomination Example in Literature

-   **Cthulhu Mythos**:
    -   Yog-Sothoth, the Lurker at the Threshold, serves as one of these, to the point where he's almost a Token Good Teammate among his fellow Outer Gods. He exists simultaneously at all points in time and space and so knows everything, and is surprisingly willing to share that knowledge with his loyal followers. He's also known for having casual chats with human beings and even granted the occultist Randolph Carter a wish on one occasion. There are several stories where Yog-Sothoth is invoked against less powerful deities as a protector; in Lovecraft's own final tale, "The Haunter of the Dark," the protagonist fervently prays to Yog-Sothoth to save him from the titular monster. Even Yog's appearance is less nightmarish than the other Eldritch Abominations: while they're monstrous, he takes the form of a series of glowing spheres. It's somewhat downplayed in that Yog-Sothoth can still drive people insane and operates on Blue-and-Orange Morality; he's just generally nicer about it than the rest of the group.
    -   Kthanid, Cthulhu's brother from **Titus Crow**, is the head of the Elder Gods, eldritch entities who are "the good guys" against the Outer Gods and Great Old Ones. He looks exactly like him, save the fact he has orange eyes. Whereas Cthulhu radiates evil, people in Kthanid's presence feel benevolence - and he backs it up by making sure to protect the title character, even if it requires some scheming.
    -   In general, the expanded Lovecraft universe has "Elder Gods", who are at best actively safeguarding humanity against Eldritch terrors and driving away unspeakable things (such as the God Nodens denying Nyarlathotep his victory in **The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath**). At worst, they are indifferent to humanity but unwittingly protect them against worse things. The Pantheon includes Bast and Amaterasu.
-   In the Cthulhu-adjacent adventures of Conan the Barbarian, there is Yag-kosha from **The Tower of the Elephant**. An alien sorcerer, of a Dying Race, resembling a humanoid elephant with angelic wings, he came to Hyborean Earth to pass on his people's knowledge to humanity. Unfortunately, one ambitious apprentice overpowers and tortures him, forcing him to teach said apprentice evil magic. Conan is so moved by Yag-kosha's story, and the obvious signs of his abuse at the hands of his former student, that he agrees to free the being from his mortal form so his spirit may take vengeance.
-   **The Lord of the Rings**: While "abomination" is perhaps a bit of a stretch, the incredibly mysterious Tom Bombadil fits the trope well. To begin with, no one's sure what the heck he even **is**—he's definitely not a human, hobbit, wizard, elf, or any other known species. He claims to remember "the first raindrop and the first acorn," and it's hinted that he was around before Middle-Earth itself was created. Tom is also the most powerful creature in the entire world: the One Ring has no effect on him, and it's said that even if Sauron's forces took over the entirety of the world, Tom's home would be the last area to fall. For all his strength, though, Mr. Bombadil lives simply as a jolly, food-loving fellow who likes to tell stories, pick flowers for his wife Goldberry, and entertain guests with songs and stories... when he's not utterly destroying any monster who threatens those guests.
-   Pretty much the entire point of **Nyaruko: Crawling with Love!**, which reveals that the malign deities of the Cthulhu Mythos are space aliens and can be quite pleasant once you get to know them. The title character is Nyarlathotep the Crawling Chaos, who appears as a beautiful, energetic teenage girl who makes friends easily due to her honest, outgoing nature and endless cheer (and came to Earth because she fell in Love Before First Sight with Ordinary High-School Student Mahiro Yasaka). She's quickly joined in Mahiro's household by Cthuguha the Living Flame and Hastur the Yellow King, who are an Emotionless Gamer Chick and Cute Shotaro Boy respectively.
-   **Thebe and the Angry Red Eye** combines this trope with Unwitting Instigator of Doom. A group of astronauts approach Jupiter, unaware that a snakelike alien lives inside the planet. The being tries to say hello with a radiation surge, but this tuns out to be a First Contact Faux Pas; the surge damages the Cool Starship, leading to a series of disasters that kill all but one of the crew. However, the creature proves its good intentions at the end; when the tragedy's Sole Survivor makes contact with him, the alien comforts him as best it can, even allowing him to say goodbye to his beloved wife on Earth just before he dies.
-   **Young Wizards**: One of the most powerful and frankly **weirdest** entities in the entire multiverse of the books is...a chubby, cheerful pig named Chao. He's better known as the Transcendent Pig, since he exists at every moment in space and time simultaneously, which grants him near-total knowledge of everything in all creation. Chao is benevolent because he's a perfectly friendly fellow who loves to chat and play games with anyone who talks to him; he's an abomination because no one knows who the heck he is or where he came from—even the Powers that Be, who created the entirety of existence, have no clue as to his origins (their best guess is that one of them made him and doesn't want to admit it). Chao even knows the meaning of life, and if someone catches him when he's not paying attention, he just might slip up and share it without realizing it.

Benevolent Abomination Example in Live-Action TV

-   **Doctor Who**:
    -   The Doctor themself is an impossibly ancient being with an ability to perceive the universe in ways far beyond human understanding, and they're feared by their enemies, even by the Daleks. They're even an Eldritch Abomination to **their own species** of Eldritch Abominations because they're also a mysterious entity from another dimension that even the Time Lords were unable to deduce anything about. And yet, they're (mostly) benevolent and **love** humanity and Earth, and will do anything to save their beloved adoptive planet.
    -   The Doctor's TARDIS, a sapient Eldritch Location that's Bigger on the Inside and can travel anywhere in time and space, is just as much in love with humanity as the Doctor is.
-   **Babylon 5**:
    -   Most of the older races, the "First Ones" didn't care or were actively hostile, but a few stand out.
    -   The Vorlons claim to be this, guiding races like the Minbari against the Shadows.Subverted Trope - they are in a long war with the Shadows any only care if the younger races keep fighting
    -   Kosh was an exception to the Vorlons - in the words of several characters, he cared about the younger races. But he was "good" by the Blue-and-Orange Morality of the Vorlons. At one point he put two of the main characters in a test of their commitment that nearly killed them.
    -   Lorien is true to this trope after he meets Sherridan - he works with the younger races to end the Shadow War and he convinces all the First Ones to leave the galaxy. He appeared as an old humaniod but his true form was an orb of light with tentacles of light.
-   **Star Trek**
    -   **The Original Series** introduces the Medusans, a race of Energy Beings introduced in the episode "Is There In Truth No Beauty?". The Medusans are powerful telepaths who are also friendly with the Federation, their thoughts being described as "sublime". Unfortunately, their physical appearance is so repellent to most corporeal lifeforms that looking at one causes insanity and subsequent death. As such, their dealings with Starfleet must be carried out via psychic intermediaries or from within special containment suits. Only Spock and Dr. Jones are shown to be able to withstand the effects of looking directly at a Medusan with the help of a special visor, owing to the former's Vulcan mind and the latter being blind.
    -   **Star Trek: Deep Space Nine** has the aliens in the Bajoran wormhole, whom the Bajorans worship as their "Prophets". These aliens are completely incorporeal: all dealings with them have them take A Form You Are Comfortable With — typically, people from the memories of whichever corporeal lifeform they are conversing with. They also exist completely untethered to linear time, the concept of which they are not only unfamiliar with, but can be physically harmed by. For the most part, however, they are content to let people travel through their wormhole to and from the Gamma Quadrant, just so long as they are not bothered: if you're lucky, annoying them will only result in your mind being rewritten. If not, you could simply vanish from reality. The Pah-Wraiths, on the other hand, are an active danger to everyone in the galaxy...
-   **Where In Time Is Carmen Sandiego**: Omnicia has the benevolent part nailed, as every time she's contacted, she always gives the Time Pilots useful information for tracking down the villain, recovering the loot, and repairing the timeline. The abomination part is heavily implied; we aren't really told what she **is**.

Benevolent Abomination Example in Mythology & Religion

-   The Bible:
    -   God is a possible Ur-Example of this trope; **the** ancient entity who Was, Is, and Will Be, revealing only that of Himself which He chooses to reveal, whose true glory kills any who witnesses it, and possesses unlimited omnipotent powers, but happens to have humanity's best interests at heart (though you don’t want to cross Him or mess with His creations).
    -   This goes for many biblical angels as well, as they are often described as having absolutely terrifying and incomprehensible forms to the point of becoming Memetic Mutation, but are firmly on humanity’s side.

Benevolent Abomination Example in Tabletop Games

-   **Pathfinder**: The goddess Desna is an ancient being that pre-dates the stars, whose true form is a massive moth-like creature, and who is heavily associated with stars and dreams. It's suggested that she may be an Outer God who became fascinated by humanity.

---
Benevolent Abomination Example in Video Games

-   **BoxxyQuest: The Gathering Storm**: Downplayed; Cracky the Sky Queen is an Angelic Abomination who looks like a Creepy Doll with spider limbs and Black Eyes of Evil, and is antagonistic, but does genuinely want to save the world and is pretty kind to her fairy subjects — at worst, she is a Well-Intentioned Extremist who wants to turn Catie back into Virtua under the beleif that this is the only way to save the Internet.
-   **Control** is a New Weird game set in an Eldritch Location run by The Federal Bureau of Control. Along the way, the Player Character Jesse Faden encounters various monsters and other such paranatural phenomena that falls under the "Eldritch Abomination" category. Many of them are hostile — like The Hiss, The Mold and The Thing-That-Was-Once-Hartman — but there are some eldritch entities that can be called benevolent, or at least are aligned with the Bureau.
    -   Polaris is a resonance-based entity that was planted in (or brought out of) Jesse by Hedron. It acts as a silent companion to her, helps her find thing, and is proven to destroy the Hiss's influence.
    -   The Board is an entity (or host of entities) taking the form of an inverted black pyramid in a massive white expanse within the Astral Plane. They have a connection to all of the Objects of Power, and The Oldest House itself, and are responsible for choosing the Director of the FBC. While they are treated as allies in the game, their actions and dialogue make it unclear if they have humanity's best interest in mind or if their goals align for now.
    -   Ahti is the Ambiguously Human janitor of The Oldest House. It's implied that he was there before the FBC discovered him, he doesn't wear an HRA when the Hiss invades, and the FBC's attempts at recording him accidentally created an Altered Item. He acts as something of a mentor role to Jesse and it is nothing but helpful to her, as strange and obscure as his help is.
    -   It's implied that constant exposure to Hedron caused Dr. Casper Darling to Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence, and what little we see of him in this state has him rooting for Jesse in her fight against the Hiss.
-   **Destiny**: The Traveler is a gigantic, enigmatic white sphere that has spent billions of years traveling the galaxy, terraforming worlds and guiding any civilization it encounters into golden ages of peace and prosperity without desiring anything in return. It's furthermore an avatar or manifestation of the Light, sometimes known as the Sky or "the gardener", a sort of combination Background Magic Field\-Sentient Cosmic Force metaphysically associated with things like peace, life, altruism, and difference, and which seeks to foster the growth of those things across the universe. The Light has its bad points, which amount to it being **too** good: God's Hands Are Tied because it respects free will even to its own detriment, it lets itself be taken advantage of because it's **always** willing to forgive, and at worst it loves life so much it might not allow anyone to die.
-   Mantorok in **Eternal Darkness** is much more benevolent to humanity, compared to the three other Ancients. The worse Mantorok has done to humanity was eating two Khmer guards, which earned Pious Augustus's mocking for resorting to eating "flesh and blood," and sacrificing a few individuals to prevent the total extinction of humanity. Its ability to manipulate time and space not only pushes humanity to stop the Ancient's plans but also allows the three Ancients to destroy each other before merging the timeline that ensures all three of their deaths. What it plans to do with the humans afterward is unknown.
-   Zig-Zagged in **The Elder Scrolls** with some of the Daedric Princes. While all are dangerous and fickle, some like Meridia and Azura are far less evil than others, with their divine domains being unambiguously positive forces like Life Energy and light. Still, their benevolence is more them creating a win-win scenario than their having genuine compassion.
-   Suggested in **Everybody's Gone to the Rapture**: the Pattern is an intangible, formless entity initially believed to be feeding on the people of Yaughton. However, later interpretations suggest that the Pattern either doesn't know that it's harming people by dissolving them into light, or that it's actually benevolent. In particular, Kate believes that the Pattern is actually lonely and genuinely wants to bring happiness to the world, suggesting that it isn't feeding on people at all, but "collecting" them and incorporating them into a heavenly Mind Hive where they are reunited with their lost loved ones and get everything they want. With this in mind, the ending in which the Pattern assimilates the human race is depicted in a beautiful, almost transcendent way — albeit heavily on the bittersweet side.
-   **Fate/Grand Order**:
    -   Abigail Williams was a 12-year-old girl who was the first person accused and executed in the Salem witch trials. Originating as part of a pocket dimension mashup between the Salem Witch Trials and the Cthulhu Mythos created by the Demon Pillar Raum in the guise of Randolf Carter, Abigail is indwelled by Sut-Typhon (an eldritch entity strongly implied to be Yog-Sothoth) and metamorphoses into a Humanoid Abomination with bone-white skin, tentacles for "clothes", and a keyhole containing a third eye in her forehead. After being freed from Sut-Typhon's control, she retains her powers and decides to travel the multiverse with the real Randolf Carter rather than be erased from existence as the pocket dimension disappears. While a copy of her is summonable as a Foreigner-class Servant, the original Abigail later returns as an ally of Chaldea.
    -   The Arcade version, whose plot diverges from the mobile version about halfway through the first arc due to being an Alternate Timeline, has Tiamat, Beast II, who after her defeat in the original timeline's seventh Singularity put herself through a Heel–Face Reincarnation and decided to help her wayward children, humanity, in spite of their previous "rejection" of her, and is an ally for Arcade's seventh Singularity against its new Big Bad.
    -   Kulkulkan, who is one of your main allies for Lostbelt 7, turns out to be this. She is the ripped out heart of ORT, the Ultimate One of the Oort Cloud. For the record, ORT is the most powerful being seen in **Nasuverse**, as it is some kind of immortal cosmic spider-like thing with Precognition, and unknown levels of intelligence, hellbent on destroying humanity. That ripped out heart bit? It took MILLIONS of years to accomplish. And now the heart serves as an underground world's **second sun**. Fortunately for Chaldea, Kulkulkan decided that she loves her namesake and life, and so she joins in as a Genki Girl who is unquestionably your ally.
-   Hosted Games' **The Passenger** stars an Eldritch Abomination who indwells a human infant after being attacked by a bigger, meaner eldritch predator and spends 26 years trapped in said body. Depending on player choices, the MC can discover that Humanity Is Infectious, and even fall in love.
-   **Kirby**:
    -   The titular character is an almost indestructible being of ambiguous origin who can steal the abilities of others by eating them and repeatedly is shown to have likely limitless power. He is also a sweet-natured and happy-go-lucky glutton who never hesitates to help others and repeatedly protects existence from other actually evil abominations.
    -   There's also Gooey from **Kirby's Dream Land 3**. He's a being made of Dark Matter (and by extension, Zero), but he's a nice-if-somewhat-dimwitted creature who prefers being Kirby's friend. Even as he takes on a more Dark Matter-esque form while flying, he's still friendly.
    -   **Kirby and the Forgotten Land** has Elfilin. He's half of the alien conqueror Fecto Elfilis, one made of their kindness and love. As such, he doesn't hesitate to help Kirby save the Waddle Dees captured by his evil half and acts as his friend throughout.
-   **Resident Evil Village**: The Duke, who serves as the game's merchant, is one of these. He's incredibly large and fat—to the point where his clothes cannot contain his girth—and yet somehow possesses Offscreen Teleportation, as he's able to move ahead of protagonist Ethan with great speed and dexterity; he seems to have Psychic Powers, as he knows everything that's happening in the village and takes Ethan to the site of the final battle against Mother Miranda when Ethan himself was **clinically dead**—there's no way any normal person would know that he was still able to revive; and his skill as a cook is so high that the meals he prepares can permanently alter Ethan's physiology, giving him stat boosts. Toward the end of the game, Ethan finally asks who or what the Duke is, and he can only laugh and respond "Even **I** can't quite answer that..." Yet for all his bizarre powers and creepy demeanor, the Duke is a genuinely kind person/entity who goes out of his way to help Ethan in his quest regardless of the consequences to himself.
-   In **Starcraft**, the Xel'Naga are a mostly benevolent and aloof species of Precursors who seed life in the universe and then sit back to watch it grow and expand. The end goal is to develop a species with "purity of essence" (strong physical adaptability) and a species with "purity of form" (powerful psychic ability). Those two species would then merge together to ascend and form a new Xel'Naga. The Xel'Naga themselves are massive, immortal creatures of colossal scale who resemble multi-eyed squid and whose primary bodies exist in the Void, separate from other physical universes. The majority of the Xel'Naga are benevolent beings, but Amon, the Big Bad of **Starcraft II**, seeks to end the cycle of Xel'Naga rebirth by annihilating all life because he believes it causes nothing but endless suffering.
-   **Subnautica**: The Sea Emperor Leviathan from the first game. It's the single biggest creature in the game, but isn't aggressive and wants the player's help to end a plague spread throughout the ocean.
-   **Weird and Unfortunate Things Are Happening**:
    -   The Outer Evocations and Zlonyth are terrifying entities beyond comprehension, but they are friendly to humans and team up with the heroes, sharing their powers, to stop the more traditional eldritch Inner Evocations from destroying the humans of Daybreak. The normal ending implies that the partnership was really pure pragmatism and now they intend to carry out some secret evil agenda, but Farudon at least seems to genuinely consider the heroes his friends and isn't in on the plan, while Zlonyth wants nothing to do with either side and only helps when the Inners become so powerful that he is forced to aid the Outers in stopping them.
    -   Xelanyel the Matriarch, the mother of all Evocations and the Final Boss, initally seems to be the Greater-Scope Villain but turns out to be perfectly friendly to humans and never attacks of her own will- the Inners have to hijack her body to make her do what they want.

Benevolent Abomination Example in Visual Novels

-   **Slay the Princess**:
    -   The Long Quiet, the protagonist himself, is a Genius Loci with a dark, spooky-looking Bird Man avatar who represents the concept of stagnation. It was created to contain the Shifting Mound so as to stop her from destroying the world, and depending on your decisions, you can be a fairly heroic character who tries to make the right decisions and help others, and can convince the Shifting Mound not to destroy the world.
    -   The titular Princess is a Humanoid Abomination whom the Narrator insists will bring about the end of the world of she is not slain. While on many routes she is hostile and monstrous, a few choices will have her seem to become genuinely friendly, or even in love, with the protagonist. It's eventually revealed that every version of the Princess is just one part of the Shifting Mound, the entity of change that was split into pieces by someone trying to bring an end to death itself. While she can indeed end the universe, she is genuinely in love with the Long Quiet and believes that the change she embodies is a good thing, or at least a necessary one; she is birth and growth as much as she is death and ruin, and believes that a finite existence is needed to give existence meaning. Even then, she can confess that she's uncertain of her existence and if she truly desires to carry out her purpose. Despite embodying the opposite concept from you she's never anything but warm and loving towards you - after all, you were the same entity once. Notably, all she wants is for you to join her in exploring and shaping existence together, whereas you can, if you choose, decide that you'd rather kill her and shape existence alone, and even if you choose to do so she'll spend her last moments sincerely telling you that she loves you and wishes you nothing but the best. You can even take the diplomatic solution and convince her to **not** destroy the world.

Benevolent Abomination Example in Web Animation

-   **Angel Hare** has Gabby, the main character of a Christian kids' show. She genuinely means well and wants to help; the "Abomination" part comes from the fact that she's aware of one of her viewers, but only during a live broadcast. She can also affect the real world, and may be related to the Archangel Gabriel.
-   The titular **Chikn Nuggit** appears to be an adorable yellow "pubby", but frequently displays anomalous properties such as stretching his neck and ears, swapping his and Cheezborger the cat's species, and — when deciding to "change things up" — briefly appearing as a yellow mass of writhing tentacles and teeth. Even Iscream, a demonic eldritch entity themselves, is intimidated by Chikn.
-   Ninomae Ina'nis from **hololive** is the scariest-looking of the English-speaking roster, playing the character of the head priestess of the "Ancient Ones" and looking like them. She is also the calmest and most easy-going member of Hololive EN.

Benevolent Abomination Example in Webcomics

-   Played for Laughs in a **Buttersafe** comic about a gigantic monster (at least 200 feet tall) that comes to destroy the planet...but first he meets a little girl and strikes up a friendly conversation with her. When she asks if she can help him with his task, the beast happily gives her a hammer and lets her run loose. The comic ends with the monster overlooking the scorched landscape of the ruined Earth, with the little girl cheerfully sitting beside him on his shoulder.
-   While most of the Celestials from **Housepets!** aren't eldritch enough to count, their head honcho, Bahamut, absolutely does. He's the only one stated to be completely omnipotent and can take a multitude of forms, most frequently an intimidatingly gargantuan Draconic Abomination with an always-stoic expression. Still, among the Celestials he's one of the most pleasant and fair, and tells King explicitly that he loves every mortal soul. Given his job is to judge denizens of Heaven and mortals alike, it's for the best that he's got a good heart.

Benevolent Abomination Example in Web Original

-   **The Backrooms**: Entity 140, "Blanche" is a very sweet and kind young Magic Librarian lady that helps wanderers who enter her floor on Level 906, and is one of the **very few** unanimously benevolent Entities despite her actual form being an immensely powerful and mind-shattering Eldritch Abomination.
-   **SCP Foundation**:
    -   SCP-999 is perhaps the best-known example of an anomalous SCP entity that is completely friendly and harmless, being an adorable orange Blob Monster with an omnibenevolent personality, and has the ability to induce feelings of pure happiness in anyone it makes physical contact with. One popular story suggests that is is the spawn of the Scarlet King, whose other spawn notably includes (at least depending on the continuity) the unkillable and omnicidal lizard SCP-682.
    -   SCP-6033-1 is Ud'itlah, a formless tentacled blob who claims to have been born "before even the oldest star". They were incredibly lonely until they discovered Toby McEnderson, an equally lonely little boy heavily implied to be an orphan, and became his Best Friend.
        
        **SCP-6033-1:** They're in a special place right now. It can be a little cold sometimes, and even a little scary, but there's lots of people there that will take care of them both and keep them safe. No matter what, Ud'itlah and Toby will always have each other, and maybe even someday they'll be able to see the world together. Together they'll live happily ever after.
        
-   **Centennials** has the relationship between the entity Gorbuch and his host Vendil, as Gorbuch empowers Vendil to fight on behalf of the century corps and has helped Vendil save the world multiple times.
-   **Slimyswampghost** has Long Horse, an Animalistic Abomination resembling a horse skull attached to an infinitely long, crooked neck. They're also a benevolent protector that saves lives by warning others of impending doom. Also, one of The Giants is a protector of her hometown, making her the Token Good Teammate amongst her malevolent peers.

Benevolent Abomination Example in Western Animation

-   **Amphibia**: A Cosmic Entity known as the Calamity Guardian appears in the final episode. They initially take the form of an outdated computer model, because they think that's how Anne's peers communicate. When Anne points out they're a few decades behind, they instead take the form of Anne's cat Domino. Their true form is a mass of incandescent transdimensional energy, the mere presence of which shakes entire planes of existence and drives people mad. Anne has a Freak Out merely catching a glimpse of it. Nevertheless, they're indeed a benevolent being, but have a habit of being Brutally Honest and Innocently Insensitive, as well as not foreseeing how some inhabitants of Amphibia would abuse the Calamity Stones they have given them (and haven't really done much to stop them).
-   **Love, Death & Robots**
    -   In the episode "Beyond the Aquila Rift", a team of wayward astronauts are trapped in an illusion of a spaceship by a hideous spider-like alien entity taking on the form of the captain's old flame. This is to hide how far off course they are, how old they have become, how one of their crew has perished, and how horrifying their new environment is, in order to keep them as calm and sane as possible.
    -   Played with in the episode "All Through the House". In it, Santa is portrayed as a Santabomination; a grotesque red xenomorph-like creature that drinks through a straw-like tongue, and can identify the concepts of goodness and naughtiness through smell. Despite it's horrifying appearance, it lives up to its benevolent status by regurgitating the perfect gifts for children it approves of, and even gives an Affectionate Gesture to the Head to reassure anyone that see it that it means no harm. However, the children that were unfortunate enough to witness it lie awake for the whole night, wondering what would've happened to them if they hadn't been good... Especially after an ominous warning that it leaves for them before leaving:
        
        **Santa:** Stay... Good...
