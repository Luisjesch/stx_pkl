Crazy-Prepared: 
**Date:** Hey, Mizuki. What's inside that backpack you always have on you?  
**Mizuki:** Well... Water, dehydrated bread, chocolate, biscuits, a flashlight, a hand charger, Swiss army knife, a candle, matches, triangular badges, a first aid kit, whistle, portable toilet, a plastic bag, duct tape, a grenade, a magnet, disposable hand warmers...  
**Date:** Do you have an entire disaster relief kit in your bag?  
**Mizuki:** Better safe than sorry. I'm ready for anything.

Simply put, a character is _excessively_ prepared for a scenario, no matter how unlikely.

This trope is for you if you always have a backpack with tools and supplies to MacGyver your way out of a tight spot, if your car's trunk has enough camping gear and food to spend an unplanned night in the woods if your vehicle breaks down, or if you have a large, impressive gun rack all sorted by varmint size, and if you are Genre Savvy enough to prepare for every unlikely trope,

Crazy-Prepared Example in Game Shows

-   On **Task Master**, Alex is often **insanely** ready for the antics of the comedians. One task involved two sets of instructions on two separate cards: the first card read "say a letter of the alphabet", and when the contestant said that, Alex presented them with a second card that read "put the most things beginning with the letter you just said on the tray". Ed Gamble thought he was being clever when he answered "a letter of the alphabet", but Alex, without skipping a beat, had another card ready that said "Ha ha ha. You must now pick a letter of the alphabet and say **that** out loud."
    
    **Ed:** You must be **so** proud of yourself that that worked.

Crazy-Prepared Example in Theatre

-   Brian Le Petit (principal clown) in Cirque du Soleil's **Mystère** is crazy prepared for pulling any prank you could think to pull on unsuspecting Real Life audience members, such as fake tickets, a blonde wig, confetti, a lacy bra, and several buckets of popcorn, most of which he hides up his sleeves or in his pockets. If that does not count, we later find he has quick access to a gun, a chainsaw, and a can of air freshener. As a bonus, he's not one of the characters in the story, but a prankster who somehow got into the theater and decided to amuse himself, so there's even less **sensible** explanation for where he's finding/why he's carrying some of these things.
