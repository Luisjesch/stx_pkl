Card Sharp: 
_The Cardsharps_ (ca. 1594) by Caravaggio

_"Trust me, son. When _**I**_ play cards, it ain't gambling."_

Quick hands. The prestidigitator member of a con team, who sometimes works alone. Frequently, the tricks he pulls have to do with manipulating playing cards, hence the name, but a team will sometimes call on a card sharp to make a tricky switch, "dip" a pocket, or put up a fancy misdirection. Likely a Hustler, their favorite routine is Hustling the Mark into getting their guard down enough to make a foolish bet.

May or may not be a Death Dealer. Compare Professional Gambler. Has a good chance of getting into a Gambling Brawl or being hit with Tar and Feathers.

"Card _Shark_" is a variant of the term which doesn't always imply cheating, just a penchant for playing cards. Often in the US it refers to the professional gambler who focuses on card games.

## Examples:

Card Sharp Example in Anime and Manga

-   Both Firo and Keith Gandor from **Baccano!**. Firo's picked up enough tricks from managing an underground casino that not only can he slip cards in and out with the best of them, but can pick marks well enough that he can nearly sweep a casino without cheating at all. Keith, on the other hand, cheats so much and so blatantly that he has a deck of cards composed entirely of jokers.
-   In **Cowboy Bebop**
    -   Faye is highly skilled in conning people in a game of cards (also dice, though then she just flat-out cheats with rigged dice).
    -   Spike's no slouch either and was able to spot Faye's con a mile away.
-   Protagonist Allen Walker from **D.Gray-Man** is an expert at cheating in cards due to the horrible experiences with debt he had from being with General Cross.
-   **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure**: Daniel J. D'Arby, one of the villains in Part 3, is a gambler who specializes in this. He considers cheating just part of the game, fully expecting his opponents to cheat as well. Unlike most, however, he prefers rigging the entire game **well** before any cards are dealt. Jotaro defeats him by bluffing so perfectly that what's actually **in** their hands doesn't matter... which is good, because Jotaro had **crap**.
-   Unsurprisingly, comes up frequently in both **Kaiji** and **Akagi**.
-   Nearly every major character in **The Legend of Koizumi** is able to cheat at Mahjong in some way.
-   In **Liar Game**, the 17-Card Poker game becomes a battle of **dueling** card sharps: Akiyama uses skill and strategy, while his opponent uses superhuman reflexes honed from an aborted career in boxing to track the cards.
-   In **No Matter How I Look at It, It's You Guys' Fault I'm Not Popular!**, the socially awkward protagonist Tomoko cheats at a trading card game. Against **kids**. And she's a **high-schooler**. Her cousin is not impressed.
-   Gojyo in **Saiyuki** frequently cheats at cards. Hakkai can still beat him though, so one wonders if his playing style is completely orthodox.
-   **Yu-Gi-Oh!**: Bandit Keith tends to use this method of cheating. In his semi-finals duel with Joey, he slips his "7 Completed" cards out of his wristbands (which Pegasus notes and later explains after Joey wins the duel), and in his anime-only duel with Yugi, he keeps cards in a special gadget kept up his sleeve.

Card Sharp Example in Comic Books

-   In **Fables** Jack has the ability to draw into four Jacks anytime he wishes during a poker game. The trick is to only do so only with a very large pot since it only works with four Jacks and his opponents would catch on if he tries it a second time during a game.
-   Though it rarely comes up as a plot point, the lead G.I. Joe pilot, Capt. Brad Armbruster, didn't get his codename Ace from being a top pilot, but rather from his love of cutthroat poker. His superiors look the other way regarding his gambling habit, since he's not only that good a pilot, he's not really "gambling" at poker since he **never loses**.
-   A recurring character type in **Lucky Luke**, either seen at the edge of a poker table or being on top of a rail being escorted out of town after the requisite Tar and Feathers.

Card Sharp Example in Literature

-   In the **Discworld** series:
    -   In **Witches Abroad**, the witches run into some, but Granny manages to beat them without cheating or using magic, and supposedly without having played the game (the incredibly complicated Cripple Mr. Onion) before. She'd actually played it quite a bit while caring for a sick witch, but used her newcomer image for an advantage.
    -   Moist von Lipwig created an alter ego to be this. Subverted in that the character was quite awful at being a card sharp, fumbling and missing golden opportunities to cheat.

And to add insult to injury, the coins are fake.
-   In the **Gentleman Bastard** series, the eponymous Locke Lamora successfully cheats in the safest gambling place in the world, where the mere act of cheating carries the death penalty.

-   Fisk from the **Knight and Rogue Series** is rather good at card tricks, though he usually sticks to cons that he can get more money out of and sneak away from easier. Unfortunately this skill doesn't see a whole lot of use. For Michael's sake, he'll usually stick to betting on whether or not he **can** do a trick than actually tricking people.
-   The Lacework Kid, from Damon Runyon's story of the same name. ("Lacework" refers to his artistry with cards.)
-   Subverted in **River of Teeth**. Cal Hotchkiss is introduced as a potential member of the Caper Crew Houndstooth is about to assemble and as someone who makes his living at the cards table. He then quickly proceeds to have his left ear cut off for being caught cheating and eventually is thrown to the feral hippos to die because he never learns his lesson. As it turns out, Houndstooth didn't want him for his nimble fingers but for his connections.

-   A G-rated version appears in an episode of **The Suite Life of Zack & Cody**, in which a little girl scams Maddie out of all of her candy by getting her obsessed with trying to pick the right card.

It was a trick of the light and nothing more. Some "hexes", like **trinkets**, even go so far as to allow a huckster to summon small objects literally from thin air into his hands, furthering the use of one as a Card Sharp con man.
