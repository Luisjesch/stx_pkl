Change the Uncomfortable Subject: 
_"Screw this quandary with a fucking jackhammer. Let us just talk about whatever we were discussing before this shitstorm started flailing about the room."_

Some characters feel a current line of discussion is really inappropriate, and they make it clear they should move on to something else. Sometimes they say "moving on" or "I'd rather not talk about it", or just leap into another topic.

Reasons the current subject isn't working can vary. It may be too Squicky for the character's comfort, might be close to personal events they've experienced, or even something like a Metaphorgotten line.

When Played for Laughs, the character will sometimes say "How 'bout those \[local sports team\]" or Talk About the Weather.

There's a hand gesture that shows up frequently in anime and manga that means basically this.

Compare Stunned Silence and Shutting Up Now. Contrast Digging Yourself Deeper (trying to talk your way out of an uncomfortable subject, and utterly failing).

    **Phantom:** **(while turning completely pink)** Uh... t-the reason you need to find them is because t-they're important to the Spirits, and that's all I c-can say about it for now, so... please d-don't ask any further on that subject.

        **Izuku:** Well, as great an offer it was, and it really was a great offer, I'm still really, really, really, really, really thankful for it, receiving a Quirk like that would be kind of redundant when I'm already really strong, right?  
        **All Might:** Redundancy isn't the issue, even if it's a good point.  
        **Izuku:** But more than that, I want to try and get a full handle on the powers I already have, and I don't think I'll be able to do that if I have another power to work on.

Bustier gives her students a special Valentine's Day lesson about how fairy tales employ The Power of Love, Max points out that many stories that employ True Love's Kiss sidestep the question of **consent**.

-   In **Undertale: The Surface**, it turns out that the creator of **Mew Mew Kissy Cutie** is not a good person, something that completely devastates everyone who learns about it, to the point that Undyne laments that "God Is Evil, Alphys is broken, and we're all going to die." Later, when Papyrus unwittingly brushes across the subject, Undyne does her best to distract him and his brother:
    
    **Papyrus:** IS IT JUST ME, OR DID UNDYNE START ACTING WEIRD WHEN **MEW MEW KISSY CUTIE** WAS MENTIONED? LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON AND SHE'S HIDING IT?  
    **Sans:** Dunno. Though, I will say that I've been getting a bunch of texts from Tori lately... apparently Chara's been acting the **exact** same way. Whenever anyone asks them anything about **Mew Mew Kissy Cutie** or the creator of it, they start getting weird like **this**.  
    **Undyne:** NON-SPECIFIC-YET-OMINOUS SUBJECT CHANGE! Papyrus, we gotta get you caught up on **Steven Universe** first!

    **Sobek:** **ANYWAY**...
    
-   Done in a **Sequential Art** story, when everyone is trying to decide what to do during a rainy day. Resident ubergeek Pip suggests a complicated tapletop RPG (Its rules only span three books!), but Kat shuts him down. Genius Ditz Scarlet suggests "**Monopolop**", but Art points out she cried last time they played because she was told to "Go Directly to Jail" (No-one told her what she did wrong...). So Art suggests **Cards Against Humanity**. They all set up to play, when Scarlet, looking at her cards, innocently asks "What's a Fleshlight?" They decide to play **Monopolop** instead.
-   **Sleepless Domain:**
    -   When Outrageous Lime sees Undine and Heartful Punch together for the first time and gets told by HP that they're together, she remarks to HP "So **that** was your type." Heartful Punch responds by sweating bullets and asking if they could not talk about that, while Undine stands there completely missing the implication.
    -   In chapter ten, when Heartful Punch is telling Undine about how her mother died, she remarks that the monster responsible was still in the room and attacked Starlight Spear, the Magical Girl on the scene who told HP the story later, with the implication that Starlight lost an arm in the process of defeating it. HP goes quiet at that point and when Undine expresses concern HP declares "Anyway!" and continues with her story.
-   In **Sluggy Freelance**, this can happen because other characters are too weirded out by all the stuff the main characters have got involved in, because it won't fit any sane worldview, and they don't want to know about it. A lightly paraphrased conversation from Chapter 73: "The Immortal King - Lost and Found":
    
    **Zoë's dad**: You need to tell your mother and me what's going on with you. Is it drugs? If it's drugs, we can talk.  
    \[a strange creature flies to Zoë\]  
    **Zoë**: This is my pet two-headed dragon I picked up in another dimension.  
    **Zoë's dad**: Never tell us what's going on with you!  
    **Zoë**: Exactly.

    **Gerrard:** ...Lampard as a midfielder was a great rival.
    
-   Done in this review by **Classic Game Room** of **Art of Fighting 3**, when the reviewer lost his train of thought.
-   In **The Crystal Gems Say be Anti-Racist** short **See Color.** Amethyst points out the common phrase "I don't care if you're black or white or purple" is little more than a way to downplay the experiences people of color have with real world racism and shut down discussion of systemic racism and its pervasiveness altogether.
-   Donnie DuPre in **Demo Reel** obviously has issues with his mother, as anyone who asks about her gets blown off. All he divulges is that she was an actress. And because Donnie was the character that shared the most Doug qualities, it's only fair that Doug in "The Review Must Go On" dodges uncomfortable questions just as hard.
-   The **Game Grumps** sometimes do this, when they (either accidentally or deliberately) get a **wee** bit too close to saying something racist or sexist. Such as their playthrough of **Shovel Knight** when Dan comments on Black Knight as if he's, well, Black:
    
    **Arin:** Aw, man. They both love her, but Black Knight realizes he could never love her as much as Shovel Knight.  
    **Danny:** Yeah, because he's... **Black**.  
    (3 seconds of awkward silence)  
    **Danny:** Anyway...
    
-   Geoff, after losing several rounds of "Hunting Pack" in **Grand Theft Auto V** when he had previously been winning with Gavin (normally The Load) on his side, has this to say:
    
    **Geoff:** I liked it better when, uh, when I was winning...  
    **Gavin:** Say it! SAY IT! You liked it better when you were on **my** team! **Say it!**  
    (**Beat**)  
    **Geoff:** LET'S STOP!
    
-   Often on **Honest Trailers**, the Narrator will find himself in an awkward position and whisper "Go to 'Starring'! **Go to 'Starring'!"**
-   Played for Laughs in **Just Bad Games** when playing **Chicken Blaster** when they're describing the various types of enemies and spot a Mook that is a literal Arab suicide bomber wearing a turban:
    
    **Shane:** You've got your flying chickens, your helicopter chickens, your samurai chickens, your chickens with dynamite strapped to their— oh! Uh... oh no...  
    **Adam:** H-hey, let's talk about how bad the animation is!
    
-   During a **Team Four Star** podcast, Kaiser goes too far with a comment about eggnog. After a Stunned Silence, Lani loudly begins to talk about his holiday.

-   **Kaeloo**:
    -   Kaeloo manages to drag Mr. Cat into going on a date with her, but he doesn't seem interested in talking to her and starts reading the news.

    -   In Episode 180, Kaeloo is hanging out with Pretty and Eugly. Pretty tries to ask Kaeloo to explain her "weird relationship" with Mr. Cat, to which Kaeloo responds by asking Eugly about the book she's reading and then asking where the bathroom is.
-   In the very last scene of **Kim Possible**, Professor Dementor is taunting Dr. Drakken about his success at **saving** the world after failing miserably in his attempts to conquer it.
    
    **Dementor:** You must admit that it is exquisitely amusing.  
    **Drakken:** Okay, Dementor, I'd really rather not talk about it.  
    **Dementor:** But the irony! As a mad scientist, you have been a total failure your entire career!  
    **Drakken:** New topic please!
    
    -   The "new topic" turns out to be Dementor asking how Drakken's skin turned blue, which Drakken starts to explain just as the show ends.

When Ensign Brad Boimler asks how Mariner knows Riker, she mentions that he gives her some of his contraband while the comms are still active and in front of Riker's wife, Deanna Troi. Riker quickly cuts off the comms as Troi asks what that was about before Riker points out that they are still at Red Alert and they need to keep fighting the Pakleds, leading Troi to grumble "We'll talk about this later."
-   In **The Simpsons**:
    -   In "The Springfield Connection", Marge becomes an officer in the Springfield Police Department. One day, she gives Lisa a tour of the Springfield Police Station.
