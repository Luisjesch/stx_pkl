Cheek Copy: 
_Now is not a good time to photocopy your butt and staple it to your boss's face — oh no!_

A standard juvenile office prank, where the subject drops their trousers, plants their rear end against the glass of a photocopy machine and presses start. Hilarious!

Don't Try This at Home, kids. See "Real Life" below to find out why. Mooning is this trope's more direct cousin, with the advantage of this trope being that it can be done both in advance and not in range of retaliation by the victim. Subtrope of Joke of the Butt.

High-level butts are formidable opponents, and a great way to powerlevel early in the game because they never get to attack first.

    -   Another moment has him reveal that merely reciting the teacher's copy machine code makes his butt feel warm.
    -   In the **Treehouse of Horror** story where the world plunges into the technological apocalypse that was thought to have happened because of the Y2K virus (thanks to Homer not updating the computers at the nuclear plant), Nelson breaks into school to photocopy his butt.

    -   The episode "Copy Machine" revolved around this. While trying to copy his butt, Beavis ends up falling through the glass. Soon the fire department is called in to get him out with a local news crew covering the story. They're worried that his femoral artery may be cut, meaning he could bleed out if they get him out. Butt-head tries to activate the machine (wanting to see his "female artery") which makes him pop out.

-   Done by accident in **The Amazing World of Gumball**: Gumball thought laying across a high-definition scanner naked would let him enter the internet, but instead just sent a scan to Darwin, who was operating the computer (and started washing his eyes immediately thereafter). Although, because he was standing in the same position the T-800 took when time-traveling, it wasn't his butt Darwin got an eyeful of.
-   **Oh No! It's An Alien Invasion**: In one episode the kids attempt to set a new world record for doing this, only to be beaten by the aliens who have a photocopier that produces its own paper.

Muscle Man gleefully adds "That's not even a picture of our mom. It's a picture of my buttcheek I just squished it up to look like a woman's face!".

Tarakotchi and Zattchi demonstrate how to work the photo copier they've chosen to be Tamagotchi Museum's Earth exhibit by using it to copy Cosmotchi's face onto Tarakotchi's belly. Tarakotchi somehow gets the copied face to **whistle**.
    
    **Cosmotchi:** Not my best side... but I like it!
    
-   A G-rated version in **Arthur** when Binky photocopies his face pressed against the glass while making copies for a school assignment.
-   **T.U.F.F. Puppy**:

Cheek Copy Example in Real Life

-   Yes, people have done this in Real Life, and there are many reasons why you shouldn't:
    -   The most obvious is that you're putting some highly sensitive body parts on top of fragile glass, beneath which are moving metal parts and electrical wiring. People (being roughly a hundred times the weight of the heaviest book) can — and do — fall through the glass (like the guy in this viral security camera footage). One study reported that approximately 15% of major copier repairs are the result of people attempting this trope.
    -   Many copy machines are digital these days, and they remember when recent copies were made, which helps them narrow down who might have made the copy.
    -   Any copies acquired by your coworkers may be used in ways detrimental to your promotion prospects (although if your superiors can recognize your specific rear end, they probably weren't that great to start with).
    -   It can get you fired. Or, if not fired, at least demoted or suspended without pay, or forced to attend Sensitivity Training, or could get your pay docked.
    -   It wastes toner. Hey, high schools aren't made of money.
-   A variant prank is to make enough photocopies of your butt that you can tape them end to end (so to speak) in a chain. Feed the chain into a scroll-fed fax machine, enter the fax number of someone you don't like, and when one end comes out, tape it to the other end. You are now sending an infinite series of butts to the other end (or at least wasted all their toner). Try not to do this at an office building, though, where they'll discover your prank through the exorbitant phone bill you've racked up in the process. Even if you do this at home, 1. Most fax machines also have caller ID circuitry built right in and will print your number and other condemning messages on the top of the page, fingering you as the culprit, and 2. Hope you don't mind the incredibly exorbitant phone bill you're going to rack up pulling off this prank, particularly if the recipient is out of state (or worse, in a different country).
