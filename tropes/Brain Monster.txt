Brain Monster: 
**Andross:** Only I have the brains to rule Lylat!  
**Fox McCloud:** So, Andross, you show your true form.

The brain. A big, juicy, wrinkled organ on our head that is protected by the skull for a good reason. Now, imagine when it's not...

There are two types of monstrous brains:

-   **Just Brain**: The brain moves around by itself. It might have some bits attached, such as legs, hovering jets or helicopter rudders, but its main "body" is a brain. Alternatively, it is stationary and attached to something. If these brain monsters have other body parts, like eyes, a mouth and/or appendages, they will be attached directly to their brain.
-   **Acranial Monster**: A monster that has an incomplete skull, thus exposing their brain.

A sister-trope of Brain in a Jar, although a lot of these brains don't really need the jar life-support system, as well as the furthest extension of My Brain Is Big.

Subtrope of Evil Is Visceral and Body Horror, and thusly, is always played for Nausea Fuel. Compare with Oculothorax, where the monster is a giant eye.

Brain Monster Example in Tabletop Games

    -   The Intellect Devourer is basically a brain running around on four little legs. Its modus operandi is to crack a victim's skull open, remove the brain and then squeeze inside, taking over the body.

Some sources say that illithids create them by transforming a humanoid's brain, but according to other the intellect devourer is an alien species that starts life as a smaller, less intelligent brain creature that also has tentacles called an ustilagor which loses the tentacles when they become an adult.

-   **Warhammer 40,000**: Several Tyranid creatures, especially those with strong psychic powers, have partially exposed brains.
-   **Eclipse Phase**: One of the usual adversaries are the Exhumans, a rather diverse group of radical body modificationists, evilutionary biologists, and wannabe evil overlords, having very little in common besides all agreeing that (trans-) humanity has run its course and will be replaced by them. "Brain on spider legs diabolical mastermind with a God complex" is common enough to be an in-universe category in itself.
