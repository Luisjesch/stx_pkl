Bed Full of Women: 
Dyno-mite, Dyno-mite!

There are many ways for a man to express power. One of them is having several women in his bed, presumably there for more than just body heat and implying the man also has the sexual stamina to _deal_ with that many women. The man will never be in the bed with them, of course—he's off at the balcony or window, brooding about the plot.

Note that we never see the bed before or during all the presumed action—only the aftermath, with the women asleep and the man awake. One woman may wake to converse with him, but only one. How much the sheets cover or how much the women are wearing depends on what rating and audience the media is targeting.

Compare Sexy Man, Instant Harem, The Pornomancer, and A Lady on Each Arm. The ladies may be members of a Royal Harem. A subtrope of Men Are Tough and Women Are Delicate: in this case, sexual prowess is equivalent to toughness/power and a multitude of women are submissive to the dominant man.

Bed Full of Women Example in Anime & Manga

-   In **Berserk**, we are introduced to imprisoned war criminal Wyald like this, in a room full of naked women, only that it's very much NOT a before or after scene. Also, to add to the Fan Disservice and to show what kind of character we're dealing with here, none of the women are there of their will, and most of them are **dead**.
-   In **Fushigi Yuugi**, the Emperor of Kutou talks to Nakago while in bed with three concubines.
-   Happens various times to Issei in **High School Dx D** throughout the story, starting with Rias and Asia and expanding in number as Issei gains the love of another girl through the seasons and volumes, though the crowning example is at the start of Volume 14. He even gets kicked out his own bed by Xenovia due to just how many girls are beside him (and Xenovia's poor sleeping posture).
-   In **Jojos Bizarre Adventure**, Part 3, DIO's almost perpetually in one of these situations... except most of the women there are implied to be **dead**; he sees them mostly as food. He's a sexy vampire.
-   In **Legend of the Galactic Heroes**, one corrupt governor surrounds himself with half-naked concubines.
-   Happened to Yuuto in the last chapter of **Omamori Himari** while his consciousness is separated from his body. When he returns to his body, he awakes to find out that over half of his harem had their way with him in his sleep.

Bed Full of Women Example in Comic Books

-   In **Ultimate Marvel**, the Hulk disappears to Tibet, where he is eventually found by Wolverine. When we first see the big green man, he's surrounded by **hundreds** of naked/half-naked women, with the implication that he's slept with and skillfully satisfied all of them. Like we said, he's a big green man.
-   In **Fury MAX**, the framing sequence has Nick Fury writing his memoirs with three prostitutes lying asleep and exhausted in bed behind him.
-   In his earlier appearances in **Punisher MAX**, also by Garth Ennis, Fury similarly tells the Punisher that he plans to have sex with "every hooker in New York City." We see him get a start on it via this trope.
-   Gender-swapped in the "Obsidian Age" arc of **Justice League of America**, where one scene shows proto-Amazon Sela waking up in a bed full of naked or half-naked men.
-   In **Project Superpowers**, Truth and Dare find Captain Future in bed with several scantly-clad women, all of them nearly dead from exhaustion.

Bed Full of Women Example in Films — Live-Action

-   Bill the Butcher from **Gangs of New York** had a bed full of women after spending the night in a whorehouse recovering from a bullet wound to the shoulder earlier that day. It's indicated that he's a regular there.
-   A Deleted Scene in **xXx** shows Yorgi the morning after a big party, on a bed with three sleeping women. The scene was done in case the film was given an R-rating (for violence) so the audience would feel they'd got their money's worth. The movie itself has him walking off with this harem of girls the day before, but only sleeping with one of them.
-   **Black Dynamite** parodies this by showing the eponymous hero in bed with women, and after he gets out of bed, **even more** women are revealed to be hidden in the bedroom.

-   **Enter the Dragon** shows Williams relaxing in his room, along with the four women that he had previously chosen to spend the night there.
-   The opening scene of **Piccadilly Jim** has the title character waking up in such a bed after a hard night of partying.
-   Early in **The Shadow**, when Lamont is still Ying Ko, there's a brief scene with Lamont in bed with several women. It's never stated whether they're paid women, sex slaves, or voluntarily serving him in that fashion, but whichever is correct the scene shows that Lamont is top dog in the area.
-   **Riddick**: After Riddick has been crowned the new Lord Marshal of the Necromongers, he's seen lounging in the Marshal's private quarters where there's a bed full of royal consorts. In a subversion, this is made to appear sinister, as Riddick suspects they're just there to make him let down his guard and kill him in his sleep.
-   Played for Laughs in **Machete Kills**. Machete places a call to the President of the United States. The phone is picked up by a sleepy yet hot female White House intern, who hands it to another female intern in the bed beside her, who hands it to **another** female intern, who hands the phone to the President.
-   Exaggerated in **The Italian Job (1969)**. Michael Caine gets out of prison to find an entire **room** full of women waiting for him, courtesy of his organised crime friends.
-   **The Transporter Refueled**. After spending a night with the main female character, the protagonist Frank Martin goes into another room to find his Retired Badass father sleeping with two other women. Rather than feel outclassed, Frank just smiles. It's implied his father used to be a spy for British Intelligence.
-   When filming **El Mariachi**, the actor playing Azul said he'd only appear in the film if he could have this trope. Director Robert Rodriguez explained that they weren't making a porn movie, but if he could find the women then Azul could have a couple of female bodyguards instead. So in the movie, Azul wakes up with these two girls, then has to go out. One of his mooks sneaks over to have a look and maybe sample the goods, only to flee when he has several guns stuck in his face.
-   **The Nutty Professor (1996)**: Buddy Love sleeps with a bunch of girls at one point. The next morning, Buddy reverts to fat Sherman Klump, who is horrified to wake up surrounded by a bunch of girls he doesn't know.
-   By the end of **Young Lady Chatterley II**, Virgil (who started the film a shy virgin) has all five maids in his bed at the one time.

Bed Full of Women Example in Literature

-   Some post-Victorian adaptations of **Dracula** treat Dracula's three vampiric "brides" as an example of this trope to support the idea that Vampires Are Sex Gods, since the originally intended audience revulsion at Dracula's licentiousness isn't necessarily shared by the adaptation's creators or audience.
-   **The Belgariad**: King Drosta Lek Thun often holds court from a fully occupied bed in a seedy brothel. It's (partially) a political maneuver — he can't refuse to meet priests from the local Religion of Evil, but he **can** make the audience so uncomfortable that they prefer to avoid him.

Bed Full of Women Example in Live-Action TV

-   **All The Queens Men**: In the episode "Bait and Switch", club owner Madam tries to cheer up her despondent bodyguard, Blue, by sending 5 women over to her place.

    **Voiceover:** But what of the idiot's private life? How about his relationship with women?

    **Idiot:** Well, I may be an idiot, but I'm no fool.
    
-   In the penultimate episode of **30 Rock**, Jack Donaghy sets out to excel in every area of his life. As part of this, he manages to convince his two **very** Catholic ex-girlfriends, Nancy Donovan and Elisa, into a **menage a trois** that not only leaves the two women satisfied but somehow leaves them both speaking with impeccable British RP accents. (While there are fewer women than usual in this example, the absurd aftereffects seem to push things into a parody of this trope.)
-   This is part of Pierce's fantasy sequence in the **Community** episode "Horror Fiction In Seven Spooky Steps": as "Magnum", he's sleeping with all three women in the study group at once and has a Gag Penis to boot.
-   **Babylon 5**:
    -   Slightly downplayed in an early episode where Na'Toth visits G'Kar in his quarters early in the morning. He answers the door to her in a nightshirt, and during their conversation she is irritated when three scantily-clad human women, implied to be hookers, come out of the bedroom.
    -   Downplayed a bit further in the finale, where Emperor Vir is in bed with two Centauri women when a Ranger arrives with an invitation to Sheridan's farewell. Justified in that Centauri males are equipped with six tentacles.
-   Invoked in **Game of Thrones**. King Robert, a known whoremonger, stations his brother-in-law Jaime Lannister outside his bedchamber while he parties with hookers, which we can hear from behind the closed door. Ned walks up, and while he and Jaime discuss matters, every so often a girl leaves the bedroom **but the room is still just as loud as before.**
-   In **Ted Lasso**, exuberant football player Dani Rojas is seen in a bed with two women as he wakes up from a bad dream, during the first episode of the second season.
-   The last scene of the **Red Dwarf** episode "Can of Worms" shows Cat sharing a bed with the two lady cats he keeps telling the other Dwarfers he knows on Z Deck. Of course, this is All Just a Dream.

-   **Catherine:** In the "Best Catherine" ending, the main character has moved in with the eponymous heroine in The Underworld and after spending a lengthy amount of time there has transformed into an incubus like his girlfriend. He's become so powerful (and, apparently, so skilled at sex) that in addition to Catherine, he's surrounded by several other succubi who moan and fawn over him.
-   **God of War**:
    -   Kratos never accumulates more than two per bed, yet he still manages to sleep with nearly that many per game, with each of them always commending his abilities. As the titular God of War he can be seen with two at his side.
    -   Ghost of Sparta hits the trope full on when a harem literally dog-piles on Kratos' (offscreen, except for shaking bedposts) bed after hearing and seeing his exploits with the initial and usual two that accompany him.

-   **Unsounded**: Duane is given a bedroom full of prostitutes at the Deadly Nevergreen in order to distract him. This does not work as intended given Duane is a married priest who lost all touch sensation, beyond phantom pains, years ago as his flesh rotted. He instead bores the women to sleep by reading from a very dry wordy religious text.
