Commonality Connection: 
_Once in a hotel dining-room, I said, rather too loudly, "I loathe prunes."  
"So do I," came an unexpected six-year-old voice from another table.  
Sympathy was instantaneous. Neither of us thought it funny. We both knew that prunes are far too nasty to be funny. That is the proper meeting between man and child as independent personalities._

— **C. S. Lewis**, "On Three Ways of Writing For Children"

Two characters, strangers or hostile to each other, accidentally discover a common thing. It can be an interest, a past experience or a background, but it foments friendship between them. For dramatic purposes, this is often between extremely different characters.

It can also mark the deepening of an existing relationship.

Lies can sometimes backfire when another character thinks it's this trope; see I Am One of Those, Too.

Compare Fire-Forged Friends; note that merely finding they were both soldiers or the like is this, though if they fought in some of the same battles, it may shade into that. For much more extensive commonalities, see Birds of a Feather. Also compare Lonely Together.

Contrast "Not So Different" Remark and Opposites Attract. Supertrope of Bonding over Missing Parents and A Shared Suffering. The lack of this drives Joins to Fit In. Examples that do not precede a friendship may go under The One Thing I Don't Hate About You.

Commonality Connection Example in Comic Books

-   **Aquaman**: Black Manta, an African-American supervillain, has on occasion exploited solidarity to get other Black people to help him, most notably in the Silver Age when he conned a bunch of black men to serve as his henchmen and even get surgery to breathe underwater by claiming he was trying to create a Black homeland underwater. It’s clearly a trick, since Manta doesn’t care about racism or feel any kind of kinship with other Black people.

    **\[Luther thinks of Allison\]**  
    **\[Diego thinks of Vanya\]**  
    "-I love you."

Commonality Connection Example in Web Original

    **Critic:** Those are the best.

-   **Sword Art Online Abridged** makes both Kirito and Kayaba into this who both complain about the other players of the game as annoying pissants, considers themselves a massive cut above normal people due to their intellect, but what really clinches the deal for Kayaba is that Kirito is as big of a Movie Nerd as he is, and they both love to spout movie quotes that nobody else gets; it was one of the many things that allowed for Kirito to deduce Kayabas' secret identity as Heathcliff.
    
    **Kirito:** You're the only one I've ever met in this game who makes as many movie references as I do.  
    **Kayaba:** Ah yes, I guess I should have known that would... Wait. **You get my references?!**  
    **Kirito:** Um, yes. I just remembered-  
    **Kayaba:** "There Can Be Only One."  
    **Kirito:** Oh, ah **Highlander**.

    **Kirito:** **Duck Soup** Marx Brothers, 1933.  
    **Kayaba:** "DRY LAND IS NOT A MYTH! I HAVE **SEEEEN IIITTTT!!**"

Commonality Connection Example in Real Life

-   C. S. Lewis recounts in **Surprised By Joy** when he went to visit a sick neighbor when he was a boy.

-   Psychologists found that in an experiment where people could punish their partners for errors, if you told the people that the (invisible) partner had a thumbprint that was classified in the same group as them, they would punish this partner less.

-   Starring together on **Star Trek: The Original Series**, William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy became friends in no small part thanks to learning they were both Jewish (Nimoy had an Orthodox Jewish upbringing, Shatner had a Reform Jewish upbringing).

-   Cops who play the "Good Cop" in interrogation will often start off "befriending" the suspect by chatting with them about sports, etc., or claiming to understand their feelings of anger towards the victim. Many suspects will inevitably slip up.
-   Similarly, this is a tactic used to survive being held hostage or taken prisoner by enemy soldiers. Enforcing your humanity to them to elicit sympathy and sharing similarities such as children you both have or even mutual interests makes it harder for them to mistreat you since they begin to connect with you on a personal level and no longer merely see you as "prisoners." Even something as simple as looking a gunman in the eye makes it more difficult for them to shoot you by evoking this.
