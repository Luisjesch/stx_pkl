Carnival of Killers: 
A Carnival of Killers occurs when a villain either hires the best assassins from around the world and sends them after the hero, or puts out an open contract on the hero's head that attracts a variety of assassins. A typical Carnival of Killers will involve a large collection of assassins with radically different styles (e.g., a Cold Sniper, a Mad Bomber, etc.), and sometimes will include last season villains that have since fallen below the Sorting Algorithm of Evil's current threshold. The assassins may work together, albeit with a tendency to eventually betray each, or be in open competition from the outset.

In a story that wishes to evoke an "international" flavor, all the killers may make no secret of their creepy foreignness and might even dress as mildly absurd ethnic stereotypes. It's not unusual for some of them to be political radicals or even terrorists who are taking a break from their usual "hobbies."

Compare Legion of Doom and Quirky Miniboss Squad. Not comparable to Circus of Fear, unless being chased by the world's top assassins posing as clowns is the hero's worst fear.

Compare and contrast Ragtag Bunch of Misfits, who are usually the protagonists and/or the focus of the story who are just as radically different individually as this trope.

Carnival of Killers Example in Anime & Manga

-   Describes the rest of the world for anyone who puts on the Number 2 Headband in **Afro Samurai**: Afro routinely fought gangs of heavily armed killers determined to take the headband from him, even when he was just minding his own business.
-   **Akame ga Kill!** is a subversion of the usual formula since the Carnival of Killers are the protagonists. Night Raid accepts assassination contracts on the corrupt and powerful.
-   **Akuma no Riddle** is about a girl who's the target of twelve assassins, until one of them decides to defend her instead. From that on, it's "only" eleven.
-   In **Arachnid**, Alice Fuji is made the target of such a game by an organization of insect-themed assassins. However, the reward for killing her gets increased for every assassin that dies, implying one purpose of this is to set them against each other and weed out the weak members of the organization.
-   The many and various groups and individuals trying to kill Bambi and retrieve the stolen child in **Bambi And Her Pink Gun**, which include a gang of smuggling truckers in rigs bigger than most battleships, a powerful mafia family, a posse of biker cowboys, a cyborg luchadore, and psychopathic rock star Gabba King.
-   In **Berserk**, we have the "Bakiraka" an elite group of Kushan Assassins led by Silat. Then there's the "Black Dog Knights", a not so elite group of murdering scum led by the biggest murdering scumbag of them all: Wyald. Both are employed by the King of Midland to track down the outlawed Band of the Hawk.
-   Happens twice in **Black Lagoon**, once in response to the Vampire Twins, and once in response to Greenback Jane. In the second example, one of the episodes of the arc is even called "The Roanapur Freakshow Circus". (It sums up a lot about **Black Lagoon** when you point out that several of the characters involved then end up working **with** the heroes in the "Baile de la Muerte" arc.)
    -   It sums up more when you realize that two of the characters defending the target during the second carnival participated in the first.
-   The aptly-named "International Assassins" story arc from **Chainsaw Man** plays with this in typically offbeat, subversive faction. Of the four assassin units hired to capture protagonist Denji, one is taken out largely by accident, the second forms a temporary alliance with the protagonists against a common enemy, and the third party turns out to actually be a non-sentient puppet for the fourth and most insidious assassin, who then becomes the common enemy the second allies with the protagonists against.
-   Happens in the Yorknew City Arc of **Hunter × Hunter**. After the Phantom Troupe has proven to be too much for the Mafia to handle alone, by killing their Praetorian Guard, the Elders call in the most famous assassins in the world to finish them off, including Killua's father and grandfather.
-   The villains in Part 3 of **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure** embody this concept. The main villain, Dio, hires a group of assassins in order to kill the heroes, or at least slow them down long enough for him to reach his full strength. These assassins come from all over the world, have a large variety of backgrounds (one habitually crashed planes and trains For the Evulz, one was a habitual gambler) have a large variety of ways in which they kill (stealing your soul by beating you in a high stakes game, killing you in your dreams, or simply shooting you with a gun with seeking bullets), include some incredibly strange individuals (including a sentient sword, a bird, and a **baby**), and some even embody stereotypes (like Hol Horse, a modern-day cowboy).
    -   Part 4 contains a lighter version of this. The early villains were all empowered by one man, but his goal wasn't to assassinate the heroes and most of the early villains fought the heroes for their own reasons. This changes in the latter half of the story, where the new villain's father is empowering people on the fly in order to find someone who can stop the heroes from tracking down his son. This ends up including such characters as a gangster granted the power to drain people's life forces, a cat that comes back from the dead as a plant, a kid who can steal your energy by winning in rock-paper-scissors, and a man who can fold you into paper if he sees your fear.
    -   Part 5 contains its own variant, where the group of assassins are all from a mafia family that the protagonists **also belong to**. The heroes want to overthrow the boss and create a nicer mafia, but they're tasked with guarding the boss' daughter who becomes a target for everyone else. While the villains mostly belonging to a single Italian gang means less variety in certain aspects, the villains still showcase a wide variety of approaches and designs.
-   Frequently ended up on the wrong end of Oogami Itto's sword in **Lone Wolf and Cub**. Hired by the Yagyu clan, until the situation got desperate enough that they revealed themselves to wear this mantle as well.
-   A favorite trope of **Lupin III**:
    -   The **Lupin III: The Italian Adventure**, plays with it by having the colorful group of assassins include Goemon. They are secretly assembled by a rising Italian politician to kill a ruthless African dictator. Turns out the politician just wanted unrestricted access to the dictator's oil fields, and he has his own mole within the assassins turn on their cohorts to keep his secret.
    -   **Lupin III: Part 5** plays the trope straight in the first part of the series when the dark web site Marco Polo sets a wild band of killers on Lupin as revenge for him stealing the hacker behind their success.
-   The Seven Warlords of the Sea in **One Piece** — to a degree, as not all of them are antagonistic towards Luffy. CP9 probably counts as a straighter example, and they're actual assassins as opposed to the Warlords...
    -   Baroque Works plays this straight. Oddly enough, until the Alabasta Arc, neither of them knew the identities of the other members (besides their partner) or even their **leader**.
-   **Spy X Family**: Yor is assigned to protect Olka Gretcher and her infant son from dozens of assassins sent to kill them as they escape Ostania on a cruise ship. Hilariously, at one point, two such assassins attempt to invoke this trope by introducing themselves in a hammy fashion, only to get cut down immediately.
    
    **Esmerelda, Master of Wires:** Now you face Esmerelda, Master of Wires!  
    \[**Yor kills her**\]  
    **King of Chakrams:** I am the King of Chak-  
    \[**Yor kills him**\]
    
-   The second half of the anime **Trigun** is about Vash trying to stay alive while keeping the 12 Gung Ho Guns at bay as they come at him.
-   In **Until Death Do Us Part**, one of these was called against Mamoru by Edge Turus. Notable in that the "target" then spread the word that he'd be in a certain location at a specific time, and when they gathered there, took out the assassins all at once.
-   In **Yaiba** the Seven Revenant Swordsmen summoned by Onimaru during the Ryuujin Orbs arc, who are all famous warriors from the past, including monks, ninjas, samurai, and a Warrior Poet assassin.

-   An early arc in **Punisher: War Zone** had the New York mob hiring the seven best assassins in the world to hunt down the Punisher. Such things are something of an occupational hazard for The Punisher.
    -   Deconstructed in **The Punisher: Welcome Back, Frank**, where a gangster employs three badass killers to take out the Punisher. The first guy is a Martial Arts expert "with a black belt in anything you care to name." Punisher says that he "knows a little myself", but settles on simply shoving the guy onto a subway track.

-   The Red Triangle Circus Gang in **Batman Returns** is about as literal as this trope can possibly get. True to their name, they are indeed ex-circus performers and continue to dress as clowns, acrobats, and various other circus people while serving as the Penguin's shock troops, apparently because Crime Doesn't Pay. More to the point of this trope, they function as a sort of highly anarchic guerrilla fighting force with every weapon known to man: machine guns, rocket launchers, ninja weapons, and various incendiary devices.

This theme continues in **John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum**, which deals with John Wick trying to survive the aforementioned massive bounty on his head, and **John Wick: Chapter 4**, where John has a chance to get the bounty lifted... but only if he makes it to a certain place by a certain time, and the villain has a vested interest in making sure that John arrives late if at all.

Carnival of Killers Example in Literature

-   The Carnivale in **Agent G: Infiltrator** is a literal example of this. Albeit, the name just reflects that they tend to be more colorful than other assassins, giving themselves badass names and being less careful about collateral damage than other groups.
-   **Best Served Cold**:
    -   For one of her assassinations, Monza and co. hire a bunch of performers/killers, including a juggler/killer and a band of killers.
    -   When Duke Orso finds out that Monza is still alive, he has the best assassins and bounty hunters brought to him and offers them a big reward for killing her.
    -   Monza and her group would be a Carnival of Killers themselves were they not the protagonists: lead by a mercenary with a terrible reputation (Monza herself), the group has a Barbarian Hero (Shivers), a Master Poisoner (Morveer) and apprentice (Day), a freelance Torture Technician and Information Broker (Vitari), a backstabbing mercenary (Cosca), and a number-obsessed mob enforcer (Friendly).
-   **The Destroyer: The Last Alchemist** had an interesting variation of this. The Dragon as part of his backstory participated in an open contract on a crimelord. After he killed the target, he was given a job as the personal assassin of the Big Bad who had placed the contract simply to find a suitable person for the position. The trope appeared in a few other books in the series as well.

-   **Monster Blood Tattoo**: Europe and Rossamund have to fight their way through a number of hired killers at the midpoint and at the climax of Book Three.
-   In **Nobody Lives for Ever**, the dying leader of SPECTRE places (literally) a prize on the head of James Bond, which brings opportunistic killers from various organizations after him. However, SPECTRE has no intention to pay any of them, and instead uses them to find and herd Bond to their base in Florida, where they are going to claim his head by themselves with a guillotine.
-   This is what happens in **No Country for Old Men** after Moss steals the money. He has numerous Mexican mooks, Professional Killer Carson Wells, and Psycho for Hire Anton Chigurh after him.
-   In the Roger Zelazny book **Roadmarks** the antagonist declares a "Black Decade" on the protagonist, legally permitting ten attempts to kill him. Agents may be employed... and so ten highly skilled assassins/hunters have been hired from the entire range of Earth's histories (including alternate pasts and futures). This includes an assassin robot, a genetically enhanced and cybernetic super-soldier, and a martial arts master.

-   In **A Song of Ice and Fire**, Tywin Lannister employs a carnival of killers for "foraging" missions, which is essentially sending armed men to plunder and murder the enemy's peasants. His troupe includes a mercenary gang called the Brave Companions but nicknamed the Bloody Mummers, which is almost literally a carnival of killers, right down to a Monster Clown, the fool Shagwell who kills people for not laughing at his jokes. In fitting with the spirit of the trope, the group is also extensively multicultural, and individual members often have their own signature derangements. They are led by Vargo Hoat, his long beard and helmet with horns lead to him being nicknamed the goat. However he's a sadistic psychopath who enjoys cutting off limbs, and even his laughable Speech Impediment is sinister, due to it coming from him catching a disease from raping someone.
-   In **The Spirit Thief**, as the combined bounty for Eli, Nico and Josef eventually exceeds 600,000 gold standards, everyone and their dog is out to get them, including master swordsmen, unnoticeable men, spiritualists, League of Storms, random bounty hunters and one very angry empress.
-   **Spy School**: In **Spy School: Project X**, a bounty on Ben attracts many professional and amateur killers. They include most of the recurring villains from earlier books, a Mafia goon, a pilot in a stolen military jet, an eyepatch-wearing woman who legally changed her name to Myrtle Combat, an arrogant couple who drive a sports car and wear bodysuits, two hunters who believe a Conspiracy Theory the Big Bad started claiming that Ben is an evil alien (which eliminates any moral qualms they have about Hunting the Most Dangerous Game), a ninja, a woman who looks like a suburban mom, a woman in a fancy gown, and a man dressed like **Mad Max**.
-   **Warhammer 40,000**: In the **Gaunt's Ghosts** book **Sabbat Martyr**, the plot centers on the Ghosts defending the reincarnated saint Sabbat from nine would-be assassins, dispatched against her by the Arc Villain Enok Innokenti.

Carnival of Killers Example in Live-Action TV

-   In the **The Amazing Extraordinary Friends** episode "Quality Time", Renfield hires the 'world's greatest super assassins' (the Invisible Ninja, Captain Tardy, Geyser Girl, and the Easter Bunny) to eliminate the Friends.
-   **The A-Team**:
    -   The episode **Deadly Maneuvers** had a syndicate of crime lords pay Major Douglas Kyle to assemble a Dream Team of mercenaries to hunt down the A-Team.
    -   The episode "Waiting for Insane Wayne" had Insane Wayne and his team of mercenaries-for-hire who the team briefly impersonates then ends up fighting.
-   **Babylon 5** had another protagonist example. In "Objects in Motion", Garibaldi learns, but can't prove, that the board of Edgars Industries is trying to have him assassinated. As part of his response, he arranges to put large bounties on all their heads if anything happens to him or Lise.
-   **Barry**: VERY briefly used in "a nice meal" when Hank hires the F.U.B.Ks (Four Ultimate Badass Killers), consisting of a knife fighter, an explosives expert, an ex-Special Forces operative, and a sharpshooter. He sends them to take care of Fuches... who promptly sends their boxed heads back to Hank's office.
-   Unusually used in the **Blackadder** episode "The Black Seal", where it's the **protagonist** who assembles a team of the biggest bastards in all of England (including himself, naturally) to carry out a fiendish plan. They all turn on him in favor of an even BIGGER bastard by the end of the episode.
-   **Blindspot**: In the Season 3 episode "Clamorous Night", Roman puts a hit on the FBI team. The only specifically unique assassin in the group is one who likes using poisons; the rest stick to good old-fashioned guns and knives.
-   There was an episode of the 80s **Bret Maverick** TV series where an author who writes westerns hires a Carnival of Killers to take out professional gambler Bret Maverick, so he'd have an ending to his latest book that's more exciting than "And he retired with a saloon and a cattle ranch."
-   At least Once A Season on **Buffy the Vampire Slayer**. For example, in season 2:
    
    **Dalton**: Uh, yes, but... The Order of Taraka, I mean... isn't that overkill?
    
    **Spike**: No, I think it's just enough kill.
    
    -   In "Homecoming", the Carnival Of Killers is combined with Hunting the Most Dangerous Game. Several killers are hired to hunt Buffy and Faith (accidentally replaced by Cordelia), including Cain the werewolf hunter, vampire Lyle Gorch and his wife Candy, and the blade-throwing demon Kulak.
    -   A nice subversion is in the episode "Angel", where the Master hires the Three, three apparently badass vampires to take down Buffy. In their first encounter with her, she manages to barely escape with Angel's help (who kills one of them)...and the Master, incensed that they failed, has Darla kill all of the Three, making their scenes a total of **two**. They weren't the real threat of the episode; that happened to be Darla herself.
-   In **The Cape**, the Big Bad Chess occasionally hires members of an assassin order called Tarot, each of whom specializes in a different skill. Cain is a poison expert, while the Goggles and Hicks duo (brothers) specialize in surveillance. After one too many failures, Chess refuses to have any more dealings with the Tarot. Ironically, he does this moments before Hicks would have revealed the true identity of the Cape. However, since he no longer works for Chess, Hicks feels no obligation to hand over the information and, instead, uses it to bargain with the Cape for the location of his captured brother.
-   **Dead Man's Gun**: In "Death Warrant", John Pike—a ruthless, hard-bitten bounty hunter carrying the Dead Man's Gun—accidentally kills an innocent young man in a shoot-out. The mother of the dead boy puts a bounty on Pike's head, and he finds himself being hunted by every bounty hunter, hired gun, and chancer across three states.
-   Max faces one in the **Get Smart** episode "Someone Down Here Hates Me" when KAOS puts a $250,000 bounty on his head (and later ups it to $500,000).
-   **Gunsmoke**, In "Reward for Matt", a woman offers a $1,000 reward to the man who kills Matt Dillon after Matt killed her husband while attempting to bring him in for murder. This was a Recycled Script from an episode of the radio show.
-   This is set up in **NCIS** by Alejandro Rivera in "Honor Thy Father", who arranges a break on a prison ship with any and all escapees ordered to kill Gibbs. End result? **Only one escapee**, who then hires a mercenary to also kill Gibbs for a Batman Gambit, but both are offed by him instead.
-   **Obi-Wan Kenobi**. After her fellow Inquisitors cut Reva out of the hunt for Obi-Wan, she sends out an open contract on Obi-Wan to every bounty hunter in the city. However Reva doesn't think the bounty hunters are good enough to kill or capture the legendary Jedi—it's only meant to flush him out into the open so she can take him down herself.
-   **Person of Interest**
    -   In "The Crossing", John Reese and his Friend on the Force Joss Carter have to flee an open bounty placed on them by HR, an organisation of corrupt police.
    -   In "4C", Reese has to battle five assassins from three different organisations (Mossad, The Cartel, and his former employers in the US government) who are trying to kill the Victim of the Week in four separate ways.
-   **Sherlock**: In "The Reichenbach Fall", a group of international assassins appear around Sherlock, although initially they appear to be keeping Holmes alive. Ultimately, it is revealed they have been hired by Moriarty to kill Holmes' friends if Holmes refuses to kill himself.
-   **White Collar** had one of the **protagonists** calling on a carnival of killers, when Mozzie places a six million dollar bounty on Keller who killed one of their friends and was threatening them.

Carnival of Killers Example in Pro Wrestling

-   Steven Richards, Thuggin and Buggin Enterprises, La Résistance, Tommy Dreamer and Batista all tried to get the money Triple H was offering to whoever would take out Goldberg for him.
-   Vince McMahon issued a contract on D-Generation X (Shawn Michaels and Triple H) in the summer of 2006 when DX was running amok on **Monday Night Raw**. Both Chris Masters and Eugene (who, being a babyface, didn't bear DX any ill will but just liked the idea of getting a reward) failed to collect, so Vince enlisted the help of Cuban businessman Armando Alejandro Estrada, who actually succeeded for a time in getting Triple H sent to jail after framing him for having smuggled Cuban cigars into the country. There were even hints that non-wrestling personnel could get involved: Vince boasted that he and his son Shane McMahon had access to "unlimited resources", causing DX to retort, "Bring in anybody from the street - we don't care." Eventually, at **SummerSlam**, the McMahons had Big Show, Mr. Kennedy, and King Booker's Court (Sir William Regal and Sir Fit Finlay) rough up Shawn and Hunter before Vince and Shane even set foot in the ring - and DX **still** won.
-   During 2011, Bob Sapp sent several "assassins", including Jonathan Gresham, Ryan Genesis, Cho-un Shiryu, Dragon Chen, and Ryoma Li, into Dramatic Dream Team for the purpose of ridding it of Danshoku Dino. Gaylon Summers of GOUGE was the one to finally defeat Dino in a match, but he didn't succeed in making him leave DDT, and Dino eventually did defeat Gaylon for good.

Carnival of Killers Example in Radio

-   Was the general idea of the **Gunsmoke** episode "Reward for Matt". Mrs. Hornby gets pretty mad when Marshal Dillon kills her husband. She offers $1000 to anyone who kills Dillon. The script was later reused for an episode of the **Gunsmoke** TV series.

Carnival of Killers Example in Tabletop Games

-   **Warhammer 40,000**: While the Officio Assassinorum normally sends one or two agents out to deal with their targets, an especially dangerous opponent can result in the deployment of an Execution Force, which includes assassins from multiple Assassin Temples. As reveal in the **Horus Heresy** novel **Nemesis**, the very first Execution Force created was given a truly momentous task - assassinate Horus. They failed, with one of their own even noting the odds of victory were below twenty five percent. A second force was deployed to kill Lord Drask (which forms the plot of a spin-off game), while a third one was apparently deployed during the Second Damocles Gulf War to take down high ranking T'au in the conflict. The Culexus assassin succeeds in killing Aun'va.

Carnival of Killers Example in Video Games

-   A constant theme in the first **Baldur's Gate** game is a never-ending stream of bounty hunters and assassins attacking the protagonist. Unusual in that the protagonist didn't do anything to screw the Big Bad's plans; all the assassination attempts are simply for him or her existing.
-   The basic premise behind **Batman: Arkham Origins** is that Black Mask put a fifty million dollar bounty on Batman's head, and eight professional killers show up trying to collect, though Lady Shiva and Deadshot are only encountered in side quests missions, and the third side-mission-only mini-boss Anarky is **not** one of the eight.
-   In **Criminal Case: World Edition**, the Arc Villains of each world region and even a few minor Killers of the Week are elite agents of the Nebulous Evil Organisation fought throughout the story by the player and the police force they belong to.

-   Subverted in **Dragon Age: Origins**. Arl Howe approached the Antivan Crows about assassinating the Grey Wardens, but since it's considered in poor taste (and often suicidal) to go after members of that order, only Zevran stepped up to accept the contract. Once he makes his attempt, no more Crows bother the Warden for the rest of the game. When they do return, it's more because they are after Zevran for failing to get his target.
-   The Dark Brotherhood in **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim** has this vibe. Besides the authoritarian, no-nonsense leader, members include a Werewolf booted from the Companions who also happens to be her husband, a snarky and legit badass Scary Redguard, an ancient vampire forever frozen in the form of a little girl, a grumpy old mage who favors louder and flashier means of killing, an Argonian who may be the last member of a line of Argonian royal spies and assassins, a murderous jester who is completely off his rocker, and their Team Pet, a Frostbite Spider.
-   A staple of Suda51 console games; You play as one of these in **Killer7**, and fight your way to the top of a different group in **No More Heroes**.

    -   A Pyromaniac of indeterminate gender and origin.

    -   A Texan Gadgeteer Genius somewhat addicted to More Gun.
    -   A sadistic German doctor.
    -   An Australian sniper who uses an ancient martial art.
    -   A French espionage agent with a variety of cloaking watches.
-   The "Deaths of Chromie" scenario from **World of Warcraft**, players have to stop several assassins hired by an unknown master all trying to kill Chromie at the same time. They include a satyr, a lich, a dreadlord, a Void god, as well as other undeads, demons and even troops from the player factions, even though all of these people are normally working for wildly different sides at war with each other.

New Pursuers join up at about the same rate as they get killed, keeping the number constant.

-   In **The Boondocks**, Gin Rummy tells the tale of Bushido Brown fending off a group of these hired by the beef industry to take out Oprah Winfrey, including pastiches of Walker, Texas Ranger and Billy Jack.
    
    **Gin Rummy:** Apparently only one guy actually managed to get his hand on Oprah's door, they say Bushido Brown kept that hand.

-   The various groups that try to catch **Danny Phantom** after Vlad put out a bounty on him, including the Guys in White and the Extreme Ghostbreakers.
-   This was common enough in **Samurai Jack** that eventually an episode is told from the perspective of the disparate group of Bounty Hunters searching for Jack. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> Another example is the endless progression of hunters facing Jack head-on in "Jack and Mad Jack" (most notably, "Crazy Round Man" and Huntor).
-   **The Simpsons**: Spoofed in "Sex, Pies, and Idiot Scrapes". Homer becomes a bounty hunter with Ned Flanders as his partner. When Flanders decides to leave the business, their boss tells him his last bounty is Homer himself. And if Flanders won't do it, one of the other hunters will. Cue a room full of thugs, including a knife-wielder, a psychotic man with a chainsaw, a girl with a machine-gun leg, and a grizzly bear practicing the nunchaku.
