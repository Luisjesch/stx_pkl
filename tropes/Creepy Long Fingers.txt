Creepy Long Fingers: 
_He is coming..._

Characters and monsters (or both) have a little extra creepy added to them when they have longer-than-average fingers. They don't even have to be a foot long, the Uncanny Valley can make even just slightly longer fingers off-putting. This is one reason Femme Fatalons which lengthen the apparent size of fingers can invoke this effect, as can actual claws.

These characters are likely to use their big hands in expressive ways, whether subtle or overt, and comparisons to skeletons and spiders are common. They'll usually gesticulate with surgeon-like precision or herky-jerky motions. Outright inhuman creepy long fingers may have extra knuckles or Freddy Krueger style finger attachments that can double as weapons.

The one big drawback to using this trope in live-action media is that human actors are unlikely to be able to handle extra knuckles or delicate motions, which is why animatronics and CGI fare better. Actors with these finger extensions are usually limited in their range of hand motions, being unable to make a fist, wield guns or more generally grasp thin objects.

When villains, these characters enjoy making Sinister Scraping Sounds and Finger Licking Evil.

Often overlaps with the similar Creepily Long Arms. Goes well with the stretched-out physiques of Noodle People. Long fingernails are usually included as well.

Creepy Long Fingers Example in Films — Live-Action

-   Most designs for the aliens from the **Alien** series give the extraterrestrial monsters long, clawed fingers. Some go so far as to make them more than a foot long.
-   The titular entity in **The Babadook**, to the point where it's one of the thing's most distinguishing features. The film's page image says it all.
-   Nina from **Black Swan**, whose fingers start becoming unnaturally long when she's experiencing her hallucination. This was done by extending Natalie Portman's fingers via CGI.
-   In another vampire example, Barnabas Collins of **Dark Shadows**.
-   In **Dracula (1979)**, the eponymous vampire has some very claw-like movement with his hands, which makes them appear very long. Frank Langella's hands did not have prosthetics, though.
-   The alien in **E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial** has long fingers compared with the rest of him. Like most examples, ET is creepy-looking and ugly. Unlike most examples, he's benevolent, lovable, etc. Elliott sees through his creepy exterior to the lovable character inside.
-   In **Frankenstein (1910)**, the Monster has long fingers as part of his general unusual appearance.
-   Jerry Dandridge from **Fright Night (1985)** had extra knuckles, giving him these.

    -   And anyone else who Looks Like Orlok.
-   **Pan's Labyrinth** has both The Faun and The Pale Man, courtesy not of CGI, but rather the actor who portrayed them, Doug Jones. (see the real-life examples for more on him)
-   Radu in **Subspecies** not only has long fingers, but he can also snap them off to create minions.
-   The Bennnings\-Thing in **The Thing (1982)** is also "creepy misformed fingers", but they're clearly playing off the horror this trope provides when his hands are revealed. The poster of the 2011 prequel also utilizes it.
-   Kaiser Belial from **Ultraman Zero: The Revenge of Belial**. He also uses his fingers to brainwash his opponents.
-   After removing her disguise in **The Witches (1990)**, the Grand High Witch has fingers almost a foot long.

    -   Yuuzhan Vong shapers are sometimes presented this way, especially Nen Yim, who shows up more than once on book covers with her abnormally-long hands. For extra Mad Scientist cred, shapers' hands are implants (they chop off the originals in a religious ceremony) that are equipped with various tools such as blades, pincers, and exotic sensory apparatuses to help in their work.
-   **Harry Potter**:
    -   Lord Voldemort reborn is said to have long, thin fingers. His hands are compared to "giant pale spiders" several times in the series.
    -   Goblins are also described this way (as are the similarly diminutive house-elves, though they're a mostly harmless Servant Race).
-   **Into the Drowning Deep**: The mermaids that attack the crew of the **Melusine** have two extra joints on their fingers, plus claws. They look spindly but are strong enough to gouge metal.

-   **Mrs. Smith's Spy School For Girls: Double Cross**: Abby describes The Ghost's fingers as very long and thin.
-   The short story "The Moving Finger" from **Nightmares & Dreamscapes** involves a finger with many more knuckles than is usual, which appears in the protagonist's life with little explanation or justification and causes him to doubt his safe, rational view of the world.

Besides grabbing people with the help of his size-shifting arms, they make quick work of puncturing holes in people's organs. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
-   **Warrior Cats**: The villain Tigerclaw has unusually long claws to add to his menacing appearance. It's one of the first things the main character notices about him.

-   **The X-Files**: Eugene Victor Tooms from the episodes "Squeeze" and "Tooms" can elongate his body, including fingers, which he demonstrates when squeezing himself through a chimney into someone's house to murder them. Bonus points for the creepily long fingerprints.

Creepy Long Fingers Example in Video Games

-   Ultimecia inhabiting Edea's body in **Final Fantasy VIII** has either this or Femme Fatalons covered by long-fingered gloves, it's hard to tell. When we see normal Edea in her normal outfit, the camera doesn't pay any extra attention to her hands.
-   The Marionette from **Five Nights at Freddy's 2** has long, talon-like fingers. Nightmarionne from **Five Nights at Freddy's 4**'s DLC has such long fingers that they may as well be Combat Tentacles.

Creepy Long Fingers Example in Web Original

-   **Salad Fingers** makes very creepy use of his long, green, bony fingers.
-   **The Slender Man Mythos**: The Slender Man, when given arms and hands, is sometimes shown with these. Though that brings up the question of if they're fingers at all, or just its Combat Tentacles taking the appearance of fingers...

Creepy Long Fingers Example in Western Animation

Creepy Long Fingers Example in Real Life

-   The aye-aye<small>◊</small> (**Daubentonia madagascariensis**), a species of lemur, is notable for its long, spindly fingers. And as if just having long fingers isn't creepy enough, the middle finger is especially long and thin, and it even has a ball-and-socket joint much like a human shoulder. Even the way they **use** it is creepy — they insert their finger into a hole in a tree and then lick off the bugs that crawl onto it. The aye-aye's long fingers have given it a reputation as being bad luck; it is said that if an aye-aye were to point its middle finger at you, a horrible death will follow (granted there **is** an element of truth to this; the aye-aye's middle finger certainly ends up causing its **prey** a horrible death). Sadly, this has also led to its species being endangered, as people have been known to kill aye-ayes due to this superstition.
-   Bats. Their wings are actually made up of extremely elongated fingers, which nowadays are all but unrecognizable from what they once were. On a less extreme level, the now-extinct pterosaurs had wings supported by elongated **pinkie fingers**.
-   Marfan Syndrome is a genetic disorder of the connective tissue characterized by exceptional tallness and long limbs, including very long thin fingers.
-   Arachnodactyly, or "spider fingers", is pretty much this very trope in real-life, and a symptom of several medical conditions, notably the aforementioned Marfan syndrome.
-   Likewise, eunuchs castrated before puberty were documented to develop long fingers, along with Creepily Long Arms (and legs) and a Creepy High-Pitched Voice, as they grew up. Eunuchs have often been characterized as sinister throughout history, though that has at least as much to do with their powerful positions behind the scenes in various monarchies as it does with their physical features.
-   Actor Doug Jones has built a career on combining his extreme flexibility, long limbs and fingers, and mastery of both Body Language and intense character acting to become a Man of a Thousand Faces, and a darling of special effects artists. His hand gestures in particular border on the surreal: a single graceful ripple or jerky Marionette Motion of his fingers can replace pages worth of characterization and hours worth of makeup.
-   Older Than Dirt: There was a family of tiny, birdlike dinosaurs called Scansoriopterygids that had very long fingers. The purpose of these fingers was the subject of debate for a long time; most thought they were used the same way aye-ayes use their fingers, while others believed they were used for climbing. **Yi qi,** a scansorioptrygid discovered in 2015, suggests that they were used for something else entirely...
