Battle Harem: 
**Risa:** A forest fairy, a dark demigod, and a brilliant mage. Which do you like best? I'd guess the elf, based on the looks.  
**Itami:** Yeah.  
**Risa:** Personality-wise, the black goth girl.  
**Itami:** Yeah.  
**Risa:** And the platinum blonde makes you want to protect her, maybe?  
**Itami:** You sure know me.

— _Gate_, "Despair and Hope"

A subtrope of the Harem Genre, where the male lead has a harem of potential love interests, all of whom are some sort of Action Girl. Sometimes the harem may appear in a form of Hero Secret Service or as an Amazon Brigade. They might also be Bodyguard Babes.

Because this is a more action-oriented subgenre, Battle Harems are less likely to be focused on romance, but still provide plenty of fanservice. Often this appears in the form of a Supporting Harem, though a Balanced Harem form is possible.

Often a Themed Harem, with all the girls having a shared origin and/or character tic/type, but not always. See also Battle Couple and Amazon Chaser. If the hero gets power _from_ his harem, see Harem-Powered. If the story is more about the girls than him, he may just be either The One Guy or an Escort Mission.

## Examples

Battle Harem Example in Anime and Manga

-   **AIKI** features only Action Girls that Joukyuu is training.
-   **Black Lagoon**: Rock's got an Dark Action Girl Harem started, though Revy's the main contender. Eda's made her admiration plain, hitting on him several times. Not to mention Rock's open defiance of Balalaika somehow scoring him points with her and creating some UST there. Let's add Feng Yifei, a Chinese hacker with decently good skills (not on Benny's level, though). She's no Action Girl like the rest of Rock's harem, but there's no doubt that her brains are useful. Oh, and she's the first person to actually **kiss** Rock. RIGHT. IN. FRONT. OF. REVY.
-   **Cross Ange** has a villainous example with Big Bad Embryo and his Diamond Rose Knights. The entire group consists of beautiful young Norma girls with Ace Pilot skills to pilot his Ragnamails, and he won their loyalty through seemingly selfless acts just so he could use them as his Co-Dragons and — yes — a potential harem. He also intends to bring main character Ange to his side since she pilots Villkiss, one of the Ragnamails which was stolen from him.
-   The main point of **Deadline Summoner** is the protagonist trying to get by with his summons, in the least violent, and safest way possible. Unfortunately, there aren't many boring, safe jobs in a fantasy universe for a person of his skills. Fortunately, the girls are very capable fighters, but are just as likely to be fighting amongst themselves and destroying the main character in the crossfire.
-   In **Delicious in Dungeon** Shuro's new party consists of female warriors from his home country. They're not quite a "harem", given that he's in love with Falin, but they're quite loyal to him.
-   You wouldn't expect this to crop up in a **Gundam** show but the full crew of Naze's vessel in **Iron-Blooded Orphans** is made up of his harem. Though, to clarify, only three members thereof - Amida, Lafter, and Azee - are the only combat-capable ones, being able to pilot mobile suits.
-   **Majikoi! Love Me Seriously!**: More true for the anime with Miyako, Wanko, Yukie & Chris already in Yamato's harem from the start, and the Momoyo (and others) in play. In the game, each girl has her own route, though in the Ryuuzetseran route, you get Momo, Miyako, Tasuko & Angel.
-   **Maken-ki!**: Takeru has Haruko, Inaho, and Celia vying for his affections, though Haruko adamantly denies having any feelings for him. All three also happen to be high-level ability users, two of whom, each wields one of the original 8 Maken. And, from chapter 65 onwards, Love Espada joins his harem and, in chapter 90, says she's more than willing to "share" because she's openly bisexual.
-   **Negima! Magister Negi Magi** has over 20 women, most of whom are Action Girls in some form or the other, some of them **ludicrously** powerful, and most of the rest being at least Plucky Girls or otherwise quite useful in some way.
-   In the harem of **Omamori Himari**, only one of them is a normal human who isn't capable of defeating just about anyone else.
-   **Ranma ½**: Ranma Saotome's Unwanted Harem is full of Action Girls. Not surprising, since he lives in a world where everybody gets their own style of martial arts.
-   **Rise Of The Outlaw Tamer** sees D-Rank adventurer Lint getting a harem of S-Rank lady adventurers. Funnily enough, the idea can be credited to the harem's first member, Belina, rather than Lint.
-   **Rosario + Vampire**: All the harem members are capable of holding their own in battle (at the very least) and spend much of the first season defending Tsukune. Justified in that while Tsukune is human, the girls are all Cute Monster Girls - the possible exception is Moka, who needs Tsukune to take off her rosario in order to fight at full strength but even without that she is pretty strong. The show, while very fanservice-y, does also have a strong focus on romance, especially in later arcs. The girls all get noticeably much stronger and more skilled over the course of the series as well, except for Moka who doesn't have much room to improve since she's top-tier from day one.
-   **Sekirei** is built around this trope, with the titular aliens being Action Girlfriends to their Puny Earthling lovers. The protagonist, as well as most of the other prominent Ashikabi, each have their own harem of Sekirei and are competing in a battle royale where There Can Be Only One. It veers between comical harem antics and serious action, borrowing heavily from shounen fighting series with many girls being either a Spirited Competitor or a Blood Knight.
-   **Tenchi Muyo!** OVA - is a series about one guy living with five girls, who're all in love with him consisting of: Ryoko, Washuu, Ayeka and Sasami, and Mihoshi. Everyone except Sasami is skilled fighter (and clearly she will be too once she grows up)<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>, and all of them are very much superhuman. Washu is a literal goddess, her daughter Ryoko is something more than a demigoddess given her lack of a mortal parent, and Sasami is in the process of merging with Washu's younger sister Tsunami. And as of the end of OVA 3, Washu and Tsunami's other sister Tokimi looks to be joining the harem.
    -   The current Emperor of Jurai, Ayeka and Sasami's father, has his own (albeit smaller) Battle Harem: his two wives Funaho and Misaki are each powerful warriors.
    -   Along with the other Tenchi stuff, there's **Tenchi Muyo! GXP**. By the end, it's the captain, eight girls and an overpowered starship fighting pirates.
    -   **Tenchi Muyo: War on Geminar** has this with almost every girl that is in love with Kenshi also being a highly trained and skilled combat mecha pilot.
    -   By the end of the third OVA Tenchi acquires another suitor in the name of Noike Kamiki Jurai, a Mihoshi's former partner and adopted daughter of the infamous Demon Princess Seto Kamiki Jurai, who's widely acknowledged to be the driving force behing her son-in-law Azusa. Well, and Noike's a female part of Kagato, the major antagonist of the first OVA, who started as a clone of Washu's former best friend Naja Akara.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
    -   If the beginning of the fourth OVA series is any indication, then Tenchi's just acquired an another powerful woman who has an eye on him — Minaho Masaki Jurai, the head of the Juraian Secret Police, — who is technically **his aunt**.
-   The universe should consider itself lucky that **To Love Ru** is a romantic comedy. To wit, as of the most recent issue of Darkness, Rito has gained the unwavering allegiance of **three** shape-shifting living weapons, all of whom are experts in infiltration and assassination, especially Nemesis who can hide in other people's bodies, the three Deviluke sisters, each of whom has unique ability (Lala has super-strength and is a Teen Genius, Momo can control the plants and Nana the animals), Rin, who is a Master Swordsman, and Kyoko that has fire-power. The other girls are normal humans, except Run, with no particular ability, although if push comes to shove, Haruna can use him as a weapon, quite effectively and many of the others have excellent non-combat skills that are very useful in prolonged campaigns.

Battle Harem Example in Manhua

-   The manhua **Infinite Apostles and Twelve War Girls** basically spells this out in the title. Yu, aka Ullmm, the Apostle in question, will be saddled with a harem of twelve war maidens, even though he descended to the mortal world searching for **just one** wife. Although he's got a harem shoved unto him by situations far beyond his control, he's not complaining.

---
Battle Harem Example in Comic Books

-   Subverted with the Dora Milaje in **Black Panther**, as tradition dictates they serve his personal bodyguards and wives-in-training. Despite their beauty and skill, T'Challa views them as daughter-figures rather than romantic interests.
-   **The Darkness** has the Angelus female warriors, who in addition of fighting for their mistress, they also doubled as her concubines when outside of fighting.
-   The X-Men once faced an Multiversal Conqueror known as Khan whose harem was composed of warrior women from worlds that he conquered. He decides to make Storm his newest addition and as she soon finds out, these ladies are very vicious and jealous fighters.

Battle Harem Example in Fan Works

-   In **Archetypal**, most of the girls that show interest in Lincoln, being part of the 9% of the population with useful superpowers, are perfectly capable of kicking ass when necessary.
-   **Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest** has the players take control as one of the girls in the harem instead of the male protagonist.
-   This is the endgame Consensus is after for Taylor Hebert for the first iteration of **Communication**, to the point of that it becomes a Running Gag throughout the quest. To her complete dumbfoundment, they **actually** succeed! By the time of the epilogue, it consists of Deadpan Snarker with Bat Deduction, a Biomanipulator with former Heroic Fatigue, a Benevolent A.I., a former patient of Hospital Paradiso, the resident Action Fashionista, an Archer Archetype, and a Humanoid Abomination from space. The group expands in the sequel.
-   The Harry Potter fanfic **Faery Heroes** has one of these as its protagonists, made up of Harry, Hermione, and Luna. Luna and Hermione have very different approaches to life, but all three are are effectively commandos after their experience of their original timeline. After they use a virginity sacrifice ritual in their new bodies, their magical reserves increase significantly and they become an army unto themselves and apply their talents to robbing Dark Pureblood families blind and leaving them unable to support Voldemort.
-   It's common in **Fate/Grand Order** fanfic to make the Servants male and female Ritsuka summon into their personal harem.
-   **Fate/Harem Antics**: The main difference from canon is that Iri is in full control of the Holy Grail, and decides to use the Fifth Holy Grail War as an excuse to get her son Shirou a harem so that she can finally have grandkids. To that end, she makes sure every Master (besides Shirou) and every Servant is female. Of course, she had no way of telling any of them that, meaning everyone just thinks it's a normal Holy Grail War and are continuing to fight each other. At the start, Shirou quickly makes an alliance with Rin and Sakura, meaning that his battle harem consists of five girls (his Servant Saber, Rin and her Servant Archer, and Sakura and her Servant Rider), but by the end he will end up with **twenty-three** girlfriends.
-   In **For Want of a War**, only one of Ramza's possible love interests can't fight.
-   **The Fundamental Essence of Villainy**: Himiko implies that this is what Izuku's team is. Izuku doesn't deny it.
-   **Izuku's Pro Hero Harem Life!**: The whole draw of the fic is Izuku's expanding harem roster of superheroines, all of whom have well established badass credentials in the fic and in canon.
-   **Jaune Arc: The Elemental Swordsman**: Team RWBY and Pyrrha are both Jaune's girlfriends and Huntresses-in-Training. They also each controlled one of the Elemental Powers.
-   In **Kyon: Big Damn Hero**, we have the Reality Warper, the Human Alien slightly-less-powerful Reality Warper, the tazer-wielding Yakuza Princess, the Time Traveler, the Teleporting Slider... and whoever is trying to take a swing at any of these people. Mundane threats like normal people are severely outclassed, and extraordinary opponents give the group some pause.
-   **MHA: Power Rangers Next Generation**, has "The Queens", as they are affectionately refered to by Izuku. Not only all the girls from Izuku's harem are Pro Hero students (Ochako, Kyoka, Momo, Mina, Toru, Setsuna and Pony), plus Mei, who is a support student, all of them are training to be Power Rangers as well.
-   **Mutant Deviations**: Taylor starts attracting attention when she founds an independent hero team composed entirely of girls, and her frequent recruitment of girls defecting from other factions in the city spurs in-universe jokes and memes about her gathering a lesbian harem. By the end of the fic she is officially dating Lisa, Madison, and Cassie (Rune), with a significant amount of teasing from other members of the team.
-   **My Driver Academia**: Izuku is gaining one thanks to Pyra wanting to make up for everything that he had to go through. It contains her, Mythra, Momo Yaoyorozu, Nia Hanekoma, Mei Hatsume, Reiko Yanagi, Ochaco Ururaka, Mina Ashido, Brighid, and Azami. And it's likely more girls will join later.
-   **One for All and Eight for the Ninth**: Izuku will have a harem in the story with Momo, Uraraka, Mei, Tsuyu, Toru, Yui, Nejire and Melissa as confirmed members (six of whom are also Hero Course students).
-   Subverted in **The Pirate's Soldier**. Most of the alien girls do express some interest in Heero Yuy when they first meet him, the two most blatant about it being obviously Ryoko and Ayeka. But once Heero's fellow Gundam pilots enter the story, plus Heero and Ryoko becoming an Official Couple, they start to interact more with them. Ayeka slowly seems to redirect her affections towards Quatre, Sasami develops a Precocious Crush on Trowa, and Kiyone seems interested in Wufei.
-   Ash's female companions in **Pokémon Reset Bloodlines** will eventually become this, as they not only are (or will be) talented and skilled Pokémon trainers, but they also possess bloodliner powers.
-   Played for Laughs and gender-inverted in the **Baldur's Gate** fanfic "Romancing the Bhaalspawn". It's a humorous attempt to answer the question, "What would happen if a female PC played this game with a fistful of romance mods?" So Kaela has an entire party full of love interests: Xan (never seriously pursued), Solaufein and Haer'Dalis (who proposition Kaela to have a threesome), Valygar (breaks up with her to be a Celibate Hero), Anomen (friend-zoned), and Sarevok, who Kaela is convinced is The One.
-   As the **RWBY** fic **She's got a halogen heart** puts it: "Even with Weiss attempting to direct everyone, it was nearly impossible to keep them on the same topic without the promise of sex or fighting to hold their attention."
-   **Temporal Anomaly:** The Intoners, who are considered goddesses by the world's inhabitants that have already liberated its people from their brutal oppressors, one by one become Sougo's lovers.
-   Ranma Saotome and his Unwanted Harem of Shampoo, Ukyo Kuonji and Kodachi Kuno slowly evolves into this over the course of **Voyages of the Wild Sea Horse** as they trravel together, fight together, and learn to respect each other. There's also an unexpected fourth addition to the harem in the form of Nabiki Tendo, who first develops a crush on Ranma, then gains the requisite ass-kicking skills through a combination of Training from Hell and eating a Devil Fruit that gives her the powers of a vampire.

Battle Harem Example in Film

-   **Dolemite** is a pimp with a stable of karate-trained prostitutes.
-   In **Manos: The Hands of Fate**, the antagonist has a harem of wives that are ready to fight for him... which apparently includes fighting each other.
-   **Spring Breakers**: Alien has Candy and Brit, both of them action girls (he finds it attractive how they had ''threatened his life), who engage in a threeway with him.

Battle Harem Example in Literature

-   **The Asterisk War**: Over time, Ayato gathers a harem of seriously competent fighters to win the fighting tournaments in the Asterisk city, though he really only has eyes for Pretty Princess Powerhouse Julis-Alexia von Riessfeld.
-   Invoked in **Being Able to Edit Skills in Another World, I Gained OP Waifus**: Nagi's unique "restructuring" skill can only work on himself and his female slaves, all of whom he makes seriously overpowered in battle.
-   **A Brother's Price** has a form of this. Men are rare, so when one is married off it's to an entire family of sisters who themselves are the children of several different sisters and one father. Women rule this world and work fiercely to protect their fragile brothers, sons, and husbands from other women who would literally kidnap them, so this is sort of a default.
-   **Cat Planet Cuties**: The girls in Kio's harem consists of 2 government agents and an alien girl with powered armor. All of whom are competent combatants.
-   **A Certain Magical Index**:
    -   Among the girls interested in Touma are a human repository of thousands upon thousands of spellbooks, the third most powerful Esper in Academy City and her **10,000** 'Sisters' who have Level 2 powers and military expertise, a sword-wielding priestess <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>, one of her spear wielding subordinates, a magical spy/courier who wants to seduce him into working for her country, the pre-teen leader of a magical cabal, and the fifth most powerful Esper in Academy City. It's even lampshaded; some people are starting to wonder if, with all the powerful women he's recruited to his side, he's setting up some kind of resistance force.
    -   Then we get introduced to his Shadow Archetype, Kamisato Kakeru who essentially has the fully realized version of Touma's Battle Harem in the sense that they all work together (though not always in...friendly terms) for the sake of their shared Love Interest. While their power level may be somewhat lower than what would be the Touma Harem's overall strength, their sheer coordination, determination and excess numbers (like Touma's) prove how absolutely FRIGHTENING this sort of thing is. Especially when a Mad Scientist backdoors her way into leading them, long story.
-   **Date A Live**: The premise of the story is that Shido has to romance Spirits in order to decrease their powers and not be a threat to mankind. Even when de-powered, Spirits can use small bits of their power every now and then; this is usually to combat future harem members.
-   **The Eminence in Shadow**: Shadow Garden consists of Cid and seven members of Amazon Brigade with Undying Loyalty and romantic interest in their leader. Cid himself, however, is Oblivious to Love.
-   1st Lt. Youji Itami of **GATE** in the course of the story of being thrust into a magical parallel world, managed to collect a semi-Unwanted Harem consisting of a 961-years-old<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> Demi-Goddess and Apostle of the God of Death, a 169-years-old elven archer (who considers him a replacement of her deceased father)<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>, a 300-something years old Dark Elf warrior who is technically now his slave for the favor he did to her tribe, a-a-and a 15-years-old human magician, who, on the other hand, is arguably the most dangerous on the bunch due to being smartest of them by far. And that's not mentioning his 28-years old former wife back in Japan who's still pretty much into him. And approves of all aforementioned with gusto. As of volume 8, the crown princess of The Empire has thrown her hat into the ring, in front of all the others.
-   **The Harem Games** has this set up, by design, teenage males upon reaching puberty are forced into a battle royal and each granted through Bureaucratically Arranged Marriage a harem of 6 to 15 brides that help him fight the others in a fight to the death, for the amusement of the populace at large.
-   Also invoked in **Harem in the Labyrinth of Another World**. There are two main differences to the "Cheat Wife" entry above. One, the protagonist actively seeks out each and every girl who he adds to his slave harem. Two, he has the X-rated kind of sex, with consent.
-   In Ann Scarborough's **The Harem Of Aman Ackbar** the titular harem of ill assorted wives must work together to find and rescue their husband (who's been turned into a donkey). By the end of the story the three women have bonded, their husband is grateful and loving and even their mother-in-law approves of them.
-   **The Harem Protagonist Was Turned Into A Girl!! And Doesn’t Want To Change Back!!!??**: Has the titular protagonist herself who is the heir to the Galactic Empire and therefore equipped with a powerful battle uniform to protect herself. In her harem Plynx is an alien soldier - a member of a Cat Girl species known as the Issiod’rians, Thisbe has vampire powers, O’tmyil is the A.I. that can fight on her own but usually is the onboard A.I. for Svetlana's aforementioned battle uniform, Augusta and Vivian are ordinary humans but both have martial arts training. They frequently have to fight invaders from the rival alien Kobaroian empire who come to attack Svetlana. They end up as a Polycule rather than a traditional Harem however. And the story closes with the Kobaroian princess joining also.
-   **High School D×D**: The more girls who join in the Occult Research Club, the more girls Issei gets. Said girls include Rias, Akeno, Xenovia, Asia, and Koneko. Later with the addition of Rossweisse, Ravel Phenex, Irina Shidou and Ophis. Take note, these are just **the girls**. This isn't even including Kiba and Gasper.
-   In **How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom**, Souma's five queens (except Roroa) are this. Liscia is a Pretty Princess Powerhouse, Aisha is a Person of Mass Destruction, Juna is a trained soldier and spy, and Naden is a dragon who can take human form. This is all for the best, since Souma himself is a Non-Action Guy who is far more useful in a boardroom than on a battlefield.
-   **How to Build a Dungeon: Book of the Demon King**: Villain Protagonist Aur is a human turned Demon Lord on a crusade against humanity. He wants to add capable individuals to his ranks, mainly those who will aid him on his misanthropic quest. While he adds some men here and there, women are his favorite and he adds them by the dozens, as the girls will be valuable assets to him both in battle and in bed; Aur uses them for the latter purpose a lot.
-   **Hybrid × Heart Magias Academy Ataraxia**: Kizuna has several women vying for his affections, all of them equipped with Hybrid Gears, which can only be activated and recharged whenever he does lewd things to them, much to his chagrin when he finds out.
-   **Infinite Stratos**: The result of having an Unwanted Harem equipped with Powered Armor. As Ichika's co-homeroom teacher Maya once stated, with his force of six representative pilots (Let us count them all, shall we? We have representatives from Japan, England, China, France, Germany, Russia, and possibly America), he has more than enough to "start a war."
-   **Is This A Zombie?**: The harem consists of a Necromancer, a Magical Girl, and three Vampire Ninja.
-   **KonoSuba** has a case where initially this was an example on paper. Kazuma is a Weak, but Skilled guy with a "harem" of girls who are all incredible powerhouses when it comes to their own niches, Aqua being a literally godly level White Mage, Megumin having utterly devastating firepower through her Fantastic Nuke spell, and Darkness being an Implacable Man Stone Wall of a knight who is pretty close to Nigh-Invulnerable as a tank. All of them when working together have also taken on some pretty dangerous foes and come out victorious. But everything about this is deconstructed for laughs, because all of the girls have Crippling Overspecialization (Aqua can **only** use White Magic and often causes through either arrogance or idiocy the exact problems that she's needed for, Megumin takes Squishy Wizard to the extent that one spell-cast of her Fantastic Nuke paralyzes her body due to lacking the mana to cast it, and Darkness is such a masochist that she refuses to take any proper swordsmanship skills, so her swordfighting skills are so terrible she couldn't hit a stationary target right in front of her). It also takes the idea of Unwanted Harem to incredibly high "unwanted" levels, as the girls are so annoying the only way Kazuma let any of them join him is by being forced into it, whether through necessity of survival or straight up blackmail. It doesn't stay that way forever, though, as after several Fire-Forged Friends situations throughout the series, Kazuma does start to experience reciprocated romantic attraction towards Megumin and Darkness, while he and Aqua develop a Like Brother and Sister relationship, alongside all of them massively increasing in both cooperation and effectiveness to act like a more genuine Battle Harem.
-   Soujirou, a supporting character in **Log Horizon**, has one in the form of his guild the West Wind Brigade which is mainly composed of female players. Since it is considered to be one of the top combat guilds in Akihabara despite its relatively small size (around 60 members), its members can be assumed to be all very strong. And they are all head over heels in love with Soujirou. Somehow.
-   **Rebuild World**: The Rival Katsuya, a Satire of the Stock Shōnen Hero, has an entire platoon of girls, mostly unnamed except the top members Yumina and Airi, who are in love with him. Eventually it’s revealed to be the result of unconscious Telepathy and More than Mind Control from him. When Akira fights them, they show supernatural coordination due to their Psychic Link, and they share Katsuya’s emotions to an extent as well. After Akira turns many of these girls into Ludicrous Gibs or Half the Woman She Used to Be, the survivors excepting the more neutral Yumina, form a Renegade Splinter Faction from Drankam to try and get revenge.
-   **The Rising of the Shield Hero**
    -   Partial example with the title character, Naofumi Iwatani. He's set up for this when the beautiful adventurer Myne Sophia joins him for his first day out... and then she ruins his reputation with a False Rape Accusation. Without any better options, he buys a tanuki beastman girl from a slave trader to help him fight, and later adds Filo, a magical flightless bird who can take the form of a young girl. These two fall in love with him (and Raphtalia is eventually freed from slavery when she becomes the Katana Hero), but future additions don't: in fact Rishia Ivyred is actually pining after Bow Hero Itsuki Kawasumi.
    -   Deconstructed with Spear Hero Motoyasu's team. He chooses his party members based on their looks alone, which allows for opportunistic gold diggers onto his team, and the most they do is throw a support spell in their leader's direction. The end result is a group of dangerously incompetent fighters who constantly fail to stop the Waves, and all the girls hate their leader to the point they abandon him once he's no longer able to give them any perks or money.
-   **Sword Art Online** actually downplays this trope, despite serving as the page image. While Kirito gains an ensemble of powerful Action Girls that are deeply interested in him that only grows with each new adventure, Kirito only ever has eyes for Asuna, with the two entering a relationship before the first story arc is even halfway over and remaining romantically involved ever since. He is a Chick Magnet, but the other girls invariably back off and settle for friendship (or in the case of Leafa the role of a supportive sister) when they see him with Asuna, of course this doesn't stop them from complaining about the situation or trying to push their luck from time to time, some more then others.
    -   Literally the only girls who are not part of the Kirito's little Unwanted Harem are Yui, Mito, and Yuuki, with the former being Kirito and Asuna's adopted AI daughter and the latter two both being Ambiguously Gay and heavily implied to be crushing on Asuna.
-   **Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs** has this Gender-Inverted, due to it taking place in a dating sim aimed at women. The harem doesn’t belong to the protagonist (Leon), but The Rival Marie, who stole everything from the **game’s** protagonist. Each reverse-harem member has personality flaws that made them frustratingly bad at fighting when Leon played the game, and so while dueling each of them, he takes advantage of the flaws while mercilessly breaking them by talking. Afterwords, they are an albatross around Marie's neck due to being Rich in Dollars, Poor in Sense, and Love Makes You Dumb, but they reliably put up a decent fight when cooperating against mutual threats while teaming up with Leon.
-   Before a Chosen One in the world of **Tsun-Tsun TzimTzum** can go forth and fight the evil goddess Lilith, he or she must assemble a team of five companions. Having sex with your companions is not strictly mandatory but strongly encouraged, since it creates a magical bond that lets the Chosen One share the companion's strengths and provides them with a certain amount of telepathic contact.
-   In **Undefeated Bahamut Chronicle**, everyone in Lux's harem except Airi is an elite Drag-Knight. It's mentioned several times that they make up a significant fraction of the military power of the New Kingdom.
-   **The Wheel of Time** has Rand in a relationship with three girls, all of whom agree to share him: Min is a knife-wielding Lad-ette, Aviendha is a Proud Warrior Race Girl who used to be a member of an Amazon Brigade and grew from being an Action Girl to a really strong channeler, and finally, Elayne is a royal action girl who is also a strong channeler.

Battle Harem Example in Tabletop Games

-   **Dark Sun**: The Templars of Sorcerer-King Nibenay are all female and also his wives, chosen for their beauty and talent and said to mate with him. He leaves the running of his city-state of same name to them, and they act not only as military officers and assassins, but also as priests, bureaucrats and administrators, which also doubles as a Matriarchy.

Battle Harem Example in Video Games

-   **Fate/Grand Order:** One of the selling points for this game is that you can build up your own battle harem, of 200+ characters, of both male and female (and occasionally neither). It's possible to bond with all of them, given enough time, and make them stronger that way. The twist is that most of the characters you can collect are Historical Domain Characters (and mythical, too).
-   **Galaxy Angel**: The first game features Mission Control Takuto Myers in command of the Angel Squad.
    -   **Galaxy Angel II** has Kazuya Shiranami, a pilot and leader of the Rune Angel Squad.

Battle Harem Example in Visual Novels

-   In **Koihime†Musou**, Kazuto's generals do all the fighting.
-   **Muv-Luv**:
    -   The Valkyries of former Training Squadron 207B form Takeru's Battle Harem in **Muv-Luv Unlimited** and to a lesser extent in **Muv-Luv Alternative**, where they are still present and in love with him but not romanceable. Instead, he gets paired off with the mysterious Unit 00.
    -   Yuuya from **Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse** gained one during his time with project prominence.
-   **Princess Waltz**: The 2nd Act has all the princesses coming together to face the big bad. They are effectively Arata's harem at this point.
-   In **Seinarukana**, of the 14 Brigade members, 9 are female. Of these, 6 are potential love interests.
-   **Fate/stay night**'s Shirou has attracted a harem consisting of a genderflipped King Arthur, a talented mage, his ex-best friend's abused little sister, a sadistic little girl who is actually his long-lost older sister, ninja Medusa, and Ojou mage. **Fate/hollow ataraxia** also adds a priest girl (although she's really more attracted to the evil god that's been impersonating him, actually) and a very talented Irish mage (although she's ultimately not attracted to him, but she does join in with the other pretty freeloaders). He's also got a surrogate big sister, but she's definitely not romantically attracted to him.
-   Shiki in **Tsukihime**, being in the same multiverse as **Fate/stay night**, has also attracted a harem which includes an ancient vampire who can summon the moon itself, an Executor from the church, a half-demon hybrid, a succubus, an alchemist, and an exceptionally powerful classmate-turned-vampire. Also extends to **Melty Blood** continuity. And if you count the gag series **Carnival Phantasm**, you also have his reality-warping teacher...
-   Yuri Genre example: Kei from **Akai Ito** has four women who are seriously interested in her, ready to fight to death to protect her. It's very noticeable because Kei herself is **not** an Action Girl.
-   In **Moe! Ninja Girls**, the main protagonist is a ninja, who helps form a club that consists of himself, one male friend, and multiple beautiful girls, all of which are either also ninja or training to be one. And then there's the girls outside of the club that they're all friends with, such as the demon-sealing shrine maiden...

Battle Harem Example in Real Life

-   A male lion will generally have several lionesses in his pride at once. In fact, an adult male lion has literally failed at life if he **doesn't** have a Battle Harem.
-   Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Maurya Empire that dominated ancient India between c. 322 and 185 BCE. Badass of the Week put it the best:
    
    **Ben Thompson:** What makes Chandragupta totally awesome is that he was totally paranoid out of his mind. He built a huge palace with hundreds of beds and he never slept in the same place twice. He had food testers taste everything he ate and he created the first ever secret police to defend him from assassination. The best part about it though is that he had an entourage of seven hundred female bodyguards that followed him everywhere he went. He said that he trusted females more to defend him and so he compiled his unit from the best Greek and Indian women he could find. That's just freaking awesome. If I was King I would do the same thing.
    
-   Muammar Gaddafi kept an all-female team of elite bodyguards called essentially "the Revolutionary Nuns" in Arabic or "the Amazonian Guard" by the Western press. When he finally went down during the Arab Spring, it was revealed that he and his staff **didn't** treat them very well, with five of them accusing Gaddafi and the others of rape and other abuse, and others claiming that they were forced to execute rebels or be killed themselves.
