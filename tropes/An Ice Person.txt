An Ice Person: 
He may seem cold at times, but he's also got a fiery side.

_"Nature? Fire? Bah! Both are chaotic and difficult to control. Ice is structured, latticed, light as a feather, massive as a glacier. In ice, there is power!"_

The power to control ice, and create cold and frost at will. May be used as a trinity with Fire and Electricity, hence Fire, Ice, Lightning. Likely to be used as a contrast to fire — if the hero prefers fire, their rival, Archenemy, or Lancer will use ice, forming a Fire/Ice Duo. Sometimes the domain of evil or undead entities as Evil Is Deathly Cold. Goes hand in hand with Making a Splash, and may be involved with wind powers via cold air and snowstorms. In Elemental Rock-Paper-Scissors with fire, one will usually defeat the other, though which one varies. Ice is unlikely to be any stronger or weaker than other elements though for Competitive Balance, and thus Harmless Freezing will be invoked. If you want to resort to this to kill an otherwise invulnerable entity, you're planning to Kill It with Ice.

May be used by Bigfoot, Sasquatch, and Yeti, Snowlems, a Winter Royal Lady, a Yuki-onna, or even the Ice Queen. May be a Tragic Ice Character. People with these powers may also have An Ice Suit, a Freeze Ray, and Icy Blue Eyes, or be subject to Elemental Baggage. They'll also often have blue clothes, hair, and/or skin because Blue Means Cold. If it's not blue, it'll usually be white, as a reference to snow. See also Human Popsicle. Frequently leads to Literally Shattered Lives.

Also called "Cryokinesis". A common and unfortunate side effect of ice powers is using ice metaphors.

An Ice Person Example in Folklore and Fairy Tales

-   "Morozko"/Father Frost. Generally, he simply brings winter to certain areas (winter/cold follows him everywhere), but some stories have him using his power to freeze people to death in an instant if they piss him off. Compare Old Man Winter, who is either a substitute for him, another name of his, or a separate entity entirely, depending on how he's depicted. If both of them are depicted as two different beings, then Jack Frost has control over ice and snow in general, whereas Old Man Winter, true to his name, only has domain over Wintry cold.
-   Since the Soviet era, Morozko (now often called Ded Moroz, "Grandfather Frost") has been reworked into the Russian version of Santa Claus, since he was seen as a secular replacement for Saint Nicholas. He is usually accompanied by Snegurochka ("Snow Maiden"), who is either his daughter or granddaughter. Surrounding countries have counterparts with similar names and attributes.
-   Jack Frost is similarly imagined as the one Painting the Frost on Windows. He doesn't have much "canon," but is usually imagined as a mischievous sprite.
-   "Mother Holle", as well known as "Old Mother Frost," is an ancient German folk figure who is responsible for causing snow.
-   "The Fool of the World and the Flying Ship": One of the Fool's companions is a farmer with a bundle of straw that makes things colder, rather than hotter, when burned.

An Ice Person Example in Films — Live-Action

-   Snow White has ice powers in **Avengers Grimm** and is also a very cold person.
-   Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze in the critically panned 1997 film **Batman & Robin**. His dialog is essentially a nonstop collage of incredibly lame ice-related puns in a thick Austrian accent, which greatly accentuates the unintentional comedy factor in the movie. Pun times may be had by all. So far, the matter of whether the film is So Bad, It's Good or so bad that it's terrible has been rather...polarizing. One of two times that Arnold has ever taken the role of an antagonist. (**The Terminator** was the other.)
-   **Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)**: The Destroyer Titan Scylla, in contrast to her fellow Destroyer Rodan and the Protector Titan Godzilla who both generate fire, and in contrast to Ghidorah who generates lightning, emits liquid nitrogen which can have an ecosystem-wide cooling effect. In the ending, after Godzilla takes over kingship of the Titans and directs them to begin restoring the balance of nature instead of destroying it, Scylla reverses the manmade melting of the ice caps.
-   From **The Great Yokai War**, a Yuki-Onna was one of those asked to help battle the Demon of Revenge. She says she can't help because it's not her season.

Demonstrating his powers for the first time on a large bowl containing a goldfish, he freezes the water, goldfish and all, into a half-sphere block of ice, shattering the bowl in the process. His skills can also kill opponents by freezing the blood in their veins.
-   A background character in **Sky High (2005)** simply known as Freeze Girl (no word on if she's actually defrosting), who's the last-minute hookup for Warren.
-   The protagonist of the **wuxia**, **The Spirit of the Sword**, Bao-yu, has ice-related chi powers, capable of freezing enemies with a single touch. In one of the film's bigger action setpieces, he demonstrates his ice **chi** powers to its fullest extent — and freezes 3 enemy ninjas in one swoop.
-   In **Thor**, the Frost Giants can create blasts of ice as well as shape it into weaponry. Loki is able to use the Casket of Ancient Winters to generate ice blasts as well, once he discovers his true heritage.

An Ice Person Example in Myths & Religion

-   Pitjantjatjara mythology has the evil ice spirit Ninya, the Genius Loci of Mount Artilla (Mount Conner in their language). This is rather unusual as there is little snow in this mountain; some Aboriginal Australian stories date back to thousands of years ago, so this might be a remnant from the ice ages.
-   Despiste most of Mexico being tropical/subtropical, Aztec Mythology does have quite a few gods of ice and frost (inland areas do get pretty frosty nights/mornings, not to mention all the mountains). Itztlacoliuhqui is specifically the god of frost and the "plant killer" while Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, the god of the planet Venus, similarly is associated with ice and snow. The latter actually throws an ice atlatl at the sun in a myth, who retaliates by burning him alive.

-   Poli'ahu of Pacific Mythology, along with her sisters/friends Lilinoe, Waiau, and Kahoupokane. She is their leader, and widely noted for her beauty. She is said to live atop Mauna Kea, though she visits other snowy peaks on the island. She is the antithesis to the fire goddess, Pele.

-   Every single Toa of Ice in **BIONICLE**, plus a handful of other beings (though "a handful" does include an **entire swarm** of Kohrak). Thanks to Personality Powers, in this case "An Ice Person" often doesn't mean "a nice person".
-   The Frosticons from **Mixels**. In an interesting play of this elements, two of the three members are ridiculously slow and lethargic thanks to their abilities and climate. Their ranks are made up of Flurr, Lunk, and Slumbo. 2015 introduced three more Frosticons, cousins of the originals: Chilbo, Snoof, and Krog.
-   Ice-Bat from **UglyDolls**. Everything he touches turns into ice, and he lives in a frozen cave system, but his heart is the warmest part of him.
