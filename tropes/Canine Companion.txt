Canine Companion: 
I Am Legend, and this is my dog.

A dog who travels with a character wherever they go, and traditionally known as "man's best friend". This may be anything from a Mister Muffykins or a Right-Hand Attack Dog to a Precious Puppy or a Non-Human Sidekick. If you're lucky, your Post-Apocalyptic Dog will be one of these, and not a Super-Persistent Predator dog hunting you down.

Unlike Heroes Love Dogs, the dog owners in this trope don't necessarily need to be good guys; when they are the villains, they are always subjected to literal Pet the Dog moments, and the villainous dogs will still always have Undying Loyalty to them.

A sufficiently cute dog, however, will make the mood even better, be it a cute big dog or a cuddly small dog, because Cuteness Equals Goodness.

Often called upon for Urine Trouble or other Toilet Humor jokes.

It's not limited to dogs; a Noble Wolf or a Fantastic Fox can count as one if they accompany their owner. Of course, more-menacing bad guys will also happen to have more evil canine companions, such as a pack of Savage Wolves, or a gigantic Hellhound.

A Sub-Trope of Precious Puppy, Heroes Love Dogs. See also A Boy and His X and Right-Hand Attack Dog.

She then got two Rhodesian Ridgebacks, nominally big fierce attack dogs, but which became beloved House animals to the girls of Raven House. Marrying and moving out, Kaffee and Creme went with her and became family pets. In the inevitable fullness of time, they were relaced by two even bigger Rimwards Howondalandian dogs: two Boerboels called Rooibuis and Klipdrift.

-   **Arkham Horror** has an Ally card for a dog named Duke. He's good for your sanity. Duke is specifically "Ashcan" Pete's companion. Pete starts with Duke and if he fails his personal story, Duke is the only ally that does not abandon him.
-   **Mutant Chronicles**: In **Warzone Resurrection**, Mitch Hunter can form a combat team with his dog Pride.
-   **Mutant: Year Zero**: In the Core Book, there is a class role solely dedicated to training and fighting with dogs.
-   **The One Ring**: Woodmen of Wilderland can acquire a Hound of Mirkwood, which is faithful enough to Take the Bullet for them and can be trained to help out in other roles.
-   **Rifts**: The ubiquity of this trope is why the Coalition States created the Psi-Hounds, a.k.a. "dogboys". Humans and canines have worked together for so long that Coalition soldiers have no issue working alongside them, and dogboys are (with a few exceptions) fanatically loyal to humanity.
-   **Warhammer 40,000**:
    -   Space Wolves ride Fenrisian Wolves, ginormous wolves that can grow to bigger than a rhinoceros, and are tamed by finding the pack leader and defeating it in single combat (or being raised by them, as has happened twice already). And they really do follow the hero everywhere: strategic briefings involving multiple Chapters involve either telling the nine-foot-tall space Viking in Power Armor and a giant axe to go wait outside, or tolerate the panting, scratching, and roughhousing of half a dozen wolves bigger than the briefing room table.
    -   A comedic fluff article states that the Astra Militarum recently got more classical examples of this trope. Judging by the article's entirely basic instructions to canine (er, canid) care, having dogs as pets is no longer commonplace in the 41st Millennium.

Canine Companion Example in Video Games

-   **Arcanum**: Dog/Worthless Mutt can join your party without taking up a companion slot and train himself to be a melee master.

-   **Candies 'n Curses** features a ghost puppy named Goober who will aid the player in slaying ghosts if they have the Pup Charm equipped.
-   **Conquest of the Crystal Palace**: Farron and his dog Zap are the only ones brave enough to rise against the conquest.
-   **Dark Souls**: There's the Great Grey Wolf, Sif. Sif was the wolf companion of Sir Artorias, the Abysswalker (a giant himself) even after his death. Sif guarded Artorias's grave until death and wielded the great sword Artorias once used.
-   **Dark Tales**: **The Gold Bug** provides Dupin and the player with the assistance of Arthur, a sweet-tempered and highly intelligent Newfoundland, who sniffs out various clues for them.

-   **Dead to Rights** has Shadow, an insanely vicious husky capable of killing Mooks just as easily as his Cowboy Cop partner Jack Slate, as well as being able to solve puzzles or get various objects needed for Jack to progress.
-   **Deadly Premonition** has Forrest Kaysen's dalmatian Willie, who is exceptionally good at tracking down missing people. According to Word of God, it also relays orders to Kaysen from the Red World.
-   **Dragon Age** loves its dogs. The mabari are a cultural symbol of the kingdom of Ferelden, and it's a well-known fact that they are "smart enough to talk, wise enough not to." If a character in the franchise has a mabari, they are invariably Fereldan.
    -   **Dragon Age: Origins**: Five of the six potential origins have an opportunity to have a mabari hound imprint on them. The Human Noble, on the other hand, has had a mabari since they were very young and the dog is with them from almost the very beginning of the game.
    -   **Dragon Age II**: The **Black Emporium** DLC provides a Suspiciously Similar Substitute for the original Mabari. This time, the dog is treated much like a ranger's summoned animals were in the original, so he no longer takes up a party member slot and can be with Hawke at all times.
    -   **Dragon Age: Inquisition**: The player does not get a dog, as they are native to the Free Marches; however, in the **Trespasser** DLC epilogue, Cullen — the Inquisitor's Ferelden-born military advisor — finds an abandoned mabari at the Winter Palace and they adopt each other. Most of the potential ending slides for Cullen show him with the dog at his side.
-   **The Elder Scrolls**:
    -   Clavicus Vile, the Daedric Prince of Bargains and Wishes, is often accompanied by Barbas, Vile's external conscience. While Barbas might appear closer to a Hell Hound in statues, he is much closer to a Big Friendly Dog in personality and when he takes form in the mortal world.
    -   **Oblivion** and **Skyrim** both have optional dog companions. **Oblivion**'s in the form of a skinned hound reward for a quest, and in **Skyrim** a pet dog can be obtained in one of three ways. Firstly, stray dogs may appear in random encounters in the wilderness; secondly, a dog named Vigilance may be purchased; and thirdly, a dog named Meeko can be found lingering around a shack in the wilderness. Meeko's previous master died and Meeko is unwilling to leave him unless he is adopted by the player. Additionally, one quest has the aforementioned Barbas join you for a time. The **Dawnguard** DLC adds extra dog companions which can be obtained by joining either of the added factions; they are not permanently the player's pets but can be taken along on quests as followers.
-   **Endless Ocean 2: Adventures of the Deep**: A blond Labrador can be found by the player. Rescuing it leads L&L Diving Service to adopt it on Nineball Island, naming it "Snorkel", and it becomes involved in a sidequest.
-   **Fallout**: Dogmeat, a series of identically-named dogs, appears as a consistent companion for the various Wasteland-wandering characters.
    -   **Fallout 2** features Dogmeat as a cameo along with two normally recruitable cybernetic dog companion, K-9 and Robodog, and a "special encounter" jinxed dog called Pariah.
    -   **Fallout 3** marks Dogmeat's first 3D appearance. He's found next to a dead body named Max, a homage to Mad Max 2 and his dog, Dog.
    -   **Fallout: New Vegas** gives you Rex, a new cyberdog companion. In the DLC "Old World Blues" you can get Roxie, a female cyberdog which can actually "mate" with Rex in several endings if certain conditions are attained.
    -   Many players have been known to Save Scum should their dog companions die in **Fallout**. Human companions, meanwhile, are generally considered expendable. This is now sufficiently accepted that after **Fallout 4** was announced, the game's director publicly stated that this time "... the dog can't die, because you're just going to re-load."
-   **Fable II**: The protagonist gets a dog to help fight off enemies and find buried treasure. You get a dog in **Fable III** as well.
-   **Final Fantasy**:
    -   **Final Fantasy VI**: The ninja Shadow has Interceptor, who helps him in battle. Because Interceptor was coded as a hidden status effect, it's possible to accidentally lose him.
    -   **Final Fantasy VIII**: Most of Rinoa's Limit Break attacks involve her dog, Angelo.
    -   **Final Fantasy X**: The Aeon Yojimbo has a dog named Daigoro that helps him in battle.
-   Missile the Pomeranian from **Ghost Trick** is possibly the greatest example ever, as neither dying multiple times or waiting ten years all by himself will get in the way of his loyalty.
-   Dog from **Half-Life 2**: although his body moves more like a gorilla, the way he acts and his function in the game are both clearly dog-like.
-   This is the central mechanic in **Haunting Ground**, which has Fiona rely on Hewie as both her primary means of defense and to recover items in areas that are inaccessible to her. Together, they must puzzle their way past the castle's dangers in order to escape.
-   In **Ian's Eyes**, North is Ian's seeing-eye dog. He's also the Player Character.
-   Charles-Ingvar suddenly, yet without comment, gains one called Ingo in **Jönssonligan: Jakten på Mjölner** after not having had any pets in the original film series. While Ingo can't be controlled on his own and there is no way to interact with him, he will always follow Charles around and is useful for a few puzzles.
-   In **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild**, you can unlock Wolf Link as a hunting partner for the player by using the appropriate Amiibo.
-   In **Love & Pies**, Joe gives Amelia a new dog on Yuka's behalf so she'll have a partner like Miguel and canine sidekick Carmen in "The Mysteries of Miguel".
-   Polterpup, starting with the end of **Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon**, where Luigi adopts him. By the time of **3**, Polterpup has become the Team Pet of the Mario Crew, going on a holiday trip with them. After Luigi escapes getting trapped, Polterpup ends up being a near-constant companion and guide for Luigi, pointing him towards things that are important, like finding and leading Luigi to the Poltergust G-00.
-   **Manafinder**:
    -   Soren originally teamed up with his dog Scar to fulfil their manafinding duties. After Soren is killed by the Cataractadon, Scar teams up with Lambda instead.
    -   Octavius fights alongside his doberman, Hexa, in his boss fight.
-   **Mega Man** has Rush, who can be used like a hoverboard and has a spring on his back that allows Mega Man to reach high platforms. There's also the more wolf-like Treble, who can combine with his master Bass to access his Super Mode.
-   **Metal Gear**:
    -   In **Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance**, Bladewolf accompanies Raiden from File-02 onward and by the end he's more or less become Sunny's Canine Companion instead.
    -   **Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain**: D-Dog, who can be selected to accompany Big Boss on his missions.
-   **Minecraft** lets you tame wolves so they'll follow you around and help you fight, whether that means defending you from hostile mobs or hunting down passive mobs that you have targeted. The Xbox 360 Avatar system honored this by letting you have a pet **Minecraft** wolf as an accessory, which shows the Avatar playing with it.
-   **Monster Hunter: Rise** introduces dogs known as Canynes, with Canynes who can be hired by Hunters to accompany them being known as Palamutes. Palamutes are big enough to serve as fast-travel mounts and can provide offense-based support against enemy monsters when not mounted.
-   The player character in most installments of the **Mystery Trackers** series has Elf, a miniature pinscher, who accompanies her on missions. Elf can be used to retrieve items from places too small for the player to go and performs other various helpful functions. One of the games even has an adorable bonus activity in which the player acquires various items for Elf, his mate, and their litter of puppies.
-   **Nosferatu: The Wrath of Malachi**: Aunt Sophie's dog Buster will follow you around and fight off monsters once you free him.
-   **Overland**: Dogs can be recruited or rescued, and are treated much like human survivors. (Though they can’t use weapons or certain items, and do things like drive the car unless there aren’t any humans around.)
-   There exists an alternate version of **Pac & Pal** titled **Pac-Man and Chomp Chomp**, in which Pac-Man is accompanied by his dog Chomp Chomp from the animated series, who can help him by dragging Bonus Fruit into the ghost pen if he can't reach them.
-   Oatchi and Moss from **Pikmin 4** both aid the protagonists in their mission to gather as much as they can from PNF-404 and escape in one piece. They also act as captains, letting the player do more across greater stretches of the map without worrying about losing Pikmin.
-   Quite a few Pokémon are based on dogs; examples include the Growlithe, Eevee, Snubbull, Houndour, Poochyena, Zigzagoon, Riolu, Lillipup, Rockruff, Yamper, Fidough, Maschiff, and Greavard families, along with Furfrou. There seems to be at least one new canine Pokémon every generation. If you include foxes, then the Vulpix, Zorua, Fennekin, and Nickit families also count.
-   In **Potion Permit**, your dog accompanies you to Moonbury Town, and you can feed him and pet him once per in-game day to bond with him. Certain foods provide a bigger relationship boost if they're his favorite but a smaller one if he dislikes it, and he'll be able to track villagers and dig for food items the closer you bond with him.
-   **Rule of Rose** has an example of this in the form of Brown, the protagonist's best friend and companion throughout the game. In addition, his sense of smell is used as a core gameplay mechanic in locating items.
-   **Samurai Shodown**: Galford is accompanied in battle by his dog Poppy, who also assists him with some attacks.
-   **Secret of Evermore**'s hero has a dog that helps him in battle and to sniff out alchemy ingredients in the area. The effects of Evermore also change the dog's shape to reflect the sort of region the boy is exploring.
-   **Shadow Hearts: Covenant** has Blanca, a large white wolf who accompanies Yuri and the party on their journey. A series of "Wolf Bouts", a sidequest exclusive to him, also demonstrates that he's an Intellectual Animal, conversing quite articulately with his opponent.
-   The **Shinobi** sequel **Shadow Dancer** had Yamato, who you could sick on enemies to prevent them from attacking.
-   **Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire** introduces a purchasable Akk Dog as a combat companion (which can somehow heal the player). Although this is playing a little bit loose with the definition of "canine" — akk dogs look and act roughly like — wolves actually — but biologically they're more like giant, angry, blaster-resistant reptiles with More Teeth than the Osmond Family.
-   **Suikoden II**: Kinnison and his dog, Shiro, live in the forest surrounding Ryubei Village. If Player Character Riou puts the baby bird back in its nest and returns a short while later, Kinnison will ask if he was the one who saved it. Answer "yes" and they'll join Riou's army.
-   **Tales of Vesperia** has Repede, a damned big dog loyal to Yuri, the main protagonist. Oh, and he's a playable party member as well.
-   Pom from **Them's Fightin' Herds** is accompanied by a small litter of puppies named Woof, Ruff, Tuft, and Puff, as well as their giant mother and father (not counting all of the puppies that show up in Pom's Level 2 Super attack) who accompany her on her adventure, as well as play a role in her moveset.
-   **The Devil in Me**: Connie, a dog the crew encounters and can befriend (or kill) during their ordeal on the island. A secret ending is unlocked if the player manages to kill everyone **but** the dog.
