Aerosol Flamethrower: 
They say CFCs burn through the ozone layer, but why stop at _just_ the ozone layer?

_"You can't hurt me, Baby Bowler. 'Cause I'm protected. By the God of Haircare."_

Using an aerosol can, such as hairspray, with a match or lighter as a makeshift flamethrower. A _**serious**_ case of Don't Try This at Home, because there's a very real risk that the flames will heat the canister up enough for it to rupture and explode. You can accidentally poison yourself if you keep doing it, thanks to the fumes. Also, it smells terrible. See also Farts on Fire for a smaller, more comedic version of this.

Interestingly but for probably obvious reasons, the BBFC (the British censorship board) doesn't allow this trope to be shown in films or home video rated below "18", as they are pretty strict in banning what they deem is "imitable" and likely to cause injury and/or death if some dumb kid decided to copy an obviously dangerous action in a movie or TV show.

Subtrope of Improvised Weapon. Supertrope is Homemade Flamethrower. See also Booze Flamethrower, Molotov Cocktail, and Arrows on Fire. If a gas canister _itself_ becomes a weapon, that's a Gas-Cylinder Rocket.

-   In **Serial Mom**, Beverly uses one to turn Scotty into a Man on Fire as he attempts to flee from her on to the stage during the Camel Lips show at Hammerjacks.
-   The flight attendant, of all people, makes one in **Snakes on a Plane**. Apparently, she went through a pyromaniac phase as a kid. Of course, she's not nearly insane enough to **use** it, handing it off to Samuel L. Jackson instead.
-   **Tales of Halloween**: In "Trick", one of the murderous children uses an aerosol flamethrower to torch one of the adults.

Aerosol Flamethrower Example in Literature

-   **The Executioner**: The title character is shown doing this on the cover of **Council of Kings**. He has to cross a roomful of deadly snakes, so borrows some cans of hairspray from the Girl of the Week and uses this trope to clear a path. The third can refuses to ignite so he ends up throwing it at a king cobra.
-   Done in **The Mist**, by Stephen King, in both the book and the movie.
-   Smith of **The Red and the Rest** uses a can of spray paint and a cigarette to light a couch on fire, creating a heavy, flaming blockade.
-   In **RWBY: Roman Holiday**, Trivia attempts to escape her locked room by applying an Aerosol Flamethrower to try and melt the locks (Or maybe just expand the metal to make it easier to pick). Unfortunately, Trivia realizes a little too late that her door is made out of wood, and her room is full of flammable items.
-   **The Secret of the Ninth Planet**, by Donald A. Wollheim. A giant amoeba creature is about to devour an astronaut, but it's Immune to Bullets as it has no vital organs. So his companion disconnects his oxygen hose and ignites it with the muzzle flare of his pistol.
-   **The Tango Briefing** by Adam Hall. British spy Quiller is being held at gunpoint by Egyptian intelligence operatives, waiting for their leader to arrive. He's next to his car, so he removes the fuelcap (hidden behind his back) and drops a lit match into the petrol tank, turning it into an impromptu flamethrower.
-   In **Worm**, Skitter creates one of these in Monarch 16.11 by hitting a soldier who was trying to light a Molotov Cocktail with her pepper spray.

Aerosol Flamethrower Example in Live-Action TV

-   Faith made one using a stove lighter and a can of kitchen oil in **Angel** in order to torture Wesley, which led to the relevant episode being the only one in the whole series to be rated "18" for home video release in Britain.
-   **Burn Notice**'s Fiona Glenanne has pulled this trick a number of times, but in "Fast Friends", she combines this with a trashcan full of nail polish remover (which is largely made of acetate and extremely flammable) for a quick - and diversionary - bomb.
-   In the **Charmed (1998)** episode "The Day the Magic Died", the Halliwell sisters have to bring some nonmagical weapons into a meeting with demons, and the weapons have to be disguised as other things. One of them is an aerosol can of hairspray made into a flamethrower.
-   In the 2009 remake of **The Day of the Triffids**, the main character uses one of these to fend off a triffid.
-   In **Deadliest Catch** Edgar Hansen, deck boss on the crab boat **Northwestern**, likes to torment other crew members with these.
-   **The Flash**: In "Gone Rogue", Sherloque intends to use one of these against Queen Bee's robotic bees, but can't get it to work. So Cisco uses a breach to send the bees away instead.
-   Used by a naked Nikita in **La Femme Nikita** when her house is invaded.
-   Nate creates one in the **Leverage** episode "The Zanzibar Marketplace Job".
-   Frances' daughters make one out of Dawn's deodorant in a flashback in **The Librarians (2007)**.
-   Used in **Lost** by Locke to kill a polar bear in a season three episode.
-   Victoria plans to use a can of hairspray and a lighter on an ex-boyfriend in an episode of **Mike & Molly**. Mike manages to talk her down and take the can and lighter away from her.
-   **My Name Is Earl**: Joy threatens to torch a childhood enemy with this and Earl mentions that she tried to cook a Thanksgiving turkey that way. The can of hairspray she was using, combined with Earl trying to light a cigarette, had explosive results, too.
-   The **MythBusters** did this with pepper spray. While testing if a pepper spray-covered shirt was flammable, they tested different brands to see if the pepper spray itself was flammable; of five types they tried, two were non-flammable, one created a stream of fire, and the other two gave large flames typical of this trope.
    -   The test was inspired by an episode of **CSI** in which tasering a pepper-sprayed suspect set them on fire. (The Mythbusters themselves even get to make a cameo appearance in the expository scene where it's explained why the poor man went up in flames.)
-   In the Dutch reality TV series **Oh Oh Tirol** (basically a dutch **Jersey Shore**) Tatjana uses this to light a cigarette when she can't find a lighter. video at 0:24
-   In **Once Upon a Time**, Mary Margaret uses this against the Wraith.
-   Sam and Dean of **Supernatural** have been known to fall back on this tactic when their guns and other weapons don't do the job. Not very often (they've only done it twice), but when the situation calls for fire, they do what they have to.
    -   It's notable that the first time they did this, it was an improvisation on Dean's part, using a can of insecticide and a lighter to fight off invading bugs. In the later episodes where fire was the weapon of choice, the brothers can be seen constructing their own temporary flamethrowers out of gas bottles and copper piping.
-   In a Christmas Episode of **Brooklyn Nine-Nine**, Jake, Charles, and Gina end up locked in a department store that's swarmed with armed robbers, and neither Jake nor Charles have guns on them. Since she's a civilian, protecting Gina is their top priority, but she insists she wants to help and is quite eager to try this trope out. She gets her chance at the end of the episode when one of the robbers attempts to escape arrest, and Jake, for lack of any other ideas, tosses her a can of hairspray. She takes out her lighter, and the sudden burst of flame shocks the perp enough for him to fall over and be recaptured. And then Jake realizes he just gave Gina a working flamethrower.
    
    **Gina:** We don't need guns. I have a lighter, okay? We get some hairspray, make some flame throwers. Let's fry these bitches.  
    **Jake:** No one is frying any bitches!

Aerosol Flamethrower Example in Music

-   In the music video for Bon Jovi's "Always," the jealous boyfriend torches the artist's studio with the help of one. The version of the video that is most easily found online (such as on the band's official YouTube channel) has this part cut out for some reason, which results in the place going up in flames for no apparent reason.

Aerosol Flamethrower Example in Tabletop Games

-   They show up in **GURPS: High-Tech** but are unreliable, lack range, and get five seconds of firing time at best. They're still better than most improvised weapons, scarier too.
-   Stories have gone around of **Vampire: The Masquerade** players doing this. Based on standard game mechanics, this should be a brutally effective tactic against all but the most powerful vampires — if it doesn't outright kill your opponent, it will hurt them a **lot** worse than it would hurt a human, and will likely scare the living daylights out of them. However, the Game Master may have other ideas.
    -   In the New World of Darkness setting, **Hunter: The Vigil** actually has rather in-depth rules for finding the supplies for and utilizing an aerosol flamethrower. Even against creatures who aren't particularly vulnerable to flames, a lucky Hunter can set them on fire which is one of the most effective ways to kill almost anything.
    -   Building one of these as a vampire stalks the house is the example used for a time-limited extended action in **Innocents**.
-   In the **XXXenophile Collectible Card Game**, the illustration for the "Canned Heat" card shows a Green-Skinned Space Babe using the eponymous gizmo as an aerosol flamethrower to light her partner's post-coital cigarette.

Aerosol Flamethrower Example in Video Games

-   **77p: Eggwife** has a variant when you collect deodorant spray and combine it with your lighter.
-   One of the weapons in **Alone in the Dark (2008)**.
-   One of the new weapons featured in **Army Men II** happens to be this.
-   **Bad Day L.A.** has one for the player which has a Zippo style lighter attached to it.
-   This is one of the many weapons you can find in **Blood (1997)**. You can either use the traditional method or light it and toss it like a Molotov. Die Bug Die in **Blood II: The Chosen** works on the same principle, substituting the can of aerosol for a Cartoon Bug-Sprayer filled with extremely acidic and flammable bug spray.
-   A craftable weapon in **Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead**.
-   In **Daxter**, Daxter wields a spray gun that can paralyze metal bugs. Partway through the game, he gets an upgrade that lights the spray and makes it function as a flamethrower.
-   Of the many weapons in **Die Hard Arcade**, the lighter and especially the spray can seem all but useless at first. Then you put them together for results.
-   In **From Next Door**, Namie can wield one to hold off the creature and burn away the black substance blocking her front door. It does cause the house to catch fire as well, though.
-   In **Judgment**, Kengo uses one on Kaito when the family comes bailing Hamura the first time.
-   **Kill It with Fire** has one that's given to the player early in the game. In spite of its makeshift nature and the point of the game when it's received, it remains useful throughout most of the game.
-   You can do this with cans of hair spray in **Kingdom of Loathing**.
-   You have to make one in **Kingdom O' Magic**, in order to get rid of some seriously overgrown spiders.
-   Just one of many improvised weapons in **Marc Eckō's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure**.
-   In **Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake**, Snake has to use this against the final boss. He has to jury-rig/MacGyver the weapon out of bits and pieces lying around, all the while being hunted by the machine-gun wielding Big Boss, whom Snake then has to burn to death with the homemade makeshift motherfucking flamethrower. Having to do that is part of what causes Snake's Heroic BSoD that he ends up retiring over between this and the next game.
-   In **Police Quest 4: Open Season**, you take out the serial killer this way after you are knocked out and stripped of your inventory.
-   **Postal 2** gets one with the **A Week in Paradise** mod and Steam retail version. The effect looks more like slow-moving clouds of flame rather than a stream, which actually makes it useful for short-term area denial.<sup>Why?&nbsp;</sup>
    -   **Postal III** also gets one as the pepper spray's alt-fire.
-   When **Project Zomboid** introduced the Engineer profession, hairspray was among the household items an Engineer could work up into homebrew destructive contraptions. In this case, the unreliable handheld flamethrower is passed over for a fused incendiary bomb, basically a can of spray with a few sparklers held tightly in a wrapping of aluminum foil. With the addition of some Electrical skill and spare parts, the bomb can be upgraded with an adjustable timer, a proximity sensor, or a remote detonator.
-   **Resident Evil**:
    -   In the Mercenaries Reunion mode of **Resident Evil 5**, Rebecca Chambers uses an aerosol can flamethrower as her special attack when an enemy is shot in the head. Especially hilarious because she is depicted as a small, weak, and fragile girl.
    -   **Resident Evil 7**: The flamethrower weapon, The Burner, is an improvised number that is essentially a rig to automatically depress the nozzle on an aerosol can while lighting the fuel on the attached pilot light.
    -   **Resident Evil: Outbreak** allows you to fashion a hairspray flamethrower together as a weapon.
-   In **South Park: The Fractured but Whole**, Towelie's primary attack in his boss fight is to light you and Cartman on fire with this. It's actually necessary as a way to burn the weed piles.
-   Downplayed Trope in **Team Fortress 2**: The Pyro does not use actual aerosol cans for any of his/her/its flamethrowers, but they appear to be garden and garage tools hooked up to a tank of propane. In any case, they're implicitly stated to be homemade and most likely horribly dangerous to the user. It's most notable on the Degreaser and the Stock Flamethrower. Completely averted by the Phlogstinator, however, as it is powered by 'alchemy'.
-   In **Toy Soldiers: Cold War**, Levels 2 and 3 of the makeshift unit are different versions of these.
-   In **Until Dawn**, Josh suggests to Chris that he search the abandoned cabin for a can of spray deodorant to use in conjunction with his lighter to thaw out the lock on the front door, although it is never actually used against the killer itself.

        "OH GOD HOW CAN SHAVING CREAM BE SO FLAMMABLE"
        
    -   Later, during **Egbertbound**, one of the playable walkaround segments, John comes across a memorial commemorating brave salamander firefighters who gave their lives trying to contain a global firestorm that happened a short while before — by trying to smother it with more shaving cream, which backfired disastrously.
        
        **A memorial would be erected in their honor. It would be inscribed with the last words so frequently overheard, words of widsom to remember.  
        How can shaving cream be so flammable?  
        How indeed, brave heroes.  
        How indeed.**
        

-   **Last Res0rt** has a scene that features a young Celeste trying to threaten an Efreet with one of these. It doesn't work.
-   **Sequential Art**: Pip from strips #8 and #9 chooses to use aerosol deodorant and a cigarette lighter to kill a spider in his shared flat's bathroom. It generates way more flames than anticipated, damaging much of the bathroom and leaving Pip with Ash Face. The gag sequence is viewable starting here.
