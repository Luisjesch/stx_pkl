Awesome Moment of Crowning: 
"Now come the days of the king!  
May they be blessed."

_"Therefore I am sure that this, my coronation, is not a symbol of a power and splendor which are gone, but a declaration of our hopes for the future and the years, and for the years that I may, by God's grace and mercy, be given to reign and serve you as your Queen."_

This is when, at the end (usually) of the story, the main character or characters are crowned The Leader of the land they just saved. Reasons can vary:

-   The hero is part of the royal line, so this is done when the Rightful King Returns.
-   There was an Ancient Tradition.
-   The hero(es) defeated the old ruler(s), so You Kill It, You Bought It.
-   It's part of the Standard Hero Reward.
-   Their new king is always Offered the Crown.
-   He retrieved the legendary Royal MacGuffin of Royalty. Finders Rulers, nyeah nyeah!

Sometimes, it doubles as a coronation wedding with a Prince / Princess or the hero's Love Interest, guaranteeing a Happily Ever After of Happily Married conjugal bliss.

Compare Knighting. Contrast Cincinnatus.

The title is derived from "Crowning Moment of Awesome" (and they are very likely to intertwine), the former name of Moment of Awesome.

Considering that this is an Ending Trope, once again, **beware the spoilers!**

Awesome Moment of Crowning Example in Fan Works

-   **An Astral Drop in Heatherfield** appears to subvert this in the first attempt to crown Elyon ( It is a trap by Phobos being sprung by an imposter) but it is later played straight.
-   **An Empire of Ice and Fire** has Daenerys and Jon be crowned Empress and Emperor of the Targaryen Empire in Chapter 41.

-   **Perfect Mind**, a **Chrono Crusade** Alternate Universe fic, ends with Chrono and Rosette becoming the new rulers of the demons.
-   **Memoirs of a Master** has a wuxia version when Shifu and his companions, after an adventure that they had to sneak away from Master Oogway for, accept that they could live without becoming masters. At that very moment, Oogway shows and says that because of their self-sacrificing heroism, it's time that they receive their Master titles and dubs them right there and then.
-   "Kim Possible: The Next Generation" opens with Kim Possible an ensign on the **Enterprise**\-D (**Star Trek: The Next Generation**). In the course of the fic she is promoted to lieutenant, demoted back to ensign due to political pressure, and promoted all the way to the youngest lieutenant commander in the fleet after she and Ron save Earth from a devastating attack by Lore. The subsequent epilogue sees Kim promoted to become captain of the **Enterprise**\-E fifteen years later, having served as Picard's first officer for the last few years after Riker received his own command.
-   **Fist of the Moon**: There's one of the mid-story variety, where Usagi ascends from Moon Princess to full Moon Queen in a pillar of light and power. The **accidental collateral** effects include purifying an enemy that would usually have required use of the crystal, and imbuing another character with powers of their own.
-   **King of Kings, Ruling over Rulers**: Harry's coronation. The ceremonial procession involved having several cavalry squadrons following him as he ascended the Imperial District before entering the Palace of Ceremonies to be crowned as the Emperor of the Romans and also as the Russian Emperor.
-   **A New World**: After defeating the Lunarian assassin who killed the previous Great Tengu, Momiji is declared the new Great Tengu by right of conquest.

-   **Shadow and Rose** has three of these — the crowning of Orzammar's new king, the crowning of Ferelden's king, and the post-wedding crowning of Ferelden's queen-consort.
-   **Wearing Robert's Crown**: This takes place directly at the \**start\** of the fic although not literally since Drakebert becoming King is centered upon the throne not the crown. In canon it would have been all downhill from here. In this story, not so much.
-   **Fairy Without Wings** brings us Erza Scarlet, Fairy Tail's Sixth Guild Master.
-   While it involves no actual crown, one of the last chapters of **A Man of Iron** features Ned Stark being declared King in the North, to much celebration both in and out of universe.
-   In **Handmaid**, Anne Boleyn is crowned Princess Consort after giving birth to Edmund. Since she's technically joining the king and queen, the ceremony's not quite as elaborate as it would be for a monarch, but Anne's fine with that, since the end goal was always staying by Katherine of Aragon's side.
-   Chapter 35 of **A Dragon's Roar** sees Prince Daeron being crowned King of Westeros by his faction in defiance of Rhaegar and an open declaration of the Civil War that had broken out between the brothers.

Awesome Moment of Crowning Example in Myths & Religion

-   There's an allusion to one in the **Song of Songs**, from Song 3:11.
    
    **Go forth, O daughters of Zion,  
    and see King Solomon with the crown  
    with which his mother crowned him  
    on the day of his wedding,  
    on the day of the gladness of his heart.**
    
-   In The Bible, Joseph's ascension from a slave, to a prisoner, to Pharaoh's Number Two. The Pharaoh who put him in charge makes it clear that the **only** thing that differs between them is that Pharaoh is sitting on the throne; otherwise, Joseph has supreme authority over Egypt to do as he sees fit.
    
    "You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people are to submit to your orders. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you." So Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt." Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Joseph's finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck. He had him ride in a chariot as his second-in-command, and people shouted before him, "Make way!" Thus he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt. Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, but without your word no-one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt."

Awesome Moment of Crowning Example in Pro Wrestling

-   In the territorial era wrestlers would compete for the crown of South Texas. In 1971 Sylvester Stallone himself crowned of Sue Green after she defeated Joyce Grable, though this was well before any of the **Rocky** movies so his celebrity wasn't significant part of the draw.
-   This is the traditional ending to WWE's "annual" **King of the Ring** tournament. Of course, this being wrestling and all, they're not really being crowned king of anything, but simply being honored in a faux-coronation ceremony for winning the tourney. This doesn't stop most of the Heel winners from snapping and starting to behave as if they actually **were** the king of something.
    -   Notable "Kings of the Ring" who **really** ran with it include Harley Race, Randy Savage, Owen Hart and Booker T.
    -   This generally involves feuding with Jerry "The King" Lawler, who had used the gimmick in Memphis for decades previous to his entrance in WWE/F.

Awesome Moment of Crowning Example in Sports

-   Many sporting events have something similar to this for its winner. The event would be styled as 'King of the X' or something with 'Royal' in it. Often the winner ends up with a cape, crown, and throne for promotional photos.
-   The Olympic medal ceremony. All of them. Ever. Unless you're Michael Phelps. Phelps got a lot of flack in the international press for being disrespectful during some of his medal ceremonies. The footage of him **stretching his legs on the gold medal podium** ticked off a lot of people.
    -   Well, if you were wearing all eight gold medals while waiting for the National Anthem to be finished, you'd be stretching your legs too.
        -   Also, he had another swim coming up in a half hour or so and so he needed to loosen his muscles so he wouldn't risk cramping up.
    -   There was also the famous event of the gold and bronze winners (Tommie Smith & John Carlos) of the 1968 200 m relay doing the Black Power salute at the medal ceremony. That was considered far more shocking than Phelps' leg stretch.
    -   And then there was Shaun White, who played air guitar during the medal ceremony at the 2010 Olympics.
-   Averted at the 1995 EuroBasket tournament, when Croatia (who won bronze) abandoned the medal stage and walked out when Yugoslavia stepped up for their gold medals. Croatia was still bitter over the Croatian War of Independence and an incident in 1990 by Serbian player Vlade Divac.
-   The winner of golf's Masters Tournament getting the famous green jacket put on them by the previous year's winner.

Awesome Moment of Crowning Example in Theatre

-   The climax of the prologue of Modest Mussorgsky's opera **Boris Godunov** is the coronation of Tsar Boris Feodorovich, with tolling bells building up to an awesome triumphal chorus.
-   In **Cesare - Il Creatore che ha distrutto**, Giovanni de'Medici becomes a cardinal — a prince of the church — and gets a version of this when his teacher gives him his red hat after he passes questioning.
-   Set up and then subverted drastically in **King Charles III**. After months of being badgered to Abdicate the Throne for various reasons and by various parties, Prince Charles finally agrees to step aside and allow William & Kate to take up the mantle of King and Queen. But Charles hijacks the coronation by snatching the crown from the Bishop's hands and delivering some scathing commentary. He ultimately places it on Prince William's head, but it's clear that no-one is happy about how the coronation is turning out.
-   In **Pippin**, Pippin gets crowned king after killing his father, but the crown turns out to be one size bigger than his head.

Awesome Moment of Crowning Example in Webcomics

-   The **Order of the Stick** crew aren't very good at participating in these.
-   This early **Arthur, King of Time and Space** strip, and this somewhat later one.
-   A rare villain example: at the end of the **Sluggy Freelance** story arc "That Which Redeems," Lord Horribus's much abused sidekick Psyk is crowned the new Demon Lord after Horribus is cast out.
    
    **Psyk** **(now Lord Psykosis)****:** "Fellow demons and demonesses ... **I ROCK!**"
    
-   **Sam & Fuzzy**:
    -   The "Ninja Emperor" arc has been screwing around with this A LOT. First Sam doesn't want to be crowned but he's being dragged into it by Blank and opposed by Black, then we meet Gertrude who really ought to be getting crowned and resents the crap out of Sam because he has a semi-legitimate claim and she doesn't, then we find out that Blank doesn't want Sam, he just wants **somebody** to validate the command structure while Black wants to tear it down, then oh just read it. I swear. Crazy.
    -   Although Sam's actual crowning as the new Ninja Emperor isn't particularly awesome, his first decree is definitely an awesome moment for him.
-   **Homestuck**:
    -   This update, where Jack steals his Queen's ring and gains a huge boost in power, taking on a monstrous form as he does so.
    -   Also earlier, the Wayward Vagabond and the Aimless Renegade make a crown for the Windswept Questant (former White Queen). She promptly turns it down, giving it to Peregrine Mendicant instead, in gratitude towards PM for completing her duty.
-   **Girl Genius** has Agatha's official recognition and announcement as the new Lady Heterodyne, after eighteen years of there being no Heterodyne in Mechanicsburg. It's in the middle of a pitched battle, it's followed by the ringing of the Doom Bell which inflicts existential despair on anyone that hears it, and she's announced by her sentient castle. It's just as awesome as it sounds.
    
    **Agatha:** People of Mechanicsburg, the Castle is **mine!** ****I am the Heterodyne!****  
    **Castle Heterodyne:** Go on, the **whole thing!**  
    **Agatha:** **\[sighs\]** Okay, okay! ****Tremble before me!****

Awesome Moment of Crowning Example in Web Original

-   **The Fire Never Dies**: While it's an inauguration of an elected head of state rather than a coronation of a monarch, the inauguration of Eugene Debs as Premier of the American Socialist Union fits this, especially as it marks the conclusion of the first book.
-   **Life in a Game** has one, when Subplott finally regains his throne.
-   In **Ten Little Roosters**, Ryan Haywood dons a crown as he becomes the Sole Survivor of the Murder Plot of the series. Doubles as his "Mad King" persona from **Let's Play Minecraft**.
    -   He does it again, at least in Ink-Suit Actor style, in X-Ray & Vav when his character escapes from the asylum.
-   **WitchCraft SMP**: The new Supreme Witch is crowned by their predecessor after becoming the Sole Survivor in a Deadly Game against all of their fellow competitors.
