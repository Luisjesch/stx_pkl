Badass Longcoat: 
Follow

_"Handcrafted fur and skin outer layer will keep you warm and remind wolves that they should keep their distance."_

A Longcoat is the ideal action-hero garment, more practical than a cape but infinitely cooler than a sport coat or no coat. Also, a Longcoat of any level of "billowy-ness" makes an ideal cover for producing any number of weapons, tools, supplies, and whatnot. Certain styles of Longcoat are deliberately designed to distort the wearer's frame, making their wearer's access to Hammerspace almost believable to mundane eyes. This distortion of the wearer's real shape also makes it genuinely harder to land an accurate attack on them.

Like capes, longcoats capitalize on the dramatic effect of having something that flutters behind you. It's especially effective in animated or drawn material, where the coat can be shown billowing a lot more than it could in real life (and a lot more stylishly) — to the point that it really _does_ look like a cape. A variant involves jackets and excessively long shirts, but having less material to billow in the gusts necessarily makes such people seem less badass. And of course, when the wearer of a Badass Longcoat takes the coat off, it's a sign that he's about to do some major damage — he just doesn't want to get your blood on his coat. Additionally, a longcoat in fiction is rarely worn closed, and many are cut in such a way that closing them is impossible, giving the illusion of a broader chest and more masculine figure.

The most common types of long coats are dusters, trench coats and frock coats.<small>◊</small>

Dusters are longer overall, usually reaching nearly to the ankles. Since they're designed for horseback riding, they have a long slit up the back as far as the waist, and optional leg straps so they don't billow too much in the wind or while riding. Dusters are also generally cut along fairly boxy lines.

A trench coat, on the other hand, is usually more shaped, reaches to the knees or slightly below and the back slit generally only reaches mid-thigh or hip-level. Trench coats also usually feature a belt and epaulets. It should be noted that one way to tell if a trench coat indicates a spy or private investigator or is a Badass Longcoat is by whether it's buttoned and belted or not. A Badass Trenchcoat is never closed (unless it's on Humphrey Bogart).

An older variant of the trenchcoat is the greatcoat, a predecessor of the trench coat but usually much heavier, and with either a wider collar that can be turned up to protect against the wind or a short shoulder cape. Later greatcoats lost the cape, becoming a longer, heavier, double-breasted overcoat, but retaining the name. Greatcoats were typically worn either buttoned, losing some of their badassitude for style, or simply draped over the shoulders without putting the arms into the sleeves, greatly _increasing_ their badassitude. They're most often associated with 19th Century naval officers, Nazi SS officers, and Russian soldiers.

The Inverness cape<small>◊</small> is a lighter garment with a very similar appearance to the caped greatcoat. The cape, however, is longer, reaching slightly past the wrist rather than only to the elbow, and an Inverness cape has no sleeves at all.

Frock coats, in contrast to all of the above coats, are very exquisitely tailored coats usually made of wool, like a longer version of a sport coat, but much more formal. Variants also include, on occasion, materials such as leather and, depending on the time in which the piece takes place, even silk. As they are one of the most enduring and universal fashions in the history of men's clothing, they have many different variations in cut ranging from the square-cut military frock coats<small>◊</small> of the 1600s to the cutaway-style frocks<small>◊</small> of the mid-to-late 1700s, to the, again, square coats that every Victorian and Edwardian aristocrat can be seen wearing in all of your favorite period dramas. In all of these cases, the coat is not intended to be closed — most of the time they don't have buttonholes — although from the later 1790s through to around the 1870s, and later on in the 1920s, they could be worn either way. If you're watching a period piece from the 1600s to the start of World War II, chances are most, if not all, of your male characters are wearing some kind of frock coat.

Please note that they are not in any way overcoats.

Being that they are tailored, with pleated tails that reach down to around the knees and pleated vents that invariably end right at the waist (beneath two buttons sewn in for decoration), frock coats have a tendency to sway and billow as one walks or stands facing the wind, without the heaviness or general shapelessness of leather or canvas, which are the two materials that most trenchcoats, greatcoats, and dusters are made from.

_Moby-Dick_ features the "long-togged Scaramouche" (an evangelical preacher who has gained moral ascendancy over his crewmates) and _Oliver Twist_ has The Artful Dodger, making this at least Older Than Radio.

Going back even further is a coat called a Justacorps (essentially the long coats of the 17th and 18th centuries; think _Pirates of the Caribbean_), though it has to be worn a certain way to pull off the badass look.

A less modern example would be the Badass Long Robe. Cool Shades are a nice accessory, as are tacking on some Signature Headgear and a Cool Mask to achieve the Coat, Hat, Mask Effect. If the mask in question is a gas mask, then it's Gas Mask, Longcoat. The Badass Longcoat is often combined with a pair of guns, either revolvers for a western or a pair of semiautomatic pistols or submachine guns in the modern-day and beyond, for extra effect. Some characters will pack enough weapons in their longcoats to outfit a small army.

Longcoat-wearing heroes probably started with Westerns (for dusters) or Film Noir (for the classic trenchcoat), but became especially common in the public mind after _The Matrix_.

The Badass Longcoat is closely associated with Those Wacky Nazis (since Germans in war have been associated with wearing leather longcoats), The Stoic, the Trenchcoat Brigade, and (thanks to the Columbine High School massacre) the Spree Killer. Compare Badass in a Nice Suit, and contrast Not-So-Badass Longcoat. Not related to Badass Longcat. Not to be confused with Conspicuous Trenchcoat, a specific type of coat that is also long, or Coat Cape, where a coat is worn over the shoulder like a cape for what is often a similar visual effect.

(Please note that this trope is about the _coat_, not the _person_. Please include information about the _coat_ when adding examples, rather than simply listing a character. The coat is important.)

## Examples:



---
Badass Longcoat Example in Anime & Manga

-   **Assassination Classroom**: The best assassin in the world, the Reaper (a.k.a. God of Death), wears a black longcoat, as a modern allegory to the traditional Grim Reaper cloak.
-   Claire Stanfield from **Baccano!**. In the anime, he wears it with the button closed; in the Light Novels, he wears it open.
-   **Bakugan**:
    -   Masquerade, The Rival from the first season wears a long white tench coat obviously in contrast to Dan's nice jacket and Alice's coat thing, so Alice counts too with her yellow coat.
    -   Spectra Phantom the new Rival wears a red long coat with feathers all over it.
    -   When he returns in Mechtanium Surge he returns with an entirely new black outfit including a black long coat.
    -   Shun even gets something like this, in New Vestroia he wears a long green vest that looks and is just as awesome as a longcoat.
-   Given the post-apocalyptic (on Earth, at least) setting of **Battle Angel Alita**, it should come at no surprise how many of its characters wear Badass Longcoats.
    -   Dr. Daisuke Ido wears a leather trenchcoat and fedora when going out as a Hunter-Killer.
    -   Alita herself follows him pretty much, both in choice of a fashion and the material, switching to the cream-colored leather greatcoat as of mid-**Last Order**.
    -   Caerula Sanguis is virtually never seen without either her signature greatcoat or (in the flashback) the long fur coat and pillbox hat.
    -   Zazie wears a bulky threnchcoat into her final fight in the Z.O.T.T., mainly to hide the industrial amounts of weaponry she has brought to the fight, and the extra pair of servo-arms.
    -   Erika usually wears a shelter-cape when venturing to the Martian deserts as Frau X.
-   Jiro Mochizuki in **Black Blood Brothers** rocks a bright red one, like a lot of these examples. Doesn't fit Bring My Red Jacket, though.
-   Grell Sutcliff of **Black Butler**, after her first appearance, wears a long red greatcoat which billows very nicely and which she doesn't pull over her shoulders, making it look a little more drapey and almost shawl-like. Of course, it belonged to her partner-in-crime from her **first** appearance, and is a murder trophy. Sehe presumably doesn't pull it up because she **can't**, as Madame Red had much narrower shoulders. Still badass, though.
-   Sven (while with the IBI), Train (while with Chronos) and Belze from **Black Cat**. Here, though, Train's long black coat isn't so much a symbol of his badassitude but of his place in Chronos as an assassin; during most of the series, he wears a cropped black jacket over a long shirt, even though he's still pretty badass. Significantly, he dons his old coat again for a major showdown.
-   **Black Lagoon**:
    -   Hotel Moscow mob boss Balalaika wears a heavy wool Soviet Army greatcoat (which was designed to be worn in the subzero Russian winter) draped open over her shoulders on top of a low-cut dress business suit... in tropical Thailand. It exemplifies the trope.
    -   Rotton the Wizard isn't a badass, but his coat is. In a badass series that lives by the Rule of Cool, Lotton is trying so damn hard to look cool and act cool, all the way down to his Cool Shades and black, flaring badass longcoat, he fails so badly that even though Revy shoots him mid-entrance, she doesn't remember who he is later. But give the guy credit for being smart; the (bulletproof) coat's actually one reason he's still alive.
    -   And then there's Mr. Chang, the Chow Yun-Fat character. The few times we see him in action, he's wearing a very nice black longcoat with a big white scarf that looks like it came right out of a John Woo movie. He's awesome enough to earn Revy's respect (it's natural respect: **he** taught **her**), such as in one scene during the arc where he's introduced, where he stops a grenade with his foot and then kicks it right back into the throng of terrorists who threw it.
-   Most versions of the eponymous character from **Black★Rock Shooter**, long black coat with a cracked white star emblazoned at the back.
-   **Bleach**:
    -   Ichigo's robes transform into a long-sleeved, ankle-length black coat with red lining that is body-tight to his waist and then flares out dramatically for the rest of the length. It also acts as a Mana Meter. The more damaged it is, the less Life Energy he has remaining.
    -   The shinigami captains wear haori, a type of long coat, that often billow dramatically when they're fighting. Kyouraku, unique among the captains, has two. His captain haori is covered by a woman's kimono that is worn over his shoulders and which also billows dramatically when he fights.
    -   Ulquiorra Cifer's Las Noches uniform, with two tails that sweep the floor dramatically.
    -   Ishida wears something much like a great coat, to the point of having a spare cape when one is destroyed.
    -   The Sternritter wear long great coats underneath their capes.
-   **BNA: Brand New Animal**: Shirou Ogami wears a long trench coat for most of the series and is a strong crime-fighter who can transform into a wolf.
-   Osamu Dazai from **Bungo Stray Dogs** wears a long tan trench coat and we already know that he's badass. Then there's Akutagawa Ryunosuke with his long black coat and his Rashomon ability.
-   Jo from **Burst Angel** wears a Badass Longjacket, though she usually takes it off during combat.
-   **Buso Renkin**: The primary part of Captain Bravo's Silver Skin is a silver trench coat that has the highest defensive capability of any buso renkin. He can also fire it at an opponent to restrain them.
-   Mikuni Souichirou of **\[C\] – Control** wears a badass longcoat/overcoat. He removes his coat for fights.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> He has a waistcoat under it.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
-   Tooya from **Ceres, Celestial Legend** wears a trench coat (with shades and stoicism, to boot) at the beginning of the series, while he's still working for the Mikages. Additionally, he wears a labcoat when he disguises himself as a doctor at Aya's school, pulling off a couple of wicked rescues while he's there.
-   **Chrono Crusade** adores this trope.
    -   While Chrono's normal outfit includes a long red coat with tails and a shoulder cape, he appears to be a twelve-year-old boy, and the rest of his outfit is fairly dorky looking. However, when he goes into his badass true form of a demon he **loses** the coat, his coat being replaced by wings. It's possible his coat is supposed to be a visual reference to the wings he has in his true form.
    -   The villain Aion is a straighter version of the Badass Longcoat. His coat is white with a dark lining and a double belt (which he always keeps open). He seems rather fond of his coat — he's worn it since the 1870s! In his demon form his armor also has an open skirt around his pants which mimics the look (much like Remington, see below).
    -   Joshua wears a long black coat with his suit that looks appropriately dramatic when he uses his demonic powers.
    -   Father Remington's exorcist uniform includes an odd skirt-like cape around his pants when, combined with a jacket, somewhat mimics the effect of a badass greatcoat.
-   Ryo Saeba from **City Hunter** usually dons this as part of his default dress code. It does more than make him look cool — the coat also contains bits and pieces of firearms and explosives that Ryo actually has to utilize during the series, plus condoms (this is Ryo we're talking aobut, after all).
-   Mao<small>◊</small> from **Code Geass** wears a white great coat, studded with black belts and blue trim. Jeremiah Gottwald sports an incredibly badass coat in R2, white and purple with a gold trim. Ohgi and Tohdoh wear trench coats in R2 as well.
-   A couple of episodes of **Cowboy Bebop** feature Spike wearing a badass duster. Notably, he tends to go for the duster when things really get serious (usually when Vicious is involved), and mainly so he can carry more weapons. The Big Bad of **Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door**, Vincent Volaju, sports a dark one as well.
-   Hei from **Darker than Black** sports a green-lined black longcoat. The longcoat is even bulletproof, but only when **he** wears it.
-   Watari, the mysterious guardian and right-hand man to L in **Death Note**. He wears a trench coat, dark glasses and a trilby hat when working with L outside of headquarters to conceal his identity as a notorious inventor named Quillish Wammy.
    -   Teru Mikami, Light's Dragon, wears a big black flowing one while writing epically, Light himself sometimes wears a white one<small>◊</small>, and Raye Penber wears a popped-collar blue-black Conspicuous Trenchcoat everyday. Word of God says **The Matrix** was a major influence for several character designs.
-   In **Descendants of Darkness**, Dr. Muraki Kazutaka is almost always seen in a white trench coat, while Tsuzuki Asato sports the black variety.
-   Mephisto of **Demon City Shinjuku** wears a long red coat which billows out dramatically in convenient winds.
-   The first set of uniforms for the Exorcists in **D.Gray-Man** were longcoats (cross out Lavi and Lenalee, who wore a jacket and a miniskirt, respectively). The well-known black and white (silver-buttoned) longcoats were abandoned after the journey in Noah's Ark, and the Exorcists wore red and black jackets instead (save for Kanda, who just has to keep the longcoat outfit).
-   Reina in **Didn't I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?** has a Baroque-era frock coat, which is black with gold trim and cut away at the front. It's a lot lighter than other mages' heavy robes, but still gives her the typical conical silhouette of a mage.
-   Gainax's OVA sequel to **GunBuster**, **DieBuster**, features Dix-Neuf, a Humongous Mecha that wears a gigantic duster. Rule of Cool to the max.
    -   Oh, it's far more than simply Rule of Cool. Firstly, it houses rocket engines used to fly when not in screw-you-physics mode. Secondly, he can throw it off so it will form a Wave-Motion Gun which fires by itself. It also covers a face on his back.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
-   Rika/Ruki in **Digimon Tamers** (Word of God: one of her early character models was a character from **The Matrix**), and Captain Sampson/Satsuma and BanchouLeomon in **Digimon Data Squad**.
    -   For added BA points for Rika/Ruki, her longcoat is PASTEL YELLOW! And yet she still looks incredibly BA and awesome.
-   Bolt Crank from **Eat-Man** sports a floor-length trench coat while firing an assortment of 'uge freekin guns one handed. Interestingly, he doesn't actually keep the weapons in his coat. Instead, he just keeps all of his miscellaneous BFGs, BFSs, bombs, and... steam train locomotives... in a sort of built-in Hammerspace inside of his body.
-   Re-L Mayer, fitting with the cyberpunk setting, wears a black duster throughout the entirety of **Ergo Proxy**.
-   Though introduced by the very end of the story, the 2nd ending of the **Fafner in the Azure: Dead Aggressor: Exodus** shows Kazuki, Soushi and the rest of the main pilots wearing the imposing navy-blue greatcoats with red piping, which boosts their Badass levels through the roof.
-   **Full Metal Panic!**:
    -   Leonard Testarossa's auto-guarding coat is a good example of one. It repels throwing knives and bullets by fluttering around for a bit while all you need to do is standing there with your hands in your pockets looking smug. It does not seem to protect him from bitchslaps, however.
    -   From the novels and the manga, Kurama also sports one, though without any technological enhancements. And it only shows up in one or two official illustrations, but... Gauron apparently has one as well.
-   The standard uniform of the Amestrian military in **Fullmetal Alchemist** is designed to give the illusion of a badass greatcoat.
    -   Ed wears a red duster, but has yet to be dismembered while wearing it (his missing limbs were before the coat). Unless you count the number of times his automail has broken, but otherwise, he's good. He makes a point of wearing a red coat anywhere for various reasons (the biggest being to cover up his automail). In one chapter, as his group is heading for what appears to be the final confrontation, he buys a roll of red cloth and transmutes it into his signature jacket, most likely to show that he means business.
        -   Ed practically lives on this trope. He wears a black trenchcoat with a white shirt behind<small>◊</small> after their first confrontation with Father.
    -   The new Greed himself wears a black longcoat / changshan.
    -   The Briggs Brigade had **full longcoat** for their standard uniform. In manga universe, there are reasons for it, since they are stationed in the cold permafrost of Briggs mountain, but for us, it shows that that they are the most badass group in the Amestris army.
    -   Roy Mustang even tops the Amestrian uniform by wearing a coat over it, to give note of his Colonel Badass status. Granted, it's also part of the uniform, but he often only wears it around his shoulders when the weather does not indicate the need for an extra coat, and he and Hawkeye are the ones seen wearing it the most often.
    -   Kimblee combines this look with his all-white ensemble of a Nice Suit and hat, and is easily one of the best-dressed characters in the series.
-   Katana from **Gad Guard** wears a longcoat in contrast to the majority of the show's other main characters, who tend to prefer scarves (at least, when riding their Humongous Mecha).
-   Forte Stollen of the **Galaxy Angel** series and games is the eponymous Angel Brigade's senior, most battle-hardened and possibly strongest member and resident gunslinger, and always wears a near-ankle-length frock coat in and out of combat. All the less-actiony girls wear hip-length or shorter coats, while the Brigade's other main Action Girl, Ranpha Franboise, embodies a different trope and dresses accordingly.
-   Kuroudou Akabane in **Get Backers**: long, black and very elegant. Ban Mido would fall under the "excessively long shirt" subset.
-   Ryoma Nagare from **Getter Robo Armageddon** combines this with Scarf of Asskicking and Hot-Blooded Sideburns.
-   Naru from **Ghost Hunt** has one as well and definitely is a Badass Bookworm... among other things.

-   In the 5th opening of **Gintama**, Takasugi is shown sporting a long dark trench coat while fighting hordes of aliens with Gintoki, Katsura, and Sakamoto in what appears to be a hopelessly one-sided battle.
-   Gai in **Guilty Crown** wears one as the leader of the Funeral Parlor group. Shu takes it for himself and adds a Scarf of Asskicking after Gai dies.
-   Brandon "Beyond The Grave" Heat from **Gungrave** in both the anime and video game. He wears an intricately detailed purple coat with a large Gothic cross emblazoned on the back. And **lots** of little studs and buttons. Even in normal clothes he wears a black longcoat that is mostly prominent in the anime (in the game he's seen wearing it only in the opening and quickly changes to his "battle suit").
-   **Gunslinger Girl**. Triela, a cybernetic pre-teen assassin and probably the best fighter in the series, often wears long coats that go with her Twin Tails, having been influenced by her handler to dress in masculine clothes. Even after she changes to a feminine skirt she still wears the coat (in fairness, it's winter). When it's hot or she has to engage in a lot of physical activity however she won't wear it, though continues to wear a waistcoat and tie.
-   Radinov in the **Gunsmith Cats** anime wears a bulletproof one but can't be bothered to keep it closed even during gunfights — either because she carries most of her arsenal inside it or because she's batshit insane.
-   Van in **GUN×SWORD** doesn't just wear a long coat, he wears a full tailcoat.
-   **Hellsing**:
    -   Alucard's signature longcoat is deep crimson.
    -   Luke Valentine, who wears a long white coat.
    -   Alexander Anderson and the other vampire-hunting priests of Section XIII Iscariot wear grey cassocks. When their leader Maxwell is appointed head of the Crusade, he dons a dark blue one, but wears it tightly-buttoned.
    -   Integra sometimes wears one too; when she does, it's a brown one, styled somewhere between a trench coat and a greatcoat
    -   The Major. His is a grey military-style greatcoat.
    -   The Captain too, whose badass quotient is enough to easily stand up to the Charles Atlas Superpowered Battle Butler and have his tails do the bat-wing flutter even though it's a fully buttoned, double-breasted affair. Bonus points for also putting No Shirt, Long Jacket into play.
-   **Hetalia: Axis Powers**:
    -   Romania also wears a rather nice one, though Himaruya can't seem to decide on which color is it.
    -   Russia has a rather iconic one and his older sister Ukraine also wears one with her own military uniform in a
    -   The Netherlands is shown wearing one.
-   Jotaro Kujo from Part 3 of **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure**. A dark blue greatcoat style, with a tan or grey lining for added impact when it flairs out. Upgraded to a white Labcoat of Science and Medicine for his Part Four and Five appearances, then a purple coat with gold trim in Part Six.
-   Aya and Yoji of **Knight Hunters** both wear long coats, but it's not until the sequel series **Weiß Kreuz Glühen** that they upgrade to properly billowing Badass Longcoats.
-   **Macross Frontier** gives a longcoat to Brera Sterne in The Movie while retaining all his levels in badass.
-   In **Magical Record Lyrical Nanoha Force**, Nanoha, Fate, Hayate, Signum and Vita appear to sport trench coats as their regular attire. In Hayate's case, it's a Coat Cape.
    -   Fate already had this since StrikerS, with her Barrier Jacket in Impulse Form. Under her damn awesome, shining white cape.
    -   Hayate, Dearche, Signum, Subaru and Yuri sport a battle attire similar to Archer's (see F/SN example below). Like him, they achieve an effect similar to the actual longcoats of their allies.
    -   Chrono Harlaown has been rocking a black longcoat as both uniform and Barrier Jacket since the first season.
    -   Cinque likes trench coats and eyepatches. Her Shell Coat has even defensive functions.
    -   Erio and Harry white long coats as a part of their Barrier Jackets. Luka and Mia, two of Harry's gang, wear white coats similar to Harry's.
    -   Among the Hückebein family, Cypha and Fortis have a white and black long coat, respectively. While Cypha looks definitely badass with it, Fortis has to do anything badass yet.
-   The military setting and 1930-esque era of **Maiden Rose** mean that Badass Longcoats abound. Taki's tendency towards appearing with dramatic wind probably makes his the most prominent example though.
-   In **Mobile Suit Gundam AGE**, both Flit Asuno and Woolf Eneacle wear one during Asemu's Arc. Then, during the Kio Arc and the Three Generations Arc, Captain Ash (Asemu Asuno) wears a pretty badass coat too.
-   **Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn**: Marida has a purple overcoat as part of her civvie ensemble. When she fights Banagher the light gravity adds a lot of movement to the outfit. Unfortunately the coat is a liability in a fight as Banagher grabs ahold of her by it and drags her off the edge of the platform they were on.
-   **My-Otome** with Garderobe headmistress Natsuki Krüger and her dark-blue longcoat.
    -   The trope also applies to a handful of Robes, chief among them Natsuki's, Haruka's, and Shizuru's.
-   Several characters in **Naruto** don one of these:
    -   All the Kages officially get one.
    -   Minato had an additional one of his own, with the kanji for "Fourth Hokage" written on the back.
    -   Naruto wears one throughout during his fight with Pain.
    -   Naruto gets a new one made of **chakra** when he finally gains full control over Kurama, the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox.
    -   The standard Akatsuki uniform consists of a black coat with red clouds. A running theme seems to be whenever an Akatsuki member is forced to discard or has their coat destroyed, they're going to die in that fight.
    -   Mitarashi Anko wears a cream-colored badass longcoat. And not a whole lot underneath.
    -   Morino Ibiki is also usually seen wearing a longcoat.
    -   Madara Uchiha's Susano'o sports one in its complete, perfect state.
-   Some high-ranking Marines in **One Piece**, since a large, white greatcoat is standard uniform issue for them: Admiral Aokiji when he was Vice-Admiral Kuzan, complete with Sinister Shades; Captain Hina and Vice-Admiral Garp, although the former usually takes her Marine coat off, and the latter does it when he gets **serious**. Admiral Kizaru, also complete with Scary Shiny Glasses (sort of, he's always cheery, but he's every pirate's worst nightmare); Fleet Admiral Sengoku: His white Marine greatcoat is oversized.<small>◊</small>
    -   One Piece takes the coats-are-like-capes aspect of this trope to extremes by having very few high-ranked Marines ever actually wear their longcoats. Instead, they tend to drape the coats over their shoulders, with the sleeves billowing in the wind along with the rest of the coat. Despite this, the coats **never fall off**, even when the wearers leap through the air, fight in violent battles against dozens of pirates, or get sent flying by stronger opponents. This is a justified phenomenon.
    -   This trick is also practiced by Crocodile, who does it with a pimpin' fur coat. **In the desert.** (Justified, considering that he's made of sand.)
    -   Luffy himself gets an unbelievably cool black longcoat<small>◊</small> in the tenth movie, as if he wasn't badass enough. He later starts wearing a less cool but still impressive one in the series proper during the Wano Arc.
    -   Speaking of movies, **One Piece Film: Z** gives us Z and one of his Co-Dragons Ain, who both wear badass longcoats.
    -   Dracule Mihawk also sports a very badass coat which comes in black and red, complete with a high collar that puts the "vampire" in his vampire-pirate-musketeer aesthetic. Really it's more like a jacket that happens to also be a cape, but it's functionally a Badass Longcoat all the same.
-   **Pokémon: The Original Series**: Meowth wears a noir looking trenchcoat in **Go West Young Meowth** giving him a mysterious, and tough look as he tells about his rough past. Along with his humanlike stance, it additionally helps to make him more distinct from the other Meowth in the episode.
-   Yomiko Readman of **Read or Die** appears to subvert this trope with her trenchcoat full of paperbacks, newspapers and magazines... Until you realize that a Paper Master can do anything with that much paper on hand.
-   Darkness Aoi<small>◊</small>, the closest thing that **Ring X Mama** has to a Big Bad, is often wearing one.
-   Aoshi's cream trenchcoat (always unbuttoned, with the wide belt hanging/blowing in the wind dramatically) in **Rurouni Kenshin**.
-   The demon general Neberios from **Samon the Summoner** often wears one over a more professional looking attire.
-   Kyuzo in **Samurai 7**, an SF adaptation of Kurosawa Akira's original Jidaigeki film **Seven Samurai**. Unofficially is the most skilled of the samurai, possibly exceeding the group's experienced leader, and definitely the most deadly. Sports blonde hair and a distinctive crimson-red coat.
-   In **Sands of Destruction**, Morte wears a long, hot pink, fitted coat. Agan wears a long green coat, but he's just a Not-So-Badass Longcoat in the anime. The manga does at least give him one Offscreen Moment of Awesome at the end, and he **did** previously trek through a blizzard with just that coat for protection (while Kyrie and the others who'd gone on ahead had the sense to don proper winter coats).
-   The eponymous character of **Shakugan no Shana** wears a long coat that also doubles as Hammerspace.
-   **GTO: The Early Years**: Akutsu wants to get his hands on the coat formerly worn by the legendary Kyosuke Masaki, founder of the Midnight Angel gang. Before he died, Masaki gave the Oni-Baku the coat, on the condition that they make sure "Midnight Angel never rides again". When Eikichi puts it on, he becomes a One-Man Army and Akutsu's cronies think that it's the avenging spirit of Masaki come to punish them.
-   **Slayers NEXT**'s Gaav sports a suitably badass orange longcoat.
-   **Sola**: Takeshi, who fights with a sword and darts that explode into light wears a long black trench coat.
-   Maka Albarn from **Soul Eater** sports a kickass black longcoat with two large buttons and defined shoulders that makes for awesome emphasis whenever she jumps around.
-   Saiga in **Speed Grapher** usually has one of the shorter examples, but one opening shows it billowing like a Batman-style Badass Cape. The villain Suitengu has a longer one that doubles as a Pimp Coat.
-   In his Galactic Pretty Boy persona, Takuto Tsunashi of **Star Driver** wears a **Fabulous** Longcoat!
-   In **Sunday Without God**, both Hampnie and Julie sport this. The ends of Hampnie's coat are rather tattered, while Julie's is in better condition.
-   In **Sword Art Online**, when Kirito lands the killing blow on the first floor boss, he gets a unique item drop — the Black Cloak of Midnight. He keeps this for the rest of the series, and it is one of the reasons he becomes known as the Black Swordsman.
    -   Actually, it is briefly mentioned (in the Light Novels) that he didn't actually keep the Midnight Cloak; he just replaces it with a better model later on. Always black though. Exactly **how** he got the one he was wearing for the finale of the SAO arc is never explained.
-   **Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann** with Kamina and later on Simon, while they're kicking ass in space, who both wear these kinds of clothing. Kamina's longcoat is an interesting example in that it technically is a cape, but he usually wears it like a longcoat kind of fashion. Both come off in more action-filled scenes. Countless bonus points added for having the flaming skull with Triangle Shades on the back.
-   **Tokyo Ghoul** has a few examples of this. The majority of the CCG tend to wear white greatcoats when out on missions, and some ghouls sport them as well, with a notable example being that worn by Lantern in the Prequel **Jack**. In this case, the coat's use in practical as it helps conceal her true age and gender.
-   **Trigun**'s Vash the Stampede's is geranium-red duster which should warn people, but his opponents usually think he's a harmless idiot. You can buy the red duster or an impressive leather replica. Vash has other reasons as well for the long coat: hiding the effects of heavily subverted Hollywood Healing and his black...leather...body-armour...stuff. You have to assume this stuff is really practical desert wear for some reason. Although he also just likes the coat because the red has sentimental meaning for him.
    -   Actually it is practical, because as it's revealed in the manga, it has a cooling mechanism that keeps him from overheating, which is great to be perfectly honest.
        -   It's pretty much a Fremen stillsuit.
-   Abel Nightroad in **Trinity Blood** wears a black-with-silver-trim greatcoat that billows nicely when he activates his Crusnik powers.
-   **Vampire Knight**: Worn by Rido at his battle against Yuuki and Zero. Kaname likes to wear these too.
-   In **Witch Hunter Robin**, the title character of the series was badass in her own right, and not coincidentally, she also wore a red long-coat.
    -   Actually, **most** of the Hunters take to longcoats when they are on the hunt.
-   When Seishirou and Subaru are introduced in **X/1999**, both sport badass longcoats, with Seishirou's in black and Subaru's in white.
    -   Fuuma appears to have a closet just **full** of a wide variety of stylish longcoats. He owns one that is both black **and** white (very appropriate to the character).

    -   Kaiba in the original series has several long coats, starting with a blue duster, then a studded purple one, before settling to his trademark white one.
    -   Honda, The Big Guy of the group, and one of the first characters to ride a motorcycle long before the spinoffs became all about card games on motorcycles, often wears a long brown trenchcoat. He's not cool enough for it to defy gravity, though, so it only flares out a little.
    -   Dark Bakura, the main villain of season five, changed his blue shirt for a black coat.
        -   Thief King Bakura, the past life of Dark Bakura, wears a long, red coat for the majority of his screentime.
    -   Manjoume in **Yu-Gi-Oh! GX** wears a black trenchcoat. In the first season, despite it being the school uniform, only his coat has the **Yu-Gi-Oh!** Rival requisite gravity-defying flare.
    -   Darkness , also Fubuki Tenjouin, sports possibly the best one in GX-black with gold trimmings.
    -   Ryo adopts a black duster after his Freak Out transformation into Hell Kaiser.
    -   Judai trades in his jacket for a longer coat after coming through his Break the Cutie arc.
    -   In **Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds**, the requisite badass longcoat is worn by anti-hero Jack Atlas, who ironically spends more time in his skintight bodysuit rather then utilizing the full dramatic effect of his coat. Further exemplified in third season, where he wears a completely over the top long coat that can only be described as a 'White Pimp Suit'.
    -   **Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL** continues the time-honoured tradition, this time with Kaito Tenjo taking up the requisite rival coat handle. While his doesn't defy gravity so much due to being pointy, it makes up for it by being able to change colour from black to white when he duels. The Arclight siblings and Tron also have badass coats of varying length, though Tron's and V's are probably the closest to a typical Badass Longcoat length.
    -   **Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V** notably has Reiji Akaba eschew a coat in favor of a Scarf of Asskicking. The wearer of the longcoat is instead Shun Kurosaki, the no-nonsense member Lancers and of the Xyz Dimension Resistance group. Also is Yuri, who combines this with the addition of a Badass Cape, Waistcoat of Style, and even a Badass Long Robe at one point.
    -   **Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS** returned to the trend with main rival and first season Big Bad Revolver/Varis wearing one in LINK VRAINS, though in real life he's underdressed if anything. Most of the Knights of Hanoi bar Spectre wear one as well.
-   From **YuYu Hakusho** Hiei the Swordsman's jacket is a cross-breed of a longcoat and a Badass Long Robe.
    -   Karasu rocks the trench coat and Cool Mask look.
    -   Kuwabara gets a white one close to the end of the Dark Tournament; he doesn't take it off even when it gets battle-damaged and bloodied.

Badass Longcoat Example in Comic Books

-   In **100 Bullets**, Agent Shepperd wears brown trench coat as a signature piece of wardrobe and the guy proves why he's the only one in the series who deserves to wear it. It appears to be a status symbol of the trust's Warlord As Lono is shown to be wearing it when he takes over the job after Shepperd is killed.

-   Batman:
    -   The Joker has been wearing a purple or black trenchcoat since Marshall Rogers first drew the character with one in the mid-1970s.

-   Knuckle Duster of **El Marvo** wears a black long coat that has a hoodie.
-   Foolkiller often wore a trenchcoat over his costume or disguise. Especially in the 10 issue miniseries. This incarnation (Kurt Gerhardt) was much more discreet than his predecessors. At the time this series was written, the badass image of long coats hadn't quite ingrained itself, at least not in comics. In a typical urban area, a trenchcoat was still considered nondescript, mundane, unmemorable attire.
-   Onomatopoeia, a Green Arrow villain with a long, black, and definitely badass trench coat.
-   Flint Henry's reincarnation of **Grimjack** has John Gaunt aka Jim Twilly making his entrance in a dark purple greatcoat with gold embroidery. The coat is later shown to hold about 50 lbs. of guns and edged weapons when he is busted by robot cops.

    -   Lampshaded in **The Books of Magic** where a meeting of mystical characters (Constantine, Dr. Occult, Phantom Stranger, & Mr. E) are all wearing trenches. (The Phantom Stranger wears a Cool Cape and suit combination, but he's still included in the group.) The trope Trenchcoat Brigade was coined by John himself.
        
        **Constantine:** **Just** what the world's been waiting for. The **Charge of the Trenchcoat Brigade.**  
        **The Stranger:** I **heard** that, John Constantine.

-   The Question. His coat is so badass that he wears it as a civilian **and** a vigilante, though it changes color from nondescript brown to vibrant blue when the Question goes into action. He uses special laundry detergent which, combined with the gas he uses to make his mask stick, reacts chemically and makes his clothes change colour.
-   **The Sandman (1989)** — Dream wears one. It's black, long enough to drag on the floor, and has a really great collar. It also billows strangely, regardless of wind or movement. Justified: Dream is a very dramatically inclined Anthropomorphic Personification, and making his coat billow dramatically in the wind (even without wind) would be right up his alley. Depending on his mood, who's drawing the comic and which character is perceiving him, it can change into a Badass Long Robe.
-   The heroes of Frank Miller's **Sin City** have also been known to don the Badass Longcoat.
    -   Marv's longcoats tend to get ripped to shreds during big fights, requiring him to find another big longcoat, usually off a bad guy. There was a one-shot where he wakes up in a new coat, with no memory of where he got it and tries to work out where it came from.

-   **Über** gives badass Soviet Maria 'Katyusha' an equally badass longcoat.
-   Ultimate Marvel's Bombshell wears a long white coat as part of her superhero outfit. She likely got the idea from her mother, who wore a similar coat in her career as a super-crook.
-   **Watchmen**: Rorschach's brown trenchcoat is iconic to the character, adding to his hard-boiled detective look.. It also serves as a nice contrast with the capes his fellow superheroes wear.

    -   Gambit is seldom seen without his brown longcoat, the sleeves of which being a perfect place to store his signature weapon.
    -   Prodigy of the New X-Men: Academy X had a white one. Lampshaded when his friend Elixir ribbed him about it and said he couldn't tell if Prodigy was trying to copy Gambit or Shaft.

Badass Longcoat Example in Fan Works

-   The first thing Travis Grey did upon pickpocketing a Green Lantern ring was to create a costume for himself; black shirt, black leather pants, and one Badass Longcoat of black leather.

The **second** thing he did was start rounding up crack dealers and scaring the shit out of the local gangs.
-   In **Amazing Fantasy**, the Prowler wears a longcoat compared to her comic counterpart's cape. It's emblazoned with the kanji for "risk" and danger" to emphasize her Thrill Seeker tendencies.
-   In **The Butcher Bird**, Yoshimura Kaneki eventually gets his hands on one of the Marine officer coats from the One Piece example above, and immediately replaces the 'Justice' (正義) insignia with 'Retribution' (冥罰). Part of his stated reason for doing this is to annoy the Marines who currently have to tolerate his presence.
-   **Child of the Storm** has a couple, most notably Harry Dresden and his big black duster.

-   Alim Surana in this **Dragon Age** fanfic has one. It's made of suede and leather and is dyed black. He didn't originally have it, but the Warden Commander decided that, since Alim is the most powerful out of all of them, he should have an appropriately badass attire. He seems to have made it a habit of generating his own Dramatic Wind whenever he's in the center of attention too.
-   J.Z. in **Erin's Total Magical Adventure**, wears a black leather duster which he bought for 200 bucks — some think he's a cowboy because he wears it.

-   Invoked Trope in **Jericho (MLP)**. Jericho himself wears a leather duster because cowboys wear them and cowboys are cool, thus wearing one should also make him cool. It doesn't make him cool. At all.
    
    "One always overcompensates for disabilities. I've been thinking of having my entire body surgically removed. But until the day that happens, I'll just stick to wearing awesome outfits; they make me feel cool."

-   **Naru-Hina Chronicles**:

-   Takeru Takaishi wears one of these in the **Tamers Forever Series**.

-   **Voyages of the Wild Sea Horse**: As a Captain in the World Government's Navy, Chaser Kiyoshi wears the standard impressive jacket with the kanji characters for "JUSTICE!" emblazoned on the back. But her version is different, in that it's also lined with interwoven metal plating that makes it double as a suit of armor and a training aid. This explains her fondness for dramatic coat-shedding when she gets into a fight.
-   The entirety of the Oogakari clan from **Yet again, with a little extra help** wear these, with only Shadow not having flames at the bottom.

After the release of the first film wearing similar coats became a trend among young men in Hong Kong, and the style of coat is still sometimes referred to as "Brother Mark's Coat."

-   Eric Draven (played by the late Brandon Lee) in **The Crow**. He takes it off Tin Tin, the first of the guys responsible for murdering him and his fiancee. He sets it aside when he finishes them off... and after it's filled with holes from about five hundred bullets.
-   **Darkdrive**: Falcon wears a slick black longcoat for no other reason than to make him look cool. He doesn't really live up to it, as he's repeatedly beaten up by mooks.
-   In **The Dark Knight Rises**, Bane rocks a fur-trimmed long coat for the second half of the film. A lot of work went into the coat, and it definitely shows.
-   All of the Blackwater Gang wear long dusters in **Dead in Tombstone**. As does Satan when he appears on Earth.

-   In **Escape from L.A.**, Snake is given a special all-black outfit to wear for his mission, which includes a long black trenchcoat. Unfortunately, it gets stolen by a mook early on, but Snake runs into the same mook near the end and makes a point of stealing it back from his corpse.
-   The **Fantastic Beasts** series is a huge fan of this trope so far — nearly every character gets their own. There's Newt's off-grey and blue coats, Tina's grey one in the first film, and then her badass black leather trench in the second, Queenie's pink floor-length, Jacob's brown one, Grindelwald's black, the leather trench coats of the Aurors, Dumbledore's corduroy number, Seraphina Picquery's black coat with the bedazzled thunderbird insignia on the back, and the velvet and leather long coats of Grindelwald's acolytes, namely Vinda Rosier, Krall, Carrow, and Abernathy.

-   In **Ghost Rider (2007)**, Carter Slade wears a long black duster. The flowing-out-behind-him aspect shows up best in the "Final Ride" scene (starting at about 1:00 in), and makes a striking contrast to Johnny's waist-length tight-fitting motorcycle jacket.
-   Snake Eyes briefly gets a black badass longcoat for **one scene** in **GI Joe The Rise Of Cobra**. This being G.I. Joe, it's included in an action figure, too. The Baroness has one as well.

-   The team of assassins in **Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man** all wear black bulletproof coats.

Which he uses to waste more than 30 enemy mooks in the subsequent shootout. Unsurprsingly, this coat shows up on most of the film's DVD covers and posters.
-   In **Highlander**, pretty much all Immortals wear coats. For example, Connor MacLeod wears a typical trenchcoat in the present-time scenes. Unusually for a trenchcoat, he wears it open with the belt dangling. Then again, he needs something long to conceal his sword in The '80s' New York, and he needs to draw it quickly occasionally.
-   Linda in **Hollow Man** wears a good-looking calf-length leather jacket in several scenes.
-   In each of the first two **Home Alone** films Kevin's mom wears a badass full-length overcoat that subtly underscores her Determinator/Mama Bear nature. Likewise, the burglar Harry's getup in each film consists of a grungy calf-length overcoat, which along with a thick scarf and a wool beanie, is a nice look for him, despite him being a bumbling crook.
-   **Hooded Angels**: Just about everybody in either the Angels gang and Wes's posse wears some sort of duster, covering the full range of styles: from the plain canvas ones worn by Hannah and Wes, through the shaggy buffalo fur one worn by Billy, to the very feminine and fashionable maroon one with silver conches sported by April.
-   In **In Time**, the Timekeepers, and most prominently the antagonist Raymond Leon, wear longcoats.

    -   In **Spectre**, M wears one in the climax, especially visible when he confronts then fights The Mole C.
    -   In **No Time to Die**, Bond wears a Massimo Alba Duster coat during the chase in Norway, where he demolishes the entire pursuing enemy force bar Big Bad Safin in his helicopter.
-   Matsu, the protagonist of the **Female Prisoner Scorpion** series, wears a variety of long, black fabric coats; unusually, she buttons them to the neck. The one featured in **Jailhouse 41** is belted, with a large, ornate gold buckle.
-   In **King Arthur (2004)**, the Saxon chieftain (a major badass in his own right) runs around in a longcoat so cool, he easily overshadows any other character.
-   **A Knight's Tale**: Geoffrey Chaucer is fond of wearing these. He starts out wearing a rather ratty version, which may have previously belonged to the late Sir Ector, and gets a much fancier one after the team get rich winning tournaments. Prince Edward also sports one with some very regal embroidery on the front when he shows up to free William from the stocks.
-   David Bowie wears two<small>◊</small> different<small>◊</small> ones in **Labyrinth**. One is very sparkly, the other is leather. Neither one does anything to interfere with seeing his AREA. Behind the scenes, it served the practical function of hiding the professional juggler who was hand doubling for the juggling scenes.
-   In **The Lord of the Rings** film adaptations, Aragorn wears a forest-green Ranger Coat for the better part of the film series, up until he forsakes his Ranger side and becomes the King of Gondor.
-   Aussie bushrangers **Mad Dog Morgan** and **The Outlaw Michael Howe** both wear duster coats. Mick Jagger wore a velvet tailcoat when portraying Ned Kelly.
-   **Marvel Cinematic Universe**:
    -   **Captain America: The First Avenger**: Say what you will about the Red Skull, but he makes that SS coat look good.
    -   **The Avengers (2012)**:
        -   Nick Fury wears a black leather duster in because he's yet another character played by Samuel L. Jackson!
        -   Loki, the main villain, wears an Asgardian variation on a long black coat — his coat is embellished with shiny metal and green and gold accents.

        -   In **Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2**, Gamora's main outfit includes a duster.
    -   In **Avengers: Age of Ultron**, Hawkeye sports a new outfit which has a relatively short coat.
    -   In **Captain America: Civil War**, Scarlet Witch sports a new outfit with a long red coat.
-   A good 75% of the characters in **The Matrix** trilogy wear them. Quite possibly they're the main reason for the current popularity of the Badass Longcoat. Most of them are black leather dusters because it's easier to render dark objects against dark backgrounds. In the sequel, the Twins wear white longcoats to set them apart. Neo's longcoat changes to something resembling a cassock in the sequels, probably intended to make him look more like a priest.
-   In the **Mimic**, the Badass giant insects look like people in longcoats.
-   It helps that **Moon Child** has many slow-motion gunfight scenes, thus allowing Sho's long, white coat to flare out behind him in all its badass glory.
-   The film's portrayal of **Mortal Kombat**'s Shang Tsung has him wearing a black longcoat for most of the movie.

-   Sergio Leone's **Once Upon a Time in the West**:
    
    **Cheyenne**: Nobody around these parts got the guts to wear those dusters except Cheyenne's men...and Cheyenne's men don't get killed.
    
-   Jack Sparrow of **Pirates of the Caribbean** wears an ensemble that sometimes includes a knee-length coat.
    -   All of the main villains in the series love them too. Yes, **all of them**. It seems to be a prerequisite of being a Big Bad in one of these films.
-   In **Priest (2011)**, the vampire Black Hat wears a brown duster.
-   In **The Prophecy** all angels (who are definitely badass) wear some kind of longcoat. It is interesting that the type of garment reflects the personality of the wearer: benevolent Simon is shown in gray woolen greatcoat, relentless Uziel wears black duster, silver-tongued Lucifer is portrayed in a slick coat while psychotic Gabriel prefers an unbuttoned cassock.
-   Frank Castle looks pretty badass in his longcoat at various points during **The Punisher (2004)**
-   In **Razors: The Return of Jack the Ripper**, the Ripper wears a tattered greatcoat that swirls around him as he menacingly advances on his victims.

-   The title character of the Samuel L. Jackson **Shaft (2000)** wears a black leather trench coat that's every bit as badass as he is.
-   Parodied in **Shaolin Soccer** when the poverty-stricken characters dramatically assemble on a rooftop. One wears a ratty bathrobe that catches some Dramatic Wind in slow motion like a badass longcoat would in such a scene.
-   Michelle Yeoh sports a white metallic finished trenchcoat as the titular motorcycling vigilante in **Silver Hawk**, a Hong Kong martial arts/superhero hybrid.
-   **Sin City**: A big part of the series' noir aesthetic is the popularity of trenchcoats. Marv's Running Gag is stealing the trenchcoats of people he kills. Whenever he remarks, "That's one fine coat you're wearing," it's a sign that he's about to kill the person. Dwight and Hardigan also rock the longcoat.
-   Most of the pilots in **Sky Bandits** wear calf-length leather flying coats. The commander of the German airship is wearing a black leather trenchcoat.
-   **Sleepy Hollow High**: The Headless Horseman wears a long leather riding coat. Unfortunately, his badass-itude is somewhat undercut by the rest of his costume.
-   For another villainous example, **Spider-Man 2**'s Doctor Octopus wears a long coat and pairs it with Cool Shades.
-   The Octopus in **The Spirit**. In the denouement, he's wearing a badass long **fur** coat. Why? Cause he's Samuel L. Jackson!
-   **Stake Land**: Mister sports one of these. In the finale Martin sports a black one, symbolising him having become a hunter in his own right.
-   In the film version of **Starship Troopers**, with Col. Carl Jenkins wearing an important SS-looking longcoat, when his key role came of finding out the brain bug was scared.

-   In **The Third Man**, Holly Martins, Major Calloway, and Harry Lime wear trenchcoats, longcoats, and plain-old coats.
-   In **Titanic (1997)** Rose wears a floor-length pink jacket once the ship starts sinking that looks pretty badass on her. She even takes it off just as she is about to wade into the water with the axe to free Jack in typical action-heroine fashion. Later, Cal's jacket, which looks merely okay on him, looks badass on her once she starts wearing it, perhaps because it is a few sizes too big for her and thus looks longer and thicker on her. The ship's officers and Thomas Andrews also look pretty badass in their full-length overcoats.
-   In **Tombstone**, once he begins his vendetta ride, Wyatt Earp takes to wearing a tan duster. It's most noticeable when he blows away "Curly" Bill Brocius and a half dozen other Cowboys.
-   In what must be the best use of Kibbles and Bits ever, Crosshairs appears to be wearing a duster coat in **Transformers: Age of Extinction**.
-   In **TRON: Legacy**, Clu and Kevin Flynn both have one. Clu's even has Tron Lines, while Kevin simply has the interior parts glow.
-   In **Uncle Buck**, the titular character has a long tweed overcoat, which he wears for some of his moments of badassery (like meeting Maizy's assistant principal and searching for Tia at the house party).
-   Selene in the **Underworld (2003)** films is an archetypal Action Girl who wears a black leather longcoat with a Spy Catsuit. In **Underworld: Awakening** she makes a point to break into a store **so she can get a new longcoat.** This one isn't made of leather, so she ditches it when she comes across a leather one.
-   In **Utu**, the Villain Protagonist Rebel Leader Te Wheke wears a captured military greatcoat, and the Bounty Hunter Williamson wears a duster.
-   The titular protagonist in **VI Warshawski** wears a good-looking one as part of her ensemble. During the climax, the villainess also wears a badass long coat with a great scarf as well(which she uses to wipe away her fingerprints).
-   The weasels from the 1996 live-action movie version of **The Wind in the Willows** wear Badass Longcoats in a dark yellow color. They wear them to complete their elegantly evil outfits; the coats are a huge feature of the costume.
-   Invoked in **The World's End** by Gary, who wears a black longcoat to try and appear cool. Its shabby condition, however, make him look like the worn-down Manchild he is. In his final appearance after the apocalypse, it actually does look pretty cool.
-   **X-Men Film Series**:
    -   Nightcrawler wears one in **X2: X-Men United**.
    -   **X-Men Origins: Wolverine**:

Badass Longcoat Example in Literature

-   **American Gods** with the "new god" of the Internet. He wears a black longcoat in a Shout-Out to **The Matrix** but is an unpleasant, physically weak nerd.
-   Subverted in **The Bartimaeus Trilogy**: Nathaniel tries to evoke this trope, with mixed results.
-   The elder Whistler sisters in **A Brother's Price** ride home wearing greatcoats.
-   Mr. Dorian, a magician and ringmaster on his book of origin's titular train, **The Boundless**, absorbed gunshots and pulled various items from his signature coat.
    
    **Mr. Dorian:** A good coat serves many purposes.
    
-   Carmen Sandiego has that awesome red one!
    
    -   The 2019 reboot justifies why she still wears it even in settings where it'd realistically be too hot to wear a trenchcoat: **it has lots of pockets**.
    
    **Carmen:** A lady needs her tools.
    
-   Commissar Ciaphas Cain (**HERO OF THE IMPERIUM!**) in Sandy Mitchell's novels of the **Warhammer 40,000** setting, who kicks ass and takes names while wearing a huge, red-sashed and gold-trimmed greatcoat, complete with natty cap.
-   While not a long coat exactly, Gerald Tarrant of the **Coldfire Trilogy** wears calf-length, medieval-style tunics, and he's fairly badass.
-   Colt Regan typically wears a black duster when on the job, mostly because it looks cool.
-   Pablo Astoria, from **Conciencia y Voluntad**, is dressed in a trenchcoat permanently, although with at least two good reasons: the ever raining city in which he lives, and because it's fucking cool for a private eye. He certainly knows how to handle a gun.
-   **Crystal Rain** and its sequels by Tobias Buckell features the immortal cyborg killing machine Pepper, whose preferred garment is a trenchcoat.
-   Roland Deschain from **The Dark Tower** series (pictured above), though he seems to lose it at some point, as later books don't address anything of the sort.
-   Neal Stephenson's **The Diamond Age**: Carl Hollywood is an American cowboy living abroad in future Shanghai. He's very tall and wears a duster as part of his typical ensemble. When the city gets overrun with zealots, he and several other immigrants fight their way to safety.
-   In the **Discworld**, which runs on tropes, several characters have one. One of the most notable is Mr. Gryle, a Banshee, and he seems to wear it a little bit too easily; it helps to realize it's actually his wings. Another is the Ghost the one who's Walter Plinge in **Maskerade**.
-   Sabbath, from the **Doctor Who Eighth Doctor Adventures**, wears a loose, grey, military-style overcoat, like Napoleon wears (which is rather amusing considering the fact he's described as not particularly tall at first, although he suddenly becomes very tall in later novels). It's ironic because he thinks the military is absurd. (Since he was choosing his clothes to convey anti-authoritarian irony back in the 18th century, that might just make him the first hipster.) Not everyone is impressed; Anji considers it "stupid" and "embarrassing" and guesses that, like his name, he "thinks it's cool". He occasionally pulls various weapons out of it.
-   Miron in **Dora Wilk Series** wears his long coat for every occasion, no matter how unpractical it might be.
-   Zayne Balthine of the **Dreamscape Voyager Trilogy** sports one that features numerous hidden pockets and holsters. Black coats are the unofficial uniform of the mercenary band to which he belongs, but there is no regulation cut to them.
-   Orson Gregory from **The Dreamside Road** wears one — an oddly practical example, as it is lined with armor, resistant to both bullets and bladed weapons. Form and function!
-   **The Dresden Files**: Harry Dresden famously sports a duster, despite frequent mocking from other characters. He's enchanted it to be bullet and knife resistant so he always has it whenever possible, regardless of how unfashionable it is. It's not, however, **impact**\-proof, as he notes on one occasion after being shoulder-checked by an enormous muscle-y brute. He's gotten it to the point that the impact is spread out across his body, which any physics student can tell you reduces the pressure of the impact substantially, but whenever possible he prefers to throw up a magical shield to defend himself instead, as those are both much more powerful and reliable. Plus something like a high caliber bullet may not be stopped by the coat, and any part of him not covered by the coat is still vulnerable, so it's best not to risk it.
    -   After his duster gets destroyed later on in the series, one of the other characters makes a special point of buying him a new Inverness coat. Everyone who knows Harry approves of the purchase.
-   In Therin Knite's **Echoes**, Dynara and Murrough wear long white coats to signal their positions as head of EDPA departments. Dynara is the Commissioner of the Field Agents' Corps, and Murrough is the Captain of EDPA Security.
-   **Elsabeth Soesten**: The title character sports a long brown leather coat over her shirt, doublet and hose.
-   **Felix Castor** makes frequent use of a Cossack-style greatcoat, citing the carrying capacity that's necessary for the tools of his trade as a freelance exorcist.
-   The same coat keeps turning up in Steven Brust's novels, usually on coachmen. The best description is in **Freedom and Necessity**: "Last week I found my most treasured item of clothing...a vast and possibly antique driving coat, rusty black, with deep turned-back cuffs and a high-standing collar, and a pair of pockets so large that I could drop one of Mr. Colt's pistols in each and hardly grudge the room. It swallows me up nearly to the ankles... As his boots were to Puss, so this coat is to me. I assure myself that I seem a latter-day Dick Turpin when I've got it on, though I may in fact look a quite modern scare-crow."
-   In **Hope and Red**, Red thinks his longcoat is one of these: "deer leather, finely tanned, and soft as velvet." His friend Nettles refers to it as his "mole rat coat," though, so maybe not.
-   **InCryptid**: Dominic De Luca wears a leather duster, a classic outfit for a Hunter of Monsters.
-   A **civilization** of them in Sherwood Smith's **Inda** series. All Marlovan warriors wear long, gray dusters designed for riding.
-   **Knaves on Waves** has Captain Trigger, who is never seen without his faded naval coat.
-   In the **Lockwood & Co.** books, the eponymous Lockwood often wears long coats that billow in the wind and generally make him look cool.
-   Badass Bow Street Runner Matthew Hawkwood is usually described as wearing a long riding coat, even when he is not on horseback.
-   Both Joseph Carrion and his apprentice, Dhampinella, wear black longcoats in the **Mediochre Q Seth Series**.
-   **The Memory Wars**: Nathan Shepherd wears a long, hooded coat made from his deceased father's old duffel coat. The lining is lightly armored, so it offers protection as well as concealing any weapons he's carrying.
-   The coat quixotic Ariane wears in Greer Gilman's novel **Moonwise** is described thus:
    
    "She wore her ruffianly greatcoat, caped and cuffed and quite staggeringly heavy, of moleish dusky wool, with rather fewer silver buttons than designed. It hung to her heels. With the wooden spoon she brandished, striding and swirling, it gave rather a Dulle Griet air of absurd panache, of rag-and-bone fantastical swagger: **so boldly did I fight, me boys, although I'm but a wench.**"
    
-   The Marquis de Carabas, from **Neverwhere**, wears what is somewhere between a trench coat and a frock coat.
-   John Taylor from Simon R. Green's **Nightside** series wears a long **white** coat. It even has a self-destruct in it, which sends it up in flames if it gets too far from his body. Green gave a reasonably plausible justification (let a significant personal possession get loose, and you're likely to have all sorts of magic nastiness come down on you), but the reader suspects he had tongue firmly in cheek while writing that one...
    -   John's probably kidding when he tells servants he'd prefer they not take his coat because he hasn't fed it recently. **Probably**.
    -   Razor Eddie, also from Green's novels, wears an incredibly dirty gray longcoat and routinely cuts Cosmic-caliber monsters into sashimi.
        -   The Nightside has a few characters who wear these. There's probably something in the air. Two of the more prominent examples are Dead Boy, who is dead, and wears a purple greatcoat; and Hadleigh Oblivion, the Detective Inspectre, who deals with crime that threatens reality itself, and has a black leather longcoat.
-   **Percy Jackson and the Olympians**: In **The Titan's Curse**, Percy briefly wears a golden-brown duster made from the Nemean Lion's invulnerable pelt. He ends up sacrificing it to Poseidon so Bessie the Ophiotaurus and Grover back to camp, sadly. But it still counts.
-   Wiliam, the Lone Sowordsman, sports a long leather longcoat over his armor in **A Practical Guide to Evil**. The main character even lampshades it <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> when she meets him for the first time. It so blatantly marks him as a Hero, she thinks that The Empire should have arrested him at the city gates.
-   In **Queens of Geek**, Taylor's Queen Firestone cosplay includes a black trenchcoat with a crown sigil sewn on the back.
-   In some medieval cultures, long surcoats were worn over armor, and show up in medieval romances, epics, and other martial literatures of those cultures. So, for example, in **Romance of the Three Kingdoms**, the generals all wear "battle robes" as an outer layer, and at one point Lu Bu's is even described as fluttering in the wind. The samurai of **The Tale of the Heike** wear something similar.
-   **Shadowboy**, Doctor Omicron's heavy black labcoat pulls double duty as one. Being worn over a life support suit, it confers no functional benefit, but he keeps it for style.
-   **Sherlock Holmes**' title character was known to pull this off, so much so that a billowing Inverness cape is frequently associated with images of him.
-   **Spectral Shadows** has a few characters who don these, such as Spike Malone, Richie Blackthorn, and — only for the duration of the **Somebody Else's Dream** plot — Jasper Phillips. Apparently, they're tailored so that the animal tails don't get in the way.
-   The title character of **Trueman Bradley** has inherited the trenchcoat and fedora his grandfather used to wear while doing detective work. Later, he gets a yellow trenchcoat and hat so he can look like Dick Tracy.
-   Barnaby Gold, The Gunslinger hero of **The Undertaker** series of novels, still dresses as he did when he was an undertaker; including a black-caped greatcoat.
-   Dimitri Belikov from **Vampire Academy**, is often seen wearing a long, black coat as part of his attire. Lampshaded in **Last Sacrifice**, when Rose gives Dimitri a hard time about leaving his duster behind after the guardians invade the Mastrano house, trying to capture Rose and Dimitri.
-   **Wax and Wayne** has the "mistcoat," a longcoat whose lower half is cut into tassels that flare dramatically when the wearer moves. These are a successor to the "mistcloaks" worn by Mistborn in **Mistborn: The Original Trilogy**, which follow the same design principles. The main protagonist reclaiming his during the climax cements his role as a one-man-Cavalry.
-   **The Wheel of Time**: The Asha'man wear long black coats as a Non-Uniform Uniform, with collar pins denoting rank, and are an organization of One-Man Army Magic Knights.
-   **The Witches**: The hotel manager Mr Stringer is described as a bristly man in a black tail-coat.
-   **Words of Radiance** (second book of **The Stormlight Archive**): Kaladin gets a cloak with the Kholin glyphpair on it when Kaladin is promoted to captain of Dalinar's guard. He spends most of the book not wearing it, due to believing he's not worthy of it for all his many mistakes.
-   **Golden in Death** by J.D. Robb, features Lt. Eve Dallas, Homicide, wearing this for a no-knock warrant on a homicide suspect's home. It's at her husband's suggestion, "to complete the look".

Badass Longcoat Example in Live-Action TV

-   **24**: Jack wears one for most of the second half of the first season during his investigation of the Drazen family. He also sports a khaki one during the first few hours of the seventh season.
-   **Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.** Season 3 gives us the Big Bad, Hive rocking a black duster after restoring Grant Ward's body, which given the fact it vaguely looks like a priest, adds to his Creepy Awesome cult leader character. The first scene with him wearing it even slows down so we can see it in a slow-mo Female Gaze.
-   Parodied in an **All That** sketch. The leader of a Legion of Doom has a Badass Longcoat, and **won't stop talking about it**. Furthermore, his only superpower seems to be able to make his longcoat even longer (complete with Dramatic Wind). His cohorts end up leaving when they realize that he won't shut up about it.
-   **American Idol**: Adam Lambert in the Season 8 performance finale wore a long, black trench coat<small>◊</small> with fog machines while singing "Mad World". It didn't necessarily make him badass, though.
-   **Andor**: When Cassian returns to Ferrix after character growth from a petty con man trying to find a place to live and keep his head down without attracting Imperial attention to someone invested in fighting for people's liberty and coming home to rescue an old friend from the local Imperial garrison he dons a visually striking brown longcoat.
-   **Angel**: Angel's black leather longcoat is badass enough to stay that way even when it's being worn by a muppet-Angel in the episode "Smile Time". And in "Guise Will Be Guise", Wesley is forced to impersonate Angel. By the end of the episode, Wes has become so badass that he's giving orders to everyone while Angel stays in the background griping that he'd like his coat back.
-   **Babylon 5** and **Crusade**: All of the Ranger characters wore long dusters, usually black or at least dark in color. Chiefly seen worn by the character Marcus Cole.
-   **Billy the Exterminator**: Used by Billy as part of an improvised bee suit he used in Season 1. Along with a snowboarding mask and a feather boa. The entire getup worked quite well with the exception of the boa, as the bees were able to crawl through it and sting him several times in the neck.
-   **The Bletchley Circle**: The four ladies in this BBC series all frequently wear long coats and they all look sexy and badass in them.
-   **The Book of Boba Fett**: Skad's a Badass Biker who has a long jacket on as part of his outfit.
-   **Buffy the Vampire Slayer**:
    -   Angel started wearing one after losing his soul and turning back into Angelus.
    -   Spike. The coat was an explicit symbol of his badass-ness, taken from Slayer Nikki Wood when he killed her. In fact, one of the marks of Spike's Badass Decay was that he put the coat away towards the end of the sixth season. In a mid-Season 7 episode of **Buffy** he realizes that he's turned into a wimp, so he pulls the old coat out and promptly starts kicking ass. He's never without it again, his Badass Decay briefly halted by the act. It is destroyed by an explosion in "The Girl in Question", only to be quickly replaced by the staff of W&H Rome.
    -   Towards the end of the show, Buffy herself adds a long coat to her Unlimited Wardrobe.
    -   Spoofed in Season 7 with Andrew, who wears a longcoat similar to Spike's, but, decidedly, is **not a badass.** He's still a bit of a wimp and later gets bitchslapped by Willow (and not even the Evil One) in an alley. She does this with a **lecture**, without ever actually laying a hand on him, scares him shitless, and takes him prisoner. While he's wearing the longcoat.
    -   There was also the Monster of the Week "Der Kindestod" (The Child's Death), a vaguely humanoid creature with a hideous face and some aspects of an old man (wrinkly skin, white hair). He wears a longcoat.
-   **Carmen Sandiego** has that awesome red one!
-   **Criminal Minds**: Milked for all it's worth in the fantasy/noir sequences of the episode "True Night".
-   **Dark Shadows**: Barnabas Collins was an Inverness-cape-wearing vampire.
-   **Doctor Who**:
    -   The title character knows the value of a Badass Longcoat:
        -   The Third Doctor regularly wore a badass Inverness coat, and some badass opera cloaks, too.
        -   The Fourth Doctor ditched his red jacket in favour of a rather lovely purple velvet frock coat in his costume update in "Pyramids of Mars", and continued wearing frock coats almost exclusively from then on as Tom Baker preferred the silhouette (his favourite was the chestnut-coloured velvet one, because it was very full-skirted and swung dramatically as he moved). In his final season, he switched to a heavier greatcoat, designed to billow in a swashbuckler-style manner. He also got an Inverness cape in one story, though one much more colourful and in line with his usual style than the Third Doctor's one.
        -   The Eighth Doctor wears a knee-length frock coat.
        -   The alternate Ninth Doctor from the official Web Original serial **Scream of the Shalka** wears an impressive greatcoat.
        -   And of course, the Tenth Doctor sports a camel-colored long coat as part of his silhouette, given to him by Janis Joplin. The pockets are Bigger on the Inside. (In the **Eighth Doctor Adventures** books, the Doctor cops to having used no such elegant solution — he just rips out the lining of his pockets, turning the whole lining of his coat into one big pocket.)
        -   The Eleventh Doctor occasionally wore a green greatcoat starting from Series 6, alternating with his tweed jacket. And in Series 7, he started wearing a purple frock coat.
        -   The Twelfth Doctor has a whole collection of these, but his most iconic one is a black tailored longcoat with red inner lining.
        -   The Thirteenth Doctor wears a pale blue hooded longcoat with deep blue inner lining. It's also got a rainbow strip where the two colours meet, and a blue strip at the bottom.
    -   Captain Jack Harkness bursts onto the scene in Series 3 with his greatcoat swirling around his ankles. When he comes back a season later, he's still got it.
    -   "Vincent and the Doctor" gives Vincent van Gogh of all people one: the long coat he wears when he goes to paint the church where a monster is lurking, and which he later faces the monster in.
-   **Dracula (2013)**: Lady Jayne often has a long leather coat on, usually while fighting, which whirls around her while she's beating opponents gracefully.
-   **The Equalizer**: Robert McCall is rarely seen in an episode without at least once wearing either his black or grey trench coat. Almost never closed unless he was out in bad weather.
-   **Farscape**:
    -   John Crichton's increasing badass-ness on **Farscape** is symbolized by his abandonment of his IASA civvies and taking up of a Peacekeeper long black coat.
    -   Scorpius, in his badass **tailcoat**.
    -   Aeryn gets a moment so badass with her longcoat it ends up in the opening credits for a long time.
-   **Firefly**: In this universe, a long brown coat was part of the standard uniform for Independent soldiers during The War, earning them the nickname "Browncoats". Mal Reynolds and Zoe Washburne are both seen in their old army browncoats. The hardcore fan element gets their nickname from here. The browncoat appears on Nathan Fillion again as his Hallowe'en costume in the second series of **Castle**.
-   **Fringe**: Olivia regularly wears a long, black coat; Peter, Broyles, and Nina Sharp also occasionally wear them.
-   **Game of Thrones**:
    -   Jaime Lannister mostly wears these, when he's not wearing his shiny Kingsguard armor.
    -   The tabard Jon wears is evocative of this trope. Played more straight after he's elected as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
    -   Nasty and abusive as the guards of the Dreadfort such as the Master Torturer may be, they do have some rather nice long coats and hoods on them, a very fitting and imposing winter attire.
    -   Tywin has a black leather one in Season 3 and there is a reason he's considered as the Big Bad by the Starks instead of Joffrey or Cersei.
    -   Daenerys dons a grey mink fur-lined asymmetrical robe during the Field of Fire 2.0, then a silver-white number for a flight beyond the Wall.
    -   The clothing worn by Balon Greyjoy, Yara Greyjoy, and some of the men of House Greyjoy are heavily reminiscent of this, making them look less like Vikings and more like pirates. The costume department put a lot of thought into this (Michele Clapton said the Ironborn were probably her favorite region she designed for), rationalizing that the Ironborn spend most of their time on cold wind-swept ship decks at sea, so they need to wear heavy long coats water-sealed with wax and fish oil to protect against the bone-freezing winds (they are **not** operating in warm Caribbean waters).
        -   Balon wears one and it makes him look like the pirate he is.
        -   Euron sports one during the Kingsmoot and is a charismatic badass.
        -   Yara wears the ubiquitous longcoat and breastplate of the Ironborn. Suffice it to say, she pulls it off with aplomb.
-   **GARO**: The Badass Longcoat is part of a Makai Knight's standard uniform in this Toku series. The title character wears a very cool white longcoat when he's not in armored mode. Rekka wears one to show that she considers herself the equal of a Makai Knight, even though she's not allowed to become one because she is a woman.
    -   Ryuga, Garo from the sequel GARO The One Who Shines In Darkness wears an equally cool black longcoat. His fellow makai knights Takeru and Aguri also wear longcoats, that are less ornate, but no less badass.
-   **Highlander**: This franchise has a lot of these, starting with Connor MacLeod in the first movie. Not only do the dusters look cool, but they also provide a convenient Hand Wave for how Immortals pull their swords out of nowhere.
-   **Interceptor**: The titular Interceptor from this short-lived game show wore a long black coat. This made him easily identifiable for the contestants, though in some cases he took it off to disguise himself.
-   **It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia**: Parodies the longcoat on several occasions.
    -   Frank wears a trenchcoat to a secret parking garage meeting with Charlie, who interrupts to remark on how cool the trenchcoat looks.
    -   Mac buys a black leather duster because he thinks it makes him tough. At one point he thinks it will help him kick down a door. When Charlie wants a try at the door, he demands that he get to wear the duster. Mac ends up hitting Charlie against the wall while Charlie wears the duster.
    -   Mac's will demands that his duster be burnt after his death, but Dennis insists on keeping it for himself. When asked why he wears the duster over a bare chest, Dennis testily explains that the look is irresistible to women.
-   **Kamen Rider**:
    -   **Kamen Rider Ryuki**: Ren was never without his black leather coat, whose billowing was even seen as part of his transformation. Actually mocked in an interview where all the riders did their transformation poses, and Shinji's actor waved the bottom of his shirt around for the same effect.
    -   **Kamen Rider Wizard**: The titular hero wears one in the winter and actually has one built into his suit when transformed. Later Riders who use Wizard-themed "Legend Rider" powers also gain the longcoat.
    -   **Kamen Rider Ex-Aid**: As mentioned above, Genm's Wizard costume has a longcoat. The costume was later recycled into suits for Chronus (the series' Big Bad) and Ex-Aid's movie-exclusive VRX Gamer form.
    -   **Kamen Rider Build**: Sento is quite attached to his plain beige Colombo-esque coat that's implied to have a hidden Hammerspace housing his Build Driver and FullBottles. He tends to waved it when making a dramatic introduction for himself or his new discovery. So much so, Ryuga emulates him a couple of times by flapping his jacket, basically doing what's described in Ryuki's entry above, but with serious intention.
-   **Legends of Tomorrow**: Sara Lance wears one per her new White Canary costume.
-   **Life on Mars (2006)** and **Ashes to Ashes (2008)**:
    -   Gene Hunt wears a long camelhair longcoat in the Seventies; in the Eighties, he's traded it for a long black trench coat, just as badass and reflecting his Anti-Hero status.
    -   Keats's grey trenchcoat would seem, at first, an aversion — he's not that badass in the beginning. But when his true nature is revealed? Yes.
-   While Miles Hawkins only wore the exosuit in the series proper, the original **M.A.N.T.I.S.** tv movie has him wear a nice suit and a trench coat over it.
-   **MacGyver (2016)**: Riley Davis starting in season 5 pretty much lives in her leather trench coat.
-   **Miracles**: Alva Keel often wears a dark longcoat and while he doesn't stuff his full of firearms, he's usually the member of his Power Trio that ends up killing people/demons/etc.
-   **The Meeting Place Cannot Be Changed**: Gleb Zheglov often wears black leather trenchcoat<small>◊</small> and fedora befitting his role of a Cowboy Cop in the post-war crime-riddled Moscow. His buddy Vladimir Sharapov mostly still wears his army uniform, so is also often seen in the Red Army issue greatcoat.
-   **Merlin**: King Uther Pendragon of the BBC TV series often sports a black leather badass longcoat, unusual for a king in the Dark Ages. And occasionally his son, Arthur, rocks a rather nice ankle-length brown coat.
-   In the BBC's **The Musketeers**, the entire Musketeer regiment gets decked out in leather and Aramis gets a long form-fitting leather frock coat ("flowing" and "sensual", according to the costume designer).
-   **NCIS**: Ziva David wears them on occasion, ranging from a short black trenchcoat to a grey long coat (similar to the style worn by Neo in Matrix II & III) with red lining. She also has them in neon colors like green and orange.
-   **No Ordinary Family**: Villain of the Week Theo wears a billowy overcoat and has very effective control over this Playing with Fire powers.
-   **Once Upon a Time**: Several characters wear frock coats in one form or another, including, but not limited to, Rumpelstiltskin, Killian, Jefferson, Victor, and even Regina (though hers are more like overcoats).
-   **Power Rangers S.P.D.** and **Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger**: Anubis "Doggie" Cruger/Shadow Ranger and his tokusatsu counterpart Doggy Kruger/DekaMaster both sport longcoats when not transformed. Doggie ends up tossing his off when he morphs!
    -   Also from Super Sentai, Mikoto Nakadai and Captain Marvelous
    -   Gunpei Ishihara tried wearing one, but it didn't work — it led to him being mistaken for a drug dealer.
    -   The Super Mode from Samurai Sentai Shinkenger added a badass, long, white coat to the suits, while Hyper Mode added a gold-trimmed red one. Takeru gets a black variant as Gedou Shinken Red in the crossover Vs. movie with **Tensou Sentai Goseiger**.
    -   And then comes Xiao Longbao/Shou Ronpo who not only wears one but keeps it when transforming into Ryu Commander.
-   **Revolution**: Captain Jeremy Baker, Major Tom Neville, and Miles Matheson go around wearing longcoats.
-   **Sanctuary**: John Druitt is rarely seen without his black leather longcoat.
-   **The School Nurse Files**: Ahn Eun-young wears a lab coat as her school nurse's unifrom. It flutters behind her as she fights.
-   **Scrapheap Challenge**: Robert Llewellyn wears a greyish one...and looks strangely fit in it.
-   **Sherlock**: Sherlock Holmes. The dark blue tweed Belstaff, classically cut, has the sort of swirling tails one needs.
    -   Unsurprisingly, the coat has become extremely sought-after, to the point where Belstaff reissued it for a limited time after the first series premiered, and it is now being credited with bringing classic tweed coats back into fashion.
-   **Shoestring:** Eddie's boss, Don Satchley, tries to invoke this trope by having him pose in a trench coat and fedora for publicity photos.
    
    **Eddie**: No hat. It doesn't even fit!  
    **Don**: Yes, the hat. It's the Sam Spade image!
    
-   **Skins**: Franky Fitzgerald, from this British TV show, wore a black longcoat during the first episode, which helped her gain the nickname "Franky Badass".
-   **Smallville**:
    -   In season nine, Clark Kent takes to wearing one of these with an all-black ensemble. Badass, but not his color or style. How about something figure-hugging in red and blue?
    -   Lex rocked the badass longcoat.
-   **Stargate Atlantis**: Wraith officers tend to wear long, black leather coats as opposed to the pants and muscle shirts of the warriors.
    -   Also, the series' most memorable human villain, Acastus Kolya, who wears a long black coat when not in uniform.
    -   **Trinity**: Ronon and Teyla in black coats. The show's two most badass characters in long, black coats — simply badass. And while everyone wears BDUs off-world, Ronon tends to wear a coat instead.
    -   The Mooks are specifically called "Longcoats" for their...long coats.
-   **Stargate SG-1**:

    -   In the Season Six episode "Nightwalkers", Carter, Teal'c and Jonas Quinn show up in a small Oregon town, all three wearing long, dark leather coats. Way to go, guys, could we look any MORE threatening and sinister?
-   **Strange Empire**: Kat Loving wears one constantly.
-   **Supernatural**: Castiel, the warrior of God, is modeled after John Constantine wardrobe-wise (overcoat and all). Being an angel, Castiel's clothes have the added bonus of self-repairing damage from gunshot blasts and stabbings and magical dry cleaning for bloodstains.
    -   Crowley wears a knee-length overcoat with his suit to add to the shades of Wicked Cultured he invokes as a high-ranking demon.
-   **The Thick of It**: Malcolm Tucker wears a flowing black coat, most notably when vowing to his Number 10 colleagues "YOU WILL SEE ME AGAIN" and then walking out of Number 10 as it billows after him.
-   **Tin Man**: The soldiers of the Wicked Witch are called "Long-coats" and wear black leather dusters. Unfortunately, they attended Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy so they are only bad-ass versus unarmed peasants. Cain (the eponymous Tin Man) and Glitch are straighter examples. Ish.
-   **Torchwood**: Captain Jack Harkness wears a Royal Air Force greatcoat<small>◊</small> as part of his iconic 1940s-style ensemble. Rhys Williams refers to him as "That bloke with the coat" several times. Naturally, after being blown up one of his major priorities is replacing it. During one Comic-Con, actor John Barrowman joked with the cast of **Spartacus** that because his character always wears a longcoat, he doesn't have to watch his diet like they do.
    -   At one point, he tells an appreciative waiter that the three of them should go out for a drink sometime.
        
        **Waiter:** The three of us?  
        **Jack:** Yeah. You, me, and the coat.
        
-   **Walker, Texas Ranger**: The opening credits feature Chuck Norris in a tan canvas duster, even though he's much more likely to be wearing a cattleman's short coat, a sheepskin jacket, or a leather vest during the episode.
-   **The Walking Dead (2010)**: The Governor, Jesus, and Ezekiel are the most well-known examples. Carol also briefly gets one in Season 4, and Eugene wears one for a large part of Season 8 (although in his case, it's not so much "badass" as it is "wannabe").
-   **The Wire**: Omar Little uses a duster to conceal his kevlar vest and double-barreled shotgun while robbing drug dealers.
-   **What We Do in the Shadows (2019)**: When Guillermo discovers his talent for vampire slaying, he starts wearing a trench coat alongside his usual sweatered ensembles.
-   **The X-Files**: Badass Longcoat is nearly omnipresent for the series as both bad guys and good guys wear them frequently. Trenchcoats are justified in-universe as the investigations are often conducted in foggy, damp climates. Needless to say, it also looks awesome.
    -   Agent Mulder wears a trench coat in several episodes and he's a highly capable FBI agent. The Omniscient Council of Vagueness considers him an extraordinary threat to their plans.
    -   Scully wears a long coat quite often too. It helped hide Gillian Anderson's pregnancy. She also wears a lab coat when she performs an autopsy, and she looks very badass while doing so. Autopsy rooms and science stuff have always been her comfort zone.
    -   Mulder's Mysterious Informant Deep Throat wore a long coat in most of his appearances. It added to his mystique of a shady figure.
    -   Mulder's next Mysterious Informants, known only as Mr. X, invariably wore long dark coats. He was a very intimidating figure and somewhat of a Scary Black Man.
    -   Members of the Conspiracy always wear scary long coats if they ever appear outside.
-   **Young Dracula**: He's not really that badass, but Eric Van Helsing wears one when he goes slaying.

Badass Longcoat Example in Music

-   In the **Cake** song "Short Skirt/Long Jacket", the narrator's dream girl wears one of these:
    
    I want a girl with the right allocations  
    Who's fast, thorough, and sharp as a tack  
    She's playing with her jewelry, she's putting up her hair  
    She's touring the facilities and picking up slack  
    I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket

-   Nikki Storm has ring gear to simulate the effect as if you'd want to give the opponent more areas to grab but still winning matches with the handicap is "bad ass".

-   Umbra from **Shadowhunter Peril** wears a long, badass, black duster. Simple yet elegant, but it got destroyed in a fight with Lilith. However, he easily replaced it.

---
Badass Longcoat Example in Tabletop Games

-   Going by the artwork in the books, trenchcoats are Standard Issue among **Dark Champions** vigilantes.
-   **Deadlands**, being inspired by Westerns and requiring a good deal of Badassitude from at least some character classes, are a kind of natural habitat for Badass Longcoats too. Members of the Agency — the setting's The Men in Black organisation — are known by the nickname of Men In Black Dusters. The Agency's counterparts south of the border, the Texas Rangers, issue dusters to their recruits, presumably invoking this trope.
-   In **Dogs in the Vineyard**, a Badass Longcoat is standard issue to every player character. Depending on how the GM decides to run the game, they can even deflect bullets.

-   **Eberron** features a suit of armor that is essentially an armored duster.
-   Games Workshop games:
    -   In **Warhammer**, the Witch Hunters of the Empire's Order of the Templars of Sigmar wear greatcoats as part of their standard uniform (along with a capotain) as a Shout-Out to the traditional outfit associated with real life and fictional witch hunters.
    -   **Warhammer 40,000**:
        -   Imperial Commissars, who have absolutely no qualms with summarily executing their men for cowardice, disobedience, incompetence, fighting amongst themselves, drinking on duty, looking at heretical materials, wearing the wrong cap-badge, sneezing on the Emperor's holy icons.... \*cough\* Ciaphas Cain \*cough-cough\* I mean most Commissars are also Badass enough to scare their underlings more than whatever horrors are faced. As mentioned in the Literature section above, though, some Commissars are more Badass than others.
        -   On a larger scale, several units of the Imperial Guard wear longcoats. The Death Korps of Krieg wear World War I French-style greatcoats combined with German helmets and gasmasks that make them pull off a truly badass Gasmask Longcoat look. The Valhallan Ice Warriors, who are based on the Red Army of World War II, wear greatcoats as well.
        -   The Mad Doctor Fabius Bile wears a long lab coat made from stitched-together human skins. If anything is the last word in badass evil mad scientist gear, it's that.
        -   As witch hunters of the 41st Millennium, the models and artwork for Inquisitors of the Ordo Hereticus are often depicted them wearing greatcoats in the style of real life witch hunters over their Powered Armour to strengthen their visual theme.
    -   In **Necromunda**, the traditional outfit of House Delaque is a long, flowing trench coat worn to make it easier to conceal items and weaponry in a \[myriad of pockets and hidden compartments. During the 1st and 2nd Editions of the game, the long coats worn by House Delaque resembled those traditionally worn by spies and privet detectives in fiction. The 3rd Edition models redesigned the House’s stormcoats to give them a more sinister, form fitting appearance with high collars that resemble a snake’s hood.
-   Particularly popular among PanOceania in **Infinity**, usually worn over Powered Armor.
-   Every faction from Warmachine and Hordes has **someone** wearing an incredibly badass longcoat.
-   The Imperial Trenchers in **Mutant Chronicles** universe are both specialized in trench warfare and wearing badass trenchcoats styled after the early 20th-century British military (which they're a Fantasy Counterpart). Retired Badass Jake Kramer and The Stoic Cybertronic Overseer Cyril Dent also wear those.
-   Imrijka, the iconic inquisitor from **Pathfinder**, could almost be a Distaff Counterpart to the DMG II half-orc. Her hat and duster, however, are bright crimson and considerably more ornate.
    -   Not counting the "Gunman's Duster", a Wondrous Item also designed to give the wearer one of the Gunslinger's deeds, the Gunslinger's Dodge, which mechanically improves your defence against ranged attacks by moving you 5 feet, fluff wise, it helps you pull off backflips to dodge bullets, of course doing this still provokes attacks of opportunity, but should you want to try and backflip past people who are waving swords in your face, not even a Badass Longcoat can save you.
-   Quite a few of these are on the prowl in the **Ravenloft** setting, including were-hunter George Weathermay and some depictions of the darklord Malken. Even more common in the **Ravenloft** spinoff **Gothic Earth**, seeing as it's set in a spooky parallel Victorian-era Earth, so lots of people dress that way.
    -   The Arthaus products made greatcoats standard outdoor garb for residents of Darkon, which gets chilly.
-   In **Shadowrun**, armored longcoats are readily available and popular with players because they provide a high level of protection (only suits of actual armor offer substantially better protection, and they're rather conspicious and also much harder to get on the black market), give a bonus for concealing weapons beneath them, and look cool. Given that the setting is a cyberpunk Seattle, they would also help keep off the obligatory rain.
-   Also very popular among players in **The World of Darkness** games, to the point that someone appearing in one, particularly if he uses a katana sword, is such an utter, utter cliché that almost nobody does it anymore.

Badass Longcoat Example in Theatre

-   Ralph Fiennes brought new levels of whup-ass to a 1995 Broadway production of **Hamlet** with a long black leather greatcoat in the early scenes. This instantly elevated him from Emo Kid to Darker and Edgier, right off the bat, which is unusual. Picture here.<small>◊</small>
-   Just like his film counterpart, J.D. in **Heathers** wears a long, black trenchcoat. It's easily one of the most iconic parts of the character and a very thinly veiled reference to the Columbine shooters.
-   In any production of **Les Misérables**, Javert gets one from "The Robbery/Javert's Intervention" into "Stars", often worn unbuttoned during "Javert's Soliloquy" to show distress.
-   A production of **Macbeth** at the Guthrie Theater gave both Macbeth and Banquo long, black leather jackets in their first scene.

-   **Assassin's Creed**:
    -   Pretty common with more modern Assassins that drop the Badass Long Robes in favor of these.

Jacob and Evie Frye of **Assassin's Creed Syndicate** continue this tradition.
    -   On the other side of the Templar/Assassin conflict, Shay in **Assassin's Creed Rogue** sports a pretty nifty greatcoat after he's formally inducted into the Templars. The one he wears during his transition period from the Assassins to the Templars is pretty good too.

    -   Soma Cruz from the **Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow** and **Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow** duology has a white long coat that manages to be badass, especially with the pimp qualities. The 21st century is obviously the era of Badass Fashion.

    -   Richter has a blue tailcoat extending to his ankles in **some** of his character models. Juste has a similar coat, this time in red.
    -   Alucard has a black justaucorps trimmed with gold thread. He sports a more standard longcoat in the **Lords of Shadow** timeline.
    -   Dracula himself is getting in on the longcoat action in the **Lords of Shadow** timeline. The coat is **made of blood!**
-   **Cataclysm** has a few sorts of trenchcoat available to find or craft, mainly useful for the multitude of pockets. Special mention goes to the survivor trenchcoat (normal or sleeveless) that experienced tailors can craft, which adds a bit more protection.
-   In the superhero MMORPG **City of Heroes** (and its sister game/expansion **City of Villains**), longcoats are unlocked for an account that's been active for over three months. They come in several types (long, short, tattered, split) and take up the 'back' slot for capes or wings. Like every costume choice, there is no effect on gameplay besides looking cool, but when you cross it with the Dual-Wielding Guns for the Blaster, you inject your character with Awesomeness.
-   **Crossbow Crusade**: The Player Character is a monster hunter who's exterminating an infestation of zombies and monsters in the aptly-named Dead Kingdom, and rocks a brown longcoat while doing so.
-   A variety of gear from **Dark Souls** allows the player to rock the badass longcoat look such as the Wanderer's Coat and the Black Cleric Robe.

-   **Deus Ex Universe**:
    -   In **Deus Ex**, JC Denton wears a dramatic long black coat. This is lampshaded by Agent Navarre in an interview: "I do not expect you to perform as well as Agent Hermann, but the mission will require us to do more than frighten the NSF with our baggy coats that make us look bigger than we really are." His brother Paul wears such a coat as well, as does Walton Simons. That is to say, three-quarters of the world's nano-augmented population wears a Badass Longcoat.
    -   The protagonist of **Deus Ex: Human Revolution**, Adam Jensen, looks to be continuing... sorry, **starting** the tradition with a badass neo-renascentist black trenchcoat, complete with an awesome floral print on the shoulders. It has slits for his arm blades, and openings that magnetically attach themselves to his Typhoon Ports. It's so cool that the producers actually made it available for purchase. Before you run out and purchase official merchandise, you may want to compare the coat offered in the above link to what Adam Jensen's coat actually looks like<small>◊</small>. No, they barely have anything in common.
-   **Devil May Cry**:
-   Lewton from **Discworld Noir**: Brown trenchcoat with leather added over the shoulders, and a matching fedora.
-   Axel and Kurtis of the **Disgaea** series wear longcoats. The former's is white with an extremely high collar, and the latter's is gray with a light blue collar. Before reincarnating, the real!Overlord Zenon wore one of these, as well.
-   A Mage Hawke from **Dragon Age II** wearing the Mantle of the Champion sports a variant, having a battle-worn, badass tailcoat. S/he can also achieve this look with the Fugitive's Mantle from the Mage Pack DLC, which had previously belonged to their father.
    -   Varric, the party's wisecracking dwarven crossbow\-slinger sports a knee-length leather trenchcoat with an impressively oversized belt and cuffs.
    -   Come **Dragon Age: Inquisition** and they're everywhere: Varric still has his, and half the game's rogue armours feature some form of billowing overcoat.
-   **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim** has quite a few examples, but the most prominent examples are Ulfric Stormcloak, who wears a long coat made of **chain-mail** under an animal pelt, and the Thalmor (think evil Nazi elves), who wear long black often-hooded robes which look like standard long-coats.
-   Sebastian Castellanos wears a long trench coat for the opening segment of **The Evil Within** before being discarded after a few minutes.
-   Daniel from the free indie RPG **Exit Fate** wears a black one with gold trim.
-   **Fable II** allows you to wear a variety of coats, two of which stand out as badass: the Noble Gent's Coat and the Highwayman Coat.
-   The **Fallout** series:
    -   **Fallout 3** gives you the chance to wear at least two different types of dusters, both of which look badass.
        -   Colonel Autumn wears a trenchcoat and gives a pretty good show of being evil.
        -   The Regulators, a law enforcement group with standard issue dusters.
        -   The Mysterious Stranger also wears a trench coat in the private eye tradition.
        -   Grab the overcoat of General Chase (either from **Operation Anchorage** via console command or from **Mothership Zeta**'s Cargo Hold).
    -   The NCR Ranger combat armor in **Fallout: New Vegas**. It is exactly the armor the person in the game cover is wearing.
        -   The companion Tycho back in the first game looks almost the same... according to the flavour text and his dialogue, at least; the actual sprite is standard.
        -   Ulysses wears one with the flag of the Old World on the back. After Lonesome Road, Ulysses gives the Courier one of his own called "Courier's Duster" which also has a flag on the back, the precise flag depending on whatever faction you choose to rule the Mojave. Aligning with the NCR gives you a 2-headed bear, Legion gives you a Bull, House gives you an Old World USA flag, and Independent gives you the symbol for Vault 21, representing New Vegas.
        -   Lonesome Road also has the US Army General outfit, an olive-drab overcoat that belonged to a pre-War general in the Divide, and the Riot Gear armors, which resemble the Ranger longcoat armor, but are not faction affiliated. Elite Riot Grear is the unique variant, with the highest damage threshold and durability.
    -   Continuing the tradition, **Fallout 4** offers a number of different longcoat options.
        -   The Silver Shroud costume is a long, black trench coat paired with the Silver Shroud's iconic silver Scarf of Asskicking, and comes with a matching hat and gun to complete the look.
        -   You can also try out the Minutemen General's outfit, which combines an American revolutionary war-era style coat worn over painted combat armour to look a bit like Captain America's costume.
        -   The Badass Longcoat is also the garb of choice for Nick Valentine (who has one which makes him look like a 50's film noir detective) and Hancock (who prefers a nautical pirate-style one, which he got from a historical exhibit of his namesake).
        -   Elder Maxson has a beard, a Badass Scar and a Badass Longcoat.
        -   Institute Coursers all wear a coat based on Roy Batty's coat.
-   The **Final Fantasy** series abounds with them:
    -   **Final Fantasy VI**: The character of Setzer wears an overcoat, drinks, gambles, and pilots both of the only flying machines (The Blackjack and the Falcon) to appear in the game.
    -   **Final Fantasy V**: Faris of has one very similar to Setzer's in the concept art and PS1 version's FMV cutscenes. She is not depicted wearing this in the game, sadly.
    -   **Final Fantasy VIII**'s Seifer Almasy, the Rival Turned Evil for Squall, wears the Badass Longcoat in light grey. Irvine wears one in buckskin. In a Lighter and Softer version, Rinoa has a sleeveless powder-blue duster in some sort of rib knit.
    -   **Final Fantasy X**'s Auron wears one in deep red, and fights with one arm unsleeved.
    -   **Final Fantasy XV**: Noctis Lucis Caelum wore a long black coat in the first teaser trailer.
    -   **Final Fantasy VII**'s Big Bad Sephiroth wears a signature trenchcoat with pauldrons on the shoulders. His coat changes with every game he's in, but never too far from its original appearance (i.e. **Kingdom Hearts**, there are wings underneath the coat, and it even gets a red trim.) There is a replica of the original Final Fantasy VII version.
    -   **Crisis Core** gives us Genesis's long red coat with black leather shoulders which floats around behind him nicely as he descends (backwards) from the sky.
    -   Freya Crescent from **Final Fantasy IX**. Coat, hat, spear. Talk about awesome costumes.
    -   Snow Villiers from **Final Fantasy XIII** has one as well. And the coat is so badass, they made it **into his weapon**. The coat is fitted with Cocoonite technology that uses the Antimatter Manipulation Principle to amplify his punches and lessen blows to his body, as dictated by the emblem he wears upon his back.
-   For a while, the standard garb for Swordmasters in **Fire Emblem** gave them the appearance of a Badass Longrobe (or Long-Slitted-Skirt for female characters), until Lloyd from **The Blazing Blade**, whose sprite was edited to reflect the longcoat he wears in his character art. As of **Radiant Dawn**, the longcoat is the signature garb of the Trueblade. Also, the alternate sprite used for the Hero class unit is depicted with a longcoat in the GBA games. Notable Mercenary/Hero units include Raven, Callech, and most notably — Linus.
-   Antonio Guster in the **F-Zero** games wears a long lab coat over his combat outfit.
-   **Gears of War**:
    -   Two sorts of Elite Mooks (Theron Guards and Kantus) are distinguished first and foremost visually by their long dark coats.
    -   Additionally, General RAAM wears a strikingly similar outfit in black.
    -   Let's not forget Aaron Griffin in **Gears of War 3** — he's the only human wearing a longcoat in the entire series!
-   Inspector Cabanela in **Ghost Trick** has a pure white trenchcoat that signifies his spotless record. And there's the awesome moment later in the game is when Detective Jowd re-dons his own trenchcoat, symbolizing his transition from fatalistic Death Seeker to proactively pursuing the manipulator.
-   In **The Godfather: The Game**, the menu hints outright tell you that the enemy gangsters with longcoats are superior to those without.
-   Isaac from **Golden Sun: Dark Dawn** manages to snag himself one in the thirty year gap between it and Lost Age.
-   Appears throughout the **Growlanser** series. Crevaniel, the protagonist in **Wayfarer of Time** is always wearing his longcoat.
-   **Guild Wars 2** has these among leather armor, particularly a set<small>◊</small> that doubles as the Lionguard NPC uniform.
-   In **I Miss the Sunrise**, Chac's old uniform is a stylish red coat with brilliant gold trim. In fact, getting it back is necessary in order to bring him back from the Despair Event Horizon and recruit him.
-   John and Raven from **Immortal Souls** both wear billowing black leather coats that serve as their "armor" in terms of the games' defense mechanics.
-   Count Veger in **Jak 3: Wastelander**. He's got a long, regal-looking coat, but isn't actually seen doing anything really badass.
-   Mr. R from Boy Love game **Kichiku Megane** probably qualifies. The coat is in varying shades of black and tied shut with a belt piece. It also has a high collar that hides even more of this face than his glasses (with their occasional bonus points) and his bangs.
-   Helghast Stormtroopers in **Killzone Liberation** also wear distinguishing black coats.
-   **Kingdom Hearts**:
-   In **Lamplight City**, the Player Character, Detective Miles Fordham, wears a long black leather coat. Miles even lampshades it at one point, when his partner, Bill, asks him if he has ever considered wearing something else, telling Bill that his coat is a gift from his wife and that gives him a certain sense of "character". Bill cannot help but snark a bit at this:
    
    **Bill:** Right. Brooding detective in a long back coat. That's **never** been seen before.  
    **Miles:** What are you talking about, Bill?  
    **Bill:** Nevermind.
    
-   Ganondorf in **The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker** wears a pretty cool longcoat, the sleeves being so large that he actually has a sword hidden in each.
-   **The Long Dark** has the wolfskin coat, which is made by your character from, well, wolf skins. The item description says:
    
    Handcrafted outerlayer. Warm, tough, and tells Wolves — and everyone else — you are not to be trifled with.
    
-   Mordin Solus. **Mass Effect 2**. Wears lab coat over commando gear. \*sharp inhale\*. Awesome.
-   **The Matrix: Path of Neo** being a **The Matrix** game has nearly all of the rebels, particularly Morpheus and Trinity wearing these.
-   **Metal Gear**:
    -   **Metal Gear Solid**: Liquid Snake, Revolver Ocelot and Psycho Mantis all wear the same style: brown leather with wide epaulets. Vulcan Raven wears one in the wide picture in the manual; it's a wonder it fits over his shoulders. Decoy Octopus wears a long coat in official artwork, but fails to do much of anything that could be construed as badass.
    -   **Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty**: Fortune wears hers simply draped over her shoulders, giving her the best of both a Badass Longcoat and a Cape.
    -   Big Boss is always drawn with one of these post-**Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker**.
    -   In **Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain**, Kazuhira Miller starts wearing a coat similar to the one worn by Col. Trautman from **First Blood**.
-   Gamov from the remake of **Ninja Gaiden**, despite having a long green coat, Cool Shades and a capacity for Offscreen Teleportation, he never does anything wow-inducing.
-   Henry Cooldown of **No More Heroes** wears a nice gray coat with a popped collar. It's suspiciously missing in the sequel, but he still pulls off the Badass in a Nice Suit look.
-   Reaper from **Overwatch** adorns one that also serves as **Hammerspace** for his Hellfire Shotguns.
-   Wes from **Pokémon Colosseum** has one. It is always blowing in the wind, even in Pokémon battles.
-   Cynthia from **Pokémon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum** has a black one. Palmer, the Tower Tycoon and Barry's father, also sports a green one which notably blows in the wind in his sprite animation in **Platinum** and **HeartGold/SoulSilver**.
    -   Looker from Platinum also has a nice one.
        -   As do the Veteran Trainer class. Predictably, they tend to have rather powerful Mons.
-   The titular Dude of the **Postal** series wears a knee-length black trench coat over a blue Roswell T-shirt in the first and second games. This is replaced by an ankle-length brown duster, complete with bullet holes in the collar, for **Postal III**.
-   Razputin Aquato aquires one near the beginning **Psychonauts 2**. Only it's not a longcoat at all, but an oversized blazer Sasha gave Raz after his fellow interns stole his clothes and locked him in a closet. He makes the most of it.
-   **Raid 2020**: Shadow, the player character, always wears a (dark grey in the game, brown on the boxart) trenchcoat.
-   **Red Dead Redemption** has a duster as a reward for having a high honor level, and the even cooler black coat you get for achieving Legend of the West status.
-   The more-or-less unknown protagonist of **Red Steel 2**. All we know about him is that he wears a longcoat, and that he's chosen to take on the town of Caldera all by himself. And he wields a katana **and** a revolver.
-   **Resident Evil**:
    -   Mr. X (Tyrant 00) from **Resident Evil 2** is wearing one of these and he really looks very badass with that coat. The same can be said of Vitorez Mendez from **Resident Evil 4** and also Nemesis in **Resident Evil 3: Nemesis**, just to mention the three characters who have their coats burn off to reveal horrendous transformations.
    -   Albert Wesker in **Resident Evil 5** and **Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles**. Both his spiffy black trench-coat and his entire tight-fitting outfit are completely made out of leather. He just knows how to look cool.
-   In **Rimworld**, dusters are the ultimate outerwear for many situations. They provide excellent protection from hot weather and are decent against the cold too. They provide better armour than any other clothing, and can even be competitive with the lighter forms of power armour if made from the best materials. Plus they look cool on a pawn's icon.
-   **Rune Factory**: Aden from **Rune Factory Oceans** wears what appears to be an older version of this.
-   Morningstar Specialists from **Saints Row: The Third** wear blood red ones.
    -   You can invoke this by buying a trenchcoat in one of the clothing shops in the series.
-   In **Sands of Destruction**, Morte wears a long, hot pink, fitted coat. Agan wears a long green coat, but he's more of a Butt-Monkey even if he **is** capable in a fight.
-   **Sengoku Basara**'s Katakura Kojuurou wears a brown duster that sweeps to the ground. It's utterly anachronistic, but hey, what's history when compared to badassery, right? And he's so badass that they made him playable in the expansion pack.
-   **Shin Megami Tensei**:
    -   In **Shin Megami Tensei I**, although the Chaos Hero sports an urban camo trenchcoat and a brash demeanor, he is physically weak and openly admits to such, constantly relying on other characters for help. Although that may not be the case during gameplay...
    -   And in **Shin Megami Tensei IV**, they are standard issue for the Samurai.
    -   **Persona**:
        -   In **Persona 2**, the Masquerade bosses sport these.
        -   Shinjiro of **Persona 3**, unlike the rest of the party, only has one outfit. And it's a Badass Longcoat. The protagonist's usual outfit can also sometimes display some aspects of the Badass Longcoat without being one.
        -   The initial Persona of the Protagonist of **Persona 4**, Izanagi, sports an awesome black longcoat. Izanagi-No-Okami, the Protaganist's ultimate Persona who is only attainable in the True Ending, has an even more impressive white one that billows epically as he is summoned to defeat the final boss.
        -   In **Persona 4: Arena**, Mitsuru wears a thick, white fur coat, thus also making the coat Pretty in Mink and Kicking Ass in All Her Finery.
        -   **Persona 5**: As part of his Phantom Thief persona that fights Eldritch Abominations and reforms the corrupt, the Protagonist wears a fancy black coat that goes down to his ankles. Also, "Kasumi"/Sumire Yoshizawa wears a long black coat that is exactly like Joker's.
    -   In **Devil Survivor 2**, these are **standard uniform** for JP's.
-   The not-all-there, blood-splattered trenchcoat wearing villain Walter Sullivan of **Silent Hill 4**.
-   **Space Station 13's** Head of Security usually starts with a great coat. It's understandably both one of the best non-metal armor items in the game and the most ridiculously badass.
-   In **Brood War**'s opening cinematic, Admiral Du Galle and Vice-Admiral Stukov are both wearing badass military longcoats with epaulets.
    -   In the sequel, Stukov returns as an infested Terran. Despite his left side's severe mutations and all the fights and/or experiments he's been through, his badass coat only looks mildly worn, like you'd expect after a few years of every-day use.
-   Crimson Viper from **Street Fighter IV** has a longcoat as her alternate costume. It's badass on its own, even before factoring in the taser gloves and flamethrower shoes.
-   **Suikoden III** has Albert Silverberg known in the early parts of the game as the "Man in Coat" because of his awesome-looking white and black coat that he wears.
-   From **Endless Frontier**, we have Haken Browning, with his black and red longcoat.
    -   In **Super Robot Wars Alpha**, we have Sänger Zonvolt, the infamous Sword That Cleaves Evil — he wears a red longcoat that resembles the justaucorps variety. He manages to make it billow, even if it's a rather short coat<small>◊</small>. His rival Wodan Ymir also wears a blue version of the same coat.
-   **Tales of Destiny 2**: Karell Berselius wears an awesome dark red one with laces up the sleeves and fur along both the sleeves and hood. It doubles as Coordinated Clothes with his sister Harold's attire.
-   Ricardo from **Tales of Innocence**: black and double-breasted. What he wouldn't do for his little brother...
-   Raven from **Tales of Vesperia** has a very snazzy purple coat.
-   Wild Dog, the immortal (?) mercenary from **Time Crisis**. Quite fond of throwing it off dramatically when he gets down to business.
-   In the strategy game **Tooth and Tail**, one of the playable commanders, Bellafide, not only wears a long, blue overcoat, but he also commands the faction known as "The Longcoats", who wear this trope as their hat. Well, in context of the story anyway. In game, all the animals you command look exactly the same regardless of the commander leading them, with only a difference in clothing color to denote which faction they hail from, and half of these critters don't even wear **shirts**, let alone a coat or jacket.
-   Seems to be common in the **Trails Series** for a Master Swordsman to wear this outfit. Examples include Loewe, Arios MacLaine, and Rean Schwarzer.
    -   The Dominion, the highest ranking knights of the Septian Church who all possess a rare superpower all wear a styled long coat with church iconography stiched into it, customized to each member by a different color and length. It's typically a tell to the player that a character is a Dominion (which usually isn't revealed in story for quite a while) if they're wearing or suddenly switched outfits into one of these coats.
-   Gordeau and Seth in **Under Night In-Birth**. Gordeau's is a purple duster-style coat, while Seth's is something of a trenchcoat.
-   Parodied in **Urban Dead**, where characters with overly "badass" description, especially the ones with long coats, scars, katanas (and other weapons not in the game) etc. are mocked to no end. The term "trenchcoater" also a negative term for the Munchkins of the game.
    -   This also exists in the MMORPG **Nexus War**, which was founded and played by a lot of **Urban Dead** players.
-   **The End Times: Vermintide**'s Victor Saltzpyre sports this as part of the typical attire of a Witch Hunter for both practical traveling and intimidation purposes.
-   Lord General Castor<small>◊</small> of The Imperial Guard in **Warhammer 40,000**: **Dawn of War II: Retribution** wears a very spiffy dark-red-trimmed tan-coloured greatcoat, and ups the badass factor by only wearing **one** sleeve; he leaves his augmetic arm uncovered. This is the same augmetic arm he uses to wield a sniper rifle (or other special weapon) **one-handed**. In multiplayer, the Lord General Hero's greatcoat takes on colours set in the Army Painter, so you can have a gold or silver-trimmed black greatcoat. Or perhaps neon purple with metallic green trim, if that's more your thing.
-   **Watch\**Dogs**: Protagonist Aiden Pearce wore a knee length coat in all his outfits. The coat reappears as an unlockable outfit piece in the sequel after an episode in which he appears, though no other coats are available in that game.
-   Your character in **X-Kaliber 2097** is a longcoat-clad Master Swordsman wielding the titular weapon, and kicks all sorts of ass with it. Said longcoat tends to flow around as you jump in platforming areas.
-   **Yakuza**: One of the signs that Shinji Took a Level in Badass after the Time Skip is that he starts rocking a very stylish black leather longcoat.
    -   Kiryu's Friend on the Force, Makoto Date, has the standard issue detective longcoat as his usual outfit. While he's not a face wrecker like Kiryu, Date's still a very competent and persistent detective and his snooping is usually key in getting Kiryu to the Big Bad so he can do his thing.

Badass Longcoat Example in Visual Novels

-   **Ace Attorney**:
    -   Detective Tyrell Badd of **Ace Attorney Investigations**, the only person ever to dodge one of Franziska's whip strikes. He wears it so he will never forget his greatest failure, and since then it has become riddled with holes. **Bullet** holes.
    -   Subverted with Detective Dick Gumshoe, whose brown duster usually doesn't help out his Butt-Monkey status. He gets a newer, brighter trenchcoat from someone important to him. Notably, he wears the old one during later investigations so that his new one doesn't get stained and dirty.
    -   If you pay attention to the stills of Edgeworth in 1-4 and 2-3, he seems to favour the longcoat as well.
    -   And speaking of the Edgeworths, Gregory Edgeworth seems to favour a long overcoat in his appearance in **Ace Attorney Investigations 2**, which he then passes on to his student after his death.
-   Nagito Komaeda of **Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair** has his iconic red & green knee-length zipper hoodie with a jagged-cut tail.
-   Archer from **Fate/stay night**! Badassery aside, it's not a true longcoat; it's actually a pair of sleeves and a long battle-skirt-thing. Looks damn similar, though.
    -   Kotomine Kirei definitely qualifies with his bulletproof priest's robes, and proves in **Fate/Zero** that people don't necessarily die when they are killed. Kiritsugu Emiya also sports a more traditional style duster.
-   This coat is compulsory for a Great Detective like Willard H. Wright in **Umineko: When They Cry**. His Badassery is better displayed in **Ougon Musou Kyouku**.

Badass Longcoat Example in Web Animation

-   **DSBT InsaniT**: Seth wears one. Its silver and he even has armbands to match.
-   **Dreamscape**:
    -   Aseir's is tattered and has got skulls on the sleeves too.
    -   Ethan's has snakes on it.
-   Starting from **Madness Combat 5: Depredation**, Hank dons a black longcoat. Deimos also has one as well. His rival Jesus meanwhile wears a white longcoat.
-   **Helluva Boss**: Blitzo always wears a tattered greatcoat on the job. In the pilot he specifically draws attention to it.

---
Badass Longcoat Example in Webcomics

-   **Angel Moxie**: Riley and Tristan get individual ones when powered up.
-   In **Bloodand Smoke**, Detective John Carson regularly wears a trench-coat.
-   In **Captus Cinematic Universe**, Malus wears a white longcoat as his villain attire of choice. In his debut comic, it waves behind him as he jumps off an exploding building.
-   In **Charby the Vampirate**, vampire hunters Vic and Blaine both wear long coats when they go out a-slaying. Nebbish boss Blaine wears a black, buckled coat over his office attire. Vic sported a plain grey coat for the longest time but recently had an upgrade to a dark grey long coat with red trim. Charby himself prefers long coats with lots of expressive tendrils of shredded cloth at the bottom.
-   Jerry Andrews of **Coga Suro** habitually wears the same dark grey coat throughout the comic's first run, even indoors, contrasting with the other cast members who usually wear t-shirts or similar. Slightly subverted in that he's the The Smart Guy rather than a consistent badass.
-   Komiyan from **Darken** in this scene where he shows Tarvin/Shard that evil is indeed a cut-throat business.
-   Gun-for-hire Black Monday Blues from **Dead Winter** has an eye for these, and chooses to keep it the whole way through the comic. The fact that he is the group's Hypercompetent Gunslinger, definitely makes him plenty badass.
-   Donovan Deegan of **Dominic Deegan** has a badass long coat... made even more badass in that said long coat is **pink.**
-   Abraham from **El Goonish Shive** wears a fedora and trench coat created as "modern garb" when he sets out to kill Ellen. Dan himself says that this outfit is essentially the modern-day equivalent of a wizard's cloak.
    -   Ellen also used to wear a longcoat. Dan comments in retrospect that he ought to bring it back, because "it's long and it's cool."
-   Shiva Crimson from **EVIL** is a literal Lightning Bruiser, and her standard attire includes a longcoat.
-   John Oliver in **Fake News Rumble** wears one, combined with a Scarf of Asskicking which sure looks familiar...
-   **Fetch Quest: Saga of the Twelve Artifacts** has Lionel "the Lucky" and his black jacket. It's especially apparent when it makes him more intimidating than he really is.
-   Kalita, Debbie, and Leyline from **Furry Fight Chronicles** wore long coats as a symbol of them being the founding members of the Roda Kira Gang.
-   Arguably, Morgan of **Gender Swapped** pulls this off, and with a lab coat no less. (You know those things that scientists wear? Or in this case brain surgeon.) Word of God states that during the far and upcoming story arc involving the TBO, a lot of badassery was supposed to take place, with Morgan leading the march.
-   Baron Klaus Wulfenbach, the Anti-Villain dictator of Europa in **Girl Genius**. His is a greatcoat that serves to make his already imposing figure more so. An early version is shown here. It's sufficiently Badass that it makes him look imposing even from the back, with a baby in a backpack.
-   **Gunnerkrigg Court** includes one in the traditional garb of defender of the Court.
    -   Briefly used in Chapter 19 — Antimony is wearing a Gunnerkrigg uniform trenchcoat when she gets pulled into Zimmy's Black Bug Room. When Zimmy flips out and attacks her, Annie uses her Judo-ish skills to very quickly incapacitate her attacker.
-   **Iron Crown** has a few: most notably Commander Isandar of the titular mercenary Brigade who regularly faces off against demons in it, plus or minus a shotgun. Who says you can't look stylish in what amounts to an extended Escort Mission?
-   **MAG ISA** — This garment seems to be standard fare among the bad guys in this comic. Eman is the exception though because he stopped being bad.
-   **Metal Gear Solid** webcomic **The Last Days of Foxhound** has them, but it's not just Liquid who wears them.
-   Luke Surl explains the dilemma.
-   Benjamin generally wears a police trenchcoat, though he also pulls off the rare badass labcoat, in **A Miracle of Science**.
-   Practically everyone in **Problem Sleuth**, the protagonists being private eyes and the antagonists being organized crime.
-   Lord English of **Homestuck** was for a long time solely identified by his, the enormous Cairo Overcoat, to the point that one of the biggest points of conjecture about his identity was that whoever he was had to fit inside the Overcoat. It's the only thing we see of him for a very long time.
-   In **Miscellaneous Error**, main character Jack is always seen wearing something akin to a leather duster.
-   ATLAS from **MS Paint Masterpieces**, a prototype combat robot created by the military, wears this as a disguise.
-   Julio Scoundrel of **The Order of the Stick**. He is a "Dashing Swordsman", but knowing how to work the flowing brown (or black, or crimson) longcoat is part of it.
-   **Project Blackfire**: The main character Dark Flame is almost always seen wearing his long, black trenchcoat (which likes to flare dramatically.)
-   Gunhild's trenchcoat in Realmwalker. Also,Loki's furby coat.
-   Riff from **Sluggy Freelance** is a classic example. Usually, he wears a brown trenchcoat, but he's been known to level up. His humanizing quirk is the tendency of his inventions to only **mostly** work, prompting his catchphrase: "Let me check my notes."
-   Gunslinger Emily from **Spacetrawler** is rarely seen without her duster. She even wears it over her spacesuit.
-   Most of the Bloody Flames in **The Story of Anima**. Overlapping a bit with Your Size May Vary, Rudy, Kit and Hayden's normally hip-length jackets can look much longer in certain shots, creating this effect.
-   Both of the Villain Protagonists of **Suicide for Hire** wear black trenchcoats.
-   In **Supernormal Step**, Henderson Security incorporates a duster in its uniforms. Hall Henderson in particular works the coat.
-   In **Three Panel Soul**, Ian wears one of these every so often with a matching fedora, sometimes to his detriment (once passing a striking resemblance to a neighborhood watch sign, another time filling a hip flask with tic tacs and 'drinking' whilst on his morning commute).
-   Towards the end of the first story arc of **Vampire Cheerleaders**. Leonard confronts the cheerleaders threatening to expose their existence while wearing one of these. Lori's attempts to control him are rebuffed because Leonard took several precautions to make himself vampire-proof. Meaning his blood is poisonous because he ate a ton of garlic and drank Listerene, and he is wearing mirror sunglasses so they can't use their hypnosis. When they ask why he is wearing a "The Matrix" style coat he says "Because it looks cool." In the end they resort to "Plan BC" (BC for booty-call), and that they end up having an orgy with him until he not only agrees to not expose them, but become their willing thrall as well.
-   In **The Wretched Ones**, Yayne is often seen wearing a long, grey greatcoat.
-   Alex Rayne of **Wright as Rayne** wears one, though it's purple. One of Power's men also sports one.
-   Axel from **Yosh!**. He may not have guns to pull from his coat, but the demons he summons make up the difference and then some. He's a master of demonic magic and known to be one of the strongest magic users in the entire series, wearing the title of The Vile and being almost on par with the Magi.
-   Charlie from **The Zombie Hunters** fights zombies while sporting a lab coat, but favors a dark grey trenchcoat (with matching hat) in Flashback. Team medic Sammie has a more elaborate badass bab/trenchcoat\]\] accented with black buckled belts on the collar and sleeves, that she's worn in the field and on civilian clinic duty. On one mission, young teammate Katie sports a vivid red trench with similar belt accents but has thus far only flipped the bird at her smartass medic while wearing it.

-   **New York Magician**: Michel's Burberry (and later London Fog).
-   ALL of the Crusaders from the **Horizons Wiki**.

Badass Longcoat Example in Web Videos

-   **Critical Role**
    -   Percy de Rolo from Campaign 1 of is always depicted with a dark blue longcoat in an aristocratic style.
    -   Campaign 2 has several: Caleb Widogast's outfits always include a long, billowing coat, whether he's absolutely caked in filth or not; Mollymauk Tealeaf has a long, red coat completely covered in intricate embroidery that he rarely ever takes off, and Kingsley Tealeaf takes after his "brother" Molly by wearing a long, asymmetrical red captain's coat that is cropped to waist-length on one side and reaches down past his knee on the other.
-   Parodied by Travis Boles in **Three In The Afternoon** — he wears a bathrobe. Which, according to one of his foes, "smells".

Badass Longcoat Example in Western Animation

-   **Adventures of the Gummi Bears**, "For a Few Sovereigns More": Igthorn hires Flint "Stoneface" Shrubwood, the best Bounty Hunter in the land, to capture a Gummi Bear. Intimidating and capable, he wears a kickass long coat and a hat, uses Precision Guided Boomerangs to frightening effect, and effortlessly catches Cubbi. With a more reliable sponsor than Igthorn, this man would become a Hero Killer.
-   **The Batman** sees Solomon Grundy's design incorporate a duster rather than a jacket. The tie-in comic reuses this design for the real Grundy even though in the episode Grundy appeared in, he turned out to be Clayface in disguise.
-   In the 2006 revival of **Biker Mice from Mars**, General Carbine wears a long red coat and, as she did in the original 1993 series, helps her fellow Martian mice fight back against their planet's invaders.
-   In **Buzz Lightyear of Star Command**, if not known for his ability to split into multiple copies of himself, Torque is known to wear a brown outlaw styled duster jacket to fit his role as a Monster of the Week.
-   Carmen Sandiego had that awesome red one!
-   In the Netflix **Carmen Sandiego** series, the eponymous character justifies wearing her red coat everywhere including, conspicuously, a jungle said to feel 110 degrees, because that's where she keeps a wide assortment of tools. (She has, after a narrow dodge, actually suffered a Cape Snag.)
-   Timmy Turner from **Fairly OddParents** parodies the coat from the Matrix in the Wishology trilogy. Believe it or not, he does look cool.
-   The episode "Reincarnation" of **Futurama**: both Hermes and the Professor's anime forms have very badass longcoats.
-   **Gargoyles**:
    -   Macbeth. It came in handy when he fought Goliath, as he was able to quickly slip out of it and escape the gargoyle's clutches.
    -   Broadway tries to employ this trope when he's playing trenchcoat-detective. This ironically tends to backfire, when it comes to looking badass — he's more intimidating when he doesn't hide his gargoylish build — although it does help him blend in a bit.
-   "Bipper" sports a nice black one in **Gravity Falls** during the third act of "Sock Opera." It's part of his reverends' outfit.
    -   Ford emerges from the portal at the end of "Not What He Seems" wearing a black one. As of "A Tale of Two Stans", he now wears a tan longcoat over a red turtleneck.
-   Dante from **Huntik: Secrets & Seekers** wears his trench coat almost all the time.
-   Part of Inspector Gadget's usual attire.
-   Dib from **Invader Zim**, despite being about eleven years old.
-   The Misfits from **Jem** are often shown wearing long coats. Part of it is due to them being a fashionable rock band in the 80s but it also signifies them as the cool, trouble making enemies of the protagonists. Stormer's long coat is pretty much always orange.
-   From **The Legend of Korra**:
    -   Mako wears a pretty cool longcoat, complete with Scarf of Asskicking. He trades the coat in for a bodyguard's uniform in Book Four.
    -   Amon's might be a bit shorter than most but it doesn't make him look any less badass, or any less terrifying.
-   Lampshaded in **Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths and Legends**, when the un-badass Fritz is overjoyed at the opportunity to borrow the Hero's "cool coat".
-   **The Spectacular Spider Man**: Villain Doctor Octopus pairs his long coat with goggles.
-   Cad Bane from **Star Wars: The Clone Wars** wears a red/brown overcoat, one of the only characters in the whole series to wear one.
-   Static from **Static Shock** wears an open long coat like his comic counterpart. He wears the same outfit in his DC Animated Universe crossovers.
-   Hard Drive, a villain from **SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron**, derived his data-hacking/teleporting/electrical powers from his "Surge Coat". Why not just a form-fitting data-suit or a backpack and goggles? Because the Surge Coat looks **badass**.
-   Solomon, the leader of G3 in **Sym-Bionic Titan**, wears one of these.
-   Captain Crandall wears this in one episode of **Teamo Supremo**.
-   In **Thunder Cats 2011** the Duelist, a Master Swordsman with a fondness for challenging swordsmen to a Showdown at High Noon and relieving the losers of their blades, wanders around the Cattle Punk Swordsmans' Town in full Swashbuckler attire, including an extremely elaborate blue, caped military tailcoat, no less intimidating for his failure to obey The Western's genre conventions.
-   Caleb from **W.I.T.C.H.** pulls this off spectacularly throughout the series.
-   Cyclops from **Wolverine and the X-Men (2009)** wears one in costume. Gambit also has his traditional coat.

Badass Longcoat Example in Real Life

-   George Early, an American Gentleman Adventurer in the Balkans during World War II, considered himself a super-spy and wore a trenchcoat everywhere, presumably to announce himself to the Germans. The OSS was so exasperated that it simply yanked his clearance and used him for the rest of the war as no more than a decoy. Oddly enough, he occasionally showed some insight, once picking up a rumor about the atomic bomb.
-   The statue of Sir Robert Borden at the Parliament of Canada depicts him wearing an overcoat which, combined with his awesome moustache and its location at the edge of a hill overlooking Wellington Street, makes for one badass statue<small>◊</small>.
-   Napoleon Bonaparte, when he was on the battlefield in his iconic **redingote grise** (grey overcoat).
-   Andrew Jackson liked wearing long trenchcoats, especially when duelling.
-   Eddie Izzard often wears one with a red silk interior.
-   This was a standard part of the military uniform in most colder countries throughout the 20th century, and still persists in many of them. They aren't called **trench**coats for nothing.
-   A modern variation worn by the American military is the All-Weather Coat, though it is a bit cumbersome and you are unlikely to see it actually being worn, especially since lighter camouflage wet and cold weather gear is available for the battlefield uniforms.
-   Erwin Rommel is well-documented to have worn one in North Africa of all places<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
-   A rather chilling example were the black leather double-breasted trenchcoats worn by SS officers.
    -   Before that, agents of the Cheka, the first Communist secret police, wore distinctive leather overcoats.
-   Statues of Vladimir Lenin (and there were thousands of them) often depicted him with a long flowing coat.
-   Prussian soldiers wore longcoats<small>◊</small> in The Napoleonic Wars, with even an added Commissar Cap to boot. In an inversion of typical associations of this trope, though, they tended to be worn by members of the **Landwehr**, hastily-raised militiamen with little to no training.
-   Ancient Median and Persian nobles wore a riding coat both at court and in battle called the kandys that hung almost to the **ankles**. It was normally worn as a Coat Cape, though for more complicated reasons than just looking badass.
