Command Roster: 
Military and similarly organized groups are structured in a way to manage the functions of their unit. Even in shows where the team may not be technically military, there is a deliberate command infrastructure that designates seniority. As such these characters are either a small group of soldiers working together or they may just be the senior officers commanding an entire division of a platoon or vessel. The crew of a Cool Ship (or any other cool vehicle of sufficient size) often takes this form, and may be supplemented by a Redshirt Army of lesser crewmen on larger vessels. Frequently they are a Badass Crew.

Compare the Five-Man Band, which has a different structure and purpose but still follows a similar pattern. The primary difference relative to The Squad is that almost everyone in the Command Roster has a position of leadership or authority.

The Command Roster usually follows as such:

-   The Captain (The one in charge. More often than not the main character.)
-   Number Two (The go-to guy for important missions, usually the confidant of the captain. Likely to overlap with another role.)
-   Mr. Fixit or Wrench Wench (Takes care of equipment and maintenance. Usually the technical savvy.)
-   The Scientist (Examines and informs the rest on technical things. May or may not be an Omnidisciplinary Scientist.)
-   Cunning Linguist (A translator who speaks with the natives.)
-   Communications Officer (Often holding some sort of radio, yelling into it.)
-   Security Officer (Is the primary source for combat detail: security, surveillance and weaponry access.)
-   The Marine (The Marine is likely self-assumed or just the best fighter and differs from security officer in that they specialize in fighting, be they armed or unarmed.)
-   The Medic (Either a full-fledged doctor with a staff and hospital conditions or a field medic.)
-   The Chef (The one who cooks meals for the crew to keep them fed.)

Sometimes there are a few additions to the crew. These additional characters may be separate from the others, but often there is overlap.

-   Ace Pilot / Driver (Self-explanatory, the hotshot pilot. Not always on the team, especially if there isn't a Cool Car or Cool Ship)
-   The Navigator (Figures out how to get where they're going. Usually works closely with the Ace Pilot).
-   The Heart (Takes care of the team's social well-being and is the moral center. Often not in combat. Usually overlaps with another role. If its own character, might be the cook or bartender. Sometimes the Team Mom)
-   Medical Staff (If there is an entire hospital, The Medic heads it, but one person can't run a hospital alone.)
    -   Dr. Feelgood or Dr. Jerk (Qualified to practice medicine, but doesn't really care about patients.)
    -   The Nurse (Either one of the Hospital Hotties the team employs, or a Battleaxe Nurse to stir things up.)
    -   The Shrink (Takes care of the team's mental health, which may be necessary considering what they have to go through in their adventures.)
-   Army Scout (Traversing the front lines to bring back intel to the main crew. May be redundant with Communications Officer or Security Officer)
-   The Red Shirt (So someone can get killed without impacting the plot.)

Some additional roles are not officially part of the crew, but interact with them frequently enough to earn a mention in the team list:

-   The Superior (Someone the captain reports to, usually not a regular crew member. Is often concerned with the more political aspect of things, especially in regards to a governing council.)
    -   Reasonable Authority Figure (Outranks everyone on the crew. Sticks to the rules, but willing to give them leeway when necessary. Sometimes is like a mentor to the group.)
    -   The Neidermeyer (Has the same job as the Reasonable Authority Figure, but completely unlikeable to those under him.)
-   Obstructive Bureaucrat (Obviously not a member of the team, but likely someone who is giving the Reasonable Authority Figure or The Captain a hard time.)
-   Mission Control (A Voice with an Internet Connection who is capable of leading them with satellite imagery and other information. The Communication Officer's other end.)

The members can be divided into three types: the leadership roles, the intelligent members and the action-oriented members. This may be why, in comparison to the Five-Man Band, the roles don't always line up perfectly:

-   The Leader will often be The Captain, but is just as likely to be Number Two and on rare occasions, The Scientist.
-   The Lancer is usually Number Two, but can also be The Scientist or The Security Officer, especially if Number Two overlaps with another role.
-   The Big Guy is likely The Security Officer and/or The Marine, but can be Number Two as well.
-   The Smart Guy is most often The Scientist, but can just as easily be The Medic, Mr. Fixit or the Cunning Linguist.
-   The Sixth Ranger is just as likely with the Command Roster, usually stepping on the toes of one of the other roles.

Compared to The Squad, however, the roles are a little more consistent:

-   General Ripper: The Superior
-   Colonel Badass: The Captain
-   Sergeant Rock: Number Two
-   Space Marine or Cold Sniper: Security Officer or The Marine
-   Cunning Linguist: Cunning Linguist
-   The Engineer: Mr. Fixit
-   Combat Medic: The Medic
-   Ensign Newbie or New Meat: varies

For further reference, see also Common Ranks and Common Military Units.

There are times when various characters are missing or replaced with a different character type, all depending on the needs of the story. It is only a Command Roster when there are at least four characters from the primary list, otherwise it is just The Squad.

The very presence of main characters in command roles, especially if they have an army of Ghost Extras to back them up, typically leads to The Main Characters Do Everything.

    -   Uses literal military rankings. Interestingly, Sgt. Major Kururu (a Mr Fix It type) technically outranks the main character Sgt. Keroro (the actual platoon leader). Various rationales exist in the story to explain Keroro's position, but mainly it's heavily implied Kururu was too socially offputting and a technological liability back home, and was dumped in Keroro's platoon simply to get him off-world. Ironically, Kururu himself is happy to follow the undemanding Keroro who allows him to mess with his inventions/pranks unmolested.

Command Roster Example in Tabletop Games

-   **Rogue Trader**
    -   The Captain - the Rogue Trader himself.
    -   The Security Officer/ Marine - Arch-Militant, the precise designation depending on character.
    -   Communications Officer - Astropaths Transcendent, who dispense with the radio and just shout into the Warp.
    -   Mr. Fixit/The Scientist - Explorator
    -   The Heart- Missionary. Bear in mind this is a Warhammer 40,000 game; that moral center tends to be based on setting fire to heretics.
    -   The Navigator - surprisingly enough, Navigators.
    -   The Scientist (again)/Cunning Linguist - Seneschal. Scientist's a bit of a stretch, but this is the guy who knows everything about trade and the ins and outs of local life — his "technical things" are more likely to be an Ork blockade on a space-lane rather than the inner workings of a plasma drive.
    -   Ace Pilot - Void-Masters, although they may instead be expert gunners or scanner operators, rather than specialising in piloting.
-   In **Paranoia**, the Mandatory Bonus Duties typically assigned to Troubleshooter teams are Team Leader, Communication and Recording Officer, Equipment Guy, Happiness Officer, Hygiene Officer, and Loyalty Officer. (1st edition played around with variations like Robotics Officer; 2nd edition more or less standardized it.)
    -   **Extreme Paranoia** included an alternate set with things like Alertness Officer and Public Relations Officer.
    -   One mission introduces Executive Officer, who (in addition to the usual roles) gets a brevet promotion for the purpose of wearing a higher-clearance uniform, to draw the fire of Commies mistaking him for the Team Leader. As usual for **Paranoia**, The Computer didn't think this through properly:
        
        **Green-clearance Team Leader:** All right, men, let's go!
        
        **Random bystander:** Hey, why are you letting him boss you around?
        
        **"Blue"-clearance Executive Officer:** Hey, yeah! **\*blam blam blam blam blam blam\*** All right, men, let's go!
        
-   The Crew of Skyship Weatherlight probably counts:
    -   The Captain: Sisay in terms of title. Gerrard possibly counts in terms of role and personality, too.
    -   Number Two: Tahngarth
    -   Mr. Fixit: Divided between Karn and Ertai.
    -   The Medic: Orim
    -   Ace Pilot: Hanna

    -   The Captain: The Captain, who has the highest authority on the station.
