Action Mom: 
We all wish she was our mom.

_"\[She is\] a loving wife and mother who would prove to be as skilled at kicking asses as she was at wiping them."_

— **Narrator** introducing Shirley, _Community_, "Pillows and Blankets"

When an Action Girl is confronted with motherhood, she usually has two choices. She could accept the baby and her "fate" to Stay in the Kitchen; or she can keep her Action Girl status by losing her baby through the wonders of a Magical Abortion, a Convenient Miscarriage or simply giving it up for adoption if it gets born.

The Action Mom says bollocks to that and chooses to Take a Third Option as she keeps her role as savior of the day and the world _while raising her children_. She's a real badass mother.

Beware if you ever harm her children, for you will have an Action Girl invoking the Mama Bear at your heels. There is also a chance that said children will grow up to be badasses just like her.

Related to Action Girlfriend, as she may graduate to "Mom" status if she and her boyfriend tie the knot and have kids of their own. Alternatively, a Battle Couple may find themselves acting as parental surrogates, with the female effectively taking on this role. Truth in Television in the case of mothers working in hazardous jobs such as police work.

Often the matriarch of a Badass Family. If she enters this state before the child has even been born, she is a Pregnant Badass.

Action Mom Example in Comic Books

-   **Marvel Universe**:
    
    -   Susan "Sue" Storm-Richards of the **Fantastic Four** is a mother of two, and still the strongest member of the four. **Do not hurt her children if you know what's good for you.**
    -   Jean Grey of the **X-Men**. Oddly enough Jean fits this despite **never** having actually carried a child. All her offspring are from alternate universes or timelines.
    -   In X-Men (2013), Jubilee becomes one after adopting a baby which she names Shogo.
    -   Jessica Jones. She laid the smackdown on Kang the Conqueror (a guy who's a threat to a team of Avengers) when he threatened to shoot her if things didn't go his way.
    
    -   Shanna the She-Devil is Happily Married to Ka-Zar and they have a son.
    -   Emma Frost has five cloned daughters, the Stepford Cuckoos. She can be protective of them, and she is quite saddened when two of them are dead (even if one of them, Esme, once betrayed and tried to kill her).
    -   Kelsey Leigh, the second Captain Britain, is a single mom of two children.
    -   Mary-Jane Watson in the alternate universe of **The Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows** where she and Peter are still married and have a daughter, Annie. In the final issue, she uses a set of exoskeletal armor to join her family in beating the hell out of Regent. When she does and her daughter asks what her codename is, she replies, "I already have one: Mom!"
        -   In the mini-series, after taking down Regent, Peter uses his technology to make a suit (that mimics his own spider-powers) for Mary Jane, since Annie was increasingly engaging in superheroics and needed someone to keep an eye on her.
    -   In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Magda is revealed as such in the **Ultimate Wolverine** miniseries. Also Monica Chang, from The Ultimates.
-   **The DCU**:
    -   Hippolyta of the **Wonder Woman** mythos. Never mind the fact that Diana **is** an adult... In **Wonder Woman (1987)** she even took up the mantle of Wonder Woman for a while. Diana herself was also one Pre-Crisis as she and Steve Trevor had a daughter together.
    -   Steve Trevor's own mother was a WASP pilot during WWII.
    -   Lady Shiva is the mother of Cassandra Cain aka Batgirl and has been kicking ass since 1975.
    -   Donna Troy was also a mother before her son died in a car accident.
    -   Alanna Strange definitely fits the trope, seeing as she's apparently capable of fighting her way past the bad guy's guards, sneaking into the room where he's gloating over her captured husband, taking out the guards **there** with nerve pinches without him noticing, trading insults with him for a few minutes and then knocking him out — all while carrying her daughter in a sling around her neck.
    -   The original **Red Tornado**, although mostly played for laughs. She was a woman disguised as a male hero with no superpowers and was associated with (but not a member of) the Justice Society of America.
    -   **Supergirl**'s foster mother Eliza Danvers in **Supergirl (Rebirth)** is an agent of the D. E. O. (Department of Extra-normal Operations), a government agency created to deal with and neutralize alien threats. In **Supergirl Rebirth** #1 a Kryptonian werewolf is attacking one of the D. E. O. bases, and she quickly figures out where he comes from and what kind of ammo they need, before throwing a grenade at him.
    -   The female Dr. Light is the mother of two, and the former leader of a Justice League team.
    -   Talia Al Ghul after giving birth to Damian Wayne is still badass enough to brandish a handgun and wear a sexy catsuit or have Batman tied up against his will.
    -   The Pre-Flashpoint Lois Lane in **DC Rebirth**. Special mention when she put Batman's old Hellbat Armor to protect her son Jon from the Eradicator.
    -   Queen Atlanta, mother of Aquaman, is no slouch but ended up missing for almost his entire childhood. When he finds her again she's an impressive warrior.

-   Lupe from **Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)** is a fierce freedom fighter and mother of two. Sadly her whole family becomes roboticized.

In the series the parents getting involved is generally a big warning sign that things either have gotten really serious or are about to be wrapped up very quickly and painfully for the other party.
    -   Now that she's had a daughter of her own, Julia's adopted daughter Brittany Diggers has become a rather fierce example herself.
    -   Julia's own mother, Brunhilda Brigand, is an action mom herself, one of the few fighters who can match Julia. It really runs in the family.

-   **Ms. Tree**, originally with her stepson Michael and later with her own daughter Melodie (following a stint as a Pregnant Badass).

-   Nomi Sunrider of **Tales of the Jedi** serves as a knight in the Krath and Great Sith Wars. In one ambush, she actually fights with her daughter Vima on her hip, and in fact got started on the Jedi path when defending herself and her daughter from her husband's murderers.

-   The titular Action Girl from **Yoko Tsuno** becomes this after she adopts a little girl named Morning Dew.
-   This is a theme in **Revival**: hero cop Dana Cypress, ninja assassin Weaver Fannie, and General Louise Cale all have children.
-   Sheriff Clara Bronson of **Copperhead** is a hardheaded lawbringer raising her preteen son Zeke as a single mom.
-   Zoe Washburne in the **Series/Firefly** comics. She found out she was pregnant after her husband’s death in The Movie and she continues to be a warrior woman even while raising Emma, and later alongside her in **Firefly: Brand New 'Verse**

Leia is not tempted by the dark side even once, not even after her home planet is destroyed, she is physically and psychologically tortured, her adoptive parents are killed, her real parents are killed, her son turns evil, her husband is killed by him, and her brother vanishes. Take notes, Skywalker boys.

All while parenting a teenager.
    -   **Star Trek: Voyager**. Captain Janeway is openly referred to as being a "mother to the crew", and certainly gets Sigourney Weaver on the ass of anyone who threatens them. Probably the most overt example is in "Dark Frontier" when the Borg Queen retakes Seven of Nine back into the Collective, resulting in a custody battle fought with phaser rifles. The two-parter even ends with Janeway "tucking Seven into bed" (i.e. plugging her into the regeneration alcove).
-   Jennifer "JJ" Jareau of **Criminal Minds** continues to work for the BAU after she has her son.
-   Lindsay Messer on **CSI: NY**. Continues to work as a detective while raising a daughter with Danny. Goes all Mama Bear when Shane Casey is holding her daughter with a gun to her head. One shot, one kill.
-   Catherine Willows on **CSI** probably counts too. She isn't a cop, but still gets her share of actions sequences. And Do NOT mess with Lindsey.
-   **Lucifer** has Chloe Decker, who works as an LAPD detective while raising her young daughter, Beatrice, mostly by herself (though her ex, Daniel, occasionally lends a hand).
-   In the second season of **Falling Skies**, Dr. Glass specifically delays telling the father of her child that she's pregnant because she wants to go on a particularly dangerous mission with him.
-   We find out in season four of **Supernatural** that Mary Winchester was one of these until she left the family business in an effort to have a normal life. Not only did it not work it set a chain reaction of events off that are still screwing her children over to this day.
-   Mrs. McCall of **Teen Wolf** is an interesting example. At first, she was unaware of her son Scott's being a werewolf—but once she became privy not only to that, but all of the supernatural goings-on in her town, she quickly rose to Action Mom status, helping to fight off the various monsters that attack Scott and his friends.
-   Carol from **The Walking Dead (2010)** is a zombie-killing badass. This trope is subverted when her daughter gets infected, and subsequently gets the shit shot out of her.
-   Teyla in season five of **Stargate Atlantis** with a dose of Mama Bear (Bye, Michael.
-   In **1000 Ways to Die**, a pervert flashes a group of young moms. Unfortunately for him, the ladies were members of a fighting club named "M.I.L.F" (aka "Mothers I Want to Fight") and, without hesitation, they squirt him with their babies' milk bottles, full of breast milk. The perv grabs one and drinks the contents... too bad that the lady had eaten peanuts (so the milk had some traces of peanut in it) and the pervert had a peanut allergy, which ends up killing him.
-   **Wonder Woman (1975)**: Wonder Woman's mother is Hippolyta (the Amazon who defeated Hercules), but this is never confirmed or denied in the show. However, in "The Feminum Mystique", the Amazons overthrow the Nazis who were holding them prisoner after seizing Paradise Island. The last defining act is when Hippolyta, armed with a feminum bracelet, stares down the leader informing him that his gun is now useless against her.
-   **The White Queen**: Margaret of Anjou's husband Henry VI is imprisoned and suffers from a mental illness, so she takes matters into her own hands by waging a war on the Yorkists to secure her son's inheritance.
-   **The Witcher (2019)**: Queen Calanthe personally leads her armies into battle, then swaggers back into her throne room, armor caked in the blood of her enemies and demanding a drink.
-   **Strange Empire**: Kat. She's easily more badass than most men, especially in defense of her biological or adopted kids.
-   **Big Sky**: Cassie's an Action Girl good with a gun or her fists who's also the mother of a son named Kai.
-   **The Wheel of Time (2021)**: An Aiel woman (Tigraine, the Dragon Reborn's mother), is shown skillfully taking down several armed and armored men using her two spears while **in labor**. She gives birth right after.
-   **In From the Cold**: Anya/Jenny is highly skilled at unarmed combat and using weapons, given she's a trained assassin. Early on, she takes down multiple armed CIA agents with ease before she's overcome, and it only continues to be shown from there. In the present she's also the newly divorced mother of a teenage daughter, Becca.
-   **No Ordinary Family**: Stephanie starts spending a lot more time being there for her teenaged children once her superpowers give her time to get her work done faster, and is quick to travel across the country or fight super-powered criminals.
-   Most of the female cast of **Once Upon a Time** qualifies, whether as heroes, villains, or switching from one to the other: both Emma and Regina, Henry's mothers (biological and adoptive, respectively), **especially** when Henry's life is on the line; Snow White, who, cursed persona notwithstanding, doesn't lose an ounce of badassery after giving birth to Emma and then Neal; Granny, who's a tough cookie with a daughter (Anita, another total badass) and granddaughter; the other two Mills women, both evil Cora (Regina and Zelena's mother) and Zelena (once she gives birth ro baby Robin); Milah becomes **a pirate** after Baelfire is born (though that involves abandoning him); the second iteration of Cinderella is an all-around badass with a child, and even the first version doesn't shy away from picking up a shotgun while having her own kid and also running Stoorybrooke's daycare; Maleficent, the Black Fairy, Gothel and Lady Tremaine are all (more or less) villainous examples, too. It was somewhat inevitable, given the series' focus on strong female characters **and** family.
-   **The Power (2023)**: Zaia is heavily pregnant when she leads the slave revolt which frees her and the other women. She then leads them when they form into a rebel army, and doesn't let giving birth stop her. The last iconic shot of her in the first season is her holding a rifle in one hand as she simultaneously breastfeeds her baby, smiling joyfully after her forces defeat the Army.

-   Sweet Saraya is not only the step mother of Zebra Kid (whom Ring of Honor fans may remember as the first challenger to the rechristened World Title), not only the biological mother of Nikki Knight, Zack Zodiac and Britani Knight but in the case of the latter two, she's also been their direct competition.

-   When Kharma gave birth to her first child on December 31, 2011, people did not expect her to be back in the ring for a few more months. So imagine everybody's surprise when she apeared less than one month later as the third woman to ever participate in the Royal Rumble, easily tossing around any male wrestler who tried to confront her. Sadly, it was later revealed that her child did not survive birth.
-   Nevaeh, half of SHIMMER's first champion tag team and enforcer of CZW's Oi4K has made off handed comments about having a daughter. The other half of that team, Ashley Lane, has also made off hand comments about returning to the ring after giving birth.

-   Hindu Mythology: Durga, the powerful warrior mother-goddess.

---
Action Mom Example in Roleplaying

---
Action Mom Example in Tabletop Games

-   Spanish fanzine-turned-comic-book-turned-RPG **Fanhunter** introduced the generic character of the "Ninja Granny" (original: "Ag? ninja"; later concretized in at least one individual), who supposedly learned ninjitsu in some Age Concern course, kicking the players' collective ass and them intending them to eat her "coqrettes" (original "cocretas" instead of "croquetas").
-   The **Weapons Of The Gods** RPG has the "Xia Pregnancy" martial arts technique that allows a woman to fight at (almost) full strength while pregnant. It also protects the foetus from any attack that does not kill the mother, and, during the third trimester, protects it from attacks that DO kill her.

Action Mom Example in Visual Novels

-   **Fate/stay night**: Saber and Caster. Mordred is actually King Arthur's bastard child in the legends. Caster is actually Medea, who was a mother in the Grecian myths; a crazy ass mother who killed her own children to get revenge for her husband Jason both dumping **and** horribly defiling her in the view of everyone, but a mother nonetheless. She also gives birth to more children later on; probably the most notable is King Medus.
    -   Well, Saber is debatable. Apparently, Mordred was given birth to by Morgan Le Fay, with Arturia just serving as a sperm donor while being under a Gender Bender spell by Merlin.
-   **Umineko: When They Cry**' has 2 examples:
    -   Rosa Ushiromiya, is a Combat Pragmatist that once she is pissed off by threatening her daughter's life or her love for her is questioned, she goes directly into Unstoppable Rage mode and literally becomes a One-Woman Army equipped with a riffle and any Improvised Weapon she gets on her hand.
    -   The sister-in-law of Rosa Kyrie is also this.
-   Plum Kitaki of **Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney** might count as one. She's the wife of the most powerful mobster in the city, and as such is one of the forces behind the criminal empire they run; she also has a son, Wocky, who she loves dearly. Plum is a big, jolly woman who spends most of her time sweeping the street outside her family's estate...using a broom with an **extremely sharp katana** hidden in the handle. When the police come to seize the family's weapons, she refuses to part with it. And whenever she shows you the blade, her face goes from broad and smiling to a look that shows she knows how to use that thing to do more than clean. You don't want to mess with her.

-   **RWBY**: Huntsmen and Huntresses are men and women who fight the monsters that are overrunning the world and attempting to destroy humanity.

    **Yang**: Ruby and I grew up in Patch, an island just off the coast of Vale. Our parents were Huntsmen. Our dad taught at Signal, and our mom would take on missions around the kingdom. Her name was Summer Rose, and she was, like, Super-Mom. Baker of cookies and slayer of giant monsters.

    -   Hilgya is a Chaotic Evil example. She adventures and fights while carrying her baby around with her.

-   Mitzi McNinja of **The Adventures of Dr. McNinja**, who toughens up her sons by either poisoning her beets or challenging her eldest son (whose chosen profession as a medical professional she frowns upon) anytime he comes over to their house.

-   AmberWatch Alert, a group that is obsessed with the possibility of pedophiles in our midst, made a gun porn PSA featuring four ostensible mothers, a metric ton of gun unsafety, and the tagline "You don't have to have a gun to protect your kid, but it helps". One netizen made the obvious connection; four people + gun porn = **Left 4 Dead** advertisement. The slightly altered video makes both an excellent parody **and** an excellent **L4D3** advertisement.
-   Although her daughter is an adult now, Talon from **Less Than Three Comics** certainly fits this trope.
-   Magda "Spots" Guitart of **Spots the Space Marine** is a giant-crab-slaying, cookie-baking mom of two. Plus, she talks to aliens.

-   Just about any mother in **Digimon World: Infamy** qualifies, seeing as they're usually some of the strongest Digimon around and, due to the Digital World being what it is, they can't really afford to sit on their laurels. For specific examples, both Rain and Inari are easily some of the strongest Ultimate-level Digimon seen and still have quite a few kids, Rain especially.
-   Aphmau, the main character of **Minecraft Diaries** is both a loving mother of four and an **actual goddess**.

Action Mom Example in Western Animation

-   **Dexter's Laboratory**:
    -   Dexter's mom (OK, his whole family) participates in two episodes. Go, Dexter's family, go!
    -   There's also the episode where Dexter gives his mom super powers. However, she uses them less for Action Mom duties and more for domestic chores, like super-speed shopping.
-   Like Helen Parr, Helen Bennett (a.k.a. Mother-1) of the **Bionic Six** is the mom in a super family.
-   Tara on **The Herculoids** didn't fight too frequently, but once in a while showed quite the Action Survivor chops:

    -   In ''The Android People" she helped to rescue Zandor.
    -   In "The Spider Man (sic)" she led the Herculoids in rescuing Zandor and Dorno.

-   Maddie Fenton from **Danny Phantom** is a self-proclaimed ninth degree martial artist ghost-destroyer who still manages to make time to bake new cookie recipes.

-   Drew Saturday of **The Secret Saturdays**.
-   Lois Griffin in a episode of **Family Guy**, she was trained in Karate and was manage to fight a whole bar of people.
-   Kim Possible's mother during her A Day in the Limelight episode. Suffice it to say, she did quite a good job filling Ron's boots when he couldn't come.
    -   Kim's Nana who's an Action Grandma.
-   Loopy's mother in **Life With Loopy** becomes this in the episode "Secret Agent Mom".
-   Dear Lord, Nicole from **The Amazing World of Gumball** fits this trope like a glove. Just watch the chase scene in the DVD episode.
-   Ms. Wakeman from **My Life as a Teenage Robot**. She doesn’t hesitate to jump into action, and even fought Vexus with her bare hands in the Big Damn Movie.

-   Cheshire from **Young Justice (2010)**, who brings her baby daughter to a rescue mission to the annoyance of her husband.
-   **Avatar** franchise:
    -   The previous Earth Kingdom Avatar, Kyoshi, is the only Avatar who’s confirmed to have been a mother. She also had a ferocious reputation as a Pragmatic Hero who didn’t follow Aang’s Thou Shall Not Kill rule.
    -   **The Legend of Korra**: Suyin Beifong is a very capable Metalbender like her mother Toph was, and very protective of her children. When her daughter Opal is taken hostage (alongside the rest of the new Air Nation) by Arc Villain Zaheer, she immediately decides to participate in the fight against the villains.
    -   Toph was this as well when she was younger, considering she was the Chief of Police and one of the most powerful Earthbenders ever. In the present time she's a case of Never Mess with Granny.
-   In the three OVA post-season 2 of **Wakfu**, Evangelyne is now the mother of two children and that absolutely don't stop her from going on adventures. She's also seen teaching archery to her son.
    -   Seaon 3 trailer shows her pregnant, which might be an indication for something
-   **Saving Me**: Carla Bramble is quite handy in a fight, being a DGS Guardian, dealing with whatever mayhem the Bennets accidentally cause in a given episode, and contending with the occasional hostile alien.
-   In **Star Wars Rebels**, Rebel Alliance General Hera Syndulla acts as a mother figure to young heroes Ezra and Sabine and later gives birth to her biological son in the midst of the Galactic Civil War, continuing to serve the Rebellion until the final battle is won.
-   Queen Moon from **Star vs. the Forces of Evil**, first saving Star from angry relatives by entering her Super Mode, then fighting off the Big Bad in the Season 2 finale

-   Kaiko Nekton from **The Deep (2015)**: underwater explorer, ace submarine pilot, and Mama Bear.
-   **Molly of Denali**: Layla Mabray balances being a mother with being a badass bush plane pilot.
-   **The Owl House**: Camila Noceda, Luz's mom, is a very sweet woman who works as a vet and raised Luz on her own after her husband's death. However, she can be absolutely **ruthless** when you threaten the safety of her children, biological or not. She saved Vee from a crazy conspiracy theorist by knocking him out with her slipper, dove into a lake with zero hesitation to save Hunter from drowning, and traveled to the Boiling Isles to return the Hexsquad to their families, armed with nothing but a baseball bat. "For the Future" shows that, while glyph magic isn't her forte and she's far from the strongest hitter on the team, she definitely packs a punch.

Action Mom Example in Real Life

-   Kerri Walsh Jennings, three-time Olympic gold-medalist in Women's Beach Volleyball, gave birth to two children in between her gold-medal victories in **Beijing 2008** and **London 2012**.
-   Oksana Aleksandrovna Chusovitina, artistic gymnast and world champion who competed for the Soviet Union, the Unified Team, her native Uzbekistan, Germany, and later for Uzbekistan again — in the second-to-last last case, it was **because** of her motherhood, as it's in Germany that she and her also sportsman husband found medical aid for their son. She's actually one of the **very** few gymnasts who have returned to high-level competition after having kids (in fact she competed in her third Olympics **less than a year** after having her son), which has made her a role model for female gymnasts. Not only that, she has had far and away the longest competitive career of any female gymnast **ever**, competing in **eight** Olympic Games (she keeps saying she's going to retire, and then not doing it — chances are we'll see her in Paris). To put this in perspective, a significant percentage of the gymnasts at the 2012 Olympics in London hadn't even been **born** when Chusovitina won her first international medal (and that number will only go up in future Olympics). Bad. **Ass.**
    -   Not only is she still competing, she's **remained competitive** on vault in particular, making vault finals in three consecutive Olympic games and quite a few of the World Championships in between, and winning a world medal on vault as recently as 2011 (a silver) and just barely missing out on a bronze in 2018. In 2016, she attempted the incredibly difficult Produnova vault in the vault finals, which, while she fell on the landing, was probably among the best attempts since Produnova herself<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>. And now consider that the vault apparatus has changed significantly since she began competing; she learned to vault on a completely different apparatus, and managed to adapt to the current apparatus well enough to win multiple major international medals on it.
-   Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina gave birth in 2017 and returned to training shortly thereafter, with hopes of making the Tokyo Olympics. She struggled to get into shape in time to be competitive for a spot on the team in 2020, but with the Olympics now being pushed back a year due to the coronavirus, many fans feel she may have a realistic shot to make the Games. Even if she doesn't, though, the fact remains that in 2019 she went to a major FIG-sanctioned all-around invitational in Birmingham and **won**, beating out world-class gymnasts like Riley McCusker of the United States and Ellie Downie of Great Britain — two years after **having a baby**. This girl is **badass**.
-   Forward Jessica McDonald is the only mom on the 2019 US Women’s World Cup champion squad. She’s also one of seven moms in the entire National Women's Soccer League.
-   Sharran Alexander is a morbidly obese single mom of three who took on Sumo Wrestling both to support her family and make it big in the ring so she could further the way for women to be involved in the sport. A Fat and Proud Acrofatic mother who has proudly supported her children and made herself known as the heaviest sportswoman in the world. She is very good at the sport, having won 6 gold medals.
