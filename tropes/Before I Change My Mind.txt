Before I Change My Mind: 
The hero has the villain captured, in his grasp, and there's no way the villain can escape the due justice that's coming to him. As soon as the police show up, the hero informs his foe, the villain's going off to jail and will get his just reward.

However, the villain responds by trying to convince the hero that he (the hero) _has_ to let him (the villain) go free. The reasons he'll give may vary, but most usually they'll involve the point that without the villain around to enforce his particular brand of evil, someone more brutal than he is will inevitably show up to fill the void and potentially make the status quo a whole lot worse than it is at current. Or, the villain might have a very good reason for doing what he's been doing, and will let the hero know as much. Or, if the villain goes to jail, the hero won't have much other purpose in life.

Cue the hero freeing the villain from his bonds and telling him to leave now "...before I change my mind."

Alternately, reverse the scenario: the villain has the hero in his grasp and is ready, willing and able to kill him, but the hero says or does something that somehow convinces the villain not to go through with it. Or maybe the villain _can't_ go through with it because Even Evil Has Standards, the hero has to live to serve a specific purpose, or the villain's existence will be utterly empty without the hero being there to oppose him.

As a result, the villain decides to free the hero and tells him to get lost "...before I change my mind."

What is being showcased here is an example of someone (however briefly) looking the other way or granting permission in some other manner, allowing someone else to do something they want to do, escape a particular situation, or otherwise fulfill a stated objective.

Aside from the examples listed above, the words may be used if the hero and villain had come to some kind of deal (whether on-screen or behind-the-scenes), and the villain says them to indicate that he _just_ managed to not go back on his word.

It also doesn't necessarily have to be between a hero and his villain; a Big Bad, for example, may allow an underling to pursue a course of action, but if the underling hesitates in leaving, the boss may advise him/her to get to it, citing the trope's name in the process.

Note that the exact words of the trope name don't necessarily have to be quoted in order to qualify. Alternate phrases may include "while I'm still in a good mood" or "while I'm still feeling charitable."

See also Can't Kill You, Still Need You and I Gave My Word, which are situations where this may be invoked. This might also happen because the hero/villain is a Slave to PR. An Enemy Mine situation may sometimes result in this, as well.
