A Cat in a Gang of Dogs: 
You have your standard Heroic Pet Story with a pack of friendly dogs; you may have a street-smart mongrel, a friendly Great Dane, a tough Bulldog, a half-blind clumsy Sheepdog, a spoiled Poodle... and a cat?

For some reason, in works of fiction featuring a cast of dogs, writers often include a cat as part of the team.

In those settings where Cats Are Mean, this is done to avoid implying that a race of pets is Always Chaotic Evil (and avoiding the risk of alienating cat-lovers among the viewing audience), turning said cat into the Token Enemy Minority. But in those settings where there's no Animal Jingoism and cats can be good or bad equally as often as the dogs, this is generally a way to show some "ethnic" variety and maintain a broader appeal for all animal lovers. As they often think they are superior, the cat is likely The Lancer of the team, representing the counterbalance to the canine leader.

If this was given Character Development, a cat will develop some puppy-like traits and act much closer to their dog friends. In Real Life, the puppy cat is a term describing it.

Contrast with Heroic Canines, Villainous Felines, Female Feline, Male Mutt and Cat/Dog Dichotomy. Often goes with Canines Primary, Felines Secondary.

A Cat in a Gang of Dogs Example in Anime & Manga

-   **Beastars**: Legosi and all of his roommates at Cherryton are different canine species, except for Miguno, who is a spotted hyena. Hyenas are not canids and are not even caniforms, they are feliforms, meaning that they are more related to cats than to dogs. It is unclear if this is a mistake by the author, or if he was put with canines because hyenas have more in more in common with canines than with other species despite not being related to them.

However, Buddha hasn't really gotten used to eating mice all the time and is seen eating regular dog food. It's subverted when Max and his friends are ready to leave the house of cats. A kitten marches behind them, wanting to join them on their adventure, but the other cats call her back to them.
-   **Dogs of the Drowned City** has Fuzz, a declawed Maine Coon cat who speaks dog language (in a You No Take Candle way).

Things go okay for a while, but then Shep's roommate Blaze accuses Fuzz of leading cats to steal the dogs' food, and Shep is pressured into letting the dogs chase Fuzz out. He does apologize and lets Fuzz back into the pack, though.
