Cast Full of Crazy: 
**Billy:** We're a special combat unit with the United States Marine corps, and we've been tracking some Libyan terrorists. In fact, I think we've got them trailed to a bagel shop around the corner.  
**Pawn Shop Clerk:** Gimme a break.  
**Billy:** Alright, we’re four escaped lunatics.  
**Pawn Shop Clerk:** This I believe.

Some characters are just psycho. Then, there are times when every character is. It may be because of a Freudian Excuse, it may be because they're horribly broken, Brainwashed and Crazy, going mad from the revelation, or any number of reasons, but one thing's for sure: None of this cast has all the eggs in their basket.

The types of crazy can range from harmless (Cloud Cuckoolander) to dangerous (Ax-Crazy) to somewhere in between (Broken Ace, Heroic BSoD). Some characters are better at hiding it than others.

A type of Dysfunction Junction. For obvious reasons, this trope goes hand in hand with Sanity Slippage and Break the Cutie. Compare Big, Screwed-Up Family. Often the Only Sane Man will be found in conjunction with this trope. He won't usually stay that way. Only Sane by Comparison is essentially, without an Only Sane Man in the cast, the least crazy and/or flawed character in a cast full of wackos is the most sane one by default.

Beware of using this trope, as there is a risk of alienating your audience, especially when _all_ characters, even The Hero, become morally iredeemable and crazy, suicidal and/or there's no sanity improvement over the course of the story, as no one is truly good in this setting.

## Examples:



---
Cast Full of Crazy Example in Anime & Manga

-   **The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You**. Case in point, this work has its own page for Dysfunction Junction.
-   **Area 88**. In the manga, Shin is clearly depressed over his involuntary servitude and later exhibits symptoms of PTSD after his release, which he soothes with alcohol. Mickey has untreated PTSD, which he veils with a friendly exterior. Sela is **not** coping with her father's death in a healthy manner. Hoover is wracked with survivor's guilt. Nguyen is a sociopathic soldier and a sadist. Saki has a death wish. Abdael becomes a drug addict to cope with the events of the story. Kanzaki is a sociopath who has never truly processed the trauma of his mother's suicide. Ryoko has an unhealthy obsession with Shin, which leads her to make irresponsible decisions.
-   **Attack on Titan**. Due to the massive amount of trauma seeing your family/friends/squadmates eaten by fifteen-foot-tall giants causes, many characters in the series have crippling cases of PTSD. Additionally, the implication of there being people who can transform into Titans causes squadmates to distrust each other. Add some Black-and-White Insanity and Ax-Crazy to these traits, and you get Eren Jäger, perfectly willing to slaughter every Titan with absolutely no remorse no matter how highly he thought of their human forms or how much of a Tragic Villain they are.
-   In **Brave10**, this trope really comes to the fore with the addition of Kamanosuke and Seikai to The Team, but every Brave has their moments of crazy in service of comedy.
-   **Future Diary**. So God is dying and wants twelve people to fight to the death in order to see who will be his replacement. Who better to choose than possibly the twelve craziest people on planet Earth? Even our hero Yuki isn't immune. After both his parents are murdered, one right in front of him, he snaps and proceeds to turn from a Shrinking Violet into a full-blown, line-crossing Villain Protagonist. It can be argued that only those without Diaries are safe from the madness, but even the mental condition of Nishijima, Akise, and Yukiteru's three "friends" is up for debate.
-   **Kakegurui**: Other than Ryouta Suzui, who seems to be the one sane person at school, the entire cast is filled with lunatics who bet hundreds of thousands of dollars, and even the freedom of themselves and others, on cards, roulette, and even **children's games** that have even lower odds of actual success under normal circumstances. Other than Suzui, the rest of the cast also break into contorted Nightmare Faces when gambling, with The Protagonist, Yumeko Jabami, being **the worst**.
-   **Neon Genesis Evangelion** is probably a Trope Codifier. All the cast are broken in various ways, and their crazy ultimately ends up causing the end of the world. It's also notable for showing exactly what kind of horrific trauma the characters would have to go through to get to this stage.
-   **PandoraHearts**: It has an insane Jigsaw Puzzle Plot that follows Morality Kitchen Sink and has a Dysfunction Junction as a cast. It's also based on **Alice's Adventures in Wonderland**. There's Oz, Gilbert, Alice, Break, Vincent, Leo, and Echo. By the way, those are only a few of the main characters.
-   **Ranma ½**: Starting off, about half the cast has curses that change them into different creatures. That aside, just about every character has one or more character flaws that are exaggerated to the point they ought to be committed.
-   The Ikeda Lab in **Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it** consists of two Spocks who spend more time conducting fruitless experiments to try to find out What Is This Thing You Call "Love"? than actually doing their work, a Casanova Wannabe Butt-Monkey who is obsessed with characters from dating sims and anime, a perverted gaming addict who is continually winding up the others, and a professor who appears saintly at first glance but flip-flops between indulging his subordinates' whims and being incredibly quick to anger with them, with one Only Sane Woman to call all the ridiculousness out. And even she is prone to turning into an incredibly bitter person who will rant about her nonexistent love life at the slightest provocation when drunk. It doesn't just apply to the current residents of the lab, either—the only alumnus seen is someone who will happily instigate conflicts within her friend group in order to get more research material for her manga.
-   **Thou Shalt Not Die**: In this manga, if someone isn't horribly screwed up in the head in some way, chances are they will be dead soon. Among those that survive, the guy that can be at the closest called sane is Mizukaki. The main character Kuroi is a nasty Yandere who will kill at the slightest provocation. Asagi, a forgetful misanthrope. Yanagi, a Sadist and murderer. And then there is Mashiro. Even though she appears to be the sanest person in the cast, there is a lot of implication that she is the worst by far.

Cast Full of Crazy Example in Comic Books

-   **Batman**: Madness is a recurring theme, as all of Batman's rogues gallery is portrayed as mentally ill in some way or other (with Arkham Asylum serving as the resident Cardboard Prison) and the man himself has varying issues (mainly stemming from the murder of his parents) Depending on the Writer.
-   A French comic titled **Seven Psychopaths** employs 7... well, people with various mental diseases sent to kill Hitler (a paranoid man to get them in, a depressive sniper, a disguise expert with no personality, a berserk mercenary, etc.). They end up killing Hitler... but the disguise guy (who went as Adolf) ends up being used by the German high command to sign papers and agree with the generals, since they keep running out of body doubles (the original Adolf was killed in a 1942 bombing).
-   **Spider-Man**: Spider-Man’s rogues gallery is stuffed with crazy people, most notably Norman Osborn/the Green Goblin. Other notable highlights include the Lizard, Carnage, the Hobgoblin, and Doctor Octapus.
-   **Watchmen**: If the heroes aren't outright crazy, then they clearly deep emotional issues that they have trouble dealing with, with the suggestion that for some of them at least, use violence as an outlet for those issues. Two of the members are so detached that they can vapourise people without blinking or calmly discuss how an unprecedented scale of mass murder was committed by his hands just the half hour before to his colleagues. It gets somewhat amusing when two of the cast remark that everyone seems to be crazy but them. Both happen to be well-known Sociopathic Heroes.

Cast Full of Crazy Example in Fan Works

-   **Bird** features this as an aspect of the setting. Due to it taking place in Alchemilla Memorial Asylum- a sanitarium for parahumans - and over a third of the characters being patients there, the trope is justified. Also zig-zagged in the sense that not all of the patients are actually insane, Alchemilla is used to contain parahumans that cannot use their powers freely, or who have no control of their powers.
-   **Brainbent**, as a logical result of being set in a mental health clinic.
-   **Christian Weston Chandler in Survivor: Kujira-Jima**'s cast is mainly composed of stereotypes, subverted stereotypes, stock characters and Chris-chan, and they're all being played off of each other.
-   **Fantasy of Utter Ridiculousness**: Between Marisa's kleptomania and desire to ride Megas, the chronically ill and traumatized Patchouli chucking Gensokyo's primary incident resolver at said mech, Reimu herself **being okay with it**, and Coop and Jamie's near-total obliviousness towards the damage they're causing to Gensokyo just by being themselves, this is Reisen's opinion of the entire situation during the Extra Stage. That's without getting into the antics of those who are present during the conflict but have no bearing on its outcome.
-   Pretty much everyone in **With Pearl and Ruby Glowing** suffers from PTSD or similar issues, since the story is set in a rape survivors' support group. Many characters have other issues on top of that, such as several having Cluster B disorders of various types, Eliza's ability to talk to animals being replaced with childhood schizophrenia which makes her hallucinate animals talking, and Julian having suffered Gas Lighting until he believes he actually did commit the murders he was framed for and refuses to believe Anneliese and Erika are really alive.

Cast Full of Crazy Example in Films — Live-Action

-   **The Crazy Family**: Well... the family.
-   Nobody from **Escape from New York** could be called completely sane. Crazed terrorists hijack Air Force One, crashing it into Manhattan, which has been converted into a huge walled prison housing America's worst criminals. The Justice Department sends a convicted felon with a time-bomb motivator into Manhattan to rescue the President. There, The Hero encounters the Big Bad Duke of New York, and his army of crazed sociopaths. The lunacy is contagious, as the President seizes a firearm and has a Kick the Dog moment during his rescue.
-   **House of 1000 Corpses**, and especially it's sequels, where the focus shifts to its Laughably Evil Villain Protagonist ensemble, are filled with the dangerous killer kind.
-   **The Thin Man**: Although protagonists Nick and Nora are relatively normal, practically every possible suspect in the Wynant case is some kind of weirdo. Mimi is a gold-digging Evil Stepmother master of Implausible Deniability, Gilbert is a No Social Skills Nightmare Fetishist Cloud Cuckoo Lander, Morelli is an Anti-Villain crook with a Hair-Trigger Temper, Nunheim is a nervous informant who suffers Blackmail Backfire, his (quickly ex) girlfriend is a violent loudmouth, and Jorgenson is a near-silent Lazy Husband with a checkered past who it turns out never bothered to divorce his first wife. Dorothy Wynatt, her Love Interest Tommy, and the family lawyer MacCaulay are the only truly sane ones of the bunch, but then Dorothy suffers Sanity Slippage when she finds out her father might be a murderer and MacCaulay turns out to **be** the murderer! The film lampshades all the insanity when Nora speaks to a waiter at the Summation Gathering dinner party.
-   The Sam Raimi **Spider-Man Trilogy** features a wide assortment of nutjobs from Spider-Man’s rogues gallery, including the Green Goblin, Doc Ock (who in this continuity is not acting entirely out of his own free will) and Harry Osborn. This carries over to the characters’ appearances in **Spider-Man: No Way Home**.

Cast Full of Crazy Example in Literature

-   **Alice's Adventures in Wonderland**. The fact that the entire book is one of the Trope Codifiers for the Surrealism Genre and reads like the autobiographical account of an acid trip should clue you in that no one, not even the eponymous Alice, is safe from this trope. Its sequel, **Through the Looking-Glass**, also suffers heavily from this trope, even more so than its predecessor.
-   **Baccano!**: **Every single named character** is messed up in one or more ways. Some are broken, but most are just freakin' nuts. Of course, this being 1920s New York, the characters are perfectly suited for the Mafia. The award for most insane would probably go to Ladd Russo. Everyone else who decides to shoot up the Flying Pussyfoot has their own reasons for doing so, but he just does it For the Lulz. It really speaks volumes when even the sanest character in your series is an orphaned, Mafia-raised assassin who killed a man at the age of 18 and **felt good** doing it.
-   **Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts**: Poor, poor Yuuji Sakamoto. The people he deals with on a daily basis include a giant idiot, a violent Tsundere who has openly stated that beating up the idiot is her hobby, a girl who looks sweet and kind on the outside but hides her terrifying true self, a boy with serious gender issues, and a pervert who has done everything short of outright sexual assault to the girls. Then there's the psycho who's continually stalking and attacking him in order to fulfill their Childhood Marriage Promise. With friends like these, it's a wonder how he keeps his cool all the time.
-   By the same author as **Baccano!**, **Durarara!!** also falls victim to this trope. Probably no one in the story is 100 percent sane, even Mikado. Especially Mikado. In no particular order, the three sanest characters in the series are the kid who founded the Yellow Scarves in middle school, the guy in the bartender suit with the Hair-Trigger Temper who has a tendency for throwing street signs and vending machines, and the Dullahan **looking for her lost head**. Unlike in **Baccano!**, many characters are better about hiding their true nature.
-   The only completely sane characters in **The Locked Tomb** both died in the first part of the first book. The two protagonists are Harrow, a Haunted Heroine with schizophrenia and self-loathing so severe that she attempted suicide at the age of **nine** before falling in love with the dead body of The Antichrist, and a Sad Clown, Gideon, who grew up hated by everyone and has a complicated hate-love relationship with Harrow that only gets more complicated and traumatic as the series goes on. Then you get the Lyctors who have 10,000 years of compounding trauma, Coronabeth and Ianthe's borderline incestuous resentment and dependency on each other, God's whole deal, and for everyone else, the endless and pointless war grinding all of humanity down for millennia. Even the most well-adjusted characters like Palamedes and Camilla are codependent to an unhealthy degree. The only heroine who is somewhat happy (if somewhat prone to tantrums, and Secretly Dying) is Nona, because she's the only splinter of sanity and joy left in Alecto.
-   Edgar Allan Poe's short story **The Method of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether** takes place in an insane asylum, with the narrator being a visitor who is either insane himself or too absurdly credulous to realize that the inmates have taken over and are impersonating the doctors.
-   George R. R. Martin's **A Song of Ice and Fire** has a large cast suffering from mental issues: the worst examples are Ramsay Bolton, an evil psychopath, Gregor Clegane, a bloodthirsty rapist and child-killer giant, and Joffrey Baratheon, who was introduced as an annoying Jerkass and then flanderized as The Caligula. Not to mention Aerys II, who is mainly known as "The Mad King". Justified in a few cases because of incestous relationships, for the odds of giving birth mentally-unstable children dramatically rise with each generation. Milder examples are Cersei Lannister, a selfish narcissist, Lord Baelish, a manipulative sociopath, and Theon Greyjoy after his torture by the hand of Ramsay. In his case, not differently from how Smeagol and Gollum coexisted together in a single body, he is forced to split his personality between the old repressed Theon and the submissive haggard Reek.
-   A common theory about **Winnie-the-Pooh** is that each major character suffers from and represents a different mental disorder, such as Eeyore's clinical depression or Piglet's generalized anxiety disorder.

Cast Full of Crazy Example in Live-Action TV

-   **Everybody Loves Raymond**, in which every cast member might take a turn at being the Only Sane Man, if only to contrast the unbalanced personalities of all the others. We get:
    -   Raymond Barone - Manchild.
    -   Robert Barone - self-pitying depressive, The Eeyore.
    -   Frank Barone - multiple complexes, The Napoleon.
    -   Marie Barone - passive-agressive manipulator, control freak, "Jewish Mother".
    -   Debra Barone - usually the Only Sane Man, though known to lash out in frustration
    -   Amy McDougall - Extreme Doormat - but only up to a point.
    -   Peter McDougall - Manchild, Basement-Dweller, The Thing That Would Not Leave.
    -   Gianni - Kavorka Man.
    -   Hank McDougall - religious freak.
-   The cast of **The Muppet Show** is eccentric, to say the least. Even Kermit, the Only Sane Man (er, frog), is Not So Above It All; as he once points out, he's the one who **hired** the others.
-   'Experimental' soap **Night and Day** does away with all pretensions of sanity in its characters. Evil ‘Aunt Rachel’ Culgrin is perhaps the most outlandish, but sociopathic snarker Ryan Harper also deserves an honourable mention. Towards the end of the run, Frankie Radcliffe and Kate Ellis lose the plot with their book-burning Virgin Army – but in truth, most other characters also display considerable crazy at one time or another.

---
Cast Full of Crazy Example in Tabletop Games

-   **Warhammer 40,000**: Strangely enough, every faction is this to at least one other.
    -   The orks are an entire race of war-loving maniacs who will happily charge into melee firing hopelessly inaccurate guns.
    -   Chaos has a very strong tendency to warp the minds of those who follow it, and sometimes deliberately sabotage their allies' plans (even if it costs them the victory) because the voices told them to (and sometimes because it would empower said allies' god at the expense of the traitor's).
    -   The Tau are viewed with suspicion by humanity, as they lack the "defend to the very end" mentality that's been drilled into them for millenia. Conversely, the Tau view the humans as completely insane for fighting to the death over a worthless rock instead of retreating to save lives and resources.
    -   Imperials are seen as willfully blind fools by Eldar and Chaos, worshipping a god who was never one in the first place and clinging to traditions that cause them more harm than enemy actions.
    -   Craftworld Eldar and their evil(er) cousins the Dark Eldar were split when the Eldar Empire succeeded in birthing a new Chaos god(dess) of excess and hedonism, with the latter now having to cause (and receive) pain to survive lest their souls be eaten by Slaanesh, and the former being a dying race unable to bear the weight of their hubris.
    -   "Only the insane have strength enough to prosper. Only those who prosper may truly judge what is sane."

Cast Full of Crazy Example in Theatre

-   **King Lear** is a deconstruction. Lear himself has Gone Mad From The Revelation of his daughters' betrayal (until he grabs the Sanity Ball in Act V); Egdar is in disguise as a mad peasant, spouting Word Salad Philosophy and paranoia-fueled ramblings; and the Fool was ambiguously sane to begin with and isn't helping matters. Kent, meanwhile, is also in disguise and usually imitating a ridiculous accent. Hilarity Ensues for much of Act III.

Cast Full of Crazy Example in Video Games

-   It seems like the eponymous Ink Machine of **Bendy and the Ink Machine** — or perhaps just studio conditions in general — have driven most named employees of Joey Drew Studios insane.
    -   Sammy Lawrence eventually turned to worshiping Bendy.
    -   Susie Campbell began identifying with Alice Angel to the point she called "herself" an "angel". It got to the point where she agreed to take part in Joey Drew's experiments to bring his cartoon characters to life and ended up becoming a physical version of Alice Angel and died during the process.
    -   Norman Polk ended up sticking a projector on his head and turning into an ink monster.
    -   Grant Cohen was driven utterly mad by the company's money problems, up to turning his office into a Room Full of Crazy.
    -   Bertrum Piedmont grew so obsessed with making sure people recognized his work that he was corrupted by the ink and had his head implanted into a merry-go round.
    -   It's uncertain what happened to Wally Franks, but in a Twitter AMA, it's been implied that his mind is "waaaay outta here". Chapter 5 reveals he took off to Florida. Which still counts, if you think about it.
    -   Joey Drew himself seems to be the first (or among the first) to lose his mind; in an old recording, Wally Franks complains about Joey's attempts to "appease the gods" and then comments that he thinks he's lost his mind. In the epilogue, it's shown that Joey has changed his ways over the past 30 years and is no longer the crazy, power-hungry, and money-grubbing Bad Boss he was when running the studio, even asking Henry for help **in person** to destroy the Ink Demon (AKA a failed attempt at creating Bendy).
-   **Borderlands**: **Holy shit**. Almost everyone you meet on Pandora is a psycho to some extent ,due to a combination of the Destroyer sending out mental broadcasts to lure people to the vault, driving many insane in the process, Eridium causing brain poisoning in the second game, and the sheer stress of living in a Death World, especially after the Dahl corporation (which first colonized the planet) abandoned most of the colonists with barely enough resources just to survive. Calling Pandora a fucked up place would be an understatement.
-   **Die Anstalt** is an Adventure Game whose main characters are patients in the eponymous asylum, each suffering from a different trauma or disorder.
-   In **Don't Starve** many characters seem to have had mental issues from even before the events of the game (Willow I'm Looking At You). Also, insanity is a game mechanic, so even those who would normally be the only sane men will end up qualifying at some point.
-   The party of **Drakengard** is made up of a sociopathic Blood Knight, a human-hating dragon, a Yandere bard, an elven Child Eater, a Pedophile Priest, and a six-year-old boy who kills his own sister in one route. Also, the Messianic Barrier Maiden they're trying to save has incestuous feelings for her brother. A Let's Player explains:
    
    **The Dark Id:** Welp. It looks like nobody in this game is making it to the end without some deep irredeemable aspect to their character. Before you say there's still Seere, no. The kid is fucked up too. We've just yet to see it.
    
-   **Mass Effect 2**: The crew Shepard puts together comprises of everything from a genetically engineered Broken Ace to a girl who was stolen as an infant and conditioned to be an Ax-Crazy killer to a genetically engineered teenage Krogan who is also Ax-Crazy to an alien girl who can't leave her suit without risking serious illness. The last is probably the most normal out of any of them.
-   **Outlast**. Aside from the protagonist, every character met is some form of raving lunatic. At the end, the protagonist becomes part of the crazy when he gets possessed by the Walrider .
-   This describes nearly everyone in **Psychonauts**. Ranging from mild neurosis to full-blown psychosis, everyone has issues. A good part of the game is spent trying to cure some of them.
-   **Puyo Puyo**: Everyone in this cast is weird in their own way. You've got dancing fish (Suketoudara), flamboyant fashionista skeletons (Dapper Bones), lovestruck fighters (Rulue), and the list goes on. Not even the main characters are exempt from weirdness. Arle may be the snarky Straight Man to everyone's Wise Guy, but she's not above being playful or a complete screwball in print media.
-   **SINoALICE**: Every single Character in Library is bloodthirsty to the extent that they'll kill each other for their own selfish desires, and more than a few of them display violent mental instability. Makes sense, considering that one ending reveals that they were all made up by an extremely troubled young girl.
-   Another example from BioWare; the player parties in **Star Wars: The Old Republic** can certainly fall here, especially on the Imperial side. The Agent's party (probably the weirdest of the lot) has a bomb-throwing anarchist, a diplomat who went native with an insect species, a brilliant operative-scientist who experimented on himself with rakghoul DNA, and can transform into one, a human who was raised among the Chiss (because she's a low-level Force Sensitive and would have been killed by the Sith otherwise), and a sociopath gynoid who openly dislikes organics and was built by a race of Precursors.
-   **Team Fortress 2**: The Heavy speaks to his sandwich and has a little bed for his minigun next to his own, the Medic has a love of mad science, the Demoman is a drunken workaholic, the Soldier is a delusional warmonger who insists he's the greatest despite having been rejected from every branch of the military, the Sniper has a bit of cold sociopathy to him (and fights with a jar of his own pee), the Spy acts like he's classy but childlishly mocks his opponents, the Scout shows extreme narcissism and bragging from kills, and the Pyro... dear god, the Pyro. The closest member of the team to sane is the Engineer, who's friendly but still shows some signs of sociopathy and paranoia beneath his kindly demeanor.
-   The only explanation for the gleeful Vehicular Combat carnage in **Twisted Metal** is that all of the cars' drivers are really messed up. Special points for insanity go to the Monster Clown who drives a **burning ice cream truck**. **Black** even has a cast mostly composed of inmates from an insane asylum.

Cast Full of Crazy Example in Visual Novels

-   Practically every single potential "boyfriend" in **Boyfriend To Death** has several psychological issues and zero qualms about inflicting a brutal death to their captive.
-   Played With in **Higurashi: When They Cry**. Not all of the main characters are crazy at the same time, but they each get to take their turn at it due to the Hate Plague nature of the "Groundhog Day" Loop the characters are stuck in. And when they're insane, **they're insane**. Even Keiichi, who under different circumstances would be a dating sim protagonist, cannot escape the permeating madness. In Tatarigoroshi-hen, his Big Brother Instinct toward Satoko, leads him down the crazy trail, ultimately culminating with him beating Satoko's abusive uncle to death with a baseball bat. While it might be argued that he was in his right mind all along and had just been pushed too far, his incessant reaffirming that he's doing it for Satoko, the fact that Keiichi in the previous two arcs only ever killed in self-defense and was not shown to be the type of person that could murder in cold blood, especially someone he hardly knew, and his choice of method for "saving" Satoko, which arguably leaves her in a worse situation than before, point him solidly to the insane corner. Keiichi himself comments that no sane individual would have tried to save her like that in Minagoroshi-hen, however, he does admit that murder was his initial plan before Shion triggered a flashback to the above arc.
    -   Heck, in the PS ports, there's actually an arc where everyone who can go crazy does at the same time. In Tsukiotoshi-hen, Satoko suffers from Hinamizawa Syndrome due to her uncle's abuse again, and this time, Keiichi, Rena, and Shion all try to kill him and all come down with Hinamizawa Syndrome as well, leading to paranoia ricocheting against more paranoia. The result was billed as the worst possible ending.

Cast Full of Crazy Example in Webcomics

-   **Girl Genius**, being about a world run by Mad Science, is unsurprisingly full of mad scientists.
-   Where do we start with **Lackadaisy**? Rocky was manic and reckless from the start, and his head injury in volume 2 has only exacerbated his mental instability. Freckle succumbs to murderous rage in dangerous situations. Mordecai is a sociopath who is devoid of warmth, empathy, or mercy. Serafine is another sociopath with a sadistic streak, and if she truly believes in Maitre Carrefour, is living in a fantasy world. Her brother Nico isn't much better. Wick is an insomniac who works too hard, drinks too much, and is haunted by the ghost of a dead duck. Mitzi is so obsessed with keeping Lackadaisy going that she verges on The Unfettered.
-   The sex comedy webcomic **Ménage à 3** has a cast full of characters with various anxieties, dysfunctions and obsessions. The main three characters are an Extreme Doormat nerd with serious self-esteem issues, a bisexual Yaoi Fangirl who would go for any gender, and a Dumb Blonde with an unspecified mental disorder and the inability to get an orgasm, and they are just the tip of the iceberg. Even the sanest characters will be caught in crazy sexual hijinks from time to time.
-   Everybody in **Narbonic** is nuts, from the crazed intern, to the hyperintelligent gerbil, to the mad scientist who hires Dave in the first place. It turns out that Dave is a nascent mad scientist during the whole thing, so he's not an exception after all. The same goes for **Skin Horse**, where the Only Sane Man is a Canadian bio-engineered war canine, and even she's not all there.
-   **Schlock Mercenary**: Every member of Tagon's Toughs really, really likes violence and big guns and/or explosions. When Petey tells Schlock he's trying to put a bunch of dangerous sociopaths out of commission, Schlock's response is to power up his plasma cannon and ask where they are.

Cast Full of Crazy Example in Web Original

-   Borderline every abridging parody makes every character insane to some extent.
-   **DSBT InsaniT**: This is where the series gets its name, after all. With the Only Sane Man Koden stuck right in the middle of all of the insanity.
-   **Filthy Frank**: The Only Sane Man commits all sorts of disgusting acts, kills baby animals and weeaboos for fun, and once locked a man in isolation because...he asked him to check out his mixtape. Despite this, he's the **good** guy.
-   Almost everybody in **Gossip City** is a Cloud Cuckoo Lander to some degree and half of the series' runtime is spent on the cast's random antics.
-   **Nobody** in **Satellite City** could even remotely be described as normal, and this is **before** you take into account the fact that (except for Sullivan) they're all a bunch of ageless bestial demon-things fleeing a dead universe.Lucy is a bloodthirsty Psycho Lesbian who likes tormenting, dismembering, and killing other creatures for fun. Shuck is an abrasive troll who's been heavily implied to have a violent past stretching back to the 16th century that straddles the line between Sociopathic Soldier and spree murder. Ludwig is The Social Darwinist who believes that all humans are disgusting "simians." Hyzenthlay is Ludwig's favorite lab experiment, an exceptionally naive and innocent Uplifted Animal whose sanity isn't helped by Lucy constantly trying to kill and eat her. Winifred's mind has been more-or-less shattered and is both mute and blind, and prone to habitually clawing herself, on top of **literally** being The Chew Toy for Lucy. Their human host Sullivan kills people just to obtain Halloween pumpkins without paying. Fleischer is the closest thing to a normal, well-adjusted person in the cast, and even he's constantly struggling to keep Winifred, Shuck, and Lucy from causing harm to the others (or in Winifred's case, to herself), not to mention taking games of chess FAR too seriously.

Cast Full of Crazy Example in Western Animation

-   **Archer**: Just about the entire top tier of ISIS personnel is borderline insane, and in Kreiger's case, almost certainly well past it. Him aside, almost all of them are sociopathic hedonists who seem incapable of thinking of anything other than drink or sex long enough to actually accomplish their missions.
-   **Family Guy**: In the later seasons, it becomes apparent that everyone in Quahog all clearly have some major issues going on. This is played for laughs.
-   **The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy**. The Only Sane Man is The Grim Reaper. That really says it all.
-   You could probably count the number of perfectly sane **Looney Tunes** characters in one hand, and even those are easily prone to Sanity Slippage now and again. The title should give it away.
-   Every single character on **Kaeloo** is unstable and unhinged, and it's stated in-universe that the four main characters are all in need of serious therapy for their issues.
