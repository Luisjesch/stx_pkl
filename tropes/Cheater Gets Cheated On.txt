Cheater Gets Cheated On: 
When it comes to relationships, almost no one likes being cheated on. Even people who cheat themselves can't take being cheated on. Whether the cheating is a casual fling or a lover-stealer, people who have affairs usually won't take it well when they experience being cheated on themselves.

The reasons for this can vary; people who believe in some kind of Double Standards in regards to cheating believe that it's okay for some groups of people (always a group the person holding the Double Standard belongs to) to cheat but not others. Cheaters with a high opinion of themselves might see themselves as too good to be cheated on because they are beautiful, rich, an alpha male, etc. so the idea that someone would cheat on them hurts their pride. Short-sighted people might fail to take into account that someone who was unfaithful to their previous partner would be unfaithful to them as well. A cheater who assumed that their affair partner was genuinely in love with them might be surprised to learn that someone who was willing to engage in a relationship based on deception would lie about being in love with them.

If called out on their hypocrisy, the cheaters will either try to explain why it's okay for them to cheat but why their partner can't or act flabbergasted that their cheating partner would be unfaithful to them as well. Sometimes, when the cheater's original partner learns that they had an affair, the partner in question would have their own affair, mainly to spite said cheater, realizing that the cheater might not love them and/or think the cheater won't care if they cheat too.

Sub-Trope of Sexual Karma. Often overlaps with Moral Myopia. Compare Open Relationship Failure, which can involve similar circumstances. A Sympathetic Adulterer might inflict this on their cheating partner. Overlaps with A Taste of Their Own Medicine if a person cheats on their partner as revenge for being cheated on or Original Position Fallacy when someone involved in an affair is surprised when their affair partner cheats on them. See also Good Adultery, Bad Adultery, for when cheating is given different moral judgments depending on circumstances.

-   _Synépeies - A Collection Of NTR Consequences_:
    -   Some chapters deconstruct the relationship between the cheating women and the antagonist of a netorare story by having the cheating women learn the hard way that a guy who would steal another man's girlfriend/wife from him would likely have no qualms about cheating on his own girlfriend/wife as well.
        -   _Withered Hydrangea_ has Natsuha, who cheated on her boyfriend Yuuta with a bad boy named Masaru, finding a group of delinquents beating Masaru. The reason is that he slept with _their_ girlfriends too.

-   _Go_: Played with. Zack and Adam have a tense conversation that implies Adam is having an affair with Zack's significant other, and that Zack knows about it. Later it's revealed that a) the two of them are gay and in a secret relationship, b) they've been cheating on each other, and c) they've both been cheating with _the same man._ They decide to blame the whole thing on him and end up giving him a forced haircut in revenge.
-   The plot of _In the Mood for Love_ centers around this idea. The leads are two neighbors who find out their respective spouses are having an affair with one another. The leads form a bond over this shared betrayal. They teeter around the edge of the question Will They or Won't They? have their own affair. The closest they get is a Bait-and-Switch scene where it looks like they're beginning one — but actually they're LARPing as their spouses, trying to imagine how _that_ affair began. They start developing feelings for each other, but ultimately they don't get together. It could be considered either Subverted or Zigzagging, as what they _do_ share has sometimes been termed an "emotional affair" or "unconsummated affair." The leads don't conceptualize it as such, though.

-   _Till Death_: Emma's abusive husband Mark constructs a sadistic revenge plot after learning that she had an affair with his employee Tom. However, later it's revealed that Mark would often cheat on Emma when she complains about repeatedly having to wash lipstick and glitter out of his shirts.
-   This occurs in the 1925 German silent film _Variety_. In Hamburg, a trapeze artist leaves his wife for a younger woman. He and his mistress then move to Berlin, where they form a trapeze act with a second man. The mistress then starts having an affair with said second man, causing the original man to become angry and jealous. Incidentally, when the film came to America in 1926, it was bowdlerized to remove this trope, with the first reel cut so that the main character's mistress appears to be his wife.

When he learns of the affair in chapter 7, Tom gets upset over Daisy cheating on him and gets into a heated argument with Gatsby over it.
-   _How NOT to Write a Novel_ encourages this if you're going to have the protagonist cheat on their significant other with someone else. If a writer doesn't do this, they run the risk of the significant other looking Unintentionally Sympathetic. The writer has to make sure the significant other is clearly worse than the protagonist, and having them cheat first is a good way to establish how awful they are.
-   _Parker Pyne_: Downplayed in an early story where a wife discovers her husband is starting to spend money on his secretary, taking her to restaurants, dancing, etc. though it hasn't escalated to actual sexual cheating. She consults Parker Pyne who concocts an Operation: Jealousy to restore the marriage, more out of a pragmatic measure than any actual loss of love (when she sees the two of them together, she feels pity for how ridiculous he looks and how bored the secretary looks).
-   Explored in _Thinks_ by David Lodge. Ralph Messenger is a serial philanderer, and he and his wife Carrie have a tacit agreement that he only has other women when he is away from home, which happens frequently. However, soon after he has broken this rule and had an affair with a woman nearby, he discovers that Carrie has been having an affair with a man whom he dislikes, and is furious. He decides not to confront Carrie because he knows she would confront him about his own affairs. This comes soon after he has explained the strategy of "co-operate or defect", in which you cooperate with somebody until they defect, then you defect. He notes that Carrie defected, knowing that he had defected.
-   _The Other Boleyn Girl_ has Anne Boleyn having an emotional affair with Henry VIII for several years while he works to divorce his first wife, Katherine of Aragon; Anne deliberately makes sure the affair doesn't get physical until she's absolutely certain that Henry will marry her. Once Anne is queen and pregnant with Henry's child, she's in for a nasty shock; she made the age-old error of believing the man who'd kept several mistresses throughout his first marriage would _naturally_ remain faithful during his second one, and is enraged when Henry begins to get up to his old tricks with the ladies of her chamber. Even worse, as Henry starts to tire of Anne when she first gives birth to a daughter and then keeps miscarrying, he starts carrying on _another_ emotional affair with Jane Seymour who is clearly being positioned to usurp Anne.

It fails miserably because, unlike Ted and Skyler, there was never even the slightest hint of sexual tension between the two, and he is fired for trying it.

Despite his previous cheating, he is furious at Carole, both tearing her a new one and walking out of her life for good without even giving Carole a hint as to why he's so mad at her. In fairness, the fact that Brittas also gives Derrick the belief that Carole performs Malicious Slander doesn't help.
    -   During the events of the series, Helen cheats regularly on Brittas. However, "Surviving Christmas" has her mistakenly believe that Brittas is cheating on her with Carole. She doesn't take it well, spending the episode trying to murder Carole and only calming down when Brittas sets the record straight.

-   Rupert Holmes: "Escape (The Pina Colada Song)" has an interesting variant. The narrator says he'd gotten tired of his "old lady", and that they'd fallen into a dull routine. He spots an ad in the personal columns, which he finds to be quite interesting and captivating, and writes a reply asking to meet at a bar called O'Malley's. Upon arriving there, he discovers that the person who wrote the personal ad was, in fact, his "old lady". Rather than either becoming incensed that their partner was planning to cheat on them, they realize that there's much more to each other than they had thought, and decide to spend more time together, learning about the things they hadn't known before.
-   At the end of the Stevie Wonder song "Part-Time Lover", in which the singer describes the steps he and his lover need to take to stop his partner from finding out, he notes some strange events that suggest his partner is taking similar precautions. Unlike most examples, he's philosophical about this, just noting "I guess two can play the game of part-time lovers".
-   In TLC's "Creep", the singer still loves her man despite knowing she's being cheated on. So she cheats on him behind his back as passive-aggressive revenge to get the affection he's not giving her.

    Theatre 

-   _A Little Night Music_: Practically the entire cast is guilty. Carl-Magnus makes almost no secret of cheating on his wife Charlotte with Desiree, but when he finds Desiree in a compromising situation with Frederik, he is furious at the idea that she would be unfaithful to him, as is he when Charlotte kisses Frederik in an attempt to make him jealous.

-   In _Don Carlo_, Philip is outraged to learn that his wife Elizabeth has cheated on him with his son Carlos (in fact, it's emotional adultery that both parties try to suppress, and they have barely met since Elizabeth's marriage), while he has cheated on her with Princess Eboli before. Eboli is the one who realizes the hypocrisy of the situation and confesses everything to Elizabeth (not to mention that she doesn't even love Philip either: she loves Carlos as well... things are seriously messed up in that opera).
-   In _Le Nozze Di Figaro_, Count Almaviva cheats on his wife left and right but grows ''livid'' when he suspects she might be unfaithful to him herself (every time in this play, it turns out to be either Operation: Jealousy or a misunderstanding, but in the sequel, she does cheat on him).

    Video Games 

-   _Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War_: This forms a major part of the game's backstory. Duke Victor of Velthomer was a serial cheater and worse. After he raped his wife's, Lady Cigyun, favorite maid in a drunken stupor and sent the maid away after finding out she was pregnant, Cigyun was so distraught that she ended up having an affair with Prince Kurth of Granvale. When Victor found out about this, he flipped his shit and killed himself after writing a scathing suicide note full of insults toward Cigyun and Kurth. The whole fiasco was so traumatizing to Cigyun that she disappeared back to her hometown and was never seen again, leaving her and Victor's son with a massive Oedipus Complex. Cigyun died giving birth to the daughter she conceived from her affair with Kurth. This was a problem because Cigyun's line of descent carried minor Loptous blood, so they were forbidden from having more than one child in each generation in order to prevent any scenario where a child with major Loptous blood could be born. Since Cigyun's two children were of the opposite sex, her affair created the exact scenario her ancestors wanted to prevent with their one child rule, and the Loptous Cult was able to manipulate things so that Arvis and Deidre, not knowing their true relationship, would marry each other so that their shared minor Loptous blood would combine into a child with major Loptous blood, their son Julius.
-   In _Smite_, this is cited in the lore as a reason why Zeus regards Ares as The Unfavorite of his numerous children: he thinks his long-suffering wife Hera conceived Ares with another god behind his back, and decides to treat Ares poorly to punish Hera for it — despite this kind of behaviour being exactly the same way Hera normally treats all of _his_ illegitimate children — and, knowing Zeus, he has plenty of those. It should be noted that this example is a case of _SMITE'S_ developers taking artistic license with the myths — the original Zeus didn't hate Ares because he thought he was the progeny of one of Hera's revenge affairs, he hated him because he was a sadistic, cowardly Blood Knight, the same reason everybody else hated Ares.

        -   Beautiful/young women not understanding that a man who would leave his current wife/girlfriend for a prettier/younger woman would do the same thing to them when they get old or when an even prettier woman comes along or that their beauty/youth isn't enough to keep an unfaithful man from cheating.
