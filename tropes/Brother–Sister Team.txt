Brother–Sister Team: 
"Wonder Twin Powers, activate! Form of...TV Tropers!"

The convention in kids movies and TV shows to make the Kid Heroes a brother and sister. This way, both the sexes are represented and they can be very close, while any thought that they'll end up together is — at least theoretically — killed off immediately. These teams can also bicker a lot more than teams of friends usually do, like siblings in real life, and there's (usually) no need to worry that they might "break up".

A subtrope of Sibling Team. A pair of Half-Identical Twins is likely to be this. They may also be part of a Badass Family. A sister trope to Parent-Child Team.

## Examples:

Brother–Sister Team Example in Anime & Manga

-   **Black Lagoon**: Villainous (and then some) example: Hansel and Gretel, the "Vampire Twins". Also, good luck figuring out which one is which, or even if they are different genders.
-   **Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba**:
    -   Tanjiro is a demon slayer, and he and his demonic sister Nezuko work together to find a way to turn the latter back into a human.
    -   Daki and Gyutaro, the Upper Rank 6 demons, are the demon sibling duo who fight together in tandem and are essentially Tanjiro and Nezuko's Evil Counterparts. Although they tend to bicker a lot, they both genuinely care for each other, and when all chips come down, all they have is one another, and neither of them can be truly killed unless they both get their heads severed at the same time.
-   **Digimon Adventure**: Taichi/Tai and Hikari/Kari.
-   A villainous example in Androids 17 and 18 from **Dragon Ball Z**. Though they were Punch-Clock Villains at worst (at least in the main timeline) and end up pulling a Heel–Face Turn. Android 18 (who is actually a cyborg) even ends up marrying one of the main characters and having a daughter with him.
-   In **Fullmetal Alchemist**, the Armstrong siblings, Alex Louis and Olivier Mira.
-   In **Get Backers**, Juubei and Sakura Kakei are a borderline case: they're always on the same side (even when their "most important persons" aren't), but they're rarely seen actually **working** together. Himiko and Yamato are like this in flashbacks, but later revelations reveal that this is actually a more appropriate (and manga-only) description of Himiko and **Ban**.
-   Another semi-villainous example: Baki (big brother) and Minki (little sister) from **Hell Teacher Nube**. As soon as her brother is released from his metaphorical can, Minki recruits him to go on a destructive rampage around the city. He blows up a building, terrifies some housewives when he forgets to materialize pants in human form, and oooh that ice-cream looks yummy! Needless to say, Minki is not amused at this turn of events.
-   Tweedledee and Tweedledum in **Kiddy Grade**. Also fraternal twins.
-   Erio and Caro in **Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS**, though they're step-siblings.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> Flirty Stepsiblings. Which also makes them a Battle Couple.
-   **Naruto**:
    -   The Sand Siblings, consisting of a girl (Temari) and two boys (Gaara and Kankuro), who participate in the Chunin Exams as a team. They work really well; their team is the only one to advance together to the finals. Carried over to Part II, where Kankuro is a member in Gaara's Kage council while Temari is a diplomat. During the Kage Summit, the two serve as Gaara's bodyguards.
    -   In the Fourth Ninja World War, Kiba Inuzuka and his older sister, Hana, are grouped in the same division.
-   The protagonist of **No Game No Life** is " " (i.e., "Blank") which is the combination of Sora and Shiro. They are a brother-sister team that never loses when they play cooperatively. They're actually stepsiblings, but they're every bit as close a blood relatives.
-   Kiku and Ryuuji Takane from **Ring ni Kakero** are a somewhat more realistic version, with him as a promising boxer and her as The Strategist behind his success.
-   Shannon and Raquel Casull in **Scrapped Princess**. They are twins who work together to protect their younger sister, Pacifica. Shannon is a master swordsman while Raquel is a mage of such high talent she can pull off powerful spells with hardly an incantation.
-   Another villainous example: Sorath and Tyrael Aizen from **Shakugan no Shana**. However, this has nothing to do with preventing shipping, since they're all over each other. Ew. They would also double as a Battle Couple.
-   Redseb and Seyram Munzer of **Shaman King**. They entered the tournament together with their giant robot golem.
-   Ran from **Telepathy Shoujo Ran** gets a lot of support from her older brother Rin, who is a very capable Amateur Sleuth. She bickers mostly with fellow telepath Midori though.
-   Jin and Mikoto Ishino from **Tomica Hyper Rescue Drive Head Kidou Kyuukyuu Keisatsu**. The two of them share a Drive Head. In the 2018 web series, they each get their own machine, but the two still look near-identical, and they continue to work together.
-   **Triangle Heart 3: Sweet Songs Forever**: Kyouya and Miyuki Takamachi, though they are actually cousins.
-   Leo and Luna from **Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds**.

Brother–Sister Team Example in Comic Books

-   The DCU:
    -   Canon Immigrants Zan and Jayna of the Justice League of America are Wonder Twins (pictured above) whose powers are fueled by their sibling bond.
    -   Lightning Lad and Light(ning) Lass in **Legion of Super-Heroes** comic canon, depending on the continuity
    -   The Tornado Twins in Silver-Age DCU.
    -   Booster Gold and his sister Goldstar. More of a Badass Family since it was revealed that Rip Hunter is Booster's son à la Luke, I Am Your Father.
    -   A villainous case, Shimmer and Mamut of the Fearsome Five.
    -   Another villainous example: Captain Cold and Golden Glider of The Flash's Rogues.
    -   Tim Drake and Cassandra Cain after she gets adopted work together several times. They make a near-unbeatable team with Tim being The Smart Guy of the Batfamily and Cass being the pinnacle of what a non-meta fighter could achieve with her build and age.
    -   Helena and Damian Wayne—alias Huntress and Robin, alternate universe half-siblings and Batman's two biological children—seem okay with this dynamic after their initial meeting. They called each other "brother" and "sister," which is more than they've given their three adopted brothers and adopted sister.
    -   **Wonder Woman** Vol 1: Etta and Mint Candy have teamed up on occasion, once alongside WW to take down Nazi saboteurs in operation from southern Texas to Mexico City.
    -   Hercules tries so very hard to form a team with his half-sister Cassie Sandsmark, and while she does work with him very briefly her distrust in him is proven to not just be paranoia very quickly and she refuses to allow him or their father to try and dictate any more of her life.
    -   While the Marvel Family has more members than just Shazam and Mary Marvel, they operate together quite often, regardless of whether they are biological or adopted siblings (it varies from continuity to continuity).
-   **Jimmy Tornado**: Jimmy and his sister Lupé travel the world on adventures together.
-   Marvel Universe.
    -   The Invisible Woman and the Human Torch as a subset of the Fantastic Four.
        -   Also in the younger generation: Franklin and Valeria Richards in the mainstream continuity and the Thing's two kids in the MC-2 timeline.
    -   Northstar and Aurora as founding members of Alpha Flight.
    -   Fenris (Andrea and Andreas von Strucker) supplies a villainous example.
    -   Power Pack has two brothers and two sisters.
    -   Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, when they first appeared with the Brotherhood Of Evil Mutants, and occasionally since then. In the Ultimate Marvel universe, they worked in both the Brotherhood and The Ultimates.
    -   Spider-Girl and Darkdevil. Who are technically half-brother and sister. Or more like cousins. And they never really formed a permanent team. However, Mayday and her baby brother Benjy have the makings of becoming one in the future.
    -   In **Excalibur** Alistaire and Alysande Stuart, a military officer and a scientist working for the Weird Happenings Organisation.
    -   Captain Britain and Psylocke, although they did not team up that often.
    -   In **Avengers vs. X-Men**, Colossus and Magik team-up to curb-stomp Spider-Man.
-   Deconstructed in **Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers (Boom! Studios)** storyline **Beyond the Grid**. Thanks to the events of **Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: Shattered Grid**, the **In Space**\-era Andros is reunited with his sister Karone, who is in her post-**Lost Galaxy** incarnation. Circumstances cause Karone to lose her powers and force Andros to work with others, but when things go wrong, Andros starts calling for Karone. When the Solarix is stolen, the other remaining powered Rangers accuse Andros of being the thief because of his clinginess to Karone allowing Mike, the real thief, to deflect the blame.
-   In **Paperinik New Adventures**, while Ziggy left the PBI because he was tired of secrets, he still has his skills and occasionally works with his sister Mary-Ann, who is still an agent.
-   **Raptors**: Drago and Camilla are Half-Identical Twins who hunt down other vampires who have sworn off 'the old ways'. They also have some sort of telepathic link to each other.
-   Before **Suske en Wiske** became **Suske \[and\] Wiske**, it was **Rikki \[and\] Wiske**. Rikki is Wiske's older brother and a professional boxer, while Wiske, despite her age, can take on multiple grown men simply by being merciless. They formed a team for one comic, then Rikki was replaced by Suske, among other reasons so Wiske would have an equal instead of a protector.

-   **Light of the Moon**: Rapunzel and Varian, after spending six years being raised by Gothel as foster siblings, have become this.
-   Fate and Chrono work together in **Infinity** (which takes place several weeks after Fate was adopted). Or more accurately, Fate works under Chrono.
    
    **Chrono:** Agent, I should remind you that as your commanding officer, I do not appreciate your thinly veiled mirth at my confusion and demand to be treated with proper respect. And as your older brother, **stop that** or I'm telling mom.

---
Brother–Sister Team Example in Films — Live-Action

-   **Avengers: Age of Ultron**: Wanda, the Scarlet Witch, and Pietro, Quicksilver, are fraternal twins who make the Heel–Face Turn together, first fighting against and then with the Avengers.
-   Top Dollar and Myca in **The Crow** are a villainous variation of this. They're the closest members in Top Dollar's criminal syndicate, and she serves as his advisor on supernatural matters. Because they're villains, their relationship is openly incestuous.
-   **Cruel Intentions**: The manipulative Kathryn Merteuil and Sebastian Valmont are step-siblings — and yes, that particular loophole is milked for all it's worth.

-   **The Mighty One**, a wuxia film where the hero assumes he lost his entire family when a vengeful clan wipes out his home as a child. He then grows up to be a powerful swordsman, only to find out his younger sister survived and was adopted by an Old Master, when **she** unexpectedly saves his life. The two siblings then works together to seek revenge on their family's killers, leading to an epic Back-to-Back Badass in the finale where they wipe out loads of villains.
-   In **Pacific Rim**, this is one of the possible configurations to operate a Jaeger. The closest known example would be the pilots of Chrome Brutus — Zeke Amarok and Ilisapie Flint — who were male-female cousins.
-   **The Raid 2: Berandal**: Hammer Girl and Baseball Bat Man
-   Simon and River Tam from **Serenity**.
-   **Sophie Scholl -- Die letzten Tage**, a German film about the 1943 trial of the antifascist siblings Sophie and Hans Scholl. And Christoph Probst.
-   In **Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings**, after initial hostilities Shang-Chi and his sister Xialing work together to stop the invasion of Ta Lo village by first the Ten Rings and then the Dweller in Darkness.

-   **Star Wars**: Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa are a brother/sister team — though nobody (including them) knows it until **Return of the Jedi**, which makes for plenty of amusing moments earlier on, especially when Leia kisses Luke on various occasions (ostensibly to comfort him in **The Empire Strikes Back**, or "for luck" in **A New Hope**).

Brother–Sister Team Example in Literature

-   **The 39 Clues** has Dan and Amy Cahill working together to find Clues. Also applies to one of the rival teams in the Clue hunt: Ian and Natalie Kabra.
-   In **Angel Station**, Ubu Roy and Beautiful Maria work together, live together, and rule their ship together.
-   **Artemis Fowl** features brother and sister Butler and Juliet, who form Back-to-Back Badasses in Book 8, and work together several other times.
-   Dagny and James Taggart, sibling executives of a large railroad company in **Atlas Shrugged**. Subverted in that all of James' plans tend to either harm the company or aid it by using legalization to crush their competitors, Dagny is the competent and underappreciated one who really keeps the company going and bail it out of James' mistakes. James does not appreciate this.
-   **The Beginning After the End**:
    -   Curtis and Kathyln Glayder, the Prince and Princess of Sapin. They are a Fire/Ice Duo with the brother being a fire attribute augmenter and the sister being a ice attribute conjurer. Both end up on the Xyrus Academy Disciplinary Committee and form their own team during the War Arc.
    -   After he returns to Dicathen, Arthur starts bringing his sister Eleanor along with him when he enters the Relictombs. As the Leywins are descended from the Djinn, Arthur hopes to unlock some of that latent magical potential within his sister. Eleanor accompanies Arthur and his party when they enter the Relictombs in Volume 11 to join up with Seris and her rebellion, as not only has she unlocked her own distinct form of Djinn magic but she has been chosen by Silverlight to wield it after the death of its former wielder Aldir.
-   Maura and Patrick O'Connell in **Beyond the Western Sea**.
-   The Brothers Grimm quite liked this trope. In addition to the obvious "Hansel and Gretel", there's also a Fairy Tale by them simply called "Brother and Sister".
-   **The Camp Half-Blood Series**:
    -   Demigods from the same camp who work together are automatically this, as they share the same godly parent.
    -   Percy Jackson and Tyson (half-siblings through Poseidon) go on quests together in **The Sea of Monsters** and **The Battle of the Labyrinth**.
    -   Thalia and Jason Grace briefly team up in the last chapters of **The Lost Hero**.
    -   Nico di Angelo and Hazel Levesque (half-siblings through Hades/Pluto) in **The House of Hades**, as Nico joins the Seven as a Sixth Ranger.
    -   Apollo and Artemis don't get to work together much, but when they do, they're **quite** effective.
-   Leto and Ghanima of **Children of Dune**. To a lesser extent, Paul and Alia. Paul's much older, but Alia is ... kind of special.
-   The Pevensie brothers and sisters in C. S. Lewis' **The Chronicles of Narnia**.
-   **The Conquerors Saga**: Princess Ladislav and her brother Prince Radu seem to both want to be this but never really get there because of Lada's conflicted feelings and hatred for pretty much everything Radu loves, and vice versa. However, they still care for each other, and when it comes down to it they care more about one another than anyone else. An atypical example as Lada is the reckless, ugly, and cruel muscle of the duo and Radu, though struggling with his own morality throughout the book, is academically minded and beautiful, and thought (unfairly) by Lada to be little more than dead weight throughout most of the story.
    -   The Blackthorns in **The Dark Artifices**, but particularly fraternal twins Livia and Tiberius, who are inseparable. The two usually serve as information repository to their older brother Julian.
-   **The Dresden Files** has Lara and Thomas Raith, occasionally and rather reluctantly, as Thomas would rather be a Friendly Neighborhood Vampire than help his older sister take over Chicago. The most memorable instance was when they fought off a cave full of regenerating ghouls pretty much by themselves in order to let their allies escape.
-   The **Earth's Children** series has Iza and Creb in the first book—aging sister and brother who are allowed to set up a hearth together. She's the clan medicine woman, and he's the clan shaman. Then in the third book, the Mamutoi custom is for the co-leaders to be a brother and sister. If somebody doesn't have a sibling and wants to set up a separate cave, they may adopt one.
-   Jules and Yvette D'Alembert from E.E. "Doc" Smith's **Family D'Alembert** series. The fact that they achieved the two highest possible scores (1000 and 999) in their final training evaluation means they're evenly matched for ability, neither of them has to carry the other, and it doesn't exactly hurt their ability to get the job done.
-   Three of the five from Enid Blyton's **The Famous Five** novels; Dick, Anne, and Julian are all siblings. The other two are their cousin George and Timmy the dog.
-   If you read the first few chapters of **Flowers in the Attic**, Cathy and Chris were actually showing all the signs of becoming this. Then the attic happened... as well as other things. Interestingly, they still show signs of this even afterwards, before they decide to live their lives as a married couple at the end of the second book, especially during Cathy's relationship to Julian and the last stages of her revenge plan upon their mother.
-   Tash and Zak Arranda in **Galaxy of Fear**. They became very close after the deaths of their parents, and Zak is distressed when his slightly older sister starts wanting to do things apart from him.
-   In the works of Alan Garner, the human protaganists who are absorbed into the world of Faerie to help fight evil are a brother and sister, Colin and Susan. In the first two books **The Weirdstone of Brisingamen** and **The Moon of Gomrath** the implied order is that Colin is the firstborn of two siblings; the third book of the trilogy **Boneland** performs a Retcon and makes them into twins.
-   Harry Potter's friends, the Weasley family, are an all-family team, but Ginny and her brothers work together regularly.
    -   A villainous example could count with Death Eaters, Alecto and Amycus Carrow.
-   Cashmere and Gloss, District One's tributes in the 75th Hunger Games.
-   Archimedes and Zenobia Fox from Meljean Brooks **The Iron Seas** series. Formed partly by their treatment by an Abusive dad, after he finally dies, Archimedes becomes an adventurer archaeologist, while Zenobia turns his adventures into a bestselling series of novels. While they spend most of their time literally half a world apart, their letters that are reproduced in the books, and just the way they talk about each other to other characters, makes it clear that they adore each other. Zenobia adores Archimedes' wife almost as much as he does, though in a non-sexual way (it probably helps that she's the one who killed their monster of a father). In 'The Kraken King' Zenobia's husband protects her with his own body from a fatal barrage, getting badly injured. Archimedes tells him later, "In that moment, I loved you more than she did." This is actually the first time they've met.
-   **Journey to Chaos**: Cremia and Ash Aelios are both clerics at Central Hearth, the capital of Fire worship on Tariatla, and perform both rituals and guard duty together. This led to a moment of confusion when Ash referred to her as "Sister Cremia" before clarifying that she is also his biological sister.
-   Carter and Sadie Kane take on the Egyptian gods in **The Kane Chronicles**. While they start the series out extremely distant because they've been living apart for the better part of their formative years, the internal narration reveals that they're both still extremely loyal to each other despite this. And over the course of the series, their team only gets stronger.
-   Éomer and Éowyn in **The Lord of the Rings** are almost this but not quite.
-   **Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard**: Samirah Al Abbas and Alex Fierro, both daughters of Loki, are core members of Magnus' team since the second book.
-   Maya and Joey from the **Maradonia Saga**.

-   Going into the New Jedi Order (and admittedly earlier), we have Jacen, Jaina, and Anakin Solo.
-   Georgia and Shaun Mason from the **Newsflesh** trilogy. They were adopted as babies and both are born from different parents. They checked.
-   **Literature/Quarters**: Vree and Bannon. They're fraternal twins, brother and sister, who work as assassins together.
-   The protagonists of **The Railway Children** are two sisters and a brother.
-   **Raybearer**: Tar and Dayo, who as the Raybearers are meant to rule together and balance each other out. Downplayed since they're cousins, not siblings, even though they do have a very sibling-like relationship.
-   **Revanche Cycle**: Vassili and Despina, aka Worm and Shrike, are an inseparable team (the family that murders together, stays together). They're also the Owl's Co-Dragons.
-   **The Shadowhunter Chronicles**:
    -   Alec and Isabelle Lightwood have been working as a team since childhood.
    -   Will and Cecily Herondale in the third book of **The Infernal Devices**, after the latter wises up to the Shadowhunter world.
-   **A Song of Ice and Fire**:
    -   The Lannister siblings, to an extent. While Cersei and Jaime are certainly close (more than what should be proper), Cersei and Tyrion hate each other's guts. That said, they are forced to work together for most of **A Clash of Kings**, as Cersei is the queen regent while Tyrion serves as the Hand of the King.
    -   Loras and Margaery Tyrell provide a healthier example. The two support each other as they navigate the politics of King's Landing, which irritates Cersei, as she feels that they are undermining her authority.
    -   In the backstory, Aegon the Conqueror wrestled the control of the Seven Kingdoms alongside his sister-wives, Visenya and Rhaenys, and their three dragons. The three largest hills of King's Landing were named after them.
    -   The long and prosperous reign of Jaehaerys I was supported by the fact that he and his sister-wife, Alysanne, were partners in crime. He was a good king, she was a good queen, and they complemented each other.
-   Subverted by Sookie and Jason in **The Sookie Stackhouse Mysteries**. Jason is a user who puts Sookie over a barrel so he can do whatever he wants.
    -   In **Dead Until Dark**, he doesn't believe her when she tells him she was molested, because the molester was their uncle and seemed like a nice guy.
    -   In **Dead To The World**, he volunteers Sookie to babysit an amnesiac vampire who's being headhunted by vicious witches, so he can get a cut of the reward money. His contribution was to loan Sookie a shotgun.
    -   In **From Dead To Worse**, after his manipulation and cowardice forces her to smash a friend's fingers with a brick, she finally tells him she never wants to see him again.
-   Princess Andromeda and Sir George (actually Georgina) in **One Good Knight** from Mercedes Lackey's **Tales of the Five Hundred Kingdoms**. Andie proposes that they become blood-siblings to invoke this trope since otherwise, The Tradition (the ambient magic in the land) would do everything it could to make her fall in love with the knight who rescued her.
    -   Lackey's books in general have a tendency to do this whenever the main character isn't a total orphan, which is rare. Notably in **The Halfblood Chronicles** series with Andre Norton, where there are siblings everywhere.
-   Trapped on Draconica: Jenna fights alongside her Warrior Prince brother Kalak. It is immediately apparent that she wants to be his **only** female partner.
-   Being a book about the Greek gods' return to the modern world, **Zeus Is Dead: A Monstrously Inconvenient Adventure** includes the mythological brother-sister team of Apollo and Artemis, though Apollo spends some of the book keeping Artemis in the dark because he doesn't want to risk her safety.

Brother–Sister Team Example in Live-Action TV

-   Deconstructed in **Altered Carbon**. What happens when your love for your sibling is stronger than your loyalty to the cause you're fighting for?
-   Common in **The Amazing Race**: Most notably the Linz Siblings, Nick and Starr, and Tammy and Victor, all won their respective season.
-   Arrowverse:
    -   After a turbulent relationship for three seasons, Oliver Queen and his sister Thea become this in Season 4 of **Arrow** with her taking on the moniker Speedy (to her chagrin as it was Oliver's childhood nickname for her). This also translates into their civilians' lives, with Oliver running for Mayor with his sister as campaign manager.
    -   History Repeats in the Flash Forward of Season 7 of **Arrow**, when, after a long time bickering and distrusting each other, Oliver's children William Clayton and Mia Smoak become a team and be able to rely on each other, just as their father wanted them to.
    -   **The Flash** reveals that in the Flashpoint timeline, Iris and Wally West form Central City's crimefighting team, with Wally as the Flash and Iris as his mission control. This eventually becomes a reality in Season 4, when they work together in the absence of Barry Allen, who is briefly trapped inside the Speed Force.
    -   **Legends of Tomorrow**: The final episode of Season 5 has Zari and Behrad Tarazi working together as a Legend by sharing the Wind Totem.
-   Anni and Otto in **Charité at War**, despite clearly loving each other, initially argue a lot because of their opposing political views — Anni is passively compliant with the Nazi regime, Otto as vocally a dissident as he can be without getting killed. However, they team up to put up resistance when Anni needs help hiding her disabled child from the eugenics programme and Otto needs help to rescue his boyfriend from the department for the persecution of homosexuals.
-   **Destination Fear**: Dakota and Chelsea Laden.
-   In **Dexter**, the title character and his younger sister Debra team up in the seventh season after she learns of his secret and helps cover for him at times. Of course, this ends in the Season 7 finale.
-   Annie and Tom on **The Edison Twins**. They also have a younger brother, Paul, but he's mostly comic relief.
-   The Go-on Wings, Miu and Hiroto Sutou, in **Engine Sentai Go-onger**. Also, The Landick siblings, Agri and Moune from **Tensou Sentai Goseiger**; and Takaharu and Fuuka Igasaki in **Shuriken Sentai Ninninger**. Sibling Team series **Chikyuu Sentai Fiveman**, **Kyūkyū Sentai GoGoV** and **Mahou Sentai Magiranger** usually also have episodes focusing on one brother and one sister, bringing this dynamic into play.
-   **Kamen Rider Revice** has the Igarashi siblings, two brothers and a sister who transform into Kamen Riders and fight together.
    -   The Wings' **Power Rangers RPM** counterparts Gem and Gemma as well. Also in the **Lightspeed Rescue** season, Dana and Ryan Mitchell, respectively Pink and Titanium Ranger, in **Power Rangers Super Samurai**, Jayden and Lauren Shiba, the Red Rangers, and in **Power Rangers Dino Fury** we get Javi and Izzy, who are the first who are in no way either Sixth Rangers or Extra Rangers.
-   Simon and River Tam from **Firefly**.
-   **Game of Thrones**:
    -   Margaery Tyrell and her brother Ser Loras form this in their three-way marriage to King Renly Baratheon in Season 2. Unlike Queen Cersei and King Joffrey's barely concealed discord in "Valar Dohaeris," the Tyrell siblings are very much in sync during the dinner conversation and actively work together throughout the series.
    -   After Sansa Stark reunites with her brother Jon Snow in Season 6, they team up to take down the Boltons and reclaim Winterfell. Jon's battle prowess and martial capabilities and Sansa's cunning nature and political know-how prove to be a highly effective and lethal combination. And like the Tyrells above, all four surviving Stark siblings genuinely love and care for each other, collaborating to meet an end goal that will save the North and their remaining family.
    -   Also in Season 6, Theon and Yara Greyjoy team up with Daenerys Targaryen and her massive fleet in a bid to reclaim the Iron Islands from their kinslaying uncle. However, in a surprise twist, it's the sister instead of the brother who's claimant to the throne. Theon is in full support of Yara becoming Queen instead of himself.
-   A Brother/Sister team is part of the grifter gang from Season 5 of **Hustle**.
-   **It's a Big Big World**: Smooch and Winslow are a brother and sister pair of common marmosets who like to play around.
-   **JAG**: When in Russia, Harm and Mac get help from such a team in "Gypsy Eyes".
-   Brian and Julie on one episode of the reality show **Mantracker**.
    -   They weren't more than fair and seemed rather overmatched. They fit the Rule of Cute however.
-   Inverted in **Merlin**, in which Arthur and Morgana work together several times in the early seasons, but are estranged by the time they realize that they're half-siblings.
-   **MythQuest**: Alex and Cleo are Intrepid Fictioneers, who search for their father inside the mythology of the world.
-   **The Outer Limits (1995)**: In "From Within", Howie and Sheila Morrison work together to rid the townspeople of the ancient parasites.
-   Guy and Isabella of Gisborne in **Robin Hood.** At least in some episodes. The rest of the time, they're trying to kill each other.
-   Luke and Sky in **The Sarah Jane Adventures** started to become this in the final episode. It's a pity we didn't get to see more.
-   **Stath Lets Flats**: Stath and Sophie seem to spend most of their time together – they both work for their father, frequently hang out and even go out on double dates.
-   In **Stargate Atlantis**, McKay's little sister Jeannie pops up a few times to help him solve various problems. They have great sibling chemistry (read: they're pretty mean to each other), largely helped by the fact that the two actors are siblings in real life.
-   Sookie and Jason Stackhouse from **True Blood** work together and have a great relationship; although their storylines are usually separate, when they **do** team up, they're a pretty awesome team. For proof, just see the Fellowship of the Sun from Season 2!
-   Justin and Alex of **Wizards of Waverly Place**, when they actually decide to work together.

Brother–Sister Team Example in Theatre

-   Mungojerry and Rumpleteazer in **Cats** aren't actually specified as brother and sister but by the way they act, and how their coat colouring and voices are similar, this is very likely. They are a pair of mischievous cats that have a habit of stealing and breaking things for fun.
-   Orestes and Electra of **Electra** are a brother-sister team, but not the kid-friendly sort. Their principal objective is to kill their mother and step-father for killing their father **and** treating them badly.

---
Brother–Sister Team Example in Video Games

-   **Assassin's Creed Syndicate** has the two playable protagonists, twins Jacob and Evie Frye.
-   The main protagonists of **Astral Chain** are a pair of twins. Overlaps with Static Role, Exchangeable Character; when given the choice to choose between the brother and sister, the player-controlled character is made into the Heroic Mime older sibling that can be named, whereas the unchosen one becomes their younger twin with the fixed name of Akira, along with hefty amounts of dialogue.
-   Carl and Ada Clover (Nirvana) from **BlazBlue**, this trope being the general focus of their gameplay and story.
    -   Ragna and Noel may also count as this since she is technically a clone of his real sister.
-   The Half-Identical Twins Fujimaru and Matsuri Kudo in **Bleach: The 3rd Phantom**.
-   The leaders of the 54 Immortals in **Call of Duty: Black Ops III** are the brother/sister team of Goh Min and Goh Xiulan.
-   **Crash Bandicoot**: Crash and Coco Bandicoot, starting from **Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back**. This is more apparent in **Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped** and **Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time**, where they are both playable characters and share similar movesets and animations in the latter (and Coco is a switchable skin for Crash in the former at the start with the **N. Sane Trilogy**).
-   Bran and Norah, two barbarian warriors that can be recruited as companions in **A Dance with Rogues**.
-   Taro and Hanako in **Disgaea 2**.
-   Possible in **Dragon Age II**, depending on Hawke's gender and which sibling survives the prologue (which is determined by Hawke's class).
-   **Fallout: New Vegas** has not one, but two. The town of Freeside is home to the Garret Twins and the Van Graff siblings.
-   There are a lot of Brother Sister Teams in the **Fire Emblem** series, particularly about half the cast of **Genealogy of the Holy War**. There's also Raven and Priscilla in **The Blazing Blade**, Eirika and Ephraim in **Sacred Stones**, Ike and Mist in **Path of Radiance** and **Radiant Dawn**, Chrom and Lissa in **Awakening**, the Royal Siblings plus the Avatar and Azura in **Fire Emblem Fates**, Alfonse and Sharena in **Fire Emblem Heroes**, Rowan and Lianna in **Fire Emblem Warriors** (who, fun fact, are crowned co-rulers of Aytolis at the end of the game **because** they work best as a team), and two pairs in **Fire Emblem Engage** (the twins Clanne and Framme, and Panette and Pandreo of Solm).
    -   Depending on who marries whom in **Fire Emblem: Awakening** and **Fire Emblem Fates**, the player can get a duo of Lucina or Morgan (**Awakening**) or Kana or Shigure (**Fates**) with an opposite-gender sibling each, or both together: ie, Lucina can have it with Inigo or Brady aside from a Chrom!Morgan, a Female Morgan or a Female Kana with the potential sons of the male Avatar, or Shigure with potential daughters of Azura.
-   **Gladius** has Ursula and Urlan.
-   Barzum and Baizli from **Hiveswap**...kind of. They're actually one physical consciousness psychically linked to two bodies.
-   Alex & Ash from **Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number**.
-   **Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity**: Once Future Badass Sidon comes, he's most often seen with Mipha, fighting alongside her.
-   Iji takes point against the alien attackers, while her brother Dan acts as Mission Control. One of the subplots is about how Iji's love for her brother keeps her going despite Dan's assertions of emotional detachment.
-   Juno and Vela, along with their well-trained pet Lupus, fight the evil forces of Mizar in **Jet Force Gemini**.
-   In the **Killer Instinct** series, Jago and Orchid are separated siblings, which is revealed during the second game. It depends on the ending you get (determined by who you use an Ultra/Ultimate/No Mercy on during the Arcade ladder), some of which have them team up.
-   **K.O.L.M.**: Robbie and Sis team up to get past the numerous environmental obstacles in the second game — Robbie can blast open gold and purple doors that Sis can't and survive prolonged periods in even contaminated water, while Sis can past through the harsh sunlight without burning up like Robbie.
-   Garen and Lux from **League of Legends**, for DEMACIA!
-   Bud and Lisa from **Legend of Mana**.
-   There is a Brother–Sister Team in **Mega Man Star Force 3** serving Mr. King as members of Dealers.
-   **A Plague Tale: Innocence** and its sequel game **A Plague Tale Reqiuem** have older sister Amicia de Rune and little brother Hugo de Rune. Amicia, being ten years or so older than her sheltered and ill five-year-old brother, naturally takes on the brunt of the action and makes most of the decisions, with Hugo primarily helping by crawling through small openings until his 11th-Hour Superpower awakens. They start the first game off as near strangers and take quite a bit of adjustment before they settle in to a close dynamic.
    -   The first game also has Melie and Arthur, who are thief siblings on a much more even footing with each other, and who also bicker and have more serious disagreements while still maintaining close ties.
-   Tate and Liza, the Mossdeep City Gym leaders in **Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire**/**Emerald**/**Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire**.
-   **Puyo Puyo**:
    -   Yu and Rei are ghost twins, the former being the sister and the latter being the brother, and with the exception of **Puyo Pop Fever**, they always fight opponents together.
    -   Jay and Elle from **Puyo Puyo Tetris** are another set of brother-and-sister twins (Jay is the male and Elle is the female, but their appearances are deliberately made androgynous so it's hard to tell) who play Puyo and pull pranks with each other.
-   Rau and Tati in **Rise of the Kasai**
-   Chris and Claire Redfield from the **Resident Evil** series (particularly in **Resident Evil – Code: Veronica**).
-   The main characters in **A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004)** are a trio of siblings (two sisters and one brother) who work together to protect each other and escape Olaf and his comrades.
-   **Solatorobo: Red the Hunter** gives us Red and Chocolat, a Happily Adopted brother-sister duo. Then Elh arrives to make it a trio.
-   **South Park: The Fractured but Whole** has two DLC packs that include one character each: Henrietta in "From Dusk to Casa Bonita" and Mintberry Crunch in "Bring the Crunch". Both characters happen to be siblings and, if put in the same team, it's obvious that they don't get along too well.
    
    **Mintberry Crunch**: Get out of the way, it's my fat sister's turn!  
    **Henrietta**: Oh, real mature.
    
-   **Spyro the Dragon** has Handel and Greta, who are twins who go on "secwet" spy missions together and have some kind of magical power they can access by linking hands. However, they're usually separated whenever Spyro encounters either of them, so we don't get to see much of how they function together beyond the opening and closing cutscenes of **Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage!**'s Scorch world.
-   The player characters of **Submerged - Hidden Depths** are Miku and her younger brother Taku.
-   The Sage siblings in **Tales of Symphonia**. Though in this case, Raine has been Promoted to Parent.
    -   The Hearts sibling in **Tales of Hearts**.
-   **Tanuki Justice** have the titular siblings, a pair of tanuki ninja brother and sister kicking ass. The sister is inevitably coloured pink, just because.
-   Gavrielle and Farasat in **Telepath Tactics**, who are working to rescue their enslaved brother. Mechanically, they actually don't work very well together, as they're both fragile ranged attackers who need a tough fighter to protect them. The Strider sisters, another Sibling Team, are actually well-suited for this.
-   In **Umineko: When They Cry**, Lambdadelta makes Bern accept the rule that if Ange enters the board as Bern's piece, Battler cannot find out her identity or else Ange dies specifically in order to avoid this trope. Ange is forced into a Mysterious Protector role instead. Later Zepar and Furfur enter into scene, twin demons who act as a Greek Chorus for EP6 and 7. They're an interesting variation on this trope since while they're brother and sister, it's never stated who's the brother and who's the sister.
-   In **The World Ends with You**, Beat and Rhyme are partners for the first week. Well, part of it, anyway.
-   **World of Warcraft Cataclysm** has two villainous brother-sister teams of dragons. Nefarian and Onyxia, who were fought separately before, appear together in Blackwing Descent, and the Bastion of Twilight has Valiona and Theralion.
-   Implied Trope in the **XCOM: Enemy Unknown** expansion called Enemy Within. One of the Progeny missions has you rescue some abducted humans from an alien ship. If you accomplish the mission without damaging the stasis pods, three soldiers join your ranks: Mathew "Alecto" Hawkins, Sniper from the USA, Said "Magaera" Tariq, Support from Egypt, and Fatima "Tisiphone" Tariq, Assault from Egypt. As two of the five soldiers without a random name, how likely is it that those last two are related?
-   Dunban and his little sister Fiora serve as one of these as evidenced not only in gameplay but also the story for **Xenoblade Chronicles 1**. While Dunban is hot-headed yet mature Fiora is much calmer and thinks of the consequences of her actions... Sometimes.

Brother–Sister Team Example in Visual Novels

-   **Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney** features titular character Apollo and his assistant/legal aide, Trucy, who are revealed to be half-siblings through their Missing Mom near the end of the game. The characters themselves remain unaware of this fact.
-   **Corpse Party**: Satoshi and Yuka in the major part of the game and the anime OVA. They only have each other as they try to solve the mystery of the accursed place, as well as trying to find their other friends they lost in the earthquake at the beginning of the game.
-   **Shall We Date?: Ninja Shadow** has Kaname Shishido as a promising ninja fighter and his twin sister Saori as his partner and bodyguard. Or **would** have, had Kaname not been killed off at the beginning of the game...

Brother–Sister Team Example in Web Animation

-   In **Lackadaisy**, Marigold Gang's Hired Guns are Louisiana Cajuns Nico and Serafine, Affably Evil, chatty Blood Knights who relish a good fight and laugh their way through a Car Chase Shootout hunting down whiskey runners horning in on Marigold's territory. The only point their temperament breaks is when rival gangmember Rocky chucks a lit stick of dynamite at Serafine's feet, prompting both to display fear as devoted brother Nico dives to knock them both out of its way.
-   In **Mighty Magiswords**, Prohyas (brother) and Vambre (sister) of the Warrior family go on adventures to collect magical swords.
-   **Red vs. Blue**:
    -   The Dakota twins, conforming to the traditional understanding of the trope most in the Freelancer saga. Brutally, horribly present especially in the current (post-Blood Gulch) era. Of course, this was The Director's plan.
    -   As of Season 10, Carolina and Epsilon, to a degree. Both are "children" of the Director, now teamed up. And as of Season 12, Epsilon has now referred to Carolina as 'sis.' Whether she knows about this or not remains ambiguous.

Brother–Sister Team Example in Web Original

-   Polaron and StarFyre of **Super Stories**.
-   The Stratosphere Siblings of the **Whateley Universe**. While the girl is younger than the twin boys, she still ends up playing team mom most of the time.

Brother–Sister Team Example in Web Videos

-   Half-elven, Half-Identical Twins Vex'ahlia and Vax'ildan from **Critical Role**. Known affectionately as "the stealth twins" by fans, they often work together to scout ahead of the party, and sometimes even sync their attacks during battle.
-   **The Wayward Guide For The Untrained Eye**: Twins Artemis and Paul Schue-Horyn work together at the American Podcasting Network, and go together to investigate the town of Connor Creek. In fact, their boss partly favors them because of this dynamic. They host the titular In-Universe podcast on it (see Podcast entry above).

---
Brother–Sister Team Example in Western Animation

-   **American Dragon: Jake Long** almost subverts this trope. Jake and Haley have been known to work as a team, but it's usually reluctantly as they're most frequently at each other's throats.
-   **Avatar: The Last Airbender**:
    -   Sokka and Katara, at least early in the show. As the series goes on, each of them tend to work more with other members of the team due to their respective skill sets meshing better with other characters, but they still have their moments.
    -   Zuko and Azula, after years of mutual animosity, finally start working as a team in the back half of the show. At least until Zuko realized what he was doing and completed the Heel–Face Turn he'd started.

-   **Best and Bester**: The titular duo are Best (boy) and Bester (girl), who regularly use their powers as a duo to help out the people of Bettervale.
-   The interaction of the team members of **Clue Club** would indicate they are brothers and sisters. It's established that Pepper and Dotty are sisters; Larry shows definite big/older brother traits.
-   **Edgar & Ellen** are a two-twin pranking duo.
-   **Gigantosaurus** has a villainous example in the Raptors, Cror and Totor. These 2 like to go around Cretacia and pick on whoever comes their way.
-   Dipper and Mabel from **Gravity Falls** frequently work together to face the various supernatural creatures in the titular town. Dipper often comes up with the plan while his sister Mabel provides support and improvises.
-   **Grossology** stars Abby and Ty Archer, teenage superspies who deal with villains based around nasty stuff ranging from bodily emissions and excretions to insects and parasites.
-   He-Man and She-Ra, from their respective cartoons, are fraternal twins. Though they live on separate planets and usually operate independently, they fit this trope on the occasions when they work together, such as in the She-Ra pilot and the Christmas special.
-   Among the conceptualized but not implemented characters of **Jem** are The Mongrels, a brother-sister band consisting of Alex and Alyx Couto. They, along with their computer-hologram Entropy, were to be the villains in the unmade movie.
-   **Kim Possible** and the tweebs in Season 4 just barely fits the team trope. They outfitted the Kim-mobile with all its neat gizmos and were very displeased when Motor Ed blew their doors off.
-   From the Sequel Series **The Legend of Korra**, the titular heroine's cousins Desna and Eska are a villainous (At first) example.
-   In **Legend Of The Dragon** the twins are a team at the beginning until Ang gets the power of the Golden Dragon. Ling, jealous, takes off, and in her rage and confusion, meets up with the Zodiac Master, and turns into the Shadow Dragon. But at the season finale, Ling comes back, and they end up sharing the power of Golden Dragon, thence to take out the Zodiac Master and his boss together.
    -   Season 2 had yet another example in Yin Wi and the Emperor of the Darkest Yin.
-   Juniper Lee and Ray-Ray ...kind of. He's more of a hyperactive Annoying Younger Sibling who tags along.
-   Martin and Diana in the western animation version of **Martin Mystery**, albeit as stepsiblings. Note that in the original comic, they were both adults, and **lovers**...not that the show didn't give off certain vibes.
-   **Rick and Morty**: Summer and Morty are very often working together, usually against a problem caused by their Mad Scientist grandfather, Rick.
-   **Rocket Power** has the Rocket siblings Reggie and Otto, who are teammates during street hockey games and other team extreme sports most of the times, and though they bump heads on occasions (especially when Reggie gets annoyed of Otto's stubbornness and rebellious attitude), they still get along well.
-   Many episodes of **The Simpsons** involve Bart & Lisa Simpson teaming up to foil some evil plot or at the very least getting involved in hijinks together.
    -   In one of the **Treehouse of Horror** episodes, Bart and Lisa become crimefighting supersiblings Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl.
    -   Kang and Kodos, the two aliens that mostly appear in non-canonical media, are this. Maybe.
-   **Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends** introduced Lightwave, Aurora Dante, Iceman's young half-sister. They're a flawless team while (pretending to be) under mind control, and their interaction suggests they've teamed up before.
-   **Tenko and the Guardians of the Magic** has an evil sibling duo in Jana and Jason. They are twins and this particular quality allows them to combine their magic. Mostly, they use it to form a two-headed dragon.
-   **TigerSharks** being **ThunderCats** recycled UNDERWATER, same deal. Except both brother-sister teams were adults.
-   The title characters of **The Twins of Destiny** are Jules and Julie. They were born on the same day from different fathers and different mothers, but it's hinted that their mothers were a simultaneous incarnation of the Moon Goddess, whom the twins are constantly called the children of. In any case, they were raised together and consider themselves brother and sister. Their twinhood is what allows them access to magic, for only when they touch can they command supernatural forces.
-   **Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum** has Xavier and his sister Yadina, who go on time travel missions together with their best friend Brad.
-   **Yin Yang Yo!** has the brother-sister duo of Yin and Yang who always work together to take down the Villain of the Week.

-   Hans and Sophie Scholl who were part of the White Rose league, a pacifist resistance movement in Nazi Germany.
-   Edward the Elder and Æthelflæd Lady of the Mercians the son and daughter of Alfred the Great. Together as King of Wessex and Queen in all but name of the English Midlands they continued their father's good work of driving back Viking raiders and bringing the Danelaw back under English control.
-   Rukhsana (sister) and Adaz (brother) Kauser helped fight off Islamist extortioners at their farmhouse on the Indian-Pakistani border. While they were busy beating up the parents Rukhsana seized an ax and whacked one on the head with it. Then the two siblings held off the terrorists with captured rifles. According to The Other Wiki, one of them was a "distinguished" terrorist with a £4000 bounty on his head.
-   Tennis players Marat Safin and Dinara Safina are the only brother and sister ever to have reached the world #1 ranking in singles. They also made up the Russian team at the 2009 Hopman Cup<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> and finished as runners-up.
-   Some notable figure skating/ice dancing pairs have been brother and sister — Peter and Kitty Carruthers are the last American pair to win a medal at the Olympics — a silver at the 1984 Sarajevo Games.
-   During the Anarchy in XII century England, Empress Maude had her chief supporter in her illegitimate half-brother Robert of Gloucester.
-   Professional dancers Derek and Julianne Hough. When they were young, they were sent to London, where they were trained in song, theatre, gymnastics and many forms of dance, including jazz, ballet, and tap. They partook in various dance competitions in London. The Houghs would later perform on **Dancing with the Stars** at various times, both as professional dancers and as judges. They would also tour the world in various dancing/singing shows, including 2014's "Move Live On Tour" and 2017's "Move Beyond". The Houghs also hosted various televised Disney holiday celebrations at Thanksgiving and Christmas. They also had their own dance show called **Holidays with the Houghs**.
-   Rachael MacFarlane would frequently perform in several cartoon shows created by her brother Seth, including several incidental voices on **Family Guy** and a major role on **American Dad!**.
-   Andrés Muschietti and his sister Barbara have worked on multiple film projects together.
-   Sean and Sinead Persaud of Shipwrecked Comedy write and star in practically all of the company's works, and have become a television writing team outside of the company as well.
-   Famously averted with Warren Beatty and Shirley MacLaine.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> While the two are close, they made it a point not to be this in the hopes of creating individual names and identities for themselves. It actually worked, as both have had long-lasting and prolific careers and many fans weren't even aware that they were related.
