Beary Friendly: 
_Dashing and daring, courageous and caring  
Faithful and friendly, with stories to share.  
All through the forest, they sing out in chorus  
Marching along as their song fills the air!  
Gummi Bears!  
Bouncing here and there and everywhere  
High adventure that's beyond compare  
They are the Gummi Bears!_

Sometimes in the media, bears have been portrayed as fierce and intimidating, but that's not always the case. Some of the other portrayals paint bears in a more sympathetic light, sometimes even to the extent of being a Gentle Giant, and their big size certainly helps. Through such portrayals, they are not merely non-aggressive aversions or subversions to Bears Are Bad News, but they tend to show friendly interactions with humans or other sentient beings. Not that they can't be bad news if you, ahem, get funny with one.

This trope may have something to do with how unlike their fellow carnivoran mammals like wolves and big cats, bears are omnivores as opposed to obligate carnivores, some species even leaning toward or even being herbivorous (most famously Giant Pandas), and so goes the assumption that Herbivores Are Friendly.

Teddy Bears, when portrayed as Living Toys, usually fall into this category.

Compare Beary Funny, where bears are portrayed through comedic means, although overlap is common.

Contrast Bears Are Bad News for bears who are _neither friendly nor funny_, though it can overlap through a well-pushed Berserk Button.

This doesn't stop Goldie from being frightened and running away when they show up; presumably she's savvy enough to realize it was a bad idea to make a bunch of **bears** angry at her, however friendly they might be otherwise. In earlier iterations of the story, it should be noted, they were far less nice.

Beary Friendly Example in  Fan Works

-   **Prehistoric Earth**: Baloo the cave bear, despite his fearsome appearance and many scars and wounds that indicate how many fights he's been in, is actually a very friendly and agreeable animal for the staff at the titular prehistoric zoo to work with (especially for his primary keepers Alice and Will). Nevertheless, his size and strength, plus the sheer savagery he can display in the rare event in which he's **not** in a good mood, make him very much not the type of animal a person with brains would want as their enemy.
-   ''Prehistoric Park Reimagined: Kronk the arctotherium is one of the friendliest of the prehistoric bears rescued for display at the titular park, being a lovable ditz who is perfectly content with spending his days feasting nonstop upon spinach and honey.

Beary Friendly Example in Tabletop Games

-   **BattleTech** has Clan Ghost Bear. In spite of their name and the fact that they are named after five-meter-tall polar bears, they are actually one of the most restrained and level-headed of the otherwise action-first questions-later Clans. They prove themselves to be perfectly reasonable inhabitants of the Inner Sphere, moving in and making themselves comfortable by integrating relatively smoothly into the Free Rasalhague Republic and having excellent relationships between their combat and noncombat castes—warriors are viewed as the protective parents of the Clan, and the noncombat castes as beloved children to be defended at all costs. They even heavily favor the Elemental phenotype, resulting in an army of eight foot all Power Armored Super Soldiers that mostly have Gentle Giant natures. Yet despite their friendliness, a sure-fire way to discover that Clan Ghost Bear can be just as dangerous as their ursine namesake is hurting their civilians. You would be invited to ask Word of Blake or Motstånd or Clan Blood Spirit how things went for them after attacking Ghost Bear civilians, except you cannot, **because the Ghost Bears killed everyone responsible**.

While Rage and Frenzy are something they are capable of, they are far less prone to this than Garou<sup>*&nbsp;</sup>. Of course, pushing them far enough to berserk or otherwise convincing them that they must resort to violence is a **serious** mistake.

Beary Friendly Example in Video Games

-   Banjo, the bear from **Banjo-Kazooie**, is friends with Kazooie, Bottles, and Mumbo. In general, he's also very kind and friendly to most of not all of the minor NPCs he comes across, at least in comparison to his companion Kazooie.

-   Tae the Bear God of **Lusternia**. He has a Little Guy, Big Buddy relationship with his (much brighter) friend Bollikin, and spends most of his time playing with his bear creations and eating honey. He still shouldn't be messed with, though.
-   Okku in **Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer** manages to be both this **and** Bears Are Bad News. He's a Gentle Giant most of the time, soft-spoken and intelligent, known to crack jokes on occasion, and a loyal ally to a good-aligned Knight-Captain, but cross him at your peril.
-   While Teddie of **Persona 4** isn't a bear in the strictest sense - he appears to be an animate bear-themed mascot costume, then he grows a human body, before it's revealed at his Social Link's Max Rank that he's actually a Shadow who grew an ego — he maintains the idea that he's a bear, constantly using many, **many** bear puns.

-   The bear mother in **MySims Kingdom** follows you despite being a visitor, and does not maul you even though you approach her cub. Don't try this at ho-- er, in the woods.
-   **Team Fortress 2**: Heavy Weapons Guy is only a bear through Animal Motifs, but he's an example of both this and Bears Are Bad News. Like a bear, he worries about his family quite a bit. (The Communist government executed their father and threw him, his mother, and sisters in a gulag in Siberia, and he was forced to torture the guards, free all the prisoners, and burn the place down to escape. The guards have been chasing them ever since, so he has reason to worry.), and sends money and food back to them.

-   **Dusty Revenge** has the supporting character, Rondel, who's a Papa Bear on a quest to rescue his abducted son. While he's bad news to his enemies, however he's on the side of good, frequently assisting his allies Dusty and McCoy and providing backup with his **Grenade Launcher**.
-   Due to **Pokémon** being a vast array of species, each with varying personalities, you might find a mean Munchlax, Teddiursa, Pancham, and Cubchoo, but you might also find a very friendly Snorlax, Ursaring, Pangoro, and Beartic. Bewear deconstructs this. It's actually a very friendly Bear Pokemon, however it is dreaded around the Alola Region due to it not knowing its own dangerous strength, causing it to inadvertently crush the things it hugs, which includes its own **trainer**.
-   The Nintendo 3DS game **Teddy Together** involves the player interacting and befriending a living teddy bear.
-   Angus from **Night in the Woods** is Gregg's loving boyfriend who is friendly and compassionate to his friends despite coming from a terrible and tragic upbringing.
-   **Sonic the Fighters** had Gentle Giant Bark the polar bear. His Japanese character profile for the **Fighters Megamix** guide book describes him as "North Island's #1 snowboarder. He is blunt and quiet, but has a gentle and loving heart. He's actually a shy guy." Fans however largely mistook him for a villain, which became Ascended Fanon in **Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)**.
-   In **Stardew Valley**, one of the Secret Notes you can find is a badly-spelled request for maple syrup to be brought to the Secret Forest. Sure enough, the client is a talking bear who, after treating the exchange like a drug deal ("have you got 'the stuff'? oh yeah, that's the good 'stuff'"), gratefully teaches you "Bear's Secret Knowledge" to improve the quality of wild berries, tripling their sale value.
    -   Version 1.5 adds a buyable telephone, and you may sometimes receive calls from the bear thanking you again for the syrup. How he got a phone is a riddle for the ages, since Robin (who sells it) doesn't speak forest magic.
    -   During Emily's 10-heart event, a camping date in the forest, a bear spooks the two of you too badly to get the second tent set up, giving you an excuse to share only one tent (and possibly more). If it's the same bear, he may be a Shipper on Deck.
-   Abu from **My Time at Portia** is a large bear in a bathrobe that lives in a cottage just outside the walls of Portia. He only speaks in unintelligible grunts, but he acts friendly to the townsfolk, so much so that he's earned the affectionate nickname 'Papa Bear,' and he acts as a Parental Substitute to Oaks.
-   The player's avatar and all recruitable allies/ power ups in **Alphabear Two** are bears. Players can customize their avatar with a variety of skins to make it look like a polar bear, black bear, brown bear, panda bear, teddy bear, zombie bear, etc...

-   **Five Nights at Freddy's**: In a series full of examples of Bears Are Bad News, there are two notable exceptions:
    -   Helpy of **Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator** is designed purely to help the player run their pizzeria by tracking their spending and testing attractions. Even **Ultimate Custom Night**, which moves him closer to the bad news trope, downplays this as he merely blows an airhorn instead of attacking the player.
    -   Glamrock Freddy of **Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach**, thanks to avoiding Vanny's hacking by malfunctioning on stage and rebooting in safe mode, maintains his friendly demeanor and aids Gregory in trying to escape the Pizzaplex. However, if he loses enough battery or Gregory hits a wrong button while trying to repair him, he'll glitch out and attack Gregory anyway. The true ending also has him getting hacked by Burntrap, making him a threat there too.
-   **Lenna's Inception**: Besides humans, the other race of friendly NPCs are bears who talk in puns.
-   The **Over the Hedge** game has Vincent, the Big Bad of the original movie, pull a Heel–Face Turn and join up with the hedgies to get revenge on the Verminator. He's accepted easily by the porcupine kids; everyone else is rightfully still afraid of him. Luckily, he's pretty chill afterwards.
    
    **RJ:** Aww, he's just like a giant teddy bear. With anger issues. And half eaten bats on his breath.
    
-   Invoked with Brody Holloway in **Life Is Strange 2**, who is depicted in Sean's drawings as a bear (mostly due to him being large and hairy) and is the first stranger to show the Diaz brothers any kindness after Esteban's death; when Sean and Daniel run into his car after escaping from the gas station, Brody not only immediately believes them and drives them away to safety while letting Sean vent to him, but also buys them some supplies, a large backpack, bus tickets, and a motel room.

-   Teddy from **Queer Kid Stuff** is Lindsay's Teddy Bear co-host. He regularly asks Lindsay questions so she can explain things both to him, and the audience.
-   Stitches from **Ruby Quest**, when he's lucid, is a calm, friendly guy who doesn't want to hurt anyone and even saves Tom from having to make a Heroic Sacrifice at the end. However, given the current state of the facility, he's more often an example of Bears Are Bad News (or at least Bears Are Tortured Monsters).
-   The **SCP Foundation** has garnered a few strange teddy bears over the years.

Beary Friendly Example in Western Animation

-   **Big City Greens**: The episode “Bear Trapped” is about a bear running amok at Big City. When Cricket, Tilly, and Remy meet the bear, she turns out to be very friendly towards them. They become fast friends, and the kids try to protect the bear, whom they named “Daisy,” from animal control. In the end, Daisy moves into the sewers to escape them and she seems happy there. The kids are even implied to visit her every now and then.
-   The **Care Bears** act friendly among themselves, and when visiting children. These bears would not give injuries; they would give someone a hug! This of course carries on to their Animated Adaptations- **Care Bears (1980s)**, **Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-Lot**, **Care Bears: Welcome to Care-a-Lot**, **Care Bears & Cousins**, and **Care Bears: Unlock the Magic**.
-   **The Cleveland Show** gives us Tim, a friendly bear that actually sits around and drinks beer with other, human characters. He's also devoutly religious and a bit of a stiff, albeit prone to the occasional Beware the Nice Ones moment when he remembers that he can kill any of them easily.
-   **The Crayon Box** has Bubby. He's a teddy bear, and a really nice one at that.
-   On **My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic**, Fluttershy has a bear among her many animal friends, named Harry, notable for being as expressive as her pet bunny Angel. She gives him chiropractic treatment, and he has tea with her.
-   **The Octonauts** gives us their leader, Barnacles Bear. Though he has a gruff, intimidating exterior, Captain Barnacles is as kind and understanding as they get.
-   **Avatar: The Last Airbender**:
    -   Bosco, the Earth King's pet bear from **Avatar: The Last Airbender**, may have been picked up from the wild, but he acts very friendly towards the heroes when he first sees them. He's considered extremely unusual due to the fact that he's a regular bear as opposed to a Mix-and-Match Critter that the series is known to have.
    -   Naga from **The Legend of Korra** also counts. She's a "polar bear dog" (part polar bear, part Big Friendly Dog), and is Korra's best friend.
-   The title characters from **Adventures of the Gummi Bears** are courageous, caring, faithful and friendly, as their theme song states.
-   Zigzagged by the character Beary Nice from **Uncle Grandpa**. He's a bright-eyed, bowtie-wearing bear with an overly friendly and calm disposition. It's not clear if he's oblivious to his friend Hot Dog Person's frequent suffering, or if he's secretly aware.

-   Penny Ling from **Littlest Pet Shop (2012)** is cute, but you don't want to make her upset or make her cry.
-   **Penguins of Madagascar** gives us Corporal, a polar bear and member of the skilled team of secret agents known as North Wind, who hugs and fawns over the penguins when he first meets them.
-   The main trio of **We Bare Bears** are a grizzly bear, a polar bear, and a panda who just want to adapt to human life in San Francisco. Of course, Hilarity Ensues.
-   Technobear from **Harvey Beaks** is a street-smart, party-loving bear cub who is one of Harvey's best friends and something of a KidAnova.
-   Ludovic the bear<small>◊</small> from the Dutch stop-motion series **Ludovic**.
-   **Goldie & Bear**, a Disney Junior series, features the title characters based on Goldilocks and the baby bear. Bear is very friendly and enjoys spending time and hanging out with Goldie.
-   **Humphrey the Bear** is clumsy and pesky sometimes but he is also friendly and very well-meaning who just tries to eat what he can, but he sometimes ends up a Butt-Monkey.
-   The title character from **The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin**, as well as the talking toy and series of books and tapes that it was based on, is nice, caring and friendly to everyone. The opening line from the first cassette tape (also used in one episode of the TV series) pretty much says it all:
    
    **Teddy Ruxpin**: Hi. My name is Teddy Ruxpin. Can you and I be friends?
    
-   In the **Gravity Falls** episode "Dipper vs. Manliness," Dipper is sent to prove his masculinity by killing the Multi-Bear, a bear covered in heads who offends the Manotaurs by being In Touch with His Feminine Side. He's a friendly guy, though he can still put up a fight; in the end, Dipper can't bring himself to kill him, because the Multi-Bear also loves his favorite girly, Guilty Pleasure pop song.
-   **Time Squad** had an episode where the team travels back in time to meet with Edgar Allan Poe, who has become a Sickeningly Sweet kids book writer. Instead of **The Black Cat**, he's written a story called **The Bear**, which is just about Poe taking a walk in the woods and accidently waking up a hibernating bear. Scared, he runs home and goes to bed, only for the bear to track him down and burst into his room... to return the fanny pack Poe dropped in the woods. The story ends with Poe and the bear hugging and becoming best friends forever. Time Squad are absolutely dumbfounded by the ridiculous story, complete with Jaw Drop.
-   The bear from **Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law**. He's never seen attacking anyone or even being mean. Indeed, his role at Sebben & Sebben (if he has one at all) is rather unclear. He mostly appears to assist other characters in bizarre tasks and for the various Oh, Cisco! moments. He'll also make random appearances with no context. One of the creators described him as "the most zen creature on earth". The only time he did anything remotely antagonistic was when Phil believed he was stealing his furniture, and even that might've just been Phil's delusions.
-   The **DuckTales (2017)** version of Santa Claus is a polar bear. In his debut episode, he only loses his temper when Scrooge delivers coal in place of presents when he was trying to resolve their past falling out.
-   In **The Simpsons** episode "Much Apu About Nothing", there is a bear wandering the neighborhood that, despite causing a panic, is not aggressive and makes zero attempt to attack anyone. At one point, it even dons a playful, dog-like expression.
-   Like his web series counterpart, Trinket, Vex's bear companion in **The Legend of Vox Machina**, is fierce to Vox Machina's enemies but very sweet to them and their friends. It doesn't take long for him to endear himself to some of the Sovereign's guards and get scritches.

Beary Friendly Example in Real Life

-   The Trope Codifier is the actual Teddy Bear, invented in 1902 in reference to an incident where Teddy Roosevelt refused to kill a bear that had been captured and tied up for him to "hunt."
-   Most bears are actually far less aggressive than the media often portrays, with bears actively seeking out humans as prey being rarely ever reported. Most are shy and inoffensive, and often retreat at the first sight of humans, and as long as you respect their space, keep at a proper distance, and avoid threatening them (as with any wild animal), they are of little concern. An injured or cornered bear, or a mother who perceives a threat to her cubs, however... Another common cause of attacks is hunger— (usually) not because the bear sees humans as food, but because it sees them as **competitors** for resources like carrion or pine nuts. In North America, at least, many attacks in the fall (when bears are desperate to put on weight before hibernating, and human hunters are "providing them" with freshly killed deer and elk) or spring (when they're desperate to regain the weight that they lost over the winter) stem from this issue.
    -   Funny enough, Pandas have always been immune to the usual depiction of bears, even though they're potentially just as dangerous as other bears are (though admittedly less **carnivorous** than other bears; in fiction they may be portrayed as entirely vegetarians, falling under Herbivores Are Friendly).
-   Despite being listed under Bears Are Bad News, Wojtek was well-known for being a friendly and lovable creature who loved to play in water and eat sweets (as well as his cigarettes and liquor — he **was** an official grunt in the Polish Army, after all!), and liked nothing better than hanging out with his adopted human family in the 22nd Artillery Supply Company. Of course, that also meant that **enemies** of his platoon (like the Nazi agent hiding in the showers) learned that Bears Are Bad News. The unit's insignia to this day is of Wojtek carting ammo.
    -   Wojtek wasn't the first enlisted bear in the history of the Polish military. During the Russian Civil War, the "Murmansk group", a Polish unit fighting on the Allied side, adopted a polar bear during their fight in the frozen wastes of northwestern Russia beyond the Polar Circle. A corporal was assigned to train it, and the bear quickly learned proper marching and military salute. Sadly, shortly upon the unit's return to Poland, the hapless animal ran away and was killed by local farmers. The bear's military duty didn't end this way, though, as it was stuffed and placed as an exhibit in the Polish Army Museum in Warsaw.

-   Hercules was a grizzly bear that belonged to Scottish wrestler Andy Robin and his wife Maggie. He lived in the house, ate cooked food (he wouldn't touch raw meat), and was so tame that he'd let people (usually Andy) ride around on his back. There was also an incident in 1980 where he ran away during the filming of a Kleenex advert in the Outer Hebrides and wasn't found for almost a month, during which time he lost half his body weight because he wouldn't kill and eat any of the livestock or wildlife in the area.
-   American indoor water park and resort "Great Wolf Lodge" has an adorable anthropomorphic bear cub named Brinley as one of the chain's main mascots.
