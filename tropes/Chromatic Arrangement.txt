Chromatic Arrangement: 
_"Down inside the computer are three lasers—a red one, a green one, and a blue one. They are powerful enough to make a bright light but not powerful enough to burn through the back of your eyeball and broil your brain, fry your frontals, lase your lobes. As everyone learned in elementary school, these three colors of lights can be combined, with different intensities, to produce any color that Hiro's eye is capable of seeing."_

The primary additive colors, or colors of light, are red, green, and blue. Just look at an old TV! Many writers and character designers seem to know this, as characters that are Color-Coded for Your Convenience tend to be gathered in the order of red, blue, and green at the beginning of the series.

Furthermore, it is usually the case that Red is the main character, Blue is the serious/uptight one, possibly The Smart Guy because Blue Means Smart One, and Green is the gentle/laid-back one, possibly The Big Guy.

However red, blue and _yellow_ are often understood to be the primary subtractive colors, or colors of pigment, (and yellow the fourth primary color of light according to some theories). So you may get an RBY team where yellow replaces green, or an RBGY team of four combining two typical trio arrangements.

Other team members may come later and in other colors, but red, blue, and green (and/or yellow) are usually first, or constitute a core unit themselves.

Also of note, the **true** primary subtractive colors are Cyan, Yellow, and Magenta. This is even less common as a Power Trio trope, though cyan may be lumped in as a type of blue, and magenta may be lumped as a type of red.

For slightly looser examples, you may get either deep orange or pink to replace red, (especially for girls in the latter case), or light orange to replace yellow. At the furthest stretch you may also see black replacing green.

A Sub-Trope of Color-Coded Characters.

Compare Rainbow Motif, which this trope has a tendency to grow into, and Red Oni, Blue Oni, which sometimes uses red and blue to mark the characters.

(This means something rather different in the world of Music; you'd have to Rearrange the Song with a Chord Progression involving more sharps and flats.)

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Advertising

-   A 2019 ad for the release of **Minecraft: Bedrock Edition** on the consoles of the time represents each player, via their clothes, room, and in-game character, with the color associated with the console they're playing on; the Nintendo Switch player is red, the Play Station 4 player uses blue, and the Xbox One player has green.
-   Snap, Crackle and Pop are designed with the yellow variant instead. Snap is given a yellow outfit, Crackle a blue one, and Pop a red one. Snap’s outfit was originally white, taking the three of them out of the arrangement, along with being the leader, normally the color red is associated with. There was a period in the Nineties where Snap wore blue and Crackle wore green, however.

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Anime & Manga

-   **Akazukin Chacha**: Chacha (red), Riiya (green), and Shiine (blue).
-   **Assassination Classroom**: The three main students in Class 3-E are Nagisa (blue hair), Kaede (green hair), and Karma (red hair).
-   **BB Senshi Sangokuden**: The Power Trio of Ryuubi (blue...well, "RX-78 colored", but a lot of blue), Kanu (green), and Chouhi (red).
-   **Black Clover**: Each member of the Third Eye seems to wear one of the primary colors over their clothing (or lack of it in the case of Vetto). Rhya, the smartest of the three, sports a light blue scarf, has dark blue clothes under his coat, and the sleeves and ends of his coat are also blue colored; Vetto, the group's battle-hungry powerhouse, is not only blonde, but the fur that covers his entire body is also yellow; and Fana, the quietest initially, but who harbors a terrible rage and hatred, has pink hair and wears a maroon dress under her robe. Not in vain, in the anime, when Licht explains Yami and Asta what the Third Eye are, the leaves of the clover that appears in his speech are colored blue, yellow and red.
-   **Bubblegum Crisis 2040**: Nene wears a red suit, Priss blue, and Linna a green one.
-   **Digimon Tamers**: Takato (red), Ruki (blue), and Jianliang (green) were met in that order and quickly became the Power Trio and main characters. Five more came in the second half of the series, some of whom were shoved into the roles thanks to Executive Meddling, but the main trio remain quite clearly the focal characters (the next most important Tamer after them, Juri, fits in that her Digivice was yellow). The trio even has their own image song called **Primary Colors**.
-   **Digimon Xros Wars: The Young Hunters Who Leapt Through Time**: The partner Digimon of the Xros Heart Power Trio fit the yellow variant of the arrangement: Shoutmon (red), Gumdramon (blue), and Damemon (yellow). Their partners' X Loader colours don't fit, sadly - while Taiki and Yuu do have red and yellow respectively, Tagiru's Loader is also red, instead of the obvious partner-matching choice.
-   **Digimon Ghost Game**: Gammamon's Champion-level evolutions fit this arrangement to go with their Stellar Name motif. BetelGammamon (red), WezenGammamon (green), and KausGammamon (blue) are named after stars of matching colors. True to their additive primary motif, their shared Ultimate-level is CanoWeissmon which is named after Canopus, the second-brightest individual star in the night sky. Fittingly, his evolution sequence to this form also invokes All Your Powers Combined. Meanwhile GulusGammamon is pitch-black, representing the absence of additive primaries.
-   **Dragon Ball Z**:
    -   During the Buu saga, the saiyans that infiltrated Babidi's ship were noticeably Red (Red/Orange Goku), Blue (Vegeta), and green (Gohan). And After Gohan's fight with Dabura, he was wearing all black.
    -   In the film Dragon Ball Super: Broly the three main characters of the film are built around this color arrangement as the last surviving full blooded Saiyans (after Broly's father Paragus dies): Goku in his classic Orange Gi, Vegeta is in his Saiyan armor with a blue tight suit, and Broly in a modified rendition of the Frieza force armor with a green pelt around his waist.
-   **Gundam Build Fighters Try**: Has this with the 3 main characters: Fumina has a yellow color scheme, Yuuma a blue one, and Sekai a red one. This palette is also shared by their respective Winning, Lightning and Build Burning Gundams.
-   **Hetalia: Axis Powers**: Features the Baltic Trio in this arrangement based on their costumes-Estonia (blue), Latvia (red), and Lithuania (green). Those colors are even present in their respective flags<small>◊</small> as<small>◊</small> well.<small>◊</small>
-   **THE iDOLM@STER**: The **Live For You** OVA has Haruka (red), Chihaya (Blue), and Miki (Green) as the main stars.
-   **Inuyasha**: In the first episodes, Inuyasha (red), with no problem being the Leader and the Big Guy simultaneously, Kagome (green)/Shippo(u) (green), who are both the Sweet Ones, and Miroku (blue), Chivalrous Pervert and the Smart Guy tied into one, travel together, and the color scheme continues. Sango joins and the colors are thrown off a bit, but not irrevocably. Her outfit is pink (close to red) and blue (a little), which is interesting because she's a mixture of the Brawn and the Calm One, and her cat's red... Not too shabby.
-   **Jewelpet**:
    -   **Jewelpet Twinkle☆** has Akari (pink), Miria (green) and Sara (blue), plus two less important guys who, while considered part of the team, have no specified color.
    -   **Jewelpet Happiness** has Chiari (pink), Nene (green) and Ruruka (blue). They wear the respective colors in casual clothes and in their maid outfits in the ED, and they have some personal objects of those colors.
-   **Kanon**: The school uniform ribbon colors are green for first year, red for second year, and blue for third year. Of the characters who go to school and wear the uniform, second-year Nayuki is introduced first, then third-year Mai, and finally first-year Shiori.
    -   **CLANNAD** uses the same color scheme for its students.
-   **Kishin Douji Zenki**: The villainous trio of Gulen (red), Gaula (blue), and Anju (green).
-   **Konosuba**: The four main characters are represented by a different color. Green for Kazuma, blue for Aqua, yellow for Darkness and red for Megumin.
-   **Macross Frontier**: Has this with Alto as Blue, Sheryl as Pink, and Ranka as Green.
-   **Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha**: While the two males got displaced after the first season, the original three protagonist mages were Nanoha (pink aura), Yuuno (green aura), and Chrono (blue aura), with Fate (yellow aura) only pulling a Heel–Face Turn near the end of the season.
-   **Magic Knight Rayearth**: The three primary colors are used extensively: Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu have red, blue, and green eyes and school uniforms, respectively (hair colors mostly match, but Fuu is blonde and Hikaru's hair in the manga is pink), while the three Rune Gods are set up the same way.
-   **Magi: Labyrinth of Magic**: Has Aladdin for blue, Morgiana for red, and Alibaba for yellow.
-   **Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch**: Lucia (pink), Hanon (aqua), and Rina (green), all in the first three chapters, and also in the first three episodes of the anime, although, in that, Rina didn't transform until the fourth episode. In the manga, Hanon was even called "blue" by mistake when the three were gathered (she's officially designated "aqua" to distinguish her from Noel, who's dark blue). Following them are Noel (dark blue/indigo), Caren (purple), Coco (yellow), and Sara/Seira (orange).
-   **Model Warrior Lily Cure**: The one-off Magical Girl parody on **Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei**, had Chiri in blue, Kafuka in pink/red, and Meru in green.
-   **Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation**: Rudeus' three love interests are the gentle green-haired Sylphiette, the intelligent blue-haired Roxy, and the fiery red-haired Eris.
-   **My Hero Academia**: Played with in the main student protagonists:
    -   Instead of red, there is orange which is the color associated with the hot-headed and brash Bakugo Katsuki. While Bakugo is the deuteragonist of the series he has serious main character syndrome with him referring to other characters as "extras" and straight up telling The Protagonist Midoriya he is the main character of this story. He has a lot of the traits usually associated with stock shonen anime protagonist.
    -   Blue is Todoroki Shouto, the tritagonist. He comes off aloof and hostile in the beginning of the series but later it turns out to be the case of him not having any friends when he was a child. Now, he considers both Midoriya and Bakugo his friends and while still quiet, it's just his calm and sometimes naive disposition.
    -   The Hero of the series Midoriya Izuku is green all-around with his hair, eyes, costume, and power. While he shows the traits of stock shonen protagonists often, he is also The Heart of the class and the trio with Bakugo and Todoroki. He acts like a mediator between the two quite often.
-   **Naruto**: The three members of Team 7 have this pattern. Their original outfits fit with Sasuke in blue, Sakura in red, and Naruto in orange. The same pattern fits their hair with Sasuke's being blue or black with blue tones, Sakura's pink, and Naruto's yellow. The pattern changes with regards to their eyes with Sasuke's red Sharingan, Sakura's green eyes, and Naruto's blue.
-   **Ojarumaru**: The Kooni Trio consists of blue-colored Aobee, yellow-colored Kisuke, and red-colored Akane.
-   **One Piece**:
    -   The top tier of the Straw Hat Pirates: Luffy, the leader, red; Zoro, the strongest, green; Sanji, the smartest (of the three, as shown in Skypea and Enies Lobby when he brings down Enel's ship and opens the gates, respectively), blue.
    -   The 3 Captains: Kidd (red; the most aggressive with the then highest bounty among Supernovas), Luffy (blue; the good guy) and Law (yellow; the laid-back) who made brief alliances outside the Slave Auction House during Sabaody Archipelago arc.
    -   The three pre-timeskip Admirals even have that as their codenames: **Ao**kiji (Blue Pheasant; uses ice and is reasonable), **Ki**zaru (Yellow Monkey; light user, relentless) and **Aka**inu (Red Dog; living volcano, Jerkass Knight Templar).
-   **PandoraHearts**:
    -   The main trio has Alice for red, Gil for blue, and Oz for both yellow and green combined.
    -   This also applies for the Pre-Tragedy of Sablier Trio: Lacie (red), Glen (blue), and Jack (green and yellow).
-   **Pokémon**:
    -   **Pokémon 2000**:
        -   Embodied by the three "titans"; Moltres (red), Articuno (blue), and Zapdos (yellow). When the energies from their respective treasures are combined, they form a green light with healing properties.
    -   **Pokémon Adventures**: The first set of main characters are named Red, Green, and Blue after the game versions (though which name applies to which character depends on the translation - long story), and Yellow is added later; though they don't necessarily wear the color they're named for. Later on, Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald star in the Generation III arc and they **do** wear their related colors.
    -   **Pokémon: The Original Series**:
        -   **Pokémon Emergency!**: Team Rocket forms a trio as Jessie (red) James (blue) Meowth (yellow) in that order of introduction during their motto performance.
        -   **The Breeding Center Secret**: Also forms a team of four with the hair color of their counterparts Cassidy (yellow) and Butch (green).
        -   **The Water Flowers of Cerulean City**: Misty's older sisters follow this pattern in their hair colors; Daisy (yellow), Violet (blue), and Lily (red).
        -   **The Wacky Watcher!**: Dr. Quincy T. Quackenpoker tags Magikarp with colored bands to indicate when they first left the Magikarp breeding ground of Rind Island: Red bands indicate one year ago, blue bands two, and yellow bands three.
        -   **Ariados, Amigos**: Students at the Pokemon Jujitsu Academy wear differently colored uniforms based on they classes they take; red for battle tactics (Ash), yellow for technical skill improvement (Brock), and blue for health and beauty (Misty, though she later regrets it).
-   **Powerpuff Girls Z**:
    -   The red-blue-green arrangement remains true for the three main characters in the anime spin-off.
-   **Sailor Moon** **loves** playing with this trope:
    -   Initially, the Power Trio of Moon (pink, more on that later), Mercury (blue) and Mars (red) doesn't fit the trope, but once the Inner Senshi round up and Moon starts making a category of her own, we also get Jupiter's green and Venus' yellowish-orange<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>. They remain the core group for the remainder of the series.
    -   The Outer Senshi – Uranus (navy), Neptune (turquoise), Pluto (black) and Saturn (purple) – don't fit this trope per se, but the anime gives Uranus and Pluto, respectively, golden/yellow and magenta/purple aura and powers, making a subtractive trio with Neptune (Saturn is a bit of a Sixth Ranger even to them, anyway).
    -   The villans do that a lot too, especially The Quirky Miniboss Squads which, being The Psycho Rangers counterparts to the Inner Senshi, often (but not always strictly) fit their colour schemes:
        -   The Ayakashi Sisters of the Black Moon Clan zigzag the trope, with Koan being more (cold) pink than red while her sisters fit their counterpart (Berthier's blue, Petz's green and Calaveras' yellow).
        -   Prince Demande's direct underlings fit the trope to a T, regardless of the Sensi: Rubeus is red, Esmeraude green, and Saphir blue.
        -   The Witches 5 of the Death Busters are those who follow the trope more closely, with Eudeal (red), Mimete (yellow), Tellu (green) and Viluy (blue), plus Cyprine/Ptilol (it's complicated)<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>.
        -   The Amazon Trio from the Dead Moon Circus are a straightforward cyan (Fisheye), yellow (Tiger's Eye), magenta (Hawk's Eye) subtractive ensemble.
        -   The Amazoness Quartet are, again, direct counterpars to the Inner Senshi, so we have Ves Ves (red), Palla Palla (blue), Jun Jun (green) and... Cere Cere<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>.
    -   Speaking of Quartet, in their senshi form from the manga, Sailor Vesta, Pallas and Juno are respectively red, light blue and green; only Sailor Ceres breaks the combo with pink.
    -   Sailor Moon herself is an interesting case, as her "official" colours are pink and silver-white, but her original fuku is blue and red (actually a very, very reddish and saturated dark magenta which appears red in several instances), while her visually striking long, blond hair provide the yellow for the traditional subtractive primaries. In her final form, her skirt has three layers, yellow, magenta and blue. Interestingly, her ultimate colour is white and, fittingly, many of her power ups and strongest attacks require All Your Colors Combined from her fellow Senshi.
-   **Shugo Chara!**: Does this with **one person** - well, one person and her Fusion Dance split personalities: Ran (red), Miki (blue), and Suu (green), "born" in that order. Yellow and white come later, following a long string of misunderstandings, self-doubt, and side switching in the fourth volume.
-   **Tokyo Mew Mew**: Ichigo, Minto, and Retasu are introduced in that order, and also awakened as Mew Ichigo (pink), Mew Mint (blue), and Mew Lettuce (green) in the same order. They are then joined by Bu-ling (yellow) and Zakuro (purple), and a Japan-only Play Station game includes a red Mew Mew, Ringo. The anime allows for some filler between these three episodes and the introduction of the others, but the first three are clumped together.
-   **Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-**: Mixes it up a bit but still follows the basic convention. Syaoran wears green and brown, Kurogane red and black, and Fai wears blue and white. Sakura, who wears pink, doesn't count as part of the fighting trio. She gets to kick ass later, though.
-   **Tweeny Witches**: Has Arusu for red, Sheila for blue, and Eva for both yellow and green combined.
-   **Vividred Operation**: The four main characters each possess a key of red, blue, green, or yellow, which materalize magical girl outfits of the same color.
-   **Welcome to the Ballroom**: The three main female dancers have this arrangement based on their dance costumes. Chinatsu, the main female protagonist, wears red. Shizuku, comparatively the most serious of the three, wears purple. Mako, the most soft-spoken and gentle of the three, wears yellow.
-   **Yes! Pretty Cure 5** averts the usual red-blue-green order, opting instead for something close to the typical rainbow spectum order - pink (Nozomi), red (with orange hair) (Rin), yellow (Urara), green (Komachi), blue (Karen), and a purple Sixth Ranger (Milk).
    -   One gets this trope if one goes by the characters' first **lines** instead of their proper introductions (pink, red, blue, green), but that might be stretching it.
-   **Yu-Gi-Oh!**:
    -   Several trios of Monster cards follow this pattern in their aesthetics
        -   The Egyptian Gods: Obelisk the Tormentor (blue), Slifer the Sky Dragon (red), and the Winged Dragon of Ra (yellow).
        -   The Three Musketeers of Face: Queen’s Knight (red), King’s Knight (yellow), and Jack’s Knight (blue).
        -   The Legendary Knights: Legendary Knight Timaeus (green), Legendary Knight Critias (blue), and Legendary Knight Hermos (red).
    -   Some trios of Magic/Spell cards also display this pattern
        -   Goddess Urd’s Verdict (yellow-haired), Goddess Verdande’s Guidance (pink-haired), and Goddess Skuld’s Oracle (blue-haired).

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Art

-   **The Ghent Altarpiece**: This Renaissance masterwork by brothers Hubert And Jan Van Eyck features God the Father (robed in red), St. John the Baptist (green), and the Virgin Mary (blue) as the central figures of its interior middle panel. Note that it was painted immediately before 1432, **just** making the trope demonstrably Older Than Print.
-   Terry Ananny: Some of her art features children in a red-blue-green clothes arrangement, like **Hockey**, or red-blue-yellow, like **Maple Sugar Time**.

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Asian Animation

-   **Jet and the Pet Rangers**: The "four colors" variant is used whenever the heroes are transformed, with Liksi, Gigi, Tiyang, and Jet having red, yellow, green, and blue helmets and suits respectively.
-   In **Motu Patlu**, the four main members of Motu and Patlu's gang wear color-coordinated clothes (Motu wears red, Patlu wears yellow, Dr. Jhatka wears green, and Ghasitaram wears blue).
-   In **Yamucha's-Kung Fu Academy**, Miko is blue, Nao is pink, and Jubby is yellow.
-   **YoYo Man**: The original four Yoyo Supermen; YoYo Man (yellow), Yamy (pink/red), Kube (green), and Fefe (blue).

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Card Games

-   Most Collectible Card Games with color coded factions use Chromatic Arrangement. The rest and change use a Light/Dark dichotomy. How much of this is due to the grandaddy using both is up for debate.
    -   Magic uses white, blue, black, red, and green. Blue is The Smart Guy. Red fits more with The Lancer (to white) than The Hero, though. Green can be The Big Guy, since green's only way of dealing with creatures is a contest of sheer power, because its mana acceleration is faster than any other color and bleeds into other colors.
-   **Star Trek**'s Customizable Card Game. The first three factions were Federation (blue), Klingon (red), and Romulan (green).

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Comic Books

-   **The DCU**: typically if the DC Trinity is together they are Superman - Red; Batman - Blue; Wonder Woman - Yellow. If they have a Green fourth it's either Aquaman (by his green pants) or Green Lantern for obvious reasons.
-   Die Abrafaxe from the German comic magazine **Mosaik** are a trio consisting of Abrax (the active one, blond) usually wearing red, Brabax (the smart one, red-haired) green, and Califax (the laid-back cookery expert, black hair) blue.
-   **Disney Ducks Comic Universe**: Donald Duck's nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie wear red, blue and green caps.
-   **The Mighty Thor**'s friends the Warriors Three are arranged like this, with Volstagg the Valiant in red, Fandral the Dashing in green, and Hogun the Grim in blue.
-   In **New Super-Man**, the Justice League of China's members fit this: New Super-Man's costume is red, Bat-Man's is blue, and Wonder-Woman's is green.
-   **ORPHANIMO!!**: the 3 male orphans perfectly fit this trope. Vic dresses in red and frequently takes the lead of the group, Sharp dresses in blue and is The Smart Guy, and Jay Jay dresses in green and, while not exactly laid back, tends to get less involved in the action than the others due to his young age.

-   **Sonic the Comic**: The Marxio Brothers have this colour scheme. Grouchio wears red overalls, Chicio wears blue and Harpio wears green.
-   In **Young Justice**, though their costumes are far from monochromatic, the writers generally use green, red, and blue as shorthands for Robin, Impulse, and Superboy, respectively. While Robin is the smartest of the trio he's also by far the most laid back in a combat situation while Superboy helps offset Imp's impulsive behavior.

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Eastern European Animation

-   In **Qumi-Qumi**, this makes up the colors of the three tribes: the Jumi-Qumi are blue, the Yumi-Qumi are pink, and the Schumi-Qumi are green. Both their tribe lands and the colors of their citizens use the respective colors.
-   In **Son of the White Horse**, yellow is for Fanyűvő, blueish-green for Vasgyúró, red for Kőmorzsoló, and the same for their respective princesses.

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Fan Works

-   In **Ah, Ataru's Goddess**, upon joining Ataru's harem, Belldandy, Shinobu and Lum get Bedlah Babe outfits. Belldandy wears blue, Shinobu wears pink and Lum wears yellow with tiger stripes.
-   A.A. Pessimal's **Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons** parody **When the War Is Over** examines, among other things, the logistic difficulty involved in not so much the recruitment as the **naming** of field agents in Spectrum. You need **hundreds** of field agents and, well, there really aren't all **that** many colour terms in the English language, or indeed actual **colours**, to name them after. Colonel White reflects, at length, on the extraordinary difficulties this posed.
    
    Oh yes. Colours. Once you get past the basic seven, things start to get a little tricky.
    
-   In **Ducktales: Twenty Years Later**, there's the canon examples of Huey (red), Dewey (blue) and Louie (green), but there's also Rosalina (red), Maria (blue) and Amalia (green), the nieces ( actually illegitimate daughters) of Jose Carioca.

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Films — Animation

-   **Alice in Wonderland**: Alice (blue) has this dynamic with the Mad Hatter (green) and the March Hare (red). This is especially prominent in the scene where she partakes in their tea party.
-   **An Extremely Goofy Movie**: Has Max as red, PJ as blue, and Bobby as green. Though Max and PJ have been wearing red and blue respectively since **Goof Troop**, Bobby was not wearing green in the first movie but white, and was also less apparently connected to the other two. Max is the main character, Bobby is completely laid-back, and PJ is the serious one.
-   **Beauty and the Beast**:
    -   A loose example is seen in the buxom blonde triplets known as the “Bimbettes”: Claudette wears a red dress, Laurette an amber (yellowish-orange) dress, and Paulette a green dress.
    -   When the transformed castle staff revert to their human forms, this is seen in the scattered light auras surrounding them; Lumiere glows blue, Cogsworth yellow, and Mrs. Potts pinkish-purple.
-   **Cars**: Both plays this trope straight and subverts it. Hero Lightning McQueen is red, racing legend Strip "the King" Weathers is blue, and villain Chick Hicks is green. The subversion occurs when they're introduced by the race announcers in the beginning of the movie, with The King introduced first and Lightning, being a rookie, introduced last.
-   **Coraline**: The title character wears blue, Miss Spink wears green, and Miss Forcible wears pink in the Other World circus scene.
-   **Frozen II**: Following the Arendelle harvest festival, the main characters retire to the palace for a game of charades: Kristoff wears blue pajamas with a matching dressing gown; Anna wears a leaf-green dress decorated with a pink ribbon; and Elsa wears a silky nightgown colored somewhere between red and mauve.
-   **Gnomeo & Juliet**: The two opposing sides are represented by red (for the Capulets) and blue (for the Montagues). The abandoned lot where the two main characters meet in secret is predominantly green, and the first character to approve of the union is Nannette the frog, also green.
-   **Hercules**: The Fates seem to align with this pattern: Clotho (spins the thread of life) is green; Lachesis (measures the thread) is blue; and Atropos (cuts the thread) is mauve.
-   **The Hunchback of Notre Dame**: Victor has a blue tint to his stone, Hugo has a green tint and Laverne has a red one.
-   The Big Bads of the first three **Kung Fu Panda** movies are represented by the colors blue (Tai Lung), red (Lord Shen), and green (Kai), respectively.
-   **Mulan**:
    -   The three dresses Mulan wore in her film are actually colored like this. In order of appearance, her first dress (also her default outfit, barring her training uniform and battle armor) is mostly green and yellow, her second dress (worn by her during her failed visit with the Matchmaker) is mostly pink and red, and her third and last dress (worn by her during the final battle against Shan Yu) is mostly blue and teal. They all sport similar blue bodices/corsets and red sashes around the waist and white underskirts.
    -   The three soldiers she befriends: Yao always wears red, Chien-Po always wears blue, and, as Mulan apparently fills the green quota in her soldier outfit, Ling always wears yellow.
-   **Mulan II**: Princesses Su, Mei, and Ting-Ting wear a different arrangement of colors: Su in yellow, Mei in magenta, and Ting-Ting in purple.
-   **Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost**: The stage costumes of the Hex Girls are red (Thorn, lead singer/guitarist), green (Dusk, drums), and purple (Luna, keyboard).
-   **Sleeping Beauty**: The three good fairies are Flora (red), Fauna (green), and Merryweather (blue).
    -   Subverted in **Sofia the First** where it turns out there **was** a fourth fairy, Miss Nettle (yellow), although she was a former pupil of the three mentioned until she became too ambitious.
-   **The Sword in the Stone**: Part of the plot involves Arthur and Merlin turning into squirrels. The former gets dark orange fur while the latter gets blue fur. The small female squirrel that falls in love with Arthur is red, as is the granny squirrel that pursues Merlin, although she leans more towards maroon.
-   **The Three Caballeros**: Panchito Pistoles (red), José Carioca (green), and Donald Duck (blue). Panchito leads, but only because it's his third of the movie (Donald starts solo before being joined by José, and then the two of them go see Pancho).
-   **Toy Story**: Buzz's voice buttons are in this arrangement.
-   **Turning Red**: The unicorn sticker on Mei's flute case has a yellow, red, and blue mane and tail.
-   **Wreck-It Ralph**: Ralph, Vanellope and Felix wear red, green and blue respectively. Calhoun also counts as yellow because of her hair, and the fireworks at the end.
-   **The Year Without a Santa Claus**: Mother Nature and her sons, Heat Miser and Snow Miser. Mother Nature wears green, Heat Miser wears red, and Snow Miser wears blue.

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Films — Live-Action

-   **3 Ninjas**: The first three films in the series don’t quite fit the trope, as the titular characters are dressed in green, blue, and yellow (though other characters may incorporate red in some way). The fourth film, **High Noon at Mega Mountain**, completes the trifecta with yellow being officially swapped for red in the opening sequence.
-   **Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy**: Utilizes this trope with the Cornetto ice cream the characters buy. **Shaun of the Dead** uses red (strawberry flavor), **Hot Fuzz** uses blue (Classic flavor), and **The World's End** uses green (mint flavor).
-   **Casper Meets Wendy**: For the big dance party at the Sunny Bright Resort, Wendy's aunts dress in chromatic gowns; Gert in pink, Fanny in yellow, and Gabby in blue.
-   **Hocus Pocus**: Played with in the wardrobes of the Sanderson sisters: Winifred, the only intelligent one/leader, wears green; Sarah, the most beautiful/flirtatious, wears purple; and Mary, the most naive/childlike, wears red.
-   **Hook**: When Peter is accidentally knocked off Captain Hook's ship into the water, three mermaids breath air into his mouth and bring him to the surface. The first one that appears has blue hair, the second red, and the third yellow-green.
-   **Jurassic Park (1993)**: The original film gives color-coded wardrobes to all of the characters in the initial party. Alan Grant wears blue, Ellie Sattler wears pink, John Hammond wears white, Ian Malcolm wears black, and Donald Genarro wears grey. In the context of the film, the color choices all clearly fit their roles: Grant and Sattler are the Official Couple who act as parental substitutes to Lex and Tim, Hammond and Malcolm have opposing ideological viewpoints, and Genarro is a neutral Amoral Attorney whom Hammond and Malcolm both try to sway to their side.
-   **The Last Duel**: Upon entering the city of Argentan, Sir Jean de Carrouges is wearing a blue-grey cloak and his wife Marguerite wears one in maroon. Their host, Crespin, is fully decked out in green.
-   **The Lord of the Rings**: All merchandise, including the special edition DVDs, was color-coded by film. **The Fellowship of the Ring** is green, **The Two Towers** is red, and **The Return of the King** is blue. Except, irritatingly, the Complete Recordings soundtracks: Fellowship is red, Towers blue, King green.
    -   The four hobbits of the Fellowship are dressed this way; Frodo (red), Sam (yellow), Merry (green, though he also wears his trademark yellow waistcoat), and Pippin (blue).
-   **Love's Labour's Lost**: Kenneth Branagh's 2000 film adaptation did this with the clothing of the four main couples (the man's buttonhole ribbon or tie and the woman's dress and hair-ribbon): red for the King and the Princess, blue for Berowne and Rosaline, green for Longaville and Maria, and orange for Dumaine and Katherine.
-   **Speed Racer**: According to Word of God (e.g. Speed - Blue, Pops - Red, Trixie - Pink, Racer X - Black).
-   **Star Dust**: The primary antagonists are three witch sisters who display this trope in their wardrobe; Lamia (green), Mormo (purple), and Empusa (red).
-   **Star Wars**:
    -   The cover posters for the Special Editions of the Original Trilogy (painted by Drew Struzan) followed this trope explicitly. **A New Hope** was colored a reddish orange, **The Empire Strikes Back** was a purplish blue, and **Return of the Jedi** was a yellowish green. It even practiced **character** arrangement, as all of the primary heroes were on the first poster, the villains on the second, and the ancillary heroes on the third. They can be seen here<small>◊</small>.
    -   The battle droids of the Trade Federation (seen most prominently in **The Phantom Menace** and related materials) loosely follow this pattern; while standard infantry droids are all white, pilot droids display blue accents, security droids red, and command officer droids yellow.
    -   Until **Attack of the Clones**, red, blue and green were the only lightsabre colours to exist. Red always belonged to villains who were usually leaders within their factions. The most prominent blue users are Obi-Wan, Anakin, Luke (in his early days) and Rey, all of whom are noble, but with anger issues (though in Obi-Wan's case it's more about him being uptight). The most prominent green users are Qui-Gon, Yoda and Luke (in his later days), all of whom are wiser and more laid back.
-   **Strippers Vs. Werewolves**: At one point, Franklyn and Dani are approached by a trio of teenagers who Franklyn hired to deal with a car containing a werewolf's corpse. The two boys are dressed one in red and one in green, and the one girl is dressed in blue.

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Jokes

-   There are three women standing on a streetcorner; one has red hair, another has blue hair, and the third has green hair. A succession of men ask each one why their hair is that color, to which the reply is "it's natural" and the lady running her hands through her hair. Green hair sneezes into her hand first.

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Literature

-   **Belgariad**: Each of the seven gods and anything associated with them are a specific colour. Not surprisingly, the most explicitly good god is blue, and the evil god is red. Their father is white.
-   **Dungeons & Dragons**: The derivative series **Dragonlance** employs this trope in a rather bizarre (but amusing) manner. The cover art color schemes of trilogies written by primary authors Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis are always red for the first book, blue for the second book, and green for the third. Individual books and series of books written by other authors, set in the same world, are immune to this trope. This made sense in the first trilogy in that Red=Autumn, Blue=Winter, and Green=Spring.
-   **Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire**:
    -   The three initial Triwizard Tournament champions (minus the 11th-hour addition of Harry himself) loosely align with this pattern: Durmstrang Institute students wear blood-red robes, Beauxbatons Academy students wear pale blue, and the primary color of Hufflepuff - Hogwarts’ champion Cedric Diggory’s house - is yellow.
        -   Also plays out in the dragons each champion faces in the First Task of the tournament (again, minus Harry): The blue-grey Swedish Short-Snout, the Welsh Green, and the red Chinese Fireball.
-   **The Hunger Games**:
    -   Katniss Everdeen’s prep team loosely aligns with this; Venia’s hair is dyed bright aqua, Flavius sports orange corkscrew curls, and Octavia’s skin is colored green.
    -   Although designs vary by edition/publication, the covers of each book generally feature some variation on a yellow (**The Hunger Games**), red (**Catching Fire**), and blue (**Mockingjay**) color scheme.
        -   With the publication of the tie-in novel **The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes**, green is added to complete the arrangement. In that novel, Lucy Gray Baird's dress in the 10th Hunger games is composed pink, yellow, and blue ruffles.
-   **A Song of Ice and Fire**: Daenerys Targaryen's dragons are Drogon (red and black), Rhaegal (green and bronze), and Viserion (yellow/gold and cream).
-   **Toads and Diamonds**: In the Charlotte Huck version (illustrated by Anita Lobel), protagonist Renée is dressed in blue, her stepmother in yellow, and her stepsister Francine in red.
-   X-Wing Series: In **Starfighters Of Adumar**, the four pilots of Red Flight pick four sets of Adumari formalwear for their first public appearance. The leader, Wedge, is partly in green. The noble intellectual one, Tycho, is mostly in blue. The team's cynic, Hobbie, is in many clashing colors but predominantly red, and their showoff, Wes, has a purple cloak.

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Live-Action TV

-   **3-2-1 Contact**: The numbers on the title card are designed this way.
-   **Babylon 5**: The Babylon stations themselves, with the eponymous B5 blue, Babylon 4 green, and the original station red. The other two stations were never shown onscreen, though Word of God is that that B2 was orange and B3 was yellow.
-   **Big Bad Beetleborgs**:
    -   The show used this for the first set of powers the heroes had, with Blue Stinger as the leader, Green Hunter, and Red Striker.
    -   Also, the villains. The Magnavores are Typhus (green), Noxic (blue), and Jara (red). When the series became **Metallix**, we had the Crustaceans: Nukus (red), Horribelle (green), and Vilor (blue).
-   **Don't Hug Me I'm Scared**: The three main characters are Red Guy, who is red, Duck, who is green, and Yellow Guy, who is yellow with blue hair.
-   **The Flash (2014)**: Most speedsters, such as the Flash, leave behind yellow lightning when they run. Those who overdose on Velocity 9 produce blue lightning. The Reverse-Flash leaves behind **red** lightning for some reason, as does the Rival. Finally, Savitar produces bluish-white lightning.
-   **Kamen Rider**:
    -   **Kamen Rider Blade**: The three human Riders are Blade (blue), Garren (red), and Leangle (green), while the wild card, Chalice, is primarily black as is his true form, the Joker Undead.
    -   The main three Riders in **Kamen Rider Hibiki** are Hibiki (purple with red trim), Ibuki (blue), and Todoroki (green).
    -   **Kamen Rider Decade**, which has photography as one of its running motifs, sticks to this trope most of the way. Decade's armor is primarily magenta, while The Rival Diend's is cyan. No green Rider ever came along, and by the end, Rising Ultimate Kuuga took the trope back into pigments by being gold (yellow) and black, while Kivaala added white for good measure.
    -   In **Kamen Rider Gaim**, three of the four main characters are Gaim (blue), Baron (red), and Ryugen (green). The fourth, Zangetsu, is white; which complements the other three yet also helps to distance him from them.
    -   The Riders of **Kamen Rider Ghost** are Ghost (orange in his basic form, red in an upgraded version), Specter (blue), and Necrom (green). One of the tie-in movies includes a trio of evil Necroms in red, blue, and yellow; whose colors complement both the regular Necrom (green) and their boss Dark Ghost (white). The series briefly had Necrom's sister become a pink Necrom, which turned the whole thing into a Super Sentai Shout-Out.
    -   In **Kamen Rider Ex-Aid**, the lead Riders are Ex-Aid (hot pink), Brave (blue), and Snipe (green). At different points in the series, they're joined by either Kamen Rider Lazer (yellow), Kamen Rider Genm (black or white, depending on which form he uses), or both.
    -   **Kamen Rider Amazons**: Across both seasons, the protagonists are the green Amazon Omega, red Amazon Alpha, and blue Amazon Neo.
    -   In **Kamen Rider Saber**, the lead Riders are Saber (red), Blades (blue), and Espada (yellow). However, Espada is Put on a Bus at the end of the first arc and then returns with a different (and differently-colored) powerset. He eventually reclaims the Espada title, but the trio is still broken up for a good half of the show's run. In addition, when a Rider uses the **Three Little Pigs**\-based powerup, the piglets wear red, green, and yellow.
    -   Many Kamen Riders have a one-man version of this through Multiform Balance, color-coding their basic pre-upgrade forms red, green, blue, and one or two other colors depending on how many forms they have:
        -   Kuuga and Kiva have red as the default, along with blue, green, and purple.
        -   Den-O is similar; but has red, blue, **yellow**, and purple.
        -   OOO has red, green, blue, yellow, and white for his single-color combinations.
        -   Wizard's color set is red, blue, green, and yellow.
-   **M\*A\*S\*H**: The three Swamp dwellers are Hawkeye Pierce (wears a red robe), BJ Hunnicutt (wears a blue robe) and Frank Burns (rarely seen out of standard-issue army green).
-   **The Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nóg**: Tyrune, the Three-Headed Hydra of Temra, breathes different-colored fireballs from each head; blue from the left, green from the right, and orange from the center.
-   **Nick Arcade**: The evil wizards are Merlock (blue), Scorchia (red), and Mongo (green).
-   **Smallville**: Clark is blue, Oliver is green and Bart is red.
-   **Star Trek**:
    -   **Star Trek: Deep Space Nine** moved into a more subtle use, with most of the uniform in black and/or grey and the shoulders and neck in color to designate the specialty. Most fans have agreed this looks less silly than the uniforms of TOS or Next Gen, but still keeps the beloved color coding intact.
    -   **Star Trek: Enterprise** switched back to the TOS-era colors, though this time officially using gold instead of green. In this case, due to the earlier era, the uniforms were astronaut-blue flight suits, with department-colored piping around the shoulders.
    -   **Star Trek: The Next Generation** and later series picked this back up (although several flashbacks indicate it as a recent development, with Picard wearing the red uniform of the TOS movies in his own cadet days) but with Red designated for command and Gold for engineering and security.
    -   **Star Trek: The Original Series**: Science blue, Engineering red, and Command green. Due to color technology of the time, the "green" showed up as the famous "Command gold" on television, and so it has been remembered ever since, but a relic of this can be seen both in Kirk's famous wraparound shirt<small>◊</small> and in TOS-era dress uniforms<small>◊</small> (a la the episode "Court Martial").
        -   Dropped in the TOS movies in favor of the less silly looking red uniforms.
-   **Super Sentai**/**Power Rangers**:
    -   When a team has a Power Trio starting setup, said trio is always a Red Ranger, a Blue Ranger, and a Yellow Ranger. And for the more common Five-Man Band setup, nearly every series has those three plus some combination of Green, Black, Pink, and White Rangers (pick two) - in most cases, one is Pink and the other is either Green or Black.
        -   Played with in **Kaitou Sentai Lupinranger VS Keisatsu Sentai Patranger**. The Lupinrangers have the primary trio of Red, Blue, and Yellow; but the Patrangers don't — they have their own Red and then pick up colors the Lupins don't use, Green and Pink.
    -   Doctor Hinelar from **Denji Sentai Megaranger** has three subordinates whose main color fit this to a T: Shibolena is blue, Yugande is green and Bibidebi (main color) is red (and white). **Power Rangers in Space** substitutes Shibolena and Bibidebi with Astronema (who usually has blue hair) and Elgar (whose outfit is mainly red).
    -   The three Highness Dukes from **Hyakujuu Sentai Gaoranger** fit: Shuten is red, Ura is green, and Rasetsu is blue. Naturally, their **Power Rangers Wild Force** counterparts, the Org Generals, also fit: Retinax is red, Nayzor is green, and Mandilok is blue.
-   **Tots TV**: Tom has blue hair and a blue telephone, Tilly has red hair and a red telephone, and Tiny has green hair and a green telephone.

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Multiple Media

-   Nearly all **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles** media color-codes the turtles as Leonardo wearing blue, Raphael in red, Michaelangelo sporting orange (filling in for the standard yellow), and Donatello with purple.

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Mythology & Religion

-   The three Abrahamic religions roughly fit this trope:
    -   Judaism places strong emphasis on the symbolism of blue, and the blue pigment known as **tekhelet** has long been used in various religious articles.
    -   Islam uses green to describe the vegetation and ornaments of Paradise (often portrayed as a garden), and today many countries with Muslim-majority populations incorporate green into their national flags.
    -   Christianity is more complex, as red can be used to symbolize ostensibly good things - such as the blood of Christ and martyrdom - but can also be used to indicate sin and evil desires. Although red is sometimes used to distinguish the words of Jesus in printed versions of The Bible, readers are also warned of a red dragon in the Book of Revelation.

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Tabletop Games

-   **LEGO Games**: The robots in **Robo Champ** are green, red, and blue.

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Theater

-   In **Hamilton**, the Schuyler sisters are this:
    -   Angelica, the oldest and the wittiest, wears red;
    -   Eliza, the sweet and innocent one, wears blue;
    -   Peggy, the youngest and quietest, wears yellow.
-   **Heathers**: the main clique does a slight variation of this. Since there are four members instead of three, both green and yellow are represented, but otherwise the pattern fits the standard.
    -   Heather Chandler, the leader of the clique and the most aggressive and intimidating, wears red.
    -   Heather Mc Namara, the meekest of the group (and eventually revealed to be the nicest), wears yellow.
    -   Heather Duke, the Beta Bitch who is jealous of Heather Chandler's status as the leader, wears green.
    -   Veronica Sawyer, the protagonist, the most melancholic, and the foil to Heather Chandler, wears blue.

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Toys

-   **Foam and Color Barbie**: Although advertised primarily with pink hair coloring foam, the doll also came in yellow and blue varieties.
-   **Mixels**:
    -   The three "headliner" tribes for its first year are the red fire-based Infernites, the blue ice-based Frosticons, and the green slime-based Glorp Corp. These tribes are given extra highlights compared to the other tribes, such as promotions and a second wave of characters in the second year.
    -   The three tribes of wave four are the aforementioned second wave of Infernites, the green astronaut-based Orbitons, and the blue light-based Glowkies.
    -   The three "headliner" tribes of its last year are the blue police-based MCPD, the red firefighter-based MCFD, and the green sanitation-based Trashoz.

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Video Games

-   Blue P1, Red P2 has been the standard for both cooperative and vs. games since the NES era. When N64 caused a need to stretch this convention to four players, they added green and yellow, though there are more examples of RBYG order than there ever was of BR order.
-   In many First-Person Shooter games and most Real-Time Strategy games, the default colors are red and blue. If there's a third team (generally a neutral team or a computer-controlled ally), they are green.
    -   Averted in the original **Command & Conquer**: Nod had red buildings and blue units, but the GDI was yellow; **Tiberian Sun** and **Tiberium Wars** cut blue out almost entirely (although blue made a cameo in TS as a Nod splinter group commanded by a GDI double agent); and Yuri's faction and the Scrin in **Yuri's Revenge** and **Tiberium Wars**, respectively, were purple. Green was never used at all for a faction color in any of the C&C games (**Generals** isn't really a C&C game).
    -   In **StarCraft** (one), other than randomly assigned team colors, Zerg were purple-brownish, Terrans were silvery chrome, and Protoss were golden.
    -   In **Star Trek: Armada II**, the Federation is represented on the minimap by white, Borg by dark green, and Romulans by light green.
    -   In the **Command & Conquer: Red Alert Series**, the Allies are always blue and the Soviets are, well...take a wild guess...
    -   **Command & Conquer: Generals** pits the USA (blue) and China (red) against the GLA (green). A minor subversion, in that blue and red are atypically fighting together against the third party.
    -   A more typical example is in **Dune II**, which inspired Command & Conquer - the blue Atreides, red Harkonnens, and green Ordos all fight each other. Even though the original book specifically states that the Harkonnens are blue and the Atreides are green or red.
        -   Red, cubist Harkonnens are featured in the Mini-series as well, though House Corrino is Gold and Blue and Atreides is Green and Brown.
-   The Wright Anything Agency from **Ace Attorney** is made up of the attorneys Phoenix Wright (blue), Apollo Justice (red) and Athena Cykes (yellow).
    -   Alternatively, Phoenix, Edgeworth, and Larry Butz make up the blue/red/yellow-orange trinity. This is especially fitting, given their background as childhood friends. Detective Gumshoe could stand in for the green part of the arrangement as well.
-   **Advance Wars**:
    -   The heroes of the Orange Star army are introduced in order of Andy (Red), Max (Blue), and Sami (Green).
    -   The nations also usually follow this order in the campaigns. Player one is red, 2 is blue, 3 is green, 4 is yellow, 5 is black (only in the third game, and there are a only 4 players max.; the turn order stays that way). Days of Ruin, on the other hand, ditched green for black.
-   In **Bishi Bashi**, each player gets a set of red, green, and blue buttons, alongside a yellow start button.
-   Your first three party members in **Blaze Union** are Garlot (protagonist, red), Siskier (The Heart, aqua green), and Jenon (The Smart Guy, blue).
-   **Bomb Club**: The four members of the titular club are color-coded based on the CMYK model, with Ian being Cyan, Maggie being Magenta, Jon being Yellow and Blake being Black.
-   In **Bonk's Adventure**, Bonk's normal form wears red, his second form wears blue, and his third form wears green.
-   **Cytus** has the "Eyes" series of songs: "Red Eyes", "Green Eyes", and "Blue Eyes".
-   In **Darius Twin**, when you're playing 2-player co-op, Player 1 is Red and Player 2 is Blue. In Single-player mode, the player is Green.
-   **Defend Your Castle**:
    -   The three spells use red, yellow and blue icons. The "Kill" spell uses a red icon, the "Detonate" spell uses a yellow icon and the "Convert" spell uses a blue icon.
    -   Three of the castle's four towers have a yellow, red and green flag. The remaining tower has a blue roof.
-   The four party members of **Deltarune** follow this trope, with Kris being blue, Susie being magenta, and Ralsei being green, with Noelle adding yellow as a Guest-Star Party Member.
-   The magic system of **Disgaea** and other Nippon Ichi titles is based on this: Fire (Red), Wind (Green), and Ice (Blue)
    -   And in the first game, the main characters themselves follow this: Laharl primarily wearing red, Etna wearing black, and Flonne having blue here and there on her outfit. (though from the second game onward, they're all red.)
-   The **DoDonPachi** series does this with all of its games (minus DaiOuJou): The three main types of ships are the red Type-A "Deltasword" (straight-forward shot), the green Type-B "Biaxe" (turning shot), and the blue Type-C "Spearhead" (wide shot). This extends to the playable characters of **DoDonPachi SaiDaiOuJou** as well.
-   **Dragon Age**:
    -   The three main protagonists of the series thus far are the Warden Hero of Ferelden (blue), Hawke the Champion of Kirkwall (red), and the Herald of Andraste/Inquisitor (green).
    -   On a meta level, the icons for each of the games correspond to their respective colors: the icon for **Origins** features the Grey Warden crest with blue as a prominent color, the icon for **Dragon Age II** is the red sigil of Kirkwall, and the icon for **Inquisition** is the symbol of the Inquisition, tinged green presumably by the light of the Breach.
-   **Dragon Quest II** has its characters follow this set up: the Prince of Lorasia wears blue, the Prince of Cannock wears green, and the Princess of Moonbroke wears (a dark shade of) pink.
-   The Koei series **Dynasty Warriors** assigns the three colors to Wu, Wei, and Shu: red, blue, and green respectively. Later, when Jin becomes a separate faction, they are color-coded yellow.
-   The three artifacts in **Eternal Darkness** are Red, Blue, and Green. That's also the generally agreed upon progression of difficulty levels (based on how early or late you get the healing spell). The Ancients and their associated magic and monsters also follow this color scheme, with Mantorok as the fourth Purple member, and an unknown Yellow fifth Ancient existing.
-   **Fire Emblem** also uses this at the beginning of most games with the main lords wearing blue, followed by a pair of red and green knights. Other examples that don't fit that mold:
    -   The three Pegasus Sisters of the Akaneia series are Catria (blue) Palla (green) and Est (Pink)
    -   **Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War** has the traditional example with Sigurd (blue) and his red and green knights (Alec and Naoise), but it also has the secondary theme with old friends Sigurd, Eldigan (red), and Quan (yellow), which is then carried on by their sons Seliph, Ares, and Leif.
    -   The three lords of **Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade** were colored in this way (in their hair). Eliwood, red; Hector, blue; Lyndis, green. Lyn and Hector are swapped in terms of stereotypes, though, with Lyn being the closest to the Smart One and Hector being The Big Guy.
    -   **Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance** subverts the lord and two knights of does this with Ike (blue), the green knight Oscar, and his brother a red axe fighter, Boyd. By the time the proper red knight, Kieran, appeared, both he and Oscar were minor characters.
        -   However Ike, the commander, Soren, the tactician, and Titania, the deputy commander continue to represent blue, green, and red respectively, as the leaders of the Greil Mercenaries. Mist is a Yellow fourth by the color of her dress and as the only other Greil mercenary character to continue to even show up in cut-scenes by the end of the game.
    -   **Fire Emblem: Awakening**: After the first four main characters that always show up in cut-scenes are introduced, the next four regular characters are Sully (red), Virion (blue), Stalh (Green) and Vaike (Yellow) in that order.
    -   **Fire Emblem: Three Houses**: The main lords of the three houses and the houses themselves. The Empire and Edelgard are red. The Kingdom and Dmitri are blue. The Alliance and Claude are yellow. Despite the church having a silver emblem, Byleth and the leaders of the church (Rhea, Seteth etc) all have striking green hair to complete the trope.
    -   **Fire Emblem Heroes** does this with the franchise's signature weapon triangle - swords are red, lances are blue, and axes are green. (Bows, daggers, and staves being generally colorless.)
-   **The Formula**: A-Power is red, B-Power is blue, and C-Power is green.
-   The three main protagonists of **Gem Smashers** are Bau (a red hermit crab), Bam (a yellow chick), and Bom (a blue hedgehog).
-   The Flash game Georganism has three main characters. One is blue, one is green, and one is red.
-   **Ginga Fukei Densetsu Sapphire** has Sapphire White (blue, obviously), Charotte Syphon (orange/purple), Helena Evangelin (green) and Jasmin Willoung (red), each with hair, suit and ship in the same colors.
-   **God Hand** has the Three Evil Stooges, who follow this with their clothes and health bars, Felix being blue, Bruce being green and Conchita being red.
-   In **Golden Axe**, of the three main protagonists, Tyris-Flare wears red, Ax-Battler wears blue, and Gilius-Thunderhead wears green.
-   The "yellow/blue/red" pattern is used in two **Grow** games.
    -   For the three potions in **Grow Island**.
    -   For the three Grow books in **Grow Maze**.
-   **Guild Wars 2**:
    -   The three main Asuran Colleges which have a signature color: Dynamics (Blue), Statics (Red/Pink), and Synergetics (Green).
    -   Scarlet Briar based her final series of weapons on the Colleges. Her three Assault Knights utilized this color scheme as did the three holograms created by her Prime Hologram.
-   **Hidden City**: Kira Woodville, Rayden Storke and Carlos Light are three of Mr. Black's most important subordinates who wears red, blue and green respectively, although, unlike the former two, Carlos is a lamplighter rather than an agent. Besides Rayden and Kira, the only other agent given an on-screen appearance is Agent 032, who shares the exact same colour scheme as Carlos.
-   **Ib** has three main characters who hold roses throughout most of the game. Ib, Garry and Mary have a red, blue and yellow rose respectively.
    -   The Headless Statues in the game also come in red, yellow and blue variants.
-   Eco in the **Jak and Daxter** series is color coded this way, with red, blue, green, yellow, purple (dark) and white (light) Eco existing.
-   The three playable characters in **Kamiko** are Yamato (blue hair), Uzume (green cloak), and Hinome (red hair).
-   **Kingdom Hearts**:
    -   When leveling up, the characters are represented by the colors that they most frequently wear: Sora is red, Donald is blue, and Goofy is green. Sora also came first, with Donald and Goofy following. (And Donald even fell onto Sora's back in their first meeting a split-second before Goofy did!) The additional characters are always represented as yellow.
    -   Riku's costumes have a good amount of blue to contrast with Sora's red, but they also always prominently feature yellow, possibly following this trope. Kairi, meanwhile, wears a mix of white and purple in the first game, then switches to a pink outfit.
    -   In **Birth by Sleep**, Terra is red-orange, Ventus is green, and Aqua is blue.
-   **The King of Fighters**: The pigment color pattern is used for three rather important to the plot of the NESTS Chronicles characters associated with NESTS's cloning experiments and their respective Power Limiters: K' has a red glove, Kula has yellow gloves, and K9999/Krohnen has a blue glove.
-   **Kirby**:
    -   **Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards** has Pix, which is made up of three floating hologram-casting crystals that are red, green, and blue. **Kirby: Planet Robobot** avoids this, though, as the game's follow-up to Pix has four crystals that are rose, teal, orange, and yellow/white.
    -   In **Kirby: Squeak Squad**, Daroach's Triple-Star Rod has the powers of Fire, Ice, and (presumably) Spark, which are represented as Red, Blue, and Green floating stars respectively. The pattern also appears elsewhere throughout the game: the Ability Scrolls, Meta Knight's attacks, and the Final Boss.
-   **The Legend of Zelda**:
    -   Its pantheon is composed of three goddesses represented by the three colors, and the Plot Coupons (and often other items) that you have to find are always either only these colors or you have to find these colors first. Din, goddess of power, is red and representative of Ganon, the Big Bad. Farore, goddess of courage, is green and representative of Link, the protagonist. Nayru, goddess of wisdom, is blue and representative of Zelda, princess of Hyrule and Damsel in Distress. Originally, green—the Triforce of Courage—was not included in the game. It could be argued they originally represented Red Oni, Blue Oni first.
    -   **The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past**: Most enemy soldiers wear green (weak), blue (stronger), or red (strongest) armor, although there are a few colored gold and grey.
    -   In **Twilight Princess** , the Ordonian children Talo, Malo and Beth, are usually seen together. They are in that order clad in blue, green and red.
    -   The four Links in **The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords** and **The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures** wear green, red, blue and purple respectively. **The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes** narrows it down to the traditional green, red and blue trio.
    -   The games of the "Wilds" sub trilogy fit this with their marketing themes and artwork; **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild** (blue), **Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity** (red), and **The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom** (green).
-   **Lit (2021)**: Your primary upgrades involve the three primary colors: red, green, and blue. You eventually unlock the colors used in printing: yellow, cyan, and magenta.
-   The **Lufia** series, displaying this trope most strongly in the earlier games. Red-haired hero, green-clothed tough guy, blue-haired somber magic users. The third installment, The Legend Returns, seems to have noticed this and turned it into an aspect of gameplay which, oddly, didn't often correspond to character color themes.
-   In **MAG**, the three PMCs follow this, with Raven being blue, SVER being red, and Valor being green.
-   In **Marble Madness**, the Left Player (P1) was blue, the Right Player (P2) was red, and the enemy marble was black.
-   **Mega Man** is blue, Proto Man is red, and Bass is black.
    -   In the **Megaman Zero** and **Megaman ZX** series, most of the bosses are color coded this way according to their element, typically being red for fire, blue for ice, green or yellow for electricity, and purple for non-elemental. The Four Guardians are a notable example, with Harpuia being green, Leviathan being blue, Fefnir being red and Phantom being black.
-   The three playable characters of **Metamoqester** fit the pattern: Tenchimaru wears blue, Yukihime wears red, and Kaiohmaru wears green.
-   **Monster Hunter** has color-coded tiers of sharpness, with purple being the most powerful and red the least (the colors in-between are, in rising strength order: Orange, yellow, green, blue and white). Sharpness is one of the factors that decide damage output, and it also determines if your attack will cleanly cut or bash an enemy or bounce off, with purple being "the number of things in this game that will bounce your weapon off can be counted on one hand." The full gauge of a weapon's sharpness, where all available colors in its endurance can be seen, is visible from the Equipment submenu.
-   The three trap books of **Myst** are blue, red, and green. Sirrus (red) and Achenar (blue) blame each other for the death of Atrus, and neither want you to touch the green book, which they claim is a trap to prevent them from being freed...because Atrus is trapped in the green book, and Sirrus and Achenar were working together.
-   **Pikmin**:
    -   The three kinds of Pikmin that appear in the first game are Red, Yellow and Blue Pikmin. These are considered the "main" three types and appear more often than the others in various spinoff material, such as being the only colors of Pikmin available in the **Pikmin**\-themed minigame of **Nintendo Land**.
    -   The three captains in the third game's story mode are composed of Alph who has a blue suit, Brittany who has a magenta suit and Charlie who has a green suit.
-   **Pokémon** is all about this. The three starter Pokémon of every game, as well as three generations of the games, are all based upon red (Fire), blue (Water), and green (Grass). The first gen also added a yellow fourth with Pikachu.
    -   And, of course, the original first generation games were Red and Green, followed by Blue, then Yellow. Releases outside Japan were Red<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> and Blue, followed by Yellow. Various generations follow this in their names or their mascots:
        -   The third generation Ruby (red), Sapphire (blue), and Emerald (green).
        -   Gen IV loosley with Diamond (baby blue), Pearl (pink), and Platinum (golden yellow and gray).
        -   The eyes of Gen V's mascots, Zekrom (a red-eyed black dragon), Reshiram (a blue-eyed white dragon), and Kyurem (a yellow-eyed gray dragon).
        -   The main legendary Pokémon in **Pokémon X and Y** are Xerneas (blue), Yveltal (red), and Zygarde (green). Note that this does not extend to the games themselves, as while Xerneas and Yveltal are the mascots of X and Y respectively and share their color schemes with their games, a **Pokémon Z** game starring Zygarde never emerged.
    -   The first of Eevee's evolutions, the legendary bird trio, Generation II's roaming beast trio, and the lake trio in Generation IV are all red, blue, and yellow.
    -   The Striaton City Gym Leaders in **Pokémon Black and White** are a Power Trio of triplets who follow this trope, and their signature monkey Pokemon do, too.
-   **Quake Team Fortress** is one of the few FPSes supporting more than two color-coded teams. The actual number of teams is based on the map design, and since most maps are two-team affairs, red and blue are the most commonly seen colors. However, the conventional colors of the third and fourth team are, of course, green and yellow. The first map to use this convention was 4fort4.
    -   **Unreal Tournament** follows the same scheme.
    -   **Supreme Commander** has the green Aeon, the red Cybran, and the blue UEF. Further, in multiplayer, you're allowed to choose your color...except in ranked 1-on-1 matches, in which one player is red and one is green. Finally, a game that understands proper color opposition...
-   The three rival gangs in **Saints Row: The Third**; The Morningstar's color is red, the Deckers are colored blue, and the Luchadors are colored green.
-   **Sengoku Basara** has the poster boy trio of Date Masamune, Sanada Yukimura and Maeda Keiji wearing blue, red and yellow coats respectively, as well as having matching power auras to go with them.
-   **Shovel Knight**: The logos and promotional art of the game's campaigns <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> are coloured to correspond to each playable protagonist. **Shovel of Hope** is blue, **Plague of Shadows** green, **Specter of Torment** red and **King of Cards** yellow.
-   In **Silhouette Mirage**, Silhouettes are blue, Mirages are red, and Normal is green.
-   The main trio in the **Sly Cooper** games follow this, with Sly being blue, Bentley being Green, and Murray being red-pink. Strangely, the trio don't seem to act their colors: Sly is the main character, and serves as the field one, Bentley is the smart one (and the leader), and Murray is the strong one.
-   **Sonic the Hedgehog**:
    -   Sonic is Blue, Knuckles is Red, and Tails is Yellow. However, there are rare occasions when the trio is Sonic, Knuckles, and Shadow (black), or when the trio is Sonic, Tails, and Amy, with her pink acting as the red in the trio.
    -   In **SegaSonic the Hedgehog**, the original power trio consisted of Sonic (blue), Mighty (red) and Ray (yellow). This trio came back in **Sonic Mania Plus**, more precisely in Mighty and Ray's endings.
    -   This is exaggerated to ridiculous levels in **Sonic Heroes**. All playable trios are color coded based on their power; Blue (for speed), Yellow (for flight), and Red (for power) after Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles.
    -   Where Team Sonic is a Primary Pigment Color trio, Team Chaotix is a Primary Light Color trio terms of their auras Vector (Green), Espio (Blue) and Charmy (Red).
-   **Super Mario Bros.**:
    -   The Toad Brigade in **Super Mario Galaxy** follows this arrangement. The red toad is the leader, the blue toad is The Smart Guy, and the green toad performs various supporting tasks. There's also a yellow toad and a purple toad, but they don't do that much; the yellow toad pretty much just sleeps everywhere, while the purple toad mainly delivers mail.
    -   The three princess characters from the series as a whole almost wear dresses that correspond to the subtractive colors of light: Peach wears a pink dress (which is close to magenta), Daisy wears a yellow dress, and Rosalina wears a cyan dress.
    -   Back to **Galaxy**, we also have the banners surrounding the planets Mario fights Bowser on at the end of all three Bowser levels. In "Bowser's Star Reactor", the banners are red; in "Bowser's Dark Matter Plant", the banners are green; and in "Bowser's Galaxy Reactor", the banners are blue.
    -   In the **Mario & Luigi** series, the Elite Trio is made up of the green-robed Sergeant Guy, the red-shelled Corporal Paraplonk, and the blue pajama-wearing Private Goomp.
-   The Original Generation copilots in **Super Robot Wars Judgment** stick to this. Similar to the Fire Emblem example above, Katia and Melua switch roles, (gameplay and story wise) with Katia Grineal being the uptight one, and Melua Melna Meia being a bit quieter. Festenia Muse plays her role straight though.
-   These are the selectable colors for characters in Team battles in the **Super Smash Bros.** series.
-   The three main factions in the **Thief** series, with Pagans wearing green, Hammerites wearing red and Keepers wearing blue.
-   The four test tube liquids in **Uncle Albert's Fabulous Voyage** are blue, red, green and yellow. The blue one is a transformation potion, the red one is a potion that changes an animal's colors, the green one is anti-venom and the yellow one is the Albertic acid.
-   **Wario Land**:
    -   In **Wario Land 3**, the 4 chests you get in each level follow this arrangement, being blue, red and green with grey as the fourth member. The colors are usually an indicator of how difficult it is to get them, with grey being the easiest, followed by red, then green, then blue as the hardest.
    -   The four main Passages in **Wario Land 4** are the Ruby Passage, Sapphire Passage, Emerald Passage and Topaz Passage, with the Entry Passage being purple.
-   In The **World of Warcraft**, Death Knight runes are Blood (red), Frost (blue), and Unholy (green).
    -   The Alliance is blue and the Horde is red. Confusingly enough (at least for Horde players), this doesn't correspond with the name coloring for players and NPCs that show their status, ranging from blue (can't attack or be attacked) to red (hostile).
    -   Each class has a color associated with it, such as white for priests, purple for warlocks, or brown for warriors.
        -   Back when the Shaman and Paladin were single-faction only, their color was pink. When both sides got access to both classes in **The Burning Crusade**, the Shaman changed to dark blue.
    -   Spell icons tend to reflect their origin. Paladin spells often heavily feature yellow (holy) while Warlock spells tend to be focused on red/orange (fire), dark purple (curses, souls) and green (demonic energies).
    -   Instance portals are color-coded depending on what they lead to, purple for group content and green-blue for raids.

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Web Animation

-   **Animator vs. Animation**: The Second Coming's friends are red, green, yellow and blue stick figures.
-   **Chaotic Ambition**: The hosts running the show with main host Volcano Book (Red), logical Slushie (Blue) and bubbly Cheese Slice (Yellow).
-   **The Letter**: Of the three main characters, Holy Water is blue, Forbidden Fruit is red and Soda Bottle is green due to being a blue-tinted vial of holy water, an apple and a green-tinted bottle of soda respectively.
-   **ONE**: In the Ensemble Cast, the main trio the series focused on are Backpack/Liam (Green), Scenty/Amelia (Blue) and Soda Bottle/Bryce (Red).
-   **Xionic Madness**: Bolverk Squad, the four main characters of the series, represent the colors: Omega being red, Xero being blue, Kary being green and Askad being yellow.

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Webcomics

-   The Freudian Trio of **Arthur, King of Time and Space** have yellow (Arthur), blue (Guenevere), and red (Lancelot). Unusually, Arthur is the leader (although he's **also** the gentle, laid-back one). Also, Lancelot is uptight and Guenevere is volatile, reversing the usual Red Oni, Blue Oni symbolism. (Secondary characters also have distinctive colours, meaning the entire main cast would have a Rainbow Motif if we ever saw all of them together.)
-   As in Star Trek, in **Captain Ufo** the uniforms are color-coded, depending on the crew's divisions: red for military and command, yellow for engineering, blue for medical, violet for science and white for advisors.
-   The main characters of **Fall City Blues** have chromatic hair colors. Lex has red (well, pink), Lucy has blue (well, teal), and Eiffel has proper green.
-   **Homestuck**'s original set of kids are one of these — John is blue, Dave is red, and Jade is green — but unusually, their fourth, Rose, is purple, and John and Dave have switched the roles generally associated with their colors by this trope.
-   The three main characters at the start of **Jupiter-Men** are Quintin, Jackie, and Nathan, who are strongly associated with green, blue, and red respectively. This is reflective of their personalities: Quintin is energetic and sweet, Jackie socially adept but superficial, and Nathan is deadly serious and the most devoted to the role of being a Star Guardian.
-   In **O Human Star**, the characters don't wear the colors themselves, but scenes from Al's perspective are tinted blue, Brendan's are tinted red, and Sulla's will probably be green judging by some of the bonus art.
-   In **Rescuing Dara**, Chivai is green, Dara is red, and Zilch is blue.
-   If one counts Zee Captain's purple goggles as red, or uses instead the color of his/her hatband and mug, then **Romantically Apocalyptic** follows this trope to a T.
-   The central characters in **Scandinavia and the World**: they tend to follow the main ground colour of their national flag. Sweden is dominantly blue: anally retentive, conservative, introverted, judgemental. Denmark is red: extrovert, insensitive, outgoing. (And pretty much an Author Avatar for Danish artist, Humon). The nearest thing to green is Norway, who fits the specification for the "green" character: laid-back, tolerant, easy-going. (No green in the Norwegian flag, though.)
-   The main trio in **Soil That Binds Us** are purple Petunia, green Dandelion (with a yellow head of blond hair) and red Faye.
-   **TransStellar** does this in its second issue, with Jamen having a red coat and a leading personality, Dari having blue skin and probably the highest IQ in the cast, and Zartes usually wearing green camo-pants and having an obsession with food. The author of **Transstellar** was surprised, as he did that without being consciously aware of this trope.

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Web Original

-   **1 For All**: The character trio of Evandra (green), Antrius (blue), and Nixie (red); their respective players Eva, Antonio and Nicole, also usually dress in these same colours, if their likenesses weren't already a giveaway.

-   **Don't Hug Me I'm Scared**: Yellow, Red, and Duck Guy, who are yellow, red and green, later switching colors, except Red Guy is blue.
-   **Hoops and Yoyo**: The main trio of e-cards and physical cards are pink (Hoops), green (Yoyo), and blue (Piddles).
-   **Overly Sarcastic Productions**: In **History Makers: Dante**, the analysis of the Tuscan poet’s life and works color-codes the three parts of **The Divine Comedy**; red (**Inferno**), green (**Purgatorio**), and blue (**Paradiso**).
    -   When **The Divine Comedy** as a whole is displayed, it’s colored golden-yellow.
-   **The Runaway Guys**: Fall into this while playing **New Super Mario Bros. Wii** and **New Super Mario Bros. U**, with Chuggaaconroy being the red, ProtonJon being the blue, and NintendoCapriSun being the green (with JoshJepson filling in as the yellow fourth member).
-   **SuperMarioLogan**: The trio of Joseph Hisfriendfromschool (Red), Cody Nutkiss (Blue), and Bowser Junior (Green) became this when Joseph gained a red shell with wings in "Joseph's New Shell!".
-   **Ted**

-   **Classic Disney Shorts**: In the old shorts starring Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy, Mickey would always dress primarily in red and Donald in blue. Goofy's signature color is orange, but he's often depicted as wearing green as well. Given that Sora is essentially a stand-in for Mickey, **Kingdom Hearts** is essentially following traditions at this point.
-   **The Cleveland Show**: The Brown-Tubbs children follow this pattern; Cleveland Jr. wears a red shirt, Rallo a blue one, and Roberta wars a green tube top.
-   **Dexter's Laboratory**:
    -   While Dee Dee always wears her signature pink, her friends Lee Lee and Mee Mee are sometimes seen in green and purple, respectively.
    -   In **D & DD**, Dexter is Gamemaster of the **Dungeons & Dragons** Parody **Monster & Mazes**, and the characters of his three friends (which strongly resemble the friends themselves) fit this trope:
        -   Falcor is a woodsman archer clad in green.
        -   Macabros is a magician dressed in red.
        -   Valerian is a knight/paladin in a blue surcoat.
-   **DuckTales**: Huey (red), Dewey (blue), and Louie (green); with Webby (pink) joining them as the fourth "triplet".

    -   Early appearances of the trio had Dewey wearing orange.

    -   Spike is a blue Triceratops. He is a martial arts expert and the most eager to fight.
    -   Bullzeye is a maroon red Pteranodon and is the most laid back of the four.

-   **Laff-A-Lympics**: The Scooby Doobies wear blue vests, the Yogi Yahooeys wear red vests, and the Really Rottens wear green vests.
-   **The Legend of Korra**: Sees a variation in blue Waterbender Korra as The Hero, red Firebender Mako as serious uptight The Lancer, while green Earthbender Bolin remains laid back, but within the confines of their pro-bending team the Fire Ferrets, Mako has The Leader role as team captain.
    -   The three surviving members of the original Team Avatar embody this through their national dress; Katara in blue (Water Tribes), Toph in green (Earth Kingdom), and Zuko in red (Fire Nation). Although their roles are significantly diminished from the original series, each plays some pivotal role in Korra’s life and Avatar journey (even if she doesn’t know it at first).
-   **LoliRock**: The three main characters are Iris (pink), Talia (blue), and Aurianna (yellow-orange).
-   **Magical Super Trolls**: In the Failed Pilot Episode, Hunkules has red hair and wears a blue cape, Bender has blue hair and wears a green cape and Warpy has green hair and wears a red cape.

Chromatic Arrangement Example in Real Life

-   Political parties are usually color coded in polling news. **In general**, left-wing parties will be coloured red, right-wing parties will be coloured blue, liberal/libertarians/centrists yellow, green parties are green, and the far-right typically get brown colours. Independent and non-partisan candidates are various shades of grey.
    -   The big major exception is, of course, the US. Before 2000, television networks on election night assigned red and blue arbitrarily and this would vary from channel to channel. However, after the giant catastrofuck that was the Florida count in 2000, that year's imagery of blue for Democrats and red for Republicans was firmly ingrained into the American political culture and hasn't shifted since.
        -   However, news organizations still lack a consistent color standard for "independent", "polls still open, no results yet", and "too close to call".
    -   In Canada, though, the Conservative Party is the standard blue, the centrist Liberal Party is red, and the democratic socialist New Democratic Party is orange. Green has also been a popular colour for right-wing parties, forcing the Green Party to use a very bright green to identify themselves. The separatist Bloc Quebecois is a light blue, while the People's Party bucked the trend of "green = right-wing" by going with purple.
    -   Irish politics, on both sides of the border, is more to do with history than economics. In the Republic, Labour uses red, the Christian-democratic Fine Gael uses blue, and the populist pro-business Fianna Fáil uses green. In Northern Ireland, republican parties use Irish colours and unionists use blue. The non-sectarian Alliance Party, as would be expected, use yellow.
    -   In France, the Socialist Party (the largest left-wing party) uses pink, rather than red, as red is used by the actual Communist Party.
    -   In Greece, the leftist party use green, to distinguish it from the communists, who use red.
    -   Purple is a non-aligned colour and usage is split between centrist parties, issue parties, and, recently, traditionalist parties.
-   Sweden's second biggest newspaper, "Svenska dagbladet", uses this trope. News is blue, economy and finances are red, and culture/entertainment is green.
-   The Sunday edition of the San Francisco Chronicle has a partial version of this (or used to) as well: with The Sporting Green (sports news printed on green paper) and the Datebook (entertainment news, printed on pink paper).
-   Communism descended from Socialism (which was usually red), so communist countries chose red, and this led to the Red Scare.
-   Speaking of additive color (we were, way back at the beginning), when TV first went to color, red-green-blue network idents popped up **everywhere**. Some networks, like ABC and CBS, took advantage of their three-letter names.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> Others, like BBC 2 and ATV, just put an additive color Venn diagram as part of their ident — Grampian used red-yellow-blue-white shapes in the form of their "Scottish flag" logo. Later on, in 1988, the BBC added blue-red-green lines under the letter blocks of their ident, which remained until 1997.
-   Chocolate packaging:
    -   In Germany: red = plain, blue = milk, green = with nuts.
    -   Also in the Netherlands, but with the strange exception of the best-known brand, "Verkade", confusingly using blue = plain and pink = milk.
    -   In Israel: red = plain, white = milk, brown = dark.
-   Milk packaging:
    -   American milk packaging is color-coded: typically, red = whole milk (about 3% butterfat), blue = 2% butterfat, yellow or green = 1% butterfat, and pink or light blue = skim. (Chocolate milk is of course coded brown.) Though some companies use purple for 1% instead.
    -   Half-and-half is also usually packaged in purple.
    -   Relatively-uncommon strawberry-flavored milk is oftentimes sold in pink packaging, at least in the US.
    -   Whereas, in the UK, red = skimmed milk, green = semi skimmed (2% fat), and blue = whole milk. 1% fat milk is a fairly new phenomenon and colour varies by shop.
    -   In Australia: full-cream milk = blue, and skim milk = either green or red. Other varieties of milk aren't really a thing and hence have no associated colours.
    -   In the Netherlands, dark blue is whole milk, light blue is skimmed milk, red is buttermilk, green is plain yoghurt (dark: whole; light: skimmed), pink is strawberry-flavored yoghurt, yellow is **vla**<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>, dark brown is chocolate-flavored **vla**, and caramel-colored is caramel-flavored **vla** (for the last four, the package matches the product color exactly).<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
-   Potato chips packaging:
    -   In Australia, potato chips are usually colour coded as such: blue = plain, purple = salt and vinegar, yellow = cheese, green = chicken. The last two are a little more variable though. Brown is also generally honey soy flavour, while orange is commonly used for barbecue flavour.
    -   In the UK it's generally: red = plain, blue = salt and vinegar and green = cheese and onion, except for Walkers for which the latter two are swapped.
    -   The US is the same except green is generally sour cream and onion. Lays, the US equivalent of Walkers, uses yellow for plain and red for plain ruffle-cut (the Wavy version).
    -   In the Netherlands it's: red = plain, blue = paprika, yellow = cheese & onion or cream & onion, and green = **bolognese** (Italian herbs).
-   Cola packaging (in Europe at least, and they all follow the best-known brand of Coca Cola): red = regular (exception: Pepsi, which is blue), silver = diet, gold = caffeine-(and probably sugar-)free and green = with Stevia.
-   The basic Bic pen comes in three colors (besides black) - red, green, and blue. Nearly every four-pack of pens or markers features these four colors.
-   Jif peanut butter lids comes in red for creamy, blue for chunky, and green for reduced-fat. The labels are vertically striped with the same colors from left to right.
-   The red-yellow-green-blue color scheme in any arrangement is practically Google's corporate trademark, using it in most of its products' logos in some arrangement or another for brand coherence.
-   ...Which was a bit awkward given that Microsoft was already using it in much the same way; the logos of Windows, Office, and MSN all used this scheme until recently. The MSN butterfly, which was always more of an orange-yellow-green-blue anyway, is the last one to retain this scheme. And now Microsoft's own logo is just an arrangement of four-colored squares next to its name.
-   Office software suites often color code their constituent programs' icons:
    -   Microsoft Office: Word is blue, Excel is green, PowerPoint is orange, Outlook is a blue slightly lighter than Word's, OneNote is purple, Access is red, Publisher is teal. Outlook and Access were respectively yellow and pink before 2013. The more specialized Office programs for businesses and such reuse some of these colors for their icons, particularly blue.
    -   LibreOffice: Writer is blue, Calc is green, Impress is orange, Draw is yellow, Math is gray, Base is purple.
    -   Apple's iWork: Pages is orange, Numbers is green, Keynote is blue.
    -   Google: following the company's trademark scheme, Docs is blue, Sheets is green, Slides is yellow, Drive (where is stored the first three's files) combines all three colors.
-   Red-yellow-green-blue logos were in vogue during the fourth generation of video games, with the Nintendo 64's 3D "N" and the Play Station's "PS" which continued through the next generation or so.
-   With the release of the Switch, the console games market has become this: Red for Nintendo, blue for Play Station, and the traditional green for Xbox.
-   Similarly, now that Intel is trying to compete in the GPU market, we have AMD as red, Nvidia as green, and Intel as blue.
-   Video game controllers often use these colors for their buttons:
    -   The SNES console's A, B, X and Y buttons are respectively colored red, yellow, blue and green in Japan and Europe. Subverted in North America which used two shades of purple; dark purple for A and B and light purple for X and Y.
    -   On the Sega Dreamcast A is red, B is blue, X is yellow, and Y is green.
    -   On Xbox consoles, A is green, B is red, X is blue, and Y is yellow.
-   American railroad signal lamps use the colors; red for "stop" or "restricted area", green for "proceed" or "all clear", and blue to indicate a restricted track or piece of equipment that is being worked on by railroad personnel and is unsafe to be moved. Occasionally yellow is used as a "caution" signal but it's uncommon.
-   MediaCity UK, where among other things The BBC has a major base, doesn't have street names, but street colours. Thoroughfares with signage and street furniture in blue, white, pink, yellow and purple radiate out from the centre, connected by green, orange and red streets.
