Body to Jewel: 
_"...and it was so cold and scary in there, that Albi began to cry_ dragon tears_... Which, as we all know, turn into_ jellybeans!"

Basically, when a bodily fluid or organ becomes a Mineral MacGuffin once shed or forcibly separated. Typically this only happens when the character shedding, bleeding, or cut apart was already highly magical or supernatural, or a spell of some sort was placed on them. In rare cases, a muggle experiencing powerful sorrow or happiness can make this happen by virtue of their incredibly intense emotions.

On the other petrified hand, if taken with violence or from those Made of Evil, these might become highly cursed as a form of revenge.

Likely body parts to be crystalized include:

-   **Tears:** Usually have healing properties, though being a solid version of Swiss-Army Tears means they can likely do other things.
-   **Blood:** Blood Gems (note the capitals)<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  usually have some or all of the effects associated with Blood Magic, or enhance them to ludicrous levels. If there's a lot of it, it can be sculpted into "Blood Crystal Armor".
-   **Solid Gold Poop:** ... moving right along.
-   **Hearts:** Other than conversation pieces, petrified hearts usually act as Soul Jars.
-   **Eyes:** Grant powers of perception, either Super-Senses, clairvoyance or other Psychic Powers.
-   **Other body parts:** Perhaps the character incorporates a mineral as a part of his/her/its basic biology.

Compare Organ Drops. Contrast Crystal Prison. The jewels made in this way all benefit from All-Natural Gem Polish. Can be a result of Gemstone Assault if done by someone who can encase people in gems like An Ice Person.

Body to Jewel Example in Anime & Manga

-   In one chapter of **Ah! My Goddess**, Hild extracts a crystalized fragment of herself from her body and gives it to Keiichi to use against Hagall.
-   **Berserk**: Grunbeld's Apostle form is a massive dragon made of gemstone (specifically ruby, aka the super-hard mineral corundum).
-   In **Bleach**, Ulquiorra's eyeballs can be removed, and, when crushed, form a mist that shows his memories to all who inhale it. The eyes do regenerate, by the way.
-   **Blood+**:
    -   Saya's second sword contains a piece of her father's crystallized blood in the base of its blade.
    -   Kai later makes a necklace out of his dead brother Riku's crystallized blood.
-   In the 10th Volume of **A Certain Magical Index: New Testament**, it's discovered that Othinus removed one of her own eyes to gain the powers of a Magic God, and left the eye at the bottom of a lake in Denmark. After a few centuries of magical exposure, the eye has completely crystallized and colored the same transparent blue as the lake water.
-   In the anime version of **Chrono Crusade**, Fiore says that her heart is a gem similar to the jewels she uses in her spell casting. In the manga Fiore herself isn't a victim of this trope, but she uses her powers to trap the souls of people inside gems for Aion to fuel his powers with.
-   In **Dragon Quest: Legend of the Hero Abel**: The Big Bad creates monsters from gemstones, killing them makes them revert to those stones. Probably the anime's attempt to justify the Money Spider aspects of the games it's based on.
-   **Fullmetal Alchemist**:
    -   In the manga and its direct anime adaptation **Brotherhood**, the Philosopher's Stone is the crystallized souls of several sacrificial victims transmuted into anything from a stone to a liquid to a crystal.
    -   In **Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)** it's a similar case, only the sacrifices' entire bodies are transformed instead of just their souls.
-   In **InuYasha** the Jewel of Four Souls comes from Kagome's body when she is injured. Justified in that she's the reincarnation of a priestess whose lifeless body was cremated alongside the Jewel itself.
-   In **K**, those marbles that Anna uses to amplify her psychic abilities are made from her blood, as is shown in The Stinger to episode 9 of season 1. She's colorblind and can only see red, but she can see every color if she looks through the marbles (as shown in the beginning of the first episode).
-   The treasure that Jing eventually claimed in the first episode of **King of Bandit Jing** is the crystallized tears that formed when Cidre was reunited with her mother. Cognac complains that he's tried making the mermaid cry many times before, but it never turns into jewel, to which Jing responds that tears of sadness and Tears of Joy are very different, and the latter is what created the jewel. Note that this only occur in the Anime version. In the original manga, the mermaids' tears didn't turn into jewel, and Jing looted some of Cognac's other treasures instead.
-   **Kite**: Akai had some of the orphaned Sawa's parents' blood fashioned into an earring, which has been her most prized possession ever since.
-   When the titular dolls in **Dolls (2005)** cry, their tears become extremely valuable jewels called "Tears of Heaven."
-   In **Princess Tutu**, the pieces of Mytho's shattered heart look like red gems. In fact, the red gem pendant that turns Ahiru into Princess Tutu is one of them.
-   **Puella Magi Madoka Magica**: Each Magical Girl receives a Soul Gem upon making a contract with Kyubey, which allows them to perform magic and measure how much of The Corruption is building up. As the name implies, it is literally their soul, extracted from their body and transformed into a pretty crystal. None of them take it well when they find out. Then the implications sink in...
-   **Sailor Moon**
    -   The Ginzuishou (AKA Silver Crystal) which forms (at least partially) from Usagi's tears.
    -   And the Shitennou in manga, their corpses turn into their namesake stones.
-   In **Stealth Symphony**, Slice's blood turns into gold coins when it coagulates. He doesn't let anyone take advantage of that but himself though, using the gold to amass a fortune and run an influential crime syndicate. He also weaponizes this trait in unbelievably creative ways, making this trope look like a superpower.
-   **YuYu Hakusho**: Yukina's tears become valuable jewels, which has people trying to make her cry through incredible cruelty. Tarukane, who is part of the Black Book Club, aims to make profit with these jewels. When he sees Yukina cry over a bird's death, he arranges it so **every meal she gets** is the same breed of bird.

Body to Jewel Example in Comic Books

-   The first Red Lantern ring was forged from the crystallized blood of four ritually murdered immortal... not quite Eldritch Abominations. And Atrocitus' **RAGE.**

-   In **Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)**, when King Acorn was rescued from the Zone of Silence, his body began to turn into green crystals as a result from overexposure to the Zone's harsh enviornment.
-   **X-Men**:
    -   Bling!<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>. His powers manifested after Scarlet Witch depowered 90% of known mutants, can expel diamond shards that ultimately come from her bone marrow.
    -   Frost with her diamond form, which she can switch to at will. In addition to the logical advantages of having a diamond body (such as being able to cut most things with her fingernails), Emma's mind is impenetrable to psychic probes when she's in that form.
    -   Emma's Kid from the Future Ruby Summers has a similar mutation, except her alternate form is ruby quartz rather than diamond.

Body to Jewel Example in Fan Works

-   **Ages of Shadow**: After Jade/Yade Khan has an eye slashed by Cheherezad's closing attack, she rips out the damaged orb, which immediately crystalizes into a ruby.
-   **Child of the Storm** has the usual example of Emma Frost — and among other things, it has significantly slowed her ageing process. This power — now a smoky diamond form — descends to her grandson, Scott Summers, as his secondary mutation — when used in conjunction with his energy blasts, it allows him to refract and direct them from anywhere on his body.
-   **Equestria Divided**: Rarity suffers from a disease that does this rather messily; among other things, moving causes her to bleed due to the crystals on her skin grinding her insides. Her left foreleg and the left side of her face have transformed into crystal thus far, and it's implied that eventually she'll either become immobile until she starves or petrify entirely.
-   **Fate of the Clans**: Anna makes her Reality Marbles using her own blood.
-   **The Legend of Royal Blue and La Sylphide**: When La Sylphide isn't there to purify shards from Simon the Magician's mirror, Duusu draws power from Gabriel to blow kwami bubbles for temporarily containing them by drinking his tears. She **could** take a hair or a drop of blood, but they're too icky to swallow.
-   **Snowdrop (2013)** (found here): The titular character, a blind pegasus filly, sculpts the world's first snowflake from her frozen teardrop.

Body to Jewel Example in Film — Animated

-   **Atlantis: The Lost Empire**: Kida merges with the Heart of Atlantis. Later on Rourke is turned into a crystal monster after making contact with a crystallized shard of glass.
-   In **Gumby: The Movie**, a skateboard-riding dachshund called Lowbelly cries pearls whenever his master, Gumby, leaves or changes shape when he performs with his band. This fuels the Blockheads' latest get-rich-quick scheme, which for some reason involves making robot duplicates of Gumby's band.
-   **The Secret of Kells** has the Eye of Crom Cruach, a magical magnifying glass which is the eye of a serpentine god... beast... demon... thing.

Body to Jewel Example in Literature

-   The Paul Jennings short story "Tonsil Eye 'Tis" features a character who grows a third eye on his finger, which cries tears that grow into garden gnomes. That sounds absurd, but the character goes on to make a living selling the gnomes.
-   The **Star Trek** novel **Tears of the Singers** is about this trope, with an Anvilicious don't-kill-baby-seals plot.
-   **Goose Chase** by Patrice Kindl stars a young woman who has been "blessed" with tears that turn into diamonds by a presumably well-meaning fairy. She also gets gold dust all over the floor whenever she brushes her hair.
-   **The 13 Clocks** had a woman who cried gemstones whenever she was sad. Unfortunately by the time the heroes came around, her tears had dried up completely due to people telling her sad stories so much. However... she also cries gems when she's laughing hard only for them to turn back into water after two weeks. Long enough for the heroes' purpose.
-   **The Goose That Laid The Golden Eggs**, one of Aesop's Fables.
-   Presumably, the Canim bloodstones from **Codex Alera**. It's never fully explained what they are, but they grant protection from the ritualists's Blood Magic, and bleed when they do so (implying limited uses). As such, high-ranking Canim Warriors (the ritualists' rivals) often have several bloodstones embedded in their weapons and armor. This saves Tavi's life, twice.
-   In Robin McKinley's **The Hero and the Crown,** the last drop of blood a dragon sheds is a ruby.
-   **Six Of Swords** by Carole Nelson Douglas: the tears of the heroine, Irissa, turn into "coldstones." She at least implies on one occasion that the hero is deliberately trying to make her cry so he can sell her tears. It turns out he was deliberately trying to make her cry for another reason — to wash out the taint that had blinded her. (The taint had turned her eyes and tears from gold to silver, and he shows her that the colour was faded in later tears.)
-   In **The Chronicles of Amber**, the Jewel of Judgment is an eye of the Serpent of Chaos.
-   **Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher**: "Dragons weep diamonds."
-   The dragons in Elizabeth Kerner's trilogy (**Song in the Silence**, **The Lesser Kindred**, and **Redeeming the Lost**) have "soulgems" in their foreheads, placed as if a third eye. The telepathic dragons achieve their most intimate communications when they touch soulgems. When a dragon dies, the living gem shrinks and hardens, so that it looks like an actual cut gem - but the gems are carefully kept, because the dragons can communicate with their ancestors through their soulgems.
-   In Tanith Lee's **Tales from the Flat Earth**, Ferazhin, who was created from a flower, has tears that turn into gems. A Drin takes them and turns them into a beautiful collar, which is sent to upper-earth. Any mortal who sees it has to have it, causing murder and mayhem.
-   The dragons in Christopher Paolini's **Inheritance Cycle** have organs called Eldunarí that can be regurgitated as gemstones, in which case, should that dragon die, their consciousness will be stored within it. Their size depends on the age of the dragon they come from, and the Big Bad has enslaved thousands of them to augment his power.
-   Happens in **The Kite Runner** in the Story Within a Story that Amir writes. In his story, there is a man who finds out that he cries diamonds. He does everything he can to make himself sad in order to cry, until he finally ends up killing his wife. Hassan points out the flaw in the story, saying that the man could've just chopped an onion to cry since the diamond tears didn't require him to actually be sad.
-   The world of the **Godslayer Chronicles** by James Clemens is built on this troupe. The nine humorals (bodily fluids) of the Gods have the power to grant Graces. The humorals are **highly** valuable and are willingly given and stockpiled in glass vials (natural materials, like wood, stone or metal, will leech grace from the humoral... the process of turning sand to glass somehow negates this). Black markets for stolen humorals exist. The nine humorals are: **Blood** - Necessary for any other humoral grace to flow; **Masculine Seed/Feminine Menses** - Grants graces to living things; **Sweat** - Grants graces to inanimate objects; **Tears** - Increases the potency of other humorals; **Saliva** - Decreases the potency of other humorals; **Phlegm** - Allows graces to manifest outside physical objects; **Yellow Bile (Piss)** - Temporarily grants graces; **Black Bile (Shit)** - Nullifies graces.
-   Carr in **Fancy Apartments** has a phoenix tear gem, which is, well, a solidified phoenix tear.
-   Toki's blood seems to do this in terms of what it touches or gets into, as it turns things crystal, the which can be read in **Shattered Glass**, which can be Nightmare Fuel for some, and or **Madgie, what did you do? X: Bloody Snow Angel**, in which case it does that to snow. Bunny theorized this is probably because Toki's blood has **extreme** amounts of cysteine. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
-   In **Renegades**, Ruby's blood crystallizes into bloodstones, which she can shape into weapons.
-   **Quantum Devil Saga: Avatar Tuner**: Curvier Syndrome. When people come in contact with light from the Weird Sun, their bodies gradually (with different speeds depending on exposure) turn into crystal, with amazing light refraction properties, and as it's later revealed, incredible data storage.
-   **Bruce Coville's Book of... Magic**: Variant in **Wizard's Boy** — the Black Stone of Borea isn't exactly a jewel, but it **was** the heart of the greatest wizard who ever lived, until it was turned to stone.
-   **The Mermaid's Sister**: The mermaid Maren weeps pearls instead of tears.
-   **The Sunlit Man**: People who die of exposure to the planet Canticle's super-hot, magical sun are reduced to eight-inch lumps of smokestone called Sunhearts — sometimes with faint impressions of screaming faces in the surface. They serve as potent, rechargable Power Crystals for the setting's Magitek.
-   In **Mythic Misadventures**, monster blood hardens into rubies. During a battle in the sky, vast quantities of rubies can fall to Earth, to the point where people stop collecting them and just try to keep the streets clear.

Body to Jewel Example in Live-Action TV

-   **Andromeda** has the "Hegemon's Heart", the crystalized ventricles of the first Than-Thre-Kull Hive Queen. Aside from being gorgeous, an object of massive cultural value **and** a priceless historical artifact, it also hides the map to the "Engine of Creation."
-   **Merlin (1998)**: Queen Mab sheds one tear which turns into a small crystal, and gives it to her champion, King Vortigen for protection. Vortigen disregards magic, and in abandoning it, gets killed by Merlin for his arrogance. Merlin even comments: "Only one tear was shed for Vortigern, and his pride had cast it away. He paid for it with his life."
-   In **Juken Sentai Gekiranger**, Maku's heart became a ruby after it was ripped out of his chest.
-   **Resident Alien**: When the alien, "Goliath," died, his body crystalized in a standing position, making him resemble a statue.

Body to Jewel Example in Music

-   Referenced in Poets of the Fall's "Diamonds For Tears," where the singer observes his lover's Tender Tears and Tears of Joy and interprets them this way while he wrestles with Commitment Issues.

Body to Jewel Example in Mythology

-   Some mythos have dragons weeping diamonds.
-   **The Kalevala** said that the Finnish hero Väinämöinen's tears turned into pearls.
-   The Norse goddess Freyja was said to weep amber and gold — in poetry, gold might be referred to as "Freyja's tears".
-   In Chinese Mythology, jade is sometimes said to be the crystallized semen of a celestial dragon.
-   The Incas called silver "Tears of the Moon" and gold "Sweat of the Sun".
-   In Japanese Mythology, samebitos, which resemble humanoid sharks, shed tears that turn into pearls.
-   Several fairy tales tell of a girl being blessed by a fairy so that jewels or pearls will come forth when she either speaks or cries.

Body to Jewel Example in Tabletop Games

-   **Dungeons & Dragons**.
    -   **Dark Sun**: Thri-lreen, once they start to produce venom, chew a special herb to have their drying saliva turn into hard crystalline material.
    -   **Forgotten Realms** has the gems known as "King's Tears", said to be the crystallized tears of long dead wizard kings. Each one contained an image of the thing the king loved most.
    -   The Basic module "Palace of the Silver Princess" has the "Eye of Arik", Arik being an evil being responsible for the catastrophe that strikes the palace.
    -   Death kisses have a nerve node within their bodies that hardens into a red gem when the creature dies. These jewels are called bloodeyes, and are prized for their soft glow that intensifies with the wearer's emotions.
-   **Rifts**: The Dragon-Gods of the (true) Dragonwright pantheon (as opposed to the Splugorth-backed fakers) all have different properties to their blood or scales. Given that they're gods the size of naval cruisers, getting them without their permission is another matter entirely.
-   The Palladium **Mystic China** expansion to **Ninjas and Superspies** included, among other Chi Magic spells, the spell "Weep Beans of Life". The caster wept tears that turned into tasty beans that healed whoever ate them. Another spell, "Remove Heart", is not as deadly as it sounds: The extracted heart becomes a fist-sized ruby that still functions even when removed. A type of false immortality involves doing the same to **all** your vital organs, then somehow storing them all in the heart gem.

-   **Warhammer 40,000**:
    -   Whenever the Eldar goddess Isha cries, her tears become soulstones that the Eldar use to protect their souls from Slaanesh.
    -   Eldar blood crystallizes instead of congealing.
    -   Eldar Farseers very slowly turn to crystal due to their long time channelling the threads of fate. The upshot is that they eventually settle in the Dome of Seers and become sentient pillars of crystal which are linked to the craftworld's infinity circuit, and until then, because they're partially made of crystal, they're quite a bit tougher than most other Eldar.
-   In **Mage: The Awakening**, Archmasters who Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence often leave behind **sarira**, remnants of their bodies that are transmuted into crystalline Mana. These artifacts have potent innate magical abilities, like an emerald femur that can create Mix-and-Match Critters; they can also be tapped for their Mana, which is roughly as wasteful as burning a Rembrandt to cook a hot dog.

Body to Jewel Example in Toys

-   1980s doll line **Rose Petal Place**. The resident family of a Victorian-style house moved away, and the little girl took one last stroll through its garden, weeping, before they left. Her tears changed some of the flowers into little maidens, and their houses, cars, etc. were similarly transformed toys and gardening implements. Each doll/accessory was thus marked with a "crystal" tear.
-   Another iconic toy of The '80s, wish trolls.
-   **My Little Pony** had two groups in G1: Twinkle Eyed Ponies (or just Tinkle-Eyes) and the first three years of Princess Ponies. Twinkle-Eyes are ponies with gems as eyes. The cartoon never went into why that was, but one comic story explained that Twinkle-Eyes were ponies that were once enslaved by the Jewel Wizard and forced to work in his mines. There, their eyes lost their compatability with daylight. When freed, shards of the Jewel Wizard's throne were lodged into enslaved ponies' eyes, which returned their sight to them. Princess Ponies, meanwhile, are just fancier than common ponies and have embedded jewels instead of regular cutie marks. The first sets anyway. The last set of jewel-themed Princess Ponies have regular cutie marks and a gem embedded into their forehead.

Body to Jewel Example in Video Games

-   **MARDEK RPG: Chapter 3** features Dreamstones, which are crystallized **thoughts**.
-   Rose the elf in **Dragon Quest IV** cried precious gems and humans constantly tormented her to get them. Made worse when you factor in tears she cried due to joy would crumble right away, but tears of sadness wouldn't. In the DS remake, Rose's tears always crumble when touched. It's implied that elves can make them break apart at will to keep people from collecting them without their approval. Any satisfaction one might feel at knowing the bastards never profited from their evil ways soon gets offset by the realization that this likely didn't stop them from **trying**. As seen when she's abducted and beaten to the point of death by thugs.
-   **The Legend of Zelda**:
    -   **The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask**: The moon of Termina is not only sentient, but it can even cry. The resulting crystal-like Moon Tears are highly prized by Terminans.
    -   In **The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword**: The Spanish translation of the game makes Evil Crystals the "petrified hearts of malicious monsters". Fittingly, the Zombie Bokoblins are the ones dropping them.
-   **Final Fantasy**
    -   In **Final Fantasy VI**, Magicite is the crystalline remains of an Esper, which can grant spells and Summon Magic to the holder.
    -   The l'Cie in **Final Fantasy XIII** get their souls crystallized early on in the process. When they finish their focus and turn into statues (which are just empty shells), they can be revived later as long as the crystal gem is intact. In particular, Serah's single crystallized tear plays a large role in many cutscenes involving her fiancé Snow.
    -   At one point in **World of Final Fantasy** you need to reach a Sunken Temple, so Shanttotto casts a water breathing "spell" on you. Too bad it's actually a curse that also prevents you from breathing **air**. She has an antidote she's willing to give you, but first you need to bring her the Red Crystal Tear of the local monster penguin queen; something that is only shed once every several decades and is worth tens of millions. Luckily, she's apparently scared to death of men so she freaks out and starts crying as soon as Lann peeks into her throne room.
-   In **World of Warcraft** the blood of Yogg-Saron becomes Saronite, a nigh-indestructible metal that drives people mad. It's used to make the highest-level weapons and armor for the Knight in Shining Armor classes, as well as fortresses for the Scourge.
-   **Shatterline** have one that crosses into Body Horror territory; when a virus called The Crysatalline that converts organic life-forms into silicon-organic hybrids hits earth, human victims with Crystalline taking over their bodies will begin with internal solidification and crystal growth in their cells. Followed by crystal shards bursting through their skin, and their bodies being ripped apart from the inside as they are converted into silicon-organic hybrids no longer capable of thought.
-   In **Tales of Symphonia** this starts happening to Colette, but is ultimately reversed.
-   **Tales of Vesperia** has this as the fate of Entelexeia upon their deaths.
-   In **Skies of Arcadia**, all Silvites are born with shards of the Silver Moon Crystal in their bodies. However, removing these crystals kills them, as does using the ones inside their bodies as a last resort.
-   One of the charms in **Planescape: Torment** is a Tear of Salieru-Dei, shed by martyred Harmonium officer during his execution.
-   **The Elder Scrolls**
    -   Ebony, the ES series staple of high quality crafting material, is theorized to be the petrified blood of Lorkhan, the "dead" creator god who convinced some of the other et'Ada ("original spirits") to create Mundus and was killed by them for his perceived treachery. They tied his Heart to an arrow and fired it across Tamriel, where it landed in modern day Morrowind. Small Ebony deposits are found across Tamriel where his Heart traveled as it fell, while the greatest deposits are around Red Mountain, where his Heart landed. Ebony also has a number of mystic properties, such as being able to be combined with Daedric souls to forge Daedric materials.
    -   Another theory states that Lorkhan's blood crystallized instead, and was collected by the Ayleids to create the Chim-el Adabal, better known as the Amulet of Kings. It too was known to have immense mystical properties before its destruction in **Oblivion**.
    -   St. Veloth was the legendary Chimer mystic who led his people away from the decadence of the Summerset Isles to their new homeland in Morrowind. When Veloth first laid eyes upon the new homeland of the Chimer, a single tear fell down his face and crystallized. Known as Veloth's Tear, this crystallized tear has immense restorative powers.
    -   An **Oblivion** quest revolves around finding Garridan's Tears, magic crystals.
-   A key element of the Jumi story arc in **Legend of Mana** is that anyone who cries for the Jumi will turn to stone. This specific trope comes into play during the end of the Jumi story arc, when the lead character cries for the Jumi and their tear becomes a Teardrop Crystal, which heals all of the Jumi.
-   **EarthBound (1994)** has the status effect Diamondization. It turns a party member's entire body to diamond, and makes them unable to do anything until healed.
-   The white dragon Quark from **Lunar: The Silver Star** can't understand why humans value Dragon Gems so much, considering where they come from...
-   In **Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night**, protagonist Miriam and Big Bad Gebel are afflicted with the "Dark Curse" which is turning their bodies into crystals. Gebel is already more crystal than man.
-   Rare drops from the monsters in **Monster Hunter** often include gems extracted from the beast's body.
-   **Fallen London**: A bit more dangerous than most; Venom-Rubies are made from droplets of venom from a creature known as the Cantigaster. Expensive, really pretty, and must be handled with gloves if you don't want to die horribly. Not usually that big of a drawback in the Neath, but Cantigaster venom is one of the few things that kill people Deader than Dead.
-   In **Bayonetta 2** this is invoked by the 'Orbs', a demonic currency as opposed to the Holy Halo currency Bayonetta usually collects that looks like crystalline demon blood. However this is only invoked, as they are never referred to as blood, but as a rare metal containing the essence of an infernal's Life Energy.
-   **Devil May Cry** plays straight and predates the Orbs of **Bayonetta** with its own. Red "currency" orbs are blood, green "healing" orbs are fluids, and white "Devil Trigger" orbs are tears and spirit.
-   At the end of **Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days** Xion dies, and her body turns into crystal and shatters, fading into the sky.
-   **Princess Maker 2**:
    -   The Daughter of the game can obtain **Mermaid's Tears** if she goes into adventures to the Southern Lakes and kills a Fishman that carries one of them. If she later goes to the sea and has at least one **Mermaid's Tear** handy, a mermaid will meet up with her and tell her that the Fishmen beat up mermaids to get their tears, plus the jewel she's carrying is made of **her** tears. If the Daughter hands the Tear back to the mermaid, the mermaid rewards her by casting a prayer that raises the girl's Sensitivity and Charisma.
    -   Early in the game, the player can purchase a Spirit Ring from a Travelling Salesman. The Spirit Ring's jewel is actually the egg of the Spring Spirit that inhabits the oasis in the Desert area. Giving the ring will decrease the Daughter's Elegance/Refinement by 50 (as having the Ring gives it a boost), but the Spirit's child will visit the family in a year and grant the girl Sensitivity (and 2000g) in exchange.
-   The Ashan setting of **Heroes of Might and Magic** replaces the Grail from the previous games with the crystalline Tears of Asha (Asha being the Dragon of Order and, for all intents and purposes, the Top God of the setting). They are used for miraculous things in-story and for obtaining a unique town building in-game.
-   In Dark Souls, the Curse status will turn an Undead to crystal once it fills up the status meter. Seath the Scaleless has an attack that makes crystals erupt from the ground that increase Curse buildup when touched, and has several crystal "statues" in his arena. Oddly, other crystal attacks aren't tied to curse and the main monster that uses Curse, Basalisks, aren't connected to crystals.
-   In the DLC "Colors of Madness" for **Darkest Dungeon**, The Corruption of the Comet, an Eldritch Abomination seemingly made of stone and crystals, manifests in a combination of the skin turning into stone and the body being consumed by eerily glowing blue crystals. One of the bosses from that DLC is a mess of mangled flesh and partial corpses held together and puppeteered by a mass of crystals.
-   In **Hades**, Zagreus uses bloodstones, crystals formed from his own blood, to cast magic (or failing that, just throws them at enemies).
-   In **Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin**, Jack's finishing moves on most enemies makes their bodies grow and burst into a mass of crystals, then he pulverizes them in various ways.

Body to Jewel Example in Webcomics

-   Soulstones, found in the **Earthsong** 'verse, formed of semi-sentient minerals which make up the consciousness of planets (read the comic, it's much clearer there) crystallise out of characters' blood INSIDE THEIR CHESTS. If not dealt with correctly by teleporting the relevant character to Earthsong, they then proceed to spontaneously explode.
-   One of Vanka, the sexy thief,'s sexual conquests in **Oglaf** was a man whose semen was made of jewels. Oddly enough, his "normal" gems turned out to be rocks painted with glitter.
-   **Unicorn Jelly**: as a child, Chou was bitten by a Crystal Basilisk, something which is usually fatal as it causes the victim to crystallize and eventually form into a new basilisk. Somehow, she was partially cured by Uni and Lupiko, but has left as a superhumanly intelligent Emotionless Girl with a ring of crystals growing from her head. Because her parents rejected her, she was taken in by Lupiko.

Body to Jewel Example in Web Original

-   **Neopets** has Thyoras Tear<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>, a battle item that protects its user from all attacks for one turn. It is said that "When Thyora was weeping for the loss of her loved one a passing faerie captured a tear and formed a powerful charm. For a brief period of time, nothing may harm the wearer."
-   The Whateley Universe plays this straight with Silver, a supporting student character who **sweats** mithril... which in that universe has a number of convenient mystical properties but is usually rather difficult to produce even alchemically. Once that fact was discovered, the staff was quick to crack down on any attempts to casually exploit her talent, and there has been at least one kidnapping attempt while she was off the school grounds already. It's mentioned offhand that Eldritch's blood is in fact **bloodsteel**, and a heck of a lot of it; Elyzia Grimes says that means her creation was probably the result of a massive ritual sacrifice. It's not - she just took the form of a recurring magical construct when a spiritual parasite finally manifested, but as she jokes, she could likely spot-weld something by slitting her wrist.

Body to Jewel Example in Western Animation

-   The **Adventure Time** episode "Crystals Have Power" features Finn getting kidnapped by a group of gem people and having his body slowly (and painfully) converted into crystal for their queen.
-   Roger from **American Dad!**, his excrements are literal Solid Gold Poop, which is also an Artifact of Death.
-   **The Amazing World of Gumball**: In "The Comic", contrary to what his names implies, Laserheart's optimistic heart is a glowing Heart Symbol shaped crystal on his chest.
-   Starting in **Ben 10: Alien Force**, Kevin's power is to cover himself in any material he touches. One villain of the week had a special crystal that forced his **entire body** into the same kind of crystal, which he intended to chip off and sell little by little. By the way, Kevin was conscious the whole time. Another episode features an alien species who left behind Solid Gold Poop after eating popcorn.
-   In the episode of **Futurama** "Bendin' in the Wind", Dr. Zoidberg reveals that eating (more) dirt causes him to cough up multicolored pearls (which is lucky, since the whole cast apart from Bender didn't have any money and were reduced to eating out of skips).
-   **Gargoyles**: The eye of Odin.
-   In **Steven Universe**, the Gems have this as their basic biology (or would that be geology?). When they get hurt too much, they poof back into a gemstone to take time to heal and then reform. Technically Steven is the only one that really counts for this trope, being a Half-Human Hybrid with an organic body around his gemstone while every other gem just has a Hard Light construct.
-   **Transformers: Prime**: Blood Gems. Primus in Cybertron's core produces Energon, the "life blood" of Cybertronians, whilst Dark Energon is the Blood of Unicron and is produced by his body at the Earth's core. Both materials crystallize after being shed by either god, and Dark Energon in particular has had a few nefarious uses and roles over the series.

Body to Jewel Example in Real Life

-   Pearls are the one type of precious gemstone that's **always** a product of this trope, being formed from encrusted bodily secretions that accumulate around irritating particles inside the shells of bivalves.
-   Two more gemstones are also always of biological origin—but rather than coming from an animal, the living being in question is a plant:
    -   Amber is the fossilized resin of ancient trees.
    -   Jet is entirely made of fossilized plant remains compressed together. It's actually a gem-quality variety of coal.
-   Given that both human body and diamond mostly consist of carbon, the former can be turned into the latter. For example, LifeGem will turn a lock of hair or the cremated remains of a person into gemstones.
-   Depending on their composition, kidney or bladder stones sometimes come in pretty or even sparkly colors. Not bad for crystallized urine. They aren't really fun to pass though.
-   Gallstones can be very pretty and shiny.
-   There have been several reported incidents of children whose tears turn into something solid, such as quartz or wood splinters. Most if not all of these were fakes, however.
-   Bezoar stones can form in the stomach just as enteroliths form in the intestines.
-   It doesn't happen often, but it is possible for fossils—which are of course the mineralized remains of a living being—to be mineralized as opal. Around the world—but mostly in Australia—everything from ancient wood to dinosaur bones have been found fossilized as opal. Opal is of course usually considered a pretty gem.
-   There have been cases where an embryo or fetus dies in utero (or in an ectopic pregnancy), only instead of being expelled or reabsorbed, the fetus becomes calcified and stays right where it is. Some women don't even know they have a lithopedion, and some of these can stay in place for **decades!**
