Bespectacled Cutie: 
There's just something about glasses that makes some characters look more endearing than they would be without them. As glasses are fragile by nature and wearing them is normally (but not always) a sign of poor eyesight, they add an additional layer of vulnerability to book-smart and Endearingly Dorky characters. Glasses with big, round frames that accentuate certain facial features by making them look rounder and more youthful looking are a common glasses style among these types of characters.

Personality-wise, Bespectacled Cuties are sweet and affable by nature. Some are very friendly and trusting of other people, while others are painfully shy and prefer to fade into the background. As intelligence is often seen as a defining trait for such characters, they tend to double as Cute Bookworms. Sometimes the presence or absence of glasses shows a change in personality.

Glasses on a Hot Librarian or Sexy Secretary are a completely different thing. The Seemingly-Wholesome '50s Girl may use glasses to _pretend_ to be this trope.

Meganekko is the Anime Fanspeak term for female anime characters that fit this mold.

May overlap with Cute Bookworm, Endearingly Dorky, and/or Lovable Nerd, traits associated with these types of characters.

For characters who are sexualized in-universe because of their glasses, see Glasses Are Sexy. When glasses are used as a signifier that they've aged, see Glasses of Aging.

Bespectacled Cutie Example in Advertising

-   A spot for Truist banks features a little girl, Jessica, who is not only a bespectacled cutie but she's heroic as well. She sees a car about to hit a puddle in the street and drench her classmate's school project so she gets in front, opens her umbrella and shields her friend and project.

Bespectacled Cutie Example in Anime and Manga

-   In **Ah... and Mm... Are All She Says**, Toda's debut one-shot **Ferris Wheel Reversal** stars a glasses-wearing high-school girl. And despite the manga itself is quite polarizing among readers, even those who don't like it admit her glasses are quite cute.
    
    **Anonymous Imageboard User:** Yeah, the chick had nothing going for her except the glasses.
    
-   **Ah! My Goddess**: Hasegawa Sora is a shy platonic friend of the protagonist who wears glasses.
-   **Agent Aika**: Aika's young sidekick Rion Aida wears big glasses, and is often considered cute by other characters. Rudolf Hagen himself comments she's going to grow into a beautiful woman when he captures her.
-   **Ai Yori Aoshi**: Taeko Minazuki is an innocent, adorable and attractive Red-Headed meganekko. Who also plays the maid and sidekick within the series, she frequently has awkward and clumsy moments that gets her into trouble with Mrs Miyabi a lot plus being Tina's more responsible and modest opposite.
-   **Attack on Titan**: The cheerful and outgoing Hange Zoe, who is a veteran member of the Survey Corps.
-   **Battle Spirits Shonen Toppa Bashin** has Fumiko Otonashi, who goes by the nickname "Meganeko". Her real name isn't even mentioned until later into the series. She's a polite and sweet, yet practical girl. The twist is that she starts wearing contacts later into the series, because it's easier for her to read the cards when she starts playing Battle Spirits. But her friends continue calling her Meganeko, because it's too weird for them otherwise.
-   **Barakamon**: Jou Tatenaga, who is a adorkable glasses girl, and a bit of a doormat
-   **Black Butler**: Mey-Rin, the maid of the Phantomhive Manor is a clumsy, quirky and apologetic meganekko who appears every so often in the series mostly as a comedic character. However she is a lot more talented than she seems and is quite the beauty as well
-   **Chocotto Sister**: Chitose, the landlady, wears thick glasses and is very self-conscious about it. A boy calling her a "four-eyed dog" in high school is a major emotional hurt of hers and Haruma's complimenting her on how she looks wearing them is a large part of why she falls for him.
-   **Doctor Slump**: The Robot Girl protagonist Arale is possibly a pioneer of this trope. The first chapter of the manga has a panel of her creator Senbei giving her glasses to be able to see better. Since then she always wears them, which adds a more adorable touch to her design and reflects her childlike and innocent nature. Unlike most examples, however, she's **not** vulnerable, as she's incredibly strong and outgoing; the fact that she's a robot who needs to wear glasses is mainly a jab at Senbei's incompetence.
-   **GTO: The Early Years**: Ayumi Murakoshi is a cute, glasses-wearing girl Hot Teacher who Ryuji falls for.
-   From **Mobile Fighter G Gundam** we have Bunny Higgins, who's glasses give her a sweet sophistication; in contrast, Natasha's glasses accentuate the sternness of a woman who's all business.
-   **Hanaukyō Maid Team**. Head maid of the Technology department Ikuyo Suzuki wears glasses. Most of the time she is cute and friendly, but at times she can develop Scary Shiny Glasses and become a Mad Scientist.
-   **Hellsing** plays with this twice over:
    -   The Iscariot nun Yumiko is a simple, sweet, shy girl with her glasses on. Take them off and she becomes an impossibly psychotic, enraged killing machine.
    -   The vampire Millenium commander Rip Van Winkle is an attractive young-looking woman with glasses, but is also Cute and Psycho, merrily singing opera whilst slaughtering enemy soldiers.
-   **Hidamari Sketch**: Sae, who's generally pleasant, consistently described as "beautiful" in the manga's character profiles, and is called "a walking encyclopedia".
-   **Kimagure Orange Road**: Manami Kasuga is one of the earlier embodiments of this trope. A cute, sweet, responsible girl, she keeps the Kasuga household together. Be warned - she **can't see anything** if she loses her glasses or contacts.
-   **Komi Can't Communicate**: Himiko Agari's glasses highlight how she's an endearing Nervous Wreck of a Nice Girl.
-   **K-On!**: Nodoka is pretty calm and friendly, and like everyone else, mostly gets annoyed with Ritsu. Mio shows she can pull off the look by borrowing(?) her glasses temporarily, leaving her with 3s for eyes in manga (while her coolness remains unchanged during the same scene in anime).
-   **Lucky Star**: Miyuki is a sweet, Cute Bookworm with huge, round glasses. Lampshaded when Konata comments that her glasses are part of her Moe appeal. She also blurts that her email address is (translated) IXTRALUVGIRLSWITHGLASSES, while in a crowded bus, earning some odd looks.
-   **Magic Knight Rayearth**: Fuu Hououji is usually known for wearing her glasses because she's a bookworm, video game nerd, and claims to have poor eyesight. She's also the only one who is part of a blatant Official Couple (with Ferio) and this sometimes leaves her stammering, blushing, temporarily losing sense of direction. However, she only wears her glasses when she's not wearing her final armor and riding her Rune God; in those forms, she ditches her glasses and claims that the Rune God's power fixes her eyesight.
-   Lampshaded in **Mononoke Sharing**. All the girls are having a selfie competition to see who can get the most likes online. Mizuchi's attempts to up her game in the second round by removing her glasses, only to find that it has the opposite effect and has to drop out.
-   **My-HiME**: Yukino Kikukawa, whose shyness provides a perfect balance for her very outspoken best friend Haruka.
-   **My-Otome**: Irina also wears cute-girl frames, but they're smaller and rounder.
-   **Nagasarete Airantou**: Subverted where Chikage initially seems to have the proper personality but ends up having Scary Shiny Glasses and is as crazy as the other girls on the island. However, played straight with her mother Shizuka, wherein she's pleasant, and **clever** to fool even the lead male.
-   **One Piece** has Tashigi, an attractive young Marine captain whose glasses are a source of both cuteness and humor, due to her clumsiness and Running Gag to mistake random people for her superior officer Smoker without her glasses on.
-   **Please Teacher!**: Mizuho Kazami, is an adorably attractive teacher who is in fact an alien. A lot of her charm comes from how nice and sweet she is, with and without glasses.
-   **Queen's Blade** has Cattleya, who plays the trope straight with her sweet, motherly personality, but also subverts stereotype by being the biggest fighter (in more ways than one) and the most physically powerful.
-   **Read or Die**: Yomiko Readman is considered **the** Queen of all Meganekko, thanks to her adorable looks and deep passion for reading books. During **R.O.D the TV** it's mentioned that she's **over thirty**. Oddly, her looks haven't changed at all since her first manga appearance, when she stated (honestly) that she was 23.
-   **Real Account**: Got Chiho, seemingly your typical Shrinking Violet in her early 20s. Forced to take nudes online for some time. But actually, she sent those pictures willingly and is a huge pervert.
-   **Revolutionary Girl Utena**: Anthy's gentle and intelligent nature seems to fit the role, though her apparent ditzyness is explained in a dark and extreme subversion later on. Also lampshaded in that the finale reveals that Anthy doesn't even NEED to wear glasses, and was seemingly wearing them at Akio's order, most likely to make her look more submissive and timid. When she finally breaks ties with him, she illustrates this by taking off her glasses and leaving them on his desk, and heading out into the world without them. This is hinted at in one of the next episode previews much earlier in the series where Anthy casually remarks that she can see better WITHOUT her glasses.
-   **Rizelmine**: Papa C's daughter, Kyouko Yachigusa, has a thing for the main character, Rizel Iwaki, and is usually wearing glasses. When in glasses, she's shy and unsure. Take off her glasses and she becomes a horny little predator.
-   **Sachiare**: Tomoharu's bride Sachiko is ungodly cute already, with her glasses on it gets taken to lethal levels.
-   **Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei**: Harumi Fujiyoshi is a meganekko, and sees her teacher's wearing of glasses as one of his most attractive traits. In fact, when one day he loses his glasses and comes to class wearing contacts, Harumi promptly **slaps them out of his head**, forcing him to procure a new pair of spectacles.
-   **Shoujo Sect**: Honda Shinobu has bad eyesight. Within the story itself she wears contacts, but a short series of throwaway gags features her wearing her specs as she, Kirin, and Maya discuss how a girl in glasses should go about kissing another girl in glasses. Maya worries that if one of the girls removes her glasses it will eliminate her Moe factor, but Kirin assures her that a true Meganekko is always a Meganekko in essence, even if she isn't wearing glasses.
-   **Soul Eater Not!**: Mai Thi Hoang aka Eternal Feather, is one of the DWMA's most intelligent and kindest bespectacled young ladies of the academy.
-   **Strawberry Marshmallow**: Matsuri is kind and studious, if easily fooled. She's a cute kid with or without glasses, but as she's Blind Without 'Em, and kind of clumsy at the best of times.
-   **Thriller Restaurant** has Anko, but she, while usually is shy and soft-spoken, can also lash out when too angry.
-   In **Tokyo Ghoul**:
    -   The oft-discussed horror novelist Sen Takatsuki turns out to be one. During public appearances, she noticeably doesn't wear them but on her personal time, she wears large-rimmed glasses that suit her cheerful and quirky personality. Kaneki explains that she is known as a great beauty, with many fans more interested in her looks than her novels.
    -   In the sequel, Haise Sasaki fits the trope's cheerful and kind bookworm element, and wears enormous reading glasses. It creates a strong contrast with his mentor Arima, who wears Stoic Spectacles.
-   **Tokyo Mew Mew**: The shy, tormented Midorikawa Retasu who loses her glasses after her Transformation Sequence into Mew Lettuce. Might have something to do with her water-based powers, but might also be that she's strongest in a fit of blind rage.
-   **We Never Learn**: At only 143cm tall, Rizu Ogata is already a strong contender for being the cutest out of the characters, but her glasses make her look even more precious.
-   **Yu-Gi-Oh!**: Rebecca Hopkins is a Deliberately Cute Child and Genki Girl who wears red-framed glasses (from season four onwards).
-   **Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL** Cathy is a shy Shrinking Violet but she's far more liberated when dueling, not only removing the glasses but wearing Elegant Gothic Lolita and letting a whole different personality emerge.

-   **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (IDW)**: Lindsey Baker is somewhat of an inversion of this. She's a bespectled woman of science, but she's not exactly friendly. She is a good person however, and shows a much more warm and caring side to her loved ones.

-   Rule 63 versions of Harry Potter tend to depict the GenderFlipped Harry as this — generally more athletic and less shy than your average Bespectacled Cutie, but with the same adorable aesthetics.

Bespectacled Cutie Example in Literature

-   **Beyond the Boundary**: Mirai Kuriyama. She initially appears clumsy, awkward, and tries not to associate herself with others, but is actually kindhearted and sweet (not to mention a badass).

(This is also a direct inversion of the Beautiful All Along trope of the girl taking off her glasses and magically becoming pretty.)
-   **Modern Family**: Alex Dunphy, the second youngest daughter, between her pretty older sister, and her goofy younger brother. She's the smartest of the family, but also the frequent butt of their jokes and jabs. Due to her intellectual nature, Haley berates her as a nerd/geek.

-   **Torchwood**: Toshiko Sato, the resident tech geek, frequently dons geeky reading glasses, just to add to that doe-eyed, earnest Asian geek/unnoticed-but-insanely-good-looking thing she's got going on.

The former, the Moe Rose-Haired Sweetie sister of Werner and member of the SPICA mercenary team; the latter, Intrepid Reporter with a frequent smile and a blindness to danger if it means getting that exclusive scoop. Both cuties are crowned with glasses that they almost always wear, the exception being when Maria puts them away for a fancy dress occasion on a cruise ship.

        Snake: Do I need to clear things with Otacon before I ask her out?

    -   For some reason, Bianca gained glasses during the two years between **Black/White** and **Black 2/White 2**.

-   Becca in **Melody** is smart and well-mannered, but also painfully shy.
-   **Sono Hanabira Ni Kuchizuke Wo**: Played with by Kaede, who is shy and kind and is the Class Representative but is really only an average student.

-   **Sleepless Domain**: A series of flashbacks reveal that, before she became the famous magical girl Alchemical Air, Sylvia used to be a cute and somewhat bookish girl with a pair of square glasses. It's quite the contrast from the more confident and glamorous persona she adopted as a magical girl.

Except she's actually Varrick's Dragon, and described by him as a "cold, heartless war machine." She becomes this more traditionally once the two of them pull a Heel–Face Turn in the final season, and she consequently starts showing a wider range of emotions.
