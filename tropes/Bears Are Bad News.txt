_He murders in the mountains and fights with ev'ry clan  
His teeth and jowls have ripped many a highland man!_

_"Just so you know... I don't feel mercy or sympathy. Cuz I'm a bear, after all."_

Want to make a bad situation worse? Add a bear!

Just as monkeys are used to make something funnier, bears have a knack for scaring the crap out of everyone. Polar and brown bears are the largest extant land-based predators in the world, with a penchant for aggressive behavior, so it's easy to see why.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Because of this, throwing a bear into a scene is the best way to let the audience know that our heroes have gone beyond rock bottom and are now totally screwed.

In many a film and television show, our heroes will quite often find themselves cooped up in a cabin as a killer bear is just outside, trying to get in.

This can sometimes be Truth in Television. Being between a mama bear and her cub has been justly described as the most dangerous place on earth, but any number of bears can be very dangerous indeed.

Another issue is that bears are very intelligent (often regarded as being very close to chimpanzees) and they actually have individual personalities. This adds to their unpredictability, as how a bear reacts to a certain situation will entirely depend on both the bear itself and the mood it's in at the time.

Bears have such a long history of scaring the Pooh out of human beings that most of the names we've ever given them are derived from conciliatory euphemisms, as part of an old taboo against naming something so dangerous. The English word 'bear' originally meant "brown one", and the Slavic word _medved_ originally meant "honey eater." Even the original Proto-Indo-European word was related to the word for "destruction", proving just how ancient this particular Primal Fear is.

Incidentally, this same fear has also inspired great respect, as such, a great way to raise the credentials of any badass, villain, or Anti-Hero if you give them a bear. Especially as a mount, because there's nothing cooler than riding a bear... except maybe a robot bear or zombie bear, or a bear made of fire or ice...

Ursine Aliens can also invoke this.

Do not confuse this with _The Bad News Bears_ (the Trope Namer, though not an example), with the Bearer of Bad News, with The Bear, which is about a big hairy Manly Gay guy, or with Exit, Pursued by a Bear, though that trope's name is an example of this trope. In the Land Down Under, you should watch out for drop bears, though those are supposedly carnivorous koalas rather than actual bears — but even real koalas can be plenty dangerous in their own right, being Australian Wildlife and all. Mama Bear may be related but is usually metaphorical.

For animals that tend to get a similar treatment, see Savage Wolves, Cruel Elephant, Rhino Rampage, Maniac Monkeys (and Killer Gorilla), Threatening Shark, and Reptiles Are Abhorrent (and Never Smile at a Crocodile). Often a Super-Trope to Fighting Panda, for when pandas are portrayed as martial artists capable of kicking ass.

Contrast with Beary Funny and Beary Friendly, which are about more positive depictions of bears.

Bears Are Bad News Example in Advertising

-   According to the Boston Bruins hockey team, if you do not follow the unwritten rules and etiquette of being a hockey fan, a giant bear **will** find you and kick your ass. And when it's done doing that, it will dance. The bear has since become the team's commercial mascot, as it has been shown promoting new jerseys, rallying fans for a new season, celebrating Christmas and doing a little exercise. But it still finds time to punish those who violate good hockey fan behavior.
-   Australian rum brand Bundaberg Rum features a polar bear as its mascot, the Bundy Bear, who prominently features in their advertising. Things do tend to be worse with "Bundy" around, but that's got more to do with how he's an enormous Troll to tourists.
-   A Capri-Sun commercial has a kid beating a giant cyborg bear with the straw from his pouch.
-   Is it any wonder that Sugar Bear is one of the few cereal mascots who successfully runs off anyone who tries to take his Golden Crisp as opposed to all the other sorry saps like Lucky the Leprechaun and the Trix Rabbit?
    -   During the sugar-is-now-evil transition from Super Sugar Crisp to Super Golden Crisp in the 1980s, Sugar Bear could turn himself into Super Bear. Super Bear was a realistic-looking grizzly bear with no traces of cuddliness whatsoever. Eventually, Post figured out that a scary carnivore might not be the best mascot for a children's cereal, and the concept was dropped. **Breakfast of the Gods** takes advantage of that brief time that Super Bear was scary.
    -   In the early '60s, when Sugar Bear became a sweater-wearing hipster, his TV ads showed him barging into sweet old Granny's house and stealing her cereal. A thieving nuisance, but at least he was mellow and good-natured.
-   An ad for Hotels dot com has a family lost in some woods, and the father wandering outside the car briefly, before a bear seen briefly in the background chases him back and forth. In the end, though, he just winds up, inexplicably, with just a broken arm as a result of the encounter.
-   McDonald's is apparently so delicious that even bears will attack your car for it. In one memorable commercial, the Hamburglar planned to scare Ronald and the others out of their cheeseburgers with a bear costume, but they were onto him; they planned to humor him for a while, but unfortunately, a **real** bear came along first, who they mistook for him. Suffice to say, Hilarity Ensued.
-   Orangina has a dancing bear for its commercial who is about to attack a doe... until he sees the doe drinking Orangina!
-   How could a Panda Bear be evil? If you don't say "no" to its Panda Cheese, you're doomed.
-   **Biggie Bear** of the "Parents For Responsible Viewing" PSAs. Doesn't get any more bad than pretending to be good, then committing murder, drug supplying, and rape.
-   An old Pepsi commercial had five bears emerging from the wilderness to terrorize a small town by spelling out "Pepsi" in a distinctly "YMCA"-style dance. After the townspeople fearfully comply with the beasts' request, a man remarks, "Heaven help us if they ever learn the Macarena." Coca-Cola, on the other hand, is famous for its commercials with lovable, cute polar bears. A serious subversion.
-   An ad for Safe Auto insurance lampoons other insurance company mascots as an obnoxious bear that goes around from car to car terrorizing people, growling at them to "Switch and Save!" You can see him in action here.
-   Want someone to bully campers into putting out their fires? Say hello to Smokey Bear! An aversion to the trope, actually, since Smokey is, in fact, a wise, friendly bear, but woe upon anyone who tries to destroy forests in his presence!
-   This bear working in the movie business is almost a subversion, weren't it for the occasional tantrum. Also, he seems to be very fond of Stuff Blowing Up.
-   An entry in the Allstate Insurance "Mayhem" ads has Mayhem as one of these. Papa Bear woke up from the "best hibernation of my life" with an empty stomach and spots the cooler in parked car. Bear trashes the car and chows down.
-   A State Farm Insurance ad in the same vein is Based on a True Story. A client called State Farm to make a report of a bear breaking into the garage and helping themselves to the contents of the freezer located in said garage.

-   **Boonie Bears**: Downplayed. While the eponymous bears do have a tendency to mess with Logger Vick, it's only in relation to his job as a woodcutter since the bears don't want their forest destroyed. The bears are actually on decent terms with Logger Vick otherwise and would never outright attack him.
-   **Happy Heroes**: In episode 10, a bear attacks Big M. and makes off with his bread. It comes back at the end of the episode, this time going after his fish.
-   **Lamput**: In "Skinny Monster", Fat Doc tries to get the attention of a creature he thinks is Slim Doc as a monster. Slim Doc comes back a few seconds later and demonstrates his monster potion has worn off; the creature Fat Doc poked turns out to be a bear and chases the two for having pestered it.
-   **Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf**: It's a Running Gag that Wolffy has a tendency to be attacked or otherwise bothered by bears.

Bears Are Bad News Example in Comic Strips

-   **Calvin and Hobbes** has a Story Arc where Calvin decides to run away from home with Hobbes because he tried to push the car out of the garage and it accidentally rolled into a ditch. Walking through the woods, they think they hear something big crashing through the brush, and climb a tree out of fear that it's a bear:
    
    **Calvin**: There it is! The bear's coming out of the brush! Oh no! It looks like it's on its hind legs! Bears stand up only when they're really mad!!  
    **Hobbes**: Wait, that's not a bear. That's your mom!  
    **Calvin**: **AAUGHH!** EVEN WORSE! CLIMB HIGHER! CLIMB HIGHER!
    
-   There's a **Far Side** cartoon in which a bar fight is happening in an old Western saloon. From the speed at which people are running out the door/being thrown through the window, it's implicit that there's a pretty tough guy inside. Well, his bear is parked outside among the horses.
    
    -   Gary Larson actually did this a few times. Another example can be summarized by quoting the caption. Two bear hunters are examining the gruesome fate of a third, and one of them says:
    
    -   In one strip a shark tricks a bunch of beach-goers into the water by shouting "Bear! Bear!"
    -   In another one, the well-known fact that female bears are fiercely protective of their offspring was lampooned, where the cartoon had a tired office worker absentmindedly stepping into an elevator between a mother grizzly and her cub. (She seemed docile in the scene as shown, but according to the caption, what was about to happen would not be pleasant.)
    -   Another one has two boys playing catch with what appears to be a teddy bear...
    
    And no one ever heard from the Anderson Brothers again.
    
    -   Another has two bears observing some picnickers, and one says to the other:
    
    "C'mon Look at these fangs! Look at these claws! You think we're supposed to eat just honey and berries"
    
-   Garfield tends to have trouble with bears on Jon's Horrible Camping Trips; one of the worst (which provides the current image for Mistaken Identity) was when he found what he **thought** was his teddy bear Pooky away from the campsite, only to find the real Pooky and a **very** angry bear there. "Momma!" cries the — real — bear cub he's holding.
-   A recurring storyline in **Non Sequitur** is "Homer the Reluctant Soul" which involves Homer's numerous lives and rebirths; many of them end at the hands of a bear; at the end of one of his lives, it revealed that this is actually the same bear, whom he has met in **the bear's** numerous lives. (Its name in the afterlife is Maurice; when he confronts it there, it simply says, "Right, like the food chain is **my** fault?")
-   **Rhymes With Orange** has a strip set in an office building. There's a live bear in a display case with the case labeled, "To put your emergency in perspective, break glass."

Bears Are Bad News Example in Fairy Tales

-   "The Cat on the Dovrefell": The traveler's white bear chases a huge pack of trolls out of the farm when one of them disrupts its sleep.

Bears Are Bad News Example in Films — Animated

-   **The 3 Little Pigs: The Movie**: Played with; the first bear we see is friendly, and quietly helps Feeno make mortar for brick-laying. The next bears we see are some of the dinner guests at the inn. One is fairly passive, and asks for a jar of honey, only to be thrown out by his fellow patrons for not requesting meat. The rest of the bears play the trope straight, and are just as rowdy as the other guests, slamming their fists on tables, and later along with the rest of the guests, trashing the place in a riot.
-   **Alpha and Omega**: Downplayed. Several bears threaten Humphrey and Kate due to Humphrey accidentally making a cub cry, but they're defeated by the wolves. Subverted in the sequel **A Howl-iday Adventure**. Fearing that they might experience a repeat of what happened in the first film, Humphrey initially refuses to help a lost bear cub before doing so. But at the film's climax, the bear cub actually gets his mother and their fellow bears to effectively use this trope to defeat King and his rogue wolves and force them into retreating.
-   **Balto** features a fight with a bear near the beginning of Balto's journey to find the medicine, and the bear is portrayed as outright **demonic**. It's only defeated by falling through the ice and drowning.
    -   This carries over to the sequel, where Balto and Aleu fight a bear. Thanks to his embodiment of an animal totem, he comes across as more of a spirit guide, but he's still fairly menacing and seems to believe Scare 'Em Straight is the best way to guide them.
    -   Even though they are cubs and thus good the polar bears Muk and Luk spell this trope for their babysitter, "Uncle" Boris (who at one point says "I hate bears!"). Good thing that they apparently are stuck as cubs forever (if the time between the movie and sequels is of any indication).
-   **Billy & Mandy’s Big Boogey Adventure**: Horror's Hand reveals that Irwin's worst fear is having to tell jokes to bears, which causes an entire nightclub where the guests are angry grizzlies to spawn, with poor Irwin as a comedian. Naturally, Irwin fails to entertain the ursids and they all promptly gang up on him and maul him alive. Thankfully, they all get poofed away when the Hand reveals the Boogeyman's worst terror (being unable to scare others at all), which the heroes find ridiculous.
-   **Brave** has Mor'du. He's twelve feet tall with razor sharp claws, one glowing red eye and an almost rabid taste for human flesh. You know, for kids! He also ripped off the leg of King Fergus, father of protagonist Merida, leading him to have an unending grudge against bears. Given Merida leads her queen mom to become a bear, Bears Are **Really** Bad News...
-   **Brother Bear**: The main character sees bears as irritations at first and develops a full-blown hatred towards them after one inadvertently caused his brother's death. Subverted when he turns into one and finds out that bears actually aren't so terrible.
-   **The Christmas Tree**: At one point, Judy's kids and their dog Licorice get attacked by a bear with an uncanny resemblance to Baloo from **The Jungle Book (1967)**.
-   **Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs** has living gummy bears trying to take out a Flying Car gremlin style, until being stopped by a gummy bear-loving monkey.
-   **The Fox and the Hound**: In the climax, a bear is portrayed as some demonic beast spawned from the depths of Hell. (This has a lot to do with the fact that Amos shoots it but only wounds it, making it very, **very** angry, as wounded animals often are.) It might not be **the** most terrifying antagonist to appear in a Disney film, but it's definitely on the list.
-   **Fun and Fancy Free**: Averted with Bongo, Lulubelle and the gang of friendly bears, but played straight with the huge, monstrous bear, Lumpjaw.
-   **The Little Polar Bear**: Averted with Lars, his parents and his friend Greta. Downplayed with Brutus, a grown-up polar bear who serves as a major antagonist and Lars' archenemy in the films. He dislikes Lars for ruining his seal hunting plans. However he is merely a simple neighbourhood grump and not that much of a villain, although he does commit some minor immoral acts such as interrogating a lemming and threatening Lars' dad in the original film and leaving Lars with his friends behind on a train to be transported away from the Arctic to the south in the sequel **The Little Polar Bear 2 The Mysterious Island**.
-   **NIMONA**: One of the title character's forms is a bear, and is seen as a villain.
-   **Over the Hedge**: Vincent is one of the three Big Bads, and insists that R.J. that he must find food for him, or else he will eat him.
-   **Puss in Boots: The Last Wish** features the Three Bears Crime Family as part of the Big Bad Ensemble, led by their adopted daughter Goldilocks. They are appropriately huge and strong enough to bust holes in a brick house with their bear hands.
-   **Sherlock Gnomes**: Irene's bouncer, bodyguard and general enforcer is a gigantic, hulking teddy bear who is missing an eye.
-   **Sing**: The street performer Mike runs afoul of the Mafia, portrayed by bears and speaking with Russian accents, when he tries cheating at cards.
-   **Tom Sawyer (2000)**: The Big Bad is a massive, hulking anthro grizzly named Injurin' Joe, a far more sadistic and deranged version of Injun Joe from the novel. In an otherwise lighthearted musical film, the guy stands out as a particularly monstrous and spine-chilling antagonist.
-   **Toy Story 3**: Lotso, the teddy bear at Sunnyside Daycare, and Big Bad of the film, is as bad as a bear comes. He was once a nice and friendly toy, until he was lost and replaced by the girl he belonged to, causing him to snap and become monstrous. After arriving at Sunnyside, he took over the daycare and treated it like a prison for new toys, which he leaves to the mercy of the daycare's destructive toddlers.
-   **Were Going On A Bear Hunt**: Lampshaded, in contrast to the children's book on which it's based. The children perceive the bear as a danger and run away from it, despite it being conveyed to the audience that the bear is a gentle, friendly creature in this version.
-   **Zootopia**: The crime boss Mister Big has polar bear bodyguards.

Bears Are Bad News Example in Humor

-   A Russian joke goes something like this:
    
    A guy is lost in the woods, so he just stands there and keeps shouting "Hello!"  
    Suddenly, he feels a pat on the shoulder. He turns around and sees a bear, who asks, "Dude, why are you yelling?"  
    "In case someone hears me?"  
    "Well, I heard you. Feeling better?"
    
-   There's a joke about someone in the woods who finds a praying bear. There are many versions of it.
    
    -   The version where it's a generic hunter in the woods:
    
    **A hunter is out hunting bear in the woods. He sees one, lines up his sights, takes a shot, and misses. The bear sees the hunter and charges towards him. The hunter tries to take another shot, but finds he's out of ammo. He throws down the gun and starts running away, but he realizes that the bear is going to catch up to him.  
    The hunter falls to his knees and starts praying. He says, "Dear Lord, I ask that you let this bear find some religion before he does me in."**
    
    **He turns around, and the bear stops, falls to its knees, and starts praying. The bear says, "Dear Lord, for this food I am about to receive, I am truly grateful..."**
    
    -   The version where it's a Christian in the woods:
    
    **There's a Christian who's hiking in the woods one day when he comes upon an angry bear. The bear stands up on its hind legs and growls ferociously, clearly preparing to charge. In panic, the Christian starts to run, but the bear follows close on his heels.  
    Finally the hiker comes to a cliff, so he drops to his knees and asks God to please make this bear a good Christian bear. To the hiker's amazement, the bear suddenly stops growling, falls to his knees and folds his paws together in prayer! "Thank you, Lord!" exclaimed the Christian.**
    
    **"Thank you, Lord!" exclaims the bear, "for this meal I'm about to receive!"**
    
    -   The version where it's a Jew in the woods:
    
    **A man, out for a walk in the woods came across a bear. Frightened for his life, he ran as fast as he could to escape and hide in a cave. He was horrified to find that the bear followed him into the cave trapping him. He closed his eyes and recited "Shema Yisrael" in anticipation of his final moments. When he is finished, he opens his eyes and is surprised to see the bear in front of him with his eyes closed — also praying!  
    The man thinks to himself "how lucky am I to be cornered by what must be the only Jewish bear! He's frum! We're mishpocheh... and I'm not Kosher. I'm saved!" He then listens more carefully to the bear's prayer: "...hamotzi lechem min haaretz."**
    
    -   The version where it's an atheist in the woods (the longest one):
    
    **A photographer, who was also a confirmed atheist, decided to go into the woods to capture photos of the fall foliage. It was a beautiful day: fall colors, birds chirping, a babbling brook, and a gentle breeze rustling the leaves.  
    While snapping shots, the photographer heard a noise behind him and whirled around to see a huge bear coming through the bushes.  
    He dropped his camera and ran. And kept running and running... and looking behind him, he noticed the bear was gaining on him! He was so scared that tears came to his eyes. He ran faster, but the bear was closing in on him. He ran faster yet and tripped over a root. Rolling over onto his back, the man saw the bear rise to his full height and raise a huge paw... and the atheist cried out, "Oh, God, no!"  
    And everything stopped. The birds stopped chirping. The brook stopped babbling. The gentle breeze stopped. And the bear froze with his paw in the air. And the man heard a booming voice say, "Young man. For years you've doubted my very existence, but now that your life is in peril you call my name to help you. Why should I do so?"  
    And the man thought for a moment, and said, "Yes, you are right. If you are God, then it would be hypocritical of me to become a Christian at this point in my life. But, do you think that you could at least make the bear a Christian for today?" And the booming voice was quiet for a moment and then said, "Done."  
    And everything started again. The birds chirping, brook babbling, and gentle breeze rustling the leaves. And the bear slowly lowered his paw. Then the bear put his paws together, and bowed his massive head and said, "Dear Lord, please bless this food we are about to eat."**
    
-   An old hunter's joke: How do you tell the difference between a black bear and a grizzly bear? Climb a tree. If the bear climbs up after you and kills you, it's a black bear. If it knocks the tree down and kills you, it's a grizzly bear. And if there's no tree in sight, it's a polar bear.
-   A Feghoot, courtesy of Tumblr:
    
    If you find yourself hiking and you see a bear, there are three ways to avoid confrontation with the animal. The first way is the most well-known, is to size them up and make yourself look large to dissuade them from engaging. Another one I heard about is to attempt camouflage with the darker areas of the forest (although I can’t confirm this one). A third way that is extremely unlikely is to already be hiking with me, since every morning I take a bath in bear pheromones (do not ask why, it’s a thing).  
    In summary:  
    So darken your clothes, or strike a violent pose. Maybe they’ll leave you alone (but not me)

Bears Are Bad News Example in Music

-   Genesis:
    
    But if you're sitting there beside her/And a bear comes in the room/And you keep on going 'cause you're unaware/Then you know that you are there/Beyond the silver rainbow/You won't know if you're coming or going
    
-   Subverted in Grandaddy's "Silver Lake" video — at one point the band is performing in a small cabin, Jason Lytle opens the door, sees a bear and immediately shuts the door again. The bear then lets himself in through the back door, to the band's visible concern... But apparently it just enjoyed the music and wanted to rock out to it — the bear even gives Lytle a high five. Adding to the humor is deliberate Special Effect Failure — the bear is obvious green-screened stock footage when it's outside the door, and a man in a bear suit once it's inside.
-   If you are the band Horion and you wanted to release an album named "No Fear Restriction", what you'd put on the cover to match? Right...
-   The back of the album cover of Jethro Tull's **Stormwatch** has a 1000 foot tall polar bear stomping on an oil refinery station.
-   Nekrogoblikon has a song called Bears.
    
    Claws leaving scars, giant teeth tearing skin,  
    Fur on the outside and darkness within!
    
-   Radiohead's album **Kid A**'s marketing campaign told a vague but disturbing story about genetically modified bears killing everyone. The "Radiohead Bear" has remained the band's logo ever since.
-   "Bears" by the Royal Guardsmen is built around this trope.

Bears Are Bad News Example in Myths & Religion

-   **The Bible**:
    -   Elisha in 2 Kings 2:23-24, while walking up to Bethel, was insulted by some bandits. They had called him "baldhead" and implied that he had been complicit in the death of Elijah. His response? Summoning two bears to come and maul 42 of them, making this trope Older Than Feudalism. There's a reason why this story isn't included in compilations of Bible stories meant for toddlers.
    -   Also, David kills a bear and a lion that threaten his flock. People tend to forget that although he was only 12ish when he fought the giant Goliath, he was a pretty badass kid.
    -   Even **God Himself** states that bears make things worse in Amos 5:19: "As if a man should run from a lion and be attacked by a bear."
-   **The Element Encyclopedia of Witchcraft** noted a conspicuous absence of bears in some shamanic societies' legends, probably owing to the He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named-ness. Though Celtic lore does mention the bear as the king of the animals (a distinction kept until the popularity of the lion as a symbol for Jesus).
-   The Inuit and other Arctic peoples had mixed opinions about polar bears. On one hand, they are the biggest living terrestrial carnivore, so they were obviously feared. On the other, their mythologies usually held the polar bear with a lot of respect, as a sacred shamanic symbol.
-   Davy Crockett. King of the wild frontier. Killed a bear when he was only three.
-   Native American Mythology:
    -   Averted by many legends. Amongst the Navajo, for example, the bear is a symbol of healing, peace, and tranquility and harming one brings **very bad** luck. Then again, if you try to provoke a bear you're probably going to get everything you deserve.
    -   Played straight by others. The "Just So" Story of Devil's Tower in Wyoming involves one or more gigantic bears trying to kill frightened children and the Creator raising the tower up under the kids to save them.
    -   There's a **very important difference** between black bears and grizzly bears. Black bears are generally regarded as the positive aspects of the bear, being peaceable and shy. Grizzly bears are almost literally called **Ax-Crazy** in some legends.
    -   There is an old Inuit story of a woman who went to live among strange people. She became a burden, and so they placed her in a boat, took her out to sea and cast her overboard. She struggled to regain the side of the boat, but they cut off her fingers to keep her away. As she died in the water, she became Sedna, the goddess of the sea and mother of all beasts. Her fingers became the walrus and seals and whales that the people would hunt to eat. But her middle finger became the white bear. When the other animals see a man, they try to run away. But when the white bear sees a man, he is filled with revenge and tries to kill the person who he believes murdered the woman from whose finger he was born. Wise Inuit stay away from the white bear...
        -   ...so, when you see a polar bear, it's the Goddess giving you the finger. Makes sense.
-   Japanese Mythology: The **Oniguma** (devilbear): strong enough to carry away horses and quick enough to smash monkeys with one blow. Also, it was said that killing bears would cause the "Bear Wrath", a really nasty event.
-   Classical Mythology: Averted in the Greek myth of Atalanta, who, after being left to die as a baby, was raised by a she-bear, and became a badass Action Girl.
-   One possible etymology of King Arthur's name is a derivation from \***artos**, which means bear, and he sure was bad news for the Saxons.

Bears Are Bad News Example in Professional Wrestling

-   Back in the territorial era, there was a gimmick of the wrestling bear. While the "matches" would generally involve the bear's trainer, at times, it was used as a threat against a heel manager. The most famous were Victor, who worked with heel manager "Playboy" Gary Hart in Texas, and Terrible Ted, who worked in Maple Leaf Wrestling in Toronto, the World Wide Wrestling Federation, Dick the Bruiser's World Wrestling Association in Indianapolis, and other promotions until he retired in 1974. There is a match, such as it was, between Terrible Ted and Gene DuBois on **Volume 4: No More Mr. Nice Guy** of the **Wrestling Gold** DVD series hosted by Jim Cornette and Dave Meltzer. But it goes back to at least the 1930s with a wrestling bear named Ginger.
-   Terrible Ted was the trope namer for Bear Hug, as he had been declawed and lost all of his teeth during his carnival days prior to his pro wrestling debut, so "hugging" was his most effective form of offense. The less famous Smokey, whom Ted was partnered with when he joined the pro wrestling business, was much more dangerous and eventually was taken by the humane society after mauling someone to death. On the not-so-bad news side, a young Bret Hart would let Ted lick melted ice cream off of his feet when it was living under the Hart porch.
-   Bearcat Wright Jr., who wrestled through the territories in the 1950s through '70s, and his successor of sorts, Bearcat Brown through the '60s through '80s.
-   Willie Williams (a kickboxer who did some MMA and Pro Wrestling) actually did fight a bear, instead of its trainer, which earned him the nickname "Bear Killer".
-   Ivan Koloff, the man who ended Bruno Sammartino's EIGHT-YEAR reign as WWE (then WWWF) World Heavyweight Champion, was known as "The Russian Bear".
-   The Bear Hug has been used as a submission hold by everyone from evil Russian Nikolai Volkoff to "The World's Strongest Man" Mark Henry. It was innovated by George Hackenschmidt, whose Red Baron, ironically, was "The Russian Lion".
-   Sylvester Terkay, better known for his work in Japan, had a run in WWE where he used the Red Baron "The Man-Bear."
-   Big Show uses a bear as his logo.
-   Bear Fukuda, the resident street fighter of Next Door Project "El Dorado", which went on to become "Secret Base".
-   1970s British wrestler John Elijah was known as "Bearman". Only of ordinary size for a heavyweight (~210 pounds), he once nearly lifted Shirley Crabtree ("Big Daddy") over the top rope, inducing his 350-pound opponent to signal for a round of applause from the crowd.

Bears Are Bad News Example in Puppet Shows

-   **The Muppet Show**: In one skit, the Swedish Chef is cooking at a campsite, and is annoyed by a group of squirrels. Eventually, he gets angry and chases them offstage with a cleaver. A few seconds later, a bear—who has the cleaver—chases **him** back onstage and offstage in the other direction, with the squirrels laughing their heads off.

Bears Are Bad News Example in Roleplay

-   Cerberus Daily News has Brizzly, a sapient, biotic grizzly.
-   **Survival of the Fittest**: There is a common joke among handlers that inactive characters are killed and eaten by an "Inactivity Bear". Also, in her first post, version 4 character Maria Graham has a dream where she was actually "Robo-Bear 5000", which was a robotic bear disguised as a student and was going to avenge its kidnapping.

Bears Are Bad News Example in Sports

-   Several sports teams such as the Memphis (originally Vancouver) Grizzlies (basketball), the Chicago Cubs (baseball), the Chicago Bears (football), and the Boston Bruins (hockey).
    -   In Australian Rules Football, the Brisbane Bears failed at this, by having a koala as their mascot. Koalas are not bears.

Bears Are Bad News Example in Stand-Up and Recorded Comedy

-   Comedian Mitch Hedberg had a joke where he and a friend decided to go out to the woods to do drugs in order to avoid authority figures only to run into a bear, which was "even more of a buzzkill". The friend attempted to appease the bear by promising to prevent forest fires. Smokey is **way** more intense in person.

-   Siegfried sets one loose on Mime in **The Ring of the Nibelung**.
-   In **Ubu Roi** Pile, Cotice and Père Ubu are attacked by a bear in the forest. Pile and Cotice barely manage to kill it, while Ubu hides and prays, coming out after the bear is killed and claiming they'd never survive the encounter without his prayer.
-   William Shakespeare's **The Winter's Tale**. "Exit, Pursued by a Bear." The bear pursuing Antigonus off the stage does in fact make everything worse (especially for Antigonus).

-   **Gaming All-Stars: The Ultimate Crossover**: The Bearminator, a submarine-piloting polar bear who can summon smaller robotic bears to assault his targets, interrupts Link and his gang from proceeding any further not long after escaping from the G-Man's clutches, prompting them to evade his gunfire as they work to take care of him.

-   **RWBY**: The Ursa are bear-like Grimm, and they serve as Elite Mooks. Ursa Major are even bigger, stronger versions, and they're downright terrifying opponents. Of course, from their perspective, the trope is more "Badass Teenagers With Mix And Match Weapons Are Bad News".
-   **Unforgotten Realms**: In episode 12, Roamin the Paladin rides to the scene of a big battle on the back of, not just a bear, but Ursa Arkadios, Archduke of the High Bears! Oh, and they're loaded with every sword in the rulebook.

Bears Are Bad News Example in Websites

-   **CHEEZburger**:
-   **CollegeHumor**:
-   The nightmare "Unspeakable Things" on the **Nightmare Project** has the dreamer pursued by a metal-skinned bear through a Lethal Lava Land.
-   When tasked with pondering how the ongoing, deadly civil war in Syria could possibly get any worse, **The Onion** came to one logical conclusion: Bears.
-   The SCP Foundation maintains a few "ursine"-tagged subjects, nicely compiled into the Bearitage Collection:
    -   SCP-549, which moves and behaves like a normal grizzly despite being 17 centimetres long. As in, it's still as heavy, strong, and hungry as a regular bear.
    -   SCP-1048, a sapient teddy bear that can use any material to make hostile creations in its image.
    -   "Bugsy", a grizzly that gets bigger and more aggressive the more people know about it.
    -   Another teddy bear, SCP-1145 isn't actively malicious... it just so happens to now be a Nuclear Mutant after getting utterly irradiated by the bombing of Nagasaki.
    -   SCP-1313, a mathematical equation whose solution is a live grizzly bear. Foundation mathematicians are thus investigating the implications of bears existing in the set of real numbers.
    -   SCP-2875, aka The Town that got Fucked By Bears. It's a town in Wisconsin that, every three days, randomly spawns anywhere between 50-100 grizzly bears. Bears that have to be tranquilized and beaten to death, because if you shoot one two more take its place.
-   **Serina**: The largest of the bumblebadgers, a clade of quadrupedal birds adapted for life as generalist meat-leaning omnivores, are called bumblebears, and are dangerous and bad-tempered ground predators adapted for purely carnivorous lifestyles.
    -   A relatively small species, the bramblebreaker, is described as "an animal nobody wants to meet". They're highly muscular, dangerous predators and extremely foul-tempered even by bumblebear standards, but provide a useful service for other animals through their ability to open paths through the dense cactaiga by simply chewing their way through the dense growths of spiny plants.
    -   The truculent bumblebear, at eight feet in height and nine hundred pounds in weight, is one of the largest bumblebear species and the apex predator of its era. They're extremely powerful and dangerous predators, equally happy killing and eating literally any creature they encounter as they are chasing off other predators from their kills. They have no natural enemies, and their most common cause of death is being killed by a conspecific in a conflict over territory.
    -   During the height of the Ocean Age glaciation, the truculent bumblebear evolves into the dire bumblebear, the largest bumblebear to ever live and a fearsome, powerful, and highly aggressive predator. Dire bumblebears are adapted for killing thorngrazers, the only remaining land herbivores to exist in large numbers during this period. As thorngrazers are themselves aggressive and powerful beasts who live in large herds and in one species' case are covered in spines, dire bumblebears get their food by being even stronger, tougher and more ferocious than their prey — although they will also happily chase other predators from their kills, as nothing alive will willingly fight one of these beasts. The tundra's sapient natives, the woolly wumpos, fear these beasts immensely.

-   **Afterlife SMP**: Junior, Joey's pet panda, is of the aggressive variant in Minecraft and will attack continuously if provoked. This has caused two deaths on the server, thus having a higher Kill Tally than about half of the player population.
-   In a roundabout sort of way, when the **Game Grumps** play **Naughty Bear**, their first part got decidedly low ratings due to their inability to complete **the very first task of the game, **even though the game itself was guiding them**.**
-   This is a running joke in the online web series **LoadingReadyRun** where Kathleen, one of the people in comedy group, has what she describes as a "completely rational fear" of bears.
-   **Pirates SMP**: Grizzly bears are part of the mod-pack and have been known targets of "A Terrible Beast" quests because they have a tendency to crash random people's picnics. Even if they are tamed as mounts, they are still hostile to anyone outside of the tamer's faction and will attack them on sight if they get too close.
-   Joel Heyman from **Rooster Teeth** picked the wrong Fluffy to tame.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
-   **TierZoo**: Zigzagged when the series looks into extant and extinct bears and their position in the metagame of **Outside**.
    -   Played straight by powerful generalist bears like brown bears, kodiaks, and black bears. Their versatility, intelligence and ability to hibernate to conserve resources through winter make them premier S-tier predators.
    -   Exaggerated by the cave bears from "The Ice Age Tier List", which was even bigger and stronger than modern bears — while black bears are S-tier on versatility and intelligence, the cave bears made S-tier on the back of its overwhelming power, defense, and hitpoints, plus its ability to switch between hunting and scavenging when need be. Datamining suggests that unlike other large Ice Age builds, their decline was not a result of the in-universe Game-Breaker, Humans, arriving on the scene. Note that the "cave bear" in "The Ice Age Tier List" is actually a combination of both its real-life counterpart and another giant bear species — the short-faced bear — combining the former's herbivory with the latter's scavenging and fighting prowess.
    -   Subverted by most specialized bears, with only the very strong polar bear making it outside of the very low tiers. Even then, it's hampered by lacking the useful Hibernate ability and having to contend with the unforgiving Arctic server, including months-long Arctic nights. In the lowest tier is the panda, which has specialized extremely heavily into eating bamboo, even though it provides them almost no energy or XP.
-   Whateley Universe: the Mediwhila Native American tribe just off the grounds of Whateley Academy are Weres. But the leader's boyfriend is a Werebear. Do not mess with this guy.
-   **What the Fuck Is Wrong with You?**: Nash finds it hard to believe just how many stories he's had that involve people trying to take on bears in some way, calling bears "living furry tanks" and at least once uttering the Trope name itself (which left him open to Tara following it up with "Especially when they play baseball."). Some of the more infamous examples:
    -   One story about a man who wanted to find a bear, kill a bear, wear the bear's skin, and then maul his ex-girlfriend to death to make it look like some sort of freak bear attack. Nash was quick to point out the flaws in this plan.
        
        **Nash:** Number one, it's a bear. Number two, it's a bear. Number three, and probably most important... HOLY SHIT, YOU FUCKING IDIOT! IT'S A GODDAMNED BEAR!
        
    -   They also had another story where a man and his girlfriend were camping and a bear started to go into their tent while they were sleeping. The man managed to punch the bear in the face and drove it off. Both Nash and Tara agreed that punching a bear in the face to save your girlfriend is better than a marriage proposal. Tara was also concerned about her then-boyfriend finding out about the story as he wants to punch a bear and now has proof you can survive doing it.
    -   Another one about a man donning a realistic bear costume and harassing a family of bears, going so far as to get near the cubs, leaving Nash to have to explain why the Mama Bear trope exists: "You get next to Mama Bear's cubs, that is **death**!"
-   Violated by Bears Man's origin.

Bears Are Bad News Example in Real Life

-   The Nazis probably felt this way about Voytek. A bear... that drinks, smokes, fights, and carries ammo. However, in his personal life Voytek was known as a kind and lovable fuzzball, who loved sweets, baths, and hanging out with his buddies. A case where he brought this upon someone: one day when Voytek went to the steam baths, he found an enemy spy hiding in them. He roared and backhanded the spy, who promptly surrendered, presumably not having expected a bear to blow his cover. What's amazing is that throughout his military career, he caught spies that sneaked into his base, not once but twice. Voytek was rewarded with cool bath and bottles of beer. So he was punching Nazis before Harrison Ford made it cool.
-   Try to read all the way through this page without getting the chills. Some standout incidents include:
    -   The woman who climbed onto her roof when the bear broke into her cabin. It **followed her onto the roof** and killed her. Nowhere is safe...
    -   The one where a bear broke the necks of two campers, dragged them off, and ate part of them. When police found the bear five days later... it was **guarding and protecting their corpses**. The disturbing implication that the bear had come to enjoy the taste of human flesh, to the point where it jealously guarded the corpses, makes this one even creepier.
    -   The bear who apparently ripped the door off of a trailer to get to the man inside.
    -   The bear who dragged a five-month-old **off of the porch of her house** and killed her.
    -   The one where the only information they give us is that "his/her partially consumed remains were found." Especially scary is the guy whose half-eaten body was found **in a campground** when people woke up the next morning, or the one where "days later, searchers found his campsite with his bare skeleton, one intact hand, and both feet, still booted."
    -   And then there's the guy who managed to drag himself 1.5 miles to a meadow to die after being mauled and partially eaten.
-   What's scarier than a bear? **A rabid bear.** One managed to smash through a house once and savaged everything in it until it was shot to death by the owner. The bear even **head-on** charged his jeep! If Cujo was bad, this is **much** worse.
-   There's a **reason** the expression "loaded for bear" means "carrying the biggest gun you can get your hands on." In the muzzle-loading days, it meant cramming in extra powder. It takes quite a lot to put a bear down, and there's a lot of Taking You with Me potential if you don't get it right. A party of Eastern European hunters once cornered a large male brown bear— after they shot it twice with a 9.3x74mm double rifle, the bruin did not show the least desire to die, but charged them furiously, prompting the leader to perform the quickest reload of both barrels in his lifetime and shoot again, only to see that it did not even stop the furious bear, let alone kill it. The entire party ran away like madmen, and when they could scrounge enough guts to go back, they found the bear dead: all four expanding rounds had hit, one of them almost cut down a hind leg, yet the bear survived long enough to charge them.
-   As depicted in **Grizzly Man**, Timothy Treadwell had been hanging around bears for thirteen years and filming them until two finally ate him and his girlfriend. Before that, he apparently had such a way that he could get close to cubs without hitting the momma's Berserk Button. It was described as being a particularly harsh fall, with a salmon run that was far below average and bears that were hungrier and more aggressive than usual. Guess it doesn't matter how much of a strong connection you have to nature when there's a food shortage... it didn't help that he had stayed longer than planned, and the bears that did know him weren't the ones in the area any more.
-   A Russian circus manager was killed by an ice skating bear.
-   A group of armed militants in Kashmir stopped to have some pudding in a cave hideaway... shared by a bear. The bear killed two and severely injured a third. The cave was shared, not the pudding. This may be why the bear attacked.
-   The Lewis and Clark expedition experienced grizzly bears for the first time when they were exploring the west. "Experienced" here meaning "coming across a creature so incredibly strong, they were unable to kill it with all of their guns and had to hide up trees until it left." Climbing a tree is not a foolproof solution to bears. Bears, even grizzlies, have been known to climb trees, too. Standing on the ground, a big bear can reach as much as 10 feet into a tree.
    
    **Lewis:** **(in his journal)** I find that the curiossity of our party is pretty well satisfyed with rispect to this anamal.
    
-   In 2006, a brown bear nicknamed "Bruno" by the press became something of a **cause célèbre** when it wandered into southern Germany from Austria, making him the first wild bear to be seen in Germany since 1838. Bruno was extremely large and aggressive, showing a particular fondness for killing (but not eating) domestic animals. The fumbling attempts of the Bavarian government to deal with him (particularly Minister-President Edmund Stoiber's description of him as a "**Problembär**" ("problem bear")) attracted a great amount of derision. Bruno was finally shot to death by government marksmen.
-   And now they're joyriding in your car.
-   There was a drug bust of a Marijuana farm guarded by 10 black bears. However, they were so docile and domesticated that all that happened was that one of them sat on a cop car's hood for an hour, and then they just watched everything.
    -   If this is the same story, the whole thing was just too ridiculous for one Russian news reader.
-   As if World War III wouldn't be bad enough, it was almost started by a bear. More precisely, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, a black bear tripped an intruder alarm at a US Air Force installation in Duluth, Minnesota, putting the entire base on full alert and nearly starting World War III.
-   The Svalbard Ski Marathon: probably the only annual sporting event where the entire track has to be surveilled by armed guards to stop polar bears from eating the competitors.
    -   It's not just the marathon. In Svalbard, you are required to carry a rifle while outside a settlement for self-defense against polar bears.
    -   Why a rifle? Because shooting a polar bear in the face with a handgun won't make it stop.
-   The Sloth bear of Mysore, which plagued the Mysore province in India in 1957. The Sankebetsu Brown Bear incident, seen above, is scary, but while that killed seven people, and wounded two others, the sloth bear of Mysore killed 12 people, and mutilated a dozen others, making it the single bear responsible for most human fatalities ever. To make matters scarier? No one really knows why the bear attacked, it only ate three of its victims, so this cannot have been the primary motivation, implication that it was a "thrill killer", remains. And to make matters even worse, sloth bears attacks by clawing the face of their victims with their long claws, perfectly adapted for destroying termite mounds. Yep, that's right, most of those that died had their face torn apart, and most of those who survived live with such a face for the rest of their life. Eventually, after three hunts, Great White Hunter Kenneth Anderson shot it dead.
-   Les Stroud, aka the **Survivorman**, gets dropped into environments all over the world armed with nothing bigger than a small knife and spends the week by himself demonstrating how to survive in that situation, and has made a point of usually not having a firearm with him despite being in environments with the potential for hostile wildlife (plus, hunting for food would be easier). The exception was when he filmed an episode on Baffin Island, and authorities **required** him to carry a rifle, specifically because of the danger of polar bears.
-   The Sankebetsu brown bear incident, which took place in Hokaido, in late 1915. It resulted in the deaths of seven people (one of whom was pregnant) over the course of five days, and wrecked multiple houses. It's believed that the cause for the attack was the bear (who went on to be named "Kesagake", which means "the diagonal slash from the shoulder") awoke early from hibernation, leading him to become more ravenous and aggressive.
-   What's worse than a single bear mauling you? **A pack of bears!** Four bears mauled a female wolf to death in a Dutch Zoo while the other wolves trying to save her...
-   Bears were also bad news for Neanderthals, with a 2016 study finding that 45 out of 124 sampled Neanderthal skeletons had been victims of a bear attack.
-   Even their **skeletons** ain't immune to this trope, as they look frightening and even near-demonic.
-   Among truckers in The '70s, "bear" was CB radio slang for a highway patroller, whose hats resembled that worn by Smokey Bear in public service announcements. Hence the title of **Smokey and the Bandit**.
-   In 2004, the city government of the small town of Grafton, New Hampshire was taken over by libertarians who stopped enforcement of many regulations — including rules prohibiting leaving out food and waste that might attract bears. Several town residents started deliberately feeding the local bears; which attracted them to everyone's homes. When they couldn't eat garbage; they would go after backyard chickens and outdoor pets or try to get into the houses. Many residents eventually moved out of town. Documented in "A Libertarian Walks Into A Bear".
-   Bears were so feared in Medieval Europe that a special type of spear was developed to hunt them; its salient feature was a stout crossbar behind the head, meant to prevent the speared bear from pushing itself down the shaft to attack the wielder. (A similar but smaller type of spear was used to hunt wild boars, for much the same reason.)
-   A more metaphorical sort of bear: the berserkers (literally "bear-shirts") of Norse mytho-history were said to fight with the ferocity of angry bears, or even transform **into** bears during battle in the more fanciful tellings. In reality, they were probably "just" the most hardened and experienced warriors in an army, who wore bear-skin cloaks or tunics as a badge of rank, and who psyched themselves up and intimidated the enemy before battle by roaring and chewing their shields like bears. (Bonus: given that the body types favored by Norse warriors tended towards Stout Strength, using their own bodies as barricades and battering rams in shield-wall warfare, many berserkers were likely The Bear as well.)
