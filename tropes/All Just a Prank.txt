All Just a Prank: 
**Louise:** I don't understand. How did you do all this? And how did I _fall_ for it?  
**Linda:** It was a lot of work. So many _e-mails_.

The "just a dream" trope has become so worn out that writers actively avoid it now. So how else can a main character be momentarily uncomfortable or threatened? Rather than conflict within the self, the conflict could be construed by a master-mind or a team of rascals: An event so elaborate that the person experiencing it will _wish_ it was a dream.

The All Just a Prank trope is when a key plot in a story turns out to be a prank. This could be a prank in the comedic sense, but could also be something more sinister, where the victim/victims loses more than they gain. The trope not only fools the main character, but the _viewer_. Typically there are little to no signs that it's a prank, so viewers are left in the dark about their legitimacy. This can be compared with dream sequences that resemble reality and surprise viewers when they're revealed to be false. A sister trope of this is the Friendly Scheming trope, which applies to pranks that have positive results and brings people together.

Furthermore, the aforementioned dream trope and the current trope in discussion both rely on the suspension of disbelief. When a prank becomes too complicated, convoluted and expensive to be feasible, the viewer might assume it _is_ a dream sequence. If there has been no indication of it being a prank, then the big reveal could be interchanged with someone waking up, and it usually has no major bearing on the plot. But as discussed, the "just a dream" trope is known to frustrate audiences and cause them to disengage with the text or criticise it.

The pranks depicted are often so complicated that only someone with an obsessive personality could create something so impossible. Several Plot Holes may arise following the reveal. Even if the prank is explained, it can sometimes raise more questions than it answers. It's also difficult to conceive of a plot being a prank if everything went as planned. With pranks that risk people's lives or sanity, it verges into Gambit Roulette, as anything could happen. Characters who are victim to the prank may lose their sanity or hold a grudge against the jokers.

Occasionally, the prankers will get A Taste of Their Own Medicine; the joke becomes ''real'' or gets out of control. The jokers then have to apologise for the prank _and_ the real-life consequences. This may lead to someone pulling a prank on _them_ for revenge.

If the prank occurs over multiple episodes, then the big reveal may have an underwhelming impact. It may even be a tool for the writers to discontinue a plot without abandoning it too suddenly or confusing the viewers.

Compare Prank Gone Too Far, All Just a Dream, Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane, Nightmare Sequence, Overly Pre-Prepared Gag, Gainax Ending, Shock-and-Switch Ending, and And You Thought It Was Real. Can lead to a Surprisingly Happy Ending (although this is not a guarantee). Can overlap with The Con, when engineered situations and several people are used in an elaborated con.

Note that is a spoiler trope, so beware! You Have Been Warned!

-   **April Fools' Day**. Muffy St. John invites eight of her friends to her island for April Fools Day, and one by one the guests are murdered and disappear. A standard Slasher Movie? Not quite, as no one is killed: it's all just a way for Muffy to test her "murder mystery weekend" plan on her unsuspecting guests.
-   **The Game (1997)**: A man signs up for a mysterious service involving what he believes to be a game of entertainment. He begins to receive unsettling threats, and is soon on the run from the law as he endures various acts of violence, confusion and paranoia. In a stand off at the end, he accidentally shoots his brother and watches him die. Ashamed and horrified, he jumps through a glass ceiling and lands on an airbag, surrounded by party goers. The horrors he went through for the "game" were in fact all part of it, even his brother's death.

-   **Penn & Teller Get Killed**: The biggest twist to the film is that the whole plot (a violent Loony Fan of Penn and Teller swears to kill them, culminating with him kidnapping Teller) is a prank Penn has planned to top, once and for all, the Escalating War that he has been playing with Teller for years. The revelation comes way too late because, unknown to Penn, Teller purchased a sub-nosed revolver for self-defense which he uses to shoot Penn dead just as he barges into the "stalker"'s room yelling "surprise!" The grief of Teller and all of Penn's fellow prank conspirators is so big that they all commit suicide... and so does every single person that enters the room afterwards.

Just after Sam finally accepts that Gary died for real, it's revealed that it actually was just a prank and Gary is still alive.
    -   It's reported that Gary's Old Town Tavern has been bought out. The gang tries to restart their prank war with the new owners, only for them to retaliate quite destructively. A police officer who comes to them reveals that the new owners are in the mob and the police are essentially afraid of them.

    -   In "Bang the Drum, Stanley," Sophia gets conked on the head by an errant pop fly at a baseball game. Dorothy's ex-husband Stan convinces her to help him file a Frivolous Lawsuit against the team and ballpark. Sophia pretends that she's been paralyzed, although Dorothy knows she's faking. When it comes to receive a physical to prove her paralysis, Sophia, Dorothy, and Stan end up in a hospital waiting room full of people in wheelchairs, on crutches, and generally unable to move. When a particularly small boy enters, Sophia is overcome with guilt and announces that she's been lying...at which point all of the "injured" people reveal that they were faking too. It turns out that they're an acting troupe that Dorothy spoke to for help, which is hinted at by the B-plot of Rose and Blanche appearing in a local musical.
    -   In "'Til Death Do We Volley," Dorothy's best friend from high school, Trudy, comes to visit Miami. The women were Vitriolic Best Buds as teenagers and loved to play pranks on each other, and it's clear that some of that competitiveness is still apparent. When they head to the tennis court to play a game, Trudy has a heart attack and collapses, apparently dead. Dorothy is utterly broken up about it and makes a tearful speech admitting what happened at Trudy's wake, running off to her bedroom. Trudy herself then shows up and says it was all a joke, prompting the funeral guests to scold her for being so immature. A chastened Trudy heads to Dorothy's bedroom to apologize—and discovers her husband in bed with her. After Trudy panics, the two pull off the covers to reveal that they're fully clothed: Dorothy realized that Trudy was pulling a trick and decided to get her back with a prank of her own.

    -   In "The Case of the Libertine Belle," the girls attend a murder mystery weekend that Blanche has organized for a work outing. Dorothy proves herself to be quite capable of solving the fake crimes, but things take a turn for the serious when Blanche's boss Kendall ends up stabbed through the heart in her bed—and since the door was locked, suspicion immediately falls on Blanche herself. Dorothy thinks it's another part of the mystery, but when Kendall's breath fails to appear on a mirror, she's convinced. After a tense conclusion and Dorothy identifying the real murderer as Blanche's jealous rival, Kendall himself appears—it turns out The Game Never Stopped, and his apparent death actually **was** part of the experience (the non-fogging mirror is explained as Rose secretly spraying it with defogger, per the staff's request, as retaliation for Blanche borrowing her earrings without telling her.)
    -   Discussed in one episode when the girls are reminiscing about funerals. Blanche reveals that, as a teenager, she was runner-up in a local beauty contest, and decided to make the town pay for "valuing her personality over her looks" by staging her death with the help of a riverboat captain she was dating.

Her father proceeded to violently attack the riverboat captain and send Blanche to an all-girls school for a while.
-   Subverted with the **iCarly** episode "iTwins". Sam's visiting twin sister Melanie was **NOT** a prank pulled by her and Carly, but Freddie jumps to the conclusion it is a prank to test his gullibility.

Eventually, they realise they'll miss the place as well, and decide to reminisce on their times in the loft. They pack a truck full of their things and pull down the shutter, to see Winston's giant face on it. He reveals it was all an elaborate prank, and had been planning it for months. He even went to the effort of registering various fake company names and having someone pose as a receptionist. Nick and Jess decide to leave anyway.
-   **Psych**: In "Tuesday the 17th", Shawn and Gus are hired to find a missing counselor at a camp that was closed after an electrician died gruesomely.

-   **Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later**: The main villain of the plot is Ronald Reagan, played by Michael Showalter.

One of the actors includes the creepy babysitter, who had been terrorising McKinley and Ben a la **The Hand That Rocks the Cradle**. They find the revelation of everyone being an actor especially shocking, because they believed the babysitter was trying to murder them. During a vicious fight scene, they killed her in self-defense then buried her body. Reagan calls out for the babysitter character to come forward and admit her part in the scheme, but she never does. Ben and McKinley, ashamed, tell each other to never acknowledge it again.

When Henry finally starts to believe in ghosts, it is revealed that the whole thing was an elaborate prank that Koffsky, Donald and Elsa (plus Clyde) planned against Henry, partly to get back at him for his old schoolboy prank, and partly because Koffsky and Clyde hopes to make a viral video out of this prank footage.

Later investigation reveals that the perpetrator is Stone's own business partner, Shirley Fletcher, who has had disagreements with the former on how the store should be run, and decided to start a new business elsewhere.

-   **Irisu Syndrome!**: While the title character does kill all her friends in the normal ending. In the ending you get if you score over 20,000 points, it turns out to be this instead, though it's implied she did originally intend to kill everyone but changed her mind.

Having lost both his sisters to a cruel joke played by the main characters, Josh wanted revenge.

Unfortunately, Josh failed to account for the fact that there were **real** monsters up on the mountain. When told that Jessica is actually dead (depending on your decisions, either she is or she's merely presumed dead), Josh is legitimately shocked.

However, when Mung fails to emerge from beneath the pie, Endive checks beneath it and is horrified by what she sees underneath. She panics and forces Panini, as an accomplice, to help her hide the body, but by the time they return, Chowder's discovered the pie and eaten the entire resultant mess. However, he begins to feel queasy, forcing Endive and Panini to kidnap him to prevent him from vomiting up the evidence at an inopportune time. While on the run, Endive becomes increasingly unhinged and Panini abandons her. She eventually decides to hide out abroad at the West Pole and breaks down sobbing on the plane at how her life is ruined. In the midst of her breakdown, she's offered a drink by a flight attendant and when she looks up to snap at her for interrupting, the flight attendant turns out to be Mung, who reveals the Mung crushed under the pie earlier was a fake made of jam and that everyone up to this point, including Panini and the cops who chased Endive, were in on a much larger prank to get back at Endive, with Mung even having the company put into storage to sell the illusion that he was pranked. Relieved, Endive goes to hug Mung only for him to explode in her arms, to her horror, which of course is revealed as ANOTHER prank by the \*real\* real Mung who appears behind her.
