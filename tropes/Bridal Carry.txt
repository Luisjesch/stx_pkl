Bridal Carry: 
_"Can we_ not _tell anyone you just carried me in your arms like a baby?"_

A man carries a woman in his arms — one arm under her legs and the other supporting her back like a groom carrying his bride. It usually denotes or foreshadows a romantic relationship between the characters or a major difference in their physical strength or both. It's also called a "princess carry".

Variations of this trope are common and include:

-   Switching the roles of the carrier and the carry-ee (i.e. the Damsel in Distress carrying The Hero in this fashion).
-   Making the carry-ee just a bit too heavy for the carrier to handle.
-   Having the carry-ee complain about the treatment.
-   Having the carry-ee bang their head against the doorframe when the couple tries this while walking through a door.

When the participants _aren't_ romantically involved, expect fans to cite this as "proof" that they really are.

If the person being held is injured, dead, or dying, it may cross over into Pietà Plagiarism. Usually, coexists with rescue tropes like Rescue Romance and Embarrassing Rescue. See also Security Cling. Contrast Over-the-Shoulder Carry and Effortless Amazonian Lift; the Touch of the Monster variant Rape of the Sabine Women visually evokes this with a monster or villain carrying an unconscious or struggling victim. In cases where one person is carrying another away from danger, this may overlap with Crisis Catch And Carry.

Not to be confused with Tribal Carry.

-   At the end of chapter 47 of part 2 of **Rosario + Vampire**, Miu Sai-Lung does this to Routier.

However, because Chi is in kindergarten, and thus much smaller than her dad, it ends up looking more like a "baby carry", much to Chi's embarrassment when her parents point it out.
-   **Tiger & Bunny**:
    -   Barnaby has a habit of carrying those he rescues (usually Kotetsu, but others as well) in this fashion. This doesn't go uncommented upon.

    -   Kaneki does this to a deceased Hide in the root A anime.

-   **Buffyverse**:
    -   Angel carries Buffy like this in "Halloween" (after a spell causes Buffy to act like a Damsel in Distress), while Buffy carries her little sister Dawn to escape Glory in "Spiral". Justified as both characters have Super-Strength.
    -   Gender-flipped at the end of "What's My Line, Part 2," when a freshly-healed Drusilla hoists Spike out of a charred pile of rubble, scoops him into her arms, and walks off.
    -   Giles briefly carries a sick Buffy like this in the Season 1 episode "Witch".
    -   Xander carries an injured Anya this way at the end of "The Gift". As he'd proposed marriage to her earlier in the episode, it's likely for Rule of Symbolism as well.
    -   In **Angel**, Wesley does this more times than the titular protagonist. First time in "This Old Gang of Mine" he does it with Fred to get her off the stage when Gunn's murderous gang comes in gun blazing. The second time he does this with Faith in Slow Motion after Angelus drinks from her, also very heartwarming considering Faith tortured him last time she was in L.A (and props to Wesley actor Alexis Denisof who had injured back while filming but carried on anyway). The final time is when Fred is dying and Wesley carries to her deathbed again in Slow Motion in the most tearjerker-part of the series.
    -   Angel carries Cordelia like this in the first episode before jumping off a balcony and later does the same with Fred in "Magic Bullet".
-   Twisted in **Chinese Paladin**: Xiao Yao sweeps his wife Ling'er off her feet and carries her away from danger... after having paralyzed her with a nerve jab to prevent her from taking part in the fighting.
-   When Anna of **Chuck** falls over and is in danger of being trampled during a store evacuation, Morgan runs heroically to her and carries her out of the shop in this manner, to cries of "What are you doing, Morgan? Put me down!" He has no answer when a fellow employee asks why he carried her out when she could have just walked.
-   In **The City Hunter**, Yun Sung carries Na Na up the stairs to her apartment after she's sprained her ankle.
-   In one of the Halloween episodes of **Community**, the each member of the group shares a Halloween story. In Annie's, Vampire!Jeff carries her into a cabin this way. In Troy's, he uses a frame-by-frame duplicate from Annie's story to carry a wounded Abed into a cabin in the same manner.
-   This Stock Pose can be seen several times in **Cranford**; mostly with brides and grooms, but also when a father carries his ill daughter.
-   **The Daily Show** got the armed forces to carry correspondents down office corridors on two occasions, to the tune of "Love lifts us up where we belong": Colbert by a Rear-Admiral, and Sam Bee by a Captain. The latter doubled as a Take That! to the arguments that female soldiers' are physically too weak to be allowed active service.
-   **Daredevil (2015)**. In a flashback to when they were dating, Matt Murdock carries Elektra across the threshold of a Big Fancy House which they've just broken into.
-   **Doctor Who**:
    -   A non-romantic example: the Fourth Doctor carried everyone in his arms since at 6'3" he was almost always bigger than them.
    -   The Tenth Doctor staggers down the hall with an unconscious Martha in "Smith and Jones". Since the crisis was over and he'd lost a litre or two of blood, you wonder why he made the effort.
    -   Rory carries an unconscious Amy this way in "The Girl Who Waited". In this case, they actually are married.
    -   In "Asylum of the Daleks", the Eleventh Doctor carries Amy this way after she faints from an invasion of Dalek nanogenes. Some fans took exception to this, and inverted the image.
    -   Eleven does this to Clara in "The Name of the Doctor" after she falls unconscious from the strain of being split into thousands of echoes and scattered across the Doctor's timeline.
    -   Gender-flipped in "The Doctor Falls", when Cyber!Bill carries the unconscious Twelfth Doctor.
    -   The Thirteenth Doctor is carried by Yasmin Khan (over the threshold of the TARDIS) after she is fatally wounded because of the Master in "The Power of the Doctor".
-   **Fellow Travelers**:
    -   In the fourth episode, when Hawkins Fuller and Timothy Laughlin spend time together before Christmas, the former lifts the latter bridal-style and then carries him to the bed in Hawk's apartment. Although Hawk has never told Tim that he loves him,, this gesture plainly demonstrates his romantic affection for his lover.
    -   In the eighth episode, there's a brief shot of Hawk holding Tim in a bridal carry when they enter Frankie's house to pick up the tuxedo Tim will wear at a fundraising gala. Hawk's action is more practical than romantic this time around because Tim is dying of AIDS and has trouble walking, but it nonetheless displays that he cares immensely for his ex-boyfriend.
-   A common tactic in **Fort Boyard** when looting the treasure at the end: Since the rules forbid carrying gold in your clothes, a way to increase one's carrying capacity is to carry a woman and pile as much gold as possible on her belly before the time expires.
-   **Friday Night Lights** had Tim do this with his newly-paralyzed friend Jason, just so Jason could be out of his wheelchair for a little while. Jason comments that maybe he should just have Tim carry him everywhere from then on.
-   **Friends**:
    -   In the episode "The One With The Chicken Pox" had Ross and Rachel parodying **An Officer and a Gentleman**: Rachel kept having to go back for stuff, so in the end, Ross just dumped her on the couch.
    -   In "The One Where Phoebe Hates PBS", Chandler carries Monica into the hallway when they go to his apartment to have sex. On the way out he accidentally bangs her head against the doorframe but they quickly agree to ignore it.
    -   In the episode "The One After Vegas", Monica and Chandler have decided they aren't ready to get married, but keep seeing "signs" that they should. At one point, Monica's hurt her leg, so Chandler gathers her up and carries her into her apartment before they realize what they're doing.
-   **General Hospital**. Jagger does this with Brenda in two separate love scenes.
-   Chuck carries Blair up the stairs this way in a season four episode of **Gossip Girl**.
-   **Hannibal** carries an unconscious Will this way in season three. Reportedly, this was rather impractical on set as Hugh Dancy is heavier than he looks, but it just looked more cinematic than the fireman lift.
-   Played with in an episode of **Home Improvement** when Jill insists that Tim carry her like this, unaware that he'd pulled a groin muscle earlier. It doesn't end well.
-   "The Duchess and the Devil" from **Horatio Hornblower** has two sailors in this classic position, and it's Played for Drama. Horatio carries his friend Archie Kennedy in his arms when he realized that Archie has been starving himself. He tries to get help for him from Don Massaredo, the commander of the Spanish prison they're in. Conveniently, it's also raining and it looks very dramatic.
-   Marshall carries Lily this way into their new apartment in **How I Met Your Mother**.
-   **Interview with the Vampire (2022)**: In "...After the Phantoms of Your Former Self", a same-sex variation occurs when Lestat de Lioncourt carries an injured Louis de Pointe du Lac bridal-style up the stairs of what is now their home (the townhouse is owned by Lestat, but Louis becomes its second resident after Lestat transforms him into a vampire). The bridal carry obviously symbolizes that they're essentially married, as much as two men can be in 1910.
-   **Jessie**: When Emma and Caleb decide to run away together, Emma asks Caleb to carry her because she is wearing high heels and can't run. Caleb instantly complies.
    
    **Emma**: And I thought our private jet was a fun way to travel!
    
-   Used in the prequel season 6 of **Kaamelott**. Guenièvre insists that Arthur carry her that way after their marriage "because it's romantic." Not just to go through a threshold, mind you, but **as long as possible**. After some long, agonizing minutes, Arthur finally drops her like a sack of potatoes as he gets exhausted and his back gives up.
-   In episode 42 of **Kamen Rider Fourze**, Kamen Rider Meteor carries Tomoko this way after they're released from the Dark Nebula.
-   Amusingly subverted by Colin in **London's Burning** when he and his new bride Sonia are about to enter their honeymoon suite and he performs a Fireman's Carry instead, much to her amusement.
-   **MacGyver**: Used as a distraction in "The Gauntlet". Mac approaches a two-soldier patrol carrying the journalist (who is playing injured or unconscious) he is working with. He tosses her at one of the soldiers, after which the two subdue their respective opponents.
-   Arthur from **Merlin** carries Morgana to the physician's quarters like this after she's hit her head after falling down a flight of stairs.
-   **Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries**: Jack catches a drugged Phryne (just as she collapses, natch) and carries her to safety this way in "King Memses' Curse". **Definitely** a Ship Tease in this case.
-   In **Mock the Week**: Unlikely Letters for an Agony Aunt. "Dear Diedre: Can that giant man lift me up like a baby?" You bet your ass he can!
-   **Monty Python's Flying Circus**
    -   In the "Buying a Bed sketch", a man carries his bride like this across a field, then on the streets of a city through traffic, until they arrive at a large department store.
    -   The "Scotsman on a Horse" sketch ends this way when the Scotsman arrives at a church to interrupt the wedding and carries off the groom.
-   **My Favorite Martian**: The Martian tells Tim to carry him because he's not used to Earth's gravity yet. He does, using this method.
-   **NCIS: Los Angeles:** Played for Laughs at the end of season 8's "Payback," an otherwise serious and dramatic episode in which Kensi is kidnapped by The Mole within NCIS. The kidnapper is seconds away from dismembering her with a chainsaw when Deeks takes him out with a Double Tap. They share a moment of mutual relief, before Deeks insists on carrying her this way out of the building despite her protests that not only is it unnecessary, it's embarassing.
-   **The O.C.**:
    -   Happens in the pilot episode, when Marissa drinks until she is unconscious. Her friends ditch her in front of her house and after they leave, love interest Ryan carries her inside.
    -   Again in the first season episode "The Escape" in which Marissa downs a bottle of sleeping pills with a shot of tequila after finding out that her parents were getting a divorce and her boyfriend Luke cheated on her. She stumbles into an alley and the episode ends with Ryan picking her up.
-   In **Once Upon a Time**, Rumpelstiltskin unwittingly saves Belle in this fashion after she falls off a ladder.
    -   In one episode, Hook carries Emma this way. Justified since she was freezing to death and too weak to walk to a hospital.
-   **Person of Interest**. Subverted in "M.I.A". John Reese is carrying a Victim of the Week out of a building this way, but it means he can't grab a weapon when a gunman appears. Fortunately he's shot by Root in a Big Damn Heroes.
-   **Scrubs**:
    -   An episode from Dr. Kelso's perspective had two parodies of **An Officer and a Gentleman** with Kelso's Asian Babymama gathering **him** up in her arms while "Love Lifts Us Up Where We Belong" plays in Vietnamese.
    -   Inverted again in the last scene of the (intended) series finale which involves JD imagining scenes of what his future will be like, including getting married to Elliot, who bridal carries him.
        -   Earlier when J.D was having a imagination segment he carries Elliot like this but manages to bang her head on every doorway killing her by the time he gets back to Dr. Cox.
-   Clark does this a lot to people in **Smallville**.
    -   Chloe, many times: **Dichotic**, **Rush**, **Arrival**, **Noir**
    -   Lana, many times: **X-Ray**, **Nicodemus**, **Vortex**, **Reckoning**
    -   Victoria in **Shimmer**.
    -   Sasha in **Drone**.
    -   **Supergirl**: Kara saves Lena from her fatal fall and then bears her up to her office in her arms to the delight of shippers everywhere.
    -   Kyla in **Skinwalker**.
-   **Stargate**:
    -   **Stargate Atlantis**:
        -   When Elizabeth Weir unexpectedly collapses, John Sheppard carries her to the infirmary this way. Probably a subtle Ship Tease (the actors said they played to this, while the writers usually deny it).
        -   Ronon also carried Rodney this way after he collapsed in "The Tao of Rodney" — one wonders why, as these two aren't even slashed much in the fandom, and weren't particularly close friends on the show. Perhaps it was just easier to dump Rodney in the Ancient chair from this position than from a more sensible fireman carry. Or it was done for Pietà Plagiarism purposes.
    -   During the **Stargate Universe** episode where the **Destiny** is invaded by the Lucian Alliance, Eli has to carry a wounded Chloe this way. He jokes that this kind of exercise could easily get him to lose some weight and that they should do it more often. There's some subtext here too, in that he is the Romantic Runner-Up who hasn't yet gotten over his crush on her.
-   In the **Starsky & Hutch** episode "Shootout," Hutch carries Starsky to a back office after he's shot.
-   During the final episode of season 1 of **Stranger Things**, Dustin carries Eleven after she passes out, despite Mike being her love interest. It's likely that this was due to Gaten Matarazzo (who plays Dustin) being the strongest out of the three boys, and therefore the only one capable of feasibly carrying an unconscious Millie Bobby Brown. Overlaps with Crisis Catch And Carry.
-   **Teen Wolf** has Derek carry Stiles at one point. This is Played for Laughs...and Ship Tease.
-   In the Korean Drama **Sungkyunkwan Scandal**, when Sun Joon rescues Yoon Hee after she falls into the river.
-   Dean does this to Jo in **Supernatural** after she is attacked by a hellhound.
-   **Voyagers!**: A platonic female-on-male variation occurs in "Voyagers of the Titanic"; Olivia comes to take Jeffrey back to the lab to make things easier once they've recreated the rabies vaccine. She lifts him into her arms to carry him there.
-   **WandaVision**: The first episode begins with a **The Dick Van Dyke Show**\-style scene in which Vision carries Wanda to the entrance of their new home... and drops her outside as he uses his powers to phase through the door. He opens the door, picks her up, and resumes carrying her like nothing happened.
-   A more dramatic version on **Without a Trace**, when an agent becomes determined to rescue a fellow agent — and former lover — from a hostage situation (she's been shot) and carries her out of there like this.
-   **Wives and Daughters**: An utterly tragic use of this trope: Squire Hamley carries his dead son Osborne in his arms. He died outside alone and he wants to bring him home.
-   During **Wonder Woman (1975)**, Lynda Carter performs this lift into carry many times, mostly on heavy-looking men, and does it with ease. here is one of many examples.

-   Cody Rhodes stands behind Summer Rae when she attempts to interfere in a Goldust\\Fandango match, knowing how it will inevitably turn out, and catches her this way so she won't get hurt. She smiles in gratitude until Fandango notices, at which point Rae starts throwing a fit.
-   At the July **Noches de Coliseo** Carlito Colón backed off from Estrellita, who picked a fight with him for pulling down Hijo del Ninja's pants, but then took her up on the offer after Rico Rodriguez and Barbi Hayden had beaten her up, leading Hijo del Ninja to hurriedly carry Estrellita away from Colon in this manner.
-   Chris Nowinski did this with Molly Holly after saving her from being put through a table by Bubba Ray Dudley, as part of their Nature Adores a Virgin storyline.
-   This position is how Kane held The Undertaker's real-life wife Sarah when he got her off Bubba Ray Dudley's shoulders when he was about to power bomb her through a table. Though it is notable that she was being portrayed as an Action Girl and even beat former WCW Diamond Dallas Page in a match during this time.
-   Kane also did this to Lita after their marriage, though due to the context of their marriage Lita isn't exactly happy about it.
-   Antonio Cesaro catches Tyson Kidd's real-life wife Natalya like this after she was standing on the side of the ring and he accidentally knocked her off. He just threw her aside when he saw his partner was being counted for the three count, however.
-   Undertaker does this to Stephanie McMahon after she was attacked on Smackdown.
-   Alexa Bliss was held like this during a segment with Randy Orton and The Fiend (Bray Wyatt) both holding her for an extended amount of time. Seeing both are rather big and Alexa is very tiny it isn't surprising.

Bridal Carry Example in Theatre

-   **King Lear** enters during the final scene, carrying his daughter Cordelia this way... just after it's announced they were just a little too late to prevent her execution. Also an example of Pietà Plagiarism.
-   In **Paint Your Wagon**, Ben, having married Elizabeth, tries to carry her over the threshold, but proves too drunk to pull it off.
-   **The Phantom of the Opera**. The Phantom carries Christine this way after she faints at the end of "The Music Of The Night". Thanks to her white dressing gown, this hints at his deepest desire and actually foreshadows the play's climax, where he dresses her in a wedding gown and tries to force her to marry him.
-   **Bullshot Crummond** opens with a plane crash, whereupon the villainous Otto von Bruno staggers onto the stage holding Fraulein Lenya, whom he promptly dumps on the ground.

-   **Sera Myu** In the Nogizaka48 adaptation of the Dark Kingdom arc, Kunzite (like in the manga and animes) sweeps up an unconscious/dead Tuxedo Mask and abducts him.

---
Bridal Carry Example in Video Games

-   **Assassin's Creed**. In the second game, Ezio has to carry Rosa to safety after she finally collapses from an arrow wound to her leg. After running and fighting with an arrow sticking out of her leg for quite a distance, mind you.
-   **Castlevania: Rondo of Blood**: Richer carries Maria like this after rescuing her, subverted from a romantic angle as Maria is not Richer’s love interest but rather a little sister figure.
-   In **Dead or Alive**, Gen Fu can perform this action momentarily to any<small>◊</small> girl<small>◊</small> character. Bonus goes to Marie Rose who is easiest set up on due to her small frame and Momiji who gets her own bridal carry in Ninja Gaiden.
-   **Devil May Cry**:
-   In **Dragon Age: Inquisition**, if Dorian and the Iron Bull are still together at the end of the **Trespasser** DLC, one of the epilogue slides shows Bull carrying Dorian this way after having rescued him from would-be assassins.
-   In the first **Dragon Quest**, after rescuing the princess, the hero carries her back home in this fashion. The whole way back.
-   **Final Fantasy**:
    -   Infamously done in **Final Fantasy VII**, when Cloud leaves Aeris in the Lifestream for a sort-of Burial at Sea.
    -   Less tragically done in the Nibelhiem Flash Back (both versions) when Cloud carries the wounded Tifa in this fashion to safety after getting the jump on Sephiroth.
    -   At one point in **Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus**, Vincent saves Yuffie from Nero's attack and takes her to a safe place by carrying her in this way.
    -   **Final Fantasy VII Remake**: Cloud carries Jessie inside this way when she injures her leg. Later, when Aerith falls off a building, Cloud catches her and holds her this way for a few seconds before putting her down.
-   **Fire Emblem**:
    -   In **Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade**, Eliwood carries Ninian this way in Chapter 7, after saving her from the Black Fang. In addition, if they reach A support, the ending will include a CG image which has him carry her in this way as well.
    -   A platonic example is the Masked Knight aka Prince Conrad catching his younger sister Anthiese Celica this way in **Fire Emblem Gaiden**.
    -   In **Fire Emblem: Three Houses**, Raphael Kirsten picks up the female Avatar this way in the CG accompanying their S support.
-   In **The Force Unleashed**, Starkiller carries Juno out of **The Empirical** this way.
-   In **Halo: Reach** when Kat is shot by an Elite sniper, Carter holds her lifeless body in this fashion while waiting for support to arrive. Very tragic and kinda impressive on the Carter's part since while's Kat armor may be form fitting it still weighs over a few tons.
-   **Hi-Fi RUSH** has an example that’s played more for side splitting laughs rather than romance. Idiot Hero Chai carries the defeated Korsica out of her base this way, but rather than being gentle Chai not only slams her face into the ID scanner to open a door but proceeds to accidentally bang Korsica’s head on **every** door frame as he escaping. He actually tries to be careful with her on the third one but the door closes on Korsica’s head as he tiptoes out.
-   In **Kingdom Hearts**, Riku carries Kairi during Neverland, as she has become an Empty Shell having lost her heart.
-   In **The King of Fighters**, Kensou carries an unconscious Athena in his arms in KOF'99. He does the same for Bao in KOF 2000.
-   **The Last of Us**: Papa Wolf Joel carries his daughter Sarah like this after the car crashes during the infection breakout, symbolically mirrored at the end of the game when Joel carries Ellie like this when escaping the Fireflies.
-   During **Mass Effect 3**, while you're on Mars, Ashley/Kaidan have a run-in with a Cerberus mech, which results in having their head slammed against a burning shuttle. After Shepard kills the mech, Male!Shep carries a previously romanced Ashley this way. Fem!Shep, however, hoists Kaidan in a fireman's carry<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>. If neither was romanced in **ME1**, then this trope is averted.
-   In **Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain** after Quiet risks her life jumping into a toxic part of Mother Base to retrieve Shabani’s necklace, Venom Snake helps pull her out and then he scoops Quiet into his arms and carries her away in this fashion. It serves as a Ship Tease and confirmation that Venom truly cares about her.
-   **Musashi Samurai Legend** has the titular hero do this with some of the damsels. While carrying them, however, he is restricted to two attacks: **throwing said damsel into the air,** performing a 360-degree slash, then catching them before they hit the ground, or smacking her into the enemy! Hilariously, it's possible to **miss** the catch, meaning you may spend some time actively dropping the damsel while trying to fight off your pursuers.
-   In **MWULTRA** the player character Ian carries his bandmate Jo in this manner if they are embarking on the final mission together. Ian can be drunk at any point during the game, this included, in which case movement will be both slowed down and delayed.
-   Gender inverted on the cover of **NieR: Automata** 2B holds 9S in this fashion.
-   **Persona**:
    -   In **Persona 4: Arena**, Aigis picks up Kanji after defeating him in her storyline, much to his embarrassment. Her being much shorter than him doesn't help.
    -   In **Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth**, the faked portrait at the end of the Group Date Cafe scene depicts the protagonist and their "destined partner" as this, with the protagonist as the carrier (unless if their partner is one of the **Persona 3** boys, Theo, Zen, **Koromaru**, or Aigis if playing as the P3 protagonist). If their destined partner is a girl, the protagonist has the option to actually pick them up like so—except if their partner is Aigis, who proclaims to be too heavy and picks the protagonist up instead.
    -   In **Persona 5**, Ann (as Panther) lands in Yusuke's arms in this manner when they landed at Madarame's Palace, at least before Morgana landed on Yusuke's head.
-   In **Pokémon Sun and Moon**, one of the many available Ride Pokémon is a Machamp, which uses its upper arms to push heavy boulders and its lower arms to carry the player character like this.
-   **Resident Evil**:
-   In **Shin Megami Tensei IMAGINE**, Cu Chulainn's mount animation consists of him carrying the player in this manner while looking into their eyes... regardless of gender.
-   **Silent Hill 2** has a heart crushingly tragic version where after making peace with his wife Mary for killing her out of mercy when she was sick and in pain James slowly picks Mary up and carries her away<small>◊</small> making an image iconic enough to make one of the covers and the trailer.
    -   The mood-breaker comes from Guy Cihi who claimed the Motion capturing on that scene was difficult since Mary's actor Monica Taylor Horgan was heavier than she looked.
-   In **Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)**, two whole levels are devoted to Sonic running and carrying the (human) Damsel in Distress in this way.
-   One reason why Taki is among the many people shipped with Sophitia in the **Soul Series**. The first Soulcalibur game for consoles had pictures featuring the events of Soul Edge — one picture features Sophitia being critically injured after shattering one of Cervantes's Soul Edge swords. The enraged Cervantes is about to kill Sophitia, but he's shanked by Taki. Then Taki takes up Sophitia in a bridal carry and takes her to safety as well as removes most of the Soul Edge shards from her body.
-   **Story of Seasons: Trio of Towns** has the male farmer do this to Komari in an early love event for her because she's complaining about her stomach hurting. He picks her up and she complains about it, asking him to please let her down because she can walk. The player can choose to let her down and walk her home or keep carrying her, despite her embarrassment.
-   **Street Fighter**:
-   **Super Mario Bros.**:
    -   After Princess Peach rescues Mario in **Super Princess Peach**, he does one with Peach, ending with him taking out flowers out of his hat while Peach blows some kisses and hearts.
    -   Mario is doing this for Princess Peach when he is rescuing or otherwise escorting her starting with **Super Mario 3D Land**. (If he isn't, then they're Holding Hands instead).
-   While **Super Smash Bros.** doesn't have any direct examples, one of Palutena's throws makes her opponent assume the princess carried position before being launched. When being kidnapped by Boss Galaga all females who are damsels in their own series assume the carried pose<small>◊</small>.
-   In **Tomb Raider (2013)**, Lara carries Sam like this while the latter's wearing a white dress. Needless to say, this does nothing to reduce the Les Yay they've shared throughout.
-   Beat rescues Rhyme in this manner in the opening cinematic of **The World Ends with You**.
-   In **Xenoblade Chronicles 1**, Shulk pulls an unconscious Fiora out of the wreckage of Face Nemesis, then carries her to shore in this manner. Made all the more impressive by the fact that:
    -   In the cutscene just prior to this, he took a Mechon blade to the back, spending the remainder of the scene shaking in obvious pain and limping from various injuries sustained throughout the assault on Galahad Fortress, before diving what appeared to be several kilometers down after a falling Fiora
    -   This is Shulk, nerdy and bookish, weedy little guy, who at the game's start would have had trouble picking up and carrying Fiora at all, let alone after
    -   Fiora's Unwilling Roboticization, which she tells Reyn shortly after this has made her "much heavier than she used to be". The Power of Love indeed.
-   In **Xenoblade Chronicles 2**, after Zeke sliced through the chains that Pyra is strapped on as she was electrocuted in Chapter 6, Rex slid and caught Pyra in his arms in this manner at the last second after she fell.

Bridal Carry Example in Visual Novels

-   **Amnesia: Later**: Shin does this to the heroine in a flashback because she injured her ankle. And the After Story for Ukyo has him carrying her like this out of the burning university, and later while 'kidnapping' her from the wedding café photoshoot.
-   A rather sad example comes from **Crescendo (JP)**, with Ryo Sasaki hurriedly carrying Yuka Otowa to the school infirmary after she suffers a uterus-wrecking miscarriage in-class. Complete with blood dripping down poor Yuka's inner thighs.
-   The first **Galaxy Angel** trilogy has this happening at different points in Ranpha's and Forte's routes. Ranpha has it in the second game, after she and Tact reconcile from a misunderstanding that ends in a breakup, and Forte has it in the third game, when he carries her to the infirmary so she can finally rest instead of overworking herself.
-   In **Heart of the Woods**, one ending has the newly married Morgan and Tara(both women) do this, with the former carrying the latter across the threshold on their wedding day.
-   The protagonist does this to Miren in **Kimihagu**.
-   In **Princess Evangile**, Masaya does this to Konomi to save her from getting hurt after she tries to climb up a cherry tree just before the May festival. In her route in **W Happiness**, he does this two more times to her, the first after she wins the naginata tournament and suffers from exhaustion, and the second after she sprains her ankle during the summer festival.
-   The **Witness: A Bodyguard Romance**'s cover shows the protagonist being carried by her love interest.
-   Bo does it in one scene of **Yo-Jin-Bo**. Muneshige and Mon-Mon give piggyback rides.

Bridal Carry Example in Webcomics

-   In **Ava's Demon**, Gil carries Ava like this.
-   **Cucumber Quest**
    -   In one Q&A, Cucumber makes an offhand remark that if she's the hero, Almond would have to carry him. She obliges.
    -   Commander Caboodle carries off Nautilus after saving her from Rosemaster's execution.
-   **Dangerously Chloe** had the succubus protagonist carry her sort-of-boyfriend during their "daring escape in the air", to his giddy delight. Which covers both "strength" part (it was already established that succubi use The Power of Love in various ways) and "clumsy head-bonking" part.
-   Kou carries Vix like this in **Dream\*Scar**.
-   Walter from **Dubious Company** has an awkward moment with his crew when he is caught doing this with Tiren while shirtless. He was just trying to escape the Quirky Miniboss Squad.
    -   Tiren's Luminescent Blush and Walter folding up his wings didn't help, either.
