Animal Jingoism: 
Everyone, including Tom, seems to forget there was also a dog in the show.

_"Squids squirt ink to create a substitute to escape their predators. It's an oily substance, difficult to dissolve in water, that becomes a sort of mass. On the other hand, octopi use ink as a smoke screen. It is water soluble in order to spread. Like oil and water, even the inks of the two species doesn't mix."_

Sometimes, different species, such as cats and dogs or foxes and rabbits<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , are written so that they have a built-in and unquestioned animosity for no other reason than that they are stereotypically considered to be adversaries. A dog that doesn't chase cats will be considered "weird", even if they were raised together from birth. On the other hand, some cats will almost never chase after mice unless provoked. Those dogs will also chase squirrels.

Tiger Versus Dragon, Snake vs Frog and Dog vs Monkey appear to be more prevalent in Japanese media, since they're often alluded to in anime and manga. Tiger Versus Dragon started off as an allegorical representation of Yin and Yang, Snake vs Frog is based on an Edo Period "Rock-Paper-Scissors" style matchup<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and Dog vs. Monkey is a stereotype that started when farmers used dogs to keep monkeys away from their crops. So, Dog vs Cat, Squirrel, and Monkey.

Real Life is more diverse. In general cats will flee from larger predators and dogs have an instinctual urge to chase whatever flees from them. But there are also cats who bully dogs. There are also plenty of cats and dogs who get along very easily and even like each other. Both will usually eat mice and rats (which also eat mice), although it is not uncommon for them to befriend the latter.

There are also fantastic counterparts in Elves Versus Dwarves, Fur Against Fang, Japanese Beetle Brothers, Tanuki/Kitsune Contrast, and Tiger Versus Dragon. Can overlap with Stock Animal Diet if the relationship is a predatory one. See also Mailman vs. Dog.
