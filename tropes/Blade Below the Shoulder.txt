Blade Below the Shoulder: 
Follow

_"Phenom is on his feet again, a little wobbly but still game. He's got his hands up, blades extended. Either of those things might take my head off like a dandelion."_

It's common knowledge that blades are cool. But they can also be a hassle to carry around everywhere. The scabbard might be uncomfortable, and the sword won't simply stick to your back. On top of that, once you finally decide to unsheathe your weapon, you are no longer able to hold anything else in one or both of your hands (or make rude gestures to your opponent). This problem is intensified if the weapon user intends to dual-wield.

The solution: attach the blade to your arm, leaving your hands free to do whatever else you may be inclined to do with them. These blades are often long, vaguely triangular, and taper to a point. Variants include:

-   **Removable arm blade**: Attaching the blades to your elbow, wrist, or even the back of your hand.
-   **Permanently-attached blade**: Embedding the blades inside your arms, from where they can be deployed and retracted by thought alone (usually employed by robots, cyborgs, and other non-regular human characters).
-   **Blade replaces hand or arm**: Replacing one or both of your hands or even your arms with large swords.

The last type is Awesome, but Impractical, as the blades prevent their wielders from performing mundane tasks when not in combat. They are also especially prone to Fake Arm Disarms, as they can be destroyed without gravely injuring the characters. Crafty opponents can also maneuver the wielder into getting them stuck in a wall or something else; and because the weapon is attached to the wielder entirely, letting it go isn't exactly an option. While these drawbacks mitigate many of the practical benefits of having swords attached to your body as opposed to carried, few will have the guts to question your coolness or badassery.

Wolverine Claws are a specific variant. May overlap with Swiss-Army Appendage. Can be considered a subtrope of Cool Sword. Compare its counterpart Arm Cannon, as well as Power Fist. Not to be confused with Shapeshifter Weapons, which are not limited to simply being blades. See also Hook Hand. Compare Combat Haircomb. Commonly a weapon for a Predator Pastiche and/or Wolverine Wannabe.

The examples below are divided into three categories: one, where a blade attached to the arm is a weapon of choice, but not a permanent body part; two, where the blade is permanently attached to the arm and may or may not be concealable; and three, where the entire arm _is_ a blade.

In the manga, however, she gets a massive sword that replaces her arm entirely. The other arm turns into an equally huge machine gun.
-   Veronica in **Franken Fran** appears to be stuffed with spring-loaded weaponry. Given her Artificial Human nature, she may very well be **literally** full of weapons.
-   **Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann** does this with drills: the Gurren Lagann's usual weapon is a pair of drills coming out from above the wrist so in a sense it's also a Power Fist. Justified in that the Gurren Lagann can spawn drills from any part of it's body.

        -   Seems like this type of weapon is a trademark of Setsuna F. Seiei's Gundams: Exia's GN Sword I and 00 Gundam/Raiser's GN Sword III (equipped for the Final Battle). The original 00 Qan\[T\]'s GN Sword V is a traditional sword instead, but in **SD Gundam G-Generation Cross Rays**, the ELS Qan\[T\] is equipped again with this type of weapon, and is also capable of using the Raiser Sword like the GN Sword III.

In the fourth one, Trinetra, he's seemingly upgraded the blade using a blade inscribed with the Triclops's emblem which allows him to access the dimensional gates of Kun Lun. To really drive the point home, when Amara merges with his arm, he takes the form of a large wrist-mounted sword when Yakumo needs to fight.
-   Jack the Ripper from **Black Clover** has Severing Magic that conjures mana blades on his forearms that he can even launch at enemies. He can change the blades' nature and sharpness to whatever he's trying to cut up, letting him eventually counter any magical defense and cut through anything.
-   In **High School D×D**, when Archangel Michael gifts Issei with the Dragon-slaying sword Ascalon, it attaches to his Boosted Gear gauntlet in this fashion, and he's able to make it appear and disappear at will. He can also separate it to lend it to someone else (usually he does it to Xenovia).

In dreams, it evolves into more of a built-in weapon, which alternately appears on his hand whole when he sheds a disguise, or sends its blades springing out from his (or a puppet's, or a possessed boy's, etc) fingertips. In **Wes Craven's New Nightmare**, a scene is filmed in which Freddy amputates his hand and replaces it with a razor-tipped robotic version, but this element doesn't seem to have carried over into the character's subsequent appearances.

Jame, the protagonist, is an exception, finding in them for the first time a weapon that she feels right with; she subsequently carries them everywhere.
-   **The Legend of Drizzt**: The Gutbuster Brigade wear bladed/spiked armor on which they regularly impale opponents, in addition to carrying massive axes or hammers.

Not blades, but just as effective, as evidenced by the piles of dust that used to be vampires. In the same series, Wesley uses a folding sword that pops out of his sleeve. He appears to hold it like a normal sword once its extended, though. When he loses his memory in one episode the practical problems of the concept are lampshaded, i.e. he nearly kills himself. And at one point, Connor shows up with an axe blade strapped to his arm.
    -   In at least one episode they're using forearm-mounted crossbows!
    -   Angel's retractable stakes became iconic for the series, remaining in the title sequence until the final season, and reappearing one last time (used by Gunn this time) in the Grand Finale.
-   Apophis uses one in **Stargate SG-1** in an attempt to kill Sokar. Though he failed, it's amazing he even got close enough to try, as said blade was a huge and very obvious device on his arm. He does manage to take out Sokar's First Prime and a Jaffa guard with it, though.

Blade Below the Shoulder Example in Tabletop Games

-   The Warforged Armblade component in **Eberron**.
    -   In 4th Edition, any sort of one-handed weapon can be attached to a Warforged's arm. However, they function like type three model in that the Warforged can't actually do anything with that hand while the weapon is grafted onto it, although it can be removed voluntarily and fairly quickly.
        -   Actually, light weapons can retract into the Warforged's arm, if made with a specific type of attachment.
        -   Not just fourth edition, they could do it in 3.5 as well. All the rules were a bit byzantine.
        -   Quite the opposite problem, actually. No rules were given on how to make an item as an attached or embedded component, other than "you can."
-   The **Complete Scoundrel** Splatbook for 3.5 has two arm blade options - sleeve blades like the kind in **Assassin's Creed**, reverse-facing elbow-blades, plus knee-blades, and boot-blades. You can even get blades hidden inside an instrument!
-   Shadowrun gives us Forearm Snap-blades, which functions as an alternative to the more famous Spurs. These are meant for the runner who either doesn't have the cash for or doesn't want to deal with the Essence loss imposed by cyberware.
-   Games Workshop games:
    -   In **Warhammer: Age of Sigmar**, Skaarac the Bloodborn has Brutal Blades chained to his forearms so that the Great Khorgorath of Khorne can hack and gouge at his enemies. This is in contrast to regular Khorgoraths who make do with their natural claws and tentacles to kill their foes.
    -   **Warhammer 40,000**:
        -   Eldar Warp Spider Exarches have access to Power Blades, described as fitting onto the forearm, allowing their wielder to use other weapons in addition to the blades.
        -   Chainfists are a variant of the Power Fist that combines the energy field of the powered gauntlet with the cutting power a chainsaw blade, allowing the wielder to cut through armoured vehicles and bulkheads as if they were paper.
        -   Lightning Claws are weapons consisting of a number of a number of blades wreathed in a power field and attached to an armoured gauntlet. How the blades are attached to the gauntlet differ, with some attached to the back of the hand while other patterns attaching the blades to the knuckles or have them replace the gauntlet’s fingers.
        -   The phase swords used by assassins of the Callidus Temple are worn on a on a bracer attached to the back of the wrist so that the wielder has her hand free to manipulate objects and handle her poisoned blades.
        -   One particular Space Marine Chapter from the Cursed Founding, Black Dragons, just happened to get a hyperactive Ossmodula (implant, responsible for strengthening the bones (and accelerating their growth) of it's recepient). While it meant that Space Marines from this Chapter often were disfigured in some way (and counted as mutants by many Imperials as a result), many Black Dragons also got horns and bone blades in their arms (even retractable ones — when their Apothecaries "perfected" the development of this mutation), which are quite useful in close combat.
        -   Soldiers of the Vraksian Renegade Militia have sharpened pieces of scrap metal strapped to the back of their arms to use as melee weapons during the trench fighting of the Siege of Vraks.

Blade Below the Shoulder Example in Video Games

-   **Advent Rising**: The Aurelians have large, scythe-like blades attached just below the elbow - and pointing backwards. Their fighting style consists primarily of elbow jabs.
-   **Akuji the Heartless**: Akuji's default melee weapons are his bone shives, attached underneath his elbow, which can slice up all kinds of monsters and demons.
-   **Arcana Heart 3**: Weiss can summon blades onto her wrists as her main combat method.
-   **Assassin's Creed**: The signature weapon of the Assassins is the Hidden Blade, an extendable knife attached to an arm-brace used to silently kill enemies. In **Assassin's Creed**, the ring finger of the Assassins' left hands are **cut off**<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> in order to make this usable. His sequel successor Ezio, on the other hand, pulls this off (on both hands, even) without the nasty "cutting off fingers" catch.
    -   In game this is justified by Altaïr having modified the design so it's raised further from the wrist, noting that having a severed ring finger is an obvious way for the Templars to pick out Assassins. The first "Codex" page that's decrypted is his design for this blade, This doesn't stop Leonardo da Vinci, from taking a moment to freak Ezio out by pinning his hand and raising a meat cleaver before saying "Just kidding" after repairing his father's broken blade he inherited.
    -   In **Brotherhood** the Prowler — a Templar attempt at fighting Assassins using their own methods — also has a forearm-mounted switchblade, if a wider and less fine-looking one, whose two blades pivot at the back to form a single blade in front. Ezio had to abandon the second (built by Leonardo, right-handed) of his Hidden Blades at the Siege of Monteriggioni, but had the original left-handed one replaced (or covered with a single-piece metal vambrace) upon his arrival in Rome, and Leonardo later constructed for him another right-handed Hidden Blade that now fit into the wrist of a leather glove.
    -   And in **Revelations**, Ezio loses his right-handed hidden blade **again** (the intro video shows him losing his left-handed hidden blade, but in gameplay he's missing the right-handed one) and has it replaced with one modified by the Assassins in Constantinople to have a hook on the end of the blade, allowing for more maneuverability when climbing and new abilities in combat.
    -   Each of Ezio's recruits in Rome was issued a Hidden Blade created by Leonardo da Vinci (as revealed in the Facebook game **Project Legacy**). By 2000 it had become "mostly ceremonial," but was still in use by the Assassins, and in fact Desmond Miles fought off a Templar invasion of an Assassin safehouse by wielding one.
    -   **Assassin's Creed III** presents a further variation. Haytham and Connor continue to wield two hidden blades, but the left blade (the one traditionally used for assassinations) has been modified so that it can be pivoted off the mechanism to be used as a clip point knife.
    -   **Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag** uses a broad-bladed variation that makes the blade look like a dagger. While subtlety is blown (the blade is worn **over** the clothes), it is also very useful for open combat. They still use two of them.
    -   **Assassin's Creed: Unity** goes back to one blade, but now it has a mini crossbow attached to it; the new moniker is "Phantom Blade".
    -   **Assassin's Creed Syndicate** brings back the dual blades, and now they have a hook attached to propel the user on buildings and make impromptu zip-lines.
-   **BioShock 2**: Big Sisters have a massive hypodermic needle which they use to impale enemies.
-   **BloodRayne**: Rayne wears sword-length blades attached to wrist cuffs; they mechanically rotate and extend in the same direction as her lower arms, with grips that she holds to keep them in place.
-   **Champions Online**: The Nephilim and PSI Mooks wear those. While the former can wear them even on their legs, the laters' are made of energy. Like many other costume pieces, blade bracers are unlockable and, despite being purely decorative, very popular amongst the players.
-   **City of Heroes**: With Weapons Customization, several varieties of arm blades are offered as an option for the Claws powerset.
-   **Cortex Command**: In the Dark Storm mod, the Tengu armor guys use an electro-magnetic charged knife which is attached to their wrists (like the Assassin Blade in one of the above examples)in their melee attack, the knife was once a separate weapon in the mod up until lua's introduction in the game.
-   **Doom Eternal**: The Doom Slayer's new armor now sports a massive extendable blade on his left arm.
-   **Fallout 2**: Frank Horrigan sports a massive extendable knife attached onto his armor on his right forearm. Though the armor itself is permanently grafted onto Horrigan, the blade probably is removable for maintenance purposes, and you actually can loot it from him after killing him (though, only by exploiting engine quirks). It's a pretty powerful melee weapon.
-   **Fighting Force** has female enemies on the 5th state that have these.
-   **Final Fantasy VIII**: Kiros uses a pair of katar (mistranslated in the English-language version as "katal").
-   The first weapon you can use in **Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance** is a pair of wicked-looking curved blades strapped to your arms, which you use to butcher enemy gladiators. You're given a sword after arriving in the Elysian fields in stage 2.
-   **Guilty Gear**: Chipp Zanuff has an odd variant. His weapon is a blade that runs parallel to his forearm and is attached to a armband he wears there. In the opening animation, he sometimes clicks it into place
-   **Halo**:
    -   The Elites absolutely **love** this type of weapon, as exemplified by the appearance of the Energy Sword itself, which is effectively an oversized katar. This is often a One-Hit Kill weapon that can turn invisible with its wielder, and (as of **Halo: Reach**) has its own assassination animations when wielded.
    -   In **Halo: Reach**, Elites also carry retractable Energy Daggers in their gauntlets. These are small blades that only appear in assassinations without the sword.
    -   **Halo Wars**: Arbiter Ripa 'Moramee carries full-length swords **on both arms** with knuckle guards.
    -   Arbiter Thel 'Vadam eventually gets his own custom Energy Sword with a knuckle guard, called the "Prophet's Bane."
-   **League of Legends**: Talon and Zed's signature weapons. Talon uses an oversized katar-like blade on his right arm (unlike the characters he's based on) while Zed uses a pair of katar-like blades mounted in his gauntlets. Both of them are classified as Assassins.
-   **Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver**: When Raziel acquires the Soul Reaver, it manifests as an energy blade extending from his palm.
-   **The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask**: The Garo have a scimitar strapped to each hand. Although they could be holding it under their ponchos, the attacks they use suggest otherwise.

-   **\[PROTOTYPE\]**:

-   Bun-bun of **Sluggy Freelance** attaches switchblades to the sides of his front paws on his spacesuit in "The Heavens and the Earth" to fight in zero-g.

Blade Below the Shoulder Example in Real Life

-   The Katar.
    -   As well as its larger cousin, the Pata.
    -   The wielder still has to ****hold**** both katar and pata. They're not attached to the arm; they're just held with a grip perpendicular rather than axial to the blade. That being said, they are almost certainly the inspiration for this kind of weapon in fiction.
-   In reality, a long blade that is parallel to the forearm <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> would be impractical, both because the wrist joint is so important in the use of a sword and because it would be dangerous to the user. A hard blow to the blade could potentially cause the forearm to break.
    -   You could use it to stab people effectively, as the motion for stabbing would be similar to a punch. This was often how the above-mentioned katars and patas were used historically, but no one in **fiction** ever seems to do that with solid blades.
-   Strap-on climbing spikes are sometimes used by professional tree trimmers or phone linemen to climb tree trunks and telephone poles. Subverted in that they're strapped to the **legs**, not the arms.
-   In its most popular form, the karambit can be attached to one's hand by means of fitting a finger through a hole in the pommel.
-   Undermining this trope was the original purpose of the handshake: To dislodge any concealed weapons from within one's sleeves, and to assure others that one was not carrying anything to begin with. Suffice to say, it was done much more forcefully back in the middle ages than it is today.
-   Ladies and gentlemen, the Serbcutter. Originally it was just a knife for cutting sheaves on the field, but then...

-   Jeremiah Gottwald from **Code Geass**, after having his body effectively rebuilt for the second time, gains two concealed swords, one in each arm. Oddly, his blades are longer than his forearms and clearly are not telescoping, so it's unclear how this actually works without impair his arms when the blades are retracted.
-   Taopaipai from **Dragon Ball** is rebuilt as a cyborg with this type of blade. He reveals it in his fight with Tenshinhan, using it to inflict the wounds that later become Tenshinhan's chest scars.

-   Sasori from **Naruto**. He stuck his sword into Sakura's gut. Sakura planned on keeping him focused on her by holding onto the blade, thinking he wouldn't let go and would worry on just finishing her off first; then he detached his puppet limb to reveal a blade within it, and promptly went to finish off Chiyo. Didn't work out too well, he got stabbed right in the heart capsule by the first two puppets he ever created, the ones made in the likeness of his deceased Mother and Father. Then he died.
-   Ikuro Hashizawa of **Baoh** fame. When in his "Baoh" form, he can brandish one on each arm, made of his own (albeit parasitic form) flesh. Said blades are known as "Reskiniharden Saber Phenomenon." He can even cut them off and throw them.
-   Kars from **Jojos Bizarre Adventure** has blades on his fore arms that he can retract into his arms at will. Their sharpness is due to the fact that they double as **chainsaws**. He can also sprout blades from his legs. These are all also apparently a biological part of his body.
-   In **Transformers: Cybertron** Starscream's Cyber Key-activated weapons are a pair of arm-mounted blades. And in Episode 25, he uses them to great effect when he goes on a Foe-Tossing Charge through the entire Autobot army. One is eventually broken, and later replaced with a cannon.

-   The titular Shin in **Shin Kamen Rider: Prologue** has a set of razor-sharp protrusions on his forearms that act like serrations on a knife, allowing him to cut into the flesh of his opponents.

-   In the third season premiere of **Transformers: Animated**, a newly-upgraded Sari Sumdac has a pair of energy-blades extending from within her forearms, though they are later permanently disabled and never seen again. Word of God (via Wyatt's formspring) is that they're still there, but their power output has been heavily reduced. Sari probably isn't too keen to use them again after what happened to Bumblebee.
-   **Transformers: Prime**: Arcee has two retractable forearm-mounted blades, while Optimus and Ratchet have ones that can replace their hands when necessary. Optimus has full-length swords similar to his movie weapons, while Ratchet's could sort-of pass for surgical tools. Megatron carries a BFS that slides out of the area between his right arm and his permanently-mounted Arm Cannon.
-   All the way back in the second episode of **The Transformers**, Optimus Prime was able to retract his fist and replace it with a glowing energy axe. Despite his figure having removable fists that could easily have accomidated such an accessory, it wouldn't be until 2003 that an action figure was released that had the axe.

Blade Below the Shoulder Example in Real Life

-   Mantids (such as the Praying Mantis) actually have two of these facing opposite directions that act as pincers when the arms are extended.
-   Mantis shrimp specialized in hunting fish have raptorial arms designed to stabbing. It's already pretty easy considering the species can already punch with the force of a .22 caliber bullet fired from a rifle. This may not count, as the mantis shrimp's "arms" are actually modified mouthparts.
-   One of the most distinctive features of the dinosaur **Iguanodon** is a thumb spike, a sharp protuberance on both of the dinosaur's hands in the rough position of a thumb on a human hand. There is some debate as to what the spike actually did, with most paleontologists theorizing that it was used for self-defense, or in combat with other **Iguanodon**, wheras others believe it was used to crack open hard-shelled fruits, seeds or nuts.
-   Spinosaurid dinosaurs like Spinosaurus, Baryonyx, and Suchomimus had a greatly enlarged thumb claw. Scientists aren't completely sure what the claw was for, but suspect that it was for clawing fish like a modern grizzly bear or to hold down large prey while ripping it apart with their jaws.

## Blade replaces hand or arm:

Blade Below the Shoulder Example in Anime and Manga

-   Koku from **B: The Beginning** can turn his left arm into a extremely sharp blade.
    -   Izanami can turn her left leg into a similar blade, an ability that she passes onto Koku after he kills her.
-   Creed's Phantom Blade Lv.3 in **Black Cat** replaces his arm with a Tao Blade and sprouts an extra arm.
    -   Eve in the same series usually morphs one of her hands into a blade to use as a Shapeshifter Weapon.
-   Shira in **Blade of the Immortal**, after losing a hand, decides to **sharpen the bones in his arm** and use that as a blade. Apparently, when he decided this he forgot to consider that it would hurt like hell to hit something with it. Like he'd care anyway...
-   In **My-HiME**, Robot Girl Miyu can replace her lower arm with a sword (among other things).
-   Chachamaru in **Negima! Magister Negi Magi** carries one that replaces her standard arm along with an Arm Cannon. How she goes back to her normal arms has yet to be seen.
-   The **Mazinger** series:
    -   **Mazinger Z**: Mechanical Beast Brutus-M3 had a scimitar-like blade replacing one of its arms.
    -   **Great Mazinger**: Several Mechanical Beasts had bladed weapons -or even spiked maces- instead of hands or arms. The first examples appeared in the last episode of Mazinger-Z (Gratonios) and in the first episode of the sequel.
-   The true form of Allen Walker's Innocence in **D.Gray-Man** is a BFS that is **made** from his arm. Different from the usual "third kind" of this trope in that the sword isn't attached to his body any more- he has to hold it in his remaining hand.
-   Snimon from **Digimon** is a **virus-hunting praying mantis sniper** (mind you, all of that besides "praying mantis" is All There in the Manual and never witnessed, but he **is** pretty badass) who cleaves opponents with its giant blades, and is capable of shooting pink crescent beams from them with its Twin Sickles attack (known as Shadow Sickle in Japanese. There's a better version called Ultimate Twin Sickles, which increases the number of energy blades fired.) He's also one of the rare Mons who can overpower Digimon of higher levels than he.
    -   Omegamon/Omnimon's Transcendent Sword is technically this, since it comes out of his "hand" - which is composed of a WarGreymon skull/helmet instead of an actual hand with fingers. (Unlike Snimon, we don't have to worry about how he picks stuff up. This is a Fusion Dance Super Mode saved for special occasions and only taken on under dire circumstances. In his? Their? default form of Agumon and Gabumon, they've got hands, though Agumon doesn't appear to have thumbs.)
        -   Similarly, there's Duskmon. Like Omni/Omegamon, the blades are extended from his "hands" with are shaped like a pair of draconic skulls. Unlike Omnimon, he spends a great deal of time in this form, making one wonder how he held things other than "biting" them.
    -   Shurimon has giant shurikens for hands and feet, and his limbs are actually coils and are extendable. Again, combat form.
-   **One Piece**': Axe-Hand Morgan... well, has an axe for a hand. A big one. Specifically his right forearm has been replaced with an axe, not even bothering to remove the handle, which can be seen stretching out the skin behind his elbow.
-   **Soul Eater**: The bladed Weapons can do this, with Death Scythes like Spirit and Soul managing more varied transformations.

-   **Fullmetal Alchemist**:
    -   One of the combat automail arms that Buccaneer uses over the course of the series, the "Crocodile", is this combined with a **chainsaw**.
    -   Envy at one point turns its lower arm into a blade when fighting Ling. In the original anime, Envy uses the same trick on Ed, except this time he/she **kills him with it**.
-   **Dororo**: Hyakkimaru, the main character, has swords concealed in his prosthetic arms, which slide off just below the elbow when he needs the blades. After he regains his real arms, he switches to wielding the swords as normal.
-   **Gunsmith Cats**: Gray equips himself with a bladed prosthetic after Rally Vincent blows off his hand. He swaps the blade for a hook for everyday use. He can shoot the blade like a spear using a powerful spring built into the forearm.
-   **Genzo**: The wild girl Otsuru uses a rusty blade as prosthetic right hand. Later the main character Genzo build a better curved blade for her.
-   **Brigadoon: Marin and Melan**: The gun-swordsmen have one arm that ends with a blade instead of a hand, and another that ends with an Arm Cannon.
-   **Blood+**: Solomon Goldsmith shapeshifts one of this hands into a blade as a weapon of choice.
-   Baroqueheat in **Dazzle** can change his right hand and forearm into a sword when he needs to.
-   **Franken Fran**: Gavrill, unlike her sister Veronica , doesn't have blades inside her body, but is able to transform her body into, among other things, said blades.
-   **Accel World**: Deconstructed. Kuroyukihime's avatar was generated with blades instead of arms due to her desire for power at the expense of human relationships. At one point she expresses regret that this means she can't embrace the Innocently Insensitive Haruyuki.
-   **Blame!**: Maeve has a large blade in the place of one of her hands. The other is replaced by an Arm Cannon.
-   **Blue Ramun**: Zig-Zagged — Rowan's dragon Tisuodo has lost his right arm above the elbow, but is able to summon/ create a dragon-headed prosthesis that he can use like a Whip Sword.
-   **Gamaran Shura**: after being deprived of his right arm, psycho assassin Raio Magami didn't give up fighting and instead crafted himself a katar-like scissor blade he calls "Vajra" and attached it to his right arm as a new weapon alongside his \[\[Whip Sword Urumi). He even developed a technique specifically for Vajra.

Blade Below the Shoulder Example in Comic Books

-   **Shang-Chi** minor villain Razorfist, as the name implies, has two foot blades replacing each hand. The difficulty of, for example, eating are frequently lampshaded; Razorfist shirks all responsibility onto others to care for him (and they do because oh crap he is a crazy muscular martial artist with freaking swords for hands). This Razorfist is actually the second or third, depending on how you count it - he originally shared the name with his brother, each having only one blade-hand. He's so used to them that, whenever someone decides to replace them for prosthetic hands, he gets completely lost on how to use them.
-   Razorsharp of The DCU team books **Psyba-Rats** and **Blood Pack** was a Playful Hacker (with Cracker tendencies) whose superpower was that her arms could morph into swords. In **Psyba-Rats** she mainly used them to climb walls and break into buildings (in a good cause, usually); in **Blood Pack** she was reluctantly put in a position where she'd have to use them in combat.
-   **The Avengers** villain The Grim Reaper has a scythe blade on his right hand. Originally it was a Type One "techno-scythe" supplied by the Tinkerer. Later, his right hand got amputated and replaced by a magical scythe when he was empowered by the demon Lloigoroth.
-   Amokk, from **Hyperkind**, has his hands replaced with foot-long blades. In the second issue, he laments that he'll never play the guitar again, until he and the rest of the team discover that they can shapeshift back to their human forms.
-   **Batman and the Outsiders**: The Outsiders once fought a villain named Nunchuku, who instead of hands, had, well... what do you expect? He was arguably one of the **less** silly opponents The Outsiders faced.

-   The blind Persian executioner in **300** has swords instead of arms.

-   Azog of **The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies** has a thin orc blade to replace the arm he lost in a previous battle outside Moria. However in the previous two films he had a simple mock metal forearm and hand, meaning he could also qualify as a Type I<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>.
-   In the made-for-TV movie adaptation of **Moby-Dick** (the one that stars Patrick Stewart as Captain Ahab), Ahab and crew meet up with another whaling ship, whose captain lost an arm to the white whale. He had it replaced with a harpoon.
-   Cogliostro from **Spawn (1997)** can turn his arm into a glowing sword, or at least the movie version can.
-   One ability of the shape-shifting T-1000 in **Terminator 2: Judgment Day**. He gives Todd an arm-blade through the mouth while posing as Janelle when John calls up his (now-dead) foster parents.
-   **Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings** features an Elite Mook who has had one forearm replaced with a retractable, apparently red-hot-at-the-edges blade; his license plate is RZRFST and his car has a giant, graffiti-tag RAZOR FIST on the side, so he's pretty definitely the MCU version of Razor Fist (See comics, above), albeit one with fewer limb-blades, but more brains.
-   **Wild Wild West**. When Jim West fights several of Mad Scientist Dr. Loveless's altered men inside the giant mechanical spider, one of them has extendable sword blades implanted in his arms instead of hands.
-   In **X-Men: Days of Future Past**, while the Future Sentinel’s Eye Beams are quite powerful, they are slow to charge, and when caught up close they tend to resort to forming their arms into pikes and running targets through.

With this device Egil can fight as before, and in fact becomes a feared swordsman.

-   Tons of **Ultra Series** kaiju fall under this category, but perhaps the most notable one is Dorako from the original **Ultraman**, who looks an awful lot like a non-cyborg version of Gigan above (and keep in mind that Gigan debuted in 1972 while Dorako first appeared in 1966).
    -   Ultraman Max and Ultraman Mebius (plus Ultraman Hikari) have these weapons as part of their movesets; Max can summon a wrist-mounted energy blade called the Max Galaxy, which he uses to fire an incredibly powerful beam, summon forcefields and channel solar energy into his body, while Mebius and Hikari can both summon forearm-mounted energy swords from their braces to slice away at foes.
    -   Ultraman Agul can form a Laser Blade from his hand as a melee weapon. Gaia gains the ability to do the same after receiving Agul's light, and even has a sword duel with Bizorm, a monster who can do the same, in Episode 42.

One day, Kargath decided he'd had enough, so he strangled his overseer with his chain and sliced off his manacled hand, replacing it with a blade. He then encouraged his fellow slaves to follow his example, and they rose up and killed their ogre masters.
-   **StarCraft**:
    -   The Zerg Hydralisk has arms that end in huge scythe-blades that it cannot use in combat (although it does in cutscenes), because somebody was unable to incorporate melee and projectile attacks in one unit. In **StarCraft II**, it's able to finally use those blades, even if the difference between a blade swipe and its regular ranged attack is minor at best.
    -   The Ultralisk which has two giant Kaiser Blades on its head.
-   In **League of Legends**, Urgot, prior to his rework, has one arm replaced with a blade, the other replaced with a CANNON. The skin Dreadnova Gangplank also replaces most of Gangplank's body with cybernetic augmentations, complete with his sword arm becoming a blade from elbow-down.

    -   Although considering the Pirates are giant Flying Mantises, how do you distinguish their regular arms from blades?

    -   In **Oblivion**, in the **Shivering Isles** expansion, we have the Gatekeeper, a sizeable Frankenstein-like monster guarding the entrance to the Isles. One of his arms is a giant blade. After killing the monster, we are tasked later on with putting him back together, using various body parts. For his arm, we can choose between the exact same blade and also an axe and a mace. The cut content suggests that there was also a regular fist to be included too...
-   In **Rimworld** you can replace your pawns' arms, weather they lost the limb or not, with Mechanoid blades. This, predictably, gives the pawn in question a severe penalty to work they do compared to even a regular prosthetic, but it equally predictably gives an excellent modifier to melee attacks. Assuming the pawn is unarmed, anyway, since the game AI will prioritize held weapons even if their arm blades are superior.

-   **Generator Rex**: one of Rex's favoured weapons, after the dual Power Fist, is to transmute his hand into a BFS.
-   Shiv, a supporting **Static Shock** villain, could replace his hands with nifty energy blades. If memory serves, this power was relatively versatile, but true to his name, he always came back to this...
-   **Transformers**:
    -   Optimus Prime again, this time in **Transformers: Generation 1**, with an Energon axe in the three-part Series Premiere. Megatron had an Energon Mace. Despite using these weapons only that one time in the entire series, they're considered iconic to the characters, and even referenced by similar weapons in the movie listed above. Both of the characters Masterpiece series toys included plastic versions of the weapons. These were more of a combination of the second and third types, given that they retracted their hands to deploy them.
    -   Yet another Optimus: his **Transformers: Prime** incarnation has two arm-blades **and** two arm-cannons. Both of Ratchet's arms can also become short swords ("I recommend dissection.")
-   **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987)**

-   When Villain of the Week Zorax loses his gun, he makes swords appear from his wrist gauntlet. He matches Leonardo blow for blow, then cuts one of Leonardo's swords (a katana) in half.

Blade Below the Shoulder Example in Real Life

-   Not quite a blade, but a man named Aron Ralston who, after getting his arm trapped under a boulder for 5 days whilst mountain climbing, **cut off his own arm to free himself**, then proceeded to replace the amputated limb with an ice pick and climb the crap out of some more mountains.
-   Galvarino, war leader of the Mapuche tribe in the 16th century, was captured by the Spanish and had both his hands cut off to serve as a visual warning to the rest of his tribe. Because he was a total badass, however, he went back to the tribe, got them super-pissed at the Spanish, and then **tied blades to his arms** to compensate for the fact that he had no hands. He then proceeded to lead an army against the bastards who disfigured him. The Spanish ended up killing him eventually (they wanted to let him go because they felt sorry for him, but he would hear none of it), but it's important to note that the Mapuche tribe was one of the few that never fell under Spanish rule (it joined Chile in the 18th century).
-   Before modern prosthetics, individuals who lost a hand in an accident or in combat could have a hook fitted over the stump.
-   The dinosaur **Mononykus** had lost two of the fingers on its hands, leaving only a large single claw (hence the name: "One Claw"). It's suspected that it may have used this claw to break into insect nests like a modern anteater.
