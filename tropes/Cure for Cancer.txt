Cure for Cancer: 
**Marcus:** Curing cancer, Mr. Wyndam-Pryce?  
**Wesley:** Wouldn't be cost-effective. I'm sure we make a lot from cancer.  
**Marcus:** Yes, the patent holder is a client.

A specific type of MacGuffin, the Cure for Cancer is something like a modern-day _panacea_. It is the ultimate medical achievement that everyone is looking for. Some people will want to sell it, some will want to spread it for free, and some will want to destroy it. Or it may be a plot point to get it Just in Time to the Littlest Cancer Patient.

For some reason (half Fantastic Aesop and half Status Quo Is God), the cure often has some horrific side effect — it causes zombies, is made from people, or what have you. Often combined with Withholding the Cure.

Note that the reason we don't have this in Real Life (and the reason it is so sought-after) is that "cancer" is an extremely general term for any number of diseases. Some of them _have_ had cures discovered (or at least effective long-term treatments, or preventative vaccinations), but no miracle cure for the whole lot is forthcoming, and it's quite probable that we will never find one.

Minor variations include cures for other terminal, incurable diseases, such as Parkinson's and AIDS. As these are becoming more treatable, however, miracle cures for them are showing up less in fiction.

Davros is unimpressed with the short-sightedness of the Kaled leadership.

    -   Another storyline, **The Thanos Imperative**, involves "The Cancerverse" — an Alternate Universe where Captain Marvel's life **was** saved... by **killing Death**. It turned **all** life in the universe into immortal, cancerous beings. The cure was worse than the disease indeed...
    -   A **What If?** where they cure Captain Marvel results in him becoming the cancer-spreading equivalent of Typhoid Mary, which spreads cancer throughout the galactic community, ends up killing the Thing, and results in him and his love interest being sent to a timeless empty dimension for eternity as they apparently can't find a way to cure the cure.

Naturally, a corrupt pharmaceuticals company bent on Withholding the Cure interferes with him every step of the way.
-   In **New X-Men: Academy X**, Prodigy is shown a vision of what would happen if he has the mental block preventing him from permanently gaining the knowledge he absorbs removed. The first thing he does after he leaves the school is work with his old roommate, Elixir, and he creates a cure for both cancer and AIDS (with the promise of curing every major disease on the planet) that he distributes around the world for free... at the cost of Elixir's life, since Prodigy created the cure by cutting his friend up too much.
-   Spider-Man has a couple of enemies, Styx and Stone, who are a result of this. Stone was trying to create a vaccine against cancer, and Styx was his test subject.

-   In **Spider-Man and the X-Men** #2, Spidey notes that the LEGO Genetics technology that Sauron has could easily be used to cure cancer, considering it manipulates genetics on a whim on a wide swath of people. However, Sauron has only one thing on his mind, and doesn't feel like it.
    
    **Spider-Man:** You can rewrite DNA on the fly, and you're using it to turn people into **dinosaurs**? But with tech like that, you could cure **cancer**!

-   In **Transmetropolitan**, Spider keeps a bag of anti-cancer genes in his bathroom. Comes in handy with all the cigarettes and other assorted drugs he and his filthy assistants and mutant cat take.
-   In Marvel Comics, the Venom symbiote feeds off of Eddie Brock's cancer when they're joined, keeping it at bay. After losing the symbiote, Brock encounters Martin Li, the good half of the supervillain Mister Negative, and Li's Healing Hands cures Brock's cancer permanently... which the side-effect of turning him into Anti-Venom. Something to do with his white blood cells and remnants of the symbiote. It's a comic book, just roll with it.
-   **Wonder Woman** Vol 1: In #17 Dr. Lana Kurree creates a "cancer cure" called Plasmin. It is not treated as a cure all, just a very effective treatment that her boyfriend is trying to steal the patent for.

Cure for Cancer Example in Fan Fic

-   **A Darker Path**: Alice is startled when Atropos suggests that she might be capable of building an exotic "bomb" to kill cancer cells. After thinking about it, though, she decides that she probably **could**, with some research and testing, build a bomb that would kill cancer and nothing else. However, that would leave holes in the patient's body, filled with whatever slurry or other material the cancer cells turned into. Director Piggot suggests that it could still be useful for eradicating traces after surgically removing the main tumour, and schedules some time for her to work with Miss Medic.
-   **Escape from the Moon**: In the later sequel **Scavenge for the Future**, Spliced Genome is able to fix Aerostorm's lung cancer just by sending a magical pulse through her and harmlessly pulling all the cancer cells out, then disintegrating them.
-   Much like everything else, parodied in **I Am NOT Going Through Puberty Again!**. The "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue mentions that Orochimaru discovered such a cure...except it only worked on sharks and turned them into "flying, amphibious hellbeasts". He was promptly barred from practicing medicine. As for the sharks, Kisame took custody and used them to start a circus.
-   Played for Drama in **Mega Man: Defender of the Human Race**. Dr. Cossack's wife died of cancer prior to the start of the story and his grief drove him to try and find a cure to prevent others from suffering from it. But his devotion caused him to unintentionally neglect Kalinka and not realize how she needed help with her grieving, eventually resulting in her attempting suicide.

Cure for Cancer Example in Film — Live-Action

-   In **Daybreakers**, when a human is turned into a vampire, it cures all of their ailments, including cancer. It also freezes their bodies at the age they were when they turned. Too bad they can only drink human blood which is in very short supply. That is, until a working substitute is found near the end.
-   The scientists in **Deep Blue Sea** are growing giant super-smart sharks to harvest chemicals from the sharks' brains that can be used to cure Alzheimer. Unfortunately, the process involved GROWING GIANT SUPER SMART SHARKS!
-   The machines that **Elysium** makes use of are manufactured by a MegaCorp known as Armadyne. They are known as the Med-Pod 3000, and they'll cure anything from crow's feet to cancer. All it takes is a simple scan and brief surgery. Max DaCosta is trying to get to Elysium because he is dying from extreme radiation exposure, and using a Med-Pod would save his life. Frey, his childhood friend, is also desperate to get to Elysium because her daughter is dying of leukemia.
-   In **I Am Legend**, scientists genetically modified the Measles virus in order to create a cure for cancer. Unfortunately, it mutated and one of the side effects was a Vampire Apocalypse.
-   The zombies in **I Eat Your Skin** were created during an attempt to find this. As Dr. August Biladeau explains while dying, he was getting nowhere with the injections of the animals, so he started using the natives as human guinea pigs. However, instead of getting closer to a cure for cancer, the bombarded snake venom was sending up a curious reaction into the body tissues, making the subject devoid of will; a human vegetable. Three natives died because of Biladeau's futile attempts. When Dr. Bentley found the results of Biladeau's experiments, Bentley became obsessed with the idea of creating an army of the undead and threatened to expose Biladeau to the authorities unless he helped him with his mad scheme.
-   This is Dr. Phillips' dream in **Island of Terror**. Unfortunately, he is presented as careless and impatient, leading to his efforts accidentally creating a race of bone-eating monsters.

-   **Medicine Man**. Dr. Robert Campbell (Sean Connery) discovers a cure for cancer and then loses it.
-   **Mimic** puts a bit of a twist on this trope in that in order to stop an epidemic affecting the children of New York City, they don't engineer the giant mutant killer bugs to manufacture a direct cure, but because the Judas Breed specifically feed on cockroaches, the disease's carriers. They just become anthropophages after devouring the entire cockroach population.
-   In **The Monster Maker**, Dr. Markoff has developed both a means of infecting people with acromegaly (a condition usually caused by a defective pituitary gland and having no known cure) and a cure for it. He plans to use the serums in a Poison and Cure Gambit.

-   **Shark Attack**: Miles has been injecting the sharks with hormones so he can later harvest them for a cancer cure. He demonstrates this when he takes the hero to a young African boy who would have died if not for his cure. Steven calls him out for his breach of ethics by going to a developing country to test experimental drugs on children, and it later turns out that there's problems with the drug anyway.
-   The Mad Scientist villain in **Spiders II: Breeding Ground** had a similar plan, breeding Giant Spiders on a seaborn vessel so he could study their immune system and use it to improve humanity. Where to start with the Hollywood Science on that one...

Cure for Cancer Example in Literature

-   In the Neil Gaiman short story "Changes", a cure for **almost** all forms of cancer known as "rebooting" is developed, which, while it cures any case of cancer overnight, also has the minor side effect of switching the patient's biological sex... until they take another dose, anyway. The **intended** use for the drug barely merits a mention after its creator realizes what happened to the first patient it's tested on.
-   In the novel **The Child Garden** by Geoff Ryman, cancer is eradicated — and it's discovered, too late, that it was the downside of an important part of the metabolism, which has also been eradicated in the process, drastically reducing human lifespan.

Unfortunately, people without the disease started abusing it because of the enhanced mind capabilities that it gave them, and this led to a generation of children with a disease called hyperempathy syndrome, in which they feel the perceived emotions of others.
-   This is a plot point in the earliest issues of **Perry Rhodan**. One important reason the Human Aliens stranded on the moon are even willing to consider working together with the primitive humans who've only just managed to land there themselves is because Earth medicine has recently developed a cure for the disease that threatens the life of the alien expedition's scientific leader — a form of leukemia.
-   **The Succession Duology** mentions at one point that every time the main gun is fired, the crew develop "the simplest and most easily cured cancers" as a side effect.

One experiment results in the test monkey not only surviving but also becoming immune to any and all disease or poison. The scientist's Corrupt Corporate Executive brother wants to withhold this cure-all from the general population, pointing out that this would result in overpopulation. However, he uses the drug himself to cure his hereditary condition. In the end, though, it's revealed that the drug's effect is extremely temporary. In fact, it rapidly drains all the body's resources, leaving the person a frail shell only surviving through the use of life-sustaining machines.
    -   "The New Breed" involves the use of nanites to monitor and repair cells. However, their "repair" feature doesn't appear to have a limit, and they start improving what they see as flaws of the human body. The person who injects himself with them tests his ability to hold his breath underwater... and the nanites end up giving him gills. Eventually, he also gets eyes on the back of his head to improve his vision. In the end, the inventor of the nanites, his friend, ends up having to kill him. It should be noted that the nanites are still in the testing phase, and the guy only takes them because he has terminal cancer.

Cure for Cancer Example in Webcomics

-   In **The Adventures of Dr. McNinja**, Dracula discovered the cure for cancer and hid it on Mars.
    
    **Dracula:** It's really funny, when you figure it out it's going to seem so obvious. But I don't want to give it away. It'll be really funny.
    
-   **Freefall**: While pilfering a closet of pharmaceuticals, Sam dismisses several bottles of "over-the-counter cancer cures" and "cheap life extension pills" as worthless.

-   A **Penny Arcade** strip shows a What If? scenario where Tycho cures cancer as a result of not becoming friends with Gabe.
-   **PHD**, "Tales from the MD Anderson Cancer Research Center", which is mostly about debunking the idea that that there is one singular cure for cancer.
-   **Stand Still, Stay Silent**: This role is played by the cure for the Rash, the disease that caused The End of the World as We Know It ninety years ago, as far as humanity's survivors are concerned. One of the comic's plotlines involves the main cast finding a lead toward a cure discovered Just Before the End in the Forbidden Zone that they are exploring.

-   **Family Guy**: The episode "The Old Man and the Big 'C'" is about Stewie and Brian discovering that Carter Pewterschmidt is withholding a cure for cancer, because he makes more money from the medical expenses of treating cancer patients.
-   **Men in Black: The Series**: One of the pieces of Imported Alien Phlebotinum MIB has is the cure for the common cold. When Jay says he thought it didn't exist, Elle says that it does, it's just "not common". Apparently, it's just a pill you take once.

Cure for Cancer Example in Real Life

-   Gleevec, Taxol, Cannabinoids. No, really, and etc, etc.
-   Antimatter. No, really.
-   Surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are actually rather efficient assuming the disease was identified at an early stage.
    -   The simple expedient of directly injecting a tumor with chemotherapy drugs to ensure that the tumor gets the lion's share shows much greater promise than general injection of the drugs. For some reason, this wasn't thought of until ~2008.
-   Experimental therapies showing promise include engineered nanobodies which attach specifically to cancerous cells and either deliver apoptosis-inducing chemicals without harming the healthy tissue or simply allow the body's immune system to recognize cancer as a hostile entity. This kind of therapy requires custom-tailored nanobodies made specifically to match the type of cancerous cells manifest in a patient. As advances in cheaply and efficiently sequencing human genomes make the procedure of recognizing cancerous mutations simpler, it is quite probable that personalized medicine will be the key to defeating cancer on a case-by-case basis.
-   Several drugs are really effective at certain types of cancer. One drug reduced the size and amount of tumors in half in three days! Problem is that it was only for a specific type of melanoma.
-   Disabling the Cancer Cell's Do Not Eat signal is also possible.
