Brother–Sister Incest: 
_"Of brother and of sister, be a bar  
'Twixt my perpetual happiness and me?  
Say that we had one father, say one womb  
(Curse to my joys!) gave both us life and birth;  
Are we not, therefore, each to other bound  
So much the more by nature? by the links  
Of blood, of reason? nay, if you will have it,  
Even of religion, to be ever one,  
One soul, one flesh, one love, one heart, one all?"_

Romantic and/or sexual attraction between siblings. Most of the time it may be merely implied, but sometimes it's laid out right in the open for the viewer to see. Its presence in a story usually adds a great deal of emotional intensity.

Often it's just an extreme version of the Childhood Friend Romance setup; male and female characters who normally couldn't cohabitate with each other are "forced" to but meet with an arbitrary contrivance preventing them from developing past it. The only difference is that the audience is more likely to accept the latter contrivance as believable.

Many of the world's mythologies contain a fair amount of sibling incest between the gods, including Egyptian and Mesopotamian mythology, making the trope Older Than Dirt.

Not Blood Siblings and Surprise Incest are two Sister Tropes which ask the same question: What _is_ it about kinship that makes incest an issue? Each scenario isolates one variable. Not Blood Siblings is about social kinship without any biological relation (such as adopted, fostered, or step-sibs), while Surprise Incest deals with biological kin without any social kinship (such as long lost sibs). Which of these two can to pursue their chosen target with relative impunity? There is no general consensus on that.

Many sociologists and evolutionary psychologists believe that the instinctive aversion to incest has developed to avoid the pairing of rare, potentially lethal, recessive genes. However, this is a very modern explanation that's only dates back to the mid 1800s. Religious prohibition was the typical explanation before that, along with occasional arguments about social kinship.

Although the Japanese have just as much of an incest taboo as any other culture, there does not seem to be any automatic assumption of tragedy surrounding incestuous relationships in anime, as there would be in most Western productions. It may be shown as sad, improper, and/or perhaps even reprehensible, but participants are no more likely to come out to a bad end than any other characters in the story. A supposed Japanese legend which states that star-crossed lovers are reborn as siblings probably has something to do with it as well.

The usage of sibling terminology applied to an unrelated love interest is a linguistic convention that appears and reappears all around the world, from ancients (Ancient Egyptian love poetry and Song of Songs) to contemporaries (modern Japanese and Korean honorifics).

See also Creepy Twins, Twincest, Not Blood Siblings, Kissing Cousins, Big Brother Attraction, Royal Inbreeding, and Little Sister Heroine. Contrast with Parental Incest, where the parent/child power dynamics can make it even squickier. Not to be confused with Double In-Law Marriage, where both of the couples are Not Blood Siblings but siblings-in-law.

**NOTE:** This trope is for actual cases of incest in-story. Incestuous _subtext_ goes in Incest Subtext.

Brother–Sister Incest Example in Fairy Tales

-   Sometimes used as a substitute for Parental Incest in fairy tales, such as **Penta of the Chopped-Off Hands**.
-   In **Princess Belle-Etoile**, Belle-Etoile struggles with her feelings toward **one** of her brothers, Cheri, and his toward hers. Until she overhears a conversation between her parents, and finds they were actually all foundlings, and various things about them made even the parents think that he might not be her brother. In reality, he's her double first cousin.

Brother–Sister Incest Example in Films — Animation

-   **Hercules** doesn't mention it, but technically, Hera and Zeus **are** siblings (as are the rest of the gods).
-   **The Lion King (1994)** may or may not contain a half-sibling example with Simba and Nala. While any shared parentage is never made explicit, the movie never addresses the fact that Mufasa, as king of the pride, would normally be the one to father any cubs, and that Mufasa and Scar (who is stated never to have fathered any cubs) are the only male lions anywhere to be seen. The spinoff cartoon **The Lion Guard** showed that Nala's father is an unrelated male but it contains inconsistencies with the films and Disney doesn't acknowledge spinoffs or most sequels, so it's still rather ambiguous who Nala's father is.

Brother–Sister Incest Example in Jokes

-   A young man is going at it hot and heavy with a young lady. He finishes, rolls off her, then says "Gee, sis, you're even better in bed than Mom!" She says, "Thanks, I know, Daddy said the same thing!"
-   Dad once caught me and my sister smoking cigarettes together. He was so angry, he dragged us both straight out of the bed.

Brother–Sister Incest Example in Music

-   The Sophie B. Hawkins song "Don't Stop Swaying" depicts a brother and sister who fall in love, from the sister's viewpoint. The implication is that they were abused or abandoned by their parents and turned to each other for comfort.
-   Kate Bush: The Title Track to **The Kick Inside** is adapted from the folk song "Lizie Wan", about a woman who gets pregnant from a sexual tryst with her brother, who murders her for it; the titular kick is her fetus moving inside her uterus. In Bush's rendition, Lizie takes her own life instead.
-   'Cry Little Sister' from **The Lost Boys**, by Gerard McMahon, is a love song from a brother to his sister. It may be incestuous or metaphorical but deep passion is implied.
    
    Temptation heat  
    beats like a drum  
    deep in your veins  
    I will not lie, little sister  
    come to your brother  
    unchain me sister  
    love is with your brother
    
-   'Brother and Sister' by The Gun Club ends with.
    
    I am your brother, your lover, I give you my blood  
    I'll follow you anywhere
    
-   Not uncommon as a theme in folk songs either; "Sheath & Knife" probably being one most easily listened to at the moment. Example modern lyrics.
-   Several Child ballads have this as a theme, actually; for instance, "Lizie Wan".
-   The song "Spiel mit Mir" by Rammstein is about incest between two siblings. The only one specified is that the song is addressed to 'brother' (given that the singer is male though, most people presume it's between two brothers rather than a brother and sister).
-   Possibly the Dashboard Confessional song "The Secret's in the Telling". Lyrics like 'we keep this secret in our blood' would, at least, seem to imply this trope.
-   Sound Horizon's song "Ark", to a T. The song is told by the girl, who wants the brother to forget about their initial relation and be ignorant. Here it is with subtitles.
-   The Ghost Bee's **Tear Tassle Ogre Heart**, although it may be one-sided (on the sister's side).
-   The first part of "The Tain," by The Decemberists, contains this.
-   In the song "Mary be Fair", a young man has a series of marriage prospects shot down by his father, who reveals that he fathered each of the girls during an affair. At the end, it turns out that it's ok, since the mother reveals that she'd been having an affair as well, so he isn't actually related to the girls after all.
    -   This is also the plot of Mike Cross's "Emma Turl".
    -   The gender-reversed version is the plot of Buffy Sainte-Marie's "Johnny be Fair".
    -   ...And of "Shame and Scandal in the Family" by Sir Lancelot.
    -   ...And of Cornelis Vreeswijk's "Incestvisan" (The Incest Song).
    -   ...And of Jimmy Driftwood's "Mixed Up Family".
-   "Butterflies" by Sia sounds like a love song about a long relationship that's had many ups and downs, but ends with the lyric, "Because we came from the same cocoon."
-   Have three guesses what the song "Geschwisterliebe" (German for "sibiling love") by Die Ärzte is rather explicit about.
-   In the Andy M. Stewart song "The Orphans' Wedding", a happy marriage is brutally interrupted when a government official informs husband and wife that that they are, in fact, siblings.
-   The line "You can fool with your brother, But don't mess with a missionary man" in the chorus of the Eurythmics song "Missionary Man" implies that the singer has at least had thoughts in that direction, whether or not she's actually done anything.
-   Prince loves this trope:
    -   "I Wanna Be Your Lover" from **Prince** invokes this metaphorically, with the narrator voicing his desire to "be your brother ... your mother and your sister, too."
    -   "Sister" from **Dirty Mind** is narrated by a man who revels in his sexual relationship with, well, his sister.
-   The Vocaloid song "Cantarella" by Kurousa-P is based on the historical gossip about the relationship between Cesare and Lucrezia Borgia, children of Pope Alexander VI (the rumors were started by Lucrezia's ex-husband, who was forced to declare himself impotent in the divorce). The song is titled after the impossibly Perfect Poison the siblings supposedly used against their enemies.
-   Heart's song **Barracuda** is an angry rebuttal of the rumour that Ann and Nancy Wilson were a lot closer than sisters should be. The Wilson Sisters were not amused to discover their own management and record company had deliberately spread the rumour to drum up interest and publicity.
-   Mystery Jets' "MJ" (off **Twenty One**) is most commonly interpreted as this (it's one of the more straightforward interpretations of the lyrics, and supported by Word of God), though it's ambiguous enough to be interpreted as any other kind of Forbidden Love (Teacher/Student Romance is a common alternate interpretation, and Maligned Mixed Marriage could also fit).
-   In Randy Newman's "Naked Man," the titular Naked Man implies that this is the cause of his misdeeds.
    
    He said, "They found out about my sister/Kicked me out of the Navy/They would have strung me up if they could/I tried to explain that we were both of us lazy/And doing the best we could."

Brother–Sister Incest Example in Myths & Religion

-   In Beti-Pahuin Mythology the pygmy Bela Mindzi committed incest with her brother. The resulting child from their liason became the supreme leader of Engong, Akoma Mba.
-   In the Finnish national epic, **The Kalevala**:
    -   Kullervo sleeps with a maiden which he doesn't know to really be his sister. In the end they both commit suicide. (This later inspired J. R. R. Tolkien's story of Túrin Turambar laid out in **The Silmarillion** and **The Children of Húrin**.)
    -   Also **märkäkorva lappalainen** (wet-behind-the-ears Lapp) who has humped, not only his mother and sister, also all the mares in his household. Lemminkäinen finds him so disgusting he doesn't bother to kill him.
-   Arthurian Legend:
    -   In many versions, Morgause is Arthur's half-sister. Their son and nephew, Mordred, eventually destroys Arthur's kingdom.
    -   The Questing Beast was said to be born from a princess who lusted after her brother, and slept with a demon who promised to make him love her back. Instead the demon made her hate her brother, and when she became pregnant she accused him of raping her, prompting her father to execute him. Before he died the prince said that if he was innocent, it would be proved by his sister giving birth to a monster.
-   Classical Mythology: Byblis falls in love with her brother Caunus, and defends their relationship by pointing out how many immortals have had incestuous relationships. Their story was later retold by Ovid.
-   Hindu Mythology: Averted in the **Rigveda**. Twins Yami and Yama are the first created mortals, and Yami attempts to seduce Yama so they may continue the human race. Yama refuses on the grounds that she's his sister so that's just wrong.
-   Alchemy has many incest symbols, especially the **hierosgamos** or **coniunctio** ("sacred marriage" or "union"), a chemical wedding of male and female, brother and sister. The rebus is often shown as an incestuous brother and sister, portrayed as a union of Sol and Luna, sun and moon.
-   The Bible:
    -   Adam and Eve. Since humanity is still young and vital, it's a case of incest until more careful selection is possible or even necessary. Eve was made from Adam's rib, so unless God worked some additional magic, they were brother/sister in a cloning sense.
    -   Adam's and Eve's children by the more literal readings could only have had other family members to mate with but its never said explicitly. Cain's wife who is arguably the 5th human mentioned but comes from nowhere. After Cain killed Abel, he went into exile away from his family, but he went on to marry the unnamed lady. The fifth chapter states Adam and Eve had other sons and daughters, so she could've been one of them. Alternatively, some think the implication is that there were other people created other than Adam and Eve, and they were just the first.
    -   The punitive Great Flood leaves only four married couples alive — three of the men are brothers, and the fourth couple are **their parents**. The following children would have no one to marry but their cousins or siblings. As Genesis also claims that people lived an average of 400 years back in those days, the much shorter lifespans following the Flood can be taken as a result of that tragically narrowed gene pool. This is all consistent with the Bible's theme of various cataclysms as a consequence of man's pride leading to repeated falls.
        -   Not only for humans. Aside from bringing seven pairs of a few species designated acceptable for sacrifice (and any domesticated animals the family might have had), the Biblical account puts "everything that has the breath of life in it" — i.e. **every air-breathing animal on the planet** through the same genetic bottleneck.
    -   In Genesis 20:12, Abraham says that his wife Sarah is his half-sister, the daughter of his father. There is some controversy about this; some Jewish sources, such as Rashi, note that since at one point Abraham calls his nephew Lot his "brother," Sarah may have been another name for Abraham's niece Icsah. Uncle/niece marriages are considered valid under Biblical law.
    -   King David's oldest son, Amnon, lusted after his virgin half (?) sister, Tamar, so badly that he pretended to be ill so that Tamar would come to his room to feed him. He then raped her over all of her protests (and it being a gigantic no-no in Jewish law). Their other brother Absalom didn't take it kindly. Some try to argue they were Not Blood Siblings. The interesting part is where she pleads with him to talk to their father about it with the assumption that David would approve the marriage. Now it's very possible that she was just trying to put him off but it can be assumed that she wouldn't have made the plea if it was completely implausible. Maybe the taboo of being an unmarried, deflowered woman was a greater stigma than being married to a half-brother.
    -   Other than the story of Amnon and Tamar, however, all of these incidents took place before the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy, which specifically outlawed these practices, were written. The very word "incest" is a term that has been retro-actively applied, coming as it does from Latin, the language of ancient (yet still much younger than Israel) Rome. Though there are indications that the Law was already known to some extent before Moses wrote it down (e.g., Noah knew which animals were clean before Leviticus 11 was written).
-   In Zoroastrianism there is a concept known as xwēdōdah, or the holy union of father and daughter/mother and son/brother and sister. It was and still is considered by the religion as the most pious acts one can perform as a Zoroastrian for reasons that are far too complicated to explain in a simple entry. However, since nothing in the religion requires it and most people simply don't want to marry someone in their family, it very rarely happened outside of royalty.
-   **The Pearl of Great Price** is one of the four standard works in LDS (Mormon) canon scripture. It says that the sons and daughters of Adam and Eve began to "divide two and two in the land ... and they also begat sons and daughters" meaning it's explicitly Mormon doctrine that everyone is a product of sibling incest. While this neatly explains where Cain's wife came from (she was his sister) it...brings up other issues.
-   Celtic Mythology (specifically the Mabinogion's fourth branch) provides a weird example: Math fab Mathonwy had a virgin servant named Goewin. His nephew Gilfaethwy rapes her with some help from his brother, Gwydion. When Math finds out he marries Goewin and then punishes his nephews by turning them into breeding pairs of animals (first deer, then boars, then wolves). They produce one child from each transformation, which are adopted by Math after he turns them human.

-   Discussed in **Fat, French and Fabulous**: This may have been the case between the Papin sisters, who suffered from shared psychosis.

Brother–Sister Incest Example in Professional Wrestling

-   Mark Henry claimed during a sex therapy session that he lost his virginity to his sister when he was 8 years old and that he had just had sex with her 2 days ago.
-   Vince McMahon of World Wrestling Entertainment has been trying to do an incest storyline going all the way back to 1999, when Ken Shamrock was supposed to be in love with his Kayfabe sister (Shamrock refused). The Mark Henry case apparently didn't satisfy him so Vince tried to have an incest storyline between himself and his real-life daughter, Stephanie (she refused); he countered by replacing himself with his son Shane (both of them refused). He finally got his incest storyline between Paul Burchill and his Kayfabe sister Katie Lea, although it never got past Incest Subtext. Note that his inability to get an incest story actually going didn't prevent him from alluding to such things.
-   Vince Russo planned on doing this as a plot element to the Stacy Keibler pregnancy angle. She was seeing David Flair in the storyline, and was his fiance, so Russo planned to reveal that Stacy was Ric Flair's illegitimate daughter. Fortunately, WCW went out of business before this angle could come to fruition.

Brother–Sister Incest Example in Roleplay

-   In **The Gamer's Alliance**, Desdemona and Mordecai are siblings and very much in love although they have to hide their relationship from everyone else. Desdemona eventually gets pregnant with Mordecai's child and intends to give birth to the child, using it as a means to install herself on the Remonian throne by claiming that the child belongs to King Marcus.
-   This has cropped up in **Survival of the Fittest** a couple of times (although in one case this was Twincest). Matthias Kovalenko of V2 was **scarily** obsessed with his sister Jodeen. (fortunately, she never made it onto the island). Nothing explicit ever occurs, but from Matthias' thoughts, most get the impression it isn't just brotherly concern.

Brother–Sister Incest Example in Tabletop Games

-   In **Anima: Beyond Fantasy**. Alystaire Fardelys is deeply in love with her brother Joshua Fardelys, ruler of the nation of Gabriel, even if she knows that can go nowhere to the point of her having killed the latter's fiancé.
-   Handled kind of weirdly in the **BattleTech** canon.
    -   Clan warriors are largely trueborn, which is to say genetically engineered to be Super Soldiers and born in canisters, then raised in large groups called sibkos. Members of a trueborn sibko are usually related on a genetic level, all of them sharing the same genetic mother and father, but since the concept of the nuclear family is abhorrent to the Clans, they see no qualms with sexual activity happening within the sibkos, viewing it merely as a form of stress relief because Clan trueborn women have their reproductive cycle turned off. Inner Sphere citizens find such information disquieting at the very least. However, at least one major player of the post-Clan invasion storylines is the product of two directly related sibko members having a baby—Diana, daughter of Aidan and Peri from the Pryde sibko in the "Legend of the Jade Phoenix" series.
    -   Later, it turns out that Danai Liao-Centrella is the product of this. She thought she was the third child of Sun-Tzu Liao, when she is really the daughter Daoshen Liao and Ilsa Centrella, Sun Tzu's two actual children. She had thought they were her brother and sister and instead they turn out to be her mother and father.
    -   Alaric Wolf is an indirect example thanks to a combination of the Clan eugenics program removing personal interaction from the picture and his genetic mother's **serious** issues with, well, everything and everyone. He's genetically bred from Katherine Steiner-Davion's DNA and that of her older brother, Victor Steiner-Davion. This also means he's a result of Royal Inbreeding as the Steiner-Davion line were once the rulers of the largest realm in the Inner Sphere.
-   In **Deadlands**, the Whateley family tree seems to drop nothing but bad apples. Part of the reason for this is the "selective breeding" instituted by the clan's otherworldly patron. Most of the residents of Gomorra, California can't figure out exactly what the relationship is between Nicodemus and Delores Whateley. Some think they're siblings. Some think they're married. Both are right. Squick. (Bonus prize: reading the Whateley Family Bible, complete with a family tree in the front, has driven some folks insane.)
-   **Dungeons & Dragons**
    -   In the Ravenloft supplement **Dark Tales & Disturbing Legends**, a highborn woman magically transforms herself into the guise of her brother's bride so he won't "pollute" their bloodline with a commoner wife. This being Ravenloft, the brother has his own twisted plans, so her deceit comes back to bite her.
    -   In the Edition 3.5 manual **Exemplars Of Evil**, among the featured villains are the Tolstoff siblings, Edgar (an insane cancer mage) and Katharin (a seductive enchantress), who serve an Eldritch Abomination known as Kyuss and, more concretely, their Sealed Evil in a Can grandfather who promised them to protect their forbidden love if they could help him out of his confinement. Their desperate love for each other would make them pitiable and somewhat sympathetic, if it weren't for the extremes they are willing to sink to.
    -   In later versions, the principal draconic deities are Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her brother Bahamut. Tiamat is the goddess of evil dragons and Bahamut is the god of good dragons. They are fierce enemies, but Tiamat's hatred for her brother has developed into a depraved lust over the thousands of years they've been fighting. The feeling isn't mutual, however.
    -   In the Eberron campain setting the god known as the Devourer raped his sister Arawai resulting in the birth of the goddess known as the Fury.
-   **Hollow Earth Expedition** supplement **Mysteries of the Hollow Earth**. In the city of El Dorado, the royal family are all descended from the Sun God. It is common for brothers and sisters to marry each other and have children to preserve their bloodline.
-   **Warhammer**. Sigvald the Magnificent, a Pretty Boy champion of Slaanesh, was born from a depraved Norscan chief turning his attentions towards his own sister. His life has only followed the trend set by his father, though he far exceeds him — his old man wanted to exile him from the tribe because, to the old man's disgust, Sigvald enjoys the taste of human flesh, and has only committed worse and worse atrocities after Slaanesh made him hir champion. There's a reason the fandom refers to him as "Joffrey all grown up".

Brother–Sister Incest Example in Theatre

-   This was a major theme in "revenge tragedies" of the 1600s, which basically aimed to contain as much violence and as many illicit relationships as they could.
    -   In **The Duchess of Malfi** for example, Duke Ferdinand has obsessive subconscious feelings for his sister, the titular character, which he never fully realizes and eventually drive him insane. Cheerful stuff.
    -   **The Courier's Tragedy**—a fictional "ill, ill Jacobean revenge play" featured in Thomas Pynchon's **The Crying of Lot 49**—has a fair amount of this among the villains.
    -   Subverted in **A King and No King**, where Arbaces **thinks** he wants to seduce the sister he hasn't seen since childhood, blames the regent he left behind to protect her for this, decides to murder the regent then seduce his sister then kill himself — but then it turns out she wasn't ever his sister after all (through a typically Jacobean complex reveal), so it's okay if they marry.
    -   **'Tis Pity She's a Whore** (another 1600s drama) Annabella and Giovanni, not having seen one another since they were young, fight their attraction and seem to have a good deal of wangst over it for a while... but bang by the end of the first act. John Ford (author of **Tis Pity**) seems to have been mildly fascinated with the concept: in **The Broken Heart**, Ithocles forcibly marries his sister Penthea to the insanely jealous Bassanes, who soon suspects her of cheating on him with **everyone**, including, eventually, Ithocles himself. They're not doing it, (any more than Ophelia and Laertes, jeez...) but Ithocles IS very controlling of Penthea's sexuality...
-   **August: Osage County** has this as part of its Surprise Incest ending. Little Charles and Ivy, who were already Kissing Cousins, are revealed to be half-siblings.
-   In **Bat Boy: The Musical**, this trope plays a major role when it is revealed that Edgar and Shelley, who have just confessed their love for each other and had sex, are fraternal twins.
-   In the Australian play **The Club**, Geoff reveals to a member of his team's committee that he slept with his double-amputee sister and then his mother, resulting in his father shooting himself immediately afterward. The squick is **slightly** reduced by the reveal that this story was a complete lie, in spite of being partly shown in a fake flashback.
-   In Sam Shepard's **Fool for Love**, the main characters are on-again/off-again lovers who are ultimately revealed to be half-siblings.
-   Tom and Laura seem a bit too into each other in **The Glass Menagerie**. And then later Jim implies he sees Laura as a sister...then slow dances with and kisses her. The revival especially hinted at this, which is openly mocked here.
-   Some interpretations of **Hamlet** will portray Ophelia and Laertes as either: A) lusting after one another, or B) already sleeping with one another. This is mostly common in psychoanalytic interpretations of the play, which also portray Hamlet as being hostile to his father and attracted to his mother.
-   Lawrence and Joanna Brown in Lanford Wilson's one act play **Home Free**. The fact that they're incestuous siblings is actually one of the less worrisome things about their relationship.
-   In Lord Byron's **Manfred** the title character strongly implies that his "nameless" crime was incest with his beloved Astarte. His **Cain** focuses on the hero's love for his sister/wife and his incredulity that though Jehovah has tolerated incest among mankind's second generation, his own children are forbidden to marry each other. Originally the protagonists in "The Bride of Abydis" were a brother and sister in love but were changed to first cousins in the final version.
-   The play **Minach** by Iva Volankova, the first act is about a sibling pair wherein Brother (they're not named) has been romantically/sexually obsessed with Sister since childhood, to the point where it is implied he killed their parents for trying to stop him sleeping with her, and is angry and bitter at Sister for refusing him. For her part, she realizes this isn't healthy but also seems to think she's been ruined for all other men by it. At one point she breaks down, he starts kissing her and carries her into the bathroom for implied offstage sex.
-   The Audience Participation voting at the end of **The Mystery Of Edwin Drood** includes pairing a male and female character together as lovers. Two of the possible choices are siblings.
-   The 1779 German play **Nathan der Weise** ("Nathan the Wise Man") by Lessing features a crusader who falls for Nathan's adopted daughter at first sight. In the end it turns out she is his sister and they were separated at birth.
-   **Der Ring des Nibelungen**:
    -   Pre-television example: Richard Wagner's opera **Die Walküre** ("The Valkyrie", premiered in 1870), second of four operas in his Ring Cycle, involving siblings Siegmund and Sieglinde. Siegfried, the hero of the third and fourth operas in the cycle, is their child. This case is perhaps different from both the anime versions as well as most western versions. Though their love does end in tragedy, the tragedy is due to the fact that Sieglinde is already married to someone else, and not particularly associated with the fact that the Siegmund-Sieglinde relationship is incestuous.
    -   Another example of incest is the relationship of Siegfried and Brünnhilde, since Brünnhilde is Wotan's daughter (by Erda) and thus Siegfried's aunt by blood. But that's the beauty of Grand Opera: you can do anything, so long as you **sing** it!
-   In the Stephen Sondheim musical **Road Show**, the subtext between Addison and Wilson Mizner just barely manages to remain "sub". Sharing a sleeping bag in the middle of an Alaska blizzard? Well, it's cold out there (though that doesn't explain the snuggling). Singing about "Brotherly Love" while in said sleeping bag? That's **perfectly innocent** and only the most dirty-minded spectator would read anything sexual into it. But when Wilson says in the middle of a fight with Addison "How about a farewell kiss from your brother?" and tries to kiss him on the mouth... and when he seems distinctly jealous of Addison's boyfriend... and when the climax of the show turns on Addison telling Wilson to get out of his life because he's ruined everything, to which Wilson nonchalantly responds "You don't want me to go. You love me." and Addison bursts out: "All right! I love you! Does that make us even?"... well, you know what they say: it's only subtext if it's subtle.
-   in **Veronica's Room** Veronica had a sexual relationship with her younger brother which lead to her murdering her other sibling when it was discovered. The two continued the relationship into adulthood where they had a son, named Boy.
-   In Andrew Lippa's **The Wild Party**, Oscar and Phil d'Armano are explicitly described in the script as being "both brothers and lovers."

Brother–Sister Incest Example in Web Animation

-   Fortunately averted in **Broken Saints**: Shandala and Gabriel look like they might be bonding romantically prior to Tui Jr's death, but it is cut mercifully short. This is especially creepy when you realize Gabriel **knows** Shandala is his sister.
-   **Etra chan saw it!**:
-   **ETU - Animated Stories**: One story has Sarah be attracted to her brother Scott, much to his discomfort. She was jealous of Eliza, his girlfriend and tried to get them to break up. She even kissed Scott, pretending to be Eliza, but Eliza posted a video of her doing so and she was kicked out of the house by her parents.
-   **Helluva Boss**: Present with alternate personas, but not the actual characters. When married couple Moxxie and Millie have to infiltrate a camp to find an assassin target, they disguise themselves as siblings. They get in a fight over the episode and make up on a crowded stage, then get caught up in the moment and start having sex right in front of a large audience while still in disguise. This detonates the popularity Millie had been gathering as "Millerd" over the week, going from a popular online celebrity to being known as the boy who made out with his sister.
-   **Lilium -Sims 2** is a **Sims 2** machinima that revolves around a rich, isolated family circa 1900. Isis is attracted to her (possibly twin) brother Horitio. Their father doesn't like this so he has them meet the set of siblings he had paired them up with as children. Horitio is both in love with Isis and Estella, while Isis has no feelings for Baltazar and only wants Horitio. The siblings end up marrying their arranged spouses, but only one of the couples is happy.

Brother–Sister Incest Example in Web Original

-   The story "Becka the Beast" (NSFW) is about Gia Cameron, a karate black-belt who falls in love with gay school bully Becka Jackson. It's quickly revealed that Becka is the victim of Parental Incest, coupled with a relationship with a Depraved Bisexual that has left her an empty shell. Gia's father adopts Becka in the end.
-   In the **Chakona Space** setting, there are a number of examples of this (as well as some Parental Incest) between members of various genetically-engineered species such as chakats and foxtaurs. Hermaphrodite chakat sisters Forestwalker and Goldfur enjoy recreational sex, and foxtaur brother and sister Garrek and Malena are also mated (this is hand waved with the explanation that they have been genetically engineered to eliminate the sorts of diseases and conditions that inbreeding can produce in humans, and as created species do not share the exact same moral squick factors as their creators). Granted, Chakats and most other species still have taboos against **inbreeding** so Goldfur and Forestwalker are careful not to have sex when either one is in heat. Foxtaurs allow one generation of inbreeding because most of them can't leave their isolated Amish-style villages thanks to Territorial Attachment Syndrome, and a shortage of males.

Brother–Sister Incest Example in Web Videos

-   In supernatural web soap **California Heaven**, an episode features brother and sister, Dominic and KC, in a very seductive dance nearly kissing. Thought, it looks like KC was possessed. However, in a later episode, Dominic stares at KC as she is sleeping and she seems to have no problem with it.
-   In **Comix From The Underground**, the Comix Scrutinizer suggests that the furry webcomic characters Kit n Kay Boodle are participating in this since they're not married and have the same last name.
-   This was to have been a plot point in The Nostalgia Chick's video "Thanks for the Feedback" detailing a date between Chick and the Critic. In the original draft, they would have slept together and then been informed that they were actually brother and sister. This idea was scrapped prior to filming.
-   Implied in **Spooning With Spoony III**, when Spoony fucks both The Nostalgia Critic and The Other Guy (along with plenty of other people) and tells the latter he makes noises just like his brother.
-   In the **Philosophy Tube**\-video "Jordan Peterson's Ideology", Adelaide (a Straw Character meant to represent TERFs and ostensible progressives who are really more concerned with not having to change anything or be inconvenienced in any way than with really helping people, and will be actively unhelpful if threatened) is very obviously in love with Ivan (another Straw Character meant to represent fascism and far-right extremism), her brother. At the end of the video, Adelaide lights Ivan's cigarette for him, before they start **passionately** making out.
-   The Huggbees parody of the Outside in video devolves into this about halfway through as the two narrators argue throughout.
