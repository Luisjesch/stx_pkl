Betrayal Tropes: 
_"Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!"_

How characters betray each other's trust. Usually a Plot Twist of some kind, except when it isn't.

Contrast with A Trusting Index and Loyalty Tropes. Victims of betrayal are often motivated to seek retribution against the traitor through any type of Revenge Tropes.

**Of course, beware of spoilers in these tropes.**
