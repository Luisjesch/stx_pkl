CatDog Dichotomy: 
_A lunatic dog and a frustrated cat  
Opposite this and opposite that!_

_Why must I be like that?  
Why must I chase the cat?  
Ain't nothing but the dog in me_!

Using cats and dogs to represent Foils or Evil Counterparts (i.e. Heroes Love Dogs and Right-Hand Cat, Heroic Dog and Cats Are Mean, or Dogs Are Dumb and Cats Are Superior, inversions include Beware of Vicious Dog/Mister Muffykins and Cute Kitten/Buffoonish Tomcat, or Savage Wolves and King of Beasts).

A subtrope of Animal Jingoism and a Super-Trope to Heroic Canines, Villainous Felines; Canines Primary, Felines Secondary; Female Feline, Male Mutt.
