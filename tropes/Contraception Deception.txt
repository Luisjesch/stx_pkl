Contraception Deception: 
_Her husband made it clear he wanted a big family. He wanted lots and lots of kids to inoculate himself against loss and Claire had tried and tried with him until she had agreed to go see a fertility expert who had informed Claire that she couldn't have children because she had an IUD and was taking birth control pills._

Ideally, partners in a sexual relationship are in agreement over whether or not they're willing to have a child together.

This doesn't always happen.

Contraception Deception is when one partner lies about their reproductive status in order to have sex with the other partner. It comes in three varieties:

-   **Claiming Sterility**: One partner insists that there's no need for contraception because they're unable to impregnate or be impregnated. A male might claim he's had a vasectomy or suffered some illness/injury (such as testicular cancer) that left him capable of sex but sterile. A female could claim to have gotten a tubal ligation or hysterectomy, or simply say she's on a contraceptive implant or the pill. Either way, the other partner freely engages in what should be consequence-free sex — no kid can result, it's just for fun. And then the woman's pregnancy test is positive. Depending on the exact setup, this can result in The Baby Trap.
-   **Claiming Fertility**: One partner wants a child, the other doesn't but for some reason can't just tell the other one so. Instead, the no-child partner continues having sex but takes private precautions to ensure no child results. A man might come up with an excuse to "go out of town for a few days" but instead use that time to get a vasectomy. The woman might find someplace she can hide a stash of birth control pills from her partner.
-   **Sabotaging Contraception**: The partner who wants a child takes an active role in ensuring his/her partner's contraception fails. The classic example is poking holes in a condom, though most condom failures are obvious enough that the guy really _should_ notice. If the male is the one wanting children, he can either slip the woman something that interferes with hormonal birth control or steal her pills (possibly replacing them with placebos). <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  This is another way to set up The Baby Trap. It's also a way to establish the saboteur as a jerkass, and in Real Life is one way domestic abusers maintain control over their victims. Another scenario is slipping off the condom partway through intercourse, though this is usually done more to increase sexual pleasure, rather than to purposely try to get their partner pregnant. If the woman is the one sabotaging the contraception, an even squickier method may be to inseminate herself with the contents of the used condom.

For any form of this trope to be in play, there has to be active deception (or sabotage) involved. Honest mistakes do not count.

Don't Try This at Home. Lying about using contraception and then having sex with someone who would not otherwise consent to have sex is considered rape-by-fraud in some jurisdictions. Besides the legal matters, conning someone into having a child they don't want or aren't ready for can seriously screw up both their lives and that of the resulting child. In real life, people thrust into parenthood against their will don't always transform into loving and competent parents the way they do in fiction. Even if they don't become outright abusive, they may end up just going through the motions, trying to emulate what is expected of them but failing to meet the child's emotional needs while their own mental health deteriorates. See also The Baby Trap.

One character who might do this is the Stalker with a Test Tube. Subtrope of Surprise Pregnancy. Compare But We Used a Condom! when safe sex practices simply fail, and But I Can't Be Pregnant! when the woman was thought to be infertile. And A Mistake Is Born, if a child was born as the result of said deception. See also Fake Pregnancy, in which a female character _isn't_ pregnant but claims to be.

Contraception Deception Example in Films — Live-Action

-   Discussed in the film **Conspiracy**; when one Nazi official mentions that Jews and other undesirables could be sterilized instead of killed outright, another official mentions that they themselves could get a (false) certificate that they too have been sterilized, in the event of future sexual encounters.
-   In **Educating Rita**, Rita's husband Denny wants to start a family, but she wants to wait while she finishes a degree. He already doesn't understand why she wants to do that, so she takes the pill in secret while pretending to try to conceive. When he finds her stash, he burns her books and they break up soon after.
-   In **The Invisible Man (2020)**, Cecelia confesses that she had been secretly taking birth control pills without telling her husband Adrian because she knew if they had a child, then she would never be able to leave him. However, Adrian's brother Tom tells her that Adrian found out about her deception and swapped her birth control pills for "something else". Late in the film, Cecelia learns that she is pregnant.
-   In **Lakeview Terrace**, the wife Lisa gets pregnant even though she and her husband Chris had agreed to wait, especially when they're dealing with a psycho cop neighbor. Chris is not happy about this, and it turns out she had stopped taking her birth control pills. She claims she forgot, but it's pretty clear she was getting fed up with waiting and probably did it on purpose. They ultimately decide to have the child.
-   In **Parenthood**, Susan pokes holes in her diaphragms to get pregnant.
-   In **The Skeleton Twins**, Maggie is secretly taking birth control pills to prevent having a child with her husband Lance to the point where he thinks he's infertile. He finds out about the pills — and her infidelity — later on.
-   In **Your Sister's Sister**, Jack and Hannah (who is a lesbian) get drunk and sleep together. Later, Hannah's sister Iris brings up in conversation that Hannah wants a child.

Contraception Deception Example in Literature

-   In **365 Days**, Massimo pulls off **both** variations. First, he implants birth control into Laura's arm without her permission or knowledge. Then it turns out he lied about this and it was a **tracker** he had implanted; he actually **wants** to get Laura pregnant so she will be more inclined to stay with him. He's the love interest, by the way.
-   **The Duke and I**, first novel of **The Bridgerton Series**, plays both Type 1 and Type 3 with a side of Miss Conception. The series is set in Regency England, and it's a plot point that romantic lead Daphne Bridgerton **does not** know how babies are made — especially as her mother Violet botches The Talk quite badly. Thus, when Daphne's new husband, Simon Basset, Duke of Hastings — who refuses to have children to spite his late father — uses what The Other Wiki calls coitus interruptus, she doesn't understand the significance. Once she does, she engages in a Type 3 Baby Trap by seducing him while he's too drunk to protest — or control himself. This is, by any legal definition, sexual assault, and the novel attracted some controversy for not addressing the Double Standard Rape: Female on Male. (Imagine how we'd treat the situation if it were Gender Flipped.)
-   **The Casual Vacancy** (as well as its TV series adaptation): Krystal Weedon is trying to get pregnant as a teen mother to qualify for government housing (because she intends to take her baby brother along). Thus she dissuades Fats Walls, her boyfriend, from using condoms by lying that she is already on contraceptive pills.
-   **Earth's Children**
    -   In **The Clan of the Cave Bear**, Iza, a medicine woman, would secretly prepare and drink a contraceptive herbal tea to stick it to her abusive mate, as he felt humiliated by the fact he hadn't fathered any sons. She did eventually get pregnant as the tea isn't 100% reliable, but her mate died before the baby was born **and** she gave birth to a girl.
    -   Ayla secretly provides Ovra with the contraceptive tea Iza told her about, as Ovra will probably never have a living child, and the physical and emotional toll of the multiple pregnancies, miscarriages, and stillbirths she goes through could end up killing her one day.
    -   Ayla herself starts taking the contraceptive tea without telling her lover Jondalar in **The Plains of Passage**; they both want children but as they're in the middle of a long and dangerous journey to Jondalar's homeland a pregnancy would be far from ideal. She does consider telling him but doesn't get around to it, as Iza had ingrained in her not to tell men about the tea as some may react badly to finding out women can control their fertility. It doesn't help that most people in the setting don't understand how pregnancy occurs, namely not realizing that sexual intercourse is a big component; Ayla figures it out and tells Jondalar of her theories, but he's a bit skeptical. Jondalar privately worries over the fact Ayla hasn't gotten pregnant yet, believing there may be something wrong with him (as he knows Ayla has previously given birth) although a shaman he confides in suggests that the Great Mother knows they're not yet ready for a baby. After the most difficult part of their journey is over, Ayla impulsively decides not to drink the tea and quickly gets pregnant.
-   In **Headhunters**, Clas Greve enlists Diana Brown's help in killing her husband Roger by promising to give her a child, the one thing Roger has consistently denied her. Clas neglects to mention that he happens to be sterile, the result of a grievous testicular injury he received years earlier, and thus would never be able to impregnate her.
-   In **Kris Longknife: Unrelenting**, Kris and about 70 other women under her command have Surprise Pregnancies because a disgruntled supply noncom sabotaged their contraceptive implants. This was meant as a protest against Kris relaxing fraternization regulations for practical reasons and ends with the petty officer being summarily discharged and sentenced to hard labor in the manure works. Kris and her husband decide to keep the baby.
-   In **The Lady of the English** by Elizabeth Chadwick, Queen Matilda secretly uses a crude counterpart of modern contraceptive sponges, as she doesn't want to have a child with her second husband Geoffrey (with whom she has a very stormy Dating Catwoman relationship). Since securing an heir is one of the main reasons for the marriage, Geoffrey is furious when he accidentally finds out.
-   In **Pretty Girls**, Claire lies to Paul that she wants children (which he does), but she continues taking birth control, because of her Freudian Excuse of losing her older sister Julia when she was a kid and Julia was a teenager. This turns out to be Laser-Guided Karma, though, for Paul, who created videos of himself raping, torturing, and killing kidnapped girls, and there's a pretty strong implication that he wanted kids to abuse.
    
    Her husband made it clear he wanted a big family. He wanted lots and lots of kids to inoculate himself against loss and Claire had tried and tried with him until she had agreed to go see a fertility expert who had informed Claire that she couldn't have children because she had an IUD and was taking birth control pills.
    
-   **A Company of Stars**, the first **Starship Troupers** novel by Christopher Stasheff, opens with the narrator escaping a Shotgun Wedding, and he notes that while he doesn't know **exactly** what the girl he was with did, the setting has so many types of contraceptive pill that it is **literally impossible** to get pregnant by accident, and she must have taken something that counteracted **his** pill.

Then Bates finds a diaphragm in Anna's stuff, leading him to believe that she is sabotaging their attempts to have children. It turns out that she is not; the diaphragm is for her employer Lady Mary, who is sleeping with Anthony Gillingham but doesn't want any extra-marital children.
-   In **Gilmore Girls**, when Sookie is in the hospital giving birth to her second child with Jackson, she demands he have a vasectomy on the spot. Later in the series, it turns out he lied about getting it.

-   **The Good Wife**: Sleazy rich guy Colin Sweeney is sued for child support by an ex-mistress claiming he got her pregnant. He insists to his attorneys at Lockhart and Gardner that he always used condoms with her, but after a paternity test comes back positive, family law specialist David Lee theorizes that she impregnated herself with a used condom.

Bill admits that it could be him as he lies to every woman he sleeps with that he had a vasectomy simply because he doesn't like wearing condoms. While Bill finds it hilarious, it causes Mac and Charlie to stare at him in utter disgust.
-   There was a **House** episode where the illness turned out to be caused by taking fertility treatments and birth control pills at the same time. Turns out that the woman was married to a man who really wanted kids, but she didn't and was unwilling to admit it to him. She went through the whole process of actively trying to get pregnant, while secretly sabotaging it, reasoning that he'd be more likely to accept infertility than a wife who just didn't want more children.

-   In one episode of **Married... with Children**, Al and Peg are trying for another child, because the first child born in the family would inherit a lot of money from a relative. Only Peg does not want to get pregnant again, so she is taking birth control in secret (telling Al that these pills are to **improve** her fertility) and enjoying much more sex than usual. Eventually, her deception comes to light and at the same time, another family member appears with a newborn baby that would get the money, so they can stop trying.
-   **My Name Is Earl** had an example where the deceiver is not one of the two who have sex. (Good thing since he's underage at the time.)

This one is botched, and Jordan gets pregnant again next season.

As such, Abby's revenge features her dosing Mayhew with her prototype youth serum and not giving him the antidote until he's a toddler and due to become a baby in the next few seconds, making Mayhew into the child she always wanted.

-   For a variant in **Joyce and Walky!** it's the **mother** of the woman who pokes holes in her future son-in-law's condoms, because she's **that** desperate for grandchildren.
