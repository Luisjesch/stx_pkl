Bloody Hallucinations of Guilt: 
A character cannot help but see blood on things where there is none because they feel responsible for the death of someone: they committed murder, they knowingly allowed someone to die, they tried to save a person and failed, etc.

The most common form of this trope is for the character to hallucinate blood on their hands. This comes from the saying common in English (and some other languages) "their blood is on your hands," used to tell someone that another's death is their fault. The blood of the dead and the subsequent responsibility and guilt for killing them/getting them killed is metaphorically likened to the victim's blood staining their hands. Note that there's a difference between metaphorically feeling like there's blood on your hands and actually hallucinating that there is blood on your hands; the former falls under These Hands Have Killed, though it's not uncommon for a character who simply started with just the feeling ending up with full-blown hallucinations over time.

But this has been played with numerous times over, with the amount and source of blood often reflective of the particular death the character feels guilty for. A Shell-Shocked Veteran who was Just Following Orders and participated in a genocide may hallucinate Rivers of Blood in the street or see normal people as Blood-Splattered Innocents. A murderer who buried the body in their backyard may hallucinate blood coming up from the soil. A character who accidentally killed a child may hallucinate Tears of Blood coming from the eyes of stuffed animals. And so on...

However it manifests, it's all the character's guilty conscience drudging up these images to make sure this character can never forget the death(s) they're responsible for.

A Sub-Trope of Bloody Horror and Hallucinations. Compare Guilt-Induced Nightmare, Hearing Voices, and its subtrope, Terrible Ticking, for when a sound only the character can hear drives them mad. Often preceded by My God, What Have I Done? and followed by Scrubbing Off the Trauma. Frequently a sign of Sanity Slippage and can overlap with Murder Makes You Crazy and Through the Eyes of Madness. If a character's guilt manifests in an apparition of the deceased, that's Haunting the Guilty.

One particular incident involved some kids running up to her as her fans and when she held her hand out to them, her guilty conscience hallucinated that it was drenched in the blood of those she killed, causing her to quickly recoil in shock. From then on, Nagant became increasingly disillusioned with her work for the Commission, culminating in her assassinating the President when he made a threat against her if she tried to walk away, resulting in her imprisonment in Tartarus after being falsely accused of killing another Hero.

Bloody Hallucinations of Guilt Example in Fan Works

-   In **Fallout: Equestria**, main character Littlepip discovers that the town of Arbu has been killing caravaneers, travelers, and bandits so they can eat them, even feeding them to their children. Littlepip and her group of adventurers had "dinner" with the citizens before she discovered this. The revelation is so sickening and horrifying that she breaks down and murders every pony in the village bearing a 'mark of Arbu' (which signifies they've killed and consumed a victim) — in the chaos, she might have inadvertently or purposefully killed a child as well. Afterwards, however, she's sickened and horrified with herself and how far she went, unable to see herself as anything but a monster covered in blood.
-   In **Foal**, whenever Rainbow Dash thinks about her responsibility for her brother's death, she hallucinates that his blood is on her hooves and can't wash it off.
