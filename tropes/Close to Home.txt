_"One of the things you learn in training is to avoid situations that cut too close. If you had a rough childhood, a situation with an abusive father and a vulnerable kid is gonna make you angry. That could be motivating. But it can also be dangerous."_

Detective Bob is working on a murder case. He brings in one suspect for interrogation, a rather obnoxious fellow named Charlie. During the interrogation, Charlie begins making comments about beating up geeks, jamming them in lockers, and various other stereotypical bully things.

For Bob, this starts to hit home for him, because when he was in high school, he was bullied by folks like Charlie, and they always got away with it. Bob begins to let his emotions about Charlie begin to affect his judgment, and suddenly starts being much more abusive (either verbally or physically) toward ol' Charlie.

Of course, this is just one type of scenario. Basically, this trope occurs when Bob encounters events similar to something he's gone through before, and his emotions about their original encounter(s) begin to cloud and/or affect his judgment.

Compare It's Personal. Some particularly devious villains may invoke this when arrested and interrogated to sow suspicion among the heroes. Also see More Insulting than Intended, Berserk Button and Trauma Button.

Not the be confused with the one-panel Newspaper Comic.

-   In **Fate/Zero**, Kirei Kotomine severely struggles with an inability to feel love and happiness and only being able to revel in pain and evil.

-   In **Fate/Apocrypha**, due to being abandoned as a child and making it her life mission to create a world where all children are loved, Atalanta is unprepared deal with Jack the Ripper, who in this incarnation is a child, or more specifically, a collection of spirits of deceased children.

    -   A few episodes later, Batou has one when it's revealed that a murderous psychopath has shown up in the city. Marco Amoretti was skinning his victims' torsos in a t-shirt like pattern and leaving them to die- a tactic he learned from a secret military operation designed to make the enemy lose the will to fight that Batou stumbled upon in the last war.

-   Due to the fact The Punisher's origin revolves around the death of his family (especially his two young children) if he sees a child being harmed or at risk he tends to flashback to the day of his family's death. Then things go horribly, horribly wrong for the abusive party.

-   There's a story in **Tangled: The Series** where Rapunzel has to deal with someone using a magical being's power for their own ends, and another where someone has enslaved an entire kingdom against their will or knowledge. In neither occasion does she take it well.

-   Any case in **Burn Notice** that involves kids with an abusive father tends to get Michael's full attention.
-   **CSI**:
    -   Sara Sidle tended to lose her objectivity if there was any indication at all in a case that a girl was being sexually abused or exploited. While it's never made explicit, it's strongly implied that she was abused herself. Sara also gets a bit more assertive when there's evidence of domestic abuse. Her mother got beaten by her father, who eventually retorted by killing him.
    -   Catherine Willows has a similar reaction in any case involving children, being a mother herself.
-   Also used on **CSI: NY** with Lindsay. She had a meltdown when dealing with a case that reminded her of the attack that killed her friends, though she didn't blow up, just ran off and refused to deal until Stella caught up with her.
-   **House**:
    -   Used twice by Kutner. One episode has him act very sympathetically toward a girl who claims to be orphaned (like him), but when he discovers she lied, the niceness stops. Averted in a later episode, in which Kutner is mean to a teenage Jerk Jock. Taub assumes that this trope is in effect, but it later turns out that Kutner was acting on guilt caused by his own high school jerkocity.
    -   Used by Thirteen as she forces parents to tell a young child that he isn't biologically male but could be either sex. Related because of her own unusual sexuality (she's bisexual).
-   **Law & Order: Special Victims Unit** runs on a mix of this trope and It's Personal.
-   In an episode of **Malcolm in the Middle**, Lois is on jury duty. After viciously calling for the conviction of a teenage thief, she realizes that she's projecting her feelings about Francis on the defendant and resigns, but not until she's convinced everyone else and wasted an insane amount of time.
-   **Monk**:
    -   Subverted in the episode "Mr. Monk and the TV Star"; when the evidence seems to say Brad Terry is innocent, Monk thinks that he was projecting his own resentment over a popular classmate who snubbed him onto the guy. It turns out Monk was right.
    -   In the episode "Mr. Monk and the Foreign Man", Monk takes the case of an African man whose wife was killed in a hit-and-run incident because, as a grieving widower himself, he understands the man's pain. As the episode progresses, it becomes clear that he's letting his emotions about Trudy's death get too close to the case (Stottlemeyer even warns him about this).
-   In **NCIS** Agent McGee is interrogating a suspect who brags about beating up nerds, he plays along for a minute or two before revealing he used to be bullied and as a Federal Agent he was now the one in power and could make the bully's life a living hell.
-   Sam Hanna of **NCIS: Los Angeles** gets this way on a case where a girl has been kidnapped and Buried Alive, as he went through a similar hell when he was a SEAL.

After seeing Midori being threatened by the very people she was trying to save moments before, Keisuke is reminded about his own experience when he was younger. He tried to stand up for a smaller boy who was getting bullied at school, but it backfired when everyone started picking on Keisuke instead... including the smaller boy he was just defending.
