All-Loving Hero: 
Follow

_"The strange blue world to which my father sent me.  
If you knew how you are loved, not one of you would raise a hand in rage again."_

— **Superman**, gazing at Earth from space

This character, simply put, loves everyone. Loves them with a deep, spiritual love that means they will shake heaven and earth, destroy gods and planets, bring nations to their knees, etc. for the person they just met yesterday. They will believe the best of everyone, and constantly give someone a second chance (though they _will_ defeat the Big Bad). They repay cruelty with kindness and anger with calm. They are the ones who will suffer for the sins of their loved ones. Most people think they're insane, but somehow they pull it off.

The Empathic Weapon trusts them completely, as does every animal and child who immediately recognize the good in them and take quickly to them. Their every step causes flowers to bloom. Their circle of friends are in awe of them, if not somewhat in love with them. They'll even attract an Anti-Hero or two who will stick around so they can figure out what drugs this person is taking — and where _they_ can get some. In their hands, The Power of Love and The Power of Friendship can be an awesome force, they may be the standard-bearer for the message that You Are Not Alone, You Are Better Than You Think You Are and if anything can redeem a person against the odds by showing them the light of goodness, it will probably be the All-Loving Hero.

On the Sliding Scale of Idealism Versus Cynicism, All-Loving Hero is a heavily idealistic character. Even in a dark world, they are ideal. They will always say Silly Rabbit, Cynicism Is for Losers! and inspire hope.

In terms of The Four Loves, All-Loving Hero is Agape, or Unconditional Love for All, personified. However, by no means is the character exempt from the other three loves.

The Fool is sometimes the embryonic state of All-Loving Hero doubled as the Idiot Hero. A Magnetic Hero has the intangible quality of earning respect and followers that some All-Loving Hero characters do but without needing the "love and forgive everyone" part. An All-Loving Hero who takes their idealism too far into Facepalm-worthy idiocy (like seriously trying to trade the Artifact of Doom if the villain promises not to hurt anyone) may lapse into Stupid Good or Lawful Stupid, and they can also form into Kindhearted Simpletons if they manage to help others thoroughly. Such a character may have moments where they are Not So Above It All or fall short of this standard.

The viewpoint character in a White Man's Burden story will often be an All-Loving Hero. For the character who only _thinks_ they're All-Loving Hero, see the Love Freak. The Cutie shares a lot of the All-Loving Hero's characteristic personality type, but isn't as much of a paragon of idealism and may or may not have their overpowering charisma. Similarly, The Pollyanna has the All-Loving Hero's optimism and good heart but doesn't have the same kind of charisma or deep spiritualism. The Redeemer is often a trait caused by All-Loving Heroism.

Sub-Trope to Ideal Hero. Compare Martyr Without a Cause, The Paragon, The Heart, Incorruptible Pure Pureness, Purity Sue, Nice Guy, and Rousseau Was Right. In Shades of Conflict, this Trope heavily synergizes well with White-and-Grey Morality, thanks to the latter's principle that the characters are either good or misguided.

Although its previous trope name was The Messiah, this trope is **not** about Jesus-analogues; that's Messianic Archetype. While they and All-Loving Hero sometimes overlap, a character with the Messianic Archetype can be far-flung from being All-Loving Hero in mind and behavior.

Contrast Misanthrope Supreme, who has nothing but hatred for everyone; (although a more Anti-Villain version may have been a former All-Loving Hero, who came to believe that the only way to truly save everyone was taking extreme measures) and Dark Messiah, which can stand in opposition to this but is more Messianic Archetype + Anti-Hero. Dueling Messiahs is what happens when those two come to a head.

In the context of methods of climax fulfillment, this may be referred to as a "Love Hero". May overlap with For Happiness as character motivation.

All-Loving Hero Example in Asian Animation

-   **Noonbory and the Super 7** has the title character. Villain or hero, it matters not to him; he will help anyone who needs it, no questions asked, no reward necessary.

---
All-Loving Hero Example in Comic Books

-   From **Astro City,** there's the Silver Agent. Even after he had been found guilty of murder and executed, the Agent still uses time travel to repeatedly return to the city and save it through several major crises, and his selfless sacrifice shames the citizenry for decades.
-   Depending on the Writer with Bruce Wayne. At times writers will show him as an angsty, revenge driven Anti-Hero. Other writers will characterize him as a more compassionate hero then he initially looks, as he tries to genuinely help troubled Anti Villains who want to change and get better. Plus, he deeply believes in not killing his enemies and is a Friend to All Children.
-   Cassandra Cain Batgirl III once asked "why does everyone I love die?", to which the person she was speaking to responded: "because you love everyone, and everybody dies."
-   **Captain America** is a staunch example of this; a patriotic American soldier who will defend the lives of those from any race, creed or identity. It's to the point that even Magneto, who spent his life believing all Humans Are Bastards, tried to prove this by using a device the reveals one's innermost prejudice. It was useless against Cap, because he hates **no one** and has compassion for all. Magneto had to concede defeat.
-   She-Hulk is traditionally an amazingly kind, moral, altrustic, idealistic, and philanthropic individual, including systematically helping even dangerous criminals to be treated decently via her legal work, creating her own disaster relief organisation, and being as good as impossible to corrupt, even after weeks of systematic torture and brainwashing. She is usually up there with Captain America as the most purely heroic Marvel Comics character, and is always very kind, friendly, helpful, and inspirational to regular people, rather than considering herself above them.
-   Likewise, **Casper the Friendly Ghost** in his comic books, even more so than in any other incarnation of the character. He'll go out of his way to help any stranger, human or animal (and sometimes vegetable or mineral). If a villain antagonizing him suddenly runs into trouble, Casper will promptly turn and offer his help, often (though not always) shaming the villain into turning over a new leaf.
-   Paulie in **Circles** loved everyone he met and always regarded every person with kindness, even his enemies like Carter Allen when he paid for his back injuries.
-   Flycatcher, the frog prince of **Fables**, is universally kind and universally loved for it, and he's the only character who had no sins to absolve or remit under the Fabletown Amnesty. The All-Loving Syndrome really kicks in when he receives a purity-powered suit of armor that allows him to resurrect the dead, defeating massive armies without spilling blood, and establishes the completely peaceful "Kingdom of Haven" in the middle of enemy territory.
-   The Flash:
    -   Barry Allen treasures his life and his friends above anything else. While Jay is a Cool Old Guy and Wally skirts on Jerk with a Heart of Gold, Barry is all around a Nice Guy. In fact, writers say his biggest flaw is that he tries to be helpful to **everyone**, he's just **too nice**.
    -   His successor Wally West was known for being compassionate and honestly interested in reforming most of his enemies. To have Wally really want to put you down required a truly monstrous act.
-   Chubby Huggs from **Get Fuzzy**, who begins every day with hugging his pillow and thanking it for being so soft, and continues in the same way. Needless to say, Bucky is scared to death of Chubby Huggs.

-   Christopher Rudd in **Lucifer**: He's a damned soul in Hell who manages through skill and luck to become one of Hell's nobility. What do you guess he does then? He teaches demons compassion and kindness, gets them and the damned to get along, and finally leads their army to save the Silver City **and** conquer it in one fell swoop in the name of justice.
-   Nightwing: Dick Grayson. He's the kind of hero who lets the people he just saved hug him for half an hour until they stop shaking, and Bruce has canonically said that Dick saved him (not the other way around) when he came to live at Wayne Manor. Phil Jimenez said it best here:
    
    "Dick has so many connections to other characters. In many ways, even more than Superman or Batman, Nightwing is the soul, the linchpin, of **The DCU**. He's well respected by everyone, known to the JLA, the Titans, the Outsiders, Birds of Prey – everyone looks to him for advice, for friendship, for his skills. He's natural leader of the DCU."
    
-   Robin Tim Drake started out this way— wanting to help everyone, getting along with all his classmates regardless of how rude or cruel they were, trying to rehabilitate villains and sometimes inadvertently earning their respect or affection — but later writers decided to give him an extensive angst upgrade and this trait faded almost entirely after he was put through a brutal Trauma Conga Line.
-   **The Sandman (1989)**: Death of the Endless is quite possibly the friendliest, most compassionate entity in the DC Universe. She loves you, no matter who you are or what you've done.

-   Zayne Carrick from **Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic** is a good example of a fool who is an embryonic All-Loving Hero. Initially, a failing Jedi Padawan whose only power seems to be literal good luck (as in, he spent an hour trying to catch a petty thief for the half-dozenth time, and thus arrived late to what should have been his own murder), over the course of the series he saves first himself; then a junk scavenger and his adopted daughter; then a bunch of captured Jedi; then several million people from an orbital nuclear bombardment; then he tries to save one of the Jedi masters who were trying to kill him. As one of them says:
    
    "You...**You**... would save **me**?"
    
-   Luke Skywalker in **In the Shadows of their Fathers**, part of **Star Wars Rebellion**. He goes to Jabiim to help against the Empire, but the Jabiim people were abandoned by his father as tactically unwise during the Clone Wars, and a number of them immediately want him dead<small>◊</small>. After he's locked up some taunt him and try to beat him up and he's rescued, the idea that his father was a monster seems to hurt<small>◊</small> worse<small>◊</small> than the beating... and when the Jabiim are attacked, he fights to defend them without hesitation despite their hostility. Later he tries to stay with them when it would be **extremely** unwise for the Rebellion, because he is not his father. The Jabiim commander agrees<small>◊</small>, basically telling Luke that he's not as tactical but vastly more humane, and they need him more out there.
-   Elena from **Street Fighter** wishes to befriend all of the fighters she encounters, including those who are openly hostile towards her, like Makoto.
-   Spider-Man is compassionate enough to have teamed up and allied with almost every character.
-   Superman is continuously portrayed as always believing in the best of people, and the ideal of what a superhero should be, even in-universe.
    -   He expresses love for the entire planet in **JLA/Hitman #2**:
        
        **"The strange blue world to which my father sent me.**  
        **If you knew how you are loved, not one of you would raise a hand in rage again."**
        
    -   **Reign of Doomsday**: When they are running away from a bunch of Doomsday clones, Superman insists on bringing the original Doomsday along with them in case that they can learn something from it. Supergirl guesses that is not the only reason, though: Superman feared that the other Doomsdays could hurt it.
        
        **Supergirl:** That wasn't the only reason you had us bring Doomsday, was it, Kal? Even the thing that killed you— you were worried the other Doomsdays might harm it.
        
    -   In **Superman: Red Son**, at first. People initially thought his loyalty and bias is purely towards Russia, but as Luthor correctly predicts, his altruism doesn't end at his homeland's borders. That said, there's a Deconstruction as just because Superman cares about people not dying, it doesn't necessarily means he cares about people on an individual level. Later moments of heroism are juxtaposed with inner monologue about how he's been increasingly using them as an excuse to avoid hearing about how the people aren't necessarily happy about the methods behind how their perceived utopia is thriving.
        
        **Stalin**: Oh, for God's sake. Who cares about Pytor Roslov?  
        **Superman**: I care about **everybody**, sir.
        
    -   Supergirl is usually portrayed in this fashion (except for when DC is putting her through a Darker and Edgier phase). Back in the Silver Age, she tried to help every person in trouble she bumped into. In **Supergirl (Rebirth)**, when the public demands to know why she's trying to redeem the mass-murderer Cyborg Superman she replies she refuses to give up on **anybody**.
    -   A scene in **All-Star Superman** shows Superman saving the life of a suicidal teenage girl named Regan by calmly talking to her before she jumps from the roof of a tall building. Superman does this despite knowing he's going to die soon. While doing so, Superman says that Regan is much stronger than she knows, and gives her a Cooldown Hug.
    -   A similar moment to the **All Star Superman** moment occurs in Justice Society #10. During a conversation with the rest of the Justice Society, Superman's super-hearing picks up the voice of a woman who's about to jump off a ledge. Despite being held down by the rest of the Society combined, including Starman using his Gravity Master powers to increase the weight of the entire Society a hundredfold, Superman shakes them all off and speeds through the city to catch the woman before she hits the ground. After catching her, Superman says that "giving up never helped anyone". It's this moment of Superman being a Hope Bringer that convinces the Society that there might be something to Superman's way after all.
-   Tintin from **The Adventures Of Tintin** is dedicated to his friends, brave and always willing to do the right thing, and has given second chances to villains who genuinely wanted to redeem themselves.
-   Wing from **The Transformers: Drift**. Wing is a non-aligned bot who goes on missions to help people, no matter what species they are in distress. Takes an injured Decepticon under his care, and argues with his superiors that it should their duty to help those who are suffering.
-   **Wonder Woman**:
    -   In addition to being one of the strongest warriors, she is a walking avatar of love and peace. Part of the reason Wondy's villains are less known is because when she started out, she not only had a no-killing rule, she also attempted to reform everyone she fought and was frequently successful in turning villains into allies.
    -   This is emphasized during the Blackest Night miniseries, where her love for all things in existence, as discussed by both Aphrodite and Star Sapphire Carol Ferris, leads to her being recruited into the Star Sapphire Corps.
    -   Even the Darker and Edgier **Wonder Woman (2011)** maintains the all-loving mantle of previous versions. When she is forced to marry Hades to protect others only to leave him at the altar, Hades wonders how it's possible since she said she loved him while bound by the Lasso of Truth. Diana says that she never lied; she loves him, just like she loves everybody.
    -   In **Wonder Woman: Dead Earth**, this aspect of her character is given massive recontextualization and reexamination. Taking place in a Bad Future ravaged by an apocalypse that an amnesiac Diana discovers was apparently her own fault, the story dissects the inherent disconnect between someone who unabashedly cherishes all humanity, but is also capable of great violence against the forces who threaten it, including a large portion of humanity itself. The story ends up nevertheless reminding readers that her brutality is still very much rooted in a retaliation against cruelty, that her compassion and hope in humanity's infinite potential is in fact her greatest strength, and that both are necessary if the world is to continue its survival.
-   **X-Men**:
    -   Professor Xavier is a zig-zagged example. On the one hand, he's the voice of coexistence against Magneto's voice of separation. Even after all the battles with all the villainous mutants and all the plots by the villainous humans and even the more numerous mundane everyday prejudice by muggles he still believes peaceful coexistence will happen. However, from the start he's had a consistent dark side, with its manifestation Depending on the Writer and Alternative Character Interpretation. He was largely played up as this following the films, which leaned into this interpretation. By the Krakoan era, the implication is that heart he's this, but like the **Red Son** version of Superman, he's not so good with individuals - leading to famous lines such as "Professor Xavier is a JERK!" - and that his faith in humanity is severely dented.
        -   The Krakoan era also adds another interesting angle with the revelation that Moira had spent decades working to break him to get him to a point he'd be more willing to make questionable decisions, meaning Xavier may have very well been a played straight version of this trope without her influence.
    -   A far purer example of this trope is Jean Grey, who has a fiery temper, but compassion rivalling **Wonder Woman** and **Franchise/Superman**. While she was always The Heart of the X-Men and it stands out in how much Darker and Edgier the team became after her death in **New X-Men** (and after her original death in the **Dark Phoenix Saga**, come to that), and she was practically deified for it to the intense discomfort of her time-travelling teenage counterpart, who isn't amused either by sainthood or being a Dark Messiah, it's been marked as a key part of her character from her resurrection, something emphasised from **X-Men: Red** onwards, which juxtaposed Jean's open and sincere compassionate idealism with Cassandra Nova's cynical Humans Are Bastards attitude. In the end, Jean was right, and not only gave Nova a Silly Rabbit, Cynicism Is for Losers! speech, but pointed out that 'compassionate' (as in, willing to help Nova even after all the horrors she'd perpetrated) is not the same as 'stupid' or 'weak'.

All-Loving Hero Example in Fan Works

-   **A Different Childhood**: Roxanne is easily the most accepting human in the fic, being among the first people to see the monsters as more than...well, monsters, and is nothing but polite and friendly to them, to the point that they consider her their first true human friend and fully support her when she starts dating Megamind.
-   **Hetalia: Axis Powers** fanfic **Gankona, Unnachgiebig, Unità**: Italy couldn't bring himself to hate the homophobe who had beaten and nearly raped him, Italy didn't despise the bully who singled him out shortly after that ordeal, Italy never hated Austria who had abused him for hundreds of years, he never resented Germany for the poor treatment he received, he never was angry at Japan for the coldness exhibited towards him, etc.
-   **Child of the Storm**:
    -   Diana Herculeis a.k.a. teenage Wonder Woman. Diana is kind and sweet to pretty much everyone she meets, being described by multiple different characters as probably the nicest person they've ever met, despite being (or perhaps because she is) The Empath. However, Beware the Nice Ones applies, as she has a dangerous temper, especially if someone she particularly cares for is wronged.
    -   Jean Grey is described as being 'big sister to the world' on several occasions and is depicted as near-universally warm and loving. However, Beware the Nice Ones applies to her, too, as she also has a dangerous temper, especially if someone she particularly cares for is wronged, too.
    -   Harry is a more complicated example; he's got Chronic Hero Syndrome and he'll offer a second chance to almost everyone, unless he's on the point of losing his mind, and is known to express overwhelming compassion to extremely dangerous enemies (specifically, a Living Weapon, Maddie). Bucky notes in the sequel that in doing so, he's capable of bringing out the better natures of people who didn't even know that they **had** better natures. However, he doesn't give third chances, and in the sequel, he has a rampant case of PSTD. In the third book, after a few months of coming to terms with his issues and, frankly, self-care in a time-travelling trip when all he has to worry about is himself, he's much, much nicer, as shown with how he uses the Phoenix against the Annihilation Wave.
    -   Clark Kent is arguably the straightest example, being noted as one of the kindest and sweetest characters in the story, willing to try and reach out to someone who treated him like a disposable battery and violated him on a spiritual level, genuinely trying to help him. This should not in any way be mistaken for weakness.
-   **A Clash Of Neets**: Yunyun Stark has seemingly made it her mission in life to befriend **everyone** in Westeros, from common folk, to hardened mercenaries, to noble lords, to the point where, on the rare occasion she **doesn't** want to be someone's friend, the adults in her life take it as a sign that that person shouldn't be trusted too much. So far, that's included a rapist, a thief, and Littlefinger.
-   In **Codex Equus**, there's Blue Suede Heartstrings, an Alicorn god who is based on Elvis Presley. His entry notes that even as a mortal, Blue is very polite, kind-hearted, and friendly to almost everyone he meets. This is what allowed his reputation as a beloved celebrity to survive even past the Second Age, and has earned the attention of both mortals and divines, such as King Ibrida, the Draconequus god of Hybrids. The fact that he became a god himself through his good deeds in the Second Age hasn't affected his friendliness at all, and in fact uses his divinity to help people in need. And as the god of Humility, he reaches out to prideful individuals and tries to help them realize the error of their ways so he can redeem them. Among his accomplishments are befriending Ponies from all three tribes despite tribalism being heavily encouraged in the early Second Age; persuading a few Alvslog Deer to abandon their reactionary, racist, and self-righteous ways while still keeping their love for nature; and helping the repentant Sunnytowners recover from their traumas despite knowing what they did to Ruby Heart and other innocent ponies. The only people he doesn't like are tribalists/racists, and people who "cheapen" music and/or use it for evil, and even then, he tries to deal with them with kindness first before resorting to violence.
-   **crawlersout**: Fem!Harry is this, even more so than Canon!Harry. She can't stand the thought of killing so much that she gives up a chance to move on with a normal life to give a second chance to a younger version of her greatest enemy and the only man she ever killed. She can't even find it in herself to hate and kill Gellert Grindelwald, despite knowing full well what kind of man he is and what crimes he will go on to commit.
-   In the HTTYD/Encanto crossover **The Dragon and the Butterfly**, Hiccup is still the kind, forgiving person that he is in canon (as are the Madrigals, for the most part). The only person he has no patience with is Stoick and the Vikings of Berk, as his time in the Encanto has helped him realize just how bad his home life was.
-   Steven/Rhodonite in **Gift of A Diamond** is so optimistic and charismatic, he was able to single-handedly change the nature of Homeworld and its Fantastic Caste System. Off-color and lower-tier gems have more of a voice, the Diamonds became more forgiving and there has not been a single gem shattered in 8 years.
-   In **Harry Tano** (a Star Wars/Harry Potter Crossover AU), Harry is raised by Ahsoka Tano instead of the Dursleys. She trains him as her Padawan from a young age. Thus, by the time he attends Hogwarts, he is patient, compassionate, and kind to everyone, with the one exception being Draco (and even that's mostly one-sided, as Draco is the school bully and instigates every one of their confrontations). Harry is considerably more forgiving here as a result, and he willingly makes amends with Snape and Dumbledore.
-   In **Supergirl** fanfic **Hellsister Trilogy**, Satan Girl blatantly states she could never stand Supergirl's empathetic, caring ways. This is after Supergirl has expressed sorrow at the loss of someone who is attempting to kill her brutally for the... fourth? fifth? time.
    
    **Supergirl:** You won't believe this, but I'm sorry. On my honor, I am. And if you will swear to stop this battle, I will help you search for your child. That is my promise.  
    **Satan Girl:** Ohhhhh, don't you wish, Lightsister. I can find my child. After our war, I will find him. Or her. There is nothing left to us now, except the fight. You would not tolerate my existence, nor I yours. I am not capable of your empathy, of your petty virtue. You are not capable of my ruthlessness and power. Come, sister. Let us destroy each other.
    
-   Avalina in **Hope for the Heartless**. She's the very definition of purity as shown with her natural way with animals, appallment of violence and cruelty directed even at her tormentors, ability to look past the dead exterior of the Horned King and bring the better out of him.

-   **The Spectacular Spider Man Lost In Gotham**: While discussing the death of the Green Goblin with Batman, Spider-Man admits to himself that, as much as he hates some of his villains and despite the terrible things they've done, he never wanted to see any of them die.
-   Kara from **Kara of Rokyn**, who is forgiving and compassionate towards everyone, including people who try to screw her life up. Even her rival Jara finds it hard to hate her after Kara talks openly and respectfully of Jara's erstwhile persecuted people.
-   In **Last Child of Krypton**, Shinji doesn't like or trust Kaworu. Misato is shocked because Shinji had never disliked anybody so far.
-   Lily Evans in **The Light in the Dark** fits this pretty well. There are few people she dislikes, and she is kind to nearly everyone she encounters. In fact, her kindness and loving nature arguably serve as key driving forces of the story.
-   **Maidenless No Longer**: The first thing any of the women notices about the Tarnished is that he genuinely cares about them, listening when they speak even though they can sense that he seems to already know what they're going to say. Considering that almost all of them have severe cases of depression (if not outright insanity) and most of them also have a physical deformity, almost none of them can remember the last time someone was genuinely **nice** to them.
-   **Peter Parker Needs A Hug**: Even after everything he's been through (including being betrayed, losing his mentors, and being **blipped out of existence**), Peter is still a compassionate, helpful person who does everything he can to help everyone he can, even begging Red Hood to spare the life of a criminal who tried to kill Peter.
-   **Persona V: Reversing the Wheel of Fate**: A cornerstone of Ren's character in this fic is that he's always someone that can be relied on, something that he refuses to abandon even after Shido retaliates and strips him of everything.
-   **Of Siblings and Masks**: Subverted as Nunnally's peaceful and all-caring persona is a mask to hide her darker and more selfish personality.
-   While the Lord Inquisitor is a Magnetic Hero, the Lady Inquisitor is this, in **All This Sh\*t is Twice as Weird**. Her compassionate nature and willingness to give second chances is considered her defining trait, for good or ill.
-   In **A wand for Steven**, Steven is the only character whose friendly demeanor transcends his own house, being happily invited to the other house's tables for lunch.
-   Steffon Baratheon in **The Young Stag** counts as one. He has strong, progressive ideals that everyone is created equal concerns over the Smallfolk and desires to make their lives better. His primary motivation to campaign for the Iron Throne is mainly to save the people from Joffrey's cruelty, rather than taking it for himself.
-   Deconstructed by **Steven Universe** Deconstruction Fic **Flawed Crystals**, which takes a very dark Alternative Character Interpretation of Steven. It argues Steven valued loving everyone, even the monstrous diamonds, more than he valued justice. This led to his fantasy of making up the canon ending, where the injustices against the gems are swept under the rug so that everyone can get along. Steven ultimately admits that he cared more about inhabiting the persona of the all-loving hero than he cared about what people actually needed.
-   **Peace of Mind, Piece of Heart**: Steven retains this quality from his home series, being incredibly amicable to every denizen he and Catra encounter.
-   **My Super Best Friend**: Nichole is an unprejudiced Nice Girl who's shown to be willing to help anyone in need, in spite of what they may have done in the past, with Kyle being the most prominent example.

All-Loving Hero Example in Films — Animation

-   **Big Hero 6**: Baymax was programmed to provide care to anyone as a robot healthcare companion. His sole goal is to care for people, whoever they are.
-   **The Book of Life**:
    -   Manolo. All he wants to do is sing from his heart and be with his loved ones. He has the true bullfighter talent, but can't bring himself to deliver the finishing blow, despite having been raised to do so by a family full of bullfighters.
    -   La Muerte. She believes that the heart of man is essentially pure. Plus, all creatures love her and she has a deep fondness towards children.
-   Anna from **Frozen (2013)**. All she wants to do is to reunite with her big sister Elsa, and she believes in The Power of Love. Even during the years where it seems as if her aloof older sister didn't love her because Elsa shut her out and became closed-off toward her, and when Elsa shoots ice spikes at her and then covers the kingdom with an Endless Winter, Anna never gives up her belief in Elsa's goodness and risks her life as she struggles through a blizzard to prove it, rather than letting people's fear of the queen prevail and taking the kingdom for herself like Hans later attempts to do.
-   Disney's Hercules is one, unlike the original myths. Disney's version is compassionate, and his most dominant trait is his innocence and massively kind heart, in spite of being treated like a "freak" by his peers and those around him (with the exception of his foster parents) throughout his childhood.
-   Hiccup from **How to Train Your Dragon**. Believing that humans and dragons can co-exist will definitely make him this.
-   Po from **Kung Fu Panda** is a hero who is good-natured and doesn't hate anybody, not even Lord Shen, the Big Bad of **Kung Fu Panda 2**, who killed his parents and repeatedly tried to kill him. He still forgives him and even tries to help him let go of his own troubled past.
-   **Pocahontas**:
    -   The titular character is an interesting variant of this trope. On one hand, she's a Friend to All Living Things who has a number of animal companions by her side (one of which used to be on the evil side, nonetheless), is very open-minded about encountering people from another culture and hardly ever resorts to violence. On the other hand, she's a lot more level-headed and shrewd than most examples — a main reason she fits this trope is that she **knows** that racism and violence between opposing races, namely the Native Americans and the English settlers, will only lead to each other becoming even more xenophobic than before, which effectively makes her the Only Sane Woman for much of the movie, and it's through her influence that other characters come to the same realization. Pocahontas's nature as an All-Loving Heroine (and a Badass Pacifist, for that matter) gets discussed briefly in **Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World**, where one of the citizens of London expresses fears over the Powhatan tribe raging war again, and the person with her responds by saying, "Oh, my dear, Pocahontas would never allow that."
    -   Grandmother Willow also counts, due to Pocahontas inheriting many of the beliefs she holds from her.
-   **The Prince of Egypt**:
    -   Moses. Even after learning that his adopted family was responsible for killing and enslaving his people, he still didn't hate them. He wanted to believe that Ramses could change. He begs him to stop enslaving the Hebrews or the Egyptians and his son will be killed by the Plague. Which happened, and he still takes the time to cry for them even after being told the Hebrews were free to go. Also even when Ramses betrayed him by going to kill all of his people, and had no choice but to close the Red Sea on him, Moses still worried if Ramses was still alive.
    -   Moses' foster mother, Queen Tuya deserves a mention here, despite her small screentime. Right after seeing the baby Moses, she decided to adopt him without hesitance and she loves Moses no less than her biological son for entire life. She is always gentle and affectionate with her husband, despite him being far from a good person. She is the only one not to enjoy Moses' humiliation of enslaved foreigner Tzipporah but to feel sympathy for her instead. It's actually her reaction that makes Moses regret this act.
-   **White Snake (2019)**: Xuan is a caring, selfless young man who does everything in his power to save everyone. He also wants to quit his snake hunter profession to become a doctor.
-   In **Turning Red**, this is Downplayed. Mei is certainly not immune to anger, but she is a kind, compassionate girl who loves her friends, family, and animals in general, embraces all labels, and doesn't hold grudges, quickly forgiving both Ming and Tyler despite everything they've done to her.
-   **Zootopia** has Benjamin Clawhauser, who is affable and compassionate with every single character he interacts with, which includes the protagonist almost everyone else at least initially dismisses, their Mean Boss, an unruly visitor, and an **arrested criminal**. He is quick to apologize for his one small, understandable misstep, and assigns no blame when he ends up unfairly punished, an event that badly affects Judy because it's so obvious that he doesn't deserve it. In fact, Clawhauser's entire being fiercely contradicts the "Predators Are Mean" Fantastic Racism, showing how bad it is as a blanket statement.

All-Loving Hero Example in Films — Live-Action

-   Victor Laszlo in **Casablanca**. It says something about him that the only person in the entire movie who isn't in complete awe and admiration of the utterly heroic and saintly resistance leader is the Nazi officer who has been sent to capture him, which is a ringing endorsement if ever there was one. When his wife, believing that he was dead, has fallen in love with another man, and his example is so powerful that that other man is eventually quite willing to sacrifice his one chance at happiness by convincing her to stay with him.

-   **DC Extended Universe**: Downplayed compared to most versions, but it should be noted that Clark saved his childhood bully from drowning, cried over having to kill Zod (whom previously sworn to kill all humans), stood up for criminals whose lives were indirectly taken by Batman's "one man reign of terror" and even rescued Lex Luthor (whom, mind you, ruined his reputation, kidnapped and nearly killed his mother, nearly killed his girlfriend and blackmailed him to murder a human) from Doomsday's fist. Not to mention the many times where he's willing to sacrifice himself to save the entire human race regardless of how much pain it brought him. For all of his angst, he's still portrayed as a man whose compassion for other is his main driving force no matter what.
-   Santa Claus in **Ernest Saves Christmas**. Every single thing the man does oozes sincerity, generosity, compassion, love, saintliness, and just flat-out **Christmas**. Hell, the whole plot of the movie is that he's running out of time to pick a new Santa Claus because he literally loves doing good so much that he's stretched the clock as long as it will go just so he can continue doing it.
-   **The Fourth Wise Man**: Artaban is this, nearly to a fault. He is late for the journey to meet the Savior because he met a desperately ill man and couldn't do other than tend to him. Shortly afterwards, he uses a priceless gem as a bribe to save an infant's life. He settles among a leper colony for decades, living in shocking poverty because they needed a physician.
-   **The Hunger Games**: Primrose "Prim" Everdeen seems incapable of bearing any ill will towards anything.
-   **The Love of Siam**. Ying, the Chinese girl who has a crush on Mew. Throughout the movie, she is kind and helpful to both Tong and Mew. She is the only person out of Tong's friends to comfort Tong when he is confused about his sexuality. It should be noted that she's not that close to Tong and only just met him not long ago. She also helps Mew with his love song and fixes him up with Tong despite knowing that in doing so mean she would have no chance with Mew in the future.
-   **Marvel Cinematic Universe**:
    -   When Spider-Man witnesses a weapons deal and sees the dealer about to shoot a mouthy thug, he thwarts it deliberately revealing his spying location, shouting "You want to shoot someone, shoot me!".
    -   Steve is a very idealistic person and always tries to see the best in everyone. It's this trait that makes Dr. Erskine choose Steve for the super soldier program.
-   **Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides**. Philip Swift is a Good Shepherd who believes that God's love is available to everyone; pirates, mermaids, etc. He becomes a downplayed example later in the film in that he loves everyone **except** Blackbeard.

-   Luke Skywalker in **Star Wars**. Consider that upon discovering his father is a Sith Lord and one of the galaxy's most ruthless killers, he decides — against the advice of everyone — that Dad can be saved from the Dark Side. He turns out to be right. In the sequel trilogy, after his nephew Ben's fall to the Dark Side and his "transformation" into Kylo Ren, which he played a role in, he blames none other than himself, then exiled himself out of sheer guilt. For the Star Wars Legends continuity, Luke was this in the early years but starting with the Legacy era he does such things as advocating torture. The mantle was passed on to his son Ben, who wants to redeem people who his father would rather kill. It takes Ben's Sith girlfriend to show Luke how he's not that different from them.

-   **X-Men Film Series**: Professor X is still dedicated to protecting humans even when they try to subjugate or even commit genocide against mutantkind. Compared to a normal person, he's unusually forgiving towards Erik Lehnsherr, who has ruined and endangered Xavier's life (and is a big threat to the X-Men) more than once. In **X-Men: Apocalypse**, Hank summarizes Charles' mindset as "He thinks the best of people. He has hope." Professor X welcomes Storm to his school in spite of the fact that she had tried to kill the X-Men in Cairo.

All-Loving Hero Example in Literature

-   **20,000 Leagues Under the Sea**: The Professor Aronnax is a humble Wide-Eyed Idealist scientist that already had won the Undying Loyalty of Counseil before he comes to the Nautilus. He also makes Idiot Hero Ned Land do a More Expendable Than You sacrifice when they are in the Pole, and he is ultimately the reason why Captain Nemo gets his Villainous Breakdown when Aronnax discovers the Nautilus is as Weapon of Mass Destruction.
-   **A Conspiracy of Truths**: Chant describes Ylfing as this, saying that he constantly sees the best parts of the people around him, and the inherent goodness in all of them. He sees this as a bad thing — not only does he feel Ylfing is too trusting, he also finds it annoying.

-   **The Arts of Dark and Light** has Marcus, a somewhat downplayed example. He isn't a pacifist by any means, as he eventually does become a military officer (as his father wants him to), but he remains a highly empathetic person, who forgives enemies, hates unnecessary violence and feels sorry for the poor, the slaves, and basically everyone who is oppressed in some way — even the savage goblins the legion he is deployed to is assigned to fight.
-   The protagonist in **Beast Tamer**, Rein Shroud, rarely holds a grudge and will come to the rescue of just about anyone who needs it. **Rarely** being the key word as even though he ultimately does wind up helping the Hero's Party, he demands an apology for unjustly firing him first, and when they refused to provide it, even going so far as to mock his own battle harem, he and his ladies **beat them down and force them**, and only then is he willing to hear what they need from him.
-   Eriond in **The Belgariad** and **The Malloreon**. He's a small child in the former, although he is very trusting and generous. (He's been raised to be a complete innocent so that he can handle The Orb, which tends to destroy anyone who touches it with less than completely pure motives.) By **The Malloreon** he's grown into the position. He's very mild in temperament, and even when he gets very angry (at one point they're in a Temple of Torak and a major sacrifice ritual (human, of course) is going on all he does is put out the temple fires — since if the hearts can't be burned, there's no way to continue the sacrifices.)

-   **Count to the Eschaton**: Prince Ranier from **Count to a Trillion**. Menelaus realizes that he should have realized that he was dead when he saw a mural of an attack from their starship: the prince would never have countenanced it for any reason.
-   Fyodor Dostoevsky:
    -   Alyosha, the third and youngest of **The Brothers Karamazov**, loves all and is loved by all. Dostoevsky uses an entire chapter to illustrate how it would be impossible not to trust him. Everyone — **everyone** — in the book confides in Alyosha, and at times these discussions seem to resemble a priest taking confession.
    -   Prince Lev Nikolaievich Myshkin from **The Idiot** is a much darker interpretation of this character type. Myshkin himself is, of course, kind and full of love for humanit y— which leads most everyone he meets to assume he's a fool and try to take advantage of him. Then Myshkin himself ends up hurting Aglaya when a climactic Sadistic Choice forces him to choose between his love for Aglaya and his pity for the fallen Nastasya.
-   **The Dresden Files**: Michael Carpenter is a Knight of the Cross wielding the holy blade **Amoracchius** aka "The Sword of Love" aka Excalibur. As a man who chose to continually serve and wield the Sword, he exemplifies this. He doesn't judge Harry, call him evil or a monster for some of the hard and possibly wrong choices Harry has made. He sees him as his fellow brother who, like Michael himself, sometimes needs a helping hand. Any mortal who is being hurt by some dark force, Michael sets out to right this wrong. This includes working to redeem, not kill, the hosts of Fallen Angels, including the 2,000-year-old leader. All this said, when a soul is at stake when the person ignores his offer of redemption, Michael will go all out and work to end the evil.
-   **Ender's Game**: Ender Wiggin claims, and believes, that he loves even his enemies. Doesn't stop him from brutally murdering them all, though. While most of it is in self-defence, there's also instances where he beats people who were only nuisances to death, including the first bully he kills in the book.
-   Sorahb in the **Farsala Trilogy** is supposed to be this, but the trope is subverted in that he never actually shows up — the person everyone believes is him is actually an ordinary man named Fasal.
-   Elnora from **A Girl of the Limberlost** is this to everyone. The closest she ever got to averting this was after "The Reason You Suck" Speech she gave to her mother during her Despair Event Horizon, but forgave her instantly after her mother realized she was wrong and tried to make things right.
-   **The Goblin Emperor**: Maia's very nearly this. He's exceptionally generous to his servants and makes a point of knowing their names, tries to be kind to his family on his father's side even when they have nothing but disdain for him, and even tries to forgive one of his bodyguards for betraying him.
-   Primrose "Prim" Everdeen from **The Hunger Games** seems incapable of bearing any ill will towards anything.
-   Elijah Valentine in **Last Mage** is a reasonable, slightly snarky guy who would make saint Augustine proud with how much he genuinely loves people. Even if they're idiots (just don't expect him to give the idiots much attention or responsibility while he's saving the world).
-   **Les Misérables**:
    -   Jean Valjean strives to be this because of a The Atoner mindset. He adopts the daughter of a stranger, lifts a heavy beam off another stranger, and spares the man who hunted him for a decade for breaking parole, all out of the goodness of his heart.
    -   In turn, he learns forgiveness from the Bishop of Digne after 19 years of prison having made Valjean bitter and hateful. The Bishop allows Valjean into his home and offers him dinner. When Valjean steals some things from him in the dead of night and later caught and brought back to the Bishop by the police, the Bishop states Valjean was given the items, as Valjean told the police, thanks the police for their diligence, and tells Valjean he is giving him rarer and more valuable items to help him on his journey, stating he is buying Valjean's soul from the darkness that has filled it.
-   Penryn's little sister, Paige before being experimented on in **Penryn and the End of Days**. She was a vegetarian before the apocalypse and only ate meat because Penryn insisted, and gives Beliel water despite being severely dehydrated herself.
-   Rama, in **Ramayana**. Rama is very peaceful and friendly. He never holds a grudge against his step-mother Kaikeyi for exiling him. Instead he obeys her and ensures that her wishes are carried out. Rama even grants asylum to Ravana's younger brother, Vibhishana, who sought Rama's protection, even when everyone else was against it. Even when Ravana had treacherously kidnapped his wife, Sita, Rama is still willing to forgive Ravana if the latter returned her. That said, Rama is capable of anger... Angering Rama is the last thing you want to do.
-   **Release That Witch**: Discussed. the main character Roland believes in giving equal rights to witches, commoners, and serfs alike. Though he also notes these are for largely selfish purposes: Industrialization requires massive amounts of human capital, specialized skills, and so forth. By bringing in more and more people and giving them the same incentives (improved quality of life, protection from foreign powers, etc.) to pursue industrialization, he's just doing what he has to to make sure his plans succeed.
-   Finny in **A Separate Peace**, who never sees anyone as an enemy, and believes that "when you really love something, then it has to love you back, in whatever way it has to love."
-   Star Wars Legends books:
    -   Luke Skywalker, in **Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor**. Throughout that book, even when Luke is struggling with despair and mental trauma, he's consistently kind and compassionate to anyone not currently attempting to kill him. When someone is expressing their claustrophobia, he's completely sympathetic to them despite believing he's been through far worse himself. At the end, when to save the day he needs to destroy a mind-control device knowing that doing so will kill the fifty thousand enemies being mind controlled, he does so, but in the Force he stays with all of them to feel them die so that they won't die alone. And because it's all he can do for them. Nick Rostu, who was previously mind-controlled and begged Luke to kill him — but was instead saved — has the chance to blow away thirty-some innocent mind-controlled men and women to rescue Luke and return the favor, and he hesitates
        
        because he had an overpowering intuition: if Luke Skywalker thought he might save thirty innocent lives by sacrificing his own, he wouldn't hesitate. Ten innocent lives.  
        One.  
        "Or, hell, one not-so-innocent life," Nick muttered. "Like mine." He flipped the carbine's power setting to stun. "I hate Jedi."
        
    -   Another Star Wars example is Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Clone Wars Gambit novels. Obi-Wan is quite the shining example of the Jedi philosophy of unconditional, unpossessive love, although he is a bit of a downplayed example. His messianic tendencies are usually hidden by his sarcasm and tendency to be less vocal about saving people than Anakin, but his actions speak louder than his words. He nearly kills himself healing the people of Torbel, despite having no training as a healer, simply because it is the right thing to do.

-   Uncle Tom from **Uncle Tom's Cabin**, sacrifices his own chance of freedom several times, and eventually himself, when assisting two female slaves in escaping. When he dies, he prays for his torturers and eventually converts them to a better life. The author intended him to be an example of an ideal Christian.
-   In **Warrior Cats**, Firestar shows nothing but kindness to everyone around him and is willing to give his nine lives for just about anyone, including cats of enemy Clans and also Clanless cats.
-   Sahar Khalifeh's **Wild Thorns**. Adil, a Palestinian who works in Israel (the book was written in the 70s') to support his nine family members, and always looking out for his fellow workers. He's more than once described as trying "to solve the Middle East conflict all by himself." Even his cousin, who considers him a traitor for working in Israel, cares strongly about him.
-   **Wonder Woman: Warbringer**: Diana maintains her traditional characterization of loving humankind and life as a whole, and even going out of her way to attempt to see the best in her opponents and befriend them.

---
All-Loving Hero Example in Live-Action TV

-   Simmons from **Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.** is a downplayed example. She's is the only member of the team to consistently show sympathy with the mind-controlled soldiers they encounter in the main arc. She also seems to genuinely like everybody who isn't an outright antagonist; is always shown to be friendly and interested when meeting new people; is the first one to forgive Skye for betraying the team; and is the only main character never to have succumbed to a Green-Eyed Monster moment, despite the heavy amount of Ship Tease between the show's main and recurring characters, which by rights ought to leave **everyone** a little miffed on occasion.
-   On **Angel,** Wesley Wyndam-Pryce is a very unusual version of this trope because he's considerably more cynical than most of the examples on this page. But Wesley shows love better and more consistently than anyone else in the show — arguably better than anyone in the entire Buffyverse. More than anyone, Wesley understands what it means to love unconditionally. Wesley understands that love is a choice, not a feeling, and even when his feelings are a screwed-up mess of anger and bitterness and hurt and loneliness, he still chooses to love the people who caused all those feelings, to fight for the people who hate him, to protect the people who want nothing to do with him. Wesley loves so strongly and so deeply that it tears him apart, hollows him out, and swallows him whole, but he never stops loving. He pours every ounce of himself into the people he cares about, he loves with every fiber of his being, and it’s never reciprocated in equal measure, but he still never stops loving. Love gives Wesley the courage to overcome his fears because the people he loves are more important than the things he’s afraid of. Love drives Wesley to commit an unthinkable act of betrayal against his closest friend. Love drives him to empty nine bullets into a cyborg he fully believes is his father. And eventually, love drives him insane. Love is a terrible thing for Wesley. But it’s the most beautiful thing about him.
-   Hakuya Ryouga / AbaRed of **Bakuryuu Sentai Abaranger**. He is immune to the mind-screwing abilities of a Monster of the Week specifically because, in his niece's words, "he doesn't hate anyone or anything." Naturally, evil Ranger Nakadai Mikoto does everything in his power to crush the idealism out of him, but Ryouga never stops believing that Mikoto can be redeemed — and he's proven right.
-   On **Buffy the Vampire Slayer**, Tara Maclay is an example of this. Her most commendable and endearing traits were, undoubtedly, her compassion, her understanding, and her capacity for forgiveness when it was truly deserved. For instance, when Joyce died, Tara was the one who offered Buffy the only helpful guidance, having experienced the exact same grief when she lost her own mother.
-   **The Chosen**:
    -   Jesus, naturally. He shows an incredible amount of patience and compassion towards everybody, including those who are shunned by the general Jewish population such as tax collectors, those afflicted with ailments that make them ceremonially unclean, and foreigners who worship pagan deities.
    -   Philip acts like this to the other disciples, even being kind to Matthew, who is sidelined by the rest, from the start. In the last episode of season 2, a clip of Philip is shown when Jesus, discussing the Beatitudes, mentions the "peacemakers".
-   **The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance**: Deet. You'll be hard-pressed to find a more loving, gentle and compassionate character in the entire franchise.
-   Some of the nicer Doctors in **Doctor Who** have drifted into this, although Beware the Nice Ones applies.
    -   The Fourth Doctor during his Douglas Adams\-edited period (Series 17) deserves special mention here, being one of the few Doctors who was outright merciful to his enemies (rather than affable but judgemental), always seeming to hope his opponents would just get **over** wanting to take over the universe, and (thanks to his anti-authoritarian personality) he fails to see punishment as a good thing even when deserved.
    -   The Eleventh Doctor is not very merciful, but he strongly prefers intimidating his enemies with the sheer force of personality rather than even being so aggressive as to outwit them, readily forgives enemies, and is noted to have a special affinity for children in distress.
    -   The Twelfth Doctor is a double subversion. He is trying to atone for the many mistakes he's made in the past from the beginning of his life, is a Pragmatic Hero, a Grumpy Old Man, and has No Social Skills, and **still** makes mistakes even now — sometimes **because** he's trying to be a better man. But he **loves** children, is **fiercely** protective of companions and humanity in general, and over the course of his Myth Arc his capacity for Sympathy for the Devil is thoroughly explored with such characters as Missy, Davros, and Bonnie the Zygon. He also seems to have a certain affinity for monsters he encounters who are not intentionally evil, such as the Teller and the Foretold. Those who are evil enough — or hurt him enough, as in the case of Ashildr/Me — to truly earn his rage will (usually) pay dearly for it, but he still believes in showing mercy whenever possible, and no matter what crimes the villain may have committed. The events of the Series 10 Story Arc start with his decision to spare Missy from final execution and lead to a tragic Season Finale two-parter, in which his attempt to redeem her at last led him to confront her, her **previous** incarnation, and three generations worth of Cybermen. After that ordeal, he only has his regeneration adventure to go through, which ends with him telling the self to come that they should "Always try to be nice, but never fail to be kind."

-   Constable Benton Fraser from **Due South** makes himself something of a local hero in the slum neighborhood of Chicago he lives in, unwittingly and unerringly winning the hearts of nearly everyone around him due to his constant, unwavering kindness to his fellow man. His partner, Ray Vecchio (and later Ray Kowalski), his friends, and even his boss are fiercely protective of him when danger arises. His lack of street smarts and general naiveté can cause problems, though, and they sometimes wonder about his sanity.
    
    **Fraser:** You mean you're using some promotional ploy to get something for nothing?  
    **Ray:** Welcome to the United States of America, Fraser.
    
-   The titular character of **Finding Carter** has this trait, and interestingly enough while Carter is shown to be very charismatic, loving, and easily forgiving, the series doesn't shy away from the potential negative implications of the trait, as it causes Carter to overlook the flaws in people — she is initially hostile to her birth mother because she wants to apprehend the woman who abducted Carter as a child and who Carter views as being her "real" mother, despite Lori being a criminal and arguably someone who doesn't have Carter's best interests at heart. Later in the series Carter's boyfriend Crash accidentally shoots her best friend/ex-boyfriend Max and she finds herself delivering excuses for his actions to her friend and family who insist that Crash is bad news and needs to be arrested.
-   **Flash Gordon**: Flash's idealism and altruism inadvertently brings together several tribes of highly eccentric crazies (including multiple members of the Big Bad's faction), who've spent decades hating each other.
-   **Game of Thrones**: In complete contrast to his older brother Joffrey, Tommen wants to take the path of least bloodshed. Unfortunately, this makes him indecisive when the High Sparrow kidnaps his wife and later his mother since he does not want any blood on his hands.
-   Peter Petrelli of **Heroes** embodies this to a point that's almost Genre Blindness or even Idiot Ball. He's so sweet and trusting that he'll even cast his lot in with the villain if he has a convincing enough sob story.
-   Frank Pembleton from **Homicide: Life on the Street** is a lot meaner than most examples, but he truly believes that all life is equal and he puts massive amounts of dedication and effort into his cases, regardless of who the victim was in life. This doesn't at all make him pleasant to be around; Pembleton may view everyone as equals, but he's a misanthrope who has a rather dim view of people in general and he's very unpleasant to be around for anyone who doesn't share his philosophical views.
-   Typical personality trait of many primary Kamen Riders. Example include:
    -   Gentaro Kisaragi, **Kamen Rider Fourze**, who in his introduction stated his goal to befriend each and every single person in his new high school. This includes forgiving someone for throwing away a girl's love letter and being nice to the Jerk Jock "king" and Alpha Bitch "queen" of the school despite their harassment (both verbal **and** physical). He'll even do it with the Monster of the Week. You have to be really bad for him to refuse you a Last-Second Chance. He even extended his hand to several people who would probably be the last people to receive his handshake, such as the man who **killed him**, The Dragon who put two of his friends to the Dark Nebula and threatened death to the rest of his friends, and finally the Big Bad. This is the same Big Bad that **killed his best friend Kengo Utahoshi**. Pyxis, the guy who **is the reason Fourze has a Nightmare Fuel page** is the only person he's not extended a hand of friendship to.
    -   Emu Hojo is subtler than Gentaro, but has soon figured out that sometimes you have to deal some hard knocks if you want to be an All-Loving Hero in a crappy world like that of **Kamen Rider Ex-Aid**. He tries to bring out the best in people, gives them a chance, and puts up with their crap, but the lives of his patients always go first. Threaten them and he will knock you on your ass and **then** nicely ask you to repent. Repeatedly, if needed.
-   **LazyTown**: Sportacus always helps Robbie even after Robbie puts Sportacus in danger.
-   **Mister Rogers' Neighborhood**:
    -   Fred Rogers is famous for being one of the nicest people ever, both on his show and off. There's an urban legend about him that involves two punks stealing his car. When they realized it was **his** car, they returned it and included a note that read "we didn't know it was yours".
    -   A story widely told is that a fundamentalist priest/pastor/whatever called on Mr. Rogers to castigate a nearby group of homosexuals. Without missing a beat, Rogers turned to said people and said: "God loves you just the way you are."
-   Despite being an atoning petty criminal, Jerkass, and a Book Dumb hick, the titular character of **My Name Is Earl** has a real knack for getting along with people, is actively working hard to become a better person by righting all his past wrongs, in the process making his town a better place, and is willing to make great sacrifices for the people he cares about. Sometimes he relapses, but he brings up some interesting questions on morality and what makes a good person.
-   **NCIS** Played straight with Abby, with a couple exceptions (she thinks anyone who abuses children or animals is an evil scumbag.) One episode suggests she even loves **trees**.
-   Even though he has his jerk moments, Ned Bigby from **Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide** does not hate anybody, and he always gives advice to those in trouble, whether he or she is a student or a teacher. He hates letting people down so much that his bad habit in Guide to: Bad Habits was saying yes to everyone.
-   In **Once Upon a Time**, one of the strongest qualities Belle has is her ability/willingness to understand virtually everyone and find good in them. She goes with Rumplestiltskin to save her people from the Ogre Wars, and ends up falling in love with him and helping him reform eventually. She gives good advice to Mulan, encourages Dreamy the dwarf (though, given he ends up Grumpy, it didn't turn out well), spares Robin Hood's life when he's captured by Rumple, and even extends sympathy to a trapped young ogre who other people are willing to kill on sight.
-   **Oz**: Downplayed by Kareem Said. He's arrogant, prejudiced, and it takes a lot to get into his good graces, but he still tries to help any inmate who comes to him if he thinks they have a legitimate grievance no matter how diametrically opposed he is to their political views and lifestyles.
-   **Parks and Recreation** Leslie Knope is such a generous, thoughtful, hardworking person, and so beloved by her friends and co-workers, that she might as well be characterized as the All-Loving Hero from Pawnee.
-   **Person of Interest**: The Machine, the government supercomputer designed to stop terrorist threats before they happen, is so effective at its job because it cares for everyone. It values human life and free will above all else (which has actually caused several problems), and while it understands that sometimes its assets have no choice but to kill people, it never orders such things itself. Best demonstrated with Root, who was a sociopathic serial killer before the Machine started talking to her. By mid-Season 3, she's one of the best forces of good in the series who adheres to Thou Shalt Not Kill one hundred percent. Even when it helps her escape from a psych hospital and the government assassin sent to kill her, it stops her from killing anyone, including the assassin himself.
    
    **Root:** Seriously? Even this guy?  
    **\[Root's earpiece beeps\]**  
    **Root:** All right... I guess you're the boss...
    
-   **Sesame Street**: Abby Cadabby. Her faith in Oscar the Grouch's heart is unshakable.
-   Daniel Jackson in **Stargate** and **Stargate SG-1** is The Face of The Team. Whenever they met a new culture, he'd love to sit down and talk with them. Though he hates the Go'ald, his main beef with them is that they abducted his wife (and do likewise to others).
-   **Twin Peaks**: Albert strives to be one, and is an Actual Pacifist as a result, hence why he works as a medical examiner; it's one of the only jobs at the FBI where he can actively help people while never picking up a weapon. Although he is rude, abrasive, and cynical, Albert does take his path of nonviolence **very** seriously, refusing to even defend himself when his Sitcom Arch-Nemesis Truman has enough of his crap and tries to punch him in the face. He explains that the foundation of this choice is simply **love** for all of humanity. He then very sincerely says, "I love you, Sheriff Truman." Truman gains a lot more respect for him after that, and they reach an understanding.
-   The titular **Ultraman Cosmos** is rather noteworthy for this, as he explicitly only kills Kaiju if he ABSOLUTELY has no other choice — he'd rather get beat up trying to stop a rampaging monster so he can calm it down rather than harm them.
-   **Wonder Woman (1975)**: Wonder Woman almost always completely outclasses her opposition but restrains herself from fighting unless she has to. Additionally, she regularly seeks to reform the bad guys, regularly releases low-level Mooks who are unimportant, and perpetrators who evidence guilt and desire to not do evil are generally let off the hook. This behavior flows directly from the comics, in which she changed the way superheroes behaved in terms of rehabilitating criminals.

All-Loving Hero Example in Music

-   Hero, who is basically Jesus with a Divine Race Lift in a Setting Update.

-   Implied with the protagonist in Planet Perfecto — "Bullet In The Gun". In addition to saying "Til the end of all time, I'll be by your side", she says "Fight fire with fire, fight enemies with love."

All-Loving Hero Example in Professional Wrestling

-   Combine an all-loving personality with separation anxiety, bipolar disorder, delusion, split personalities and the strength to bend a man in two and you'd end up with something like Daffney Unger, where love leads to violence when it isn't "returned". Dr. Stevie's "treatment" did nothing to improve this.
-   Ricky Ruffin couldn't be himself without all of you, he thanks you all and loves you all with all his heart.
-   Bayley's gimmick on NXT, after getting over her starstruck phase, was automatically being the best friend she could be to everybody. She continued to act this way on the main roster until her heel turn.

All-Loving Hero Example in Psychology

-   Cognitive scientist Scott Barry Kaufman has proposed the Light Triad personality model, combining humanism, Kantianism, and faith in humanity. High scorers on humanism are likelier to value others' dignity and self-worth. High scorers on Kantianism are likelier to see others as people, not as a means to an end. High scorers of faith in humanity are likelier to believe others are fundamentally good. Individuals who score high on light triad traits also report higher levels of religiosity, spirituality, life satisfaction, acceptance of others, belief that they and others are good, compassion, empathy, self-esteem, authenticity, sense of self, positive enthusiasm, having a quiet ego, openness to experience, and conscientiousness. Additionally, those who score higher on the light triad scale are intellectually curious, secure in their attachments to others, and more tolerant of other perspectives. These individuals typically have fewer motives for achievement and self-enhancement (even though the light triad was positively related to productivity and competence).

All-Loving Hero Example in Radio

-   **Our Miss Brooks**: Connie Brooks is a kind and caring person, who frequently goes out of her way to help her friends, pupils and even perfect strangers. An example of the latter occurs in "The Burglar". Here, Connie catches a man breaking into the house and raiding the refrigerator. Instead of turning him in, Connie and Mrs. Davis share breakfast with the man and get him a job filling in for the school custodian.

All-Loving Hero Example in Religion and Mythology

-   Jainism. It's an entire religion that espouses **ahimsa** (non-violence), which is actually also a tenet of many Indian religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism, but whereas others limit the principle to humans, Jains include everything, literally: humans, cows, cats, snakes, mosquitoes, bees, bananas, palm, **bacteria**... Most Jains are vegetarians because they do not want to inflict violence on animals, and if it's detestable, then vegans. If even **that** is detestable, then they will abstain from eating root vegetables because they are life in early stages after all. Jains are also taught not to detest anyone simply because they have differing opinions regarding a subject (such as being in a different religion or world view) because every beliefs are true, just, well, in different viewpoints. However, Jains are also simultaneously taught **not** to be too attached to things and these include living ones, to prevent obsessive love, but instead have to do it equally; in essence, just like unconditional love (**agape**).
-   Guanyin from Buddhist and East Asian folklore. S/he's so utterly compassionate that it actually makes her/him awesome at what s/he does.
-   This is the defining trope for Jesus. The whole "love your enemies" thing is the most obvious. The times when we see Him angry are the ones where He's railing against those who fail to love anyone (other than themselves) and leading people astray with their lies. Christians believe that Isaiah 53:2-11 is a prophecy of His Heroic Sacrifice to shield humanity from their sins (which include **murdering** Him).
    
    **Amanda DeWitt:** \[Jesus\] practiced righteous anger. Even in his most passionate moments, he still exhibited perfect control. He never lashed out to protect himself. He never called down judgment to silence the opposition. He never pursued vengeance. Instead, his sternness was always meant to correct, purify, and instruct.
    
-   Universal love was a defining feature of the ancient Chinese philosophy of Mohism. Mozi, the founder of Mohism, went so far as to say that we should not act preferentially even towards our own family, because we are all equal under heaven; this was a major point of contention in debate with their major rival, the Confucians.
-   The goddess Hestia in Classical Mythology was loved and respected by the other gods, as she loved and respected all of them even those with a bad reputation as Ares or Eris. When Priapus tried to rape her, all other Olympians rushed in to protect her and beat him off Olympus.

All-Loving Hero Example in Tabletop Games

-   **Forgotten Realms**: The god Ilmater. The first sentence of his catechism is "Help all who hurt, no matter who they are."
-   **Nobilis**: Both Devils and Deceivers explore why loving **absolutely everything** is not necessarily a virtuous trait. The Devils love the laughter of children and the beauty of a sunset... but they also love cancer and genocide. In fact, they love cancer and genocide **more**, because who else is going to love them? As for the Deceivers... to make a long explanation short, let's just say that love doesn't have to be sane or healthy.
-   **In Nomine**: Novalis, Archangel of Flowers, is, as a function of the Word she embodies, endlessly loving and forgiving. She is willing to see the best in anybody, up to and including the Princes of Hell, and steadfastly believes that the War can and should be won by changing hearts instead of at the point of a sword.

-   **Pathfinder**:
    -   Shelyn is a Friend to All Living Things and the setting's divine embodiment of love, kindness, and both inner and outer beauty.
    -   Sarenrae sees the potential for good in everyone and redemption is a big part of her dogma, but she's a bit more militant than Shelyn.
    -   The empyreal lord Korada is endlessly empathic and forgiving, and believes that all creatures, even the vilest villains and fiends, can be convinced to see the light and accept goodness into their hearts.
-   Nurgle, the Chaos God of disease and decay from **Warhammer** and **Warhammer 40,000**, is an atypical **villainous** example of this trope. Nurgle holds a deep, paternal love for all living things... which, unfortunately for most people, includes bacteria and parasites. Nurgle loves every living thing equally and can't just kill those couple thousand bacteria that live within a sick person. That would be something-cide!

All-Loving Hero Example in Toys

-   Mata Nui of the **BIONICLE** franchise, as befitting the franchise's analogue to God. He's introduced in **The Legend Reborn** apologizing to a beetle he almost stepped on, and later jumps into a gladiatorial arena to save someone he didn't even know despite the fact that A) he was stuck in a body he wasn't used to, B) the only weapons he had on him were the aforementioned beetle and a broken stinger he picked up, and C) him falling in combat might have **spelled out the end of the universe**.

All-Loving Hero Example in Visual Novels

-   **CLANNAD** series has got a lot of characters who can be classified as such, including:
    -   Sanae, who seems to support emotionally almost everyone who has problems.
    -   Kotomi is another example. She doesn't seem to hate anyone, especially after she gets rid of her fears.

-   **Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc**: People Makoto **can** befriend include a traumatized writer with a persecution complex, a delinquent biker, a Child Soldier, a strict disciplinarian with No Social Skills, an intimidating (but gentle) martial artist, and an emotionally distant detective. The people he **can't** befriend are a Jerkass elitist, a Serial Killer, and the Big Bad\- and even then, he tries to understand them and even wants to Save the Villain. The sequel takes it further, as he tries to redeem Junko's Ultimate Despair cult because they were ordinary Hope's Peak students before she brainwashed them, and in the end, with a little help from Hajime, he succeeeds.
-   **Dies Irae**:
    -   The girl of the guillotine, Marie, remains an ever-present source of love due to her desire to just be able to embrace everyone around her, something she had been denied of for her entire life due to the guillotines curse. This goes on to the point that she ascends to godhood and becomes known as the omnibenevolent goddess, someone who embraces everyone and gives them all a second chance regardless of what kind of person they happen to be.
    -   An unusual example with Reinhard. Unusual in that he is the Big Bad yet still remaining all loving to all. However, he also has a case of Blue-and-Orange Morality as he sees love and destruction as the same thing.
        
        **Reinhard:** My love shall take the form of destruction. I shall ravage so I can cherish. I adore the weak that bow before me, as well as the defeated that bend their knees. My love expands to the vassals that rebel, and those that mean me harm. I love all and everything. And so shall I lay waste to everything before me.
        
-   **Fate/stay night**: Emiya Shirou can only feel happy by seeing or making other people happy. This is actually presented as a character flaw: Shirou places no value on his own life except insofar as his life can benefit others, he cannot live for his own sake, and his desire to protect and save absolutely everyone often brings him more grief than happiness, and in at least one timeline he winds up a Broken Hero whose greatest desire is to kill himself.
-   Kyle Hyde of **Hotel Dusk: Room 215** is something of an All-Loving Hero who never planned to be. He only goes to the titular hotel on business with his company, Red Crown, and possibly to get a lead on the man he's been pursuing for three years, Brian Bradley. It turns out that all the other patrons of the hotel all have big problems tied to the hotel, Bradley, and the art theft organization he joined, Nile, including manager Dunning Smith, pining for his kidnapped daughter; Jeff Damon, who ran away from home with money and a gun after getting sick of his father's shady legal dealings; Kevin Woodward, trying to get his head around his malpractice suit and his wife somehow (through Nile) producing the money for a settlement; Helen Parker, searching for her lost son who loved to frequent the hotel; Martin Summer, who plagiarized that son's text for a novel and led to his disappearance and others. Through the course of one night at Hotel Dusk, Kyle Hyde manages to "take out \[all of their\] garbage" with evidence, questioning, and occasional tough love, and give them the strength to keep working to resolve their problems. He doesn't even want to arrest the person he's looking for despite what he did, he just wants to ask him "why?".
-   Yuichi Aizawa and Ayu Tsukimiya from **Kanon**. The former goes out of his way to help the girls he befriends with their problems, and the latter is the one who gives everyone a chance to live happily (aside from Makoto, who is already dead, but implied to have been reborn as the fox she used to be).
-   Ami, the protagonist's adorable little cousin from **Spirit Hunter: NG**, is shown to be incredibly nice and forgiving towards others. She's quick to befriend Maruhashi despite his scary appearance, and even shows concern for the driver of a car that nearly killed her.

All-Loving Hero Example in Web Animation

-   **Dreamscape**: Ahjeen is a very nice guy who wants to make friends with everybody.
-   **RWBY**: In the Remnant fairytale of the Story of the Seasons, an old reclusive wizard is helped to come out of his shell by four sisters, improving his life for the better. When the Old Wizard asks them what made him so special that they'd go out of their way to help him, they tell him he's not special at all: he was a person in need of help, so they helped him, as they help every single person they come across. He is so impressed with their compassion, he gives them the gift of his magical powers so that the sisters can use them to help humanity.

All-Loving Hero Example in Webcomics

-   Eggie from the **Adventures With Eggie** is this. She sang songs for money, so that she could buy a cow away from its neglectful owner. She also gets along nicely with children. She even compliments a shady character, Anthony Asslord, on his name.
-   Luntsha is shaping up to be this in **Anecdote of Error**. Nothing less than this trope would even consider breaking a dangerous enemy combatant out of prison, after they assaulted them, just because the enemy was holding back.
-   End from **Beyond the End** is this. He gives everyone a chance; angels, demons, and everything in between. Suspicious or not, he loves them all the same. He won't even question Michael casting him down from Heaven without telling him why he did so, nevermind hate him for it.
-   In **El Goonish Shive**, "good" Tom seems to be this. According to Word of God: he isn't the least bit manipulative, his extracurricular school activities all benefit society and raise awareness in some way, he's rescued at least three puppies from various situations, he will never judge you, he will always listen, and he's just an all-around good guy.
-   Fenic from **Goodbye to Halos**. She openly asks "Is it weird if I want to love everyone?"
-   Rachael from **Guilded Age** takes this as a mantra and mission statement, vowing to "Love everyone equally." She's later forced to admit this is impossible (Scipio pointed out that this would mean she'd love her enemies just as much her True Companions) and that coming up with that "philosophy" was basically a panic move in the face of a Relationship Upgrade with E-Merl.
-   **Homestuck**:
    -   John Egbert. He not only treats his various friends and allies incredibly well but also constantly tries to make friends with his enemies and the Trolls (who initially start out insulting and annoying the Kids rather than helping them). He almost never starts a fight and is intensely trusting of others; indeed the only two characters he's genuinely antagonistic towards are Bec Noir and Lord English, two of the three most evil characters in the comic. At first, this is deconstructed by showing how naïve and easily tricked he is (we're shown an alternate timeline where Terezi somehow convinced him it was a good idea to attack a boss five times more powerful than him which predictably led to his death) but it's later reconstructed as these very traits allow him to help, support, and lead his allies and friends.
    -   Jade Harley also qualifies, despite having a considerably shorter fuse than John. She actually forgave the abovementioned Bec for killing one of her best friends and didn't blame the Tavros for killing her grandfather, due to misunderstanding. In fact, she spends most of the "Collide" trying to stop a fight between Bec and PM, using the fact, that both of them can't kill her, due to her pet dog's consciousness inside their minds.
-   Acheron/Kayn'dar in **Inverloch**. The story is too short to let this trait really bloom, but the signs are all there. He insists on being polite to everyone and trusting everyone until proven otherwise, even **the thief who tried to steal from him**, and that is despite being raised as the Proud Warrior Race Guy and experiencing Fantastic Racism all the time. The resolution of the Happy Ending doesn't hurt too.

-   Brian from **Think Before You Think** is an example. He goes out of his way to save a girl he just met from suicide, and he is just generally nice to everyone he encounters.

---
All-Loving Hero Example in Web Original

-   Sometimes downplayed Depending on the Writer, but Jenny Everywhere's multiversal perspective means that for any given enemy she encounters, there's a universe out there where they're her best friend. As a result, she is often depicted as having little to no personal animosity toward her enemies, and wanting to redeem them if possible. This does not mean she will flinch at doing what is necessary if that's not an option, mind you.
-   SCP-999 of the **SCP Foundation**. It loves everything and wants to bring joy to everyone no matter who or what they are. Not even an Omnicidal Maniac Eldritch Abomination is too horrible for it to love unconditionally.
-   Lindsay Doe from **Sexplanations** (a YouTube channel about sex) is one of the nicest and most open-hearted people on the site. She even has compassion for pedophiles as long as they haven't actually hurt a kid and want to change themselves, as they can't control how they feel.

---
All-Loving Hero Example in Web Videos

-   Nana from **Cream Heroes.** She's the most affectionate cat of the group, even bringing the likes of Coco and TT out of their shells. She's so affectionate that Claire wonders if she had another family previously given how much she loves being petted.

---
All-Loving Hero Example in Western Animation

-   Avatar Aang from **Avatar: The Last Airbender**. He just wants to befriend everyone and takes his role as peacekeeper very seriously, being one of the few people who are willing to give the Fire Nation a chance to redeem themselves.
-   **Batman: The Animated Series**: This version of Batman is like this, which is surprising given his usual characterization. In addition to his Thou Shalt Not Kill rule, he pretty much always at least tries to Save the Villain, and often shows compassion towards the more sympathetic criminals (such as trying to catch Harley Quinn without hurting her when he realizes she's just scared and confused, or offering to pay for Harvey Dent's plastic surgery, or trying to find a cure for Clayface's condition.)
-   The title character of **Camp Lazlo** is friendly and polite to everyone in the show, often promoting peace and love among his fellow scouts. He sees the Squirrel Scouts as friends even though they generally look down on the Bean Scouts and he does the same to Jerkasses like Lumpus and Edward who openly loathe him. Lazlo even displays the same kind of cheer to dangerous animals, unsafe objects, and places as poorly-run as Camp Kidney, except Edward’s brothers.
-   **Dinosaur Train**: Owing to Buddy being adopted by Pteranodons, he is quite open-minded, friendly, and idealistic. He tries to make friends with and understand every character in the series.
-   One of the most enduring traits of Felix the Cat throughout his series is his kind-hearted, altruistic nature; if someone, man or animal, is in need of aid, be it standing in for a baseball player who got wrongfully thrown in jail, saving a clown from shooting himself, or overthrowing an evil dictator and his army of robots, he will never hesitate to help, and he shows virtually no signs of maliciousness or vengefulness (although he was a lot more rascally in his silent cartoons). At most, he just gets agitated at someone whenever they wrong him. He even holds no ill will towards his arch-enemy, the Professor, and even helps him out if he winds up in trouble. The **only** person he shows any hate for is his arch-nemesis Master Cylinder, which should speak volumes of the cyborg's character. The Van Beuren Felix plays this trait up even more; in the opening of "The Goose That Laid the Golden Egg", Felix is handing out gold coins by the bucketful to the local poor, thanks to the help of his golden goose and her endless supply of golden eggs. And when the goose gets kidnapped by Captain Kid, her eggs are the last thing on Felix's mind — he's genuinely concerned for her safety, and he even tries to put up a fight against the pirate before he captures her.
-   **Futurama** has Fry and Zoidberg who, despite their habit of being kind of incompetent, are good-natured and very loyal fellows. Zoidberg is willing to give up his own happiness to help others, and will happily help out folks like Hermes even if they make it clear that they just don't like him (as seen in "The Six-Million Dollar Mon").
-   In **God, the Devil and Bob**, Bob spends most of one episode thinking that he's immortal because he's God's "special guy". In the end, God tells him **everyone** is his "special guy".
-   Mabel Pines of **Gravity Falls** plays this trope straight, whereas her twin brother Dipper Pines downplays it. She holds no ill will towards Pacifica even though she's a jerk to her, and tries being nice to her in return (especially shown in "The Golf War"). In general, she claims she doesn't need revenge to prove anything, she's nice and friendly to everyone and regarding her parties, everyone is invited!
-   Arnold Shortman of **Hey Arnold!**. He's a good-natured kid who's Wise Beyond Their Years to the point where adults seek him for advice. If one of his classmates has a problem, he is more than willing to help, and if an episode's protagonist gets laughed at for something by everyone, he's usually the only kid not laughing. Really, he's the sweetest, the most innocent and nicest guy on the show. He even constantly endures Helga's bullying, no matter how bad it is. His kindness is also the reason she's secretly obsessed with him in the first place (which isn't really that surprising, actually.)
-   **Jimmy Two-Shoes**, similar to Pinkie Pie below, is on good terms with just about everyone in Miseryville and is able to bring out the best in even the evilest of people, like Heloise. The only person who he can't get to like him is Lucius, and certainly not for lack of trying.
-   **Kaeloo**: The perpetually cheerful Kaeloo, who sees everyone as her friend (including people who find her incredibly annoying) and will forgive almost anything, and will even make it a point to be nice to non-living things.
-   **Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts**: Kipo Oak's first instinct in any situation is to try and make friends, even with people who clearly want her dead.
-   **The Legend of Korra**: Avatar Korra becomes an All-Loving Hero with time, learning to empathize with even her enemies.

-   **My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic**:
    -   The series' protagonist Twilight Sparkle is characterized by her seemingly limitless capability to forgive others, regardless of what harm they've done to her and willingness to see good in everypony.
    -   Pinkie Pie wants to be friends with everyone. If they hate her at first, she won't stop trying to get them to like her. All she wants is to make you smile!<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
    -   Fluttershy acts like this as well, mainly towards animals but she does end up getting Discord to do a Heel–Face Turn because of her kindness.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
    -   Princess Celestia also deserves mention for being a Universally Beloved Leader, by sheer virtue of being kind to everypony. Just don't push it, as she has a breaking point and **will** throw somepony into Tartarus or exile them with a curse if that's what it takes to protect her subjects from them.
    -   Spike likes everyone. Not everypony, but everyONE. He invited Discord to he and Big Mac's event purely because he felt bad that the guy's only friend was leaving for a bit and has since gone on to be one of Discord's few genuine friends outside of Fluttershy, and he had zero hesitation about trusting and befriending the changeling Thorax, an act that led to saving Equestria via a Heel–Race Turn.
-   **PAW Patrol**: Ryder loves his dogs more than anything in the world and is a friend to all, even extending helping hands to the villains when they need it.
-   **Ready Jet Go!**: Jet, being new to Earth, loves **everything** about it, and is nice to everyone, including Mitchell Peterson, who is out to expose his alien identity.
-   Terrifyingly deconstructed with Daemon from **Reboot**, a saintly and kind-hearted virus who believes that all people are inherently good deep down and wants to bring about world peace... by taking psionic control of every living thing in the Net and forcing them to commit mass suicide, because All Are Equal in Death. Her cheery, sweet-hearted nice girl persona is **not** an act; she's genuinely just **so** insanely all-loving and maternally protective that she would rather destroy the world than see her "loved ones" suffer in any way from the realities of life.
-   **Rick and Morty**: Morty Smith is a living Deconstruction of the trope. No matter how hard he tries, he inevitably gets dragged into situations in which people (sometimes innocent people) get killed. In "Mortynight Run", he tries to save the life of an imprisoned living gas that Rick names "Fart". Not only does he accidentally kill the assassin but by freeing the gas he causes a dangerous chase sequence that kills several cops and Fart uses its abilities to kill several more as well as a handful of innocent bystanders. In the end, Morty kills the gas when he realizes it plans to lead an invasion that will purge the universe of all carbon-based life.
    -   Additionally, his naiveté regarding the multiverse and the potential dangers within it constantly puts him in harm's way, a major example being an adventure in a fairy tale world where an encounter with an anthropomorphic jellybean takes a dark turn when the jellybean attempts to violently rape him.
    -   In fact, by Season 3, he has come to see his soft-heartedness and conscience as a weakness (seen when it manifested itself in Toxic Morty). As such, without it, he is energetic, chipper and happy, while also a Patrick Bateman-styled sociopath.
-   **She-Ra and the Princesses of Power**:
    -   Adora is righteous, kind and willing to give second chances to anyone as long as they prove to be deserving of it and trying to be better. She strives to be a beacon of hope for the people around her and will do the right thing no matter the personal cost. The only people she doesn't even bother giving the time of day are pretty much irredeemable like Horde Prime and Shadow Weaver, with the former being a genocidal warmonger who has destroyed many worlds during his reign and the latter having acted as an AbusiveParents to Catra and Adora in the Horde and manipulated them since they were children.
    -   Entrapta, in spite of her love for war machines, treats everyone well, no matter if they belong to the Horde or the Rebellion. In Season 5, when she meets Catra again - after the cat electrocuted her and sent her to die at Beast Island, Entrapta doesn't go beyond scaring Catra with her tools, but forgives her when the cat apologizes. It is her kindness that gets Hordak to have a Heel–Face Turn and go against his brainwashing to save her life.
-   **Sofia the First**: Sofia is a kind, caring and polite young girl, who also tends to see the good in others.
-   **South Park**:
    -   Leopold "Butters" Stotch. In a world known for Idiotic Sociopaths, Cynical Anti Heroes, and Villain Protagonists. Butters gets to serve as the most enduring Nice Guy in the series helping and saving the people he cares for and even people who hate him and want him to suffer.
    -   Gary Harrison. Despite being just a One-Shot Character, he is probably the nicest character in the entire series, able to forgive teasing and even threats, and see the good side to everything. Ditto for his family, and, it is implied, all Mormons, as they are also the only people righteous enough to get into heaven in the world of South Park.
-   Spider-Man in **Spider-Man: The New Animated Series**: Not as much as other versions, but he frequently offers enemies he knows personally like Electro, Talon, and the Lizard the chance to stop and turn back. They never listen.
-   Peri of **Spliced**. He is always quick to forgive Entrée for the abuse his supposed best friend heaps upon him, no matter how awful, respects Joe and considers him a "great guy" even though Joe is constantly punishing him for the chaos he causes and is the only person on the island who doesn't hate or fear the show's Big Bad, Mister Smarty Smarts. He has even tried to befriend the Wunny Sharbit, a being which ordinarily terrifies everyone, and with good reason\-and it **worked**. For a few minutes at least.
-   SpongeBob SquarePants. Sure, he may be found annoying due to his limited comprehension of people's personal space (especially Squidward's), but there's absolutely no malicious intents in his actions. He's very friendly towards everyone, helpful, very optimistic (partly due to his naïvete) and wants nothing but everyone to be happy. There's a reason why the townsfolk prefer him over Squidward and Mr. Krabs.
-   **Steven Universe**:
    -   Steven Quartz Universe himself, who apparently inherited it from his mother, Rose Quartz, aka Pink Diamond. It is often this quality that makes the difference in the Crystal Gems' battles, as it has allowed Steven to befriend Gems, such as Lapis Lazuli or Peridot, that might otherwise have been foes. He's also been shown to empathize with the monstrous corrupted Gems that are often the Monster of the Week. He has a hard time dealing with instances when his all-loving nature was not enough to resolve a conflict, such as the final episodes of Season 3 where Steven saw his help refused or had to fight in self-defense. The sole exception being Kevin, who is so unrepentantly disrespectful towards everyone that he is the only person, Gem or human, who Steven outright **hates**.
    -   Steven's father Greg is a minor example: Greg is unwilling to genuinely hold a grudge against anyone and doesn't like the idea of Steven hating anyone, to the point where he treats "hate" like a curse word.

-   **Total Drama**:
    -   Lindsay is immensely nice to everyone she meets, even Heather, though that changes after her Break the Cutie moment in "That's Off The Chain".
    -   Dawn is kind and empathetic to everyone due to her Aura Vision and tries to find the good in everyone, even Scott. However, she makes an exception with him when she finds out his true nature.
    -   Ella cannot bring herself to do anything even remotely violent or cruel and is thus mortified when she's tasked with delivering a mild electric shock to the opposite team for a challenge.
-   **Transformers**: No matter the version, one of Optimus Prime's most defining elements is his profound compassion and respect for all living things.
-   **Ultimate Spider-Man (2012)**: Not so much in Season 1, but Spider-Man begins to show it in Season 2 onwards, with it only becoming more pronounced with each passing season. So much so that he's willing to forgive and even befriend people who previously tried to kill him depending on the circumstance. Good examples include welcoming Cloak and Dagger onto his team with open arms despite them having been on Taskmaster's due to having seen good in them previously. There's also his genuine belief that Sandman and Rhino can do good as long as they have a guiding hand, and that Norman can grow into a decent human being if he just tries. Furthermore his desire to help Vulture despite the trouble the avian hybrid has caused, his mentoring of Agent Venom despite his bad history with both the symbiote and its current host, and his ability to understand why Rhino would betray the team for a chance to be normal again all while not holding a grudge towards any of them. The best part? It works more often than not. Unfortunately, this works against him as Doc Ock and Scarlet Spider use a fake pity story so Peter would sympathize with him enough to reveal his identity. However, Ben later admits to Peter that this trope is "his greatest strength". This is true as his compassion has redeemed a lot of people, including Ben himself.
-   Spoofed on **Uncle Grandpa** with The Dirtbag, a slovenly, sleazy-looking old man... who, despite his questionable hygiene and appearance, is a poetic soul with nothing but love and kindness for everyone and everything in his heart.
-   Wander, the hero of **Wander over Yonder** is a textbook example. He is friendly to everyone, even the baddies. His best friend and steed Sylvia is a little harder-nosed. Averted in the episode "The Boy Wander", where Wander engages in combat (in a banjo vs. accordion battle) with Dr. Screwball Jones, due to him allegedly being a villain eviler than Lord Dominator.
-   Grizz from **We Bare Bears** tends to be this at times.
