Bunnies for Cuteness: 
With their long ears, twitchy noses, and rounded fluffy bodies, bunnies are often used in media to invoke feelings of sweetness, innocence, childishness and general cuteness. Real rabbits can be used for this, but so can stuffed rabbits or other types of toy rabbits or rabbit related accessories. Characters meant to be viewed as cute might have a rabbit-related Animal Motif. Very energetic personalities and Nice Guy (or Nice Girl) personalities are often common with these characters.

Stuffed bunnies might also be used to invoke the concept of children caught in a horrific situation if used in an Empathy Doll Shot. Contrast Hair-Raising Hare and Killer Rabbit, and compare Playboy Bunny.

Not to be confused with Bridge Bunnies.

-   **Ouran High School Host Club** uses a bunny motif for the "Boy Lolita" character Honey to help establish his identiy as the cute character of the Host Club. He frequently carries a stuffed rabbit called "Usa-chan", uses a "bunny kick" as one of his martial arts moves, and is himself sometimes compared to a rabbit.

-   **Fruits Basket** has Momiji, who is possessed by the Spirit of the Rabbit. He's the only Member of the Zodiac who really embraces his Zodiac form, as evidenced by the bunny plushies, bunny hoodies, bunny backpacks, bunny stationary, and being the first male Juunishi to hug Tohru on purpose. Somewhat subverted, though, since he's actually one of the most emotionally mature of the Sohmas (even though he looks like the youngest).
-   Bokko/Captain Bunny<small>◊</small> from Osamu Tezuka's "The Amazing 3" is an older example in Anime/Manga going as far back as 1965. She was voiced by Corrine Orr in the English Dub.
-   This is one contributor of **Is the Order a Rabbit?**'s cuteness; the town is literally full of cute bunnies. Businesses also often have "rabbit" in their names.
-   Sanrio is fond of this trope. As of 2008, there are three anime shows that star talking rabbits. Such as My Melody, Ruby and The Sugarbunnies. In 2010, a new Sanrio character series was created called "Wish Me Mell"<small>◊</small> which stars a friendly rabbit named "Mell" who is meant to be a character that expresses the feelings every one has, simply stating "Thank you", "I am sorry" or "I like you!", connecting hearts in the process. While the character hasn't gotten an anime series yet, she's pretty popular in Japan to the point that Sanrio even gave her an official a Facebook,Twitter, and Vine account. There's also BonBonRibbon<small>◊</small> that was created in 2012. Who is another rabbit character. Let's just say, Sanrio really loves rabbits.
-   Iyo one of the talking stuffed animals from<small>◊</small> **Animal Yokocho**.

    -   There are also the Sweetspets Eclan and Macaronia.

Bunnies for Cuteness Example in Fan Works

-   In the **Total Drama Island** reimagining, **The Legend of Total Drama Island**, the gentle and inoffensive D.J. finds and adopts a bunny during the camping challenge, as per canon; but where the original played the trope more or less straight, the reimagining subverts the trope when the bunny's grisly demise triggers a conflict storyline.
-   Khilari's **Everything's Better With Bunnies** is based off this trope: it's an AU where Loki involuntarily shapeshifts into a bunny whenever he's upset.
-   Shampoo's Badass Adorable credentials get pushed up a notch in **Voyages of the Wild Sea Horse** after she eats a Zoan-type Devil Fruit; the Rabbit-Rabbit Fruit. It actually merges with her pre-existing Jusenkyo Spring of Drowned Cat curse and causes her to turn into a **cabbit**, which is noted to be utterly adorable. Even Ranma, utterly terrified of cats, think Shampoo is too cute to be scary in this form. But she can still kick all the ass she needs to.

-   Deconstructed in **Zootopia**. In Zootopia, this is the widely acknowledged stereotype of bunnies, though only other bunnies can call bunnies cute, and Judy gives the Innocently Insensitive Clawhauser a friendly reminder of this. Fans speculate that non-bunnies calling bunnies cute means their personal merits, their intelligence in particular, aren't being valued.

Bunnies for Cuteness Example in Films — Live-Action

-   In **8 Mile**, B. Rabbit's friends insist that his name is because of his speedy rapping and promiscuity, but it's later revealed to be the pet name his mother gave him for his big ears, buck teeth and extreme cuteness. Later in the movie, she gushes over his cute face and tells him that he'll always be her little bunny rabbit.
-   **Cool World**:
    -   Double subverted with an unnamed bunny character seen gambling with Holli's goons. He/she is one of the only doodles who look sane compared to the others, but does go Hair-Raising Hare mode on the doodle police officers when they ignore seeing him/her cry about getting cheated by said goons. By climbing up on one officer's face. The bunny then goes "Pretty Please", starting the chase scene with the cops and goons.
    -   The mother bunnies children also fit this trope, despite only having a brief scene prior to Holli and Jack's sex scene.
-   Roger Rabbit from **Who Framed Roger Rabbit** can be this sometimes, especially in his cartoon shorts, but you don't want to get on his bad side when something personal happens.

-   The little-known **Emily the Rabbit** books by Claire Masurel and Susan Calitri has the adorable-beyond-words titular character. No relations to D.W.'s classmate who shares the same name and species.

-   **Guess How Much I Love You** by Sam McBratney and Anita Jeram—another childhood classic.
-   **Abigail** from Hallmark's line of Interactive Story Buddies toy and book series.

-   Rosemary Wells is fond of bunny characters in her books. **Max and Ruby**, **Bunny Planet**, and **Read To Your Bunny** are great examples.
-   The covers of some editions of **Watership Down** may have vaguely implied this. The actual story, on the other hand...
-   **The Velveteen Rabbit** is a stuffed rabbit, but still evokes this.

Bunnies for Cuteness Example in Music

-   **Doctor Steel** flirted with adorkableness once; after visiting a music website whose anime-inspired animation seemed to consist of "Tiny Little Bunnies Eating Hamburgers", he wrote a song about it.
-   In the video for **Ladytron's Ghosts**, many rabbits add cuteness to imagery that would otherwise be quite dark. It's in context a Shout-Out to **Watership Down**, as one of the lyrics alludes to "prince of a thousand enemies".
-   Snuggle Bunny (Schnuffel) is one of Jamba!'s more well-known mascots. He's a cute little gray and white lop eared rabbit who sings adorable, Chipmunks\-eqsue songs, many of which are very catchy.
    -   A few years later, Jamster created a second bunny character named Snuggelina (Schnuffelienchen) who is Snuggle's girlfriend and both really love each other.<small>◊</small> There are two songs by Snuggelina that mainly focuses on her relationship with Snuggle both in German and English while one is her singing about a Butterfly.
-   K-pop girl group **NewJeans** apparently LOVES this trope so much that there's a **huge metric ton** of rabbit imagery in their albums, music videos, and merchandise. Now, where to begin...
    -   Their bunny mascot (shown on four of the album covers) is possibly the most famous of the subject. If we want to described it, it's a rabbit drawn in a 90s-style cartoon roller-skating, complete with a heart symbol in each of her eyes. Made even cuter when there's now an animated picture of the same bunny happily hopping up and down<small>◊</small>, and its two hands were holding what was now the said girl group's official lightstick.
        -   But wait, there's more! Now there's also this image<small>◊</small>, featuring the same bunny, cutely blowing up a candle of a cake, smiling as the flame on top of it went out.
        -   And apparently, the bunny mascot has 5 other colored versions of the mascot, with each of them representing each of the members. The yellow bunny represents Minji, the pink bunny represents Hanni, the green bunny represents Danielle, the blue bunny represents Hyein, and the generic white represents Haerin. It's worth noting that the aforementioned colored bunnies were present in each of the members' individual "New Jeans Bluebook" albums.
        -   The 5 bunnies also first appear in a teaser of the said group debuting soon at that time, as shown in this GIF.<small>◊</small>
        -   And guess what! They also finally got a short animation of them, entitled "Let's Make A Cake Together". And be warned, this video contains TONS of cuteness. It starts off with the green rabbit holding a giant strawberry, followed by the white rabbit carrying stars (and what was speculated to be sprinkles). It later cuts to the pink rabbit.....who was actually not helping at all and is busy eating the cream. Then there's a blue rabbit, who effortlessly manages to bring a giant candle, **while the top is still flaming**, and the yellow bunny is also shown cheering her friends. And near the end of the short, it reveals a super adorable cake resembling a giant bunny. The rabbits celebrated the hard work as they circled around the cake, except for the pink rabbit, who was still busy eating and didn't care about the whole situation that was happening surrounding her.
    -   The bunny caps that were worn by the group members in the "OMG" music video. Enough said.
        -   Speaking of the "OMG" music video, the girl group collaborated with a popular cafe named Nudake, to promote the new single released around December (and for a limited time). In this collaboration, Nudake released 5-colored rabbit-shaped mini cakes, complete with a red heart in the middle of the heads that was certainly too cute to eat. At that event, they also released many Christmas-themed items, and it also features their bunny mascot (again), but this time, wearing a scarf and can be seen riding on Santa's sleigh on one of their items.
        -   Also related to the latest album above, the official website of the girl group used to have a feature where it shows a house in the middle of a snowy landscape, and in front of it shows a realistic baby rabbit (and it also moves), which is adorable enough. One of the cutest parts of the website features a bunny snowman, in the middle of the card, which also has writing at the bottom that says "Winter Comes". As the card was clicked, it shows an interactive DIY card that lets you decorate a digital replica of the aforementioned Nudake bunny cake, which you can choose in 5 different colors and put cake toppers on. As you finish your card, it starts displaying your finished cake while a snippet of "Ditto" is played in the background.
        -   The website also used to have an interactive camera where it lets you take a picture of yourself, and decorate your photo with adorable, yet realistic bunny silhouettes and of course, the five-colored bunny mascots.
    -   Around the time the girl group released their latest album "Get Up", Line Friends started a collaboration with them and released what was possibly **one of their most adorable creations**. Ladies and gents, say hello to the "Bunnies"!
    -   In Coca-Cola's music video "Be Who You Are (Real Magic)", the girls are seen piloting a auper adorable humongous rabbit mecha, and also seen accompanied with rabbit-eared camera bots, which was also pretty cute.

Bunnies for Cuteness Example in Video Games

-   **Jumping Flash!**: Robbit himself. Because why else would you be a robotic space rabbit?
-   **Doom**: Used for humorous effect in the episode "Thy Flesh Consumed". The finale of the original campaign saw Doomguy heading home to earth to find it overrun by demons. As if the invasion itself wasn't bad enough, they even killed his pet rabbit Daisy and stuck her head on a spike. And if you thought Doomguy was mad at the demons **before**...
-   In the **Touhou Project** series, we have the Spin-Off Yonkoma manga **Inaba of the Moon and Inaba of the Earth**, which is filled with cute bunnies. This page is just one of the many examples.
-   The Pokémon Buneary, Azumarill, Bunnelby, Scorbunny and Lopunny to an extent. Averted with Diggersby.
-   In **True Love Junai Monogatari**, one of the items in the Hidden Shop is a rabbit pendant. You should buy it if you want to romance Remi Himekawa, who will ask for it if she sees it.
-   **Power Pete**: The Fuzzy Bunnies, which escaped from a cage in the Stuffed Animal Zoo (which is in the Doll Department of the Toy Mart) and scattered throughout the store, prompting the title character to escape from his packaging and set off to round them back up and return them to their proper place.
-   **Reader Rabbit**: Especially the late 90s redesign.
-   **Sonic the Hedgehog**: Cream the Rabbit. Polite, shy and kind, it's no wonder that she has a Broken Base in the Sonic fandom — one faction loves her for her Moe qualities, while the other doesn't like how she ranks the cutesy factor off the charts.
-   **The Legendary Starfy**: There's an entire SPECIES of them on Planet Bunnera. They even have magical shapeshifting powers!
-   In **Ensemble Stars!**, this is naturally the theme of the unit Ra\*bits, which has a cute, sailor-suited, youthful look. Nazuna in particular is associated with bunnies - the kanji in his surname means 'two rabbits' (he even draws them as bunnies in his signature) and he has pet rabbits at home - and he is often called cute by the other characters, much to his irritation given that he is a third year and would rather be treated as a Big Brother Mentor.
-   The Mascot Mook for the **World of Mana** is a small, yellow, limbless lagomorph known as a Rabite. While adorable beyond measure, they are usually newbie fodder and don't pose much of a threat... so long as their fur isn't colored black.
-   **Snuggle**: There's Snuggle himself, the rabbit with big eyes who always makes cutesy facial expressions.
-   A bunny mask serves to help indicate Neon Violet from **Neon White** as a cutesy, upbeat, childish girl, in contrast to Neon White's demonic mask.
-   The **Galaxy Angel** gameverse has space rabbits aboard the Elsior, which Vanilla often plays with. She even adopts one for herself though it sadly dies of old age, leaving her heartbroken.
-   Bianca from the **Spyro the Dragon** series is a rabbit mage who is considered quite cute by the other characters. In her first appearance in **Spyro: Year of the Dragon**, she does try to present herself as a Hair Riasing Hare, but instead comes off as Endearing Dorky, thanks to her status as a Minion with an F in Evil. Particularly noticable is halfway through the Evening Lake worlds, where she undergoes a Heel–Face Turn with accompanying Good Costume Switch, part of the change being taking down her hood to show off her rabbit ears, presumably to make her look cuter to the viewers.

-   In **Penny and Aggie**, when Sara gushes over how "cuuuuute" she finds the title characters as a couple, dancing bunny faces appear around her head.
-   A rare dramatic example in **El Goonish Shive**. At one point late into a story arc Susan angsts majorly and begins to awaken magical powers, which are about to go haywire. Jerry the Immortal manages to cast serenity magic to calm her down, which manifests itself as cute, fluffy animals surrounding her, two of which are bunnies.
-   The whole point of **Scenes from a Multiverse**'s Bunnies Planet, in the Zones of Adorable.
-   In **Unfamiliar**, Planchette has a cute bunny familiar named Winston, who’s as adorable as he is a Deadpan Snarker.

-   Subverted (in a non-Hair-Raising Hare way) in the **South Park** episode "Pip" (parodying **Great Expectations**). Pip tries to prove to Estella that she is not an unfeeling monster, because an unfeeling monster wouldn't hurt a cute little bunny rabbit (which Pip pulls from Hammerspace).
    
    ESTELLA: I told you, Pip. I have no heart.
    
    PIP: But you do! And I shall prove it to you once and for all! Look at this adorable little bunny.
    
    ESTELLA: Oh my. 'E's very cute.
    
    PIP: You see that? A heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny. They'd just as soon break its neck. **Estella breaks its neck** ...Oh. But look at **this** bunny. There. You see that? You have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies.**Estella kills bunny #2**...Right...
    
    -   Estella ends up stopping at 25 baby bunnies. Not because she felt bad, mind you, but because she got **bored**... and Pip takes that as evidence that she's got a heart.
-   **Winx Club**: Bloom's kawaii pet rabbit Kiko is an example.
-   The **ChalkZone** episode "Chocolate Brunch" has Snap finding some Easter eggs he was going to eat with Blocky, and chocolate bunnies end up hatching from the eggs. While Snap still wants to eat them, Blocky refuses as the bunnies are too cute. Eventually, Snap gives in due to their cuteness.

-   As noted under Literature, subverted by **Watership Down**. While rightfully considered a classic of animated film, it has traumatized no small number of children since it's release in 1978 because of misinformed parents sitting them down to watch the movie about the cute, adorable bun—OOOOOHMYGOOOOD!
-   One of the characters in the 1980's version of **Strawberry Shortcake** was an adorable bunny named Hopsalot.
-   The 1991 direct-to-video film **Timmy's Gift** by Precious Moments stars a young angel named Timmy, who's following a light from Heaven.
