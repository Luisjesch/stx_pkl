Alien Hair: 
_"Really, other than their hair, the Kazon aren't too scary."_

When humanoid aliens in visual fiction have hair, it almost always falls into one of the following styles:

-   "Generic Humanoid" Hair—almost always included a recessed hairline to show off the rubber forehead, which on female characters meant to be attractive is usually only slightly bumpy. Also almost always assumes that Aliens Have No Eyebrows, as is frequently the case in _Star Trek_ and in _Babylon 5_. If this type of alien does have eyebrows, they will be unusually shaped (probably swept-up Romulan-style). The hair can be and frequently is any color.
-   "Klingon" Hair—varies from long and thinning (Malons from _Voyager_) to long, full and luxuriant (Worf, Green Skinned Space Babes from _TOS_) to long, full and mangy or unkempt (Martok, other Klingons, Nausicaans, Kazon). Again, the hairline is recessed to show off the craggy forehead ridges. Almost always brown or black hair. May or may not come with eyebrows and/or facial hair.
-   "Romulan/Vulcan" Hair—typical of Space Nazis and Space Communists. Varies from the near-human looking hair of Vulcans to the super-sleek-and-shiny wigs of _Next Generation_\-era Romulans. Often comes in a bowl cut, or slicked back. Cardassian hair is an example of this. Almost always black hair. Rarely comes with facial hair, unless it is a goatee. Usually look like wigs, and often are. Ditto Aliens love this style.
-   "Wookiee" Hair—covers the entire body. Usually a rubber suit alien, but increasingly represented by Muppets or Serkis Folk. Can be expensive to pull off well. Usually varying shades of brown.
-   "Tenctonese" Hair—bald… at least on the head. Usually accomplished by a shave or a bald cap (for example, Babylon 5's female Centauri), often with a pigment pattern or odd texture, and frequently (but not always) are complimented by enlarged craniums suggesting superior intelligence. Again, this is an alien hairstyle that does not often come with eyebrows. The Greys are entirely hairless with an enlarged cranium.
-   Not-hair-at-all hair—if the writer (and the budget) allow for aliens who don't have hair but have something else on their heads that they wear like hair. Feathers, scales, or even flowers or vines for Plant Aliens can make for a creative physical difference.
-   "Predator" Hair—not actually hair, but bundles of head tentacles/antennae that look like dreadlocks. Usually placed on the head in the same pattern as the Klingons, back from the forehead. Most famously used on the title species of the _Predator_ franchise. Some writers have gone so far as to posit that this hair substitute contains unique sensory organs or is a symbiotic species. Quarren from _Star Wars_ don't count because they are generic "squidheads."

Alien Hair Example in Recessed Hairline

Comic Books

-   Jewelius Blak, the Green Lantern who trained Thall Sinestro, has a hairline so recessed it starts on the back of her head. She also has odd thin eyebrows, the distal ends of which sweep up her forehead to where a human's hairline would start.

Film

-   **Star Wars**: Weequay, like Jedi master Sora Bulq, have textured dark hair and a very recessed hairline by human standards. In the expanded universe, the Zabrak (Darth Maul's species) have dark hair that only grows on the back of their heads, while the front has several small horns.

Live-Action TV

-   **Star Trek: Voyager**: Malons have textured hair and a recessed hairline by human standards.

Alien Hair Example in "Romulan/Vulcan" Hair

Live-Action TV

-   **Star Trek**: Vulcans like Spock keep their hair in very simple, uniform styles with short straight hair and bangs cut straight across. Most Romulans, who are descended from Vulcans, wear similar short styles, although with the bangs trimmed into a downward point rather than straight across. Their hair is also almost always black (or grey when elderly).
    -   The Mintakans from **Star Trek: The Next Generation** are a species of primitive "Vulcanoids"; remarkably, their genetic relationship to Vulcans extends as far as the straight-cut bangs!
    -   Humans who join the Romulan and Vulcan societies have been shown to have adopted similar haircuts to their hosts, such as Ensign DeSeve on **Star Trek: The Next Generation** and Michael Burnham in her childhood on **Star Trek: Discovery**.

Film

-   **Galaxy Quest**: The Thermians appear to be pale humanoids with very uniformly cut smoothed down black hair, though they're using appearance generators to hide their actual tentacled appearance.

The two were eventually revealed to be the same species and distant relatives
-   Wanderers team member Dartalg is a bipedal hair covered alien. He shows up in Legion of Super-Heroes stories from time to time.
-   **Wonder Woman (1942)**: Ytirflirks and Gremlins are both covered hair to toe with green hair that is slightly longer on the sides of their heads. The gremlins do have antenna-like things which are not covered in hair that the Ytirflirks do not and are small enough that the Ytirflirks could fit a dozen of them in a fist.

-   **Sinestro**: The noble who was the winning bid for the Korugar survivors at the slave auction had a very tall, seemingly hairless head. It's unclear if the small curly thing atop it is a hair substitute or a hat of some kind, but it appears to be decorative rather than part of her biology.
