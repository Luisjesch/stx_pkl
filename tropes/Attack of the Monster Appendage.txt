Attack of the Monster Appendage: 
The characters of a story are confronted by a large tentacle or appendage of an unseen, bigger monster who's threatening them or binding them where they stand. However, whether for deliberate suspense or lack of budget, the tentacled monster will never appear, even if the heroes manages to hack off/harm the tentacle.

This is usually played, as said above, for suspense and possibly horror. Of course it's not strictly limited to tentacled monsters: It can be played with a gigantic arm or leg belonging to an unseen beast, but usually Stock Ness Monster types are quite popular. Sometimes it even looks like the tentacle is the actual monster. In case of giant Man-Eating Plant the plant itself may act as a tentacle of sort.

This can occur in two different forms:

-   **Type 1**: Only the limb/tentacle is shown and interacted with, but the rest of the body remains a total mystery.
-   **Type 2**: While the whole creature is shown later (thus killing the suspense part), its appendages are shown before and moving independently on their own, as if they were a different monster altogether.

Sea creatures often have these, especially Krakens and Leviathans. Supertrope of Giant Foot of Stomping and Giant Hands of Doom; subtrope of Organ Autonomy. See also Combat Tentacles, Naughty Tentacles, and Tentacle Rope.

-   In a **Swamp Thing** tie in to **Crisis on Infinite Earths**, a group of the DC's most powerful magic users, including the godlike Spectre, do battle with the Original Darkness, a vast, alien being that existed before the universe. They all fail to impede it, and they eventually make a horrifying discovery: they haven't been fighting the Darkness. They've been fighting **its thumb**.

-   In **The Cabin in the Woods**, writhing branches reaching out of an elevator is all that's seen of the Evil Molesting Tree. The final shot of the film shows a monstrous arm reaching out of the ground, which is all that's shown of the Ancient Ones that are rising to wipe out humanity.
-   **Conan the Barbarian (2011)** has said barbarian fighting the tentacles of an unseen Tentacled Terror called the Dweller.

-   **Monster**, a 2008 Asylum film, which rips off **Cloverfield** from the same year, is a found-footage movie depicting a giant squid-like beast attacking Tokyo, with the two protagonists (a pair of American tourists) caught in the mess. For its entire screentime, the audience only sees grainy footage of the monster's tentacles smashing into buildings. To quote a review from IMDB, if **Cloverfield** is "Blair Witch Godzilla", **Monster** would be "Blair Witch Calamari".
-   **Star Wars** has done this a few times.
    -   In **A New Hope**, there's the garbage monster, the Dianoga. We only ever see one of its eyestalks pope out of the rubbish, and then one of its tentacles, the latter of which grabs Luke and drags him underneath the surface. Shown in the EU to be a squid-like monstrous alien octopus.
    -   In **Return of the Jedi**, when Threepio is being led down into the dungeon, something's tentacle emerges from a cell and grabs his neck. One of the Gamorrean guards escorting him beats the thing back. **Return of the Jedi** also features the Sarlacc, which is only ever seen as a giant, tentacle-filled mouth (and in the Special Edition an inner mouth with a beak) that grab victims and drag them down into the mouth to eat.

Attack of the Monster Appendage Example in Literature

-   Bel-Shamaroth from **The Colour of Magic**. While he's mentioned from the beginning, only his tentacles are shown, and about the rest of his body, we only see a glimpse of his gigantic eye.
-   **The Lord of the Rings** has the Watcher in the Water, of which only tentacles are ever seen. Gandalf and Frodo aren't even sure whether it's one creature or several. (The trope is averted in Peter Jackson's film adaptation, where we see more of the creature.)
-   **The Mist**: Some of the men decide to go outside to try to fix the generator. As soon as the door opens, a very much one-sided fight ensues with several tentacles before they snatch their prey and sink back into the mist. Also, at the end of the book, the survivors encounter a giant animal so big that only his legs are visible in the mist.
-   The **My Teacher Is an Alien** series introduces "Big Julie", a massive alien who fills an entire room. Opening the door will reveal nothing but a massive eyeball filling the whole door frame. However, Julie is able to maneuver to some degree, as it can turn around enough to put its mouth at the door instead, allowing it to be fed buckets of swamp water.
-   In the short story "The Moving Finger" from **Nightmares & Dreamscapes**, the protagonist is confronted and attacked by a bizarre, multijointed finger poking out of the drain in his apartment's bathroom sink. After cutting it off, he starts thinking about the creature to which it must have been attached. Eventually, the police arrive, and something starts lifting the toilet lid. The officer goes to the toilet to investigate, and the story ends.
-   The Swamp Monster from **The Sword of Shannara Trilogy**. Unlike other examples, what seems to be his body does surface, but we never get a good look or description.
-   The Reveal of "Under the Pyramids" by H. P. Lovecraft is that the five-headed creature that the narrator sees crawling out of the abyss (and which is implied to be the inspiration for the Sphinx) is merely the forepaw of some vastly larger Eldritch Abomination.

Attack of the Monster Appendage Example in Live-Action TV

-   Thing from **The Addams Family**. Averted in the films, where Thing is nothing **but** a disembodied hand and wrist.

-   In the British No Budget sci-fi series **Blake's 7**, a giant claw reaches through the door to attack someone in the episode "Weapon".
-   **Buffy the Vampire Slayer**. The Multiple Head Case Hellmouth Demon seen in "Prophecy Girl" and "The Zeppo".
-   **Doctor Who**:
    -   The first thing we ever saw of the creature inside a Dalek was its claw peeking out from under the cloak that it was wrapped in. In the TV serial, the claw was a gorilla glove with Vaseline smeared over it; in the later Peter Cushing movie, it was far more reptilian.
    -   For that matter, the first view of a Dalek **ever** was a POV shot of one's suction-cup arm ominously approaching a horror-stricken Barbara. Cue audiences frantically discussing what might be at the other end.
-   **The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power**': The Sea Serpent that lives in the waters of the sundering Sea is never fully shown when it attacks the people he shipwrecked. At best only his dorsal plates and several strategic shots of its body are shown.
-   In the "Salvation Fuzz" sketch from **Monty Python's Flying Circus** (aka "Church Police" or "Bishop on the Landing") after the police pray for God to reveal the culprit, a giant hand comes down from on high to point to the culprit. Sometimes when they did the sketch during live shows the hand didn't point to the right person.
-   **The Munsters**' pet dragon Spot. Usually, the only thing shown were his glowing eyes and teeth seen under the staircase. When he gets loose in one episode, all we see is the tip of his tail.
-   **Once Upon a Time**: Although more than its tentacles can be seen, the kraken is rarely, if not, never, shown entirely in most shots. Additionally, the way it reveals itself to Jasmine and Aladdin is by one tentacle ominously coming out of the water.

-   The monster living under the cornfield in the **Lamentations of the Flame Princess** adventure **Tales of the Scarecrow** is a sort of mix of types 1 and 2 - the GM knows what the beast looks like (as there's a diagram in the book) but unless the players decide to dig up the whole field all they'll ever see of it are its tentacles.

Attack of the Monster Appendage Example in Video Games

-   In **Akuji the Heartless**, the first enemies encountered in the shores of hell are giant worms, who attacks Akuji by extending their heads from underground. Players defeat them by decapitation, but after they're dead the body slinks back underground and we never see what the rest of the monster looks like.
-   In **Banjo-Tooie**, there is a dinosaur in Terrydactlyland whose only visible portion is its foot, as it's too large to depict otherwise. It constantly tries to stomp you if you wander into its "Stomping Grounds."

-   **Castlevania**:
    -   In **Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance**, there's a unidentified, huge green arm in a section of the castle. By pulling a lever you squeeze it under a giant spiked press and use the blood in order to reach the upper floor.
    -   The boss Balor in **Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow** and **Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow** is never seen in full; all we are ever shown is his face (because his trademark attack in myth is Eye Beams) and one giant hand.

-   **Debris**, being set entirely underwater, have a section in some caverns where you get assaulted by gigantic heads of Bobbitt worms sticking from underground. The most you see of them is their heads and upper bodies, with plenty of talons, and you're definitely **not** staying behind to see what the rest of those monsters looks like.
-   **Demon Front** has these types of enemies in the jungle level, just as the players are atop a treetop plateau, where occasionally brown tentacles of some unseen subterranean monsters will lash out from the edges at the players. Shooting the tentacles make them dissolve, but the monster the tentacles are attached to remains unknown.

-   **Dungeons**: the sequel has a Demon trap consisting in a massive tentacle poking out of the ground, best placed in the middle of a 3x3 room, that flails at intruders for a while, and can be powered up into a more massive, shelled version. The expansion adds the Undead, who have a similar trap in the form of a gigantic skeletric arm. The following game has the tentacle as a researchable spell that blocks a corridor tile and lashes at heroes.
-   **Fatal Frame II** has ghosts that grip on the twins and attempt to drag them away. They mostly appear on the bridge that connects to the Kurosawa residence and, even though Mio can photograph them to make them go away, they only appear as hands phasing through the bridge. The first installment also had ghostly hands coming out of the floor, but they were extremely rare-to-see entities.
-   One of the bad endings of **Fear Effect** **2** involves Hana getting snatched by the tentacle of some lake monster, who then drags her into the water before devouring her.
-   **Ghostly Matter** has one of the bosses, the thing at the bottom of the well, clearly based on the Dianoga from **Star Wars** mentioned above: tentacles attack the player character and to defeat it we need to shoot its eyestalk. Nothing else of the creature is revealed.

-   **Going into the Unknown** have you coming across dead humans from the viral infection, and sometimes long, fleshy tentacles from some unknown creature will shoot out from the corpses to attack you. The tentacles are too thin for your firearms to hit, but shooting the corpses they're spawned from will make them retract to the bodies.
-   One of the obstacles in **Half-Life** is a mass of gigantic alien tentacles sticking out of a rocket silo. Your guns only slightly annoy whatever it is, so you will need a bigger weapon. Like the rocket in the rocket silo.
-   **Hidden Deep**, where you explore an isolated underwater facility, have giant tentacles sticking out through walls and ceilings as enemies. Shooting them dead makes them fall and hang limply from whichever hole they emerged from, but you don't see the monsters they're attached to.

-   The Echidna from **Legendary: The Box** appears as a massive green tentacle/s who appears three times during the game and tries to drag the hero underground, where it can devour him. Considering that the original Echidna was a Snake Woman that might be her tail.
-   In **The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask**, a hand reaching out from underneath a bathroom asks for your help. The owner of the hand is never seen.
-   **Maniac Mansion** and **Day of the Tentacle** actually have Green and Purple Tentacles as living, independent tentacle-people.
-   "Reapervines" (and similar tentacles) in the **Metroid Prime** series are stated to be appendages of some larger creature, but said "larger creature" is never actually encountered.
-   **Monster Bash** has the livid hands coming out of the walls in order to toss knives at the hero.
-   The old Super Famicom RPG, **Neugear**, starts with your ship being attacked by tentacles of a massive krakken summoned by an Evil Wizard, and you spend most of the stage dodging huge tentacles lashing from below deck while fighting lesser mook-grade enemies. Said level ends with your ship crashing and you washing ashore, without revealing the rest of the monster.
-   The Thames Monsters from **Nightmare Creatures** are depicted as large, tentacled heads attached to a single, even larger tentacle on the surface of the Thames, which will use their limbs to lash out at players from a distance. After killing them however, the tentacled heads simply sinks into the water and nothing else is revealed about the monster.
-   **Ninja: Shadow of Darkness**: During the graveyard/ghost city level, you're required to cross a bridge spanning over a river where underneath it, the scythe-like claws of some unseen horror lunges out from its bottom. You'll need to move fast to avoid getting sliced apart by the claws, but even after you completed the level you **never** get to see what kind of monster those claws are attached to...
-   The cave of the Rat Demon in **Oriental Legend** has an area where from a hole in the background, the tail of some unseen giant rat monster will stick out and pull a Tail Slap on you until you sever it. You don't get to fight (or even see) the rest of the rat monster though.
-   In the SNES game based off of **The Pagemaster**, the gigantic fist of Frankenstein's monster will emerge from holes in the wall to try and pound Kevin into oblivion. Only the big fist is ever seen, never the entire monster, and, judging by the hand's scale versus that of Kevin, the whole monster must be big enough to fight King Kong!
-   **Paranoiascape** has one of the areas in hell where gigantic, disembodied human limbs will assault you, either from above the skies or from underground. The hands will claw at you, while legs will attempt a Giant Foot of Stomping.
-   Both **PAGUI** games:
    -   The Demon King boss of the first periodically summons gigantic, deformed hands from underground and within walls to lunge at you. They can only be avoided while you take aim at the Demon King with the dragon fireworks.
    -   In the second game, you're trapped in a haunted corridor by the ghost hag, who sends gigantic demon hands periodically smashing through windows trying to snatch you.
-   In **Prince of Persia (2008)**, you fight the Final Boss Arhiman from his point of view, and you can only see his huge, dark hands.
-   From **\[PROTOTYPE\]**, we have the Hydras, which are enormous tentacles with giant jaws that they use to throw objects (most commonly cars and trucks). Anything below the tentacle is a mystery, but there are hints they are somehow connected to Elizabeth Greene, or at least the giant bloody entity she uses to fight against Blackwatch and Alex.
-   In **Rayman 2: The Great Escape** there are some giant skeletal limbs in some level which will drag you inside their coffins.
-   **Resident Evil** has the vines of Plant 42, which emerge from the floor in the guest house. Similarly, in **Resident Evil – Code: Veronica**, there are large tentacles in the Antarctic Base that are actually part of a T-Veronica mutated plant controlled by Alexia.

-   **Skully** has various areas in pools and lakes containing long, black tentacles trying to drag you underwater, but they're attached to fixed locations and can be evaded by running past.
-   In **Space Quest II**, if you get too close to the occupied prison cells on Vohaul's space station, the monster hands crush you.
-   **Tales of Symphonia** has Coffin Masters: little hooded guys that resemble Jawas from **Star Wars** with huge coffins on their backs. Whatever is inside is clearly **way too big** to fit in there and never steps out, but can do everything from kick with a cloven hoof, whip with its lizard tail, and yank a party member inside to do God only knows what with its huge arm.
-   In **Warcraft III**, the Faceless Ones can summon huge, spiky tentacles at will from the ground. In **World of Warcraft**, they and their Old God masters continue this. The Old Gods are buried and of unknown size, so what tentacles are part of what creature, and what these creatures look like, are mostly unknown. **Cataclysm** adds massive mouth creatures that we never see all of.
-   Sluggoth from **Wildcat Gun Machine** is a boss who's fought as a giant slug-like head sticking from underground. And can periodically send its tentacles out of floors and walls as an attack.
-   **X2** contains giant limbs in two areas, notably the Sarlacc-like tentacles that ambushes you while you're flying over some sand dunes, and the beetle-like pincers of some giant insects in the last stage. These limbs can be destroyed, but you never see what subterranean horrors they belonged to.
-   In **Yooka-Laylee**, you never see the whole body of Trev the Tenteyecle; only tentacles and occasionally peeking eyeball.

-   **The Order of the Stick**: Vaarsuvius' "Evan's Spiked Tentacles of Forced Intrusion" spell.
-   In **Stand Still, Stay Silent**, we see a tentacle breach the train, as well as act independently (which is explained, as said tentacle has a working brain separate from the whole that needs killing), while it is guaranteed that there is a MUCH bigger variety of monster, complete with many more tentacles.
-   **Tiffany and Corey**: Played for laughs when some tentacles show up in a bathtub while Corey is taking a bath.

-   **Western/Teen Titans**: Raven at one point opens her hood to reveal a shadowed mass of horrific mass of shadowed tentacles. What the implication of that are are never elaborated on.
-   Cecil from **Beany and Cecil** was never shown in full. This was justified when it was a puppet show, but it was kept when it became an animated show. Word of God is that Cecil's body was kept a mystery on purpose.

Attack of the Monster Appendage Example in Anime and Manga

-   Inverted example in **Doraemon: Nobita and the Castle of the Undersea Devil**. The gang gets attacked by a Giant Squid, and barely made it into their underwater tent. Then the squid smashes one of the tent's windows, and the gang spends a lengthy scene fighting off a gigantic squid tentacle.
-   In **FLCL**, the first enemy that Canti is seen fighting is pretty much just an arm, albeit a strong one. The next episode, we see the rest of the robot, using an undersized replacement arm.
-   Played with in the anime adaptation of **Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story**. While in Raspberry's labyrinth, Yachiyo and her original crew were attacked by giant pale arms that protect the Witch's main body... which is an even larger arm.
-   The Turtle Island monster Islanda from **The☆Ultraman** initially appears as a series of serpentine tentacles, resulting in passing ships mistaking the seas to be infested by Sea Serpents. At the end of the episode, the rest of the monster finally reveals themselves, where the serpents turns out to be Islanda's limbs.

-   **Atlantis: Milo's Return** features a Kraken in the first segment as the main antagonist. Its humongous, octopus-like tentacles are seen emerging from the water, but the whole beast is only shown in the climax of the segment, as the heroes fight it underwater and get to see its fish-like body and head.

Attack of the Monster Appendage Example in Films — Live-Action

-   In **Alien from the Abyss**, the main creature (which the back of the DVD cover nicknames "The Big Claw") isn't seen until the very end of the film. Until then, it's Exactly What It Says on the Tin: a really, **really** big black crablike claw that randomly emerges from various places (usually from underground) to grab and snap at people.
-   **Aquaman (2018)**: When Arthur is first confronted to the Karathen, all we see of the monster is its titanic squid-like tentacles trying to crush him. We see the full monster later, and it's quite colossal.
-   In **Attack of the 50-Foot Woman**, after Nancy grows all that it shown is her huge hand inside her bedroom. She is only seen in full after she breaks out to look for her husband, ten minutes before the end.
-   **Deep Rising**: At first the monsters attacking the ship seem to be a patch of giant, carnivorous tube-worms. It's later revealed that they're just the tentacles of a colossal octopus monster.
-   **The Empire Strikes Back**: The Wampa.
    -   In both versions of the film, it's glimpsed first as a suddenly appearing, roaring face with a mouth full of teeth, and then a big ol' arm that attacks Luke and then his Tauntaun. We later do see the full creature very briefly. The Special Edition shows more of the Wampa in its cave, as opposed to one decent glimpse the original version gave.
    -   In a deleted subplot that involved a Wampa running loose inside Echo Base before the Rebels managed to trap it in a side room, there's a literal interpretation of the trope name in the form of a Call-Back or Brick Joke (whichever you prefer), when some intruding Snowtroopers get tricked into going and opening the door. The Wampa's arm shoots out, grabs one (who we'll call Private Wilhelm), and drags him in, whereupon Private Wilhelm's companions quickly close the door, looking as confused as Faceless Mooks can look.
-   **Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore**: at first we only get to see the chitin-covered feelers and the scorpion tail of the Manticore Queen hiding in the deep pit of Erkstag. Eventually, the entire monster emerges from the lair when angry enough, revealing more tentacles, a scorpion-like body and massive maws.
-   In **The Giant Claw**, we only see fuzzy photographs and what turns out to be the monster's feet for a few scenes before seeing the full creature. The studio likely wanted to downplay the monster's appearance because it was so low-budget.
-   In **Island of Terror**, our first glimpse of the Silicates are their tentacles. We don't see a full Silicate until after it's already appeared as a grasping tentacle from offscreen twice.
-   The 2007 film of **The Mist** contains a scene in which a single large tentacle attacks several people in the loading dock of a grocery store. In the end they see a huge four-legged monster sporting a bunch of these tentacles all over his belly/downside area. Note that these two weren't linked in the book, which had the tentacles but in the end only a monster so large, the mist prevented them from seeing the legs end.
-   The Kraken from **Pirates of the Caribbean**. Most of the time it's just tentacles rising from the water, but eventually we see the whole thing. However in both cases after seeing his body he doesn't get much more action.
-   In **The Super Inframan**, one monster has long tentacles that attack the main character scientist in his laboratory. Roger Ebert referred to them in his review of the film as "giant arms."
