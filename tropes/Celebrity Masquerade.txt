Celebrity Masquerade: 
With a few exceptions, superheroes need day jobs. After all, those wonderful toys don't just grow on trees. Some can make it big as Intrepid Reporters, while others can fulfill their need to help people round the clock as Military Superheroes. The average Kid Hero goes to school instead of a day job. But sometimes, your alter ego is someone who's in the public eye.

When the superhero has a secret identity that is famous in their own right. When they are not fighting crime they are a famous rockstar, an actor, or just someone that is constantly in the public eye. Of course, this can cause the problem of someone being able to notice that the famous model and the superheroine seem to have a lot in common, especially if they have a Paper-Thin Disguise.

See also Stock Superhero Day Jobs, in which being famous is a "job" to hide his/her superhero life. Magic Idol Singer (when the Idol Singer in question is a Magical Girl Warrior) is a sub-trope. Inverted by Anti-Climactic Unmasking, where a hero is unmasked and other characters are surprised by the fact that they aren't already famous.

Sister trope of Celebrity Superhero, in which the superhero is seen as the big star instead of using it as secret identity.

Celebrity Masquerade Example in Fan Works

-   **The Boys: Real Justice**: Bruce Wayne's celebrity billionaire status (and how it could lead to someone learning his secret identity) is brought up twice:
    -   He points out to Clark while the League's exploring Earth-7 that while Clark Kent, Diana Prince, and John Jones aren't well known in either reality, someone from their Earth would likely point out that Bruce Wayne was seen there. Hence his use of his **third** alias, Matches Malone, while exploring Earth-7.
    -   While in Gotham, the Boys (mostly Frenchie) learn a little bit about Batman and the most powerful people in Gotham. Because Bruce is famous, Frenchie does some digging and comes to the conclusion that Wayne is secretly Batman. Luckily, the Bat has a back-up plan for if this ever happens; have a shapeshifter pose as Bruce Wayne and be seen with Batman, disproving any claims that they're the same person <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>.

-   **Shadowrun**: Jackpoint personality Kat O' Nine-Tails has a day job as a famous musician that she uses as cover for her 'Runner activity. She points out the trouble with trying to maintain a lifestyle in the public eye while simultaneously operating below the radar, and suggests that other 'Runners who want to work in the entertainment industry would be better off working as roadies, backup dancers, or special effects team members as those get you the same traveling options without nearly as much risk of being recognized.
