Crowded-Cast Shot: 
That's _some_ casting couch. And this isn't even _all_ of them.

_"Everybody, get in here!"_

A gag which calls attention to the fact that a show has a large cast. In response to some summons, event, or strange series of coincidences, the show's entire cast winds up in a single shot, often cramped into an enclosed space. Phonebooths were an early version, followed by elevators, but most modern shows put their own spin on this. The humorous absurdity of such a situation is augmented by the viewer's sudden realization that he recognizes _everyone_, or the characters trying to fit everyone into a small, small, SMALL setting.

Crowded-Cast Shot Example in Advertising

-   The ad campaign for WWE's '08 Royal Rumble involved the more prominent members of its roster rioting in a subway car. Actually, this trope is used a few times in the shows themselves. The aforementioned Royal Rumble may also qualify as an example.

Crowded-Cast Shot Example in Anime and Manga

-   An early episode of **Maison Ikkoku** has the cast spending most of an episode trapped in the bottom of a dried-up well. Why didn't they help each other out, you wonder? The nosy neighbors were just fine partying in the bottom of a well, and the rival suitors didn't want to be the first to leave. After all, the other one would immediately start hitting on Kyoko, right?
-   Every entry in the **K** series has one of these for a poster. They are usually standing in the Shibuya Scramble intersection, wearing trendy clothes of the sort that most of them aren't likely to wear in the story.
-   Played with in **Sailor Moon**, where as a part of a plot relevant episode **every** superpowered girl introduced at this point shows up; the monster is immediately fed up with what's likely a one-sided fight. The same episode lampshades how small the average Japanese house **is**, as none of the characters can even engage in a fight without tripping over each other.
    -   One of the actual lines from the Cloverway dub.
        
        **Eudial:** Hold them off!
        
        **Daimon:** "Hold them off?! **THERE'S TWENTY OF THEM!**"
        
    -   A later episode has Sailor Moon, The Inner Senshi (Including an Untransformed Minako), Uranus and Neptune, all 3 Sailor Starlights, the Monster/victim of the day, and 2 villains, Sailors Lead Crow and Aluminum Sirein, all in Usagi's kitchen. That's 13 people. The only regulars not there are ChibiUsa and Tuxedo Mask (Both Put on a Bus this season) and Pluto and Saturn. (The former is presumably at home watching the latter.)
        -   Their methods of arrival there are all coincidental as well. Seiya came to visit Usagi to make sure she was alright with her parents and brother away (Calling himself her "Bodyguard", their being Senshi still unknown to each other). The Inner Senshi also decided to stop by to check on her. Uranus and Neptune's car broke down right outside Usagi's house, while Taiki and Yaten came to get Seiya when a TV crew came by doing door to door dinner interviews (forcing everyone except Minako to hide, particularly the Starlights due to them being idols) when the cameraman was attacked by the Villains and turned into a monster.
-   A **Naruto** Omake from around the time of the "Search for Tsunade" Arc has nearly every character introduced in the series thus far packed into two scenes: The opening ceremony for a kind of Ninja Olypmics, and a **really** long line for the restroom that a diarrhea-stricken Naruto needs to use.
-   The season two opener of **Gintama** has basically every major character make their way into the Odd Jobs' apartment.
-   Back in an earlier theatrical short for **Anpanman**, there was a shot at the end credits showing off every character that had appeared in show since then. However, the cast has expanded to so many characters (and now holds the world record for most named characters in an animated series!), that the amount seems tiny compared to now.
-   **Pretty Cure All Stars** is really fond of this. Just look at its article picture and this other poster, also from New Stage 2.
-   **Fullmetal Alchemist** did this<small>◊</small> for the penultimate chapter, including dead characters, and in the 4th anime opening of Brotherhood.
-   This overcrowded chapter cover image of nearly every Marine in **One Piece** together with the Straw Hats, including some that have not been shown yet.
-   **Sgt. Frog**: Several events in later episodes routinely reunite at least one member of each alien race shown in the series up to that point, although most only return as background cameos.
    -   Episode 296 is the biggest example in this series. The first half, featured piles of letters and cards sent by old minor characters. In the second half, there was a competition involving one member of every alien race shown in the series up to that point.
-   In **Infinite Ryvius**, the penultimate shot of the opening credits zooms out from Yuki to reveal a **massive** crowd of kids before zooming back in on Kouji and most of the other regular characters.
-   Two of such happened in **Zatch Bell!**. One in which Zatch celebrates with all the defeated Mamodos after Clear Note is defeated. And again when Zatch sends a letter to Kiyo from the Mamado world with a picture of him and the others after he's crowned the new Mamado king.
-   **Dragon Ball** did this several times. One of the most notable in the last issue of **Z** which features all the heroes giving their thanks to the reader.
-   Episode 17 of **Kaguya-sama: Love Is War** has a scene where Fujiwara is leading the student assembly in singing the school anthem. While most of the students are random extras, just about every character who has appeared up to that point in the series can be picked out of the crowd (all properly arranged by their grade and class), and there's even a few Early-Bird Cameos.
-   The cover of Volume 31<small>◊</small> of **GTO: The Early Years** has nearly every named character on it, even ones who only appeared in one chapter hundreds of chapters ago.

Crowded-Cast Shot Example in Comic Books

-   In the first issue of **Forever Evil (2013)**, the Crime Syndicate gathers an audience of over **eighty** super-villains. Readers familiar with the DC Universe can probably recognize all of them.
-   Superhero comics, especially long-running ones, **love** this trope.
-   **Wonder Woman (1987)**:
    -   The two page spread at the end of issue 174 contains 53 super heroes, plus enough of the cape and leg of two more to identify them.
    -   One page manages to have a shot of all the major Olympians (plus Hades) in addition to their Roman iterations alongside Diana, and while this grouping easily passes 26 characters each with enough detail to be clearly picked out of the crowd it doesn't come close to containing the entire supporting cast.

-   **Survivor** has one of these with the whole cast every season.

-   **Ever17** had this in the end after Blick Winkel goes back in time and retcons Takeshi and Coco back to life
-   Promotional artwork for **Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc** usually features one of these. With so many main characters, it is almost necessary.
    -   This trope becomes a major plot point in the first game. Four group photos of the class are discovered, and the mastermind is revealed to be one of the people in them.
-   At the way way end of **Viewtiful Joe**'s ending, there is a majestically drawn frame of every main character, every boss, and almost of all of the game's baddies, with Joe and Silvia celebrating up front. Also, the cover of **Red Hot Rumble** has all the playable characters scrambling around, looking toward the sky in a high, wide-angle shot.
-   The opening of **Mega Man: The Wily Wars** features a cast shot of all of the characters in the first three games of the series (and a Met). Considering that there are 28 characters in the shot<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>, it's a tight fit.
-   In **Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal**, in the final cutscene ("Agent Clank's Next Mission"), there's one of these in a theater, which includes characters from the first 3 games, such as the Hoverboard Tournament Hosting Girl, Skid's Agent, Helpdesk Girl, Edwina (the girl who upgrades Clank with the Hydro-Pack), the General from Planet Batalia, that guy with the drill and the Raritanium, Abercrombie Fizzwidget, Billy and his Protopet, The Mathematician, the New Age Mystic, the Hypnomatic Builder (and his sock puppet), and some others.
-   Although not in the game itself, the end of the "We are Overwatch" short shows all the game's 21 playable characters available at launch (as of May 2018, 6 more have been added, with 3 being added per year on a steady schedule).
-   **Super Smash Bros.** had these for a few promos. The largest thus far for **Ultimate** which features every playable character who showed up in the series up to that point. "Everyone is Here" indeed.

Crowded-Cast Shot Example in Western Animation

-   **Bob's Burgers**: The season 6 finale/100th episode "Glued, Where's My Bob?" ends with Bob and Louise singing a reprise of "Bad Stuff Happens In the Bathroom", which ends with them getting joined in by the rest of the family, then dozens of supporting characters and extras standing in the street outside the restaurant.
-   One of the earlier running gags in **The Simpsons**, beginning with most of the town being crammed into Ned Flanders fallout shelter, until the world became fleshed out enough that nearly every potential person **was** a bystander.
    -   There's also the mob scene in the movie.
    -   Plus the posters. And the intros, too, especially the HD one with fields of people being shown in about two seconds—and yes, a sufficiently devoted fan can name **everyone**.
-   In **Taz-Mania**'s Christmas episode, Taz's father narrates the closing of the story mentioning the heartwarming arrival of "all our friends who were sadly cut for screentime" before they arrive **en masse** for a "heartwarming cast shot."
-   On several occasions in **Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law**, Phil Ken Sebben would call everyone in via the PA system, and they would all be there after the cut. (Plus a few random characters who have nothing to do with anything, like a bear.)
-   In **X-Men: Evolution** the Professor's study and the control room of the Danger Room (where most the exposition takes place for the show) got progressively more crowded as the show went on.
-   The **The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy** episode "Duck!", in which everyone ends up in the same jail cell because of an evil ghost duck, including Hector Con Carne, who protests "I'm not even on this stupid show anymore!"
-   In one episode of **Fanboy and Chum Chum**, every single character that's been in the show (and even some that haven't appeared yet) are in one car at once. The roof has magical stretchiness to accommodate.
-   The final song "Carpe Diem" in the **Phineas and Ferb** episode "Roller Coaster: The Musical" has every single character which had appeared in the show so far. Incidentally, this highlighted just how weird a cartoon with giant floating baby heads, animal secret agents, and alien bounty hunts is.
-   This promotional poster for **My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic** made for Comic Con 2011 features not only all the main characters, but a huge selection of well-known side and background characters. They threw in everypony from the Shadowbolts to Lyra and Bon-Bon to Pinkie Pie's Companion Cube party guests from "Party Of One"!
    -   Later one-upped by this<small>◊</small> official poster featuring several season 2 cast members.
    -   A more modest one was added to the opening of season 4, with Spike and several secondary characters added to the shot of the Mane Six that closes out the intro.
    -   The season 5 finale ended with a Crowded Cast Shot showing many (but not by any means all) of the many, many named characters from the show.
    -   The season 9 climax ended with a Big Damn Heroes moment which some fans have dubbed the Army of Friendship. This included a huge number of minor characters, former antagonists, and every royal ally Twilight had befriended over the past series.
-   Done in the last stand-alone **Futurama** movie, **Into the Wild Green Yonder**, which at the time stood a good chance of being the last **Futurama** work. Near the end, a large crowd is gathered to watch the opening of Leo Wong's huge minigolf park that spans half the galaxy. Each of the hundreds of characters in the bleachers is recognizable from previous episodes.
-   The **South Park** theme song in later seasons ends on a crowd shot of several characters, some of whom only appeared in a single episode. The end shot gets updated with different characters every five or so seasons.
    -   The poster for the movie has every character that appeared in the show's first two seasons crowding around the title logo.
-   The final shot of **The Owl House** is most of the cast waving goodbye to the Collector (though it's deliberately framed in a way to make it look like it's directed at the viewer).
