Big Finale Crowd Song: 
**Kid Danger:** How do all musicals end?

**Captain Man:** With a big, grand finale song?

**Piper Hart:** That has, like, a dumb message.

**Kid Danger:** Yes! Someone conquers a fear or something, and then they start singing a song, and then everybody joins in and then the musical is over!

Who doesn't love a good musical, with their showstopping performances and larger than life casts that each contain their own unique quirks and traits?

More often than not, there's bound to be a handful of musical numbers where a large group of people sing a song in unison, which is referred to as the Crowd Song. But what happens when nearly the _entire cast_ returns for a large number? This is especially common when said number happens to be the very last number in the musical, likely as a means of provide the viewers with a final glimpse of vibrant, colorful cast of the characters, that make the piece memorable. Tis, we have what's known as the Big Finale Crowd Song, which is when a very large group of people — which tends to be nearly the entire cast — all join together for final number of the piece where they sing their hearts out in what's essentially a special way of thanking the audience of listening to their performances. May also double as a Triumphant Reprise, if a similar song was sung earlier in the musical.

Sub-Trope to Crowd Song. Compare with Massive Multiplayer Ensemble Number, Dance Party Ending and The Eleven O'Clock Number, which occurs _near_ the end of the musical, but there's still a considerable amount of time remaining.

**This is an Ending Trope, which means nearly every single example will contain spoilers by default.**
