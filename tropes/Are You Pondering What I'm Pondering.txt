Are You Pondering What I'm Pondering: 
Follow

A character is facing a problem. They describe the problem and the reason that it is an impediment in such a way as to make the solution exceptionally obvious. And, of course, this is when a solution is conceived. Only the solution isn't the one to which the explanation was obviously leading. It's either patently ridiculous or a total non-sequitur. Most of the time, it's both.

Comes in single-character and two-character flavors. In the single-character version, the character who has explained the problem suddenly realizes the "solution" in a flash of inspiration that parodies a "Eureka!" Moment.

Often, but not always, some other character will helpfully point out a more useful solution.

In the two character version, one character gives the explanation, often with the specific goal of leading the other character to make the obvious connection, then prompts the other character for the answer. The other character, who is usually holding the Idiot Ball, totally fails to make the connection.

Named for the exchange which takes place in every episode of _Pinky and the Brain_. Pinky's reply is different each time, but it usually makes absolutely no sense and results in Brain getting angry enough to bash him over the head.

A subtrope of Non Sequitur. See also: Comically Missing the Point, Strange Minds Think Alike, and Sure, Let's Go with That.

Are You Pondering What I'm Pondering Example in Literature

-   A version of this is seen in one of Robert Asprin's Myth books. Don Bruce, a Mob boss, comes to see Skeeve, who has been quietly sabotaging Mob operations, and starts off by saying he knows Skeeve is the reason the Mob hasn't succeeded in moving into the dimension of Deva. He lists the evidence: Skeeve knows the territory, has connections on Deva, etc. His conclusion? They should have hired Skeeve to work for them in the first place. Don Bruce actually has no idea that Skeeve has been sabotaging him. (This echoes an earlier scene in which the Devan Merchants' Association hires Skeeve to defend them from the Mob, not knowing he was the one who originally brought the Mob to Deva.) He ends up being well-payed by both sides for **years** because of this.

Although Dougal claims at first that he is, it soon becomes apparent that he isn't when his first question is "Where will we get the guns?"

    **Number Two:** ...Yer gonna call 'im a grot?

    **Remilia:** ...Shall we reveal who it is, Sakuya?

-   **Zany To The Max**:
    -   Pinky and the Brain still have these exchanges, but Yakko and Wakko have them now, as well. Yakko's responses usually have something to do with Coach Nurse.

    **Simmons:** Sarge, are you thinking what I'm thinking? Lopez runs away, the jeep starts driving itself, and suddenly there's a new guy on the Blue Team?  
    **Sarge:** Yes, Simmons, I am. Quite obviously, the Blue Team has constructed some kind of **diabolical** mind control ray beam, that they used on Lopez and now he has to do their evil Blue bidding!  
    **Grif:** **(hops off the Warthog)** Or, since he's a robot, maybe they just reprogrammed him.  
    **Donut:** Or maybe that Blue guy who got killed by the tank came back as a ghost, and now he's possessing Lopez's body. That could also explain why Sarge went nuts when we had the prisoner. The Blue ghost probably possessed him too. And the jeep going nuts was probably just a weird set of coincidences while the guy learned how to use Lopez's body.  
    **Grif, Simmons, and Sarge:** ...  
    **Simmons:** I think I like the ray beam idea better.  
    **Grif:** Yeah-heh, rookie, your idea sounds a little dumb.

    **Gaston:** I know.

    -   Rare self-directed example: "Don't Even Blink" has Doofenshmirtz build an invisibility Ray, explaining that he plans to use it to deal with Fireside Girls who knock on his door and spot him through the window, preventing him from pretending that he isn't home. His plan? Fire the gun at the Fireside Girls so he won't have to look at them. The irony of this situation is that the buildup to this statement implies that he will use the ray on himself to become invisible to the Fireside Girls, i.e. the more sensible approach. Obviously, this thought somehow never dawns on him.
    -   In "Make Play", Candace commiserates with her doppelganger Princess Baldegrunde:
        
        **Baldegrunde:** I never get to do anything for myself.  
        **Candace:** And I have to do everything for myself!  
        **Both:** I've got it!  
        **Candace:** Let's go to the laundromat and fill the dryers with cheese!  
        **Baldegrunde:** What? No, let us trade lives! I thought for sure on same page we were.
        
    -   "The Return of the Rogue Rabbit" has a variation where it's only one of these from Phineas' point of view.
        
        **Phineas:** What do you say, Isabella? Are you ready to take the next step?  
        **Isabella:** Oh, Phineas, yes! I've been right here in front of you all along just waiting for you to... **\[romantic music abruptly stops\]** Oh...wait. You were talking about the puppet, weren't you?  
        **Phineas:** Well, yeah. What were **you** talking about?  
        **Isabella:** Nothing! I uh, was just...**\[nervous giggling\]** - hey, where's Perry?
        
-   **The Pinky And Perky Show**: After hearing the title characters discussing a haunted television studio:
    
    **Vera:** Are you thinking what I'm thinking, Eric?  
    **Eric:** Yes, Vera. Why don't they make vases out of rubber?
    
-   **Pinky and the Brain**:
    -   Constantly, of course. Whenever Brain asks this Once per Episode, word-for-word, Pink delivers a Non Sequitur answer.
        
        **Brain:** Pinky, are you pondering what I'm pondering?  
        **Pinky:** I think so, Brain, but where are we going to find a duck and a hose at this hour?
        
    -   This trope appeared outside of the usual exchange in another episode:
        
        **Brain:** Pinky, what rhymes with June?  
        **Pinky:** I'm busy, Brain!  
        **Brain:** Well, what are you doing?  
        **Pinky:** Oh, just hitting a balloon with a spoon while I croon a tune to this baboon by the light of the moon.  
        **Brain:** Well, will you be done soon?  
        **Pinky:** Oh, about noon. Why?  
        **Brain:** What rhymes with June?  
        **Pinky:** ...No, it doesn't.  
        **Brain:** Gah, I'll make it April.
        
    -   And in another episode, it happened within the usual exchange, but with Brain providing the final example. After Pinky suggests that they package their trading cards with something pink and chewy that everyone likes so that people will buy them, Brain sees the obvious answer — include sausages.
    -   In one instance, they even lampshade the whole bit.
        
        **Brain:** Pinky, are you pondering what I'm pondering?  
        **Pinky:** Whoof, oh, I'd have to say the odds of that are terribly slim Brain.  
        **Brain:** True.  
        **Pinky:** I mean, really, when have I ever been pondering what you've been pondering?  
        **Brain:** To my knowledge, never.  
        **Pinky:** Exactly. So, what are the chances that this time, I'm pondering what you're pondering?  
        **Brain:** Next to nil.  
        **Pinky:** Well, that's exactly what I'm thinking, too.  
        **Brain:** Therefore, you **are** pondering what I'm pondering.  
        **Pinky:** Poit, I guess I am!
        
    -   In **Wakko's Wish**, they did this exchange as part of a song:
        
        **Brain:** **(singing)** Pinky, are you pondering exactly what I'm pondering?  
        **Pinky:** **(singing)** I think so, Brain, but just how will we get the weasel to hold still?
        
    -   It was played around with once on the show, when the episode "The Pinky P.O.V." gave us a look inside Pinky's thought processes. The Brain was explaining his latest plan, and quickly devolved into **Blahblahblah, blahblah blah blahblah** as Pinky pondered how Brain's head looked like a hippo's. This started a chain of thought, ending with the hippo on a beach, and wondering what the hippo WOULD wear on a beach. At this point Brain interrupted with the trope name.
        
        **Pinky:** I think so, Brain, but what if the hippopotamus won't wear the beach thong?
        
    -   Inverted at least once.
        
        **Pinky:** Well, I think so, Brain, but... no, it's too stupid.  
        **Brain:** We shall disguise ourselves as a cow!  
        **Pinky:** Narf, Brain! That was it exactly!
        
    -   On one occasion, Pinky took the Brain role with **his own reflection**.
        
        **Pinky:** **\[talking to his reflection in the mirror\]** Pinky, are you pondering what I'm pondering?  
        **Pinky's Reflection:** Why, yes, Pinky! Yes, I am! But where would you get a chicken, 20 yards of spandex and smelling salts at this hour?
        
    -   And then there was the role reversal:
        
        **Pinky:** Brain, are you pondering what I'm pondering?  
        **Brain:** We eat the box?  
        **Pinky:** No Brain, we build a boat! And **then** we eat the box!
        
    -   Rob Paulsen (voice of Pinky) gave this answer in "The Megalomaniacal Adventures of Brainie the Poo" as well as at Comic-Con:
        
        **Fan:** Are you pondering what I'm pondering?  
        **Paulsen:** I think so, Brain, but why would anyone want to pierce Brosnan?
        
    -   The other variation on the gag would be a non-sequitur from Pinky, which actually distracts Brain because he ends up agreeing with it.
        
        **Brain:** Are you pondering what I'm pondering, Sancho Pinky?  
        **Pinky:** I think so, Don Cerebro, but why would Sophia Loren do a musical?  
        **Brain:** A worthy enigma, Sancho Pinky.
        
    -   **Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain** featured a variation on this running gag in the form of Brain asking if Pinky has "Any questions?", with Pinky responding by asking a completely irrelevant question. Then, at the end of the episode, Brain gives Pinky the answer to his question. Example:
        
        **Brain:** Any questions?  
        **Pinky:** Just one. If Fred Flintstone knew the giant order of ribs was going to tip over his car, why did he order them every week?  
        **\[later\]**  
        **Brain:** It was an end title.  
        **Pinky:** What?  
        **Brain:** Fred Flintstone doesn't order ribs every week. That was only animated once, then music and voice tracks were added. The footage is run at the end of the show in the same spot every time. It's called an end title.
        
    -   And of course, the marvelous moment from the episode where Brain manages to boost Pinky's intelligence to unprecedented levels...
        
        **Brain:** Pinky, are you pondering what I'm pondering?  
        **Pinky:** **\[slight pause, then with mildly-surprised pride\]** ...Yes, I AM!
        
    -   One time in an episode from the reboot of **Animaniacs**, Brain tried to evoke this, wanting a foolish response so he'd win a competition of dictators bringing foolish guests. Unfortunately, Pinky was on his best behavior.
        
        **Brain:** Pinky, are you pondering what I'm pondering?  
        **Pinky:** No.
        
-   **Ready Jet Go!**: Happens in a few episodes between Jet and one other person. For example, in "Which Moon is Best?" Jet points out that there are many other moons besides Earth's moon. Sydney then asks "Jet, are you thinking what I think you're thinking?" Jet responds "That I'd love a piece of pie right now?"
-   In a **Robot Chicken** sketch parodying **G-Force**, two of the other team members help Tiny lose weight and get in shape. As he buffs up, he single-handedly saves the day, getting the glory and the girls. The two helpful team members are not too happy about this and glance at each other saying, "Are you thinking what I'm thinking?" When one comes into the room with a huge banana sundae to find the other has beaten their friend to death with a wrench, he realizes they weren't thinking the same thing at all.
-   **The Simpsons**:
    -   In the "Treehouse of Horror IV" story "Bart Simpson's Dracula":
        
        **Kent Brockman**: Another local peasant has been found dead - drained of his blood with two teeth marks on his throat. This black cape was found on the scene. Police are baffled.  
        **Police Chief Wiggum:** We think we're dealing with a supernatural being, most likely a mummy. As a precaution, I've ordered the Egyptian wing of the Springfield museum destroyed.
        
    -   In "The Springfield Files":
        
        **Homer:** I learned this from a movie I saw about a bus that has to **speed** around the city, keeping its **speed** above 50, and if its **speed** dropped, it would explode. I think it was called **The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down**.
        
    -   A similar example happened in "Bye Bye, Nerdie":
    -   In "Bart Gets an Elephant", kids keep knocking at Homer's door, and as he turns them back, Milhouse offers him money to see it. Homer goes "That gives me an idea!" and he proceeds to plant a sign on his front lawn that reads "Go away".

    -   In "Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo", the Simpsons travel to Japan, but run out of money and are working at a fish-gutting factory where they see the game show "Happy Smile Super Challenge Family Wish Show" on TV.
        
        **Marge:** "Family Wish Show"? Hmm, that gives me an idea...
        
        **Lisa:** I think we **all** had that idea.
        
        **Homer:** I didn't. What is it? Lunch?
        
    -   Downplayed in "The Front," where Bart is smart enough to realize that the answer to this question when directed to him by Lisa is "Probably not." Cue Imagine Spot of him holding up Santa Claus at gunpoint.
