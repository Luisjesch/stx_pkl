Beast with a Human Face: 
_"The face was as the face of a just man,  
Its semblance outwardly was so benign,  
And of a serpent all the trunk beside."_

A non-humanoid creature has a face resembling a human's, or markings on its body resembling a human face.

Appreciating this fact may provoke thoughts of What Measure Is a Non-Human?, and produce an Uncanny Valley effect in viewers. Meta-wise, it can allow an otherwise-nonhuman creature to display a human actor's full range of facial expressions on-screen.

Sometimes a property of Mix-and-Match Critters. When the creature's face actually _belonged_ to some other human character, see Face Stealer. For humans with animal appearances and traits, see Beast Man. For inanimate objects with human faces, see It Kind of Looks Like a Face. For specific beasts (traditionally) like this, see Our Sphinxes Are Different, Our Manticores Are Spinier and Shedu and Lammasu.

The inverse of this trope, humans with heads of animals, is Non-Human Head.

Beast with a Human Face Example in Anime & Manga

Examples by creator:

-   A number of Robeasts in the works of Go Nagai and Ken Ishikawa have a fully expressive human face in addition to their monstrous one, which is shown or implied to belong to their original form.
    -   **Demon Lord Dante**: The eponymous giant demon has Ryo embedded in its forehead, with only his eyes and nose visible (or in remakes, his upper body).
    -   **Mazinger Z**: The Mechanical Beast Danube α1/Rhine X1 bears a female human face on its chest, which becomes animate when it fuses with its "brain" Lorelei.
    -   **Great Mazinger**: Most of the Warrior Beasts, created by fusing a living warrior's brain into a monstrous cyborg body, have the warrior's original head visible somewhere on their body. For their enemies, this is a welcome exploitable weakpoint.
    -   **Getter Robo G**: The Hyakki Beast Maoki is a Combining Mecha formed from a large number of Cyborg gang members. Their leader Ryuji forms part of the head in order to control their combined form, with his human face visible.
    -   In **DEVILMAN crybaby**, Moyuru Koda's Devilman form is an enormous bull with an Eyeless Face and his original human face in the middle of his forehead. His human face is always the one that speaks when he's in this form.

Examples by title:

-   **Animal Land**:
    -   On the antagonist side, there is Bahr Milan, an artificial chimera. The second form he takes on after ejecting his head and combining with several other chimeras is hard to describe. Basically he's a horse headed giant armed multi-legged centaur-like being whose hoofed legs are arranged like jellyfish tentacles. What stands out about him other than that are the two human faces located on his torso.
    -   On the protagonist side, there is also the chimera Salad Udon. He can be best described as a four legged slug lizard creature with snakes for arms. He also has a human face.
-   Ikon in **Ayakashi Triangle** follow the Bishōnen Line by starting as Blob Monsters and ending up humanoid. For the inbetween stage known as "iyo", they look like bizarre monsters with random human appendages, most often a face—or several—sometimes in very strange locations.
-   In **Berserk**, many of the apostles retain their human faces in their more demonic forms. For some though, their human faces are placed on bodies that already have regular animal-like heads and some are even situated in places where human faces shouldn't normally belong on. Two prime examples that best illustrate this would be demon forms of the Baron of Koka Castle and the Count. The Baron looks like a gigantic humanoid snake but he has a human face in his mouth. The Count on the other hand, looks like a gigantic slug but he has a human face situated on the forehead of his slug head.
-   A weird side chapter early in **A Centaur's Life** features a human girl taking care of a puppy with a little kid's face.
-   **Delicious in Dungeon** has harpies, merpeople and dryads, all dungeon monsters with human faces but non-human bodies.
-   In the Spider Mountain arc of **Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba**, the "Elder Brother" of the spider demon family is essentially a giant spider with a human head. He can use his poison to turn his victims into smaller spiders with human heads that become his mindless minions.
-   **Franken Fran**: Okita is a cat with a human head. Or maybe a human with a cat body.
-   **Inuyasha**: Ryukotsusei is a dragonlike youkai who has a human face in the center of his dragon head's forehead. It's the human face that does the talking, while the dragon one focuses on spitting lightning bolts.
-   **Jinmen** is about all kinds of animals with human faces appearing in the world and attacking humans and animals without human faces.
-   **One Piece** has classical examples in the Manticores and Sphinx of Impel Down. At least they're stated to have human faces — their faces don't look very human by most standards, but then again, One Piece is famous for having human characters who barely look human at all.
-   In the first chapter of the manga **Qwan,** Chikei is nearly eaten by a monster Qwan calls a **Bafuku,** a tiger with a man's face that makes the sound of a crying baby to lure victims. It's possibly related to (or an alternate name for) the Chinese**Mafu**, as **Qwan** is set in ancient China.
-   **Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann**: When the Anti-Spiral starts getting serious, it deploys warships resembling clusters of human limbs and faces, supported by fleets of smaller fighters shaped like hands and feet **also** covered in human faces. This is in contrast to the faceless Mugann drones it was using before, and to the much less creepy mecha-style faces on all the heroes' machines, foreshadowing how the Anti-Spiral is fundamentally their Evil Counterpart.
-   **Toriko** has the Hanya Panda, a giant panda monster with a markings on its chest and belly that resembles an angry human face. There is also the Tounyuudou, monsters based on the wanyuudou youkai of Japanese mythology that resemble gigantic disembodied human heads situated on top of flaming cartwheels.

-   **The Ghent Altarpiece**: The most recent restoration of the Altarpiece has shown that the "Lamb of God" was painted with disturbingly human-like, forward-pointing eyes. It is meant to be a symbol of God, but the effect, at least for modern viewers, can be distinctly creepy.
-   Great Sphinx of Giza: It draws from Egyptian Mythology, so it's a rather cartoonish lion body with the face of an Egyptian human of Ambiguous Gender. It wears pharaoh regalia on its head, too.

Surprisingly, this isn't her punishment — being able to do this for eternity is her **heaven.**

This is because Circe has set up shop nearby and is turning the men in the area into animals and monsters.
-   In **X-Treme X-Men (2012)**, the eponymous team finds an Alternate Universe version of Charles Xavier who somehow became an Acanti Space Whale that still has his human face. Unfortunately, he's also being used as a psychic weapon by the alien Brood that has infested his body.

Beast with a Human Face Example in Literature

Examples by creator:

-   From H. P. Lovecraft:
    -   **The Dreams in the Witch House** has the Familiar Brown Jenkin, supposedly a rat with a very-humanoid face that speaks every language known to man. It isn't described how humanoid his face is, just that it resembles a human's.

Examples by title:

-   Theodore Roethke's poem "The Bat":
    
    **For something is amiss or out of place  
    When mice with wings can wear a human face.**
    
-   **The Divine Comedy**: Geryon from Classical Mythology is reimagined by Dante as the guardian of Malebolge deep in Hell, taking the appearence of a gigantic multi-colored snake with a scorpion's stinger, hairy bat wings and the handsome face of an honest man, symbolizing the sins of fraud and deceit.

-   The front covers of a few **Goosebumps** books will depict the characters in this manner, notably Gary having a bee's body in **Why I'm Afraid of Bees** and Crystal becoming a chicken-headed girl in **Chicken Chicken**. Both instances turns out to be cases of Covers Always Lie though, since neither books have their main characters in this state throughout the story.
-   During the final part of the Triwizard Tournament in **Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire**, Harry must solve the riddle of a sphinx, which is described as being basically a large cat with a beautiful woman's head.

-   **Man After Man: An Anthropology of the Future** features some non-sapient Human Subspecies that are more animal-like than human. While some of these subspecies are simply ape-like creatures with human faces, some however have bodies so drastically different that the only way to tell that they are human subspecies are the human faces that they still retain. A prime example of this is the horse-like creature on the book's very cover.
-   In the **Tortall Universe**, one species of immortals released from the Divine Realms in **The Immortals** are spidrens — giant spiders with human heads. They cause a lot of trouble in the subsequent quartet.

Beast with a Human Face Example in Myths & Religion

-   The **Book of Revelation** contains descriptions of locusts who have the bodies of lions, tails of scorpions, and faces of men (which incidentally makes them resemble manticores). As well, the cherubs (not to be confused with putti, winged babies of Renaissance art) are said to have the face of a man as well as those of an ox, lion, and eagle. While most angels looked like winged humans, there are some types that look like borderline Eldritch Abominations.
-   A few examples from mythology around the world:
    -   Buraq: A winged horse from Persian/Arabic mythology, sometimes portrayed with a human head. The Prophet Muhammed is said to have used one as a steed.
    -   Harpy: Female-headed bird from Greek mythology.
    -   Shedu and Lammasu: Creature from Mesopotamian Mythology with a bull's or lion's body, a man's head, and eagle's wings.
    -   Manticore: A human head, lion's body, and the tail of either a dragon or a scorpion. Sometimes portrayed with wings. This being was originally from Persian Mythology, but also spread to be a creature mentioned in some European lores.
    -   Sphinx: Lion with a human head, sometimes with wings as well. From Greek/Egyptian mythology.
-   From Chinese folklore:
    -   Chiai Lung: Has the body of a panther, but with hooves, a human face, and a snake for a tongue.
    -   Heyu: described as a pig with a human face.
    -   Juru: described as a three legged duck with a human face.
    -   Mafu: Tiger with a human face.
    -   Shanhu: Dog with a human face.
    -   Shuhu: A winged horse with a snake tail and a human face.
    -   Yayu: Ox with a human face.

    -   The Hakutaku, which may have originated in Chinese folklore, looks like a white ox with the head of a human. But it **also** has two secondary human faces, one in either side of its torso. All three faces also have a third eye, symbolizing its wisdom and connections to the Heavens.
-   Scorpion Men (from Sumerian/Mesopotamian mythologies): Described as creatures with human heads, lion bodies, eagle hindquarters, and with a scorpion tail.
-   The Serpent of Eden is sometimes portrayed as a snake with a human head as seen in John Roddam Spencer Stanhope's "Eve Tempted". In "The Fall of Man", the Serpent barely looks like a serpent at all, more of a salamander who's able to walk on its hind legs. Both paintings go against many depictions of the serpent of being a baby-faced beauty (see "The Fall of Man" by Titian) or regular snake by making him(?) ugly and clearly up to no good.
-   The Four Living Creatures (AKA Hayyoth), from Ezekiel's vision in the book of the same name, described them as having four faces, one of which was a human face, along with having two set of wings.
-   Leonine Whale (Medieval European legends): A scaled Lion-like creature with a human face. Has nothing to do with whales.
-   In Colombian mythology, there are stories of a creature called "Hombre Caimán" (Alligator man), who is mostly described as having the head and arms of a human and the body of an alligator. Depending on the version though, he can be portrayed either this way or as a full-fledged reptilian humanoid.

This is the Dark Eldar who forces ever member of his Kabal to get their face surgically modified to look exactly like his, in theory to prevent assassination, but in truth he's just that narcissistic.
-   **Werewolf: The Apocalypse** has an NPC named Passer. He's a **metis**, the result of a forbidden relationship between two Garou.

Beast with a Human Face Example in Video Games

-   **Axiom Verge**: The Variant bosses (save for Ukhu and Sentinel) have human-like faces that can be seen both in their dialogue portrait and on their in-game sprite. This is because they were originally clones of Athetos, but mutated due to Athetos's pathogen.
-   In **Bayonetta**, a number of the angels have human faces that aren't exactly situated properly or in places where they should belong. Noteworthy is Fortitudo, a gigantic two headed angelic dragon whose torso is dominated by an upside-down human face.
-   **Bloodborne**:
    -   Everyone's favorite Dirty Coward, Patches, returns as a Nightmare Apostle/Black Widow; a giant spider. All that's left of his human form is his head and his intellect.
    -   The game's poster-beast Darkbeast Paarl is a giant, electrical, skeletal, hairy werewolf-beast which dashes around on all fours. Despite this, the most unnerving thing about it is that its empty skull face is mostly human, lacking a muzzle or even beastlike fangs.
    -   If you closely exam the corpse of Kos in **The Old Hunters**, you can see a humanlike face on the end of what otherwise looks like a giant nudibranch.
-   The fourth boss of **Contra: Shattered Soldier** is one of these. Appropriately enough, it's called Jinmen-gyo, which is Japanese for "human-faced fish".
-   **Dark Souls**:
    -   The first **Dark Souls** game has the Cragspiders, giant, semi-flying arachnids with humanoid arms and shoulders, a bulb-like protrusion resembling a human head, and the ability to cast pyromancy in the form of flaming breath, unlike every other enemy in Blighttown which usually prefer poison or toxic. It's possible that they are the mature spawn of Chaos Witch Quelagg, another more-complete hybrid of human<sup>*&nbsp;</sup> and spider who is also a master of pyromancy herself.
    -   **Dark Souls II** has the Demon of Song, a gigantic frog-like demon which has a human corpse-like face nested inside its frog mouth alongside two skeletal arms.
    -   **Dark Souls III** has the Locust Priests, giant locusts with noseless human faces, said to have been born in the Abyss itself in order to proselytize about its virtues, which their faces were probably meant to help with.

    -   **Final Fantasy XII**: The Lesser Chimera, Gorgimera, and Chimera Brain enemies look like cockatrices with human heads. According to the bestiary, this is because they were respectively cockatrices used in magical experiments, mages who possessed cockatrices to escape their natural deaths, and people who were afflicted with a Forced Transformation.
    -   **Final Fantasy XIII**:
        -   Barthandelus the fal'Cie changes forms but the basic setup of his body is the same. He can be best described as gigantic turret-like torso with an oversized human-like head in the middle and several smaller human faces on his shoulders.
        -   There is also the other fal'Cie Orphan. Its first form resembles a gigantic stone knife-like monolith made up of a representation of a family. The right side of it is a mural-like body of a female angel with a human-like face. The left side of it too is similar except that it is more demonic in design and made from Barthandelus' remains complete with his middle human-like face. In the middle of Orphan is a child-like face.
        -   Orphan's second form is a tiny human child-like face in a halo-like wheel. When staggered, it resembles more like an angel in structure but not exactly right. It still retains its human child-like face on an otherwise otherworldly body.
    -   **Final Fantasy XIV**:
        -   Two of the bosses in Amaurot have this design. The Terminus Bellwether is a giant version of the Lesser Chimera from **Final Fantasy XII** and Therion is a quadrupedal, vaguely mechanical Animalistic Abomination with four human faces.
        -   One of the bosses in **Endwalker** is Ra-la, a quadrupedal, reptilian creature with an elven-looking face. With these features, Ra-La resembles a draconic sphinx or lamassu with enormous Ear Wings.
-   Grima from **Fire Emblem: Awakening** may seems to be a demonic dragon at face value. However, doing enough damage to his Avatar from the doomed future cause Grima's mask to fall apart to reveal a human face. **Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia** would reveal that his creator, Forneus, gave it his blood that allow Grima to grow, implying that it gained its human-like face from Forneus. It is also supported in the Valentia Accordion as it was originally a human fetus before gaining dragon-like appearances.
-   **Heroes of Might and Magic**: In **Might & Magic: Heroes VI**, Lamasu are monsters with humanoid heads, bat wings and leonine bodies, the result of an experiment in which humans were magically cross-bred with manticores.
-   Specimen 7 from **In Pursuit of Greed** is a feral, otherwise animalistic mutant monster, save for his face. It turns out he Was Once a Man until a malfunctioning birthing tank mishap turns him into the creature he is, with his face being the sole human features he retains.
-   In the third **Last Half of Darkness** game, some skeletal fish are shown that have disturbingly human-like contours to their skulls.
-   **The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages**: The three final forms that the evil fairy Veran uses in the final battle with her are three Big Creepy-Crawlies that each possess her face. They are a beetle with her head which she can retract in, a bee which has her face on top of its forehead, and a spider which has her face on its underside.
-   **Lufia**: Sphinxes (lions with human heads and wings variety) appear in **Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals** as late game enemies.
-   Buster, one of the bosses in **Metagal**, crosses this with Non-Human Head. Her head is basically a bomb launcher, but with a human girl's face on the front. Her body is basically a robot soldier from the shoulders down.
-   **Miitopia**: Taken to ridiculous proportions, where every enemy in the game has Mii facial features. This goes from butterflies to gryffons to **giant spiders**. Justified, since the main story of the game deals with a dark lord stealing the Miis' faces to place them on monsters.
-   **Minecraft**: The Ravager beasts appear to have faces similar to their Ambiguously Human Illager masters, right down to the Gag Nose.
-   **Monster Party** has human-faced dogs among the weird enemies of the first stage.
-   The Japanese iPhone/Android game **My Horse Prince** (**Uma no Prince-sama** in Japanese) is a Dating Sim/animal-care game about the budding relationship between a Bishōnen\-headed horse named Yuuma and a human woman named Umako.

-   **Shin Megami Tensei**/**Persona**:
    -   Many demons in the series fit this trope:
    -   For a non-demon example, Shadow Yukiko from **Persona 4** looks like a large red bird with Yukiko's head. This is a literalization of how she feels trapped — "a bird in a Gilded Cage".
-   **The Simpsons: Tapped Out** had the Homer Dog available during the Every Man's Dream Promotional event in September-October 2015. It's a normal dog that has an uncanny resemblance to the family's patriarch.
-   The first boss of **Soul Sacrifice** is a creature that looks like an apostle out of **Berserk**, aptly named "Leviathan". It is a gigantic<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> crocodile with a human face that covers its head and upper jaw. It was originally a young prince who was never favored like his older twin and liked tortured animals, especially his favorite crocodile, to make himself feel more powerful. He became the Leviathan when he sacrificed the crocodile for immense power from a talking chalice. He got what he wanted all right.
-   **Vagrant Story** depicts harpies as flightless birds with a pattern resembling a human face on their chests.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

-   **Yo-kai Watch** has Manjimutt, a human-faced dog (he was human before becoming a Yo-Kai) along with Multimutt (a fusion of two Manjimutts) and the Legendary Dandoodle (a beautiful human-faced dog). Despite being based off of Jinmenken, "Manjimutt" is spelled differently than "Jinmenken" despite meaning the same thing (人面犬 vs じんめん犬).
-   **Yuuyami Doori Tankentai**: Chapter 0, "The Mound Of Bird", involves investigating an Urban Legend involving the woods behind the school. When you investigate, you find the titular mound, which has a rock with Japanese Kanji written on it. If you stay there long enough, you will see a bird with a human face perch on the rock, look at you, and then tell you someone will die in 100 days.

Beast with a Human Face Example in Web Original

-   The silent antlered creature that sneaks into Darry and Kavonn's campsite in **Charby the Vampirate** has a very human face and an eerie, bony, three-legged, centaur-like body.
-   **Hamster's Paradise** has nonhuman examples:
    -   The desert falcyons are a species of large predatory bat-like animals that convergently evolved a head similar to a canine. This has an Uncanny Valley effect on the drysanders, a desert living culture of the sapient dog-like northhounds, not helped by the fact that the falcyons will sometimes hunt drysander pups. This has resulted in the drysanders viewing them as child snatching monsters with the faces of people in their stories.
    -   There are other species that have convergently evolved faces similar to the calliducyons and have special places in their culture. There's the maned stormspirit, a wandergander, a mammal convergently similar to an albatross, with a face similar to the northhound that is seen as either a harbinger or creator of storms by the northhounds. Another is the ring-necked wolfface, a seal-like bayver with a head and vocalizations resembling the wolf-like southhounds, this has led to the costal baywulves seeing them as guardians of the sea and refuse to hunt them.
-   "Meeting the Felinids", a short by BruvaAlfabusa of **If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device** fame and arguably taking place in the same universe, has a group of imperials landing on the planet Carlos McConnell (not making this up) to establish official relations with the titular cat-like abhumans... only to discover, to their horror, that they're this trope instead of the sexy Cat Girls they expected.
-   Dog in **Twig** is a massive four-legged Cyborg with a human face hidden behind long dark hair. It also seems to have human-level intelligence, but is The Speechless due to its jaw being a twisted metal wreck.

Beast with a Human Face Example in Western Animation

-   **The Amazing World of Gumball**: The titular creature in "The Butterfly" is an even stranger variation than usual: it's a butterfly with a series of **live-action** photographs of a human's face (that of one of the show's crew) that changes as the butterfly changes expression.
-   Koh the Face Stealer on **Avatar: The Last Airbender** is an Animalistic Abomination with the body of a centipede and a seemingly infinite collection of faces, many of which are human.
-   In one segment of **Brad Neely's Harg Nallin Sclopio Peepio**, Bruce Willis stars as a large dog with skin-toned fur and his head as a part of an Overly Long Gag about Bruce Willis staring in every role in a movie titled "Bruce Willis".
-   **Family Guy**: Carter Pewterschmidt's purebred dog gets knocked up and everyone assumes Brian did it, until the litter comes out and they all have Ted Turner's face.
-   **Gaither's Pond**: The fish characters all fit this trope, since they're modeled to resemble their actors.
-   Being a pony-centric show, **My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic** evokes this with pony-faced beasts. A sphinx (wings, lion body, pony's head) appears in the season 7 finale, and of course, there's Discord, who is described as having "the head of a pony and a body made up of all sorts of things".
-   The **SpongeBob SquarePants** episode "I'm Your Biggest Fanatic" has a jellyfish scientist named Dr. Manowar who was stung by a monstrous jellyfish called "Big Lenny" **and lived**. "Big Lenny" is a large purple-red jellyfish with a face that resembles a scowling mask and kills fish with its sting save for the aforementioned doctor.
-   In **Star vs. the Forces of Evil**, Star and Marco once went to a dimension of cats with human faces. We're shown Star getting one of the cats' attention, followed by it turning around and telling her to look away in a deep voice.
-   In the **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)** episode "The Manhattan Project", April and Casey encounter giant worms brought from Dimension X, and are freaked out by a baby worm that has a human baby's face.
