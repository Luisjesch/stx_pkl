Blackmail Is Such an Ugly Word: 
Getting postmodern with the trope?

**De Sardet:** Are you trying to blackmail me?  
**Aurélia De Vespe:** Oh what a horrid word! Come now, I would never do such a thing. Let's just say that I'm ensuring your loyalty.

This trope dates back to movies in the 1930s (and possibly earlier). A character discovers that she is the target of blackmail and confronts the blackmailer, who — while not denying their actions — would rather call it something prettier, like a "comprehensive insurance policy". The line is virtually stock dialogue now; as a trope, it is at the very least discredited. It was already being lampshaded in the '50s, and since then it's only used for laughs (or period flavor) these days.

Variations on the theme sometimes appear for other "ugly" words in various situations where the perpetrator can't or won't deny the substance of the accusation, but insists on softening it with a euphemism.

Many times, the character will claim that something is extortion instead of blackmail or vice versa. It appears that fictional characters are more comfortable admitting to that since "X" Makes Anything Cool.

According to free advice.com, extortion happens when someone gets money, property, or services through coercion, e.g.: threat of violence, destruction of property, improper government action, or withholding testimony. Blackmail is when a person threatens to reveal information about a victim or his family members that is potentially embarrassing, socially damaging, or incriminating unless a demand for money, property, or services is met. Even if the information is true or actually incriminating, a person can still be charged with blackmail if he or she threatens to reveal it unless the victim meets his or her demand.

    **Sojiro:** So that's what you're after?! Using Futaba as a bargaining chip for money?  
    **Youji:** It's not good to assume things like that.

When the officer complained about it being blackmail, her reaction was "So what?"
    
    **Commander Hai:** This is an emergency. Many lives are at stake. Your charter allows for action now.  
    **Misato:** Indeed.  
    **\[...\]**  
    **Commander Hai:** What is your price?  
    **Misato:** Information. On where the other Evas are being built. All of them.  
    **Commander Hai:** You can't expect us to know all that. And what makes you think..  
    **Misato:** ..that you would know? \[...\] That thing was built in Lop Nor. Using technology from SEELE and Chinese military resources. I'm sure this will be an interesting revelation before the UN Organs and the world media...  
    **Commander Hai:** That's blackmail!  
    **Misato:** I'm also perfectly happy to let this thing continue its grand tour through your heartland and population centres. I don't have to do anything until the UN to get its paperwork done or until it reaches Japan itself...

When Gaz incredulously asks for confirmation that he's actually trying to blackmail **her**, he smugly says that blackmail is a "nasty" word, but confirms that he is. Things only get worse for him from there.
-   The **My Hero Academia** fanfic **Throw a Chair Through a Window and Call It a Day** has Midoriya be a user of this under the impression that it makes them sounds less intimidating. He first renames "psychological warfare" to "a slight emotional manipulation of peers", and later calls an interrogation "a slightly more intense and focused interview".

-   In **When Reason Fails**, according to Shoto, "blackmail" is too negative. He prefers "aggressive persuasion techniques".
-   The **Family Guy** fanfic **Wipe The Slate Clean** has this mild subversion on the trope, between Brian and Stewie when Stewie plans to blackmail Brian:
    
    **Brian:** So... it's blackmail, is it?  
    **Stewie:** Blackmail **is** such an ugly word. How about the word "extortion"?  
    **Brian:** Extortion's a good word.  
    **Stewie:** But unfortunately completely inaccurate. Extortion is when I just... **beat you until you give me what I want!**  
    **(Stewie pulls out a baseball bat and starts whacking Brian on the back and shins)**  
    **Brian:** Damn! Ow! Stop that! Okay, okay, blackmail it is!
    
    -   It is also a shout-out to every show that ever said blackmail was interchangeable with extortion — and by this page, you can see there are quite a number of them.
-   **With Confidence**: When Izuku confronts the Principal with ample evidence of how the school not only turned a blind eye to the bullying he received for being quirkless, but actively **encouraged** it for years, he declares that something can only be called blackmail if the person being threatened **knows** that their actions were unethical and illegal. As Principal Akashi would prefer feigning ignorance, well... he'll play along with that, provided that those mistakes are **corrected** moving forward.
-   Inverted in a chapter of **X-Men: The Early Years** where blackmailed Warren uses euphemisms and blackmailer Scott tells him to call it what it is.
    
    **Warren:** Okay, okay. I'll go get my keys. Though I don't know why I'm so nice to you two.  
    **Scott:** **(rolling eyes)** I believe you being nice had nothing to do with it. If I remember correctly, the word you're looking for is blackmail. Oh, yes it's coming back to me now. Something about you gluing Professor Xavier's favorite pipe back together. You broke it and I caught you gluing it with Hank's special glue in the kitchen.  
    **Warren:** Blackmail is such an ugly little word and so harsh. We are going to get so much mileage out of this from Bobby. I think I'm going to have him wash my car first. I'll come up with something more humiliating later.

Blackmail Is Such an Ugly Word Example in Literature

-   **Adrian Mole** uses this phrase in **The Wilderness Years**, when he has been sworn to secrecy about an affair between Brown and Megan.
    
    God, blackmail is an ugly word. I hope Brown doesn't force me to use it.
    
-   The novel **And Heres To You** by Brian "Arkle" Webber has main female character Alicia Mitchell use this exact line on a co-worker at an office party. Partially Justified by the character's internal monologue revealing that she was directly quoting Bender from **Futurama** when she did so.
-   Subverted in Ayn Rand's **Atlas Shrugged**:

-   Terl of **Battlefield Earth** has an obsession with finding "leverage" over his opponents that rivals J. Edgar Hoover.
-   Averted in the **Conrad Stargard** series by Leo Frankowski. When Count Lambert tries to force Conrad Stargard into an Arranged Marriage with his daughter, Conrad erupts, "But this is filthy, rotten blackmail!" Count Lambert replies, "Yes it is, isn't it."
-   Inverted in **The Culture** novel **The Player of Games**. The protagonist is blackmailed by a drone and the drone actually says something like "What I'm doing to you is called blackmail." Presumably, since The Culture is a utopia, the protagonist might not actually know what blackmail is. Alternatively, the trope's being invoked: the protagonist is a games theorist very used to concepts of threat and leverage, and the drone is relying on emotional emphasis to sell its (objectively poor) position and catch the protagonist at another weak moment. Out-of-universe, it's arguably a subtle bit of foreshadowing.
-   **Fifty Shades of Grey**: When Christian Grey does it, he prefers to call it "leverage". And he's not averse to doing things to create "leverage" such as (threatening to) rape people in public. Seriously, whenever he offers you something and then asks you to use it, don't deny him in any way, shape or form. Ever.
-   In **The Final Reflection**, Krenn attends an interstellar peace conference as part of his home planet's delegation. A Rigellian delegate attempts to sway Krenn's delegation with an offer of substantial "administrative expenses", and protests when Krenn prefers to call it "bribery".
-   **Going Clear** states that L. Ron Hubbard didn't consider his practice of gathering the embarrassing secrets of his followers through the "Auditing" process and then holding it over their heads to be blackmail. In his mind, blackmail was done to extract money from people. He was extracting obedience.

-   In **Hullo Russia, Goodbye England**, the pilots of Britain's nuclear deterrent strike jets are vulnerable to blackmail. The Russian spy who attempts to compromise Flight-Lieutenant Silk over his affair describes what he does as "working for the Press", the implication being that if Silk does not play nicely, his MP wife will be embarrassed by his affair becoming common knowledge. Especially since Silk is paying cash to the lady for "cello lessons". A local bookie also threatens to go to the CO if another pilot's gambling debts are not paid in full, and "have a concerned discussion as to his little problem. You can't have a man with a gambling problem in charge of nuclear weapons, can you? It's my **public duty**."<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
-   In the Tamora Pierce novel **Lady Knight**, Kel has decided to commit treason to save refugees and is angered when she finds people willing to help — they'll get charged, same as her. One of them teasingly says she won't get to use the potentially very helpful maps he brought unless they come with her.
    
    "That's blackmail," Kel said through a thick piece of bacon.  
    "Actually, it's extortion." That was Lofren, whose father was a magistrate. "Blackmail implies—"  
    His squad-mates dragged him to his feet and took him to saddle their mounts. Kel was grateful. Lofren was happy to talk about matters of law at length, in detail, to anyone who would listen.
    
-   Inverted — very strangely — in Hugh Laurie's novel **The Gun Seller**:
    
    "You followed me here."  
    "Tut. Followed is such an ugly word. I prefer 'blackmail'."  
    "What?"  
    "But, of course, it means something completely different. So all right, let's say I followed you here."
    
-   In **Lolita**, Humbert corrects himself when fantasizing on how he will "blackmail" his wife Charlotte into letting him spend more time with Lolita, saying that "blackmail" is too harsh and suggesting "mauvemail" as a lighter term.
-   Variant: In the **Lord Darcy** novel **Too Many Magicians**, when the Marquis of London pressures Darcy to take a case, Master Sean calls it blackmail:
    
    "'Blackmail' is perhaps too strong a word," Lord Darcy said thoughtfully, "but I will admit that no other is quite strong enough."
    
    -   To clarify, it isn't blackmail: the Marquis isn't threatening to expose any information, to seek any incriminating information, or in fact to do **anything**. And the Marquis is stopping short of actual villainy; while circumstantial evidence threatens an innocent man close to Lord Darcy with a murder conviction, and the Marquis is far too intelligent for his professed satisfaction with the current investigation to be genuine, if pushed far enough he wouldn't really let this stand. The never-stated issue here is entirely who will do the work and whose pocket the expenses of investigation will come out of. Thus the quote.
-   Lord Peter Wimsey himself engages in a little blackmail in one of the short stories, but he would of course not use that word.
-   In **The Many Mysteries of the Finkel Family**, Lara is annoyed when Benny accuses her of spying on people. She prefers "investigating."
-   Eric Idle's **Rutland Dirty Weekend Book** contains a letter to critics in which Idle explicitly states they will be paid bribes for a good review of the book, and subject to physical violence for a bad review, and notes that blackmail is an ugly word, "but in this case, it's also a very accurate one."
-   Abe Mazur from **Vampire Academy**, never blackmails. "It's much easier if people simply see reason..."

Later, the Landlord comes to the Drummonds saying that he approved of his dumb brother being put in his place. However, he also exploits a lease violation that the brother found to raise the rent on the Drummonds, with a veiled threat of eviction to convince them to give in. When Drummond protests that this is blackmail, the landlord responds "I prefer to think of it as plea bargaining".

Nude pictures and videos were apparently common, but the "collateral" doesn't even need to be true; Sarah states she was videoed making allegations against her husband and family, including that her husband was abusing their son. Any attempt to leave DOS or refuse the orders of your Master is backed by the threat of releasing your collateral. "Collateral" is the most-often used term to describe this, only when some extra punch is needed do they call it what it is: blackmail.
-   **Yes, Minister** gave us a version of this, when the black, male revolutionary leader of a small African nation threatens to give a strongly nationalist speech in Scotland unless the Government gives him £50 million (around $115 million in 1980, when that episode aired).
    
    **Sir Humphrey:** It's blackmail!  
    **General Selim Mohammed:** Are you referring to me or my proposal?  
    **Jim Hacker:** Your proposal, obviously! No, wait, not **even** your proposal!

-   **Hero Oh Hero** inverts this:
    
    **Archibald (The Iron Judge):** You are on thin ice, foreigner. I'd suggest you quit provoking me.  
    **Guy:** Provoking? That's cute, Archie, really cute. I think the word you're looking for is **blackmail**.

-   In **Schlock Mercenary**, regarding menacing the Sol system with the PDCL:

    **Old Man:** Then I'll just have a word with Shinra instead.  
    **Barret:** Oh my god, are you blackmailing us?!

    -   Given that not only did they both already know that the 'evidence' being held over them was a particularly absurd case of Out-of-Context Eavesdropping, but also that the would-be blackmailer had inadvertently triggered a plan of Ayla's that left **three** different groups of opponents Out-Gambitted and put one of them under his thumb, a certain smugness was understandable.
-   In the aftermath of accusations that CNN threatened to DOX a Reddit user if he posted hateful messages again, CNN clarified that this wasn't their intention and was merely trying to state they made no deal with the Reddit user in question. At least one forum poster pointed out that CNN wasn't helping its case because claiming that you don't like to think of what you're doing is blackmail is the first thing anyone says when they blackmail you.

-   In **Potter, Inverted** Sirius shows off by interpreting Lina's coat of arms.
    
    **Sirius:** Sable; a chevron inverted and indented vert, in base a dragon... er... tué, I suppose, gules; over all a sword inverted or... Um... that would be... constancy, faithful service and a love of fire; enlightened warrior - I suppose that means a combat mage, in our case - plus two references to your surname; and a defender of treasure... no wait, the dragon's dead, so... you're actually **advertising** that you're a thief?  
    **Lina:** I prefer 'asset recovery specialist'.
    
-   **Son of Morgaine**:
    
    **Ariana's ghost:** I thought you'd have loved to spend some time with your darling sister. Aberforth loves to talk to me.

    **Robin Hood:** "Rob?" Tsk tsk tsk tsk — that's a naughty word; we never "rob." We just... sort of borrow a bit from those who can afford it.

Later, when the ****borrowing**** is taking place, the conductor asks if it's a hold-up. Doc responds that "it's a science experiment."
-   An odd variation occurs in **The Blues Brothers** when Elwood admits that he hasn't kept track of the old band as well as he said he did while Jake was in prison. The odd part is whether or not Elwood's choice of words is better than Jake's.
    
    **Elwood:** Well, what was I gonna do? Take away your only hope? Take away the very thing that kept you going in there? I took the liberty of bullshitting you, okay?

    **Thornhill:** I made him a happy man. I made him feel like a good Samaritan.

        **Valeris:** A lie?  
        **Spock:** An omission.

            **Valeris:** I do not remember.

-   From "The Movie They Said Could Never Be Made" in **The Joy of Clichés** by Nigel Rees:
    
    **Dr. Big:** You're just like all the others. You think I'm mad, don't you?  
    **Side-Kick:** Not mad, but how about **geisteskrank**?  
    **Dr. Big:** **Geisteskrank** is such an **ugly** word!

-   In the first **Kingdom Keepers** book, Wayne says that Finn would only "borrow" Walt Disney's pen, as opposed to stealing it. Possibly inspired by the exchange in **Robin Hood (1973)**, above.
-   For most of the book **The One and Only Ivan**, Ivan insists that the small glass-windowed space he is confined to isn't a "cage", it's a "domain", the same word he uses for the territories of wild gorillas. Ruby's arrival, and the death of the elephant who always called it a cage, shakes his complacency and his general attempt to Cope by Pretending that things are fine, so he ends up reconsidering.
-   In **The Scarlet Pimpernel**, Marguerite calls Chauvelin out for forcing her to spy on her peers (to uncover the Scarlet Pimpernel's identity) to ensure her brother's safety.

-   Sherlock Holmes's client brings up the ugly word after Holmes politely attempts to avoid it in "The Problem of Thor Bridge":
    
    **Holmes:** This case is quite sufficiently complicated to start with without the further difficulty of false information.  
    **Client:** Meaning that I lie.  
    **Holmes:** Well, I was trying to express it as delicately as I could, but if you insist upon the word I will not contradict you.

-   Subverted on **Arrow**.
-   **The Basil Brush Show**:

-   Used on **The Big Bang Theory**, about a robot belonging to NASA that Howard brought with him to Leonard and Sheldon's apartment.
    
    **Penny:** Does NASA know you're using that thing as a napkin holder?  
    **Howard:** Are you kidding? They still think it's in a secure locker at JPL.  
    **Penny:** You **stole** it?  
    **Howard:** **Borrowed!** The trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.
    
-   Two nonsensical examples in **A Bit of Fry and Laurie**:
    
    **Stephen Fry:** I dislike the word brothel, Mr. Jowett. I prefer to use the word brothels. Yes, this is a brothels.  
    (Note that it was a shoe shop.)  
    and  
    **Hugh:** You certainly came prepared, didn't you?  
    **Stephen:** I prefer to put it this way: I certainly came prepared, didn't I?
    
-   In the **Blackadder Goes Forth** episode "General Hospital", during a discussion of spying, Melchett becomes so concerned with what's "a dirty word" and what isn't that he loses touch with the actual subject entirely.
    
    **Melchett:** "Security" isn't a dirty word, Blackadder. "Crevice" is a dirty word, but not "security".  
    **\[later\]**  
    **Blackadder:** Well, good thing your job<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> is also your hobby.  
    **Melchett:** Now there's another dirty word: "job".  
    **\[even later\]**  
    **Darling:** We've found a leak.  
    **Melchett:** Now "leak" is a positively **disgusting** word.
    
-   In the finale of **Boston Legal**:
    
    **Carl Sack:** Fired is such an ugly word, Alan. An accurate one, but...
    
-   **Buffy the Vampire Slayer**:
    -   In the third season finale, when Buffy informed Wesley that she was through taking orders from the Watchers Council...
        
        **Wesley:** This is mutiny!  
        **Buffy:** I call it "graduation".
        
    -   Also:
        
        **Buffy:** So...am I crazy?  
        **Willow:** Well, "crazy" is such a strong word...  
        **Giles:** Let's not rule it out, though.
        
-   **Burn Notice**: But at least Brennen admits it.
    
    **Michael:** You're forcing me to break into a weapons manufacturer?  
    **Brennen:** "Forcing" is such an ugly word. Encouraging. Incentivizing... No, you're right, let's go with forcing.

-   **El Chavo del ocho**: When Quico chides el Chavo for pretending to sleepwalk at his house to steal a bag of bread, Chavo's response is "But I didn't steal the bread. I just **ate** it."
-   **The Comic Strip Presents** episode "Space Virgins from the Planet Sex" has alien women needing human men to get them pregnant. They shy away from the term "sex slave" in favour of a description of being forced to have sex.
-   **Doctor Who**:
    -   In "The Big Bang", the Doctor, saying goodbye to a young Amy, mentions, "Did I tell you that I stole the TARDIS? Well, borrowed." His subsequent description of the TARDIS as "ancient and modern at the same time and the most brilliant blue ever" allowed Amy to remember it at her wedding to Rory as "Something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue."
    -   Brought up again in "The Doctor's Wife":
        
        **Idris (the TARDIS in a human form)**: Then you stole me. And I stole you.  
        **The Doctor:** I borrowed you.  
        **Idris:** Borrowing implies the eventual intention to return the thing that it was taken. What makes you think I would ever give you back?
        
-   In **Downton Abbey**, when the Countess Dowager asks Doctor Clarkson to make some "amenagements" with the truth to help Cora reconcile with Robert.
    
    **Dr Clarkson**: So you want me to lie to them and say there was no chance at all?  
    **Countess Dowager**: Lie is such an unmusical word.
    
-   **Family Matters**:
    
    -   In the episode "False Arrest", Carl is confronted by Buddy Goodrich, a celebrity whom he'd arrested earlier in the episode for assault. Goodrich tries to talk Carl out of putting him on trial because he could simply have his assistant lie to the jury to counter any bad press that would come from the incident. Carl, of course, is having none of it:
    
    **Carl:** So what you're gonna have him do is lie? Commit perjury?  
    **Goodrich:** Those are such ugly words, Carl! They're true, but still...they're very ugly.
    
    -   When that doesn't work, Goodrich tries to offer Carl money for a one-time appearance on his show, which Carl also rejects:
        
        **Carl:** So what you're offering me is a bribe?  
        **Goodrich:** Ooh, another ugly word!
        
-   In **Farscape**, when Rygel is accused of "snurching" (**Farscape**\-ese for "stealing"), he responds "I don't **snurch**, I... **procure**."
-   From the **Frasier** episode "The Devil and Dr. Willly":
    
    **Babe:** I'm just talking about having a little fun. After all, when I'm having fun, I'm happy. When I'm happy, I work harder. When I work harder, you become famous and powerful. Isn't that what you want? Fame and power?  
    **Frasier:** I like to think of it more as "influence", really, but...
    
-   An episode of **The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air**:
    
    **Will:** You hustled me!  
    **Pool Shark:** Hustled is such an ugly word. I like to call it creative money management.
    
-   Subverted in **Haven**:
    
    **Duke**: Lying is such an ugly word...but yeah, I lied.
    
-   The MacGuffin in one **Hogan's Heroes** episode is a collection of artwork taken from occupied France for a high-ranking German official's private collection — described as "not 'stolen'... 'confiscated'".
-   In **Jessica Jones (2015)**, Kilgrave, serial mind rapist, doesn't like the word 'rape', despite that being exactly what he did to Jessica, Hope Schlottman, and almost every woman he's encountered. He seems to acknowledge that's exactly what he did when Jessica confronts him on this, but denies it at first and later mutters that he doesn't like what he does being described that way.
-   Averted in the **Kraft Suspense Theatre** episode "One Step Down". When sleazy No-Tell Motel owner Homer Fargis tries to get money out of wealthy Janet Cord for **almost** cheating on her husband, she replies "That's blackmail!"—and he responds with a Blunt "Yes".
-   On an episode of **Life**, Charlie Crews abducts the Big Bad by waylaying his chauffeur and picking him up in his own car. When the victim points out that "this is a kidnapping," Charlie parks the car and begins to explain why he doesn't like that word and doesn't feel it applies in this case. The villain then says, "No, detective, you misunderstand me. This isn't a kidnapping. **This** is a kidnapping." Cue a tire iron smashing through Charlie's window.
-   Don West in **Lost in Space (2018)** hates to be called a smuggler. He's an **importer** of rare goods.
-   Combined with Brief Accent Imitation in **Lovejoy** when some former soviets ask if an official is "Coorv-ed"
    
    **Tinker:** I think he means "Bent"  
    **Lovejoy:** I prefer "Coorv-ed".
    
-   **M\*A\*S\*H** has a few examples, generally involving Klinger.
    -   In the episode "Morale Victory", where Hawkeye and BJ get named morale officers, Klinger shakes them down for a 3-day pass to go on an errand for them.
        
        **BJ**: You thief!  
        **Klinger**: "Thief" is such an ugly word. Shall we say "entrepreneur"?
        
    -   A little later in the same episode, they find out Klinger was going where they wanted him to anyway:
        
        **Hawkeye**: You just stole a 3-day pass from us.  
        **Klinger**: "Stole" is such an ugly word. Shall we say "creatively acquired"?
        
    -   Subverted in "The Price":
        
        **Klinger:** Bribery is such an ugly word. Ugly, but fitting.
        
-   In "The Scarlet Letter" episode of **The Mentalist**, the line is fairly self-explanatory.
    
    **Minelli:** You abused a corpse to get a confession.  
    **Jane:** Used. Used a corpse. There's no "ab".
    
-   **One Hundred Deeds For Eddie Mc Dowd**:
    
    **Justin:** I hate you!  
    **Eddie**: Justin, hate is a very strong word.
    
-   **Person of Interest**: Finch, to Carter in "Baby Blue":
    
    **Carter:** You hacked into his company?  
    **Finch:** 'Hacked' is such an ugly word.
    
-   **Star Trek**:
    -   In the **Star Trek: The Original Series** episode "Let That Be Your Last Battlefield", Kirk accuses Lokai of stealing, making off with, whatever, the shuttle. Lokai replies, "I do not **make off** with things! My need gave me the right to use the ship! Mark the word, sir: The **use** of it!"
    -   In **Star Trek: Deep Space Nine**, Garak isn't pleased with Siskos' encouragement to help him with a rescue mission.
        
        **Garak:** Commander, this is extortion!  
        **Sisko:** Hm... yes, it is.
        
    -   **Star Trek: Voyager**: In "Concerning Flight", the villain Tau is a Space Pirate turned Arms Dealer and has this as his Establishing Character Moment.
        
        **Alien Buyer:** Your prices are said to be unreasonable.  
        **Tau:** Unreasonable is such a strong term. But if I can't sell to you, I'll sell to one of the other colonies in your system. A violent sort, your neighbours, aren't they? I'd hate to make your life difficult by offering my weapons to them. But if you don't give me a choice...
        
-   **Succession**: While reading obituaries of their father, the siblings muse that wording like "man of his age" is a polite way to say "racist and lenient on sexual assault".
-   **Switch (1975)**: Pete isn't counterfeiting money, he's **simulating** it.
-   **The Umbrella Academy (2019)**: Klaus thinks that 'cult' is a very negative term, and prefers his to be called an 'alternative spiritual community'. Allison refuses to play ball and reiterates that he started a cult.
-   **Who's the Boss?**, "Not With My Client You Don't": Angela's assistant calls "hooker" an ugly word and prefers "call girl".
-   **Yes, Minister**:
    
    -   This is an almost character-defining trope for Sir Humphrey Appleby, who usually merges it with spectacular Sesquipedalian Loquaciousness.
    
    **Bernard:** It is a bit of a cover-up, isn't it?  
    **Sir Humphrey:** Certainly not, Bernard. It is a responsible discretion exercised in the national interest to prevent unnecessary disclosure of eminently justifiable procedures in which untimely revelations would severely impair public confidence.  
    **Bernard:** I see. **\[beat\]** It's like Watergate?
    
    -   In another episode, Sir Humphrey assures Hacker that, if a certain report is unfavorable, it will never see the light of day. He's then offended when Hacker refers to that as suppression.
        
        **Sir Humphrey** Suppression is the instrument of totalitarian dictatorships, we don't talk of that sort of thing in a free country! We simply take a democratic decision not to publish it.
        
    -   From the **Yes, Prime Minister** episode "A Conflict of Interest":
        
        **Hacker:** You mean he's indiscreet?  
        **Humphrey:** That's such a pejorative word. I prefer to say he's obsessively honest.

-   From "Erase" by They Might Be Giants:
    
    Think of this as solving problems

    Please don't call it "strangulation"  
    That is such an ugly word

Blackmail Is Such an Ugly Word Example in Roleplay

-   Happens twice with Ivy in **Dawn of a New Age: Oldport Blues**. First she creates a robotic drone that then orders a Nintendo Switch for her without taking any money from her account; when her friend Luna points out that that's stealing, she rephrases it as 'getting it for free'. Then, when she needs to find a bucket of water to put out a fire, she 'borrows' one from a nearby garden, she doesn't steal it.

Blackmail Is Such an Ugly Word Example in Video Games

-   When the AI declares war on you in **Civilization V**, one of the quote they may use is "Backstab is such an ugly word. Shall we instead say I am just "reinterpreting" our supposed friendship?".

    **Kurtis**: Hmph. They're nothing but pawns to you, huh...  
    **General Carter**: What an ugly way of saying it, Kurtis. I prefer to call them the "heroes who sacrificed their lives for the earth". Muhahahahaha!!
    
-   **Fallout: New Vegas** has Mr. House
    
    **Courier:** In the meantime, you'd rule Vegas as some kind of dictator?  
    **Mr. House:** I prefer the term 'autocrat'.
    
-   **Final Fantasy VI** with Locke, and his insistence that he's not a thief, he's a "treasure hunter". Naturally, he often "hunts for treasure" in other people's homes. But press the issue and he might rip your lungs out. Or at least steal your clothes.
    
    "Bah! Semantic nonsense!"
    
-   In **Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates**
    
    **Aleria:** She's a sacrifice to your god?!  
    **Chaspel:** "Sacrifice" is such a harsh word. "Catalyst" sounds so much nicer.
    
-   **Galaxy Angel**: On Milfie's route in Moonlit Lovers, Tact calls Noah a "mercenary" when Milfie convinces her to help them by offering her some food. Noah replies that she would prefer to be called an "utilitarian".
-   In **Geneforge V**, a bandit argues over semantics.
    
    **Emogene:** I object to the word "extort". It is an ugly term. We are helping them. If they are so tight with their coins that they can't pay us for this service, it is a good thing we are here to teach them manners.
    
-   **God Hand**:
    
    **Gene:** This arm makes me popular among the hellish set.  
    **Conchita (a demon):** **Hellish?!?** We prefer "supertropical".
    
-   This exchange is brought up in **Jak II: Renegade** when the words "forced labour trade" are mentioned:
    
    **Jak:** You mean the slave trade?  
    **Krew:** Uh, I prefer "freedom challenged".
    
-   In the German version of **Kingdom Hearts II**, Demyx responds to Goofy accusing him of being a thief with "Dieb –- was für ein hässliches Wort!", meaning "Thief –- what an ugly word!".
-   In **Kathy Rain**, the titular character has this conservation when confronting Father Issac with the Red Scythe plant, which has psychedelic properties.
    
    **Kathy:** You know something about this plant, right?  
    **Father Issac:** Oh, yes, a link to the divine. They help by preparing the body for unity with God.  
    **Kathy:** So, you've drugged people with it?  
    **Father Issac:** Such a crude choice of words. It has been **one** component of my sacred work, yes.
    
-   **Persona**:
    -   In **Persona 3**, when SEES confronts Ikutsuki and learns of the latter's intentions, this happens twice in the same conversation:
        
        **Yukari:** In the video from my father... He said to defeat the Shadows... Was that a lie too?  
        **Ikutsuki:** Ah... He did record that himself. ...Of course, I had to make some modifications.  
        **Mitsuru:** You doctored it!?  
        **Ikutsuki:** I **corrected** it.
        
        **Yukari:** You used both me and my father!  
        **Ikutsuki:** "Used" is such an ugly word. It was for the sake of the world, so how could it be wrong?
        
    -   In **Persona 5**, one of the Confidant bonuses received from formerly-crooked politician Yoshida<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> lets the party demand more money from enemy Shadows they're holding at gunpoint. Said bonus is called "Fundraising".
-   **Pokémon Insurgence**:
    
    **Zenith:** Mind control is such an ugly term. I prefer "mind optimization".
    
-   In **Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal**, during an episode of Supervillain Weekly:
    
    **Supervillain Weekly Host**: Lawrence, tell us a bit about this top-secret "super weapon" being constructed on Planet Daxx?  
    **Lawrence**: Well, "super" is such a strong word... For that matter "weapon" may be a tad overdoing it.
    
-   From **Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords**:
    
    **HK-50:** Clarification: "Assassin Droid" is such a crude term, master, reserved for durasteel drones with only the most archaic kill-programs. The function I perform has been referred to as "wanton slaughter". I prefer to see it as a means of facilitating communication, resulting in the termination of hostilities.
    
-   From **Star Wars: The Old Republic**:
    
    **NPC:** You're Insane!  
    **Sith Inquisitor:** Insane is such a harsh word. I prefer differently rational.
    
-   **Thief II: The Metal Age**, while looting a ruined city:
    
    **Garrett:** Archaeologist sounds so much more dignified than Thief.
    
-   Cheekily Subverted in **Xcom 2**, when accessing the black market to buy ADVENT materials:
    
    **Alien Alloy Tooltip**: "Stealing" is a harsh word for how we acquired these alloys. Accurate, but harsh.

Blackmail Is Such an Ugly Word Example in Visual Novels

-   In **Spirit Hunter: NG**, Ban is fond of using nice euphemisms for his dirty work.
    -   Rosé gets annoyed with Ban for extorting the high-schooler Akira. Ban retorts that it wasn't 'extortion', he was just 'collecting fees' that he was due.
    -   When Rosé talks about breaking-and-entering into the Miroku residence, Ban rephrases it as them 'investigating' the place. Rosé makes fun of him for being so hung up on the terminology.

Blackmail Is Such an Ugly Word Example in Webcomics

-   Mr. Butch from **Chopping Block** is not a "serial killer". He prefers the term "High Yield Afterlife Inducement Broker."
-   Inverted in **Intragalactic**:
    
    **Captain Glee:** "Unofficial incentive" is such an ugly... pair of words. Let's just say I bribed you with full knowledge that I'm violating the law.
    
-   Much like Haley, Mordekai from **Irregular Webcomic!** is a "Lovable Rogue".
-   Revolver Ocelot in **The Last Days of Foxhound**:
-   Gav in **Nukees**, in a way illuminating his character.
    
    **Gav:** "Better" is such an ugly word...
    
-   **The Order of the Stick**:
    -   Haley Starshine dislikes being called a thief. She prefers "Freelance Wealth Redistribution Specialist".
    -   Also, when Vaarsuvius' mate questions where V got a massive power boost:
        
        **Vaarsuvius:** I negotiated an exchange with three gentlemen from... other planes of existence.  
        **Inkyrius:** **Which** planes?  
        **Vaarsuvius:** Those in the ventral position.  
        **Inkyrius:** You **sold your soul to fiends??**  
        **Vaarsuvius:** Technically, it is more of a fixed-term lease with an occupancy date yet to be determined!
        
-   This ''Pibgorn'' strip:
    
    **Stan:** These creatures you treasure, they are as good as dead unless you follow my instructions to the letter.  
    **Pibgorn:** So they're hostages!  
    **Stan:** "Hostage" is such an ugly, sordid word ... yes. They're hostages.
    
-   **Schlock Mercenary** has a few examples. On the rare occasion acknowledging their status as mercenaries is politically inconvenient, the Toughs and others will be called "security and armed response." There's also:
    
    **Petey:** "Spy" is such a short ugly word. I prefer "espionage". Those three extra syllables really say something.
    
-   In this **Sluggy Freelance** strip, the Evil Chancellor doesn't like the term "bad guy", preferring to be called "morally challenged".
-   **Spacetrawler**: inverted, "Please, don't call it a gift. Call it a bribe."
-   **Unsounded**: The Aldish insist on calling the rebellion in Avelpit the Foi-Hellick "Affair". This lets them play down the brutality with which they put down the rebels and their families and makes the whole thing sound like it was Roger Foi-Hellick's idea rather than a populist uprising which he had a part in leading.

Blackmail Is Such an Ugly Word Example in Web Original

-   **Critical Role**: In episode 84 of the first campaign, Kima **tries** to invoke this, but poor Grog doesn't really get such subtleties.
    
    **Kima:** If Mr. Vord starts coming round asking questions? ...Tell him you haven't seen me.  
    **Grog:** Lie?  
    **Kima:** No, no... Just tell him you haven't seen me.  
    **Grog:** **(Confused)** But I have seen you...  
    **Kima:** Tell him you haven't.  
    **Grog:** **\[Turns to Vex and Pike for help, the expression on his face causing the entire table to erupt into minutes-long peals of laughter.\]**
    
-   Similarly, this post on the (now disused) old NationStates forums, memorialised in someone's signature:
    
    **Extortion is such a nasty word.  
    I much prefer "magnolia". "Magnolia" is a much nicer word.**
    
-   This<small>◊</small> demotivator. They're not pirates, they're **preemptive nautical salvage experts**.
-   Genocide is such a harsh word...

-   Parodied in one **Show of the Weekend** for **Outside Xbox**, which has Luke defend his choice to harvest all the Little Sisters in **Bioshock** by saying "harvested" is such a harsh word and he prefers "murdered". It takes him a moment to realise that it didn't go the way he planned.
-   **Texts From Last Night:**
    
    **(928):** whats a positive sounding word for "exploit"?
    
-   Calling the trope Jack Bauer Interrogation Technique is much more professional-sounding than 'Violent physical abuse until they give you the information'.
-   One Internet meme consists of an image macro of a sketchy-looking guy with a moustache reading "Kidnap? I prefer the term 'surprise adoption'."

Blackmail Is Such an Ugly Word Example in Western Animation

-   **Archer**: When Archer is training Cyril to be a spy early in season one, he stresses that to us the term "call girl" and NOT "hooker". Unless they're dead (which happens with surprising regularity to Archer), then they're hookers.
-   In **Batman: The Animated Series**, when a captured Batman is put on "trial" by the inmates of Arkham Asylum and district attorney Janet Van Dorn helps him as best she can by sowing discord among the criminals:
    
    **Harley:** Ha! You're just jealous because you don't have a fella who's as lovin' and loyal to you as my Puddin' is to me!  
    **Van Dorn:** Ah-ha. And I suppose it was that same "loyalty" I saw the last time you escaped and "Puddin'" here finked on you in hopes of getting time off!  
    **Harley:** **(dejected)** Is that true, Puddin'?  
    **Joker:** **(sheepishly)** "Finked" is such an ugly word....  
    **Harley:** **(grabs Joker and starts shaking him)** You lousy, scum-sucking creep!
    
-   **Biker Mice from Mars**: As Ronaldo Rump says, kidnapping is such a harsh word. He prefers to describe Charley as a "reluctant guest".
-   **Codename: Kids Next Door**, "Op LEADER": Chad calls "traitor" an ugly word. Which he isn't.
-   **Dan Vs.**:
    
    -   Played Straight in "Technology," where big tech CEO Barry Ditmer prefers "guiding synaptic processes from afar" to "mind control."
    -   Subverted in "Anger Management":
    
    **Amber:** "Extortion" is such an ugly word. I prefer..."extortion".  
    **Dan:** That's the same word.  
    **Amber:** I said it nicer the second time.
    
-   In **Danny Phantom** when Danny calls Vlad a Green Bay Packers fanatic. Vlad openly admits it.
    
    **Vlad:** Fanatic is such a negative word... but yes.
    
-   In **Elena of Avalor Song of the Sirenas**, when Elena accuses her cousin Cristobal of betraying their family, he replies, "Betrayed is such a nasty word." But when he thinks about it, he can't think of a better word and he concedes "no, you're right, betrayed works."
-   On **Invasion America**, this exchange takes place:
    
    **Cale Oosha:** TREASON!  
    **Dragit:** Revolution.
    
-   **Metalocalypse**: The band members don't like talking about dying (when it's them); they prefer the term "hamburger time".
-   Inverted in **Phineas and Ferb**. When it's suggested that Mitch is essentially a zookeeper, he feels that "sort of legitimizes the whole thing," and prefers to be called a poacher.
-   Played with in **Rick and Morty**
-   **The Simpsons**:
    
    -   Homer posing as 4th-grader:
    
    **Homer:** **(to Sherri)** C'mon, why won't you go out with Bart?  
    **Sherri:** He's a smelly, ugly dork!  
    **Homer:** Ugly is such a smelly word.
    
    -   Another **Simpsons** example:
    
    **Lisa:** You're replacing me?  
    **Homer:** Now, Lisa, "dumping" is such a harsh word. Let's just say I'm **replacing** you.
    
    -   And another:
    
    **Marge:** Did you jimmy open Mr. Burns' liquor cabinet?  
    **Homer:** Jimmy is such an ugly word. Unless you're talking about Jimmy Smits. Mrrow!
    
    -   In the Treehouse of Horror Bartificial Intelligence
    
    **Bart:** Did you replace me with this tinker toy?!  
    **Homer:** Replace is such an ugly word. We upgraded.
    
-   **Spider-Man: The Animated Series**:
    
    **Michael Morbius**: I borrowed this equipment from the ESU Science Department.  
    **Felicia Hardy**: Pilfered.  
    **Michael Morbius**: ...Borrowed.
    
-   **Spongebob Squarepants**:
    
    -   The series includes a variation in "Bucket Sweet Bucket".
    
    **Mr. Krabs:** **(takes the safe out from his throat)** And I bet you tried to steal this, too.  
    **Plankton:** **(chuckles)** Well, steal is such a strong word.
    
    -   Also parodied when, in order to try pleasing an important food critic after Squidward's demeanor nearly makes him leave, Mr. Krabs offers a Krabby Patty. But the penny-pinching crustacean is unable to get past the F in "free" (spraying spit all over the critic during the attempt) and switches to "complimentary."
-   **Star Wars Rebels**. Lando Calrissian thinks that "smuggler" is such a small word. "I'm more of a galactic entrepreneur."
-   In **The Venture Brothers**, the Guild of Calamitous Intent also don't like morally charged phrases like "good guys" or "bad guys", and insist people use "protagonist" and "antagonist" instead. In all fairness, with guys like Brock Sampson running around, it is a legitimate complaint.
