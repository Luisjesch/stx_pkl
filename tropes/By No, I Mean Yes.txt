By No, I Mean Yes: 
_"I'm willing to admit that I may not always be right...but I'm never wrong."_

— **Sam Goldwyn**

A character makes a statement, then immediately adds that they actually mean the exact opposite of what they said. Usually shows up in comedies. May be used as a form of pointing out sarcasm.

Subtrope of Bait-and-Switch Comment. Compare Dissimile. See also Distinction Without a Difference, where a character prefers to use a different word to mean the same thing, and "No" Means "Yes", where people assume a person is doing this, but they aren't. Compare Instantly Proven Wrong, where the character makes a statement, but something external immediately contradicts that statement.
