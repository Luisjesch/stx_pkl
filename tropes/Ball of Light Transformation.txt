Ball of Light Transformation: 
The Ball of Light Transformation is a peculiar form of Voluntary Shapeshifting, where a character becomes not another creature but a flying orb, mote, speck, flame or tiny star made of light. Size, color and brightness can vary.

Such a form is often invulnerable, light being intangible, or at the very least very hard to hit thanks to its small size and mobility. Some can even goes through walls, or slip through tiny spaces. Although many will just use this form as an alternate means of Flight.

This is a power commonly associated with fairies and similar creatures. Can be a variant of Elemental Shapeshifter, with light or Pure Energy substituted to other elements.

Contrasting with this transformation as a standard power, it can also be a one-time event when a character is metamorphosed, resurrected, ascended to a higher plane of existence or other life-changing event.

The popularity of this trope in film or live-action TV can be linked to it being a very easy special effect.

Compare with Energy Beings, Spark Fairy and Will-o'-the-Wisp, for things that have this shape permanently.

-   Mikujin, the Robot Buddy sidekick from **Doraemon: Nobita's Dorabian Nights** has the ability to turn himself into a fiery orb of fire at will. Earlier on Mikujin (who seemingly ditched Doraemon and gang) comes back and rescues the heroes when their sleeping pods are flung into a storm by the villains, and Suneo said they were rescued by a ball of flames, which everyone scoffed at and said he's dreaming. That ball of flames turns out to be none other than Mikujin, much later in the story.
-   **Eto Rangers**: The Jyarei Monsters, the Jyarei Elite and even Jyarei Queen Nyanma herself are all capable of turning into balls of light. For the Monsters and the Elite, they do this to invade the Novel Worlds; in Nyanma's case, she uses it when she goes to Mugen on certain occasions.
-   The first season finale of **Hell Girl** sees this used as an alternate form of flight. Ai becomes a ball of purple light when escaping the spider so that she can take her revenge on Hajime and Tsugumi in the world of the living. Her minions do the same, albeit in colors corresponding to their straw doll forms, to follow her in hopes of talking her down.

-   **Spider-Man**: Will O' the Wisp can fly by making himself lighter than air and expelling a trail of excess molecules behind him. He gives off so much light when he does this that he looks like an ethereal glowing sphere.

Ball of Light Transformation Example in Literature

-   This is the true form of the Terrestrials in Eric Frank Russell's "Metamorphosite". The apparent captives turn into blindingly bright light at the end of the story — their humanoid appearance was simply A Form You Are Comfortable With.
-   **The Stormlight Archive**: This is the power of the **nex-im** brand of Fused. The Fused spirit can eject from its body as a ribbon of reddish light, leaving behind a hollow husk of carapace. The Fused then flies with extreme speed in its ribbon form before recreating its body at the destination point. The only way to kill a Fused of this brand (inasmuch as you can ever kill a Fused, anyway) is to either kill it so quickly that it has no chance to eject, or to bait it into using four bodies in a row to fight you instead of retreating to replenish its Voidlight on the fourth jump.

-   In **Stargate SG-1** and the rest of the Stargate-verse, people who Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence take the form not of a ball of light, but of a luminous blob with waving tendrils.

Ball of Light Transformation Example in Myths & Religion

-   Caribbean legends speak of a kind of evil hag known in different parts as soucoyant, loogaroo, asema, or Ole-Higue. Whatever the name, she appears as an old woman by day, but by night transforms into a ball of ghostly fire (leaving her skin behind) and flies off to suck the blood from people. The way to destroy her is to find the discarded skin and salt it; depending on the legend, she then either becomes poisoned by the salt when she puts the skin back on, or is unable to put it on at all and perishes without it.

Ball of Light Transformation Example in Webcomics
