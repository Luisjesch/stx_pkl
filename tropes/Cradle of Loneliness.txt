Cradle of Loneliness: 
The man without fear... but not without grief.

Alice and Bob loved each other very much and were happy together for a long time. But something happened to Bob. Maybe he died. Maybe he disappeared without a trace one day. Maybe there was a breakup. Whatever the reason may be, Bob is gone and Alice is sad and lonely. So every now and then she comforts herself by cradling something that reminds her of Bob; his clothing, a keepsake, a photo, something along those lines.

A particularly common version is hugging the headstone of somebody who has died or holding the body of a loved one for a prolonged period.

Sometimes part of a Sad-Times Montage or overlaps with a Lost Love Montage, and is likely to be done by a Heartbroken Badass. If a specific item is being held, it may be a Tragic Keepsake, especially if it came from someone whose death was a Cynicism Catalyst.

Compare and contrast Pietà Plagiarism, Cradling Your Kill, and Died in Your Arms Tonight.

Cradle of Loneliness Example in Anime & Manga

-   Played for Laughs in **Asteroid in Love**. In the beginning of the twenty-second chapter, adapted in the seventh episode, Mai is found holding onto Mikage's belongings in this position while going Ocular Gushers, still under the shock of being named as the club president.
-   In **Attack on Titan**, Armin holds onto the straw hat his grandfather had given him before being sent onto the pointless expedition to retake Wall Maria, to kill off a good portion of the citizens to avoid a food shortage, and cries into it when learning his grandfather was dead.
-   Fou-lu does this with Mami's bells in the Comic-Book Adaptation of **Breath of Fire IV** (and actually to a lesser extent in the original game as well). An especially tragic example as said Mami was literally used as the human warhead in a Fantastic Nuke in an attempt by the **very empire Fou-lu founded** to kill him. It merely makes him go Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds instead.
-   **Destiny of the Shrine Maiden**: Chikane holds Himeko's uniform this way when the latter is going shopping with Souma. Then things goes to hell in a vegetable basket.
-   In **Fist of the North Star**, Souther dies in the arms of his long-since mummified master.
-   Yuki Amano of **Future Diary** should be the poster child of this trope. After becoming the new God of Space/Time he is so crippled by the loss of his beloved that he just sits there staring at the last entry in his diary Yuno died for 10,000 years straight despite having just inherited god powers.
-   Hayate does this with the pendant left behind by Reinforce immediately after her Heroic Sacrifice in the last episode of **Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's**. The moment itself is also rather ironic, since Hayate spent most of her childhood as a friendless orphan, yet the first time she's ever shown to be lonely happened while she was literally surrounded by friends and family.
-   Shinn from **Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny** does it with his late little sister's cellphone.
-   **Puella Magi Madoka Magica**:
    -   Homura holds Madoka's ribbon this way after the latter's ascension into cosmic law.
        
        "Madoka... Madoka..."
        
    -   The Spin-Off manga **The Different Story** shows Mami Tomoe clutching Kyouko's ribbon in this manner in the final chapter, after she herself has committed suicide.
-   Near the end of the **Rurouni Kenshin** OVA **Trust and Betrayal**, Kenshin cradles the body of Tomoe after her death. Later we see Kenshin sitting under a tree with Tomoe's shawl wrapped around him. In a semi-reversal, we see the ghostly image of Tomoe wrapping her arms around him.
-   Usagi from **Sailor Moon** regards her music box locket this way when Tuxedo Mask is captured and brainwashed by the Dark Kingdom.
-   Despite its age and wear, Tsumugi of **Sweetness & Lightning** refuses to let Kouhei (her dad) replace her bag because it was handmade for her by her late mother.

-   **Robin (1993)**: After a particularly bad night in which he ended up getting to some hostages too late to save a man from being murdered right in front of his daughter and was then badly injured in a fight later on, Tim stumbled to his parents' joint headstone and clung to it briefly while lamenting his failure.

Cradle of Loneliness Example in Fan Works

-   In a really poignant scene, the protagonist of **Racer and the Geek** cradles his rifle while undergoing a mental breakdown.
-   In **A Prize for Three Empires**, Carol Danvers visits her friend Mar-Vell's grave and embraces the memorial stone, crying because of her inability to save him.
    
    She called the X-Men, as little as she liked it, and learned from them the location of the world where Mar-Vell had breathed his last. Then she went there, and saw his memorial stone, and embraced it.  
    She thought of the alien who had been a friend to her, who had enabled her to become a super-hero through a genetic gift. She wondered if, somehow, a transplant of genes or blood from her body to his could have saved him.  
    Probably not. The cancer was too far into him. But at least she would have tried.
    
-   A fanmade audiodrama for **Warhammer 40,000** starts off with a Blood Angels Space Marine breaking down in tears at the sight of the destruction of his beloved Land Raider IFV, whose Machine-Spirit he had bonded with. So deep is his grief that he hugs "her" with all his strength, and it is treated with all the gravity of finding a loved one Stuffed in the Fridge.
-   **Infinity Train: Knight of the Orange Lily**: Upon seeing Lampetia destroyed by Paul London, Specter is only given her heart to protect until she can regenerate her body. He can only clutch it in agony before screaming her name.

Cradle of Loneliness Example in Live-Action TV

-   **Better Call Saul**: Invoked by Jimmy after his reinstatement is denied because the hearing members didn't think he was sincere to his devotion to the law, as he never mentioned his late brother Chuck (the already strained relationship between the two deteriorated in the months leading up to Chuck's death, and Jimmy's suspension was because of Chuck to begin with, so it's clear Jimmy still holds a grudge). To make himself look better in the appeal, he makes several public displays of mock grief, including being seen cradling and talking to Chuck's tombstone (although the "talking" is just mumbling gibberish until someone gets close enough)

    On that bumpy road to love  
    Still I'll always,  
    Always keep the memory of  
    The way you hold your knife  
    The way we danced until three.
