Cast Full of Rich People: 
The Beautiful Elite are fun to watch. There's something satisfying in describing their Conspicuous Consumption, dressing them in beautiful and expensive Unlimited Wardrobes, and the shady or otherwise dealings that _keep_ them rich. There are so many settings in which the rich can play as well — they can be favored Old Money nobles in a Costume Drama, popular kids at a prep or Royal School, celebrities living large, cutthroat executives of high-powered companies, drug lords, heads of state, politicians, or politician-wannabes. Hence this trope, which is about when the majority of characters in a work are Rich People (maybe even Fiction 500) and the plot milks their glitz and glamour as much as it can.

One reason for this is that drama is heightened with such characters. Since they usually don't have to worry about financial problems (except for the Broke Episode), they can devote their time to all the Luxury Tropes the writers want to add in, like hosting lavish dinner parties on yachts, remodeling their Big Fancy Houses, living it up in affluent communities like Beverly Hills or the Hamptons, going on extravagant shopping trips and holidays, participating in high-stakes gambling, attending horse ballet, and other fun activities only the one percent can afford. This isn't necessarily good, however — the work may be out to portray them as out-of-touch and or stupid for the sake of comedy or drama, or as mean, ruthless, or corrupt so they can maintain or grow their finances.

Another reason might be Wish-Fulfillment on the part of the writers and audience, most of whom don't come from rich backgrounds. In fact, the term "wealth porn" was coined to describe society's almost morbid fascination with media depicting how the rich live, especially in a time of increasing income inequality. Because of this, works that utilize this trope will likely have a middle-class or poor character as an Audience Surrogate, reacting with shock or disgust as the real-life audience would to all the over-the-top wealthy shenanigans — see Penny Among Diamonds. This may cross over with Informed Poverty when even the supposedly not-rich surrogate still has the lifestyle trappings of their well-off peers.

The Ur-Example is probably the "silver fork novels" of the second quarter of the nineteenth century, telling melodramatic tales of aristocratic life with lots of Costume Porn and No Celebrities Were Harmed. In modern times, this trope crops up often in Prime Time Soaps and Reality TV.

Note that the main character/s don't have to be rich to qualify for this trope — but most of the characters they interact with must be. Conversely, if the main character/s is/are rich but everyone around them isn't, it isn't this trope either.

Cast Full of Rich People Example in Anime and Manga

-   **The Case Files of Jeweler Richard** focuses on Richard Ranasinghe de Vulpian, a well-off jeweler from a staggeringly rich family, whose family, work associates, and wealthy customers make up the bulk of the cast. Seigi, his two college friends, and his parents are the only ones not absurdly wealthy in the series—and it spends far less time on all but Seigi. Given how much Richard pays Seigi, their Relationship Upgrade to "partners," and Richard's lavish gifts, Seigi is hardly considered middle-class by the later books.
-   In **Hayate the Combat Butler** the titular character works for Nagi, heiress to the mind-boggling Sanzenin fortune. Most of Nagi's peers at her spiffy private school are very rich as well.
-   The cast of **Kaguya-sama: Love Is War** attends Shuchiin Academy, a school meant for Japan's wealthiest families, with the parents of most students being politicians, corporate CEOs, and so on. While Kaguya is the only one whose extreme wealth has much plot relevance, many students casually talk about having expensive vacations on cruise ships or to foreign countries. Student Council president Miyuki Shirogane, however, is from a poor family and only got into the school on an academic scholarship, and he works incredibly hard to keep his grades top-notch in part so the rich kids don't look down on him.
-   **Ouran High School Host Club**: Everyone except Scholarship Student Haruhi is fabulously wealthy, owning lavish mansions, artificial jungles, private islands, and **private armies**.
-   Implied in **Revolutionary Girl Utena**: the Student Council Duelists are implied to be made up of rich kids. Touga and Nanami are explicitly wealthy and live on an off campus estate, Miki and his twin sister live in an apartment by themselves and are shown to have a large house at home, Juri is a model, and Anthy and Akio have a Sleek High Rise Apartment and are close with the namesakes of the school. The only exceptions are Utena, an orphan, and Saionji, who seems to have a bad relationship with his family and has to ask Wakaba, a fellow student, to let him stay with her while he is expelled. The trope is downplayed in that the wealth of the characters rarely comes into play.

    -   **Glamorama** has a cast of fashion models who are secretly a terrorist cell.

-   **My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!** stars Catarina Claes, the daughter of a duke and the fiancee of a prince. Most of her friends and schoolmates at the kingdom of Sorcier's Wizarding School are wealthy nobles. One of the few exceptions is Maria, a commoner who happened to be born with the rare light magic (something that caused her to be mistaken for a noble's illegitimate child, since few besides nobles can use magic).

-   **Princesses of the Pizza Parlor**: The titular Princess Protagonists are automatically high-class / rich due to being princesses, but they also meet up and / or fight other current, former, and/or ancient and/or undead princesses / ladies of noble birth on their way to a point approximately on the other side of the world from their starting point. Their other enemies mainly have forsaken civilization by being bandits or worshipping a God of Evil, or are following the orders of a ruling figure like a tribal leader.
-   Due to its focus on politics, this applies to **A Song of Ice and Fire**. Most of the major characters are high-ranking lords and ladies of Westeros. With this status comes old estates, intricate costumes, jockeying for power in the Decadent Court, the works. There are some less well-off point of view characters (eg. Davos, Areo), but they tend to serve the nobility and provide insight on their lives. There are also some commoner POVs (usually one-offs for the prologue and epilogues) and supporting characters (such as those in Jon's and Arya's storylines), but these are the minority.
-   Leo Tolstoy:
    -   **Anna Karenina** is about the intertwined relationships of several families in the Russian nobility, with a focus on skewering the value system of Society at the time.

-   Played for Drama in **You (2015)** and its sequel, **Hidden Bodies**. All of the main characters are very wealthy, except Joe, who is legitimately poor, and the object of his affection, Starving Student, Beck, who is constantly broke just trying to fit in. Even more so in **Hidden Bodies**, where Joe moves to LA and almost every single major character is a trust fund baby and/or famous, and the "poorest" other character is a cop.

-   **Another Period** can be best described farcically as **Downton Abbey** meets **Keeping Up with the Kardashians**, set around the fictitious Bellacourt family in The Gilded Age. Daughters Lillian and Beatrice are only concerned with fame and wealth and actively shun any attempts at women's equality. The cast also includes maids and servants, who are constantly belittled by the Bellacourts and other bluebloods.
-   Played with in **Arrested Development**. The Bluth family is pretty well off when the series begins, but then patriarch George Sr. is arrested for various crimes and the company's finances are frozen. Much of the show involves the Bluths trying to adjust to "normal people" life while still trying to fit in with affluent society.
-   **Baby**: All the main students go to an elite private school in Parioli, a wealthy district of Rome, since it's also the place where the real-life scandal happened. Ludovica, however, is not actually rich, and is in danger of being kicked out of the school, since her single mother can't afford it.
-   Both **Beverly Hills, 90210** and its Sequel Series, **90210**, revolve around the lives of (mostly) rich Beverly Hills students attending West Beverly High.
-   **Big Little Lies** is about rich Monterey, California suburban moms whose priorities initially seem to be their wealthy families and their children's private-school activities. Their fashion and beautiful homes are given much focus by the Scenery Porn. Middle-class single mom Jane acts as the Penny Among Diamonds.
-   With a name like **Billions**, wealthy characters are certainly expected. The two main characters are rich, with Bobby Axelrod being a hedge fund billionaire, and Chuck Rhoades coming from a very rich Old Money, with his trust fund being locked on his own command, despite working as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Chuck's deputy prosecutor, Kate Sacker, also has a wealthy father and her own trust fund. Bobby's employees at Axe Cap, including Chuck's wife, Wendy, and associates, are also rich by working for him.
-   **The Crown (2016)**, given that it deals with a young Queen Elizabeth II and the rest of the British royalty and nobility, who lead appropriately lavish lifestyles. For example, Elizabeth sets out on a tour with a different hand-crafted gown each day.
-   **Dallas**, a primetime soap about a family of oil barons and their associates in Texas.
-   **Devious Maids**: While the maids themselves are not rich (except for Marisol, who's actually a college professor, going undercover as a maid), their employers belong to the rich and powerful who all live in Beverly Hills and always showcase their luxurious lifestyle.
-   Zig-Zagged on **Downton Abbey**. Half the cast is the wealthy Crawley family (though much of the plot is about them having money troubles and dealing with the decline of the nobility), and the other half is the people who work for them.
-   **Dynasty (1981)**, a primetime soap bout a family of oil barons and their associates in Colorado (fittingly a rival show to **Dallas**).
-   **Dynasty (2017)**, the remake of the above, is about the dealings of the extremely wealthy Carrington family within and outside their high-powered big oil conglomerate. Given this, schmoozing with other rich people is part of the show's bread and butter.

-   **Empire** is about the Lyons, a rich musician/corporate family, and their struggle to keep the family together and at the top of the music scene. Thus, many of the supporting characters are high-powered and glamorous as well.
-   **Falcon Crest** borrowed the **Dallas**/**Dynasty** template, but changed the liquid from oil to wine, and examined the lives of Napa Valley (well, actually Tuscany Valley) winemaking families.
-   **Filthy Rich** is about the life of a family of billionaire televangelists.
-   **Gossip Girl** focuses on wealthy Manhattan prep school students-cum-socialites who weave their way through New York's elite.

-   K-drama **The Heirs** centers around a group of wealthy young business scions, with Eun-sang as the commoner Penny Among Diamonds.
-   **House of Cards (US)**: The main characters, Frank and Claire Underwood, are definitely well-off.

Emily Thorne herself is rich as well, thanks to inheriting 49% share of Nolan's tech company, in which her father had invested.
-   **The Righteous Gemstones**: The show is about an insanely rich and dysfunctional family who lives lavishly, thanks to their success in televangelism and megachurches.
-   **Royal Pains**: It's about a concierge doctor catering to the wealthy patients in The Hamptons, so the show is practically surrounded by rich people.
-   **The Royals**: It revolves around the life of the fictitious dysfunctional British royal family, who showcases their glamorous and powerful life (notably shown when Cyrus becomes king). Its supporting characters are also from the wealthy and noble background.
-   Due to focusing more on the PRIDE families than the original comic (which had the kids run away right away and didn't give the parents much pagetime), **Runaways (2017)** becomes this. The main characters are six wealthy kids and their parents. The kids all go to a fancy Los Angeles private school, while their parents are big names in STEM (the Minorus, Steins, and Yorkeses), church (the Deans), and real estate (the Wilders) who cover up their villainy by pretending to be a group of Wealthy Philanthropists.

However, the main family is **very** dysfunctional, and the dynamic only worsens as the titular Succession Crisis comes to a head. Instead of enjoying their vast riches, they seem more concerned with **keeping** the wealth.
-   **The White Lotus**: Besides a few of the staff, the series mainly revolves around a set of wealthy guests who are all staying in suite rooms at the titular Hawaiian luxury beach resort.
-   **Will & Grace**: Out of the four main characters, three of them are well-off, with Will, a lawyer and later, law professor, and, Grace, an interior designer, living together in a nice apartment at Upper West Side, and also Karen, Grace's assistant, being an extremely rich multi-millionaire socialite.
-   **You (2018)**:
    -   Joe marries the super-rich Love and the two move to an opulent California suburb in season three, where they rub elbows with several obnoxiously rich neighbors.

-   **Fire Emblem: Three Houses** is set in a Military School for royals and nobles, so the majority of the cast are the offspring of rich landed nobility, with one imperial and one royal heir in the mix. There **are** a couple commoners accepted into the academy on their combat merits, as well as a handful of Impoverished Patricians, but they are the exceptions confirming the rule.

-   **Whateley Universe:** For reasons which no one has ever figured out, there is a disproportionately high rate of mutant manifestations among the uber-rich<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>; a disproportionate number of those are high-level Exemplars, too. While they are a relatively small part of the student body, the sway some of them hold over the rest of the school is substantial. In addition to the Golden Kids (the primary school club for the scions of wealth and prestige) and the Alphas (Whateley Academy's Absurdly Powerful Student Council), the leading members of groups such as The Good Ol' Boyz and the New Olympians are mostly well-off or better. Most of the Bad Seeds' parents are also wealthy, what with being successful supervillains and all. One of the primary characters, Phase, is from a family whose business is at the very top of the Fiction 500, and despite being disowned and left a mere pittance ($300 million), he has managed to turn his fortunes around before the end of his first year at the school. Even the founder of Faction Three, Thuban, is immensely wealthy (and good looking during the brief periods he can hold his human form), as is Tisiphone, one his primary supporters, though in their cases the good looks aren't part of the package.

-   **Beverly Hills Teens**: This animated series is about the lavish lives of the filthy rich teenagers who live in Beverly Hills, who all belong to a very fancy and palatial country club called Beverly Hills Teen Club.
-   The cast in **Neo Yokio** were wealthy socialites and demon hunter. Unfortunately, they were also mostly shallow, clothing and status obsessed Upper Class Twits.
-   **Totally Spies!**: The three main characters, Sam, Alex, and Clover, certainly come from money, as they live in the elite Beverly Hills (they lived in their mansions, before they live in a posh beach house together in later seasons) and love to go on numerous shopping sprees. Additionally, their arch rival, Mandy, is shown to be even richer than them.
