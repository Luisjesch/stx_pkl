Came from the Sky: 
Well, it's not a meteor...

_"Oh, it came out of the sky, landed just a little south of Moline  
Jody fell out of his tractor, couldn't believe what he seen  
Laid on the ground and shook, fearing for his life  
Then he ran all the way to town screaming "It came out of the sky."_

An object thought to be a meteorite will come crashing down to earth leaving a large crater, usually in the middle of nowhere, but farms are a popular target as well. The event will be noticed by someone (even in the middle of nowhere) who will be the first on scene to investigate (bonus points if it's a farmer with a shotgun).

What they find at the site will, 8 cases out of 10, be alien, and can range from fully grown adults, sometimes near death, to easily irritated hostile lifeforms, or just a baby. Other findings may include advanced alien tech, capsules holding something bad, or an actual meteorite with unearthly properties.

There's also a second type to this trope, where the impact happened a long time ago and the site was only recently discovered and excavated. Afterward, everything plays out the same.

Also see Magic Meteor, Thunderbolt Iron and Imported Alien Phlebotinum, and Icarus Allusion which can lead into this trope.

The third has his granddaughter, who restores his memories of being from another planet entirely.
-   In **Final Fantasy VII**, Jenova's is referred to in Ancient records as "the calamity from the sky". The far-northern site where she impacted several thousand years before the game is a massive crater called "the Northern Crater". The damage done to the (living) planet by this event still hasn't healed, which is why the north is so cold and barren (the planet is using all the local life energy to slowly repair the "wound"). The plan of the Big Bad is eventually explained to be a recreation of this event on an ''even larger scale''.
-   Halfway through **Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story**, you learn that an object known as The Dark Star landed in the Mushroom Kingdom some time in the past and was incarcerated to prevent it causing damage.

-   In **Command & Conquer,** the resource "Tiberium" arrives by meteorite strike on the banks of the Tiber River, Italy. It's a literal green rock that can be processed into fuel or metal; and since its self-replicating, it's a renewable resource.

    -   In **Command & Conquer: Tiberium Wars,** the Scrin can call down a tiberium meteorite as one of their Support Powers. It causes heavy damage and leaves a tiberium patch.

-   In **Kingdom Hearts**, the rulers of Radiant Garden sent their daughter (Kairi) to safety on...something...that would later crash down on the shore of Destiny Islands. Whatever it was, it must have been pretty high-octane to pierce the starfield between worlds. The soul-magnetising trinket that Aqua enchanted for Kairi in **Birth by Sleep** also helped.
-   **Darkest Dungeon**: The **Color of Madness** DLC centers around a comet that fell on a farmstead near the town. The comet contains a larval Eldritch Abomination, and the energies leaking out from the comet horribly warp the area and its inhabitants. The Miller, his farmhands, and his plow horses are turned into grey-skinned husks filled with crystalline growths, and the warping of time and space in the farmstead means that any enemy from another dungeon can also show up there.
-   The **Warframe** quest "The Duviri Paradox" begins... again! (whoops) when a mysterious detached hand crash-lands in the kingdom of Duviri, interrupting the endless cycle of Drifter's execution and fusing with their own hand, giving them a chance to escape.

-   This was shockingly common throughout most of the Cold War, starting at first with downed spy plane pilot Gary Powers. Yuri Gagarin wasn't much better, he parachuted into a farm independently of his space craft. A few of the early Venera craft failed and reentered and landed in both America and the Soviet Union. The probes were meant to operate on Venus and survived reentry, much to the shock of locals.
