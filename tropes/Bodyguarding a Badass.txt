Bodyguarding a Badass: 
**Underofficer Kanishka:** How are we supposed to be an imperial bodyguard if the damned Empress herself...  
**Commander Kungas:** You could always go back to work for Venandakatra. He never took any personal risks.

If you're important, then it's best to stay safe; all sorts of people might bear a grudge toward you for your decisions, because of who you are, because they want your job, or simply because you're important. This goes double in fiction, where there wouldn't be a plot if someone wasn't after your head. Thus anyone who's anyone needs a bodyguard to watch their back. The problem is, anyone who's anyone in fiction is also able to back it up.

This trope concerns bodyguards who are a lot weaker than their charges. Naturally, while there's often no explanation, it can be justified:

-   They also perform other functions such as being a Cloudcuckoolander's Minder or a general assistant who happens to be useful in a fight, or indeed they're there for everyone else's protection.
-   They came with the position, so the authority figure needs to keep them around as a sign of their office, if only for formal ceremonies. This especially applies to younger badasses, whose parents might insist they have protection.
-   Either the bodyguard or their charge likes having the other around.
-   Even a badass finds it useful to have someone else watching their back or keeping an eye out for threats. This goes double if the badass has some sort of weakness (secret or otherwise) in their fighting style or ability that the bodyguard can easily cover with their own skills.
-   So that the Hidden Badass can look as though they aren't as tough as they are.
-   The badass only knows lethal ways of fighting and has bodyguards who are trained in non-lethal techniques and crowd control, so he doesn't kill anyone he shouldn't.
    -   A celebrity badass might have bodyguards that help him get mobs of fans out of the way without hurting them, so he doesn't get sued.
-   The badass is a Glass Cannon, and the bodyguard is a Stone Wall.
-   The badass has a job to do other than fighting, or they want to conserve their strength for those moments when it's clearly needed. Thus they have bodyguards around to take the pressure off and allow them to focus on their main mission without unnecessary distractions.
-   The badass is simply not _that_ much more powerful than those around him, and can still use the help of a bodyguard.

Keep in mind that they must be specifically guarding or protecting their employer or have it designated as their main role; simply being a mook in their employ doesn't count (and indeed them being weaker than their boss is to be expected). Often they are used in fiction as a foreshadowing of just how badass the person they are guarding is and are frequently dangerous enough that they give the heroes a difficult fight, in some cases being on the same tier as the person they are guarding. Even in cases where they are Elite Mooks thrown to be Cannon Fodder, they can be used to effectively portray a Badass Crew who can easily kill the hero's weaker companions, if not outright be shown as a Badass Army.

Compare and contrast: Hypercompetent Sidekick (a reversal), Dragon-in-Chief (who is often more powerful than the Big Bad), and Bash Brothers (for when both bodyguard and client are equal in power), Violently Protective Girlfriend. Contrast Weak Boss, Strong Underlings. This can quite easily happen with a Hero Secret Service if The Hero being guarded is powerful and is to be expected in cases of President Superheroes. Often the result of Rank Scales with Asskicking.

## Examples:

Bodyguarding a Badass Example in Anime & Manga

-   Akira's bodyguards in **Ai Ore! Love Me!** follow him around because their sheer size discourages creeps from trying to assaulting their charge. Once a creep evades them, Akira has no choice but to make it clear **who** needs protection. In fact, all boys at Akira's all-boys school who know how much of a badass he is (and that includes his own bodyguards) are afraid of hitting any Berserk Button of his.
-   Mikasa to Eren in **Attack on Titan**. After Eren is revealed to be a Titan Shifter and pretty badass himself, Mikasa remains fiercely protective over him and is very competent at protecting him from any threat, human or Titan.
-   **Bleach**: Gemischt are generally considered weaker than Echt. However, they are also the front-line fighters in the fight against hollows and protect the Echt who don't fight unless both the Gemischt and Shinigami have fallen. Kanae Katagiri, a very capable warrior in her own right, was therefore not as powerful as her charge, Ryuuken Ishida. Quincies have no natural defence against hollow taint which can destroy their powers or even their lives. Tainted Gemischt are considered an acceptable sacrifice to keep Echt bloodlines pure. Some Echt have been willing to defy this rule, either openly (such as Masaki Kurosaki) or secretly (such as Ryuuken Ishida).
-   In **Case Closed**, an old man protects his late friend's nephew by pretending to be his late friend and having the nephew pose as the bodyguard. In reality, his goal was to be the decoy when one of the family members tries to kill the old man to get a larger inheritance.
-   Late in the run of **City Hunter**, Ryo, the best sweeper in Tokyo, found himself hired to guard Umibozu, the one man who can match him in a fight. Justified because Umibozu had gone blind and was being targeted by a dozen of other sweepers, so his fiancee Miki didn't want to take risks.
-   The most fearsome of the Werewolf Special Forces unit named Beowulf from **Dance in the Vampire Bund** are usually more dangerous than the ancient vampire queen they serve is, but not by all that much... and not at all when she unleashes the Super Mode she prefers to keep under wraps for political reasons.
-   **Dragon Ball**:
    -   **Dragon Ball Z**:
        -   Zarbon and Dodoria, Frieza's two chief enforcers, seem to double as bodyguards at first glance (flanking Frieza out in the field, controlling who gets access to him, etc.), in spite of Frieza being powerful enough to mop the floor with both of them even in his first form.
        -   Kibito to the Supreme Kai, who is known to be more powerful than he is.
    -   **Dragon Ball Super**: Zen'o, Top God of The Multiverse, has two bodyguards constantly flanking him. **Why** he would need bodyguards is an excellent question, considering he's confirmed to be more powerful than everyone else by quite a large margin. It's most likely that their job is to stop others from provoking Zen'o and getting themselves erased.
-   **Fairy Tail**:
    -   The Spriggan Twelve are the ruler of the Alvarez Empire Emperor Spriggan's bodyguards. The Spriggan Twelve are elite mages on par with the strongest mages Ishgar has to offer especially since God Serena, the strongest of Ishgar's Wizard Saints, recently defected to the Empire and is now one of the Twelve. Emperor Spriggan is supposedly even stronger since he's the guy who united the 730 guilds of the western continent into an empire through force **by himself**. Makes a lot more sense after Spriggan is revealed to be Zeref, the strongest mage in history who is also immortal. Indeed, Spriggan pretty much admits them being "bodyguards" is more of a formality and honor to recognize their abilities.
    -   In turn, many of the Spriggan 12 have their own personal squads or divisions within Alvarez's military, as they also hold the honor (and main role) of being the top of the military command. While they do have Elite Mooks or the odd boss-level one in their ranks capable of giving Fairy Tail and their allies trouble, their main purpose is to act as a stepping stone for the heroes to beat up in preparation for the **real** fight with the Spriggan in question.
-   In **Fullmetal Alchemist**, Colonel Badass Roy Mustang is the Flame Alchemist. He can blow up buildings and set fire to just about anything with (literally) a snap of his fingers. He's far and away the most dangerous of the State Alchemists. He has no fears for his own personal safety - not because of this, but because he's entrusted his back to Riza Hawkeye, one of the military's top snipers, who takes her job **very** seriously.
    -   Riza also doubles as Roy's Morality Chain, should he ever need it. He intends to become the country's leader through benevolent means, and has instructed her to kill him should he ever deviate to a darker path.
    -   There's also Ling and his subjects Fu and Lan Fan, who are his sworn protectors even though he can more than handle himself in a fight (especially once he becomes the second Greed). That said, they also have elements of the Cloudcuckoolander's Minder whenever Ling is in crouching moron mode.
    -   Every single bodyguard for Fuhrer Bradley counts as this, given that he is probably the most devastating fighter in the series. Even those who don't know that he's the homunculus Wrath are not surprised when he turns up to personally take the lead in a combat situation.
-   Every handler in **Gunslinger Girl** is a quite capable agent in their own right, being former soldiers or intelligence operatives. However their main job is to train the cyborg girls in combat skills. Once trained their cyborg then guards them in the field, and is in fact specifically conditioned to do so. Some of these handlers have a Career-Ending Injury that would normally bar them from field work, but their cyborg is assumed to be badass enough to protect them regardless.
-   The clansman for a king in **K**. While the king is stronger than all their clansman put together and are only rivaled by other kings, they still need support and assistance from their clansman to watch their backs.
-   **The Love and Creed of Sae Maki**:
    -   The Kigurumi Army will protect Sae with their lives. Sae is an incredibly fast and powerful Kick Chick on her own, capable of beating down Kokai during Sae's Court in a second, timed on-screen.
    -   Jin, the Maki family butler is capable of subduing Sae during her Sleepwalking Super Mode, but he still loses to her.
-   Household members in **Magi: Labyrinth of Magic** are people who protect and serve a dungeon master. The two most notable examples are the Eight Generals for Sinbad and Hakuei's Kouga Calvary.
-   **Medaka Box**: Zenkichi Hitoyoshi has made it his duty to be someone capable of protecting his childhood friend Medaka, despite the fact that she's far stronger than he is(though Zenkichi is no slouch either).
-   In **Naruto**, during the Kage Summit Arc, all five Kages (who are the best shinobi in their villages) pick a couple of guards to go with them. Despite the bodyguards being inferior to the Kages themselves, they are still very badass ninjas in their own right and often possess unique techniques that nobody else has. Many of the Kages' bodyguards are also their proteges and eventual successors, and a flashback shows that the same was true of the bodyguards at the original Kage Summit where **all** of the first Kages' bodyguards became the second or third Kage of their respective villages.
    -   Indeed so many bodyguards for the Kages ultimately become kage themselves that it seems likely the purpose of bringing them is specifically to train them for the political and diplomatic side of the leadership role.
-   **Negima! Magister Negi Magi**'s Kurt Godel shows up with a legion of armored mooks as a personal guard, claiming to have a fragile constitution. When shit goes down, they get knocked around as easily as Faceless Goons always do, and just when you're ready to see that Irritating Smirk get knocked off his face - it turns out he's basically the setting's most powerful swordsman.
-   **Pluto** has Epsilon, one of (if not **the**) most powerful robot in the world being guarded by a somewhat generic security robot. Said robot even remarks on the irony of it.
-   In **Snow White with the Red Hair**, price Zen has two bodyguards, Kiki and Mitsuhide. However, he's so highly skilled himself that they serve more as Fire-Forged Friends than guards.
-   In episode 2 of **Stella Women’s Academy, High School Division Class C³**, newbie Yura is assigned to bodyguard Sonora in the VIP Escort mission.
-   The Nine-Headed Dragon Generals from **3×3 Eyes** are a group of nine powerful and resourceful demons who have Undying Loyalty towards their master Benares and are willing to give their lives for him and take on any threat to his plans. Too bad Benares himself not only is an immortal Wu Genius Bruiser who knows over one hundred of Juuma (Demonic Beasts) summons, but also a millennia-old, dragon-shaped Eldritch Abomination, vastly more powerful than all of them combined. Most of the time he employs them to perform tasks for him while he's busy doing important stuff, and is actually angered when they fight in his stead.
-   In **Yona of the Dawn**, Yona insists that Hak, the Badass Normal of the group and can hold his own in a fight with the rest of the dragons, is to be protected.
-   In **Yu-Gi-Oh!**, Isono (Roland) to Seto Kaiba, ignoring the fact that Kaiba is constantly leaving him behind whenever he does get into actual trouble (when you might think a guy with a gun would come in useful). When he does keep him around, Isono is mostly reduced to making sure he doesn't get bothered by people who don't have appointments.

Bodyguarding a Badass Example in Comic Books

-   In the **Avatar: The Last Airbender** Comic-Book Adaptation, Zuko ends up neutralizing several nighttime assassination attempts on his own before his guards even show up.
-   Sasha Bordeaux from **Batman**, though badass in her own right, definitely qualifies, seeing as the guy she was hired to protect is Bruce Wayne. This eventually led to her deciding to take additional levels of badass to try to keep up with him once she knew who she was really protecting. It had gotten pretty bad when she was constantly getting ducked by her charge.
-   As the king of the fictional nation of Wakanda, Black Panther has a group of female bodyguards despite the fact that he is a Super Hero who has been a member of both the Fantastic Four and The Avengers.
-   In an Alternate Universe, Captain America became President of the United States. The Secret Service agents felt a bit unnecessary, with one even commenting that he felt safer with the President around.
-   Wong, faithful servant to Doctor Strange, has double duty as a bodyguard when Strange is distracted (e.g. while in Astral Projection) and a housekeeper/butler the rest of the time. He is also Strange's sparring partner.
-   In **House of M**, Rhino probably qualifies as the most useless bodyguard in the world (while serving as Spider-Man's bodyguard when Spidey was on good terms with Magnus).
-   Both the comic and film version of **Iron Man** has his personal assistant/driver and de facto bodyguard Harold Joseph "Happy" Hogan. Justified in that Happy is usually guarding Tony Stark while out of the armor (Tony usually has a spare suit of armor in his briefcase anyway) and is still officially his driver.
-   The Power Pack sometimes act as an unofficial bodyguard squad for Franklin Richards, one of the most powerful characters in the Marvel Universe. More justified since while Franklin is very powerful, he can't control his abilities and likely will never get full control of them.
-   Red Sonja has been accompanied by some Bodyguard Babes throughout her career, such as the Red Sisters in **Queen Sonja** and the twin sisters Ayla and Nias in Gail Simone's run. Typically, they are inexperienced young women unlike Sonja that act more like sidekicks rather than her bodyguards.
-   **Apparat Singles Group**: Simon Spector had a bodyguard, not because he needed one to protect him from threats but because all the fighting styles he knows are fatal.
-   **Star Wars: Legacy**: The Imperial Knights are an order of Grey Jedi devoted to preserving the Fel Empire and guarding the true Emperor Roan Fel, who is himself a master of the order. As is his daughter, Princess Marasiah. Though they are also sent on missions for the Empire and finally act as a safeguard in case the Emperor turns to the Dark Side.
    -   In **Superman**/**Masters of the Universe** crossover "From Eternia With Death", Prince Adam is bodyguarded by Teela, a member of Eternia's Royal Guard and a very capable warrior. However, Prince Adam's secret identity is He-Man, the Chanmpion of the realm. Whereas he can deal with anything Teela can handle, the opposite is definitely not true.
-   **The Transformers Megaseries**: Starscream was once Megatron's bodyguard. Megatron only kept him around for the sake of appearances, however, as he was more than capable of defending himself.
-   As a diplomat, Wonder Woman has at least once had a division of Secret Service agents (unpowered people with pistols and radios, mind you, not other Amazons) assigned to protect her. It is hard to imagine a threat they could defeat which would even give her as much as a scratch.

Bodyguarding a Badass Example in Fan Works

-   After they meet on the ship to the Divine's Conclave in **All This Sh\*t is Twice as Weird**, Mahanon serves as Victoria's bodyguard. It's purely a ruse to make people believe that he's not the stowaway he actually is; they both find it an extremely amusing one.
-   **The Bridge**: As part of his integration into Equestria, the transformed Godzilla Junior is recruited for the royal guard and eventually winds up as Princess Celestia and Luna's bodyguard. In their equine forms, Luna is roughly on par with him and has vastly more magical knowledge while Princess Celestia exceeds both of them physically and in terms of powers. However, it does come in handy to have another powerhouse around.
-   In **Dreaming of Sunshine** and as per canon, a Kage’s “bodyguards” are not so much there to defend their leader as to show off their village’s strength. At the Hidden Grass Chunin Exams, which all the major villages attend despite their tense relationships with one another, Tsunade has Kakashi as her bodyguard, while the Mizukage has Zabuza. And a year later, when Tsunade makes Shikako and Sasuke her bodyguards for the exams at Hidden Mist, everyone involved realizes that it's for their protection rather than hers.
-   The **My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic** fan fiction **Duel Nature** centers around Twilight becoming this for Luna. It's not so much that Luna needs guarding as Celestia is punishing them both for a Wizard Duel that got way, WAY out of hand. As with all of the assignments she receives from Celestia, Twilight takes the responsibility seriously.
-   In **Fate/Stay Night: Ultimate Master** has Ben Tennyson taking part in the Holy Grail War, and as such being granted his own Servant, Avenger. While Avenger is by no means weak (she can go on par with Saber), the fact that her Master is an **alien shapeshifting superhero** makes her look ridiculously underpowered compared to him. Later on though, she proves her usefulness and decides to make up for it by training Ben to use his aliens in coordination with her.
-   In **The Games We Play**, when Jaune enrolls in Haven, Adam's (disguised) presence is explained as him being a bodyguard. Jaune doesn't really need one. This becomes justified when hitting Jericho Falls; when Jaune's fighting the boss, even a small distraction can be fatal, so the rest of the team need to keep the riffraff off his back.
-   In The Hasbroverse, the current US President is Clayton Abernathy, otherwise known as General Hawk, and his bodyguards naturally have a tough time in keeping up with him.
-   In **Eye of the Storm**: Dante and Vergil have Servants while easily able to match them in combat.
-   **Infinity Train: Seeker of Crocus**: Lexi is Chloe's bodyguard in the sense that he's willing to protect her after she saved him. However, this iteration of Chloe Cerise has a **lot** more firepower from her cloak so Lexi is usually there to act as emotional support when she lets her emotions take over.
-   **Just An Everyday Princess**: A **My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic** fic that focuses on Twilight Sparkle returning to Ponyville after her coronation as an Alicorn Princess. She is assigned four unicorn stallions to serve as her personal bodyguards, despite Twilight being essentially a battle-hardened Warrior Mage, multi-time national heroine, and all-around badass which turns out to be completely unnecessary, as Twilight is completely immortal and being torn to shreds only slows her down. In the meantime, the bodyguards annoy Twilight by suspecting everyone and everything of plotting against her, going so far as to arrest Pinkie for kidnapping ( she was taking Twilight to a party) and Applejack for assault ( which actually **was** the case, but it was because of a misunderstanding which Twilight cleared up the first chance she got). They also attack Big Macintosh just for approaching Twilight and accused Zecora of conspiring against Twilight just because she's not from Ponyville.
-   In **Legionnaire**, Equestrian princess are protected quite well, in spite of generally being powerful enough to count as physical gods.
-   In the **Death Note** AU **Monster** much to his displeasure Aizawa gets stuck babysitting a "helpless" amnesiac L.
-   The **Pony POV Series** gives an explanation for this; the bodyguards aren't there to protect the Princesses, they're there so the Princesses don't need to risk accidentally harming innocent civilians defending themselves.
-   In the **Death Note** AU **Ragnarok (Skeptikitten)** after Loki challenges L and names Light Yagami, in this AU the NPA's rising star prodigy detective and L's rival, as his future victim. L responds by forcibly taking Light into protective custody-a task that was easier planned than done since Light has a blackbelt in judo and doesn't feel he needs L's "protection" nor does he wish to put others at risk guarding him when he can take care of himself.
-   **Seventh Endmost Vision** has Luxiere think about this trope when remembering his time in SOLDIER. Tifa was effectively acting as Aerith and Zack's bodyguard, but Aerith was the World's Strongest Woman and Zack was a 1st Class SOLDIER just like Tifa. It's clear that Tifa was mostly there to support her two best friends.
-   In **Thousand Shinji**, the Rubric Marines guarded Shinji while he healed Asuka's ravaged mind and during the Geofront Invasion. They were ghosts trapped into Powered Armor bodyguarding someone who was all but a Physical God at that point.
-   **TRON: Endgame Scenario**: Despite Flynn being a User (and therefore a Physical God on the system, Tron is still under a directive to safeguard him, taking the title of "Champion." The same ends up applying to Mercury; Jet may be a User (who hates the status), but he's an inexperienced one who is being trained by Mercury. And while Lora-Ma3a is powerful, she's a Squishy Wizard and **very** vulnerable with outside her Citadel, which means Mercury is her hands, eyes, and last line of defense.
-   **Wilhuff Tarkin, Hero of the Rebellion**: Lampshaded. In a pre-Clone Wars segment, Ventress goes to Eriadu as Dooku's bodyguard, but the narration points out he's actually more powerful than her, and the only reason she and the other Dark Acolytes at times guard him is that he's the Count of Serenno and the leader of the Confederacy of Independent System and thus he's **supposed** to have bodyguards, and trained Force users with lightsabers are rather showy ones.
    -   Tarkin appears as either the governor of the Seswenna sector (pre-Clone Wars segments) or an Imperial Moff or Grand Moff (post-Clone Wars segments). He has bodyguards, whose identity changes with the era... And in the right circumstances, he actually bested **Darth Vader**.
-   In **The Wizard in the Shadows** Emrys becomes Theodred's bodyguard after he saves his life. He swiftly becomes the stronger of the two.

Bodyguarding a Badass Example in Films — Live-Action

-   In **Air Force One**, the President is a former special forces soldier. So when terrorists slaughter the Secret Service agents assigned to guard him, he singlehandedly turns the tide back and kills them all.
-   In the final fight in **Equilibrium**, Brandt guards DuPont even though it is clear after Preston cuts off Brandt's face that DuPont is a master at Gun Kata. Before that, Preston had to mow down a group of imposing-looking Praetorian Guard in DuPont's office, who fell just as quickly.
-   In **Hero (2002)**, two assassins assault the imperial palace, cutting through a small army to do so. When they reach the emperor, the weaker of the two stays behind to hold off the whole army alone, while the other goes in to duel the emperor in single combat. "The Imperial Guard are not worthy of mention," indeed.
-   **The Hitman's Bodyguard** is entirely built around this trope, featuring **Ryan Reynolds** keeping **Samuel L. Jackson** alive so he can testify at a dictator's trial.
-   **Maleficent**: Diaval to his titular mistress. The most powerful of faeries rarely needs protection. And even then most of his own badassery and protective skills come from what **she** transforms him into.
-   Marvel Cinematic Universe:
    -   In **Captain America: The Winter Soldier**, Agent 13 was sent to guard Captain America, the greatest soldier of the 20th century.
    -   In the **Iron Man** series, Happy Hogan bodyguards Tony Stark, who by the midpoint of the first film has access to a suit of Powered Armor that makes him virtually unstoppable, making Happy mostly redundant. By the third movie, he's accepted a promotion to another job in Stark Industries, where he can actually be effective.
        
        **Happy:** I would tell people I'm Iron Man's bodyguard and they'd laugh at me!
        
    -   **Avengers: Endgame** has the scene with the Amazon Brigade trying to escort Captain Marvel, possibly the most overpowered character in the universe, on the way to the time machine.
-   **Star Wars**:
    -   The impressive-looking Imperial guard, who protect the Emperor, a Sith Lord who could wipe them all out single-handedly. And as seen in **Rogue One**, Darth Vader as well. They're never seen doing anything in the original trilogy (Palpatine even casually dismisses them when he and Vader bring in Jedi Knight and high-ranking Rebel Alliance hero Luke Skywalker, indicating that he didn't think he needed extra protection from the guards) and are dispatched without a fight in the prequels. Their presence is in large part related to Palpatine's whole public career being an elaborate Wounded Gazelle Gambit; he presents himself to the galaxy as a frail old man who had been badly crippled by the Jedi and who "needs" the protection, and only a relative handful of people know that he's actually a powerful Sith.
    -   General Grievous's custom droid bodyguards. Though not quite as strong as Grievous himself, they're still very tough and often help turn the tide in closely matched fights. Their **number** justifies the role.
    -   Like Palpatine, Snoke in **The Last Jedi** also has his cadre of elite Praetorian Guard. They are suitably dangerous in an actual fight, but their master can play ping pong with people without so much as moving a finger.
-   **Wonder Woman**: Zig-Zagging Trope. When confronted by would-be assassins in an alley, Steve Trevor's first instinct is to protect Diana. Once she proves fast enough to block bullets with her bracelets, she proceeds to protect him.
-   **X-Men Film Series**:
    -   **The Wolverine**: Yukio tells Logan, "Think of me as your bodyguard." Wolverine just eyerolls and goes with it. It's understandable in this case because Logan isn't used to fighting without his Healing Factor. The "everyone can use backup" reason is employed.
    -   **X-Men: Apocalypse**: It's the duty of each generation of the Four Horsemen to protect the god-like En Sabah Nur. He is vulnerable when he transfers his consciousness to another body, and his traitors in Ancient Egypt took advantage of this. Without the absolute dedication of his Horsemen, Apocalypse would've died when his pyramid collapsed.

Bodyguarding a Badass Example in Gamebooks

-   In **Way of the Tiger**, the book **Overlord** has the ninja protagonist Avenger now the ruler of Irsmuncast. So part of his duties is to choose the traditional bodyguard retinue, even though he's previously killed some of the most dangerous people in the world. He gets a choice between the Monks of Kwon where Avenger was raised with (the group that the locals are most expecting), the Shield Maidens of Damah who are the traditional bodyguards of Irsmuncast's rulers (choosing this one is surprising to the populace but acceptable) or he can choose a contingent of exiled samurai — these guys are incorruptibly loyal but as foreigners they'll decrease your popularity with the locals.

Bodyguarding a Badass Example in Literature

-   **Ascendance of a Bookworm**: The society is The Magocracy and whoever is leading any given territory is expected to be the most powerful adult member of the most powerful family of the land. Every single child they produce or adopt **has** to get the necessary education to become a territory leader themselves, both because magic level is more important than birth order and because whoever ends up being the heir has a non-negligible chance of dying of something else than old age. Those people need guards due to status alone. Learning how to fight properly is an educational path in its own right, which means one has to either be technically out of the line of succession or do the equivalent of a second degree to be able to work as a bodyguard. As a result, bodyguards of the leading family are often weaker mages than their charges.
-   In the **Belgariad** prequel novel **Polgara The Sorceress**, several people insist on bodyguarding Polgara during her centuries-long tenure as Benevolent Mage Ruler of Erat. Some she accepts for personal reasons, or to emphasize the dignity of her office. In one **other** case, she transforms the man into a mouse, becomes an owl herself, and carries him to their destination in her claws as a pointed reminder of her power.
-   **Chrysalis** by RinoZ: Anthony eventually becomes the strongest ant in the Colony, but after seeing how often he gets into trouble, the Council trains up a group of twenty secret bodyguards, to specialise in stealth Skills and watch from the shadows. Anthony eventually catches them out, and admonishes them to spend a bit less time hiding and a bit more time levelling up.
    
    **Anthony**: After I evolve, I'm going to be tier six! We've had this conversation before, if you twenty can't keep up with me, then you can hardly protect me from something I can't defeat myself! I need every one of you to max out your cores and mutations and prepare for special evolutions. Every one of you needs to be tier five by the time this wave ends.
    
-   When **Conan the Barbarian** becomes King of Aquilonia, he's often protected by a retinue of his elite Black Dragons. None of them can match their liege, but they're still great warriors and Conan had spent years as a general so now appreciates having his own men help him mob an enemy in a fight.
-   **The Dresden Files**:
    -   John Marcone; an ex-special ops mafia lord capable of taking down all kinds of supernatural nasties without flinching- but his best friend Hendricks works as his bodyguard anyway. Somewhat justified in that if the public knew about his badassery, it'd just be one more proof that he actually does run the Mob, and his life's easier if they're kept in the dark. Also, Hendricks is a Genius Bruiser<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> who's very tall and strong, thus often able to protect his boss from more mundane threats (and his bulk ensures that many won't even try).
    -   The Archive, the living repository of all accumulated written knowledge with incredible magical power and the ability to destroy several millennia-old monsters while being limited to the power in the air around her. And her bodyguard, Kincaid. The Archive is a young girl and can't drive herself around.
        
        "My feet don't reach the pedals."
        
        -   Their skills also complement each other; while Kincaid does not, as far as anyone knows, have a drop of magic, he is a Badass Normal with centuries of experience with mortal weapons.
-   In **The Girl from the Miracles District**, Aleks sends Nikita - a professional assassin and a berserk - a Badass Biker gang to act as her bodyguards while she's in Norway. She ends up saving them more often than they save her.
-   **Harry Potter**:
    -   Harry is occasionally given an escort by the Ministry of Magic or the Order of the Phoenix, despite having survived facing Voldemort in five out of five encounters. Then again, Harry **is** just a child...
    -   The Order does make sense, and Harry gladly accepts their protection (at least until he gets worried they'll be hurt for him), but he does get visibly annoyed when an Auror in a suit tries to manhandle him.
    -   Hagrid acts as this in **Deathly Hallows**, when he's the one guarding Harry as he leaves Privet Drive. Although he is impervious to many spells due to being a half-giant, as a wizard he's basically a third-year with a broken wand. This is to exploit the trope. Their enemies, the Death Eaters, don't expect Harry to be with a bodyguard who's weaker than himself, so the Death Eaters mostly ignore Hagrid and instead go for the strongest Order member, Mad-Eye Moody, while Hagrid is able to escort Harry safely to his destination (and it probably would have worked almost perfectly if Harry didn't give himself away with his Signature Move).
-   In **Heralds of Valdemar**, the Monarch's Own Herald is also the royal bodyguard, especially during state functions. Since Valdemaran law requires that the Monarch and the Heir be Heralds, it's assumed that they **could** defend themselves if needed, but 1) there's no point in broadcasting that fact to would-be assassins, 2) traditionally, crowned heads leave the fighting to others, and 3), one of their enemies has portal magic and a gigantic army at its disposal.
-   **Honor Harrington** is well-trained in both armed and unarmed combat techniques, so almost anyone set to guard her (and there's **always** someone guarding her from the third book on) is almost guaranteed to be less skilled in combat than she is. Well, except when their name is Andrew LaFollet and the pulser darts have started flying. Honor, an exceptional shot herself, is awed by LaFollet's skill in a firefight. Nevertheless, her armsmen still make her much safer — by providing strength in numbers, by keeping 100% attention on her safety when she's distracted by other matters, and by making the occasional Heroic Sacrifice in her stead.
-   In the **Horus Heresy** novels:
    -   Many of the Primarchs are guarded by a Praetorian Guard, which they of course don't actually need, being so badass themselves. It's lampshaded by Corax on one occasion and summed up by Guilliman on another:
        
        **Faffnar**: If you were, say, without your bodyguard and cornered in a room with us-  
        **Guilliman**: My dear Faffnar, then **you** would be cornered in a room with **me**.
        
    -   Then, of course, there are the Custodians, who serve the same function to the Emperor of Mankind, a being so powerful, he's worshipped by an increasing number of people as a Physical God, so anything that could threaten him would probably wipe the floor with the entire order. The Emperor is well aware of that and uses them mostly as a rapid strike force and Imperial Palace guard.
-   Discussed in **The Inheritance Cycle** with Nasuada's bodyguards. Their leader points out that while Nasuada is quite capable of handling herself in a fight, if she has enough attempts on her life, eventually someone's going to get lucky. The bodyguards are there not just to stop attackers, but to make her **appear** so well protected that people won't try in the first place.
-   The Steel Inquisitors from **Mistborn** are incredibly badass, but their boss the Lord Ruler, who they guard as part of their duties, is **far** more powerful. Mostly, they're there so he doesn't have to soil his hands with grunt work if he doesn't want to (and as a group, they're also in charge of policing his empire, though he's almost always accompanied by a handful). And having Inquisitors is incredibly useful for the times when, to satisfy the Equivalent Exchange aspect of his magic, the Lord Ruler has to regress for a few hours into a withered old man rather than a nigh-invincible Physical God.
-   In **The Irregular at Magic High School**, the Yotsuba used mercenaries (and later Guardians) to protect themselves because their elitism precluded them from doing any work they could shift onto others. Bodyguards also buy time for their masters to escape battles that **can't** be won, and specialize in very useful defensive magic that the clan does not. There have been two situations where bombs and long-range military guns were deployed against the Yotsuba. In both cases, the targets only survived because a Guardian was there to kill themselves absorbing the force of the blast. Magic is advanced, but not nearly advanced **enough** that magicians are safe.
-   It's a traditional combat role in **Mother of Demons** where the War-Mothers deploy with a full bodyguard 8 or 12-strong whose sole role is to force enemies to face the War-Mother head-on, allowing her to flatten them.
-   In **Nano Machine**, Chun Yeowun's servants always insisted on having him guarded by at least one of them, despite knowing that he's much stronger than them. Yeowun didn't hate the idea, but he sometimes wandered off alone and forgot to let them know his whereabouts, making them worried sick.
-   In the **Prince Roger** series, Roger is not as combat- or life-experienced as his bodyguards, but he's a better shot than any of them, and has lightning-fast reflexes thanks to genetic enhancement. On more than one occasion, he overrides their attempts to keep him out of the line of fire by demonstrating that he's better for the job at hand than they are.
-   **The Queen of Ieflaria**: Lisette is Esofi's bodyguard, who's quite a skilled warrior on her own.
-   In David Drake's **Redliners**, early on the major has a bodyguard whose sole purpose is to keep the major from doing anything stupid like trying to lead an assault from the front; his job is to lead, not be a badass, though badass he is.
-   **The Reynard Cycle**: The Graycloaks that Reynard surrounds himself with in **Defender of the Crown** are no match for him. When he is directly threatened, he tends to wave even their captain aside.
-   **A Song of Ice and Fire**:
    -   Nobles and landed knights have access to the best training and equipment, making them typically some of the best fighters in the Seven Kingdoms. They'll always have guards at their keeps and will travel with men at arms for protection, even though most are almost surely better armed and trained than the men they command. However this is justified as safety in numbers - a single noble warrior, no matter how well trained and equipped and how personally skilled he is, would be vulnerable to getting Zerg Rushed by superior numbers of lesser opponents. Combat Pragmatism is also fully in effect, so getting caught off-guard is an obvious worry.
    -   All Dothraki khals have a group of bloodriders who dedicate the rest of their lives to protecting him. Dothraki khals are typically the most badass fighter of the khalasar, so presumably the khal could kick his bloodriders' asses.
    -   Another example comes with Melisandre, who didn't have any fear of being attacked, but still had guards about her person to maintain an aura of importance while thinking about "the trappings of power."
-   In **The Sorcerer's Receptionist**, Nanalie's innate magic makes her a Living Macguffin and state asset who other groups would very much like to capture or kill. However, Doran is a good kingdom that practises freedom of occupation, and her chosen occupation is not in any of the loops about her. So, yeah, people get hurt for a civilian who will never know their sacrifice and could help them out a lot. It's part of the job. And the civilian in question isn't all that wise, so it's probably for the best she isn't motivated to throw WMD-level magic around.
-   In **Star Trek: The Eugenics Wars**, Gary Seven and Khan are at the South Pole trying to deal with a scientist who's developing technology that allows for control of the atmosphere. They take care of the bodyguard rather easily but are both overcome by the scientist. It's later revealed that the scientist is immortal and after being everyone from Alexander the Great to Cesar, he's learned to take care of himself.
-   In **The Stone Prince**, Demnor actively leads his bodyguard in the defense against a combination castle assault/assassination attempt. While they do take blows for him, he dishes out most of the damage. His fiancee kills quite a few people too.
-   Richard in the **Sword of Truth** series is quite aware of his own badassery—he's both one of the greatest swordsmen alive and an extremely powerful if untrained wizard—but has never ruled before, so he doesn't understand the need for bodyguards at first. Then one of said guards points out that if nothing else, he needs to **sleep**. Eventually he grows used to the entourage someone of his high-rank demands.
-   Armsmen tend to be this in **Vorkosigan Saga**. Some justify this by doubling as a Battle Butler (doing more mundane tasks as well as serving as guards). Also the Armsman might be assigned to protect a dependant, a guest or whatever.
-   This is actually a normal battle tactic in **The Way of Kings** when generals are often the ones with Shardplate and Shardblades; they are devastating in close-quarter combat but could be defeated by being pulled down by the sheer weight of enemy troops, so they are accompanied by an honour guard of soldiers with more normal weapons and armour to stop this happening.
-   In **The Wheel of Time**:
    -   The Maidens of the Spear are an Amazon Brigade who become bodyguards to Rand al'Thor, who is The Chosen One and the son of a Maiden. As he is a Master Swordsman and a magical Person of Mass Destruction, they can't match him for power, but given the many threats against his life, he's glad for the extra sets of eyes, especially when he needs to sleep.
    -   The Seanchan Empress is trained to be an efficiently deadly fighter: she has an elite bodyguard and a Battle Butler, but is expected to be her own last line of defense.
-   Vaness of **The Witchlands** is one of the most powerful witches to ever live, having once brought down an entire mountain on her enemies' heads. Nonetheless, she has an elite Praetorian Guard, because while's she's powerful, she's still a squishy human.

Bodyguarding a Badass Example in Live-Action TV

-   In **Arrow**, John Diggle is hired to be Oliver Queen's bodyguard. However, Ollie keeps giving him the slip, and Dig quickly learns that Ollie is much more badass than himself and moonlights as a vigilante. After some hesitation, he keeps the position to be secretly Ollie's associate and hoping to become a Morality Chain for him, while still handling the security of the Queen family. Dig is still badass enough to help the vigilante on his missions and put on the hood a few times himself.
-   Discussed on **Babylon 5**: Ta'Lon, a Narn soldier that Captain Sheridan had previously saved, declares his intention to return the favor by protecting Sheridan, whether Sheridan wanted it or not. That said, his own duties prevented him from acting on this intention.
-   **Daredevil (2015)**:
    -   After he gets arrested, Frank Castle is placed under very heavy police guard while in the hospital. It's not to protect others from him. It's to protect **Frank** from the gangs he was targeting. Which is why the police have an ESU team planted on his floor, and all visitors' bags get searched twice to make sure no one's smuggling in a weapon, etc.)
    -   Benjamin "Dex" Poindexter in season 3. Wilson Fisk is more than capable of fighting. But Dex not only bodyguards Fisk, he also does a lot of Fisk's dirty work and proves to be a very difficult opponent for Matt to take on in one-on-one fights.
-   **Deputy**: Bishop is Hollister's driver and bodyguard. He is quite a capable man even without having them, though Bishop's definitely skilled themself.
-   In season 7 of **Dexter**, Big Bad Isaak Sirko usually goes around with a bodyguard that does nothing other than looking intimidating, as Isaak does all the killing by himself.
-   In **Game of Thrones**, Khal Drogo has bloodriders who protect him even though he shows that he's perfectly capable of killing even his battle commanders at will. This is typical for the Dothraki (his tribe) as they follow only the strongest, so their leader the **khal** must, by definition, be more badass than his bloodriders.
-   **Kamelott**:
    -   Several episodes have Arthur being told he needs a bodyguard, despite his objections. Arthur isn't extraordinarily badass, it's just that everyone else (including the enemies) is so very incompetent (including his official bodyguard Grudu, who makes it his mission to kill anyone who tries getting close to the king, including the queen, the Knights of the Round Table, and the servants who light the lamps).
    -   One episode has Perceval form a royal guard... with his cousins, each of which was cast out by the family for being too stupid. The only thing they can do is run away when given the order to stand at attention.
-   Subverted on **Merlin**. Arthur is the best swordsman in the Five Kingdoms and can defeat two or even three other swordsmen blindfolded. He has a servant who watches his back on missions. Subverted in that the servant is Merlin, who can kill you with his brain, making him the more badass of the two.
-   In the Special Act of **Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon**, the now Brought Down to Normal Minako has a group of bodyguards. When she's attacked by the Pierrots, her outnumbered and outmatched guards try and gain her time to escape, but one of the Pierrots manages to pass and attack her... And is promptly kicked in a concrete column hard enough to **crack it** (this after Minako lampshaded the situation). At the sight the Pierrots stop fighting and start to slowly back away.
-   In the pilot of **Star Trek: The Next Generation**, Captain Picard says dryly of Riker's duty to keep him out of harm's way that "When you've come back alive as often as I have, you'll have someone to protect you too."

Bodyguarding a Badass Example in Tabletop Games

-   Chess: Played with. The pawns start off in front of the far more powerful pieces. The king himself however is not very much of a badass. The queen on the other hand...
-   The Bodyguard advanced class in d20 Modern. Now, considering the average d20 Modern party, he is probably protecting a Glass Cannon by taking and surviving hits meant for his partner.
-   In **Dungeons & Dragons**, Glass Cannon characters like wizards can deliver extremely powerful attacks, but get a lot of use out of fighters who can run interception on enemies.
-   In White Wolf's **Street Fighter: The Storytelling Game** RPG you could get bodyguards as a perk — it was explained that they were capable of getting people out of the way without hurting them, so a fighter didn't end up getting sued.
-   In **Traveller**, High Imperial Nobles have Huscarls even though they themselves might well be a badass.
-   **Warhammer 40,000**: Space Marine Honor Guards are deployed to protect the Chapter Master, who did not get to his position by being a pushover. Then again, the Honor Guard is basically just an excuse to get as many badasses on the battlefield as possible.
    -   Prior to that, the Primarchs and the Emperor had guards of Space Marines and the **Adeptus Custodes** respectively. Though the Custodes also had the task of handling security, verifying visitors' identities, and guarding the palace itself. And in their case, the trope used to apply back when the Emperor was ambulatory and a contender for the most powerful **creature** in the galaxy, leaving even the Custodes (who are like a Space Marine **squared** in terms of genetic enhancements, training, and equipment) behind; now that he's a corpse on life support, it no longer applies.
        
        **Corax, Primarch of the Raven Guard:** That was for appearance. Do you think I actually **need** a bodyguard?
        
    -   Ork Warbosses usually surround themselves with a retinue of Nobz, either in Mega-Armor or 'Eavy Armor, as a bodyguard. However due to the nature of Ork society and biology, the Warboss is usually the most powerful Ork on the planet. This is more because Orks tend towards mob mentality but the Boss only allows the biggest and baddest Orks under him to be around him.
    -   Hive Tyrants and the Swarmlord are usually the most powerful Tyranids on the battlefield short of bio-titans (and even then they can probably take a few on and still win). However because they also act as a conduit to the Hive Mind, they usually go into battle with a retinue of Tyrant Guards specifically bred to take hits for them. The Tyrant Guards are specifically rendered weaker and dependent on the Tyrant so that they would be blindly loyal to the one they're protecting, even if it means their own lives are taken.
    -   Chaos Lords are often surrounded by a retinue of Chosen, his own hand-picked elite warriors from his warband. Unlike their loyalist counterparts, this is more of a pragmatic move; the Chaos Lord chooses them not only for their combat prowess, but also to keep an eye on potential usurpers against him. The Chosen are perfectly content with this arrangement, as they can enjoy some measure of protection from their Lord and respect from their peers until it is time for them to either break off on their own or kill the lord.
    -   Subverted with Angron, primarch of the World Eaters, who wanted nothing to do with his bodyguards; they kept trying to prevent him from getting too deep into melee combat. The Devourers were actually among the **weakest** in his Legion.
    -   Dark Eldar Incubi rent out their services to Archons who can afford them. This is because where Dark Eldar society functions on Klingon Promotion, the Incubi are motivated solely by their pay (which they can't collect if their employer is dead). That said, promotion within Incubi kabals still follows the Klingon model.
    -   Eldrad Ulthran, High Seer of Craftworld Ulthwe, is one of the most powerful living psykers in the galaxy and a superlative warrior to boot. That said, he rarely takes the field without his Seer Council, each member of which is a powerful witch-warrior him or herself.

Bodyguarding a Badass Example in Video Games

-   Edge in **Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War** assigns herself to this role after Bartlett was shot down protecting her, and does not let up guarding Blaze (i.e.: you) for the duration of the game.
-   **Arknights**: Operator Matterhorn is a bodyguard of operator SilverAsh - his Razor Wind\-slinging boss, who is a 6-star unit to his bodyguard's 4-star rarity. Matterhorn mostly functions as family butler, and became SilverAsh's bodyguard because his family serves as Praetorian Guard to the Silverashes.
-   In the Arland Trilogy of Gust's **Atelier Series**, Gio, the king (and later president) of Arland who firmly subscribes to the Asskicking Leads to Leadership School naturally incurs this. It gets to the point that those tasked with protecting him pretty much resign themselves to the fact that their real job is to both try and keep up, and stop him from causing too much trouble.
-   **BlazBlue**: Valkenhayn is a centuries-old werewolf Battle Butler and one of the fabled Six Heroes, and can still kick tons of ass despite his advanced age. His master Rachel is a **millennia**\-old vampire who is also proficient with magic, an Observer (a nigh-invincible All-Powerful Bystander), and can not only defeat most of the cast without so much as breaking a sweat but also tank a blast from a city-leveling superweapon.
-   **Dawn of War**:
    -   Most non-squad units can be attached to a squad, giving the unit greater survivability and usually providing benefits to the squad like increased morale or damage. The AI doesn't use this except during Assassination games, where they're attached to the first produced squad. It's just **sad** to see a Force Commander stuck in a squad of scouts when there are Terminators and Grey Knights available.
    -   The Imperial Guard's Hero Unit consists of an Imperial general and his retinue (commissars, psykers, and priests), who is the Guard's **only** competent melee unit until they reach the final tier and get Ogryns. In the campaign, the squad can also take on Kasrkin bodyguards, though they're more useful at range.
    -   The campaign gives the Tau unique Fire Warrior bodyguards with extremely long range. The Ethereal can summon such squads, but unlike the Guard, he causes massive morale damage to **every** Tau unit if he dies, and doesn't even have a ranged attack. Doesn't stop the AI from sending him running headlong into battle.
    -   Highlighting 40K's Crapsack World nature, several honor guard units have descriptions implying they're here both to bodyguard the leader **and** keep an eye on/remove him in case of failure.
-   Playing as Emily Kaldwin in **Dishonored 2**, can definitely qualify. She clearly learned much from Corvo during both installments, as she uses stealth, weapons, and magic (possibly) to defeat her opponents. Despite this, depending on the ending, Corvo can still stay by her side as Royal Protector. **Death of the Outsider** DLC established that Emily canonically received the Mark from the Outsider and Corvo returns to being her Royal Protector.
-   In **Dragon Age: Inquisition**, the Iron Bull effectively volunteers to be this for the Herald of Andraste. When he and his mercenary company are recruited, he points out that while yes, the Chargers are an excellent company who will be a fine addition to the Inquisition, they're also getting **him**, and he is more than willing to act as front-line bodyguard for Andraste's chosen. His specialization tree even has an ability that will cause him to do exactly that in combat.
-   Your bodyguards in **Dynasty Warriors**, at least for the PS2 games. You can have anything from 1 to 8 bodyguards (only 1 in DW5), despite the fact that you're probably tough enough to wipe out a good chunk of the enemy. Justified for some pretty obvious reasons (You're pretty important to your faction, and it wouldn't be good to just let you run off without some protection), along with the fact that the bodyguards are useful enough to help you do more than you could alone.
-   **The Elder Scrolls**:
    -   In the series' mythology, Shor (the old Nordic aspect of Lorkhan), was a "bloodthirsty warrior king". He was served by two other gods who served as his "shield-thanes", Stuhn and Tsun (the old Nordic aspects of the Aedric Divines Stendarr and possibly Zenithar, respectively). Tsun continues to guard the Hall of Valor in Sovngarde, ensuring that only the greatest warriors may enter Shor's hall.
    -   In a similar vein, the Aldmeri ancestor spirit Trinimac was said to be the "champion" of Auri-El, the Aldmeri aspect of Akatosh. Trinimac was a warrior spirit, said to be the strongest of the et'Ada ("original spirits"), and in some places was even more popular than Auri-El. According to Aldmeri religious tradition, it was Trinimac who led the Aldmeri armies against Lorkhan's supporters, the races of Men. Trinimac slew Lorkhan and removed Lorkhan's heart from his body. However, Trinimac would later be "eaten" by the Daedric Prince Boethiah so that Boethiah could manipulate Trinimac's followers. After being tortured in Boethiah's stomach, the remains of Trinimac were "excreted". These remains became the Daedric Prince Malacath and his remaining followers were transformed into the Orsimer (Orcs). Malacath somewhat confirms this story, but complains that it is "too literal-minded".
    -   The highest level of Dremora you can encounter (or summon) in Elder Scrolls games are Valkynaz, said to be the Praetorian Guard to their lord, Mehrunes Dagon. When fully manifested into the physical plane, Mehrunes Dagon turns out to be a hundred-foot-tall, rampaging Destroyer Deity who is completely invulnerable to anything less than the avatar of another god. Since he presumably derives no actual protection from the human-sized Valkynaz, the implication is that this is largely a case of Elites Are More Glamorous.
    -   **Skyrim**:
        -   Early in the main quest you're given the title of "Thane" when it becomes clear that you're a Dragonborn. As a result, you're assigned a personal Housecarl named Lydia. Since this is a sandbox RPG this trope is inevitable no matter how powerful she is (although you can give her better equipment to keep her useful). Other companions (including housecarls you can get from other settlements) who're supposed to serve as bodyguards also fall into this.
        -   On the other hand, this can be completely averted if the games' leveling mechanic is properly manipulated. Housecarls' levels are not set until you encounter them for the first time, and some of them do not exist until after they are assigned to you (via completing the necessary quest). There have been tales of players completing quests 30 levels after they were meant to be completed, only to be assigned Housecarls who, among other things, kill entire cities solo after their Thane stole a single sweetroll (thus angering all the guards), or slaying Ancient Dragons in single combat (while their Thane chases butterflies across the countryside).
        -   Galmar Stone-Fist is this for Ulfric Stormcloak. Yeah, Galmar is a tough bastard, but he can't blow you across the room by shouting. Ulfric can.
-   In **Fire Emblem** your lords (probably fully trained and with unique powerful equipment if level 1) usually have a few escorts including a Crutch Character. It is fully possible for the lord to completely eclipse every bodyguard they get, but they will still have them as backup with the same job. Frequently, royalty from aligned countries have their personal guard join your fight. Then when the royal joins as well they outstrip their guard.
-   Multiple playable characters of high status in **Genshin Impact** have voice lines where they declare the Traveler to be their bodyguard. Being playable characters, they're all perfectly capable of handling themselves in a fight.
-   In **Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas**, The player can recruit Grove Street members to come along with him for various reasons, it is strange considering CJ can master the use of every weapon, drive a tank, an army jet, and an attack helicopter.
-   **GreedFall**: One of De Sardet's companions is Kurt, who is their master of arms as well as personal body guard. He'll even make a comment that it's not like De Sardet exactly needs him to be their bodyguard anymore.
-   Potemkin of the **Guilty Gear** series is the top bodyguard of President Zepp. President Zepp however is no idle politician, and has proven on several occasions he is **far** stronger than his **9 foot tall** mass of muscle bodyguard.
-   In **Kid Icarus**, Palutena is a badass but often serves as the mission control (and despite her losing to Medusa in the first game after the war they had). Pit protects her regardless of how powerful she is and in her **Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U** trailer, Palutena shows off her abilities and Pit even comments, "You don't have to prove anything, Lady Palutena."
-   **You** get a bodyguard of sorts in **Might & Magic VII**, once you complete the first Wizard's Promotion Quest and don't build the golem wrong by using the Abby Normal Head. The golem remains in the main hall of your castle and fights on your side if any hostile monsters show up there, which is incredibly useful if the siege of Harmondale after you choose a Path happens (the goblins and swordsmen who invade the castle will barely be able to scratch it) or if any random encounters happen there if you use the place to rest. (The only random encounters that might happen are goblins, bats, or rats, which you could likely defeat yourself at this point, but seeing as you might be unconscious when you rest and could be killed by even one attack if ambushed, it might still be a good idea to do so with the golem nearby.)
-   Shao Khan, the Big Bad of **Mortal Kombat**, seems to always keep a few of his minions around for this purpose; in fact, in **9**, that seems to be part of Sheeva's job description. Curiously enough, it's also Jade's job for her best friend Kitana.
-   Oddly enough, if you can shoot well, the guards assigned to protect the border in **Papers, Please** are this. One even lampshades how his aim sucks compared to a paperwork inspector with no formal training.
-   Roadhog of **Overwatch** is the hired muscle/protection of Junkrat. His position of bodyguard seems more of a title however, as Junkrat is a fearsome fighter in his own right.
-   **Red Alert 3**:
    -   "Barbarians At The Bay" gives you a few ninja to guard your Yuriko clone, who by that point just slaughtered a platoon or two of soldiers and a couple of Land Battleships. Note that they actually are quite necessary (especially if going for the easier-in-the-long-run option of taking out the enemy base with Yuriko), as despite being a Person of Mass Destruction, Yuriko is very much a Glass Cannon and can only destroy units one at time.
    -   The Yuriko mini-campaign shows how much more powerful Yuriko is compared to her clones (giving her, among others, an Attack Reflector, a mind control ability and the ability to send random objects/people/vehicles flying into each other), but her mind control (which automatically makes affected enemies guard her) is very much necessary to prevent her from being overwhelmed.
-   In **Saints Row IV**, the Boss gets elected President of the United States, which naturally nets them a Secret Service detail, which they do not need. When the Zin invade Earth, the Boss gets crash tackled by his Secret Service agents, only to throw them off, run to the Oval Office to get a gun, and pretty much single-handedly retake the White House.
-   Akashi of **The Secret World** has the honor of protecting Gozen, leader of the Jingu Clan... who isn't just the most powerful warrior in the entire group, but may in fact be immortal. Akashi's a pretty impressive fighter in his own right and can keep up with his mistress if he has to, but even doesn't imagine himself to be in Gozen's league - to the point that he actually lampshades the notion of her needing a bodyguard.
    
    As if the sun needs protecting!
    
-   In one level of the **Shadows of the Empire** video game, Dash Rendar is trying to guard Luke Skywalker from a team of thugs on Swoop Bikes. Dash Rendar is a character around the strength of Han Solo, so he's probably much weaker than a post **The Empire Strikes Back** Luke. However, this is subverted by the fact that even a single thug getting past Dash Rendar results in a Non-Standard Game Over where Luke is killed.
-   **StarCraft II**: Zeratul has several stalkers as his bodyguards during the **Wings of Liberty** mission "Whispers of Doom", despite the fact that stalkers are versatile but fairly weak, and Zeratul's fighting skill can only be outmatched by the Queen of Blades.
-   **Star Wars: The Old Republic**: Incidental dialogue options point to this being how Consular companion Felix Iresso sees himself. The Consular is an astonishingly powerful Jedi and Felix is a mostly normal Republic soldier. In-gameplay, Felix's abilities draw a **lot** of aggro (useful for Healing Sages who just need to sit back and keep Felix healed while he shoots whatever's coming at them), and his statements also imply that the Consular is inclined to work themselves to the point of collapse without **someone** reminding them to drink enough water or get needed rest.
    -   In Lore this applies with many companions, being that it is mentioned that they are much weaker than the playable character, averted in the gameplay in which many cases are in fact even stronger than the playable character.
-   Justified in **Team Fortress 2** with the Heavy, as he has over 300 health and moves like a turtle, while one shot from a rocket launcher deals about 70 damage on average. Despite all of this, he's very vulnerable to the Sniper, who relies on headshotting opponents, or the Spy, a class relying on deception to get behind enemies and Back Stab them. These classes rely on powerful One-Hit KO abilities that can deal more than 1200 damage in some instances and are more effective against slow opponents. The Heavy's Mighty Glacier tendencies mean that without his allies watching his flanks and taking out enemy Snipers, he can and will fall prey to the Sniper and Spy. It's also justified with the Medic; while he **is** quite good in a fight and can take down enemies himself, he's probably not going to survive being dogpiled by the entire enemy team without help.
-   In the **Total War** games named generals with their retinue of "general's bodyguard" are a top-quality heavy cavalry on the battlefield. The General has the benefit of some of their special traits, possibly making them individually stronger than any one of their bodyguards, but goes with the 'everyone can use backup' justification, as one badass on a horse won't do much to a line of hundreds of enemy infantry. Forty might make a dent.
    -   In **Total War: Shogun 2**, Your generals are all elite warriors in their own right, but they still have bodyguards to protect them on the battlefield, as well as on the home front against assassination attempts. When a ninja attempts to assassinate a general, sometimes the cutscene will show the general personally thwarting the assassin's plans after he makes it past the guards.
-   **Vega Strike** tend to give Escort Missions for superiority fighters. Meaning that, unless your ship is at least equal, the "escorted" gunship lagging behind, if assaulted by a group of typical foes like Space Pirates or Evil Luddites, may wipe out half of them before you can turn back and approach close enough to hit one. Some of these also carry an anti-capship torpedo and may use it, in which case it's wise not to get in close quarters with potential targets until one of them pulverized. Larger pirate groups are more of a challenge, but still weak on the defence. With better equipment than an average escortee, any pirates are complete fodder, but Aera remain so deadly it's not easy to save your own tail — an escortee have a little chance to get away if targeted, and won't use it until he loses it. In both cases the challenge comes from such fighters **also** leaning toward Glass Cannon sort — they survive by shredding the opponent very quickly and zipping by, and are worse off in crossfire of a strong group.
-   In **Warcraft** this trope is downplayed with Admiral Proudmoore's elite Guards. They are weaker than the type they protect, but they are strong enough to repel a wave of enemies, and they help the Admiral not get overwhelmed by numbers too quickly.
-   In gameplay, the guards of race leaders in **World of Warcraft** are much, much weaker than the actual leaders themselves. Downplayed in lore, they are still weaker than the racial leaders but they manage to be useful and the leaders would probably be killed if the bodyguards were not present to help them.
    -   The **player** gets one in **Warlords of Draenor**. While most bodyguards are fairly badass and often take up roles that the player doesn't in the holy trinity, they're still the Bodyguard of a One-Man Army that got his/her rank by making mincemeat out of everything they're pointed at.
-   **Xenoblade Chronicles 1**:
    -   When the character Melia is introduced she has a contingent of Mook bodyguards to help her track down a monster she's hunting. They all die in the fight but she manages to drive it off and injure it with one big ether attack.
    -   Likewise, much of Reyn's character development deals with him trying to keep his promise to protect Shulk, even as Shulk grows far more powerful than him.
-   In **Yggdra Union**, the two dragon knights in Gulcasa's unit serve this role. Despite the fact that he's definitely much more powerful than they are, it turns out that he **does** actually need them around. As Gulcasa is notoriously bad at minding his physical limits, in the case that he actually winds up collapsing from sickness or exhaustion, the bodyguards can hold off enemies while other allies get him to safety. This actually happens at the end of Chapter 5.

Bodyguarding a Badass Example in Web Animation

-   In episode two of **Helluva Boss** the demon prince Stolas hires I.M.P. to act as bodyguards for him and his daughter Octavia while they visit a theme park. While Stolas does almost get kidnapped several times his attitude suggests he's playing along so he has an excuse for Blitzo (whom he has a massive crush on) to "rescue" him. While Blitzo and the other imps are distracted fighting a robot clown an assassin tries to get the drop on Stolas and Octavia, only to get instantly Taken for Granite.

Bodyguarding a Badass Example in Webcomics

-   **Close to Your Heart**: Subverted. As the legend illustrates, the 4 knights protect the artifact's main guardian, who appears mightier than all of them combined. In reality, she's meeker than any of them.
-   **Communication**: When they learn that Louise is going to Albion to stop the Civil War from going any further, Kirche and Tabitha go with her in order to prevent anything from happening to her. However, at that point, Louise is already a wielder of void magic, the lost element of their world, and has the ability to summon a Badass Army at will anytime she wants.
-   In **Girl Genius**, Violetta is Smoke Knight (bodyguard/personal assassin/general aide) to Tarvek, who did technically receive the same training as her. He turns out to be a Hidden Badass who was keeping the actual extent of his skills concealed from the rest of his family since it benefitted him for everyone to think of him as utterly incompetent.
    
    **Violetta:** All through our training, that useless lump just sat around doodling girls and clockwork! But he was paying attention **after all!**
    
    -   Violetta has since been reassigned to look after Agatha. While her hand-to-hand skills aren't the best, Agatha's still a Mad Scientist with a Death Ray, so she certainly still counts.
-   Tsar Rasputin from **Rasputin Barxotka** and **Rasputin Catamite** is the Hidden Badass bodyguard of smuggler Camello Basma (a.k.a. Kameron Kori), who probably hired him for more prurient reasons than just security.

Bodyguarding a Badass Example in Web Original

-   One headline from The Onion in 2008 claimed "McCain Vows to Replace Secret Service With His Own Fists." Given that McCain is a combat veteran who survived five plane crashes and two years of torture, the gag has some basis.

Bodyguarding a Badass Example in Web Video

-   **Critical Role**: Orym (a low level fighter in the start) from the third campaign used to be a bodyguard for Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest, leader of the Air Ashari. Being a twenty-level druid, one does question the need of such bodyguards.
-   **Redacted Smp**: Debunky was originally hired as Povertybag’s bodyguard and business partner despite Povertybag being much stronger and privately considering Debunky “terrible”. With Povertybag becoming mayor and giving Debunky training this has become slightly less glaring.

Bodyguarding a Badass Example in Western Animation

-   **The Batman**'s version of the Penguin was turned into an Acrofatic martial artist, yet is accompanied by the Kabuki Twins, a pair of geisha-like beings who fight with Wolverine Claws.
-   **Generator Rex**: Rex Salazar is an EVO that has the natural ability to shut off the Nanites of other EVOs, curing the victims and is often accompanied by a contingent or fireteam of Providence Soldiers when operating in the field that are armed with state-of-the-art rifles and military-grade weapons and often get mowed down by the monsters as a result. An episode dedicated to the training of Providence recruits shows what would happen if Rex is overwhelmed by the number of EVOs he has to fight against without catching his breath.
    
    **"We do our job, so he can do his."**
    
-   **Hazbin Hotel**: has Vaggie and Charlie. Charlie is the Princess of Hell, and daughter to Lucifer Morningstar, and is, as per Word of God, the third most powerful being in Hell, with only her parents being stronger than her. Vaggie is Charlie's Violently Protective Girlfriend, and frequently steps in to protect Charlie from anything she percieves as a threat. However, realistically, anything that could actually pose a threat to Charlie would be well above Vaggie's weight class.
-   The Royal Guards in **My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic** are just normal ponies guarding two Physical Gods, meaning anything that can hurt the two can easily wipe out the whole group. This is just what happens in "A Canterlot Wedding part 2" when the Changelings invade. Thus the fanon justifications:
    -   The Palace of Canterlot is also the primary administrative centre of the Equestrian government, so there's a lot of ministers, civil servants, and archived documents that also need to be guarded.
    -   The guards are there so the Princesses don't have to risk hurting innocent bystanders defending themselves.
    -   They're just there to deal with everyday criminals since the Princesses can't be everywhere at once.
    -   Those theories stated, Luna and Celestia being invincible and invulnerable is **also** fanon. While the show never bothers with consistent power levels, the Royal Sisters have both lost multiple times, with no mountain destroying force needed, so simply having people around to help them in a fight or just plain protect them is quite likely. From Celestia's onscreen fight record<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>, she actually needs **better** bodyguards. Both of them have also appeared onscreen clearly scratched up.
-   **ReBoot**: Super Virus Daemon is usually shown surrounded by her honor guard. They don't do anything besides glaring menacingly and acting as her personal choir, but since she's Nigh-Invulnerable and can block a giant robot's fist with one finger, they're probably just for show anyway.
-   **Steven Universe**: Pearl is said to have acted as Rose's bodyguard/living shield, despite the fact that Pearl is a Glass Cannon and Rose was an eight-feet tall Stone Wall with advanced defensive powers. This likely had more to do with Pearl's personal insecurities and idealization of the Lady and Knight dynamic than with Rose's actual wishes, though that part is admittedly ambiguous. Taken up to eleven when Pearl reveals she's actually Pink Diamond's personal Pearl, and Rose Quartz was actually Pink Diamond! She was bodyguarding one of the four most powerful Gems in the universe. Also justified, since Rose being poofed would have exposed her original identity.

-   In **Transformers**, Optimus Prime (i.e. one of the most powerful of a race of giant, sapient Humongous Mecha) sometimes has a human military escort. While rarely stated, this is usually more to make the humans feel at ease.

Bodyguarding a Badass Example in Real Life

-   It is not uncommon for boxers, actors specializing in martial arts, MMA fighters, etc. to have bodyguards. In the case of actors, this might be because they really aren't all that good at fighting, for all their flashy moves on camera. Some fighting styles are also fairly one-dimensional, such as boxing, and don't function as the best form of self-defense. Many of these celebrities are physically small, so huge muscular types would actually present more of a threat/deterrent, and skills that could ward off an unarmed attacker or even one with a knife won't stop a bullet. Of course, the major reason is probably that they have the money to spend, so they'd prefer other people fight off the crazies instead of putting themselves on the line. Also as they say "Guys like fights because guys like lawsuits." Many famous/wealthy people and even trained fighters will keep bodyguards around because someone might try to provoke said celebrity or fighter into a fight so they can sue them for a large settlement. Having a couple people around trained to incapacitate without permanent harm (plus act as witnesses) prevent these situations from happening.
    -   Bodyguards may also be provided by an athlete or fighter's management or an actor's studio, again for the money. If someone gets injured before a big match or while they are filming a blockbuster, everything gets delayed while they recover. Paying for bodyguards' salary and medical coverage can be a bargain in comparison.
-   Jason Momoa has a couple of bodyguards who attend him when he's out and about. He stands a full head taller than either of them and is probably twice their size. A frequent caption is, "When you think you are useless, take a look at Jason Momoa's bodyguards." Another common caption reads, "Someday I want to get so jacked that my bodyguards look like mini-bosses you have to fight before you can fight me."
-   Military leaders, even today where Generals can safely conduct wars in a secured bunker, tend to have guards. Even historic badasses like Guan Yu of China, Alexander of Macedonia, Napoleon of France, etc. tend to be surrounded by guards. This is because, in the past, leaders would be on the battlefield directing the fight or even leading the charge, and death of an army's general could lead to the whole force disintegrating. Today, with the chain of command, it's not such a big problem, but having to bring a new guy up to speed might be a costly inconvenience. In short, the bodyguards protect the General so that he can focus on his job of running the war. General MacArthur even frustrated his bodyguards (and subaltern officer aides) by exposing himself with imperturbable face to enemy fire in many incidents during World War I and World War II.
-   Tanks need infantry support when not performing fast deep maneuvers without stopping to engage anything. So the main strength are tanks, but when they can be mired in a fight they are guarded or it ends up with lots of burned-out metal boxes. This arrangement started back with chariots and war elephants: they are either charging or need protection from being mobbed from all sides. In India footmen protecting chariots were called Chakra Rakshaka ("Guardians of the wheels").
-   The US Secret Service has often served as bodyguards to Presidents who are complete badasses. The examples that immediately spring to mind are probably Andrew Jackson (though he predates the actual "Secret Service", and famously had to be **dragged away** from caning his would-be assassin to death) and Theodore Roosevelt (war hero, police commissioner, deputy sheriff, boxer, judo brown belt, explorer, and utterly glorious lunatic).
-   Since Conservation of Ninjutsu doesn't apply in real life, any single person, no matter how badass, is vulnerable to getting Zerg Rushed — overwhelmed by sheer weight of numbers even if individually the attackers are no match for them — because after all, you can only hit or shoot one person at a time. Safety in numbers applies.
