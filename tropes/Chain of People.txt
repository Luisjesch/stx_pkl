Chain of People: 
Haaaaaaands...across Americaaaaa...

Take My Hand! meets The Power of Friendship.

Essentially, one person falls off a cliff to their certain death. However, just before they slip out of reach, another character catches them. Then, as they start slipping, another person catches that person, then another holds onto them, and then... well, you get the idea.

A variation to this exists. People will form a chain or a human wall as a sign of either uniting against a common enemy and it’s to show you’ll have to pass through them or as one of mourning, the grief brings them together in brotherhood. Sometimes, a human chain may be formed when people are navigating areas with low visibility.

Human Ladder is a similar trope. Not to be confused with a Chain of Deals.

Chain of People Example in Anime & Manga

-   In **Seijuu Kourin Hen** after a bunch of characters are sucked into hell and the rest jump in after them to save them, they try to form an angelic chain. Slight variant in that a few are holding hands but most are holding onto the whip of the bottom-most guy while the winged character tries to fly back to the surface hauling 8 people this way. Rule of Cool, I think.
-   A variant is present in the finale of **Kill la Kill**. As Ryuko falls from space following the Final Battle with Ragyo, she is first caught by Satsuki, who is sent flying by the momentum before being backed up by Mako, the Elite Four, the rest of the Mankanshoku family, and then damn near every student of Honnōji Academy before they all finally come sliding to a stop.
-   **Naruto**. The title character will occasionally do this all by himself.
-   Seen in **Planetes** — Hachimachi sees Ai's hand reach out to him when he falls, but he sees her connected to a vast chain of almost every character in the series as well.

-   **Hanaukyō Maid Team La Verite** episode 7. Taro, Ryuuka and Ikyo Suzuki form a chain of people after they fall over the edge of a cliff while exploring an underground dungeon below the mansion.
-   A standard technique of the Ham-Hams in **Hamtaro**.
-   **Code Geass** has Lelouche jumping after Shirley when she falls from a roof and Suzaku grabbing onto Lelouches leg to catch them both. It is both a good example of, despite being enemies, Lelouche and Suzaku are still old friends totally insync with one another and a shining example of the characters' unfortunate noodliness<small>◊</small>.
-   An impressive chain between the five warriors and Manta forms at the end of **Shaman King**, to keep them from falling into Hao's black hole.

-   A variant happens around the climax of **Hellstar Remina** wherein the survivors all form a human chain while they enter the shelter, in order to keep from getting separated from one another.

Iron Man catches one of them, and instructs her to grab the hand of another, and so forth, forming a chain in midair.

    Even as the insane drag of the spell tries to pull me into the air into its ever hungering maw, I feel more stable than ever. What's happened?! I take a risk and shift myself a little and to my shock and horror I see a forest of ants behind me, each of them gripping onto each other and the ground as those closest have gripped onto me. They've formed living chains that emerge from tunnels in the ground dozens of metres away to bind me back down to the ground.

Impressively, not only do **none** of them know the child, most don't even seem to know each other. This keeps the kid alive long enough for the CFD to arrive, but also means multiple members of the chain need to be helped back up the hill by the fire fighters. Once everyone is safe, the main characters make a point to shake each person's hand.
-   **Kid Nation**, while never seen on the show, one of the kids on the show stated in an interview that chains of people blocked off the area where the show took place so no kid would get lost or that no one would come in.

    -   In **Shovel of Hope** The Order of No Quarter end up like this once you beat them all in a Boss Rush. You can help them back up onto solid ground, if you want to. Humourously, they all end up hanging in the order they choose to fight you in — leading to such hilarious scenarios as the scrawny Tinker Knight holding everyone up. This scene is repeated at the end of **Plague of Shadows**\- but Shovel Knight leaves the Order to hang while Plague Knight jumps off the end of the chain to escape.

Chain of People Example in Western Animation

-   **Justice League** had one when Flash is nearly sucked into an alternate dimension after running so fast he taps into the Speed Force. First Hawkgirl, then Green Lantern, then everyone else joins hands as they try to pull Wally out.

-   **Pooh's Grand Adventure**. When Tigger gets stuck on a log wedged in a crevasse trying to retrieve the map, Pooh leans down to offer him a hand.

They do end up falling off the cliff, but nobody's hurt.
-   A variation in **VeggieTales: The Toy that Saved Christmas**, as Wally P. Nezzer goes flying into the air over a cliff, then Buzzsaw Louie and a gaggle of penguins go flying after him. Louie and the penguins form a chain in midair, and then one end of the chain gets snagged by a penguin standing on the edge of a broken bridge, and the other end catches Mr. Nezzer, the penguin at the end of chain just barely managing to hold on the bridge by his toes while keeping the rest of the chain from falling, leaving them stuck hanging over the cliff.

When the bait is taken, Spike gets pulled into the hole — Applejack grabs his tail and gets pulled in, Twilight Sparkle follows, then Rainbow Dash, then Fluttershy, and finally Pinkie Pie, who didn't even try to pull and thinks it is fun. All of them hang on to each other as they are dragged down the tunnel.
        
        **Pinkie Pie:** Wheeeeeeeee!
        
    -   The Mane Six end up in another one in "Power Ponies". This time, Pinkie doesn't even bother to grab hold and just jumps after them once they have all been pulled in.

Pretty and Eugly also get flung off and Eugly grabs Quack Quack's foot and Pretty grabs Eugly, creating a chain of people.

Chain of People Example in Real Life

-   A mountain climbing team does this routinely— naturally, since one person will have a hard time catching a falling person of roughly his own weight.
-   The Baltic Way, a peaceful political protest consisting of **two million people** forming a chain of **over 600 kilometers** across the Baltic states, to protest against the Russian occupation.
-   Lifeguard and rescue training include instruction on forming these to save a drowning victim. If it is too dangerous to venture into the water alone to rescue someone in trouble, this is often the best way to retrieve the victim. Rescuers link at the elbow and the strongest members wade out into the water until the chain reaches the victim. Once they have hold of them, the portion of the chain on the beach hauls them all back in.
-   In 1985 a national campaign against unemployment in Britain attempted a "Hands Across Britain", a human chain the length of Britain in an attempt to get the government to "do something" about unemployment. It didn't work, the (Thatcher) government just ignored it anyway.
-   In July of 2017, Roberta Ursey and six of her family members were pulled out to sea by a powerful rip current just off Panama City Beach while trying to rescue her two sons, who had become trapped in the current minutes previously. Dozens of beach goers formed a human chain reaching over 100 yards (91 meters) into the surf in order to rescue the stricken family, some standing in water up to their neck. Aided by the efforts of strong swimmers who paddled out on boogie boards and towed the family back towards the human chain, the nine members of the Ursey family were rescued (though one elderly member of the family had to be taken to the hospital after suffering a heart attack during the ordeal).
