Awful British Sex Comedy: 
_"Why is it that the heart sinks, the knees sag and stark horror grips the soul at those three words: British Sex Comedy?"_

— **Tim Healey**, _The World's Worst Movies_

During The '70s, when sex and nudity in mainstream films were at their height and the boundary between soft-core porn and mainstream was blurred, the UK film industry's main product, aside from big-screen Brit Com adaptations, consisted of low-budget comedies with sexual themes featuring a great deal of nudity and slapstick. Modern viewers almost universally agree that these were flat-out _awful_ films, but some enjoy them anyway.

Most famous was the "Confessions of a..." Series, four films entitled _Confessions... of a Window Cleaner, of a Driving Instructor, of a Pop Performer_ and _from a Holiday Camp_, all of which followed the misadventures of Robin Askwith's "lovable" loser Timmy Lea (to quote the theme tune from the first episode "You're really not a loser, you just find it hard to win") as he bungles his way through a series of jobs set up for him by his brother-in-law, Sid Noggett, who happened to be played by Anthony Booth, later the future father-in-law of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. At every turn, Sid and Timmy attempt to have sex with every young woman they meet, often successfully. Subplots include Sid's stormy marriage and Timmy's Dad's habit of stealing things from the lost property office where he works.

Other similar films were made at about the same time, including the derivative "Adventures" series, one episode of which, _Adventures of a Taxi Driver_ is said to have out-performed Martin Scorsese's _Taxi Driver_ at the British box office; if true, this says a horrible thing about British culture in the '70s <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Established comedy series, such as _Carry On_, also converged with this type of film during The '70s.

All the films of this type were cheap, cheerful and cheesy. They also showed considerably more flesh and considerably less morality than modern sex comedies. For example, remember how, at the end of _American Pie 2_, our hero turns down the beautiful foreign student who has already got her tits out and runs off after the band geek whom he has just realized he really loves? Timmy Lea would have shagged the foreign girl, then said, "Ta very much, love. Cheerio!" and _then_ ran off after the band geek. And the shag would have been on camera.

A notable TV example of this genre is _The Benny Hill Show_, a long-running Britcom that ran for 20 series<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  from 1969 to 1989, which is notable for two things: Benny Hill's slapstick antics, which would usually result in a woman hitting him even when contact was accidental, and getting Chased Off into the Sunset with such a closing sequence involving "Yakety Sax", the wacky, fast-paced closing theme played by Boots Randolph on the saxophone.

Awful British Sex Comedy Example in 

## Laden with tropes, including:

-   Based on a Great Big Lie: The **Confessions** films were based on a long series of **True Confessions of Timothy Lea** books available from cheap paperback racks, all supposedly written by Lea himself as true accounts of his adventures (actually by Christopher Wood, who also wrote the screenplays). Wood was also responsible for the equally fictional **True Confessons of Rosie Dixon** books, the first of which was adapted into the film **Rosie Dixon — Night Nurse**.
-   Camp Gay: As comedy relief only.
-   Double Entendre: Rarely subtle.
-   Fanservice: Pretty much the whole point.
-   Food Fight: If drinks, soup, pies, cream buns etc can be used to make someone messy, they will be. This comes from "sploshing", the British take on "wet and messy" fetishism, with the idea being that British food is much more appealing if it's being worn.
-   Hurricane of Puns: Goes without saying in a British comedy of any type.
-   Lovable Coward: If the hero is in bed with a woman and her husband comes home, cue terrified dash with underpants at half mast.
-   Porn with Plot: Well, enough plot that they could be presented as something other than porn, and shown in mainstream cinemas. And very softcore porn by modern standards. But frankly, the sex and the Fanservice seem to have been the point of the exercise for most people, both making and watching these things.
-   Slapstick: As the easiest form of comedy.
-   This Loser Is You: Implied, or why would you be identifying with this schmuck bumbling around with other men's wives?
-   Values Dissonance: And not just in sexual matters either. For example, in **Confessions from a Holiday Camp**, Timmy is working at a camp where the campers are all assigned teams named after the suits in a pack of cards. Timmy approaches a black woman with, "Hello, you're a spade, aren't you?". And the jokes **get worse** from there.
-   Wardrobe Malfunction: Inevitably and endlessly.
