Bell-Bottom-Limbed Bots: 
This is where mecha, robots, or anything similar have lower legs and forearms bigger than the corresponding thighs and upper arms, as if they had giant bracers and boots on, or bell-bottom pants from The '70s.

There's a few various reasons for this trope. One of the most common is the prevalence of robots with Rocket Boots or various arm mounted weaponry on their forearms. Another reason is the prevalence of Shoulders of Doom or hip-plates on many robots, whose great size leaves less room for the upper arms and thighs respectively, while the forearms and lower legs are free to look bulkier. This can be accentuated further by a Mecha Expansion Pack, where the extremities are free to be armored up while the more heavily-jointed shoulders and hips need to be unobstructed.

And from an artistic standpoint, it can either come across as a convenient or a lazy design choice if drawing hands and feet comes of as time-consuming without covering them. Alternatively, it can also convey stability; indeed, some Mecha drawing guides recommend making the bottom bigger than the top for precisely this reason. If there are toys based on the robot (or, alternatively, if the robot is based on a toy), then that artistic stability can double as actual real-world stability.

Contrast Top-Heavy Guy whose overall body is disproportionate and Creepily Long Arms for arms that are unusually long, compare Chicken Walker for another popular form of Robotic Legs. See also Fingerless Hands, which is the organic version of this.

Bell-Bottom-Limbed Bots Example in Anime & Manga

-   In **Astro Boy**, many of the male robots have thick legs and forearms. Astro himself is an example if you count his boots. Epsilon who is a female robot also has them and still looks feminine in them since hers resemble arm warmers/leg warmers.
-   The classic **Gundam** is a good example. Its lower legs are notably larger and more complex than the upper legs, it's less noticeable but still there with the arms. Some of the robots were designed to be more bottom-heavy, i.e., to shift their gravity center lower; most notably, the Dom has massive lower legs and feet with the justification that it has jets built into them that allow it to hover at high speeds over the surface of the Earth.
-   In **Mazinger Z**, the titular mecha has these gauntlet/greaves thing going on its arms and legs. So do its successors, **Great Mazinger** and **UFO Robo Grendizer**.
-   In **One Piece**, Franky the cyborg has big, inflated forearms which become even bigger and boxy after the Time Skip. Justified in that he puts many things in there, such as ammunition, a long chain, a shield, and a box of tools.
-   The Ingrams in **Patlabor** are a strong example, having extremely large lower legs, the right one containing a compartment for storing a scaled-up revolver, and short, minimalistic thighs. This is explicitly in the interest of keeping their centre of gravity low so they don't tip over, which is **the** primary design concern with a humanoid mech that is two stories tall and meant to operate in an urban environment.
-   All three **Robot Romance Trilogy** animes have these. **Voltes V**, **Daimos**, **Combattler V** all have forearms and legs that are armored with armlets and greaves.

Bell-Bottom-Limbed Bots Example in Toys

-   **Transformers**: The majority are examples, often with Kibble attached to their lower arms, while upper arm Kibble usually turns into Shoulders of Doom detached from the arm. In toys with this, it's Enforced since it's literally impossible to have the upper arm bigger, if the shoulder pad and upper arm are supposed to be flush with the lower arm when transformed. Similarly, many toys have larger lower legs than upper legs due to it being common for the toy's lower legs to fold over their upper legs in vehicle mode. The lower legs are usually incorporated into the toy's vehicle mode appearance, while the upper legs wind up being internal.

Bell-Bottom-Limbed Bots Example in Video Games

-   Lasertrons in **Fallout 4** have these for their legs, making them look as if they wore platform shoes, especially when the voices and the personas of the robots the player is able to meet in the Commonwealth are feminine.
-   **Mega Man (Classic)**: Mega Man is more notable in artwork than in games but it's there in both. In some cases, his lower legs and forearms might be **twice** as thick as the arms attached, which usually look like blue tights.
-   **Mighty No. 9**, the Spiritual Successor of **Mega Man**, naturally has these for its robot designs. Beck, Mighty No. 1, and Mighty No. 5 have large forelegs. Mighty No. 4 has large forearms.
-   Many of the robotic characters from **Sonic the Hedgehog** heavily feature this design. Notable examples include almost the entire E-Series robots, especially E-102 Gamma and E-123 Omega, Emerl, Gemerl and the Gizoids, Metal Sonic (most prominently in his transformed state in **Sonic Heroes**), and Johnny from **Sonic Rush Adventure**.

Bell-Bottom-Limbed Bots Example in Webcomics

-   **Schlock Mercenary**: Lieutenant Foxworthy temporarily becomes a bell-bottomed Cyborg after an explosion severs her legs. The field hospital has a roboticist with spare Powered Armor parts but no body-part printer, so she spends some time with feet larger than her torso.
    
    **Foxworthy:** I'm **tall.**

Bell-Bottom-Limbed Bots Example in Western Animation

-   **Green Lantern: The Animated Series**:
    -   In the episode "Steam Lantern", Duke Nigel's mechanoids are designed with this style in mind.
    -   Other more Downplayed examples include the Anti-monitor and Aya, whose limbs are only slightly larger at the ends.
    -   The Manhunters avert this, having more normal proportions.
-   **Megas XLR**: Megas, the Glorft mechs, and pretty much all of the humanoid mechs fall under this trope.
-   **My Life as a Teenage Robot** shows Jenny with uniform hose-style arms, but she has bell bottom legs with no feet.
-   **Samurai Jack**: The Mondo Bot's hands and feet are proportionally very large but has comparatively skinny upper arms and thighs, this actually proves to be a massive design flaw as after Jack has merged with a magic stone giant he easily snaps his arms and legs with a single chop.
-   The high-tech gem Peridot from **Steven Universe** has arms and legs that flare out from the knees and elbows like bell-bottoms and flared sleeves. When she joins up with the Crystal Gems in season two, it's revealed that these parts of her limbs are actually removable robotic extensions and not actually part of her real body, which is much smaller and has normal humanoid hands and fingers.
-   **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)** has Professor Honeycutt, a.k.a. The Fugitoid, who falls cleanly under this.
