Clones Are People, Too: 
One's a model soldier, one's a total nut, and one's a Knight in Sour Armor. All three are badasses, all three are clones of the same villain, and all three are heroes. And they are all voiced by the same guy.

**Plo Koon:** Sergeant, why are you so certain no one is coming?  
**Sergeant Sinker:** We're just clones, sir. We're meant to be expendable.  
**Plo Koon:** _Not_ to me.

Clones have often gotten the short end of the stick in Science Fiction. When they're not soulless abominations or evil dopplegangers, they tend to be seen as just back-up copies of the original and nothing more.

Except when _this_ trope kicks in. After all, Nature creates genetic copies of people all the time. They're called identical twins; and as people in Real Life can easily tell you, they are very much individuals.<sup>*&nbsp;</sup> 

This trope is when a clone is permitted to be their own person and live their own life, essentially becoming a character independent from the original. They may grapple with Clone Angst now and then, or they may recognize that their personality is sufficiently unique for them to think of themselves as — well, themselves. This is more difficult if they started life with the copied memories of the original. Often, they become a recurring or supporting character. If the original is dead, it's likely the clone takes over the original's role.

Expect any Zombie Advocate to take this viewpoint, but expressing this view does not automatically make a person a Zombie Advocate. See also Androids Are People, Too. What Measure Is a Non-Human? is when this trope is called into question or outright rejected and Death Means Humanity can lead to someone who views clones as lesser lifeforms to change their views to this trope. Sub-Trope of Our Clones Are Different; this trope tends to occur when clones are already a common part of society, yet are still treated differently.

Truth in Television, as while the same genetic set can define how an individual starts, external influences and individual experiences can shape even creatures with identical genetics into very different beings.

Contrast Expendable Clone. Please add all aversions/inversions there.

Clones Are People, Too Example in Anime & Manga

-   In **Afterschool Charisma**, clones may be treated as backup copies, but Shiro (and Mr. Kuroe) sees them as this.
-   At the end of **A.I.C.O. Incarnation**, the original Aiko returns to having a normal life at school and home with her mother and brother, whereas the artificial Aiko transfers into a brand new school to start a new life and create her own memories.
-   The Bioroids in **Appleseed** are genetically enhanced clones, and the fact that they have the same rights as any other people is a major plot point. Furthermore, thanks to their emotional restrictions they play a vital part in ensuring the world peace after two destructive world wars.
-   In **Astra Lost in Space**, the crew of the Astra never doubt themselves as being human after learning they are clones beyond the initial shock. The world government they live in feels the same, helping them revise their birth certificate after the truth is revealed and provind them support until they turn 18. The only ones who treat them as non-human are their parents, who are protrayed as villanious the whole time.
-   **A Certain Magical Index**:
    -   A major plot point involves Touma convincing Mikoto's clones that they aren't disposable pawns but rather people in their own right because before they were perfectly content with dying for the sake of an experiment. While initially they were all nearly exactly the same, after the experiment ended the network that links them allowed them to start differentiating slightly, though despite what the main characters think they still don't consider themselves entirely distinct from each other. In fact, it's impossible to separate them like that.
        
        **Misaka 10032:** Misaka cannot comprehend your actions... if the right materials and drugs are available, Misaka can be automatically created with the push of a button...an artificial body...an artificial mind...each unit is 180,000 yen, with as many as 9,968 left in storage. Yet, for something like that...  
        **Touma:** That doesn't matter. That your body's artificial...that your mind's artificial...that you can be made with the push of a button...small things like that aren't even interesting. There's only one **you** in this world, and I'm here to help you. So don't go dying by yourself.
        
    -   In **New Testament**, the Cyborg Rensa explains that this was the very reason she was created as a countermeasure for a potential rebellion of the Level 5s instead of using more clones, stating that the failure of the Radio Noise Project (the above-mentioned incident with Misaka's clones) was in part **because** the clones were able to develop free will and individuality to deviate from their created goal of being slaves to the project. A Cyborg like her, on the other hand, has no need or desire for such a thing.
    -   Deconstructed in Mitori Kouzaku's Start of Darkness in **A Certain Scientific Railgun**. When she confronted the researchers upon learning about Dolly and the Radio Noise Project, shouting about how clones are no different from people, the researcher **agrees** with her, but points out that to most researchers and the Board of Directors of Academy City, clones and espers are at the end of the day just research fodder. This is why in the present she doesn't really mind the idea of killing just about everyone in Academy City to wipe those in power off the map.
    -   Driven home in **Genesis Testament**, in which the existence of the Sisters becomes public knowledge. Anticipating problems, Academy City's higher-ups collaborate with global media outlets to try to drive home the idea that the clones are still people, and victims of a cruel experiment. The Pope even makes an official decree that the clones are ensouled human beings, with all the rights that entails.
-   Zig-Zagged in **Gantz**. When a transporter accident creates a duplicate Kishimoto, she is treated as just as human as the original. Ditto much later when a duplicate Kurono is created.
    -   Fridge Horror: "Teleportation" is actually accomplished by creating an exact duplicate of you and then **disassembling you molecule by molecule**. Deconstructed, analyzed, and shoddily reconstructed (unintentionally) by The Sponsors (The aliens that supplied Gantz technology): They treat humans and giants as a video game player would to an NPC: as THINGS. To summarize, they don't see the people fighting for their lives as human, and are as willing to resurrect the dead and brutally kill them as they are willing to strike up meaningful philosophical discussions in an attempt to teach them how to stop being stupid. Seeing how everyone was teleported into the room that they hold a discussion in, it's possible they see EVERYONE IN THE ROOM as NPCs. However, they're also dense to the point that they obliviously explain the physics and semantics of modern-theory afterlife and reincarnation as an actual means to closure (mostly because they don't really know WHY twenty-one grams of matter in the human brain teleports to an alternate dimension when people die, nor why the re-distribution of said mass forms a very obvious but illogically unnatural pattern).
-   **Gundam**:
    -   **Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny**:
        -   Kira Yamato goes out of his way to convince Rey Za Burrel, the clone of the previous Big Bad, that he does not have to repeat his "brother's" mistakes. It eventually gets through to him.
        -   Said Big Bad was also a clone who was treated as nothing more than an extension of his donor. It didn't end well for anyone involved.
        -   Also, this trope is specifically why the Big Bad's plan — which hinged on every person's being, belief, and therefore role in life would be determined their genes — falls apart with its logic. Rey, in terms of character and belief, is NOTHING like said previous Big Bad. And then there's the other side-story-exclusive clone, who is pretty much non-villainous, and their deceased genetic donor, who was easily the biggest douchebag in all the land.
    -   **Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ**:
        -   Glemmy Toto may have Gihren Zabi's DNA, and is almost as manipulative and evil as his donor, but the similarities end there. While Gihren was a humourless, ugly cold-blooded Adolf Hitler stand-in, Glemmy is a smooth talking pretty boy charmer, with a quirky sense of humour and a Stepford Smile.
        -   Elpeo Ple also has approximately 11 or so clones, meant to serve as brainwashed Newtype super soldiers for Glemmy. Most of them only appear long enough to die in the final battle, but Ple-2 and Ple-12 are both fleshed out as characters and are quite different from their original. In fact, you can often tell who is a good guy or a bad guy based on how they treat them: the evil characters (or at least on the darker side of grey) tend to see them as expendable living equipment, and heroic characters tend to treat them as actual people.
    -   **Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch from Mercury**:
        -   Elan Ceres is a case where he's not technically a clone, but he is treated functionally like one: he's a regular person who had a normal life, implied to be a rather impoverished one, but has been memory-wiped and surgically altered into a Body Double for the "real" Elan. Though the company that created him treats him as an Expendable Clone used to pilot highly dangerous machinery (he's actually their fourth go at it), the other characters do not, even those in the know about him, and his "decommissioning" is one of the darkest moments of the show's first season. This is emphasized further when we meet Elan #5, who has nothing in common with him personality-wise, making it clear that the Elan we met is gone for good.
        -   Suletta Mercury, the show's protagonist, is described as a "repli-child", an Artificial Human created based on the genes of Ericht Samaya, the one person able to fully ignore the GUND Format's Deadly Upgrade. Ericht (or what Ericht had become, anyway) raised her as a beloved little sister, and Prospera, her creator and "mother," treats Ericht with no small amount of Parental Favoritism but nonetheless cares for Suletta in her own malformed way. When Suletta herself finds out about this, she is noticeably not all that bothered by it—other revelations at the time may have left it on the backburner for her, but her explanation of it to others is relatively matter-of-fact, only taking it as the reason for Prospera's lack of care for her. Additionally, despite their shared genes, Suletta and Ericht are really no closer personality-wise than you'd expect a pair of siblings to be.
-   **Kengan Omega** reveals that the Worm dabbles with cloning, and it is implied that Masaki Hayami and Ryuki Gaoh are clones to Masaki Meguro and Ohma Tokita, respectively. Hayami is confirmed to be Meguro's clone, while Ohma and Ryuki are both clones of the same mysterious person. Despite their identical appearances, however, all four characters have different personalities and motivations.
-   **Kino's Journey**, the light novel, has a chapter dedicated to this. Kino enters a country where the inhabitants are all clones of one male and one female, who are pretty much equal to twins, with differing personalities and traits. It gets blown up by people who believe otherwise. Nobody dies.
-   **Knights of Sidonia** has the Honokas. They are a group of clones who are all trainee pilots, but each have their own name (Honoka En, Honoka Hou, and so on) and are treated as individuals.
-   **Lyrical Nanoha**:
    -   This is generally the prevalent attitude regarding all the clone characters (which by the end of **StrikerS** is approximately half the cast). Precia Testarossa is about the only character who doesn't share this perspective, and the reason she hated Fate is because she **wasn't** the same person as the girl she was cloned from, and Precia wanted a Replacement Goldfish. The movie backpedaled on this slightly, with Precia realizing much too late that Fate was effectively the little sister Alicia had always wanted.
    -   In **Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid**, it's revealed that while Vivio very closely resembles the woman she was cloned from, there are physical as well as personality differences between them (most notably, the fact that Olivie had no arms, though Vivio's "adult mode" also shows that she's more buxom than her predecessor).
    -   The clones also have various relationships with who they're cloned from depending on the age difference and their situation. Dream!Alicia considered Fate to be a younger sister, Quint viewed Ginga and Subaru as her daughters (although she had adopted them long before finding out they were cloned from her), Erio and Zest both see themselves as continuations of their originals, and Vivio is treated as Olivie's descendant by the Saint Church. Nove also considers Quint to be her mother, but this has more to do with her being adopted by Quint's widower Genya than any genetic connection.
-   **Macross**:
    -   **Super Dimension Fortress Macross**: The Zentraedi were created as Expendable Clones by the Protoculture to fight their wars, but made sure they had a lot of genetic variance. As a result the Zentraedi have all kinds of personalities and alignments, and by the time the series starts the Protoculture is apparently extinct because they had to lift the safeties that kept the Zentraedi from rebelling to fight a massive threat, and when said threat was dealt with the Zentraedi refused to let the safeties be reapplied and wiped them out in return.
    -   In the various sequel series, a large chunk of the human population are clones created after the Zentraedi holocaust. Considering the different personalities (and that they were created the same way the Protoculture did with the Zentraedi), you wouldn't know without tie-in material. It's still impossible to know **who** is a clone and who is a survivor of the Holocaust outside returning characters from the original series and characters explicitly stated to have parents.
-   The Aesop in the original Japanese version of **Mewtwo Strikes Back** and it's remake amounts to this. The English dub changed it to "fighting is wrong" in the original film. However, they did keep Mewtwo's line about "the circumstances of one's birth". The English dub of the remake keeps the original Japanese version's moral.
-   Naruto:
    -   **Naruto**:
        -   In **Naruto Gaiden**, the villain Orochimaru of all people, explains this trope to Naruto, Sasuke and Sarada regarding Shin's clones, saying that unlike Naruto's shadow clones, each Shin clone is a human being with a mind and personality of its own. By the end of the story all of "Shin Jrs" are taken to be raised in an Orphanage of Love led by Kabuto.
    -   **Boruto**:
        -   As new clones are introduced, like Mitsuki a clone of orochimaru or Koji Kashin a clone of Jiraiya, it's always made clear that they can and do develop their own identity and goals.
        -   This is the reason why Mad Scientist Amado joined Kara to begin with. As his attempts to revive his daughter Akebi via cloning, resulted in the creation of Delta. And Delta has all the memories of Akebi, as well as her look and voice, but has her own personality, whereas Amado wished to actually bring back his daughter and Jigen convinces him that this would happen if he helped him in his own goals first.
-   **Phoenix**: **Life** deals strongly with this idea when the main character, a selfish TV executive, is cloned and sent to be slaughtered for sport with his many copies.
-   In **Space Battleship Yamato 2202**, the Gatlanteans are artificial humanoids who reproduce via cloning. But despite Zordar’s desire that the Gatlanteans be emotionless soldiers, all the Gatlanteans we meet are unique individuals who are emotive, including Zordar himself.
-   In **Strike the Blood**, the only thing Kojou is concerned about is Yuuma's well-being from the moment he learns that she's a clone of the Witch of Nortaria.
-   In **TerraforMARS**, Bao's clones invoke this when they were revealed, and each has his own personality and dreams in life.

Clones Are People, Too Example in Comic Books

-   In **Contest of Champions (2015)** Issue #9, the Maestro points out that Thunderstrike is just a clone of Thor. He murmurs that while it is true, he didn't have to say it so rudely.
-   Artificial humans in **Copperhead** are genetically programmed to seek out and win fights, but have agency to determine how they do it. Many are soldiers, some are employed as guards or enforcers. Ishmael specifically goes out of his way to avoid people and larger conflicts but will step into any unjust scenario to protect the weak.
-   Discussed in a Twelfth Doctor **Doctor Who Magazine** comic story, where Clara encounters one of her own splinters for the first time since she created them in "The Name of the Doctor". She is horrified to realise that she might have created thousands of young women who, unknowingly, existed only to sacrifice themselves for the Doctor. She is then reassured when the splinter, despite appearances at one point, survives the adventure.
-   **Gold Digger** has a few examples:
    -   Brianna as a composite clone of Gina and Britanny who was produced in a lab accident. She was quickly adopted into the family, and although she suffered a (perfectly understandable) lengthy identity crisis, she is now very much her own person.
    -   The genie Madrid, an old enemy of Gina's, once shapeshifted into Gina's form and got stuck that way. Unable to change back, she found Gina's copied personality slowly encroaching on her own. Later, after another scheme failed spectacularly, she suffered a terrible Villainous Breakdown and raped by she-dragons and her evil half effectively lost the will to live, so the duplicate Gina personality (with Madrid's memories) has been dominant ever since. After some initial misgivings, Gina has decided she can trust her, and the two have become friends.
    -   Another example, though not a clone, per se, is Raphael, the male Were-Cheetah Golem created to disrupt Brittany and Stripe's wedding. Once the situation was peacefully resolved, the priestess who created him destroyed him for failing, but Brianna snatched the piece containing his soul/memories, as she empathized with him for also being an artificially-created being. Which bring us to...
    -   ...Array, a villainess who can created doubles of herself with different skills, abilities, and even species'. She can discorporate them, but their personalities remain inside of her (thus her name), and she can re-call them at any time rather than making a new "self". When Brianna runs afoul of her while looking for a way to help Raphael, Array also sympathizes with her, and helps her create a new form and life for Raphael.
-   This trope is the whole point of **Heart Breakers** by Paul Guinan and Anina Bennett. Most of the cast are clones of Theresa Sorenson, who died midway through the series. The two main characters, Delta and Queenie, have radically different personalities. They live in a world where clones have to struggle for legal rights.
-   In Icon, the technological advancements by the Cooperative are so advanced that creating clones is a simple matter for them. In fact, it is common practice that if a member of their society meets an unnatural death, both medical and psychological records of the deceased can be used to create a perfect copy of the original. Icon meets his own clone, Arnus II, who has been living his life ever since the original Arnus crash landed on Earth in the 1800s, and its presented as being completely normal with no signs of social discrimination toward the copy.
-   In **Iron Man: Fatal Frontier**, Tony Stark's ruining of a clone's life in issue 10 is seen as completely disgusting, and a sign that phlogistone is poisoning his mind.
-   **Judge Dredd** has many clones, including the protagonist himself. Though all are genetically identical, their personalities and history vary wildly. Where Dredd himself became a celebrated Judge, his clone-brother Rico turned to criminal ways and was ultimately killed for it. Another clone, Dolman, decided to quit the Academy to join the Space Corps instead.
-   The 3rd Loki owes their existence to a misfired Cloning Gambit by the original Loki. Misfired because whatever was past Loki's true essence it got destroyed or lost in the process so the resulting **clone** body had a new soul and the personality copy originally intended to restore his memories and powers ended up killing an innocent child when it took over... And feeling very guilty about it. They spent most of **Young Avengers** and **Loki: Agent of Asgard** trying to figure out how to be their own person and if it's even possible (at this point they mucked with the original Norse myths and broke the timeline, if they fail it won't be because of lack of trying).
-   The comic book **Machine qui rêve** (**The Machine that Dreams**), sort of a Bizarro Episode to the comical Belgian comic series **Spirou & Fantasio**, is a long reflection on this. Some unethical scientists create a clone of the title character, a clone created adult, and with all the memories from the real Spirou. Clone!Spirou escapes, and doesn't know he's a clone of the real one. After being chased in the whole town by minions of the scientists, he eventually comes back to the laboratory to find out why he's being chased. There he meets the real Spirou, who doesn't really treat him like a **machine** like everybody else did, but more like another himself. Since, well, he's the hero, real!Spirou has the scientists arrested, and lets Clone!Spirou escape. The story closes on Clone!Spirou leaving Europe on a boat, with Seccotine (usually a comic relief in the other stories, but here treated as a character who always wanted to date with Real!Spirou and is implied to eventually have a romantic relationship with Clone!Spirou), who asks him in the last panel what is **his** name, personally, indicating that at last, Clone!Spirou is beginning to be someone else distinct from Real!Spirou.
-   Metamorpho's clone Shift tries to live his own life as a member of the Outsiders, with the original Metamorpho's blessing. But when his android girlfriend gets corrupted by pre-existing evil programming, betrays the team, and dies, Shift says he can't bear to live any more and begs Metamorpho to reabsorb him, which he reluctantly does.
-   **My Little Pony** actually has this. In the original '80s incarnation, there were "baby" versions of several ponies; Baby Shady, Baby Heartthrob, etc. The comic even adds a Baby Applejack and Baby Firefly. They looked and acted just like the originals but smaller and with simplified cutie marks. The show never questions this but the UK comic has a story about a magic mirror that creates them (well, two of them, but the others can be presumed to have the same origin) in response to their mothers' wish. They get their own storylines and are generally characters unto themselves, and nobody finds cloning yourself with a magic mirror to be a bad thing. (Compare to when Pinkie Pie tried something similar.)
-   Namorita of the New Warriors is the clone of Namora, Sub-Mariner's seldom-seen cousin, a Distaff Counterpart who failed to catch on. Namorita, "Nita" to her friends, is not just a character in her own right, but **much** more of a major character, appearing continually whereas Namora sometimes goes decades without having her existence acknowledged. Namora couldn't have children, so she had her science folks implant her with an embryo made from herself. The plot has always treated her like more of a daughter, though her clone status has been discovered and caused trouble at times. Namorita's death at the beginning of **Civil War (2006)** meant more appearances for Namora, but Death is Cheap and Namorita's back. Her "mom" is still around, though. It should also be noted that her status as a clone was a Retcon introduced years after her introduction, which is certainly the main reason it has never been central to her characterization.
-   In **PS238**, Tyler is eventually cloned, the clone specifically designed with only part of a brain so that the original could use him as a spare body. (For the record, the original didn't know any of this.) Through an odd set of circumstances, the clone gained sapience, (politely) kicked Tyler out of his body, grew the rest of his brain and wound up being adopted as the original's brother, "Toby." In fact, Toby winds up with Parental Favoritism, since he has superpowers and Tyler doesn't.
-   **Spider-Man**:
    -   At the end of **The Clone Saga**, Peter and Ben have pretty well reconciled themselves to their situation and decided to consider each other brothers. Then Ben melts. After he got better, he wound up starring in his own title.
    -   In the original Marvel What If? involving the original cloning incident with the clone surviving, Peter is nothing but considerate to his duplicate's plight once things settle down. They agree to help him make his own life, while both of them can split the load of being Spider-Man. Really the only disagreement is who has to sleep on the couch until they can get a spare bed.
    -   Peter's other clone, Kaine, seems to have taken this route, becoming an Anti-Hero, with Peter even calling him his brother.
    -   The Ultimate Marvel Clone Saga makes Spider-Woman an Opposite-Sex Clone of Spider-Man, with all his memories. She is treated as her own character in and out of universe, though with perhaps not enough attention paid to the fact that from **her** point of view, life was normal (well, Peter normal) for 17 years and then one morning she was, well, a **she,** and someone else owned her life. Then again, if **you** lived Peter Parker's life and were given a new one, you just might take it too.
        -   When she opens up about her situation to Miles Morales, Peter's successor, she admits she found it difficult to deal with or talk about, and she feels she's not a real person — she's not Peter, but she's not her own person, either. When they go up against the bad guy who funded the Clone Saga, **he** calls Spider-Woman not real, too, and that's about when Miles finally has enough of him.
    -   In **Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy**, Peter wonders whether or not Gwen can truly be considered the "real" Gwen. He acknowledges that even if she is a clone, she still deserves her own life.
        -   The New U cloning process is capable of truly resurrecting the dead, as proven with Ben Reilly in the **Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider** when Mistress Death stated that Ben's soul was horribly damaged from being killed and resurrected dozen of times by the Jackal, and so all the dead brought back in the event were truly reborn.
    -   Spider-Girl gets one too, and while they teased her possibly going evil, she hasn't. She is, however, an Anti-Hero and something of a wild card. After a decent run, "April Parker" does die for her 'sister' May in the Grand Finale.
    -   **Spider-Man: The Animated Series** never treated clones as anything but real people, making the death of Tomato in the Mirror Mary Jane very sad. Also, the cross-dimensional team of Spider-Men in the two-part finale included a Ben Reilly whose nemesis was his world's Peter Parker. They'd been through something like the Clone Saga, but neither we nor they **ever** learned who the original was.
    -   In the "Director's Cut" of the **The Clone Saga**, Ben has already made his own life and masquerades as a distant relative of Aunt May. After being told of the situation, Peter and Mary Jane have no problem with Ben and readily accept him as part of the family, with Ben only seeing their infant daughter as his niece rather than biological daughter. And in this version, he lives.
-   **Superman** examples:
    -   Superboy (Kon-El/Conner Kent) in the comics and the animated series **Young Justice**. In both versions he turns out to be cloned from Superman **and** Lex Luthor, who provided some of his DNA to stabilize the sample, so he's not an exact copy of anyone.
        -   Back when Kon-El was still considered to be the modified clone of Dr. Paul Westfield the idea of clones being their own people and being worth no less than people born by regular means regardless of their origin was examined from every angle in his own series. Kon was of course a firm believer in this idea while his frequent foes Agenda saw clones as a disposable resource.
        -   The **Young Justice** Superboy was created to replace Superman if he died or kill him if he turned evil (at least, according to the people of dubious ethics at Cadmus who grew him in the first place) and doesn't have his memories, but the teen really looks up to him at first, which makes Superman's rejection of "parental responsibilities" a big disappointment. They get over it eventually, with Superman ultimately considering Superboy a little brother.
    -   In "Who Stole Supergirl's Life?", a depowered clone removes Supergirl's memories from her civilian life in order to try to take her place. Kara eventually gets her memories back but she actually feels sorry for her duplicate, acknowledging the fact that she was only a desperate girl who wanted a life of her own, and she promises to help her clone create her own identity.
    -   Bizarro and Bizarrogirl are imperfect clones of Superman and Supergirl. Bizarro even has his own planet, consisting of imperfect clones of Superman's friends and family. And they embrace their imperfection and hate perfection. In the Silver Age, Superman even carved the planet into a cube for them so it wouldn't be a "perfect" spherical planet.
    -   This was the reason for the Black Zero terrorist attacks in Post-Crisis Krypton's past. The group were railing against Kryptonian society's edict of using clones as "spare parts", arguing this very trope.
    -   In **Crucible**, Supergirl gets mad when Maxima repeatedly refers to Kon as "the clone". When Maxima points out that Kryptonians — in the Post-**Flashpoint** universe — regarded clones as "abominations", Kara replies that, yes, that's exactly what she did, but she has gotten over her prejudices.
        
        **Maxima:** "Why are you suddenly defending the clone?"  
        **Supergirl:** "Stop calling him that. He has a name."  
        **Maxima:** "Ah, yes. "Kon"— Or should I say "Abomination". Isn't that what your people called clones?"\[...\]  
        **Superboy:** "It's true, Kara. You have called me that."  
        **Supergirl:** "That was... before. I know you better now. Kon has a new meaning for me."
        
    -   In **The Killers of Krypton**, the Omega Men fight an army of Supergirl clones created by Harry Hokum. Said clones are defective, malformed, mindless killing machines; but even so, Kara regards them as poor, unfortunate innocent souls whom she tries to reach out and persuade to snap out of their programming and let her help them.
-   In **The Transformers (Marvel)**, there were a group of Autobots whose origins were "Some Autobots back on Cybertron made full copies of their data to be put into new bodies if needed; guess what, now we need 'em." By Fridge Logic, that makes the Earth versions of them just the same as many a **tragic** clone; suddenly someone else is living your life and you're an Expendable Clone. The fact that there are other versions of these four wandering around on Cybertron never comes up. Presumably the Earth versions of them never complain because they did volunteer for it; they probably thought "Hey, I'm on that weird "Earth" planet now; let me take care of the crisis that's bad enough to activate this plan, and worry about which "me" gets my room back home later, assuming there's a later." Sadly, we never **do** get to see any member of this group meet up with his Alternate Self. In general, as befitting alien robots, their views on creating life and what makes you "alive" isn't quite the same as a human.
-   The Vision is a mental clone of Wonder Man (even though, in practice, the two have never actually behaved very much alike), and his entire character arc has revolved around his attempts to live his own life. His lot in life has varied a lot over the years Depending on the Writer. Some writers give him a fair shake, but others seem to just inexplicably hate the poor guy.
    -   **The Avengers (Kurt Busiek)**: Vision becomes angry and resentful after Wonder Man's resurrection. But not because of the Love Triangle: it's because Vision's mind is based on that of Simon. Jazz, literature, chess... everything he likes comes from him. He could dismiss it and be his own person while Simon was dead, but now that he's alive, he feels like an Expendable Clone.
-   This causes some friction in **W.I.T.C.H.** between the Guardians and their Astral Drops, that, differently from the animated adaptation, are always sentient... And don't like being treated as mere substitutes. The resentment coming from this causes quite some trouble, at least until the Oracle intervenes while calling the Guardians out on their actions.
    -   Differently from the others, Hay Lin's copy Pao Chai **doesn't** resent her original, as Hay Lin treated her as a sister with an "unusual" situation and her own personality, with the only caveat that she referred to herself as Hay Lin while covering for her (Pao Chai was the only one who choose her name and was quite insistent on being called that-leading to Hay Lin realizing she was indeed her own person and them making their pact). That causes some friction between **Pao Chai and the other Astral Drop**, as while she goes along with their rebellion it's more out of solidariety and would prefer not causing Hay Lin trouble.
-   X-Men:
    -   The **X-Men** had Madelyne Pryor, the clone of Jean Grey, who unfortunately became evil due to psycho-emotional baggage involving this trope: she was created by Evilutionary Biologist Mr. Sinister to replace Jean Grey in order to continue the propagation of the Summers-Grey mixed bloodline, and felt abandoned by her husband, Scott Summers, when Jean returned from the dead and he went to check if this was true.
    -   There's also Joseph, the Raise Him Right This Time clone of Well-Intentioned Extremist Magneto, who was secretly created as part of an Evil Plan to Take Over the World by a former Fangirl of Magneto (and who was thought by everyone to be a de-aged and amnesiac Magneto<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> until the original was revealed to be alive), who made a Heroic Sacrifice Saving the World the world from Magneto. Then, he Came Back Wrong thanks to being resurrected by a mutant hater to stoke fear, when Magneto was on the Good Is Not Nice and Good Is Not Soft side of the revolving door, in **Magneto: Not A Hero**. He started embracing the old legacy of terror, and the mutant hater very quickly found that Evil Is Not a Toy. Magneto did try and talk Joseph down, but cuttingly described him as "nothing but my clone". He also had warped clones of the original Brotherhood, whose necks Magneto snapped, and Magneto ultimately killed him - and the mutant hater.
    -   Stryfe is another aspect of the Grey-Summers family kudzu, being a back-up clone of Cable who was stolen and raised by Apocalypse as his heir/future host. He also insisted that **he** was the original, and was not especially happy to find out that he was the clone. It was even worse, when it transpired that while Stryfe was a powerhouse, Cable at his peak (with the techno-organic virus in remission) far surpassed him, and their little half-brother, Nate Grey, far surpassed **both of them put together** - which led to Stryfe trying to siphon off both of their powers.
    -   X-23, an Opposite-Sex Clone of Wolverine, has a completely different personality from Wolverine's. However, because of her Dark and Troubled Past, it was a while before she even realized she **had** a personality. It's also played with quite substantially, as the lead scientist on the project which created her did **not** differentiate her from Wolverine, and much of the torture and abuse she suffered as a child was the result of him exacting Revenge by Proxy, while the Facility as a whole tends not to view her as a human being with her own wants and desires, instead considering her just a weapon. Additionally, even after joining the X-Men Laura was at times subjected to bullying over her nature, with Hellion in particular using "clone" as a slur (though they did eventually come to accept her). Perhaps even worse was Hellverine's attempts to seduce her into his service by implying that as a clone she doesn't have a soul, which sufficiently rattles Laura that she asks Claudine Renko about it while the latter is the process of **trying to steal her body**, and later making the **same** inquiry with the demon Blackheart. For the record, Blackheart claims she does have a soul, pointing out that she's currently in Hell, and you need a soul to get into Hell in the first place. In **All-New Wolverine** she is **very** insistent that her own clones are and should be treated as people. Only one of those clones, Gabby, survives, and is taken in by Laura, who considers her to be her sister. Logan for his part always treated her as family, with their exact relationship usually resembling a father and daughter. When, in a pretty complicated example, Laura is believed to be dead and cloned again by Krakoa, the older Laura tells her younger clone that she is going to live and let live and the clone is welcome to remain the Wolverine, but Laura is going to go away and they both better hope they never meet again.
    -   This is touched upon in **House and Powers of X**. The Krakoans are revived through a special process by a group of mutants known as the Five which is effectively cloning, but the people revived are effectively the original to them. However, to prevent duplicants from existing, X-Factor is created to make sure those who died are dead-dead and, thus, certify their resurrection. However, some mutants are not revived **because** they are clones. Gabby points out that Madelyne Pryor hasn't revived, but Magik tries to reassure her that she wasn't revived because she was **evil**, not because she is a clone. This still frightens Gabby as she's worried she might die and not be revived (especially since the Krakoans haven't had any real problems reviving people arguably far worse than Maddy...). When she does get killed, the Five get sick of this arbitrary dictat, resurrect her, and politely but very firmly inform the Quiet Council that they believe in this trope on the grounds that while they share the same genetics, clones are different **people**.
-   **Y: The Last Man**: The series has this likelihood at the end of the series, where cloning is used to preserve the human race.

Clones Are People, Too Example in Fan Works

-   In **Origins**, a **Mass Effect**/**Star Wars**/**Borderlands**/**Halo** Massive Multiplayer Crossover Athena is a fusion of her highly-trained predecessors, relying on Genetic Memory to take only the best from each. However, she is her own character and the fact that she is a clone never really comes up. Her sisters created by Atlas (later taken by Jakobs) were made for an entirely different purpose.
-   The **Pony POV Series**, has Fluttercruel, who was the being Discord created when he couldn't break Fluttershy and considers herself Fluttershy's clone, even though the two are Sharing a Body. Despite looking identical to Fluttershy except for darker fur and lacking a Cutie Mark (though she eventually earns a **different** Cutie Mark), she has a completely different personality (the audio adaptation's illustrations added Cute Little Fangs and **slightly** Hellish Pupils as well). Despite this, she personally believes she's just a copy and has an identity crisis due to that fact. However, Fluttershy believes Fluttercruel is no less a pony than herself, and both refer to Fluttershy as her mother. Fluttercruel eventually comes to accept it and it's revealed she has her own soul separate from Fluttershy's. It's also stated there's a possibility that Fluttershy is the clone created by Twilight's memory spell and Fluttercruel is simply the original Mind Raped so completely that she's changed completely, or that the real Fluttershy was killed by Discord and **both** are clones. Despite this, neither really cares, as they're still separate beings altogether.
-   **New Stars**: The Union used this as it's reason for making the cloning of sentient beings illegal. Ed and Kelly explain to Isaac that everyone agreed that cloning organs held numerous benefits (as it allowed for doctors to perform transplants quickly without having to wait for donors), but everyone agreed that there were few ethical reasons for cloning sentient beings. This is why everyone is shocked when Maxx reveals that he's a clone, and why a majority pf the crew is angered at how the Republic treats its army.
-   **3 Slytherin Marauders** has the young Tom Riddle preserved in the Horcrux diary as one of the main characters and he grows to become a **very different** person from his other self.
-   The Clone That Got Away involves one of the clones from **Too Many Pinkie Pies** arriving too late to the clone roundup, sees her sisters getting banished/executed, and promptly decides to GTFO lest the same fate befall her.
-   **The Two Sides of Daring Do** has an ancient artifact called the Chisel of Pygmalion ends up making a clone of AK Yearling/Daring Do from her books. While Mana Clones are mentioned, Yearling takes the clone's pulse to make sure that this trope is in effect and the clone isn't depicted by the story as anything but a living thing. At the climax when a beatdown from Ahuizotl results in the clone realizing she's fictional and questioning her existence to the point of **losing her Cutie Mark**, Yearling has to reassure her she's her own being, realizing herself she needs to treat the clone more like a person. In fact, at the end, it's revealed Equestrian law makes a distinction between nonsapient clones and things like the Daring Do clone who Yearling adopts as her daughter.
-   In **Avengers: Infinite Wars**, when the Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe) find themselves caught up in the Clone Wars, none of the Avengers ever show any sign that they consider the clones less than people. This makes the discovery of the inhibitor chips (especially such programs as Order 66) particularly disturbing for Earth’s heroes during a mission to Kamino; one reason they keep that discovery secret from the majority is that they don't want people turning on the clones out of paranoia and fear, Earth's heroes only sharing the revelation with the Jedi and Senators they truly trust.
-   Arguably the point of the **Naruto** fanfic **In the Blood (justplainrii)**, which revolves around the discovery of a handful of clones assumed to be made by Orochimaru. A lot of them turn out to be very, very different from their originals, and have their own lives and identities.
-   The **Facing the Future Series** reveals that the rest of the Fentons feel as strongly about this with Danielle as much as Danny to the point that they adopt her into the family.
-   **The Bridge**:
    -   Xenilla <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> is a heavily modified clone of Godzilla Senior. He was created when Godzilla's cells were carried into a warp hole by Mothra in outerspace and exposed to the energy of a star going nova. The cells bonded to energized crystals, resulting in him. On the logic that he isn't entirely Godzilla Senior genetically due to the crystal mutation and small bits of Mothra's mana just as a child isn't entirely one of their parents, he sees himself as his own individual and considers himself the late Senior's son rather than his clone.
    -   Biollante is a clone formed from combining Godzilla Senior's, a human biologist named Erika Shiragami's, and a rose's DNA as per the 1989 movie. While initially driven by Erika's soul, Erika's spirit passed on when Biollante reconstituted herself years later. After some identity crisis, she firmly sees herself as her own individual especially after bonding with an toddler-aged Godzilla Junior while helping look after him. After some awkwardness, Godzilla Senior can sense their blood tie and effectively adopts her as his first-born child and daughter. In the modern day Xenilla and Godzilla Junior consider her their older sister, with Biollante seeing them as her younger brothers.
    -   Each successive Mothra is asexually reproduced by their predecessor, with slight alterations as each generation gets stronger and stronger. Because of this they are all essencially clones, but see their line as generations with the predecessor being their successor's mother.
-   **The PreDespair Kids** and **Ask The New Hope's Peak** both have Ryouko Otonashi, a clone of Junko Enoshima based on her true non-despair personality, who is nonetheless treated like a regular person and friend by most of the cast.
-   In **War and Peace in Mind**, Penny is distraught after Cutter kills one of her clones.
-   In **Dungeon Keeper Ami**, Tiger will loudly state that she is a person in her own right, and that she is more "The older and bolder sibling!" than a clone.
-   Averted in **Seed** — Taylor intentionally makes sure that the clones are never sentient, and refuses to go into certain branches of her tech tree in case she accidentally makes one that can think or learn.
-   In **Marionettes**, the clones created by Queen Majesty's Foal Making Mirror are no less alive than anyone else, nor seen as less than alive. Similarly, the titular marionettes are also acknowledged to be their own people regardless of their composition. Even early on, the protagonists don't care that Trixie may be just an artificial replacement for the real one; a pony is a pony and a friend is a friend.
-   Ferris and most other people hold this opinion in **Life Ore Death**, but Ferris mentions potential plans to have kids via cloning, so she wouldn't have to bother with pregnancy the normal way.
-   In **The Myamoto Project**, it turns out the Nurse Joys and Officer Jennys are actually clones of two women, Joy Happenstance and Jennifer Justica, who volunteered to clone themselves to create the ideal nurses and police. Most Joys and Jennys don't learn of their heritage until they're 37. They're treated as normal people who happen to "coincidentally" look alike.
-   In **Coreline** there are a great many Alternate Self versions of a single Fictional character running around, which leads to many people (villainous, of course) believing that the Expendable Alternate Universe is at work and one Alternate can be as similar as the next. Of course, the heroes believe in this trope, and in some stories (such as **Tales of the Vanguard**) being told that their friends and loved ones are Expendable Clones leads to some **serious** anger.
-   In **Kara of Rokyn**, Kara's clone Linda is definitely her own person with her own personality traits and life goals, and she is treated like such by Kara and her parents, who take Linda in and treat her as their second daughter.
-   The **Empath: The Luckiest Smurf** story "Vanity's Double", which was meant to be the sequel to **The Smurfs** story "The Hundredth Smurf", explores Vanity's Mirror Self duplicate Century having to put up with being treated as nothing more than a duplicate by his own "brother", despite having distinct personality differences such as Century not being afraid of swords whereas Vanity is afraid of even handling a sword. Eventually, during the Robin Smurf play that they both star in together, Century's presence as Vanity's swordfighting double proves to be what makes Century to be recognized as a Smurf in his own right.
-   In **EVA Sessions: Someplace Vast and Dry**, Rei and the Mermaids (Haru, Sakura, Kei, Tsukiko, Mari, Aimi, Momo, Kimu and Aya) were all created by Yui and Kyoko using frozen samples of Yui's own ovum and artificial sperm containing genetic material from Lilith; however, each of the girls quickly develop distinct personalities, and practically all NERV staff recognize them as Gendo and Yui's daughters.
-   In **Neon Genesis Evangelion: Genocide**, everybody — even Gendo — treats Rei's third clone as her own person with her own identity, memories and opinions. At one point, she asks Shinji to just call her Rei, instead of Ayanami, pointing out that it was what he called her predecessor, and she is not her.
    
    **Shinji:** Ayanami...  
    **Rei:** I am not her. A name carries a great deal of weight to a person. It is also not just a name. It is also a thought. A feeling. I share her name, but not the other things attached to it. Because I'm not her.  
    **Shinji:** Then how should I feel, seeing you in front of me and not being able to call you what I called her? Because you look just like her.  
    **Rei:** You should grieve, like I wish I could. You are lucky. I have these emotions inside me. And despite that, there is something missing. As if I have misplace something that used to have great value. I know they do not belong to me, and at the same time I know — I feel — like they do.  
    **Shinji:** Aya— I'm sorry.  
    **Rei:** Do not be. You miss her, I know. I wish I could be her just for you. I wish for many things.
    
-   In **Everqueen**, Isha absolutely refuses to clone Astartes for the Emperor, remembering too well the We Have Reserves attitudes of the War in Heaven.
-   In **Harry and the Shipgirls**, Abyssal Research Princess wound up trying to create Abyssalized Shipgirls of Fubuki, Kisaragi, Shoukaku, and Saratoga to make the Shipgirls face their own worst enemy. However, they turned on her and sided with the Shipgirls, who all treat them as nothing more or less than their own people.
-   **A Certain Droll Hivemind**: Exploring this is a theme throughout the fic. The story takes place shortly after the clones were rescued from the experiment that was meant to end in their deaths; while the Sisters now understand that the Network **as a whole** deserves to live, there are signs that they haven't quite internalized that they are individuals who **also** deserve to live. During the experiment they were all completely identical, but now are beginning to diverge due to the impossibility of keeping updated on the entire Network at once. The main viewpoint clone, Misaka-11111, appears to not know what to do about this, and in particular she seems disturbed that if she dies, the Network won't be able to back-up all her memories. Overall, she switches between "we" and "I" largely interchangeably, and varies between insisting that the clones are all a single person or that they are all individuals based on what is most convenient for her at the moment. The fact that she can have arguments and rivalries with other clones certainly implies that they are individuals, and every named clone has at least a few traits that marks them out as unique; 10032 is clearly in love with Touma, 10901 talks constantly about how she's having fun in Hawaii while her Sisters are in the cold and the rain, and 11111 complains the most.
-   **Tarkin's Fist**: In grand Star Wars tradition, the clones, through Commander Cody, are characterized as loyal veterans and soldiers treated with callous indifference by their non-clone commanding officers.

Clones Are People, Too Example in Films — Live-Action

-   Both this and Expendable Clone are explored in **The 6th Day**.
-   **Blade Runner**: Rachael is a replicant designed to be as human-like as possible and to have a more complex backstory (in the form of implanted memories) than the others. Her creator treats her like a human, and it's only when Deckard shows up that she starts to suspect that she isn't human.
-   Both **Clonus** and **The Island (2005)** run on the same plot point, clones that were made to be nothing but living organ recipients for their originals that will be eventually killed and cut open to provide said organs (in the latter film the clones are said to be brain-dead to the investors to prevent them from decrying this, but the doctor in charge then says that the clones could **not** be made brain-dead because of a Handwave that this led to unviable organs for some reason). But the problem of course becomes that said clones can have things like inquisitiveness, and sexual desires...
-   **Gemini Man**: Junior would rather not be used as an expendable Redshirt Army. Henry is also horrified at Clay's plan to replace all US soldiers with clones to be expendable cannon fodder.
-   A major theme of **Jurassic World** is that the dinosaurs created by the scientists at the park are real, living animals, not just "assets", as the park officials tend to call them. The **I. rex** is so vicious partly because it was raised in total isolation, and the military man who wants to use the raptors as weapons (and had the **I. rex** designed as one) is repeatedly told that trying to control nature like that is a bad idea, and gets eaten when he doesn't listen.
-   In the sequel, **Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom**, this theme continues, as it is debated whether or not to save the dinosaurs from a volcano on Isla Nublar that is about to erupt and wipe them all out, because they are technically man-made and not natural animals. Later, the protagonists find out that the little girl Maisie is actually a clone of the late daughter of Lockwood, but they don't treat her any different for this, while the villains are implied to want her for experimentation. During the climax, all the dinosaurs are trapped in a room filling up with poisonous gas, and the protagonists are given the choice to let them loose onto the mainland or do nothing and watch them all suffocate to death. They're unable to go through with letting them loose, but Maisie sets them free anyway, because as she states:
    
    **Maisie**: I had to... They're alive... like me.
    
-   **Moon**: Despite the way Lunar Industries treats them, both Sam clones act very much like normal human beings.
-   The clones in **Multiplicity** are created to be work horses and take on the burdens the hero doesn't want. In the end, they leave to have their own lives (the three clones decide to stay together, but all have VERY distinct personalities).
-   **Replicant**: Jake initially treats the clone of a Serial Killer he's chasing as an expendable asset or no different than the person he was cloned from, but eventually warms up to him and starts treating him as a human being. The clone even gets to live out a new life after Faking the Dead.
-   The later **Resident Evil** movies extensively feature cloning as a plot point. Hundreds are killed off every time Umbrella Prime stages a product demonstration, and certain executives use individual clones of themselves as expendable decoys. Alice reacts with disgust at the treatment of the "basic models" and doesn't considered her simulation-self's daughter to be anything but a little girl in need of rescue. Alice herself has led a very different life than her gene donor, and it shows.
-   Most of the clones in the **Star Wars** prequels are depicted as expendable... except the legendary Bounty Hunter Boba Fett. See, his predecessor Jango Fett provided the genetic template for the enhanced Clone Troopers, and as part of the deal, he requested an unmodified clone to raise on his own. Jango treats Boba like a beloved son, not as an unnatural duplicate, and Boba's artificial origins in no way detract from his badassery.

Clones Are People, Too Example in Literature

-   In **A Light in the Darkness**, this is how the Slavic Empire treats clones. The Utopian States, on the other hand, believes that clones are expendable.
-   In C. J. Cherryh's **Alliance/Union** universe, the Union uses cloning extensively to build up their population. These are divided into "Parental Replicants" commissioned specifically by certain people (or to replace the deceased) who are treated as human beings, and "azi" (artificial zygote insemination) who are genetically engineered and copied for use as indentured servants, though the children of azi have the same rights as naturally born humans. In **Forty Thousand in Gehenna**, a bunch of mostly azi colonists are dumped on a planet in order to create a Lost Colony (denying the planet to the Alliance).
-   In Richard K. Morgan's **Altered Carbon**, the protagonist uses Brain Uploading to make a duplicate of himself near the end because his plan to bring down the Big Bad requires him to be in two places at once. Each version of him acknowledges the other to be just as real and deserving of existence, but one of them has to go, and they settle it by reasonable conversation and ultimately with a game of rocks/paper/scissors, with the loser being the one who gets deleted.
-   The entire argument of the resistance in **Beta**.
-   A central plot point of the **Colony Mars** series
-   In **Courtship Rite**, most clans are busy with their super breeding programs, and don't bother with cloning, since identical genes are, by definition, not improved genes. The Liethe are the exception. Every Liethe secretly has a number of clone-sisters of varying ages, and no outsider ever learns the true identity of a Liethe. The outside world only meets fake personas which can be played by different clone-sisters in turn. The clones are very much different individuals with different skills. Some members of a clone group like the se-Tufi are always trained as assassins; the se-Tufi Who Walks In Humility is one such.
-   Simon R. Green's **Deathstalker** has this as one of its central points, where clones are slaves and a 'degenerate' subspecies of humanity. The fight to give them actual rights carries on well beyond the initial rebellion, as best shown with the Stevie Blues and Evangeline Shreck.
-   **Edenborn**: Halloween clones himself and sends the clone through the same virtual reality child-rearing he experienced, expecting another copy of himself. He is surprised when Deuce exhibits unique personality choices, but recognizes his individuality and takes him as a son.
-   Cloning is commonplace in **Genome**, and clones have all the same rights as normal people. In fact, highly-skilled people are often cloned multiple times in order to preserve their genetics. Clones often take the name of the original but add a middle name that consists of "C" (for "clone") and an ordinal number. For example, Peter C-the-forty-fourth Valk is the 44th clone of Peter Valk. While not outright mentioned, it can be assumed that the problems of Clone Degeneration have been solved, given that the main theme of the novel is that Genetic Engineering Is the New Nuke. This doesn't stop some people from hating clones, partly for the same reason people in Real Life hate illegal immigrants (i.e. taking jobs).
    -   The **Dancing in the Snow** prequel takes place a century earlier, prior to the genetic engineering boom, and the novel's central theme is cloning and free will. It's revealed that the Big Bad of the novel is, in fact, a female clone of a genetic engineering genius (the only character to appear in the original novel), who resolves to change humanity with the help of dozens of clones of her own (both male and female). Whenever they find another clone, they explain the situation and then give the clone a choice, whether to accept a new set of memories from the original or not. Either way, the clone is welcome. The protagonist turns out to be one of the clones but refuses to join them.
-   **Heroics**: Part of the way to tell who the worst characters are is to see which ones treat Alix Tolvaj as an actual person instead of a thing. Resident Jerkass Justin explicitly refers to her as an 'it'; Big Bad Alice — who Alix was cloned from — treats her (and others like her) as a completely expendable tool; Big Bad John Wechsler doesn't interact with her much but clearly sees her as nothing more than a wayward experiment; and Evil All Along Stephanie wants her to be executed mostly just for existing. The rest of the main cast is much, **much** more welcoming.
-   Explored in the **H.I.V.E. Series** with Otto, who finds out he is a clone and worries briefly about whether he could be considered human. However, he (and the rest of the cast) accept his situation. However, when Zero, Otto's own clone shows up, Otto and HIVEmind kill him without too much guilt. Justified in that he had psychologically tortured Laura, but still.
-   **House of the Scorpion** is big on this trope, although most characters in it aren't. It helps that the main character himself is a clone, with a noticeably different personality from his creator.
    -   The sequel hints that he may not be too different from his original.
-   In **Kiln People**, some people treat Dittos as individual beings worthy of the same rights as humans, to the point where there's a Ditto hospital, even though Dittos' lifespans are only a couple of days.
-   In **Line of Delirium**, cloning is highly illegal in The Empire, along with genetic engineering. It's eventually revealed that the protagonist Kay is a genetically-engineered "super" with enhanced strength, speed, intelligence, and linguistic capabilities. He finds out that the boy he's been escorting, who is supposed to be the son of Curtis van Curtis, the wealthiest man in the Empire, is, in fact, van Curtis's clone, although he's, more or less, raised as his son. Despite this, their personalities couldn't be more different, especially since Arthur (the clone) has already died so many times that Kay doesn't think that Arthur can ever truly grow up (mentally that is). He also finds a boy named Tommy Arano, who turns out to be the original clone of Curtis van Curtis, who had his memory erased by aliens and adopted by a human family. Arthur was created under the mistaken assumption that the previous one was dead (memory erasure triggers aTan just like death). When they finally meet, Tommy is noticeably order than Arthur and considers himself Arthur's older brother. At the end of the novel, Arthur joins his "father" beyond the Line, while Tommy opts to leave with Kay, proving that they're different. Inverted at the end of the sequel **Emperors of Illusions**, where Tommy is the one who decides to leave this universe and have another one created for him, while Arthur takes his place at Kay's side. It's stated that, if anyone finds out the truth about either Kay or Arthur/Tommy, his life would be forfeit under Imperial law.
-   Played with in **Neuromancer**. The Tessier-Ashpools made multiple clones of their children, of whom only 3Jane (the second clone of Jane Tessier-Ashpool) is a significant character, but old man Ashpool raped and killed multiple clones of his daughter.
-   In **Never Let Me Go**, it turns out that proving this trope was the objective of Hailsham's Gallery — unfortunately, the world didn't want to consider that clones could be people, because that would mean giving up their safer, disease-free world, so Hailsham was defunded and the clones were pushed back into the shadows.
-   **The Pride of Parahumans**: Parahumans are sterile, so they reproduce by cloning. On Vesta Guild leaders buy so many clone progeny that they form "Cloneclans", most of whom go into the family business. But a few, such as Olga of Clan Wolf and Maximus Griggs have a few differences of opinion from their progenitors.
-   The main point behind **Project Tau**, where humanity is a legal status rather than a biological one, and clones (euphemistically referred to as Projects) are viewed — and usually treated — as livestock.
-   Hannu Rajaniemi's **The Quantum Thief**: the Founder copyclans rule over most of the inner Solar System. Anyone who isn't a Founder copy is a second class citizen at best, and a sentient missile guidance system at worst.
-   Roy of **Starling** is very much his own person, despite the efforts of his adoptive parents and the media.
-   **Star Wars Legends**:
    -   This is the whole point of the **Republic Commando Series** by Karen Traviss.
    -   Earlier, it was a subplot in the **Hand of Thrawn** duology. A group of Imperial sleeper agents are all clones of Baron Soontir Fel, ace pilot, but they simply want to live out a normal life as farmers. Later, it's revealed that the trope was invoked, with their following the Call to Agriculture being the point; Thrawn was preparing for the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong, so his widespread sleeper cells **aren't** people who want to destroy the New Republic, but people who would fight tooth and nail to protect what's theirs, just like any other sapient.
        -   Even earlier, this got completely averted in **The Thrawn Trilogy**. Clones are flash-grown expendable soldiers who feel wrong in the Force, the Big Bad clone is a mentally unstable monster, and everyone's still terrified of clones because of what happened in the Clone Wars. All because nobody told Zahn what happened in the Clone Wars. This got chalked up to inferior cloning tech after the fact.
    -   In **Dark Lord—The Rise of Darth Vader**, the clone troopers have unique personalities and disagree about how best to interpret orders. When Ion Team hears about Order 66 secondhand, they refuse to kill the Jedi they've worked under and allow Roan Shryne, Bol Chatak, and Olee Starstone to escape. Shryne and Starstone experience strongly mixed feelings when they find themselves forced to kill other clone troopers to survive. Some clones even allow for a bit of levity; when Climber meets up with Shryne again, they share a common joke about how the clones are hard to tell apart.
        
        **Shryne:** The voice is familiar...  
        **Climber:** The face even more so.
        
-   Mary Cobourn from **Twig** develops as, and is treated as, her own person. In fact, her status as such isn't even questioned from the start — it's taken as given. Neither does Mary muse about the fact that she's a clone, and she isn't psychologically shaken up by it.
-   In the **Ukiah Oregon** series, Ukiah immediately considers Kitanning (A genetic duplicate of him grown from a mouse made from his blood; It Makes Sense in Context) a new person immediately and thereafter Kit is treated by everyone as his son. Likewise, Atticus and Ukiah are different people, and neither is entirely the same person as Magic Boy, their deceased progenitor)
-   Most clones in the **Vorkosigan Saga** world, where a clone is considered to be the child or sibling of person whose DNA it was made from, or the child of the person who commissioned the clone, depending on the planet and its laws. Mark Vorkosigan (Miles's clone) is an example of this, as he is considered Miles's brother and is treated as a completely different person. Clones as expendable property still exist on the lawless Jackson's Whole, though.
-   Cloning is largely illegal in the **Wayfarers** series, but the clones that do exist are shown to be their own people. Corbin is a Replacement Goldfish created by his father in the wake of his wife and unborn son dying, but is shown to grow and change in ways his creator didn't, despite their similarities. Pepper (formerly known as Jane 23) is one of a batch of identical clones created to be disposable slave labor, but even before she escapes, she and the other girls are all shown to have their unique skills and quirks, and after freeing herself, she quickly discovers her individuality and her own passions, even taking her new name from the discovery that she loves spices.

Clones Are People, Too Example in Live-Action TV

-   The humanoid-model Cylons in **Battlestar Galactica (2003)** vary on this. Numbers One, Two, Three, Four and Five don't get distinguishing characteristics from others of their own model, but the models played by main cast members, i.e. Numbers Six and Eight (Seven is extinct) have unique individuals like Caprica-Six, Shelly Godfrey, Tough Six, Gina Inviere, Natalie Faust, Lida and Sonja (Sixes) and Boomer, Athena, "Fakeathena" and Sweet Eight (Eights) in addition to the generic Sixes and Eights. They also vary on the memory-sharing factor. Athena downloaded Boomer's memories up to the point of the Miniseries and "Fakeathena" downloaded Athena's up to the point of "Rapture", but they don't do this automatically and (according to the producers) models vary on how often they do it. Even sharing a good chuck of memories didn't stop Boomer and Athena from developing in radically different directions.
    -   The movie **The Plan** finally introduces some variation in the Ones and Fours, with a One on Caprica and a Four in the Fleet making Heel Face Turns (meanwhile a Four on Caprica and a One in the Fleet do not).
-   Repeatedly adopted in **Blake's 7**.
    -   "Children of Auron", which features a society that practices large-scale cloning, is probably the most casual and realistic treatment of it in any Space Opera. Cally and her sister Zelda are depicted just like real-world natural twins, as independent individuals with their own personalities and motivations who just happen to look identical. The episode does, however, depict one hard-SF big disadvantage of large-scale cloning — lack of genetic variation leading to lack of disease resistance and vulnerability to epidemics.
    -   In "Weapon", Space Commander Travis encounters a clone Blake and is unable to resist killing him. The Clonemasters regard this as a **serious** breach of ethics and Servalan has to promise them that Travis will be punished. He isn't of course, as Servalan and Travis don't care much about killing anyone (in fact Travis accuses Servalan of using him to test the effectiveness of the clone). Another clone Blake is then used for their Evil Plan but helps foil it instead, having developed his own sense of ethics.
-   In **Buffy the Vampire Slayer**, Buffy's sister Dawn is technically a clone of Buffy, having been "made from the Slayer" by the Monks of Dagon. Initially, after this is discovered, some of the Scooby Gang want to treat Dawn as a made thing, but Buffy insists that she be treated as her sister.
-   The titular hero of **Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons** is a clone of a Spectrum agent who was killed and duplicated by the Mysterons in the first episode. He is never treated as anything other than a human by his fellow officers.
-   The X5 clones in **Dark Angel** are never treated as anything other than identical twins who shared a test tube instead of a womb. By the narrative, anyway. It helps that they **do not** share memories and the age difference between them is the same as normal "older" and "younger" twins. The examples we see are Jessica Alba as the main protagonist Max/X5-452 and Sam/X5-453 (a Season 2 one-shot character), and Jensen Ackles as Ben/X5-493 (a Season 1 one-shot character) and Alec/X5-494 (a regular cast member in Season 2). However, after the escape of the unit that Max and Ben were part of, Project Manticore did assume that their twins would be at the highest risk of pulling their own escape attempt and accordingly tightened the screws on them even more than on the other remaining X5s. Alec's comparatively blasé about it, but Sam resented Max for a long time afterward.
    -   At least some of the X7 series are clones of the X5s (we see Max and Zack/X5-599's mini-mes) and are certainly different from their grown-up originals, but in the sense of being 10-year-old soulless killers who share a Hive Mind.
-   **Doctor Who** occasionally explores this trope:
    -   "New Earth": The Doctor is **furious** when he finds out the Sisters of Plenitude are using thousands of human clones as guinea pigs to create their miracle cures and keeping them imprisoned in tubes, destroying the ones that become self-aware. He sees them as just as alive as himself and Rose.
    -   "The Doctor's Daughter": The Doctor's Opposite-Sex Clone is a true badass who eventually earns her father's respect.
    -   In "Journey's End", the Doctor's duplicate is a **very** different individual from his progenitor and is given a happy ending as Rose Tyler's Doppelgänger Replacement Love Interest.
    -   Explored thoroughly in "The Rebel Flesh"/"The Almost People". The clones in this case are doppelgängers, or "gangers", remotely controlled by humans and used to mine acid without endangering their real bodies. During a solar storm, the doppelgängers gain consciousness. Since they retain all the memories of the originals, a conflict over whether or not both versions can exist ensues. Ultimately, only one version of each person survives the events of the story, but two of those survivors are gangers.
    -   And **then** you have the twofold question of the original Osgood and her Zygon duplicate. Which one did Missy kill, and which one survived? And of the current Osgoods, which one is from the original pair and which one is the dead Osgood's Zygon replacement who used to look like Clara and go by "Bonnie"? Are they still a human and a Zygon or are they two Zygons now? Only the Osgoods know, and in the name of peace between humans and Zygons, they're not telling. As far as the show is concerned, it doesn't **matter** which is the original and which is the duplicate, because they're both people.
-   **Farscape**:
    -   One episode has several characters "doubled" for the nefarious purposes of a villain of weird tastes, who repeatedly states that this is not cloning, but perfect duplication — or as he liked to call it, "twinning". Both copies of the protagonist, John Crichton, survive the episode, remaining as crew members and participating in a Love Triangle with "himself" over their love interest, Aeryn. When she made a choice (somewhat forced by the situation at hand), Clone Angst set in for the other guy.
        
        **"I hope he's having a good time— No, wait, I hope he's having a** terrible **time. I just hope he treats her well."**
        
    -   There's a reason for the villain's Insistent Terminology. The twinning process appears to distill some of the original's essence into each double — and neither is the original. People the villain had done it over to and over again, producing a horde of duplicates, had been reduced to (a horde of) savages.
    -   Eventually one Crichton gets killed, but not before conceiving a child with Aeryn, who will go on to raise the baby with the other Crichton.
-   In **The Flash (2014)**, Zoom treats his time remnants as Expendable Clones, killing them rather casually to further his goals. Barry creates a time remnant of his own to stop Zoom, resulting in the remnant's Heroic Sacrifice. Unlike Zoom, Barry and his friends all treat the remnant as a person in his own right and a hero.
    -   Savitar, on the other hand, is the result of Team Flash promptly going Aesop Amnesia, and giving him shit for not being the real Barry.
-   **Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers**: At the end of the late Season 2 two-parter "Return of the Green Ranger", Tom (the formerly evil clone of Tommy) stays in colonial Angel Grove to live out his life. And possibly becomes Tommy's ancestor.
-   The whole point of **Orphan Black**. The main character and several others are all from a batch of clones, but apparent from sharing a certain tenacity they have **completely** different personalities, in an absolute tour de force by the actress, Tatiana Maslany.
    -   In fact, the clones having independent lives is part of the experiment, since most of them were put into fairly normal households (they were born to mothers who thought they were getting normal **in vitro** treatments) and allowed to live "normal" lives without knowledge of their clone status, while being unknowingly observed by "monitors" who report back to the Dyad.
    -   Later on, it's discovered that there is a male line from Project Castor (the women are from Project Leda), and with the exception of Ira they were all raised together by the military in barracks. While the Castors also develop different personalities, it's not nearly as evident as with the Ledas, especially since they get a lot less screen time.
    -   On the other hand, several people do consider clones to be either abominations (religious nuts) or obsolete (unethical scientists).
-   **The Outer Limits (1995)**: In the episode "Replica", the clone in question, complete with the memories of the original, was created to replace the wife of a bioengineer who was wrongly thought to be irreversibly comatose. When the original awakens, a discussion begins of how to handle the copy, but murder is clearly off the table and instead their plan would allow the clone to have her own independent life with a clone of the husband. The clone also notes how differences have begun to emerge between them.
-   **Sliders:** An episode late in the series revolves around this trope, on an alternate Earth where clones of wealthy individuals are grown and kept like animals for the purpose of organ transplants and blood transfusions. One of the protagonists gets mistaken for his alternate's clone. Naturally, our heroes help put an end to this inhumane system by the conclusion of the episode.
-   Alexander Luthor is considered his own person in Smallville, and not just a clone of Lex. Tess even raises him as her own son in an attempt to keep him from turning out like his progenitor. Eventually we find out that half of his DNA comes from Clark and he changes his name to Conner Kent, becoming like Clark's little brother. As per the "no tights, no flights" rule, we never hear the name "Superboy."
-   **Stargate**:
    -   **Stargate SG-1**:
        -   O'Neill's 16-year-old clone (who, disturbingly, does have his memories) is given the right to live his own life (paid for by the US Air Force no less). The (commented-on) difference between them as individuals comes at the end of the episode, when Young O'Neill chooses to go "back" to high school and do better this time, which Colonel O'Neill doesn't see the appeal of. Before that, they are exactly alike (which makes sense, as Clone O'Neill - and the audience - were initially led to believe he was the colonel de-aged).
        -   Zigzagged with SG-1's robot clones, who are given the right to live and all... so long as they remain on their own planet. The real SG-1 gets annoyed when they learn their copies didn't keep to this and went on their own exploration missions through the stargate. Robot O'Neill points out that they should have known they themselves would never have accepted such conditions. However, the duplicates get killed in action in their second appearance despite proving themselves "real" to the team.
    -   **Stargate Atlantis**:
        -   The robot clones of the Atlantis team (via different means than the **SG-1** example above) are proven to be equals and real people to the team but still treated as redshirts by the plot. It's kinda glaring whenever this happens — they've got all the skills that let the "real" team survive **hundreds** of these scrapes and worse — **plus** they're made of much sturdier stuff than human flesh (the Atlantis versions even have a Healing Factor!). Though one possibility (with both the Atlantis team clones and the above) would be that the clones really **don't want to live** deep down and find ways to end their lives heroically.
        -   Dr Beckett's clone is welcomed by the team and treated immediately as an equal. It helps that the real Carson is dead and the clone has most of his memories so he's just filling the old one's position. This is the first to get the same Plot Armor the original enjoyed as well — apparently, so long as one is left, it doesn't matter which one. Rodney goes out of his way to make sure it's the case, due in part to Survivor's Guilt over the original's death. When the clone suggests he joins a rescue mission, Rodney is the only one that refused, concerned that the others accepted "because he's a clone and they see him as expendable". However, the treatment of Clone Beckett goes a bit too far in another direction: both the team and the narrative itself view him as the exact same person as Original Beckett in a new body, rather than a new and separate person of his own.
-   In the **Star Trek: The Next Generation** episode "Second Chances", it's revealed that during a Teleporter Accident on a planet where it's only safe to beam down every 4 years, a clone of Will Riker was left behind for the next 8 years. He's eventually rescued and welcomed as a full member of Starfleet under the name "Thomas Riker", though he later leaves to join the Maquis. Interestingly, since the Will Riker who came back from the planet was the result of a secondary transporter beam to shore up the failing pattern lock, it's debatable whether or not **he** should technically be considered the clone and Thomas the original.
-   **Star Trek: Deep Space Nine**:
    -   In "A Man Alone", when someone tried to frame Odo for murder, he did so by cloning himself, then disguising himself and killing the clone. When he's eventually found out, he is told that "killing your own clone is still murder". The heroes accidentally create another clone, and he is said to be welcomed into Bajoran society as a regular member (and hopefully will lead a better life than the original).
    -   The Weyouns are generally treated as Expendable Clones, but the "defective" clone Weyoun Six, who makes a Heel–Face Turn and attempts to leave the Dominion, is treated as a distinct individual. His personality is similar to the other Weyouns, but he doesn't share their unquestioning acceptance of the Founders' decisions.
-   Both times in **Star Trek: Voyager** when the ship and crew were copied, they treated them with respect and allowed them to be their own beings. The copies from the Y/Demon class planet in "Course: Oblivion" parted on good terms with the originals and were allowed to live their own life, and when they eventually forgot that they were clones, they went on the same journey as the originals. This ends badly as both crew and ship deteriorate without their original atmosphere, and at the end when they all die within a stone's throw of the crew (the only ones who could have saved them), it's played for all the drama it deserves. The second time is in "Deadlock", when a Negative Space Wedgie creates two Voyagers in overlapping space with crew included; the only mistreatment brought out is an accident out of ignorance to the situation. When the ships come under attack, one of the ships is sacrificed to save the other, and a couple of the crew come to the other whose counterparts had died in the accident; now and for the rest of the series, Harry Kim and Naomi Wildman are the ones from the ship that **didn't** survive, and thus would be considered the 'cloned' or 'alternate' versions. The real kicker, though, is that no one figures out which ship is the copy.
-   Tackled head on in the **Star Trek: Enterprise** episode "Similitude", after Tucker's life is on the line after an engineering accident. Dr. Phlox uses one of his lab creatures to develop a rapid growing, short lifespan clone of Tucker for the purpose of harvesting essential brain tissue which could save Tucker's life. However, as the clone grows, and Tucker's memories, and even feelings start to emerge, they're suddenly faced with a moral dilemma when it's discovered that the clone won't survive the operation, and when it's discovered there's a potential method to extend his life, making it possible to live out normally. This causes a lot of troubling feelings within the crew when they start to wonder if Tucker's life is more valuable than his own clone.
-   **The Thundermans**: As disturbed as she is by having been cloned without her knowledge, and as annoyed as she is by her clone becoming stupid, Phoebe is still horrified when she thinks her parents killed her clone. They clear it up by revealing clone Phoebe was literally, not metaphorically, sent to the farm.

Clones Are People, Too Example in Podcasts

-   In **Mission to Zyxx**, the Cloned Light Infantry Nomadic Troopers, or CLINTs, are very prideful and individualistic, with deep-running rivalries and are very insistent about having their own particular talents (or, more often, other CLINTs having specific deficits they have to make up for). Non-CLINTs don't typically see the differences, though it's usually easier to humor a CLINT than trying to convince him he's identical to all the others.

Clones Are People, Too Example in Tabletop Games

-   In **Changeling: The Lost**, a character's Fetch has lived a very different life from the original, and sometimes has been in the Changeling's place for years or decades, meaning there's been a lot of time for divergence. Add to this the fact that Fetch are usually missing character trait the original had...including possibly a character **flaw,** meaning that the Changeling might come back to find a family man Fetch who's more moral and well-adjusted than the original. This doesn't apply to all Fetches...some of them might be aware of what they are, or just so poorly made that they tend toward sociopathy. But the vast majority didn't realize they weren't the original until a monster with their face and wood for skin crawled out of the mirror and shouted at them.
-   In **Genius: The Transgression** it's stated that clones (along with robots, and any other sapient life) are people. The Peerage's law even says so explicitly. However the Peerage is still full of mad scientists, and no matter what their laws say, mad scientists aren't always concerned about details like human rights.
-   Played for laughs in the comedic Witchalok class created for **Dungeons & Dragons** by the authors of **Penny Arcade**. The description for the "Which Witchalok?" ability specifically mentions that the duplicates of the player character it creates (which die at the beginning of the player's next turn) are real people with their own hopes and dreams.
-   **Lancer**: Union's anthrochauvinist Second Committee treated clones as the property of their progenitors. ThirdComm instituted legislation to make them equal to natural-born humans but some member polities, particularly Harrison Armory and the Karrakin Trade Baronies, still mass-produce them as expendable labor and soldiers. Notably, the current CEO of HA, Harrison III, is a clone of the corpro-state's founder, though one of the stories in All of the Above reveals that a whole batch of Harrison clones were created and all but the "best" were intended to be disposed of.

Clones Are People, Too Example in Roleplay

-   **Hero City Capitalof Justice** doesn't reveal that Ossie is Bill's clone rather than his son until near the end; up until that point he's spent the whole plot being very much an individual.
-   Elidia of **Hyperspace Evangelion** is portrayed as a one-of-a-kind prototype Manufactured human. NERV initially intends to "mass" produce the Manufactured in an attempt to reverse the impending extinction of the human race. So far, however, Elidia is the world's one and only Manufactured human, so she's hardly the expendable clone most of the general and ignorant public believes her to be.

---
Clones Are People, Too Example in Video Games

-   **Advance Wars: Dual Strike** has Black Hole create clones of the Allied Nations' best COs to battle on their behalf, which are at first believed to effectively be robotic empty shells that mindlessly do their job and then vanish. Then they come face-to-face with the clone of Andy who reveals that he, and likely all the clones that have died thus far, were just Really Was Born Yesterday by questioning his existence and being happy to learn his original is a good person with friends... before also dying. Jake does NOT take this well.
-   **Afterimage**: Of the Renee clones seen in the game, only Red Renee is still following her purpose. The others want nothing to do with her. This is covered by some Echoes of the blue-haired Renee. As she defies the red-haired Renee from absorbing her soul, she even outright declares "Even if I WAS once part of that Renee, I'm no other than myself now... I'm not Renee, I am Avisia!"
-   In **AI: The Somnium Files - nirvanA Initiative** it's revealed that Mizuki's inexplicable superhuman strength is due to her being a genetically altered clone created as part of an unethical Super-Soldier project and that the masked woman who had appeared throughout the game is an older clone made from the same template. Never once is their personhood called into question and the two very quickly forge a sisterly relationship.
-   Played with in **BlazBlue**:
    -   The Murakumo Units are artificial robot clones of Saya (making this trope double over with Androids Are People, Too). On one hand, both Lambda-11 and Nu-13 have Machine Monotone voices and are clearly primarily driven by the directive of their programming. On the other hand, Noel Vermillion/Mu-12 speaks with a perfectly human voice and is driven almost entirely by her emotions, and when Nu-13 comes close to Ragna, she, too, switches to a human voice. A really, **really** disturbing one, sure, but a human voice none the less... On the receiving end, both Ragna and Jin are very clearly upset over the fact that their sister has become a clone template, but they still treat Noel as a separate individual. Ragna, in particular, who has set out on a mission to destroy the Murakumo Units, makes clear that though he feels he **has** to fight and destroy Nu-13 in the first game, it's not something he **wants** to do. While Makoto was friendly to Noel (though not at first) without knowing she's a Prime Field Device, all the truth of the affair does is shock her momentarily; learning Noel's true nature amidst a graveyard of her "predecessors" does nothing to how she sees the girl. Noel herself takes this position when dealing with Lambda, as she's starting to develop a personality and Noel treats her like a little sister (despite Lambda being the elder).
        -   It gets really complicated at the Finale; Noel/Mu-12 contains half of the soul of Ragna's and Jin's sister Saya. Big Bad Hades-Izanami contains the other half. And when Noel (with Ragna's help) forcibly absorbs Izanami she inherits all of Saya's soul, the clone basically **becoming** the original, though she still chooses to identify as Noel for convenience.
    -   The Kaka clan are clones of the legendary hero Jubei, albeit with a few generations of Clone Degeneration by the time the plot starts. Nobody treats them in a particular way on account of being clones. Jubei himself regards them as good friends, and his wife Nine and (biological) daughter Kokonoe have a degree of respect for them (in as much as they respect anyone).
-   In **Chaos;Head**, Shogun considers Takumi to be a real person, albeit one who was born differently.
-   **Dissidia Final Fantasy** has Chaos, Cosmos and the Warrior of Light whom all started life as Manikins, clones made of crystal ore that acts similar to organic life and grows as living creatures do. All three are treated normally as sentient beings. Though in the case of the warrior, neither he nor any of his fellow warriors know the truth. Whether or not they **can** do all the things normal lifeforms do. Eat, dream, reproduce, ect. isn't really delved into very deeply.
    -   It's later confirmed in **Dissidia 012** that perfect Manikins are in fact capable of doing all the things mentioned above, and are **real people**. Chaos started out as a small child that needed to eat and sleep in order to grow, he even commented on a dream he had once.
-   **Final Fantasy IX** has the Genomes, a group of people from another world that have virtually no personality or unique traits and they all act very similar to each other. After their homeworld gets destroyed, Zidane decides to take the Genomes with the party and leave them in the Black Mage Village for shelter since he's a Genome too and they are like siblings to him in a sense. The same is true of Big Bad Kuja, as an elder brother to all of them. The people in the village are the Black Mages, who are constructs/androids that are similar to the Genomes, but have slightly more personality. The Genomes and the Black Mages quickly, if awkwardly, get along and learn the many aspects of life itself.
-   In **First Encounter Assault Recon**, the Replica Soldiers are cloned, mass-produced Super Soldiers, but their individuality is not brought up much, as while they are each capable of emotions and semi-independent thought while carrying out their missions, they are ultimately treated as expendable weapons. However, in the situations where a Replica **does** start to show individuality, they are immediately targeted for summary execution before they can develop enough independence to actually rebel.
-   As it turns out, in **Honkai Impact 3rd**, Kiana Kaslana is actually a clone of the original character spliced with a Herrscher core, essentially making her a reincarnated Herrscher. When Einstein attempts to tell Himeko and Theresa this fact in order to confirm their resolves to rescue this person, both quickly reveal that not only did they know the whole time about it, they also don't care — she's always been just Kiana to them and nothing will stop them from trying to save her.
    -   This trope also applies to Theresa herself. Theresa is the result of an experiment where Otto Apocalypse spliced the genes of Kallen Kaslana, the strongest recorded Valkyrie (and his dead crush) with those of an exceptionally powerful Honkai Beast, and then mass-produced them in an attempt to create an army of powerful clones. Of all the clones, only Theresa displayed the same natural inclination to help other people heedless of the danger or consequences as Kallen, which led Otto to adopt her and raise her as his own granddaughter. He's consistently shown that he will treat everyone and anyone as expendable, **except** Theresa. Moreover, Theresa is on record for commenting that "I thought everyone already knew of my origins, or that I wasn't human", yet nobody seems to treat her any differently for it.
-   Aloy, the player character in **Horizon Zero Dawn** discovers she's a clone of a pre-Apocalypse Science Hero who essentially made the post-apocalyptic world possible to exist, named Elisabet Sobeck. Part of her character development in the sequel, **Horizon Forbidden West** is realizing that she's **not** Elisabet Sobeck, she is her own person and shouldn't be bound by what Elisabet would do in a given circumstance. Much of it is caused and mutually resolved by encountering Beta, another Sobeck clone whom is far meeker but more formally educated than she is, and they become more like a pair of twin sisters afterwards.
-   The Nobodies of **Kingdom Hearts** lore are essentially clones of regular people who've lost their hearts to darkness, leaving what's left behind to reanimate as an Empty Shell with their original memories intact. Due to the nature of their existence being mutually exclusive to their original selves, and being virtually identical to their original selves anyways, they’re treated as expendable. This never really becomes an issue, however, as defeating a Nobody returns them to their original selves complete with even their Nobody memories, and quite a lot of them want to return to their old selves.
    -   The main exceptions to the above are Roxas and Naminé, the Nobodies of Sora and Kairi respectively. Whereas other Nobodies are treated as continuations of their old lives because they have their memories, neither of them have the memories of their original selves thanks to their special circumstances (Sora’s extremely brief stint as a Heartless followed by an immediate restoration, and Kairi’s heart never actually falling to darkness but leaving her body anyway), and both were able to develop into their own individuals as a result, with their newly grown hearts lingering inside Sora and Kairi after they were recompleted. Part of Sora’s motivation in **Kingdom Hearts III** is trying to help Roxas get his life back as a separate person, as, despite Roxas’s pushback during their brief discussions across the series, Sora ultimately believes Roxas deserves to be his own being with the life he had created for himself. He succeeds at this, and Roxas has his own newly created body by the end of the game, allowing him to finally exist as his own person. In addition, a replica body is also left behind by one of the villains, allowing Naminé to inhabit it and also live her own life.
    -   Xion on the other hand is a more conventional clone, having been created deliberately in a lab as a replica made out of some of Sora's memories in order to provide Organization XIII with a backup in case something happens to Roxas, essentially making her a clone **of** a clone. Consequently she is viewed as expendable even by other Nobodies, but an integral part of her storyline involves her gaining her own identity and developing a bond with Roxas. Unfortunately, just as Roxas's existence endangers Sora, Xion's existence endangers Sora **and** Roxas and she chooses to commit Suicide by Cop in a final showdown with Roxas in order to save him. It's Xion's choice to die in this manner that ensures the downfall of the Organization later on and drives Roxas to further pursue his own quest for self-actualization while honoring her sacrifice, even if her existence as a living memory meant he and everyone else was unable to consciously remember her after said sacrifice. Just as with Roxas and Naminé, she's brought back to live her own life by **III**, having developed her own heart and also leading to her friends remembering her.
-   **Mass Effect 3**: If you play the Paragon path when you find out the villain in the **Citadel DLC** is an Evil Knockoff Clone of Shepard, Shepard takes this approach. Unfortunately it doesn't work, since Clone Angst, a severe Inferiority Superiority Complex and a case of I Just Want to Be Special causes the clone to be Driven to Suicide when abandoned by their one ally.
-   This is a major plot point in the **Metal Gear** series, especially in **Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots**. At the very end, Big Boss himself tells Snake that he respects him as a soldier, and is sure that Snake would've made very different decisions if placed in the same situations as him. This neatly summarizes the whole aesop of the series: your genes don't determine who you are, your **actions** do.
-   The Duplicants of **Oxygen Not Included** are gnome-like Artificial Humans, each with a unique personality and appearance. This one looks like someone's granny and is scared of holes. That one has the brain of a fencepost but is a Supreme Chef. All of them are excited when a research project completes or when the Printing Pod produces a New Friend.
-   In **Parasite Eve 2**, Aya Brea finds out that an evil cult has made a clone of her in order to take advantage of her powers. After rescuing the girl, she adopts her as a daughter/sister.
-   Played with in **Star Wars: The Force Unleashed** II, in which the player character is a stable clone of the protagonist of the first game that was created by Vader after Starkiller performed a Heroic Sacrifice to save the founding members of the Rebellion. Despite the existence of other clone Jedi in other areas of what was at the time Star Wars canon including the Dark Side ending to The Force Unleashed II itself, Starkiller's Jedi Mentor, Rahm Kota insists that Jedi can't be cloned and that Starkiller must be the original. This creates some Canon Discontinuity between TFUII and **Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron** as the player character from that game is a force sensitive clone, **who Rahm Kota trained as a Jedi prior to the events of this game** if the bandages over his eyes from the original Starkiller's lightsaber is anything to go on.
    -   What makes this situation worse is that Elite Squadron's X2 obviously isn't the typical run of the mill clone, but rather a clone of a Jedi named Falon Gray. Guess who Gray's master was.
-   Pandemic's **Star Wars Battle Front II** has the campaign narrated by a retired clone trooper who served with the 501st Legion all the way from the Battle of Geonosis to the Battle of Hoth. He displays a number of emotions as he recounts the battles fought, from regret during Order 66, rage immediately following the Battle of Yavin, and triumph at the Battle of Hoth.
-   **Star Wars: Republic Commando** puts the player in command of an elite squad of clone commandos, each with their own personalities:
    -   The Player Character is “Boss,” a no-nonsense, tough as nails soldier that is about as close as any republic soldier can be to Jango Fett
    -   “Fixer” is The Smart Guy on the team. He’s a by the book hacker that is often annoyed by the antics of his squad mates.
    -   “Sev” is a Cold Sniper that has adorned his armor in blood red markings, which one of the loading screens implies might actually be real blood.
    -   “Scorch” is the squad’s demolitions expert. He often gets into competitions with Sev over who can kill the most enemies, and is hit hard when the squad is ordered to evacuate from the final mission without Sev.
-   In **Tales of the Abyss**, this trope is a major part of the character arc of Luke once he realizes and accepts he's a replica of Asch. Eventually, this leads up to the climax where it's implied Luke either gave his own life to resurrect Asch, Asch did vice versa, or in some other way the two fused. The Stinger is tight-lipped as to which one can be seen at the end.
-   The now-defunct mobile game **Tekken Arena** uses this in its story mode as the entire aesop. The player character has been a clone of an existing Tekken character all along, and was to be sold as a soldier alongside other clones. They free a large number of clones from Dr. Bosconovitch to prove their point that clones are people, not products.
-   **Xenoblade Chronicles 2**: Pyra is technically Mythra's Literal Split Personality, created as a means to prevent people from accessing her full power, but nobody ever questions the fact that she's her own person, and the two are very different personality wise, which was a deliberate choice on Mythra's part to try and make Pyra a better person than she saw herself as. Mythra herself views Pyra as a sister that she happens to share a body with. By the epilogue, they get restored as separate entities.

Clones Are People, Too Example in Webcomics

-   Old McNinja from **The Adventures of Dr. McNinja**. When the McNinja family hesitates to rescue him, Doc argues that Old is just as much their son as he is, and when Old joins King Radical his right as a clone to make that decision is never brought up. Long story short, since he couldn't ever join back up with Doc, Old is officially his own person.
-   In **Bomango** by Rob Ten Pas, Gogo can reproduce by **budding,** having sprouted Didi out of her side (which she did on a caprice because she was bored one day). Didi is as sweet, gentle, and intellectual as Gogo is loud, brash, and dangerous. It's notable that, since they split, Didi's physique has become noticeably more slender than Gogo's muscular frame, because Gogo gets a lot more exercise. Didi also has no navel. Strong hints have been dropped that Gogo has other clones running around, and that they are not nice people at all. The names Gogo and Didi, btw, are a Shout-Out to **Waiting for Godot**.
-   **El Goonish Shive**:
    -   Ellen, Elliot's Opposite-Sex Clone, is quickly accepted by Elliot and his family and now lives as Elliot's twin sister. Due to her brief case of Clone Angst, she has also developed a distinct personality from the original. Taken a step further when while having an argument with him, Ellen demands to know why Tedd, who started the series of events that led to her creation, never apologized for it. Tedd's answer is epically heartwarming:
        
        **Tedd:** Yeah, I screwed up a lot, and maybe I could apologize for that, but if I hadn't, you wouldn't exist! I am **not** sorry that you exist! If you're the result of my mistakes, then they were the best mistakes I ever made!
        
    -   Another strip has Elliot later tell Ellen what he had been thinking when faced with the trouble caused by a magically-created opposite-sex clone of himself.
        
        **Elliot:** "She's family. Help her." Not that complicated.
        
-   **Harbourmaster**: In the **Pulp** story arc, a deceased 20th-century mountaineer is brought back to life. Or more accurately, a clone with almost all of the original's memories intact is created. While the Verans who requested the cloning just wanted the closest thing imaginable to an eyewitness of 20th-century Earth history, interplanetary law dictates that clones must be treated as distinct individuals in their own right. This came about from fears that artists would be cloned specifically to "continue" producing an oeuvre, or deceased loved ones in general cloned for Replacement Goldfish. In other words, the one who requested the cloning doesn't get to forcibly mould the clone's further life.
-   **Homestuck**:
    -   Davesprite, a biological combination of an alternate Dave from the future and a game sprite (and a crow). At first the characters, most notably John, treat him just as an alternate version of Dave, but as time goes on he grows to have more of his own say in the plot and ultimately separates from Dave to travel with John and Jade on the ship. In that time, the three grow close enough that after a year, John has just started calling him 'Dave'.
    -   Davesprite's situation is echoed in Act 6 with the autoresponder, a computer of humanoid intelligence who is a clone of Dirk's brain at the time he was made. Dirk, however, is very aware of this trope and always fully intended to let him live his own life apart from him.
        
        **TT:** You don't just make a clone of yourself to live in a dead end existence where it has no chance to thrive as an individual or surpass its limitations.  
        **TT:** That'd be sick.
        
-   Molly the Peanut Butter Monster in **The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!** has two clones with very different personalities who are both off living their own lives: occasionally megalomaniacal woobie Galatea (or "Golly") and the mountain-sized giantess, Djaliana ("Djali" or "Jolly").
-   In **It's Walky!**, Joyce has to face criminal charges after killing her duplicate.
-   **Kevin & Kell**: More like "clones are animals, too,", but Coney's clone Dolly/Mary is very much her own sheep, even more so after being turned into a baby — for one thing, she actually **likes** her mother's controlling tendencies.
-   In **Latchkey Kingdom**, Rose is just as much a main character as her original, Willa.
-   In **Melonpool,** Ralph's opposite-personality **nice** clone Ralphie has been a series regular since his introduction many years ago. Ralph also (until recently) had an evil clone named Fauntleroy.
    -   Averted when Roberta was cloned, as the machine had been **fixed** by then, so the two were completely indistinguishable (much to their own frustration). They were eventually fused back together.
-   In **Narbonic**, Helen B. Narbon is a clone of Helen Narbon, her mother. (The "B" stands for "Beta".) Helen B. keeps insisting that she is her own person, not like her genetic progenitor at all. She herself is rather cavalier about cloning people, especially Dave, who gets cloned at least twice: once because his current body had a nasty case of Death Ray, later to test the mad genius cure on. The second clone has some time to develop a personality, cut short when he's killed by Dave proper in the throes of madness. But his body gets reused to host Dave proper again.
-   **Schlock Mercenary**: Kevyn's time-clone is fully established as a separate person, the company even going on a rescue mission to retrieve him in one arc.
    -   Same applies to every other clone in the comic, including one case of a man cloned 950 million times, which basically turned him into his own ethnic group (or his own species, as he notes). Most of them go on to have surgery to look slightly different (or change gender).
    -   This starts getting weird when they develop the tech to combine cloned bodies with memory backups. They end up with "they're the same person in terms of anything before diverging, different for anything after"; the poor bastard who established the precedent learned that his original had received multiple death sentences for a crime committed before he was gate-cloned, and he was already out of appeals. Tagon especially has a hard time getting past seeing a memorial to the heroic sacrifice of a man who's effectively him with an extra 45 minutes he doesn't remember, and doesn't know if he can live up to his own example.
-   In **Team Rocket Roots**, Jessebelle is Jessie's clone, but she's still a person on her own.
-   **The World is Flat** depicts this here.

Clones Are People, Too Example in Web Videos

-   The central premise behind the sci-fi noir web series **Aidan 5**. People are cloned to make expendable copies, but their clones are in fact people too.
-   In **Yandere High School**, this is Taurtis' justification for trying to keep the clones of him that were made by Geode alive.

---
Clones Are People, Too Example in Western Animation

-   **Adventure Time**:
    -   Lemongrab's clone was specifically made to be a partner to the original Lemongrab. He and Lemongrab get along exceedingly well and clearly love each other. (They even start a family together. However, they do still bicker every once in a while.) Other people treat the second Lemongrab in the same manner that they treat the original. Princess Bubblegum treats both of them like her two annoying children — with clear impatience, but compassion.
    -   In "Another Five More Short Graybles", Lemongrab 2 ends up rebelling against the original and getting partially eaten for his trouble. From here on out, he becomes more independent, showing mercy toward their Lemon-children and encouraging Lemonhope to flee with Bubblegum before being devoured whole.
    -   Bizarre circumstances cause Grass Sword and Finn Sword to turn into a grass version of Finn, including with scrambled memories. After figuring out what's going on, Finn decides to help him adjust to new his existence. At first called "Grass Finn," the clone eventually decides to call himself Fern the Human.
-   **American Dad!**: In the episode "Steve and Snot's Test-Tubular Adventures", Steve and Snot use CIA technology to clone two random girls to take to prom. The cloned girls come out as babies, but have accelerated aging to the point where they are the appropriate age by prom night. The problem is that Steve and Snot end up developing paternal love for the clones and view them as daughters, even crying upon their deaths.
-   In the finale of **Amphibia**, Anne dies, but a "backup" is made that's exactly the same as immediately beforehand. Functionally, it's just as if they never died, though they can't rule out the possibility of an existential crisis.
-   **Batman: The Animated Series** crosses this trope with Just a Machine with the episode "His Silicon Soul". A robot replica of Batman, left behind by the defeat of the evil A.I. HARDAC in "Heart of Steel: Part 2", is accidentally reactivated and believes himself to be the original Batman. After he discovers what he truly is, he almost resurrects HARDAC, but when he believes that he killed the original Batman, his conscience resurfaces and he destroys HARDAC and himself. Batman surmises that his replica really did have a soul after all. This is an especially interesting example as the original robot clones did not have emotions or anything beyond a copy of the human original's memories, and were **not** examples of this trope.
-   **The Batman** has the episode "The Everywhere Man" exploring this. The villain of the show is the clone of an inventor who created a duplication device. Each clone starts as an identical copy of its original, until it gains self-awareness (and, for some reason, becomes increasingly worse than its original), and sometimes grows disgruntled with its creator. Clone n°1 deals with this by basically killing his clones once they're no longer useful to him or if they start rebelling. Some of the clones are okay with this, some of them... aren't.
-   In **Danny Phantom**, Danny treats his Opposite-Sex Clone Danielle (or Dani for short) as a family member of sorts, since she was the only clone that wasn't mindless, and she does a Heel–Face Turn when she realizes Vlad, her "father", only viewed her as a tool, and helps Danny escape. In her second appearance, not only is he determined to save her from her instability and keep from from melting into nothing, Danny was willing to WILLINGLY become the prisoner of a GHOST HUNTER to save her, though said hunter decides to let him go instead.
-   Cubert of **Futurama** is a clone of Professor Farnsworth. He's treated like his son and is good friends with Hermes' son Dwight. The only time being a clone seemed to affect his personal life was when it became apparent that he didn't technically have a birthday but this was remedied by celebrating the day the professor scraped the growth off his back he used to create him instead.
    -   Played With in one episode, when Farnsworth and Cubert are put on trial for over-clocking Bender. Fearing the jury wouldn't want to convict a child, Mom's lawyer moves to have Cubert excused from the verdict. Bender then points out that the Professor must now be acquitted as well on the grounds of double jeopardy, since Farnsworth and Cubert are "technically the same person", and "cannot be tried of the same crime twice." The Judge agrees, calling it a "brilliant legal shenanigan." It's doubtful such an argument would fly in real life.
-   In **Gargoyles**, Thailog is a clone of Goliath, and is treated as Goliath's son, rather than a copy. Unfortunately he was programmed with the values of Xanatos, and was raised by Sevarius (which pretty well eliminated any positive aspects of Xanatos's personality from Thailog), and ended up becoming an evil mastermind.
-   In the **Gravity Falls** episode "Double Dipper", Dipper clones himself in order to enact a plan to get close to Wendy. Him and the clones are quite friendly towards each other at first, even Paper Jam Dipper, with at least some of the clones still obviously acting like **people** even after turning against the original, and Dipper gets quite upset when Tyrone is killed, even turning out to still miss him over a season later. Oddly, the episode uses both this and Expendable Clone, since Dipper doesn't seem to have problems with destroying the clones besides Tyrone.
-   Rudy Connors from **Invincible (2021)** is a disabled, severely deformed super-genius who wanted to clone a new body and upload his mind into it, even though he knew full well that the Brain Uploading process would **copy** his consciousness and not transfer it. Before dying by his hand, the original wishes for the clone to live the life he always wanted.
-   In **My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic**'s third season episode "Too Many Pinkie Pies", Pinkie Pie creates clones from the mirror pool that cause trouble and are ultimately sent back to the mirror pool by Twilight and her friends. All, except for one, who escaped, and judging by a background appearance in "The Saddle Row Review", has been living a rather full life in Manehattan, and looks concerned when she notices the real Pinkie Pie sitting just a stall away.
-   Zigzagged with Hunter from **The Owl House**. Hunter is the latest in a long line of Grimwalker clones that were seen as completely expendable by Belos, who regarded their creation as his attempt to make a "better version" of his brother Caleb, the original. Hunter is still very much his own person however, as he slowly starts to break free of the Emperor's Coven's conditioning, makes friends with kids his age, and eventually runs away from the Coven altogether after he learns the truth about what he is. However, learning that he's a Grimwalker has sparked a massive identity crisis for him, as he practically begs Luz not to tell anyone, and calls himself "a copy of someone Belos made disappear."
-   In **ReBoot**, the copy of Enzo is **encouraged** to be a different person than the original Enzo. Given what happened to the original, this is a good idea.
    -   Bob's friends (including the copy of Enzo) attempt to cheer him up by citing this trope when he's led to believe that he's a copy of another Bob that shows up in Mainframe. Subverted when they find out that the other Bob is actually a trojan horse with stolen bits of Bob's code.
-   **Rick and Morty**:
    -   In "The ABCs of Beth", Rick gives Beth the option to leave the family and travel the universe to find herself while he makes a perfect clone of her to look after her family, or stay with them and live a life she finally knows she's chosen. The ending leaves it ambiguous what she decided and whether the version of her we see is the real deal or the clone; however, in the following season's "Star Mort: Rickturn of the Jerri", it's revealed that Beth asked Rick to decide whether she would stay and be in his life or leave. Unable to deal with such a choice, he made a clone, sent one of them to space (known as "Space Beth") and kept one on Earth, and hid from everyone, including himself, which one is the original and which is the clone. Thanks to Duplicate Divergence, they are their own, very different people, and both of them know that they **may** be the clone or **may** be the original, but decide that they don't really care. Rick still loves them both and considers both of them to be his daughter, and Summer and Morty likewise refer to both of them as "Mom".
    -   "Rickmurai Jack" confirms that many of the Mortys of the Citadel were cloned to create, essentially, a mass Morty-market for the Ricks of the multiverse, since Mortys die so often and Ricks need replacements frequently. While the Ricks of the Citadel treat them as Expendable Clones, this attitude is quite clearly portrayed as a horrible Moral Event Horizon to the audience and the main protagonist Morty, who understand that all of these Mortys, clones or originals, are real people with feelings who don't deserve to be alive just for the purpose of serving Rick.
-   In **Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase**, the gang treats the video game versions of themselves as real people, not just computer data.
-   In the **SpongeBob SquarePants** episode "Copybob Dittopants", SpongeBob gets along with all of his clones, and is extremely upset when they fade away.
-   Hordak in **She-Ra and the Princesses of Power.** A clone of Horde Prime and but one of many, his separation from the hive mind enables him to experiment with individuality, though he still maintains a blind devotion to his progenitor. It takes being treated with kindness for him to realize he can be whoever he wants to be.
    -   He's not the only one: "Wrong Hordak" has the same origins, being one of many perfectly obedient, identical, and slavishly loyal clones, until the heroes accidentally disconnect him from the hive mind. Separated from Horde Prime, Wrong Hordak turns out to be an innocent Blank Slate motivated by a desperate eagerness to please his progenitor, and when his loyalty fails to survive a Broken Pedestal moment, Wrong Hordak similarly starts becoming his own individual (first by enthusiastically committing himself to Horde Prime's downfall).
-   In **Star Trek: Lower Decks** we have William Boimler, Bradward Boimler’s transporter clone. They’re just a little disappointed in what had happened and the only reason both Boimlers don’t work on the **Titan** together is because Starfleet has rules. That being said, Captain Riker and Brad’s old crew mates are happy to have him around after he leaves. When William is supposedly killed in a freak gas leak accident, Brad suffers a major Heroic BSoD and Commander Ransom convinces Beckett Mariner to help Brad.
-   **Star Wars: The Clone Wars** liked to explore this angle (in contrast with the theatrical **Star Wars** prequels, which depicted clones other than Boba Fett as expendable):
    -   In "Ambush", the first aired episode after the Pilot Movie, despite the fact that the clones were created as Expendable Clones, Yoda takes this attitude, telling the clones with him, "Smaller in number are we, but larger in mind." The clone troopers themselves naturally take this attitude, seeing each other as brothers, and over any period of time tend to start differentiating themselves with varying hairstyles, facial hair, and tattoos in addition to customizing and marking their armor.
    -   Other episodes have looked into this as well — Captain Rex and Commander Cody are treated as unique characters with different personalities, one deserter has a life outside the war, yet another betrayed the Republic out of resentment towards the clones' status, and so on.
    -   "Rising Malevolence" has a the surviving clones tell Plo Koon that he shouldn't bother saving them after their cruiser is destroyed, and should focus on saving himself since they're expendable and he's not. Plo vehemently disagrees.
    -   One time saw Rex telling off General Krell about treating his men as expendable and that not only did he have a duty to follow orders, but also to see them through. Unfortunately, Krell had different reasons for wanting so many clones dead...
        
        "Sir, if I may address your accusation, I followed your orders. Even in the face of a plan, that was, in my opinion, **severely** flawed. A plan that cost us men. Not clones! **Men!** As sure as it is my duty to remain loyal to your command, I also have another duty. To protect those men."
        
    -   "Fugitive" has a scene where Fives has a variation of this discussion with a droid, someone who is actually less of a person.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> Interestingly enough, part of his own affirmation of this trope two seasons before was "We are not a bunch of unthinking **droids!**"
    -   The finale of Season 7 highlights how much Palpatine **doesn't** share this viewpoint: thanks to having seven seasons humanizing them, Order 66 visibly shows the clones become almost robotic soldiers, erasing their personalities to enact the Emperor's will and gunning down their friends if they were Jedi or are suspected of corroborating with them. Ahsoka and, eventually, Rex, struggle with this, as they still view them as people who are clearly not themselves.
-   And then **Star Wars: The Bad Batch** takes it even further:
    -   The members of Clone Force 99 (aka the titular "Bad Batch") are the most prominent examples, even more divergent in appearances and personalities from the other clones. They're also among the few clones who aren't affected by Order 66.
    -   The show in general explores the fate of the Clones in the wake of Order 66: Officers view them as expendable or otherwise sub-human, there is constant pressure to replace them with a conscripted army, and one episode makes it very clear that the Empire has **zero** retirement plan for them, drawing parallels to real-world military veterans. Much of this is to illustrate outcomes seen in later-set works such as the original trilogy and **Obi-Wan Kenobi**, and all examples are played for sympathy.
-   **Star Wars Rebels**: By the time we see the clones again, Rex, Gregor, and Wolffe (pictured above) are even more individuated both in temperament and appearance.
-   This is explored in an episode of the second season of **W.I.T.C.H.** when Will creates an Astral Drop, who are normally little more than mindless drones used by the Guardians to take their places in school while they're saving the world, but the Big Bad turns the Astral Drop into a truly sentient Altermere and tries to turn her against Will. Unfortunately, Altermere Will ends up performing a Heroic Sacrifice to shield Will, though Will absorbs her memories as she lays dying.
    -   The Altermere later created of the girls' Mentor Yan Lin ends up more happily, surviving and being introduced to her family as her "long-lost twin sister Mira".
-   Roy Harper aka Speedy, later going by Red Arrow, of **Young Justice (2010)**, who even after finding out he's a clone eventually goes on to get married and have a kid. The original Roy/Speedy (when he is finally located) has no problem with the clone - mainly because said clone didn't ask to be created and eventually ended up being the one to find him when everyone else wrote him off as dead - though he is furious that his mentor Green Arrow failed to notice the switch. By Season 3, the original and the clone, and the second clone, regard each other as effectively triplet brothers and run Bowhunter Security together, with separate names (the first clone uses Roy's middle name, Will, while the second was always called Jim). Amusingly, thanks to his time on ice, the original is now biologically the youngest, while the second clone is biologically the oldest of the three since his supposed identity was as Speedy's "uncle", his late dad's non-existent younger brother, but he was created **after** the first clone. Biologically, they're 20, 28 and 34 as of 2020.
    -   Superboy counts here too, who while still incorporating elements of Superman, Lex Luthor, and his initial Clone Angst, has gone on to develop his own personality and live his own life.
    -   The clone of Prince Orm/Ocean-Master in Season 4 is set free after being discovered to be a clone, since he can't be held responsible for the crimes of the original and he only attacked Atlantis under the influence of Fake Memories.
