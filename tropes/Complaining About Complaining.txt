Complaining About Complaining: 
...Hey!!!

**McKenzie:** And now you're complaining about me complaining!  
**Griffin:** You just complained about me complaining about you complaining.

After hearing Bob complain for so long, Alice will begin to complain about his complaining.

Complaining about complaining is an interesting phenomenon that happens when one group becomes fed up with the complaints of another group and begin to gripe about the latter griping. While it tends to be used mainly for humorous purposes because of the cycle, it may also show the cycle that comes with it while also showing how the characters react in certain situations. Everyone has limits to what they can tolerate and hearing someone complain about something so long can cause them to complain.

This of course can be played more seriously if the complaints are legitimately something the audience and or most characters would be concerned about, only to be shut down by the other party. This could showcase declining relations or growing apathy.

Complaining About Complaining Example in Comic Strips

-   **Calvin and Hobbes**:
    -   Calvin complains about people who can't let one of their pet peeves go... in a rant that lasts for three whole panels
    -   In another strip, Calvin complains about his grandfather's complaints that the art in newspaper comics isn't what it used to be and has been reduced to "a bunch of Xeroxed talking heads"... in a strip that is exactly that. (It stands out because the art in **Calvin and Hobbes**, even in the black-and-white, limited-space weekday strips, is always lush and unique. In the color Sunday strips it's downright painterly and genre-busting.)
