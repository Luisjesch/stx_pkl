Bookends: 
Beginning and end, volume 6. The game of musical apartments continues.

Matching scenes at the beginning and end of a story, often to show how things have changed through the course of the series, or that they haven't changed at all.

This is extensively used in kids' shows to illustrate the characters applying the lesson they learned today, which happens to apply to the issue presented in the beginning. Ya'know, just in case they didn't catch it. In any work, bookends are a way to show if Character Development has occurred.

Compare and contrast Here We Go Again!, How We Got Here, Where It All Began. See also Call-Back, Ironic Echo. Often utilized in an And the Adventure Continues ending, with the last scene of the series mimicking the first, regardless of how long it's been running. In music, this is often a component of Album Closure. See Mirror Character for a similar concept applied to characters. Died on Their Birthday implicitly bookends a character's life on the same calendar date.

## As this is an Ending Trope, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.

-   The Montana Meth Project has some chilling public service announcements with these two having the bookends.
    -   The first video shows a girl trying meth with her friends, saying she's only going to do it once. Cut to the next scene, where she uses meth again, still saying it's only once more. This was repeated a few more times, with the girl getting worse by the use of meth. At the end, the girl is shown unconscious on her bed, her fate ambiguous. Her younger sister then takes some meth from her older sister's jean pocket, saying she's only going to do it once.
    -   The next video shows a young man trying meth, also saying that he'll only do it once, as he doesn't want to be like "that guy", a meth-addicted psycho, which scarily resembles him. He then tries meth once again, also with the same promise. Repeat a few times with the man getting more addicted, and he ends up being exactly like "that guy". In the end, a young girl buys some meth with the promise of only trying it once, as she doesn't want to be like "that guy". Which is obviously the guy before.
-   An Australian alcohol awareness advertisement opened with a father asking his son to get him a beer at a party, followed the son's descent into alcoholism, then ended with the son as an adult, asking **his** son to get him a beer at a party, with the implication that his son's life would follow the same course as his own.

Bookends Example in Myths & Religion

-   Older Than Dirt: **The Epic of Gilgamesh** starts with a narration that extols the might of the walls of Uruk, which seem to be meant to emphasize the glory of their builder, the king Gilgamesh. Until, of course, Gilgamesh fails to gain eternal life, and in the final line of the epic, he speaks the same passage to his new traveling companion Urshanabi. (Scholarly opinion is divided whether this is intended as Ironic Echo, or an affirmation that true immortality is found in lasting greatness of a man's works.)
-   In the Gospel of Mark, when Jesus is baptized, the heavens split in half and God announces that Jesus is His son.

Bookends Example in Poetry

-   "The Cremation of Sam McGee" by Robert Service both begins and ends with the same stanza, referring to the queerest sight ever seen by the Northern Lights (namely the eponymous cremation). The poem in between these stanzas describes the events of Sam's death, his subsequent cremation, and what the narrator saw when he looked into Sam's funeral pyre. He saw Sam sitting up "looking cool, and calm", happy to be warm for the first time since leaving his home in Tennessee.
    
    **There are strange things done in the midnight sun by the men that toil for gold  
    The Arctic trails have their secret tales that would make your blood run cold  
    The Northern Lights have seen queer sights, but the queerest they ever did see  
    Was that night on the marge of Lake Labarge that I cremated Sam McGee**
    
-   Jabberwocky (largely nonsense):
    
    **'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
    Did gyre and gimble in the wabe,  
    All mimsy were the borogroves,  
    And the mome raths outgrabe.**
    
-   Rudyard Kipling's Ballad of East and West starts with
    
    **East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet  
    'Till earth and sky stand presently at God's great judgement seat  
    But there is neither east nor west, border nor breed nor birth  
    When two strong men stand face to face, though they come from the ends of the earth.**
    

And the poem ends with The Hero giving a speech as to exactly why Defeat Equals Friendship, using the same lines.

-   The poetic device called a chiasmus is this trope defined.

Bookends Example in Roleplay

Notably, both teams also ended their droughts by sweeping their opponents in the World Series.
-   The New England Patriots' 2003 season has an interesting take on this. They began their regular season with a 31-0 loss at the Buffalo Bills. When the Patriots faced the Bills again at home in Week 17, they **won** by the same 31-0 score. They would go on to win their second Super Bowl that year.
    -   Similarly, the following year, their 2004 season, as champions, they hosted the Kickoff Game and beat the Indianapolis Colts by three points with a score of 27-24. Then come the Super Bowl, they defend their title by defeating the Philadelphia Eagles 24-21, another three point game.

    -   The 2014 Green Bay Packers. Their season began by losing the Kickoff Game to the defending Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks at CenturyLink Field.

-   During the 108 years of heartbreak the Cubs endured, seasons would end in two ways. Being obliterated out of the Playoffs (2007, 2008, 2015) or being very close only to choke in the end (1969, 1984, 2003). What better way to end the century of heartbreak by being on the other side of the table, the team that many people count out after being down 3-1 in the World Series against the Indians, only for the Cubs to come all the way back to win the Series.
-   The 1994 FIFA World Cup began with a missed penalty kick in the opening ceremony by Diana Ross, and ended with a missed penalty kick in the penalty shootout in the final by Roberto Baggio, which won Brazil the World Cup.
-   Somewhat inverted with Manchester United and Adidas: When the sportswear manufacturer's initial stint with the club came to an end in 1992, their final away kit had a rather unorthodox 'M' pattern all over the shirt. When Adidas returned as United's kit manufacturer in 2015, that 'M' pattern featured on the trim on the home shirt and across the chest of the third shirt.
-   Similarly inverted with Brighton. Their final match at the Goldstone Ground, their home for nearly a century, came against Doncaster Rovers in 1997.

His final game before retiring was a 5-4 win over the Oakland Athletics in 2019.

-   In the 1990-91 NFL playoffs, the Cincinnati Bengals defeated the Houston Oilers in the Wild Card Round before losing to the Los Angeles Raiders in the Divisional Round, leading to a 30+ year playoff win drought for the Bengals. In the decades that followed, the Oilers relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, and became the Tennessee Titans, and the Raiders returned to their previous home city of Oakland, California, before relocating to Las Vegas, Nevada, and becoming the Las Vegas Raiders. In the 2021-22 playoffs, the Bengals ended their drought by defeating the Raiders in the Wild Card Round and the Titans in the Divisional Round, and also winning the AFC Championship Game against the Kansas City Chiefs, reaching the Super Bowl for the first time in 33 years, only to lose to another team, the Los Angeles Rams, there, thus keeping the Bengals waiting for their first Lombardi Trophy until the Bengals do win their first Super Bowl title.

-   Many **World Of Darkness** sourcebooks both old and new begin and end with information related to a specific event. **Mage: The Awakening** has a diary in the front from a student, and ends with a letter from the mage who's teaching said student to that mage's **last** student, who went bad and was responsible for Awakening the student writing the diary. **Promethean: The Created** has the first and second halves of Mr Verney's interview with a psychiatrist.

Bookends Example in Theatre

-   **A Very Potter Musical** opens with the song "Gotta Get Back to Hogwarts" and **A Very Potter Sequel** ends with a reprise of the same song. The sequel is actually a prequel, so when they're singing "Gotta Get Back to Hogwarts," it's like putting the two ends right in the middle.
