Action Pet: 
Streaky gives evildoers claws for concern.

_"In December 1941, the Japanese found that attacking a unit under the cover of night is only a good idea when the enemy doesn't happen to have a giant black hellhound guarding their camp. Gander noticed the impending sneak attack, decided to drop the silly puppy act and switched his Hound of the Baskervilles knob up to 11. And that's when things got fucking metal."_

When a pet can be just as much of an action character as any person.

Even in Real Life, pets aren't always harmless. They can be dangerous (say if people take in attack dogs or rescue dogs with behavioural problems as pets), or helpful. **But this takes that even further,** where the pet is fed on a diet of Rule of Cool.

These pets don't stop at going for help when people are trapped behind a landslide. They push boulders out of the way, fetch dynamite to toss at those rocks, or even just will the rocks to move by staring them down.

And the kind of pet doesn't matter. A parakeet, to an alligator, could count, as long as it does stuff that even amazes people that know what the species can do.

A Sub-Trope of Action Hero and Amplified Animal Aptitude.

Can overlap with Badass Adorable, Killer Rabbit, Living a Double Life (if the owner is not aware of the pet's action nature), Heroic Pet Story, Heroic Dog, Mon, Team Pet and Animal Superheroes.

-   In **The Fledgling Year**, Aravis’ belligerent horse Inga takes out her fair share of bad guys.
-   In **Imaginary Seas**, Percy is able to call upon the mounts he used in life due to being summoned as a Rider. So far, he's only used Mrs. O'Leary's aid to Shadow Travel between islands. And while she's a hellhound the size of a tank who is more than capable of taking care of herself, Percy would much rather keep her hidden and safe because of the danger the Lostbelt Servants pose as well as how necessary she is to escape the wrath of Artemis and Zeus.
-   In **Locked In Digital**, Koda ends up getting a lot of Animal Companions that he uses for hero-stuff.
    -   Kuro, the first and a hawk who joins Koda because the bird is interested in Izuku, can be used for scouting and tracking.
    -   Two more hawks, Spar and Corras, end up joining Kuro.
    -   A snake named Seras also agrees to help Koda in heroing.
-   Downplayed in **Manehattan's Lone Guardian** with Echo, Gray Ghost's pet Mane Coon cat.

    -   Played with in **Cheesecake**'s case. He starts out as a lazy, disobedient and overweight puppy in a monster's body, but during the course of **Indokani** starts acting more like his own species, becoming aggressive and protective of Purple.

Action Pet Example in Films — Live-Action

-   In **The Cameraman**, Buster's monkey jumps on a Tong thug that is about to jump Buster, saving Buster's life. Then the monkey starts cranking Buster's movie camera when Buster saves Sally, proving Harold's cowardice (he swam away and abandoned Sally) and Buster's heroism.

Action Pet Example in Literature

-   In **The Dinosaur Lords**, Karyl's pet dino Shiraa is infamous for her war toll, a capable predator and able to cross half the continent to get to her master. At some point, she even considers eating her pursuers, and doesn't only because she knows Karyl wouldn't approve. Oh, and she's a freakin' **Allosaurus**.
-   **The Dresden Files**: Harry acquires a very large dog named Mouse which is really a Foo Dog. Said dog is explicitly smarter than a human, VERY resistant to damage, has a bark that can instantly wake everyone in an apartment building during an emergency, and innately detects evil.
-   In **Heralds of Valdemar** there are various Uplifted Animals but as many of them aren't just amplified but outright **people** they probably don't count. Still, the Tayledras have bred birds of prey and corvids into larger, more intelligent Bond Creatures that help them in fights as well as ferrying messages and bringing them food. The Tayledras' cousins the Shin'a'in breed and train the coolest horses around, which can be trained to extraordinary feats and trusted to solve problems. Their battlesteeds in particular are barely horses anymore and can be tasked with finding water, protecting supplies or people, and can fight on their own. Battlesteeds still can't hold a candle to Companions, but Companions only **look** like horses - they're not uplifted, it's an Open Secret that they're the Reincarnations of humans.
-   **The Legend of Drizzt**: The hero, a dark elf named Drizzt Do'Urden, has a sidekick named Guenhwyvar, a black panther summoned with a magical figurine. He refers to her as his soulmate in the platonic sense several times, she has saved his life on several occasions. When he first met her she was bound to a far less noble dark elf master who abused her, she eventually willed herself free and instead joined Drizzt.
-   In **River of Teeth**, all the riding hippos of Houndstooth's gang are action pets, but his own Ruby — a particularly well-bred Cambridge Black — is absolutely deadly and practically invisible in the marshlands and always ready for a fight.
-   In **A Song of Ice and Fire**, the Stark children each adopt one of a litter of orphaned direwolf pups. So far they've saved their owners' lives on numerous occasions.
-   **Tortall Universe**
    -   Starting with Faithful in **Song of the Lioness**, a divine entity in cat form who accompanies Alanna on her quest and advises and keeps her company. He throws himself into several battles alongside the knight, though as he's housecat-shaped he's more of a distraction than anything and is killed, or returned to the Divine Realms anyway, when an enemy noblewoman throws him to the ground and **stamps** on him.
    -   Kel's pets in **Protector of the Small**, largely due to the presence of Daine at the Palace. The animals Kel adopts — a flock of sparrows, an ornery horse, and a mutt named Jump — are intelligent enough to act as scouts and fellow combatants in battle. This is deconstructed in the last book of her quartet, however, when Kel is managing a refugee camp and Daine reluctantly imbues them all with human-like intellect. Several of them die in the battles that ensue because they overrode their own instincts to flee in order to try to defend the refugees, and Kel finds herself agreeing that it's no favor to the animals.
    -   **Beka Cooper** has Faithful again, this time under the name of Pounce, taking an active part in police work. Compared to how he helped Alanna, Pounce is a far more openly supernatural entity, frequently using magic to help her and fighting with more physical ability. Beka also gets a scent hound named Achoo in the second book. While she's not a fighting dog, she does go with Beka into some dangerous places and takes on a couple of thugs who try to do her in. Achoo is killed in the third book, but Pounce brings her back from the dead. This finally counts as too much meddling, and the gods - who want a **lighter** touch such as he uses helping Alanna a couple hundred years later - call him back to the Divine Realms.

Action Pet Example in Video Games

-   **Arcanum: Of Steamworks & Magick Obscura**: Given that Arcanum had members who made the first Fallout game, it's not surprising that there's a Lightning Bruiser dog who can join you. Dog (Worhless Mutt) is basically Dogmeat, but cranked up into a near Gamebreaker as his teeth tear through anything. Creatures such as Ore Golems and whatnot that would easily blunt a sword, can take about 2 hits from Dog before dying.
-   **Battle Princess Madelyn** features Fritzy, the ghost of your beloved pet dog, who uses his newfound ghostly powers to fight enemies at your side.
-   **Dark Souls**: Great Grey Wolf Sif could be considered this, as he was the companion of Sir Artorias before his death. He also fought alongside his master and when you face him, he wields Artorias' Greatsword with his mouth.
-   **Diablo 3**: the Demon Hunter has some similarities to a Dungeons & Dragons ranger. Likewise they also can have animal companions such as giant spiders and wolves. With the right build, the Demon Hunter can have a small army of companions to overwhelm any foe.
-   The dog companions in the **Fallout** series (Dogmeat in **Fallout** and **Fallout 2** (special event), K-9 and Robodog in **Fallout 2**, the other Dogmeat in **Fallout 3**, Rex in **Fallout: New Vegas**, and another Dogmeat in **Fallout 4**).
-   The Fangs for Hire in **Far Cry 5** qualify as these. Boomer the Australian cattle dog teams up with the Deputy after the Project at Eden's Gate killed his owners, and basically considers the Deputy family. Peaches the mountain lion was raised by Wilhelmina Mable, a foul-tempered old lady, but is still pretty vicious, as the cultists you set her on can attest. Cheeseburger the bear is technically a zoo animal, not a pet, but he's partially domesticated — which you can't do with real-life bears.
-   In the **Fate** series of RPGs, the player has a pet that fights and levels up alongside you, and you can transform it from a cat to a werewolf, wyvern, or other such creature to improve its ability to fight your enemies.

Badass enough to take down two formidable mechanical praying mantises and later humiliate Mizar in a Final Boss Preview. And the planet whose population almost borders on extinction due to Mizar's attempt to reroute meteors for an apocalyptic impact (Gem Quarry)? He saves it. The **only** thing the poor animal can't do is find a blue key.
-   In **Juicy Realm** from SpaceCan Games and X.D. Network, your characters can buy or find various pets that will either attack an enemy or stop incoming "bullets" depending on their type. If you're lucky enough you could have a small army of them by the time you go after the final boss (or else you could be so unlucky that you're all alone to the end).
-   In **The Last Guardian**, the main character needs the help of a griffin-like beast named Trico in not only traversing a gigantic complex of ruins, but also for protection.
-   **Little Red Hood**: The white dog Little Red Hood can find, which will attack enemies for her.
-   **Lufia: The Legend Returns**: Mousse is the Team Pet for Wain's party, but is just as capable of killing monsters as the rest of them, especially if it uses Double Mousse Punch or Tail Illusion.
-   Koromaru in **Persona 3** is a dog who fought off a shadow with his bare teeth and joined SEES to continue the fight, now armed with a knife in his mouth and a super-powered incarnation of his inner psyche. He even saves the entire rest of the team from Shuji Ikutsuki.
    -   Before Koromaru was Pascal from **Shin Megami Tensei I**. Pascal is the hero's pet husky who witnessed the murder of the hero's mother, and tags along with the party. He can fuse with a demon to become a Cerberus that is most likely thirty levels above the hero, and is one of very few demons to be controllable at a higher level than the hero. He even joins the party after the thirty year timeskip, no questions asked. Koromaru's Persona is also named Cerberus as a callback.
-   **Pokémon** is about making creatures into action pets through defeating wild ones.
-   Poppy, Galford's dog in **Samurai Shodown**, does many of his moves, including some of the **super** moves.
-   Repede from **Tales of Vesperia** is Yuri's pet wolf. And he's also a full-fledged member of the party, able to attack, cast spells, use items, and even has his own Mystic Arte. He even fights with a dagger in his mouth.
-   **Torchlight** had a few animal companions who could not only help you fight but they'd also help you sell off unwanted items. This was a useful feature when your character was deep underground and can't easily access a store.
-   **World of Warcraft** has several ways for players to summon various creatures to fight alongside them, but the most notable is the Hunter class, whose main gimmick is entirely built around taming wild animals for that exact purpose, and even moreso with the Beast Mastery specialization.
