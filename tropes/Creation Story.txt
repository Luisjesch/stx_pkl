Creation Story: 
A God or similar creates a world or similar. Unlike a Creation Myth, the creation is part of the actual story, not just its background.

In fantasy and mythology, this is sometimes the first chapter of the story, starting from the _very_ beginning. Other times, it happens as a significant plot point in the middle of the story or as its end.

Creation Story Example in  Fan Works

-   **Elementals of Harmony**: Two chapters in **Sideboard of Harmony**, "How Pinkie Got Her Cutie Mark" and "Fiat Harmonia", focus on how Pinkie created Equestria’s plane, Ungula, to fulfill a Stable Time Loop and ensure her own existence. Entropy was incarnated in Discord to prevent Ungula from being destroyed by uncontrolled entropy like other Planeswalker-made planes usually are, with Faust coming into being as incarnate order due to Ungula’s nature seeking balance. Eventually, Faust made a pink sun to have something to look at besides empty void, a moon to balance it, and a planet to have somewhere to rest on, with Discord accidentally popping the sun and moon, hatching Celestia and Luna and creating the actual Sun and Moon. They then go on to create the landscape, life and ponies. In doing so, Faust overexerts herself, going into hibernation and transforming into the Elements, causing Discord to grow more and more mentally unbalanced and leading into canon history.
-   **The God Empress of Ponykind**: The early chapters of the story focus on the Emperor/Celestia, stranded on a barren, molten world, using her powers and science to terraform it and seed it with increasingly complex life over millions of years, before creating Luna and eventually ponykind.
-   **The Many Secret Origins of Scootaloo**: Tydal’s chapter focuses on a retelling of how the Creator made the world, from her perspective. Apparently, it was more like a young child making a playmat and toys to play with than anything, later moving on to hobby-like customizing as a "teen". The gods such as Tydal, Discord and the Princesses were made when she decided she wanted "Top Toys" to oversee the rest.
-   The **Pony POV Series**:
    -   It's explained on a few occasions, but the basic story is that the Four Elders and their children (the Alicorns and Draconequi) crafted the universe, with the Alicorns setting up the Big Bang and it being implied Destruction set it off. Celestia was annoyed it'd take a long time for life to evolve. The individual deities apparently created various species at some point after that. This is also a circular process that has happened over and over: the universe lives out its lifespan, beings in it moving on to their afterlives, until finally Heat Death happens, at which point Entropy devours the dead universe to make room for a new one, which the Elders take the time between to set up the foundations for the next universe.
    -   "The Rise of Tirek", Tirek's Origin Story, is basically this for the world as ponies know it, as Tirek destroyed the Centaur civilization and drove them to extinction, after which the ponies were uplifted by the Rainbows of Light and Darkness, leading to the present civilization.
-   **Eternal (MLP)**: Before time itself, ten mystical proto-ponies were created to help bring the universe into balance. These unicorn-like beings created several pony races in their image, however they didn't make unicorns because they felt superior to their creations. Later on, the firstborn created the stars and brought light to the universe.

Creation Story Example in Live-Action TV

-   **Lucifer (2016)**: Lucifer tells his therapist how the universe was created, couched in terms she'll understand. Apparently the actual Big Bang was caused by God and Lucifer's mother having sex ("You never knew how appropriate that term was, did you?"), and then they built a house called Heaven and filled it with their children, the angels. Then their father started spending all his time in the garage working on a project called "humanity," while their mother became cold and emotionally distant. Lucifer got in an argument with his father and got kicked out of the house, and then a few thousand years later his mother got thrown out as well.
