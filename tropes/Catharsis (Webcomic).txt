Characters:

-   Rremly, a dragon over 300 years old (a runt) who is visible as such only to people who believe in dragons.
-   Gwen, the young woman who owns the apartment, and can sometimes alternate to a younger form named Tennibrook (inner child manifestation. Not admittedly magical; may be entirely imagined).
-   Baxter: A sardonic, now bald squirrel. Has a bit of a love affair with Gwen's old SNES.
-   Bitey: One of three dust-bunny baby translators that now live in the apartment, coming from the land under the chair; loves to bite Baxter. Other two rarely mentioned.
-   Aja: Gwen's kitten. Claims to be a ninja.

## Tropes:

-   Author Avatar
-   Filler: Heartbreakingly massive amounts of it.
-   I Call It "Vera": The SNES, Vanessa.
-   Intellectual Animal: Baxter
-   A Dog To Normals: Rremly appears as a dog to people who don't believe in dragons, even when this would strain credulity like when he's flying (he appears as a flying dog).
-   Jerk with a Heart of Gold: Despite his prickly demeanor, Baxter can be quite nice.
-   Our Dragons Are Different: In a subversion, dragons are usually giant flying, firebreathing monsters that sit on hoards of gold and are generally quite nasty. Rremly being a runt, is a bit bigger than a dog, can't really breathe fire, has a sock hoard and is extremely nice.
-   Prefers Going Barefoot: Tennibrook. In fact, "walking around barefoot" was actually listed as one of her likes on her profile page.
-   Shared Universe: Gwen's apartment is in the same building as the main cast of **Neko The Kitty**. Aya is Neko's daughter.
-   Translator Microbes: The baby dust bunnies. Gwen does a Lampshade Hanging by mentioning fish instead.
-   Weirdness Censor: The reason Rremly is seen as a dog to nonbelievers.
