Crashing Through the Harem: 
For whatever reason, our young male protagonist is in the middle of a chase scene or bar brawl and crashes straight into a room full of beautiful young women. Depending on the setting, this could be an _Arabian Nights_\-style harem, a bordello, or a girls' locker room, but it will be a private place containing several young women, usually in some state of undress. Expect there to be lots of silk curtains and maybe a bath or shower. They may act offended (going so far as to go after the young male protagonist for intruding or just scream at him and throw stuff) or they may giggle and even flirt with the hero... until their dour chaperone shoves him back into the fray.

Sometimes, the young male protagonist may hide out in the harem, bordello, or girls' locker/shower room in order to escape whoever's chasing him, often dressed in drag, posing as a chaperone/eunuch/locker room guard. They may elude their pursuers by disappearing into a locker, curtained-off room, or in a vent. If the hero is lucky, one (or more) of the women may decide to hide him, which could lead to romantic opportunities...

May overlap with Distracted by the Sexy, Accidental Pervert or both. Can lead to a Crash-Into Hello. For when it's only one girl in a state of undress, see Naked First Impression. May also overlap with Naked People Are Funny and Moment Killer.

-   In **Cesare - Il Creatore che ha distrutto**, when the titular Cesare Borgia, 16, borrows clothes from his commoner friend Angelo and sneaks off to the local festival with him in that disguise, they end up making someone angry, and in running away, they duck into a curtained-off area that turns out to be the dancers' changing room. This is carried over into the musical, even though the chase aspect isn't.
-   In a **One Piece** filler episode set in ancient Japan, Zoro (a wandering monk) at one point crashes into a room full of women. One of them kicks him out of there.

When Groo is first led to the harem full of beautiful naked women, he is overjoyed, saying it's a dream come true to run amok in a place like this - and then helps himself to all the cheese dip he can eat. It then turns out that Groo, despite being as fat and grotesque as ever while dressed like a woman, drives the king mad with lust, and being invited to the private chambers provides Groo a chance to swipe the ruby. In his escape, Groo races back through the harem, leaving the women screaming and diving into the pool in his wake.
-   In the graphic novel **Hooky**, Spindrifter saves a falling Spider-Man by opening a portal beneath him that opens into one of these. As per his luck and overdeveloped sense of responsibility, he (reluctantly) extracts himself from the amorous women "before (he) really start to enjoy it."

-   **Spider-Man**: A more realistic example of this Trope occurs in on of one of Todd McFarlane's filler issues of **The Amazing Spider-Man** (notable for its cover, a Homage to **Action Comics #1**) One of Spidey's less formidable villains, Buck Mitty, aka the Humbug, plans to rob an art display on the ESU campus, only to take a wrong turn and bust into the girls' locker room, enacting screams and things thrown at him from the female students, who assume he's some drunk fratboy. As he runs away, Mitty concedes that he never **was** very familiar with the campus layout, other than the science department, and decides to stick to them when he tries again later. (Unfortunately for him, he messes that up too.)
-   In the first issue of the 1996 series of **Teen Titans**, Cody sneaks into the Cheyenne Mountain base on a dare. Spotted by guards, he runs away and ends up running into a women's locker room, which is full of young women in various states of undress. He stops and stares at them, assuming that he has run onto a holo-deck. One of the women (who are, of course, all military personnel) then kicks him to the ground.
