Bring Help Back: 
When a group of people in distress are stuck in one place, they will usually send someone to Bring Help Back. They might be suffering through The Siege, stuck in a Closed Circle, or they're too sick to travel and need someone to Find the Cure!. For whatever reason, people are in danger and no one is coming to save them. So what do they do? If no Epic Hail is available, then they'll have to send one of their own out to get the help they need.

Similar to Gondor Calls for Aid, except that the process of calling is an adventure in and of itself. Typically, the nature of the threat is such that securing help is an Instant-Win Condition — provided you reach them in time, anyway. Compare Pet Gets the Keys for another task commonly accomplished by the Non-Human Sidekick. See also Bring News Back, which is sort of an inverse (bringing news to someone to help _them_ instead of bringing them news that _you_ need help).

-   A variation in **Galavant**: Sid decides he has to atone for killing Galavant (he gets better), although he isn't sure what he must do. In the finale, he returns to the battle between Richard and Galavant, the Hortensians, and the Valencians with reinforcements made up of the various Wacky Wayside Tribes Galavant and co. found throughout the season (although not the guest stars who headed said tribes, because as Sid pointed out, that would be too expensive for the network).
-   **Game of Thrones**. In "Beyond the Wall", our heroes are trapped in the middle of a freezing lake by the Night King's army of undead wights. Gendry, the least experienced fighter, is sent to Eastwatch so an Instant Messenger Raven can be dispatched to Queen Daenerys in the hope that her dragons can pull a Big Damn Heroes before the lake freezes over.

-   **Red Hand of Doom**: As this module focuses on fighting a whole army of villains, this is necessary. The heroes can ask the elderly forest giant Old Warklegnaw to gather his relatives to delay the Red Hand's advance.

Bring Help Back Example in Video Games

-   The primary goal of the Player Character in **Fallout** and **Fallout 2**. In the first game, the player is sent to find a new chip to repair the Vault's water purification system to ensure their community doesn't die of thirst. They can buy everyone time by negotiating a deal with the Water Merchants, but this has the unforeseen consequence of making the Vault easier for the Super Mutants to track down. In the sequel, the player is sent to find a terraforming device known as a Garden of Eden Creation Kit to save their crops.
-   **The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion** lets you do this in an optional quest; the city of Bruma is under attack by an enormous Oblivion Gate, and you can request help from the other cities in the province (which they'll send, but only after you close the gates threatening **them**, first).
-   **Mass Effect 3** is pretty much Bring Help Back: The Game. You spend much of the game rallying any help you can think of and also solving several conflicts along the way to free up the conflicting parties' war resources, so you can take back Earth from the Reapers.
-   Partly the case in **Dragon Age: Origins**, although there's no one particularly waiting for you to bring allies, as the original defenders are dead, and no one trusts the Grey Wardens anymore thanks to Loghain. Much of the game, however, does revolve around going around Ferelden and securing help, including Dalish elves (or werewolves), dwarves, (possibly) golems, magi (or templars), etc. Naturally, these will agree to send help only if you help them first. Oh, and you still have to convince the Fereldens to trust you again, so that the Ferelden army can join you.
-   This is revealed to be T3-M4's goal in **Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords**, but you can only get him to talk about it with a high Intelligence score and influence level.

After Revan's capture by the Sith Empire, T3 returned to Republic space but could only find one Jedi after the First Jedi Purge: The Exile.
-   In **Temtem**, your Global Airship is shot down by the Belsoto Clan and crash-lands on the toxic Death World of Tucma, injuring several of your crewmates. The story arc revolves around trying to find medical supplies and repairmen in the Underground City of Quetzal past the badlands.
-   Basically the goal of every playable character in season one of **Game of Thrones (Telltale)**. House Forrester is on the verge of war with House Whitehill, and after Lord Forrester is slaughtered at the Red Wedding his squire and children desperately try to get help wherever they can. His squire Gared joined the Night's Watch in an attempt to find a legendary grove said to hold the secret to saving their house, his eldest son Rodrick attempts to marry into a stronger house to gain an army while dealing with Whitehill occupation at home, his eldest daughter serves as Queen Margaery's handmaiden and attempts to enlist the aid of the Tyrells and Lannisters, and his second son Asher attempts to return with an army after having been exiled.
-   The only way to unlock the Golden Ending of **A Dance with Rogues** is to give your word to bring back help to the Delberg Castle, besieged by the orcs in the endgame, and make good on that promise.
-   The objective of most of your journey in **Metro 2033** is to travel through dangerous tunnels to reach the largest station in the metro in order to ask the Rangers for help against the mysterious Dark Ones that threaten your small home station. They aren't willing to help as much as you hoped, though.

In order to preserve their crumbling empire, Zala'ess Vel'Sharen goes on a diplomatic mission to the city of Nuqrah'shareh in hopes of recruiting like-minded Blue Bloods with promises of conquest. Her mission is ultimately a success, and picks up enough allies to completely turn the tables on the rebels, just as her sister, Sarv'swati, is about to face her Last Stand.

-   During the siege of the Alamo, a number of couriers were sent out of the fort to bring back reinforcements. They didn't make it back in time.
-   Before the Battle of Marathon against the invading Persians, Athens sent Pheidippides, their fastest runner, to Sparta for reinforcements, a considerable distance which he covered in two days, allegedly with a time out to stop and chat with the terrifying wilderness god Pan. The Spartans didn't actually show up in time for the battle, so the Athenians defeated the Persian force with the help of only the tiny city of Plataia (and Pan, apparently.) An embroidered account claims that Pheidippides subsequently ran from Marathon to Athens and expired with the news of the victory on his lips, which probably apocryphal story eventually gave us the modern English word "marathon" in the sense of 'long-distance run'.
-   The **Alive** example was a dramatization of a true story that occurred in 1972.
-   The Donner Party, snowbound in the Sierra Nevadas, running out of food and losing people to malnutrition, sent a group called the Forlorn Hope to Sutter's Fort in the Sacramento Valley to seek help. The 100-mile trek... did not go well. It's debated among historians how much the Donner Party really did resort to cannibalism and how much was sensationalized in the newspapers, but the Forlorn Hope is generally agreed to have done it.
-   During the lynching of Jim Averill and Ella Watson, during the Johnson County Cattle War of Wyoming, a young ranch hand named Gene Crowder who witnessed their abduction rode to the home of a neighbor, Frank Buchanan to warn him. Buchanan rode up as the lynch mob was putting nooses round their necks, firing upon them from a distance and wounding one but was unable to stop the hanging.
