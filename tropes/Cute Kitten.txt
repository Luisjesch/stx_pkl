Cute Kitten: 
_"Side note: Kittens make everything better."_

...admit it, how long did you spend looking at the example picture before you started reading this article? Looking at the picture with automatic Bambi eyes setting in, with brain geared to "Such wee small biddy kitties? Whosa cute kitty? Sleepy kitty."

Kittens seem to provoke an automatic pleasure/protective/affection reaction in many (if not most) people. For this reason, they are often used by creators to arouse those feelings toward a character as well. Want to show that someone is a softy despite their crusty exterior? Have them rescue a kitten! Want to indicate that they're evil instead? Torturing or killing a kitten will do it. Want to lighten a mood that's gone Darker and Edgier? Add a kitten or two.

Kittens increase the cuteness factor exponentially. Examples on this page should be limited to works where this is deliberately used with kittens or cats, not simply "this work includes a kitten," or "this work includes a cute little animal."

Cat Girl can be a Sister Trope if you're creative enough. See also The Internet Is for Cats.

Compare Cool Cat, Fun Size, Mega Neko, Precious Puppy, Big Friendly Dog, Kindhearted Cat Lover, Cuteness Proximity, Bunnies for Cuteness, Panthera Awesome, Great White Feline, and High Koala-ty Cuteness. Contrast with Cats Are Mean, Hair-Raising Hare and Mister Muffykins. (Except when Cute Is Evil, in which case they go hand-in-hand.) In most cases, though, kittens are portrayed as more friendly and likable than adult cats, hence the contrasting tropes of Right-Hand Cat and If You're So Evil, Eat This Kitten!. In fact, when a dog is chasing an adult cat, the dog is usually portrayed as the hero but when a dog is chasing a kitten, the dog is often the villain.

Cute Kitten Example in Advertising

-   This Nexus S 4G Advertisement. Featuring a cameo of Nyan Cat!
-   This Bouygues Telecom commercial with live kittens as office workers.
-   Every advert for cat-related products, such as cat litter (one UK advert involved a white kitten searching the house for the litter tray with a child-like voice over) and cat food. They also tend to appear on the packages of said products (especially for food that's specifically designed for kittens).
-   This advertisement for Sauza Tequila, in which a fireman (who has just rescued a kitten from a burning building) teaches you how to make a margarita. With the kitten's help.
-   Chessie, the mascot of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. She was introduced in 1933 to promote the railway's overnight trains, and soon took over C&O advertising. The railway added two kittens (Nip and Tuck) and a husband (Peake the tomcat). In 1972, when the C&O merged with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad and the Western Maryland Railway, Chessie became the mascot for the entire Chessie System. You can still see her silhouette on boxcars.
-   This advert for Chocolate Digestive Biscuits.
-   This commercial for Pampers diapers may contain a lot of adorable animal babies, but the different feline cubs shown surely attract the most attention and adoration, and it's likely no accident it ends with a lion cub.
-   In **Dear Kitten**, a BuzzFeed viral ad campaign for **Little Friskies** brand cat food, an older cat explains the facts of life to a new kitten, combining **Cute Kitten** with Cats Are Snarkers.
-   This commercial for the Swedish air-travel website Flygresor.Se, featuring a whole group of kittens wearing little airplane costumes. It got popular enough to warrant several "sequel" ads with the same concept.
-   The Progressive commercial "A Pet Too Far" has lots of cute little animals, but Mittens the kitten is the most popular one.
    
    **Jamie:** She's a diva.

Cute Kitten Example in Anime & Manga

-   Osamu Tezuka
    -   **Atom Cat**: In a world where Astro Boy is just a cartoon show, a bullied Astro Boy-obsessed kid is forced to take his little tomcat away from home. When a group of aliens disguised as humans accidentally run over him and his pet cat, they try to cover it up by healing both the boy and cat up and erasing their memories of the event. However, because they have never seen a cat before, they unwittingly give the near-death tomcat all the powers of Astro Boy based from their readings of the injured boy's memories. With the ability to speak, lift heavy objects and fly, Astro Cat spends the rest of the series saving his sweetheart, Mink, or his owner from danger, both mundane and supernatural. Subverted by one of Astro Cat's enemies, Mephisto, a devil-like feline with supernatural powers who's lived since Egyptian times, who attempted to make Mink his bride.
    -   **Kimba the White Lion**. No points for guessing who the main character is. This even extends to his Love Interest and future wife Kitty/Laiya.
    -   **Yuusha Dan**, a young Ainu native, Kotan, who's a Friend to All Living Things befriends a white tiger after it escapes from a train carrying him to the zoo. Together they fight off villains while searching for a fantastic treasure.
    -   **Unico**: The 1981 movie and original manga has a cute kitten named Chao/Katy the Cat (renamed "Chloe" in **Unico: Awakening**). She's a black kitten that Unico first meets after accidentally falling into her basket. She reveals to Unico that she was abandonded by someone and dreams on becoming a "Cat Witch" due to reading a book about fairy tales. Chao/Katy later wishes to become a human after believing an old lady to be an actual witch (much to to confusion of Unico) which the titular unicorn temporarily grants the next morning. While Unico reveals to her that he granted he wish, Chao/Katy doesn't believe him until she suddenly turns back into a cat. After saving the old woman from drowning with Unico's help, she permanently becomes a human girl.
-   President Aria<small>◊</small> from **ARIA**.
-   **Hetalia: Axis Powers**:
-   **Azumanga Daioh**:
    -   Kamineko and Mayaa, the latter of which is actually an Iriomote cat cub. Kamineko only plays it straight only when luring Sakaki in for the kill. Otherwise, he's an evil little bastard (or alternatively possibly just acting like a real feral cat and averting All Animals Are Domesticated... Or just hates Sakaki).
    -   Additionally, Chiyo in a cat costume in Sakaki's imagination. Awwwww!
    -   And if that weren't enough for you, Sakaki likes to fawn over Nekokoneko ("neko" meaning "cat", and "koneko" meaning "kitten"), a pair of white cats with Blank White Eyes (more accurately, a kitten resting on top of a cat's head). In fact, Sakaki fawns over **any** cat. Even though they usually run away or get violent with her.
    -   Then there's also the very, very realistically-drawn newborn kitty that Yukari tries to hand off to the girls, and those in photos from Sakaki's **Cat Fancy**\-style magazine. It was the Art Shift that made them realistically **adorable**.
-   Would you believe this trope is used in **Battle Royale**? The island the students fight on seems to have a lot of kittens. Shuya and Noriko get a literal Cat Scare moment, a kitten is cruelly killed by a maddened student and there is a whole Flash Back sequence about one guy who took to his class a very young kitten. All those kittens are realistically drawn.
-   WHENEVER Sebastian from **Black Butler** finds a cat (cue Ciel calling him a **neko-baka**, cat-obsessed idiot. Even if it's true when he sees one). Yes, cats are cute enough even to make demons gush over them.
-   Yoruichi from **Bleach** has the ability to turn into a black cat, which for some reason makes her voice sound male. Rather amusingly though, one of Yoruichi's first appearances consists of Urahara perhaps succumbing to this trope, and tossing her up and down in the air in a playful manner, while saying something nonsensical.
    
    **Urahara:** Upsy daisy! Upsy daisy! **\[tossing Yoruichi up and down\]**
    
-   Keroberos and his "Evil Counterpart" Spinel Sun in **Cardcaptor Sakura** are pretty darn cute in their power-conserving size. Kero's Big Eater tendencies and love of sweets, and what happens to Spinel when he eats sugar, only add to the delight.
-   **A Certain Magical Index**:
    -   Sphinx, the cute little kitty Index smuggled home. She was so taken by his cuteness she'd named him shortly after she saw him.
    -   Also, MISAKA. Aw, she's taking care of the kitty and oh shit Accelerator just ruptured all her veins by making her blood flow backwards.
-   Chi<small>◊</small> from<small>◊</small> **Chi's Sweet Home** is a cute, friendly kitten.
-   **Chainsaw Man**: Power's cat Meowy (Nyako) is a cute, friendly furball that also acted as her Morality Pet. Back when Power was a wild Fiend wandering the woods, she found Meowy as an emaciated cat and took it in. Initially merely intending to fatten up Meowy and eat it, Power ended up bonding with the kitty and becoming true companions with it.
-   Umibozu of **City Hunter** fame has a debilitating fear of cats, particularly if they're adorably cute kittens. This is mainly used for hilarity ensues purposes, but it also lead to a few serious scenes, such as, in one story, one of Umibozu's worst enemies knowing this weakness, and cornering him with it (but is ultimately saved by Ryo, who immediately after bursts into laughing at this scene).
-   The Student Council mascot Arthur in **Code Geass**. He enjoys biting Suzaku, his unofficial owner, but he's much nicer toward pretty much everyone else in the show. Word of God says that Arthur **does** like Suzaku. His bites are supposed to be his way to show his affection, which is Truth in Television, as cats may bite or otherwise nibble on the object of their affection.
-   **Comic Girls** has Kaoruko's cat Nyaos, which is adored by most of the cast (except Tsubasa), especially when she has that beret on her head.
-   Yune of **Croisée in a Foreign Labyrinth** has a knack for finding cats wherever she goes, and she just can't... help... petting... them— **'scuse me, gotta chase a cat!** Even the ending theme and mid-episode transition cards feature her with cats.
-   Gatomon/Tailmon from **Digimon Adventure** and **Digimon Adventure 02**... which makes it even funnier when she kicks your ass.
-   He doesn't look much like one, but Doraemon is a robot cat. He had cat ears once upon a time, but they were chewed off by a mouse when he was sleeping. Poor guy is now terrified of them. His sister Dorami invokes this trope full force.
-   Bulma's father in **Dragon Ball** has a gigantic soft spot for animals, and takes in stray cats, dogs, and dinosaurs (yes, dinosaurs) and lets them have free roam of Capsule Corporation. His favorite is a small, black, seemingly never-aging cat that spends almost all of its time perched on his shoulder. The cat is named Tama in the Japanese version and Scratch in the American dub. One of the very few times it moves off his shoulder is to rest in Android 16's hand and nuzzle into it in **Dragon Ball Z**. And that's not even getting into Yamcha's best friend Pu'ar, a sentient, floating shapeshifting cat; well, more of a cat-like thing, but still...
-   In **El-Hazard: The Magnificent World**, there's Ura the armor cat. Why does El-Hazard have an armored vest that happens to be a talking cat? Because he's **adorable**.
-   In **Fairy Tail**, Natsu has Happy, Wendy has Carla, and Gajeel has Pantherlily. Sabertooth's Dragon Slayers Sting and Rogue have Lector and Frosch, respectively.
-   **Fruits Basket**:
    -   Not only can Kyo turn into a cat when hugged by a girl, but he even attracts cats to him, like a pied piper of cute. He's just chilling in class, minding his own business, when BAM! a dozen cats are suddenly draped all over him.
    -   Kisa turns into an adorable tiger cub. When Tohru first meets Kisa in her tiger form, she mistakes Kisa for a cat while proclaiming how cute she is.
-   **Fullmetal Alchemist**:
    -   Cute kittens seem to be all over omakes. Al taking in a stray is probably part of the reason "Flame vs. Fullmetal" is a fan-favorite in **Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)** (bear in mind, Al is an animated suit of armor).
    -   In another omake even Scar loves them, then things got weird...
-   In **GA: Geijutsuka Art Design Class**, a misreading of the word for "sketching" inspires Kisaragi to draw cats in her croquis book and on a pasteboard where a cat who's "looking for a girlfriend" has been drawn; she later finds the same pasteboard with a bunch of kittens on it.
-   **Hanamaru Kindergarten**: Pa-pa-pa-pa Panda Neko! Hinagiku is also playing with a kitty in the eighth ending.
-   Tama & Shiranui of **Hayate the Combat Butler** invoke this trope when they show up. Isumi even comments on Shiranui being a cute kitten, before he starts his evil plan.
-   **Inuyasha** has Kirara the two tailed demon cat. In her 'rest' form, she is an adorable little kitten.
-   **Jewelpet** has Garnet, Sango, Alex, Tour, Kaiya, Lapis, Diana and Dian. Being a Sanrio franchise, it's to be expected.
-   Neko's cat form in **K**, especially when she's with Shiro, sitting on his shoulder, and they blink in unison, or she waves her tail at the same time as his hand (**throughout** the first episode).
-   Piro in **Kanon**. Despite being allergic to cats, Nayuki loves the little guy.
-   Komaneko the cat from the 2009 Japanese stop-motion series "Komaneko: The Curious Cat".
-   An episode of **K-On!** has Azusa taking care of a little bitty kitten that actually belongs to Jun. Azusa is uncertain due to her inexperience, but relaxes for a bit after the kitten climbs into her lap and lies down there.
-   No wonder why **Lucky Star** has a kitty mascot, who turns out to be Kagami Yoshimizu's Author Avatar. The character is sometimes referred to as Nyamo.
-   **Lyrical Nanoha**:
    -   Suzuka's house in **Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha** is filled with lots and lots of cute kitties, including one that got its wish to become a bigger kitty.
    -   **Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid** later increases its usage of Rule of Cute by introducing Asteon, Einhart's Device which Hayate, Rein, and Agito made in the form of a snow leopard cub.
    -   **ViVid Strike!**: Being Einhart's apprentice, Fuka's device Huracan is also in the form of a kitten.
-   Episode 21 of **Maison Ikkoku**, in which Godai has to look after a cat called Kyoko.
-   **A Man and His Cat**: Fukumaru gets jealous when Kanda says that he saw cute kittens on the train to work. Then Kanda says that no cat is cuter than his.
-   Shamisen in **The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya** series, owned by Kyon's family after participating in the movie the SOS Brigade made. Unusually, it's a male calico. A talking, philosophical male calico.
-   **My Bride is a Mermaid** has an entire episode revolve around a kitten. Merfolk regard cats as their natural enemies, so when Nagasumi picks up a stray kitten, he finds out he can weaponize it and reduce hardened gangsters to gibbering wrecks. Everybody else at his school is just awed at the cuteness.
-   Mikoto Minagi from **My-HiME** has two pet cats that follow her around. Mikoto from **My-Otome**, on the other hand, **is** a cat. Well, one of the Mikotos is, anyway. The other one is a cat-themed god with the sleeping habits of a cat.
-   While not a kitten, Naruto gets help from an adorable cat named Ishi in completing the first step of the Rasengan.
-   Ridiculously Human Robot Chachamaru in **Negima! Magister Negi Magi** has an Animal Lover scene when she fed the kittens (she was supposed to be evil at the time). Yes, it was adorable. Then Chachamaru gets her artifact: a Kill Sat with a cute cat motif.
    -   Meanwhile, the Alternate Continuity series **Negima!?** includes a kitty character in the form of Shichimi. While the cat may be annoying at times (although not as annoying as Motsu), Shichimi also has her share of cute moments (especially when said moments involve Nodoka in some way).
-   Even **Neon Genesis Evangelion** is cuter with kittens, until the manga version of Kaworu murders them with his bare hands.
    -   The fourth **Rebuild of Evangelion** movie contains a scene where Rei is fascinated by a mother cat with kittens in the Fourth Impact survivors' camp.
-   Sakamoto-san from **Nichijou**. As a Talking Animal (thanks to a scarf invented by the professor), he demands respect and hates being treated as cute, and becomes embarrassed when he finds himself giving into stereotypical endearing cat behavior.
-   In **Nyan Koi!**, the main character Junpei, has been cursed to understand cats which he has an allergy to. To cure the curse (which will turn him into a cat over time), he has to grant 100 wishes to the cats he meets. Meanwhile, he's surrounded by a growing harem who likes cats.
-   The main characters from the anime and manga series **Nyanpire: The Animation**.
-   **The Prince of Tennis**: Ryoma's adorable cat Karupin exists to show that he's not a complete Jerkass. Said cat had a **whole** episode dedicated to him. It's a mix of funny and heartwarming from the start to the end.
-   A black cat named Amy in the opening of **Puella Magi Madoka Magica**. Other than a drama CD, she doesn't exist anywhere else. According to the PMMM wiki, Gen Urobuchi admits that he was not aware of any cat and that he was surprised when he saw it at the storyboard of the OP. Amy was never part of the original storyline as she was fabricated by SHAFT for the OP of the Anime to mislead viewers and fans with a Red Herring. However, SHAFT approached Urobuchi for the Drama CD and asked him to include the cat in it, so Urobuchi accepted and she was included in the drama CD. Amy is actually the reason why Madoka was a Magical Girl in the third timeline; her wish to Kyuubey was to save the kitty's life when she was seriously injured.
-   Shampoo from **Ranma ½** is cursed to turn into a cute kitten with pale pink fur and violet socks and ears. One of the more adorable transformations, but unfortunately a trigger for Ranma's number one phobia.
-   **Sailor Moon** stars Luna, Artemis, and in later seasons, their Kitten From The Future Diana.
-   In the twelfth episode of **Sgt. Frog**, Giroro takes a liking to a white kitten he finds in the rain (the Funimation dub gives her a name — Miss Furbottom). She goes on to become a recurring character.
-   **Sketchbook**. Sora would love to take one of the strays as her own.
-   Blair in **Soul Eater**. True to the series form, she actually kicks a lot of ass as a magical kitten!
-   The cat-like fairy mascot from **Suite Pretty Cure ♪**, Hummy.
-   All five of **Super Sonico**'s cats. There's even an episode that focuses on them!

-   This short anime made in 1947 called "Suteneko Tora-chan" (**Abandoned Cat Little Tora**) follows a family of anthropomorphic cats who adopts a homeless kitten.
-   Japanese electronics giant Sony owns a franchise called **Tama & Friends**, which features plenty of cute kitties. For example, an OVA based on the frachise features the title character walking up to his owner (with a close up of his face<small>◊</small>) and licking him - only to find out the human owner has transformed into a cat. This turns out to be All Just a Dream.
-   Ryo-Ohki from **Tenchi Muyo!**. Nyaa~. She's technically a cat, but close enough. She combines the cuteness of kittens with the cutness of bunnies, for a massive cuteness overload.
-   **Tokyo Mew Mew**: When the main heroine Ichigo Momomiya gets excited, the extreme result is turning into an adorable black kitten.
-   A "small black cat" appears, randomly and inexplicably, in each episode of **Trigun**. Her name is Kuroneko-sama and you **will** refer to her as such! <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
-   An **Ushio and Tora** OVA had an animated short called "Tora and the Kitten". It's just as adorable as it sounds.
-   **Vampire Game** has Duzell, a deadly vampire king reincarnated a century after his defeat to wreak brutal vengeance on his foe. In the form of a kitten. Specifically, an orphaned baby fantasy wildcat adopted by a Rebellious Princess. It’s not exactly the most dignified revenge narrative.
-   **Windy Tales** has massive amounts of cats. Everywhere. And they can **fly**.
-   **Yu-Gi-Oh! GX**: Okay, Pharaoh was pretty amusing at times, but in all its seriousness **5Ds** manages to top him.<small>◊</small>
-   Early in **YuYu Hakusho**, Kuwabara is being blackmailed by a random thug who is holding his kitten hostage. That's right - the character who looks most like a normal street thug is a kitten lover.
-   Nya from **Zatch Bell!**. Sadly, this is a filler Mamodo.

Cute Kitten Example in Comedy

-   Averted by, of course, George Carlin:
    
    "You attack a baby, he cries. Attack a puppy, he cowers. Attack a kitten, he fights! **One day old** and he's lookin' for some shit!"
    
    -   Anyone who has seen the milkbar fights at Tinykittens HQ or any of the other live cat rescue channels can attest to this, including with kittens **one hour old**.

Cute Kitten Example in Comic Books

-   Garfield: Nermal likes to boast that he's "the world's cutest kitten". To Garfield, nauseatingly so. Subverted in that some strips imply he is an adult that pretends to be cute.
-   **Hellboy** agrees with this trope, underlining how he's an Anti Anti Christ.
-   Dex-Starr uses this to his advantage by being a) aggressively adorable and b) adorably aggressive. Then he blows your head off with his Red Lantern powers. His tragic backstory just makes him more desire-to-hug inducing.
-   The (not so) pious Helene (a story by Wilhelm Busch) has one. Though the trope gets subverted when her cat and<small>◊</small> another one (a tom)<small>◊</small> first kill Lene's canaries<small>◊</small> and then wreak havoc in the house.
-   In Astro City story "Pastoral", Cammie, however grudgingly, admits the farm has cute kittens. This proves a plot point later when she is wrestling with Curious Qualms of Conscience, goes off to play with them instead, and follows one to learn a crucial point.
-   The titular heroine of **Albedo: Erma Felna EDF** is an anthropomorphic cat girl who was this in her younger days, the same goes with her baby son. Also, her younger brother, named Tasak, was also this when he was a kid.
-   Salem in the early (i.e. 1960's) **Sabrina the Teenage Witch** stories. He was small enough to fit in Sabrina's hands.
-   **The Snow Cat Prince**: Syv, the youngest of seven cat princes, who looks like this.
-   **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage)**: Lunk, a stray kitten Michaelangelo found and adopted one Christmas Eve, as shown in the **Michaelangelo #1** one-shot from the late 80's.

Cute Kitten Example in Fan Works

-   The Adventures of James Vega and Sergeant Whiskers, a **Mass Effect** story done as a takeoff of a forum meme postulating that Vega likely owns a cat.
-   Ann-Kathrin Kniggendorf is well-known in **Galaxy Rangers** fandom for her Dark Fic. The main exception to this? A series of vignettes where Gooseman adopts a kitten. (See "Possessor" under "Story Cycles")
-   Sarah Girl 1998's fanfic, "Cat Mario," has Mario wearing the Cat Suit. Once he shows it to Lumpy and SpongeBob, they just about fall in love with its cuteness. Apparently trying to ignore their affection, Mario offers them some Super Bells, which give them Cat Suits of their own, to their joy. When Meowth arrives and sees the characters wearing their Cat Suits, however, he finds them more ridiculous than cute, leaving Mario to decide not to let Lumpy and SpongeBob wear the Cat Suits anymore.
-   One look at a cute kitty in the distance in **Gankona, Unnachgiebig, Unità**, and Italy rushed toward it at full-speed. Poor Japan nearly died as he was on Italy's back **while the latter was speeding**. The cuteness of Pookie helped make things better though.
-   **Game Theory** has Vesta, an adorable eight-week-old kitten. Although after Nanoha makes her a Familiar, she's a Cat Girl or a Panthera Awesome much of the time.
-   **Mall Rats** sees Lincoln and Leni Loud from **The Loud House** renting a movie and wanting something cute so Lola would enjoy it. Frank picks out a movie with a cute little kitten called Archie.
-   In **Mass Effect: End of Days**, an Asari named Phaos gets a kitten as a present, and remarks it should be illegal for an animal to be that adorable.
-   **The Nutdealer Expanded Universe**: "Unrelated" cements its status as a Breather Episode by focusing on Nathan and Tommy petting stray cats in a park.
-   **All Mixed Up!**: Oscar's personal anagrammed form is a basket of kittens with orange stripes. He ends up turned into this form by Mariana Mag at the end of Chapter 9 before she even has a chance to land on the platform of the Language Room, showcasing her agility and high speed.
-   **Forever And A Mile** introduces the younger and more tame versions of spider-cats, known as spider-kittens. They reside in gaps in Precinct 13579's ball pit.

Cute Kitten Example in Films — Animation

-   **Disney Animated Canon**: Many.
-   In **Turning Red**, the ultimate test for Mei's control of her red panda transformation is **The Kitten Box**: five absurdly cute kittens crawling all over her, purring affectionately. The Cuteness Overload nearly does get to her.
-   **Lightyear**: Sox, Buzz Lightyear's Robot Buddy, has the shape of a cute little cat, to help provide better psychological help and well-being to Star Command space rangers once they go back from missions.
-   Kitten-like proportions and demeanor contribute a large part to the appeal of Toothless the Night Fury in **How to Train Your Dragon**.
-   Puss-in-Boots in **Shrek**, the cutest badass ever. He knows it and uses it to his advantage.
    -   In his spin-off film **Puss in Boots (2011)**, a flashback shows Puss when he was an actual kitten.
    -   A tie-in short film features Puss running into the Diablos, three adorable kitten siblings who are assassins for hire.
-   The Cat from **The Bad Guys (2022)**. Once he warms up to Mr. Wolf, he fully qualifies as this in his interactions with the Bad Guys, whether it's nibbling his fingers or rubbing against him.
-   Jiji from **Kiki's Delivery Service** is so sweet he can cause a sugar high! In the English dub, he's voiced by Phil Hartman, so you get cute **and** snarkiness.
-   **My Neighbor Totoro** got a short film sequel, **Mei and the Kittenbus**, that plays exclusively in the Studio Ghibli museum. And if anything on earth is cuter than a Catbus, it's a Kittenbus - cuddly-looking just like the bigger Catbus, but smaller.

-   **The Secret of Kells** has Pangur Ban, the white cat of Brother Aidan of Iona.
-   **Home (2015)** has Pig — a small, chubby cat who's put through some slapstick.
-   **Lucky and Zorba** has Yoyo, an adorable ginger kitten.
-   **The Cat Returns** exists solely because of this trope. It's about a girl who's taken to the magical world of cute, talking kitties and then herself begins to transform into a cute, talking kitty.
-   **Cat Soup** uses kittens as the "cute" half of Grotesque Cute.
-   Edmund from **Rock-A-Doodle** gets turned into a cat by the evil owl because he finds kittens "more digestable."
    
    "Jeepers, I'm all furry!"
    
-   **Kung Fu Panda**:
    -   You really can't blame the Misaimed Fandom for thinking Tai Lung from the first film is awesome — after all, he's incredibly badass and cool and oddly sympathetic — but the real clincher comes when we see Shifu's flashbacks to raising him from a kitten. A rambunctious, big-eyed, fluffy-tailed, eager-to-please, kung-fu-lovin' kitten. The creators themselves admitted that they may have gone a bit too far in trying to avoid a one-note villain.
    -   The same applies for Defrosting Ice Queen Tigress. While some found her behavior in the first movie grating, seeing her as a sad young kitten trying to earn the approval of a man incapable of giving it did astounding things for her popularity.
    -   Goes even further in the spin-offs, in the Orphanage, the directors and other kids were terrified of her because she was so strong despite all she wanted to do was play and have friends. And it got to the point where every time she asked an innocent question like "Why is the sky blue?" or "Why is soup hot?", the directors would openly ridicule her for "being stupid", alienating herself further from others.
-   In **Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs**, Flint uses LOLCats to distract Sam. It is amazingly effective.

Cute Kitten Example in Films — Live-Action

-   **The Salesman**: A cute kitten is a resident at the apartment complex, providing random moments of cuteness. This may be because the mood of the rest of the film is rather bleak.
-   In the French comedy **The Closet** the hero's quasi-mentor figure owns an adorable kitten. In fact, it was because the main character found the kitten on the terrace of his apartment that he ended up meeting his gay neighbor who helps him.

-   **The Adventures of Milo and Otis** has this in spades, doubled with Precious Puppies.
-   In universe example: Leo Spitz of **Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen** started off his conspiracy website by selling kitten calendars. Later, Sam uses them as his Madness Mantra.
-   Horribly, horribly subverted in **The Brothers Grimm**. The most infamous part in the movie is when a small, adorable white kitten is walking along the floor during an absurd scene where a woman is being threatened with a large, spinning blade. When the torturer sees the animal, he gets startled and (read at your own risk) kicks it in the air, where we see it hit the blade and get chopped up into pieces as its flesh flies everywhere.
    -   Crosses the Line Twice: the evil General then takes the kitten's eye that's been splattered to his coat, and eats it like a rare delicacy — a Take That! at French food?
    -   Similar horrible, horrible subversion in **Pet Sematary Two**: at one point the evil, reanimated dog is shown in a kennel at a vet's office, growling at another kennel with three adorable tabby kittens in it. The kittens hiss back. Cut to the next morning, where we see an excited little girl being led into the room by her mom who tells her that she can pick whichever kitten she wants, only to scream in horror at the sight of the dog's busted-open kennel and the kittens' busted-open kennel **caked with blood and gray fur**.
-   **Hellboy**'s film counterpart likes kittens even more than his comicbook version, keeping entire litters of kittens in his room. In the first film's moment of awesome, he whups a baddie while **simultaneously** rescuing a basket of itty-bitty kitties.
-   Invoked in the DVD commentary of **A Series of Unfortunate Events** where Daniel Handler, assuming his Lemony Snicket persona, spends most of the movie trying to convince viewers to watch something else:
    
    You know what I really like? A basket of kittens. I think everyone watching this film should just go out and buy, or otherwise procure, a basket of kittens.
    
-   Several kittens appear in **Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers**. Strangely enough, Michael, who is known to kill dogs, completely ignores the kittens.
-   Jonesy in **Alien**. Not even the xenomorph can resist thinking the cat is cute.
-   **The Spirit** establishes that the main character likes cats, and The Octopus the villain pretends like cats and introduces us to a cute kitten, Muffin, "his favorite" who he then proceeds to... melt to death.
-   In **Licence to Kill**, the Hemingway House where James Bond meets up with M has some kittens wandering about (used for a Mythology Gag — the mysterious figure stroking one of them turns out to be Bond's boss, not a Blofeld-like character with a Right-Hand Cat).
-   When Bruce Lee fights Chuck Norris in the climactic battle in the Colosseum in **Way of the Dragon**, they are surrounded by adorable baby kittens.
-   **Keanu**, the feline star of the film of the same name, who is so adorable that a **gang war** is fought over him. Just look at the film's page image!
-   Thunder the cat from the 2013 French-Belgian film **Thunder and the House of Magic**.
-   **Cats & Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore** uses this to thoroughly stomp out the last remnants of the first film's Always Chaotic Evil stance on cats that Catherine (the heroic cat agent) haven't already removed — the kittens (Catherine's nieces) are cute and **very** friendly, being only excited and happy to hang around and play with a dog.
-   **Upside-Down Magic**: Most of Nory's animal hybrid forms have some part of a kitten, such as the body of a kitten with dragon wings (a Dritten), the head of a kitten on a badger's body and the feet of a kangaroo, and the head of a panda on the body of a penguin with kitten ears.
-   **The Winter Guest** has two roughcut adolescent boys who smoke, swear and talk crudely about sex, adult life and whether Growing Up Sucks. You know their hearts are good when they immediately take up the abandoned kittens they find and plan to adopt them, thus introducing themselves to mature responsibility. And cuteness.
-   **A Kitten For Hitler** is a short created by Ken Russell where a little Jewish boy travel to Germany to give Hitler one of these for Christmas hoping it will give him a change of heart. It almost works, until he notices the boy's Swastika shaped birthmark and Star of David necklace. Can you tell that the film was intentionally made to shock and appall?
-   **The Electrical Life of Louis Wain**: Invoked. Louis and Emily adopt an adorable kitten, and Louis's art based on said cat become incredibly popular. Though the notion of cats as pets had already existed, it became more popular after his art became widespread. In part thanks to Louis, people now see cats as cute housepets rather than as vermin-catchers.
-   French movie titled **A Cat's Life** (original title: **Mon chat et moi, la grande aventure de Rroû**) is about a kitten's adventures in the wild and his owner, a little girl named Clémence. Adapted from a novel named **Rroû**.

Cute Kitten Example in Literature

-   **Cats vs. Robots** has Stu and Scout, a pair of kitten siblings that Max brings home after saving them from the river in "This Is War". Obi recruits them to retrieve the Singularity Chip for him.
-   **Discworld**:
    -   You (yes, that's her name), in the novel **Wintersmith**, even softens Granny Weatherwax. Slightly. Deny it though she may. Nanny Ogg's angelically challenged tomcat Greebo (he's a big softy, really), on the other hand, found an encounter with her somewhat disquieting, to say the least.
    -   Greebo himself was apparently once a fluffy kitten. Now, he's an absolute menace feared across the Disc, and with good reason - he's known to have killed two vampires (he **ate** one) and at least one elf, and terrorises every normal animal in sight. He's seen cornering a full-grown bull and trying to play with it like a mouse, causes bears to climb trees in his presence, and brings in dead wolves the same way other cats bring in mice. The only things that consistently scare him are the Nac Mac Feegle, Legba (Mrs Gogol's decidedly uncanny cockerel), and You.
    -   Death, who is normally dispassionate (though kind, in a detached sort of way), has a soft spot for cats and gets really upset when he has to collect a bunch of kittens at once because someone drowned a sack of them in a rain barrel.
        -   In **The Last Hero**, he also had a few things to say about Schrödinger's famous thought experiment.
        -   In **Reaper Man** he is buying chocolates as part of a venture into human courtship, and finds one box decorated with pictures of cute kittens. He asks in menacing tones, "Are they cat-flavoured?"
        -   And then there's this exchange from **Thief of Time**, on a diorama of stuffed kittens.
            
            **Susan:** I wonder what happened when the man who did this met my grandfather.  
            **Lobsang:** Would he have met your grandfather?  
            **Susan:** Oh, yes. And my grandfather is rather fond of cats.
            
-   **A Song of Ice and Fire**:
    -   One of the ways it's made clear that Tommen Baratheon isn't bad is that Tommen is given a trio of kittens, of whom he becomes very fond. This is in contrast to his older brother Joffrey, who was once told that a cat was pregnant with kittens, so he cut them out of her with a knife. And if you think that this series could never be cute, just listen to the names Tommen picks: Ser Pounce, Lady Whiskers and Boots. After four books full of endless grim tidings, betrayals and suffering, this is exactly what the audience needs.
    -   It is mentioned that Princess Rhaenys also had a black kitten which she named Balerion after the ginormous historical dragon of that name, who was incidentally also called "the Black Dread". After her death, it is implied that little Bale grew up fending for itself to become a true Fire-and-Blood Targaryen; it is the toughest, meanest old cat currently in the Red Keep, and one well able to give Arya Stark the complete run-around in the maze of secret passageways. Martin has even basically confirmed this
-   In **The Belgariad** and **The Malloreon** series by David Eddings, Kal Zakath, the "evil" emperor of Mallorea, is foreshadowed as turning out to be a decent guy at heart by his affection for his striped tabby cat and her kittens. A Running Gag soon develops where 'Zakath is constantly trying to give the kittens away to people, as his cat keeps having so many of them.
-   **Warrior Cats**. They manage to even make **Tigerstar and Scourge** look adorable when they're written/drawn as kittens. And of course, fan artists will always fall back on this trope when it comes to drawing chibis.
-   In the **The Cat Who...** series of books by Lillian Jackson Brown. There is a cast of several Kitties, but the main stars are the Psychic cat Koko, and his partner Yum Yum.

-   In **Kafka on the Shore**, Johnnie Walker murders cats and saws off their heads, cutting out their "cute little hearts" and EATING them.
-   Subverted by Umbridge in **Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix**. Just because she likes (moving!) pics of kittens and decorates her office with them, this doesn't mean she's one of the good ones.
-   **Garrett, P.I.**: In **Whispering Nickel Idols**, Garrett acquires a bucketful of kittens whose very presence seems to radiate feelings of happiness, contentment, and party-time good cheer. It turns out that they're disguised lesser avatars of a goddess of merriment and the night.

-   H. P. Lovecraft was a Kind Hearted Cat Lover. He only owned one cat in his lifetime, but fed and named every alley-cat he found. His Dreamland story "The Cats of Ulthar" explains the chilling reason why "In Ulthar, according to an ancient and significant law, no man may kill a cat". The Ulthar cats return in his longest work, **The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath**, where they respect and aid the hero because he loves little black kittens. HPL also wrote an essay on why cats are better than dogs. (Just don't ask what his cat's name is...)

-   German philosopher Oswald Spengler wrote in **The Decline of the West** this: "A peacock is indubitably speaking when he spreads his tail, but a kitten playing with a cotton-reel also speaks to us, unconsciously, through the quaint charm of its movements."

-   **Rainbow Magic**:
    -   Kirsty has a kitten named Pearl, whom she adopted during the second series and named after Pearl the Cloud Fairy.

-   Findus the cat from Swedish children's book series **Pettson and Findus** (**Pettson och Findus** in Swedish) is a friendly brown and white kitten who's able to talk to his owner Findus.

-   **Stick Dog**: In "Stick Dog Chases A Pizza", Stripes becomes distracted by the sight of a pair of paws inside the passenger seat of a delivery truck, which compels her to save the creature inside. Then they see that the paws belong to a kitten, which Stripes immediately becomes enamoured with. She decides she wants to make the kitten a part of their group, and wants to take it out of the truck. Then it's revealed that the kitten was actually adopted by a truck driver, and was excited to see him coming back. Stripes is disappointed to have to say goodbye.
-   Polish book series Kicia Kocia (Kitty Kotty) is all about missadventures of a white cute antropomorphic kitten.
-   **The Saga of Tuck**: Tuck was pretty much the only one in his family not to be smitten by Cheddar Underfoot, mainly because cats are yet one more thing the he's allergic to.

Cute Kitten Example in Live-Action TV

-   Comedians Hale & Pace can't resist playing with this trope. Enter Hale with some really, REALLY cute kitten on his shoulder. Cue to Pace revealing a big microwave...How will THAT end? After much talk and zig-zagging, they finally open the microwave to reveal an already microwaved cat. Plastic, of course. (Note: This gave them instant infamy to the point that even the Other Wiki mentions the sketch.)
-   German TV station hr3 used to play segments of this video during programme breaks. Probably the only case in history where you were annoyed at the break ending.
-   Mimsie, the adorable kitten in the MTM Enterprises Vanity Plate. And if the Tommy Westphall Snow Globe didn't piss off the audience in the final episode of **St. Elsewhere**, the end credits certainly did. Ironically, the poor kitty really did pass away the same year.
-   Even Keith Olbermann is not immune. The "sanity break" at the middle of his show often had one or more adorable kitten videos. Keith would occasionally interrupt himself to squee "Ooo, a kitty!" Unfortunately, he's allergic to cats. (He does have two adorable Maltese dogs, though. They're hypoallergenic.) To this day, he features adoptable kitties and puppies on his Twitter feed.
-   In **The Big Bang Theory**, the normally aloof Sheldon Cooper turns to the comfort of cats when distressed. And of course his lullaby in times of extreme distress, for which he usually conscripts any nearby female friend to play the role of Momma/Mee-Maw:
    
    **Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur;**  
    **Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr....**
    

This song, whose real title is "Warm Kitty<small>◊</small>," was written by schoolteacher Edith Newlin in 1937. It was published by Willis, a company that produced song books for children. It also appears in the 1940s edition of **Childcraft**. The producers of **Big Bang Theory** had permission from Willis to use the song, but not from Newlin's heirs, who filed a lawsuit.

-   **Brooklyn Nine-Nine**: In "Terry's Kitties", we find out that Terry's old bullies back at the Six-Five send him a kitten every year to remind him of his screwup twenty years ago. (It Makes Sense in Context, but the short version is: Terry thought he'd cracked his first case, when it turned out he was wrong, he accused a cat of being an accomplice in desperation.) Terry understandably doesn't find it cute, and keeps insulting the kittens, but Jake adores them.
    
    **Jake:** **(whispering to the kittens)** Don't listen to him. You're a part of something much bigger than yourselves. **(blows kisses)**
    
-   **Buffy the Vampire Slayer**:
    -   Willow and Tara decide to get themselves a kitten. Not as a familiar, but just so they can make it do cute things like playing with string.

    -   Miss Kitty, incidentally, disappears after only a few appearances. We're never told exactly what happened to her; all we know is that a crossbow was somehow involved.

-   **The Chaser's War On Everything: The Hamster Wheel**'s "Australian Politics, as told through YouTube videos of cats" segments play on this.
-   **The Closer** provides a possibly deliberate example in introducing Joel, Brenda's new kitten, given that the case the episode revolves around is particularly draining emotionally.
-   **The Colbert Report**:
    -   On March 5, 2009, Stephen Colbert discussed the imploding U.S. economy with CNBC analyst Jim Cramer while videos of kittens and puppies played in the background. Well, I sure feel better about the economy!
    -   Also Black Comedy in the form of Colbert challenging a guest to debate him on the subject of throwing kittens in a wood chipper.
    -   In the 21-February-2012 episode, he challenged a fake anti-Colbert TV ad's claim that he doesn't like kittens by holding a kitten in each hand. "I love these two little kittens," he said, "And I will continue to do so until the moment they become cats."
-   One infamous moment on **Countdown** had Jimmy Carr trying to distract the panel (from, appropriately enough, **8 Out of 10 Cats**) with two baskets of kittens. This failed miserably... because the kittens promptly made a break for it, leaving him in the unenviable role of trying to keep them in line.
-   **The Daily Show**:
    -   The healthcare debate had the great toss-up between healthcare and a video of kittens playing in an empty tissue box.
        
        **Jon Stewart**: Healthcare is today's hot-button issue, but... how did the kitten get in the box?
        
    -   Stewart tried using pictures of cute kittens as a form of Brain Bleach on the segment about cover-ups of child molestation in the Catholic Church. They didn't take.

-   **House**: Death Cat. How can something so cute be an omen of your doom? Based on a True Story of a cat in a nursing home that predicted the deaths of residents. See article about Oscar.
-   Extremely subverted in **Hyperspace**, where anyone who is sentenced to their equivalent of rehab gets put in a room where all they see is kittens, and a voice saying stuff like, "Look at the kitten. The kitten obeys authority. The kitten is happy. Be like the happy kitten. Obey authority and be like the kitten." Everyone who goes in comes out brainwashed, although it does appear to wear off, otherwise the entire show would be full of people wandering around singing silently.
-   Invoked in **Jane the Virgin**, where the narrator shows the audience footage of cute cats when confronted with heavy subject material on a few occasions.
-   This is the point of the **Kitten Bowl**, Hallmark Channel's equivalent of the **Puppy Bowl**. It's cute kittens playing around in an American football stadium play-area. There is also the spinoff **Meow Madness**, which is essentially the same thing but with basketball.
-   **Late Night:** In the episode before the 2018 Midterm elections, Amber Ruffin performed a song in her signature cheerful style with an adorable kitten named Liberty, telling the audience to vote or else the cat will meet a grisly demise.

-   In the Discovery Channel documentary **Mega Predators**, a kitten is shown when the narrator is introducing the felid relative **Barbourofelis**, interacting and jumping up on a skull of it. It doesn't really serve a purpose beyonf Rule of Cute.
-   In the "Charlie" episode of **The Mighty Boosh**, Naboo advises Howard to look at a picture of kittens in a barrel to soothe himself whenever he feels himself getting too angry. The kittens in a barrel reappear during the end credits of the episode, apparently entirely for the viewer's benefit.

-   **Operation Kitten Calendar** on VH1 was an extreme example of this trope. It's basically a spot-on parody of **The Apprentice** except people are competing to make the best kitten calendar, not work for Donald Trump.
-   **Odd Squad**:
    -   "Not OK Computer" has the "virus cat" that Olympia unintentionally infects her computer with, which manifests as a cat meowing rhythmically and dancing, and rapidly multiplying. Olympia originally opened it because she thought it was a file photo of a kitten sneezing.

Cue an Imagine Spot where he dumps a box of kittens over a patient having a heart attack ("Get me a box of kittens! Stat!") and then lists the possible side-effects of kittens. Namely, allergies, tiny scratches, and erectile dysfunction. Just to make you go "Awwww!", here's a link.
-   Data's cat, Spot, in **Star Trek: The Next Generation**. Possible subversion swinging back towards a straight play when Barclay's Protomorphosis Syndrome causes her to de-evolve into an iguana and then have a litter of perfectly normal kittens.
-   **The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien** puts puppies and this trope together and gives us Puppies Dressed As Cats! (Note: link is from Hulu and may not work in all regions. Sorry.)
-   There's a show on Animal Planet called **Too Cute! Kittens** that looks at litters of various cat breeds from birth to a few months old.
-   An episode of **Top Gear (UK)** has Jeremy discussing the finer points of twin turbocharged engines, but before he launches into his explanation, he remarks that some people in the audience tend to find such explanations boring, "so here's some soft little kittens for you to look at." The screen splits halfway between Clarkson and a mound of cuddly little kittens.
-   **VR Troopers** had one episode where Ryan Steel and J.B Reese rescue a kitten from a tree. A very cute kitten.
-   Earlier on in their run, **X-Play** sometimes censored scenes of horribly gory, mangling violence with poorly cropped photos of kittens. In one instance when the censored violence escalated even further, said kitten's eyes bulged out with a startled yowl.

Cute Kitten Example in Tabletop Games

The rare times a moon cat has been caught, it vanished by sunrise.
-   In **Warhammer 40,000**, The World Eaters, despite being blood knights in the service of Khorne, are quite fond of khittens.

    -   A fanwiki for it, Lexicanum, has an entry for cats in the fourth-first millenium. An example is an Astropath's pet cat, who is described as being killed along with the entire planet's population after the planet it lived on was hit by Exterminatus.
    -   There are also Gyrinx - cat-like creatures used by some Eldar and human psykers as Familiars, enhancing their psionic abilities. These kitties have a strong telepathic link with their owners and are very loyal to them, which is unusual for cats.

Cute Kitten Example in Video Games

-   **7th Dragon III: Code VFD** has you get involved making a cat cafe at one point, the completion of which requires you to go into the Tokyo Underground and rescue some cats. Offering cat food to the cafe lets you rest there, restoring all parties' LF and MN and giving everyone some SP. For the rest of the game, you can occasionally find stray cats to recruit for the cafe.
-   **Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia**: There are cats hiding in some areas. Upon picking a cat up, it will go back to the village. Normally you can't do anything with them (aside from hitting them to make them freak out), but if you have a particular glyph, you can transform into a Cat Girl and talk to them to get some hints. Also, the cats are all named after various ingredients (like Soybean, Flour and Tofu), which makes them all the more cuter. Holding the stylus on the screen while one of the cats is present will cause a toy mouse to appear, allowing you to tease the cats with it and make them jump after it.
-   **cat planet** of course!
-   **Cat Quest**: As one could expect, almost its **entire cast** consists in Cute Kittens.
-   **Chrono Trigger**:
    -   The main character has a cat, and he can win more kitties at the fair (as well as a supply of food!). Later on, we learn Magus used to have a cat named Alfador... and if you have Magus in your active party and go where the cat is, he'll follow his owner around the area!
    -   When you fight Ozzie as part of Magus' sidequest, you hit a switch and fall down a pit. After heading back, everyone prepares for battle, then stops and they all watch as a cat randomly wanders in and presses the switch that kills Ozzie, then leaves.

-   **Dragon Age**:
    -   Subverted in **Dragon Age: Origins** "The Stone Prisoner" DLC. Kitties aren't nearly as cute when possessed by demons.
    -   Played straight in **Awakening**. You can give Anders a cute little kitten that he will immediately gush over, naming it "Ser Pounce-a-lot". Anders' love of cats has a tragically hilarious backstory: the only fond memories he had of his time in the Circle Tower were the times he played with a cat that lived in the Tower named Mr. Wiggums. Sadly, Mr. Wiggums somehow became possessed by a Rage Demon and had to be put down — but not before Mr. Wiggums **killed three Templars by himself**. Also, sadly Anders had to give up Ser Pounce-A-Lot after he nearly gotten him killed during an expedition to the Deep Roads (though he still has a deep love for cats).
    -   In **Dragon Age: Origins** Leliana and Sten have a conversation about Leliana catching the 'fierce Qunari warrior' playing with a kitten. Sten of course justifies it as 'training'. (As in, giving 'warrior training' **to the cat**. No one believes it for an instant.)
-   **Dragon Quest V**:
    -   Talk to a cat while Madchen is in the party, and Party Chat with her afterward. Nine times out of ten, she'll be delighted.
    -   Saber looked an absolutely adorable golden-and-red furball as a cub. People are shocked that Sabrecats can even be tamed.
-   **Dwarf Fortress**: Dwarves are susceptible to this trope, often adopting the fort's ludicrous supply of cats. This can be very bad for your framerate. The main developer, Toady One, has his own feline companion, Scamps, and the update log often includes lines such as "Scamps fell asleep on my shoulder like a very tired parrot today." Awwwwwwww...
-   **Eiyuden Chronicle Hundred Heroes**: The Kickstarter campaign has used the abundance of cats as a marketing point, and a golden one is available as backer-exclusive DLC. There was also a reward for premium backers to have their own cats appear in the game, but that sold out within just the first hour or so.
-   **Epic Battle Fantasy**: Cats are a frequent appearance, owing to its creator, Matt Roszak, being a big fan of them:
    -   A limbless cat named NoLegs appears in every installment — first appearing as **Brawl Royale's** first opponent, then appearing atop **Epic Battle Fantasy 1's** first boss, King Slime. All subsequent installments have him as an ally, with him being a playable character in **Bullet Heaven**, **Bullet Heaven 2** and **Epic Battle Fantasy 5**.
    -   Similar limbless cats appear as an enemy type starting from **Epic Battle Fantasy 2**.
    -   NCHProductions' mascot, a pale yellow cat named Meow Meow, also cameos in the series — first appearing as one of Natalie's Summons in EBF2, as a sidequest-giving NPC and a skill in EBF3, and as the Meow Meow Badge in EBF5.
-   **The Evil Within**: "Save Cat" in the DLC mission **The Assignment**. When you save the game, a black cat with a red ribbon round its neck appears for Kidman to stroke.
-   **Exoptable Money**: The player can buy a cat that he is she can send out to collect money, with visible hearts pouring out of the kitten each time it comes back. Don't get too attached to it, as Madame Sinclair takes notice and skins it so you can make more money off its fur.
-   **Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon** relies heavily on this. Not only can you feed and play with stray cats, but there are three mandatory quests that involve Seto following or befriending a cat. Part of Ren's motif is her strong friendship with the cats. Cats are arguably the one thing in the game that is **happy**, put there to cheer the player up.
-   The **FreeSpace 2** Game Mod **Blue Planet** has a bit where the "Meditation Widget" in Noemi's computer displays an adorable animated kitten picture, after the mission where the GTVA attacks Earth.
-   **Genshin Impact**: Diona is a playable Catfolk who is of the small girl model, and thus comes across as a kitten and has the Tsundere attitude one expects from a cat. She works at Mondstadt's Cat's Tail Tavern, where patrons come to drink while in a bar full of cats; said patrons usually start off thinking Diona is just wearing something to fit the gimmick, but are surprised to find out she is indeed catfolk.
-   **Ghost Trick**: Sissel turns out to have been a stray kitten during the fateful day ten years before the game's present in Temsik Park. During the prime timeline, he grew up to be a Cool Cat as the Big Bad's quite literal Morality Pet, with Yomiel even naming him after his fiancee who killed herself to be Together in Death with him. And during the altered timeline created during the game's climax, he stayed a kitten as the Temsik Meteorite fragment was now lodged in his body instead of Yomiel's body.
-   **Guild Wars 2**: A number of heart areas have kittens about, notably at the Snow Leopard shrine in the norn starting area. You can progress these areas by killing enemies, helping the priests... or playing with the kittens.
-   **Hidden City** has Snowy, a fluffy orange cat with big eyes who somehow wanders into the City, prompting his human family to come looking for him. The game certainly milks his cute charms by featuring him as a bonus avatar in various events, and in the 2021 Halloween event, he is featured in a mini-game which the player can play every 12 hours in exchange for artifact assemblers and other rewards. The Detective describes him as "the City's favourite cat".
-   **Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius** has Mike and Ran, flying cats that shoot balls of yarn. Mike's "force field" power is hiding under various furniture, and Ran's shield is a paper bag.
-   **League of Legends**: The 144th champion is Yuumi the Magical Cat, who is exactly what her title describes her as. While she speaks and has an arsenal of supporting magic as she rides around on a flying Spell Book, she otherwise possesses every cute cat stereotype in the books, making her one of the most utterly adorable members of the cast.
-   **The Legend of Zelda**:
    -   **The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess**:
        -   There are quite a few cats in the game, who always come up and greet Link (be he human or wolf) with a 'Mew!'. You can even cuddle them! In the Hidden Village you can even play a game where you have go talk to them all, and one of the responses you can get if you talk to cat which you've already talked to is "We're already friends, meow!". Awww. Telma's cat is a very plot important kitty.
        -   There's also the minigame late in the game where you explore the Hidden Village as a wolf in order to find and talk to 20 cats, all of whom want to be friends!
    -   **The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword**: Remlits look cute and innocent, but only during the day. At night...
-   **Mega Man V** for Game Boy introduced players to Tango, a cute, green robotic cat that meowed endearingly when summoned — and then sprouted spikes and rolled menacingly into enemies! **Mushroom Kingdom Fusion** brought him back as one of Roll's weapons.
-   In **Miitopia**, you Mii can **be** cute kittens, as it is a **Class** that focuses on dishing out damage with Wolverine Claws and restore MP to teammates by cuddling them.
-   **Minecraft** has kittens made of blocks and they are **still** adorable. They are also one of the game's only defenses against the kamikaze creepers which won't go within 16 metres of one.
-   **Mitsumete Knight**: Laury Callwell gets a few scenes where she finds three cute kittens abandoned, adopts them, and later lose them, leading to the protagonist helping her to search for them. The latter scene also draw to this trope the tough as nails Gene Petromolla and Sam Burston, revealing them as adorable Kindhearted Cat Lovers.
-   **Monster Hunter**: Your character can interact with the simply adorable Felyne, a race of cat people. Starting with **Monster Hunter Freedom Unite**, keeping one as a partner has beneficial effects such as decreasing damage taken, enhancing the benefits of food consumed, reducing field tool breakage, affecting the size of your bombs, improve cooking results, negating the intimidation effects of some monsters, and much more. But watch out for the Melynx; behind their cuddly appearance lies master thieves and pickpockets. In **Monster Hunter Portable 3rd**, **two** Felynes can accompany you on hunts as Palicoes, helping you fight monsters and gather items. **Monster Hunter Generations** lets you **play as** a Felyne hunter.
-   **Mortal Kombat**: While Kintaro would normally be classified as Panthera Awesome, if you manage to pull off a Babality on him in **Mortal Kombat 9**, you wind up turning him into a cute kitten version of himself, complete with kittenish mewling and purring and him drinking from a saucer of milk.
-   **Neko Atsume: Kitty Collector**, as its title implies, has you collecting kittens. More specifically, you use cat food and toys such as balls and scratching posts to attract cats to your yard. However, like real-life cats, the cats in this game are a bit shy and will only come to your yard while the game app is closed.
-   The Nintendo 3DS **Nintendogs** games are named "Nintendogs + Cats". They add kittens to the roster, though the main focus still goes to the puppies. The kittens aren't terribly active, can't learn tricks, and are hard to gain money from but at least they're cute.
-   **No More Heroes**:
    -   First game:
        -   Jeane the cat, the closest thing to family our homicidal hero Travis has in Santa Destroy. The player can interact and play with her by selecting the "Jeane" option in Travis' living room. There is absolutely nothing gained by doing this. Try to stop yourself doing it every time you're in the room.
        -   One of the jobs in the first game has Travis wondering around picking up cute runaway cats.
    -   **No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle**: Jeane the cat returns in this game, much chubbier. A major sidequest is to bring her back down to brainshattering cuteness, which also nets a nice extra.
    -   **No More Heroes III**: Jeane gave birth to several adorable kittens prior to the events of the game, and Travis is asked by her to retrieve them all.
-   In **No Umbrellas Allowed**, Eggie visits your shop to show you her pet cat Guylian, who looks at you with adorable, big green eyes. She also tells you to give Guylian a warm smile whenever you see the latter after work, and doing so will eventually have her dropping by your shop to rest. Your customers fawn over how cute she is and give you donations or ask for simple item recommendations, to HUE's jealousy.
-   **Ōkami** also provides lots and lots of cats to feed in the game's strangely endearing "Animal Feeding" mini-quests. The game went as far as to reinstate the Cat as a Chinese Zodiac constellation, and this Brush God gets along quite well with Amaterasu despite the latter being a canine.
-   **Persona**:
    -   There are plenty of stray cats to feed and befriend in **Persona 3**. One of Elizabeth's Requests is to feed one in particular. When you do feed it, it comes back looking larger and healthier.
    -   **Persona 4** has them too, including one you can spend time playing with to increase a social stat.
    -   **Persona 5** has Morgana, a Badass Adorable anthropomorphic cat (or cat-like creature, it's unclear) who tags along with the protagonists in their quest to help those who abuse their power reform.
-   **Phantasy Star**: The musk cats are cute kittens that talk! In the first game, one is even a playable character!
-   **Pokémon**:
    -   There are several kitties in the series, many of them are sweet and loyal to the trainers, though getting into the evolutions may take too long for some. Meowth, Glameow, Purrloin, Espurr and especially Skitty are the proper kitten Mons (though, in Purrloin's case, it uses its natural cuteness to its advantage in order to get away with stealing things and to lower the guard of its opponents).
    -   **Pokémon Sun and Moon** introduces a cat named Litten as the fire starter. Its fur is oily and highly flammable so it can attack with flaming hairballs.
    -   The ninth generation starter is Sprigatito, a Grass-type kitten. Its **Violet** Pokedex entry states that it has a sweet scent that mesmerizes those around it. The scent grows stronger when its under the sun.
-   The entire premise of **Purr Pals**, a **Nintendogs** clone for the DS and Wii.
-   The **Puyo Puyo** series has a pair of cute twin Siamese cats named Cait Sith.
-   **RuneScape**: During one quest, certain gruesome scenes (such as a brain transplant) are censored with animations of kittens performing adorable actions such as playing with yarn or wearing pirate outfits.
-   **Shadow of Destiny**: Doing an extra side quest can result in the library being filled with cute cats. You just go back into the past and give the little girl there a kitten. Back to the future, and bam. The place is filled with its descendants.
-   **The Sims**:
    -   In **MySims**, the cat statue ground flair adds 3% to a building's cuteness.
    -   In **The Sims 3**, a Sim who uses the "Awwww" interaction on a kitten will receive the +10 moodlet "Kittens!" for one Sim hour. A cat that had just given birth to a litter of kittens will give herself and her family the +80 moodlet "New Kittens" for one Sim day. All the same things work with Precious Puppies, too.
-   **Something Else**: Cat Beach has Luigi collecting 75 kittens for a cat before he allows Luigi to move onto the next level. The cat even does a cute smile at Luigi when Luigi completes this task.
-   **Stray (2022)** marketed itself on being able to play as an adorable orange moggie wandering through a cyberpunk\-style world, complete with the ability to meow, jump, and solve puzzles by knocking stuff off ledges.
-   Subverted with **Sukeban Shachou Rena** for Wii, which, despite being based around a premise of cat love, ended up being the worst-selling Wii game at 100 copies sold.
-   **Super Mario Bros.**:
    -   **Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story** has a Collection Sidequest in which Bowser collects Blitties, kittens made out of coin blocks by sucking them out of an enemy. Collecting all of them grants him his ultimate attack: The Broggy Bonker, which if performed perfectly will have Broggy lead the blitties in a blitzkrieg against the foe.
    -   **Super Mario 3D World** features cat-based outfits for Mario and co. Its Updated Re-release adds a campaign called **Bowser's Fury**, which centers around Lake Lapcat's friendly cats (who turn evil when Fury Bowser shows up) and not-so-friendly enemies with cat-like features.
-   **The Talos Principle**: There's one on the cover art, and you can free one in level B7. If you do, it changes the "free will" ending slightly, with you character picking up and holding a kitten at the ending.
-   **TinkerQuarry**: Although he resembles an adult cat, Whiskers has a cheerful personality, and is quite the Nice Guy, invoking this.
-   **Tokimeki Memorial 2**: The resident Kindhearted Cat Lovers, Miyuki Kotobuki and Kaori Yae, have positively adorable scenes revolving around cats: you can see in Childhood Mode a young Miyuki with her kitten Mii-chan in the front pocket of her dungarees, playing with her; and Kaori has a post-She's Back scene where she finds and happily plays with a kitten. In addition, Kaori has a beautiful Image Song named "Tsukiyo no Koneko" ("Moonlight Kitten").
-   **Tomodachi Life** has the Rent-A-Cat Coupon level-up gift, which allows the Mii possessing it to play with a kitten, whether by themselves or with their friends.
-   **Touhou Project**: Chen is sometimes depicted in fanart as having cat subordinates. And her animal form, as part of her nekomata shtick, is a two-tailed cat. She canonically **tries** to have cat subordinates. They don't listen to her and only hang around because she feeds them.
-   **True Love Junai Monogatari**: In under certain circumstances the Player Character might find one during a rainy day. If he does, he can keep it hidden in his apartment or not. She's actually a Cat Girl... sort-of.
-   **WarioWare: Smooth Moves** has **disco dancing kitties** in Jimmy T's stage.
-   **World of Warcraft**: Even Kel'Thuzad has a cat. And he gets angry if it's killed (however, rumors about doing so making him harder to kill or altering the Random Drops have been proven false).
    -   On the other hand, an undead questgiver has nothing better to do with her kitty than using it as a guinea pig for experiments with demonic substances.
    -   With pet battles, now there are many different cats to collect as vanity pets, including Kel'Thuzad's cat, Mr. Bigglesworth, now a reward if you collect certain pets that drop from older raids. Unlike most cats in the game, he's classified as undead and has ice attacks.
-   You can easily buy kitten 'companions' (pets) in **World of Warcraft**, provided you have enough gold.
-   **Yo-kai Watch**: Jibanyan is the series mascot and is a cute, talking cat.

Cute Kitten Example in Webcomics

-   Random kitties go here.
-   **Bittersweet Candy Bowl**, being a comic about anthropomorphic cats (and dogs!) has Molly, Abbey's cheerful younger sister. Fanart of hypothetical offspring is also a fan favorite, and the author herself sometimes gets into it.
-   **Breaking Cat News** is simply made of this trope. Special shout-out goes to Beatrix, the ever enthusiastic polydactyl intern, who shows up and rearranges the whole station. She sets up the social media accounts, and she's "got a system!"
-   **Cat Nine** of course, which can turn into other animals or cat girl too.
-   Mike is killed and one of their own is missing. What will make the **College Roomies from Hell!!!'s** day better? This.
-   **Commander Kitty** has Fluffy, an adorable Cloud Cuckoolander kitten. Just look at her go.
-   Brittany from **Domain Tnemrot**. Also, her owner.
-   **Drowtales** nastily subverted this. Kel'Noz gives little Ariel a kitten — which then gets sick while Ariel is locked in a room for a week with it, and Ariel's abusive older sister Syphile, disgusted, kills the kitten in front of her.
-   Dolly in **+EV**.
-   **The Gamercat** manages to do this even though most of the main cast is made of cats: Pixel (a female cat) finds Glitch the kitten adorable, and in a story arc Gamercat himself tries to use Glitch's cuteness to pick up girls.
-   **Girl Genius**: Krosp isn't cute exactly, but he's very good for Agatha.
-   **Girly**: Marshmallow Cat is genetically modified to be the world's most perfect cat. She gets pregnant with the scary black cat and has tons of ridiculously cute kittens.

-   **Narbonic**: When the mad scientist has her superintelligent gerbils begin their inevitable rebellion against their creator, she sends in a cute kitten named Sir Pounce. The gerbils' human intelligence causes them to coo and aww over the kitten even as he eats them one by one. After his death, Sir Pounce is spotted in Hell.
    
    "You can't sentence Sir Pounce to eternal torment!"  
    "It was an evil kitten. We can't give leniency for cuteness."
    
-   **Nip and Tuck**: While they are inconvenient in many ways, they are easier to wake up to than a DJ.
-   **The Order of the Stick**: Mr. Scruffy. In a stick figure comic, his presence never fails to add a sense of levity to the scene. Even when he's disemboweling minor human characters. (A joke about a notorious quirk in the **Dungeons & Dragons** game rules.)
-   **Papi Nyang** is all about cats and that gives us Socks, the newborn who is adorable once they start walking and talking.
-   **Penny Arcade**:
-   **Pixie and Brutus**: Pixie is designed to be as cute as possible, with big eyes and an innocent demeanor. While Brutus doesn't go into full Cuteness Proximity, he has a soft spot for her.

-   **Rhapsodies**: Goblin, Lysistrata's store cat, exploits this for all it'sworth.

    -   Another strip plays with the idea of "**Pride and Prejudice and Kittens**. No. Kittens and Kittens and even more Kittens, oh my goodness, by Jane Austen."
-   **Squid Row**: A good reason to take in a cat: it's really a kitten!
-   **Stand Still, Stay Silent** has the main cast eventually take in a kitten. At some point, the animal causes such a bad case of Cuteness Proximity in most of the team that they don't notice Lalli has woken up from his two day long Deep Sleep until the one person who noticed points it out.
-   **Sticky Dilly Buns**: The irascible Ruby acquires a kitten whose cuteness (arguably mostly an Informed Attribute) serves to relieve her Hair-Trigger Temper; see, for example, the scene where he's introduced to Amber (who names him "Minow"). For a Bilingual Bonus, French-Canadian cats do not "meow" or "miouw". They **minow**. Hence the name.
-   **Wapsi Square**: Selenium, the kitten that acquires Amanda.
-   **We Are The Wyrecats**: The kids like to keep cats around their workspace. K.A.'s father isn't too keen on this, but the team loves them.

Cute Kitten Example in Real Life

-   When the (extremely popular) Sheffield branch of Virgin Megastore finally closed, they left a sign in the window reading "Thank you and goodbye. We love you all. P.S. HMV kills kittens for profit."
-   There's a Japanese train station which never got any service or tourism — so Tama, a cat, was made station master. The station's now raking in the tourism money, which, according to Stephen Colbert, goes to "repairing the horrific accidents that result from having a **cat** as station master." She was so popular that the moment she passed away, the company officials and the cat's fans decided to elevate her as a goddess during her funeral.
-   This is closely related to the idea of killing/eating kittens as a definite sign of evilness, as in this rather elaborate insult hurled at a Canadian politician.
-   Life subverts itself in that even adorable little kittens are proficient killers and learn to hunt as early as three or four weeks of age. It's creepy-cute to see a kitten carrying around a (nearly) dead mouse that looks to be nearly the size of its wee head.
-   Islam in general tend to consider cats as clean and playful animals, and Prophet Muhammad, a Kindhearted Cat Lover, took care of cats and kittens with respect. Also, as they are ritually clean in addition to adorable and playful factor, they are allowed to keep as pets and enter mosques and homes.
-   Some studies have indicated that having a cat "may" have limited beneficial effects on the health and well-being of people, especially older adults. Also, medical researchers have demonstrated that stroking a purring cat can lower human blood pressure and pulse rate, as well as increase feelings of peace and well-being. That said, pregnant women are advised to not handle cat litter, since it contains germs that, while harmless to adults, can pose a real danger to the fetus.
-   Just search for most popular YouTube videos for "Pets And Animals" and see how many you get featuring cats.
-   Likewise, search for "kitten cam" on YouTube. Tiny Kittens HQ, Kitten Academy, Kitten Cuddle Room, Alley to Attic, The Critter Room, Frank Einstein's... Many are the offspring of feral mamas who are spayed after giving birth and then everybody is put up for adoption. (Partly thanks to environmental experiments at Tiny Kittens HQ, we now know that many adult feral cats can be socialized and adopted like any other.)
-   Taylor Swift has designed several greeting cards featuring kittens. She's on record as saying "I feel like kitten cards make everything better, pretty much." Here. And of course she then went and adopted one (two, now).
-   Cat cafés are cafés featuring a number of cats that can be interacted with by customers. They started in Korea in about 1997, are rather popular in Japan, and have spread to the U.S., Canada and Australia. The cats frequently come from a shelter and can be adopted.
-   In the spring of 2018, filmmaker Paris Zarcilla discovered an unknown cat with four newborn kittens under his bed. She had apparently slipped through his open back door. Overwhelmed with protective emotions, Zarcilla decided he was now a "cat dad" and gave himself completely to their care. The crowning moment was taking the little mother to the vet and discovering that she had no chip, so he was able to keep the whole family.
    
    **This is too much. I'm approaching nirvana. I legitimately suffer from anxiety attacks and depression and my capacity to deal with it recently has been waning. The Cat Gods have smiled upon me with benevolence and turned the monsters under my bed into kittens.**
    
-   Some NYC bodegas keep cats to control rodents, and those cats are popular amongst locals who shop at the stores. For many, seeing a cat in a bodega brightens their day.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> In fact, when someone complained about a bodega cat on yelp, New Yorkers were outraged and quickly rushed to the cats' defense.
-   Managed colonies of feral cats are used in some cities to get rid of rats and vermin naturally. Because the cats are spayed and neutered, they cannot breed out of control.
