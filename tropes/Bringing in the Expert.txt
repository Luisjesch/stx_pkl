Bringing in the Expert: 
**MacCready:** If you can't handle it, get me somebody who can! Get me Bruce Lee!  
**Cobb:** Bruce Lee is dead.  
**MacCready:** Then get his brother!

An underling fails, so their employer hires the best man (or woman) to get the job done — usually played out by villainous characters, who suffer a bitter and humiliating defeat at the hands of the hero by proxy, when the hero defeats their champion. Enraged at their defeat, they do not engage the heroes face to face themselves, but use their financial means to acquire the toughest specialists money can buy, to settle the score. The expert may be Only in It for the Money, but some are actually interested in the prospect of a Worthy Opponent to test their mettle. If the expert is soon defeated or killed despite their expertise, he (or she) is The World's Expert (on Getting Killed).

Bringing in the Expert Example in Literature

-   Inverted in **Blood Rites**, where Harry calls in Kincaid, the expert mercenary he'd met in the previous book to help deal with a gang of Black Court vampires.
-   In **The Day of the Jackal** the conspirators fail to kill De Gaulle so for the next attempt they hire a professional assassin known only as "The Jackal". Ironically, the amount of money they have to steal to afford his services is the first sign to the police of what is going on.
-   In **Fighters of Danwait**, the Lo'ona Aeo start a massive hiring spree of demobilized human soldiers, pilots, and Space Navy officers after the end of the final Void War between humanity and the Bino Faata. Previously, they recruited pretty much anyone, although mostly civilians, but the massive influx of out-of-work war vets bolsters their mercenary force (used to protect their borders and shipping) by a large factor. The civilian hires are relegated to the Convoy, providing escort to Lo'ona Aeo merchant ships, while the experienced mercs are members of the Patrol and spend their time, well, patroling Lo'ona Aeo border sectors for hostile incursion. Ironically, their typical foes are the Dromi, who had worked for the Lo'ona Aeo in the same capacity for over a millennium and are now pissed off at being terminated in favor of the upstart humans.

To avoid a massive lawsuit from IBM, the company has to design and build their own PC clone to prove that they are not infringing IBM's copyright. Gordon could do it but all current Cardiff employees are considered legally 'tainted' and the company has to hire an outsider to do the actual work. Joe then subverts the trope by hiring Cameron to work on the project. While she is portrayed as a very gifted engineer, she is still in college and has never worked in the computer industry.
-   On **Justified** Katherine Hale and Wynn Duffy plan to steal millions from fellow mobster Avery Markham. However, Markham is believed to keep his money in a safety deposit box in a local bank and neither Hale nor Duffy know much about robbing banks. To rectify this, they partner up with Boyd Crowder who used to rob banks for a living before he switched to other criminal endeavors. Boyd then discovers that the money is actually kept in the vault of a former bank building so they start looking for and expert who can help them break into the vault. Duffy hires the "Wiz", an explosives expert who knows how to blast his way into bank vaults. When that literally blows up in their faces, Boyd instead decides to dig his way into the vault through a nearby abandoned mine. Fully aware of the dangers such an operation could present, he hires Zachariah Randolph, an expert miner who knows how to work the old mines without getting yourself accidentally killed.

Two (literally) world-class OB/GYNs are flown in and do everything possible for Darlene and her baby, but they sadly explain that even with all of their knowledge and Roseanne's resources, there's only so much they can actually do given the limits of nature itself. In the end, it's implied that the family's faith and love is what truly allows the baby to live as opposed to the doctors' expertise, but the latter certainly helps the situation.
-   **Star Trek: Picard**: Who better to oversee the rehabilitation of former Borg on a derelict Borg cube than Hugh, an ex-drone? He's the Executive Director of the Borg Reclamation Project.

These also fail, however, so Tommy kicks subtlety to the curb, chases the man down, kills all of his bodyguards, and just shoots him in the head.

-   **Samurai Jack** has Aku recruiting the Imakandi, bipedal lion people renowned for never failing a hunt, in the episode **Jack and the Hunters.** While Jack gives them a lengthy chase across the city, they eventually succeed in capturing him, but were so impressed by his skill they let him go instead of turning him over to Aku.
