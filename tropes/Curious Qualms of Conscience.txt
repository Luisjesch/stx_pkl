Curious Qualms of Conscience: 
**Varrick**: Usually I look at a project like this and all I think is "WOW! I can make a ton of money off this!" But recently I've been having these... strange feelings. Inside. It's like I'm... concerned with others. And there's this nagging voice in my head. Constantly. Telling me what's right from wrong!  
**Zhu Li**: I believe that voice is your conscience, sir?

You are doing your duty — you know it, you have been instructed from childhood in how to behave properly. Or perhaps you are just listening to something that was done. Properly.

So why do you feel like it was Dirty Business? It is inexplicable, even stunning and shocking, to feel this way about your duty.

The commonest cause is that the evil being done is to someone outside the purported scope of Moral Myopia. Although association with such people can trigger it, it is not required. Others may arise when a character raised to never give a sucker an even break feels guilty about cheating, or other times when cunning appears despicable.

Frequently the character can articulate all sorts of reasons why he should not feel this way and none at all why he should, his conflict becoming manifest in his mute failure to act in a way that defy the qualms. More exaggerated cases may believe Bad Is Good and Good Is Bad, which makes it even more confusing to question one's moral stance.

Can lead to a Screw the Rules, I'm Doing What's Right! or a curious Heel Realization where the character thinks he is becoming a Heel, but the audience thinks he is repudiating it. May overlap with To Be Lawful or Good, when the moral dilemma is more complex. Sometimes, however, the character overrides the qualms.

-   In the original **Super Dimension Fortress Macross** and **Macross: Do You Remember Love?**, culture had a habit of awakening these in the Zentradi, who were established to be less conscienceless than so thoroughly indoctrinated from "birth" to ignore such qualms. The crew of the Macross was able to weaponize this, by having Lynn Minmay sing during the climactic battle in both versions, causing mass defections.
