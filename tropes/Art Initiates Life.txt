Art Initiates Life: 
_Now that the drawing was complete, the golden lines began to shine brightly. Almost too brightly to look at.  
And then, the fluffy circle he'd drawn poofed into reality. As a fully formed sheep.  
Pedro stepped back in surprise, as well as his sisters and his parents. The audience gasped in astonishment.  
It didn't look entirely normal. Its body was covered in a strange, almost scribbly texture. Its form was outlined with solid black, and seemed to fluctuate a bit.  
But it was a physical sheep, bleating like any other. And it had come from Pedro's drawing._

A common power for many one-shot villains and examples of Monster of the Week, Art Initiates Life is where a character can quite literally change their artworks into real versions of whatever they depict. Usually using some rare MacGuffin or Advanced Phlebotinum, this most often happens with a character bringing their paintings or drawings from canvas to reality, possibly using some form of a magic pencil, but can also cover various other forms of art, such as sculptors bringing various statues to life.

This is also not always a wanted side effect of these drawings, as in some series there have been instances where a character with this ability was not aware that there was actually an effect. A villainous character whose method is this may well be a Mad Artist or in games, a Mook Maker for a level or area.

Naturally results in a Living Drawing. Compare with Rewriting Reality, the written version of this trope. Can result in Pygmalion Plot. See also Portal Picture, Art Attacker.

Art Initiates Life Example in Anime & Manga

-   Nagu from **Arata: The Legend** has a hayagami that brings anything drawn with it to life. Including his dead little sister.
-   In **As the Gods Will**, Mei's knack for drawing ends up becoming her greatest strength in the Demon Extermination portion of the Kamiculum, as her Tomfoolery can bring to life anything she draws of something/someone she likes.
-   **Ayakashi Triangle**:
    -   Garaku Utagawa is able to bring any of his ink paintings to life, giving him a wide variety of creatures to command (from tiny rabbits to a giant dragon). Garaku's effectiveness is aided by his ability to draw super-humanly fast. The only major downside is that they're still made of ink, and thus water soluble.
    -   Suzu's first deliberate use for her Ki Manipulation powers is to bring origami to life. Garaku taught her to do so because folding origami helps her concentrate and he knew Suzu's past life did it before. She is **not** a Paper Master more generally, because she can only animate paper modeled after existing living things, not something like a paper airplane. In her own words, she must "provide meaning to things with the shape of life". On the plus side, being made of paper doesn't keep Suzu's creations from duplicating the abilities of the creatures they're based (like an origami dog still having a sense of smell).
-   **Bleach**: Ichibe Hyosube uses a giant brush to paint kanji, causing the word to manifest in reality. For example, "hidden" cloaks anything it's painted on in a way that makes it extremely difficult to detect anything's been hidden at all. Anything he "cuts" with his brush is also figuratively cut in half; power, speed, reaction, even the name is split into two.
-   In **Descendants of Darkness**, the genki scientist Watari can do this. The only problem? He draws with the talent of a 5-year-old...
-   Guilmon of **Digimon Tamers** was brought to life when his tamer's fanart of him got scanned through a digivice.
-   This is a major plot point in **D.N.Angel**: A man named Hikari sold his soul to the devil to gain the ability to give life to his artwork. The power drove him insane, but gave birth to the cursed objects Dark steals in the series, as well as Dark himself. Satoshi is the descendant of the original Hikari, and has these powers as well.
-   **The Elder Sister-like One**: In one of the later chapters while Yuu is doing his summer schoolwork, Chiyo passes the time practicing writing and drawing. Her drawings end up coming to life and running/crawling/slithering away, prompting Chiyo to try to catch them before Yuu notices. However, since Chiyo is Shub-Niggurath, her creations are a bit more Eldritch Abomination than most of the entries here.
-   Reedus from **Fairy Tail** can use "picto magic" to bring anything he draws (usually on his body, which has quite a lot of surface) into reality. So can the members of a dark guild "Red Hood", even using multiple images at once for greater effect, but they use notebooks to sketch on, and pencils instead of paint.

    -   **Diamond is Unbreakable**: Koichi's Echoes Act 2 can also plant written sounds, but these will instead become real; for example, if it plants the sound "whoosh", a strong gust of wind will appear; if it plants "cracklecrackle", flames will appear; etc.
    -   **Stone Ocean**: Ungalo's Bohemian Rhapsody causes any depiction of creations, from a stick figure on a street sign, to fairytale characters like Pinocchio and the Seven Dwarves, even copyrighted characters like Spider-Man , and actual historic figures such as Vincent Van Gogh coming to life on a worldwide scale.
-   In **Magic Knight Rayearth**, Aska's magic revolves around bringing her drawings to life.
-   In **Magical Idol Pastel Yumi**, Yumi is given a magic wand and locket as a reward for rescuing a flower. If she draws something in mid-air with her wand and recites the phrase, "Pastel Poppuru Poppin-pa!", whatever she drew will become real.
-   In the Magical Girl show **Fancy Lala**, Lala has a magical pen and sketchbook that she mostly uses to create new clothes for her disguises. In one episode, her experimenting with it creates a very small cat.
-   The first episode of **Mushishi** involves drawings coming to life.
-   **Naruto**:
    -   Most of Sai's combat techniques involve drawing fantastical creatures with ink on his artbook and bringing them to life to do his bidding. He hands down this very same skillset to his son, Inojin.
    -   Also, Yakumo, a filler character who could construct genjutsu (strong enough that Your Mind Makes It Real) with her art. Her power got out of control, and the monster it created killed her parents.
    -   Deidara was the first chronological example of this in the series, though his art tends to leave more of an impact, due to being made from clay plastic explosives. In fact the first thing he does is make a cute clay sculpture of a spider, that promptly turns three people's heads into salsa. Sculpting has never been so damn **epic**! Art is a bang!
-   Haruna in **Negima! Magister Negi Magi** has this in the form of a special notepad, pen, and inkwell. Her creations start out looking incredibly over-the-top and goofy, but later along the line start looking like something you'd see in **Final Fantasy.**
-   The Devil Fruit of the **One Piece** character Kanjuro grants him the ability to bring into reality anything he draws. The humorous twist is that he's also a dreadful artist and as a result can't fully utilize his ability. Until it was reveled that he faked his lack of talent and is in fact capable of drawing a perfect copy of himself that pretty much fooled everyone. Turns out that his terrible artworks were drawn with his left hand.
-   A Chinese artist in **Ranma Â½**, whose clan is famous for paintings that can trap spirits on the canvas... until some jerk comes by and releases them. And this particular artist is **terrible** at his work.
-   Ikkyu, the leader of the I-Jin in **Read or Die**, has this ability.
-   One of the Daimons in **Sailor Moon**, Chokokka, had this ability and created two statues out of sand to fight Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune.
-   There's a very cruel inversion in **Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas**\-everything the Big Bad Alone paints dies, as he found out when he painted his orphanage. Currently in the series, he's painting the entire world-he's almost done with it, too!
-   Mutsumi from **Sgt. Frog** has a "Reality Pen", given to him by his buddy Kululu, that lets him bring drawings to life.
-   A major plot twist in **Sola** revolves around Yorito learning he's a paper golem copy of someone who died hundreds of years ago, created by his sister's magic.
-   **SSSS.GRIDMAN** has this as the primary power of the Big Bad: Akane creates each Monster of the Week out of modeling clay, then Alexis uses his Instance Abreaction to bring the statue to life as a kaiju. Alexis can actually just make an infinite number of kaiju up out of thin air whenever he wants, but he doesn't have a creative bone in his body and needs someone else to come up with good designs for him.

-   **Green Lantern**:

Since Yearling is present with the Chisel at a book signing, her fan's collective desire for Daring Do to exist sets off the plot by activating it and creating a Daring Do clone based off Yearling's exaggerated accounts depicted in her books.

    -   The wizard Alyosha can bring pictures to life with the help of his magical chalk.
    -   A picture of a ship becomes real by itself in the second book and turns out to be **The Flying Dutchman**.
-   Susan Green's **Self Portrait With Wings** is based on this. Using some "special" pencils, a young figure skater draws a whimsical sketch of herself with huge gossamer wings. The next morning, the picture is wingless and she's got the wings. They're invisible to everyone else, but an awful inconvenience to her except when she's skating.
-   **The Silmarillion**: Much like how God speaks creation into being in Genesis, Eru IlÃºvatar is said to have created the universe by singing and harmonizing with his Valar. The dark side of this form of creation is that when some of the Valar deliberately disharmonize, it introduces evil into the symphony of creation.
-   In **Terra Ignota**, Bridger's powers include this, coupled with a large dose of all around reality warping. Not only can he bring toys to sentience or sapience (for a long but limited time, which can be repeated), but with some exceptions for physics, he can make real anything he draws (permanently). This even includes creating a panacea by drawing a tube of medicine and designating it as such (and hypothetically being able to wipe out all life by drawing a tube labeled "world-ending plague"). Even outright magical artifacts are within his power to make, such as resurrection potions or Hermes' winged sandals. Bridger has a "No-No Box" filled with things he knows to absolutely never make real, which includes things like a black rubber ball (which he pretends to be a black hole), a doomsday device from a comic book, and representations of religious figures.
-   The **Thieves' World** universe had a painter who was granted the ability to create life with his drawings, although he didn't realize that this ability was real, for some time. He also got the ability, much earlier on, to paint an image of the soul of the person sitting for him. This made life more awkward than it sounds since the majority of the wealthy patrons who wanted him to paint them did \* not\* like him painting the real them (especially since it rarely matched the outside).
-   **Wild Cards**: Lazy Dragon can project his consciousness into any animal effigy (he normally uses carved soap or origamis), which then becomes a real animal; meanwhile his body lies unconscious. He is considered a powerful ace.
-   In Roald Dahl's **The Witches**, the grandmother tells a story about a girl she knew as a child who was targeted by witches and trapped in a painting of a farmhouse. Her image was never seen moving, but appeared in different locations and positions in the painting, and aged at a normal human rate. Finally, she grew old and apparently died (her image disappeared), still trapped in the painting.

Art Initiates Life Example in Live-Action TV

-   Used in two episodes of **Amazing Stories**:
    -   One involved magic paint that will bring a picture of anything to life. Naturally, the kid uses it to try and bring a pinup girl to life. Unfortunately, he spills it all over his monster magazines instead.
    -   In another episode, titled "The Mission," an aspiring cartoonist is trapped inside the ball-turret on the bottom of a B-17 bomber, and the plane's landing gear won't extend. Low on fuel, they're coming in for a gear-up landing, knowing that it will crush the cartoonist to death. In desperation, the cartoonist draws a picture of the B-17 and gives it a giant pair of wheels, whereupon giant cartoon wheels miraculously appear beneath the aircraft and save him from certain doom. (This episode was based on a real-life incident in World War 2, where a B-17 ball turret gunner was trapped and the landing gear didn't extend. It didn't end as well for him as it did in the show.)
-   In the almost legendary Czech TV series **Arabela**, all the well-known stories created by humans come to life in a sort of parallel world, where genres are represented by kingdoms.
-   Inverted in the **Are You Afraid of the Dark?** Season 6 episode "The Tale of Oblivion". A boy has some charcoal and an eraser, nothing happens when he ****draws**** something, but when he ****erases**** it, it goes to a pocket dimension called "Oblivion". It even works if he just writes the name of something and then erases it. For example, to prove it to his sister Shelly, he writes "Shelly's Underpants", then erases those words. The boy travels to Oblivion to retrieve something important, and finds out his magic writing tools were once used as weapons against those who sought to abuse their power.
-   This forms the basis of **Beetleborgs**, magic bringing comic book characters to life. Eventually, **the artist** of the comic books begins designing weapons for the heroes, while his brother, an insane artist, draws new monsters for the villains (ending the Beetleborgs' practice of going to the comics to see how the monster was defeated.)
-   The **Charmed (1998)** episode "Witches in Tights" featured a teenage boy with this power. However, this case is explained as a product of the boy's power of projection; later users demonstrate that the drawings weren't strictly necessary.
-   **DenkÅ ChÅjin Gridman** and its American adaptation **Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad** both had a pair of villains: a human who would come up with computer viruses with the appearances of kaiju, and an alien who would then turn them into real kaiju with his magic. The latter, being longer than its source material, took advantage of the idea that the human could just create a backup of his art before they brought it to life so that if a monster was particularly successful, they could bring it to life again for another try.
-   **Doctor Who**:
    -   Inverted in the episode "Fear Her": a character draws various people and causes them to disappear. Reversing the process causes the trope to be played straight with a demonic picture of her father.
    -   And remember: an image of a Weeping Angel becomes an Angel.
-   **Eerie, Indiana** had the episode "Who's Who," where guest character Sara Bob had this power due to an Eerie brand pencil. She first demonstrates this by drawing a picture of main character Marshall's missing bike (for a "lost" poster), but it instead creates a new bike. To escape her terrible home life, she first draws Marshall's mother as her own long lost mom, then a picture of herself with her mother, teleporting to her.
-   One episode of **Friday the 13th: The Series** focuses on tattoos which come to life and kill whomever they are drawn upon.
-   **Get Smart**:
    -   In one episode, a villain uses a magical paint called "dorian grey" (ha ha) which can be used to retouch portraits of real people and cause them to age. He gets his comeuppance when Max and 99 get a vial of the paint and start retouching a portrait of the villain.
    -   Another episode involved a potion that, when injected into them, allowed wax figures to come to life.
-   **Haven**:
    -   In "Sketchy", a girl's first drawing of any subject holds power over that subject - bring on the man crumpled like a ball of paper and the boy whose face was erased.
    -   In "Double Jeopardy", a painting of Lady Justice is brought to life.
-   In an episode of **Misfits**, Simon attempts his first present-day rescue by trying to save a guy from a bully. The next day at Community Service, the boy recognized Simon by Simon's injury. He wants to befriend him but Simon declines. Little does Simon know that the boy has the power to make his drawings come to life. He draws Simon and him becoming friends. Of course, he takes it too far and messes up Simon's life. Buuuut, let's just say it gets fixed.
-   **Power Rangers** has this trope come up multiple times:
    -   **Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers** featured Finster, who created monsters and mooks by sculpting them from clay and then running them through... wait for it... **the Monster-Matic.**
    -   **Power Rangers: Dino Thunder** inverts this trope by having the Rangers put into a comic book world when they are drawn by an artist with a magic pen. Of course, when the Rangers escape the comic, so does the villainess.
    -   Some of the monsters of the week in **Power Rangers S.P.D.** originated from Mora's drawings.
-   Emulated for illustrative purposes in **Prehistoric Monsters Revealed**, in which hand-drawn and painted images of ancient animals appear to animate and emerge from the paper as CGI representations.
-   Similarly to the above, in two documentaries by David Attenborough:
    -   In **Natural History Museum Alive**, several of the exhibits, such as a model of a dolphin and a painting of a dodo, come to life **Night at the Museum** style.
    -   In **Flying Monsters 3D**, an untextured 3D model of a **Dimorphodon** climbs out of a computer screen and flies and climbs around the room.
-   **The Sarah Jane Adventures** both inverts this and plays it straight as well: the Mona Lisa, whose paint was made from materials from a space rock, can both bring painted objects (including herself, naturally) into the real world and trap people in paintings.
-   **Tales from the Crypt** had an episode about a comic book cover artist who was taking weird fertility drugs because his harpy of a wife wanted kids. His covers started being re-enacted in real life â and since the comic book he was drawing for was **Tales from the Crypt**, mayhem ensued.
-   An episode of **Ultraman** featured a child's drawing of a kaiju coming to life, thanks to a strange type of cosmic radiation affecting Earth. Fortunately, Gabadon was a Gentle Giant who only wanted to sleep, but his presence unnerved Tokyo badly enough that Science Patrol still needed to dispose of the monster.
-   One of the later episodes of **The Worst Witch** reveals that protagonist Mildred Hubble has the ability to turn her drawings to life. This previously unknown talent earns her a place in the prestigious Weirdsister College. Even Ms. Hardbroom is impressed.
-   The Korean drama **W Two Worlds** is about a Manhwa character who falls in love with his creator's daughter.
-   **The X-Files**: In the Event Series episode "Home Again", the Trash Man's creations are able to manifest as living things.

Art Initiates Life Example in Religion and Mythology

-   Pygmalion in Classical Mythology created a statue of a beautiful woman and promptly fell in love with it. He prayed to the goddess Aphrodite, and the statue became an actual human woman.
-   There's the Chinese folktale of a famous artist who drew dragons without dotting in their pupils; one day a prankster bumped into him, causing him to spill ink onto the scroll...cue one dragon rising out of the painting and into the sky.
    -   A variation of that tale, or possibly a similar one, involves the Emperor asking him why he never completes his paintings (by putting in the pupils). When the painter explains that he doesn't want them to come to life, the Emperor tells him to finish them anyway. Cue the dragons.
-   Many religions have this as part of their creation story. God (or **a** god) **sculpts** humans and imbues it with "the breath of life," from clay, dust, or cloth. In Jewish tradition, this led to the legend of the Golem, where a mystic does the same thing using a word of power, but with only enough intelligence to follow orders. In Aztec Mythology, an early experiment with corn sheaves resulted in monkeys instead of people. Usually, the material used for... let's call them "undesirables" is dung.
-   In another Chinese folktale a virtuous young boy is rewarded with a magic paintbrush which can create anything and uses it for the good of his community. After the evil emperor forces the kid to paint an island with a tree of gold and a ship to take him there, he waits until the emperor is out at sea and then paints a storm.
-   Quite a few religions state that the creation was based on a creator using a word or speech to create. Examples:
    -   The Memphite Egyptian creation story says Ptah, the craftsman, made the world by envisioning it through the word and his mind. By naming what was in his imagination, he created the world.
    -   Genesis tells two similar versions of the creation, with God speaking as He shapes the cosmos. This is later echoed in John 1:1. **In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.** - NIV In the second chapter of Genesis, God sculpts Adam out of dust and Eve from Adam's rib (or side, the Hebrew word could mean either).
    -   The Mayans of Guatemala had the Winged Serpent and the Maker speak their words and thoughts and discuss what should be created.

Art Initiates Life Example in Tabletop RPG

-   **Dungeons & Dragons**. Nolzur's Marvelous Pigments could be used to create any normal object by painting a picture of it. And no, it can only make COUNTERFEIT coins.
-   **Mutants & Masterminds** allows this as one of the variants of its Animate Objects power.
    -   Within the META-4 universe (the default universe of 1E), Burner of the Tag Team (empowered graffiti artists) possesses this power, being able to animate his graffiti.

Art Initiates Life Example in Theme Parks

-   This occurs in the pre-show of the former Universal Studios attraction, **The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera**. When Joseph Barbera draws Elroy Jetson on a piece of paper, he comes to life and interacts with him and Bill Hannah. The same thing happens when Dick Dastardly comes to life after being animated by a computer.
-   On a more meta note, botanists studied the soil and plants of Disneyland's **Jungle Cruise** ride in 2010 and declared that 55 years of careful maintenance of the flora had actually resulted in a **real** jungle ecosystem! Complete with the sorts of microbes typically found in wild jungles!

Art Initiates Life Example in Video Games

-   The GameCube game **Amazing Island** was a romp of mini-games where you made your own monsters to play them. By drawing them, and then sticking funny antenna and googly eyes on them. (Which somehow made them smarter...)
-   This is the ability of Eko from **Arcana Heart 3** as she drew her big brother figure, Kazu.
-   Every problem and fight-able enemy in **Bendy and the Ink Machine** comes from the Ink Machine that was used to bring Joey Drew Studios' cartoon creations, such as Bendy, to life. However, the art rarely comes to life looking how it's supposed to, and deformed monstrous versions are created instead.
-   One of the last bosses of **Castle Crashers** is a crazy painter with a treasure-chest for a head... and bunny-ears... whose painting-style was equal parts dadaistic and explosive.
-   In **Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin**, not only is a major part of the game exploring worlds inside paintings, but the Big Bad, Brauner, uses paintings to attack you. One of his attacks is becoming a painting and flying around the room to dive-bomb you. And you interrupt him in the middle of his plan to create a "piece" capable of destroying the world.
-   Much of the back story in **Charleston: The Witches' Legacy** is provided by a child's torn-up drawings, which become animated as soon as you find all the pieces of one.
-   A variation occurs in **Comix Zone**. A comic artist's villain comes to life as a living drawing and traps the artist in comic book. Several times during the game, you'll see his hand come onto the screen and draw an enemy onto the panel to fight. If you lose, the villain is replaced with a flesh-and-blood version and goes off to Take Over the World. If you win, you escape from the comic. If you earn the best ending, you can bring your fictional love interest with you.
-   **Dark Chronicle** had the artist Pan who, after getting gold paint, was able to bring to life one of his paintings to be his wife.
-   **Drawn: The Painted Tower** and its sequels have this as their premise.
-   This is the whole point of **Drawn to Life**. The player draws the playable character and a ton of various objects in the game, like the weapons.
-   A quest in **The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion** involved an artifact called the Brush of True Paint that made the things drawn in the canvas come to life. It helped an artist's incredible realism in his works, but it also led to him being trapped in one of his paintings along with a small horde of "paint trolls".
-   This is basis of the Paint and Thinner of **Epic Mickey**, and is also how the titular mouse accidentally created the Big Bad Eldritch Abomination. Nice Job Breaking It, Hero indeed.
-   Variation: Relm from **Final Fantasy VI** has an ability called "Sketch", which copies a target and randomly uses one of its attacks. At one point, you enter into an art collector's home, and get attacked by monsters hiding inside several paintings, including one ironically named "Still Life." (Also aptly named, what with its main attacks being poison attacks and death spells) Later, you discover that the monsters are due to a demon possessing the art collector's painting of an Esper, as the demon has fallen in love with "the girl in the picture."
-   **Genshin Impact** features Albedo, an alchemist who can create life from inorganic matter. He is also an artist, so naturally he could create living artworks. He did this in his character demo trailer.
-   In **Ib**, the titular character unwittingly enters a parallel world while visiting a gallery of paintings by a Mad Artist where said paintings come to life. To kill her.
-   **Illusion of Gaia** features an odd - and creepy - inversion of this with the painter Ishtar. If he makes a portrait of someone, the person becomes trapped in the painting. It happens to Kara, but Will manages to bring her back with some magic dust and a True Love's Kiss. At the end of the sequence, Ishtar paints **his own** portrait.
-   One of the spells Alexander can cast in **King's Quest VI** is a Magic Paint spell which brings to life/reality anything you paint. He ends up using it to paint a door to sneak into a castle to rescue his Love Interest imprisoned within.
-   **Kirby**:
    -   Ado, Adeleine, and Paint Roller attack by drawing monsters and bringing them to life. After being freed of her Demonic Possession, Adeleine joins your team, and uses her ability to help Kirby by painting powerups that become real... and at one point, saving the group from starvation and/or being eaten by Big Eater Extreme Omnivore Kirby while they're lost in the desert.
    -   Drawcia from **Kirby: Canvas Curse** draws the bosses Kirby faces. So does her sister Paintra, a boss from **Kirby: Triple Deluxe**. **Kirby Star Allies** adds their presumed younger sister Vividra, and **Kirby and the Rainbow Curse** added the possibly related duo of Claycia and Elline.
-   **The Legend of Zelda**:
    -   **The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword**: A Goddess Wall can generate a variety of items based on what Link draws.
    -   **The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds**: The paintings of the armored guards throughout Hyrule are brought to life by Yuga's magic.
-   **Magic Pengel** and its sequel, **Graffiti Kingdom**, revolved around the player drawing monsters to win fights and save the land. A third game, **Ragugaki Kingdom**, is a mobile RPG with similar monster-drawing mechanics and story to the previous entries.
-   The artist dolls in **Mendel Palace** are capable of scribbling on panels and using them to animate stick figures in some levels. During their Boss Battle, they make clones of themselves. You can trick them into drawing on all of the panels to render them useless, and doing so nets you an extra life and a huge score bonus.
-   In **Åkami** and **Åkamiden**, art is the primary gameplay mechanic. Lilly pads, bombs and the sun spring to life from the strokes of your celestial paintbrush.
-   One of the early bosses in **Our Darker Purpose** is "Some Harmless Markings", a living chalk drawing that attacks Cordy with clouds of chalk dust and other projectiles.
-   In **Pac-Pix** on the DS, the player must draw Pac Men which come to life and eat ghosts.

-   **Rakugaki Showtime** tells the story of a few doodles drawn to life for the purpose of defeating a group of evil doodles.
-   One of the informational videos in **Soviet Strike** implies that this is the reasoning behind the super helicopter the player flies. Specifically, the chief engineer of the project says that the reactive, adaptive armor was designed based on video games he'd played as a kid. He then specifically invokes the trope as an explanation.
-   **Super Mario Bros.**:
    -   Vincent Van Gore from **Luigi's Mansion** was a ghost artist that created the minor ghosts that were found in the mansion, and attacked by bringing 21 more of them to life from the paintings in his studio.
    -   Shadow Mario/Bowser Jr. and his magic paintbrush in **Super Mario Sunshine**, which he uses to create Proto Piranhas out of paint to deal with Mario.
    -   Hoggus from **Wario Land 4** is a ghostly pig-like creature that draws one of two different types of pig monster on a notepad at a time and sends them to attack Wario.
-   **Thief: Deadly Shadows** features a witch who can animate statues, creating foes who are harder to sneak past and definitely too hard to fight in this "First Person Sneaker" game.
-   **Uncle Albert's Adventures**:
    -   In **Uncle Albert's Magical Album**, there's a folded paper containing a drawing of a frog which turns into a real one. **Uncle Albert's Fabulous Voyage** does the same thing with three toads.
    -   In **Uncle Albert's Mysterious Island**, the player must build a pirogue by taking pictures of each parts of the pirogue from a notepad. Once every picture is correctly placed on a 3x3 grid, they turn into a real pirogue.
