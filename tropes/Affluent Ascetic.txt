Affluent Ascetic: 
_"Zero Moustafa had purchased and famously inhabited some of the most lavish castles and palazzos on the continent. Yet here, in his own nearly empty hotel, he occupied a_ servant's quarters?_"_

An Affluent Ascetic is a character who is financially well off but chooses to live modestly or even spartanly. It can include wealthy misers who have an almost pathological fear of spending even one cent on anything but can also be people who simply have little or no interest in surrounding themselves with the usual trappings of luxury. Sometimes, this is because the characters used to be poor and still retain the money-saving habits they had before they got lots of money. Sometimes its because they have gotten a "call from God" to devote themselves to serving the church as a humble monk (see Real Life history below). However, it can also be these people are engaged in "front" businesses of questionable legality and adopt a frugal lifestyle in order to keep their criminal activities from coming to the law's attention. Driving a Maserati and living in a Big Fancy House will get every cop and tax investigator looking at you; driving a modest car and living in Suburbia, no one will notice you.

Sister Trope to Non-Idle Rich and Super-Trope to Modest Royalty. Compare with Secretly Wealthy. Not to be confused with a wealthy person like a Bourgeois Bohemian who goes for a Simple, yet Opulent couple Ascetic Aesthetic (they have a "modest Manhattan "pied à terre" for when they're in Big Applesauce and a "simple beachfront cottage in Del Mar, California"), which is just a subtler form of Conspicuous Consumption.

In Real Life, this is Older Than Print, as some medieval Blue Blood nobles would forsake their towering castles and luxurious halls and become monks, taking a vow of poverty and living in a bare cell-like room at the Abbey. This also has a long history in Asia, where the most senior Buddhist monks in some regions might live in a simple cottage.

Affluent Ascetic Example in Anime & Manga

-   **Ayakashi Triangle**: While the Kazamaki clan have a Big Fancy House and lots of saved-up money, Matsuri and his grandfather Seigen don't own anything more extravagant than some personal electronics and sleep on futon instead of mattresses. Matsuri is completely shocked at Lu's palatial estate and excited to ride in a limo for the first time. Their dwelling has gone so long without renovation, it doesn't even have air-conditioning, and Matsuri's mother calls it a dump.
-   **Silver Plan to Redo From JK**: Sayuri does everything she can to save money, including making her own meals, being willing to eat slightly expired food, and taking the train to school rather than being driven by a chauffeur. She also forces her family to do the same. This is because she's aware of what it's like to be poor from her past life.
-   **Spy X Family**: Loid and Yor both have rather well-paying jobs, though they don't seem to spend money on anything beyond the basic essentials, except perhaps their clothes — Loid has several well-tailored suits, Yor her pretty dress that she wears when going after her Thorn Princess business, and the costs for Anya's Eden uniform. Their apartment is furnished with basic things, and even when Yor moved in, all of her stuff was in a few easy-to-carry boxes and quickly put away. This might have to do with their real identities—Loid is a Deep Cover Agent and is still needed to do normal intelligence missions owing to a Critical Staffing Shortage, so he has little time between home, his cover job of a psychiatrist, and his real job as a spy; while Yor is a Professional Killer who appears to be cripplingly overspecialized at that job.
-   **UzaMaid: Our Maid Is Way Too Annoying!**: Ukai Midori pathologically hates nice conditions. Though her family is very wealthy, she joined the JSDF and initially is hired by Misha as a way to get rid of Tsubame. When asked about the job, she simply states that she doesn't need money, and mostly working just for fun. Even when Misha and Tsubame spend a night at her family's hotel, she seemed more comfortable sleeping on the **cold tile floor** than on her bed.

Affluent Ascetic Example in Comic Books

-   Surprisingly common in the Disney Ducks Comic Universe:
    -   A characteristic trait of **every** incarnation of quadrillionaire Scrooge McDuck, from comics to animation, by any author. While his fellow millionaires waste money on useless status symbols, pointless luxuries, and foolish habits like gambling, he resists spending a single cent if he possibly can, with his only **unnecessary** luxuries being his large bed (at times stuffed with banknotes) and the Money Bin itself (that contains the part of his wealth that he made **directly** because he likes to watch it, rather than having it in banks and investements like the rest). Sure, he'll occasionally force himself to spring for things like employees, limousines, airplanes, and submarines, but only because they're necessary for his business or to fuel his adventure addiction, not to flaunt his wealth. To Scrooge, money is something to be saved and savored, never spent if at all possible.
    -   As befitting his status as an Evil Counterpart of Scrooge, Flintheart Glomgold is an even **worse** miser, rarely springing up money for anything he doesn't need for his business or to compete with Scrooge.
    -   Surprisingly enough, **Mickey Mouse himself**: his father is a retired billionaire, so rich that him suddenly retiring and selling off his properties may have trigged the 1929 Wall Street Crash, but he lives in a mid-sized house in Mouseton and tries to work for a living, with his family wealth being only known to those who read his father's story.
-   In **The Metabarons**, the Metabarons have planetary-scale wealth but because of their ascetic Bushitaka belief system, they rarely spend much of it barring materials for new weapon systems and luxury items for spouses who aren't Bushitaka. Even when it comes to rebuilding a destroyed Metabunker and its arsenal, those things can come free as the Metabarons' robots simply jack an uninhabited planet and convert its resources.
-   **Maus**: Vladek Spiegelman, partially due to his trauma stemming from surviving The Holocaust, is extremely frugal despite his wealth — he even swipes paper towels from restaurants to avoid having to buy napkins for his home. His wife remarks that he has hundreds of thousands of dollars in his bank account, but lives like a pauper.

Affluent Ascetic Example in Fan Works

-   **Chloé's Lament**: After Chloé made her wish to try and steal Marinette's Loved by All status, the universe grants this in the form of a Role Swap AU, in which Chloé is a middle-class baker's daughter and Marinette's family is wealthy and holds both the Grand Paris hotel and the mayoral position (both of which were held by Chloé's father in canon). However, because Tom, Sabine, and Marinette still retain their baseline personalities from the original timeline, they pointedly avert Conspicuous Consumption (a major vice of Original!Chloé) - which, according to the author, has made the Dupain-Chengs **even wealthier** than the Bourgeois family was the first time around.
-   **Forging a Better Future**:
    -   Tommy is just as rich, if not richer than he was before due to selling Merlyn Global to Oliver and reinvesting the money into Queen Industries and other companies in the city, but is living a relatively modest lifestyle as a cashier and co-manager of Lance Floral. He also continues to room with Sara at Laurel's old apartment even after it becomes safe for him to be seen in the city again, despite the fact that he can clearly afford to get his own place.
    -   Ditto for Sara. After Laurel and her receive their long-overdue trust accounts from Dinah, their both worth hundreds of millions of dollars — each. Despite that, she's perfectly content to continue living at Laurel's old apartment (Laurel having moved in with Oliver at their penthouse in the city) and running a flower shop.

Affluent Ascetic Example in Films — Live Action

-   The mercenary/assassin Gelt from **Battle Beyond the Stars** has amassed a large fortune as payment for his reputation as The Kingslayer. Trick is, there's nowhere among the civilized worlds where Gelt can abide in safety, which means he spends his days hiding in an abandoned arcade on a Ghost Planet. Gelt actually spells this out to The Hero, stating "Your offer of a warm bed and a hot meal sounds very appealing to me right now."
-   **Forrest Gump** becomes **very** rich from his shrimp boat venture and early investment in Apple Computers, Inc. He still lives in the same house since childhood, and donates to charitable causes such as building a new hospital.
    
    **Forrest:** "Mommma said there's only so much fortune a man really needs and rest is just for showing off."
    
-   **The Godfather Part II** features Hyman Roth who, despite being one of the captains of a criminal empire that he says is "bigger than U.S. Steel," chooses to live unostentatiously in a modest house in a Miami suburb and is first introduced eating a rather plain-looking sandwich. Justified, given that lavish displays of wealth would undoubtedly raise questions about where his money came from.
-   Zero Moustafa of **The Grand Budapest Hotel** is renowned as one of the richest men in Zubrowska and the owner of the eponymous hotel... and yet he dresses unassumingly, travels alone, and when he stays at his hotel, he takes a room "smaller than the service elevator." As it turns out, Zero used to work as a lobby boy at the hotel and prefers the servants' quarters where he used to live. It's eventually revealed that he's willingly destroying his fortune to keep the hotel safe from demolition, as a tribute to his dead wife.
-   The CEO in the 1988 movie **Big** hangs around his own store and plays a pretty hands-on role.
-   **Black Mirror: Bandersnatch**: Colin Ritman is a legendary games designer who, in the words of his boss, "made enough this year to buy a Lamborghini and he still smokes roll-ups". His apartment is even shown to be in Trellick Tower, which at the time was one of London's most infamously crime-ridden social housing complexes.
-   Unlike other incarnations, Lex Luthor in **Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice** chooses to appear to the public with this route, as he's sworn wearing more casual clothing, does his own driving, and even rides a motorcycle at one point. That said, both cuts of **Justice League** sees him embraces more of the luxurious lifestyle seen with prior Luthors, given he's seen meeting with Deathstroke on a large boat, in a three-piece suit, and enjoying **very expensive** champagne.

Affluent Ascetic Example in Literature

-   Charles Dickens' Ebenezer Scrooge from **A Christmas Carol** lives in a large house, but it's mostly unlit and unheated, with scant furnishings. Scrooge also collects his hoard of coins only to count them, rarely to spend them.
-   In **The Dead Secret** by Wilkie Collins, Andrew Treverton is quite well-off, but he doesn't have any interest in comfort or luxury, so he lives an extremely frugal life.
-   Played with in David Drake's **RCN** series. Adele Mundy's blue blooded family styled themselves as populists standing up for the common man and deliberately furnished their estates in an austere style in the hopes of appealing to them. One of the things Adele learned during her exile from Cinnabar is that the lower classes don't actually decorate their houses that way.
-   Plyushkin in Nikolai Gogol's **Dead Souls** is another miserly example. He owns several hundred souls (that's Russian noble lingo for serfs) but lives as cheap as a beggar.
-   **Jumper**: David steals a small fortune from a bank, and, knowing he'll immediately become a fugitive for doing so, builds himself a cozy little one-room loft in the side of a cliff only accessible by him. He also does not start dressing flamboyantly. He just uses his ill-gotten gains to give himself power, plumbing, and creature comforts in his little hideaway.
-   In **Les Misérables**, Bishop Myriel's position comes with a large salary and a palatial official residence. He allows the local hospital to occupy the palace while he lives in a small adjoining building and donates nearly all his salary to charity.
-   One of Aesop's Fables concerns a miser who lives simply and keeps all his wealth buried in his back garden, occasionally digging it up to gloat over it. One day he goes out and finds that thieves have discovered and stolen the hidden treasure; he calls on the gods for vengeance, but they take the view that, since he was never going to use the treasure, he hasn't really lost anything of value.
-   In the **Millennium Series**, Lizbeth Salander earns a fortune from the Vanger case, then increases her money through careful investments, but she barely spends any of it.
-   In **Cooking With Wild Game**, Asuta admires the Noble Savages who saved him from death and tries to emulate their self-reliance as much as possible (also, he lives in a medieval world where there just aren't many amenities available to people, regardless of how much money they have). The only luxury he indulges in is buying exotic ingredients to fuel his love of culinary experimentation.
-   The higher-ups in **Nineteen Eighty-Four** barely live any better than the squalor they inflict upon the rest of the country, as the wealth isn't the point of their society — the power alone is what they want, and view Conspicuous Consumption as a reason that previous dictatorships fell.
-   In **Guards! Guards!**, Sybil Ramkin, despite being one of the wealthiest women in the city, lives a simple lifestyle, focusing on her dragons. She and the rest of the Fancy (her dragon breeder club, full of extremely wealthy women) are noted to look scruffy and dirty from working in the dragon pens (though, of course, all their clothes are prime quality); Sybil and Rosie Devant-Molei have Brawn Hilda physiques from a lot of hard work. Vimes, examining the worn-out, grubby card of the Dowager Duchess of Quirm, notes that there's a kind of poverty only the super-rich can afford.
    -   Vimes himself becomes one of these after marrying Sibyl. Vimes is not only still a Watchman, he actively disdains shiny new armor and truncheons, so he's still out in his cardboard-soled boots and dented helmet. Best exemplified in **Jingo**, where after putting out a firebomb pitched through a shop window with his own sodden coat, the shopkeeper mistakes him for a beggar rather than a Watchman.
    -   Lord Vetinari is mentioned, in **Sourcery**, to be the head of a rich, powerful, aristocratic family, but barely **eats**: "While other lords dined on larks stuffed with peacocks’ tongues, Lord Vetinari considered that a glass of boiled water and half a slice of dry bread was an elegant sufficiency" (**Guards! Guards!**), dresses plainly: "He wore black a lot. It wasn’t particularly impressive black, such as the best assassins wore, but the sober, slightly shabby black of a man who doesn’t want to waste time in the mornings wondering what to wear" (ibid.), and for all that he does live in a palace, his personal living quarters are described thus: "It had never been a sumptuous apartment at best, and contained little more than a narrow bed and a few battered cupboards" (ibid!).
-   **Ramona Quimby** has Howie's uncle Hobart, who works in the oil industry and is said to be very rich (Ramona's father calls him "Old Moneybags" because of this). When Ramona meets him, however, he acts and dresses very casually, and doesn't appear rich at all — he arrives in a regular van and is garbed in plain shirt and jeans. The only indication of his wealth is his flippant way of spending his money when he takes Ramona, Beezus, Howie and Willa-Jean shopping for his wedding necessities.
-   In the **Dolphin Trilogy**, John, who has been raised by dolphins, has no concept of greed. After he is reintroduced to society as an adult and comes into his parents' fortune, he builds a house and servants' quarters on Crab Island so he can use it as a home base, and pays scientists in Scotland to continue his parents' research. But although he pays his servants a high salary and spends lots of money on scientific equipment, John continues to spend most of his time in the ocean, living off raw seafood and spending almost nothing on himself.

Affluent Ascetic Example in Live-Action TV

-   On **Graceland**, Briggs is taken to see the head of one of the biggest drug cartels in Mexico. He is surprised to discover that the guy lives on a small farm where he cooks his own meals and slaughters his own livestock for meat. This is contrasted with the guy's main rival who lives on a large opulent estate.
-   In **The Wire**, drug dealers, out of necessity, tend to hide their wealth from the public. Marlo is a particularly sober example, but Proposition Joe (who runs his empire out of a dingy repair shop and seems to live in an ordinary, if well-maintained, house in East Baltimore) also qualifies. Stringer Bell and Avon Barksdale are interesting borderline examples; they start quite understated, but start showing a little more flash—most particularly acquiring nice cars and large and well-appointed apartments in the Inner Harbor—once Stringer's legitimate business empire starts making them enough money to explain how they can afford such luxuries.
-   **Breaking Bad**:
    -   Cartel drug kingpin Gus Fring hides in plain sight as a frugal small business owner who drives an ordinary car and lives in a suburban home. He uses all of his wealth to build his empire and get revenge.
    -   Walter White must hide all of the money he makes as a drug manufacturer, to the point that at various points in the series, he's hiding millions of dollars in his otherwise mundane home. This becomes deconstructed in the end when it's asked **why** he's accumulating all of this wealth that he can't spend.
-   In the **Fawlty Towers** episode "A Touch of Class": although Lord Melbury looks and sounds posh, his suitcases are very scruffy. This is one of the first signs that he is not who he says he is. Basil does not care, and applies Insane Troll Logic to justify this.
    
    **Sybil:** I've never seen such tatty cases.
    
    **Basil:** Of course you haven't! It's only the true upper class that would have tat like that, it's the whole point! Oh, you don't know what I'm talking about, do you?
    
    **Sybil:** No I don't.
    
-   In **Fargo: Season Three**, V.M. Varga has made a considerable fortune from his criminal enterprises, but deliberately plays down his wealth to avoid drawing attention to himself, in part because he's a paranoiac who thinks the poor are a threat to the rich. As he explains:
    
    "Look at me. **Look** at me. This a $200 suit. I'm wearing a second-hand tie. I fly coach. Not because I can't afford first. Because I'm **smart**. So look at you, look at me, and tell me who's the richer? ... You think you're **rich**? You've no idea what rich means. Rich is a fleet of private planes filled with decoys to mask your scent. It's a bunker in Wyoming and another in Gstaad. So that's action item one: the accumulation of wealth. And I mean **wealth**, not **money**."
    
-   Ron Swanson of **Parks and Recreation** secretly has a huge amount of money <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> obtained through unspecified means, but doesn't spend any more on himself than the average person. While he is a bit miserly (most of his fortune is in the form of **buried gold**), this is mostly because Ron is a man of simple pleasures who greatly values self-dependence, to the point he prefers to build things instead of buying them whenever possible.
-   **House of Cards (US)**: Raymond Tusk is basically an evil Warren Buffet: a billionaire investor who lives in a modest home in the Midwest and uses his wealth solely to make more money. He's more interested in the power that his wealth brings him than the luxury, which makes him a foil for Underwood, who specifically went into the public sector because he's more interested in power than wealth.
-   On **Everybody Hates Chris**, the local crazy hobo Kill Moves is actually rich but chooses to live on the streets in a notoriously dangerous neighborhood because he just likes it that way.
-   After a lifetime of illegal operations and shady associations, Frank Reynolds of **It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia** retires with virtually unlimited funds to a tiny, filthy apartment he shares with Charlie. Since he's made it his life's goal to see how low he can sink into hedonism and vice, he lords his cash over the Gang, pushing them to ever-sleazier and dumber schemes in pursuit of his money.
-   Jimmy James in **Newsradio** hangs out his own station and tries to act as part of the crew, though he's certainly very enigmatic.
-   **The Dresden Files**: Unlike his book counterpart, TV!Harry was the sole heir of his Evil Mentor Justin Morningway, and as such the owner of a large mansion and significant amounts of cash. However, Harry's hatred of, and need to distance himself from, Justin mean that the mansion stays in mothballs and the money untouched, and Harry continues to work in a run-down office. The one thing he seems to have splurged on is outright buying a home, instead of attempting to make rent on a cellar apartment in the last sleazy flophouse in Chicago.
-   **Halt and Catch Fire**: Cameron is never interested in worldly possessions or luxury. Even after getting a job at Cardiff at a good wage, she lives in her office until she has to be told to get her own place. At Mutiny, she lives at the dilapidated hacker den out of which the company is run and wears clothes that are literally falling apart. After returning from Japan as a famous game designer, she decides to buy an empty field and live out of a trailer that her boyfriend barely fits inside.
-   **Devs**:
    -   Forest is the CEO of the most powerful tech company in the world, but he lives in a simple, middle-class house and drives an old, mid-level family sedan. Even considering the ridiculous property values in Silicon Valley, he could afford far more, but he doesn't care about money. He's only interested in spearheading his Devs project.
    -   Stewart is a prominent coder in Devs and so obviously receives a grand salary in addition to the expectation of a $10 million bonus at the project's completion. However, one late episode reveals that he lives in a tiny trailer parked on the side of the street in the slums. Given that he seems to spend almost all of his waking hours in the office, he likely doesn't feel the need for something more luxurious.
-   The Keoghs in **Upwardly Mobile** were able to move to Belvedere due to winning the lotto, but made not other changes to their lifestyle, so they're basically a working-class family who happen to be millionaires.

Affluent Ascetic Example in Music

-   Lucious Clay, who's featured in the Charlie Daniels Band's song **The Legend Of Wooley Swamp**, falls into the miser sub-category of this trope. He's an asocial recluse who lives alone in a swamp where he amuses himself by unearthing mason jars full of money and running his fingers through it. Lucius is robbed and murdered by thieves after digging up thirteen such jars. The thieves, however, receive a Karmic Death for their villainy.

Affluent Ascetic Example in Myths & Religion

-   One interpretation of An-Nisaa 4:37 actually forbids this trope. The idea is that all bounty is a reward sent deliberately by God, so if someone conceals their wealth or doesn't live in accordance with it, they're basically misrepresenting God's generosity and being ungrateful. This verse is also one of many that encourages charity.
-   In Hindu Mythology, Shiva (the god of sages and truth, among other things) is said to wear only a tiger pelt and live in a cave, although he is one of the divine trinity and has near-unlimited power over creation. This is because having a lot of servants or desire-inducing ornaments around would corrode his will and distract him from meditation (although he does like fulfilling his wife's requests for nice things).

Affluent Ascetic Example in Radio

-   John Avery "Whit" Whittaker of **Adventures in Odyssey** is as wealthy as you'd expect the owner of publishing monolith Universal Press and proprietor of the popular Whit's End to be. While the young juvenile characters frequently wonder how "rich" Mr. Whittaker is, one episode centers around Connie asking him why he lives like the average joe. Whit gives her a book of 3 short stories called **Tales of Moderation** that he says gives the reasons he chooses to forego "the better things in life": 1) it's smart to save money for the future rather than waste it on luxuries in the present since you never know how long your wealth will last; 2) owning a lot of gadgets and possessions can make life **more** stressful and complicated; and 3) the Christian reason — "Lay up your treasures in Heaven, for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."

Affluent Ascetic Example in Theater

-   **Avenue Q**: You'd hardly call him an ascetic, but Trekkie Monster has a million dollars lying around despite living in a one-bedroom apartment in a poor neighborhood. Turns out he'd made very smart investments in porn.
-   In Shakespeare's **Timon of Athens**, Timon is a very wealthy man who lives lavishly and holds lavish banquets. Then he becomes embittered and misanthropic, and moves to a cave where he stays and lives on roots. When he discovers a hoard of gold hidden in the cave, he doesn't change his lifestyle at all.

Affluent Ascetic Example in Video Games

-   **Campfire Cat Cafe & Snack Bar**: Daddy Doge is described as a "billionaire, the rare kind that lives humbly." The "living humbly" part is supported by him wearing an average-looking button-down shirt and regularly going to a cafe that isn't quite prestigious yet.
-   Agent 47 from the **Hitman** series. Despite being the world's top assassin and paid accordingly, he is shown to live an extremely modest lifestyle. While a lot of this is justified due to his profession (he can't be tied down to expensive assets like cars or houses and 47 even eschews fancy meals due to the possibility of them being poisoned), he doesn't seem to have any sort of indulgences apart from his expensive suits. 47 is also known to spend a lot of his money making donations to churches and orphanages, especially considering that he once lived in a church in the second game.
-   In **Do Not Feed The Monkeys** one of the double-unlock cameras you can find is of an old lady who claims to be a philanthropist who takes donations and gives them to the poor while living in a very run-down looking apartment. If you unlock the second camera you can see another room where she has a number of expensive items hidden away and on top of that a hidden vault where she actually hoards all the money that she collects.
-   In **Killer Instinct**, Cinder's backstory in the 2013 game reveals that as relatively mundane spy and merc Ben Ferris, he made a ton of money and is considered a bona fide 1-percenter. Yet he lives in a modest apartment and leases a car. As Cinder himself exposits, the money he's made is, to him, nothing more than a symbol of how good he is at what he does. Ego aside, the money makes it clear he's very good. As in good enough to be selected for the project that turns him into an even more arrogant superpowered being of fire.
-   Subverted with Madarame in **Persona 5**. He’s shown living in a run down, humble house with his student, but his Shadow confesses to having a luxury home in secret.

Affluent Ascetic Example in Visual Novels

-   **Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair**: Despite being the sole heir to his parent’s fortune and later on winning the lottery, there’s nothing to suggest Nagito has a particularly lavish lifestyle, to the point where someone who didn’t do his Free Time Events wouldn’t even know he’s rich. Compared to other wealthy characters in the series like Byakuya and Sonia, he dresses fairly simple in a hoodie, t-shirt, and jeans, and he’s also implied to like cheaper food with one of his favorite gifts being an energy drink. His self loathing might result in him thinking he doesn’t deserve to live luxuriously despite his vast wealth.
-   **Nine Series**: Miyako Kujo is an upper-class girl from the wealthiest family in town, but you would never know it from her frugal lifestyle. She gets nervous at the thought of spending more than 1,000 yen<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> on **anything**, for any reason.
-   **Tsukihime**: Arcueid is apparently well off according to All There in the Manual because a Mage Association bounty shop owner is a fan of hers and donates some of their gold to her. Additionally, Merem Solomon is also a loyal fan of hers and pays for her ventures around the world. In spite of this, Arcueid is humble with her use of money (partly because she doesn't understand it and doesn't view it as a huge thing), as shown with her modest taste in fashion and her lack of materialism.

Affluent Ascetic Example in Web Comics

-   **Schlock Mercenary**: Schlock is Secretly Wealthy due to his stock options and could have retired to a comfortable life before the comic even started: He remains a career mercenary because he likes it, and remains a sergeant (despite being the former majority stockholder of the mercenary company that employs him, still owns more shares than anyone below commander rank, and having personally hired the whole company with his own money on at least one occasion) because it gives him just the right amount of authority without forcing him out of his comfort zone. Being an omnivorous Blob Monster means he requires very few luxuries: As long as Schlock has a bathtub to rest in, friends to hang out with (or enemies to shoot at) so he won't get bored, the occasional new taste experience and the occasional tub of Ovalkwik to eat, he's content. Taken to exaggerated levels at the comic's end, where Schlock ends up unemployed (as the Toughs and Petey lose all their assets) and owning a spaceship the size of Jupiter made out of priceless trans-uranic alloys, making him the richest individual sophont in the Milky Way: His immediate reaction to learning this is to invite all his friends and former colleagues to live with him, since the ship is otherwise worthless to him because no-one can afford to buy it and he can't eat it.

Affluent Ascetic Example in Western Animation

-   Steven Universe's father Greg Universe has spent most of his adult life living in his van and working at (later owning) a carwash. Early in the third season, he gets a 10 million dollar royalty check for a song he wrote during his brief musical career... and continues to live in his van, run his carwash, and wear the same clothes. He did take his son and Pearl for a night on the town after getting the check, but the sticker shock put him off making a habit of it. After that, Greg buys a (reasonably priced) car he always wanted, but his major purchases are infrequent and usually for Steven or his friends (renting a boat for Lapis to ride on, giving Peridot a tablet he decided he didn't want) or as manager for Sadie's band.
-   **Adventure Time**: Finn and Jake live a pretty meager, spartan lifestyle and reside in a makeshift home built out of an ancient tree even though they're fabulously wealthy thanks to all the loot they've gotten from adventuring and dungeon-delving. They're such Ditzes that it never occurred to them to **spend** all that wealth, and the one time they do, it's only because they had built up so much treasure that they were running out of room in their house. Going on a wild money-spending trip in Wildberry Kingdom is their equivalent of spring cleaning.
-   In **Spongebob Squarepants**, Mr. Krabs is the owner of the Krusty Krab and has earned over a million dollars, but he's extremely cheap — mostly because he loves money in of itself and the idea of spending **any** money is borderline blasphemous to him.
-   While Amy of **Futurama** regularly wastes her Old Money, her standard outfit is basically a tracksuit. In "Put Your Head On My Shoulders," she explains it's a form of rebellion.
    
    **Fry:** Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money, how come you always dress like you're doing your laundry  
    **Amy:** I guess 'cause my parents keep telling me to be more "ladylike." As though!  
    **Fry:** I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the Pope?  
    **Amy:** Yeah, and if you were the Pope they'd be all, "Straighten your Pope hat," and, "Put on your good vestments."

-   Jose Mujica, President of Uruguay from 2010-2015, lived on his own rundown farm rather than the presidential palace, drove an old VW Beetle, and donated 90% of his salary to charitable causes during his tenure.
-   Taken further by Jonn Elwes "the Miser," an 18<sup>th</sup>\-Century English Member of Parliament. Despite being very wealthy and famously generous to other people, he had such an aversion to spending money on himself that he forbade repairs on his multiple country estates, wore clothes until they fell apart on him, and went to bed at dusk rather than spend money on lighting. While his barrister was preparing his will — roughly £50 million of assets in modern currency — the dying Elwes forbade him from wasting a candle to see better.
-   Big-box store Costco was founded and run by James Sinegal for decades, whose net worth measures in the billions and who managed to keep the company's stock growing to five thousand percent of its starting value in 27 years. Yet he was rarely seen in anything other than a simple button-up shirt, slacks, and his Costco employee badge. He is seen occasionally in open-front suits or comfortable sweaters and almost never in a tie, befitting his textbook Benevolent Boss and Honest Corporate Executive demeanor.
-   Warren Buffett, who is always vying for the top of the list of richest people in the world, lives with almost ostentatious modesty. Despite being worth almost $90 billion, he's lived in the same five-bedroom house in Omaha for over 50 years, which he purchased for the 2020 equivalent of $287,000. He drives a mid-range sedan and considers having a fast-food biscuit sandwich for breakfast to be a splurge. In fact, he views investing and money-making as cerebral exercises and isn't interested in accumulating wealth for himself, taking a relatively modest salary of $100,000 per year and his total compensation not exceeding $200,000 even with bonuses and incentives. He's even said he'll be giving his fortune mostly to charity upon his death instead of giving it to his family as an inheritance.
-   American Mafia boss Carlo Gambino went out of his way to live modestly despite his wealth and power, residing in a two-story brick house and driving a gray Oldsmobile station wagon.
-   Adam Sandler has an estimated net worth of $400 million, yet frequently wears simple athletic wear like t-shirts and basketball shorts to interviews.
-   John Chapman, better known as Johnny Appleseed, dressed in used clothing and often ate at a campfire. (He was a vegetarian and proselytized for Swedenborgian Christianity.) He was also a successful businessman, eventually owning more than 1,200 acres of orchards across Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois.
