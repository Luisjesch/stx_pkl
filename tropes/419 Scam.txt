419 Scam: 
An uncommon case of Bart applying some common sense.<sup>Meanwhile...&nbsp;</sup> 

_"Got message number 419  
This lucky day is mine, all mine"_

The advance fee fraud, known colloquially as the **419 scam**, is a form of Internet fraud commonly associated with Nigeria (hence its alternative name, the Nigerian Prince scam). The character is contacted by someone who claims (in suspiciously shaky English) to have a large sum of money which is rightfully his but which he cannot access for various reasons (sealed account, locked trust fund, etc.), and he needs the mark's help to be able to access it. If he helps out, he'll get a substantial share of the money, which could be millions of dollars. To do this, the scammer typically needs the mark's own bank account to help him transfer the money, and he needs some of the mark's own money in advance to help authorize the transfer, bribe officials, or do anything else the scammer can think of. But the money doesn't exist; once the scammer gets the mark's money or access to his bank account, he cuts off all contact. It's basically the "Spanish Prisoner" scam for the Internet age.

As a trope, though, it's not usually used as a way to drive the overall plot like the Spanish Prisoner scam is; instead, it usually goes to show how stupid or gullible a character is for falling for it. The common subversion is thus the money being real and the character unluckily passing up a reward from an _actual_ wealthy Nigerian prince. A particularly clever character might become a "scambaiter", who pretends to fall for the scam and strings the scammer along until he gets him into a humiliating or compromising situation.

In Real Life, the term derives from Section 419 of the Nigerian Criminal Code, which prohibits fraud and details the punishments and penalties that await fraudsters. However, it's used to refer to all scams of this kind, even when they don't involve Nigeria or bank accounts at all. The Real Life workings of this trope are explained in greater detail on the Analysis page. But to be a trope, it helps to use shorthand, and that's why it nearly always involves a Nigerian with a big bank account he can't access. This Nigerian is also often a prince, even though Nigeria is a republic and not a monarchy (not that the mark would be expected to know this), although it does have traditional ceremonial "princes" (not that the mark would be expected to know that either).

Considered a Dead Horse Trope in modern works, mostly because there are more subversions of the trope than actual straight uses; case in point, the image for this page is also a subversion.

Compare Clickbait Gag, a trope that parodies a later manipulative internet tactic meant to make money off of people's gullibility.

Has nothing to do with scams coming from Area Code 419, which covers the metropolitan area of Toledo, Ohio, but scam calls could originate from there.

    **Harley:** What's wrong with splurgin' on a few nice things? Besides, I put some away, made some investments...

419 Scam Example in Comic Strips

-   In one **FoxTrot** strip, Roger warns Andy to not respond to an email from a Nigerian widow offering 10 million for $500... because he's currently waiting on 20 million from a Ugandan for $350.

    **Andy**: Gee, you think?  
    **Roger**: Yup. I'm getting $20 million from a Ugandan for $350.  
    **Andy**: This is where you say "just kidding..."

419 Scam Example in Fan Works

-   In the works of A.A. Pessimal, the **Discworld** equivalent of this scam involves a bogus clacks message purportedly from a Howondaland noble. This despite them not even **having** the clacks in Howondaland, as Commander Vimes points out in **The Civilian Assistant**.
-   **The Bolt Chronicles**: Subverted in "The Autobiography" when a message from a Nigerian prince shows up in Penny's email inbox. Penny deletes it, but it turns out the offer is genuine and she misses out on a big payday.
-   Manages to reach **Equestria** in **Dear Friend**, within the Triptych Continuum. Spike fires off a series of ersatz scrolls after ingesting some "griffon-made canned lunch meat", one of which is clearly based on a classic 419. It involves the previously-unsuspected son of Sombra, twenty million bits deposited in Ponyville, and a request to help free the money so it can be used for retaking the homeland after the actions of the maniacal Preencess Celestia and the knownownown insane killer unicorn, Twilight Sparkle. (The scroll is filled with similar errors, including "horsepital" and "proponysal".) And just to top it off, it's signed "Sucker Bet".
-   Referenced twice in **The Karma of Lies**:
    -   Adrien defends his refusal to do anything about Lila scamming his classmates by insisting that she's not doing anything **really** bad, like "convincing them to send their money to one of those Nigerian prince email scams." The irony of this is that Lila is employing similar tactics with her Celebrity Lies... for instance, getting all of her friends to donate to a Fake Charity supposedly run by an Italian fashion mogul.
    -   Lila also compares this to her own methods, noting that her more over-the-top claims deliberately strain credibility in this vein in order to see who falls for them, allowing her to identify both the easiest marks and which ones require a little more **finesse**. Most of her classmates fall hook, line and sinker for her Too Good to be True claims; Adrien, meanwhile, falls into the category of "knows that she's a liar, but thinks he's too smart to be tricked."
-   In **A Young Girl's Delinquency Record**, while touring Africa, Tanya and Visha meet with a man who claims to be the exiled king of a gold-rich nation seeking their help to return to assume the throne. Tanya, for shits and giggles, decides to help him. He's 100% legit.
-   **DR DAVID EHI reverse scam** has Nigerian Businessman Dr. David Ehizojie seeking a foreign partner for a multi-million dollar natural gas project. Through e-mail he comes in contact with someone claiming to be Dr. Randolph Carter from Miskatonic University in Arkham, who needs money to finance his research into some fragmentary references to a god named "Cthulhu.". Hilarity Ensues, especially reading the side-notes of the guy pretending to be Randolph: "The Necronomicon, Cthulhu, Arkham, Innsmouth, Kingsport, R'lyeh, Dagon, "Starry Wisdom," and the names Ward, Armitage, and Randolph Carter are all very familiar to anyone that's read the works of Lovecraft. All this dope has to do is type them into a search engine and he'll see I'm full of shit."

-   **Layer Cake**: Jimmy Price lost his fortune in a far more elaborate version: a Foreign Minister from some unnamed African country came to the UK shopping for investors, boasting of the country's vast mineral reserves and promising huge returns. He didn't mention that the country's communist insurgents were poised to overthrow the current regime, so he just stashed all his gains in his Swiss Bank Account and broke off all contact with his investors.

However, the contractor was the victim of a scammer who was asking for the driveway to be rebuilt. One huge red flag that should have tipped off the defendant was that the scammer asked to be wired $300 before paying the defendant $6,000. The defendant not only lost $300 but went over to the plaintiff's house to do the contracting work, destroying part of the driveway before the real home owner (the plaintiff) came and stopped them.

Judge Judy could hardly get though the case without laughing the whole time over how stupid the defendant was and awarded the plaintiff the money to rebuild the driveway.

They would trick the scammer by responding to their e-mail saying that they don't like to deal over e-mail and only want to respond by phone and then give out the number for one of these bots. Eventually, Jolly Roger creator Roger Anderson picked up on this and designed a couple of bots which are specifically designed to respond to this scam. They will do stuff like saying that they're worried about it being a scam and need reassurance, repeat that they only want to deal by phone and not e-mail and pretend to start reading off a confirmation number, only to stop before they can finish.
-   Youtuber KSI, who is Nigerian English, referenced this once. In his video "How to be Rich on Ultimate Team", he told the viewers to send their **FIFA Soccer** data and bank accounts to the email address 419NigerianPrinceEA@hotmail.com in order to get a "blessing".
-   Subverted in the Real-Time Fandub of **Spider-Man (PS4)**. After Peter Parker receives a note from Otto Octavius to check his e-mail, Otto says that he got an email from a Nigerian prince who offered them $10,000. The offer turns out to be legitimate, and Peter uses the money to upgrade his Spider-Man suit in time for the next scene.
-   The series **Scamalot** is about its host James' response to such scams.
-   **SF Debris** loves to talk about how stupid the Kazon, and particularly Culluh, are on **Star Trek: Voyager**. It reached a zenith of hilarity in the "Basics" review when he mentions that Culluh is getting frustrated, as he has not heard back from that bank manager in Nigeria.
-   **Something Awful's** Rich Kyanka did his own bit of scam baiting once (apparently genuine), just because it's the kind of thing he does when he gets stupid emails.
-   **Texts from Superheroes**: This entry sees Thor discover that all of Black Panther's (an **actual** African prince) emails have been sent to his spam folder for this reason. He also discovers a bunch of other "Nigerian princes" require his aid, so he and Panther decide to send them Tony Stark's bank information to help them out. Needless to say, Tony isn't happy.

419 Scam Example in Real Life

-   We won't put any specific cases here, only the scam strategies and stories that are discovered, with the added bonus of helping people avoid such pitfalls. For more details, see the Analysis page.
-   Let's start with the Ur-Example, for historical value if nothing else, the above mentioned "Spanish prisoner" trick: In its original form, the confidence trickster tells his victim (the mark) that he is (or is in correspondence with) a wealthy person of high estate who has been imprisoned in Spain under a false identity. Some versions had the imprisoned person being an unknown or remote relative of the mark. Supposedly the prisoner cannot reveal his identity without serious repercussions, and is relying on a friend (the confidence trickster) to raise money to secure his release. In this classic pigeon drop game archetype, the confidence trickster offers to let the mark put up some of the funds, with a promise of a greater monetary reward upon release of the prisoner plus a non-pecuniary incentive, gaining the hand of a beautiful woman represented to be the prisoner's daughter. After the mark has turned over the funds, he is informed further difficulties have arisen, and more money is needed. With such explanations, the trickster continues to press for more money until the victim is cleaned out, or declines to put up more funds.
    -   Should the original con actually run to its fulfillment, the traditional ending is to hire a local woman, dress her up in some finery and have her meet with the mark, tearfully inform him that the prisoner was killed during the escape, and that she now also has to flee to avoid assassins. She then hands over a small but significant sum of money with the promise of more to come, kisses the mark, and vanishes.
