Constantly Lactating Cow: 
_"And if we had that goat, I could have a glass of milk whenever I wanted."_

In Real Life, female cattle are not able to be milked year round. Like most female mammals, they make milk only for their offspring and thus only lactate during pregnancy and directly after pregnancy, and even then, they only lactate during a warmer season. Cows need to constantly be pregnant (being impregnated about once a year)<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and be in a warm temperature in order to make milk. Even then, cows will eventually stop giving milk with age, which leads to the cows either being retired or sent to the slaughter.

In fiction, however, cows can be milked even when they haven't had any calves. Cows can be milked even when the weather is unsuitable for lactating. Cows in fiction lactate no matter what. The only time they'll stop is when sick, old or starving. This is because cows are mainly known for producing milk. Add this to very young audiences often not yet knowing that milk doesn't come from _just_ cows, and you get an erroneous perception that they produce it all the time. In video games where cows and their milk are a resource, this spares the logistics involving animal husbandry and managing the calves. Sometimes, udders are a weapon for the cow, with the milk being Edible Ammunition.

This trope also applies to other animals used for milk, such as goats and buffalo.

Sub-trope of Artistic License – Biology. May overlap with Lactating Male if the cow is male. See also Cow Tipping for another trope about fictional cows being portrayed inaccurately, Perplexing Pearl Production for another animal product portrayed inaccurately, The Simple Life is Simple for other agricultural misconceptions, and Super Wool Growth for another trope about farm animals producing resources faster than they should. Has nothing to do with Milking the Giant Cow.

Constantly Lactating Cow Example in Video Games

-   Cows in the **Farming Simulator** series always produce milk, thanks to the fact that Eternal Equinox is also in play in vanilla. This is averted in the Seasons mods for these games by Realismus Modding, cows will only produce milk after they have given birth though they are artificially inseminated which requires no input from the player. This can be further averted with a mod for the GlobalCompany script extension in **19** that only milks them every half-day.
-   In **Farmville** you can milk cows, and you can breed them, but you don't need to breed them in order to be able to milk them.
-   In **Hay Day,** cows always take exactly an hour to regenerate their milk after being fed, no pregnancy needed.
-   In **The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time**, you can make any cow instantly produce a surplus of milk by playing Epona's Song on the ocarina while standing next to it. If you have an empty bottle, it'll let you fill the bottle with milk in gratitude for playing such a nice song.
-   In **Let's Build a Zoo**, fertile cows will produce milk as long as they're in a barn or battery.

-   Miltank from **Pokémon** is a cow Pokemon whose signature move is Milk Drink. It's also the source of the Moomoo Milk item.

In any case, all Pokemon reproduce through eggs and young Pokemon eat solids as soon as they're hatched.

    -   Subverted in **Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life**, which strives to be more realistic than the rest of the series.
        -   Cows only give milk for two seasons before they need to be bred again. The quality and quantity of the milk also slow down just before they stop giving milk. This justifies the existence of bulls, whose entire purpose in the game is to impregnate cows. If you don't have bulls, you have to pay to borrow bulls from other farms. Also, if you buy cows, don't expect them to lactate for you immediately, because you have to breed them first. According to Takakura, the reason why the cow you start the game with can lactate for free is because she just recently gave birth.
        -   In the original game, the goat can also only be milked for a period, but she can't be bred **or** sold. The only way to get rid of her was to let her die. **Another Wonderful Life** and **A Wonderful Life: Special Edition** fixed that by allowing her to be sold.
-   Marge from **Toonstruck** is an anthropomorphic cow who laments her butter-making Churnatron being out of order due to a missing part. Once you find that part and it gets reattached, Marge will attach the machine's suction caps to her udders every few seconds to produce butter.
-   **Viva Piñata**: Moozipans and Flapyaks are able to produce milk by simply feeding them a sunflower and then directing them to a milking shed. If they are wearing a bell, the sunflower isn't even required.
