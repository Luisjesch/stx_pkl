Crashing Dreams: 
A character is dreaming; they may or may not realize that they are doing so. For once, it is a dream that makes sense, but then there is a sudden non sequitur. The character does a double take and awakens to find the non sequitur reflects what's really happening around them.

Sometimes it's not a non sequitur and makes sense in both the dream and the real world. Or the two things are distinctly connected but not the same exact thing. Common examples include the person's name being repeated over and over again (a person in the real world calling them); a phone call in the dream (which turns out to be an alarm clock); and a passionate kiss (which turns out to be either an animal licking their face or an unappealing friend giving them the Kiss of Life).

Probably everyone can attest that this trope is Truth in Television. May result in I Was Having Such a Nice Dream if the interrupted dream was a particularly pleasant one.

Compare Bedtime Brainwashing (that's a Mind Manipulation trope about manipulation by suggestions given to a sleeping subject, this is about dreams and real life coinciding, like dreaming you're kissing someone while being licked by your dog in real life). Also compare Marshmallow Dream. Contrast Acting Out a Daydream for when a daytime fantasy influences the daydreamer's real life actions.

-   This commercial for the The Royal Dutch Guide Dog Foundation (KNGF). A dazed and injured soldier looks at the carnage surrounding him in the wake of an explosion. It is a vivid reminder that War Is Hell: pain, gunfire, a doll lying in shattered rubble, and a child killed by the blast. Another soldier crouches over him and, against all logic, starts licking his face. The man suddenly wakes as he is licked by his dog — a dog that can recognize the symptoms of PTSD and intervene to help veterans like him.

But the main problem still stands: He's out of hair gel.

And then its tongue becomes Opalescence (Rarity's cat), causing her to fall. And promptly wake up.

    \[Bart wakes up\]

    -   Played straight in "Barting Over," when Lisa dreams of being at the Kennedy Center Honors, only for Marge's vacuuming (as it's spring cleaning) to wake her up, complete with a Match Cut from Lisa's reaction to the vacuuming sound in her dream to her lying awake in bed with the same expression.

    -   Similar to before in "Lisa's Rival" Marge has a romantic fantasy of a sailor after reading an erotic novel but when she and the sailor are about to kiss he hears the sound of Lisa's saxophone and complains that he's not in the mood anymore Marge tells Lisa "Stop blowing my sex... your sax... Stop blowing your sax!"

-   **SpongeBob SquarePants**

-   **A Thousand and One... Americas**: In some of the episodes, this is how Chris wakes up from whatever he's dreaming of. Something happens in the dream (for example, in one case he smells the smoke of a Peace Pipe, and in another he's seeing a huge sea wave coming at him), and then wakes up and confuses an ongoing event from the real world with that of the dream (respectively, the smell actually comes from the pie his mother is baking, and the water sound comes from the bathroom where his mother is filling up the bathtub). In most cases, it makes Chris believe he's still dreaming even after having woken up (much to the laugh of his brother).
-   In the pilot episode of **Villainous**, Dr. Flug has a dream of Black Hat congratulating him for defeating a superhero, only to suddenly start bobbing his head up and down, chanting "MAYDAY, MAYDAY, MAYDAY!" which turns out to be Flug's quirky airplane alarm clock.

-   **Winston's Potty Chair** has three instances of this:
    -   The first one occurs at the beginning, where Winston dreams that he gets splashed by a wave at the beach. His mom then wakes him up, and they find that he wet his diaper.
    -   The second one occurs when Winston wears his potty chair as a hat and imagines that he's the chief of a tribe. When his older brother, Tony tells him that his potty is not a hat, Winston imagines one of the tribesmen saying the words in Tony's voice.
    -   The third one happens when Winston imagines that he's in a prehistoric forest while reading a book about dinosaurs. Winston imagines himself falling into a puddle, and then he finds out from his father that he wet his pants.

Crashing Dreams Example in Real Life

-   That Other Wiki says this is called "dream incorporation".
-   Ah, the good old falling dream. You know, the one where you're falling and wake up on the floor.
-   Anyone who has ever fallen asleep with the TV or radio on can attest to it affecting their dreams in strange ways. Waking up to a clock radio can also have this effect, adding Awesome Music to your dream as it fades if you're lucky.
