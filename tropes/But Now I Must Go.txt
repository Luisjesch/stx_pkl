But Now I Must Go: 
**Bart:** Work here is done. I'm needed elsewhere now. I'm needed wherever outlaws rule the West, wherever innocent women and children are afraid to walk the streets, wherever a man cannot live in simple dignity, wherever a people cry out for justice!  
**Crowd:** _\[in unison\]_ Bullshit!  
**Bart:** ...all right, you caught me. Speaking the plain truth, it's getting pretty damn dull around here.

AKA "Mary Poppins Syndrome". An easy way to add anywhere from a twinge of sentimentality to a whole extra Tear Jerker scene to the end of your movie: after helping out and saving the day, The Drifter character must leave forever. It's used a lot in solo series of many an Ensemble Dark Horse, as their adventures alone can't keep them in the small town forever; they have to plausibly be able to get back to the team.

Excuses for why they need to leave are varied. Perhaps once their job is done, they are no longer needed and must set off for a new job, as with the Knight Errant, or fulfill their longstanding promise to return to their distant home. Perhaps they are bound by a supernatural curse or spell that states they can only come back every X years or they can only stay for X days. Maybe they're really some kind of Fantastic Sapient Species or godlike being, unable to settle down in this world and enjoy human comforts. Maybe they're just a traveler and can't deny the call of the open road or the cry of the sea. Maybe they seek further adventure and danger or maybe they see civilised society as having no place for rough men like them. Maybe they're a Destructive Saviour whose continuing presence could do just as much harm as the threat they helped neutralize. Maybe they must Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence. Maybe they are starting or completing the Journey to Find Oneself. Maybe they want their heroism to remain Shrouded in Myth. Maybe the final cut is missing some scene that could explain this.

It doesn't count if the character was already dying for some understandable reason, has some kind of good, understandable, plot-related reason to leave, or goes off to a Heroic Sacrifice. This is when the character has become loved and respected by other characters and has to leave for no other reason than "he must".

This tends to happen a lot in Yuri anime, especially if the lovers in question don't end up crazy or dead.

Compare Riding into the Sunset, Off-into-the-Distance Ending, Save the Day, Turn Away, No Place for Me There, Walking the Earth. Also see I Choose to Stay, which is the polar opposite. Not to be confused with Potty Emergency.

**As an ending trope, expect SPOILERS.**

There's giant oaks that need chainsawing into yacht boats, Bermuda Triangle mysteries that need solving with huge magnifying glasses, and everyone knows I could use one or twelve medals for winning exotic car-drawing competitions. I must ride my jet-ski lion into the sunset. I know a lot of you have written me and commented on my works, but I am just one ridiculously handsome man. I can't write to everyone, but please know that I consider you my dearest and closest Internet friends. I'll never forget this time we've spent together. I love you, always. SILVERFISH HAND-CATCH!

    **Van:** Oh, well... I understand...  
    **Hitomi:** Oh, don't take it like that. We can see each other any time we want.  
    **Van:** Well, yeah, but you mean in that lame, symbolic, "I'll see your face whenever I close my eyes" way, right?  
    **Hitomi:** What? No! What kind of a weak, cop-out ending would that be? I mean, I have a magic "instant teleport anywhere" pendant, and since Gaea runs on Narnia Time, if you play your cards right, I can be Queen of Fanelia during passing period and never be late for math.

    -   Doc Brown tells to Clara that he has to leave her and the town. He explains the reason to her, but she doesn't believe him (and thinks he got too obsessed with science fiction). This breaks his heart, but things get better for both of them since the parting doesn't stick.

-   Cheeky version in the teen comedy **Don't Talk to Irene**. The titular outcast is a megafan of Geena Davis and talks to a **League of Their Own** poster on the ceiling of her bedroom when she needs advice and encouragement, imagining her responses â€” which are spoken by Davis herself, who also appears in a Dream Sequence when the heroine faces her Darkest Hour.

-   Wood from **Dragoncharm** pulls this on Fortune in the Heart of the Maze.
-   This is a recurring theme in the light novel series, and the anime adaptation, of **Kino's Journey** in which the main character, as a drifter, has a self-imposed limit of staying three days upon reaching a town or rest stop and can give no exceptions regardless of the situation. This is in order not to form attachments to prevent the ideal of traveling. A little different in that the plot follows Kino to each next place. This is explored deeper when the main character, eventually revealed to be female, discovers a place she can finally grow used to loving while becoming acquainted with someone sharing many common and reminiscent traits with her. Coping on her decision on whether or not wishing to finally settle down, the conclusion is the final episode of the anime adaption, whilst the light novels simply continue, and still are, after that point.
-   **Discworld**: Mightily Oats leaves Lancre in **Carpe Jugulum**, after he and Forgiveness help fight the vampires; justified since he was a temporary stand-in for the injured Brother Perdore. He is spoken of later in **Unseen Academicals** and **I Shall Wear Midnight**.
-   **Solomon Kane**: Robert E. Howard wrote this kind of ending for "The Blue Flame of Vengeance":
    
    **"I am a landless man." A strange, intangible, almost mystic look flashed into his cold eyes. "I come out of the sunset and into the sunrise I go, wherever the Lord doth guide my feet. I seek...my soul's salvation, mayhap. I came, following the trail of vengeance. Now I must leave you. The dawn is not far away, and I would not have it find me idle. It may be I shall see you no more. My work here is done; the long red trail is ended. The man of blood is dead. But there be other men of blood, and other trails of revenge and retribution. I work the will of God. While evil flourishes and wrongs grow rank, while men are persecuted and women wronged, while weak things, human or animal, are maltreated, there is no rest for me beneath the skies, nor peace at any board or bed. Farewell!"**

Potter's parents are forced out of their home for defying government regulations and end up on an agricultural commune under assumed identities. They are killed while Mandella and Potter are staying with them by raiders looking for food. Needless to say, the two re-enlist in the Army and get off that Crapsack World.
-   **Un Lun Dun** by China MiÃ©ville's defies this trope. At the end of the book, the protagonist Deeba is told that she has to return permanently to her home in mundane London because travel between London and UnLondon is too difficult to allow her to return. Her response is to burst into laughter, systematically list all the people in the book who've traveled back and forth between the two along with how easy it was for them to do so, and say, "Of course I'll come back!"
-   Five of the seven books in **The Chronicles of Narnia** involve the heroes being sent back to England in the end. Averted in **The Horse and His Boy** because the main characters were natives, and subverted in **The Last Battle** where they were Dead All Along, so going back wasn't an option.
-   **A Wrinkle in Time** has this with Mrs. Who, Mrs. Which, and Mrs. Whatsit.
-   At the end of the first part of **Thus Spake Zarathustra**, Zarathustra tells the group of followers that have gathered around him "Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves, and only when you have all denied me will I return to you." He does, indeed, return.
-   At the end of the Star Trek Expanded Universe novel **Kahless**, the original Kahless tires of his life as The Emperor and decides to leave. His subjects ask him where he will go. Deciding to play up on their myths of him (mostly so they'd leave him be), he points to a random star and tell them to look there. 1500 years later, they do.
    -   The whole point of the novel is demystifying the figure of Kahless and showing him as just a man. In fact, the whole idea of forging the first bat'leth from his own hair dipped in lava was merely a dream he had. He promptly makes a sketch of the weapon and takes it to a blacksmith.
-   Star Wars Legends:
    -   Obi-Wan Kenobi's Force Ghost continued to advise Luke Skywalker for a while after **Return of the Jedi**, but he eventually moves on to the afterlife, much to Luke's sorrow.
        
        **Obi-Wan:** Not the last of the old Jedi, Luke. The first of the new.
        
    -   Obi-Wan's Force Ghost does make two more appearances in the **New Jedi Order** series. First, to congratulate Luke on the birth of his son, then to celebrate the defeat of the Yuuzhan Vong.
    -   In **Star Wars: Kenobi**, the living Obi-Wan defies his character role as The Drifter by **not** leaving at the end of the story, even though it would be the simplest solution to the problems caused or aggravated by his arrival. Instead, it's his love interest Annileen and her family who leave, because Obi-Wan has to settle in as The Hermit to watch over the infant Luke Skywalker. Annileen's shock and dismay when he tells her that he can't go with them play out similarly to a scene of the Drifter saying he can't stay in town.
-   In **Warrior Cats**, several characters do this, most notably Cody, Shortwhisker, and Snookthorn.
-   In **How To Say Goodbye In Robot** by Natalie Standiford, Jonah does this. After the death of his handicapped twin brother, he leaves for good. He even makes sure nobody can find him by taking all pictures of him post-puberty and putting his baby picture in the yearbook.
-   In **The Divine Comedy**, Virgil, being one of the damned, must return to Hell at the end of **Purgatorio**. Dante does not take this very well.
    
    **Virgil to Dante:** Await no further word or sign from me: your will is free, upright, and whole.
    
-   When deciding whether to stay Trapped on Draconica, Ben tries to Take a Third Option and go home but use his power to travel between worlds to visit Draconica, but Dronor says he has to take that power away. After thinking about his worried sick mother and encouragement from Erowin he decides to go home. It **is** understandable why he chooses to go back but why he has to choose at all is less so. Its a dampener on an otherwise unambiguously happy ending.
-   In **Alan Mendelsohn, the Boy from Mars**, the title character has to return to his home planet in the end.
-   In the 1980s **Care Bears** book **The Trouble with Timothy**, Friend Bear explains herself this way to Timothy. "I'm your friend, your snuggly, furry friend. In fact, that's my name, Friend Bear, and I come from the land of Care-a-lot. I'll be around as long as you need me, but when you don't need me so much, I'll be on my way."
-   Due to her conscience conflicting with the group decision, Johanna Reyes leaves Amity in **Insurgent**.
-   In the canonical form of the legend of St. George and the Dragon, George refuses all offers of rewards for liberating the town and saving the princess, and instead rides away right after the whole town has been baptized. This does not apply to the many popular adaptations in which St. George marries the princess (which is out of place for a true saint).
-   The Cloud in **Loskutik And The Cloud** can't stay in the same place for very long, especially on the ground, so they have to leave in the last chapter, bringing a bittersweet tinge to the happy ending.
-   Inverted at the end of **Seekers of the Sky**. The protagonist Ilmar decides he can't follow Marcus (a possible messiah) where he's going and stays behind. The rest of the group rightly views him as a traitor, but he knows he's probably the only one who realizes that Marcus will never be a true messiah and will, at best, repeat the Redeemer's mistake (becoming a king of men rather than redeeming humanity in the eyes of God) and, at worst, become the Tempter.
-   **Forest Kingdom**: Rupert and Julia at the end of book 1 (**Blue Moon Rising**), because Rupert is **not** gonna be king, and no way is Julia gonna stay around for an Arranged Marriage with Harald.
-   In **The Light Jar**, imaginary friends always leave when they're not needed anymore. After Nate finds his mum, his childhood imaginary friend Sam leaves, although Nate begs him to stay.
-   Justified in The Murderbot Diaries. At the end of the first novel, the humans whose lives Murderbot saved buy it off the company and offers it a place on Preservation. However Murderbot would legally be required to have an 'owner', even of the token kind, and it also resists trying to fit in with a human society according to how they believe it should act, so Murderbot runs off instead. It does eventually return to Preservation however, but on its own terms.
-   At the end of **Together with Kirby**, the flower that had been growing on Kirby's head has turned into a seed head and tells Kirby its puffs must now be scattered on the wind to see the world. However, one puff takes root just outside of Kirby's house.
-   **Goblins in the Castle**: In the final chapter of **Goblins on the Prowl**, once they have the Black Stone of Borea, Edrick and Sophronia announce that they're planning to go to another world and take the Stone with them, to keep it away from evil wizards who would seek to use it.

But Now I Must Go Example in Live-Action TV

-   Used straight in **The Adventures of Pete & Pete**. In the two-parter "Goodbye, My Little Viking", Little Pete parts ways with his best friend and personal superhero Artie (the Strongest Man - in the world!), who realizes that he is no longer needed more, and sets off to find a new kid who does.
-   **Angel**:
    -   Parodied when Wesley joins the cast in "Parting Gifts". Wesley pretends he must do this, while secretly hoping to be invited to stay, but Angel and Cordelia play along with the pretense.
    -   Later played straight in "You're Welcome" when Cordelia comes back for one last guest spot, gets "her man back on track", then basically says "now everything's going to be OK, a pity I won't be here to see it since I must move on". It's more Tear Jerker in the show than that description, obviously.
    -   Also Lorne's final fate in the post-series comics.
-   **Arrow**: A few in quick succession in the season 7 finale.
    -   In the flash-forwards, the older generation of heroes decide to take the blame for the damage done in the course of saving the city, meaning they have to go on the run. But they know the younger generation will keep the city safe without them.
    -   Oliver and Felicity decide to move out to a small town where Felicity can give birth and they can be safe from the villains hunting them. They plan to return eventually, but the Monitor shows up to call in Oliver's deal. Oliver needs to come with him to help save the universe, and he will inevitably die during the coming Crisis. Oliver tearfully says goodbye to Felicity and their infant daughter. Partly averted because the Monitor uses Time Travel to allow Oliver to spend some time with his grown-up children and to properly say goodbye to them.
    -   Back in the flash-forwards, Felicity says this is the last time she'll see her children. They're confused since she's been on the run before and managed to stay in touch. She says it's different this time. She then meets up with the Monitor, who warns her she won't be able to come back from where he's taking her. She accepts that and just wants to see Oliver again, and they walk through a portal.
    -   Later on, Lyla uses a device the Monitor has William build, before telling John she has to go and steps through one of the Monitor's portals. However, she comes back at the end of the episode in a new outfit, claiming that she's Harbinger now, moments before the sky turns red.
-   Also the default for **The A-Team**, as they couldn't stay in one place too long without being caught by the military.
-   In the final episode of **Battlestar Galactica**, Adama does this rather abruptly. Starbuck jumps on the bandwagon and immediately ascends to a higher plane of existence.
-   On **The Daily Show**, when a longtime correspondent or contributor leaves the show, they receive a farewell, which includes a montage of amusing moments during their time. In 2015, before then-host Jon Stewart himself left the show, Stephen Colbert came back and humorously complained about how he didn't receive such a send-off, playing a self-prepared montage.
-   In Diablero, Mayaken feels that he's a monster and he doesn't deserve a happy home with Keta, so he tells her that he'll come back to her when he's had time to figure things out and flies off.
-   The Doctor from **Doctor Who** shows something of this; he saves the day, and then leaves again, never staying. It's been suggested in the show this is because he's afraid to look back at the trail of destruction he leaves behind â€” or, more humourously, because he's worried about being asked to pay for the collateral damage he's caused.
    -   A strange subversion of this trope is used in the Doctor's regeneration in "The Parting of the Ways". He tells Rose he'll still be there, "but not like this. Not with this daft old face."
    -   He is forced to face the consequences of his own actions a few times, such as in "Bad Wolf", which takes place a century after "The Long Game". Instead of freeing Earth from the tyranny of the Jagrafess, his actions result in a complete shutdown of the government, followed by decades of chaos before an even worse example of tyranny takes hold, forcing people to participate in deadly games and others to watch them.
-   **Game of Thrones**: Benjen leaves Bran and Meera at the end of Season 6 as the Wall has magic spells carved into it which prevent the undead, and by extension him, from passing.
-   No matter how much the people he interacted with wanted him to stay, **The Littlest Hobo** would always leave at the end of the episode. As the show's theme song sums up: "There's a voice...that keeps on calling me...down the road, that's where I'll always be..."
    -   Spoofed in an episode of **Corner Gas**, and Hank wanted Hobo to stay in Dog River. When Wanda explains that leaving when the trouble is over is what Hobo does, Hank wants to stir up more trouble to get Hobo to come back.
-   Chef Gordon Ramsay sometimes has this effect on **Hotel Hell** or **Kitchen Nightmares** when he's finally fixed the restaurant or hotel, but the owner(s) wish he could stay longer.
-   In **Legends of Tomorrow**, several characters leave the show in this manner. Some of them return for a brief time, though. For example, Jax leaves the show halfway through season 3 after Stein's death. He returns for the season finale and reveals to have a wife and a daughter now. Rip also leaves the team in the season 2 finale... only to come back in the season 3 opener, revealing that he has set up a new Time Police agency to replace the defunct Time Masters. Amaya has always been aboard on borrowed time, knowing she would have to return to the 1940s eventually in order to ensure the existence of her granddaughter Mari.
-   Used quite a lot in **The Lone Ranger**, as he goes off into the sunset...leaving grateful townsfolk behind, wondering, "Who is that Masked Man?"
-   One episode of **The Mandalorian** has the titular character arrive in a small town that's coming under attack from raiders, and he agrees to teach them how to defend themselves and help them fight off their enemies in exchange for room and board. As it goes on he bonds with a woman there, they clearly have some feelings for each other, he wants to stay, she wants him to stay, The Child is happy there... and then a bounty hunter arrives gunning for them. He realizes he needs to keep moving to keep him, The Child, and the village safe, and so he bids them farewell and flies off toward the sunset.
-   Power Rangers did this a few times:
    -   **Power Rangers Turbo**: The Phantom Ranger makes this sort of exit. He does it again in **Power Rangers in Space.**
    -   **Power Rangers Time Force**: The rest of Time Force does this to Wes in the finale, going back to the year 3000.
    -   **Power Rangers Wild Force** ends with Princess Shayla taking the Animarium back into the sky. While that may have been necessary, not allowing Merrick, who loved her, was from her own time period, and had nothing in the present, to stay with her was not.
    -   **Power Rangers Mystic Force** does this with Nick, in keeping with his entrance as The Drifter, but uses a version of The Lady's Favour to show he intends to return soon.
-   In the final "Adventures with Bill" segment of **The Red Green Show**, Bill reveals he's found love with a nurse and is moving out of the Possum Lake area to be with her. He and Red spend a last few moments remembering their time together before he hops in her car and heads out on what Red dubs "the biggest adventure of his life".
-   Played in **The Secret Circle**, as Jake does this after saving Cassie, though he soon returns.
    -   Diana does the same in "Family" since she's lost her father and can't handle having dark magic.
-   In **Supernatural**, the Winchesters are constantly moving on to their next hunt, even if there are some cases where they meet someone who might inspire them to want to stay longer (Cassie Robertson, Sarah Blake, Lisa Baerden, etc.)
-   This is the default ending for most of the **Ultra Series**, as the Ultras are assigned to Earth from their homeworld and when their tour of duty is complete, they must return. In **Ultraman** and **Ultraseven**, this was given further meaning, as they were badly hurt and they couldn't be healed on Earth.
-   **Van Helsing (2016)**:
    -   Early on in Season 5, Doc parts ways with Julius and Axel so that she can finally be reunited with Jolene and ride off into the sunset with her.
    -   In the series finale, Ivory leaves Jack to scour the Earth for other surviving members of the Sisterhood.

But Now I Must Go Example in Music

-   "I'll Follow the Sun" by The Beatles
    
    **And now the time has come and so my love I must go**
    
-   "Heard It in a Love Song" by the Marshal Tucker Band.
-   "Free Bird" by Lynyrd Skynyrd.
-   "Sous le Vent", by Garou and Celine Dion.
    -   **Fait comme si je quittais la terre / J'ai trouvÃ© mon Ã©toile / Je l'ai suivie un instant...**
-   Janelle MonÃ¡e's song BaBopByeYa.
-   Led Zeppelin's "Ramble On"
-   Scot-Irish traditional song "The Parting Glass" doesn't make it clear whether the singer is dying, or simply leaving forever:
    -   **So since it falls unto my lot/ that I should rise and you should not....**
    -   The same goes for "Loch Lomond", in which the singer is most definitely dying. **Me and my true love shall ne'er meet again...**
-   "Farewell" by Gamma Ray is a clear example.
-   The Allman Brothers Band, "Ramblin' Man." "When it's time for leavin', I hope you'll understand..."
-   Supertramp: "Goodbye Stranger, it's been nice/Hope you find your paradise..."
-   "Back on the Road Again" by REO Speedwagon.
-   "The Stranger Song" by Leonard Cohen: "He'll say one day you caused his will // To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter // And then taking from his wallet // An old schedule of trains, he'll say // I told you when I came I was a stranger".
-   **Kids Praise**: The end of the second album has Psalty tell the kids that he needs to go visit other kids, but that he'll see them again.
-   Tom Petty's "Time To Move On".
    
    It's time to move on, time to get going
    
    What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing.
    
    But underneath my feet, grass is growing.
    
    It's time to move on, it's time to get going.
    
-   Zucchero: The theme of "Il Volo" (The Flight) tells about Zucchero's Love Interest needing to go elsewhere and thus preparing to bid him farewell. Over the course of the song, the poor man tries to convince her to stay, because he needs someone to bring light to his life.

---
But Now I Must Go Example in Myths & Religion

-   **The Bible**: After His resurrection, Jesus says goodbye to His disciples and returns to Heaven.
    
    **Jesus:** "In My Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also." (John 14:2)
    
-   After Paul Bunyan was beaten by a man with a steam-powered chainsaw in a tree-cutting contest, he and Babe the Blue Ox packed up for the Alaskan wilderness, realizing the era of the lumberjack was drawing to a close.

---
But Now I Must Go Example in Professional Wrestling

-   Haystacks Calhoun was an attraction for the athleticism which seemed to clash his enormous girth and was an overall nice guy beloved by fans and other wrestlers alike, except for bullies and trouble makers that he tended to show up to make fools of. But when that was done, he tended to depart, leading his role to be called a "traveling face enforcer".
-   This was used to even greater effect by AndrÃ© the Giant in the 1970s and early 1980s. Andre spent most of his career under contract to Vince McMahon, Sr. and the WWF. McMahon realized that having a guy on the roster whose gimmick was utter invincibility would quickly get boring, so Andre spent most of his time wrestling in other territories, often coming to the aid of a babyface who had been injured by a heel contingent. After the score was settled, Andre went to his next destination.
-   The Gimmick of Nikki Saint John for a while, who was on a quest to wrestle in every state of the union.

---
But Now I Must Go Example in Tabletop Games

-   **Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition**: Artifacts are intelligent and self-motivated and will inevitably disappear to find a new owner. If the owner has been worthy, the artifact generally leaves with some kind words after they've shared a significant victory. If not, it might ditch them at the most inopportune moment.
-   **Exalted**
    -   There is a charm, **Hero Rides Away**, that rewards heroic-themed Solar Exalts for doing this.
    -   For the heroic Abyssals, they must do this even if they want to stay. Otherwise, the folks they just saved will be hit by an ultra-lethal death-wave, or worse.
-   This is implicitly part of the vows of the Brettonnian Grail Knights in **Warhammer Fantasy**. They are sworn to never sleep in the same place two nights in a row, so whenever they complete a quest, they are invariably required to leave in search of a new one, until the day when they either fall in battle or are judged worthy of drinking from the Grail.

---
But Now I Must Go Example in Theatre

-   This is merged with And the Adventure Continues for Willy Wonka in the West End musical **Charlie and the Chocolate Factory**, in what amounts to a Not His Sled twist on the ending of the source novel. In the book, Charlie won't inherit the factory until he comes of age, but here he becomes the new owner **immediately** and after a wild celebration, the boy and his family realize Mr. Wonka has already left ("Looks like he's left you to it"). After they enter the factory to begin their new lives, Mr. Wonka â€” concealed in the King Incognito disguise of an elderly tramp (who was last seen in Act One encouraging Charlie to buy the Wonka Bar that turned out to contain the last Golden Ticket) â€” appears and reveals to the audience that he is moving on to other worlds, such as **theirs**, to continue creating wondrous things now that he is no longer tied down to the factory. With that, he vanishes into thin air...
-   **Hamilton** features the song "One Last Time", dramatizing George Washington's decision to step down as president, as noted in the real-life folder.
-   The opera **Paul Bunyan** ends with the unseen title character bidding his friends goodbye, saying that he has to move on now that they have succeeded in taming the wilderness:
    
    All I had to do is done,  
    You remain but I go on;  
    Other kinds of deserts call,  
    Other deserts whisper Paul;  
    I must hasten in reply  
    To that low instinctive cry,  
    There to make a way again  
    For the conscious lives of men.
    
-   **Peer Gynt** invokes the trope in running away from every responsibility and his true love in the process.
    
    I have a heavy burden to shoulder, I must carry it alone. You have to wait for me.
    
-   In **L'Orfeo**, Hope can guide Orpheus to the gates of Hades but no further, and when he presses on she returns to her usual abode.
-   **HereLiesLove**: Ninoy Aquino's "Gate 37" is his farewell song (to his family and the audience) before he is assassinated.

But Now I Must Go Example in Toys

-   Mata Nui in the conclusion of **BIONICLE** after having completed his destiny.

---
But Now I Must Go Example in Visual Novels

-   **Akai Ito**: In the end Tsuzura must go, because she lives in a completely different world from Kei. She even enforces a Laser-Guided Amnesia to make sure it sticks! But if Kei's love for her is strong, she will overcome this amnesia. It's actually rather jarring because, in one of her non-true endings, she actually transfers into Kei's school because she loves her a lot.
-   Multiple characters do this at the end of **Daughter for Dessert**:
    -   Saul after getting the protagonist acquitted at his trial.
    -   With his nameless mention in Double Homework, it is clear that Mortelli does this as well.
    -   Lily will eventually leave the diner to travel around again. In her own "bad" and "neutral" endings, she leaves alone, but in her "good" ending, the protagonist travels with her.
-   **Double Homework**:
    -   Subverted with Dr. Mosely/Zeta. After telling the protagonist that heâ€™s in the clear, taking Dennis to his fate, and assuring the protagonist that he wonâ€™t see her again, Zeta returns to the ski lodge after learning that he knew too much about her experiment.
    -   Played straight with Dennisâ€™s dad. After questioning the protagonist for details on Dennisâ€™s death, he promises not to contact him again out of respect for his supposed friendship with Dennis.
-   Two of the endings in **Saya no Uta** don't really count, since the eponymous character had completely uncontrived reasons for leaving Fuminori in the asylum ending, and was killed in battle in one of the other endings. However, in the remaining ending, Saya becomes ill and dies after just having killed Kouji. We know it's meant to be depressing and cynical, and we know this is what leads up to the worldwide plague of mutation spores, but she seemed perfectly fine up until that point, and nothing was ever mentioned that she would die after fulfilling her biological purpose of reproduction.
-   Kinoko Nasu loves doing this to his characters, apparently:
    -   Saber in **Fate/stay night**, in a tear-jerking scene in which she finally confesses to the protagonist that she loves him, right before vanishing forever. Although in the True Ending of Fate in Realta Nua, it turns out that Saber and Shirou are reunited in Avalon after his death, as long as their hearts and feelings are still connected and they're willing to wait for one another.
    -   Archer does this at the end of **Unlimited Blade Works**, as well as Saber in one of the endings.
    -   Several endings in the first storyline of **Melty Blood** have female protagonist Sion Eltnam Atlasia leaving the town for various reasons, generally to continue her research on curing vampirism. Just about the only exception is the ending where she and Akiha bond. Shiki ponders cutting himself.
    -   In the original **Tsukihime**, it happens to Arcueid in her route. And since the anime is based primarily on the latter, it features this as well. Made extremely jarring by the fact that literally the only difference in her two endings are whether she thinks she can restrain her vampiric impulse. Her "True End" fits this trope and is quite moving. Her "Good End" has her instead laying low until enough of her power returns to resist the impulse, and sticking around.
-   The Bad endings of **Yo-Jin-Bo**, usually thanks to the pendant taking Sayori back to her own time in spite of her wishes. In Jin's Bad ending, he beats it to the jump, taking off without even waiting around to get paid.
-   Done by Rin Tezuka and Lilly Satou in their bad endings from **Katawa Shoujo**. Rin transfers from Yamaku to an art school in Tokyo to pursue her artist career, though she's aware that this will emotionally wreck her in the process; Lilly goes to Inverness (Scotland) to rejoin her parents, who left her in the care of her older sister Akira as a child but now want to retake their broken family bonds (Lilly doesn't want to leave her quiet but happy life in Yamaku, but she **really** wants to reconcile with them.).
    -   Additionally, in Lilly's Good Ending, Lilly stays with Hisao after he pulls an almost fatal Race for Your Love... but Akira and her boyfriend decide to go to Inverness instead.
-   **Tales of Asteria**: After the events of the main story, Tirug decides the world of **Asteria** no longer needs his help or protection, and decides to leave for the next world that might need him.

But Now I Must Go Example in Web Comics

-   **Everyone Is Home**: At the end of the "Reviving Characters" arc, Isabelle 2 claims that since her work is done reviving the Smashers murdered by Sephiroth, she has to return to Buttville, and she and Isabelle 1 are shown to have had a very tearful goodbye.
-   At the end of **Joyce and Walky!**, which ended the **Walkyverse** as a whole, Dorothy, who spent the last story arc possessed by Head Alien, and was modified into an abductee, decides to go with Joyce and Walky's Kid from the Future Bobby to the future, citing that her family was dead and her business failed, so there was nothing tying her to the present, and that she felt she could do a lot more in the future with her superpowers, especially since the Martians had returned in the future. It's probably for the best anyway, as Bobby was only able to suppress Head Alien's influence in her mind, and there was always the chance he could resurface. Bobby...is okay with this.

    "Hello friendbeast, I'm 15 years old now. I have chewed, licked, and humped everything I was put on this Earth to chew, lick, and hump. For now, I must die."
    
-   Surprisingly for Creepypasta, a few of them pull this off:
-   The **SCP Foundation** tale "Quiet Days" depicts the organization disbanding after all the weird phenomena they'd been keeping under control suddenly vanish, leaving them with no further purpose.
-   Vegeta leaves with Nappa, Raditz, Buzzkill, and Mufasa at the end of **Ducktalez 7**, as he regained his confidence.

-   Deconstructed in **Red vs. Blue** where Epsilon decides to leave with Carolina to investigate Freelancer equipment without saying goodbye to Caboose or Tucker. The next two seasons show the results of this, as Caboose spirals into a depression and latches onto a very dangerous Mantis assault droid as a replacement for Epsilon and Tucker becomes very bitter and angry at Epsilon for essentially abandoning them and constantly clashes with the latter when they are reunited. Epsilon later admits it was a jerk move to do to his friends.
-   Captain Disillusion used to end his videos by realizing some far-off event needs his attention and saying "But now it's time for me to go, kids."

But Now I Must Go Example in Western Animation

-   **Amphibia** ends with Anne, Sasha, and Marcy, the three human girls who lived in Amphibia for months, parting ways with all their loved ones there and returning home to Earth permanently, as they have no way of coming back there once they leave.
-   Numbuh One chooses to leave in the Grand Finale of **Codename: Kids Next Door** to join the Galactic Kids Next Door.
    -   Also done to a degree at the end of **Operation: Z.E.R.O.**; Numbuh One's dad Monty Uno, the titular Numbuh Zero, allows his restored memories to be re-erased as part of the plan to destroy Grandfather, and beforehand destroyed the Recommissioning Device so Numbuh One can't re-restore them. As Monty says in a recorded message, he did it because, "â€¦I'mâ€¦just not a kid anymore. I'm an adult. And I have the most important mission of all; Being a good father to my son." In this case, Monty's not physically going anywhere, but removed his Numbuh Zero identity as part of this trope.

    -   From the very beginning of the series, it's made clear that Luz will eventually have to go home to her mother at the end of the summer no matter how attached she may grow to her new friends and loved ones on the Boiling Isles. The series ultimately subverts it though, as while Luz does go back to Earth after Belos' defeat, she still has ready access to the Demon Realm thanks to the Collector building a new portal door and remains in constant contact with everyone before eventually moving back to the Boiling Isles full time after graduating from high school so she can attend Eda's new University of Wild Magic.

-   **The Simpsons**
    -   Parodied in "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show", where this is the extremely poorly-done manner in which the hated Poochie is Put on a Bus out of the "Itchy And Scratchy" cartoon, from out of nowhere. Apparently Poochie is an alien. And his home planet needs him. And he dies on the way back. Afterwards, Krusty and a lawyer make it clear that he is never, **ever** coming back, much to everyone's delight...with the exception of Homer, his voice actor.

        Don't think it's sour grapes,
        
        But you're all a bunch of apes,
        
        And so I must be leaving you!
        
    -   In "The Homer They Fall", Moe of all people does this: After hijacking a one-man propelled flying machine to save Homer from being beaten to mash in a boxing ring, he says goodbye to the Simpsons, telling them that he needs some time to think over everything and then takes off with said flying machine. The epilogue reveals he is doing charity work all around the world. This is all the more surprising considering we're here talking about... well... Moe.
-   **Steven Universe: Future**:
    -   In the episode "Little Graduation", Lars and the Off Colors decide to return to space to explore various planets and meet new people across the galaxy.

    **Chief:** Kemo **who**?

But Now I Must Go Example in Real Life

-   George Washington: served two terms as President, then retired. The precedent he established protected the United States from strongman rule for more than a century afterward.
    -   In fact, it wouldn't be until Franklin Roosevelt served four terms as president (he died in office during his fourth) that the government felt it was necessary to add a "two-term limit" stipulation for the president to the constitution.
    -   During their last week, the departing president typically delivers a farewell address to the nation.
-   The letter anime director Satoshi Kon wrote when he learned he was dying of cancer ends with the phrase "Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go". The Japanese phrase used has the connotation of someone apologizing for leaving the office before everyone else is ready. This only adds to the Tear Jerker quality of the farewell.
-   Inverted at many graduation ceremonies. Many a commencement speech can be boiled down to "But now, YOU must go."
-   Taken to nations range during World War II for the Americans and the Soviets. After pushing the Nazis all the way back to Germany, most coalition soldiers only stuck around long enough for the fires and shooting to stop before redeploying to the Asian theater of the war, where they did it again after Japan signed its capitulation treaty and left only a token force there while the rest went home.
-   Dave Della Terza, the creator of the infamous **American Idol** snark blog Vote for the Worst, gave this as his reason for shutting down the site in 2013. By that point, the show's ratings were circling the drain (it would only last another three years afterwards), so as far as he was concerned, he and others like him had effectively won in terms of shining a spotlight on all the show's flaws and making it impossible to take it seriously, and there was no point in kicking a dead horse any further.
-   Há»“ ChÃ­ Minh wrote in his will that he's "leaving a few lines so that, should I go to meet with Karl Marx, Lenin, and other predecessor revolutionaries, my countrypeople, Party comrades, and friends everywhere would not feel it so sudden" because he was already 79 with a heart condition (which was what ultimately killed him) when people weren't expected to live past 70.
-   Academy Award\-winning visual effects artist Carlo Rambaldi gave this as the reason for his retirement in 1989, citing his belief that advances in CGI had rendered his line of work obsolete.
