Cuckoo Finger Twirl: 
"This bird, the Aracuan — he's _meio maluco_, a very stupid fellow."

**Dr. Mystico:** I saw that!!  
**Freakazoid:** What?  
**Dr. Mystico:** _That!_ You think I've got a clock in my head, don't you?!

So there's something _off_ about a person in the room. Perhaps the person is a blatant Cloudcuckoolander, a pretty blatant example of The Mad Hatter or The Loonie. Perhaps the person is spouting some blatant Insane Troll Logic or some Cloudcuckoolanguage. Maybe the person has a history of being disturbingly Ax-Crazy or is just voicing how much a macabre subject appeals to them as a clear Nightmare Fetishist. Maybe the person is just a clear oddball because they voice and do things that set them apart from their peers.

Whatever the reason, the wonders of nonverbal communication make voicing one's belief that you or someone else is a complete nutjob easily possible. Just perform one gesture: Point to your own head, and twirl your fingers in a circle. Simulating as if a cuckoo clock is going off in someone's brain. The gesture is often accompanied by a two-note whistle imitating a cuckoo clock noise and the person imitating spiraling Wingding Eyes with a Maniac Tongue for added effect.

Details can vary, using different fingers when pointing at different things, but this is how you generally tell someone that you think someone in the room is a crazed loon or is going through some clear Sanity Slippage. Though generally an insulting gesture due to deeming someone as having poor mental health, it is known to have at times been used in a friendly or reassuring manner as well; communicating something to the effect of "_They're a total weirdo_" in an accepting tone.

Other gestures with the same meaning include tapping the side of the head or the forehead.

Compare Batty Lip Burbling, another gesture indicating madness.
