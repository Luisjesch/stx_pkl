A Love to Dismember: 
That is _not_ how you give...never mind, too late now.

_"That right hand of yours... I've got it displayed in my bedroom. I go to sleep with it every night. Doesn't that make you hard?"_

A character has a... physical relationship with a severed body part of some sort, taken off some person. This is about the most pleasant way of putting things — for obvious reasons, this trope induces some _very_ heavy Squick, and is usually a sign that the character in question is _severely_ disturbed.

See also I Love the Dead, Mummies at the Dinner Table and some examples of Body in a Breadbox. Sometimes combined with Out with a Bang for added Squick. Often overlaps with but isn't quite the same as Creepy Souvenir. Alas, Poor Yorick is the non-sexual version of this.

A Love to Dismember Example in Anime and Manga

Examples by creator:

-   Manga artist Suehiro Maruo loves this trope, especially concerning eyeballs.

Examples by work:

-   A slightly less insane example from **Battle Angel Alita**: at a spare body parts shop, Yugo spots the hand of his deceased brother killed some weeks before by a hunter-warrior, that world's bounty hunters. He convinces the vendor to **trade** his brother's hand for his own, arguing it's younger and will fetch a better price, thus having his brother's hand attached to himself as a keepsake.
-   **Berserk**:
    -   Rakshas is the latest in the new Band of the Falcon/Hawk. He jumped to Griffith's aide only to state that he will protect him as long as he gets to have his "beautiful head" when the time comes to kill him.
    -   When Griffith was imprisoned and tortured for a year for the crime of sleeping with the princess of Midland his tongue was cut out which, as the torturer reveals to Guts and crew, he had kept as a keepsake around his neck before he taunts them by perversely licking Griffith’s severed tongue like he was tongue kissing it in a moment of depravity. Unfortunately, he says this right to Guts, who is already in Tranquil Fury mode, and it is the last thing he does before he smashes his BFS straight through the door of Griffith's cell and straight through him.
-   At one point in **Black Cat**, Creed, Train's Stalker with a Crush, tells Train that he would at least want to have Train by his side even as a dead body rather than let Saya have him.
-   **Black★Rock Shooter** has a pretty mild version. Yomi gives Yuu a friendship bracelet made from her hair. Then she starts trimming it in class. It'd be more disturbing if it was something like skin or nails, but still...
-   **Blood+**:
    -   Threatened, but not really acted upon when James promises to bring Solomon (post Heel–Face Turn) the severed head of his love "to kiss."
    -   Mentioned in the manga as well, where a villain promises to bring Van Argeno the lower half of Saya's body. Argeno is less than pleased.
-   Barus of **Clover** severs Kazuhiko's hand, telling him when next they meet that he's been sleeping with it every night. "Doesn't that make you hard?"
-   In **Code Geass**, Mao decides he wants to take C.C. to a "quiet, white, immaculate, special house" he built in Australia. Unfortunately, to get to Australia, he needs to take her on a plane, and she's apparently too big to bring aboard, so he's going to have to make her compact. Cue him revving a chainsaw. Mind you, C.C. does have a Healing Factor, so being "made compact" won't actually **kill** her. Of course, in some ways, that's even **worse**...
-   **Deadman Wonderland**: During an interrogation scene between the two, Genkaku licks some blood from Nagi's arm while saying that Nagi's hand has become very cute (after Nagi's hand was cut off by Hibana).
-   Wietoo from the manga **Eden's Bowy** milks this one for extra mileage. After an artificial human 'puppet' he builds rips his younger sister into pieces and splatters them over the room, Wietoo is seen first cuddling, and then passionately kissing, his sister's severed head. Later, he uses her retrievable body parts to make a new 'puppet' which he continues to sexually molest at intervals.
-   One Depraved Homosexual villain from **Inuyasha** threatens to cut off Miroku's face, make it into a wall hanging, and kiss it every day.
-   Yoshikage Kira from **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable** is a Serial Killer who has a fetish for women's hands but is uninterested in everything **else** about women. His usual M.O. is to kill a woman, cut off her hand, and then carry it around with him and treat it as a girlfriend — complete with dinner dates and romantic walks.
-   The body part in question isn't **quite** severed, but in one chapter of **Nightmare Inspector**, a man bricks his wife up in a wall, killing her. Her rotting hand and forearm, however, still jut out from the wall, and the man stays with them and talks to them at times.
-   Miranda Barma of **PandoraHearts** is Yandere for Glen's/Oswald's head.
-   **Peacemaker Kurogane**:
    -   Suzu recovers the head of his beloved Yoshida (who was decapitated during the Ikedaya Incident), who he was implied to have a crush on. He has it varnished and carries it around, in a affectionate way, while talking to it as if Yoshida were still alive. He also lays seductively with the skull at times while dressed skimpily and licks his master's skull in the cd drama in a moment of depravity while longing for him.
    -   In chapter 24 of the sequel manga, Itou orders Hijikata to have "Kondou-kyokuchou beheaded in apology for betraying me", and then tells him that he'd "like that idiot's head to be given to me to do with as I please".
-   In **Requiem of the Rose King**, Richard kisses his father's severed head on the lips.
-   In the **School Days** anime, at the end, Kotonoha cuts off Makoto's head from his corpse, and carries it around. The final scene shows her cradling it in her arms on a yacht, saying, "we're finally alone together, Makoto".
-   The Ghoul Karao "Torso" Saeki from **Tokyo Ghoul :Re** is called like that for the body part he takes home with him. His apartment is shown to be filled with the headless, limbless corpses of women. He likes to cuddle with them, and refers to one as his "lover". After he's forced to go on the run, he notes that it's hard to sleep without a cold body beside him. When he kidnaps Mutsuki (whom he has a stalker crush on) in chapter 64 he cuts off his arms and legs and tells him they're going to get married while holding his arms and legs and saying with a Nightmare Face "I worked very hard for these!"
-   Rex Godwin of **Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds** worships his brother's severed arm, and 62 episodes in forcefully removes his prosthetic left arm in order to make his brother's arm his own.
-   **Zanuff the Butcher**: The titular butcher is a Serial Killer with an unhealthy obsession with dismembering pretty women. The thing is, he absolutely hates this part of himself.

-   The tale of "Isabella and the Pot of Basil" from **The Decameron** (and later on, a Keats poem) tells of the titular character preserving the head of her lover inside the aforementioned pot. 19th- and 20th-century depictions such as those painted by Prerraphaelites like William Holman Hunt, Waterhouse or John White Alexander<small>◊</small> fall squarely in this trope.
-   Seiji from **Durarara!!** is quite a bit obsessed with Celty's head. Then again, Celty **is** a dullahan... Shinra also has the hots for Celty's headless body. His father makes depraved sexual comments in regard to Celty's headless appearance.

He's pronounced not guilty, and he wonders whether he could ask to have the hand back. Cage and Fish had mostly weirdo clients.
-   In **Dexter**, the Ice Truck Killer is referred to as having chosen not to kill a hooker when he realised she was an amputee. She says that he "started worshipping it (her fake hand)" and did "some freaky stuff with it (as well as her stump)". Given his obsession with dismemberment, it is implied that he may have used the parts of his victims for this as well. It's later revealed that they are lingering issues from his mother's death and dismemberment by a bunch of gangsters with a chainsaw. He's Dexter's big brother Brian.
-   The **Doctor Who** episode "Love & Monsters" has a variant on this, in that the main character's girlfriend is attacked by a monster which leaves her as a just a concrete head (but still alive) — yet it's stated that they still have a "love life". Interpret it however you will.

-   Tom Lehrer's song "I Hold Your Hand in Mine" from the album **Songs by Tom Lehrer** is sung by a man about his love's hand, which he cut off of her the night she died.

    But till they come to get me I shall hold your hand in mine!**

A Love to Dismember Example in Mythology and Religion

A Love to Dismember Example in Video Games

-   Dr. George Greggs, the operator of the Organ Replacement Lab in **Dead Space**'s Fourth "Misplaced Affection" Webisode, kept Jane Gauthier's fingers with him while he was locked up in his lab. At the end, he is seen stroking them, and when he is killed by the necromorphs that break in, his severed arm and her fingers mutate and become connected. CECL-RC notes the irony in Greggs' wish to forever be with Gauthier; because of the Necromorphs, the two will always be together "in sickness, though not in health".
-   Happens in **Dragon Age II**. Hawke investigates the disappearance of several women who disappear either completely, or only part of their remains are found. It's revealed that the abductor/killer sends the victim white lilies before abducting them. Not too much later, Hawke's own mother Leandra disappears and Hawke him/herself finds white lilies that were delivered.

-   In **Final Fantasy XIV**, Edda removes the head of her fiance Avere from his grave and travels with it around Eorzea. The pages of her diary you can find around Tam-Tara Deepcroft indicate she seems to fluctuate between believing the head is still alive and knowing it's dead but being unable to let go due to feeling responsible for his death. Despite this the same pages also indicate her and the head shared "intimate" moments. Eventually, due to the influence of the voidsent in Tam-Tara she seems to meet this in the middle and treat it as alive as well as understanding that she needs to make it a new body to be whole. The results aren't pretty.
-   **Lollipop Chainsaw** is a game about making zombie-killing look Sickeningly Sweet — which is why our zombie-hunting cheerleader protagonist Juliet Starling saves her boyfriend Nick from an infected bite on the arm by severing his head and keeping it alive with "a magic ritual". She then proceeds to run around with his magically animated head dangling from the back of her belt, occasionally using it as a weapon. That's the sort of thing you get in a Suda51 game.
-   The Soldier from **Team Fortress 2** has a collection of severed heads of his enemies who he talks to. He is devastated when he can't find his heads anywhere, and even more so when he thinks they have been disposed, letting out a Big "NO!" in the process.

A Love to Dismember Example in Visual Novels

-   **Fate/stay night**: In Bad End #01 of 40, Ilyasviel kills Shirou and rips his head off, while casting a spell that makes him unable to die unless his head gets smashed, and takes him home to do God knows what. This is what you get for not accepting Saber's offer to be her Master.

A Love to Dismember Example in Web Original

-   Lucy Lacemaker from **Satellite City** repeatedly mentions her desire to decapitate her colleagues (mainly Winifred, Wexle, and Hyzenthlay) and play with their bodies, and in the case of the latter, even draws very detailed illustrations which she then shows to her. Given the fact that the Kivouackians can apparently survive being decapitated and dismembered without any lasting harm, this might be more or less creepy than the usual version of this trope.
