Cop Hater: 
Police officers are (in theory) responsible for enforcing the law, keeping the peace, and stopping criminal activity from growing out of control. However, some people just don't like or trust the cops, either being very afraid of their presence or outright hating them with a burning passion.

There are many reasons why a person dislikes law enforcement:

-   They've been arrested for a crime they did not commit.
-   The punishment outweighed the crime that they committed.
-   The Police Are Useless, corrupt, or even evil, being hardly any better or different from criminals themselves.
-   They were a victim of Police Brutality or otherwise suffered serious violations of their civil/human rights.
-   They believe that the cops are nothing but prejudiced assholes, and may find any reason to arrest or attack them simply because of their race/ethnicity, being poor, or other attributes.
-   The police are agents of a government that is extremely corrupt, oppressive, or both. The cops are only there to serve a morally-bankrupt state which neglects the needs of common citizens at best, or brutally represses them for any perceived dissent at worst.
-   Someone they love gets (rightfully or wrongfully) arrested/attacked/killed by the police, and said person may or may not have gone through at least one of the above, which results in them being very wary around cops because of what the other person went through.
-   They're anarchists or libertarians who hate the law and/or the state itself on principle, and thus distrust anyone whose job entails enforcing the state's power over citizens. They'll often cite any of the above examples of police officers (and other government employees) abusing their authority, in order to justify their disdain for them.
-   If they're not motivated by political ideology or legitimate grievances about police misconduct, then it may just come down to them being an actual criminal who simply resents the cops for arresting them in the first place.

Most of the time, their views are at least somewhat justified, but sometimes it's nothing more than pettiness and/or paranoia. Often times, they'll have a grudge towards _all_ law enforcement, even those who are good and have not wronged this character.

This hatred may be used to outline the character's backstory, possibly a Dark and Troubled Past that explains why they despise the police in the first place.

Note that if a character hates the police because they arrested them for breaking the law, then it would only count if the punishment for the crime was unjustified, as it's obvious that criminals would hate the police for doing their job correctly. If a character hates the cops because someone they knew was the one arrested, then it still counts since, while they're not the ones being arrested, their experience with someone they care about being incarcerated will sour their overall opinion on the law, even if that character was a legitimate criminal.

See Anti-Police Song, a type of Protest Song that's specifically about hating the police. Closely related to, but shouldn't be confused with Cool People Rebel Against Authority, as "fuck the police" is often used as a rallying cry against authority in general. Said character may be The Paranoiac. Can overlap with Rage Against the Legal System if the character tries to take direct action against law enforcement and Cop Killer if this trope is their main motive for killing police officers. Particularly hardboiled examples have been known to sport Knuckle Tattoos with the slogan "ACAB", short for "All Cops Are Bastards" (which has become a much more popular phrase ever since the Black Lives Matter protests that happened all over the United States in the summer of 2020 following the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor at the hands of police).

No Real Life Examples, Please! This is Truth in Television, but we don't need to start any arguments about the competency of law enforcement.

Cop Hater Example in Comic Books

-   The minor **Batman** villain Wrath has a similar origin to Prometheus (see below), but predates him; his parents were thieves that a young Jim Gordon was forced to kill after they drew their guns, earning him Wrath's hatred. Wrath tried to convince Batman that Gordon killed his parents without provocation, but Bats refused to believe it.
-   **JLA (1997)**: The supervillain Prometheus has an intense hatred of the police due to his origin story, which is the inverse of that of Batman. His parents were two hippie spree killers, and he traveled across the United States with them until they were cornered by local law enforcement and were gunned down after opening fire on the surrounding police. This traumatic experience caused his hair to turn white, and he vowed to "annihilate the forces of justice" in order to get revenge for his slain parents.
-   In **Runaways**, the titular team is generally anti-cop, because the cops used to be on the payroll of the Pride. Later members Victor, Xavin, and Klara aren't too fond of cops, either, since Victor and Xavin were tortured at the hands of S.H.I.E.L.D. during **Civil War (2006)** and Klara hails from a time when the cops harassed immigrants like her with impunity.
-   In **The Spirit** (and its film adaptation), Sand Serif has a hard-core hatred of cops because one of them killed her (small-time crook) father. For Denny Colt (who had a father in the police force and became a cop himself when he grew up and he still helps the police after becoming the Spirit) this was (and still is) more hurtful than he wants to show.

Cop Hater Example in Music

-   This is a recurrent theme in rap and hip-hop music, especially of the more politically conscious variety, mainly due to police misconduct against black communities. As shown in the page quote, the song "Fuck tha Police" in the album **Straight Outta Compton** by N.W.A, a song protesting against Police Brutality and racial profiling of minorities.
    -   Several artists ranging from Gangsta Rap legend Boosie Badazz to mellow Jazz Rap producer J Dilla have at different points recorded their own songs titled Fuck The Police.
-   KRS-One has his famous hit "Sound of Da Police" ("Woop, woop / That's the sound of da police! Woop, woop / That's the sound of Da Beast!"), which details how cops are the direct successors of slavecatchers and plantation overseers. In a mildly disturbing chain of events, cops have been known to love the song.
-   As ubiquitous in Punk as in Hip-Hop, stated most plainly by Folk Punk band Wingnut Diswashers Union in their song "Fuck Every Cop (Who Ever Did His Job)"

Cop Hater Example in Web Original

-   **@dril** is obsessed with cops. In his telling, they constantly brutalise him with over-the-top violence in response to mild infractions like saying "mummies are made out of diapers" at the museum, or torture him by making him look at a man putting mustard on a bagel. He claims cops breastfeed criminals with gigantic fake boobs filled with milk, but later retracted this comment to include 'only some' of them. At the same time, he also worships cops, thinks they should be dual-wielding guns, and thinks they should have the right to torture him freely.
-   dado, a recurring problem for the **SCP Foundation**, dislikes police because they keep assaulting his consumer base (i.e., everyone) and created a special donut shop (designated SCP-5740) to express it. The donuts produced by SCP-5740 are normal for civilians, but if a policeman eats one the donut causes them to excrete a live pig a few hours later.

Cop Hater Example in Western Animation

-   **Arcane**: Everyone in the Undercity hates the Enforcers whose very appearance as Gas Mask Mooks, besides making them look inhuman, rubs it in their faces of the enormous wealth disparity as people from topside don't want to breathe the poisonous air in the underground that locals have to breathe every single moment and reinforces that the Enforcers act more like an occupying foreign force. The Enforcers are brutally violent to the locals and treat all of them as criminals. Vi and Powder especially hate them for killing their parents as part of a failed uprising.
