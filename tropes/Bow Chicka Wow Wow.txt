Bow Chicka Wow Wow: 
**Tucker:** Did somebody call for a really hairy plumber? Bow-chicka-bow-wow!  
**Church:** Tucker! Shut up.  
**Tucker:** I came here to lay some pipe. Bow-chicka-bow-wow!  
**Church:** Tucker!

"Bow Chicka Wow Wow" is the sound of a character beatboxing porno music, based on the funk-rock soundtracks that many '70s pornos are believed to have had. This is usually done after the character has seen or heard something lewd. Or sometimes simply imagined something lewd. The 1970s was the golden age of porn, when the best films had big budgets, scripts and plots. The late 1970s films used the funky, soul-infused disco that was a huge fad at the time. The trope imitates the wah-wah-pedal "chicken scratch" electric guitar figure that was popular in this style of pop music.

-   **Black Canary And Zatanna Bloodspell**: Black Canary and Zatanna are looking in the window of a toy store that's displaying Justice League of America action figures. Zatanna teases Black Canary by temporarily animating the Black Canary and Green Arrow dolls and making them talk to each other:
    
    **Zatanna:** I love toys. Look who's in the window!  
    **Black Canary:** Oh, those. We okayed those to be sold for charity. The profits go to victims of supervillains.  
    **Zatanna:** Uh-huh. **\[magical sparks go from her finger to the toys\]**  
    **Green Arrow Doll:** Hey, pretty bird. I ain't seen you around the Barbie aisle before.  
    **Black Canary:** I guess you were on reserve when we made that deal.  
    **Zatanna:** I'm not bitter. Bount-chicka-bount-bount.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  
    **Black Canary Doll:** Hey yourself, Robin Hood. Is that an arrow in your quiver or are you just happy to see me?  
    **Zatanna:** **\[gets punched in the shoulder by Black Canary\]** Ow!

Bow Chicka Wow Wow Example in Live-Action TV

-   Rachel from **Friends** does this in "The One with the Free Porn", apparently unaware of what she's singing. She eventually asks what it is that's been in her head all day and is told that it's the theme to **Good Will Humping**.
-   **Mystery Science Theater 3000**:
    -   Done by the bots whenever the dialogue in a movie suggests a porn film segue.
    -   Also inverted: they add "sexy dialogue" when the music resembles this. (It was really the music of all low-budget '70s films, at least until the porn association became codified.)
-   **2 Broke Girls**: "...and the Dumpster Sex" has Max thinking it was "Brown Chicken Brown Cow".
-   An episode of **Bones** has Booth explain what Bow-Chicka-Wow-Wow Boom-Clicka-Mow-Wow means to Bones
-   Any time the scene style is 'porn' or simply 'filled with LUST!' in **Whose Line Is It Anyway?**, which of course makes it into the Spiritual Successor **Drew Careys Improvaganza** in a big way.

Bow Chicka Wow Wow Example in Music

-   **Shorthand Phonetics** literally has a track called "Bow-Wow-Chikka-Wakka-Chikka-Wakka-Chikka-Wakka, Bow-Wow-Chikka-Wakka-Chikka-Wakka-Chikka-Wakka"
-   Referenced by way of pun on Trace Adkins' "Brown Chicken, Brown Cow".
-   Mike Posner has a song called this. Surprisingly, it's about mood music. The video even resembles a '70s softcore porno.
-   "Cheeka Bow Bow" by The Vengaboys.
-   The Argentine band Cumshot main source of inspiration is the aforementioned Bow Chicka Wow Wow soundtracks of the 70's porn flics. It's up to the listener if this is Stylistic Suck or a funny and inventive whole new playground for ambient music.
-   Swedish europop singer Gunther, on the other hand, is undoubtedly a parody.
    
    **"You touch my TRA-LAH-LAH! My ding-ding-dong!"**
    
-   The Fitnessgram Pacer Test soundtrack contains a number of examples, especially in the earlier stages.
-   "Oh Yeah" by Yello is a popular alternative for shows and movies (most famously **Ferris Bueller's Day Off** and **The Secret of My Success**) who want to license a particular song for scenes like this. It even uses the onomatopoetic sounds in question, albeit not in that order.
-   The entire gimmick of the band Pornosonic is to play music like this, with each song listed as the theme from a different non-existent porno film from the 70s (Ron Jeremy even provides fake soundbites in between songs).
-   Meghan Patrick has a song by this exact title.
-   In late 2023, the PornHub Community intro theme was discovered to be a licensed track called "Beats Me". Cue just about **everyone** making porno jokes in the comments.

Bow Chicka Wow Wow Example in Video Games

-   In **Destroy All Humans! 2**, both Orthopox and Arkvoodle use the expression, with the latter speaking it in a deep voice.
-   **Devil May Cry 5**: Nico can be heard doing the "Bow Chicka Wow Wow" porn music riff after Nero saves a naked Lady.
-   **Guitar Hero III: The Legends of Rock** includes an unlockable bass guitar called "Boom Chicka Wah Wah". If you listen closely, this tune plays before you play any career encore in the Mitch's Moose Lounge venue (which is a strip club).
-   Approximately a week or so before the **Wrath of the Lich King** expansion came out for **World of Warcraft**, Thrall, leader of the orcs, disappeared from his chamber for a few hours. The official forums proceeded to speculate on what he was doing and where he was during that time. This led to many responses simply saying "Jaina", but the absolute best was in response to one of these, where the poster simply wrote "Bow-chicka-lok-tar".
-   Perhaps taken to a literal extreme with the D Si Ware game **Spotto!**, where the titular bird character must rescue a hot chick by the name of "Chikkie Wowwow".
-   When breeding sheep in **FarmVille**, your sheeps' sprites in the pen will be replaced with a sign reading "Baa chicka-wow wow!" while they're, um... busy.
-   **Abobo's Big Adventure**: "Bow Chicka Wow Wow" appears on screen as a form of censoring while Abobo is having his way with Annie the mermaid. Too bad we can't see how he managed to avoid The Mermaid Problem...

-   **Red vs. Blue**:

    -   Caboose hilariously attempts to say Tucker's catchphrase. The result:
        
        **Caboose:** Hey-chicka-bump-bump!  
        **Tucker:** Caboose! What did I tell ya about that?!  
        **Caboose:** Sorry! Sorry...
        
    -   Jeff Williams, the main music director for Rooster Teeth works, even made the catchphrase its own song in the soundtrack for Season 9.
