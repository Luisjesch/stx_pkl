Chummy Mummy: 
_Let me tell you about my buddy,  
He's 3,000 years old,  
He's wrapped in bandages and covered in moldy debris  
My undead mummy and me._

Not unlike their fellow undead brethren, mummies are commonly depicted as evil, malicious, or just plain scary. This is especially the case if they were a Nepharious Pharaoh in life. However, this isn't true for all mummies.

Despite being shambling corpses with eerie glowing eyes and covered in aging bandages, some mummies are benign and harmless. Depending on the work, a mummy of this nature may even be downright jovial or outright heroic. Why a particular mummy, or mummies, acts friendly varies. Some were quite sociable in life and remain so in (un)death, while others started out mean in life but mellowed out after their death and mummification. While still overall rarer than other fun and helpful undead characters, it's become more common to see relatively harmless mummies in fiction.

A Sub-Trope of Mummy and can overlap with Seductive Mummy if the mummy in question is also female. Compare Friendly Ghost, Friendly Neighborhood Vampire, Friendly Skeleton, Friendly Zombie, and Wonderful Werewolf.

Though he turns out to be a nuclear physicist and thus is unable to help Adèle, Professor Espérandieu's ritual is so strong that when it revived Patmosis, it ALSO activated ALL the mummies in the Louvre. Adèle therefore seeks them out in order to find the real doctor to help her sister. They eventually decide to see the sights of Paris.
-   **Night at the Museum**: A mummy's magic stone tablet brings all the statues and other displays to life at night.

A **newly awakened** mummy is near-mindless, superpowered monstrosity driven to protect its tomb by any means.
