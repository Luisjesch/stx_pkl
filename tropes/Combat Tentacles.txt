Combat Tentacles: 
_"I'm warning you, I'm armed... Eight-armed, that is! Uwee hee hee!"_

Tentacles used for combat. More specifically, throwing cars at people or strangling them or impaling them or crushing them. They may also be used as (somewhat oversized) whips or bludgeoning weapons, as a tentacle is basically a flexible mass of muscle, and as such can impart a lot of force.

This may also happen with elephants' trunks, or with the whole bodies of long-bodied creatures like snakes and worms. Combat Tentacles are frequently utilized by Stock Ness Monsters and, of course, Cephalopods. Possibly because of the unusual nature, the association with strange creatures like squid, this is commonly a power associated with evil characters or at least dangerous animals that the protagonist needs to beware.

Often a form of Lovecraftian Superpower.

A Sister Trope to Tentacle Rope, Typical Tentacle Tactics, Multi-Armed and Dangerous, Spider Limbs, Partial Transformation, Tail Slap, Tentacled Terror and Tendrils of Darkness.

Compare Prehensile Hair and Vine Tentacles, which are often used this way. Can fall under Bizarre Alien Limbs.

Combat Tentacles Example in Anime & Manga

-   **.hack//SIGN**: The Guardias, buggy Freudian nightmare monsters from a Virtual Reality MMORPG who not only stab you with their tentacles, but put you into a short-term coma in real life.
-   Tetsuo from **AKIRA** develops these as his Power Incontinence grows, cranking up to Lovecraftian Superpower levels as the anime progresses.
-   Koro-sensei from **Assassination Classroom** has lots of tentacles that, while quite soft, can deal some damage, although anything can cause damage if you smack it at your opponents at Mach 20. The tentacles are usually used for more mundane things, though.
    -   Itona, who claims to be Koro-sensei's brother, has the same tentacle cells implanted on his head, although he loses them later on because the tentacles made his mind unstable.
    -   Kayano is later revealed to have also taken the tentacle serum, and joined Class E to avenge her sister by killing Korosensei, whom she mistakenly believes killed her. However, like with Itona, the tentacles threaten to take over her mind, until she is saved by Korosensei and the rest of the class.
-   There's a ninja in **Basilisk** who does the same thing as Wilhelmina. In fact his hair is so strong that when it gets turned against him he ends up suspended in a doorway with all his limbs shattered.
-   **Bleach**:
    -   Luppi's Flower Motif is the ivy. As a result, when he releases his power, he gains eight powerful vines that can be used as tentacles to capture, crush or punch his enemies. They can also manifest spikes on the end for clubbing an opponent and filling them full of holes at the same time. This power is played straight with him as he's an antagonist.
    -   When Yumichika is willing to release his Coverblowing Superpower, his zanpakutou transforms into a mass of vines that capture the enemy. The vines function by way of Energy Absorption to kill the opponent. By means of Vampiric Draining, it can then use the stolen Life Energy to healing any wounds Yumichika may have received in battle. Yumichika's Flower Motif is the lily, and his vines are full of lilies that collect the stolen spiritual power. Lilies are symbols of death, rejuvenation and beauty. Despite the power, Yumichika's actually a protagonist and not a villain.
-   In **Bungou Stray Dogs**, H.P Lovecraft's ability is the generation of tentacles through his hand. It is later revealed that he is, in-fact, a Lovecraftian monster.
    -   A vine variant also appears with Lovecraft's partner, John Steinbeck, though he tends to use his vines for restraint more than for combat.
-   Sugiura from **Call Me Tonight** becomes a non-hentai tentacle monster whenever he gets turned on.
-   Several of the Awakened Beings in **Claymore**
    -   Riful of the West is nothing but these in her Awakened form. She **actually** uses them for...other things, tough.
    -   And she is not the only one either. Standard Youma often spring spear-like tentacles from their hands, and then there is former #2 "Red Blood" Agatha, first seen in Scene 75.
-   In **Code Geass**, Knightmare Frames generally have rocket propelled "Slash Harkens", which are knives/anchors on retractable cables. Its spin-off, **Nightmare of Nunnally**, however, has Mark Nemo, whose rocket propelled Blonde Knives... float in mid air when they aren't being used, as hair-like tentacles. Zero's cape does likewise.
-   One of the first monsters encountered in **Devil & Devil** is a weird-ass tentacled monster. These tentacles' main use is to suck time out of their victims, reducing them to cute, helpless infants. The monster can, however, use the tentacles to attack its foes directly. It was offed very quickly though, returning its victims to normal.
-   In an interesting variation, Lucy from **Elfen Lied** visualizes her telekinetic powers and those of other mutants in the form of long translucent arms. To normal people they are completely invisible, simply causing everyone who gets to close to her to seemingly randomly explode in a fountain of blood.
-   The Maguar from **Figure 17 Tsubasa & Hikaru** fall under this trope, being as their tentacles are in all cases their primary means of defending themselves.
-   Pride of **Fullmetal Alchemist** is a Living Shadow / Eldritch Abomination who can form endless amounts of "shadow tentacles" which he uses to rip people apart.
    -   Sloth from the first anime frequently turns her arms into liquid tentacles used to drown or immobilize people.
-   The Benizakura from **Gintama**, wielded by Okada Nizou before fusing with his arm like a parasite. He first takes advantage of this by strangling Matako when she talks out of turn. And then later on it gets worse.
-   **Haruhi Suzumiya** has Ryoko turning her arms into energy tentacles when fighting against Yuki.
-   The giant fairy/slime nautilus is the sixth episode of **Humanity Has Declined** uses this. Not that it has much choice, being a nautilus and all.
-   Naraku from **Inuyasha** mainly fights by turning parts of himself into a mess of these to immobilize, crush, impale or outright devour his foes.
-   Played with in **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure**. It's played straight with the Vampire Bruford and his ability, "Dance Macabre" (which he controls with turgor pressure) and Yukako Yamagishi, with her stand Love Deluxe which is bound to her hair, both of whom use them in direct combat. Played with the Pillar Man Esidisi who can use his blood vessels to surround his foes or inject his boiling blood into them.
    -   In Part 3, Joseph Joestar's Stand ability, Hermit Purple can be used like this. So can Noriaki Kakyoin's Hierophant Green, which maintains a human form most of the time but can unravel to form a cluster of tentacles at will.
-   **Kekkaishi** has Princess, a kitsune whose nine tails can be used in this fashion. She's even seen nearly mummifying opponents in them on occasion. Made even more formidable in that they can grow to a huge size.
-   **KonoSuba:** From the **Legend of Crimson** movie, Sylvia as a Growth Chimera can create tendrils that protrude out of her skin.
-   One of the magical creatures in **Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's** had these, as did the Book Of Darkness since it absorbed its Linker Core.

-   When the demonic Yuragi of **Mahou Shoujo Ai** aren't using their tentacles for... other things, they're breaking bones and punching holes in people with them.
-   Several Mechanical Beasts from **Mazinger Z** sported Combat Tentacles: Stronger T4, Megaron P1 and its "siblings", Gumbina M5... Needless to say, so did other Robeasts from **Great Mazinger** and **UFO Robo Grendizer**. And in **Shin Mazinger Zero** Juzo Kabuto.
-   In **My Hero Academia**, Mezo Shoji's Quirk, Dupli-Arms, allows him to grow tentacles that can replicated extra parts of his body.
    -   Among All For One's many Quirks is Rivet Stab which causes his fingers to turn into long tentacles of red and black and can be used for combat as well.
    -   Daigoro Banjo, the fifth user of One For All, had the Quirk Blackwhip, which can release black energy tendrils that he can use to bind up enemies or swing across skyscrapers. It is inherited by Izuku, who can use it well after few months of training.
    -   The anime-exclusive villain Innsmouth has a Quirk that gives him the powers of an octopus, which include this trope most prominently.
    -   Tamaki Amajiki for most of his battles transforms his fingers or hands into octopus tentacles to trap his opponents.
-   Shikamaru from **Naruto** has his "Shadow Sewing" Jutsu, which is basically shadow tentacles. And let's not forget his Shadow Neck Bind. And, of course, Kakuzu has the ACTUAL physical version of these, being basically a human ragdoll.
    -   The host of the 8-tailed demon, an ushi-oni, or, in layman's terms, an ox combined with an octopus, can use this battle style in his fully released state but he seems more fond of spitting out a giant blast of chakra. However, he does often do "partial transformations" where he just has one or a couple tentacles sprout from his body.
    -   After partially mastering the Kyuubi's chakra, Naruto can use the chakra cloak to form arms for use in forming the Rasengan and its variants, eliminating the need for multiple clones.
-   Shadow type magic in **Negima! Magister Negi Magi** acts in this manner: creating physical darkness in the form of black tendrils which violently cut things, which one shadow-user Kagetarou used to slice the titular character's right arm clean off. Being that they were in a magic world which had advanced medicinal techniques, he had it re-attached. Recently, a shadow mage has appeared who's so powerful he's capable of pulling Haruna's Cool Airship out of the sky (along with several others). It's explicitly compared to Cthulhu.
-   Several of the Angels in **Neon Genesis Evangelion**. Shamshel has two tentacles instead of arms, Zeruel's "arms" are technically very long, sharp and flexible blades, and Armisael is essentially a giant, glowing-white tentacle.
-   Karasu from **Noein** has a power similar to Omega Red, where he has wires as extensions of his body.
-   Quite a few characters with substance-producing and/or manipulating Devil Fruit powers in **OnePiece** use these as part of their attacks. Donquixote Doflamingo, Charlotte Katakuri, Aramaki, amongst others use these heavily in their attacks.
-   The titular creatures from **Parasyte** turn parts of their bodies into razor-edge Combat Tentacles capable of slicing through humans like butter.
-   Pantyhose Taro from **Ranma ½**, whose Jusenkyo form is a two story-tall chimera that resembles a giant ox with wings and sasquatch arms, eventually added octopus tentacles to the mishmash. He can smash through concrete with these, either by jabbing their tips at people, or whipping them down like enormous flails. At one point, he used them to rip a bathhouse's smokestack in half.
-   **Reborn! (2004)**: Every opponent that Chrome fights uses these in some way. Mammon uses illusion tentacles, Glo Xinia uses a squid, Verde uses an octopus.
-   Used by the machine designed to implant Mr. Gentleman's consciousness into Junior at the end of **R.O.D the TV** to prevent the heroes from interfering with the process.
-   The **Sailor Moon** anime has the Makaiju tree, who uses its branches as this during the climatic fight against the Senshi. More than one Monster of the Week had similar attacks.
-   **Saint Seiya**: Specters of the Worm (such as Raimi, in the Sanctuary Saga) can use their Surplice's earthworm-like appendages to ensnare, whip, crush, or slice (with sufficient force.) A favorite tactic of this Specter is to burrow underground and let his tentacles burst up to entangle his foe, at which point he'll run a few more tentacles through the enemy.
-   In **Saiyuki**, Hakkai's demon form has vines that can be used this way, overlapping with Tentacle Rope.
-   In **Shakugan no Shana**, the eponymous Shana gets captured in Episode 13 by the twins using vines.
-   Medusa from **Soul Eater** has her "vector arrows" function half like Combat Tentacles half like a bunch of spears. Later in the manga, her son/daughter Crona develops these as a part of hir worsening Black Blood infection, with a bonus of creating poisonous thorns that infect people with madness.
-   Ika from **Squid Girl** has ten of those (she's a moe-fied squid girl). They are absurdly strong, faster than sound, can reach ludicrous lengths but are also precise to put a string into a needle. And they can regenerate just as fast.
-   Several Radam in **Tekkaman Blade** can spit tentacles. In part II, some of the alien Tekkamen have them as well.
-   In **Tokyo Ghoul**, the kagune of many Ghouls take the form of a tentacle. The Rinkaku type, in particular, have multiple tentacles that extend from their lower back and are noted for being a Glass Cannon with exceptional offensive strength.
-   In **Yu-Gi-Oh!: Capsule Monsters**, a group of Trents in the second episode use these on Yami and Celtic Guardian, strangling them with head-roots.

-   Though used more frequently in the Animated Adaptation, **Spawn** is capable of using both the chains that drape his bodysuit and the tendrils of his tattered, shroud-like cape as this. He particularly enjoys using his cape-tentacles to blind and smother his foes. It's eventually revealed he can do this because the costume is a living being in its own right, and the chains/tatters served a similar purpose for it before it melded to him.
-   **Spider-Man**:
    -   Spider-Man's nemesis Doctor Octopus has a harness with four super-strong robotic arms that he uses for battering and throwing objects and opponents. The claws on each arm can rotate like miniature sawblades. The comic writers go back and forth on whether or not he can remove 'em, though **Spider-Man 2** and **The Spectacular Spider Man** have them fused to his spine in a Freak Lab Accident, apparently for good. Too bad about that attitude adjustment the tentacles' software gave him.
    -   Spider-Man also has Dr. Smythe and son, creators of the "Spider-Slayers", as enemies. These always have multiple tentacles used pretty much the same as Doc Ock's. Even if built bipedal with two arms, Spider Slayers have hidden hatches to throw out extra appendages mid-battle, usually with some kind of trap, such as gas, electricity, webbing, etc.
    -   For a short time, Spider-Man had additional mechanical limbs created by Iron Man. Though not as long and flexible as Doc Ock's tentacles, they serve a similar function.
    -   A more minor Spidey foe is the Squid, who is essentially a slender, not especially bright, and organically tentacled Doc Ock.
    -   Venom and Carnage are also capable of using parts of their symbiotes as combat tentacles, as well. Carnage is particularly famous for it — while Venom usually sticks to the normal humanoid number of limbs, the Viler New Villain usually has a set of bladed tentacles deployed and ready to inflict... well... carnage.
    -   The Superior Spider-Man adds retractable spider-legs to his improved costume — unsurprisingly, given that he's the aforementioned Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man's body.

    -   **Supergirl: Cosmic Adventures in the 8th Grade**: Lex Luthor's ship ("the Mighty Lexsoar 7") is armed with metallic tentacles, forged from psycho-reactive metals. The more their prey struggles, the tighter they squeeze.
    -   **Last Daughter of Krypton**: Simon Tycho's synthetic androids are equipped with a kind of energy tentacle-like whips which coil around Supergirl's arms and legs during their fight. Similarly, Worldkiller Perrilus is armed with poisonous, razor green tentacles.
    -   **The Planet Eater Trilogy**: The titular world-destroying machine is equipped with several giant, four-pronged, orange tentacles that can digest anything into energy to power the central core.
    -   "The Unknown Legionnaire": When fighting the Legionnaires, the shape-shifting Proteans often grow multiple tentacles to tackle, seize and constrain their enemies with.
-   **Wolverine**: Omega Red's tentacles can bash and smash as well as transmit his "death spore virus" (its name changes from one appearance to the next, but he's got a fatal disease he's gotta give to victims periodically or it'll turn back upon him. It becomes his best weapon, though he doesn't appreciate it).
-   **Wonder Woman**:
    -   Vol 1: Adult Rykornians can use the thin long leaves of their birthing stalks to attack and bind intruders.
    -   **Wonder Woman: Black and Gold**: Eleanor's hair as a ghost turns to octopus-like tentacles, which she uses to fling Amazons away and wreck their ships before Wonder Woman finds her and her sibling's remains and tells her that her youngest brother survived being abandoned at sea long enough to be rescued.
-   **X-Men**: Thanks to fellow mutant Masque, Callisto's arms were altered into a set of multiple prehensile tentacles on both sides. She's unique in the fact that she generally used her tentacles to throw a barrage of knives in battle.

Combat Tentacles Example in Fan Works

-   Harry Potter has something like these in **A Black Comedy**: he learned wandless summoning and banishing spells so well that he can manifest up to six invisible "arms", which can be used to "levitate" (think Doc Oc walking on his tentacles), block spells with handy objects or simply throw them... though their main in-story use is poking Sirius in the eye in retaliation for dumb jokes.

-   **Alien in a Small Town**: The Jan's six-armed warrior caste is the most likely to actually be involved in combat, but we see members of the worker caste using their tentacles to fight during a mating competition.

-   **Hell's Children**: "Several bloody tentacles shot out from Offal's body and proceeded to rap around Z.Y.9.0 and drag him screaming like a child into the nightmare that was Offal. A moment and quite a few screams later Offal threw up a mangled and twitching robot body."

-   **Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten** has Desco, who mainly attacks with the tentacled creature on her back. She can attack directly with them, shoot beams from them, or temporarily detach it from her in order to transform it and attack enemies with them.
-   **Divinity: Original Sin II**: The "Tentacle Lash" Polymorph skill briefly transforms the user's arm into a tentacle to make one medium-range Unblockable Attack, which deals bonus damage and can inflict a status effect that prevents the target from using weapons.
-   Quite a few monsters in **Dominions**, what with it being the universal grab bag of mythologies it strives to be. Krakens, bukavacs, void lords, you name it. Oddly enough, aboleth ones are just for show - guess you don't really need base, squick weapons when you can turn brains into quivering goo at will.
-   **Donkey Kong Country Returns** and **Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze** feature the giant kraken-esque octopus Squiddicus in the levels "Stormy Shore" and "Irate Eight", respectively. His head remains in the background while his tentacles attack the Kongs throughout each level.
-   **Doom³**: The Commandos have tentacles they can use to attack you from a range. When they're not packing a chain gun.
-   The Broodmother from **Dragon Age: Origins** is stationary, but has four tentacles that can pop out of the floor to make life difficult for ranged characters. It also has a number of larger, thicker tentacles that it can use to grab anyone closing in melee. It then violently shakes them and vomits poisonous bile all over them.
-   **Dungeon Crawl** has the option of playing an Oktopode who can constrict up to eight oponents with these (though that is rarely a good idea). The spell Beastly Appendix can allso give you these.
-   The disembodied tentacles in **Ecco the Dolphin** that latch on and won't let go. Plus the giant octopus which sits on a ledge and slaps Ecco with a tentacle as he tries to pass.
-   **The Elder Scrolls**
    -   Hermaeus Mora, the Daedric Prince of Knowledge, possesses these. Unlike most of the other Daedric Princes, who take humanoid forms when dealing with mortals, Mora forgoes anything resembling a human for a pure Eldritch Abomination form of a mass of eyes, claws, and tentacles.
    -   **Skyrim**
        -   Hermaeus Mora appears in the **Dragonborn** DLC to personally kill two people with his tentacles, using the Impaled with Extreme Prejudice method.
        -   **Dragonborn** Big Bad Miraak wields a staff that summons tentacles from the ground, wields a sword that turns into a tentacle when he swings it, and randomly sprouts tentacles around him when he is attacked. Appropriate, given that he is a servant of Hermaeus Mora.
        -   Lurkers are a fish-like form of lesser Daedra that serve Hermaeus Mora. They have these both in the form of a stream of tentacles coming from their mouths and a stomp that causes poisonous tentacles to appear.
-   The Kraken of **Evolve** has these for its melee attacks. For bonus pain, they crackle with electricity and are tipped with bony hooks.
-   **EXTRAPOWER**: Among the repertoire of magic attacks that the pyramid witch Blackberry has available is the Call of Abyss spell, which summons a host of otherworldly tentacles to rise from the floor and thrash the foe. In **Giant Fist**, you get to be on both ends of this, either as Blackberry or against her in a boss fight.
-   In the **Fallout** series, the Mister Handy series of robot butlers have various tools attached to the ends of their metallic tentacles, including buzzsaws and blowtorches, which can be quite lethal in combat. The military version, Mister Gutsy, has machine guns and plasma throwers mounted on its tentacles instead.
-   Octopi and squids are recurring boss creatures in **Final Fantasy**:
    -   Ultros, from **Final Fantasy VI**, a recurring joke villain with an impeccable sense of timing.
        -   A writhing, sentient mass of tentacles which entangles the engine room of Figaro Castle and prevents it from returning to the surface. The tentacles can ensnare individual characters and drain their HP.
    -   The **Final Fantasy XI** playerbase has many bad memories of the Sea Horror, a 60+ monster that, while very beatable by most jobs at 75, almost always spawns when the highest level player in the area is around level 30. Fun times.
    -   Kraken, Fiend of Water in **Final Fantasy**, Xande's minion in **Final Fantasy III**, and one of the Four Chaoses of Memoria in **Final Fantasy IX**. He can even get critical hits for each of his eight tentacles in **Final Fantasy**.
    -   Octomammoth in **Final Fantasy IV**, which bars the waterway between Kaipo and Damcyan.
    -   In **Final Fantasy X**, Yunalesca has these in her second and third forms.
    -   More common occurences are creatures with tentacles-as-whips, such as Molbor and Ochu. However, they're more dangerous/annoying for the status ailments they can inflict than their tentacular assault.
    -   The Cloud of Darkness in **Dissidia Final Fantasy** has two tentacles attached to her, which she uses to strike at mid-range opponents.
-   Early promo shots and concept art for **Half-Life 2** featured translucent blue tentacles bothering the leads. The tentacles would've been the surface manifestation of a huge under-ground being bothering City 17. Ultimately it was decided that it just wasn't a fun opponent.
-   **Halo**:
    -   Flood Combat Forms. On the higher difficulties in the second and third games, they can insta-kill the Master Chief/Arbiter with a single swat.
    -   In **Halo Wars**, the enemy structures include Flood tentacles sticking out of the ground that will attack anything that comes close.
-   In **Justice League Heroes: The Flash**, some of the later enemies encountered are organic skull-robots with copious tentacles. However, instead of grabbing you, throwing objects, or other moves typical of this trope, they repeatedly slap you with them. It's surprisingly effective.
-   The final boss of **KickBeat** attacks you with tentacles. Some are accompanied by dark energy spears that appear in place of the power-ups that normally float over some of the mooks' heads in the other levels, and missing on a double-tap note will incur damage even if you destroy the tentacle with the first beat.
-   **Kingdom Hearts**:
    -   Ursula uses her tentacles for attacking (along with magic and a few other techniques) in four out of her five boss fights (excluding only her giant fight in the first game).
    -   **Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days** features the Tentaclaws, which at first seem like seperate enemies... but then it's revealed that they're part of the Leechgrave.
    -   **Kingdom Hearts III** has the Kraken assisting Davy Jones in his boss fight, attacking Sora and the party with its tentacles periodically. After clearing the world, Sora receives the Wheel of Fate keychain, which grants **him** this ability - its second Formchange summons aquatic copies of the Kraken's tentacles that lash out at the enemies around him as a finisher.
-   **League of Legends**: Illaoi fights mostly with summoned tentacles with her passive and skills.
    -   While not as physical, Vel'Koz does use his tentacles in all of his attack and ability animations.
    -   Post-rework Evelynn has a pair of long prehensile tendrils tipped with sharp points sprouting from her shoulder blades, called "lashers". She uses them for stabbing, whipping, and as a makeshift chair.
-   **Left 4 Dead**: The Smoker can lasso the Survivors with his **tongue** — or at least with something resembling one, as he has six, still using only one, in the sequel.
-   **The Legend of Zelda**:
    -   **The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time**: Morpha is a giant amoeba that poses as water until you get close and its tentacles getcha.
    -   **The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask**: Majora's final form, Majora's Wrath, has arms ending in long whiplike extensions that serve as its primary weapons.
    -   **The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker**: Kalle Demos, the second boss, is a giant Korok-eating plant that uses this with its vines to attack Link.
    -   **The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess**: Midna's Fused Shadow form has seven tentacles and a **pitchfork**.
    -   **Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity**: Guardians will use their tentacle-like legs offensively (unlike in their source game).

-   **Metal Gear**: The exoskeleton used by Solidus Snake in **Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty**, and Laughing Octopus in **Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots**.
-   **Super Metroid**: Phantoon has such tentacles but doesn't seem to actually use them in battle. This changed with its second appearance in **Metroid: Other M**.

-   **Nexus Clash**: Wyrm Masters are in the habit of conjuring acid-spitting tentacles from the ground and leaving them lying around to attack passers-by. When their patron god was on the brink of winning one Breath of Creation, the tentacles started sprouting **everywhere** without needing to be summoned.
-   **Phantasy Star Zero**: Octo Diablo. You can then turn one of his tentacles into a weapon yourself — but it becomes a rocket launcher.
-   **Pokémon**: Any Pokémon capable of using Vine Whip or Power Whip. Also Tentacool, Tentacruel, the Attack Form of Deoxys, and others — pretty much any Pokémon that has tentacles.

-   **\[PROTOTYPE\]**:
    -   Alex Mercer has this as a combat power, called the Whipfist. It is notably effective against helicopters, and has some particularly cool consumption animations.
    -   Tendril Barrage Devastator. Area of Effect combat tentacles!
    -   The Hydra enemy is just one giant Combat Tentacle that can split into three at its tip.
    -   Sgt. Heller from **\[PROTOTYPE 2\]** seems to specialize in his basic combat with tentacles (As opposed to his predecessor, who only had them as a Limit Break and whipfist, and used blades the rest of the time.) He gets rather...inventive with them.
-   The **Resident Evil** series has Plant 42 from the first game, the lickers from the second game (which like to use their blade-tipped **tongues** for this), and Nemesis from the third.
    -   Many enemies, like **Garradores** or **Gigantes** in **Resident Evil 4** sprout "tentacles" (Actually the Plaga inhabiting their body) when hit hard enough. Also, Plagas will randomly grow their tentacles out of an almost-dead Ganado. And **Resident Evil 5** gives us Uroboros which is basically nothing but a giant wriggling **mass** of Combat Tentacles.
    -   Osmund Saddler also uses one to kill Luis, and sports a different one during the final boss fight.
    -   An odd variant is the Bandersnatch in **Resident Evil – Code: Veronica**; it has only one arm, but that arm is apparently boneless, as it fails around like a tentacle and it can stretch out a considerable distance to either "slap" the player (a fairly damaging attack), or grab hold of the player's head and start trying to wrench it off their shoulders unless they can hammer on the buttons to wriggle free first.
    -   In **Resident Evil Dead Aim**, the Tyrant-091 has large claws and its fingers are large tentacles.
-   The Sarlacc in **Return of the Jedi** probably didn't get much to eat on Tatooine. **The Force Unleashed** has another one on Felucia, and that one has grown **much** bigger, slapping at you with arms 3 meters in diameter.
-   The first scene you witness featuring the kraken in **Return Of The Obra Dinn** centers on it gruesomely ripping a crew member in half, complete with horrific audio. You can learn from dialogue that at least one other crew member met the same fate. Others were strangled, thrown into the sea or crushed up against parts of the ship. Bizarrely, one person managed to get shot by the monster, as it grabbed a cannon just before it fired and repositioned it. Probably not intentional on the beast's part, but the game accepts "shot with a cannon by a terrible beast" as a valid answer for the man's fate.
-   **Rise of the Kasai** features this as a reoccuring boss type; tentacles from an underground monster will burst out in a large area and the player has to hack them apart one at a time. Some are thin grabbers, some are spiked with mace heads, some are armored, and one has a grasper, or possibly the creature's mouth.
-   A number of instances of these show up in **RuneScape**, including among others the roots of the Evil Tree, the bosses Har'Aken and Agoroth, and the god Zaros (albeit offscreen - you read about it in a book). Reading the book in question gives you a number of tentacle related abilities as well.
-   The Memory of Richard Grady, a boss from **Silent Hill: Origins**, has several tentacles hanging from the ceiling as Travis fights it. If you're too close to them, they'll loop around Travis's throat and attempt to strangle him. Also, in **Silent Hill 2**, the final boss does this as well, only with some kind of scorpion tail.
-   In **Skies of Arcadia**, the final bosses' most devastating attack involves you being paralyzed, lifted, and impaled by fluid tentacles and blasted by the creature fused with him.
-   Wash Buckler from the **Skylanders** franchise is an pirate octopus who can use his tentacles to whip enemies in front of him, roll forward and do a Spin Attack with.
-   **StarCraft**: The Zerg base defenses, Sunken Colonies, attack with a giant burrowing tentacle.
-   One of the Sai units in the game **Stormrise** can generate energy tentacles from their lower arms to clobber their enemies with. They can also learn to electrolute said tentacles, further increasing the damage they do.
-   In **Sundered**, the monstrous creatures which make up the Eschaton faction are basically nothing **but** writhing masses of tentacles wearing hooded robes and masks, so naturally many of them will use their tentacles to attack the protagonist in various ways. The boss enemy Dominion can combine its tentacles into giant fists and send them through magical portals in order to punch the protagonist from multiple angles at once.
-   **Super Mario Bros.**:
    -   Gooper Blooper in **Super Mario Sunshine**.
    -   Big Blooper in **Super Paper Mario**.
-   In **Super Robot Wars: Original Generation** (PS2): Judecca's Final attack uses this at the end.
-   Arguably, Mr. Game & Watch's Final Smash in **Super Smash Bros. Brawl**, when he turns into an octopus.
-   Ultimate Venom does this, though mostly in the **Ultimate Spider-Man (2005)** video game.
    -   Mainstream Carnage can also put you under wraps, though being much more Ax-Crazy than Venom (and given some of Venom's finer moments, **that's saying something!**) he's just as likely to make 'em pointy and impale you.

-   **Warframe** features Hydroid's ultimate, Tentacle Swarm, which summons several tentacles made of water to attack enemies.
-   The Magus in **Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning** can extrude a massive tentacle from his disc (yes, **disc**) to swipe across enemies' faces. The Marauder class may come under this also, as his arm can be mutated into a variety of goopy shapes, some more tentacly than others, but all quite nasty.
-   The Kayran in **The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings** is a mutant hybrid with disproportionately huge mouth tentacles attached to a smaller, crab-like body. It attacks by slamming these tentacles to the ground, using them to throw rocks and whipping them across the entire battlefield (allowing the player to grab hold with a quicktime event).
-   **The World Ends with You** has a Jellyfish Noise that will attack you (or your partner) with its tentacle to violate your HP. Says so in the description.
    
    "If you're not careful, that obscene tentacle will start violating your HP!"
    
-   **World of Warcraft** has more than one tentacled horror, although in general they stick to oversized humanoids for their dungeon monsters.
    -   Notable example would be the raid boss C'thun (a literal Giant Eye of Doom), who in addition to having a nasty one shot kill eye laser, spawns tentacles, eye tentacles that fire Eye Beams and giant versions of the two. One of the items he drops is the Vanquished Tentacle of C'thun, which allows the player to summon his very own combat tentacle to attack an enemy for a short time.
    -   While the attack on the tentacle has been sadly outleveled into oblivion, some people still use it for kicks.
    -   C'thun's spiritual ancestor, the unnamed Forgotten One in WC3, also spawned tentacles.
    -   Yogg-Saron, end boss of the Ulduar raid dungeon, also appears to use tentacles as weapons. It seems like there's a theme developing here around the Old Gods...
    -   Having noticed the popularity of the Vanquished Tentacle of C'thun, Blizzard introduced an improved version, the Vanquished Clutches of Yogg-saron. The concept's the same, but now it can summon 3 types of tentacles! One of them shoots acid.
    -   Continuing the tradition, the BFS Gurthalak, Voice of the Deeps, has the ability to summon a tentacle that will cast a very powerful Mind Flay on your target, sometimes more than once.

    -   The "Bull" has a tentacle it uses to grab its prey.

-   Especially common in **Mortasheen**, most notably with Malignus' homage to the Cenobites, Septacle, who also happens to be a toilet and Underfiend, whose tentacles are of both the combat and naughty variety.
-   **SCP Foundation**
    -   Sarkists are fond of using these.
    -   SCP-252 ("Humboldt Squid"). This small squid can use Mass Hypnosis to cause anyone looking at it to see it as a giant monster with up to 200 limbs, including suckered tentacles up to 5 meters long.
    -   SCP-299 ("Infectious Tree"). SCP-299 has vine-like tendrils that are up to 2 meters long. It uses them to grab its prey when they get too close to it.

---

-   **Dr. Dimensionpants**: several of the monsters Kyle encounters in the various dimensions have these.
-   Waterbenders in **Avatar: The Last Airbender** frequently use a form of this that involves surrounding themselves in water that they extend into tendrils (fittingly called the "Octopus Form"). And at one point, a waterbender actually uses vines as combat tentacles, by bending the water in them.
    -   In the sequel series **The Legend of Korra** we have Ming-Hua, who lacks arms altogether and uses water-tentacles in their place. However, this also leaves her vulnerable to lightning which is how she meets her end.
-   **Batman Beyond's** shapeshifting blob Inque uses this as her primary method of attack and they're stronger than steel, no less, though in some instances, her body usually slides into either one single, thick tendril or a plethora of them at once.
-   On **Futurama**, Bender's jointless arms can twist and coil as freely as tentacles, and are certainly strong enough to invoke this trope if necessary. Subverted in that he's more likely to use their enhanced flexibility to pick your pocket than kick your ass.
-   Nergal and Junior from **The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy** have retractable tentacles that can shock people with jolts of electricity and even mutate people by zapping them with red energy.

Combat Tentacles Example in Real Life

-   Many sperm whales have heavily scarred heads from fights with giant squids. However it's now believed that in most cases the squids don't have much of a chance of winning these fights.
-   Octopi have been observed to ambush sharks and kill them. Scuba divers also have to be careful not to stumble upon octopi. The result can be fatal to one or both of them. Pacific giant octopuses, the largest of all octopodes, make this one of their specialties, and have been known to wrestle with divers, grappling using their tentacles and even trying to remove equipment like regulators, diving masks and cameras from the humans they encounter!
    -   There's also the fact that some punch fish. The reasons why tend to vary but, sometimes, they might just feel like it or because that particular arm felt like it.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> It's also believed that they punch fish quite literally to punish them for misbehaving, or to make them back off from the octopus's territory!
-   Played straight with most species of Jellyfish and Anemones who line their tentacles with Cnidocytes (stinging cells) that deliver toxins into their prey. This system is so effective that they usually just wait for the prey to come to them.
-   An elephant's trunk functions very much like a tentacle in its muscle mechanics, and can be quite a dangerous weapon. It also makes for a very effective extra limb, and even a gentle shove using it is enough to knock a flimsy human to the ground, as this tourist who was dumb enough to stare one down quickly found out, though fortunately the elephant was content with just pushing him to the floor and wrecking the dinner table.
-   Constrictor snakes, such as boas and pythons. Their whole body will act as a tentacle to wrap around the body of the prey.
-   Almost all animals, including you, have millions of these as part of their immune system. Macrophages are a type of white blood cell, and though they look like the stuff of nightmares they are on our side. These real-life tentacle monsters grab hostile bacteria, devour them and disintegrate them with acid.
