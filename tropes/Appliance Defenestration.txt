Appliance Defenestration: 
_"If ever you're not satisfied with one of our tires, please feel free to bring it back.  
\[old woman throws tire through window\]  
Thank you."_

A Comedy Trope. There are few visual images that better convey a character's explosive anger with an alarm clock, videogame, phone call or TV set than said character hurling said object through a closed window. Crash!

Said action is most always viewed from the outside, only indirectly showing the violent pitch or punt that launches the object. It's funnier that way, especially if the appliance is illogically heavy. (See Offscreen Crash.)

While it usually applies to household appliances, other objects can also be featured, as long as someone is propelling them through the window.

Doesn't count if the character's main intention was to break the window; the focus of the destruction must be on the object.

Keep in note that throwing broken appliances like TV, video game consoles, laptops, etc out of the window in Real Life may cause injury or death to bystanders and pedestrians or damage vehicles below (along with broken shards of glass that follow); and the thrower of said appliance may be held legally accountable for any injuries and damages because of said thrown appliance. So Don't Try This at Home if you have a broken appliance.

Can be a form of Percussive Therapy and/or Percussive Shutdown in some cases.

Compare Agitated Item Stomping, Ring-Ring-CRUNCH!, Defenestrate and Berate, and Shoot the Television.

-   A 2018 commercial for DirecTV NOW shows a woman throwing several TV props out of her apartment window before ending by throwing her satellite receiver out.

We next see the young boy sitting in front of his monitor with a black eye, and the computer still loading the results. We then see a shot of the exterior of the house, and the computer monitor crashing through the bedroom window, and smashing into bits on the ground.
