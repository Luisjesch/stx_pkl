Adorable Abomination: 
Lovecraft has never been so adorable.

**Dr. Ray Stantz:** I tried to think of the most harmless thing. Something I loved from my childhood. Something that could never, ever possibly destroy us. Mr. Stay Puft.  
**Dr. Peter Venkman:** Nice thinking, Ray.

Eldritch Abominations are terrifying, incomprehensible, and just plain wrong (the clue's in the 'abomination' bit). There are very few people who'd cuddle up to Cthulhu, or sit down to a nice family viewing of _My Neighbor Tsathoggua_. There are some works, though, that prefer to make these soul-eating horrors from beyond space and time... kind of cute, actually. Maybe you want to add a little extra spice to your Magical Girlfriend show. Maybe you're really, really into Grotesque Cute, and want to extract humour or horror from the dissonance between your beastie's appearance and what it does. Maybe you want to tone down the horror in order to avoid traumatising and depressing the audience. Maybe you just feel that the various unknowable god-things that crawled from the Cthulhu Mythos got an unfair rep for their unfortunate little habit of visiting death and insanity on entire worlds, and you want to redress the balance. Whatever the case, you've now got one of these.

A helpful answer when someone asks "Why Did You Just Romance Cthulhu?". See also Cute Is Evil and Creepy Cute. Can overlap with Killer Rabbit. Usually a result of Cute Monster Girl and/or The Taming of the Grue. Might overlap with Humanoid Abomination or, if good-aligned, Benevolent Abomination. Compare/Contrast Eldritch Abomination.

Adorable Abomination Example in Advertising

-   Parodied in the "Sun Fizz" ad from Sprite's Obey Your Thirst campaign. A cartoon sun jumps off the label on a bottle of orange juice to tell about its great taste and health benefits... only for the mother and her kids to react as though an Eldritch Abomination had just entered their kitchen, and start running for their lives.

Adorable Abomination Example in Anime & Manga

-   **Carnival Phantasm** has Grail-kun, a Super-Deformed version of the Angra Mainyu-possessed Greater Grail. The pool of black mud under him is capable of defying gravity, and when asked for advice his solution to everything is a kitchen knife.
-   **Digimon:** Kuramon is, per the lore, born from condensed internet hate and desires to reach its final form so it can try to nuke mankind just because. But it looks like an adorable jellyfish creature first.
-   **Dragon Ball**:
    -   **Dragon Ball Z** has Majin Buu, especially his Fat Buu incarnation. He looks like a humanoid blob of bubblegum, has childish voice and personality, and a massive Sweet Tooth. He has also existed since the beginning of the universe and was an unstoppable force of destruction before being tamed to an extent by absorbing the Grand Supreme Kai.
    -   **Dragon Ball Super** gives us Zeno, the Omni-King who is the most powerful being in the multiverse and ruler of the twelve universes. How powerful? There used to be eighteen universes but he got upset one day. How adorable? He's the size of Goten, has a big head and innocent eyes, and at his very **worst** is Obliviously Evil due to being childlike in innocence. And after the time travel shenanigans of the Future Trunks Arc, there's **two** of him.
-   Rei and Kaworu from **Neon Genesis Evangelion** are both eldritch abominations who take the form of cute teenagers.
-   **Puella Magi Madoka Magica**:
    -   Kyubey is something of an inversion. It seems cute at first, but is actually a Starfish Alien with reality-warping powers and Blue-and-Orange Morality, that at one point **eats its own corpse**.
    -   Charlotte looks like a stuffed doll or children's cartoon character, but is just as nasty as any of the other witches, and her appearance marks a turning point in the series.
    -   Most familiars are small cute chibi things, but they're an aspect of their respective witch with many of their powers (albeit not as strong), and can become an exact copy of that witch if left alone. This is most apparent with Homulily's familiars in the **Rebellion**, seen doing lots of cute things in the background, although they cross into Creepy Cute at times.
-   Hazuki from **Tsukuyomi: Moon Phase**. A cute little girl, right? But when the moon comes out and she goes into Luna mode... bad things happen.
-   **Wasurenagumo** has a young girl who is actually the Cute Monster Girl daughter of a giant water-spider Yōkai. The Downer Ending is that she's just as evil as her mother and she ends up sacrificing her human "friend" to mom as a snack so she can then take said girl's form as her own and, from there, assume her place.

Adorable Abomination Example in Comic Books

-   **Ms. Marvel (2014)**: The Inventor. He's a clone of Thomas Edison who was accidentally contaminated with cockatiel DNA, with long cybernetic arms. Still, he has an adorable cockatiel face and big eyes.
-   **Survival Geeks**: The titular characters adopt a juvenile cthulhu, about the size of a dog, as a pet, and name him Howard. He's rather cute and lovable, even if he does occasionally try to eat them.

Adorable Abomination Example in Fan Works

-   **Oogway's Little Owl**: After following Taylor into the **Kung Fu Panda** world (with an unexpected detour through the Spirit Realm), and subsequently cut off from the rest of the Shard Network, Queen Administrator takes the form of a giant, bright pink furry tarantula, and due to the fact that she only **very** recently gained individuality, and anything resembling what we would call sapience, she has an extremely childlike mindset and way of speaking. The result is something that **should** be rather terrifying instead being oddly cute and endearing.
-   In **Bird**, Sveta is a sweet, likable, and — more importantly — **sane** young woman. She is also a mass of murderous tentacles she can only control some of the time. Alchemilla is full of people with problems they can't help, and many of them are insane, but Sveta might be the standout example due to her immense physical mutations. **Bird** as a whole runs on themes of inversion, and as such, people with horrible pasts and/or appearances are more likely to be nice and sweet.
-   The FUSB in **Brainbent** is an Ugly Cute plush abomination (it's **supposed** to resemble a bee - let's just say it doesn't) that may possess sinister powers.
-   In **Lost Tales of Fantasia**, Alice from **Alice in Wonderland** is just as little and sweet as she is in canon... except here, she's an extremely powerful devil from Wonderland, which is really Hell.
-   This drawing of Nahatomb from **Klonoa** was conceived specifically based on the concept of turning the one not-cute nightmare-inducing monster in the game into something small and huggable.
-   The **Discworld** tale "The Importance of Index Cards'' pits one determined Watchman against the ordeal of the encounter with Tshup Aklathep, Infernal Star Toad with A Million Young. Can A.E. Pessimal survive a trip to the Dungeon Dimensions with an unexploded head? He finesses the ordeal in a not-wholly-improbable way and comes back alive, discovering on the way that a dread chthonic entity might sometimes be a little misunderstood. Especially if she's a single parent...
-   The **My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic** fanbase have produced a few of these, such as Thingpone, which is **The Thing** as a pony and **friendly**), and Cuddlhu, which is a mass of tentacles (yes those ones) that have inhabited a pony costume in order to make friends. Satyrs, which are the hypothetical offspring of a human and a character from the show debatably count as well, though they tend to lean farther toward the adorable side of the scale.
    -   There's also a tendency to turn Pinkie Pie into this, as a way to explain her Wrong Context Magic. One particular fic has her coming out to her friends... as a shoggoth.
-   The **Pokémon** fanfic **Pickles and Depredation** has Joas the Espurr. He is already powerful and cute as an Espurr, but his ability to plunge his opponents into a nightmare realm of Cthulhu ripoffs puts him firmly within the "abomination" category.

Adorable Abomination Example in Films — Animation

-   Experiment 626, a.k.a. Stitch, from **Lilo & Stitch** was originally designed by Jumba Jookiba as a bulletproof, fireproof, indestructible, smarter-than-a-computer alien prototype, whose initial instinct is to destroy everything he touches. Everything changes when he disguises himself as a dog and Lilo adopts him and shows him how to utilize his abilities for better purposes. This trope also applies to his "cousins" in the franchise's sequel material.
-   Played with in **Monsters, Inc.**, in which the "abomination" actually is nothing more than an adorable little two-year-old girl, but the monster society is terrified of human children so they view her as an abomination **because** she's a little two-year-old girl.
    -   In the prequel **Monsters University**, it's shown that the reason Mike is unable to be a successful scarer is because children find him far too cute and goofy to be properly scary, a revelation that he takes incredibly hard. Of course, it also means that the transfer from screams to laughs as a power source by the end of Monsters Inc. is something that works out great for him.

Adorable Abomination Example in Films — Live-Action

-   **Captain Marvel**: Goose the Flerken. She appears to be an ordinary, affectionate cat, but when the people she likes are threatened, she can open up a mouth full of huge tentacles and eat a whole room full of bad guys whole. She also manages to swallow the Tesseract — **an Infinity Stone** — without any problems, besides coughing it up like a hairball later.
-   In **Ghostbusters**, Gozer the Gozerian takes whatever form those who are near the summoning imagine it as. In the movie, it takes the form of the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man, because Ray tried to think of the most harmless thing possible rather than nothing at all.
-   **The Suicide Squad**: Starro the Conqueror is an alien monster capable of psychically enslaving multitudes of people through Body Horror Puppeteer Parasites — when he doesn't just rip them in half with his tentacles. He's also a chubby pink-and-blue starfish who resembles a Kaiju-sized version of a children's bath toy.
-   The Surreal Horror classic **Eraserhead** features a grotesque mutant baby that some viewers find Ugly Cute.
-   **Who Framed Roger Rabbit** deconstructs the existence of Toons alongside humans into this, as they exhibit traits commonly associated with Eldritch Abominations. They look very out of place in the real world, yet the real world warps to accommodate them in the form of Toon Physics. They are immortal, ageless, and impossible to kill without The Dip. Any injury whether human or fellow Toon-inflicted at best results in Amusing Injuries. Most dangerous among all, although they take no lasting damage from humans or fellow Toons, they can do very real, permanent damage to humans and the real world itself. Fighting an evil Toon out for your blood is a Hopeless Boss Fight; you can knock them down, flatten them, or whatever, but these will at best slow them down while they are free to injure, maim and kill you.

Adorable Abomination Example in Literature

-   "Mr. Widemouth": The titular Mr. Widemouth himself. He's a cute but evil little Furby lookalike of unknown but almost certainly paranormal origin.
-   **Nyaruko: Crawling with Love!**: Nyarlathotep, The Crawling Chaos of Lovecraftian fame, is turned into a pretty girl with some inhuman quirks. Others from the mythos turn up and the whole thing is a sex farce with a few nods to its horror inspiration.
-   From the perspective of the television, Berry Bunny and the kids in the commercial from **Spider Bunny** look just like any cartoon from the era it came from. Should you wind up trapped in the pocket dimension it takes place, their unnatural proportions come across as gruesome and horrifying. The children do absolutely nothing but eat cereal at the table, acting out the commercial on repeat and ignoring anything outside of their scripted segments.

Adorable Abomination Example in Live-Action TV

-   Gachnar the Fear Demon from the **Buffy the Vampire Slayer** "Fear Itself" causes a frat house to become a nightmare-filled haunted house and scares the hell out of the Scooby Gang. When he finally emerges it turns out Gachnar is about three inches tall.
    
    **Giles:** **\[puts open tome on the table\]** I should have translated the text under his picture.  
    **Buffy:** What does it say?  
    **Giles:** "Actual size."
    
-   Adam Young in **Good Omens (2019)** looks like an adorable human newborn (which causes much Cuteness Proximity among the Satanist nuns carrying out the Switched at Birth plan), who matures into a cherubic-looking preteen Reality Warper.
-   Dustin's "pet" Dart in Season 2 of **Stranger Things** starts out as an Ugly Cute lizard-like thing. Then it breaks out of its tank, eats his cat, and grows into one of the Demodogs. It still remembers Dustin, though, and allows him and his friends to pass unharmed during the climax.

Adorable Abomination Example in Podcasts

-   **Welcome to Night Vale**:
    -   Khoshekh the "cat". At first glance, just the adorable half. But at one point, Cecil plays a recording of Khoshekh's meow, which is a terrible screech. Later, he reminds the people who adopted Khoshekh's offspring to look out for their pets' poisonous spine ridges and venomous fangs, and ends the segment by cooing, "Who’s my adorable little kitten with your adorable tendril hub? It’s you! It’s you!"
    -   A much more extreme example would be The Good Boy, the Big Bad of Season 4. Seemingly an ordinary beagle puppy, he is in reality probably the most dangerous entity in a world filled with Eldritch Abominations. His only desire is "nothing" — literally nothing. He refuses to let anything exist. There's never any reason for his actions, because reasons are things and must be destroyed. Those who enter his realm are transformed into "strangers", who live forever, but lose the ability to move, except to breathe. Even The Faceless Old Woman Who Lives In Your Home, an extremely dangerous and Lovecraftian being in her own right, is absolutely terrified of him. When he comes to Night Vale, the horoscopes for that week say nothing, either because the stars are protecting the populace from the knowledge of what comes next, or because he's so unpredictable that even the stars don't know what will happen. It's heavily implied that he is the Devil incarnate.

Adorable Abomination Example in Tabletop Games

-   **Munchkin Cthulhu** gives us Chibithulhu, which is Exactly What It Says on the Tin. Yes, plush versions exist.
-   **Pokéthulhu** displays a very different way to apply this to the Mons genre, with cute, adorable creatures that love to eat souls.

---
Adorable Abomination Example in Theatre

-   The Tickle-Me-Wiggly doll from **Black Friday** is built on this trope, with the cute, cuddly doll that everyone wants for Christmas actually being the earthly agent of an Eldritch Abomination that seeks to destroy the world. A couple Above the Influence characters note that with its sunken red eyes, tentacles, and cloying voice, the Wigglies are actually pretty ugly, if not downright unsettling, but many people (including the audience, to the extent that real Wiggly dolls sold like hotcakes on Starkid's website) find them to be Creepy Cute.

Adorable Abomination Example in Video Games

-   **Arknights**: Several of the Aegir - humans with aspects of sea creatures - are effectively these. Mizuki looks like a nice and friendly Aegir boy but he is a hybrid of human and Seaborn and is implied to occasionally **eat** your enemies. Skadi, as well as her Alternate Timeline version Skadi the Corrupting Heart, is an even more clear example of this, as she is housing a Seaborn goddess known as Isharmla who is capable of ending the world if Skadi ever lets her take control.
-   **Bloodborne**:
    -   Rom, the Vacuous Spider and Ebrietas, Daughter of the Cosmos are both Eldritch Abominations, and generally docile unless provoked.
    -   If Arianna survives until after the Blood Moon, she gives birth to one of these. It uses the model for the Celestial Child enemy, but it's completely docile. Killing it kills Arianna, but also gives you a One-Third Umbilical Cord.
-   **Bugsnax** has the titular critters. They enthrall the despairing and lost, beckoning them towards their own deaths, making them part of a sleeping mass of monsters... and they're all googly-eyed food-based animals that express themselves in Pokémon Speak.
-   **Crash Fever** has Azathoth, who has the mentality of a child and is quite adorable design-wise.
-   In the mobile Virtual Pet app, Cthulhu Virtual Pet, you take care of an adorable, baby version of the High Priest of the Great Old Ones.
-   **Cult of the Lamb**: The protagonist is an adorable sheep chosen by a dark god to lead a cult in said god's name, imbuing them with the dark god's power. While they normally looks like a regular sheep, when angry their eyes glow red, their teeth turn into fangs, and their horns become sharper.
-   **Deep Town: Mining Factory** has beings known as the Elders, who are Time Abyss eldritch horrors that ended humanity in the 23rd century. Most of them appear to be horrifying creatures, such as the tentacled monstrosities like the Coal Elder and Copper Elder. Then there's the Aluminium Elder<small>◊</small>, who resembles a small liquid metal blob with cute bulging "eyes" and big nose. Even your Mission Control finds it adorable.
-   Desco of **Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten**. A man-made Eldritch Abomination, she was created because her father is a Mad Scientist and her "older sister" had ambitions to take over the world at the age of **4**. Desco herself, besides wanting to make Big Sis' dream come true, has her own goal of becoming a Final Boss. Currently illustrating the trope page is Desco's sister of sorts, Des-X.
-   **Dragon Ball FighterZ**: Android 21 (specifically her good half) is very dorky and constantly struggles with her dark side.
-   **Fate/Grand Order**:
    -   The adorable fluffy squirrel-like creature Fou that accompanies Mash is **Primate Murder**, Rank 1 of the Twenty-Seven Dead Apostle Ancestors and Beast IV, a being tailor-made by the Earth to exterminate humanity. Along with ORT, it is the only being that rivals Angra Mainyu as the greatest human killing machine on the planet. Or, more specifically, Fou has the potential to become Primate Murder, but as of now is not Primate Murder. And given his relationship with humans in this timeline, he probably will never become Primate Murder.
    -   The Foreigner class is one reserved for beings "outside of the human mind". The first addition to this class is a little girl known as Abigail Williams of Salem, who in this continuity is the host to an outer being, can summon other Eldritch Abominations to her side with her keys to attack with Combat Tentacles, and by the time of her final transformation looks like a pale, white-haired witch with tentacles around her, purple-red eyes and a keyhole in her head that holds another eye. Despite this, she still looks and acts like a little girl and still has good intentions towards the protagonist.
    -   Lostbelt Britain, an alternate history where Faeries rule instead of humans, is menaced by Faerie versions of the Beasts of Calamity. One of these is an undead Celtic god Cernunnos, who is depicted as a rotund, fluffy, horned, vaguely Totoro\-looking creature the size of a landmass. This was notably intentional to convey that his abomination status is because of tragic circumstances and not innate to the god himself, who was a kind and gentle soul in life.
-   **Kamihime Project** has playable and personified Lovecraftian abominations in the form of adorable girls such as Dagon, Cthulhu, Hastur, etc.
-   Some species of Heartless, Unversed and Dream Eaters from **Kingdom Hearts** fall into this trope. All are Eldritch Abominations; some happen to be adorable.
-   Kirby, at least according to **Kirby: Right Back at Ya!**. Also, Gooey from the games, who is a piece of Dark Matter who broke off, turned good, and became Kirby's best friend.
    -   Void Termina from **Kirby Star Allies** briefly assumes this role when its core takes on the shape of Kirby's face. Everything else about it is as nightmarish as the entity itself is supposed to be, and the fact it cannot keep this face for long is meant to show just how **wrong** it is.
    -   In **Kirby and the Forgotten Land**, it's revealed that the adorable creature Elfilin is the good side of eldritch entity Fecto Elfilis that was split off from it, representing the part that is capable of compassion and love. The other part turned into the **very** evil Fecto Forgo.
-   **Machina of the Planet Tree -Unity Unions-**: Nova and its smaller clones look like chibi-proportioned demons with no faces or arms. The clones' only attack is a rather unthreatening-looking hop. Despite that, they are still negative ether lifeforms born from the hatred of King Megistos's victims.
-   **Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story** has Candy the Stuck-Out Ears Witch. She looks like a cute little pink rabbit... until you fight her, at which point she attacks you by doing this.
-   **Reverse: 1999** has Voyager, a sentient, intelligent nebula from a galaxy beyond the milky way. To other aliens, she is an absolutely **terrifying** existence, where her very **presence** has them abandoning that galaxy and leaving anyone unfortunate enough to be there at the time to their fates. To humans, however, she takes on the form of a "young girl" in a Soviet Russian school uniform who communicates largely through facial expressions, gestures, music through her violin, and a handful of words.
-   **Pokémon**:
    -   **Pokémon Sun and Moon**:
        -   At first glance Mimikyu seems to be an adorable Bedsheet Ghost that looks like a Pikachu... but then you read its PokéDex entries, which state that the mere **sight** of the creature under the costume has caused people to die from shock.
        -   Cosmog and Poipole. The former is hypothesized to be an Ultra Beast, and possesses the power to open Ultra Wormholes. It also evolves into the mascot legends of Sun and Moon. The latter **is** an Ultra Beast, and sprays poison while cackling maniacally. Both of them look adorable. Poipole is even popular enough in Ultra Space to be the non-battle equivalent of a **starter Pokémon**.
    -   **Pokémon Scarlet and Violet**: Terapagos is an incredibly powerful being made of pure Terastal energy, and the source of the Terastal phenomenon. It's also a cute little turtle.
-   **Shin Megami Tensei**'s Jack Frost is an adorable Snowlem with a cute jester cap, booties, Black Bead Eyes and a cheerful grin. He's also a winter spirit of ice and frost who's evolved into his current form to more easily freeze prey, and when leveled up, it morphs into its true form — **Wendigo**.
-   **Smite**: Scylla and Charybdis are both sea monsters who take the appearance of little girls with hidden monstrous limbs.
-   **Tales of Berseria** has therions; terrifying daemons that eat other daemons and are rightfully feared in regards to battle. The main character, Velvet, is one herself and gains the title Lord of Calamity for a reason. And then there is Kamoana; a therion yes, but she honestly looks pretty **cute** and is an ordinary sweet girl despite being a therion. It's Played for Drama too; her being an innocent girl causes the Heel–Face Turn of two characters and tends to bring out the best in others too. There are other therions too, and when not in full therion mode they can be cute; Velvet herself has her dorky sides. Justified too: the therions are either humans or animals that are receptive of Innominat's power and they don't drastically change through the transformation in who they are.
-   In the 2016 horror game **Tattletail**, the protagonist has to care for a creepy Faux Furby called a Tattletail. The same goes for the Tattletail's Mama, Mama Tattletail. However, unlike other horror games with an Antagonist Title, the Tattletail our protagonist has is genuinely well-intentioned. The only Tattletail with ill-intention here is Mama Tattletail, who tries to kill your protagonist various times throughout the game.

Adorable Abomination Example in Visual Novels

-   **Monster Prom**:
    -   Oz is a very eldritch figure, being the Anthropomorphic Personification of fear in the form of a Living Shadow boy. However, he is shy and dorky.
    -   Zoe/Z'gord is a world-ending Eldritch Abomination that acts like a school girl having a crush, including actually assuming the form of a Creepy Cute, Cute Monster Girl with tentacles for hair and purple skin.
-   The titular Saya from **Saya no Uta** is a subversion. She may appear to be a cute girl, but that's only from the protagonist Fuminori's perspective, due to his condition making him see most people and scenery as hideous lumps of flesh. She's really an alien whose true appearance is never fully revealed, but while Fuminori sees her as a normal human, her true form is implied to be so hideous that normal people will go insane just from looking at her. Later on, Saya's behavior also becomes more monstrous and alien as her character is further explored.

Adorable Abomination Example in Web Animation

-   The Adventures of Lil Cthulhu.
-   Charlie Morningstar of **Hazbin Hotel** is the daughter of Lucifer and Lilith, and is the princess of hell, and when she gets excited her eyes turn red and her teeth sharp (among other quite monstrous traits). However, she is the most pleasant and compassionate person in all hell.
-   Ninomae Ina'nis from **hololive** is the scariest-looking of the English-speaking roster, playing the character of the head priestess of the "Ancient Ones" and looking like them. She is also the calmest and most easy-going member of Hololive EN.
-   **Homestar Runner's** 2018 Halloween cartoon, "Mr. Poofers Must Die", gives us the titular Mr. Poofers, a character in Homestar's "ghost story". He's an adorable cloud-shaped dog who eats pinecones and says "miffa miffa meeka moo" instead of barking. The "abomination" part comes from the fact that, no matter how hard they try, **nobody** can tell a story that involves any harm coming to Mr. Poofers. Everyone who tries ends up telling a cutesy nonsensical story instead, and breaking into a cold sweat as soon as they finish. After even Strong Bad fails to kill Mr. Poofers, the characters all decide to just worship him as "our new dark overlord" instead. In an easter egg, Mr. Poofers is even referred to as a "beast of the apocalypse".
    -   As the mascot for Fluffy Puff Marshmallows, Marshie is **supposed** to be appealing, but comes off in-universe as creepy. He starts veering into abomination territory in an Easter egg in one Strong Bad Email, where he appears as a cloud of "marshmallow vapor" saying "You can't destroy me!" In a costume commentary video, he also reveals that the bite taken out of his head has weakened him, and were he ever able to "poomp \[it\] back", he'd be unstoppable. His alter-ego, Gel-Arshie, a red translucent version of Marshie with a floating brain visible within, refers to himself as an abomination... and he's comin' to **your** house after school!
-   **Puffin Forest**:
    -   The Terror of the Deep. Ben is running a game of **Tomb of Annihilation** when the players run into an aboleth who happens to be not what the players expected. The same adorable aboleth cameos in a few later episodes.
    -   The Shemhazian/Mutilation Demon from the Pathfinder TPK module. It is the Final Boss of a module that is designed to kill the players, but Ben draws it as a cute spider/bear thing and talks about it in a cutesy voice like it doesn't have a chance of winning because it is all by itself, but then he switches to a serious voice when he gets to the part about how it will petrify the players and eat their corpses.

Adorable Abomination Example in Webcomics

-   Bogleech's creations, especially **Awful Hospital**, are an antithesis to OMS's Theory of Eldritch Adaptation. There's a lot of alien stuff in here that is simultaneously ludicrously adorable and horrifyingly **disgusting**, including talking baby maggots, walking kidney stones and tumors, an RPG party of various sentient illnesses with skewed values and inhuman motivations (main character Fern herself describes them as **things** who know how to act as people), and sentient (/insane) psychic dolphins. What's more, it's heavily implied that most of what we see in the comic is a toned-down, cuteness-infused, humanity-saturated version of the true Eldritch horror of the setting — the full blast of cosmic horror would blow our minds to atoms. We can barely stomach the threat of **a funny-looking all-consuming wyrm that wants to consume everything in the multiverse so that all will become one in the vision of some rotted crumbs of Cake God whose ideal reality is himself as literally the only thing in all of multiversal existence**. It's both hilarious and induces real-life nightmares.
-   In **Cthulhu Slippers** Cthulhu himself is a happy, suspender wearing, friendly Eldritch Abomination. Meanwhile recalled Cthulhu Corp product 'My First Necronomicon' is a happy, bunny eared, pigtailed version of the Necronomicon. It ate all your chips.
-   **Digger** has another Shadowchild, a small Living Shadow that is, technically, a soul-eating demon. But it's so **cute**! It wants to be your friend!
-   The title character of **Erma** is a Stringy-Haired Ghost Girl with an assortment of macabre powers and Nightmare Fetishist tendencies, who is otherwise a good and sweet-natured little girl.
-   **Exterminatus Now**: Virus' pet Chao comes into contact with a powerful daemon , absorbing daemonic DNA and turning into a Chao-shaped clone of the daemon. Virus names it "Blasphemy"
-   Becquerel and GCAT from **Homestuck** are a Big Friendly Dog and a cute mischievous cat, respectively, and are also reality bending physical gods **with no eyes**.
    -   The Squiddles may also count as this in-universe, as they represent humanity's subconscious awareness of the horrorterrors, in the form of a disgustingly cute children's show.
-   **Foxes in Love**: This comic's last panel shows a pair of what the image description refers to as "creatures beyond our comprehension", who exist on another level of reality and are so huge that Green and Blue are smaller than an ant relative to them. Despite their size and otherworldliness, they look remarkably like our two cute vulpine protagonists, but differently-colored and with three eyes, and they have a similar interest in observing lesser beings going about their lives.
-   Cthulhu himself appears like this in **Mac Hall**, where he is both tiny and adorable, and at one point had a teddy bear.
-   In **The Order of the Stick**, Sunny is this. It helps that the comic's art style makes them look like a giant smiley face with an enormous doleful eye in addition to their friendly behaviour.
-   **Ow, my sanity** was created with the author's premise that this is the **natural** state of an Eldritch Abomination in the modern world, now that we've explored most of the formerly-remote regions of the world and science where Lovecraft believed madness lurks and our view of the cosmos has long since adapted to the findings. While they still have disturbing and unknowable aspects, they appear more anthropomorphic because we can better understand and relate to them than was the case in his day.
-   The quite affable Shadow Child from **Roommates** is an adorable, albeit a bit creepy, little boy, if you don't count his shadow tendrils defying the conventions of the medium and his Mind Rape powers... and the fact he is the Anthropomorphic Personification of a negative emotion.

Adorable Abomination Example in Web Original
