Abnormal Dental Growth: 
His name _is_ "Toothy" after all.

_You are looking out through a window at night. Candlelight near you allows you to see your reflection. You watch as your teeth begin to elongate: slowly, rather comfortably, like the growth of a tree-branch in spring._

—**"A dream about a window at night" storylet**, _Fallen London_

Teeth are an important part of the human (and animal) body. Their main function is to cut off chunks of food for easy consumption. Losing a tooth or two wouldn't be an issue, but losing most, if not all, teeth is a different story. If humans lose their teeth for various reasons, they will be fitted with dentures. Unless they have dentures or have the ability to swallow their food whole, if animals lose their teeth, they might as well wait for death to take them.

In fiction, when a character loses their teeth, they will regrow their teeth faster than realistically possible. Depending on the writer, teeth will either grow rapidly, or retract/detract their fangs, either in a day or in seconds. Not only that their tooth enamel might harden in seconds as well.

Sometimes, this trope is used for comedic effects in cartoons or for dramatic effects in comics and manga.

Compare hyperdontia, a condition that causes a person to have more teeth than normal. In Troperspeak, it's called More Teeth than the Osmond Family.
