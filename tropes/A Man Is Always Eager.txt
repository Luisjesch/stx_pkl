A Man Is Always Eager: 
_"Men always want sex. The single rule we have about sex is that we only have it with people we’re attracted to, and to be honest: that’s a loose guideline, at best... Let me assure you, if you’re a woman and you’re with a man, he’s waiting for you to say go. It doesn’t matter if he’s a handsome millionaire and you’re a mail-order bride with a hump."_

— **Seanbaby's Final Last Word**, _The Wave Magazine_

The idea that men are always hungry for sex and would never willingly turn it down for any reason. If a man has even the tiniest chance to get sex as a reward for performing some task, then it is _always_ Worth It, no matter how difficult or costly the task may be, nor how disastrous the consequences. It doesn't matter if he's a virgin or if he already has sex multiple times a day, he'd forever be kicking himself for passing up a chance to do it just one more time.

To take one common example in fiction, on the rare occasion that a man is a virgin, he will always want to initiate sexual activity with his significant other. He's never nervous or apprehensive about how the first time will go, just excited about the fact that he'll actually be having sex. And he'll never, _ever_, be as satisfied with the state of his (non-existent) sex life as his girlfriend is.

This is a form of Double Standard related to All Men Are Perverts and All Women Are Prudes. Being a bit nervous about the whole thing is perfectly normal, and fiction will show this with both male and female characters. Usually, however, a male character will almost always be worried about how long it'll last, rather than the act itself. The flip-side of this particular trope is that, since every man is hopelessly enslaved by his overpowering libido, every woman is utterly asexual. It is _outrageous_ for any woman to enjoy, or even _want_ sex. If a female character _does_ enjoy sex, she will inevitably be The Lad-ette, i.e. a woman with the personality of a man. Liking sex is just one of her "manly" traits.

There are certain situations in which this trope will always appear:

-   A Very Special Episode about a couple's first time. The dialogue between them will inevitably be some variation of the following, depicting the male as far more willing than the female:
    
    **Bob:** Are you sure about this...I mean, are you sure you're ready?  
    **Alice:** ...I'm sure...
    
-   An episode about how a girl's virginity is precious in some way, and she has every opportunity to turn down sex from her pushy boyfriend. Spoiler alert: the girl won't listen, and she'll either feel like a slut after sex, or she'll feel violated, and swear to her friends that she'll never have sex again. Hopefully someone talks her out of it.

Sometimes, in a show aimed at a younger audience, sex would be inappropriate and/or can't be shown. Kissing will be used instead.

If a male character is shown _not_ jumping at the chance to have sex with a woman, he will be either gay or Mistaken for Gay (the latter scenario can be Truth in Television). This is also common in Double Standard Rape: Female on Male; the idea that a man can't be raped by a woman because men are always willing to have sex, with any woman, at any time, for any reason. This is also one of the reasons for the stigma against Asexuality, especially in men; since all men supposedly enjoy sex, not being interested in it "clearly" means there's something wrong with them.

One of the unfortunate results of this trope is that many people believe it in real life. Obviously, this can cause problems, with the partner convinced they've been utterly rejected if the man isn't up for it right that second, and the man thinking there's something seriously wrong with him physically or psychologically. Taken to extremes, this can lead to men being on the receiving end of emotional or sexual abuse, or even rape.

In the rare cases where a man was sexually assaulted and immediately has sex or shows romantic interest in someone else afterwards, he probably Got Over Rape Instantly.

If an eager woman wants to have sex with an unwilling man (an inversion of this trope), it's All Women Are Lustful.

All Gays are Promiscuous is this trope taken to its logical conclusion once you remove women from the equation.

    Advertising 

-   A painkiller TV commercial ends with a man and a woman in bed preparing for sleep. The woman declares that her headache is gone and turns off the light. A second later, she turns it back on, and we see the guy moving in for some action, only for her to shut him down. This implies that the only thing keeping a guy from trying to get some is a woman's headache.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Gantz_, Kei Kurono starts out as a virgin who is all too eager to have sex with anything that moves. Kei Kishimoto moves in with him after their first mission "as his pet", because she has nowhere else to go. After continuously dropping hints and finally becoming explicit about his sexual desires:
    
    **Kishimoto:** You don't have sex with your pets, do you?  
    **Kurono:** Well, when I was a kid I had this dog I liked to give hugs and kisses to.
    
-   _Futari Ecchi_: Some of the women do want sex, but never to the extent of the men.
-   _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_: Panty has spontaneously offered sex to hundreds of men—including an entire football team at once. All of them take her up immediately, often in inconvenient locations, except her Hopeless Suitor Brief, who balks at the idea of going so fast. Even then, he's fine with having sex with Panty after one date.
-   Guts from _Berserk_ may not be a sexually-driven man, and he has had his share of sexually traumatizing experiences, but in no way was he **not** looking forward to having sex with Casca a _thousand more times_ after both of them lost their virginity to each other, though he expresses his desire as a sign of devotion rather than general horniness. Too bad that things just didn't turn out the way they should have in the end.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ plays around with the trope when it comes to the character of Kaji. While he is introduced as a flirtatious person and is frequently shown to hit on the women around him, later episodes see his Hidden Depths gradually emerge, during which it becomes clear that this behavior is at least partly an Obfuscating Stupidity act he employs as a part of his Double Agent work. Some of the glimpses into the sexual bits of his relationship with Misato even implies that his sex drive might actually be quite a bit lower than hers; notably, in a flashback to when the two of them spent a week in bed together during their college days, Kaji is shown to be apprehensive about the situation and he even suggests that maybe they should take a break and get back to studying, while Misato is the one who insists they should just continue having sex instead.
-   Subverted with Tsubasa in _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_. Most of the time it's Kashiwagi that makes advances on him and he's been apprehensive about being intimate in more public places like the school festival or a park. The times when he does try to forward their relationship has been mostly chaste like asking the student council why he made her mad or trying to hold her hand. Considering his family history, he might be consciously trying to defy this trope.
-   Subverted in _Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu_. When Tessa comes over to Jindai High as a Foreign Exchange Student and has to live under Sousuke's roof for two weeks, Mardukas immediately assumes Sousuke will try to bang her and thus gives him an elaborate description of how he will murder him should the boy try. This naturally terrifies Sousuke—not because he's even remotely tempted (Kalinin later points out the absurdity of thinking _Sousuke_ would try anything), but because he's been subject to enough unwanted sexual advances to seriously worry that she might not take no for an answer and knows Mardukas wouldn't believe him for a second.

    Comic Books 

-   Subverted in _Star Wars (Marvel 1977)_ and some other Star Wars Legends comics featuring a young Luke Skywalker. Luke is popular with women to the point of being a Chick Magnet, but never initiates a kiss and in fact seems shocked whenever one is forced on him. The first time he encounters several Zeltrons who all want to sleep with him he's highly dismayed and only wants to get away; later in the series he's more comfortable around them but deftly deflects all offers and prefers to be by himself. When a fellow Rebel that he's friends with propositions him for some casual sex, he turns her down despite being in a spat with Leia.
-   Subverted in _Robin_ and _Red Robin_ by Tim Drake. Despite having about five girlfriends over the course of the comics and being propositioned for sex thrice he always responds with Let's Wait Awhile being one of the very few Celibate Heros in the DCU.

    Fan Fiction 

-   In _Consequences of Manipulation_ Ginny complains because she can't talk Harry into doing what she wants.
    
    **Mrs. Weasley:** I need you to be honest with me Ginny. You are an adult now, are you and Harry having sex?  
    **Ginny:** Um, we have, a few times.  
    **Mrs. Weasley:** Then that is your answer and a very useful tool women have to use on men. It's well known that men cannot go without sex, not once they have it and especially not young men.
    
-   In _Faith_ Ron laughs when he hears about men who were raped by female Death Eaters because "if a guy reacts, he wants to have sex".
-   Played With in the _Glee_ fanfic _Hunting the Unicorn_. Blaine lost his virginity at sixteen, but being very trusting and implied to think Sex Equals Love, he ended up strung along by a guy who clearly didn't feel the same way. When it turns out that Blaine still had the guy's number _after they'd been broken up for WEEKS_, his big brother went insane and threatened to _burn the guy alive in his own house_. He's... not so eager anymore.
    -   Even worse—not only did he _think_ Sex Equals Love, he tried to _invoke_ it.
-   Crosses into a borderline Double Standard Rape: Female on Male in Cori Falls's "How James Got His Mojo Back". James makes a big deal of having Jessie's consent for lovemaking at all times, but the moment James changes his mind and doesn't feel like sex Jessie _and Meowth_ act like he's lost his mind.
-   In _Lions VS Snakes_ Ginny and Ron are adamant that forcing herself on Colin isn't rape.
    
    **Ginny:** You can't rape a guy. They all want it.
    
-   Zig-zagged in _The Night Unfurls_.
    -   This trope is the underlying assumption for supporting Vault's ambition of a Sex Empire. The "logic" is something like this: any man want sex, so any man would support a regime where all women being sex slaves by law, since they can have their crushes, obtain as many partners as possible, and fulfill their sexual desires. Amongst the Black Dogs, Shamuhaza seems to be the exception, as he is more interested in furthering his experiments and research than sex. More exceptions are shown in the remastered version, which introduces several Black Dog members who eventually defect after Vault's revelation to betray the Seven Shields.
    -   Otherwise, the narrative gives no indication as to whether the male characters, major or minor, are sexually driven. Tellingly, the males in the Eostian military, which has no gender restrictions, are not portrayed as eager to have sex with the females in a given chance. Furthermore, there is no indication whether the world of _The Night Unfurls_ places a high value on a woman's virginity either.
    -   Downplayed for Hugh. He shows more eagerness than Sanakan during their lovemaking in Chapter 18 of the original, but this is expressed as a sign of devotion, and he is far from a horny person.
    -   To cap it off, the very fact that Kyril Sutherland **exists** is a mockery of this trope. While he does see himself as a broken man, it's because he's a Shell-Shocked Veteran and a great one, _not_ because of his unwillingness to have sex. All in all, he is simply not into sex. Full stop.
-   _Us and Them_: After they get married, Sephiroth will look for just about any reason or excuse to make love to Aeris. Fortunately for him, she's _usually_ willing to reciprocate.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _American Pie_, all of the guys are like this. One of the relationships in particular has the classic elements of this trope; the guy very badly wants to have sex with his girlfriend, but she's not ready and wants it to be "special", though she's OK with other forms of sexual activity like oral sex.
    -   Ends up being Subverted in one of the four cases, as one of them ends up falling for his conquest and tells her he's willing to wait until she's ready. They end up doing it anyway.
-   Gets some play in _Animal House_ when Pinto's date passes out at a party when they're alone in a back room. The devil on his shoulder is egging him on and telling him "You know she wants it!" and when Pinto finally decides to heed the admonitions of the angel on his other shoulder to keep his hands to himself, yells "You homo!" at him before vanishing.
-   In the Lifetime Movie of the Week _Cyber Seduction: His Secret Life_, the male lead is always pressuring his girlfriend to have sex with him because he thinks he is ready.
-   One of the skits in _Extreme Movie_ revolves around this.
-   In _Joker (2019)_, a performer at the stand-up comedy club has this routine:
    
    I think most women look at sex like buying a car. You know, like, "Can I see myself in this long term?" "Is it safe?" "Is it reliable?" "Could it kill me?" Most guys look at sex like parking a car. We're like, "There's a spot." "There is another spot, that would work." "Oh, I have to pay? Never mind." "Handicapped? Hope no one sees us."
    
-   Inverted in _Miss March_. The main character, Eugene, wants to wait to have sex. His girlfriend, on the other hand, isn't so sure about waiting.
-   Subverted in _Pretty in Pink_, when Andie accuses Blane of this trope, he points out that he hasn't even tried to kiss her yet.
-   At least one of the main boys in _Weird Science_ is like this.
-   The boyfriend who also happens to be the killer in _Scream (1996)_ is like this.
-   This trope is mercilessly parodied in _Student Bodies_:
    
    **Girl:** Come on, we're at a funeral!  
    **Boy:** Funerals get me hot!
    
-   The main character in _Sex Drive_ is like this, to the point that when he finally loses his virginity to his best friend/girlfriend he asks the aforementioned question the second time he has sex with her.
-   The movie _Fright Night (1985)_ actually opens with a scene like this.
-   Parodied, Subverted _and_ Inverted in _Another Gay Movie_, the guys are gay, but they're all eager to have sex, while still being nervous about it. Plus, they all proclaim themselves to be the dominant "tops" of their relationship, including the submissive "bottom". The one who is most eager about having sex is actually a lesbian who "converts" several of her straight female classmates.
-   Inverted in _The 40-Year-Old Virgin_. Nearly all of the potential sexual partners Andy passes up (including his girlfriend) are more eager than he is.
-   Averted in _The Graduate_. Ben is quite shy and scandalized by the idea, and has to be talked into it. The woman in question was the wife of his father's business partner...
-   Lampshaded in the 1987 _Dragnet_ movie. The incredibly straight-laced Friday turns down a pretty woman, leading to this exchange.
    
    **Pep Streebeck:** Are you crazy? Silvia Wiss wanted you!  
    **Friday:** Now let me tell you something, Streebeck. There are two things that clearly differentiate the human species from animals. One, we use cutlery. Two, we're capable of controlling our sexual urges. Now, you might be an exception, but don't drag me down into your private Hell.
    
    **Pep Streebeck**: You've got a lot of repressed feelings, don't you, Friday? Must be what keeps your hair up.
    
-   Max in _Hocus Pocus_ is like this, though it is a less explicit example. His little sister catches him feeling up his _pillow_ at one point. He also hates it when people mention that a virgin had to light the black flame candle:
    
    **Max**: I'll get it tattooed on my forehead, ok?!
    
-   The brother in the 80's film _Just One of the Guys_ is like this:
    
    **Buddy**: Don't get me wrong. It's not like I've never had sex before; I've had lots of sex. It's just that now I'd like to try it with a partner.
    
-   _City Slickers_: "Women need a _reason_ to have sex; men just need a _place_."
-   Defied hilariously in _Interstate 60_, Neal and O. W. Grant meet a woman who is looking for perfect sex. She offers herself to Neal but he refuses her. When she claims that men "always say yes" Neal messes with her head by claiming that the perfect sex she is looking for will be what she didn't get from him.
-   Inverted in _The Wedding Singer_. After their date, Holly flat-out tells Robbie that she's willing and eager to have sex with him. He turns her down because he's in love with Julia.

    Jokes 

-   A man goes to the doctor:
    
    **Patient:** Well doc, almost as long as I can remember now I've been feeling tired every day, and my dick hurts something fierce.  
    **Doctor:** Really. Describe your average day.  
    **Patient:** Well, in the morning I wake up, wake up my wife, and we have sex. Then while she's in the shower, I have sex with the cleaning lady. Then I go to work and have sex with my secretary, at ten I have sex with Julie from accounting, after lunch I have sex with the cafeteria lady, around three I have sex with Natalie from Sales, at five with Helen and Veronica from Marketing. Then I leave, have sex with the parking lady, go home, have sex with the babysitter, and when my wife comes home we have dinner and I have sex with her.  
    **Doctor:** Ooooookay. I'm going to hazard a guess here, and say your condition probably comes from having too much sex.  
    **Patient:** Really? Oh man, that's a relief.  
    **Doctor:** Why?  
    **Patient:** I was afraid it was from all the masturbation!
    

    Literature 

-   Played with in _A Brother's Price_: Jerin does have a healthy libido and his body _is_ very ready to have sex whenever an attractive woman tries to seduce him, but he values his chastity, as he wants to marry well. He is a bit ashamed that he lacks the self-control to fight back when random women kiss him. He mentions that he would not be so eager with women he doesn't consider attractive, though.
-   Subverted by Firo Prochainezzo of _Baccano!!_. Is he solidly, passionately in love with a woman? Yep. Is he ecstatic when, after fifty years, he can finally tie the knot with her? Yep! Is he eager to jump in bed with her the first chance he gets? Uh... can they just hold hands instead?
-   In _The Alice Network_, Charlie's experience with boys is that they'll go as far as she'll let them go; it's up to her to stop them. After her brother dies, she stops caring about stopping them, and ends up pregnant and unsure of who the father is.
-   In _Dragon Bones_, some men are this trope (Beckram, according to his brother Erdrick, has sex with everything that moves, which is a bit exaggerated, but not much), while some are not. When the protagonists travel with an attractive, but somewhat older woman (in her thirties, Ward, the oldest brother, is nineteen), she effortlessly seduces the two middle-aged men in the group, wins the affections of Ward's younger brother Tosten, and tries to seduce Ward. He's the only one who rejects her, and he's only able to do so because it wouldn't be wise to have sex while on guard duty at night. He later tells her that if not for the guard duty, he might have slept with her, but that it would have been wrong, as he doesn't really like casual sex. (There is also Oreg, who is also not so eager, but he's a bit of an exception, as he's Really 700 Years Old, immortal, a magically bound slave, and suffers from PTSD. It's implied that he was sexually abused in the past. It would stretch suspense of disbelief if _he_ was eager to have casual sex.) Subverted in that it is later revealed that the seductress uses her magical powers to make men want sex with her — she suspects that Ward is too stubborn, so it doesn't work on him. It probably doesn't work on Oreg because he's a powerful mage and not quite human. Of course the two other men perhaps wouldn't have turned her down without magic, either, but it's never really explained.
-   In her non-fiction book _The State of Affairs_, couple's therapist Esther Perel casts doubt on this trope.
    
    _A guy like Scott has grown up in a macho culture, where all he heard from his frat brothers was that dudes always want sex. He’s also read a bunch of articles that make the same case. I inform him that most of these studies are done on young college students; hence we actually know very little about the sexuality of mature men._
    
-   _The Twilight Saga_ inverts this—Edward has myriad reasons why he doesn't want to sleep with Bella, and Bella is not about to listen.
-   In the Focus On The Family teen novel "Just Like Ice Cream," the protagonist is convinced to have sex with her far more experienced summer love when he tells her sex is good... just like ice cream.
-   Discussed and Averted in _The Dresden Files_ book _Proven Guilty_; Harry and Murph have one of several conversations about why they've never gotten together, and while Murph offers a Friends with Benefits situation, she's unwilling to commit to anything more serious. Harry, despite stating that he's pretty sure it's a legal requirement for a man to say yes to sex whenever it's on offer, acknowledges that he couldn't keep the deeper and more serious emotions out of it, so they reluctantly decide that they should stay Just Friends.
-   Blake Thorburn, the protagonist of _Pact_, is an aversion of this trope. As a single twenty-year-old man with several gay and bisexual friends, his sexuality is called into question, and he admits that though he is straight he isn't "_practicing_ straight" and doesn't consider his sexuality to be an important part of his identity. He also turns down an offer from his best friend to be Friends with Benefits with another girl, referencing his hangups regarding physical intimacy.
-   _Aubrey-Maturin_: A lot of the sailors, Napoleonic-era sea travel being what it is. Maturin often comments that Jack is "pierced by his own sword" and simply has no idea how to turn down sex. Then there's Babbington, who has a portion of his pay confiscated by Jack whenever they reach port so he can be convinced to spend it on anything other than whores, and has had so many venereal diseases it has stunted his growth.
-   Issei from _High School D×D_: on the one hand, he constantly and loudly proclaims his eagerness to make out with any beautiful woman and has a well-deserved reputation as a pervert and The Peeping Tom. On the other hand, any time things actually look like they might go somewhere he either fails to notice girl tries to seduce him, or someone interrupts them. Revealed to be a deconstruction, since being murdered by his girlfriend on their first date made him afraid of getting too intimate with girls.
-   _So, I Can't Play H!_: For Ryosuke, it depends on the scene and _the girl_.
    -   At one point, two of Lisara's maids start to have sex with him to heal his wounds. But he's unresponsive, due to extreme emotional trauma from nearly being killed. They persist until he finally forces the maids off of him.
    -   If the girl is Lisara, that changes everything. From the moment he hooks up with her, he tries in earnest to get her in bed. Except she's a.) tsundere and b.) still a virgin. And she has no intentions of changing either one anytime soon.
-   Subverted in _Homecoming_. The defining test of manhood (at least in the culture to which the protagonists belong) is for a boy to spend the night alone with the girl he loves and _not_ have sex with her, thus proving that he possesses the self-control to be considered a man.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Alex Rider_: Subverted when one of the pupils at Point Blanc makes a very possessive move on Alex, who finds her creepy and makes it clear he's not interested. When she tries to taunt him with this trope, he shuts her down HARD, resulting in her getting angry and telling him he "should have enjoyed it while you had the chance" before storming off. Also Averted by James, with whom Alex shares a "What a crazy bitch!" look.
    
    **Sasha:** What's the matter? Don't you like kissing?  
    **Alex:** I do, I just don't like kissing YOU!
    
-   In one episode of _The Big Bang Theory_ Leonard feels the sting of this particular double standard when Penny demands sex off him after he ruins her ability to date morons (and Leonard gladly obliges), when he attempts to do the same to both Penny and ex-partner Leslie both reject him out of hand.
-   In _Boy Meets World_, Cory feels ready to have sex and is frustrated when Topanga decides to wait until marriage.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    
    -   That Oz doesn't want to engage is a very, very bad sign of potential infidelity. Xander more or less lampshades this trope by saying Willow might have encountered Oz in one of the "seven annual minutes he's legitimately too preoccupied". On the other hand, when Willow first started propositioning him, Oz was the one who turned her down, saying he wasn't sure they were ready yet. In the above instance, Willow's worry wasn't just the lack of interest in her but the obvious interest he had in another girl.
    -   Oz is usually the one putting the brakes on things. This fact seems to stem mostly from the way that he's very conscious of a. the fact that he's older and more experienced than Willow and b. that Willow's motives in situations like this aren't always terribly healthy ones. His reaction to Willow's proposed makeouts in "Innocence" is just gorgeous:
    
    "Sometimes when I'm sitting in class... You know, I'm not thinking about class, 'cause that would never happen. I think about kissing you. And it's like everything stops. It's like, it's like freeze frame. Willow kissage. Oh, I'm not gonna kiss you." (...) "Well, to the casual observer, it would appear that you're trying to make your friend Xander jealous or even the score or something. And that's on the empty side. See, in my fantasy when I'm kissing you, you're kissing me. It's okay. I can wait."
    
    -   One could argue that this trope is not so much Subverted as Played With—Willow comes onto him first about their first kiss and sex, but each time she seems to be doing it less because she really wants to and more because of another issue (first to make Xander jealous, later to "apologize" to Oz for cheating on him). While Oz turns her down both times, when they _actually_ have sex, he initiates it.
-   _Castle_ loves playing with this trope. In one episode the guest star honestly questions whether Castle is gay or in a secret relationship because when she propositioned him he refused (which she said she had never heard a guy say in that context), in another one Esposito and Ryan quip that Castle wouldn't be able to resist a girl's advances on the grounds that "he's a man and he has a pulse", and another episode had most of the male cast absolutely dumbfounded that a woman apparently slipped a man a date-rape drug, with the men quipping "Who roofies a guy? All a girl has to do is ask" multiple times. Later revealed that the murderer attempted to invoke this trope, but the man in question subverts it by refusing to cheat on his fiancé with his ex.
-   Inverted in _Chef! (1993)_. It's usually Janice who wants sex, but Gareth will be too tired from cooking all day.
-   In an episode of _Curb Your Enthusiasm_, Larry responds to his wife's concern that he never initiates sex by pointing out that he's always ready, and instructs her to tap him on the shoulder when she's ready. This backfires when she gives him the tap just after he's finished masturbating ("tapped out").
-   Subverted on _Dance Academy_, when Sammy and Abigail are planning Their First Time. Abigail initially doesn't believe they're ready, but then changes her mind, whereas Sammy claims he's "genetically coded to think I'm ready." However once they make it to the bedroom, Sammy decides not to go through with it because it "doesn't feel right", and Abigail appears upset. Arguably it becomes less of a subversion later on as it turns out to be foreshadowing for Sammy's Coming-Out Story, but given Sammy is seemingly bi, not gay, it still probably counts.
-   _Degrassi: The Next Generation_:
    -   Peter doesn't pressure Darcy into having sex, but he clearly thinks he is ready and is very eager to have sex with her.

-   Subverted in Season 1, when Jimmy is just as nervous about having sex with Ashley as she is. He just is better at hiding it.
-   Subverted again with Post-Friendship Club Spinner, who pushes Darcy away when she reluctantly wants sex with him, knowing that it was wrong. He manages to stay true to the Christian thing until he stops dating Darcy in Season 6.
-   The first time Holly J attempted to have sex, Blue outright said "I won't have sex with you," but they did hardly know each other at the time. Blue was eager but has a shred of moral fiber to him.

-   Inverted with painful hilarity in _Flight of the Conchords_. Bret meets a pretty girl, who pressures and bullies him into having sex before he's ready, lies about shipping out to Afghanistan the next day, avoids and ignores him afterwards, brags about him to her friends, and leaves him with a reputation as a man-ho. On the other hand, played straight in the fact that Jermaine thinks that this is a wonderful setup and can't understand why Bret is so upset about it.
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Averted when Jon tells Sam of how he couldn't go through with losing his virginity because of anxiety about fathering another bastard like himself, though it's somewhat zigzagged when Sam immediately turns this into a jab at Jon's intelligence.
    -   Played Straight in season 5 when Tommen can't get enough on his wedding night, to the amusement of Margaery and her handmaids, and to his mother's distress. It's highly implied it's mostly also due to Margaery's skills in the bedroom, and she promtly uses this to manipulate Tommen.
-   _Glee_
    -   Finn, from is like this, but he's tame compared to Puck, who wears this trope like a badge of honor. Probably some form of subversion/inversion, as after the sex he is ashamed and regretful as "it didn't mean anything". He reacts like the girl in the second example of "where you will see this" in the trope description.
    -   Inverted with Kurt, who explicitly defines himself as a romantic who is uncomfortable with both the physical act and the emotional implications of sex and who knew that he _really_ wasn't ready to have sex. He put his fingers in his ears and started singing when his Dad sat down to have The Talk with him.
-   The kissing variant is also used in _iCarly_ between Sam and Freddie. This is also somewhat of an inversion:
    
    **Carly:** You've really never kissed anyone?  
    **Sam:**...Yeah.  
    **Carly:** But you seem so...willing.
    
-   _It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia_: In "The Gang Group Dates", Dee and Dennis become obsessed with a dating website that allows users to give their dates "star ratings". Dee (who's in a man-hating mood), decides to use the website to find and sleep with several men and gives them all a rating of "1", but this ends up backfiring since she discovers most men couldn't care less since they're just happy for the sex and come back for more despite Dee's poor ratings.
-   All of the guys in the short-lived show _Life as We Know It_ are like this, but especially the main character. In one of the episodes, he manipulates his girlfriend into agreeing to have sex with him.

-   Implied by Halbrand from _The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power_. When three Numenorian men accuse him of wanting to steal their lands and trades, Halbrand adds that he wants to steal their women too just to piss them off.
-   The _Mystery Science Theater 3000_ episode _The Leech Woman_ had Crow turn the male protagonist of the film's second half into this, especially funny when the titular Leech Woman (as her young hot self) says his name and Crow replies "YES! I LOVE YOU! WHIPPED CREAM!"
-   Inverted with _Married... with Children_, where Peg Bundy always wants sex and Al Bundy is absolutely sickened by the very thought (though he's only sickened by the thought of sex with Peg, not sex in general).
-   _Orange Is the New Black_ does this in the episode "40 Oz. of Furlough", when Piper briefly gets to leave Litchfield Penitentiary to attend her grandmother's funeral. Having just spent the last several months separated from her fiancé Larry, of course the first item on her to-do list is a night of passionate sex with him. She goes about it by coercing him into an empty bathroom in her house and violently making out with him, bluntly ordering him to "Shut up" when he starts to protest that he doesn't want to. Subverted, in that she _does_ ultimately back off when she realizes that they've grown too far apart to jump right back into sex, but it would still probably raise some eyebrows if the genders were reversed.
-   _Pretty Little Liars_
    
    -   This exchange occurs between Hanna and Caleb:
    
    **Caleb:** Are you sure?  
    **Hanna:** I'm sure.
    
    -   Funnily enough, in the introduction of a guy she is a Love Interest for, it's a celibacy club meeting. Gender Flip though, because it's Hanna's boyfriend at the time who is the one who actually wants to be celibate, and Hanna spends quite a while trying to get him to have sex with her.
-   Subverted in _Riget_, the young medical student Mogge frequently lusts after the more mature nurse Camillia, despite her initial rejects of him for being too young for her taste. When he eventually manages to impress her and the two of them get into a intimate relationship, however, Mogge soon starts to loudly complain to his friend, Christian, that all Camillia ever seems to want from him is sex, something which he finds quite exhausting.
-   _Seinfeld_
    
    -   In "The Movie", Elaine says "Men can sit through the most pointless boring movie if there's even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off."
    -   Another episode had George become extremely intelligent after going without sex for a while due to his current girlfriend's illness. Jerry explains that this is because roughly 99% of his brain is normally obsessed with sex, and now that getting sex is not a possibility for George, it is free to function properly for the first time ever. Elaine then tries this with her current boyfriend, who is struggling to pass his licensing exam to become a doctor. It works, but it also has the side effect of making Elaine extremely stupid. Jerry explains that this is because men are always eager to have sex, therefore women can get sex so easily that they take it for granted.
    
    **Jerry:** To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head! The sidewalk is blocked! Nothing's getting through! ...You're stupid!
    
-   Subverted in an episode of the American version of _Skins_. One night, Tina, the high school teacher who's been secretly dating one of her underage students, goes on an impromptu date with a neighbor who lives in the same apartment complex as her. They go to a local burger joint and as they talk and make a connection, Tina aggressively starts kissing him. He gently pushes her off and asks what she's doing and she opens her glove compartment to shows him boxes of condoms, to demonstrate that she's ready to have sex right there and there. When he asks if she's being serious, she responds by asking if he's gay because he doesn't want to have sex with her, and he replies that he's not gay, he just doesn't want to have sex in an empty parking lot at night after one conversation. The neighbor exits her car and goes home, leaving Tina alone to question the decisions she's made up to this moment in her life.
-   _That '70s Show_
    -   In The episode "The Pill":
        
        **Donna:** All I'm saying is we have to wait for the right time.  
        **Eric:** Okay. How about now?  
        **Donna:** Um, no.  
        **Eric:** Okay. How about now?  
        **Donna:** No.  
        **Eric:** Okay. Now?  
        **Donna:** Yes.  
        **Eric:** Really?  
        **Donna:** No.  
        **Eric:** Okay. Now, right?  
        _(Donna leaves)_  
        **Eric:** I'll be waiting.  
        **Donna:** Shut up.  
        **Eric:** I've got a birthday coming up, so...
        
    -   Inverted later in "Mother's Little Helper", where Kitty leaves _The Joy Of Sex_ for Red to find in order to encourage him to have sex with her.
        
        **Red**: Kitty, I want us to grow old and withdraw into ourselves.
        
-   In an episode of _The Wire_, when Dukie comes home and sees/overhears Michael with a girl, the snippet of dialogue we hear is Michael asking the girl who's with him, "Are you sure you want to do this? I don't want to hurt you." This bit of dialog is fairly justified in Michael's case since his only experience with sex at the time was being the victim of childhood molestation.
-   _Wizards of Waverly Place_ completely averts this the first time, then played on its ear the second time (kissing variant):
    -   In Season one Alex has no problem kissing a random guy just to stop her brother from mocking her over never being kissed, and she shows no problems with kissing a random stranger.
    -   However, when it's a guy she actually likes, she's worried about him 'really getting around', and doesn't want to be just another girl to him. Turns out he's just as worried she'll be 'just another girl' and run off to brag to her friends after kissing him.
-   Averted with most of the non-villainous male characters in _Wynonna Earp_, probably due partly to the show's explicit non-straw feminism and also for reasons of Female Gaze. In contrast, the female characters (especially the titular heroine) are almost always happy and eager to have sex with their lovers, and very quick to proceed to kissing with people they barely know, so long as the guy (or gal) is attractive and not a douchebag.
    -   Jeremy is generally awkward and geeky, and clearly (and even somewhat fearfully) rejects Rosita when she's rather forcefully coming on to him. Though this probably was meant as a sign that he's gay since he also frequently makes comments about Doc and Dolls that imply he has a crush on them.
    -   Dolls is generally straight-laced and has no mentioned love-life for the first season (except one kiss with Wynonna at the end when she was dressed up to all nines at a party). In season 2, when a rule against co-worker dating becomes a non-issue, he starts pursuing a relationship with Wynonna, but the first time they end up in bed, they're just cuddling / sleeping in underwear and he seems perfectly happy with that.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   Even Doc, who is a self-admitted womanizer (though decidedly of the Chivalrous Pervert variety, at least in the present) and who happily has casual, no-strings-attached sex with several women (including Wynonna) at the drop of a hat, is still perfectly capable of rejecting an eager Wynonna once he falls in love with her, sees her kissing Dolls, and his feelings make things complicated. (Also, it's heavily implied that the reason Wynonna's baby's father is in question is that Doc wasn't going to have sex with her that particular night when she was willing, emotionally in dire need of being touched, but also recently traumatized and much more drunk than usual - he just spent the evening threatening guys with a knife the moment she stopped being happy with their attentions and then wanted to drive her home safely. So she ditched him, went on to another bar, and had sex with a random stranger instead.)
        
        **Wynonna:** I would never have kissed him if I didn't think that you were dead.  
        **Doc:** Come now, Wynonna, we never lied to each other. You are free to kiss whoever you like.  
        **Wynonna:** _\[moves in for a kiss\]_  
        **Doc:** _\[pulls away\]_ As long as they want you to.
        

    Music 

-   Subtly implied in the Souljahz song "True Love Waits". There are two verses, in which a female and a male protagonist, respectively, face attempts at seduction from their partners. In the female singer's verse, her would-be seducer uses far more lines than that of the male protagonist. This could imply two things. First, it takes a lot more for a man to talk a woman into bed than vice versa. Second, since both the male and female protagonists ultimately say no, the male protagonist's female seducer gives up more easily and willingly than the female protagonist's male seducer.

-   Played for Laughs in "I Just Had Sex" by The Lonely Island. The singers are very enthusiastic about any sexual encounter regardless of how uncomfortable and demeaning the circumstances are:
    
    She kept looking at her watch (Doesn't matter, had sex!)  
    But I cried the whole time (Doesn't matter, had sex!)  
    I think she might've been a racist (Doesn't matter, had sex!)  
    She put a bag on my head (Still counts!)
    
-   The narrator of "Self Esteem" by The Offspring admits that he should turn away his abusive girlfriend when she comes to him for sex, but "it's kinda hard when she's ready to go."
-   Pervert by Descendants has a singer proudly singing about his desire for sexual intercourse and even referring to himself as a pervert hence the song name (read the song's lyrics for yourself). This punk rock song is also featured in the fictional radio station "Channel X" from the Video Game _Grand Theft Auto V_.
-   Played with in Jermaine Stewart's "We Don't Have To Take Our Clothes Off": when a woman comes on him too strong with this assumption in mind, Stewart takes offense and chides her for such crass approach.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    
    Not a word from your lips
    
    You just took for granted that I want to skinny dip
    
    A quick hit, that's your game
    
    But I'm not a piece of meat, stimulate my brain
    

    Professional Wrestling 

-   The Sex for Services "Unlucky Services Trader" plotline that Bad News Brown accused WWF President Jack Tunney and Miss Elizabeth of, when he wasn't getting any shots at the WWF World Heavyweight Championship held by Randy Savage. (He claimed that Elizabeth was "doing favors" for Tunney to protect Savage from sure defeat.) Brown would go on to regret his words ... although in true Brown fashion, he never apologized, even after a bloody defeat.

    Stand-Up Comedy 

-   Bill Engvall remarks that he realized he was getting old when, during breakfast one morning, his wife suggested they "go upstairs and make love".
    
    **Bill:** And I thought about it. Twenty years ago, my paper'd still be hanging in the air and there'd be a trail of _fire_ going up them steps.
    
-   Billy Crystal definitely believes this: "Women need a reason to have sex. Men just need a place."

    Theatre 

-   In _Jasper in Deadland_, the fact that Jasper _isn't_ eager to have sex with Agnes is meant to prove how certain he is that they are Better as Friends.

    Video Games 

-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   A notable Subverted in _Dragon Age: Origins_ with Alistair. Despite appearing to be a seductive, charming gentleman and snarky ladies' man, when your character manages to make him fall for you, unlike other members of your group, he will not "put out" on the drop of a hat because he doesn't feel ready to lose his virginity yet and needs you to respect that he needs time. Further subverted in that when he eventually is ready and decides to go for it, he is noticeably nervous.
        
        **The Warden:** Are you sweating?  
        **Alistair:** No! I-I mean, yes! I mean... I'm a little nervous, sure. Not that this is anything bad or frightening or... well... YES.
        
    -   Subverted in _Dragon Age II_ by Fenris and straight up Averted by Sebastian. Fenris Hates Being Touched due to the lyrium tattoos all over his body and his experiences as a former slave, so it takes a lot before he'll open up enough to become willing for intimacy with Hawke. Sebastian's religious devotion means that he's taken a vow of chastity and encourages a romanced Hawke to do the same.
-   Shinjiro Aragaki of _Persona 3_ is an aversion. He knows damn good and well that he's going to die soon, so he's understandably very reluctant to give in, as much as he might want to. Once he _does_ agree, though, he says he's not holding back.

    Web Original 

-   The Nostalgia Critic takes great pleasure in trashing this one. While he's a dirty-minded perv and loves sex, we mostly just see or hear about the times he was forced into sex.
-   Subverted in _Chrono Hustle_ when Jack refuses to have sex with Aphrodite.

    Webcomics 

-   _Eerie Cuties_: Kade is the PG-13 version of this, as he's perfectly willing to make-out with any girl that shows him affection, or happens to catch his eye. As you'd expect, that also means he's willing to cheat.
-   Subverted and defied in _Flipside_ by Chaste Hero Crest, who begins the comic inelegantly trying to score with his crush, but ends up turning down every woman who propositions him, including said crush.
    
    **Moby:** You're a guy... you won't say no!  
    **Crest:** _NO!_ No no no no no _NO!_
    
-   Inverted in _Girls with Slingshots_ where Hazel is the one who is really, really horny and she has to put up with her boyfriend gradually becoming more and more comfortable with the idea of having sex with her.
-   Both sexes tend to be reliably eager in _Ménage à 3_; it's that sort of Sex Comedy. But it's notable that Gary's response to discovering that he's been tricked into giving Amber oral sex is "I AM TOTALLY OKAY WITH THIS SITUATION!!!" (Strip #495, September 3, 2011, NSFW. Well, she was his favorite porn star...)
-   Dimitri of _Space Trawler_ is extremely eager even when his partner is a barely-humanoid alien, provided that there is some kind of minimal compatibility (as measured by the weirdly precise scanning devices he acquires) — except perhaps when he’s being a Manipulative Bastard for the side of good. Though sometimes he manages to combine the two. The Interspecies Romance angle is the norm with him, anyway.
-   _Sticky Dilly Buns_ is a spin-off of _Ménage à 3_, as discussed above, so the men are, again, mostly reliably eager.
    -   This means that Andy’s aversion of the trope makes him look downright freakish; his girlfriend Ruby, who starts out cynically assuming the worst of men but works round to the idea that she’d quite like to try sex, finds him confusing and frustrating. It turns out that he’s borderline asexual, making him exaggerate his natural obliviousness, but fortunately they’re able to talk things through to a satisfactory conclusion.
    -   Jim, meanwhile, is perfectly willing to give oral sex to women but refuses to be on the receiving end, because he sees it as degrading towards them.
-   _Vampire Cheerleaders_: It initially seemed that Leonard would be a heroic antagonist to the cheerleaders, but all it took to make him change his mind about exposing them, was a little "BC". And, despite all the crap he took from them later, he admitted that he didn't mind as long as it meant he could get some.
-   _Under the Oak Tree_: Maximillian's loving husband Riftan is almost constantly horny for her. He tries to hold himself back when he thinks she's not up for it but doesn't realize that her childhood abuse has given her severe issues speaking up for herself. She can't bring herself to voice her desires when she is in the mood, so they occasionally suffer needless mutual frustration.

    Western Animation 

-   In the _Futurama_ episode "Amazon Women In The Mood", Fry, Kif, and Zapp are to be executed. The method: "Death... by ''snu-snu''! The reactions include "I never thought I would die like this...but I always really hoped!" and "The spirit is willing but the flesh is spongy and bruised." Kif, the long-suffering Only Sane Man, is the only one to react with undiluted horror, which gets him called gay - by Zapp.
-   _Thunder Cats 2011_: In _Legacy_, Lion-O's got **absolutely** _no problem_ using his ancestor Leo's relationship with fellow rebellion leader, Panthera, to score a makeout session right before Mumm-Ra's ship crashes into their current home planet in his vision of the past.
    -   Subverted later with Pumyra, when she starts flirting with him he just looks confused and vaguely disturbed, probably because he's been burned in the past and because she tried _killing him_ just a few hours earlier.
    -   Then played straight at his attempts with courting Pumyra, although initially they prove to be...rather awkward.
-   In _The Simpsons_ episode "The Computer Wore Menace Shoes", when Principal Skinner is surfing the web.
    
    **Seymour Skinner:** (_chuckling_) No, mother.
    
    **Agnes:** You sissy!
