Couldn't Find a Lighter Example in Real Life

-   It is perfectly possible and practical to light a cigarette using a candle instead of matches or a lighter. It is, however, considered rude and unlucky in many parts of the world. In Germany, for instance, it is said to cause the death of a sailor (as, back in the olden days, many unemployed sailors would live off selling self-made matchsticks, and using candles was tantamount to robbing these sailors of their pittance).
-   Ted Taylor, a nuclear physicist, used the reflected thermal pulse of a nuclear blast to light a cigarette at one of the atomic bomb tests.
-   Happens frequently at fire-dancer gatherings, usually with a cigarette held in the mouth. While few of them will admit it, this trick is so widespread because secretly, most of them aren't quite insane enough to carry a lighter in their pocket while spinning.
-   It at least used to be a common occurrence among welders... at least according to one former welder, anyway.
    -   Only TIG welders, since you use a torch for it. Which with no experience can more likely ruin the cigarette than make a clean light.
    -   You can light a cigarette using (usually red-hot) tip of ordinary electrode right after welding — no TIG required.
    -   Similarly, you can light it off the heat remaining in the workpiece.
    -   You can, of course, do it with the flame of an oxyacetylene torch as well. Though the other way round — lighting the torch off a cigarette — does **not** work no matter what you do.
-   If you have a gas stove with an electric starter, you can use it to light a cigar or cigarette — indeed, many people have. It isn't the safest thing in the world, but hey, desperate times call for desperate measures... we guess.
    -   You could do this with a gas stove without an electric starter if you have one of those nifty flameless ignition tools, although this is more dangerous (as they generally require more concentration to operate than a built-in electric starter). And of course, you **could** theoretically do it using a gas stove without either of those things...but in that case, why not just use the matches or lighter you used to light the stove to light your cigarette?
        -   Because the lighter tends not to be a flame, but a spark (they tend run out of juice to quickly if you keep them turned to the full setting).
    -   Of course, the **most** suitable gas stove for the job is one with pilot lights.
    -   It is possible, although neither pleasant nor advised, to light a cigarette on the hot wires inside a toaster.
        -   That's the idea behind hot-wire lighters in Chinese airports.
        -   An electric stove works on the same principles as a car lighter — enough heat conducts through the metal for the metal to radiate it.
        -   Actually it wasn't unheard of back in Soviet times. Lighters were relatively rare and while matches were sold everywhere, they tend to run out around midnight when the shops are closed... so that electric stove came handy (although the process was described as torturous by everyone involved).
-   The heat from molten glass (such as in a glass-blower factory) can be used to light a cigarette.
-   Lighting a cigarette off a lit blowtorch is not only possible but a lot easier than it would seem.
-   Lighting smokes from a Bunsen burner is pretty easy.
-   This guy<small>◊</small>, lighting a cig from a lit Molotov cocktail just before he throws it, in the January 2014 protests in Kiev.
    -   A long time ago during World War II, at least one German soldier light their cigarette with a flamethrower's pilot light<small>◊</small>.
-   Inversion: the glowing cigarette head is one of the safest and most convenient ways to ignite the fuse of fireworks.
-   While this is possible, it isn't recommended to do this with cigars - not because it's dangerous, however. Certain lighting methods negatively affect the flavor of the cigar, such as using a candle, liquid gas-based lighters or burning corpses. The best method is either a match or butane-based lighter.
-   Inversion: a college physics professor decided to try using liquid oxygen instead of lighter fluid for his charcoal grill. He accomplished this by throwing a lit cigarette onto the coals, then using a bottle of liquid oxygen on the end of a very long pole. He also wore a welder's mask and advised his guests not to look directly at the grill. The grill didn't survive.
