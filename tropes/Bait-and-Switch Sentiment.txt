Bait-and-Switch Sentiment: 
**Mike:** We have everything we need to win right here. _(Mike puts his hand on his chest.)_  
**Squibbles:** _\[smiles\]_ Heart.  
**Mike:** No, me! I'm going to win this for us.

Bait-and-Switch Sentiment describes an instance in which one character assumes that the actions or words of another are done, said for or even refer to a sentimental reason when the opposite is true. For example:

Alice and Bob have had it. No matter how many times Alice tells Bob that his socks don't belong on the floor, he just doesn't get the message. No matter how many times Bob tells Alice that there's no point in trying to vacuum the driveway, she insists that it has to be done. Naturally, the two get in a massive argument that culminates with Bob storming out of the house only to reenter seconds later. Alice smiles softly and says "I understand. You came back because you realized that we both have flaws and that it's best to work through them together instead of just running away from them." Bob responds "No. I forgot my car keys."

It is important to note that the execution of this trope doesn't require an argument (although it can certainly happen as a result of one especially if the Jerk With A Heart Of Jerk or Deadpan Snarker is involved). Gestures that get mistaken for sentimental ones can include anything from a pat on the back to single-handedly taking on an army of Mooks. If Alice assumes that Bob is finally confessing his love for her, that's Mistaken Declaration of Love. If Alice assumes that Bob's words demonstrate the depths of humanity's knowledge and wisdom on an often universal level, that's Mistaken for Profound. May often overlap with Poor Communication Kills or even Can't Kill You, Still Need You if the Hero mistakenly believes that the villain has spared him because he might be having a change of heart (or vice-versa). Dialogue based examples often take the form of a Bait-and-Switch Comment. Compare Bait-and-Switch Compassion, Are You Pondering What I'm Pondering?, Mistaken for Brooding, Moving Right Through and Failed Dramatic Exit.

Bait-and-Switch Sentiment Example in  Advertising

-   A Jack-In-The-Box commercial features Jack walking up to the concession stand of a movie theater. The vendor informs him that popcorn is seven dollars. Jack protests the price and adds that it isn't even a meal before telling the viewer about a deal at the restaurant. The ad pans back to the movie theater and Jack's wife consoling him, though she admits that she's surprised that a movie would cause him to cry. He responds, "No. I'm still sad about the popcorn."

Bait-and-Switch Sentiment Example in Anime & Manga

-   **Ah... and Mm... Are All She Says**: Toda blushes and gets wide-eyed when Tanaka says "I like you," but then says that she feels the same about Yanagi and Norush, two other mangaka at the magazine. Tanaka probably didn't even realize the inadvertent meaning her words had.
-   **Ah! My Goddess**:
    -   At one point in the Mara the demon possesses Keichii's sister Megumi and "confesses" her love to Belldandy. Mara's stunned when Bell says that she loves Megumi too… and Keichii, and Tamiya, and Ootaki, and her sisters…
    -   Belldandy, who initially seems to play this trope, flat out states that her wish to make Keiichi happy overrules her wish to make everyone in the world happy.
-   Played straight in the first School Festival arc in the **Asteroid in Love** manga, but averted in the anime, owing to the latter emphasizing the more sentimental elements of the work. When the Earth Sciences Club need help with their boring (as in drilling) sample, Ayano rounds up the baseball team. However, it quickly becomes apparent they've got the hots for Ayano herself. That was removed from the anime, however, making it appear the baseball team just has an excess of school spirit.
-   In **Boarding School Juliet**, when Inuzuka revealed his taboo relationship with Percia, an enemy soldier, Hazuki pulled him into a hug. Inuzuka thinks she's accepting him for who he is, but actually the 'hug' was Hazuki placing a ceremonial robe on him so he could commit seppuku honourably.
-   In **Cardcaptor Sakura**, after an exchange between Sakura and Tomoyo in which the both tell each other they like each other, the latter lampshades the trope by saying that "what you mean with like and what **I** mean with like are two very different things." Sakura fails to see the point.
-   A very serious example in **Fullmetal Alchemist**: During Hughes' funeral, Fuhrer Bradley appears to tremble when the deceased's child is crying. When Roy points this out later, Bradley explains he was actually shaking with rage, because he thought her crying was **annoying**.
-   A variation occurs in **Fushigi Yuugi**; When Nuriko confesses to Tamahome that he loves Miaka, he goes on to say, "For that matter, I love you too. I love Hotohori, Tasuki — all of them. I think that's what makes me a Suzaku warrior, and I'm **proud** of that." The whole speech is so vague that fans still dispute whether Nuriko was IN love with Miaka, or if he just really loved her as a friend.
-   In the end of episode 11 of **High School Star Musical**, Nayuki confesses his love to Hoshitani - alone in a classroom, passionately worded - and Hoshitani responds that he does, too - he loves the whole team.
-   In an **Ikki Tousen: Great Guardians** episode, Kan'u asks if Ryuubi does love her. Ryuubi says yes, which causes Kan'u to feel like she's in heaven… until Ryuubi continues that she likes the rest of the school members (Chouhi, Chou'un, Koumei, even Kouchuu)… which instantly petrifies Kan'u.
-   Subverted in **Kaguya-sama: Love Is War** when Ishigami offers a giant heart-shaped gift to Tsubame during the Devoted Hearts Festival (which is a sign of eternal love in-universe). Ishigami doesn't know the legend behind it due to having a very small social circle and was just giving it to her as thanks for all the times she's helped him out, but everyone else in the school interprets it as a Love Confession. Of course, Ishigami actually **does** have a crush on her and had been trying to find a way to confess, but he remains completely oblivious to the fact that he's already done so.
-   Early on in **Maison Ikkoku**, Godai receives a handmade scarf from Kyoko. He is dismayed when he learns that Mitaka received one as well. They debate whether that means she likes them equally, only to learn she made scarves for everyone at Ikkoku as thanks for taking care of her when she was sick.
-   Punchlines in **Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun** are often set up this way, with a character seemingly about to do or say something romantic/heartwarming but then doing something completely different.
    -   As Nozaki walks home with Sakura when sharing an Umbrella of Togetherness in the rain, he laments that he wishes time would stop. Sakura wonders if he's thinking the same thing (that he doesn't want to stop walking with her). It turns out Nozaki doesn't want time to stop because he's dreading coming home to wet laundry.
    -   Nozaki attempts a simulation where he, Sakura and Mikoshiba try to look for each other at the train station without using their phones. When reporting back to Miyamae, Nozaki notes there's some things that haven't changed compared to the olden days. Miyamae snarks to himself that he's probably going to say something cheesy like "the thrill of waiting to meet up". Nozaki's actual answer? "Lost child services." (Mikoshiba had reported himself as a lost child to make it quicker to find the others).
-   **Negima! Magister Negi Magi** uses this once or twice:
    -   Once when Negi tries to encourage Asuna to confess to Takahata — I've always liked you, Asuna \*gasp and blush\* And so does Konoka and everyone else!
    -   The second is when Negi is about to head to the Magical World, gets Asuna alone and asks her to come, seeming to imply a Relationship Upgrade on the pactio thing, and then invites everyone else along as well. Asuna's reaction is rather suspicious but ambiguous as well.
-   Happens rather deliberately in **Overlord (2012)**. When Ains tells Albedo that he loves all of the Floor Guardians, because they were created/programmed by his dear friends and guild-mates, she VERY DETERMINEDLY focuses on the fact that **she** is included in that group, and therefore, he loves her. It basically makes her lock up for a bit.
-   In **Reborn! (2004)** Tsuna is thrilled when his crush Kyoko gives him a charm thinking this means she likes him but is soon disappointed when he learns that she made some for Gokudera and Yamamoto too.
-   Done by Mihoshi in **Sora no Manimani**. After she apparently says "I love you!" to Saku, there's a beat, a chance for Saku and Hime to be stunned, followed by Mihoshi listing every other member of the Astronomy Club, leaving Saku and Hime stunned in a different way.
-   In the story that introduces Inaba in the final quarter of **Urusei Yatsura**, there is a sequence where Ataru Moroboshi, Lum and Shinobu Miyake go searching for a good future, only for none of them to find a future that makes them happy. Whilst griping, Lum disdainfully scoffs that Ataru is just upset that he can't find a future where he has a harem, but he shoots back that he's actually been looking for a "far more realistic" future, which he describes as a one-room apartment with him and Lum. The smitten oni has just enough time to start swooning before he adds that the room would **also** have all the pretty girls he chases on the regular. An enraged Lum points out that such a future is literally no different to the opulent harem he was looking for from the start.
-   **Yo-kai Watch** features this heavily in "Kyubi: Operation Heartbreak" The titular Yokai is capable of making people fall in love with him at a single glance. He has collected ninety-nine hearts and is endeavoring to collect one more to gain a promotion. He decides that Katie will be the one to give her heart to him before taking the form of a boy her age and attempting to woo her. However, every time Katie gives the signature lovestruck look that indicates Kyubi's powers are working, she turns out to be referring to something else i.e.: the beauty of a rose, remembering that she can just walk around the puddle that Kyubi placed his sweater over and that it was a shorter route home in addition or even remembering that she brought her own umbrella and doesn't need his to shield her from the rain.
-   **Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL**: Girag confronts Yuma when he finds out that Ray Shadows apparently attacked Alito. Yuma believes Ray would never do such a thing... because he believes Ray is incapable of pulling something off like this. Tori and Bronk don't disagree (which is saying something considering they called him out for shunning Ray off in the beginning). This is brought to light again when Yuma tells Astral that he doesn't believe Ray "could or even be able to" attack Alito like that.

    **Betty:** Because my crying makes you sad?  
    **Archie:** No, because it makes the popcorn soggy.
    
-   **Robin**: At one point Robin and his girlfriend Spoiler were chatting on a rooftop and she missed the point at which he switched from reciprocating in her flirting to worrying about their quarry. When she leaned in for a kiss she nearly landed on her face when he abruptly turned away to swing off the rooftop instead. Luckily Steph finds Tim's dedication to crimefighting endearing rather than annoying and found it hilarious that he completely failed to realize what she was about to do.

    -   In another scene, Sulley suggests to Mike that they replace their four teammates with scarier, more competent monsters. Mike retorts that they can't do that... because he checked, and it's against the rules.
-   **The Spongebob Squarepants Movie** ends this way too. After his adventures, Spongebob gets promoted to manager and this exchange occurs:
    
    **SpongeBob:** Wait a second, everybody. There's something I need to say first. I just don't know how to put it.  
    **Squidward:** I think I know what it is. After going on your life-changing journey, you now realize you don't want what you thought you wanted. What you really wanted was inside you all along.  
    **SpongeBob:** Are you crazy? **(Grabs manager pin)** I was just gonna say that your fly is down! **(Squidward's eyes widen)** Manager! This is the greatest day of my life!

-   **SpongeBob SquarePants**:
    -   Episode "Dumped." Gary shows a sudden and inexplicable urge to be around Patrick. He keeps covering Patrick with slime and SpongeBob tells Patrick that it's Gary's way of showing that he likes someone. After a few moments, SpongeBob expects Gary to return but he goes as far as deciding to stay with Patrick from then on. When the episode ends it's revealed that Gary wasn't showing Patrick affection; he just wanted the cookie in Patrick's back pocket.
    -   In "Fear of a Krabby Patty", SpongeBob dreams about a talking Krabby Patty.
        
        **Krabby Patty:** Remember, SpongeBob, I'll always be with you, **(points at his chest)** right here.  
        **SpongeBob:** In my heart?  
        **Krabby Patty:** Actually, in your arteries.
        
    -   In "Neptune's Spatula", after SpongeBob wins a cookoff with King Neptune and now has to live in his castle, Mr. Krabs is crying. SpongeBob thinks it's because Krabs is going to miss him, but it turns out that Krabs bet all his money on Neptune.
    -   "The Chaperone" has SpongeBob bidding Pearl goodnight after her prom at her front door when Mr. Krabs comes bursting through it while brandishing a rake and orders him to "get away from me precious little flower!" As he then cringes at his stance and Pearl is somewhat touched, he then continues with "You almost stepped on it!" as he begins raking the ground around an actual flower in the grass.
-   **Star vs. the Forces of Evil**:
    -   "Lava Lake Beach." Kelly speaks with Marco about how she and her boyfriend Tad have broken up and remarks that he's "still here" before placing her hand on her chest. Assuming that she means her heart, Marco starts into a speech about how Tad will always be there but that it gets easier. Kelly stops him and says that she meant Tad was still on top of her head and hadn't moved out yet.
    -   The episode "Starfari", towards the end. Buffrog is made Mewni's new Monster Expert after Star discovers that Jelly Goodwell's sanity was tenuous at best. Star places the "Monster Expert" pin on Buffrog's chest and notices his tears. She remarks "Aww you're crying." He responds "No. The badge. I think you broke the skin a little." Star apologizes and readjusts the badge.
-   **Ultimate Spiderman 2012** features this trope. In the episode entitled "The Avenging Spiderman," Loki tricks the titular character into switching bodies with him. By the time they switch back, Spiderman's friends are aware of what has happened but still believe that Loki is inhabiting Spiderman's Body. As a result, he avoids their attacks and tells them that Loki would fight back but that he won't. Nova throws a punch that stops only inches from Spiderman's nose, at which point this conversation occurs:
    
    **Iron Fist:** The purity of his actions convinced you!  
    **Nova:** **(Wafts at air in front of his face)** Purity nothing! The real Loki would never travel by sewer!
    
-   **Wander over Yonder** features this trope heavily in "The Axe." It is seen most notably when Hater tells Commander Peepers that they've been through a lot together. Peepers agrees and just a moment passes before Lord Hater asks him to keep the pictures but crop himself out of them. The ending subverts the trope. Having realized how much he needs Commander Peepers and given him the best apology he could muster, Lord Hater commissions a statue of Commander Peepers and places it right next to his own on their latest conquered planet.
