Dashing Hispanic: 
A cousin of the Stiff Upper Lip and Awesome Aussie, the Dashing Hispanic is a Stock Character that rose to popularity with the success of codifying franchises like _Zorro_. Almost always an Anti-Hero (with the occasional Anti-Villain), this character is a rogue, skilled with their weapon of choice be it sword, gun, bow or even their own fists, and either Hispanic in origin or that setting's equivalent.

They are charmers, always elegant, witty and quick-thinking, and popular with the ladies. Their fighting styles are more about being athletic and striking with finesse than clumsy swings or wild shots, and their actions are governed by a strict code of honor they adhere to. They usually have a habit of swearing vengeance on someone who's wronged them, and God help anyone who gets in the way of their revenge. Expect this trait to be played up in parodies.

Bonus points if he shares a name with a conquistador or an iconic Spanish author, if his Leitmotif sounds like _Carmen_ on steroids, or if other characters literally call him "the Spaniard." May also be a Latin Lover. Will probably make use of Gratuitous Spanish. If male, his love interest is almost inevitably a Spicy Latina.

See also Macho Latino.

If the work itself is created by a Hispanic creator for a Hispanic audience, this trope becomes incidental. While the character may read as such to an Anglophone audience, in its intended context he was merely a hot person.

Dashing Hispanic Example in Advertising

-   Irish soda brand Club Orange has an ad about a dashing Spanish Fruit Whisperer named El Zero, who promotes their "Zero" brand of sugar-free beverages.
-   Parodied in a British TV commercial for kitchen roll wherein Zorro-a-like Juan Sheet saves the "pretty ladies" of a bridal party from the horrors of spilled liquid on their dresses using only "Juan Sheet" of paper.
-   The Most Interesting Man in the World, spokesman for Dos Equis beer, has a Spanish accent and is always portrayed as suave and sophisticated yet badass, probably best summed-up by the line "He's a lover, not a fighter, but he's also a fighter, so don't get any ideas."

Dashing Hispanic Example in Anime & Manga

-   Spain from **Hetalia: Axis Powers**. Despite being more easygoing, he can certainly have his moments, especially during his imperial days. He definitely looks the part, however.
-   The El Dora V in **GUN×SWORD**. Seriously, for Super Robot Armor riders over 60, they didn't lose an ounce of badassery with age.
-   Capricorn El Cid from **Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas**. One of the 12 Gold Saints, the most powerful warriors among Athena's troops, and the provider of the longest Moment of Awesome in the series (almost two entire editions!!): he defeated two of the four Dream Gods sent by Hypnos even after losing his right arm. Through a Heroic Sacrifice, he also contributed to the fall of the fourth one, who had absorbed his dead siblings' souls and powers. Capricorn Shura, his successor in the original series, also counts, surviving losing all his senses during his fight against Virgo Shaka, except for the palate, receiving fourteen Scarlet Needles from Scorpion Milo and a couple of Lightning Plasmas from Leo Aiolia.
    -   About Shura, there's also his fight against the Bronze Saints, where his very first move created a **crevasse**. And that was just the beginning.
-   Mendoza from **The Mysterious Cities of Gold** is pretty much the only competent adult, never losing a one-on-one sword fight throughout the whole series. He's also the best helmsman and military strategist around, and on one occasion takes on a shark virtually barehanded.
-   In **Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL**, Yuma uses an Xyz Monster called Muzurhythm the String Djinn, who plays a short version of "pasodoble" music when it appears and attacks an opposing monster.
-   While the fantastic setting (and non-humanoid character design) makes it uncertain whether this trope fully applied in the original Japanese version of **Kirby: Right Back at Ya!**, Meta Knight has the sword, the sense of honor, and the Anti-Hero/Anti-Villain status, so the dubbers decided to give him a Hispanic accent.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
-   **One Piece**: Senor Pink, one of the executives of the Donquixote pirates, the one who dresses up as a baby, was one in his younger days. In fact, even with age and weight gain, every other character still acts like he is one.

Dashing Hispanic Example in Comic Books

-   Capitan Trueno, who is essentially the Spanish Prince Valiant.

-   Carlos La Muerto aka Black Tarantula from **Spider-Man**. The original Black Tarantula made his debut appearance by utterly demolishing Spider-Man in every encounter they had. Seriously, there wasn't a single confrontation between them that wasn't horrendously lopsided. Heck, one of Black Tarantula's flunkies made a habit of handing Spidey his backside. When she later got into a confrontation with Black Tarantula, he effortlessly killed her and then brought her back to life with his healing powers and put her back to work. Despite this, he was also a pretty honorable man and even had a Sympathy for the Hero moment with Spidey. This incarnation of Black Tarantula then experienced Badass Decay when he was later nearly killed by Bullseye with a single attack, and became something of an understudy to Daredevil.
    -   A new Black Tarantula exists in the alternate MC-2 Universe of **Spider-Girl**. Here, it's Fabian La Muerto, the son of the one Spider-Man used to fight and has become both an archvillain, and a love interest to Spider-Man's daughter, Spider-Girl. After an impressive Story-Arc in which he was trying to win her as his mate, but also deceive her into helping him become to new Kingpin of Crime, Spider-girl learned the truth and was prepared to go at him with everything she had. Upon realizing that she was serious, Black Tarantula promptly got down on his knees and surrendered rather than be forced to beat the woman he loved, showing hints of the Latin Lover trope as well. Almost as soon as the prisoner transport taking him away was gone, he easily escaped. He has since defeated and taken control over an organization of trans-dimensional assassins in order to force them to cancel the contract on Spider-Girl's life.
-   Another villain who qualifies — sort of — would be the mercenary La Tarantula. There have actually been two criminals to use this identity. Neither has really amounted to much.
-   The Matador, a minor villain of Daredevil.
-   Vargas from **X-Men** comics. In his debut, he took on a lineup of X-Men consisting of several veterans and a few newbies, with only two flunkies backing him up. Over the course of this single battle, he killed Psylocke and crippled Beast, while generally slapping the others around with little effort. He later beat Gambit in a card game, and always seemed to be several steps ahead of the X-Men both in direct physical combat and intellectually. Rogue was only able to defeat him by copying his abilities, and she was simultaneously using the abilities of many others whom she had copied in the past. Like Black Tarantula, he also experienced Badass Decay when he was later killed off-panel by third-rate villains.
-   Don Lope de Villalobos y Sangrin from **De Cape et de Crocs**. Much less of a charmer than most other examples, since he only has eyes for his lady (as the villainess found out to her displeasure) but very much a Master Swordsman. Besides, he's also an anthropomorphic wolf.
-   **Raptors**: Drago and Camilla were both born into Spanish nobility. Drago is a Tall, Dark, and Handsome gentleman while Camilla is a Spicy Latina vamp, and both are Hot-Blooded and graceful, deadly fighters.

Dashing Hispanic Example in Films — Animation

-   Puss in Boots from the **Shrek** films and spin-offs — voiced by the latest Zorro at that time, Antonio Banderas, coming from a fantasy equivalent of Spain.
-   Buzz Lightyear isn't one of these normally, but he briefly **becomes** one in **Toy Story 3** after his language setting is accidentally changed to Spanish.

---
Dashing Hispanic Example in Films — Live-Action

-   The titular character of Robert Rodriguez' El Mariachi Trilogy, especially the latter two movies, **Desperado** and **Once Upon a Time in Mexico**, where Mariachi is a vengeance-driven badass played by Antonio Banderas, who has made a career of playing these kinds of characters.
-   **Aliens**: Vasquez — muscular, silent, 100% professional, and absolutely badass. She also carries the biggest gun in the franchise.
-   **The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**: Tuco. Despite being called "The Ugly", he's a charismatic Unkempt Beauty; he looks like a scruffy Pedro Infante. "When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk."
-   El Wray in **Planet Terror**. Especially has a badass accent.

-   The Telmarine culture in the movie version of **Prince Caspian** is very obviously based on Golden Age Spain, so it wouldn't be much of a stretch to qualify Caspian as an example (bonus points for Ben Barnes basing his characterization on Inigo Montoya). His uncle Miraz, despite being a villain, also deserves a mention for his badassery. That said, Miraz is played by an Italian actor.
-   Carlos "Cougar" Alvarez in the 2010 movie **The Losers**. Dark, silent, brooding, and a Cold Sniper.
-   The Show Within a Show in **¡Three Amigos!** portrayed the characters as Dashing Mexican Hispanics. The real-world (in-movie) actors were neither.
-   **El Cid**: Given that it is a film about Spanish warriors that's kind of the point. And the title character is played by Charlton Heston, no less.
-   **Pirates of the Caribbean**:
    -   **Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides**: The Spaniard, King Philip's main agent entrusted with leading an expedition to the Fountain of Youth so that the Spanish can destroy it, seeing its power as an abomination against God. Apart from being a competent swordsman (like most of his crew) he's a Combat Pragmatist\- just look at him shooting an English marine who just claimed the Fountain in the name of King George and then asking "Someone make a note of that man's bravery."
    -   Armando Salazar from **Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales** is an evil version, played by actual Spaniard Javier Bardem, better known as Anton Chigurh in **No Country for Old Men**. A pirate hunter who went Knight Templar in an attempt to bring peace to the seas, and ended up becoming a Vengeful Ghost after Jack Sparrow tricked him to his death. Walks with the aid of two swords as crutches, looks straight-up horrific, speaks with a deep evil voice, can Walk on Water, and has his own semi-living ghost ship crewed by ghost sailors, a Living Figurehead, and several undead sharks. He's only "Dashing" by being Faux Affably Evil, though- after all, from his point of view, why waste good manners on pirates?
-   Gomez Addams in **The Addams Family** movies, played by the **very** dashing Raúl Juliá. Less so in the TV shows, where he is played by non-Hispanic actors.
-   Poe Dameron in **The Force Awakens**, despite its taking place in a different galaxy. He does nothing but run around performing heroic feats for La Résistance as an Ace Pilot. He's also from Yavin 4, the exterior shots for which were filmed in Guatemala, which is where his actor Oscar Isaac is from.
-   At first played straight in **Highlander** with suave (but a bit effete) swordsman and metallurgist Juan Sanchez Villalobos Ramirez, but ultimately subverted when Ramirez reveals himself to actually be Egyptian.
-   Maximus Decimus Meridius in **Gladiator** hails from the Roman province of Hispania and is referred by his initial nickname "The Spaniard". Just like Inigo Montoya, he is also motivated by revenge.

Dashing Hispanic Example in Literature

-   **Zorro**: Zorro, the Spanish nobleman who fights for the oppressed Mexican peasants and honest citizens of the **pueblo** of Los Angeles, is the Trope Codifier.
-   Eurico the Presbyter is a Visigothic Spaniard example, but still counts being a priest-turned-knight that is monstrously powerful in combat and becomes the scourge of the Arabs, who refer to him as a demon in human form.
-   **The Princess Bride**: Inigo Montoya — a noble, honorable swordsman who's only working for Vizzini to pay the bills, he's really focused on revenge for his father's murder by a six-fingered man. He also allows the Dread Pirate Roberts a few moments to catch his breath before dueling him. In the end, Inigo pulls a Heel–Face Turn (though he didn't have far to turn in the first place), and unites with Wesley to help rescue Buttercup.
-   Diego Alatriste y Tenorio definitely counts, either in the original novels or the film, in which he is played by Viggo Mortensen.
-   Jeronimo, otherwise known as "El Desamparado", of Neal Stephenson's **The Baroque Cycle**.
-   Ruy Sanchez de Casador y Ortiz, from the 1632 universe, embodies this one. One character theorizes that he was the basis for Inigo Montoya.
-   First Marshall Roque Alva from **Reflections of Eterna** embodies this trope as fully as Inigo Montoya above. In fact, it appears that he (and the entire series, by extension) was created exclusively out of the author's fascination with the archetype...
-   Also, Raphael Kerna from **Arcia Chronicles** by the same author is the exiled prince of the Fantasy Counterpart Culture of Spain, who is a master fencer, a toreador, a favorite of the Arcian ladies, as well as The Lancer and (unwittingly) brother-in-law to The Hero Alexander.
-   In Greg Keyes' **Kingdoms of Thorn and Bone** Cazio fits this, being from a Fantasy Counterpart Culture crossbreed between Spain and Italy.
-   Rainbow Six the novel features Francisco De La Cruz, a guy who attacks a terrorist armed with an UZI with a sword.
-   **Gone**: Edilio is a teenage illegal immigrant from Honduras who ends up as the leader of Perdido Beach's militia once everyone over the age of 14 disappears.
-   Esteban Trueba from Isabel Allende's **The House of the Spirits**. As there is likely quite a bit of true-life content in that novel, Trueba and possibly Allende may be candidates for the "Real Life" section.
    -   More of a Magnificent Bastard, really. Emphasis on the "bastard" part.
-   Colonel Aureliano Buendía certainly qualifies.
-   **World War Z** has the story of an L.A. gang member, deported to El Salvador just before the war, who fights his way north through Mexico, on foot, armed only with a machete, during the height of the Great Panic. He makes it back to the U.S., joins the army, and serves heroically, but then is killed just as the war is nearing its end.
-   In Poul Anderson's Time Travel novella "The Year of the Ransom," Don Luis Ildefonso Castelar y Moreno, one of Pizarro's conquistadors, is captured by genetically enhanced supermen from the 31st Millennium; he gets away from them<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> and rescues a member of the Time Patrol to pilot a timecycle. Then Don Luis **quickly** learns to pilot the thing himself, strands his reluctant teacher in a peaceful backwater of time, and begins making plans to revise history in favor of the Spanish Empire. A hellacious fighter with an impressive intellect; the Time Police agents regretted that his worldview wouldn't let him join them, because he'd have been a highly desirable recruit otherwise.
    
    A killer, a racist, a fanatic; a man of his word, fearless, ready to die for king or comrade; Charlemagne dreams, tender little memories of his mother, poor and proud in Spain. Kind of humorless, but a flaming romantic.
    
-   Oberyn Martell of **A Song of Ice and Fire** comes from the Spanish Fantasy Counterpart Culture region of Dorne, and is a snarky aristocrat known for his prowess with weaponry (poisoned by preference), as well as for his promiscuity. He even fights a duel that is a clear Shout-Out to Inigo Montoya's famous one. His brood of illegitimate daughters are female examples, in particular Nymeria Sand. The charming and dangerous assassin Jaqen H'ghar also displays elements of the trope.
-   **The Dresden Files**: Carlos Ramirez is the youngest wizard to be made regional commander of the Wardens of the Council in history, and has the appropriate amount of combat prowess and charm to back it up. He loves to brag and joke about both his skills and his prowess with the ladies. Subverted, in the sense that he's also a virgin.
-   **Imagine Someday**: Diego Avery shows shades of this, though he's not much of a fighter and he's only half Hispanic.
-   **Monday Begins on Saturday**: Cristobal Junta is an older, past-his-prime example, with his cool wit, fearsome reputation and a bit of a habit for challenging those who wronged him — including his friends — to duels.

Dashing Hispanic Example in Live-Action TV

-   The eponymous hero of the 1950s and 1990s **Zorro** series.

-   **Game of Thrones** universe:
    -   **Game of Thrones**:
        -   Syrio Forel was the First Sword of Bravos, the Fantasy Counterpart Culture of Spain mixed with Venice, and was hired to teach Arya how to fight with a one-handed blade. When the Stark household's servants are being slaughtered, Syrio buys time for Arya to escape by fighting five armed and armoured guards with only a wooden sword, incapacitating or killing all of them before having his sword broken. His last scene in the series has him still ready to fight.
        -   Later in the series Prince Oberyn Martell, The Red Viper of Dorne (which can also be considered to be a Fantasy Counterpart Culture to Spain) is introduced, who has all the trappings: cocky, charming, debonair, hot-blooded, a connoisseur of beautiful women and men without distinction, hell-bent on revenge, a master of poisons and a quick and talented fighter.
    -   **House of the Dragon**: Subverted with Criston Cole. He's got Dornish-like (equivalent of Hispanic) good looks Rhaenyra falls for for a time and he's definitely a skilled warrior, but it becomes clear as Season 1 goes that deep down he's culturally Andal (i.e. monogamous and not taking Rhaenyra's rejection well).
-   As a result of being played by a Mexican actor affecting a vaguely Hispanic accent, **Hawkeye (2021)**'s version of Jacques Duquesne evokes the Dashing Hispanic archetype with his suaveness, class, and swordsmanship. He is even introduced with a rose in his mouth for his new fiancee Eleanor.
-   The short-lived television series **Mr. Lucky** featured Ross Martin (later of **The Wild Wild West** fame) as Andamo, a dashing, roguish, quick-witted and quick-fisted native of the fictional Caribbean island-nation of Guatamaca.
-   **The Ministry of Time**: Alonso de Entrerríos and Real Life poet Lope de Vega.
-   Subverted in **Sense8**'s first episode as it sequentially introduces its international cast. The Mexican Lito is introduced as a dashing Action Hero about to shoot a priest in the head... until it turns out it was a shoot for a telenovela. Lito himself dislikes conflict and is a noncombatant, often tapping into Will, Wolfgang, or Sun when physical violence is needed.
-   **Veronica Mars**: Most of the PCHers qualify, but most particularly Weevil/Eli. He's a gangster who nevertheless loved Lilly, is very handy in a fight, comes to care deeply for Veronica and will defend her whenever she needs it, and has the standards not to sell drugs.
-   **It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia**: The emotionally-sensitive Ernesto.
-   Lalo Salamanca of **Better Call Saul** is a particularly dark and villainous example, being a sociopathic, homicidal cartel member, but definitely checks the boxes of being smooth, charming, a little over the top, and, as of the final season, revenge motivated.

Dashing Hispanic Example in Pro Wrestling

-   "Mr. **Ray**tings" Ray González, "Patriarch" of La Familia de Milenio en IWA PR and WWC, Jack of All Trades, possessor of a picture-perfect phoenix splash and hardly bad looking.
-   WWC Junior Heavyweight Champion Angel Fashion sees himself this way. He is an athletic pretty boy alright but it'll take a lot more than a few title belts to justify his ego though.

Dashing Hispanic Example in Roleplay

-   **We Are All Pokémon Trainers**: Milagros is this to some extent.

---
Dashing Hispanic Example in Tabletop Games

-   The Crimson Fists in **Warhammer 40,000** are an entire Space Marine chapter of Dashing Hispanic Super Soldiers. Note that they were originally supposed to be Germanic-themed like the rest of the Imperial Fist successors, but then one of the writers decided to give one of their main characters a Spanish-sounding name and subsequent authors ran with it from there.
    
    -   One of their better-known members is Captain Alessio Cortez, quite possibly the single toughest Space Marine on record, having had every bone in his body broken at least twice, 'disarmed' an ork warboss by killing it while its weapon was embedded in his ribcage, once led a defense for six hours despite suffering from a broken back, and then there's this gem of a Major Injury Underreaction:
    
    I haven't lost an arm, brother. It's over there.
    
-   **Sentinels of the Multiverse**: A female example, and Lethal Joke Character, is La Capitan Maria Helena Teresa Fafila Servanda Jimena Mansuara Paterna Domenga Gelvira Placia Sendina Belita Eufemia Columba Gontina Aldonza Mafalda Cristina Tegrida de Falcon, a Dashing Hispanic Time Pirate swashbuckling villain and one of the most terrifying antagonists — despite officially being rated 2/4 in terms of power, her Badass Crew and personal willingness to avenge every one of their deaths make her astonishingly powerful.
-   **Lots** of heroic characters (possibly including the PCs) in the old Red Steel setting fit the Trope, given the setting's emphasis on swashbuckling in a fantasy equivalent of Spain.
-   The Estalian Diestro career from the second edition of **Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay**. Estalia is the settings Fantasy equivalent of Spain and the Diestro is described as a master swordsman (or woman). Their beginning possessions include not simply a rapier, but a set of fine clothes and a bottle of cologne or perfume!
-   The Legion of Dusk in **Magic: The Gathering** are basically a fantasy version of Spanish conquistadors if they were vampires who were fiercely devout as their historical counterparts and even have their own Inquisition.

---
Dashing Hispanic Example in Theatre

-   The Cid (see Real Life) from Pierre Corneille's play of the same name.
-   Averted with Pedro Crespo, the titular hero of **The Alcalde of Zalamea** by Pedro Calderón de la Barca. Proud to be a commoner, he stands up to overbearing officers and noblemen, winning the respect of real-life badass general Don Lope de Figueroa, but he is neither dashing nor a charmer, but a sober badass widower who only uses violence when there are no other options left. Don Alvaro de Ataide is a villainous example of this trope, however.
-   **Cesare - Il Creatore che ha distrutto** — the opening of act 2 is Rodrigo singing about how glamorous and sexy Spain is. Miguel (a.k.a. Cesare's right-hand assassin Michelotto) and the other Spanish students dance elegantly. This is juxtaposed with the entrance of the Florentines, who seem nerdy in comparison. Cesare himself doesn't appear in that scene, but he definitely also counts.

---
Dashing Hispanic Example in Video Games

-   **Resident Evil**:
    -   Carlos Oliveira of **Resident Evil 3: Nemesis** tries to invoke this, claiming that all the "foxy ladies" love his accent. We say "tries" because he only ever has the accent half the time, and because depending on where you first meet him, Jill will either immediately shoot his flirting down or simply ignore it altogether. His characterization in the remake drops the accent completely but splits the difference on his charm; his flirting is a lot less awkward, but he also has the sense to dial it back when it's clear that Jill has more important things to deal with.
    -   Luis Sera from **Resident Evil 4**. Pulls Leon's ass out of the fire several times during the game, and thinks that's a little rough, don't you think? We find out even later that toting guns and hitting on women isn't even his profession—he's a **scientist** for his day job.
-   Col. Corazon Santiago, of **AlphaCentauri** fame, leads the Spartans — a faction dedicated to survivalist tactics, guns aplenty, and military discipline even in civilian life. She gets some of the most badass quotes in the game, too.
    
    "Superior training and superior weaponry have, when taken together, a geometric effect on overall military strength. Well-trained, well-equipped troops can stand up to many more times their lesser brethren than linear arithmetic would seem to indicate."
    
    -   Basically, "We can kick your ass with half as many troops as you." Too bad the Spartan Federation tend to be one of the first factions eradicated (when you're not playing as them), since The Believers tend to have four times as many troops as the Spartans.
-   Miguel Caballero Rojo of **Tekken**. Complete with Spanish accent. And a dead little sister to compensate for Inigo Montoya's dead father.
-   **Carmen Sandiego** is often regarded as ambiguously Hispanic, and could be considered a rare female example of the Trope. (She doesn't fit the related Tropes for females, being more of a Gentleman Thief, another case where she Gender Flips a Trope.)
-   Even though the game doesn't have voice actors for its dialogue, Matador from **Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne** is a definite example when you face him. He also uses a saber and capote, as befits his status as a...well...matador.
-   Vega, the claw-wielding, wall-jumping Spanish ninja/bullfighter from the **Street Fighter** series. In fact, he wears that mask to protect his dashing looks.
-   While not really Spanish, Al-Cid Margrace from **Final Fantasy XII** has the accent, and acts really badass. His design aesthetic is very much based on the idea of the Latin lover. His name is even inspired by 11th Century Valencian prince Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, commonly known as "El Cid".

-   Spanish undead pirate Cervantes from **Soulcalibur**. At least, in his first two appearances where he still resembled a normal human; since then he's become more undead-looking and Obviously Evil.
    -   And Raphael, despite being from France, wields a Rapier and dresses more like a Spaniard than a Frenchman. This is explained in **Soulcalibur VI**, where it's revealed that he spent a few years in Spain in exile, where he learned Spanish fencing, and then he mixed it with his own French style.
-   **Punch-Out!!**'s Don Flamenco, especially in the Wii Version, which gave him a more serious-looking design, made him less of a pushover to defeat<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>, and gave him a gruff-sounding voice and dialog in his native language (i.e. Castilian Spanish).
-   Roberto from **Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams**. Technically, he's only half-Spanish, but he's the strongman of the group, and while others rely on weapons to dispatch demons, he does it bare-handed.
-   You get attacked by an Inigo Montoya parody at the entrance to the palace at Arcourt in the **Neverwinter Nights** module **The Bastard of Kosigan**.
-   **Dragon Age**:
    -   The elven assassin Zevran from **Dragon Age: Origins**. Ironically, Antiva (the country he hails from) is a "fictionalized version of a medieval **Italian** state, akin to Venice".
    -   Also Isabela, who is a Pirate Girl from Rivain (which is based on Spain under Islamic occupation) despite her Ferelden accent indicating otherwise.

-   From a previous Suda51 game, we have **Killer7**'s Mexican Mask de Smith, a soft-spoken man who dual-wields grenade launchers, suplexes pillars, and in one cutscene **headbutts a bullet out of the air**.
-   Agent Ramon in **Syndicate** (2012), who serves the Latin American Cayman Global syndicate.
-   **Mass Effect: Andromeda** brings us Reyes Vidal. He can be quickly summarized as Mass Effect's version of Hispanic Han Solo. He fits the Latin Lover trope, too, as at least under some conditions, a player character of either sex can choose to initiate a relationship with him. He's a smuggler modeled on a cowboy gunslinger that challenges Sloane Kelly to a Hollywood-style Quick Draw duel. He also knows a lot more than he lets on, since he is the Charlatan, head of a rival gang to Sloane's Outcasts.
-   Lady Maria in **Nioh** is another rare female example, since she is a graceful Spanish Lady of War that fights with a Royal Rapier. Also doubles as an evil example since she serves as a Greater-Scope Villain to Date Masamune in the **Dragons of the North** DLC, secretly acting as an agent for the Spanish Empire to steal Amrita.
-   Meta Knight from **Kirby** manages to fit the bill while being a ball-shaped alien under a foot high, thanks to his fierce code of honor, usual Spanish accent, and skill with a Cool Sword.
-   **Red Dead Redemption II** shows that Mexican-born Javier Escuella was quite a looker, his biography describing him as someone who always takes a lot of care for his appearance. Sadly, by 1911, most of his looks have faded, and he ends up looking rather rat-like and sleazy.

Dashing Hispanic Example in Web Animation

-   Subverted in **Nomad of Nowhere** with Red Manuel, who certainly looks the part, but is shown to be utterly pathetic in practice.

---
Dashing Hispanic Example in Web Comics

-   Elan's teacher Julio Scoundrél in **The Order of the Stick** alludes to this with his first name, prestige class ("Dashing Swordman") and mustache. He's also a rogue and a charmer, and lots of his previous adventures were about liberating the unwilling future brides of a tyrannical warlord.
-   Gordito the gunslinging youth from **Dr. McNinja**, and his former clan of velociraptor-riding banditos.

Dashing Hispanic Example in Web Original

-   In **Worm**, Quinn Calle, a supervillain defense attorney, is exceedingly well-groomed and quite handsome aside from the scar on his face.

Dashing Hispanic Example in Web Videos

-   Angry Joe is occasionally made of this trope.
-   **Avatar: The Abridged Series** inexplicably makes Haru into one of these — but hey, Rule of Funny.

Dashing Hispanic Example in Western Animation

-   **Looney Tunes**: Speedy Gonzales is both a figurative and a literal dashing Hispanic. Also, even though his shorts were perceived as potentially offensive to Latin Americans and Spaniards, he eventually became a popular cartoon character in Mexico. Word of God says he's a hero because he always uses his speed unselfishly for his community.
-   **The Fairly OddParents!** has Juandissimo, Wanda's handsome, smooth-talking ex-boyfriend who occasionally schemes to win her away from Cosmo.
-   **Gravity Falls**: In "The Deep End", Mabel falls for a suave, Mexican-accented, tweenage merman named Mermando.
-   Alejandro in **Total Drama** is a villainous example. He is shown to have many skills and is admired by most of the contestants until they discover his true, sinister nature. In fact, he actually throws in Gratuitous Spanish whenever he is frustrated, and the fifth season gives him a Spanish leitmotif that is based on Zorro's theme.
-   The entire cast of **¡Mucha Lucha!** is made up of dashing Hispanics.
-   José Carioca, anyone? He's deliberately based on the Brazillian "malandro" (suave crook/ladies man) stereotype, and the internet has more than a few full-grown women crushing on him, despite the fact that he's a parrot.
-   Hector Con Carne from **Evil Con Carne** was hinted to be this before his body was blown up and he was reduced to a disembodied brain. He has a Spanish accent, his body in flashbacks is shown to be huge and muscular, and Major Doctor Ghastly is sometimes implied to have a crush on him.
-   Dark Crow is this in the **Larry-Boy** cartoon series. He speaks with a Spanish accent and likes to dance. His most common weapons are a crowbar to attack villains and yo-yos to tie them up. He also has claws to help him reach high places and do dramatic flights while going, "Ca-caw!". Unlike Larry-Boy, he takes his job seriously and doesn't goof things up.
