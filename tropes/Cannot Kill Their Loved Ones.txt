Cannot Kill Their Loved Ones: 
This isn't even the worst thing that happened in that episode...

_"I cannot kill my friend." \[to henchmen\] "Kill my friend."_

When friends become enemies, sometimes they can't bring themselves to kill each other.

When a character's significant other is possessed or zombified, sometimes they can't bring themselves to kill them.

Whatever the case, Everyone Has Standards, and many people have someone they just can't bring themselves to kill. Some people can get around this by letting someone else kill their loved one for them.

Often overlaps with Fighting Your Friend, Defeat Means Friendship, and possibly Tragic Monster or "I Know You're in There Somewhere" Fight, depending on the cause of the fight. It can be related to Even Evil Has Loved Ones (and its subtropes Villainous Parental Instinct and Even Bad Men Love Their Mamas). The loved one in question is often a Morality Chain or Morality Pet. Likewise can overlap with Shapeshifter Guilt Trip if the story deals with evil being who can shapeshift.

If the loved one is possessed or zombified, then it overlaps with Supporting the Monster Loved One.

Might come in conjunction with Even Evil Has Standards if the villain has someone they care about.

-   **Fairy Tail**: In the final arc Erza and Wendy are pitted against Irene Belserion, one of the 12 guards of the Spriggan Empire who reveals herself to be Erza's mother. She explains she was a dragon slayer whose power turned her into a dragon. Zeref gave her back a humanoid form centuries later, but the loss of her senses drove her mad and she had planned to take Erza's body after she was born. However her motherly instinct prevented her from going through with it and she gave up Erza for adoption to protect Erza from herself. In the present time, Irene claims she doesn't care about Erza anymore and tries kill her. After taking a mortal blow from Erza, Irene has enough strength to finish her weakened daughter. But when given the chance, finds she **still** can't go through with it as deep down she still loves Erza and ultimately kills herself in the end.
-   **Saint Seiya**: A baddie in the Poseidon arc exploits this by taking the appearance of the Saints' loved ones so he can assassinate them. Even when they know it's an impostor, they still hesitate long enough to give him an opening. Except Phoenix Ikki, who takes the opportunity to give him a taste of his own medicine. Turns out the baddie is so cowardly he can't kill a **copy of himself**, something that would never stop the Saints since they're all willing to die for their cause.
-   **School-Live!**: Being a story about survivors of a zombie apocalypse, there are some examples of this trope.
    -   When Kurumi finds a zombified Megu-nee in the school basement (and a zombified Taromaru in the anime), she is unable to kill her, causing her infection.
    -   In the anime version, Yuuri can't bring herself to kill Kurumi to prevent her zombification. In the manga, however, it is unclear if Yuuri would have accomplished it, since Miki arrived with the cure before she could decide.
    -   Near the end of the manga, while trying to return with the water to save Kurumi, Miki meets a zombified Kei, her former best friend, so she is unable to kill her, leading to Miki being bitten.
