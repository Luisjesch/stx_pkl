Clothing Appendage: 
If that's supposed to be the jellyfish's head, why does it look like a hat?

**SpongeBob**: Wow. I didn't know this \[crown\] was a hat.  
_(Cut to Kevin with a hole in his head where the crown used to be)_

In works of fiction that feature Funny Animals, Beast Men, Humanoid Aliens, or other similar non-human species, characters in these groups can run the gamut from Exposed Extraterrestrials to Accessory Wearing Cartoon Animals to Half Dressed Cartoon Animals to Barefoot Cartoon Animals to Fully Dressed Cartoon Animals. Among some of the species that _do_ wear clothes, however, you may notice upon closer inspection that a character's "clothes" actually seem to grow from their bodies as appendages or other parts of their bodies.

For example, the White Gloves may actually be the color of the character's hands. If the character is a Plant Person, the "clothes" may be extra long leaves or flowers. If the characters are Fish People, the "clothes" may be fins. If the characters are Bird People, the "clothes" may be feathers or even an extra set of wings. Insectoid Aliens and other arthropoid creatures may feature "clothes" that are extensions of their exoskeletons. In rare cases, this can even occur with otherwise mundane humans, usually as the result of shapeshifting or some kind of freakish mutation.

Contrast with Fur Is Clothing, when seemingly unclothed animals remove their fur/feathers/scales/etc. as articles of clothing. Supertrope to Organic Bra and Crown-Shaped Head. See also Technically Naked Shapeshifter.
