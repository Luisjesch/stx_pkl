Adopting the Abused: 
A character comes from an abusive background, be it physical, mental, emotional, neglectful, or, in all too many cases, sexual. The result is that they are worn down.

And then, just when they are approaching the edge of the Despair Event Horizon, someone steps in for their betterment. Sometimes it's a single individual. Other times it's a larger family unit. Often this will be a Family of Choice. Whatever the case, our waif has escaped misery and despair for a loving, stable family.

This could be the finale, making it overlap with Earn Your Happy Ending. It also could be part of a Dark and Troubled Past, often exposed with a Somber Backstory Revelation. The adoptee might even need to be told about their tragic past, as it might have occurred when they were too little to remember.

In some instances, this could suffer a false start or two, where the adoptive family turns out to be as bad as or worse than the situation being fled, exchanging one type of abuse and manipulation for another. The result can be that our victim is wary and gun-shy when someone genuinely good steps into their life. There's a chance that this good person will be _horrified_ at what their new friend/charge/family member went through, especially if they're a child.

Expect a character who has been rescued in such a fashion to be more than willing to pay it forward in successive storylines.

See also Heal the Cutie and Recruited from the Gutter. Subtrope of Happily Adopted. This experience with abuse may cause adoptees to worry about their Villainous Lineage and doubt themselves. The most common method of the adopter taking in the abused is I'm Taking Her Home with Me!. See also Interspecies Adoption, for when the adoptee isn't even the same species as the adopter.

Given that abuse is a sensitive subject, No Real Life Examples, Please!.

Adopting the Abused Example in Anime & Manga

-   **The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You**: Mei's parents were crippled by Loan Shark debts, leading them to abuse and later disown her, leaving her believing that her life had no value whatsoever. She would've frozen to death if she wasn't found by Hahari, who offered to adopt her into her family. Mei, however, turned down the offer in favor of the Adopt-a-Servant approach, though the Hanazonos still treat her as though she were family.
-   **Elfen Lied**: Mayu was sexually abused by her stepfather. And when she told her mother, she blamed Mayu for the abuse, claiming her husband showed no interest in her because Mayu was around. Mayu ran away from home, where she ran into Kohta and Yuka. A brief scene is shown where Mayu's mother is seen signing her parental rights over to Yuka.
-   **Fairy Tail**: Lucy as a child suffered from Parental Neglect for several years courtesy of her father Jude after her late mother Layla passed away. This ended up negatively affecting Lucy to the point where she is introduced as a moody Jerk with a Heart of Gold in contrast to the Nice Girl that she used to be when she was a child. All of that Parental Neglect culminated in her running away from home and joining the Fairy Tail guild who welcomed her with open arms as family, with the initial exception of Laxus, and have repeatedly shown being incredibly protective of her, most notably during the Phantom Lord arc. Lucy over the course of the series comes to reciprocate their love towards her and comes to see the Fairy Tail guild as being a much kinder and more loving second family to her than her own father Jude ever was, with guild master Makarov even admitting in the final chapter of the series while drunk that he views Lucy as being like a daughter to him. All of this positivity helps Lucy to heal from her pain over the course of the series leading her to develop back into the Nice Girl she always was deep down.
-   In **Make the Exorcist Fall in Love**, Father was a Death Seeker looking to martyr himself to escape the abuse and misery he suffered at the hands of the Catholic Church by the time he turned twelve.

They do so, and from then on Leslie's life vastly improves under their care.
-   In **My Hero Academia**, Eri was horribly abused by the villain Overhaul as part of his plan to create bullets embedded with her Quirk factor to depower superheroes and put the yakuza back on the map. By the end of the arc, Eri is taken in by U.A. for her protection and given a loving and safe environment where she's not exploited or ostracized for her powerful but highly dangerous Quirk. She's also supervised by Aizawa so she can practice using her Quirk to heal small animals while he uses his Quirk to turn her powers off if she loses control.
-   Most of the cast of the **Lyrical Nanoha** franchise are Happily Adopted so this comes up a lot. It's most prominently seen with series Deuteragonist Fate Testarossa, who was horrifically abused (both physically and emotionally) by her biological mother before eventually being adopted into the Harlaown family. She even continues the process from the other side as an adult, adopting several children of her own who came from similar backgrounds.
-   **One Piece:** In his heart-wrenching backstory, Chopper was a reindeer born with a blue nose, who the rest of his herd perpetually neglected due to this abnormality. Things got even worse when he ate the Human-Human Fruit which granted him anthropomorphism, and the herd cast him altogether. Then Chopper would try to meet and befriend humans by using the fruit's power to assume a tall and burly humanoid form, but this resulted in him looking like a sasquatch, and the humans shot at him in fear. After all of that hardship, he'd finally be adopted by the kindly Dr. Hiruluk who treated Chopper like a son and taught him the virtues of love and healing (this didn't last). Nowadays, Chopper has a place among the found family that is the Straw Hat Pirates surrounded, having people who love and accept him for who he is.

    -   Chimchar from **Diamond and Pearl** was owned by Ash's rival, Paul, who he released during the Tag Battle tournament for failing him to use his power. This wasn't helped by the fact that it was put through intense training to get him to unleash his Blaze ability. Ash later caught it and evolved it into an Infernape which later beat Paul during the Sinnoh League.
    -   Tepig from **Black and White** was left tied to a post by his former trainer Shamus and almost starved. When Ash confronted the former trainer, Tepig managed to evolve into a Pignite and defeat his former trainer.

-   **New Stars**: CT-5599, or Maxx, was a clone soldier of the Republic who was viewed as little more than a slave by many, and had no power over his destiny (as his training had brainwashed him into believing that doing anything other than be a soldier was an act of desertion).

-   **Beetlejuice**: Lydia Deetz is shown to be a sad, lonely girl who doesn't see eye-to-eye with her stepmother and whose father (despite trying to be supportive) tends to get too absorbed in his work or hobbies to really spend time with her. She's also the only one at first who can see the Maitlands, and she becomes the first human friend they've had since their deaths. They become second parents for her, as they actually listen to her and help her more than her real parents do. The ending shows the Maitlands and Deetzes peacefully living together, with the Maitlands celebrating with Lydia after she got an A on her math test.
-   **Matilda** ends with the titular girl asking to be adopted by Miss Honey rather than taken along with her parents who are moving away to avoid the cops.

-   **Silent Fall**: Dr. Jake Rainer, at the end of the film, has apparently adopted the autistic Tim Warden, who was being sexually abused by his late father. Tim's biological father and mother were killed by his older sister, who had suffered the same abuse at her father's hands, and snapped when she caught her father abusing her little brother.
-   **X-Men** doesn't shy away from the fact that mutants are feared, distrusted, even outright hated by a majority of the world's population, even the mutant children. So, when mutant kids first reveal their powers (either as young children like Iceman or teenagers like Rogue), they typically end up living on the streets after either running away from or being rejected by their families. Professor X takes in any mutant who needs help, and turned his mansion into a school/home for the many mutant children he's taken in. Several of them were so grateful for his kindness that they stayed on to become teachers at the school (namely Cyclops, Jean, and Storm).

Adopting the Abused Example in Literature

-   **Anne of Green Gables**: Since being orphaned at a few months old, Anne has had two foster families and lived in an orphanage. With her first guardians, the Thomases, the husband drank and had unpredictable tempers that Anne witnessed, while in the second family, the Hammonds, Anne was basically a child servant looking after their other eight children, often not eating much.

But on his first outing as a pickpocket, Oliver is instead taken in by his intended victim, Mr. Brownlow, then the Maylie family after Fagin reenters his life and forces him to attempt another robbery, before ultimately ending up in the care of Mr. Brownlow again, after a series of circumstances reveals that Oliver is actually from a well-to-do family and was sent to the orphanage by his evil half-brother to keep Oliver from his rightful share of the inheritance. In fact, Mrs. Maylie is his maternal aunt.
-   Many of Roald Dahl's children's books used this trope:
    -   In **The BFG**, Sophie admits to the Big Friendly Giant that the orphanage she lived in wasn't very good, with the head of the orphanage giving the girls awful punishments for the slightest mistake. The giant instantly decides to take her in as his own.
    -   In **James and the Giant Peach**, James spends four years being starved, bullied, beaten, and mistreated by his aunts Spiker and Sponge. Said aunts are hated by all of the creatures that live in their garden, namely the bugs that James goes on his journey with.

    -   **Matilda**: Matilda is raised by two neglectful parents who heavily believe in anti-intellectualism and insult her for not being more like them. Matilda's father Harry tears up a library book she borrowed because he thinks it's a waste of time. They even leave her home alone to play bingo or to go to work when she's just a kid. When Matilda starts to go to school, she strikes up a bond with her teacher Miss Honey, who actually admires her intelligence and accepts her for who she is.

The same season also sees Carver trying to adopt Randy Wagstaff, whose home was just firebombed leaving him homeless and with his foster mother in a coma, but Carver's lack of resources get in the way and Randy ends up in a dangerous group home. Similarly, Pryzbylewski helps out with the severely neglected Duquan, taking his laundry and packing extra lunch to give him, but is limited in how much he can help, and the last he sees of him is when he comes to him to very obviously scam him for money, which Prez does give him but tells him he doesn't expect to see him again.

Adopting the Abused Example in Video Games

-   **ANNO: Mutationem**: This is alluded in Holtz' personal journal at the Flores household. He found Nakamura covered in bruises before he adopted her and would later found out the injuries were entirely from an terrible orphanage. Before long, she became a popular bartender in the hometown of Margarita.
-   **Dragalia Lost**: Before the events of the game begin, the relationship that Euden and Zethia had with their siblings was... not healthy. The Alberian Royal Family is filled to the brim with Big Brother (and one Sister) Bullies who constantly pushed Euden and Zethia around in their childhoods. Even when most of them were old enough to start living their own lives, they still continued to push around Euden and Zethia while they were still living with their father. However, the game starts with them going on a mission for Euden to form a pact with Midgardsormr. Once they're done, though, circumstances prevent them from returning home, and Zethia ends up getting kidnapped. It's not all bad, because on his way to form the pact, Euden found some new friends, where they all move into Midgardsormr's castle, the Halidom, where they quickly become a happy Family of Choice that only grows larger as the game progresses. Even Zethia found her own found family while she was kidnapped because it turns out that Morsayati sent Zethia to the past, where she ended up getting taken in by Meenee and Ilia, alongside Mordecai.

However, one day, after Alear loses a battle against their future self, Lumera finds them lying unconscious. She takes them in, and Alear comes to accept her as their mother. Lumera's guidance is what inspires Alear to rebel against Sombron, turning them into the legendary hero as told in ancient scripture.
-   **Genshin Impact**: Arlecchino has personally rescued children from Human Traffickers and exploitative foster parents, with at least two of them, Lyney and Lynette, going on to become part of the House of Hearth. While they did not become completely carefree as a result, Lynette's story confirms that their adoption has given them the safe environment that they wanted, and she is quite content where they currently are.
    
    (Arlecchino's) voice was cruel ice, and yet it had a spellbinding, comforting power also. Lynette lifted her eyes, and there she saw the person she would in later days call "Father." "Father" kneaded Lynette's ears. That touch was not gentle. Indeed, they were as cold as the moon's light. And like that light, it illuminated a corner of the darkness. "When a cat's ears are folded backward, that often indicates fear or vigilance, and if they stand up and point forward, that usually indicates a good mood." Whenever Lyney tells new members of Hotel Bouffes d'ete about the habits of ordinary cats, he will often steal a glance at his younger sister nearby. Lynette's ears are straight, they face the front, and they occasionally flutter outward. It has been a long time since she last folded them back.
    
-   **Persona 5**: Futaba and her mother, Wakaba, had a very loving relationship when Wakaba was still alive. When Wakaba allegedly stumbled into the path of a speeding car, the death was labeled a suicide when "investigators" read a note claiming it was from Wakaba blaming Futaba. This caused the rest of her relatives to hellishly turn on Futaba, abusing her without hesitation, until Sojiro stepped in and took her into his custody, but Futaba was still severely traumatized from the incident and would truly recover when she met the Phantom Thieves and fully learned she was not the one responsible for her mother's death.

Adopting the Abused Example in Western Animation

-   **Amphibia**: Downplayed; Anne Boonchuy's parents are very loving and she spends most of the series desperately trying to get back to them. However, her friendship with Sasha was toxic, as Anne was a pushover who did whatever Sasha wanted (sometimes even taking the blame for things that weren't her fault), and Sasha never stopped her. If anything, she encouraged her behavior, even convincing her to steal the Calamity box. It's only after Anne forms a genuine, healthy friendship with Sprig that she learns just how bad her friendship with Sasha was, and finally stands up to her in the season one finale (having to do it again in the season two finale).
-   **Avatar: The Last Airbender**: Zuko's biological father (the show's Big Bad, Fire Lord Ozai) is an awful parent, and his sister is a backstabbing sadist who'll sell him out the second it suits her. He eventually realizes that he has a much better father figure in his Uncle Iroh, and that his Family of Choice with Team Avatar is healthier than his biological one ever was.
-   **Captain Planet and the Planeteers**: Before he receives the Fire Ring, Wheeler has spent quite some time on the streets to avoid his abusive father. However, upon joining the team, he gains a Family of Choice — the other Planeteers (besides Linka) become his surrogate siblings, while Gaia and Captain Planet serve as Parental Substitutes for all of them. Even though there's ultimately a reconciliation episode between Wheeler and his father, the man never appears again, and one can easily assume that Wheeler will always be closer to his teammates, Gaia, Captain Planet, and his mom than to his dad.
-   **Infinity Train**: Book 3 completely subverts this trope, as Grace and Simon want to bring Hazel into the Apex and get her away from her "null" friend Tuba, believing that they can take better care of her than Tuba. However, Tuba has acted as Hazel's mother for as long as she can remember, and has done an amazing job of raising her and protecting her from the dangers of the Train. When Simon **kills** Tuba and he and Grace take charge of Hazel, she's visibly less cheerful than before, and it becomes clear that neither Grace nor Simon is as capable of looking out for her as they thought. Hazel ultimately decides to go with her (sort-of) biological mother Amelia rather than stay with Grace and Simon.
-   **The Owl House**:
    -   Eda Clawthorne arguably did this for Luz Noceda, as she was willing to take the human in as her apprentice. While Luz's home life was fine (as she and her mother were fairly close, even if they didn't see eye-to-eye), she was ostracized in school and considered weird by many of the other kids and parents. Staying on the Boiling Isles allowed her to finally be herself without the fear of criticism (plus the fact that Eda encourages Luz's weirdness).
    -   Camila Noceda ends up taking in Vee, a basilisk fugitive from the Boiling Isles fleeing the cruel experiments of the Emperor's Coven. After the Boiling Isles are taken over by the Collector, she also gives shelter to Luz's friends, including Amity and Hunter who both have abusive home lives.
    -   It's heavily implied by the time of the epilogue that Hunter is taken in by Darius.
-   **Tangled: The Series**: The start of season three reveals that Cassandra was the biological daughter of Mother Gothel... and that Gothel didn't treat her biological daughter any better than she treated her kidnapped daughter. When Gothel cruelly abandons Cassandra in favor of keeping Rapunzel for herself, four-year-old Cassandra is clearly shocked and heartbroken. Seeing this, the Captain of the Guard promised her he'd keep her safe, and took her in as his daughter.
