Coming-Out Story: 
_There's a new me coming out_

_And I just have to live_

_And I wanna give_

_I'm completely positive._

_I think this time around_

_I am gonna do it_

_Like you never knew it_

_Oh I'll make it through._

_The time has come for me_

_To break out of this shell_

_I have to shout_

The LGBT+ Coming-Out Story: the moment a Closet Gay or Bi or Trans etc. character comes out to everyone around them. This includes a character's journey to embracing their identity and who they really are. Happens at least once for almost every LGBT character ever, but most often seen with lesbian or gay characters, due to the No Bisexuals trope and trans characters still being rare as well (as are asexual, pansexual, etc. characters).

Although there are only so many variations you can do with it, you can be assured that any LGBT cast member of a show will relate to it at one point, or someone in their life will wholeheartedly support them, while at least another will turn out to be homophobic and will hate them. When parents are involved, they will either furiously throw their own child out of the home for this revelation, or reveal that they suspected all along, but were content to wait for their child to feel comfortable enough to admit it. Also usually includes a hate crime somewhere after the character comes out.

It also might be a payoff for a character who has long been giving hints, in which case few are surprised. Several teen and young-adult centric stories will incorporate this with a Coming of Age Story. If the characters are an ensemble of LGBT+ characters, usually this plot is assigned to The Twink or the Lipstick Lesbian. If not, then this will almost always be a Gay Aesop.

Related to Late Coming Out, which is for people who come out well into adulthood, and Coming Of Age Queer Romance, which is for people coming out when they're entering puberty. If a character comes out as a supernatural creature, see Have You Tried Not Being a Monster?. If a trans person has supernatural help coming out, see Supernaturally-Validated Trans Person. This trope has a strong overlap with Queer Establishing Moment in stories where it isn't the main focus of the work. For ways that characters can realize their identity, see Closet Key or LGBT Awakening. For cases where another character reveals the gay character's sexuality without their consent, see Forced Out of the Closet.

Coming-Out Story Example in Anime & Manga

-   **Asteroid in Love**: Part of Chapter 29, adopted as part of the ninth episode, deals with Moe's Love Confession towards Misa, and how she struggles with it. She does not openly declare her sexuality, but the fact she did that is implied to be known to some of the cast, if off-screen. By Chapter 32, some 6 weeks after in in-universe time, it appears that even Moe's Childhood Friend Mira is publicly saying Moe likes a girl within Moe's earshot, and yielded only **positive** responses.
-   Marika from **Bokura no Hentai** is a trans girl who has been dressing up as a girl in secret for some time. After persuasion from her friend Satoshi and his family, along with fears of puberty, she comes out to her mom and begins living as a girl.
-   **Is Love the Answer?** is about Chika, a girl realizing she's asexual, meeting others like her and coming to accept herself.
-   **Kanojo ni Naritai Kimi to Boku** is told from the POV of Akira's friend, however it is about Akira transitioning as a trans girl in her first year of high school.
-   **Love Me For Who I Am**:
    -   A good chunk of Kotone's character arc is her coming to terms with her gayngst and coming out of the closet. When taken to gay rights festival by her transgender friends while still closeted, she ends up breaking down crying after seeing all the happy lesbian couples.
    -   There are also a few other, less obvious, Coming Out Stories: Mogumo learning about their non-binary identity and how to be openly enby, Suzu being in a Secret Relationship with his boyfriend and learning to be more open, and Mei learning that it's okay to be seen a trans girl instead of a Wholesome Crossdresser.
-   Played with in **Love My Life**. At the start of the story, Ichiko comes out to her father by introducing him to her girlfriend... only for **him** to reveal that he's gay and Ichiko's mother was a lesbian, and that the two of them only got married because they wanted to have a family. Notably, none of the story's gay characters ever come out to society in general.
-   **Sweet Blue Flowers**:
    -   Fumi has her coming out toward her best friend Akira at their favorite hang-out spot, when she tells her that she's dating a senior from her all-girl high school. Akira is a bit surprised at first, but soon decides to support her friend fully. Luckily, there are no homophobes in this series, and the emphasis is more on the relationship between Akira and Fumi in light of this development.
    -   Played with as well; In what appears to be a more stereotypical form of the trope, Yasuko invites Fumi to meet her family, and states to them during dinner that they're dating. The response from Yasuko's sister, however, is for her to repeatedly ask whether Yasuko's really in love with Fumi, before delivering the Wham Line "So you're bisexual, Yasuko." Fumi had no idea that Yasuko wasn't a lesbian, and it leads to Yasuko breaking up with Fumi over her unrequited feelings for her old teacher, pointing out that Fumi has her own unrequited love to get over as well. Yasuko's family, it should be noted, were fine with it.
-   **Wandering Son**, made by the same mangaka who makes **Sweet Blue Flowers**, has a Transgender variant, mixed with a Coming of Age Story. Both Nitori and Takatsuki are not reluctant to tell people of their wishes to be seen as a girl and a boy, though Takatsuki is more worrisome. The beginning of the manga began with them two meeting in fifth grade, and soon after telling each other of their wishes. Both of them feel the need to start dressing as the opposite sex around that time, but their parents either don't notice or think it's a confusing phase. Takatsuki's anxiety foreshadows her gender confusion as a teenager. In contrast, Nitori's arc ends with the implications that she'll transition now that she's off to college.

Coming-Out Story Example in Comic Books

-   Batwoman (Katherine "Kate" Kane) came out as gay and was kicked out of West Point under the "Dont Ask Don't Tell" policy. Her commanding officer had given her the chance to deny the whole thing and have it swept under the rug, but Kate refused to lie and compromise her personal honor. When she comes out to her father, he is awesome:
    
    \[Kate enters her father's garage\]  
    **Dad:** Kate? This is a surprise. Shouldn't you be attending class? Are you on pass?  
    **Kate:** No, sir. I've been separated from the Army.  
    **Dad:** What? What happened?  
    **Kate:** Colonel Reyes informed me I was under investigation for violating Article 125. I couldn't say what he needed to hear.  
    **Dad:** Article 125... that is Homosexual Conduct.  
    **Kate:** Yes, sir.  
    **Dad:** Why couldn't you tell him what he needed to hear?  
    **Kate:** **\[raises her sunglasses, looks him straight in the eyes\]** I'd have been lying.  
    **\[Beat Panel of Dad carefully cleaning his hands, processing this\]**  
    **Dad:** Then you kept your honor and your integrity. I'm proud of you. Your mother would have been too.
    
-   **Blue Is the Warmest Color**: Much of the story is about Clémentine coming out to herself, and then also other people. Her friend Valentin is also gay and came out to her early on, which helps Clémentine do the same.
-   In the furry comic **Circles**, Marty is eventually forced to come out to his parents and godmother when they inadvertently force the issue during at visit to his boarding house. As it turns out, his parents had a wager where the mother thought he was gay while the father was holding out for him being bisexual so grandchildren could still be possible from him. As for the godmother, she is so obtuse that she doesn't understand the confession in the first place.
-   Pied Piper comes out<small>◊</small> to The Flash, Wally West. Wally claims<small>◊</small> he knew all along.
-   Alison Bechdel's autobiographical **Fun Home** details her coming out as a lesbian, and while her mom writes a letter expressing disappointment (Alison herself noting "As disapproval goes, I suppose it was rather mild"), and she finds supportive people (her roommate responds "Oh cool! Can I tell my friends?") the main crux of it is how it spurred Alison to learn of her own father's closeted homosexuality. Her father, tragically, never has his coming-out. She also published her coming out story in comic form in 1993 in Gay Comics (Early Summer 1993, #19). You can read it here.
-   **Gender Queer: A Memoir** revolves around Maia coming of age and coming out as both nonbinary and asexual.
-   Renee Montoya, in an award-winning arc of **Gotham Central**, was involuntarily outed by Two-Face, who had become obsessed with her since their encounter in **Batman: No Man's Land.** He mailed pictures of her with her girlfriend to her family and to the Major Crimes Unit, the branch of the Gotham City Police Department where she worked. Captain Maggie Sawyer, Renee's shift commander at the MCU, was already out and attempted to help guide Renee through the initial tribulations, but Renee felt that their circumstances were not comparable. Ultimately, her parents disowned her, but she was able to find a modicum of acceptance from the cops she worked with. It's later implied that her parents — or her father at least — upon cooling down a bit have deeply regretted this disownment, but Renee is by this point understandably unwilling to have anything to do with them even if they are willing to mend fences.
-   The first volume of **The Legend of Korra: Turf Wars** has Korra and Asami telling various supporting characters about the relationship they started at the end of the preceding TV series. Everyone they tell is accepting, but they are warned that some people won't be.
-   Just in case there was anyone who hadn't figured it out yet, Karolina Dean of the Runaways came out in the two-part "Star-Crossed" arc. Unfortunately, someone at Marvel apparently felt that having an open lesbian on the team might scare away readers, so she was suddenly engaged to a genderfluid alien royal and put on a spaceship for several issues. It was not one of Marvel's braver moments.
-   Averted by **Scott Pilgrim**, where most gay characters are already out by the time they are introduced. While bi-curiosity abounds (Ramona dated a girl for some time but eventually didn't really consider herself bisexual, Knives and Kim drunkenly made out but never mentioned it again), Stephen Stills is the only one who comes out, and it's done off-screen around Volume 5 without fanfare.
-   **Steady Beat** is a well-done Coming-Out Story; nobody comes out...yet, but the main character discovering that her sister is apparently a lesbian is the motivator for the plot. Her own reaction is more confused and upset than homophobic.
-   Spoofed in **Young Avengers**. The character Wiccan is reluctantly trying to tell his parents he became a superhero, but they misunderstand and assume he's coming out with his boyfriend. They're supportive of his sexuality, but no word yet on his choice of profession since he didn't get a chance to say anything about it. Also Marvel planned on slowly hinting, then having a big reveal that Hulkling and Wiccan are gay and a couple, but readers figured it out long beforehand. Marvel then had it casually mentioned in one issue instead of making it a shocking reveal.

Coming-Out Story Example in Comic Strips

-   Something of a watershed moment in **For Better or for Worse**. The storyline where Lawrence, one of Mike's friends, comes out as gay is pretty routine and by the numbers, but the fact remains that it occurred in a newspaper strip. It includes his foster father (briefly) throwing him out. The strip had been getting more serious in its arcing storylines for years, but this one drew furor like no other. While the character was still in high school, his being gay was often of note in every scene he was in from then on, such as the prom, but afterwards, he was just another family friend.
-   The Israeli comic **Zbeng!** has Ziv coming out in **Zbeng 1**. Jinji reacts very negatively and immediately runs to spread the news... only to find out, to his dismay, that the rest of the named characters don't share his opinion on the fact being a big deal.

Coming-Out Story Example in Fan Works

-   In the **Glee** fanfic **Hunting the Unicorn,** the Warblers are questioned by the FBI for leads on on Blaine's recent kidnapping. Nick reveals that he came out as bi to his mother, only to have her think that going to a same-sex school "confused him."

He also tripped so hard that he didn't remember to tell his best friend Jeff he was bi for a **year.**
-   In Chapter 2 of **Despair's Last Resort**, Monokuma threatens to reveal everything about the characters love lives and fetishes as a motive.

-   Clumsy has something like this in the **Empath: The Luckiest Smurf** story "My Unsmurfy Valentine." The object of his affections, Brainy, doesn't reciprocate, however.
-   **Angel of the Bat** blends this with, of all things, Curiosity Causes Conversion: Cassandra Cain gets into Catholicism as an outsider and gets most of her information from Stephanie Brown. Knowing Cassandra doesn't understand symbolism well and wanting to be supportive, Stephanie unintentionally Bowdlerises the Bible in a few places, and homosexuality never comes up. Catholicism ends up making Cassandra far more comfortable in her own skin, and ends up awakening her to her queer side. By story's end, she is a practicing Catholic in a secret lesbian relationship. The writer admitted this may very well have been an Esoteric Happy Ending.
-   Here's a **James Bond** fanfic on fanfiction.net called **Q Comes Out As Asexual**, where Q comes out as asexual.
-   **You Built This House** begins with Apple White meeting the Charming siblings as children and, unknown to her at the time, falling for Darling.

She ends up Forced Out of the Closet **before** she comes to terms with everything, though Apple eventually accepts her sexuality and her feelings towards Darling.
-   Because of the "Groundhog Day" Loop that she is trapped in **Hard Reset (Eakin)**, Twilight Sparkle does a few interesting things knowing that the timeline would be reset again, and one of them being heading home to her parents in order to reveal that she is gay.

-   Ironically, while **The Power of Seven** focuses on Harry Potter forming a harem of seven witches to save his life, one of the sub-plots of the fic is Ginny Weasley accepting that she's bisexual, as she comes to accept her genuine attraction to other women even as she remains in love with Harry, such as pleasuring Luna or realising that she had sexual fantasies about Fleur the preceding summer.
-   **So the Trauma** is an alternate universe oneshot based off of **Kim Possible: So The Drama** that mixes this into the story. Kim realizes she's lesbian after falling for the New Transfer Student Erica at first sight. The two begin dating, but Erica is actually a synthodrone created by Drakken and Shego to act as a way to get Kim's guard down. Her first girlfriend being a robot makes the betrayal hurt Kim even more than it did in canon.

However, Sunny realizes for herself on meeting Logan, who's Lupe's girlfriend (Sunny'd thought it was a guy's name). Lupe still hasn't told her dad by the end, but has been reassured he would never kick her out and he'd love her no matter what.

-   **Sappho**: Sappho tells Phil she likes women too and begins an affair with Helene. Near the end, she's also now embraced the term "lesbian" (though she seems to be bisexual-this wasn't used much when the film is set).

Eventually, Wil directly comes out to her mother. Her mom isn't happy at first but later accepts this.
-   **Show Me Love**: For both girls. Agnes is well aware she's a lesbian, though she stays in the closet at first due to homophobia. Elin falls for Agnes, which appears to be her first time finding a girl attractive. Both of them come out at the end triumphantly, declaring they're girlfriends.

By the end Elizabeth defiantly comes out to her mom, shocking her.
-   The Australian movie **Strange Bedfellows** used this trope in an interesting fashion - two (straight) men living in a small country town registered as a gay couple in order to claim tax benefits, but then had to convince a tax inspector that they really were a couple. Thus, they have to go through all the travails of a Coming Out Story in a (typically gossip-driven) small town, without actually being gay in the first place.
-   **They/Them (2020)**: Played with; Ash's classmates acknowledge that they identify as nonbinary, or at least trans, without Ash having to spell it out for them. However, Ash gets bullied to hell and back over it, and they're forcibly outed while reciting a poem about their identity. The culmination of the story is when Ash recites the poem in front of their whole class for real, letting them come out on their own terms this time, thus technically playing this trope straight.
-   **3 Generations**: Ray is already out but he's just starting to medically transition. The plot revolves around him trying to begin hormones and his family adjusting to the transition.
-   **Trapped: The Alex Cooper Story**: Alex comes out as gay to her parents quite early on. This results in them sending her to conversion therapy, which lasts until she escapes.

-   **Trevor** is about a 13-year-old boy who struggles with the realization that he is gay, especially after he's outed to the whole school. It ends with "I'm Coming Out" by Diana Ross on the soundtrack (Camp Gay Trevor is a Diana Ross fan).
-   **Two of Us**, a 1986 English TV film: gay boy is already out except to his parents, who find his soft-porn magazines and are thoroughly upset. His friend/boyfriend comes out as bisexual.
-   **V for Vendetta**: Valeria details her own in a flashback. When she told her parents she was a lesbian, her mom cried and her dad disowned her. The last we see is them tossing a baby picture of her in the trash.
-   **X-Men Film Series**:
    -   **X2: X-Men United**: Referenced when Mrs. Drake asks her son Bobby, "Have you tried... NOT being a mutant?" This has spawned its own trope.
    -   **X-Men: First Class**: Xavier accidentally outs McCoy as a mutant.
    -   Gloriously handled in **Deadpool 2**. When Negasonic introduces her girlfriend to Wade, though he makes a snarky comment which she initially thinks is bigoted, he quickly assured them he's simply happy for the two of them. Just like if any other of his circle of friends got engaged. Being a lesbian isn't ANYTHING to be unhappy with (but trying to be an angry and edgy teen, is an issue-that's what the remark was really about, as he clarifies). Of course, since Wade is canonically pansexual, it makes sense he wouldn't care.

Coming-Out Story Example in Literature

-   Occurs in **Absolutely Positively Not Gay** to the main character. He actually comes out multiple times in the book; once, he comes out to his best friend, is confused when she doesn't care, and then has a mini panic attack when she tells her parents. Her 6-year-old sibling comes into the room and asks, "Did he finally tell her he's gay?" He comes out to each parent separately.

    -   The story begins as Hani comes out as bisexual to her friends, who are less than enlightened about it, expressing skepticism of her bisexuality. She'd already come out to her parents, who are very accepting.
    -   Ishu much later also comes out to her parents as liking girls (without using any term for it).
-   In **Hero** by Perry Moore, Thom is forced to come out to clear the villain Sssnake for a murder. He was getting intimate with Sssnake at the time that the murder occured.
-   **Just Juliet**: Lena comes out to her friends as being bisexual early on after she realizes her sexuality. Coming out to her parents though takes longer. All of them accept her, though her parents more reluctantly.
-   **The Love and Lies of Rukhsana Ali**: Rukhsana comes out to several people as a lesbian in the story, mostly her loved ones, with varying reactions-her parents are hostile at first, with the rest accepting.
-   Over the course of **Loveless**, Georgia realizes she's aroace, comes out to her friends, and learns to be accepting of herself.
-   **The Mortal Instruments**:
    -   In **City of Glass**, Alec Lightwood comes out rather awesomely by kissing Magnus in the middle of the entire Clave, including his parents.
    -   Parodied, when Luke gets Simon a pamphlet called 'How To Come Out to Your Parents' when he becomes a vampire and tells him to adapt it to suit the situation. Neither Simon nor Clary is amused.
-   The whole point of **Parrotfish** by Ellen Wittlinger, only the main character Grady is coming out as transgender. Lacks most of the cliches associated with Coming Out Stories, in that Grady was almost in a Transparent Closet, so it didn't surprise his family at all, and most people at school ignored him anyway.
-   Redfern Jon Barrett's **Proud Pink Sky** is set in the world's first gay state, and follows William and Gareth's journey there after their relationship is discovered.
-   **Running With Lions** has main character Sebastian struggling with letting people know he's bisexual, but with getting close to his Love Interest Emir, developing as an athlete and team leader, he starts to be more comfortable with it and telling others.
-   Averted in **The Saga of Tuck**, where there is no **single** coming-out event for Tuck. The "coming out" events that do occur range from slapstick to nightmarish.
-   **Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda** is one for the title character Simon, as well as for his e-mail penpal Blue.
-   In Jodi Picoult's **Sing You Home**, the main character Zoe starts dating her friend Vanessa after divorcing her husband of 10 years. The main plot of the book is them trying to start a family with the embryos Zoe and her husband froze after IVF treatments. However, the book has all the cliches of this storyline, such as one character supporting her (her mom) and one character being homophobic out of nowhere (justified, because her husband had just converted to Christianity).
-   **Sorry, Bro**: After she gets forcibly outed and weakly tries to deny her bisexuality, Nareh later admits she's really bisexual. Her cousin, mother and grandmother take it better than she expected (the latter two especially), accepting her. Nareh tells the whole world too through her post on Instagram.
-   There are quite a few books of lesbian coming out stories, for example this one called **Testimonies: Lesbian Coming-Out Stories**
-   Given a twist in Holly Black's fantasy novel **Tithe**, in which one of the characters literally came out to his oddball family and sci-fi geek mother by saying: "Mom, you know the forbidden love Spock has for Kirk? Well, me too." Lampshaded after as Kaye says that is the strangest coming out story she's ever heard.
-   **Whateley Universe**: For a series focused heavily on gender transformations and LGBT+ issues, there are surprisingly few of these - it is more often a case of someone coming out as a **mutant**, instead, though the parallels are pretty blatant. Of those which have occurred, probably the most significant was Mega Girl coming out as a gender changeling to her boyfriend, Stronghold, at the insistence of the school's headmistress at that. It goes better than she ever hope it might, as he readily accepted her and would stand up for her against homophobic bullies not long afterwards.
-   Here's a book called **A Woman Like That: Lesbian And Bisexual Writers Tell Their Coming Out Stories**. Pretty self-explanatory.

Coming-Out Story Example in Music

-   The Erasure song "Hideaway" is clearly about a young man's coming out and the resulting family tension.
-   "Hooped Earings" by The Front Bottoms describes the narrator supporting a female friend as she tells her mom something upsetting and then cuts her hair short. According to this article, the song is "about a friend of mine that asked me to be there with her when she came out to her mother."
-   Jill Sobule's "I Kissed a Girl" is about a woman falling in love with her best friend. Complete with a cheeky music video where they dodge each other's husbands.
-   "Podruga" by the Russian band Kis-Kis is about a girl falling in love with her best friend and the feelings that come with it.

Coming-Out Story Example in Radio

-   In the **What Does The K Stand For?** episode "First Love", Stephen K. Amos describes how as a teenager he kissed a girl called Fanni, was confused that he didn't feel anything, and then met her brother. ("Was it possible I was no longer interested in Fanni?") He then becomes convinced that his parents will reject him and he'll be thrown out of the house ("That was how it worked, wasn't it? I'd seen **Play for Today**.") As it turned out, his mother just blanks it out, although he suspects she's always known.
    
    **Virginia Amos**: I am glad you are gay, Stephen. We are all gay. And there is nothing wrong with being happy!
    
    **Stephen**: And really, I can't put it better than that.

Coming-Out Story Example in Roleplay

-   In **Dawn of a New Age: Oldport Blues**, a significant part of Kev's backstory is when he came out to his parents. They were initially scandalised, thinking it ruined their image of an ideal Christian family, but they were eventually able to reconcile with him.

Coming-Out Story Example in Theatre

-   Played mostly straight, surprisingly, in **Avenue Q**, though without the homophobe/hate crime.
    -   Indeed, one of the characters, Rod, lives in the most transparent of transparent closets; his story is more about coming out to **himself.**
-   In **The Children's Hour,** a play by Lillian Hellman that was later made into a movie, Martha comes out as a lesbian to her roommate Karen, and then kills herself out of guilt, since their lives had been ruined due to a child claiming that they were both lesbians (and lovers).
-   In the musical production called **Fairy Tales**, there is one song about a man writing an emotional letter to his dad telling him that he is gay.
-   **Fun Home** is about Real Life comic book illustrator Allison Bechdel's sexual awakening as a lesbian, and her relationship with her gay dad, Bruce Bechdel. As the play is adapted from a comic memoir, Bruce tragically died from being hit by a truck after Allison came out to him (Allison believes that it was a suicide).
-   The song "See Me" in bare: a pop opera has Peter trying to come out to his mother, and the next song has his mother struggling with it but ultimately accepting him in the end.

---
Coming-Out Story Example in Video Games

-   One mission in **Fable II** has you helping a farmer (the one who earlier put you on the mission to arrest a bandit leader to avenge his wife's death) find a wife for his son. One problem: the son doesn't want to get married... to a woman. The mission ends with you helping the son find a potential boyfriend in the city and the son coming out to the farmer. The farmer is perfectly accepting and actually says he should've seen it earlier. Not bad for fantasy Renaissance/Colonial England.
    -   Depending on your chosen alignment, you can be a jerk and set the son up with a woman in spite of his confession.
-   **Gone Home** actually revolves around this concept. The entire horror game plot is just a Red Herring, the story is really about the Player Character's sister realizing that she is in love with her (female) best friend.
-   In **Growing Up**, Charles' route involves him coming to terms with his homosexuality and how it's affecting his political career in the student council. In high school, he comes out as gay to the Player Character when they catch him in crying in the bathroom after losing the elections. Then he comes over to their house to ask them for help in dealing with it because his sister caught him first and their father is homophobic. Thanks to the PC's support, Charles becomes brave enough to come out to his dad but still gets kicked out of the house, but he fights for LGBT+ rights in his good ending in the epilogue, looking to his sister for support (and also the PC if he marries him after years of on-again-off-again dating).
-   **Guilty Gear -STRIVE-** features Bridget's Arcade Mode story, which focuses on her coming out as transgender. She starts unsure about her male identity, and Goldlewis and Ky encourage her to live for herself and let go of her fears. The Hard Route ends with Bridget finally asserting herself as a woman, while the Extreme Route ends with Ky encouraging her to always be true to herself, no matter what anyone else thinks.
-   **The Orion Conspiracy** is one of the first, if not the first, games to break the gay taboo, and this game was released in 1995. Devlin is investigating the death of his son Danny. In the course of the investigation, he discovers that his son Danny was gay and was in a relationship (that involved love letters) with Kaufmann. Shortly after this, Kaufmann confronts Devlin. Kaufmann confirms that he and Danny are both gay. Both of them get into a shouting match about how Devlin drove away Danny and that Devlin is just some anti-gay bigot who is now thinking that Kaufmann murdered Danny over a lover's tiff. When left alone, Devlin is left feeling guilty over being a poor father for Danny, and that they had been so distant that he simply had no idea that Danny was gay. Devlin also feels that Danny could have told him about this, and that he would not have been angry with Danny for that.

Coming-Out Story Example in Visual Novels

-   **Coming Out on Top** revolves around Mark's attempt to find romance after coming out to his friends and family. This also applies to Brad and Ian in their respective routes so long as the player makes the right choices.
-   Getting Rald's good ending in **Full Service** has him fully come out as a gay man to his overbearing father and announce his intent to marry the male protagonist Tomoki. They then proceed to elope and have a private wedding afterwards.
-   Asuma Tougou from **Tokyo 24-Ku** is a closeted gay man struggling to meet the expectations of his influential family who want him to marry a woman in order to further boost their social standing. During a critical point in his route, the player can convince him to either go along with what his family wants or be true to himself. If the former option is chosen, Asuma will resign himself into an Arranged Marriage with an Unwanted Spouse, emotionally shutting down in the process while using the protagonist as an outlet for sexual relief. But if the latter option is picked, he will instead gain the courage to come out to his brothers with mixed results depending on the player's other decisions. The best result ends with him being open with his sexuality, gaining more freedom, and even becoming the protagonist's boyfriend.
    -   Asuma's side story follows up on his good ending route by having him work up the nerve to come out to his own father. To his pleasant surprise, his father accepts him and even approves of his romantic relationship with the protagonist.
-   **We Know the Devil**: Sort of. The main characters are fumbling towards coming out to themselves, and even each other.

Coming-Out Story Example in Webcomics

-   Rae from **Always Human** comes out to her friend Sunati as asexual and aromantic.
-   In **Ansem Retort**, Marluxia, who has been stereotypically gay for the entire series finally comes out of the closet in 'season' 5. None of the other cast members are surprised and even the jerkass Zexion finds this reveal to be less interesting than watching Seinfeld reruns.
-   **Assigned Male**:
-   In the webcomic **Boy Meets Boy**, Mikhael is faced with the challenge of finding a good time to come out to a new group of friends. Finally, in the middle of a poker game, he awkwardly blurts out, "Hey, speaking of a straight... I'm not." His friends support him after the initial shock wears off. The shock itself has more to do with the incredibly awkward way he goes about it than anything else, and the story arc is more about Mikhael trying to overcome his social ineptitude. He actually panics not over the prospect of coming out in and of itself, but over the fact that he's made friends and doesn't know how to behave around them.
    -   Near the beginning of the strip, Mikhael makes Harley come out to his mom over the phone. He grudgingly does so, only to have her reveal that she knew all along, much to his surprise, and had even found him a suitor.
-   Szark comes out as gay in **Dominic Deegan**...after already being openly bisexual. His sexuality is immediately relegated to humorous and is mentioned on every possible occasion.
-   **El Goonish Shive**
    -   There's a particularly powerful strip, wordlessly depicting how Justin was outed. Of special note in that Justin lacks the "whatever you do I'll support you" guy. He only meets Elliot (Chronic Hero Syndrome) and Nanase (At the time, Elliot's girlfriend) **after** the whole saga.
    -   Nanase gets her own, even though almost everyone knew anyway.
-   **Ennui GO!**: The second part of the comic has Andromeda, a minor character who was Vanitas' girlfriend throughout Part 1, coming out as a lesbian to him in "Closet", revealing that as the reason why she broke up with him before then.
-   Played with in **Girly**. One story appears to involve Otra telling her mother she is a lesbian, but it turns out she was just explaining she was a sidekick. Unfortunately, she was involved in a massive "Freaky Friday" Flip with most of the rest of the cast at that point.
-   **Gunnerkrigg Court**: Tomboy and Girly Girl Kat and Paz deal with their feelings for each other after the first girl is Mistaken for Gay (her known crushes have been for guys); after settling her feelings Kat then has to deal with coming out to her best friend Antimony. When the couple is spotted by said friend in a compromising position the friend runs away sending Kat into a panic. Turns out she wasn't afraid of Kat being gay (an offhand comment about dating a hot enough woman **a year ago** was enough for her to accept the possibility that Kat might not be hetero-normative), but that her best (and at times only) friend might leave her. Kat also comes out to an ancient spirit who warns her friend might not be as open-minded as he is; after coming out to Antimony, she worries their spirit pal might be too old-fashioned. The couple later go to a dance and no one seems to care.
-   All four storylines thus far of **Khaos Komix** have involved the focal character realizing his or her homosexuality or bisexuality, followed by romantic tension with one or more same-sex love interests.
-   Sara of **Penny and Aggie** undergoes a lengthy and heavily foreshadowed coming out process, sometimes played for comedy and at other times for drama. Lisa, noticing Sara's Transparent Closet (she's visibly frustrated by the rival title characters not acknowledging their supposed mutual attraction), touches her mock-seductively on the nose, freaking Sara out and leading her to settle the question by kissing Marshall. When she feels nothing as a result, she realizes she's gay. Subsequent storylines deal with her Ambiguously Gay makeover, being slanderously outed to the entire school body as an alleged rapist, eventually finding acceptance (and, in one case, a girlfriend) amongst her friends, and coming out to her mother.
    -   Penny, as well, has been (very) slowly coming to terms with her own bisexuality ever since a comment by a projecting Sara hit too close to home.
    -   As of late 2009, Aggie is in the midst of her own coming out process, although whether she's gay or bisexual is not yet clear.
-   In **PepsiaPhobia**, the "A Good Egg" (the title refers to "egg" being slang for someone who has yet to realise that they're transgender) story arc has teenage co-protagonist Pepsia (formerly Gastro) realise that she's trans, and ends with her coming out to her mother and her best friend Sophia. Both are fully supportive (and the lesbian Sophia is instantly smitten when she sees Pepsia in girl's clothes).
-   Subverted in PvP; Max Powers is a Straight Gay who spends most of the comic in the closet, but his friends had pretty much all guessed that he was gay anyway. When he calls a staff meeting to come out, the basic reaction is "That's it? You called a meeting for that?". No one treats him any differently and his sexuality is barely even mentioned afterwards.
-   In **Rain**, every one of the main characters, with the exception of Gavin, has a coming-out scene - and often more than one.
-   Lavali of **Sandra on the Rocks** comes out to her brother Alex after tearfully running into his arms for comfort because her girlfriend had just broken up with her. While her sexuality is news to the reader, the following two strips have Alex reveal that he already knew she was gay and so did their parents, since they had caught her in compromising positions with girls on multiple occasions. Up until that point she genuinely believed that the Blatant Lies she used to "explain" the situation each time had successfully kept them all in the dark.
-   **REVEAL OUT!**: The protagonist is a closeted lesbian whose life is a mess. When she is sent back to her college years, one of the first things she does is announce that she is "MASSIVELY SUPER DUPER MEGA ULTRA SUPREMELY GAY!"
-   **Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal** features one strip where a woman discusses with a friend how to come out of the closet to her husband...and admit she is a robot. Her friend's suggestion is a bit unorthodox.
-   Ethan of **Shortpacked!** didn't so much come out as found himself forcibly knocked out, when he found that being kissed by Mike aroused him more than being kissed by Robin. Up until right before the kisses (when Robin accused him of being gay), a few people had suspected he was gay but the possibility had never occurred to Ethan himself.
-   In **Simply Sarah**, the coming outs happen early into the comic. Sarah tells her mother first and her mum is supportive. Janey is reluctant to tell her more homophobic mother, but she ends up Forced Out of the Closet when she is caught kissing Sarah. She later comes out formally
-   One major story element in **Sunstone** is that neither Ally nor Lisa considered themselves to be gay or bi before meeting each other, and have to come to terms with their mutual attraction along with their roles in the D/s part of their relationship. Ally eventually admits it to Alan ("I'm... gay." "Like a rainbow unicorn.") and a future strip teases at how Lisa will eventually introduce her girlfriend to her family.
-   **Tripping Over You** is a slice-of-life story about two boys and their relationship in a British boarding school. Milo has been outed rather early by the last girl he dumped and is quite comfortable with being out meanwhile, and his family doesn't make much of a fuss about it; Liam on the other hand takes a long time to come out in small steps to his roommate, then to a few more of their school friends, and finally to his strict, conservative father Eli.
-   Spoofed to the point of an Overused Running Gag in **Umlaut House**:
    -   Jake frets neurotically over whether to tell his boss, who ends up jumping him on the spot, then his parents, who hardly care.
    -   Rick denied being gay as a teen because he didn't know what it meant; after having a bully explain it to him (at gunpoint!) he didn't even struggle with the idea. Then Rick came out and explained the concept to his father, who had the exact same reaction.
    -   Amanda says she thinks her story is "the same as \[Volair's\]" and rattles off a stereotypical version of the Coming-Out Story, to which Volair responds that he "just likes getting 5% more nookie."
    -   In a flashback, Volair is outed to his peers (and himself) by an erection in the shower.
-   Hom from **Welcome to Room #305** came out at the very start of the story but it gets tossed around a lot on whether or not it's the truth or he's playing a joke. Eventually, it comes out that he is quite gay but hasn't come out to Sung Joong.
-   Dawn, to Kelli, in **World of Fizz** reveals early on that she had a crush on Kelli since the first grade, and the two later enter into a relationship.

---
Coming-Out Story Example in Web Videos

-   **Alexander Avila**: Alex often says that he finds the trope of a character having trouble coming out to be overdone and often feels disingenuous. Multiple videos have him bring up how he dislikes it and prefers stories where the characters are just gay and have other problems that come with being openly gay or just life in general.
-   This is the plot of **Out With Dad**, with the twist that it's a coming out story for two people - Rose and Vanessa. Neither is out to everyone, but their families both know. Rose gets the supportive reaction from her friend Kenny and her dad, while Vanessa's mom is... less supportive. Near the end, Nathan tells Rose he's asexual as well, which is fine though she teases him by repeating one of his lines to her from her own coming out.
-   CollegeHumor did a skit called "When Coming Out Goes Better Than You Thought", in which Grant admits to being sexually attracted to men... and nobody bats an eye. He gets progressively more descriptive as he wants **somebody** to react poorly to justify his having been closeted for so long - and he gets his wish when he mentions that this attraction is due to him being **bisexual**, not gay, and a litany of "Pick a side!" comments are levelled at him.
-   Done wordlessly with the YouTube short video **In a Heartbeat**, which uses strong symbolism to show a boy's "first crush" on another boy in a sensitive way.

Coming-Out Story Example in Western Animation

-   **Arthur** had an episode where Mr. Ratburn is revealed to be gay and has a boyfriend who he ties the knot with.
-   **BoJack Horseman** has one in season 3 to Todd, who comes out as asexual in the season finale. When meeting a high school sweetheart, he realizes that he doesn't have any interest in being with her sexually, with all through the season the question on what exactly is he interested in being raised. He later actually uses the word asexual to describe himself.
    
    **Todd:** I don't think I'm gay. But I don't think I'm straight either.
    
-   **Craig of the Creek** has "Fire & Ice", which revolves around Kelsey realizing her feelings for Stacks, even getting advice from J.P.'s sister, Laura, and her girlfriend, Kat.
-   Waaaaaaaaaaaaay on the other end of the spectrum, you have **Drawn Together**, which featured Xandir's attempts to come out to his parents. He tried to practice by having two of his castmates roleplay as his parents. His first trial run at coming out was met with a reaction of "Uh, DUHHHH!" from his pseudo-parents, which causes Xandir to chastise them for not taking the roleplaying exercise seriously enough. They take things a bit more seriously than he may have hoped, as his **second** trial run led to an insanely convoluted turn of events parodying an after-school special, which killed half the cast (So what else is new?) and made little to no sense. Again, this isn't new. In the end, when he comes out to his real parents, what are their reactions? "Uh, DUHHHH!" Also: when he came out to his girlfriend over the phone, she angrily requested he never save her again, as she is bound and being lowered into a snake pit. Makes Princess Clara look downright tolerant.
-   **The Great North** plays with the trope in "Say It Again, Ham Adventure," as Ham's attempts at a "classic" coming-out story haven't run into the drama associated with such because he kept saying it casually and his family just kept accepting it. The Tobins play a visit to Beef's judgmental cousin Danica... who also turns out to be on the run for bank robbery, which results in the would-be coming out turning into a hostage situation. When's all said and done, Ham decides a casual, accepting non-event of a coming out was better.
-   **The Owl House**:
    -   Subverted by Amity. Her falling in love with Luz hits all the usual beats: confusion, new feelings, etc., but because she comes from a Non-Heteronormative Society, she struggles with falling in love for the first time, rather than falling in love with another girl.
    -   On the other hand, Luz appears to have been fully secure in her sexuality prior to the events of the series, but doesn't officially come out until the season 3 episode "Thanks to Them" where she shows her mother a photo montage of her and her girlfriend Amity being romantic and ending with a picture that reads "Hi! I'm Bi!". Camila, for her part, is immediately accepting of both girls and cheerfully pulls them into a hug.
-   Parodied in **Queer Duck**, in which the titular character randomly comes out to a bunch of strangers at work. Nobody was the least bit surprised, but he later relates all of the people at his job supporting him and acting emotionally to his friends.
-   Patty came out to her sister Marge on **The Simpsons** as a lesbian in the episode "There's Something About Marrying".
-   Parodied in the **South Park** episode "Fishsticks", where due to a series of misunderstandings Kanye West comes out as gay... for fish.
-   **Total Drama**: Raj's arc in the 2023 reboot has him develop a mutual attraction to the Camp Gay Bowie. However, while he seems a little nervous about the whole thing, his best friend Wayne is the one who worries more about Raj coming out, as he's aware of Raj's crush but worries Raj doesn't trust him enough to tell him. Raj eventually tells Wayne he's gay as they're falling off a cliff, and Wayne is completely supportive.
