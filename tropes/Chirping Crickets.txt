Chirping Crickets: 
Given that it's indoors, that is some VERY determined tumbleweed.

_"When I get my hands on that cricket, it's_ snack time!_"_

A character says or does something intended to elicit an enthusiastic response from a group watching him, such as the audience in a theatre or a band of comrades. But instead of the reaction he expects, he hears nothing but the sound of crickets chirping, suggesting that nobody is responding, and they may, in fact, be stunned into silence, completely baffled, or missing altogether. A Flat "What" may follow.

Occasionally visually accompanied by tumbleweed blowing past, in which case the crickets can sometimes be replaced by blowing wind, or a wolf howling in the distance, with perhaps a distant bonging church bell. Sometimes the sequence includes microphone feedback. Sometimes a single person will cough. Alternatively, someone might throw a tomato at him. Or an awkward Rimshot may play.

Basically, it's what happens when the script calls for silence but needs an audio cue to indicate the silence. Also, according to the Jabootu glossary, dubbed-in cricket sounds are a way to further convince audiences that a scene is taking place at night, regardless of how obviously Hollywood Darkness has made a day-for-night effect - even if, say, a shot of the sun might have slipped in.

In anime, this trope may be represented not by insects but by birds flying by (such as the Idiot Crows). Of course, birds can also have other symbolic meanings so don't be too quick to apply this to every appearance. More often than not, it's coupled with a Sweat Drop.

Compare Loudspeaker Truck, when a passing vehicle makes a very loud noise to indicate awkwardness.

        He chuckled and continued, "They all believed that I was the **Heir of Slytherin** when all I really am is the **Harry of Gryffindor**."

        He paused for a moment as if expecting applause, but was instead rewarded with the sound of crickets, which were not even in season.
        
-   **Naru-Hina Chronicles**: A tumbleweed rolls by in front of Naruto, Sakura, and Sasuke when Sai asks Anko's Angels if he could examine their breasts sizes. Bonus point for having Kosuke (Naruto's pet fox) chasing after the tumbleweed.

There's absolute silence in response, except for the sounds of crickets chirping... which turn out to be coming from one Tenn who has giant cricket legs sticking out of her back. Apparently they do that on their own when she's agitated.

    Crickets chirp. A distant wind blows with a mournful whoosh. A tumbleweed blows into view.

-   Both played straight and parodied in The Nostalgia Critic's review of **Good Burger**. Twice, an animated tumbleweed rolls across the screen during a particularly unfunny scene.

Much more relaxing!" Listen to it here.

-   **Brandy & Mr. Whiskers** parodies it in an episode: Sandy and Mr Frisky are greeted enthusiastically at the waterfall, while no one responds to the main duo except a cricket chirping, which Whiskers noted seems to like them. When they try their entrance again, they get complete silence; when Brandy asks how could it be worse than before, Whiskers says he stepped on the cricket.
-   **Bunsen Is a Beast** uses the joke in "Network Newbs", where Bob asks the audience if any of them want Amanda to get her own news segment and cricket chirps are heard. The chirping turns out to becoming from an actual cricket among the audience.
-   **Care Bears**:
    -   In "Shunshine" on **Care Bears: Welcome to Care-a-Lot**, when Funshine is introduced in the pie-eating contest, there is no applause because he's been acting as a jerk with a big ego ever since he won the Care Bear-athon. So a cricket chirping is heard instead, then he cheers for himself.
    -   **Care Bears & Cousins**:
        -   This is used in "Wishing Well" after Grumpy shouts that he wishes it wasn't night anymore. Only Lotsa Heart Elephant, as the person who wished for the day to never come, can actually reverse the wish.
        -   It comes up again in "Awesomest Day Ever" when Lotsa Heart asks Bright Heart if he realizes what's between Moody Mountains and Adventure Beach in regards to sending Brave Heart between those two locations. The answer — the Surprise Party they're trying to set up for him, but the crickets chirp when Bright Heart can't come up with this.
-   The **Danny Phantom** episode "King Tuck" has cricket chirps heard when Tucker Foley cracks a lame pun on the name of Pharaoh Duul Aman by comparing it to the phrase "Man, is this dull". Cricket chirps are heard again when Dash steals Tucker's joke, but he then raises a fist to get the other teens to laugh.
-   **Dinosaur Train**: In "Hootin' Hadrosaurs", Shiny asks "Ready to do as I say and have a good time?". The others give her deadpan expressions while crickets chirp.

Callum's quip, however, of "recognizing the unmistakable topography of Mount Monotonous" gets no response other than the cricket's chirping. A bit later, Bait eats the cricket.
-   **The Fairly OddParents!** movie **Fairy Idol** at one point has someone sing so badly the fairy audience **turns into** crickets to do this.
-   **Family Guy**:

    -   Parodied in the episode "Long John Peter", when the Griffins take Brian to the vet.
        
        **Peter:** God I hate comin' to the vet. They charge me $90 an day to keep Brian here. For $60, I could put him up at the Holiday Inn, eh, who's with me?  
        **\[cricket chirping\]**  
        **Mayor West:** My apologies, my pet cricket has restless leg syndrome.
        
    -   Parodied again in "Farmer Guy" when a dying cricket asks his friend to take care of his kids...and be there whenever there's a bad joke.
-   In the **Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends** episode "Cuckoo for Coco cards", Bloo tells a joke to try to make kids laugh. The camera cuts to a shot of the kids staring unimpressed as a cricket chirping sound is heard.

-   In **Futurama** episode "Where the Buggalo Roam" when Kiff complains that one Buggalo keeps following him, Zap Brannigan cracks, "Did I say girlfriend? I meant your wife!" Dead silence follows, with a single tumbleweed rolling by.

-   In an episode of **Hey Arnold!**, much of the cast is planning an angry revolt against the supposedly "cool kids" who didn't invite them to their party. They all cite different suggestions, until Curly adds one. At the end of the episode, Curly has, in fact, freed all the animals at the zoo.
    
    **Curly:** I say we paint our faces with tiger stripes, and free all the animals of the zoo!  
    **\[silence\]**  
    **Helga:** That sounds great, Curly. We'll meet you there at eight.  
    **Curly:** Hooray! Free the animals! **\[runs off laughing maniacally\]**  
    **Helga:** Poor, twisted little freak.
    
-   In the **House of Mouse** episode "Timon and Pumbaa", Pumbaa tries to do stand up comedy, but his jokes are met with cricket chirps. Cut to Cri-kee making the chirps, and Jiminy Cricket looking slightly confused, being a cricket who looks nothing like an actual cricket.
-   **Invader Zim** would often use a hawk screeching in the distance in place of crickets.

    -   In "Baby Cakes", Pinkie's attempt to cheer the twins up with stand-up comedy elicits this. There's also the sound of someone coughing.
    -   In "Equestria Games", following Spike's incredibly awkward attempt at singing the Cloudsdale anthem, the giant stadium is quiet, save for the cries of a lone baby, and Pinkie's shout of "Nailed it!"

-   **The Simpsons**:

    -   And again in "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular", when Troy McClure introduces the lost scenes to the "Who Shot Mr. Burns" two-parter, he starts out with a dramatic, "This past summer, all of America tried to find out who shot Mr. Burns..." then shifts to a flat, "Then they found out it was the baby." Silence, save for a deliberate cough.
    -   Speaking of which, the Maggie/Burns shooting is the basis of a self deprecatiing joke in "Day Of The Jackanapes", when Marge talks about shows getting stale and repetitive, and Smithers bursts in to announce, "Maggie shot Mr. Burns again!" Followed by, yes, the sound of crickets chirping.

-   **SpongeBob SquarePants**: When SpongeBob tries stand-up in "Squirrel Jokes", his first joke is met with cricket chirps. The second joke bombs so bad even the cricket won't dignify it with a response. Also going as far as to show an actual picture of the cricket in grass on land.

    -   When the contestants are locked out of the Gemmie Awards in "Celebrity Manhunt's TDA Reunion Show" by Chris because their fame has come and gone, they are at a loss for words.

    -   In "I Love You, Grease Pig!", Jasmine jokingly warns Samey not to let her hand swell up into a wicket-keeper's glove. Neither Samey nor Shawn know how to respond to this and let the crickets play their tune in the background. The joke has an extra layer to it because, as Jasmine points out, she made a joke about the sport cricket.
