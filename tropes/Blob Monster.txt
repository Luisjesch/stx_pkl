Blob Monster: 
Follow

_"Just when you thought that unsightly pasta stains had no champion, and you were comfortable in a world where mayonnaise didn't fight back, comes a creature made entirely of the stuff that bursts out of mashed caterpillars. These are the rock stars of downtrodden gravy stains and greasy splotches everywhere: a large, intelligent cube of glop that can chase you down and digest you before you've accepted you're being beaten up by an overachieving dessert."_

Blob monsters. Amorphous due to their unique (lack of) anatomy, these creatures range from mindless eating machines to tricky shape-shifters or something in between. How tough they are varies, whether they're Nigh-Invulnerable, or ludicrously fragile. Sometimes based on jellyfish, amoebas and similar invertebrates (or, in sillier cases, gelatinous desserts), this creature can be found throughout speculative fiction environments. Possibly acidic, how it is usually defeated varies between each work, whether by being frozen, or melted, or blown up, or squished, or by heroes taking advantage of its chemical composition, or other creative methods.

Their appearance will also vary depending on the work, as well as whether they are supposed to be cute or disgusting. Eastern media tends to depict them as cute gum-drop like blobs with bright colors and small Black Bead Eyes when cute, and dark or harsh colors and jagged mouths when evil. Western works also tend to give them water droplet-like bodies when cute, but instead give them large, bulging eyeballs that loosely float in their mass for the same effect; when evil, they tend to have runnier bodies and usually have other villainous features, such as teeth, or being hazardous to the touch. In both cases, strictly neutral or mindless examples are simply shapeless masses of goo, gelatin or ectoplasm, with no outward distiguishing features and strictly stimulus-response behavior.

If it has anything resembling a mouth, Phlegmings are assured.

Exactly what these creatures are supposed to be also varies, if they are given a specific nature or origin at all. They may be a kind of amorphous "animal", something like a squishier version of a common slug, or else amoeboid Mega-Microbes. Sometimes they are not a single creature at all, but something more like a slime mold or a moving colony of microorganisms, which can split apart, fuse with others of its kind, and grow and reabsorb simple organs and appeandages as needed. Another version depicts them less as creatures or colonies of creatures and more as a kind of magical or industrial waste product, which forms spontaneously from arcane residue collecting as Ectoplasm or chemical pollutants festering and reacting until they get up and ooze away.

A recent sub-variant has become popular on the various Internet art sites — that of the Slime Girl, a.k.a. the "Goo Girl" (DeviantArt or Danbooru) or "Slime Maiden" (Pixiv) — which is effectively the Blob Monster given the Cute Monster Girl treatment, with Suu and Melona being the poster girls of this variant.

In video games, these will sometimes be The Goomba, appearing as very weak, simple enemies throughout the story, although sometimes some palette-swapped varieties are harder. Whether they are resistant to drowning or weak to it will also vary, leaning towards the latter if it's the player-controlled character. Sometimes, they can split into smaller ones when killed.

Another feature they commonly have in video games is being highly resistant to one form of attack, yet vulnerable to another. Typically this takes the form of them being hard to hurt with conventional attacks (how do you stab something that has no heart?) but vulnerable to, say, fire or some other sort of special type of damage.

Some form of Elemental Shapeshifter can be (or turn into) this, if they're capable of becoming water, mud/sludge, clay, lava or liquid metal. Compare Super Smoke.

When alien enough, this creature can be classified as an Eldritch Abomination.

When the monster absorbs things and suspends them in its body, see Gelatinous Encasement.

Makes a good Monster of the Week. See also Mega-Microbes. The Cute Slime Mook is a specific cute, high surface tension variant found in Eastern RPGs. Compare Muck Monster who's generally murkier and oozes more and Grey Goo. Related to the Rubber Man and Talking Poo.

Blob Monster Example in Advertising

-   In The '90s, the ads for Capri Sun juice drink featured kids/teens who would move about as silvery goop sliding across the ground and reappear drinking Capri Sun.
-   An Italian advertisement about some snacks involves a **Blob** parody where a giant monster made of chocolate swallows grains of puffed rice, leaving the titular product behind.
-   A 2005 advert for Marmite has people fleeing in terror from a huge dark blob, only to happily jump into its amorphous body on realising it to be made of the popular sandwich spread.

Blob Monster Example in Anime & Manga

-   **AKIRA**: Tetsuo turns into a fleshy version of this when his psychic power rages out of control.

-   **Brigadoon: Marin and Melan**: One shows up as an early Monster of the Week. It starts out as a puddle of pink goop, but it grows bigger and stronger by consuming zoo animals **from the inside out**. The only way to kill it is to dehydrate it.
-   **Cowboy Bebop**: The little black beastie from the spare fridge in the back of the Bebop in the episode "Toys in the Attic".

-   **Delicious in Dungeon** has slimes. Senshi rescues Marcille from one that had engulfed her head, and then shows Team Touden how to prepare and eat them. It turns out they aren't homogenous blobs, but have a fairly complex, slug-like anatomy, if the slug was turned inside-out so that the stomach lining and digestive acid are on the outside. Apparently they are a delicacy when dried. Furthermore, an omake states that slime species capable of attacking humans are rare, and that most are tiny, aquatic parasites that live inside the digestive organs of fish.

-   **Digimon:** Quite a lot of Baby Digimon are slime creatures, or at least listed as the Slime type, like Pabumon, which is just a living pile of bubbles with a pacifier. There's also the Champion level Raremon, who became a blob monster via Body Horror. It's a blob because its body is rotting.
-   Osamu Tezuka's **DNA Sights 999.9** features a race of black liquid female creatures as well and even helps the protagonists escape in this one.
-   **Dragon Ball**:
    -   **Dragon Ball Z**: Majin Buu is a humanoid Blob who also has an absurdly powerful Healing Factor.
    -   **Dragon Ball GT**:
        -   Many of the Machine Mutants count as this. More particularly the antagonist Baby, who used his liquid ability to go from body to body until he found a body strong enough to have as a permanent host. Once he finds a host he's able to explore the host's full potential.
        -   Rage Shenron manipulates slime that can absorb electricity to attack and power him up, creating a near-invincible giant body of it around himself which almost kills Goku and Pan before being fried in a lucky rainstorm.
    -   **Dragon Ball Z: Bio-Broly**: Bio-Broly, after being mutated to a deformed blob monster and became bigger after merging with the culture fluid, but gains a weakness towards water.
    -   **Dragon Ball Super**: One of the filler arcs features a type of "superhuman water" which actually turns out to be a sentient superweapon that mimics the form of those it touches en masse, but because it also absorbed the negative psyche of its targets, it had to be sealed away to avoid a catastrophe. Some of it ends up absorbing all of Vegeta's powers, including his Super Saiyan Blue forms, and for the English dub, this fake Vegeta is even voiced by none other than Brian Drummond.
    -   The anime and manga have their own spin on the final villain of the Future Trunks arc, Fused Zamasu:
        -   In the anime, Zamasu receives a face full of a full-powered Kamehameha from Goku after an intense beam clash, reducing half of his body to a gooey purple substance that cannot properly regenerate. After snapping and striking himself with his own power, that half becomes a bloated gooey mess which still serves as an adequate bludgeoning weapon.
        -   In the manga, this becomes his "infinite" form when Trunks splits him in half when his fusion begins wearing off. But because of Zamasu's immortality, they can't defuse and the two halfs become an amorphous mass that can shapeshift between Merged Zamasu and Goku Black...and begins to start rapidly multiplying uncontrollably.

-   **EDENS ZERO** has Maria Slime who can melt into a tiny blob form. While she is seen in a humanoid liquid form, she primarily uses her malleability to stretch her limbs
-   **Fairy Tail** features Juvia Loxar as a water variant who starts out as an antagonist before joining the titular guild. Doing so protects her from most physical damage, but some magical attacks can still injure her.
-   **Fullmetal Alchemist**: The true forms of Pride and Father are blobs of some black, shadowy substance that can manifest eyes and mouths.
-   **Galaxy Express 999** has at least four instances of these; a space slime who broke away from her home planet, a family of shapeless creatures who ditch their father and create mischief on the titular train by impersonating Maetel and Tetsuro (after stealing their clothes) and a water ghost. The movie features a swarm that initially attacks the heroes but later comes to their aid.
-   **Gundam 00: A Wakening of the Trailblazer**: The ELS are a variation. They are made of metal, and are just as tough and hard as that implies, but can shapeshift as easily as a blob monster when they wish. They can even combine together or split apart. Unlike most creatures of this type, though, they are **not** Nigh-Invulnerable. If a part of an ELS dies, it generally stays dead, and they don't appear to be able to "regenerate" damage or instantly heal wounds (presumably, they'd need to gather an appropriate amount of raw material first.)
-   **Hellsing**: Regenerating, powering up, or changing into other forms, this is what Alucard usually regresses into, though he never actually constructs any form of weaponry from it, usually resorting to bestial forms and familiars to get the job done.
-   **Heterogenia Linguistico** explores how slimes' biology would influence their language. In Chapter 3, Hakaba and Susuki meet a slime and communicate with it through vibrations in the ground, and later through a device that's some sort of tube with a cup on each end, one of which is placed against the slime and the other against the ear of the listener. Slimes can split off parts of their bodies and reabsorb them, even if they're not originally from the same slime. The larger they are, the more intelligent they are.
-   In **Hoshin Engi**, the Four Demon Generals are actually the four human forms of a single monstrous four-headed beast called "Chuu". In its true form, it looks like a massive, shapeless blob with four elongated "necks" but no discernible details. When they're nearly defeated, they degenerate in a more classical-looking giant slime with bobbing spherical eyes and corrosive powers, but they're finished off by Taikobo's Razor Wind.
-   **JoJo's Bizarre Adventure**:
    -   **Stardust Crusaders**: Rubber Soul's Yellow Temperance is anthropomorphic blob immune to freezing and heat on top of blunt force. Jotaro deemed that its wielder was the weak point.
    -   **Diamond is Unbreakable**: Okuyasu's father was turned into a human-shaped Blob Monster after the death of DIO. He is incapable of proper speech, and above all cannot be killed in spite of how miserable he seems.
    -   **Golden Wind**: Carne's Notorious B.I.G is a flesh-consuming creature that attacks and consumes the fastest-moving thing in the vicinity.

-   **Konosuba**: In defiance of the JRPG setting tropes it's built on, slimes in Konosuba are very rare, epic-tier deadly monsters that are feared by all sane adventurers rather than lowly EXP fodder that can be found all over the place. A Poison Slime is one of the Demon King's Generals and nearly wipes out an entire city **singlehandedly**.

-   **Monster Musume**: The slime girl Suu is a blue and green blob who can assume humanoid form and to mimic anyone she knows, with an antenna that lets her share others' feelings.
-   **My Hero Academia**: The Sludge Villain from the first arc is composed of a greenish-gray sludgy substance. When first seen, he approximates a humanoid form complete with a pair of blue jeans, but he shifts into a more conventional amorphous blob in a failed attempt to escape pursuing heroes. He also claims to be able to take over people's bodies from the inside, but is stopped before he can finish the process both times he tries to do so.
-   **Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind**: The manga version features a giant, genetically engineered slime mold. The God Warrior also begins to resemble one in both versions as its overuse of its nuclear-powered weapons eventually causes its organic parts to melt.
-   **Naruto**:
    -   Suigetsu, like the rest of the Hozuki clan, is able to switch from human form to a living mass of water, and can do this to individual parts of his body. He apparently needs to drink a lot to sustain himself, and can become a more traditional giant blob monster if he has access to a significantly large body of water.
    -   Konan seems to have a similar ability, only instead of turning into water she turns into paper.
    -   The Three Tails filler arc features an androgynous antagonist dressed in a skin tight 'slime suit' covered with a slippery residue, although he exhibits the normal abilities associated with normal slime creatures such as puddling up and stretching. He later turns into quite the Body Horror by fusing with his dead comrades, although they later get crushed by the Three Tails.
-   The Slime Sisters that work under Wilhelm in **Negima! Magister Negi Magi**, who are extremely resilient to physical attacks, capable of shape-shifting, and possess some control over water.

-   **One Piece**:
    -   Arguably, any Logia user can potentially be this if it's a solid Logia. The more fitting examples include Honey Queen (unknown water-like liquid) from the second movie, General Gasparde (candy syrup) from the fourth movie, Admiral Akainu (lava) and Caribou (mud).
    -   In the Punk Hazard arc, a gigantic creature called "Smiley." It has a rather unique origin: it used to be a giant, lifeless mass of highly deadly liquid poison created by Mad Scientist Caesar Clown, but the good doctor managed to turn the toxic sludge into a living creature by somehow 'feeding' it a Devil Fruit. Said Devil Fruit allows one to turn into an axolotl hybrid, but in the toxic blob's case, it turned it into a sentient kaiju blob monster axolotl of deadly poison, who would be affectionately named 'Smiley' by Clown.
    -   Trebol from the Dressrosa arc possesses the Beta Beta no Mi (Stick-Stick Fruit), which gives him the ability to tap massive amounts of mucus from his body. Certain events and dialog caused a Broken Base as to whether the fruit is Logia or Paramecia until the truth was revealed: it's a Paramecia. Trebol actually covers his thin body in a thick coat of mucus, thus fooling opponents into thinking he's a Logia user when they're not actually hitting his body within the goo blob in the first place.

-   The **Pretty Cure** series features a surprising amount of these in both shapeless and shapely form, no less.
    -   **HeartCatch** for instance, features a large gel-like female creature made of water, although she mainly weeps. In the **Fresh** season, however, one of the villains creates a shadowy facsimile of Setsuna who morphs her body into tentacles as well as melts into the shadows of her opponents to ambush them.
    -   **Fresh Pretty Cure!** features one of these as a Monster of the Week in the fourth episode, formed out of a child's **mizuame** (Japanese water candy). It features the ability to split itself into smaller copies and the traditional weakness to ice and cold.
-   **The Ride-On King**: Saki explains that aside generic slimes, there are slimes that feed on specific metals and have valuable cores.
-   **Queen's Blade** has the immensely popular Melona. She has all of the hallmarks and perks of an amorphous creature with every part of her body being her weapon, including and especially her breasts. Her base form being a pink gooey mass that she can mold into anybody she chooses, regardless of gender or body mass; she can even copy weapons and fighting styles, the only telltale sign between her and the real thing being the shape of her pupils. While not shown in the anime, she's very capable of absorption and can use the mass to either restore herself or make herself even stronger. Under the right circumstances, she is very much immortal.
    -   Despite her appearance, she's very more than capable of taking on even the strongest of the fighters and has shown to be implacable incarnate and a Magnificent Bastard. Not only does she have good manipulative skills, she's not afraid to fight against anyone as she goes up against Leina several times, almost winning each time and surviving techniques and ploys that would have killed anyone else, fights the champion Aldra twice in a row and surviving both times, and holds her own against Menace, a necromancer. In Rebellion, she fights under the influence of a set of armor pieces that, although it's supposed to make her stronger, also disorients her focus and form with the constant perverted vibrations, subdues most of the main cast with a simple water spell, and survives a direct hit from Claudette. Damn.
    -   Even more so, while not seen in the anime, Melona in **Rebellion** is turned up a few notches after absorbing an ancient demon, sporting a spiffy new outfit to go with it.
-   **Sailor Moon**:
    -   In the Monster of the Week category is Jamanen, known as Jellax in the DiC dub. She has quite a fanbase as it is and even makes it as a recurring enemy in one of the SNES games.
    -   Interestingly, slimes are a slightly recurring type of monster; the later episodes feature a bunny slime-girl named Peropero who manipulated malevolent hard candy. In one of the closing episodes, an army of female humanoid slimes are born from the many unused demon seeds.
-   Eilis of **Shinzo** is a liquid metal variation of this. He specifically traps the heroes by disguising himself as an **entire amusement park** in the second season.
-   **Space Battleship Yamato** has the Protozoans of Pluto. They're harmless animals, purple blobs with two little eyespots, about the size of a tire and actually kind of cute. Wildstar accidentally touches one and says it feels like sticky grape gelatin. The reason Captain Avatar refuses to use the Wave-Motion Gun against the Gamilon base on Pluto is that it would exterminate these harmless native creatures, and he figures the Star Force has no more right to do that than the Gamilons do to try to wipe out life on Earth.
-   **Yu-Gi-Oh!**: The Revival Jam monster. When hit by an attack, it splatters into little globs of goo and promptly reconstitutes itself. Marik uses this card as part of a combo centered around Slifer the Sky Dragon.

Blob Monster Example in Asian Animation

-   The title character of **Lamput** is an amorphous orange blob that Escaped from the Lab and is constantly on the run from Fat Doc and Slim Doc, a pair of scientists who work at that laboratory. "Monster" might be a bit much in this case, as Lamput is actually very friendly to most people — including the docs on occasion.
-   **Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf**: Cute little blob critters referred to as elves appear in **The Season Towns**. They're able to evolve into grass and bud monsters with legs.

Blob Monster Example in Comic Books

-   In the **2000 AD** Sword and Sorcery series **Feral & Foe**, the storyline "Bad Godenberg" is a pastiche of Dungeon Crawling. One of the suspiciously D&D-like monsters they face is a jellied icosohedron, which is like a gelatinous cube except that it's shaped like a d20.
-   Ant-Man's very first enemy was the Creature from Kosmos (Kosmos is a planet), which had a face and sort of had limbs, but was basically a Kaiju-sized blob monster.
-   Gloo from **Astro City** is a mindless monster that resembles a giant misshapen blob of green liquid. It fights crime with deadly "pranks", such as spraying litterbugs with flesh-melting acidic "seltzer".
-   Some versions of the **Batman** villain Clayface portray him like this.
-   **The Blood Syndicate** features Spanish superheroine Aqua-Maria, a meta human made out of living water with a bit of a language barrier to deal with.
-   The **Doctor Who Expanded Universe** has at least two notable examples. The first, in the "Doctor Who" comic story "The Iron Legion," has an **Ectoslime**, an acidic and **ugly** blob monster. When faced against one, the Doctor remembers that its species has an excellent sense of humor and sends it off by **telling a joke**. The Eighth Doctor later encountered one in the person of Donald Eustace Stark, who experimented on himself with morphant DNA.
-   An unusually humanoid (and amicable) version of the Blob appears among the guests of the 2003 Donald Duck story **Hotel Transylvania** (unrelated to the animated film franchise).
-   These showed up in EC Comics' horror titles a few times. Examples include "Strictly From Hunger", where out-of-control cancer cells mutate into a ravenous blob monster, and "Ooze in the Cellar?" where the trash in a miser's cellar combines with his wife's remains, creating a living ooze that swallows everything in the house. "Terror in the Swamp" and "The Meddlers!" both have this as the result of a discarded scientific experiment in Creating Life. Also the Gookum from EC's **MAD** #2, which causes the Martian storyteller to flee to Earth. He is horrified to see someone eating Jello, which they call "dormant Gookum"!
-   Empowered's teammate Protean. Not a villain, but certainly a fratboyish Jerkass. He owes his power to an alien sexually transmitted disease.
-   Minor **Fantastic Four** villain Dreadface is a blob monster that envelops people and takes them over.
-   **Gen¹³**:
    -   Caitlin Fairchild became this following her death and rebirth, displaying a nifty teleportation ability with it as well, though it doesn't seem that she retained these powers following the DC 2011 reboot when the series was merged with DC.
    -   At some point, Gwendolyn is transformed into the chrome variety.
-   **Green Lantern**: The Sinestro Corpsman Slushh is a blob monster that is made up of a powerful acid contained by a transparent membrane. One of his methods of attack is to grab an enemy and pull them inside of him where they dissolve quickly. He's done this lots of times before judging by the number of bones floating about inside him.
-   The short-lived antagonist Senator Morton Clegstead from the early days of **The Incredible Hulk** is transformed into a mass of semi-liquid tumorous flesh called "The Crawling Thing" in **Incredible Hulk #151: "When Monsters Meet!"** He eats the doctor who gave him a shot of the Hulk's blood as a cancer cure, then nearly eats the Hulk before being vaporized by a convenient lightning strike.
-   The Saturninans, from **Mystery Comics**, are amoeba-like aliens and possess several useful abilities such as shape-shifting and telepathy. They fought the hero Lance Lewis.
-   **New X-Men: Academy X** has Mercury, who is described as a "female T-1000".
-   In **Pouvoirpoint**, during its expansion to the stars, the human race is facing the deceitful Proximians (from... Proxima) which are gelatinous one-eyed blobs with sharp teeth.
-   The Chaos Devil from **Sonic the Hedgehog/Mega Man: Worlds Collide**, a horror comprised of Chaos and the Yellow Devil. It's a very dangerous foe, nearly overpowering Bass and Metal Sonic in its debut. Even attacking its eye (Yellow Devil's weakness) had little effect against it due to the Chaos fluid, and it nearly took down Sonic and Mega Man before Duo stepped in.
-   **Spider-Man**:
    -   Mentioned twice more on this page, the villain Sandman. Another, less featured villain is Hydro-Man, who — you guessed it — is living water. Both of them can make themselves look perfectly human. On one occasion, the two accidentally combined into a mud monster, much to the later embarrassment of the former. Hydro-Man, probably due to a lack of imagination, is on the B-List **of** the B-List, but Sandman is still active and considered a formidable threat today.
    -   The villain Skinhead; a neo-nazi who can turn into a giant, flesh-eating blob (and he really does eat flesh; the first thing he does after his transformation is devour his fellow gang members). Fortunately, his skeleton remains intact and vulnerable.
    -   The Venom/Carnage symbiotes in their natural state...
-   The Military Cook from **Sturmtruppen** **made** one by accident when his "mess" was struck by a lightning bolt. It devoured several soldiers before being defeated. The Attack of the Killer Whatever nature of it was lampshaded when it was created:
    
    **Private Franz:** Ze cook said that ze lunch is ready, und he requests a flamethrower.  
    **Officer:** What for?  
    **Private Franz:** Well... he said that ze lunch has taken fictious life und is slithering towards our lines.  
    **Officer:** If you want to work in a horror comic try to find a better excuse!
    
-   The **Teen Titans** villain Plasmus (one of the Brotherhood of Evil) is a humanoid blob of acidic protoplasm.
-   **Ultimate Fantastic Four**: Reed Richards, after becoming the Maker. While **technically** a Rubber Man, he really doesn't bother maintaining a form even close to human, instead turning into a multi-tentacled, multi-headed blob monster.
-   **Wonder Woman (1942)**: Wonder Girl's aptly named enemy The Glop is an alien who is essentially a living bit of very mobile orange slime.
-   The **X-Men** villain the Blob is a morbidly obese mutant who can't be hurt by anything (and in some continuities, could "suck up" attacks into his folds of flesh). Other, more appropriate examples include a student who was essentially a walking pile of biogenic paraffin wax with a brain, and a sentient puddle in a body suit.

Blob Monster Example in Comic Strips

-   **Calvin and Hobbes**:
    -   In one Sunday strip, Spaceman Spiff is devoured by a hideous gelatinous mass that crawls out of a crevice on a bleak alien planet and is immune to his blaster fire. The last panel shows Calvin making horrible faces over the cafeteria's tapioca pudding.
        
        **Susie:** If you don't like the cafeteria's tapioca, just leave it alone!
        
    -   One strip has Calvin disguising himself as a giant amoeba by hiding under a bedsheet, reaching out for food by "extending a cytoplasmic pseudopod." It doesn't fool his mom for a moment, especially since the food happens to be a package of oatmeal cookies and loud crunching noises accompany its eating.
    -   The green blob of Mystery Meat on Calvin's dinner plate comes alive and tries to kill Calvin in more than one Sunday Strip. In one strip, it attempts to escape and makes a mess of the house; in another, it starts acting as Hamlet.

Blob Monster Example in Fan Works

-   **Aliens and Army Doctors**: Sherlock and Mycroft are members of an alien species like this. They come in peace.
-   **Becoming a True Invader**: The Fefians are humanoid blobs with blue goo for blood and a strong Healing Factor.
-   **Black Star**: By the time the Thieves confront Shimizu's Shadow, his distortion has run rampant to the point that his Shadow is just a formless mass of ranting darkness with way too many eyeballs. It's also merged completely with his Palace, resulting in a giant, lifeless structure that his Shadow can control and rearrange at will.
-   **Dandelions in the Wind**: In Chapter 6, Katsuki gets the displeasure of being ambushed by a Slime Mugger whose arms and body can turn into goo.
-   **Daring Do and the Journey to the Center of the Earth**: Frog-like creatures made of slime Zerg Rush Daring Do and Maud while they're in a Death Course.
-   **Divided Rainbow** has the glufferflork, a blob monster which, curiously, prefers animals such as farm livestock and woodland critters to sapient beings such as ponies and humans. It still represents a monumental threat, nearly killing Big Macintosh, tearing away at Rainbow Dash's sanity, and later threatening the whole of Ponyville.
-   **Fate Revelation Online**: Slimes are amorphous blobs, which renders them highly resistant to purely physical attacks.
-   **Imperfect Metamorphosis**: A good chunk of the story revolves around the local Blob Monster, also known as Rin Satsuki.
-   **The Keys Stand Alone: The Soft World** has several minor examples:
    -   One of the evil Characters from the Book of Characters in the library is an eye-filled pile of ooze that lashes pseudopods at everything.
    -   The four encounter a gelatinous cube in Gothmarik Citadel. John makes short work of it because it's 99% water. And it's loaded with coins!
-   **The Nightmare House**: Lily's nightmare involves a gelatinous beast made of mud and purple goo named "Mor-Gaj", who eats money, based on her limited understanding of what a mortgage is.
-   **Olive's Last Partner** has regular blobs that are a nuisance to agents just as they are in canon. However, the story introduces Blobisites, cousins of blobs who specifically attack boiler systems and clog them up while also sucking the warmth out of the pipes in the system. Per their name, they're also parasitic, and they absolutely don't hesitate to attack agents if they deem them a threat.
-   **The Palaververse**: The post on immortals describes the Smooze as belonging to an entire species of oozes that live in the depths of the Black Ocean, where they feed on the magically-infused debris of the sunken ruins of Antlertis.
-   **Puella Magi Yuuko Magica**: Gregor, the first demon featured in the story, is a large sludge of ink with arms and two glowing white eyes.
-   **The Secret Return of Alex Mack** includes a crossover with **The Blob (1958)**/**The Blob (1988)**, with the organic-matter-devouring blob in this case being created by the Collective, as a weapon to cull the human race. It's mildly repelled by bleach, and can be immobilised by freezing it, but is Nigh-Invulnerable to physical force, and fire or lightning only cause Scratch Damage because it can consume the burned tissue to recover most of its losses.
-   **Star Wars Paranormalities Trilogy**: The Forceless Black Matter is described as sentient black goo.
-   **Vow of Nudity**: The featured monster species in the appropriately named story **The Isle of Slimes**.
-   **A Witch In Broad Daylight**: The self-replicating molecule is a mobile, translucent red blob that dissolves any organic material it touches to make more of itself. If damaged without being completely destroyed it quickly evolves a resistance to the attack.
-   **Voyages of the Wild Sea Horse**: The Nosferatu is a bacterial mat that acquired the power of a Zoan type Devil Fruit, the Human-Human, Model Type: Child by devouring its original bearer alive. In its natural form, it appears as a mass of flailing blood and slime roughly the mass of a six-year-old child. Ironically, this makes it much easier for Nabiki Tendo to swallow it whole and digest it.

Blob Monster Example in Films — Animation

-   **The Book of Life**: Xibalba is made out of slime and everything grimy.
-   **FernGully: The Last Rainforest**: Hexxus emerges from his tree prison as a tiny bit of living sludge. Absorbing the tree leveler's exhaust and engine oil lets him transform into more threatening forms.

-   **Monsters, Inc.**: A monster made entirely from goo makes a cameo appearance. He is shown walking (or oozing) down the pavement but accidentally slips down a rainwater gutter leaving only his eyes and mouth left.
-   **Monsters vs. Aliens**: B.O.B. is indestructible and can eat anything, but is really a decent guy, if not very bright.
-   **My Little Pony: The Movie (1986)**: The Smooze is a tide of living purple slime, constantly forming and reabsorbing eyes and mouths, that threatens to engulf all of Dream Valley. It quickly hardens into a concrete-like substance after the initial wave moves on, **unfixable** damage in its wake, and anyone it splatters onto turns into an unhelpful jerk.
-   **The Phantom Tollbooth**: The Lethargians are little creatures made of a mucus-like substance who lure victims over to them by convincing them to be lazy like them so they can eat them. After Tock saves Milo from them, they form together in a lake in an attempt to drown them.
-   **Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure**: The Greedy is a giant lake of liquid taffy who loves to eat sweets, including himself.

-   **Strange World** features Splat, a small, blue creature with tentacle-like appendages around his body. He’s actually a larva of a much larger creature: grayish purple monsters who have tentacles in their mouths, which they use to run as well as constrict and consume their prey.
-   **Treasure Planet**: Morph, Silver's Pirate Parrot equivalent, is a pink, floating, shapeshifting, ridiculously cute blob.
-   Anubis from **Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light** first manifests as a black slime both times when he's resurrected, though the second time is into a constantly evolving beast, and liquefies when exposed to the Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon's special ability. He also summons his Sphinx monsters through this as well.

Blob Monster Example in Films — Live-Action

-   **The Angry Red Planet** features a blob monster with a single eye which spins like a radar dish on top of its Man-of-War like body. Naturally green in color, it is electrocuted in the end. However, a small piece of it latches on to one of the astronauts and it continues to live (and try and eat the poor infectee).

-   **The Blob (1958)** is the Trope Codifier, along with the Bloodier and Gorier remake **The Blob (1988)**. In the original, it's basically a giant space amoeba that falls down on Earth. In the remake, it's man-made.
-   **The Cabin in the Woods** features a brief cameo of the iconic Blob as one of the monsters contained by the Organization.

-   **The Creeping Terror** features a blob monster that looks ludicrously like a giant tea cozy.
-   The **Creepshow 2** segment "The Raft" is about a group of college students trapped on a raft while an oil-like blob monster that can only drift on the surface of the water tries to engulf and digest them. They find out far too late that it can leave the water's surface just fine.
-   **Death Bed: The Bed That Eats**: The title monster is more or less this, as it consumes its victims with yellow ecotoplasm and dissolves them in stomach acid. It's a weird movie.
-   **Evolution (2001)**: The final stage of the aliens' evolution is a gargantuan critter that looks a bit like a starfish but is described by the science-geek characters as a "giant amoeba".
-   **Fantastic Voyage** had antibodies and white blood cells attacking a team of miniaturized doctors (though in all fairness they were just doing their job).
-   **Ghostbusters**: Slimer is a ghost made of slime as the name implies. In **Ghostbusters II**, the Mood Slime, being fed by human emotions, has some sentience, and is able to sprout amorphous limbs. The animated series had **many** other examples.
-   **It Came from Outer Space**: The aliens are aware that they're repellent to humans in their natural state as huge, one-eyed blob creatures covered in wispy fronds, so they try to repair their spaceship covertly. Unfortunately their actions in doing so (taking hostages and copying their bodies, stealing equipment) are regarded as hostile.
-   **Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie**: Ivan Ooze sometimes transforms into a sentient puddle of pink protoplasm with his face on it, and some of his warriors are created from his phlegm.
-   **Oily Maniac** has its titular monster being based on the **orang minyak**, a Malaysian-originated supernatural entity born of oil. In the film, the monster has been re-imagined as a living blob of crude oil who can alternate between humanoid and puddle form, and it's as disgusting as it sounds.
-   **Parasite Eve** features this in Slime Girl form in a particularly surreal scene of the Mitochondria Eve taking form while she dances and promptly has sex with the bystander witnessing it.
-   **Prince of Darkness**: The evil sentient liquid, implied to be Satan himself or a reasonable facsimile thereof. Definitely more liquid than most, to the point it cannot properly **be** a blob; it keeps to its canister while in containment, and once escaped pools on the ceiling like a living, malevolent green ocean that can flow into people to take over them.
-   **Spider-Man 3**:
    -   The fleeing convict Flint Marko is transformed into living sand. He was able to pull himself together to become Sandman, but the process is simultaneously awesome and traumatic-looking.
    -   The symbiote that also forms Spider-Man's black costume and later bonds to Eddie Brock to form Venom in also an ooze creature.

-   **Terminator**: Around 2029, Skynet invented liquid metal and started using it for the latest models. The villainous Terminators in both the second and third movies exhibit this.
    -   **Terminator 2: Judgment Day**: The shapeshifting liquid metal robot T-1000 can mimic everything it touches, from a floor to a human being (complete with clothes), and in human shape, it is malleable enough to simply walk "through" the bars of a prison door by flowing around them. It can also utilise its abilities in interesting ways in combat, for example turning itself back to front when pinned to a wall, or melting its head around a thrown punch to grip the attacker's arm. He is defeated by John, Sarah, and T-800 by weakening him with liquid nitrogen and later throwing him into a pool of molten iron.
    -   **Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines**: The T-X has a Super Tough robotic skeleton with a Blobby cover; although she can't alter her shape as freely as the completely liquid metal T-1000, she can also mimic any human she touches.
-   **The Thing (1982)** is perhaps the darkest version of this. It really is an amorphous being, being simply a multi-cellular organism. Unfortunately, not only does it absorb its prey, it is also extremely plastic, hence it can both copy its victims and assume grotesque, hideous and gory forms.
-   **The Unknown Terror** features a flesh-devouring fungus that acts like this. Why? Because it's portrayed by **soap suds**.
-   **X the Unknown** is radiation-devouring, equally radioactive, living **mud**.

Blob Monster Example in Literature

-   **Alien in a Small Town**: The Jan are rocky and solid silicon-based life forms. "Paul", a Jan, describes squishy humans as "blob monsters" and claims to have initially found us disgusting to look at.
-   **Barbapapa**: The Barbapapas are a family of friendly shapeshifting blobs.
-   **Below**: Pint-sized jellies (also called puddings) are a major hazard to the quest. They can consume any living or dead biomatter by rapidly dissolving it, combine to move at greater speeds, and are hard to kill without fire or light. A drought three years earlier forced one up from the deeper levels; now they're slowly dwindling in population, having obliterated the local wildlife.

-   **Bounders**: Slimers, as they're called by Earthlings, are among the few animals that can survive on the surface of the tundra planet Gulaga. Normally they spread thin to absorb as much of the meager sunlight as possible, but if someone steps on them, they immediately morph into a blob shape, trapping the unfortunate victim so they can slowly digest them. Mira and Jasper are attacked by slimers in **The Tundra Trials**, but Jasper uses his bounding gloves to repel them while he and Mira make their escape.
-   **Campfire Cooking in Another World with My Absurd Skill**: Sui is a young slime who tags along with Mukouda and Feru after Mukouda feeds him. He's an Extreme Omnivore, able to eat anything and everything Mukouda gives him (though he can filter it so he can clean what he absorbs), and can also shoot acid. His intelligence and special abilities lead Feru to wonder if Sui might not just be simply unique, but a special kind of unique.
-   Ian McDonald's short stories in the "Chaga Saga" feature alien (and heavily metaphorical) blobs, chagas, which are absorbing Africa at fifty meters per day, and no-one really wants to deal with it.
-   **Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator**: The Vermicious Knids have malleable forms and voracious appetites. Their one saving grace is that they like to spell out "S-C-R-A-M" with their bodies before attacking, just to show off the fact that they can do it, which gives their would-be victims a chance to flee.
-   **Chrysalis (RinoZ)**: The Colony's core shaper caste experiments with centipede cores, and is able to produce a "centi-sludge" variant that is basically a mobile puddle of shadow flesh. They're quite fragile, but any pieces broken off will be quickly picked up by other centi-sludges and incorporated into their own bodies, minimising their losses and making them quite dangerous in large numbers. (Also, they can exude tendrils full of toxins.)

-   **Cthulhu Mythos**:
    -   The Shoggoths, introduced in **At the Mountains of Madness**, were created and hypnotically controlled by Ancient Astronauts who forced them to shapeshift in ways that made them functionally equivalent to heavy construction machinery. No, really. This being from a Lovecraft Cosmic Horror Story, guess what happened afterwards.
    -   The creatures in **He** and **The Unnameable** are described as being at least partially gelatinous.
-   **Daybreak on Hyperion** has White Puddings. Essentially Gelatinous Cubes with the colour and texture of firm tofu.
-   **Differently Morphous** features many of these (specifically shoggoths) who have recently immigrated or, more accurately, sought asylum into Great Britain. They're Good All Along and much of the plot addresses society adjusting to their joining the workforce and existing in public.

-   **The Dresden Files**: One of the short stories opens with Harry having just wrapped up a case involving slime golems.

-   **Enchanted Forest Chronicles**: The "Quozzel" is repeatedly compared to blackberry jam, can seep into stone like a sponge, and causes earthquakes. It's fairly dangerous in its cave habitat and fairly harmless outside it.
-   **The Expanse**: The Protomolecule can do this, although it usually prefers Necromorph cosplay. In the prologue it's described as looking like a gob of mud that moves, and has a screaming face on it. When it's seen up close, we see it's also got the bones and organs of several people floating in it, overlapping with Body of Bodies.
-   **The Eye of Argon**: The eponymous gem inexplicably turns into a blob monster at the end.
-   **Forest Kingdom**: At one point in book 1 (**Blue Moon Rising**), a Blob Monster that also probably qualifies as an Eldritch Abomination shows up and needs to be Killed With Fire.
-   **The Future Is Wild**: The slithersucker, a giant slime mold, is a biologically-feasible variant in the form of a large, gelatinous colony of unicellular beings with enough cohesion to move around and grasp prey that flies into it.
-   Gelatinous green creatures known only as "blobs" menace our heroes in **Galaxy of Fear: The Planet Plague**. Their sticky ooze lets them climb walls and hang from ceilings. They were actually created by the Imperial Biological Weapons Division to spread viruses, and they used to be people; not content to just carry any old virus, they carry The Virus.
-   **Goosebumps**: Several books featured different blobs:
    -   **Monster Blood** and its sequels, with the titular blood. No organs, not even pseudopods. Just hungry slime.
    -   **Egg Monsters from Mars**: With the egg monsters themselves.
    -   **The Blob That Ate Everyone**: Obviously.
    -   **The Horror at Camp Jellyjam**: King Jellyjam.
-   **Gorgo the Ogre**: The titular character has to fight the Slobbering Monster to become a Golden Ogre. Said monster is a giant mass of green slime covered in tentacles and eyes with a vulnerable core. Thanks to its nature it's very difficult to get to his nest. The sequel also stars the King of the Black Ogre, who's essentially a small limbless blob with one eye covered in boils from which he can eject tentacles.

-   **I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream** ends in this fashion. After four of AM's five victims achieve death at last after 109 years of endless torture and immortality, AM snatches the final one, Ted, and genetically deforms his body into a fleshy blob so that he can never harm himself or be able to move freely ever again. He isn't even given a mouth to scream with. The bad ending of the video game adaptation actually lets you see what this looks like<small>◊</small>, and it can happen to any of the five characters, each with their own reactions.
-   **The Immortals**: The "Skinners" in the last book are nightmarish blobby monsters made of Chaos that are Immune to Arrows, only slightly less immune to a lot of magic and suck the life out of anything they touch. The Darklings in the same book, created by Orzone to be his spies, are likewise small, shadowy blob creatures. However, they're noncombatants and gain sentience and independence and do a Heel–Face Turn.
-   "The Incredibly Thick World" by Thomas Wylde (**The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction**, March 1979) features a biomechanical blob created when an alien life form merges with an oil slick in Long Beach Harbor.
-   **The Iron Teeth**: Fairly generic slimes exist. No much has been revealed yet but they can range in size and toughness and have crystal cores.
-   **Isekai ni Otosareta... Jouka wa Kihon!**: Spirits are translucent amorphous blobs, with two beady eyes floating about within them. The Protagonist likens them to amoeba.
-   **Jedi Academy Trilogy**: A humorous variant. The equivalent of horse races on the planet Umgul are run using specially bred racing blobs compared to living lumps of phlegm in appearance. The race itself consists of a "blobstacle course" where the racers most slide down greased chutes, squeeze themselves through mesh gratings and swing between hanging rings while avoiding dangers such as patches of desiccant or accidentally colliding and melding together.
-   **Kingdom on Fire**: One of the Ancients is Molochoron, "The Pale Destroyer". It's a gigantic blob with hair sticking out of it. He makes its first actual appearance in **A Sorrow Fierce and Falling**.
-   In **Known Space**, life-forms from icy worlds that use Helium II biochemistry tend to evolve into these.

-   In **The Monster Garden**, Frankie obtains a small lump of grey goo stolen from her father's lab. The goo first comes to life as an amorphous blob with two spots for eyes. It moves around and grabs things by creating small temporary tentacles. It becomes less bloblike as it grows larger and models its body plan on the humans, forming a head, limbs, hands, feet, and digits. By the time it reaches adulthood, it seems to have lost its shape-changing abilities.
-   Joseph Goebbels nearly gets devoured by a giant single-celled organism in the basement of a Mad Scientist in the Alternate History novel by Brad Linaweaver, **Moon Of Ice**.
-   **Night Shift**: In "Grey Matter", a man slowly changes into a Blob Monster after drinking a can of contaminated beer.
-   **Other People's Heroes**: The Gunk and the Goop exist as orange slime sometimes over a human skeleton. The Gunk is highly intelligent and can shapeshift. The Goop... less so as a transformed Lionheart.
-   Stanley G. Weinbaum's 1935 story "Parasite Planet" has monstrous Venusian blobs called "Doughpots" that ooze through the jungles of Venus absorbing anything that gets in their way.
-   **The Parasite War**: The Colloids are Blob Monster aliens who infest and eat human bodies.
-   **Perry Rhodan**: Pretty much every variant has appeared, up to and including at least two cases in which giant blobs were seen covering an entire **planet**. They've even been used for comic relief — the "Willies" (after the handle an automated translator stuck on the first-ever encountered) who mainly function as the Central Plasma's "nursemaids" are somewhat larger-than-human and highly **emotional** blob monsters with human-level intelligence and a tendency to panic when things go wrong around them.

-   **Quantum Devil Saga: Avatar Tuner**: Harley Q's Atma form is that of a gigantic Nigh-Invulnerable blob monster capable of absorbing dead matter around him. Said transformation is eventually upgraded to a full-blown Eldritch Abomination that is not even sentient any more and solely driven by its Horror Hunger.
-   Oswald, Alicia's father in **Rental Magica**, is an undead variation of this who can copy the forms of demons he's absorbed.
-   **The Scholomance**: The maw-mouths are gigantic, amorphous masses of flesh, covered with the stolen eyes and mouths of their victims. They're by far the most feared type of monster because they're just shy of impossible to harm, it's impossible to escape their pseuodopods, and the people they absorb are trapped, alive, forever.
-   **Skeleton Crew**: "The Raft" features an aquatic version that resembles an oil slick.
-   **Skies Unbroken**: Some islands have these. Chantil catches one for her collection, since they're basically slime mould that doesn't really need much, and grow veeeery slowly, so she can keep it for study in a jar. In an emergency, best course of action is to Kill It with Fire.
-   "Slime (1953)" is the tale of an ancient life form, a black mantle of amorphous ooze (that can form retractable tentacles at will) heaved from the bottom of the sea onto land. It lives only to eat organic matter, and the more it eats, the hungrier it gets.
-   **Slime (1988)**: The living toxic waste of the title is more of a Muck Monster than an actual blob, but it's close enough. Someone even jokingly name-drops **The Blob** at one point when The Sheriff is trying to warn everyone.
-   **Spheroid Echoes**: The story of this novella focuses on a living shroud that behaves and displays blob-like capabilities. Sometime later the creature itself claims to be a kind of Bio-Armor or The Symbiote.
-   **Ssalia and the Dragons of Avienot**: Some blob monsters appear as apparently carnivorous wildlife, lurking on the ground as blue puddles and attempting to engulf their prey when approached. Most violence doesn't faze them much, though their eyes seem to be more vulnerable than the rest of their bodies.
-   **Sword Of The Spirits**: The Bayemot, from **Beyond the Burning Lands,** the second book in the trilogy, are giant masses of living, translucent slime.
    
    I looked over the ruins to the next rise of ground, and saw the Bayemot. Except in size it was something like the bubbles of jelly that make up frog spawn. But it was almost as high as three other men, one above the other, and being flattened from a true sphere by the earth's pull was even greater in breadth. It was motionless but quivered, although the wind had dropped, and though it was nearly transparent there were darker shapes within.
    
-   Rimuru Tempest from **That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime** reincarnated as a slime due to how he unknowingly worded his dying regret/wishes during the reincarnation process, resembling a blue blob with eye indents. Thanks to various unique abilities he gains as part of the package deal, however, he finds it's not so bad, and his form makes him very huggable to beautiful women. He eventually gains a skill that lets him mimic other creatures and eventually reclaims a human form...based off a woman.

-   **The Unexplored Summon://Blood-Sign** has the Original series of Materials. They're the weakest of all Materials, and come in three colors (red, yellow and green). However, they're still dangerous to normal humans, being strong enough to shatter concrete and (like all Materials) they can't be damaged by non-supernatural means.

Blob Monster Example in Live-Action TV

-   **Alien Worlds (2020)**: The surface of Atlas is home to boneless, blob-like scavengers that move by slowly rolling over the ground and feed by engulfing and dissolving organic matter.
-   **Eureka**: The Monster of the Week in one episode. Carter tries to kill it with a Freeze Ray, cause "it worked in **The Blob**". It doesn't work. A salt bomb, on the other hand, works perfectly.
-   **Extraterrestrial (2005)**: In their collective form, hysteria resemble a creeping mass of yellow goo that crawls along the ground, seeking prey to infest and digest from the inside out.
-   **Monster Warriors**: In "Beware the Blob Thing", the Monster Warriors battle a blob monster that somehow appears to consume Mayor Mel and almost does the same to Vanka.
-   **Monty Python's Flying Circus**: Spoofed in a science fiction episode with a man-eating blancmange from 2,200,000 light-years away. It plays tennis well (at least so long as its opponents are Scotsmen) but has the weakness of being edible.
-   **Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide**: In one episode, Ned's lunch (apparently some kind of tuna casserole) crawls off his lunch tray.
-   **Odd Squad**: The organization has blobs in and of themselves, which are, more often than not, antagonistic towards both agents and clients. They can come in a range of sizes as well as two colors (with no differentiation in between both colors), can sense the presence of others, and can spew parts of itself at people as a defensive tactic with no adverse effects.
-   **The Orville**: Yaphit is a blob-like alien creature voiced by Norm Macdonald, who has a crush on the human medical chief and can feel every part of his body if it separates from him which happens once that Bortus, a fellow crewmember accidentally eats one because of a prank from a third party.
-   **The Outer Limits (1963)** features a few variations. The Chromoite from "The Mice" combines a faceless, globular upper body with humanoid limbs. The upper half of the costume was reused as an alien Brain Monster in "The Guests", leading to a straighter example of this trope. The box monster from "Don't Open Till Doomsday" also qualifies.

-   **The Quatermass Experiment** features an alien amoeba which absorbs organic matter that comes in contact with it. What's disturbing is that it retains their brains in full functionality after it absorbs them.
-   **The Secret World of Alex Mack**: The title character is infamous for morphing herself into a silvery goo in order to sneak around. Season 2 gave her the ability to absorb anyone or anything in her mass and carry it with her.
-   **Star Trek**:
    -   **Star Trek: The Next Generation**: "Skin of Evil" has the crew encountering an intelligent and malevolent blob monster named Armus who resembles a humanoid oil slick. In one of the more chilling scenes, he absorbs Cmdr. Riker into himself.
    -   **Star Trek: Deep Space Nine**: Odo in his natural state (his usual form resembles a Bajoran, because that is the species that found and raised him), as well as his species, the Founders, in their natural state — when they are healthy. Also, a Founder can take a lot of energy — one shot from Klingon blaster can kill a human (or Klingon) — but hundreds of them were needed to bring down the Founder impersonating General Martok. Odo is actually not as stable with his abilities as the average Founder, or as good at shapeshifting, due to spending most of his life separate from them. He cannot hold a solid form for more than 16 hours or so, and has difficulty mimicking specific individuals. Also, in one episode, Odo is subject to some substance which turns him into literal Blob Monster (i.e., with similar personality).
    -   **Star Trek: Picard**: In the third season it's revealed that Section 31 had experimented on changeling prisoners of war, creating a new subspecies of Changelings that were still liquid when in their natural states but could create blood and internal organs to fool Starfleet screening methods. They passed the ability on to other changelings who disagreed with Odo's reforms and attempted to help the Borg destroy the Federation.
-   **Tensou Sentai Goseiger**: Makuin of the Blob. Despite what the above says, he is **not** a Monster of the Week, but rather a full-fledged enemy commander.
-   **Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles**:
    -   There's a "female T-1000" known as the T-1001 posing as Catherine Weaver, and is shown to be far more deadly than her predecessor when it comes to terminating. Became the butt of a running joke in the fandom when she first displayed her apparently more effective shapeshifting power when she morphs out of the form of a urinal and busts out a cheesy pun. Unlike the original T-1000 and similar units, this particular T-1000 is assisting the heroes.
    -   The T-1001's default form is shown in a later episode taking place during the war where it is depicted as a vaguely humanoid-looking thing with no face or defining features. It later turns out to be the same T-1001 impersonating Catherine.

Blob Monster Example in Podcasts

-   The **Jemjammer** party encounters several oily slimes in the sewers of Port Meridian with the ability to corrode their weaponry. Fortunately they hit hard and fast enough to avoid any serious damage to their equipment.
-   **Pretending to Be People** features The Residue, an amorphous blob with vague temporal powers.

---
Blob Monster Example in Puppet Shows

-   **Fraggle Rock**: Downplayed in "Boober and the Glob". A roundish, pinkish, globular monster (with a solid body) rolls into the Great Hall of Fraggle Rock and proceeds to eat Doozers. Boober Fraggle manages to free them by telling knock-knock jokes, making the Glob laugh and allowing the Doozers to escape while its mouth is open. They're none the worse for their experience.

---
Blob Monster Example in Roleplay

-   Katheryn from **Dawn of a New Age: Oldport Blues** is transformed into a mass of sentient ink during the Mass Super-Empowering Event. Her movement in her new form is extremely limited, thus she spends most of her time in Finn's notebook. She's able to communicate to him by forming her body into words.
-   Mortal from **The Insane Quest of Unfathomable Randomness** is one of these.

---
Blob Monster Example in Tabletop Games

-   **Arduin** has quite a few of these. All have a semi-liquid composition and ooze around attacking any living creatures they can find and catch.
    -   The Glaft is a translucent rubbery giant amoeba. If it scores a critical hit it will cover the victim's breathing orifices and suffocate them. If not, it will stick to its victim like glue and secrete digestive acid to dissolve then.
    -   The Rippler is an amorphous amoeba-like monster found in underground areas that clings to ceilings and drops on creatures passing below. It wraps itself around the victim, crushing and smothering it until it dies.
    -   Blue Gunky is a puddle of blue slime that can fire a bolt of energy at opponents. It feeds on Life Energy.
    -   Blue Ooze looks like a puddle of bluish water. It eats by enveloping and dissolving other creatures.
    -   Emerald Ooze looks like a huge pulsing liquid emerald. It attacks with 1-10 Combat Tentacles (pseudopods) and every living it touches is turned into more Emerald Ooze.
    -   Black Slime is a thick puddle of black shiny tar-like slime. It dissolves the flesh of any creature it touches and hunts by detecting the magnetic field of its victims.
    -   Blue Slime looks like a puddle of deep blue goo. It attacks either with 1-3 10 foot long Combat Tentacles or by enveloping its victim and dissolving it. It hunts by detecting the heat given off by its target.
    -   Chartreuse Slime is a viscous puddle of bright green quivering goo that smells of mint. It uses 1-5 Combat Tentacles to grab its prey.
    -   Gold Slime looks like a pool of glowing molten gold. It attacks by enveloping a target or grabbing it with a palp (Combat Tentacles).
    -   Orange Slime appears to be a 1 inch thick layer of bright orange slime. It can dissolve bare flesh by touch.
    -   Red Slime is immune to normal fire and resistant to magical fire. It can flow on ceilings to attack victims from above.
    -   Silver Slime looks like a pool of liquid mercury. Its touch causes massive damage to organic materials (such as living tissue) and it can enter and leave the ethereal plane at will.
    -   White Slime can attack either with 1-20 Combat Tentacles (each 13 feet long) or by wrapping itself around its opponent and dissolving it. In either case it can paralyze a target by touch.
    -   The Greater Demon Shuggondra the Bloated One is a huge white mass of squirming, quivering translucent flesh with various protuberances (pods, nodules, tentacles etc.). It has no apparent eyes or mouth. It attacks by crushing and digesting opponents or shooting out a poisonous gas. Any damage it takes is healed at a rate of 8 HitPoints per melee round.
-   Chaosium: **All the Worlds' Monsters** Volume III:
    -   The Blink Blob is a 40-50 foot diameter bag of protoplasm that can teleport up to 30 feet in any direction at will.
    -   The Lightning Mound is a mound of jelly that can sense heat and will attack any moving warm object nearby. It has a 20 foot long tentacle extending from its center that does massive damage and will not let go until the target is dead.
    -   The Surface Tension Monster is a completely transparent giant amoeba. It can also take the shape of a humanoid or a pool of water. Once it grabs a creature it will hold on and crush the victim for 1-4 Hit Points of damage per turn until either it or the victim dies.
-   **Big Eyes, Small Mouth**: **Cute & Fuzzy Seizure Monsters**, the Mons Sourcebook, includes stats for creating these as mons. One of the sample trainers has a blob monster pet that mutated from a really old jar of mayonnaise.
-   **Dungeons & Dragons** has a **lot** of these, to the point where "ooze" is a primary creature type. Black puddings, ochre jellies, green slimes, gray oozes... if it can be sneezed it has a stat block and a challenge rating.
    -   The gelatinous cube is cube-shaped so that it can completely fill a dungeon corridor and thus eat organic materials off the walls and ceiling (but more importantly block off a corridor), and gelatinous because it's transparent, the better to surprise adventurers with. Lore Sjoberg describes it as "evolutionarily adapted to graph paper." Some **Monster Manual** descriptions of it imply that it must have been made by some wizard to clean up messy dungeon corridors.
    -   One very dangerous type is the mustard jelly, named for its yellow color and odor of mustard. Unlike most oozes, it isn't mindless, having human-level intelligence. One legend says that the first of them was created when a female elf wizard tried to polymorph herself into a grey ooze, but an error in the spell turned her into the first mustard jelly.
    -   A slithering tracker is another intelligent ooze. A predator, it does not eat the flesh of victims, but drains the moisture from their bodies. There are some frightening legends that say these creatures were originally humans who were transformed by evil wizards, but such tales have never been proven.
    -   Another example is the mimics and various other shapeshifters, whose malleability mixed with chameleon-like powers allow them to disguise themselves as many things.
    -   The gibbering mouther: a blob that has evolved eyes and teeth. **Lots** of eyes and teeth. In the 4th Edition, it is believed to have origins in the Far Realm. In at least some editions' interpretation, it hasn't so much "evolved" them as it simply absorbs and uses those of its victims.
    -   The aoa from the third edition **Fiend Folio** is a variant: it resembles a large blob of mercury, but it floats around detecting and intercepting arcane magic and spellcasters to consume the magical energy for sustenance. Apparently, some spellcasters summon them as servitors and keep them sated on the residual energy of their demesnes. And more disturbingly, YOU if you take the Oozemaster Prestige Class.
    -   The demon lord Juiblex the Faceless Lord, and the god Ghaunadaur, That Which Lurks. Bwimb was once the most powerful entity on the Paraelemtal Plane of Ooze, but was killed in the epic module **Dead Gods**.
    -   **Mystara**: The second edition **Monstrous Compendium Appendix** describes the scamille, a giant (six to ten feet wide) intelligent amoeba-like creature that can assume the shape of any object.
    -   In the short-lived official **AD&D** version of the Cthulhu Mythos (Cthulhu and his buddies got a chapter in the first edition of **Deities & Demigods**, but later editions removed it after a copyright dispute with another publisher), Shub-Niggurath is depicted as a noxious lake of protoplasm in a cavern beneath a mountain, constantly generating various monsters out of its own mass and then re-consuming any that foolishly stumble too close to it again. It's a niftily creepy image, but it's actually taken from one of Clark Ashton's Smith's mythos critters, Abhoth.
-   **Fabula Ultima**: The Mellow Ooze and Static Ooze are a pair of round gelatinous creatures. The former is classified as a Monster while the latter is classified as an Elemental, and both resist physical damage due to their gelatinous natures.
-   **Gamma World**: In adventure GW1 **The Legion of Gold**, one possible encounter is with a gigantic amoeba-like creature in a lake.
-   **Godforsaken**:
    -   A cold slime is a patch of animate, semi-intelligent slime attacks any living creature it finds.
    -   Aevae are undulating masses of green and white gelatinous goo that can harden their fluid forms temporarily to create strangling tendrils that they use to kill and consume prey, adding the biomass to their own, and merge with each other to make a larger one.
-   **GURPS**
    -   **GURPS Dungeon Fantasy**, being an homage to old-school **D&D**, has a whole supplement of them: **Dungeon Fantasy Monsters 2: Icky Goo**.
        
        **Goo lacks most of the weaknesses of complex organisms that have internal organs, eyeballs, debts, and regrets.**
        
    -   **GURPS Monsters**. The Woodbury Blob is four foot wide (and tall, and thick), weighs 500 pounds and is made up of amorphous living protoplasm. It eats by flowing over a living creature and absorbing it into its own body. It's almost Immune to Bullets, which will make it a challenge to destroy.
-   **Heart Of The Sunken Lands**:
    -   There are a variety of slimes in the Sunken Lands, all amorphous blobs of living flesh that live in wet areas and can grow as large as 120 pounds. They are aggressively carnivorous, flowing along the ground and enveloping any creature slower than they are. They attack by secreting an acidic corrosive that eats away their victim's body. They reproduce by splitting off small slimes.
    -   The Woodsmasher appears to be giant version of the common slimes (experts think they may be slimes that continued growing instead of splitting off baby slimes). There are no more than a couple of dozen of them in the Sunken Lands. They leave a trail of devastation 10 yards wide behind them as they travel.
-   **Hero System**:
    -   **Hero System Bestiary**: The Living Jelly was a large monster that grew even larger (up to 128 meters high) when it ate other living things. It grabbed other creatures and used acid to dissolve them and eat them. At their largest size they could move faster than a normal human being could run.
    -   **Fantasy Hero Companion**: An Amorphous Horror demon is a mass of protean ooze with five pseudopods (Combat Tentacles).
-   **Magic: The Gathering**: These are referred to as Oozes, and are a common creature type associated with Green mana; most are living waves of greenish jelly, and feed by dissolving organic matter and absorbing it into themselves. Green is associated with traditionalism, nature, and a rejection of excessively "civilized" or intellectual pursuits in favor of a simpler, more direct life. Oozes embody the most extreme form of that concept by remaining firmly at the oldest, most primal stage of life, before living things were caught up in extravagances like "thoughts" and "limbs" and "senses", back then were was only life, hunger, and survival.
-   **Pathfinder** includes a lot of different blob monsters, many of them identical to those found in **Dungeons & Dragons** above. Notably examples include the hungry flesh, gunpowder oozes, often produced as a byproduct of alchemy and the fledgling fireweapon industry, which can detonate parts of themselves as a ranged attack; and blights, which respond to the setting's tradition of slimes being mindless and blind by being covered in eyes and extremely intelligent.
-   **Scion** presents the Hekatonkheires of Greek mythology as **huge** (as in, aircraft carrier huge) blobs of protoplasmic muck that can change shape at will (for example, to create a hundred giant tentacles with which to crush their enemies, leading to the common legend). Since they are fluid, no physical attack can do so much as scratch them. There are three, and most of the Dodekatheon agree that if all three were to attack Olympus together, **Olympus will fall**.
-   **Sentinels of the Multiverse**: Progeny is a large, sapient mass of liquid metal. It usually prefers to keep a humanoid shape, but several of its cards show it in various bizarre forms. It's one of the hardest villains to defeat because there are very, **very** few ways to reliably hurt something made out of liquid metal, especially when it can also control energy (it was literally built as a hero-hunting living weapon).
-   **Shadowrun**: The supplement **Paranormal Animals of Europe** describes proteans, amorphous Awakened (magical) monsters made out of protozoans that resemble the dysentery bacterium. They engulf animals and digest them with their acidic secretions.
-   **Star Frontiers** has Dralasites available as a Player Character race. Which certainly inspired in turn the various "Plasmoid" species — Blob Monsters with intelligence — in the **Spelljammer** setting.
-   **Star Realms**: Played with one of the factions. The Blobs are originally very hostile to humans. But their name is a nickname, a result of the first captured alien ships only having amorphous biomass as the remains of the crew.
-   **Tails of Equestria**: Oozes, divided into lesser and greater variants, are blobs of acidic, semi-living slime created as a side-effect of magical activity. They mindlessly creep towards nearby organic matter, which they dissolve and incorporate into themselves.
-   One expansion for **Unmatched** has the Blob as a (comparatively) minor enemy.
-   **Villains & Vigilantes**: In the adventure **The Devil's Domain**, slime demons are gigantic amoebas with the powers of Force Field and Power Blast.
-   **Warhammer**:
    -   **Necromunda**:
        -   Icrotic slime is a transparent, fist-sized blob monster visually indistinguishable from the various spills of toxic liquid found in the Sump, which feeds on the brain of living creatures. While feeding, the Icrotic slime releases chemicals into its victim's body that give them a highly euphoric feeling and boosts their physical abilities. The positive effects of being host to an Icrotic slime mean that, during 1st Edition, gang fighters can use Icrotic slimes as a highly dangerous combat drug, trusting their comrades to remove the slime before it totally consumes their brain.
        -   Sludge jellies are large gelatinous masses that inhabit the toxic lakes of the sump. When they sense passing prey, they reach out with tentacles up to hundreds of feet long and attempt to sting it to death.
    -   **Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay**: Chaos slime is a substance resembling a runny, pink or blue liquid produced under somewhat unclear circumstances; it's generally assumed to be a residue left after a daemon is banished and/or to be produced by and eventually consume certain mutants. Regardless of origin, it's living and fairly aggressive, forming parts of itself into tendrils with which to lash at passing creatures.

Blob Monster Example in Toys

-   **BIONICLE**: Tren Krom is at least partly gelatinous. One of the most powerful beings in the story, he originally served as a temporary god of sorts, keeping the Matoran Universe functioning while it was still being built. The limit of his powers is never shown, but he can generate bodyparts at will. The fact that all that's left of him are pieces of jelly after being killed serves as more evidence that he was a blob monster.
-   **Flick-to-Stick Bungees**: Kolnes/Kilnes from the European Series 1 is dripping at the hands and mouth, indicating it's made of muck.

---
Blob Monster Example in Video Games

-   **The Adventures of Lomax**: The enemies from the space world look like blobs of green goo when walking, but turn into a humanoid shape when attacking.
-   **After Armageddon Gaiden** has Loperus, a one-eyed green slime monster as one of your main party members.
-   **Alice: Madness Returns** features such creatures as the primary mooks of the game.

-   **Alisia Dragoon**: Blob monsters of various sorts show up all over. Some of them light on fire when attacking or being attacked.
-   **Amorphous+**: You fight **absolutely nothing** EXCEPT for these. Unfortunately, they come in many varieties — one explodes into deadly acid on death, another tries to **rip your heart out**, yet another explodes into a fiery explosion while its counterpart explodes in a freezing blast, a metal version that attacks with Combat Tentacles (and is only vulnerable when doing so!), etc. Some species of blob can combine to become stronger blobs! The simple Green Blob, The Goomba of the game, can meld together with 3 other Green Blobs to form the Void Eater, a gravity-controlling Boss in Mook Clothing.
-   **Angband** has stolen several jellies and oozes from DnD. There is also the Quylthulg, a pulsating mound of animated flesh that summons other monsters.
-   **ANNO: Mutationem**: The Eroder is a large red inanimate floating blob-like creature that can forcibly turn anyone into it upon contact and can inflict Mind Rape when in close proximity. The exact nature of its body cannot be determined by The Consortium's researchers as is it inaccessible to humans.
-   **Anodyne**: Slimes, whose card's Flavor Text is a Hurricane of Puns:
    
    **"Jello there, Young! So goo to flanly meet you! Why don't you set for a minute? I was just pudding on some tea!"**
    
-   **Anvil of Dawn** features mud-like goo girls as sturdy enemies near the end of the game.
-   **Arcana Heart**: Kira's blob gives her the appearance of an imposing Mighty Glacier. Without it, she's only a hair above three-and-a-half feet tall.
-   **Avernum**: Slimes are one of the more annoying monsters a low-level party can face. Some have an acidic touch, while others split when struck.
-   **Awesomenauts**: Scoop, one of the playable characters, is a hammy Knight in Shining Armor who happens to be a vaguely-humanoid slime monster.
-   **The Binding of Isaac:** Some enemies resemble shapless blobs. Clotty and Glog are with a bone sticking out while I.Blob, Clot and cohort are just blobs with mouths.
-   **BIONICLE: Quest for the Toa**: The Vatuka mud monster is a remnant of the abandoned elemental creatures that would have showed up in the cancelled PC game **The Legend of Mata Nui**, to which **QFTT** was a prequel. Among other element-based monsters, **LOMN** would have featured the much larger Vatuka Nui, the elemental of Earth as a level boss.

-   **Bloody Zombies** have zombie blobs, an entire mass of flesh fused together from various bodies, supported by a number of stubbly legs, as a recurring enemy type.
-   **Bound by Blades**: Skullako is a giant blob-thing with a Skull for a Head. Meanwhile its arms are protruding bones.
-   **BoxxyQuest: The Shifted Spires**: Remains of Adventurers are this. Blobs of slime that were once adventurers.
-   **A Boy and His Blob**: The blob can change shape by eating jellybeans. In the Wii version, a lot of the enemies are more or less blob-like.
-   **Brave Hero Yuusha** has the Oozies: Medicoozies (Which heal), Bloozies (Which are blue), etc...
-   **Bug Fables** has the Abomihoney, which is what happens when honey droplets are improperly mixed.
-   **Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth** featured a classic Lovecraftian monster in the Shoggoth — in this guise, a huge, semi-sentient mass of acidic slime that infested the inside of a refinery. The touch of it was so painful and damaging that J Edgar Hoover had to perform a Mercy Kill on a hapless victim.
-   **Carrion**: The **protagonist** is a shoggoth-like amalgamation of bleeding meat, teeth, and tendrils. It's somewhere between this and The Worm That Walks (well, slithers, it being amorphous).
-   **Castlevania**: Slimes are a minor recurring enemy, seen in **Castlevania: Circle of the Moon**, and **Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance**, first appearing as Chest Monsters in **Vampire Killer**.
-   **Chantelise**: The various faceless slime monsters the player faces throughout the game. There's the four elemental varieties: Fire, Water, Air and Earth, a grey Metal Slime variant, and large Water Slimes.
-   **City of Heroes** has Hamidon, which is an endgame raid boss and one of the game's most powerful enemies.
-   **ClayFighter**: A character named simply the Blob is playable. He's an unshaped mass of clay, and his attacks mostly revolve around changing shape, such as transforming into a boot when the kick buttons are pressed or turning into a buzzsaw and flying at the opponent.
-   **Command & Conquer**: Visceroids up until **Command & Conquer: Tiberium Wars**. They result from an uneven Tiberium mutation, resulting in a gob of necrotic flesh that can only experience hunger. When two Visceroids merge, they become dangerous, able to threaten vehicles and spray tiberium gasses to create more visceroids.
-   **Corridor 7: Alien Invasion** has the Semaj aliens, purple blob-creatures with fangs and four eyes on tiny eyestalks.
-   **Crush, Crumble, and Chomp!**: One of the playable characters is the Glob, a shapeless, gelatinous monster that absorbs obstacles and leaves a flammable slime trail in its wake. Players with the disc-based version could also build their own variants.
-   **Cute Knight Kingdom**: The Lava Blobs in the western volcano, which is one of the dungeons.
-   **Dark Cavern**: The zig-zaggy blobs that steal your player's collection of bullets when you come into contact with them.
-   **Dark Souls**:
    -   Being a JRPG, **Dark Souls** naturally had to have some Slimes around. In typical **Dark Souls** fashion, however, they look pretty much like you would expect a pile of living sludge to look like (i.e., not pleasant), and are only found in the sewers of the Undead Settlement. They aren't particularly dangerous, being extremely slow, but they also have incredible defenses against anything except for fire, so you'll need to poke and slash at them a lot before they die. They can also hang out on ceilings, drop, and start munching on your head unexpectedly, which is both scary and does a large amount of damage.
    -   **Dark Souls III** features the return of the Slimes in any area where the forces of the Deep have a presence, as well as a new fiery variant in the Demon Ruins that is significantly more dangerous (and also loses their weakness to fire). It also has Aldrich, the "Saint of the Deep", who was original a cannibalistic human who eventually became a formless mass of black sludge when he started eating **gods**.
-   **Dead Cells**: The protagonist has been described as "a lump of snot on a corpse". It's a head-sized, green ameoboid creature with a burning (read: actively producing smoke like a hot coal) red nucleus fused to the neck stump of a recently decapitated plague victim.
-   **Deadly Rooms of Death** houses both massive blob monsters, and tiny ones. Named, inventively enough Tar, Mud, and Gel, with the smaller versions being Tar Babies, Mud Babies, and Gel Babies.
-   **de Blob**: The eponymous protagonist, naturally. He has a different, much blobbier design in the obscure PC tech demo that started the franchise.
-   **Delve Deeper** has both slimes and slime cubes.
-   **Devil May Cry**:
    -   In the the first game, Mundus, the Final Boss, begins as a living statue of a god, but once you defeat his first two forms, he begins to degenerate until he ends up a horrid blob.
    -   Argosax the Chaos, Final Boss of **Devil May Cry 2**, appears as one before ascending into his better-looking, constantly sex-changing One-Winged Angel, The Despair Embodied.
    -   The penultimate boss in **Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening**,Arkham, turns into one after briefly assuming the guise of Sparda.
    -   The Nightmare boss from the original, a huge black blob with a vulnerable core as well as the recurring Shadow mini-boss. Both reappear in **Devil May Cry 5** as V's familiars, the former functioning as his "Devil Trigger" weapon and the latter his "melee weapon".
-   **Disgaea**: The third, fourth, and fifth games have the Slime monster species, appearing as featureless blobs wearing horned skulls. As with some of the other examples, they boast an extremely high amount of resistance to physical attacks, and also take halved damage from non-elemental attacks, but are vulnerable to magic.
-   **Distorted Travesty 3** has slimes both in its Zelda segment, and its RPG segment.
-   **Doomsday Warrior**: Nuform is a creature made of liquid metal.
-   **Dragon's Crown** has the rarely appearing Slime monsters. They could only harm characters by bumping into them, but their amorphous nature makes them highly resistant to all types of damage except fire. Equally rare but more dangerous are the Living Mud monsters, which could fire mud-ball barrages, swallow up your characters, and merge with the muddy environment to attack from below.
-   **Dragon Quest**: Slimes<small>◊</small> are an iconic, early-game enemy in the series. Though there are tougher varieties, including those made of metal. Surprisingly, no Phlegmings.
-   **Dwarf Fortress** both plays this straight and subverts it: some randomly generated creatures do not have organs and thus only die via Chunky Salsa Rule. However, other ones, as well as "blood men", are made of liquid but have no way to pull themselves together: on the lightest contact they just **split apart**. There's also cave blobs, which qualify for the second and are explicitly referred to as blobs with a thin membrane, vulnerable to sharp things. And finally, some of the procedurally-generated monstrosities that can siege your fortress are blobs of various materials. Liquid ones are pathetic, but solid ones like salt or rock are troublesome, and blobs of metals (especially steel) are considered hard evidence the Random Number God despises you.
-   **EarthBound (1994)** has a number of slimy enemies that are apparently living piles of vomit. Their leader is the stinky, foul, and overall disgusting Master Belch, later known as Master Barf.
-   **Elden Ring**:
    -   The game inherits the slimes from **Dark Souls**, with the same characteristics: extremely slow but extremely tough, unless you set them on fire. There are also several varieties of slimes, including some infected with Scarlet Rot, or some made out of firey magma (which, naturally, have lost their weakness to fire).
    -   Silver Tears are mysterious things that look like living blobs of liquid silvery metal. They can form spears and shields out of their own bodies, and some will explode with an electric burst upon death. Larger Silver Tears can even form sentient metallic boulders that will roll toward the player to crush them. The most advanced are the Mimic Tears, which transform into human soldiers or larger monsters, and a couple boss variants can even copy the player themselves!
-   **Epic Battle Fantasy**: Slimes are an enemy fought in every game. **Epic Battle Fantasy 1**, **Epic Battle Fantasy 2**, **Epic Battle Fantasy 3**, **Epic Battle Fantasy 4**, **Epic Battle Fantasy 5**, **Adventure Story**, **Bullet Heaven**, **Bullet Heaven 2**.
-   **Fairy Bloom**: The games involve beating up formless brown blobs of monster coming from the sides of the screen.
    -   **Fairy Bloom**: They're all the same size, fight in melee, and difficulty increases by having larger numbers of them.
    -   **Fairy Bloom Freesia**: They come in different sizes, and some have long-range attacks with some sort of spitting move.
-   **Fate**: Gels are very wimpy monsters — even your pet kills them easily — although poisonous and electrified variants turn up as you go deeper into the Dungeon.
-   **Final Fantasy**: The recurring Flan species of monsters. They're always resistant to almost any physical damage and weak to magic elemental damage, usually the opposite of which they tend to use.
-   **Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach** has The Blob, a grotesque amalgamation of the melted remains of the animatronics from **Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator**. In the Golden Ending, it foils William Afton's latest attempt at a comeback.
-   **Gamer 2** has several stationary slime monsters that shoot slime balls in the air and serve as timing puzzles, since you need to walk over them.
-   **Genshin Impact** has slimes which are elemental lifeforms born from natural concentrations of said element, and each one has appropriate Elemental Powers. They are simple and unintellignt beings, but ignore them for too long and they might become a problem.
-   **Gish** from titular game is one of the first blob-like characters to have blob-like characteristics. Unlike most other blobs featured as main characters, Gish has a different looks and attitude.

-   **Guild Wars: Eye of the North** introduces Oozes, blobs that inhabited the underground. Some of which **explode**. They also have a minipet version and a tonic that turns you into one temporarily.
-   **The Halloween Hack**: The Evil Ecto, which looks like a Palette Swap of the Soul Consuming Flames. They are found in the creepy part of Twoson sewers, which means they are basically ghosts. They have a creepy scream and can Mind Rape Varik with Brainshock Alpha.
-   **Hangzo** have various blob-like enemies in the second level, an Absurdly-Spacious Sewer. From animated sewer grime assuming an humanoid form to gigantic amoeba creatures, as well as a King Mook giant blob-thing as its boss.
-   **Helbreath** has slimes as one of the weakest enemies in the game.
-   In **Ice Age 2: The Meltdown**, the primary enemy fought inside Maelstrom when he swallows you are bluish blobs of slime. These are relatively difficult to kill, because they have good health, move all over the place and attack with a damaging Ground Pound.
-   **Indivisible** features at least three separate varieties. The second runthrough of Tai Kreung features a large humanoid martial artist made of liquid metal as one of the mini-bosses. The second visit to Iron Kingdom features more traditional slime monsters roaming the sewers and factory who can reflect physical damage inflicted on them. At the end is the boss, the Slime Queen, (a mutated Mary corrupted by a combination of Kala's brainwashing and the slime permeating the city) sharing the same reflective properties but can turn into a DnD slime cube impervious to damage unless Anja uses the Goddess Hand powerup to smash through.
-   **Inexistence Rebirth**: The game has bouncing blob monsters as an enemy type for Hald to encounter.
-   **Intrepid Izzy**: The first enemies encountered are green blob creatures with fez hats.
-   **The Jackbox Party Pack**: The Glob from "Monster Seeking Monster" is an orange slime monster that likes to "play the field"; its heart points **double** every time it dates three different monsters, meaning in a full game of seven players (eight if there's an Audience) it can date a different monster on all six nights and score a **lot** of points.
-   **Jelly Boy** and its unreleased sequel for the SNES features a main cast of these with their own special abilities, requiring the player to switch between characters to get access to other areas.
-   **Karma Zoo**: Amorphous blob is the first playable character you can play as.
-   **Kero Blaster**: The "Negativus Legatia" are black circular blobs with red eyes that can fuse together to form a bigger blob. Also known simply as the "things".
-   **Kingdom Hearts III** has the Lump of Horror Unversed boss and the Flantastic Seven Heartless.
-   **Kingdom of Loathing**:
    -   Black puddings are a food item. Occasionally, one will turn out to be alive.
    -   The acid blobs in the Dungeons of Doom, and Lumpy the Sinister Sauce-Blob, the Big Bad of the Sauceror's Nemesis Quest.
    -   Slimes are one of the official monster classifications ("phyla"). Depending on how you count, there are at least twenty different types of them so far.
-   **Kirby**: Kirby's companions from **Kirby's Dream Land 3**, Gooey and Chuchu, are distinctly blob-like. **Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards** has the boss Magman, a huge blob of Living Lava. There's also Miasmorors from **Kirby: Planet Robobot**, who is heavily implied to be a mutated Galbo. But the most horrifying example is Fecto Forgo, the Big Bad of **Kirby and the Forgotten Land**. An alien abomination unable to survive outside the Eternal Capsule it calls "home", it degenerates into a blob of blue muck the instant it escapes, and has to assimilate members of the Beast Pack into a disgusting chimera just to keep a stable form.
-   **Landfall Archives** have the aptly-named "Blob Game", where you're trapped in a lab with a giant blob creature.
-   **Last Armageddon**: One of your party members is a talking slime creature with acid and corrosion-based abilities.
-   **League of Legends**: Zac, the Secret Weapon, is a giant blob with a human shape and when killed can split into four more traditional blob monsters that try to reunite and if succeeded, will revive him on spot. And for a monster, he's a fun, personable and boisterous guy... compared to the psychos that reside in Zaun.
-   **The Legend of Zelda** has a myriad of blob enemies, including Bots, Bits, Zols, ChuChus, and other similar creatures.
    -   **The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time**: Morpha is a small, spherical creature controlling a large mass of living, amorphous water.
    -   **The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask** has a blob monster (with a frog monster inside, controlling it) as a miniboss in Great Bay Temple. If the blob absorbs you, the frog pummels you inside before kicking you out. Naturally, it is defeated by shattering it with Ice Arrows.
-   **Locoroco**, which came out after that, had a blob-like main character too, but compared to Gish, it had nothing much else in common.
-   **Loop Hero**: Slimes are the first enemies to be fought in the game.
-   **Lufia**: Jellies are quite pitiful early on, though Green Jellies tend to be even in strength with other enemies where they're encountered. Each game past the first also includes the Master Jelly as the Optional Boss at the end of the Ancient Cave.
-   **Luxaren Allure** has Villain Slimes, Caster Slimes, Dastardly Slimes, Heal Potion Blobs...
-   **MARDEK** has an Ooze monster type, which includes Water Drops, Blood Clots and Lava Bubbles, among others.
-   **Man-Eating Plant** have featureless, mindless green blobs as the first enemies you can gobble up. They're presumably left there by your master for training you to gobble intruders on sight.

-   **Master of Orion** and its sequel has a Space Amoeba as one of the random event monsters. In the latter, if you don't defeat the monster, you're treated to a cutscene of it enveloping the planet.
-   **Mega Man**: **Mega Man (Classic)**: The Bio-Devils. Only shots directed at their eyes will do any kind of damage to them. They also existed in **Mega Man X** (once), **Zero** (twice, although it's the same enemy only rebuilt) and arguably **ZX** (in which the creature is made out of **magma**). It has a Spiritual Successor in **Legends** known as the "Rimblemenji", which slithers around the floor like an amoeba.

-   **Metal Morph**: The titular character can only turn into a puddle but his ship is capable of multiple shapes with their own weapons
-   **Metroid**:
    -   **Metroid II: Return of Samus** has the indestructible flitt, the pathetically weak meboid, and the blobs thrown by the blob thrower.
    -   **Metroid Fusion** has the X Parasites, nasty floating amoeba-like aliens that can take the shape of any creature they've infected and killed.
    -   **Metroid Prime 2: Echoes**: The Inglets are small Ing specimens that move around as dark, harmful ilk stains; they attack Samus by throwing dark matter at her. A similar, Phazon-made creature named Phaz-ing shows up later in **Metroid Prime 3: Corruption**, namely in Phaaze.
-   **Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor**: The oozes completely impervious to physical damage and varied from merely resistant to immune with Cleric spells. Even when you have the expensive, damage-rich elemental spells in your Sorcerer's arsenal, they're as hardy as ever. They alone make the plot-critical Red Dwarf Mines particularly steep for a novice party to face. It's actually intentional in the last case. The quest-giver outright states that he is sending you to a place with oozes and medusas, who are resistant to physical attacks and magic respectively, and overcoming them is the point. It's strongly suggested to buy a few appropriate scrolls to use.
-   **Miitopia**: The Slime enemies are nothing more that blobs with Mii facial features. One of them is the first enemy fought within the game.
-   **Minecraft** has slimes, essentially sentient globs of slime which split into smaller ones if you hit them. Magma cubes, which are sentient globs of lava, are their counterparts in the Nether dimension and function in a similar way.
-   **Monster Hunter (PC)** has living blobs, and interestingly enough, they're far from The Goomba; they're instead among the most powerful and dangerous enemies in the entire game <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>. Not only are they surprisingly fast despite being a legless pile of jelly, they can also turn **invisible** and sneak upon players. Later on there's a difficult boss battle against a giant blob King Mook.
-   **Monster Rancher**: The Jell is a vaguely humanoid blob that can morph into a variety of things ranging from a spike-covered top to a **helicopter**. They look even more blob-like in **Monster Rancher 3**.
-   **Neptunia**: Dogoos are slime monsters with dog ears, faces and tails.
-   **NetHack**: The various blobs, jellies, oozes, and such aren't immune to normal damage, since that would make them too difficult, but the black pudding splits into two every time you hit it with a melee weapon, just like the D&D monster of the same name. A well-prepared player can turn this into a near-Game-Breaker. See: Pudding farming.
-   **Nintendo Wars**: In **Advance Wars: Dual Strike**, Ooziums are giant slimes. They're immune to indirect attacks, and instantly kill any unit they attack, simply by moving onto their space and absorbing. The upshot is that they can only move one space a turn, allowing you to surround and destroy them fairly easily; their special attack means they can't counterattack. If you fail to kill it, however, you're going to lose a unit.
-   **Nioh** has the giant Umibozu boss which is seemingly made of seawater surrounding a huge Amurita Core, as well as its smaller variants. Both are vulnerable to fire (which evaporates their water mass) and suffer more damage if struck in their cores. A variation made of (hopefully) mud called "Dorotabo/Mudman" is encountered in the sewers of Edo Castle. All these enemies can spit either part of their masses at the player, or even the weapons/wreckages stuck in their bodies.

-   In **Oozy The Goo Slime Quest**: You play as a green blob with eyes.
-   **Parasite Eve**'s Mitochondria Eve qualifies as this in the first game, not only with her giant slime blob, but in a particular scene of her in the sewer and infecting a wandering crocodile in the process.
-   In **Parasite Eve 2** there are Amoebas which are impervious to any physical attack, drain your MP then fire some energy ball at you, and put some status affect upon you. They are also Demonic Spiders as you may not even notice them until you run into them. The Amoebas are weak to all forms of Aya's Parasite Energy powers, so one cast can quickly end them.
-   **Pikmin**: **Pikmin** in general seems to have this trope as a once-per-game tradition.
    -   **Pikmin (2001)**: The Goolix is made out of water and instantly drowns any non-Blue Pikmin.
    -   **Pikmin 2**: The Waterwraith is a roughly humanoid mass of water moving on a pair of stony rollers.

    -   **Pikmin 4**: A relative of the Goolix called the Foolix appears, which is more aggressive and even Blue Pikmin can't breathe inside it. The Waterwraith also makes a return appearance.
-   Some enemies in **Pizza Tower** are amorphous blobs of cheese with eyes and mouth. This includes cheeseslime, big cheese and the boss The Vigilante.
-   **Pokémon**: Some Pokémon are blob-like in shape; examples include the Grimer family and Ditto, the latter of which is famously capable of breeding with anything.
    -   **Pokémon X and Y** introduces Goomy, which looks like a slimy ball but is a Dragon-type. It then evolves into the slug-like dragon Sliggoo and finally Goodra, a large dragon made of goo. Unlike most examples, these have excellent special defense but low physical defence (for a pseudo-legendary, anyway). Its Hisuian variant trades speed for a large increase in physical defense, and adds Steel-type to it.
    -   **Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon** introduces a non-Pokemon species in the form of Void Shadows, black shapeless blobs who are known to sneak up on unsuspecting expedition teams and snatch away a random member to impersonate them in their place. Not only can they perfectly mimic other Pokemon and their abilities, but they can also copy Mega Evolutions as the boss of one of the last chapters is a Tyranitar in permanent Mega Evolution.
-   **Putty**: The player character is one of these and can absorb both enemies and items by flattening into puddle form and sinking into his mass
-   **Puyo Puyo**: Puyos are blob creatures with eyes that connect with themselves and disappear when four of them combined at once. Puyos come in various colors.
-   **Quake**: Spawns. They are this trope plus Demonic Spiders. Blobs of blue goo, capable of moving ridiculously fast by bouncing around, which makes them extremely dangerous if you let them charge at you. On top of that they're Made of Explodium, detonating with force equal to one of the player's rockets.
-   **Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale** has the same slimes as **Chantelise**, which is set earlier in the same universe, but the different color varieties are not elementally separated but by capabilities, with King Mook Crowned Slime, which only comes in Blue. And there are Purple Slimes.
-   **Remnants of Isolation**: The first enemies that can be encountered, are implied as this, as they're called "Possessed Bloblets".
-   **Resident Evil** has a few of these.
    -   Nyx, a flesh consuming amoeba featured in Outbreak File#2 and Carla/Fake Ada's One-Winged Angel form.

    -   Carla Radames' C-Virus mutation from **Resident Evil 6** gives her a massive, gooey body which she can expand and generate clones of herself.
    -   Globsters from **Resident Evil: Revelations** were once people degenerated into a massive, slug-like pile of rubbery flesh with a grotesque toothed mouth on the underbelly. When fought on land they're pathetically slow and laughably easy to kill, but they become a true nightmare underwater, where they move gracefully and fast and can swallow the playable characters whole if they cannot evade them.
-   **Rex Rocket** has the Terra-Oozlings, which are a species of bio-engineered living blobs of various size that are being transported across the galaxy form Earth in Rex's ship. Unfortunately, they escaped containment and corrupted the ship's computer, which sets off the plot of the game.
-   **RFCK Endless War**: Slimeoids are slime based organisms that can grow naturally or artificially created. While they can take any form, they naturally resort to your standard gooy blob. More intelligent ones have minor abilities to shape shift. Can be grown as pets or hunted in the outskirts.

    -   A much larger slime, Herodotus, serves as the boss of the Land of Darkness. Like its smaller descendants, it splits into two when you reduce its HP to zero, but every time you do this, a Gravisol appears along with them. It takes several of these for Herodotus to be squished, at which point the Boss Room will likely be overrun with enemies.
-   **RuneScape** has the cave slimes and jellies. The former is a poisonous blob of ooze and the latter is a cube of gelatinous material that appears to have items inside of it.
-   **SAR: Search and Rescue** have brown slime blob with eyes as enemies. These abominations appears as a sentient, moving puddle with eyes, and will follow you around until you're close enough, at which point it forms itself into a pillar with claws to attack.

-   **Shadow Force** have the Experimental Amoeba enemy, green blob puddles which lacks weapons of their own, but has the ability to leap all over the screen before attaching themselves to your characters. When it does, it transforms into a green clone of your character and attacks you.

    -   **Shantae (2002)** had a large blob bouncing around followed by smaller blobs.

    -   **Shantae and the Seven Sirens**: The Slime enemy, which changes colors when hit, starting from blue, and always takes the same amount of hits to destroy, no matter how strong those hits are.

-   **Shin Megami Tensei**: A number of games feature Slimes and Blobs, usually as low-level enemies. Some other demons, such as Abaddon, are pretty blob-monsterish too.
    -   Common Shadows in **Persona 3** and **Persona 4** are shapeless splotches of moving darkness with eyes, which pull themselves over surfaces with huge grasping hands (in the latter game, they can also float above-ground). They only reshape themselves into predetermined forms, such as knights or minotaurs or **tanks**, when confronted by a foe. Even then, Mayas (the lowest enemy type) never get any alternate shape.
    -   An alternate design for Slime depict it as the upper half of a skeleton covered in slimes, pitifully trembling and shambling. This design of Slime is meant to be the result of a failed summoning. This Slime is usually the weakest demon in the game.

-   **Slime Rancher** revolves around ranching slimes that are simple blobs of various colors and features. Many bounce around harmlessly, many try to escape or even attack the player.

-   **Solstice: The Quest for the Staff of Demnos**: Featureless slime blobs are one type of enemy. They come in a few different colours, but this does not seem to affect their behaviour.
-   **Sonic Adventure**: Chaos, although his general shape is somehow bound to the number of chaos emeralds he ingested, and his brain is always vulnerable.
-   **Space Quest**:
    -   **Space Quest IV: Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers**: Early on, you encounter a green slime in a sewer. If it touches you, it will attack you and strip the flesh from your bones.
    -   **Space Quest V: The Next Mutation**: After you've ejected a **massive** amount of mutagenic slime out into space, Captain Quirk jettisons out into it and is absorbed into it, creating a gigantic aggressive blob monster.

    -   **Mario Party 4**: The Big Slimes from the **Yoshi's Island** series make an appearance in the minigame Slime Time. Four color-coded Big Slimes trap each one of the four players, and the latter ones' objective is to rapidly run to the checkerboard center while still being glued to the creatures. If a character is too slow while running, they'll be pulled back, forcing them to restart. Whoever makes it to the center will break free and win the minigame; but if nobody manages to get there in 30 seconds, the minigame will end in a draw.
    -   **Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga**: Glurps are green blobs with faces. They're healed by the element they represent and take critical damage from the opposite element.

With every hit, it grows bigger, but during the final hit, the green laser power-up appears and helps out immensely.
-   Moldsmal and its larger cousin Moldbygg from **Undertale** are basically living Jell-O molds. They're described as "curvaceously attractive" and loves some sexy wiggling, though the larger variant is more shy and prefers being left alone.
-   **Ultima** has slimes that, while they can be attacked in the normal ways, a non-lethal attack had a chance of causing a second slime to split off.
-   **The Ultimate Haunted House** has two of these. The main one is one of the monsters in the house, a purple creature with yellow eyes that curses you, and emerges from the kitchen's cooking pot. The second is a "young blob creature" resembling an amoeba, which is an item you can pick up.
-   **Unemployment Quest** has little blue blob monsters referred to as "Doubt".

-   The title goos from **World of Goo**, though they don't absorb or meld together, instead linking together to form structures.

Blob Monster Example in Webcomics

-   Carbosilicate amorphs of **Schlock Mercenary**, of which the title character Sergeant Schlock is one. The only thing more dangerous than a carbosilicate amorph is an amorph with plasma-cannons akimbo. Their biology affords them phenomenal smell, taste, and hearing, near-immunity to directed projectile weapons, Extreme Omnivore capabilities, and a distributed brain that involves memories being stored everywhere, even allowing them to transfer memories by handing around chunks of their own goo; unfortunately, this means all damage is functionally brain damage. They do have eyes, but said eyes aren't part of native amorph biology; they grow on trees. Also, they evolved from quasi-organic data storage devices built by a civilization that imploded 12 million years ago.
-   **Supercrash**, the titular hero starts off his superhero career fighting a blob monster. Then it turns out there's more than one and a precursor to a much greater threat.
-   Synthea was put into a stasis pod, and woken up with experimental biotechnology by a good Mad Scientist far in the future. The result was a green jelly-like body with a confused amnesiac human mind. She can change shape at will, stretching bodyparts, creating mallets, etc., although this is not perfect, as her body drips and oozes constantly — her "at rest" state is a puddle, and she is stuck sleeping in a big barrel. She's also more or less immortal — she has survived being cut into pieces and having an exploding weapon go off INSIDE her head with nothing more than a headache.
-   **Tales Of Gnosis College** has a bonus sequence called **Goo Girl Genesis** which is Exactly What It Says on the Tin. A female undergraduate is turned into one of these as a mad science experiment.
-   **Unicorn Jelly** has a world full of sentient and non-sentient liquid-crystal beings.
-   **Unsounded**: During a storm Sette sees a vision of Starfish who is a slimy blob that seems to be almost melting. It turns out to be a memonic phantom caused by the Selver having recently passed through.
-   Ditto for Myrrh from **The Wotch**, a maid who tried to clean up a pile of magical ingredients (with a pinch of ginger) that her insane Wizard master left out. The mess fought back, and the resultant mass vaguely took on the maid's shape, memories, and personality (with a slightly better body). Originally a bit of fanart from a sub-comic that was made a bit character in the main comic, later became a secondary character, a roommate for Unlucky Everydude Ming.

-   The Shoggoths of the **Monster Girl Encyclopedia** are amorphous blobs that take the form of maids and just like the Shoggoths of the Elder Things, these were made as servants and caretakers and found underground in caves. Unlike most monsters, they have a vibe of purity and are concerned with the well being of the human male they chose to be their master (even trying to make him sleep on her like a bed). Like other monsters, however, it's not a good idea to have sex with them as they will want to literally melt together with their master and become one. After a while, they'll become a beast with no back.
-   **Mortasheen**:
-   **Mystery Flesh Pit National Park** has Macrobacteria, large echinoderms that have evolved certain similarities to bacteria as an adaptation to their environment.
-   **SCP Foundation**:

    -   The SCP-968 ("Tar Baby"). Since its lack of solid parts limits its mobility, trying to freeze it actually makes it **more** dangerous.
    -   SCP-999 ("The Tickle Monster") is a rare benevolent example; the only slime-blob-endorphin monster that is considered Safe and manages to make SCP-682 LAUGH by tickling him. For humans, its slime is powerful enough to cure depression and PTSD just by touching it.
    -   SCP-1361 ("Animal By-Product"). SCP-1361 is a mass of animal tissue that can move along flat surfaces at 1.3 meters per minute. If it touches any biological material it will engulf and absorb it, changing it into more SCP-1361.

They are a liquid-like substance containing human tissue that is intelligent and can move around at up to 80 km/hour. They are capable of Voluntary Shapeshifting, including creating appendages such as tentacles.
    -   SCP-1961 ("Transformation Booth"). Human beings subjected to SCP-1961's effect become amorphous bags of protoplasm that can take any form. Although they don't have normal vital organs (including a brain) they keep their original personality and intelligence.
-   Gorger in **Twig** is a mass of barely mobile human flesh with heavily redundant sensory organs, used by the Academy of Evil to police their labs. When an experiment is set loose, Gorger can position himself to block any escape, even establishing an airtight barrier-and if the escapee can't be killed by Gorger, he's resilient enough that the Academy can move straight to Kill It with Fire to cleanse the area without killing him.
-   More than one student at the Superhero School Whateley Academy in the **Whateley Universe** fits the model but subverts the trope. Aqueous is living water, Plasmoid can't even get out of his room by himself, and Jimmy Trauger is widely regarded across the campus as cannibalistic because he defended himself against a powerful bully by becoming several hundred pounds of carnivorous protoplasm and teaching said bully a valuable lesson. However, none of these kids is a villain **or** a hero, just someone stuck with freaky powers and a freakier body.

    -   **Ben 10: Omniverse** revisits these two alien species with a twist:
        -   One of the main villains from Season 1, Malware, is a failed, twisted-looking Galvanic Mechamorph with yellow lights rather than the traditional green and goes around absorbing things rather than improving them.

For added creepiness, it can change parts of its body into people it has come into contact with, such as forming a person's head to imitate their voice-print, along with a throat and lungs to get the voice right.

-   **M.A.S.K.**: One episode has the heroes facing a giant amoeba-like monster that behaved just like the blob from the 1950s movie.
-   **Matt's Monsters**: Mika, a brownish sludge creature, is one of the three mini-monsters that the protagonists keep as a pet. She's mostly a background character, but once played a crucial part in taking down another blob monster.
-   **My Life as a Teenage Robot**: Jenny has to fight a giant blob creature which was nearly invincible. She got rid of it by freezing it with chemicals and then destroying it.
-   **My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic**: The Smooze from the 1986 movie makes a return in the Season 5 episode "Make New Friends but Keep Discord" when Discord brings him along as a guest to the Grand Galloping Gala. Hilarity Ensues. He's much friendlier in this incarnation, albeit prone to eating all the gems he can get his ooze on.
-   **The Owl House**:
    -   One of the nine magical specializations allowed on the Boiling Isles is the creation of "abominations", vaguely humanoid slime monsters used as servants and foot soldiers. Darius, the head of the Abomination Coven, can even turn himself fully into abomination matter, which he uses both for combat and for transportation.
    -   Emperor Belos's curse acts like this — he has to actively put in effort to maintain his human shape, and if he loses control, he turns into a massive hulking beast made of dark green, necrotic-looking sludge. "King's Tide" really shows his sludge form in action, as he uses his shapeshifting abilities both to conjure up weapons, and to emotionally manipulate Hunter. Unfortunately for him, the fact that he's semi-liquid allows the Collector to flick him into a wall at such high speeds that he just splatters like a water balloon.
-   **The Penguins of Madagascar**: In a moment of mad-scientist weakness, Kowalski accidentally drops radioactive sludge into a box of Gel-O, bringing the cube of gelatin to life and naming it Jiggles. Jiggles desires nothing more than to consume fruit, eventually going berserk from hunger and breaking out of the HQ. The Penguin's attempt to catch Jiggles is messed up by Julien, who gets trapped inside of Jiggles after putting on spray that makes him smell like a fruit. Jiggles is eventually dealt with, but Kowalski can't bring himself to destroy his creation, so Jiggles eventually comes back. This time, instead of growing out of proportion, it splits on impact, threatening a Grey Goo situation with it multiplying out of control.
-   **The Powerpuff Girls (1998)**:
    -   The girls encounter a blob monster who is rampaging through the town, but it turns out that the creature is just a Kindhearted Cat Lover looking for his pet. He leaves after the girls find his cat.
    -   The Amoeba Boys are blue, squishy creatures with no visible legs.
-   **ReBoot**: The Nulls are nonsentient slug-like creatures that are remnants of people destroyed through lost Games. In one episode, a large number of Nulls combine together to form a giant monster called Nullzilla.
-   **Samurai Jack**: The Origins Episode "The Birth of Evil, Part 1" reveals that many eons ago, Aku was originally part of a gigantic, amorphous black blob from outer space which attempted to devour everything in the universe. The gods destroyed the giant blob, however a small fragment was cut off and drifted away to Earth. The blob fragment caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, and proceeded to eat many more unlucky creatures for the next 65 million years, until it eventually evolved into a self-aware being and named itself Aku. Aku can shapeshift and change his mass like a blob monster, but he's also essentially a giant evil tree. His standard form is extremely tall, with "branches" forming his arms and horns, and his movements are rather stiff and accompanied by the sound of wood cracking.
-   **Silver Surfer: The Animated Series** has a two-part episode all about this, featuring amorphous aliens called 'Virals' accidentally born from an unstable cure created by the Watchers. Anyone who entered the Universal Library with selfish intentions or attempted to use the information with such an attitude would eventually mutate as well, operating as a collective with the ability to 'control their evolution'. Only the Surfer himself was immune because his powers are derived from the Power Cosmic of his former master Galactus.
-   **The Simpsons**: Homer Simpson transforms into one of these in ''Treehouse of Horror XVII" after eating some mysterious space goo.
-   **The Spectacular Spider Man**: Sandman, a victim of a Freak Lab Accident that turned him into living sand, after a Big "NO!" and a little well-deserved fretting, very much **enjoys** the results, since Spider-Man's punches have no effect, and he's now capable of rudimentary shapeshifting, weaponry included. It's mentioned in a later episode that he can only eat "raw silicates", and later yet he proves able to change his size by picking up more sand.

-   **Spider-Man Unlimited**: Venom and Carnage. While the symbiotes usually were ooze creatures, Venom and Carnage themselves had upgrades to their powers that put them on par with the T-1000.
-   **Stargate Infinity**: The Sheftu are this and can shapeshift into other people or even objects by touch as well as copying their memories. The only way the gang could deal with them was with how they act.
-   **Static Shock** features a massive acidic blob monster with Combat Tentacles in one episode, which is revealed to actually be a massive mass of microbes that operates as a Hive Mind after being exposed to the Big Bang that gave the meta-humans their powers. There's also the aquatic Aquamaria, though she is much more human in appearance.

-   **SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron**: The cats face off against one (which then divides in two) in their second episode, "The Giant Bacteria". In this case, Dr. Viper made it out of one of the SWAT Kats' other enemies, a multi-eyed pilot named Morbulus, to try and steal a chemical from a laboratory.
-   **Sym-Bionic Titan**: The monster of the week in "Neighbors in Disguise" has the gang fight against a giant goo monster that seems to be defeated at the start but a piece of it manages to spy on them and alert its still-conscious mass to invade their school, turning into red-eyed silhouettes of the heroes to combat them, the heroes themselves having to resort to their new environment to fend them off and the episode ends with it being defeated by the power of mass phone calling due to a weakness in vibrations.
-   **Taz-Mania**: In "The Thing That Ate the Outback", the eponymous Thing is a Blob Monster created by Taz after playing with his home chemistry set.
-   **Teen Titans (2003)** features two of these: Plasmus, who is just a normal guy that becomes a mindless, muck-consuming monster whenever he's awake, and the implacable Madame Rouge.
-   **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)**:
    -   **TMNT: Fast Forward** presented us with the sinister shadow alien, Sh'okanabo.
    -   A superhero variant; an alternate version of Michelangelo called "Blobboid".
-   Thrakkazorg from **The Tick** animated series. Who also made a clone of the hero who was part this.
-   **Tiny Toon Adventures**: "Cinemaniacs!" has a segment, "Superbabs", in which Wex Wuthor (played by Montana Max in the series) puts a blob of ink all over Acme Acres in order to take control of the city. Not only does the blob devour a news anchor reporting on the blob's rampage, but it also nearly devours Buster Bunny, Plucky Duck and Hamton J. Pig (who are all saved by Babs Bunny, in the persona of "Superbabs").
-   **Tom and Jerry Tales**: A shapeshifting blob appears in "Invasion of the Body Slammers", where it assumes the form of a deranged version of Jerry to terrorize Tom, frequently exhibiting a very wide grin.
-   **Totally Spies!** has an interesting spoof of the T-1000 which includes a liquid metal machine that can change into anything it touches. Even as the smallest of drips, it can instantly duplicate one's appearance and size.
-   **True and the Rainbow Kingdom**: The Living Sea is an aquatic, friendly, harmless variation who is very large.

-   **Wakfu**: The Dripples ("Flaqueux" in French) in episode 5. Not so much monsters, though, than cute Peaceful Villagers. There's also an authentic Blob Monster coming out of a broken potion flask in episode 7.

Blob Monster Example in Real Life

-   Many microorganisms, such as amoebas and slime molds, move and feed in the manner of blobs. In particular, **Dictyostelium discoideum** is a slime mold that looks like the typical RPG monster during its reproductive phase — although only a few millimeters wide.
-   White blood cells. In this case, not so much "feeding" as "attacking".
-   Trichoplax qualifies, although it's a rather flat example. It's a multicellular creature with no organs or specialized tissues.
-   Slugs and snails are rather close to being "blob monsters", although they do have solid bodies.
-   Kefir, an unusual dairy product, is cultured from lumps of material containing dozens of species of bacteria and fungi. These lumps are so full of life that they grow constantly, and periodically divide in half, much like tiny blob-monsters.
-   There is a fish called a blobfish. It... well, see for yourself.<small>◊</small> It's a jelly with fins and scales — since its low density lets it float above the seabed it barely needs any muscle. Out of water they end up turning into weird-looking grumpy face things due to pressure differences in and out of the ocean. In a way they're almost Ugly Cute since they tend to fall outside the Uncanny Valley, despite their strange appearance.
-   In water, octopi are very graceful in movement. On a boat or on land, their movement is strangely blobby.
-   Certain sea cucumbers can melt a'la The T-1000 to slip through cracks and then reform as a solid organism.
-   Jellyfish are basically a floating membrane surrounding a couple of primitive organ systems and dozens of tentacles. They don't have much of a shape on land, and are only somewhat better in the water.
-   Averted example: In spite of the names given to it by social media and the press, the sewer blobs in North Carolina that caused a commotion some years ago are not single, shapeless organisms. They are in fact a colony of tubifex worms, which have a tendency to show up in sewers.
-   Sea slugs usually have a definite wormlike form, but every so often something like the yellow plumed slug shows up, and part of the challenge becomes figuring out how the thing is oriented.
