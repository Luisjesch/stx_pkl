Animal Wrongs Group: 
_"Heroic PETA Commandos Kill 49, Save Rabbit"_

Animal rights groups in television shows are frequently portrayed as complete lunatics, often with names that form silly acronyms. In many cases, they don't seem to care how many people get hurt – often by their own actions – as long as animals are okay. Sometimes even animals may be sacrificed for the cause. They're more likely to fight Windmills rather than _actual_ cruelty to animals.

Occasionally subverted, with the animal rights group used as a patsy for the true villains' plot, though the ignoramuses in the front organization usually believe in their own agenda whole-hog while taking the Big Bad's money.

A common role in fiction is to break into the lab of a Mad Scientist and release his genetic aberration or terrible virus or upset his delicate experiments, with catastrophic results. In some cases, this will be accidental or the activists well-meaning but misinformed, but in some, they will know they're releasing a monster, and do it anyway. Expect particularly clueless members of these organizations to react to these beasties (or, indeed, standard dangerous animals such as tigers) with fawning coos and an apparent belief that the animal will somehow recognize them as an Animal Rights activist and not harm them. This belief will inevitably be rewarded with a very painful death moments later. To some extent, Truth in Television: extremist animal rights groups _do_ exist and have committed crimes ranging from the horrific to the merely petty in service of their views.

Compare Soapbox Sadie. See also Free the Frogs for a version set in schools. Most members of an Animal Wrongs Group will be Evil Vegetarians with a Right-Hand Cat to improve their publicity. See Evil Luddite for when they're motivated by a hatred of technology rather than a love of nature. Compare with their cousin tropes, the Eco-Terrorist and Horror Hippies. A subtrope of the more broad Western Terrorists and Animal Lover.

No Real Life Examples, Please!, as this trope would be quite controversial if Real Life tropes were listed.

Animal Wrongs Group Example in 

## Examples:



---
Animal Wrongs Group Example in Anime & Manga

-   The Space Warriors from the **Cowboy Bebop** episode "Gateway Shuffle" **were** once a legitimate environmentalist group but were taken over by a more radical leader. They wanted to save a "rare" Ganymede sea rat and were willing to turn everyone on Ganymede into monkeys to do so (and an orbiting restaurant into little more than bullet holes).
-   A group of protesters in **Highschool of the Dead** believe that **they** are still Human, and that the government is committing murder every time they kill **them** off. They also believe the government is responsible for turning **them** in the first place. One of the main character's rich parents were using their estate as a safe haven and refuge zone, where the protesters set up tents. Eventually, though, even the estate's defenses were broken through and it was overrun. The other civilians listened to instructions on how to escape, while the leader of the protesters stayed behind and tried to reason with **them**. It was only when they finally knock her over and start biting her that she reaches for a nearby machete to fight back, but it was already too late.
-   **Nyaruko: Crawling with Love!** has Space Tindalos, which appears in the second season and is entirely Played for Laughs. They actually steal an Artifact of Doom so they can **create** an endangered species to protect — a Lawyer-Friendly Cameo of the Oozaru (giant Saiyan ape) from **Dragon Ball Z**, which casually kicks the group members into a pile of rubble immediately after being created.
-   **Pokémon Adventures**:
    -   The Kanto Elite Four in the **Yellow** chapter in planned on committing genocide in hopes of creating a Pokémon paradise. Ironically, Lance didn't even notice how much pain his Dragonite was in after it waited in lava for who knows how long while setting an ambush. Or how many Pokémon he and his group had injured/killed in the process.
    -   The **Black and White** chapter involves Team Plasma, which was already an Animal Wrongs Group in the games. **Black 2 and White 2** also has a former Team Plasma member as one of the protagonists, and while she's no longer active in "Pokémon liberation" since the group broke up, she still believes in its ideals, viewing things like Pokéballs and Pokédexes as tools of enslavement (but keeping such views to herself). It's implied that her extremist beliefs are due to being indoctrinated in the group's rhetoric at an early age (she was in Team Plasma at age 10 and the story is set when she's 12) and hasn't completely thought through the implications yet.

Animal Wrongs Group Example in Comedy

-   Discussed by Greg Proops in one of his **Comedy Central Presents** specials:
    
    "Oh, let me step over this **disgusting homeless person** to pet this cute little kitty!"
    
-   Chris Rock also made mention to the plight of how people prefer animals to humans by explaining how if an average person sees a homeless man carrying a dog, people will make a fuss about feeding the **dog**.

Animal Wrongs Group Example in Comic Books

-   Subverted in Grant Morrison's run on **Animal Man**. Although Buddy Baker devotes his career to collaborating with like-minded individuals in disrupting fox hunts and freeing laboratory animals, he himself avoids the use of violence (except against a whaler and dolphin-hunter who dared him to do so). When one of his collaborators on a lab rescue mission blows it up with an incendiary bomb, killing a firefighter in the process, Buddy hangs up his costume and resigns from the Justice League. Conversely, Animal Man's big-business enemies, far from being the put-upon victims normally found in this trope, are **far** more brutal and lawless.
-   **The Authority** is associated with a British secret service named 'Kev', a focus of a few comic books. Kev's buddy from his squad abandoned his post with a tame tiger instead of shooting it on orders. Later, both are implicated in the murder of a Japanese whaler.
-   Batman has Ra's al Ghul, who, in the comics and animated series based on them, has tried multiple times to wipe out more than eighty percent of Earth's population, because it would allegedly return Earth to a more stable ecosystem. However, the moments at which he really shows his Animal Wrongs side are when dealing with the menagerie of endangered animals he collects and keeps. In one comic in particular, he was shown to have had a henchman murdered because he accidentally killed a rare sort of tiger cub by feeding it chocolate, dooming its species to extinction according to Ra's. His daughter Talia al Ghul also shares his environmentalist goals, but it's usually less genocidal than him. At one point her alliance with Lex Luthor started to fall apart due to all the environmental crimes LexCorp committed.
-   In one issue of **Batman: The Brave and the Bold** (as in the original comics), Aquaman once spotted a diver spearing a whale. In a fit of rage, he struck him, and as is to be expected with a guy with Super-Strength, killed him. Turns out he was a marine scientist tagging the whale for research purposes. Whoops. The incident was used by his evil half-brother to spur a full-on Heroic Breakdown (Batman later snapped Aquaman out of it by claiming that the scientist was still alive and the whole thing was faked by Ocean Master, but this may or may not have been true).
-   Downplayed in **Catwoman** vol. 2 #6. Selina is working with the "Friends of the Earth Nature Magic Alliance" to prevent an ecological disaster. She sees them as "a pretty level headed bunch", although when one of them shows slight signs of this, she privately reflects that "animal rights activists fantasising about killing makes about as much sense as 'right to life' murders".
-   **Goddess** by Garth Ennis. The supporting character Mudhawk stops a fox hunt by shooting all the hunters with a high-powered machine gun. The horses and dogs were unhurt. Later, he takes the opportunity to obliterate a whaling ship simply because he could.
-   **Judge Dredd**: One strip from the early 90s featured a trio of armed animal rights activists demanding that all the zoo animals be released. They then climbed into the pit of a man-eating bear/kangaroo-like alien creature to free it. Dredd arrested the only survivor for public nuisance and animal endangerment and would have added idiocy to his rap sheet if it weren't legal.
-   The 17th issue of **Cartoon Network Action Pack** had a **Samurai Jack** story where Jack was tricked into freeing a bunch of vicious beasts by a trio of animal rights activists so that the creatures would end up killing everyone in the city, as the beasts were caged so that they wouldn't endanger anyone. In the end, Jack slays all the beasts and has the three locked up in the cage used to imprison the animals.
    
    **Activist:** Those poor beautiful monsters!
    
    **Jack:** No, they were pitiful. You are the monsters.
    
-   In the first **Venom** volume, a SHIELD soldier standing guard over the Venom symbiote asks a coworker who in their right mind would let Eddie Brock and Mac Gargan remain bonded to it while in jail. His co-worker's answer? PETA.
-   Wonder Girl had to deal with an animal rights group who thought that **hydras** were nice friendly critters.

Animal Wrongs Group Example in Comic Strips

-   In **Bloom County**:
    -   Opus the penguin failed to find his mother due to an Uzi-toting animal rights group breaking into the animal testing lab that he broke into, kidnapping him, and then leaving him in the ice-cooler of a 7-11 because "they're on a bit of a shoe-string budget-wise."
    -   On another occasion, he mistook Greenpeace's **Rainbow Warrior** for an Antarctic-bound cruise ship with neighbor, septuagenarian, and "fellow environmental extremist" Mrs. Limekiller.
-   German caricaturist Markus once drew one of them protesting the slaying of dragons — on stage during a Richard Wagner opera.
-   Parodied in the German comic **Rudi** with a group which protests the inhumane killing of **vegetables**.

Animal Wrongs Group Example in Fan Works

-   In **Harry's Little Black Notebook** a member of a group called Seal Guardians who happens to share Harry's subway car the summer before first year grabs Hedwig's cage and attempts to set her free while making a grandiose speech. She pecks him for his trouble, then flies off and lands on Harry's shoulder.
-   This trope was the spark that lit things off in the **Daria/Legion of Super-Heroes** series **Legion of Lawndale Heroes**, as three members of such a group snuck into a research lab to free the research animals (all of whom had been granted super-powers due to the efforts of the Corrupt Corporate Executive who owns the place, on behalf of one major group involved in an Ancient Conspiracy to keep up The Masquerade). Not only did they die for their troubles (as only the smaller animals were able to escape before the place went into lockdown, but the larger animals saw them as prey), but their corpses ended up as specimens for experiments, their efforts only ended up making the lab add on much tighter security... and their actions started off a Mass Super-Empowering Event.
-   In **Puppy Arc**, Jaune (who has a werewolf-like curse that transforms him into a puppy) and Zwei encounter E.T.P.A. (The Ethical Treatment of Pets and Animals organization), who claim to support all animal rights, but also (not so) secretly euthanize 90% of the animals they rescue.
-   In **Soul Eater Zeta**, there is a "Demon Weapons Wrong Group" known as The Zeta. They believe that Demon Weapons are being mistreated and are basically glorified servants to Meisters. Only when they are separated from Meisters can either of them realize their true potential as individuals.
-   **Beast Boy and Raven Join PETA** is largely a satire condemning the Animal Liberation Front and PETA, portraying both groups as willing to kill animals and commit crimes to get their message across.

Animal Wrongs Group Example in Films — Live-Action

-   **12 Monkeys** features a post-apocalyptic world in which a plague has wiped out most of humanity and forced the survivors to live underground. New York City is filled with zoo animals and graffiti of twelve monkeys stating "We Did It." It's discovered that this is the insignia of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, an animal liberation group headed by the insane son of a virologist. It turns out that the Twelve Monkeys are a complete red herring. It's purely coincidental that they scheduled a mass zoo liberation around the same time as the outbreak. Their leader and his father had no part in leaking the plague. Another virologist working at the same institute spread the virus for his own deranged reasons.
-   Animal rights activists are responsible for starting the pseudo-zombie plague in **28 Days Later**, as they forcibly release infected test animals despite the scientist observing them directly stating that the animals are both infected and highly contagious.
-   In the backstory of **Avatar**, it is revealed that PETA was indirectly responsible for the RDA getting mining rights on Pandora. Given how RDA abuses that right during the film, this would make PETA an Unwitting Instigator of Doom.
-   In the film **Black Sheep (2007)**, the mutated sheep are released by one member of such a group. This may have had less to do with his loving sheep and more to do with his, ah, **loving** sheep.
-   The 'Real Animal League' in **Blooded**, which kidnaps five young deer hunters and then hunts them.
-   **Cemetery Gates**: After breaking into a laboratory facility in order to free the animals kept there for experiments, two environmental activists unleash a giant genetically mutated Tasmanian devil from its cage.
-   The four jewel thieves of **Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back** pretend to be crazy animal rights activists in order to provide cover and patsies for a diamond heist. Oddly, the script puts the animal testing lab in Boulder, CO, which is home to many **real** animal rights groups.
-   Subverted in **Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom**. Owen and Claire are made to seem like this in the trailers, but it's shown that they're well aware of the threat that dinosaurs pose and don't want to risk human lives saving them. In the climax, Clare is ultimately unable to bring herself to free them on the mainland to save them from death by hydrogen sulfide poisoning...so Maisie frees them instead.
-   The "heroes" of **The Lost World: Jurassic Park** fit this trope to a T<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>. Releasing dangerous animals en masse, nearly getting trampled by them as a result, and getting numerous people killed. Getting too close to wild animals, activating their territorial instincts, and just generally failing every rule for how to treat wild animals like they're going down a checklist. Acting as though people taking these unnatural genetically engineered dinosaurs out of their "natural" habitat is some kind of crime against nature, even though they don't naturally exist anymore in the first place and would wreck any ecosystem they were introduced to (how many normal animals did you see left alive on that island?). Unloading the gun that was going to be used to defend the humans from the rampaging T-Rex.
-   The protagonist of the horror movie **Man's Best Friend** is one of these. Against the wishes of her boyfriend, who tries to talk her out of it, she breaks into a legitimate scientist's lab and steals the titular genetically engineered killing machine in the shape of a dog, which goes on a bloody rampage.
-   In **Tremors 3: Back to Perfection**, the hero is told that he's no longer allowed to hunt graboids, a dangerous earthworm-like beastie, because they made the Endangered species list, and gets chewed out by the suit who tells him this. Not long thereafter, the suit also gets chewed out. By said beastie in its Shrieker stage. Burt later turns this ruling to his advantage, because if graboids are endangered wildlife, then the valley they live in is an endangered wildlife habitat, which means that developers can't tear his hometown down and turn it into neighborhoods of fancy houses.
-   **Pacific Rim**: Though they don't appear in the movie itself, Word of God confirmed that the Kaiju had fringe animal rights fanatics pop up who protested the Jaeger fights as cruelty to animals and felt that the Kaiju had a place in the world despite going out of their way to attack human population centers. It's not touched on what happened to them when it was revealed that Kaiju were interdimensional bioweapons made by genocidal conquerers, but it certainly ripped their excuses away.

Animal Wrongs Group Example in Literature

-   In Alex Rider novel **Ark Angel**, we have "Force Three", a group that bombs car plants and threatens businessman Nikolia Drevin because the title space hotel he launched made native birds of the island extinct. Subverted when we learn that Nikola had been arranging the attacks so he could crash the space hotel into Washington D.C. to eliminate evidence of his criminal dealings.
-   Downplayed in **Animorphs**: Cassie, a Friend to All Living Things who helps her parents run a wildlife clinic, is often teased by her friends about being one ("Save the whales! Hug trees! Let dogs vote!") or becoming a Crazy Cat Lady for all living creatures, but she certainly doesn't put the lives of her friends above animals (and was annoyed that they would think that, when they had a choice to eat a recently-killed seal or starve to death in the Arctic). It's also noted that she has no problem with animal testing for medical reasons.
    -   Helped by her parents both being vets who deal mostly with Wildlife (her father runs an animal hospital out of the family barn devoted to rehabilitating injured animals so they could survive in the wild, while her mother is the head vet at the local zoo). The closest Cassie comes to in so far as any question of animals rights is openly wondering if their use of animal morphs was no different than the Yeerks use of their hosts. This question is given some fair consideration by the team. While Cassie was often seen as the one most likely to let her more political beliefs drive her actions, all her flawed decisions were made concerning the team's safety, never animal safety.
-   In Susan Conant's **Bloodlines**, a young woman who's been listening to an Animal Wrongs Group's propaganda steals the protagonist's beloved Alaskan malamute, Rowdy, at a dog show and turns him loose. Luckily, she does so **inside** the building, and Rowdy is recovered safely. The protagonist's terror that he might have been set free outside — right next to a busy highway — is very potent until then, however, and she later chews the girl out six ways from Sunday for putting him in danger, at one point asking her why she isn't running around setting peoples' CHILDREN loose in the woods?
-   In the short story **Carnal Knowledge**, by T.C. Boyle, the main character, Jim, is a man who loved eating meat until he met Alena, a beautiful vegan animal rights activist. Jim is so smitten with Alena, and with the hope of sleeping with her, that he takes up vegetarianism and even helps her protest, which comes in the form of harassing the meat section of a local grocery store and picketing a red carpet event, the latter which gets Jim beaten up by the bodyguard of a celebrity he smeared red paint on for wearing a fur coat. However, the biggest act they commited was when they and several other activists go to a turkey farm and open the pens in the middle of the night setting hundreds of turkeys on the loose, and which causes Jim to get separated from the group in the confusion. When they meet up the following morning, Jim realizes that Alana isn't interested in him the same way he's interested in her and decides to cut his loses when she gets back from her retreat with the other members of the group, including a guy it's heavily implied that she has a crush on. When he makes the drive home from the nearby town where the turkey farm is located, he notices that the highway has been shut down due to a pile up that was caused by a tractor trailer tipping over after running over a flock of turkeys.
-   The CHERUB Series novel **Man vs Beast** features the Zebra Alliance, Animal Freedom Militia, and Animal Freedom Army. The Zebra Alliance was a group that would rescue animals until the leader, Ryan Quinn, was arrested turning the group into a protest group. The Animal Freedom Militia is a more violent group that would assault members of Animals Testing Companies threatening to kill them unless they quit. A spin-off group of them, the Animal Freedom Army, proves to be even more violent when they burn down a facility, bomb an executive's car, and plan to force feed a celebrity chef drain cleaner on live television.
-   **Cirque Du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant** gives us R.V., a hippie who buys so much into animal liberation that he tries to free a **wolf-man** from his cage. The wolf-man thanks him by biting his arms off at the elbow. In R.V.'s defense, it's hinted that he's on shrooms at the time.
-   **Confessions**: The Manichees would be happy to kill a man for eating a fig, since eating the fruit would kill the part of God they thought lived inside the fig. Of course, they were rarely courageous and dedicated enough to carry out these radical beliefs, but they at least got there in principle.
-   Woggle in Ben Elton's **Dead Famous** is one of these, to the extent that he believes disease-spreading vermin — such as fleas and lice — are unfairly put-upon. Although he torments the other members of the **Big Brother**\-style show he's put on with his loathsome self-righteousness and horrific concept of hygiene, the producers are able to make him the audience's favourite by selectively editing footage so that the other housemates come off as even worse than him (which admittedly isn't that hard, since they're a pretty horrible bunch, to begin with). When — against the housemates' expectations — he **isn't** immediately voted out, they immediately clock what's happening and demand that the producers get rid of him; otherwise they'll walk out, ruining the show. So the producers release evidence they have that Woggle took part in an anti-hunt demonstration in which he savagely beat a 15-year-old girl and left her with brain damage, and the police promptly come a-calling for Woggle.
-   The Society of the Evening Star from the **Fablehaven** series cite a supernatural variant of this ideology as their motive, at least when they can be bothered to take a break from Xanatos Speed Chess and explain their actions. They claim that all magical creatures should be free, and they accordingly oppose the existing system by which dangerous entities like demons are confined to Fantastic Nature Reserves and Tailor Made Prisons. On the other hand, their leader appears to be something of a Straw Hypocrite. Predicting that the current system of Sealed Evil in a Can won't last forever, he wants to be in control of the inevitable escape when it happens — and he **will** be around to see it happen, being immortal and all. After the demons get imprisoned again in the final book, this leader is saddled with an ironic role in keeping them sealed. The demons can only escape if the Eternals, five humans who volunteered to secure the prison in exchange for agelessness, are all tracked down and killed through special magic. The first Eternal chosen for the new prison is the Society's former leader, who offers to take up the role in place of whatever other punishment he might receive. This means he can never achieve his goal while he's alive.
-   **Fate of the Jedi** has a **droid** wrongs group in it. As does the Holonet News site with the headline "Droid Rights Activists Decry Brilliant Missiles". Unfortunately for this group, the Mechanical Liberation Front, they accidentally release these brilliant missiles, killing themselves and clearing a 25-kilometer square area around the plant.
-   A religiously-motivated Beetle Maniac Sk'rrr called Vroon in **Galaxy of Fear: The Swarm** makes it his mission to kill the animals that eat drog beetles in the spacestation garden he tends to, in the name of protecting the sacred bugs. As drog beetles are **carnivores** that multiply at an insanely rapid pace, and grow more aggressive the more of them are present, this backfires spectacularly.
-   **Godzilla**: In the novel **Godzilla Returns**, people react in various ways to Godzilla's resurfacing in 1998. It's offhandedly mentioned that Greenpeace reacted by trying to have him declared an endangered species and given protected status, completely ignoring the death toll caused by the creature during its first attack in 1954 and since its recent return.
-   **Harry Potter**:
    -   Hagrid arguably falls under this trope. He is unable to accept that the vicious monsters he likes are not really just friendly, misunderstood animals but are, in fact, vicious monsters. While he doesn't actively campaign for them, he does regularly break the law and put children, himself, and anyone nearby in serious danger, and is very lucky no one has ever died due to his actions.
    -   Hermione could also fit a milder form with SPEW (Society for the Promotion of Elvish Welfare). She is determined to free house elves no matter what, to the point of trying to trick them into being free (by hiding clothes in piles of rubbish — house elves are freed if they're given clothes), even though they really don't want it. At the point SPEW was formed, the only house elves Hermione has met had been abused by their masters; once she learns that there are house elves who are treated well and enjoy being part of the family, she backs off a bit, shifting the organization's purpose to giving them better working conditions and only freeing abused ones. This is not an exact example as they aren't really animals, but sapients similar to humans (making it more "Happiness in Slavery" for most of them).
-   S. M. Stirling's **Island in the Sea of Time** also features animal rights folks becoming traitors, in the form of Pamela Lisketter and her followers, who aid Walker in part because they realize that the new Nantucket government isn't going to promote veganism or discourage hunting anytime soon.
-   **Joe Pickett**: Klamath Moore's anti-hunting group in **Blood Trail**, which implicitly advocates the murder of hunters.
-   The Mercedes Lackey short story "Last Rights" features Animal Liberation activists wanting to free the re-created dinosaurs from an experimental park. One discovered that an apatosaurus that doesn't notice you can squash you good, another that dromaeosaurs are not your new friend, and the sole survivor that triceratopses are bad-tempered, territorial, and surprisingly fast — but fortunately, can't climb trees.
-   Much of the tension in Chuck Palahniuk's **Lullaby** revolves around whether animal rights fanatic Oyster will acquire power over life and death.
-   The terrorist group that the protagonist of Clive King's **Me and My Million** runs into are intending to bomb the Reptile House at London Zoo to free the snakes — though it's clear that at least some of the members don't care for the snakes in the least, and just want to cause chaos.
-   **The Newest Plutarch** featured Avalokiteshvara-Chkhandogiya Ramadas, a philosopher who averted the usual concentration on cuter creatures by defending the rights of parasites.
-   **Oryx and Crake** mentions an incidence of a fanatic animal rights group breaking into a chicken factory to liberate the inhabitants. This is seen as hilarious by everyone since the "chickens" in question are actually ChickieNobs, a highly genetically engineered form of chicken that lacks a brain or indeed a central nervous system and, as one character notes, "can't even walk", since they haven't got legs.
-   **Sword of Truth**: Darken Rahl could get like this, depending on his mood. According to Cara, while he was a vegetarian and considered eating meat to be wrong, he **usually** didn't have a problem with people in the People's Palace selling or eating meat. But every once in a while, he would snap and brutally murder such a person while sobbingly asking how someone could be so cruel to animals. In one case, such a "punishment" consisted of beheading a man's horse, gutting it, and jamming his head in the open wound, letting him drown in the guts.
-   S. M. Stirling wrote the **T2 Trilogy**, a trilogy of sequels to the first two **Terminator** films in which Skynet's plans to destroy humanity are knowingly aided and abetted by a group of self-identified "Luddites", willfully blind to the fact that they are serving a machine which has no particular use for the natural ecosystem and might well destroy it as inconvenient after it triumphs.
-   Played with in **Wicked**, where the protagonist joins a revolutionary group working for the rights of Oz's Talking Animals. Their ultimate goal? Kill the Wizard. They are, for the most part, in the right, and the Wizard really is a bastard. The animals they're defending are in danger of being treated as ordinary animals, which they object to. With their voices. The ones normal animals don't have.

Animal Wrongs Group Example in Live-Action TV

-   Played for laughs in an episode of **3rd Rock from the Sun**, when Dick accidentally hits a **chipmunk** with his car. He is so distraught that he becomes a complete environmentalist nut. Among other things, he makes Sally throw out all of her leather shoes and tries to free the lobsters at a fancy restaurant. In the end, he releases the chipmunk back into the wild. He hits and kills an endangered peregrine falcon with a rock to prevent it from eating his chipmunk.
-   The Animal Liberation Fighters from **The Adventures of Shirley Holmes** episode "The Case of the Liberated Beasts." The group was described as being relatively harmless up until it was taken over by an extremist whose mental illness—exacerbated by the poison of a Komodo dragon that had bitten him while he while he was stealing it—caused him to start living out a Noah's Story Arc.
-   One episode of **Ashes to Ashes (2008)** features an animal rights extremist who isn't beyond throwing a firebomb at a twelve-year-old.
-   An episode of **Bergerac** almost seems even-handed in comparison. Three activists release a bunch of plague-carrying monkeys, but the only people infected are themselves, one (who was dating Bergerac's daughter) died, and another has enough sense to turn himself in and get treatment. The group's leader is slightly more extreme but still non-violent and surrenders because the police threaten to shoot a dog if she doesn't. (Makes sense in context...)
-   A storyline in **Between the Lines (1992)** had an animal rights group planting bombs, unaware that they were being manipulated by a competitor of their main target. It ends in a murder-suicide with a big bomb.
-   In **Castle**, a victim owned a male body-products company which was coming under fire from animal rights activists, and the crime scene contains the word 'murderer' written in the victim's blood on a mirror. Subverted; most of the activists are just 'average everyday tree-hugging vegetarians', the 'violent' one they get in as a suspect comes off as just being an otherwise ordinary guy (albeit one with a fondness for attacking the property and people he was protesting against with fake blood) and it turns out he didn't do it anyway, the suspect having a concrete alibi, and the actual murderer having staged the crime scene to throw the police on the wrong scent.
-   **CASUAL+Y** has a long history of presenting animal rights groups as terrorists, who blow up laboratories, people who work in laboratories, the children of people who work in laboratories... One season premiere involving a bomb on a bus was originally going to have Islamic militants as the villains, but it was changed to animal rights people because they were worried about offending Islamic militants. They were actually on their way to blow up something relevant, but the bomb went off prematurely.
-   **The Chaser's War On Everything** parodies this when Andrew and Julian pose as anti-fur activists — at Taronga Zoo, yelling slogans at **the animals**. "Some leopard died for you to wear that leopard skin!"
-   **Crank Yankers** features this in one episode. Their protest signs in the background change every time they're shown, starting with "If It's Furry, Let It Scurry" and ends with "Kill Whitey".
-   Not apparently part of a group, but one culprit in the **CSI: NY** episode "A Daze of Wine and Roaches" killed a man to save the life of a **cockroach**.
-   One episode of **Dead Like Me** has a group of clueless activists chain themselves to the cage of a bear used as a roadside attraction in order to raise awareness of the mistreatment. The bear manages to snag the chain and ends up killing them all since they couldn't get away. Later, another group of activists does the same thing.
-   In **Degrassi Junior High**, Spike's best friend Liz is this, having an intense hatred for Spike's good friend Caitlin because she takes a medication that was tested on monkeys to treat her seizures.
-   In **Dollhouse**, Caroline Farrell (who will become Echo) first comes to the notice of Rossum Corporation (the people working closely with the Dollhouse) when she breaks into one of their labs to record the mistreatment of experimental animals there. When her boyfriend points out numerous fetuses in jars and evidence that human experimentation is occurring, she merely scowls and goes back to fawning over the monkeys.
-   Damian Day goads a group of peaceful activists into raiding a beagle farm on **Drop the Dead Donkey**. It ends badly... for Damian; Gus and Alex realize there's something going down and rearrange the raid to go to a farm that breeds rottweilers for experimentation.
-   In the **Elementary** episode "Rekt in Real Life", one of the suspects is Rayna Carno of the Animal Salvation Fund, who threatened the target for promoting seal-hunting. Sherlock considers her a "fanatic", and she initially believes she's been called in to discuss the "equine slavery" of the NYPD Mounted Division. While undoubtedly flaky, she turns out to be amenable to compromise, agreeing that she'll lay off hunting by the Inuit population if they speak up against commercial hunters. The actual murderer turns out to be her lawyer who was using the group to undermine the Inuits and force them off their land.
-   An Animal Wrongs Group frees a genetically engineered monster in the **Fringe** episode "Unleashed".
-   Subverted on **Haven** with Jess Minion, Nathan's season one Love Interest. She comes under suspicion for the murder of a man killed at a hunting club, as they have an acrimonious relationship, and is mention specifically as being one of "those animal rights and wrongs people." Eventually it comes out that she's just opposed to shooting for sport. She thinks killing for food is okay, and even takes down a deer to prepare for her first date with Nathan.
-   Basically Jim Carrey's character combined with a Soapbox Sadie in this **In Living Color!** sketch.
-   **Jonathan Creek** had an episode in which a man was killed by a long-distance animal activist who sent him a self-addressed envelope with a poisoned flap.
-   The **L.A. Law** episode "The Unsterile Cuckoo" had Victor representing Randall Furriers, Inc., suing the Save the Animals Foundation for splashing "blood" (actually a dye, their founder explains) on models wearing his coats at fashion shows, and slashing at the coats with razor blades, causing more than a million dollars in damage. At one point in the trial, a member of the group splashes Victor with a bucket of "blood" in a courthouse hallway, shouting "You defend murderers!" Their founder is depicted as someone who cares about animals more than people.
-   **Last Man Standing** has a first season episode "Animal Wrongs," where one of Mandy's boyfriends belongs to a group "**P**eople **H**elping **A**nimal **R**ights **T**oday", pronounced "PART", the "H" is silent (but deadly). Turns out he was only dating Mandy to get into the Outdoorman Store to deface a stuffed grizzly bear that (unbeknownst to him, but knownst to us) was killed over 100 years ago by Teddy Roosevelt. As punishment, he is made to dress up as Roosevelt and show how Roosevelt was actually a great conservationist.
-   In an episode of **Las Vegas**, such a group steals a truckload of lobsters from the Montecito to prevent their "murder", hiding them in a shark aquarium. The ringleader is caught, brought front and center, hinted that he was about to become a meat eater, told he endangered the sharks by introducing unchecked foreign contaminants into the water, and to twist the knife further, Ed and another casino manager retaliate by organizing an All-You-Can-Eat lobster buffet.
-   This is invoked to cover up the murder of a scientist in the **Law & Order** episode "Animal Instinct." As the scientist is involved with animal testing, the murderer makes it appear that radical animal rights activists killed her, spraying graffiti to this effect. However, the police see through it fairly quickly and zero in on the real culprit.
-   In the German series **Lindenstraße**, Julia von der Marwitz dies from rabies — which she caught from a cat she had "liberated" from a research lab.
-   **The Mentalist**: An animal rights group is suspected of murdering a professor who is a part of an experiment that tests on animals. It turns out they weren't the culprit either, but the audience learns earlier that the experiment is inhumane for both animals and humans.
-   **Monster Warriors** had an episode that dealt with a group of people protesting them fighting and destroying the monsters, with the leaders of the group being the parents of one of the warriors. Needless to say, they changed their tune when the monsters attacked them (although a few still complain about it during the attack).
-   An **NCIS** episode had a whale rights activist try to kill a submarine crew because he believed the SONAR they used was hurting the marine life. They do make it clear, though, that he has no connection to the protesters outside the base, whose biggest threat was being inconvenient.
-   **NUMB3RS** had one of these, who accidentally killed a professor (when his partner learned of it later, he was appalled). It turned out that he was schizophrenic and thought animals had greater "spirits" than humans; he acted independently from the main animal rights group.
-   Subverted in Episode 3 of Series 2 (Episode 2.3) of **Primeval**, as it isn't really an Animal Wrongs **Group**, **per se**, but rather a solitary individual fighting against a group to protect what she views as the rights of her pet (prehistoric) animal. A woman named Valerie Irwin finds a **Smilodon** cub in her garage several years before the episode is set and raises it to adulthood. Later, the ARC team are alerted to the existence of the **Smilodon** after the occurrence of several incidents involving it at an amusement park. They investigate and suspect that someone is harboring the cat. When Valerie is confronted and asked to hand over the cat to the ARC (after she had previously sicced the cat on Nick in an attempt to get it to kill him), she accuses him and the ARC of "creating him in some kind of horrible genetic experiment" and wanting to take him away and make him suffer. When Cutter points out that the cat may kill her as well, she retorts "He would never hurt me", convinced that the **Smilodon** views her as a mother figure since she cared for it for so long and would never attack her (Valerie apparently either forgetting or being completely unfazed by the fact that the **Smilodon** had slaughtered her boyfriend several years beforehand). Cue Karmic Death, as the **Smilodon** pounces on Valerie and savages her with its elongated canines, ending her life.
-   **Probe**'s "Metamorphic Anthropoidic Prototype Over You": An animal rights group attempts to free Josephine, an ape that Dr Deanna Hardwick had done been doing unethical experiments on. Ironically, when they release her from the pound, she locks them in her cell before making her escape.
-   Subverted in an episode of **Psych** titled, appropriately, "Meat is Murder, but Murder is also Murder." Turns out it wasn't the vegetarian vigilantes at all, just an ambitious assistant who wanted the dead man's job.
-   While Darlene of **Roseanne** has a personality that is a mix of goth, a tomboy and a Granola Girl, she ends up being this after she and David made chalk outlines of cows outside of Roseannne's restaurant (which at the time was the only thing keeping the family afloat financially). Her punishment was to be a server of the food at a fair where she proceeds to routinely insult her mother and coworkers and try to stop customers from eating meat.
-   In the first episode of **Saxondale**, Tommy encounters a pack of these types protesting his clearing a factory of its pigeon infestation. One of them is a bit unhinged and cuts his arm with a large knife. Tommy notes that he is 'now legally entitled to use reasonable force in a proportional response.'
    
    **Protester**: What's that meant to mean?
    
    **Tommy**: Just **that**, I suppose. Anyone else want to ask what that means? **\[Not entirely surprisingly, they don't\]**
    
-   One episode of **Spooks** involved an animal rights group who instigated a bombing campaign against vivisectionists that made Al Qaeda look like a cheerleading squad.
-   Parodied by **That Mitchell and Webb Look** with a human rights activist who explains that his chosen method of raising awareness about cruelty to humans is inflicting it on animals, since the reverse approach seems so popular.
-   **Tremors: The Series**: An episode has an animal rights group trying to get Graboids declared an endangered species and the Perfection Valley residents' co-existence with the albino Graboid El Blanco as dangerous to its health. The group's leader wasn't above non-fatally poisoning El Blanco to give them an artificial smoking gun, but upon her actions being revealed, the rest of the group leaves in disgust. This episode gets funny when you realize that:
    1.  El Blanco is **already** a protected species (as of movie 3);
    2.  It's known to be sterile, meaning its **individual** survival contributes nothing to the long-term preservation of its species; and
    3.  The residents of Perfection have ended up protecting the Graboid from harm a few times (when it's not saving them by attacking the Monster of the Week).
-   Subverted in a third-season episode of **Veronica Mars**. She suspects a group of committing a crime but finds out they're generally pretty good people. She also tricks a someone into wearing a shirt saying "Meat is Murder".
-   **Whale Wars** focuses on a real-life group, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, whose ships forcefully intervene with Japanese and Faroese whaling and bluefin tuna fishing. They have been charged with piracy as a result of ramming or sabotaging whaling ships, though not (so far) convicted.
-   This was done in Monster of the Week episodes of **The X-Files** before the Myth Arc grew big enough.
    -   Main example in "Darkness Falls", which ironically won an award from the EMA because of its "environmentalist message". The monster of the episode is a species of photosensitive tree mites capable of swarming and killing a score of humans that were released from hibernation by loggers illegally cutting down old-growth trees. A militant group of environmentalists was fighting them with sabotage tactics, including putting sugar in all of the vehicles' engines. This means they can't escape the bugs. One we see is himself killed by them trying to escape.
    -   In "Fearful Symmetry", the WAO (Wild Again Organization) is suspected of releasing an elephant from a zoo whose cages are too small to make the animals comfortable. It turns out that it wasn't their fault. Later, when one of the WAO members breaks into the zoo with a camera to try to gather evidence of animal abuse and force the government to shut the place down, a tiger is teleported out of its cage, made invisible by the aliens, and kills him.

Animal Wrongs Group Example in Music

-   Aqua's music video for their song "We Belong to the Sea" pokes fun at this trope... Lene grabs a goldfish in a bowl and runs from pursuers for the entire video, until the end where she successfully flings it into the sea. Never mind that goldfish are freshwater fish, the video ends with a shark's fin cruising across the ocean!
-   Exaggerated in "Carrot Juice Is Murder" by The Arrogant Worms, in which the protagonist is part of a **vegetable** wrongs group and is proud of killing people for eating vegetables.

---
Animal Wrongs Group Example in Tabletop Games

-   **Aberrant**: Greenwar is the nightmarish result of answering the question "what happens if you let one of these groups have access to super-powered agents?". One of their most notorious signature "tricks" is using a telepathic member to Mind Rape a target of their ire by imprinting the mind of a tortured/dying animal over their own. Whether this leads to the victim undergoing a change of heart or a homicidal mental breakdown is no concern to them. That said, they're perfectly okay with just straight-up murdering "oppressors".
-   **Dungeons & Dragons**:
    -   **Eberron**: The Ashbound, overlapping with Well-Intentioned Extremist. These are people who believe anything other than living in a cave is inherently evil. Because one of their early members turned into a lich to aid their agencies, and after she was destroyed there was a bumper season, they concluded **all** arcane magic was equally evil. The **Faiths of Eberron** supplement points out that slightly more flexible individuals might have considered that after said lich caused **severe ecological damage**, the bumper season may have been a result of the balance reasserting rather than a sign that all wizards are using powers that risk severely crippling nature (you have to be at least level 17 to access that kind of thing).
    -   **Forgotten Realms** has the Shadow Druids, a sect of extremist druids who hate civilization and want to destroy it. They tend to go around siccing large, dangerous animals on anyone they perceive is "defiling" the natural world (in other words, anyone who's not another Shadow Druid). Other druid sects regard them as dangerous lunatics.
-   **GURPS Transhuman Space** has Blue Shadow, whose more fanatical branches bomb genetic engineering companies and "liberate" genemod sapients while sterilizing them. One such branch is led by an insane uplifted dolphin. And the Europan Defense Front, which is at war with the Green Duncanites over the terraforming of Europa's ocean.
-   **In Nomine**: Jordi, the Archangel of Animals, is tasked with protecting the animal kingdom, and he has no concerns about the human impact of his action. By the same token, his few human servants are ardent animal rights activists, and rarely the rational or restrained ones.
-   **Paranoia**: A more humorous example is the "Sierra Club" secret society, who don't let themselves be stopped by the fact that the only animals to protect in Alpha Complex are a few cockroaches. The fact that it shares a name with an actual environmental group may be the reason why it's called the "Seal Club" in later editions.
-   **Shadowrun**: Quite a few of these exist, some of them with connections to toxic shamans. Notable is Deborah Bailey, who rambles about animal rights in virtually every entry of sapient critters in the Paranormal Animals of North America sourcebook. Her input is more often than not cut short by the SysOp, who habitually deletes half of her posts in order to save precious megapulses of virtual storage space.
-   **Werewolf: The Apocalypse**: Subverted. The characters are expected to **play** environmental/animal rights warriors. For example, some characters rescue young lupus Garou and wolf kinfolk from zoos or exact brutal revenge on wolf hunters. In-game, this is justified because every evil strawman stereotype is true in this Crapsack World, and their grand goal is quite literally, "Aid our terrible master in not only ruining Earth but destroying her soul and claiming her corpse."
    -   The developers even include themselves; their in-universe equivalent is Black Dog Games, which practices every evil claim of people who crusade against role-playing games: subliminally encouraging violence, satanism, sociopathy, and sexual deviance. In **Werewolf**'s universe, school shootings really **are** because of RPGs. In Black Dog's version of the **Werewolf** RPG (a game within a game, if you're keeping score), werewolves are an Animal Wrongs Group gone off the deep end.
    -   The line eventually introduces an actual Animal Wrongs Group in the form of F.E.A.R. Itself, an eco-terrorist group aimed at radical action towards saving the environment... or so they think. In truth, the whole thing is a scam by the Black Spiral Dancers (fallen werewolves) to make a mockery of the Garou's concern for the Earth by driving young activists towards tactics that have a high body count, don't really stop projects that threaten the environment, bring heightened scrutiny down on the more benevolent ecological sabotage measures of the Garou, and risk making environmentalism a dirty word.

Animal Wrongs Group Example in Video Games

-   In **Avernum 5**, there is the Circle of Life cult, which breed various nasty critters and release them back into their (newly settled) natural habitat, much to the displeasure of others. However, when the group is confronted, it is shown they are quite pacifistic.
-   **Baldur's Gate** and **Baldur's Gate 2** has Faldorn, a Shadow Druid. She's a potential companion in the first game but an enemy in a sidequest in the second. In both games, she's anti-civilization and opposes even controlled hunts of dangerous monsters like wyverns and ankhegs. In the first game, she'll even turn on you if you try to resolve a conflict with some Shadow Druids and a group of hunters peacefully. In the second, she's taken over the local druid circle and is using her magic to send hordes of animals to attack the nearby trading town. She's also hypocritically using forbidden magic to drain the life from the region in order to make herself invincible (necessitating that a druid character challenges her to single combat for leadership of the druid circle in order to stop her).
-   **Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel!** has Cybil, a member of the Concordia Liberation Front who sends you to a scav camp to save creatures she calls "Cuties". As you murder your way through the camp, she gleefully delights in all the mayhem and carnage you're causing (for the sake of animals of course). When you finally reach the "Cuties" and find out that they're actually Torks (giant bugs that are certainly not cute), she demands that you murder them all.
-   **City of Heroes** has the Devouring Earth. Their MO involve propaganda, protesting, arson, kidnapping, indoctrination, mutation, animation, homicide, and genocide.
-   **Clout** has The Green Party. Among the bills they are affiliated with are Relax Assisted Suicide Restrictions, Fund Soylent Green Research, and their party's "Win Bill", which is to Legalize Homicide. For the good of the planet, obviously.
-   **Dave the Diver** has "Sea Blue"; an organisation claiming to fight against cruelty to sea life, except that not only do they immediately resort to violent methods, they entirely assault small businesses such as Dave hunting small amounts of fish for Bancho Sushi and is a Nice Guy otherwise, rather than the large corporations doing the real damage. Their leader John Watson for example attempts to kill Dave with a **grenade launcher** after he defeated the Giant Squid boss at the beginning in self-defense and John winds up blowing up part of the sea floor in a post-loss rage, then blames Dave for doing that. While infiltrating their secret base, Dave is horrified to learn that they're killing dolphins en masse.
-   In **Dwarf Fortress**, Elves are essentially a **Plant** Wrongs Group — cut down too many trees, and they will invade you and eat any of you that they manage to kill. They also get upset if you trade anything made out of wood or that has wood decoration, unless they're stuff that the Elves sold you (which are prefixed with "grown"). Apparently, the Elves use some kind of magic to make trees grow in the form they want to.
-   In **Fallout Tactics**, one activist releases **deathclaws**. No points for guessing what happens to her.
-   In **Final Fantasy Tactics A2**, one quest early in the game involves donating money to a monster's rights group, aiming to raise awareness of monsters that are endangered due to overhunting. A notice later in the game reveals that the group has come under fire, as one of their campaigns to protect the endangered "Cluckatrice" caused an increase in poaching, as more hunters are now aware of their existence.
    -   The resultant quest chain reveals that the monster's rights group is actually a front for Khamja, the Big Bad of clans, who themselves were poaching the birds and engineered the campaign as a way to raise demand.
-   The commune that moved into Sashimi Bay in **Hell Pie** were the ones responsible for the snail-people's ceasing their whaling industry. While they might have a point given the amount of Black Comedy Animal Cruelty we see them put a whale under, their solution to protecting the environment from perceived threats is throwing bombs around.
-   **Jurassic Park: The Game** has Dr. Sorkin, who clearly cares more for the dinosaurs than her fellow survivors. Upon hearing that the military intends to bomb the whole island, she takes the others hostage to try and negotiate for the dinosaurs, and when she's ignored, she decides to release the massive aquatic Mosasaur into the oceans to make a point, despite the ecological havoc such a move would cause. When called out on the latter, she brushes it off as not being a big deal, making it seem as if the dinosaurs are the only animals she **really** cares about. She also keeps hidden from her superiors a batch of dinosaurs, the troodons, she was ordered to euthanize because they were considered too terrifyingly dangerous even for Jurassic Park, as well as intentionally sabotaging the park's failsafe for biohazard control, the animals' engineered dependency on lysine supplements, because she unilaterally decides to do otherwise would be "cruel."
-   While most of the hippies in **Kingdom of Loathing** can be considered members of some self-righteous animal-lovers' group, the C.A.R.N.I.V.O.R.E. operative is explicitly one. Most of the hippies at least have no problem with pet ownership, unfortunately for said pets. The C.A.R.N.I.V.O.R.E. operative also drops a membership button when you beat him; wearing it enrages monsters so much that it makes them stronger (and worth more experience points).
-   **Legacy of a Thousand Suns** takes this to the extreme with animal rights groups that genetically engineer said animals, and more extreme are "bacteria-rights" groups that think that SPREADING A LETHAL CONTAGIOUS VIRUS ON HEAVILY RESOURCE-RICH (Read: Populated) PLANETS IS MORE ETHICAL THAN KEEPING A SMALL VIRUS PETRI DISH. Naturally, the opposing groups are also extremist (one of them willing to murder her twin sister gruesomely for the whole "spread the lethal virus" thing), but less taxing on the general populace of the galaxy, and thus eligible to ask for more help from the Sian Captain.
-   Thetis from **Mega Man ZX Advent**, who wants to use his powers to punish every person on earth for all the sea creatures they've killed with their incessant water pollution. To be fair to him, this is a world that's had no less than three class 1 apocalypses so far (all caused by Humans and Reploids, who he hates equally) and it's actually somewhat impressive that there's any sea life **left**.
    -   Also, he's not the only member of the 4 biometal users to try and reason with you, which based on normal enemy treatment makes him the friendliest of the enemies, there are implications that he's actually pushed into being a Well-Intentioned Extremist because of model W manipulating him, as with the rest of the biometal users being manipulated in gathering model W pieces, so presumably before that he was actually very kind.
-   **No Man's Sky** gives us the Sentinels, better known as The Malevolent Force, who are a set of Artificial Intelligences programmed to protect the worlds they're found on... "Protect" meaning, among other things, violently killing anyone who harms the local fauna, even in self-defense.
-   **One Way Heroics** lets you hunt endangered animals for powerful stat-boosting items, but this will anger the Jade Forest Group, whose members will try to kill you if they see you, even though 1: you are the only one who can stop the Darkness from destroying the world; and 2: said Darkness means that, unless you can trigger a win condition right away, the animals are going to die anyway, so their actions come across less as saving animal lives, and more as dooming the entire world to slightly prolong animal lives.
-   Played for Laughs (like everything else) in **Overlord II**: The elves, already overly emo in the first game, have become hippies bent on saving magical creatures from the magic-hating Glorious Empire — but only the cute fuzzy ones. As the titular Evil Overlord, one of the first things you do is march into their arctic preserve and start **clubbing baby seals**.
-   Nippon Ichi's **Phantom Brave** spoofs this with Canary, who is trying to start up an Animal Rights group named H.A.R.M. (Human Activists for Rare Monsters). He and a circus manager mistake the magical (but mute) gnomes known as Putties for non-sapient beings. The Putty, despite being caged, enjoys its leisurely life and wanders back in, prompting Canary to outright abduct it. Once recovered, though, the Putty wishes to go with Marona instead. He reluctantly goes back into the cage but escapes on his own later, to rejoin you on your island.
-   **Pokémon**:
    -   **Pokémon Black and White** versions feature as the main antagonist force Team Plasma, whose intent is to make trainers give up their Pokémon in order to release them back into the wild. Unusually for the trope, their views are given due consideration and cause several trainers to re-evaluate their relationships with their Pokémon, though most characters conclude that their ultimate goal of separating people and Pokémon entirely would be damaging to both. That said, many (but not all) members engage in as much Lillipup-kicking as any other fictional Animal Wrongs Group; forcefully abducting Pokémon from their trainers, hypocritically keeping Pokémon themselves, and decrying perceived abuse by trainers while **actually** abusing Pokémon. Plus, unknown to most of the organization, the whole thing is a sham by most of the group's leadership; if everyone's convinced to separate from Pokémon, then nobody can oppose them when **they** use Pokémon to take over. The trope is also subverted in that several members who don't know this agenda, including the figurehead leader, really do have Pokémon's best interests at heart and can't even help but befriend those they've "liberated". It also doesn't help that said figurehead leader can understand the speech of Pokemon and had been intentionally raised together with Pokemon which **had** been abused by their trainers so he'd assume it was normal for a trainer to abuse their Pokemon.
        -   By the time of **Pokémon Black 2 and White 2**, however, Team Plasma has split into two factions and neither one is an Animal Wrongs Group anymore: one side has reformed as a legitimate animal welfare group working to atone for their misdeeds; while the other has resorted to outright terrorism and doesn't even bother to use animal rights as a justification any more.
        -   Also, this became Hilarious in Hindsight when PETA themselves protested the **Pokémon** series premise at **Black 2** and **White 2**'s release, even going so far as to make their own spoof, **Pokémon Black and Blue**. Even more hilarious when you realize that they praise Team Plasma as the heroes and Ash, the guy who broke down crying when he thought his Pikachu was dead (as well as being a character from the **anime**, not the **games**), as the villain. Oddly enough, Ghetsis is the second-to-last opponent, so it's obvious **someone** on the PETA staff played the game and knew about his real intentions (which might suggest that PETA realized that Team Plasma was lampooning groups like them and took offense).
    -   The remakes of **Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire** portray Team Aqua this way, committed to expanding the sea in order to make new habitats for Pokémon that lost their homes to human development. In contrast, their rivals, Team Magma, are focused on furthering humanity's progress by expanding the landmass. (In the original games, both Teams thought their actions would benefit both humans and Pokémon, not one or the other.)
    -   **Pokémon Sun and Moon** has a downplayed example in the form of the Aether Foundation. Though they occupy a villainous role, most of the organization is legitimately well-intentioned, it's just their boss that has gone a bit wrong in the head (for example, the only reason its personnel attacks you when you invade is that they were falsely told that you had come to steal Pokémon). Once it comes under new management at the end of the games, the personnel are clearly working to atone for the organization's misdeeds.
-   **Ring Runner: Flight of the Sages** features PITA, an organization that will dogpile you with their space fighters in an early mission when you kill a few of Centrians' pets, those pets being... lethal AI-controlled turrets. PITA stands for **P**rotection of **I**ndigenous **T**urrets **A**gency, after all.
-   **Steer Madness** is an indie game where you play an anthropomorphic cow who joins an Animal Wrongs Group; setting test animals loose from a laboratory is one of your missions.
-   In **Streets of Rogue**, the cannibals oppose the consumption of animal meat due to ethical concerns, but also hate the taste of vegetarian food, leaving human meat as the only food they can eat.
-   **World of Warcraft** expansion pack **Wrath of the Lich King** features a faction called D.E.H.T.A. (Druids for the Ethical and Humane Treatment of Animals). Most of their quests involve brutally killing animal hunters and poachers (Their leader gives you brownie points for turning in the hunter's ears!)
    -   As a bonus, walking into the small D.E.H.T.A. camp within a few minutes of killing an animal will result in your becoming a pasty smear on the ground when the entire camp rushes you with Animal Wrong warcries. (This can, however, be averted by taking a swim before approaching the camp.)
        -   Alternatively, you could simply achieve a significantly higher level than them, resulting in **you** turning the entire camp into pasty smears on the ground.
    -   There's an interesting example of a Double Standard in their actions. On Nedar, Lord of Rhinos, the quest-giver notes with some regret that "It is a rare thing that D.E.H.T.A. would ever call for the death of an animal, but Ned's tainted rhino must be disposed of...", while he has no such reservations about sending you to kill Ned himself.
    -   The presence of this faction is an **intentional** satire of the game's players, as a quarter or more of all quests elsewhere in the world, including some in the very same zone, involve the slaughter of animals for everything from food to spell components to "for the lulz".
        -   To make the message completely unambiguous, the "loot crazed" hunters D.E.H.T.A. targets spout phrases like "Just fifty more hooves and I'll have the new gun!" and "I wonder what Nesingwary will give me for your hide!", mimicking players' thoughts.

Animal Wrongs Group Example in Web Animation

-   **Etra chan saw it!**: Azami thinks people chaining their dog outside their house is animal abuse. She later tries to free the dogs from their leash because she felt bad for them; however, the dogs immediately start chasing Azami.
-   Do's and Don'ts, from Smosh's **Shut Up! Cartoons** line up, introduces Vikki, an aggressive young vegan who accuses anyone who eats meat or animal products of murder. Her lessons border on fascist level extremes, such as holding another girl hostage in her basement and making this statement:

**"Studies show that vegetarians are smarter than meat eaters. So we have a duty to make decisions for you — no matter how much blood we shed!"**

---
Animal Wrongs Group Example in Webcomics

-   Gordito's Father in **The Adventures of Dr. McNinja** had his guns jammed by a PETA operative so he would be killed by the dangerous animals he was supposed to shoot in his sharp-shooting act that was decreed to be cruelty to animals. (Stuffing a bunch of animals into a cannon and firing them all out so that they can be shot just might fulfill **anyone's** standard for animal cruelty.) The reason the circus had gotten away with it up to that point was that they used rabid animals that were going to be killed anyway. Just FYI.
-   In **Camp Calomine**, the entire camp is run by these. Ralph gets in a dig using Sundoggie, a vegan who identifies with otters — which Charles uses against him by pointing out that otters are carnivores.
-   **Cyanide and Happiness** contains a **goldfish rights activist**(pictured above). And "fur is murder!".
-   **Housepets!**, in which the titular pets are sapient beings that have more rights than real-world pets, has a whole arc that centers around two guys employed by PETA. However, while one fits this trope well, the other is a far more nuanced character; as well, the arc is a criticism of PETA specifically (the sane one notes that they let him join without a background check).
    -   The PETA guys try and kidnap a beloved pet, one of them, Joel, goes to prison. Cosmic forces punish Joel by turning him \*into\* a dog. Joel soon learns the error of his ways and how terrible it was to take an animal from a loving family. His story continues on to this day.
-   **The Japanese Beetle** used this a couple of times. One arc had the Militia for Ethical Animal Treatment stop the eponymous hero's battle with a Kaiju by pelting him with "Bricks of Love" and trying to let it go free (it ate their leader). A later story had an aged hippie concoct a formula that made anyone who ate meat suffer "sympathetic pains", usually manifested as violent reactions followed by blackouts; Ken thwarted him by injecting him with his own formula, then making him eat a soy burger, causing him to feel the same sympathetic pains.
-   **Living with Insanity** featured an arc where an animal wrongs group with the acronym ANAL tried to liberate the cat. (It starts here.) The result was **a giant hammer** and **stabbing**.
-   **The Order of the Stick**: Leeky Windstaff, an evil Druid who animates the trees of a city park to rebel against their "mewling city dweller" masters.
-   Stephanie Kane of the **Paranormal Mystery Squad** butts heads with the PETM, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Monsters, a group that demands that cryptids be captured alive and unharmed, on a regular basis, which runs at odds with her own mission to kill any cryptid that threatens humans.
-   The Crocomire Hunter, a main character in **Planet Zebeth**, fits this quite well. He goes into fits of sobbing and/or plots for revenge when an enemy creature (yes, they are referred to as enemies, even though many are friendly or at least unassuming) is killed. All other main characters have no sense of value for the enemies' lives, so this happens often.
-   **Pv P Online** had a guy trying to capture the panda living in the Pv P building so that he could release him back into the wild. Said panda was not only legally allowed to be there (he couldn't return to the wild and WWF deemed the Pv P building to be his new habitat,even paying Cole a hefty annual sum for the privilege),but would later move to Seattle with the crew and have a family of his own within Pv P. Needless to say,it did not go well for the animal rights guy.
-   **Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal** has this guy.
-   **Sluggy Freelance** has had a few panels with PETA members attempting to "rescue" Bun-Bun. Hilarity and stab wounds ensued. There was even a week featuring an all-PETA version of **Survivor** (of which there was only one, the guy who was voted off, the others died).
-   **Something\*Positive** has a parody of this mentality in the Teddy Bear Liberation Front. The TBLF seeks out and exacts revenge on people who modify stuffed animals for sexual purposes. This revenge usually consists of breaking into their houses, "rescuing" any toys they find and beating the plushie-philes nearly to death.
-   Pierrot in **Spacetrawler** is mostly portrayed sympathetically, but he arguably crosses a line when he saves a cage full of furryites (stated to be vicious killers) from being eaten... by setting them free in the middle of a crowded restaurant. It's all played for Black Comedy.
-   **Suicide for Hire**: Arc would rather face a Cthuluian armageddon than PETA's zealots.
    -   And Hunter punting a Chihuahua somehow resulted in him taking a bazooka to the PETA world headquarters.
-   Subverted in **Templar Arizona**. A group of animal rights activists are picketing a restaurant, screaming and throwing trash... but considering that the guy who owns the restaurant lovingly serves up only endangered and cute things such as poached (the cooking method) condor eggs and braised newborn puppies, it's completely justified. Though the owner notes, as he finishes reading off the day's menu, "I'll be back tomorrow. I do so enjoy our little visits. And I suspect that you do, too."
-   **Uh-Oh, It’s a Dinosaur**: Jill gets between them and a group of gun-toting carnivores.

Animal Wrongs Group Example in Western Animation

-   A flashback in season 2 of **Archer** reveals Lana was part of such a group, of the "fur is murder" throwing red paint on fur shoppers variety. When Lana is about to throw paint on Mallory as she walks out in a new fur, Mallory pulls a gun and dares her to do it. Lana doesn't back down, so Mallory offers her a job.
-   In **Ben 10**, we have the "Friends of Fish" group, which is really just a façade used by poacher Jonah Melville to hunt exotic underwater animals.
    -   Much later in the series, we got Pax, a Florauna (Wildvine's species) who claims to be an alien rights activist and member of Extraterrestrials for the Ethical Treatment of Aliens. Though his methods are non-violent, they are incredibly misguided, as he is willing to release even extremely dangerous creatures from containment and shows no concern for anyone who gets hurt by them in the process.
-   In **Brickleberry**'s fourth episode, the rangers are confronted by PITA (People are less Important Than Animals) as a result of them exploiting Steve's squabbits. One of their acts is to subject the rangers to forceful makeup testing and they later get killed by the squabbits after the latter acquire a taste for blood.
-   One episode of **Detentionaire** featured a trio of kids with a habit of freeing frogs from mistreatment. Not only does this cause the school to be mostly quarantined (kicking off the plot of the episode), but they also **caused a factory meltdown**, which nearly **kills** Lee and his friends, in order to save the frogs being used to color the product made there. We also find out that they were responsible for the frogs appearing during the prank, though they weren't responsible for the prank itself; they merely used it as a distraction.
-   Inverted in the **Family Guy** episode "Dog Gone" where Brian tries to start an animal rights group. It doesn't last long.
-   **Futurama** had a slightly different spin on it.
    -   Bender becomes a one-robot Animal Wrongs Group in "The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz". There is also a subversion; The conservation group in charge of protecting the penguins decides that the best way to curb the sudden overpopulation (caused by Planet Express' dark matter) is to break out the guns and declare it penguin-hunting season. This is, in fact, Truth in Television. Culling is a very valid strategy if one values species' health over individuals' welfare and is used by several conservation groups. Notably, Leela, the resident Animal Lover, provides much of the morality and aesops of the episode: when the animals lovers inexplicably turn into bloodthirsty hunters excited at the prospect of killing, Leela (who begrudgingly **agreed** that killing may have been a viable solution) points out that any problem as sensitive as overpopulation doesn't have an easy answer, but knows the decision shouldn't be left in the hands of people who want to kill for fun.
    -   Futurama also played the trope straight with Mankind For Ethical Animal Treatment (MEAT), a PETA knockoff that starts off protesting the Popplers and then ends up thwarting the Planet Express crew's plan to solve the interplanetary crisis that ensues without Leela getting eaten, serving as part of an elaborate Running Gag. The leaders of both the above groups are the members of the Waterfall clan. Free Waterfall Jr. is the first, in the Popplers episode, and his father swears to avenge his death at the end when Lrr (of the planet Omicron Persei VIII) eats him. The father in question, Free Waterfall Sr., is the leader in "Birdbot". When he gets pecked to death by penguins, **his** father swears revenge. Old Man Waterfall, the elder in question, serves as Zoidberg's civil rights attorney in a later episode, is then killed, and his Straw Feminist great-granddaughter swears revenge. (She showed up again, and when she did, she was toast. And so was her brother.)
    -   When Leela protested that the activists couldn't expect everyone to conform to their standards, Free Waterfall Jr. corrected her; in fact, they could, on the basis that they taught a lion to eat tofu. Pan right to an emaciated lion, which coughs once, pathetically. What truly set Free Waterfall Jr.'s group apart was, he valued the rights of animals above those of humans. Zapp Branigan's plan to save Leela by substituting an ape would have actually worked if he hadn't opened his big mouth in an attempt to save the ape. (He failed to do so, and what ultimately happened to him was pretty much no-one's fault but his, seeing as he annoyed Lrr so much.)
    -   "31st Century Fox" has Bender outraged to discover that a fox hunt he's joined is hunting a robot fox, so he forms a robot animal rights group called Bender's Animal Robot Front. His accomplishments include freeing a single robot chicken (which is apparently incapable of doing anything besides laying robot eggs), chopping off the hand of a robot butcher who is slicing up a robot pig and liberating robot ducks from a carnival shooting gallery at the cost of killing an organic goose.
-   **Garfield and Friends**: In "Well-Fed Feline", Garfield eats Jon's entire seven-layer lasagna cake and tries to mail Nermal to Abu Dhabi. When Jon finds out, he threatens not to feed Garfield again until Arbor Day. This gets the attention of Harriet Underburger, an animal activist involved with the Park Place Pet Protection Plan who mistakes Jon for a terrible cat owner and threatens to arrest him unless he feeds Garfield. Jon does so, as Garfield eats him out of house and home. Unfortunately, Jon gets arrested anyway for neglecting to feed Nermal. At the end of the episode, Garfield bails Jon out of jail by showing the judge just how well-nourished he is. After all, the kitchen is empty and Jon is the only one who does the shopping.
-   **Generator Rex**: The Green Fist, a South American gang that breaks EVOs out from Providence bases, saying that keeping EVOs locked up goes against the natural order. The same EVOs who are organisms mutated by nanomachines, many of which are hostile to non-EVO life forms, and tend to wreck buildings and kill dozens of people. Their leader calls Rex and Bobo "traitors to their own kind".
    
    **Bobo:** Just what we need. Humans for the ethical treatment of EVOs.
    
-   **Godzilla: The Series** had a **Kaiju** liberation group called S.C.A.L.E. (Servants of Creatures Arriving Late to Earth) that believed kaiju and other mutants to be the future of evolution and try to free all the monsters from Monster Island. Their leader was so devoted, she was even willing to let the creatures **eat** her.
-   In one episode of **Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law**, the People's Animal Freedom Front liberates Magilla Gorilla from Peebles' Pet Shop (running over a dog in the process). By the end of the show, they've dumped the obnoxious ape out in the woods somewhere after suffering through many, **many** puns.
-   The central characters in **I Am Not an Animal** are released by one of these groups.
-   A subtle version is used on **King of the Hill**. In "Order of the Straight Arrow", Bobby accidentally knocks out a whooping crane while on a snipe hunt; while trying to secretly bury it, they are harassed by not only an unnamed animal rights group, but a park ranger as well. Later, while trying to bury it in a field, the animal rights "hippies" chase them off, decrying them as murderers, while tearing down plant life and stepping on a bird's nest, crushing several eggs.
    -   Another example in "Good Hill Hunting": Hank and Bobby can't hunt because a hunger strike by an animal rights' group limited the number of available permits. As Hank points out, this will lead to more suffering for the deer, since they will all starve without the herd being thinned by hunters.
-   Parodied in an episode of **My Gym Partner's a Monkey**, where a group called "B.A.A.A." (Because All Animals Are Amazing) shows up at the school to protest the vaccinations that the school is giving its students. This is apparently standard procedure for Charles Darwin. Hypocritically, at the end of the episode they go for burgers, showing they're not above **eating** animals since if they were, their leader would've said veggie burgers.
-   A bunch of college students in an episode of **Pinky and the Brain** free laboratory animals, and then immediately toss them into the wild to fend for themselves... usually in the wrong habitats, in part thanks to completely misidentifying the species. This includes taking the titular laboratory mice and tossing them out of a plane into the Amazon Jungle.
    
    "Can mice fly?"  
    "Sure, just like monkeys."
    
-   An episode of **The Powerpuff Girls (1998)** "Save Mojo" had an animal rights group trying to stop the PPGs from "harassing" Mojo Jojo, i.e., stopping him from committing crimes (by beating him up). They claimed Mojo wasn't evil but only following his natural instincts.....which included building incredibly complex machinery, and living in an entirely human manner including speaking in clear if over-iterative English. After some constant confrontations, the Girls then helped the group move Mojo to the wild.
-   **The Simpsons**:
    -   In "Lisa the Tree Hugger", Jesse the environmentalist tells Lisa, "I'm a level five vegan. I won't eat anything that casts a shadow."
    -   Subverted in "The Dad Who Knew Too Little", where Homer and Lisa attend a relatively realistic protest against testing make-up on animals.
        
        "What do we want?" "The gradual phase-out of animal testing over the next three years!" "When do we want it?" "Over the next three years!"
        
    -   In the **Itchy and Scratchy** short "Screams from a Mall," Itchy nails Scratchy's feet to an escalator, causing his fur to rip off, then puts the fur up for sale. Scratchy nabs the fur back from a customer and drapes it over himself, whereupon a group of activists beat him up with their "Fur is murder" signs, despite it being **his own fur.**
    -   In "The Frying Game", Homer gets in trouble with the EPA for almost killing a screamapillar.
        
        **EPA Guy:** Mr. Simpson, allowing an endangered species to die is a federal offense under the Reversal of Freedoms Act of 1994. You are now legally responsible for the safety and well-being of this screamapillar. Everything you need to know is in this pamphlet.
        
        **Lisa:** (**takes the pamphlet, reading**) Screamapillar Care Tips. Wow, look at all this stuff. "Without constant reassurance, it will die. It's sexually attracted to fire..."
        
-   **South Park**:
    -   In "Douche and Turd", PETA is depicted as a bunch of zoophiles who think that having a cow as a sports mascot is degrading and force South Park Elementary to change it. Among the choices the kids can vote for is the Redskins, which Wendy points out is offensive and degrading to Native Americans, only to be told that it's okay, because PETA doesn't care about **people** being degraded, just animals.
    -   In the episode "Free Willzyx", animal activists shoot down a group of police officers, border patrol officers, and an innocent bystander to get a whale to Mexico. Worse yet, the reason, which the animal liberation group is unaware of, is that the whale is being transported to Mexico not to get it to the ocean, but to the moon (It Makes Sense in Context). It gets there. As you might have expected, it doesn't last long. The episode is parodying the movie **Free Willy**.
    -   **Whale Wars** is skewered in the season 13 episode "Whale Whores", which satirizes them as media whores who aren't being nearly extreme **enough**. When Stan joins their crew and starts using actual terrorism methods to fight whalers, the only thing that people seem to notice is how this makes the show interesting to watch for once, as well how many ratings the new show is getting.
-   **Wally Gator**: In one of several shorts produced for Boomerang, Wally gets kidnapped by a group of animal rights activists and taken to a swamp (and they rather hypocritically run over a snake in the process). The joke's on them, though; Wally thinking about his "terrible" life in captivity ends up convincing the two gators already in the swamp to take the activists' jeep and Wally and head back to the zoo. The last shot shows the three gators living in luxury and the activists stranded in the swamp, with an animal of prey yelling at them for messing up the natural order.
