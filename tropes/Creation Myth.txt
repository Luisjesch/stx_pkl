Creation Myth: 
_"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."_

A creation myth is a supernatural mytho-religious story or explanation that describes the beginnings of humanity, the Earth (see Genesis Effect), life, and the universe (cosmogony), usually as a deliberate act of "creation" by one or more deities. It may also include the creation of one or more deities (theogony), either before or after the cosmogony.

Many creation myths share broadly similar themes. Common motifs include the fractionation of the things of the world from a Primordial Chaos; the separation of the mother and father gods; land emerging from an infinite and timeless ocean; everything coming from a Cosmic Egg, or creation ex nihilo (Latin: out of nothing).

Since this is a very common trope in ancient mythologies, it is Older Than Dirt.

Creation myths are often used by modern writers to help give depth to their fictional world or mythologies. Mythopoeia almost inevitably includes a creation myth. These are often told in the beginning of the work.

Compare Creation Story, where characters of the story are involved as creators or witnesses. See also Caused the Big Bang.

Creation Myth Example in Comic Books

-   **Strontium Dogs** told the Gronks' creation myth while Gronk and Feral were looking for Johnny's corpse. In it, when God created the universe, He at first forgot to give the first gronk a heart. After taking care of the rest of creation, God saw that humanity was going to wreck the place, and so returned to Blas and gave the gronks four hearts, in order that they would embody love.
-   In the Smite Homer tells Nassa how many different gods from different pantheons all played a part in creating the human realm.
-   In **Wonder Woman (2006)** when Zeus confronts Kāne-Milohai about Diana's patronage he questions just what Milohai did in order to claim responsibility for creating the cosmos. Milohai is evasive in his answer as Zeus is being rude and came there to kill him, and Zeus is dismissive of the possibility the myth is true, but seems to think he'd done **something** in order for the myth to come about.

Creation Myth Example in Fan Works

-   According to Lorwardian myth in the **Kim Possible** fanfic **Empire**, the Goddess (aka "the one above all") shaped the universe in her hands, and then the planet Lorwardia. Her hands gave form and life to the Lorwardians.
-   In **Crossover Chaos**, the omniverse was made by Xedra Colmare, who created the very first incarnation of the omniverse (the current one is the 152nd) in a fit of boredom. Xey created beings to take of it for xem, and later, xey mate with a bunch of beings from the first omniverse, starting the Colmare family. They live through many incarnations of the omniverse, as the cycle begins anew each time. The bloodline still exists in the current 152nd incarnation of the omniverse. This is important because Herobrine, Kyle, Jamie, Luke and Lindsay are all descendants of the Colmares.
-   In **Warriors Redux**, the **Warriors** mythology has been expanded to depict the forest's creation. It involves a monstrous creature called the Mother eating smaller monsters and then giving birth to three children: Tiger (Rokhar), Leopard (Suriin), and Lion (Horoa). Her children created the water, trees, clouds, etc. The Mother created the wildlife, with "less perfect" animals being made out of the monsters she eaten. Her greatest creation was the domestic cats and, as a result, she gifted them the forest. It's also explained that the sun and the moon are each an eye from Lion and Leopard respectively.
-   **RWBY: Scars**:
    -   Followers of Dust, like Weiss, believe that every human was made from Ice Dust (as in, the special dust used in **RWBY**, not normal dust) in Atlas. Faunus were made from Fire Dust in the deserts of Vacuo. Being made from separate Dusts is why the two species don't get along. The Grimm were made without Dust, which is why they wish to destroy those who were made with Dust.
    -   Faunus are generally Ishvara followers. They believe that Mother Devi created humans first, but she was unsatisfied with their uniformity. She then creates Grimm but was unsatisfied with them and abandoned them. Mother Devi finally created the Faunus, who came in numerous types and were all so different. Over time, the humans came to hate Faunus because Mother Devi preferrred them.
    -   Believers in the Brothers Church believe the creation myth given in **RWBY** canon.
-   The Smurfs of **Empath: The Luckiest Smurf** believe that Father Time and Mother Nature, the patron guardians/deities of the Smurf Forest, created the earth and the universe on what is called the First Day, which is what they have celebrated every Winter Solstice up until they discovered the human holiday of Christmas.
-   **A Diplomatic Visit**: The one for the entire **Powers-That-Be** multiverse is given in chapter 5 of the second sequel, **Diplomacy Through Schooling**.

Creation Myth Example in Literature

-   The trope page quote comes from **Book of Genesis**, the Trope Codifier of creation story.
-   The prologue to **The Silmarillion**, "Ainulindalë", is the creation story of Middle-Earth.
-   The Land from the **The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant** has several, mutually contradictory creation stories. Word of God indicates that there are elements of truth to all of them, and events in the final arc bear this out<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> but a complete, unbiased account is never given.
-   Narnia in **The Magician's Nephew**. It's one example of the characters not being told about creation of Narnia but rather witnessing the act of it.
-   **Watership Down** features a **rabbit** creation myth. The sun-god, Frith, originally created all animals as equals, but when the children of El-hrairah, the First Rabbit and a popular Folk Hero, began eating everything, Frith transformed many of the other species into rabbit-eating predators. Then, to ensure that rabbitkind wouldn't be wiped out entirely, the sun-god blessed El-hrairah's bottom with quick feet and a cotton tail to warn for danger.
-   The Discworld in **Eric**.
    -   The Discworld dwarf version of a Creation Myth is featured in **Thud!**.
    -   The first **Science of Discworld** is, in part, a comedy version of our own universe's origin-story. The wizards compare the progression of events in Roundworld to several Disc creation myths, mostly while grousing that our world is doing it all wrong.
-   Olaf Stapledon's **Star Maker** provides a rare sci-fi version.
-   Lord Dunsany's **The Gods of Pegāna** starts with a creation myth.
-   The Dwarves' worldview in the **Inheritance Cycle**, which the main character converts to. The elves disagree with it.

-   **Enûma Eliš** is possibly **the** oldest Creation Myth known to science.
-   In the Star Trek Novel Verse, an Andorian creation myth referencing the sundering of their race into four genders is essential to the in-depth exploration of their culture. According to the myth, their race was split into four sexes to demonstate their lack of self-knowledge; they were missing a vital aspect of self-awareness that prevented them being Whole. To unite the four genders is to take a step towards reclaiming spiritual perfection - though the "missing piece" is also needed if Andorians are to truly grow as a people. See in particular the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Relaunch.
-   The Garden of Eden story pops up here and there in **Dirge for Prester John**, but each of the races of Pentexore have their own myths of how the world came to be. Later, John tries to rewrite Genesis to fit Pentexore in it, because he simply can't let it go.
-   Dave Barry in "Clan of the Cave Rhinoceros" presented varying conceptions of this developed by his son's kindergarten class:
    
    These concepts reveal a wide diversity of opinion about the Origins of Man, ranging from the traditional Judeo-Christian Biblical concept:  
    "This is Adam and Eve. They ate the bad fruit. They went back to God. They didn't have any clothes."  
    To the less-conventional Big Bird and Oak Tree concept:  
    "In the beginning of the world there was a big bird and an oak tree. The big bird had a coconut, and the moon was out."
    
-   **RWBY: Fairy Tales of Remnant**: **The Tale of the Two Brothers** is how Remnant and humanity were created by the Brother Gods, and is explored in the main show as well. **The Judgment of Faunus** and **The Shallow Sea** are two stories about how Faunus came to be: one is a god's attempt to solve a war between humans and animals that then creates new problems; one is a god's attempt to find a way to bring certain special humans over to their island sanctuary without humanity's instinct for destruction ruining the haven.
-   **The Tygrine Cat**: Te Bubas tells Mati that the Creators created a desert by crushing light into grains of sand and scattering it upon the dark and empty Earth. They then raised life from the desert's surface by sheer force of will.
-   In the first **Wicked** book, a few older myths are noted by Elphaba and Doctor Dillamond:
    -   There is an early, Pagan Lurline Creation Myth that predates the **Oziad**. The Fairy Queen Lurline was flying a long voyage when she beckoned water from a desert to quench her thirst, causing Oz to spring up. Lurline rested on Mount Runcible and when she urinated she caused the Gillikin River to form. Animals were formed from clots of Earth lodged by all the plant growth. The animals mistook Lurline's urine for a disastrous flood and attempted to swim through it. The animals that turned back, or kept where they were, stayed animals while the ones that swam on to the far shore became sentient Animals.
    -   Unionists watered down the initial myth to fit their beliefs. The flood was a sea of tears caused by the Unnamed God, who felt the sorrow that would overwhelm Oz with time. Animals were kept afloat by a large uprooted tree. The animals that swallowed enough of the Unnamed Gods tears began to sorrow as well and began to build rafts for their fellow kin. These sympathetic animals ended up becoming the first Animals.
    -   According to the **Oziad**, the Dragon of Time created the sun and moon.
-   Cats in **Tailchaser's Song** have their own mythology. It is believed that everything was created by a Goddess called "Meerclar Allmother". The world was originally populated with cats, children of the original Two: Harar Goldeneye and Fela Skydancer. One of the Two's children, a middle son named Grizraz Hearteater, was driven by jealousy to create a Hell Hound in order to kill his siblings. His brother, Viror Whitewind, stopped it but died in the process. Their other brother, Tangaloor Firefoot, trapped Grizraz underneath a tree. After resurfacing later, Grizaz was blinded by the sun and dug a hole into the Earth, where it is said he still remains.
-   **Hunter's Moon (1989)**: The world was created by animals such as a fox called A-O. In the days of Firstdark, when the universe was dark, **Groff** came and created the sun for humans to hunt. He plunged his hand into the dirt and came up with a ball of fire. When he threw the sun into the sky, its soul detached into the moon.
-   A few are told by Valley people in **Always Coming Home**. It is unclear how much of it is tradition and how much is made up on the spot.
-   **Earth's Children**: "The Mother's Song", which first appears (in full) in the fifth book, is a narrative poem which tells of how the Mother (Earth) was born "out of the darkness, the chaos of time". She uses the dust left over from Her <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> birth to create the Moon as a companion for Herself, and later ventures into the void and takes the life-force, causing Her to become pregnant. The next few verses describe how She gives birth to a son (the Sun) and how this gives rise to the rivers and seas, plants start to grow, mountains are formed, and the stars are created. However, the Sun is lured into the void and, though the Mother tries to get him back, She is unable to do so, even with the Moon's help. Instead, they and the void become locked in an endless struggle, in which the Sun's light disappears whenever the void is winning, giving rise to night and day. The Mother, grieving for the loss of Her son, draws on the life-force again and gives birth to all the animals, before giving birth to the first humans.

-   **Foundation (2021)** has Luminism, a major religion that revolves around the concepts of soul and reincarnation. Its followers believe in a triple goddess, which is the personification of the three moons orbiting the planet of Dol: the Maiden, the Mother, and the Crone. Their mythology says that their goddess was once a single entity called Surah. When Surah collided with Dol, it split Surah apart creating the three moons.
-   The title sequence in **The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power** is a musical sequence of matter being formed by the sand vibrating, based on the Middle-Earth Ainulindalë (Music of the Ainur) musical creation myth.
    -   Galadriel's description of the state of the world when she was in Valinor was taken almost verbatim from **The Book of Genesis**.

Creation Myth Example in Multiple Media

-   **BIONICLE** had the legend of Mata Nui, describing the backstory of the brand's early years. It was recounted in the comics, on promo CDs, online content, the novels and in the first Direct to Video movie. After the first major arc, the legend (at least apart from its beginning lines) was revealed to be a lie crafted by the village elders to hide their people's forgotten past, until it was time to reveal it to them. Way after that, the rest turned out to have been bogus as well, when they uncovered Mata Nui's true nature.
-   In the **Beavis and Butt-Head Ensucklopedia** book, there's a page talking about "The Story of Creation".
    
    So \[God\] said, "This sucks." Then he said, "Let there be stuff." And like there was the Earth and stuff.

Creation Myth Example in Tabletop Games

-   **Dungeons & Dragons**:
    -   In **Eberron**, the universe was created by the three progenitor dragons Eberron, Siberys and Khyber. Khyber killed Siberys for reasons varying reasons, and Eberron used her own body to bind Khyber forever in retaliation. Eberron, the Dragon Between, became the world, Siberys, the Dragon Above, became the planetary ring, and Khyber, the Dragon Bellow, became the underdark/setting equivelant to the Lower Planes.
    -   In the **Forgotten Realms** the Crystal Sphere (D&D's equivelant of solar systems) was created by the Overgod Ao, and he dumped the leftover creation stuff in the Astral Sea. Said creation stuff became Shar, goddess of Darkness, and Selûne, goddess of Light. Selûne and Shar created Chauntea, goddess of life, who asked for light and warmth so she could give life to the dead rocks floating through space. Selûne obliged, creating the sun, but Shar was pissed that Selûne had made such a decision without her, causing the first war between them. The battle caused the creation of Mystryl, goddess of magic, who sided with Selûne and thus ended the war. Life on Toril, then known as Abeir-Toril, attracted the chaotic Primordials, who waged the Dawn War against the gods, with new gods being created by the conflict. Eventually, Ao decided that enough was enough and split Abeir-Toril into the twin planets Abeir and Toril, with the gods getting Toril and the Primordials getting Abeir.

-   **Dimension X**: In episode thirty-one, an adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's "Universe", the people of the Lower Levels believe that Jordan was a god who created the universe; a Ship 25 kilometers wide and 100 levels high.

Creation Myth Example in Video Games

-   The **Zelda** series has one that's told in detail in **The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time**, assigning the three Goddesses of the Triforce their own important attribute, which they use to create the land and creatures as well as the mythical Triforce itself. Like many ancient creation stories, the Hyrulian creation story is regional. There's no mention of the countries outside of Hyrule. Interestingly, this creation myth only partially agrees with the creation myth presented in **The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past**. However, Word of God states that **Ocarina** came first chronologically (at least until **Minish Cap** and then **Skyward Sword** came along), suggesting that the **Link to the Past** story may be the same one but details became distorted over time.
-   **Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn** has one of these involving a Goddess of Order and a Goddess of Chaos. However, the majority of the story was mixed up to the point where everyone believed the opposite of what was actually true.
-   In **Granblue Fantasy**, the God of Creation created the Sky World which had the various races slowly grow on the many islands that were created. Eventually his creations rebelled against the god, splitting him into two beings, one with the power of creation and the other wielding the power of destruction and regeneration. The former left, creating a stagnant world, being unable to destroy anything. The latter stayed in the Sky World, making it undergo a cycle of destruction and regeneration all the way up to the present day. It's only brought up in the game when the player character, Lyria, and Vyrn reach the depths of Pandemonium, The Alcatraz for Primal Beasts and wonder whether Pandemonium reaches down to the world of the god of creation. It's later hinted several times that the denizens of the Crimson Horizon, the world created by that god, have been trying to use Pandemonium as a bridge into the Sky World.
-   **Brütal Legend**, in keeping with it's general theme, gives us the most metal creation myth ever. In the beginning, the world was dark, and populated by a race of incredibly ugly demons known only as the First Ones. Then one day Ormagöden, The Great Firebeast arose, and began careening across the sky. The First Ones hated Ormagöden, because his fire lit up the world and exposed their ugliness, so they tried to drown The Great Firebeast and quench his flames with mud. Rather than die that way, Ormagöden let out a massive roar and tore his body to shreds to keep it from the First Ones, granting the world the elements of Metal, Blood, Fire and Noise. His metal flesh sank into the earth, seeding it with veins of ore. His blood poured out and filled the seas. His burning heart was flung into the sky, and became the sun. Finally, whenever truly badass music is played or a huge engine revved, you are hearing the echo of the death-roar of Ormagöden, and reminded of how he sacrificed himself to create the world as we know it.
-   **Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire** introduces three powerful Legendary Pokémon; two of them, Groudon and Kyogre, are said to be involved with the forming of the continents and the seas, respectively, with the third, Rayquaza, being there to calm them down if they get hostile to each other. **Pokémon Diamond and Pearl**, introduces a different creation myth: Arceus, the Original One, was born from chaos. It created an egg from which hatched three other Pokemon: Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina. These three formed the foundations of the universe (Time, Space, and Antimatter). It then created a second egg which hatched into Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit, who begat intelligent life into the new universe by introducing the concepts of Memory, Willpower, and Emotion.
-   A book available in the first **Suikoden** gives the origin of the world (and the True Runes) as the result of an unstoppable force striking an immovable object.
-   **Glitch** has the world created by eleven giants.
-   **The Elder Scrolls** has two covering different events - the creation of "creation" itself and then then the creation of Mundus, the mortal plane:<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
    -   Anu and Padomay are the anthropomorphized primordial forces of "stasis/order/light" and "change/chaos/darkness", respectively. Their interplay in the great "Void" led to Nir, "creation". Nir loved Anu, which Padomay hated. Padomay killed Nir and the 12 worlds she gave birth to. Anu wounded Padomay, presuming him dead. Anu salvaged the pieces of the 12 worlds to create one world: Nirn. Padomay returned and wounded Anu, seeking to destroy Nirn. Anu then pulled Padomay and himself outside of time, ending Padomay's threat to creation "forever". From the intermingling of their spilled blood came the "et'Ada", or "original spirits", who would go on to become either the Aedra or the Daedra depending on their actions during the creation of Mundus. (Some myths state that the Aedra come from the mixed blood of Anu and Padomay, while the Daedra come purely from the blood of Padomay).
    -   One of these spirits, said to have been "begat" by Padomay, was Lorkhan (aka Shor, Shezarr, Sep, etc.). Depending on the version of the myth, he convinced/tricked some of the other et'Ada into helping him create the mortal plane, known as Mundus. (The races of Mer, or Elves, who believe they descend from the Aedra, generally believe this was a cruel trick that robbed their ancestors of their pre-creation divinity while the races of Men believe it was a good thing which broke the spirits out of a state of boring pre-creation stasis.) Those et'Ada who sacrificed large parts of their being to create Mundus became known as the Aedra ("Our Ancestors" in the Classical Tongue of Aldmeris), while those that did not participate became the Daedra ("Not Our Ancestors"). For his treachery, the Aedra "killed" Lorkhan and tore out his "divine center" (heart), which they cast down into the mortal world he helped to create. (Some tellings, particularly those of Men, state that this was part of Lorkhan's plan all the long, with his spirit then "impregnating" Nirn.)
-   Successful completion of the Sand People sidequest and Krayt hunt in **Knights of the Old Republic** concludes with the Sand People telling you their creation myth. They were once a technologically advanced race who were enslaved by the Rakata. When the Infinite Empire was hit with a plague, the slaves revolted, and hid underground when the Rakata bombed the planet's surface to glass. The story also implies that the Sand People may be the ancestors of, or at least related to, the Star Wars universe humans. Be careful, though, as questioning too many aspects of the myth will cause all the tribe to turn hostile.
-   As the player progresses through **Super Mario Galaxy** he unlocks chapters in Rosalina's Storybook, the tale of a girl and her Luma as they travel the cosmos in search of their respective mothers. It becomes clear very soon that the tale is autobiographical: the girl in the book is Rosalina's younger self, and the story tells how she came to leave her homeworld and become the immortal overseer of the Comet Observatory. She may not have **created** the universe, but she's essential in maintaining its cycle of death and rebirth.
-   **Dark Souls** begins with one. In the Age of Ancients, before the world was fully formed, all was made of stone - the landscape, the trees, even the everlasting dragons. Then Fire entered the world, and it brought the three Disparities - hot and cold, life and death, and light and dark. Humans appeared from... somewhere, and four of them found Lord Souls within the Fire: Nito, the first of the dead; the Witch of Izalith, founded of the Daughters of Chaos; Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, founder of the Silver Knights; and the furtive pygmy, so easily forgotten. In cooperation with Seath the Scaleless, the one dragon who was mortal, the Lords used their great powers to overthrow and wipe out the dragons and usher in the current Age of Fire.
-   As you play through **The Neverhood**, you slowly discover that the world you are exploring was in the process of its own creation myth until Klogg stole Hoborg's crown, turning him into stone.

Creation Myth Example in Webcomics

-   **MS Paint Adventures**, in its constant pursuit of epicness, has explored this trope.
    
    -   **Problem Sleuth** has the sequence in which Godhead Pickle Inspector calls his four TEMPORAL REPLICSIMILE-created clones from the afterlife and tasks them with creating the universe **by dividing in two, forwards and backwards in space, until they reach across all of time and thus constitute all elementary particles of the universe**.
    -   Andrew liked the idea, and **Homestuck** is, by his words, an elaborate creation myth based on **Spore**, **EarthBound**, and **The Sims**. Which apparently means our creators are twelve... (internet) trolls with serious mental issues?
    
    "I thought the concept of our universe being created by a bunch of cantankerous internet trolls was a funny idea." — Andrew
    
-   In **Digger**, Ed the hyena relates the creation myth of his people. Since the author has a degree in anthropology Ed's tale feels very authentic.
-   The catalyst for the plot of **Forming**, which uses a similar story to that of Kabbalah: the universe was not created by God, but rather by Lucifer, who was the first being to come into existence after separating himself from God.
-   **Poppy O'Possum** opens with one being told by the title character to her daughter, which explains why opossums can't use magic, as well as why they're the victims of Fantastic Racism.
-   **Children of Eldair** begins with a telling of how the God and Goddess created Eldair and planted their children on it. Later another one is heard from the Elves perspective.
-   **Kill Six Billion Demons** has one, involving The Creator having both never existed and always having existed, having commited suicide to bring the universe into existence and yet being present after their death. It is also outright stated to be a lie by the same Creator's scriptures, lying being an essential foundation of the Universe.
    
    Let there be no Genesis, for beginnings are false and I am a Consummate Liar.
    
-   **Unsounded**: It's generally agreed that the Twin Gods created and then remade the world. The First World was The Time of Myths, where the Gods embodied their flights of fancy as ageless Senet Beasts to drive the forces of nature and serve various other purposes. They then refined their designs into the Second World and the Background Magic Field underlying it, where mortal life arose through guided evolution.
    
    **Matty:** At the beginning of all, the Twin Gods were alone in an ocean of chaos. They knew **everything!** Father Riv's skull was near to bursting with it! So he laid close to Mother Yerta and fed her his thoughts. Some she spit out, some she gobbled up. Soon a golden light began to shine in her belly.  
    **Sette:** Da says they had **sex.**  
    **Matty:** Please don't be horrible.
    
-   **Alienby Comics**: "Self-Creation" is based on Christian creation myths, something Riri points out in the description from being raised evangelical. The comic itself entails a goddess that represents Riri's true self helping revitalise - and physically transition - a tired, closeted Riri.

Creation Myth Example in Web Original

-   Many in **The Wanderer's Library**. How Grandmother Triode Stole Binary from the Sun is one told by a computer program.
-   **RWBY**: The Tale of Two Brothers is a children's story about the creation of humanity. The God of Light spent his days creating life: plants, animals, water, etc., while the God of Darkness created forces of destruction in an attempt to undo his brother's works: fire, flood, famine, were all attributed to him, as was the the creation of the Creatures of Grimm. Eventually, they decide to forge a truce, putting aside their differences to create a single masterpiece together that they can both be proud of. That masterpiece is humanity, blessed by the two gods to have the ability to both create and destroy, along with the knowledge to choose which path to follow. Satisfied with their work, the two brothers departed from the world for destinations unknown. What the world doesn't know is that there is at least a kernel of truth to this tale. The four divine gifts of Creation, Destruction, Knowledge and Choice exist in physical form as four Relics. The Big Good has spent thousands of years trying to protect the Relics from the Big Bad, who needs them for mysterious reasons. Eventually, the Big Good created the four Huntsmen Academies and the very concept of the Huntsman, an elite warrior fully trained in Aura and Semblance, to protect the four Relics; the show currently takes place during a time when the Big Bad has just figured out where the Relics are, and is attempting to destroy the Academies and the whole of humanity.
-   Skyrim Apotheosis presents its own twist on the Elder Scrolls creation myth detailed under Video Games. According to this, "Sithis was the start of the House", the first entity. He broke apart the nothingness around him, and fashioned the pieces into ideas and possibilities. One of the ideas, the demon Anui-El (the elven version of Anu), became jealous, because as an idea, its lifespan was limited. Gathering friends around it, it created the worlds of Nirn, enslaving everything that was in their permanent world. "Thus are the Aedra, the false gods".

Creation Myth Example in Western Animation

-   ''Adam (1992)' is a satire of Genesis in which a disembodied hand of God creates Adam from clay (it's a claymation short) and screws with him for a while.
-   Parodied in **My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic** when Pinkie Pie finishes the borderline-nonsensical (and possibly inaccurate) story of how she got her cutie mark by declaring, "And that's how Equestria was made!" She follows this up by offering to later tell the story of how she got her cutie mark.
    -   Later, we see an annual pageant for a Christmas-analogue holiday which gives the actual creation myth of the nation of Equestria (though not the world). It may or may not be historically accurate.
