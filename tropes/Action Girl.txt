Action Girl: 
This is what it means to fight like a girl.

_"I'm a big haymaker in a title fight._  
_I'm a cute black kitten with a nasty bite._  
_I'm an action double-feature on a Friday night!_  
_I'm me!"_

An Action Girl is a female badass who is tough and kicks butt. Damsel in Distress? Not her (mostly). She's featured in far more than the Designated Girl Fight. She faces dangerous foes and deadly obstacles, and she _wins_. She's a fairly common character in the Action Genre.

For the longest time in many cultures, Double Standards in both fiction and Real Life meant that when it came to action and fighting, guys definitely outnumbered girls. Men Act, Women Are was the rule of thumb, which led to the Action Girl being a subversion of what was acceptable. As society has marched on, this view has faded in some media, leading to stories where Action Girls become the norm rather than the exception, such as stories set in a World of Badass, and especially a World of Action Girls.

The broad Action Girl concept can take many forms. Faux Action Girl is a case of presenting a character as this, only for them not to live up to the standards of this trope. Dark Action Girl is the villainous (or at least morally ambiguous) variety, and Affirmative Action Girl is a cast addition intended to balance out gender ratios that typically also falls under this trope. Less action-y versions include You Go, Girl!, Plucky Girl, and Passionate Sports Girl (although they can mix if her chosen sport is a combat sport).

This is somewhat of a Cyclic Trope, with Action Girls often having surges in popularity in the 1940s, 1970s, 1990s and 2010s, probably not coincidentally times when the women's movement increased in prominence. Action Girls are nigh-omnipresent in modern action films, especially as the love interest or sister of a male Action Hero. Of course, this doesn't mean lesbian Action Girls don't exist.

Action Girl Example in Asian Animation

-   **Happy Heroes**: Sweet S. is a downplayed example. Her main superpower is creating bubbles rather than an actual attack, and she's nowhere near as strong as the other Supermen, but she's still a heroine who can and will help the other Supermen fight evil whenever it's needed.

---
Action Girl Example in Films — Animation

-   **Balto**: Jenna is willing to fight a furious bear far larger than she is and has no qualms with standing up to Steele, something many of the male dogs in the film are too afraid to do. Sadly for the fans, she ends up fading into the background in the other two films. Her daughter Aleu in the second movie also gets to be badass, but unfortunately she quickly falls into Faux Action Girl territory.
-   **The Book of Life**:
    -   Maria Posada. When Manolo and Joaquin start a swordfight over her, she picks up a sword and disarms them both in a single move. And that's before the bandits show up. During her travels, she has learned fencing and kung-fu.
    -   The Adelita Twins. Both of them due to having fought in the revolution as **soldaderas**.
-   **Brave**: Merida, who is awesome with a bow and arrow.

-   **Disney Animated Canon**:
    -   **The Little Mermaid**: Ariel is one of the first Disney Princesses to fight villains directly, fighting off a shark, saving Eric from drowning in a storm, and taking out Ursula's eels in the climax. Eric does rescue her from Ursula in the very end, but that's not her fault.

-   **The Hunchback of Notre Dame**: Esmeralda, who, during the Festival of Fools, successfully fights off several of Frollo's guards, and is the one to rescue a wounded Phoebus from drowning the river after he's shot by said guards in a later scene.
-   Fa Mulan. Perhaps one of the best examples of an Action Girl in the entire canon and the first chronogical one at that. After going through combat training, Mulan is perfectly capable of taking on Huns using a sword, a bow-and-arrow, a gunpowder cannon, and even a fan; she even manages to stand against their leader with a bit of cleverness and a cleverly timed foot sweep. In fact, she has the highest kill count of **any** Disney character.
-   **Atlantis: The Lost Empire**: Audrey Ramirez (the mechanic) and Kidagakash "Kida" Nedakh (the Atlantean princess).
-   **Treasure Planet**: Captain Amelia is a fabulous example, voiced by the lovely Emma Thompson. One example is during the Permusa black hole sequence, where she manages to steer the ship back under control after the helmsman (a big and equally strong snail/octopus man, mind you) is nearly thrown from the steering wheel. She is notable for being the **only** Action Girl of the entire cast.
-   **Bolt** has Penny (the onscreen version, anyway), particularly in the opening; it's implied she does all of her own stunts. Mittens has her moments as well.
-   **Tangled**: Rapunzel sets off on a whole adventure of her own free will, and fends off lots of opponents with both her hair and a frying pan. She also saves her love interest on several occasions, just to put icing on the cake. This continues in her own series.
-   **Wreck-It Ralph**: Sergeant Calhoun from **Hero's Duty**. A grizzled Space Marine with a Crazy-Prepared attitude, she fights her enemies the Cy-Bugs with a rifle, pistol, and knife.
    -   Vanellope from **Sugar Rush** also counts, in a Badass Adorable kind of way, considering she's a Badass Driver and the one to save Ralph from falling from the sky during the climax. Also, as the true ruler of **Sugar Rush**, she's **the** Badass Driver in the game.
-   **Frozen**:
    -   Played with Princess Anna, who is written to be a more realistic example than most examples on this page, considering (on one hand) she is a Badass Normal in comparison to her sister Elsa. On the other hand, the character she was originally based on, Gerda, is considered to be more of an Action Survivor.
    -   In the first film, when helping Kristoff fight off the wolves, she holds her own and bludgeons one of them with Kristoff's lute before burning Kristoff's bedroll and throwing it to stop another in its tracks. In the end, after sacrificing her life for Elsa and returning back to life, she punches Hans in the face with enough force to knock him off a ship.
    -   In the second film, despite her lack of powers and involvement in direct combat, she proves instrumental in saving the day more than proves her bravery by the end. Specifically, she climbs her way out of a cave, leaps from one cliff edge to another, confronts a group of rock giants and gets them to destroy a dam she lures them to by standing on it so they'd throw boulders at it before leaping away when it starts to crumble.
    -   Elsa herself, meanwhile, is a full-fledged Action Heroine, albeit a reluctant one at that. As the token super of the main cast, her main problem-solving method is using her powers to blast ice at things. It's how she deals with the wind spirit and the water spirit, freezing the wind spirit and beating the water spirit in battle with her ice magic. It also plays a key role in how she deals with the fire spirit, blasting ice before charming it with ice flakes after it becomes clear it's a super-adorable and cuddly salamander. Although, she usually doesn't want to hurt anyone intentionally, even two guys clearly sent to kill her by the Duke of Weselton. When it's made clear that it's her or them, however, she becomes **brutal**.
-   **Big Hero 6**: GoGo Tomago and Honey Lemon are just as integral to the eponymous team as the other male members, and prove to be skilled combatants with their abilities (super speed and chemical explosions, respectively) in battle.
    -   The former is a Badass Driver who was probably the first who Jumped at the Call and grows to become particularly skilled with her discs in combat, which serve as throwing weapons and shields. In the first fight against Yokai, she's the only one who gives him a challenge. The series also reveals that she likes boxing.
    -   The latter is a Badass Bookworm and Action Fashionista who uses a purse containing her chemical concoctions which, when used, take the form of small balls/bombs to help during fights, usually for either trapping opponents or blowing some stuff up.
-   **Zootopia**: Judy Hopps. A young bunny rabbit from the countryside who dreams of becoming a police officer in the titular big city, she undergoes ZPD training, which obviously includes combat training. In fact, during the Training Montage, Judy develops the skill and agility to knock out a Rhino sparring partner by jumping fiercely into the ring ropes, bouncing off them into the Rhino's gloved fist and using her strong legs to kick his fist into his face.
-   **Moana**: The 16-year-old daughter of a Polynesian/South Pacific chief, Moana Waialiki is a tough, proactive heroine from the get-go. When her home is in danger of perishing, she sets off on The Hero's Journey, fights off a whole bunch of evil Kakamora on a battleship, stands up to Te Kā, and - in a **marvelous** climax - restores the heart of Te Fiti. She has received positive comparisons to the previously mentioned **Mulan**.
-   **Raya and the Last Dragon**: The titular Raya herself, who also received **Mulan** comparisons. The daughter of Chief Benja of the Heart Tribe, she has been training to become the Guardian of the Dragon Gem ever since she was a young girl. Said training involves hand-to-hand combat, swordplay, and even arnis sticks, skills that have vastly improved in the present day. Only Namaari can match her.
    -   Namaari herself falls under the Dark Action Girl category. While she is not a straightforward villain (as she acts only for the safety of her people), she is the most prominent force acting against the heroes, a ruthless warrior princess with skills on par with Raya, her Foil.

-   **Happy Feet Two**: Boadicea - a penguin chick who can do Le Parkour.
-   **How to Train Your Dragon**: In this setting, all vikings are warriors who fight against dragons, including the women. The two most prominently featured ones are Astrid, the protagonist's Love Interest and Ruffnut, one half of the Plucky Comic Relief Half-Identical Twins.

-   **9**: 7 is the only girl out of the group , and makes her entrance by decapitating the Cat Beast in one swing.

-   Princess Fiona from **Shrek**; in the first movie, she takes out Robin Hood and his merry men when they attempt to give her an Unwanted Rescue.
-   **Space Jam**: Lola Bunny, who is almost as famous for her basketball skills as she is for her Ms. Fanservice design. **Space Jam: A New Legacy** emphasizes this aspect of her character, to the point of making her a literal Amazon warrior.
-   **Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse**: Spider-Gwen, Peni Parker and surprisingly Aunt May. On the villain's side, there's Olivia "Liv" Octavius.
-   **The Steam Engines of Oz**:
    -   Victoria is a Wrench Wench who keeps the gears of Oz turning, but in her first real fight she takes on three lions and very nearly gets the best of them.
    -   The lioness Lucilla is one half of a Battle Couple with her mate Magnus.

Action Girl Example in Music

-   The Aquabats!: "Danger Woman!" from **Myths, Legends, and Other Amazing Adventures** is about a superheroine from the Feedbackverse.
    
    She’s hanging off the chopper  
    And no one’s gonna stop her  
    Don’t try and call the doctor  
    ‘Cause she’s jumpin’ around now  
    Handle bar standing  
    And flying over canyons  
    No hands on the landing  
    Now we’re rollin’ around on the ground
    
-   David Bowie's song "She's Got Medals".
-   Disturbed features one in the final sequence for its music video, "Indestructible". The other wiki even mentions the significance of featuring a female soldier among its pantheon of legendary warriors.
-   The Flaming Lips, "Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots" (Her name is Yoshimi / She's a black belt in karate...)
-   Jex Thoth, "Warrior Woman".
-   Slymenstra Hymen, Estrogina Lugubrious, and Vulvatron of GWAR.
-   Machinae Supremacy has a song called "Action Girl".
-   The music video for Nana Mizuki and TM Revolution's "Kakumei Dualism" featured the two singers duelling in an arena, dressed as a ninja/assassin and Roman centurion, respectively.
-   P!nk in the video for "Trouble".
    -   P!nk in real life, too. In her "I'm Not Dead" tour, she did a full-fledged Cirque de Soleil act forty feet above a stage **that had no padding and no net**. While singing the entire song live. Every single night. This tour, she's doing a song with a trapeze act that starts out with her **blindfolded**.
-   "Super Girl (Buttercup)" by Shonen Knife.
-   Woody Guthrie's "Miss Pavlichenko" is about the real-life Soviet sniper Lyudmilla Pavlichenko, who killed 300 Nazis.
-   Sabaton
    -   "Lady of the Dark" is about Milunka Savić, a Serbian woman who dressed as a man to take the place of her brother when he was conscripted for the First Balkan War. After ten deployments, she was discovered when she was wounded, but she had been such a good soldier that they didn't want to punish her, instead allowing her to serve openly in the infantry when she refused to be transferred to nursing. She went on to serve in World War I in the Serbian and later Yugoslav armies, becoming the most decorated female soldier in the recorded history of warfare, including becoming the sole female recipient of the Croix de Guerre with gold palm. And then was practically forgotten as soon as the war was over.
    -   "Night Witches" is about Russia's predominantly female 588th Night Bomber Regiment who flew in World War II and terrified the German army with their stealthy bombing runs. Flying mostly at night, they would cut the engines on their plywood and canvas planes in order to silently glide over their target, leaving the enemy none the wiser until the bombs started falling.

Action Girl Example in Myths & Religion

-   The Scythians, which in Real Life had female warriors and their most well known rulers are war mongering queens like Tomyris, had Tabiti as their Top God. Other deities like Argimpasa and Api had kurgan depictions holding decapitated heads.
-   The Bible:
    -   In Chapter 4 of Judges, Deborah, a prophetess and leader (or "judge") of Israel, leading her people to victory against a foreign enemy. Boudicea-like, she is a skilled charioteer.
    -   In the same story there's Jael, the wife of one of Deborah's generals, who put a tent peg through an enemy king's head. She's more of a Guile Hero, however, having manipulated the guy first before killing him when distracted.
    -   Rahab, the madame of a brothel, gleans secrets from enemy soldiers in moments of distraction and passes them to the Israelites who are besieging the city.
    -   There's also Plucky Girl Judith, who tricks an enemy general and cuts his head off to free the Jews from him.
-   In **The Death of Koshchei the Deathless**, Princess Marya Morevna is apparently a fierce and vicious warrior. However, she does come off as a bit of a Faux Action Girl when Koshchei the Deathless kidnaps her, turning her into a Damsel in Distress and forcing her Non-Action Guy husband to go on a quest to save her.
-   Egyptian mythology has Sekhmet, the very bloodthirsty lion-headed war goddess with titles like "Mistress of Dread" and "Lady of Slaughter".
-   Greek mythology features goddesses Athena, goddess of wisdom/intelligence, justice and war and Artemis, goddess of hunting, nature and the Moon.
    -   Many goddesses actually, rather ironically given the patriarchal Greek culture. Hera was at times worshipped with a warrior aspect, and kicked the crap out of Artemis in the Trojan War. Selene, the Moon goddess, fought against freaking Typhon, many primordial goddesses are clearly much more powerful than Zeus himself (Nyx, for starters, which is why he never messes with her children), and Aphrodite had not only associations with war, but many nasty epithets associated with death and violence.
    -   Also, the mortal heroine Atalanta, who was best known as a huntress (and unsurprisingly a devout follower of Artemis). She was the first to injure the Calydonian Boar, took part in Jason's quest for the Golden Fleece.
-   Durga<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>, from Hindu Mythology, is the goddess of victory of good over evil and very, very good at killing demons.
-   St. Margaret of Antioch, also called Margaret the Dragon Slayer. Margaret fought off the advances of a local governor and was thrown into a dungeon with a dragon **which she subdued with a crucifix.** In art, the crucifix is actually a spear or longsword, the hilt forming the cross, and she battles the dragon in the same manner as St. George. After defeating the dragon, Satan appeared to her, and she wrestled him to the ground<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>. She is also one of the saints that Joan of Arc claimed appeared to her.
-   The character of Hua Mulan, known for joining the army in place of her elderly father and too-young brother, fighting to the West of China, then going home and eventually dying of old age.
-   Norse Mythology:
    -   Freyja, the leader of the Valkyries. When she gets angry, she can make the whole of Asgard shake.
    -   Sunna, who is on war with evil sky wolves, and actually left behind the Sowilo rune, which symbolises victory.
    -   The valkyries are basically an Amazon Brigade of death incarnate.
-   In some depictions, Maid Marian of the **Robin Hood** legends. There's even a ballad (one of the Child Ballads) where Marian went to seek Robin, armed and in man's clothes, and when she met him, he was also in disguise — so they fought, for "at least an hour or more", before recognizing each other. Ironically, Marian started out as an Action Girl only for much later Hollywood adaptations (as in Errol Flynn's **The Adventures of Robin Hood**) to cast her as the Damsel in Distress. Only recently has she regained her original Action Girl status (Judi Trott in **Robin of Sherwood** and Lucy Griffiths in **Robin Hood**), though just as often she comes across as a Faux Action Girl (as in Kevin Costner's **Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves**).
-   Mai Bhago was a Sikh woman who rallied fleeing warriors with her urges and taunts and her leadership ability and took them into battle against the forces of the Grand Mogul. As all Sikh women are princesses (which is what the common female surname Kaur, means), perhaps she would also be a Pretty Princess Powerhouse. She's revered as a saint in Sikhism, sometimes called the "Sikh Joan of Arc".
-   Nora of Kelmendi in Albanian legends was considered the greatest warrior woman in Albania (as well as the most beautiful one being compared to Helen of Troy), being born into a Roman Catholic warrior clan from the highlands and trained by her father since he had no sons to help him fight against the Ottoman Empire. She killed an Ottoman warlord in a duel after refusing his proposal to join his harem because the law of Albanian **Kanum** forbade marriage with non-Albanians. According to one version of the legend, she also led an army of 300 women into battle to defend her village from his army.
-   Victorious viking chief Odd of "The Story of King Odd" is actually a disguised woman.
-   The fairy tale character, Tatterhood (no relation to Little Red Riding Hood). She fights trolls (in some versions witches) while wielding a spoon and riding on a goat.
-   Celtic Mythology has Scathach, the warrior maiden who put the folk hero Cu Chulainn through Training from Hell.

Action Girl Example in Pinball

-   The unnamed woman on the backglass of Atari's **Middle Earth** pinball, who's slashing at the giant gorilla with a Laser Blade while a Kaiju prepares to bite her head off.
-   The Valkyrie in **Dungeons & Dragons (1987)**, who's hacking away at the fire-breathing dragon even as it has her in its claws.
-   Captain Rose of **Black Rose** is an unabashed Pirate Girl.
-   **Raven** was **supposed** to be one, but ended up coming across as a Faux Action Girl instead.

Action Girl Example in Podcasts

-   **The Adventure Zone: Balance**: At least one major example every plot arc, with the exception of **The Eleventh Hour** (which is a more exploration-heavy arc). The first has Killian, a crossbow-wielding orc packing the ability to animate golems. The second has Jess, a pit fighter who wields an axe. The third has two: Hurley, a constabulary lieutenant with a black belt in ass-kicking, and Sloane, the apparent villain of the arc who Curb-Stomps our heroes in her first appearance. The fourth arc has Killian return with her teammate, Carey Fangbattle, a Dragonborn Rogue and sister of Jeremy "Scales" Fangbattle. The sixth has Antonia, an elven mercenary, and Lup, who manages to kill 50% of the big bad duo despite being stuck in an umbrella for the whole arc. The seventh has Lup, and Lucretia ascends to this after episode 65. Taako lampshades this when he says "There must be a competent woman who can bail us out".
-   All the heroes in **Jemjammer** are this. Ælfgifu is a ranger so she's obvious, Cacphony the Bard will happily fight off villains with her rapier, and Jylliana the Cleric is actually the only party member wearing plate armour (not to mention her giant warhammer). There's also the NPC Captain Alana Bondar, who the party assists in reclaiming her ship and has a gun strong enough to disintegrate giant spiders in a single shot.
-   **Red Panda Adventures**:
    -   Kit Baxter was initially recruited by the Red Panda as a chauffeur for his secret identity because she was a fearless, talented driver. When she inevitably caught on to the Red Panda's actual activities, her response was to demand to be let in. From this the superhero the Flying Squirrel was born. The Red Panda's training, coupled with her own action-oriented personality and a lifetime watching boxing at her father's gym has made her every bit The Dreaded to the criminals of Toronto as her boss. When Kit is benched and becomes Mission Control during the later stages of her pregnancy, police chief O'Malley remarks that he knows the Flying Squirrel has been less active because there have been fewer crooks being brought in with bodily injury. One of the books also describes Kit's battle cry as a mix of fury and joy.
    -   The Flying Squirrel's best friend is the Grey Fox, resident superhoerine of Vancouver. The **reason** they're best friends is that the Grey Fox is every bit the fight-loving brawler Kit herself is. "Girl's Night Out" has the two uncovering a Nazi sabotage ring in the Fox's city. The Grey Fox displays how she gets information by threatening and, if need be, beating up whoever she has to. The Squirrel, in turn, teaches the Grey Fox how to use threats of drops from rooftops to interrogate suspects. In "The Lost Sheep", the Flying Squirrel wants to find out what happened to a boy she had tried and failed to keep out of the army after he enlisted. Since she feels the Red Panda won't go along with her on this one, she calls the Grey Fox to help her out.
-   All the **Sequinox** girls, naturally, though to different degrees. Yuki is an introvert outside of battle, but when transformed is usually the first to attack with magic. Chell and Hannah are both athletes with sick abs, so that carries over as well. Sid has knives. Most Stars are also female and are very happy to fight the Sequinox girls.

Action Girl Example in Tabletop Games

-   Special note should go out to the granddaddy of most Table Top Role Playing Games, **Dungeons & Dragons**. Fair for Its Day in the seventies, it allowed females in all roles. There was a problematic limitation on female characters' Strength scores in the earliest editions, but as early as 1989's **Advanced Dungeons & Dragons** 2nd Edition, the rules made males and females entirely equal with females completely able to take on any Action Girl role without limits.
-   **BattleTech**: A LOT of them throughout the setting. Unsurprising given that mechanized warfare is king, although many women are quite formidable even without; a standout is female Clan Elementals, who due to the Clans' genetic engineering and breeding programs are just as much hulking masses of Powered Armor\-combat-optimized muscle as their male counterparts.
-   In Chess, the Queen is the most powerful of all pieces.
-   **Psionics: The Next Stage in Human Evolution**: The Scream in Tomorrow’s Starlight is a necrokinetic martial artist that mixes both skill sets. She charges head on into hand to hand combat with enemies, despite being seemingly outgunned and at a physical disadvantage, and is highly capable with telekinesis.

-   In **Unicornus Knights**, Princess Cornelia, Donia, Mirza and Fara are all capable combatants. On The Empire's side, Lyla is the best example, being a famous general, but Marianne and Rozie are no slouches either.
-   The entire organization of the Sisters of Battle in **Warhammer 40,000**, as well as the Eldar Howling Banshees. Howling Banshees have only female models, but the entire Aspect is only described as majority female.
    -   More Specifically, the Tau Empire's military Commander Shadowsun and the Farsight Enclave's Commander Torchstar are two of the few non-Sisters of Battle female special characters.
    -   The Tau also feature plenty of female rank-and-file troops in the current (early 2016) books, and there are female Tau heads in the current (early 2016) model kits. Tau wear enough armor that a male and female Tau do not look any different when suited up, and no special mention is made of Tau females in their cadres. Likewise, no mention is made of Shadowsun's gender being unusual for a supreme commander personally leading combat. This suggests that **half** of the entire Tau Empire military are Action Girls.

-   Poptropica: If you play as a girl, your character can defintely count as one. She takes on Zeus himself. Twice. And beats him both times. She also defeats a bunch of other villains, and is a superhero, a pirate, a cowgirl, etc.

Action Girl Example in Theatre

-   **Aida**. While the musical isn't that action-oriented, the title character **does** display some skill wih a sword in an early scene, and plenty of gumption and backbone throughout.
-   Odabella in **Attila**, who fights against the Huns along with an entire Amazon Brigade. She earns the approval of her enemies, and Attila himself is smitten with her when he sees her unflinching courage.
-   Nala and the lionesses in **The Lion King**, just like in the movie. However, not only are they more prominent in this version, they become Dance Battlers.
-   Ariel in **The Little Mermaid**, for the same reasons as in the movie, with the added bonus that in the stage version, she defeats the villain, Ursula, instead of Eric. Not bad for a Disney Princess!
-   Ruth in **Pirates of Penzance**. Near the end of the play, a hilarious fight scene breaks out between the pirates and the police, with Ruth participating in it right along with the rest of them.
-   Agnes Evans is the protagonist of the play **She Kills Monsters**, and plays through a **Dungeons & Dragons** campaign as the audience is treated to a whole D&D aesthetic, in which Agnes does precisely what the title states. The role requires an actress to perform plenty of stage combat, with suitably awesome fight scenes.
    -   Her sister Tilly (Tillius in the game), and player characters Lilith and Kaliope (Lily and Kelly in "real life") also have some great fight scenes as characters in the D&D world. This is one of the relatively few plays to feature actresses in heavy doses of stage combat.
-   Ken Kudwig's version of **The Three Musketeers** includes Sabine, an original character who's D'Artagnan's sister and joins him on his quest. Her actress is required to learn enough stage combat for the end, where she fights and kills Milady de Winter.
-   Much of the work produced at Vampire Cowboy Theatre in NYC features Nerd-cum-Badass-cum-Troperiffice Comedies that heavily feature Badass Women. The above mentioned "She Kills Monsters", "Alice in Slasherland", "Fight Girl Battle World" and more all feature this particular Trope.
-   A play called **The Warrior's Husband** has Antiope, Hippolyta, and the entire Amazon army. It takes place in Pontus, the land of Amazons, where the traditional gender roles are reversed. So this trope is naturally going to be present.

Action Girl Example in Visual Novels

-   Trixie Dixon, girl detective, of **Black Jack Justice**. She's every bit her partner Jack's equal as a detective and just as good in a firefight as he is, even with Jack's being a war veteran. She regularly keeps a barretta pistol in her purse and a small gun Jack jokingly calls the "mouse trap" strapped to her leg. At minimum.
-   **Broken Bonds**:
    -   Li'lu is a raging sprite wielding a greataxe.
    -   Bryan is a deadly monk.
-   A staple of **The Colmaton Universe**, as the majority of prominent superheroes in the series are heroines.
-   Every female character in **Compelled Dual** qualifies. Special mention goes to Phirora Valcyne, the female lead and the chosen one of an almost-forgotten goddess.
-   Almost every female character from **Darwin's Soldiers**, though Snow, Dr. Joe, Aimee, Sharon and Aisha deserve special mention.
-   TT and Lala from **Cream Heroes** are this in cat form. They punch other cats when they're annoyed, they pounce and play with the toys Claire brings them and both of them absolutely love running on the cat wheel.
-   Foxy from **Dead Ends** is just as good at fending off the undead as the male characters. She even decapitates a would-be rapist with a katana!
-   Suprisingly for a game based on a LEGO theme with a cast consisting entirely of four men, **Dino Attack RPG** has had quite its share of action girls over the years of all kinds. To name a few specifically:
    -   Amanda Claw: A former bounty hunter who still put her old skills to good use.

-   Cabin: A qualified helicopter pilot, practically second-in-command when it comes to taking action in the skies.

-   Maria: A lesbian action girl with a firmly feminist attitude that came from growing up in a sexist society.

-   Sarah Bishop: Oh boy, where to begin. Bludgeoned a man in the head (plus Cabin- an innocent bystander), shot who knows how many mooks working for XERRD, and single-handedly fought off Spy Clops (a giant spider-like cyborg) in **a burning room**... all to protect her daughter.
-   Zealot: Refused to leave the GAIA Squad's side in the battle for Mount Bricklake.

-   **The Gods Are Bastards** Fairly common, since one of the major deities of the setting is a goddess of both warfare and feminism. Her paladin is one of the main characters, and naturally also female.
-   In **Greek Ninja**, Sasha, Eleonora, Electra and demigoddess Danae Elliades, although it's more of an informed attribute in her case.
-   **Hero House** Gives us She-ra and the Wasp, among a host of others.

-   All of the female characters in **Kadu'av**. Eden and Rachel are both well trained mercenaries who are skilled swords women, Gunari has cut down men to save her daughter, and said daughter, Tasaria, is revealed to be **ridiculously** powerful.
-   **The Kindness of Devils**: Pick any major female character and they'll fall under this category. Even Erin Hasegawa has no problem facing off against vampires, werewolves, and friggin' **Nyarlathotep**.
-   In **Moonrise**, Many of the she-cats are just as strong, if not stronger than, the toms. In fact, at one point in time, literally every single Clan leader was female- in fact, most of both Flame Clan's leaders have all been female, most notably Robinstar, Dovestar, Skullstar, and Rowanstar.
-   **Mahu** has several in his "Second Chance" narrative let's play, including Commonwealth admirals Shu Lin and Ibrahim. Each one is a veteran commander and victor in dozens of engagements both within and beyond the frontiers of their Republic.
-   **The Never Mythos** has Eliza Cortly, a powerful Seer who uses her powers to fight off malicious deities and monsters from an alternate dimension.
-   Kit Baxter, a.k.a. the Flying Squirrel, from **Red Panda Adventures**. When she realized the man she drove around as chauffeur was Toronto's resident superhero, she demanded she be let in on it. Not long into this partnership, she's at least on par with the Red Panda in nearly any crime fighting situation and is just as, if not more, prone to saving the Panda from distress as the reverse.

-   **Resident Evil Abridged**: Jill is the primary example, given she was able to navigate much of the Spencer Mansion on her own, with little assistance from her partner, Barry Burton. In the final scene, she and Rebecca cover the team's escape by holding off a wave of zombies.
-   **Scrambled Egg** has Sonya and Tanya, two vigilante Magic Knights who both know how to attack in an offensive and defensive manner.
-   Taz in **Starship**. She even declares herself leader by ripping off Up's mustache and putting it on herself.
-   A lot of **Survival of the Fittest** characters, examples including Maxie Dasai, Trish McCarroll, Shameeca Mitchell, Bridget Connolly and Hayley Kelly.

-   Channel Awesome:
    -   MarzGurl in **Kickassia**. Complete with punching her troops into shape.
    -   And continued in **Suburban Knights**, while acting as San. She can swing a mean spear.

-   Rebecca Stone in **Demo Reel**. Quirky, Nerves of Steel, and would have been more than happy to beat a guy twice her size to death.

-   **This Is War** has several, including Rebecca "Tex" Church who works as the less-than legal debt collector for a less-than legal gang.
-   In the Spanish **DestripandoLaHistoria**, Mulan, Rapunzel and Snow White are action girls, since they are that way in their original tales.
-   Tasha of **Touch (2017)** is a self-confident girl with a Batman complex and super strength, who uses her powers to mug drug dealers, break people's hands, and punch things.

-   Since the **Whateley Universe** is a superhero world, it's not surprising that every female main character is this. Except Summoner, who's a White Mage and Squishy Wizard right now. Plus several auxiliary characters like the headmistress (who is Lady Astarte in her spare time) and a bunch of the female teachers.

Action Girl Example in Web Animation

-   If Episode 20 of **Cow of the Wild** is any indication, Mink was one. So is Sharp, the female alpha of the Pack of Falling Stars.
-   Octavia in **Once Upon a Time in Canterlot**, a **My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic** fan video. "Eat grass, kick ass" indeed.

-   **Red vs. Blue**:
    -   Tex, more than capable of easily handling entire outposts on her own. The only character noted to be tougher than her in combat was the superhuman Meta, and only because he had a bunch of abilities he stole from other people. Without them, he had to gang up on her 2 against 1 to beat her.
    -   **Any** female Freelancer qualifies as this, to one degree or another. Say what you want about South, but Season 9 shows she's quite the badass. And Carolina wiped the floor with an even **larger** number of troops, single-handedly. CT initially seems to be an exception to this, but as is discovered in Season 10, she's actually able to hold her own fairly well against both Tex **and** Carolina until she was killed, of course.
