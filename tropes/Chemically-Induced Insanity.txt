Chemically-Induced Insanity: 
Pictured: what happens when one is given a dose of Rajaijah Juice.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

Despite being perfectly sane, a character is given drugs that make people around him think that he is insane. This is usually done maliciously and without the character's knowledge. Frequently done to get a character out of the way when killing them would be too messy, or simply to discredit them.

Often this would be maintained by having a caregiver giving the patient "medicine" to treat their mental illness, but in reality is dosing them to keep them insane. May be administered by Slipping a Mickey and/or Water Source Tampering. Can overlap with Go Mad from the Revelation if Higher Understanding Through Drugs opens the mind to secrets not meant for mortals to perceive.

Compare Psycho Serum where a character intentionally takes a drug to enhance himself, but it induces insanity as a side effect; also compare Infectious Insanity where insanity is induced by contact with an already insane person, and Mushroom Samba for cases where a character is under the influence of hallucinogens (voluntarily or otherwise). See also Gaslighting, another way in which one character can make another seem insane.

See also Münchausen Syndrome and the "by proxy" variant.

-   **BoBoiBoy**: Adu Du makes "Chemical Emotive X", a serum to toy with the emotions of anyone who consumes it. Sure enough, anyone who eats Yaya's biscuits containing the chemical acts crazy; getting emotional over flat tires, forlorn over having money, or in Gopal's case, a compelling urge to sing and dance. The more BoBoiBoy Wind eats them, the more joyous he gets, even to the extent of Laughing Mad while surrounding himself in a violent Tornado Move. Wind's unbridled joy unlocks his Next Tier Powerup, Cyclone.

This makes them legally responsible for the patient's subsequent episode that led him to kidnap a child and kill two people.
-   Inverted in an episode of **Leverage**, in which Parker checks into an addiction-treatment center as part of the team's latest con, where she is given anti-depressants and becomes temporarily relieved of her kleptomaniacal tendencies.

Later, Mikhail, her replacement, discovers what happened to her and does the same thing to the security agents.

At the border, he's ordered to get out of his car and wait in a room while they search it. He gets so nervous that he starts sweating, which soaks the sheet and causes him to absorb a hundred hits of LSD through his skin. He then starts thinking he is an orange and has to peel himself, so he starts taking off his clothes. To this day, he is stuck in a psychiatric ward, still convinced he is an orange.
