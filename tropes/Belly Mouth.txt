Belly Mouth: 
A classic trope, the "belly mouth" or "bellymaw" is where a creature/character/machine actually has a mouth directly outside from its place in the body. Sometimes it's disguised and well hidden, other times it's used as an intimidation tool, or sign to state that the character in question is a Villainous Glutton, a Big Eater or somewhere in between when regarding the consumption of vast quantities in (usually) organic material, even going so far as to make it out to be a horrifying monster, or from time to time, a _comical_ character.

Note: In some cases, the belly mouth is actually a symbiotic creature, or has a mind of its own, that uses the host's body to get about, while adding an additional passage to the stomach via which more consumables can enter.

For a much more Freudian, disturbing variation on the "mouth in the wrong place" theme, see Vagina Dentata.

Compare Cephalothorax, where the only mouth the creature has is, technically, on its belly.

Sub-Trope of Too Many Mouths.

-   **Mechamato**: As Mechamato's Powered Armor, MechaBot's face lies on the torso's front. In episode 6, because Amato got a rubber tyre stuck above his waist when he transformed into Mechamato, MechaBot's mouth appears on the tyre, much to everyone's disbelief.

-   In **Kill la Kill** (made by the same people that made Gurren Lagann), Senketsu has this as part of its design, which shows up as as a baring of the midriff for Ryuko.
-   Deidara from **Naruto** has mouths on his hands and chest, which he uses to produce an explosive clay in various shapes such as spiders and birds. He turns himself into a Fantastic Nuke if he eats the clay through his chest mouth. Technically it's where his heart is located, but it still counts.
-   **Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann**:
    -   The Gurren Lagann, although this is because the chest and abdomen areas of the combined mech are Gurren's "face" when separated.
    -   Also the implied case with Lazengann Lordgenome's Gunman, which has More Teeth than the Osmond Family, as well as several antagonists' Gunmen.
-   **Digimon**:
    -   VenomMyotismon, a major antagonist of **Digimon Adventure**, develops a second face in his lower abdomen, and this proves to be his weak spot.
    -   In the first **Digimon Tamers** movie, **Battle Of Adventurers**, Mephistomon gets a One-Winged Angel mode in the form of Gulfmon, a colossal demonic centaur with a mouth set into the chest of its quadrupedal lower half. The mouth emits a very destructive Breath Weapon.
    -   In **Digimon Fusion**, Splashmon's quadrupedal water tiger form comprises the quadrupedal lower half of GrandGeneramon, a centauroid mashup of the Seven Death Generals. The placement of the humanoid upper body above it turns what was once Splashmon's regular mouth into a belly-mouth relative to GrandGeneramon's already bizarre body plan. It still has the water-based Breath Weapon, too.
    -   Revivemon of **Digimon Universe: App Monsters** is a black dragon with a belly-face that conceals a cannon in its mouth. It's ambiguous as to whether or not it's just part of his armor since it's made of the same metallic material as the rest of his body.
-   Some of the phantoms in **Tokkô** have this.
-   Feedler from **D.Gray-Man** has a power which, when advanced to its ultimate form, sprouts a grotesque smiling maw stretching from beneath his rib cage to waist line.

-   In one manga chapter and anime episode of **Urusei Yatsura**, a bunch of fossils, put together into the approximate shape of a weird bird by Ataru, are animated by Lum using another piece of Oni tech.

-   In **The Seven Deadly Sins**, Fraudrin of the Ten Commandments has a large mouth hole on his chest and pectorals in place of where it would be on his face.
-   **Yu-Gi-Oh!**: Taken to new levels with Zork, who not only has a mouth, but an entire dragon head and neck protruding from his...crotch.
-   Mashira, Meier Link's werewolf henchman in **Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust**, has an enormous wolf muzzle in his abdomen when he wolfs out.
-   A few demons have this in **3×3 Eyes**: notable cases include Zhou Gui in his One-Winged Angel form (the "mouth" in this case being a black-hole like gateway to the Subspace lined with fangs), and the Hyoma Clan Warrior Prince Galga, who seems to have a knack for forming a whole dragon head and neck from his abdomen and use it to chew and char his enemies. On the other side, Coco has a massive fanged mouth on his chest, but doesn't appear to be functional.
-   Azi Dahaka, one half of the Big Bad Duumvirate in **Future Card Buddyfight**'s first and third seasons, has a face where his chest should be, complete with a fang-filled maw on his abdomen. The finale has him fire one third of his Beam Spam attack as a Breath Weapon from it. This belly-maw also carries over to his One-Winged Angel forms, with his final form in the third season even having two of them.

Belly Mouth Example in Films — Animation

-   One of the crew members on the ship in **Treasure Planet** appears to be a normal-looking human with dreadlocks at first... Before it's revealed that he's a Cephalothorax, with (large) face and mouth are on his (large) stomach, and that what looked like his head was another spider-ish crew member and the things that looked like dreadlocks are really his legs.
-   The Snapping Turks in **Yellow Submarine**.
-   No-Face in **Spirited Away** has one. It's most obvious in the bathhouse scene where he goes berserk, but later in the scene at Zeniba's house you can see it again briefly as he's eating cake.

Belly Mouth Example in Films — Live-Action

-   The Subhumanoids in both sequels to **Class of Nuke 'Em High** have these where the bellybutton should be. They're small, regular human mouths, though, and not particularly monstrous. Which, to some, makes it worse.
-   One of the cases of **Devil Woman Doctor**, a film of the infamously violent **Guinea Pig** series of Japan, is a man who has grown a face-shaped "tumor" on his belly. The "tumor" can talk, sing, bite, and seems to be a cool dude.

-   One of the vampires in **From Dusk Till Dawn** has it. On the surface it merely appears as an ugly, fat and nude female vampire creature before it's revealed its bulging gut hides a monstrous shark-like mouth within. This vampire is briefly seen before it gets killed, but the scene in which it actually uses its Belly Mouth was cut. The vamp was dubbed the "Mouth-Bitch" during production and was infamous for how gruesome it was, so much so that Quentin Tarantino reportedly refused to go near it. It was designed this way as a tribute to **The Thing (1982)** in reference to the scene mentioned below, only with the more lethal and gruesome function of biting off and devouring the victim's head.
-   Professor Ragnar gets one at the climax of **Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go to College!** when the dark magic gets a hold on him.

-   In the 1995 version of **Not of This Earth**, Paul Johnson has a mouth in his stomach which he uses to eat little blob-like aliens.
-   One of the many ways in which the eponymous being in **The Thing (1982)** surprises the humans, and the first time it reveals its ability to take human form, is when a doctor trying to electrically resuscitate a collapsed comrade has his arms bitten off when the Thing opens its chest into a toothy maw before he can zap it further.
-   In **The Thing (2011)**, one Thing diagonally opens its rib cage into a snapping mouth while attempting to kill a female protagonist.
-   Combined with Nested Mouths in **Thirst (2015)**, in which the vaguely centaur-shaped alien has a Lamprey Mouth on an extensible tendril that shoots out of its upper torso's belly.
-   The demon kaiju Grimdo (sorry, **Malicious Demonic Monster Grimdo**) from **Ultraman Taiga The Movie: New Generation Climax** has a second face covering its entire torso, with More Teeth than the Osmond Family.
-   Combined with Vagina Dentata in **Videodrome** when Max gets a vagina-like slit in his abdomen, which occasionally swallows things whole.

-   **The Fat Man**, a short story by Joe R. Lansdale: The title character has what appears to be an ugly half-moon tattoo (with the points upward) on his belly, which turns out to be a mouth.

-   The Jan in **Alien in a Small Town** are nonhumanoid, roughly conical aliens. The main character is a member of the subterranean Worker caste, and has a mouth at his cone's apex, for burrowing.

-   Back in The '90s, Nickelodeon ran a series of live-action shorts featuring characters that consisted of talking belly buttons. They even managed to make one of these shorts basically an anti-smoking PSA.

    -   A second monster, based on a chimera, had this with a lion head, a goat stomach, and a snake tail.
    -   Mandilok from **Power Rangers Wild Force**.
-   **Ultra Series**:

    -   Tyrant, a chimera kaiju from **Ultraman Taro** (who, like Bemstar, also reappears in the series on a regular basis) also has this feature, thanks to Bemstar being one of his components.

Belly Mouth Example in Tabletop Games

-   **Dungeons & Dragons**:
    -   In 3.5 Edition, the Klurichir demon is a massive monster with more mouth than stomach for a belly, even though it has a boar head just above it.
    -   **Monsters of Faerun** describes the Tomb Tapper, a giant humanoid made of stone, which has the mouth on its belly too. Somewhat necessarily, since it's also The Blank and has no facial features whatsoever.
-   Lord Chompy Bits from **Malifaux**.
-   Games Workshop games:
    -   Early models for the Great Unclean One, Greater Daemon of Nurgle from **Warhammer** and **Warhammer 40,000**, were a giant diseased hulk that had a grinning mouth in its belly.
    -   In **Blood Bowl**, the Nurgle Star Player Guffle Pusmaw has been blessed with the mutation of a large mouth situated on his swollen paunch. Guffle has since learned how to use this drooling maw to receive a pass far better he could when using his hands, becoming the most successful Nurgle Catcher in the history of the game.
    -   In the **Epic**, 6mm-scale, version of **Warhammer 40,000** the smaller, close assault focused Slasher Gargants used by the Orks often replaced their belly gun with a set of mechanical jaws known as a Snapper. The Gargant uses these steam powered jaws to rip and tear pieces from enemy Titans, causing massive damage to the target area.
-   **Pathfinder** has scanderigs (also commonly known as forgefiends). They devour metallic ores, which makes them a major nuisance to dwarven settlements.
-   **Villains & Vigilantes** adventure "Devil's Domain". Abomination demons have a malevolent face on their chest, which includes a large mouth.
-   Skittermander whelps in **Starfinder** have these (adding a creepy note to their otherwise overwhelming cuteness), but lose them when they reach adulthood.
    -   Their cousins the stridermanders—which are more-or-less to skittermanders what ogres or trolls are to humans; big, dumb, feral, and entirely willing to eat their smaller kin—never lose the bitey prehensile Lamprey Mouth umbilical cord.

Belly Mouth Example in Toys

-   Mongroid from the **Tortured Souls** line. He's not so much a creature with a Belly Mouth as he is a giant walking mouth with a head and limbs sticking off the sides.
-   Vaka-Waka from **Mixels**, though with the twist that each are their own personality and person. Despite the fact both of them have the ability to eat standardly, Waka, the stomach mouth, is forced to handle the digestion and "output", which isn't good when Vaka eats things like fish heads or battery acid...

Belly Mouth Example in Video Games

-   Dracula's final form in **Castlevania: Bloodlines** is a winged demon with wings, fangs, horns, and a second mouth, not in his belly, but his crotch.
-   Bishamon of **Darkstalkers** series. The mouth in question actually belongs to the armor he wears, not to him, but since he's possessed by the armor, it fits.
-   The Fallen from **Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening** normally appear to be angels with six wings; two on their back, outstretched, two covering (or acting as) their legs, and two acting as arms, the latter wings hold a divine sword and act as a shield, protecting the Fallen from attacks. You can break their shield-wings to reveal a grotesque belly mouth, which, aside from looking pretty horrifying, also serves as the angel's weak spot.
-   Goliath from **Devil May Cry 5** can suck anything close to him into the mouth on his stomach and spit out a huge fire storm or magical fire balls in return.
-   Ghom, the Lord of Gluttony and one of the Act III bosses from **Diablo III** sports such a mouth, which is much larger than his actual mouth on top. This guy takes being a Big Eater to truly nightmarish degrees, such that it is implied that captured soldiers were either eaten by Ghom or fed to others to fatten them up before they were eaten by Ghom.
-   The One-Winged Angel form of Necrosaro/Death Psaro, the final boss in **Dragon Quest IV**, which looks a bit similar to Satannish above.
-   Exdeath, in **Final Fantasy V**, has many mouths in his belly, and also his legs and feet. Growing out of his belly are dragons, lions, demons, and **whole women**.
-   The Zodiac Demon Cuchulainn in **Final Fantasy Tactics**.
-   Elvis, one the evil Elite Four from **God Hand** has this in his demon form, as well as one on each of his arm extremities (can't really call them "hands" if they're spheres with mouths).
-   **Harmful Park** have a the giant King boss, whose bulging belly has a smiley face that tries flattening itself on your player characters.
-   The Big Bad of **Holy Umbrella** has one of these. During his short stint as a playable character, you can shoot powerful flame attacks from it. Exaggerated by the final boss, who not only sports one, but his body is made entirely out of interlocked metallic faces.
-   **Half-Life**
    -   The series's regular zombies have their torsos ripped open. They are known to stuff food into their chest "mouths".
    -   The more mutated gonome zombies from **Opposing Force** as well.
-   The Ducky Goose and Drak Quack Dream Eaters in **Kingdom Hearts 3D \[Dream Drop Distance\]** have a very prominent one, from which they generate various party toys and fireworks to attack with. The former's Japanese name (Haraguchi Ahiru) even translates literally into "belly mouth duck". However, the way their heads hang back limply when they run, coupled with the suspiciously eye-like markings above their belly mouths can make one question whether or not they're really just Waddling Heads with a fake head on top.
-   King Dedede gets one during the second phase of his boss fight in **Kirby's Dream Land 3**, courtesy of being being possessed by Dark Matter. Besides an attack where he uses said mouth to try and bite you, he can also reveal an **eye** to shoot dark pellets at you. This returns in a similar fashion in **Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards**, though thanks to Dedede being a **miniboss** this time around, it's much less dangerous.
    -   This trope made a surprise (and rather darker) return in **Kirby: Triple Deluxe**, where Shadow Dedede uses it. This time around there's no getting chased and avoiding being eaten, though in exchange the dark energy fired is **much** more powerful, sometimes ranging into full Bullet Hell. Not only that, but whenever the jaw opens, what seems to be **blood** flies out.
    -   And then King D-Mind uses it in a similar manner to that of Shadow Dedede listed above in **Team Kirby Clash Deluxe** and **Super Kirby Clash**, though without the blood this time. But then it's exaggerated when he Turns Red: The belly grows to **massive** proportions and reveals Dark Mind's giant eyeball form inside, and also flies around trying to bite the Kirbies before floating to the top of the screen and firing lasers from the eye.
-   The Chocobo/Earth Eater monsters in **Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII** have one. They use it to unleash their strongest attacks, though their weak spot is also concealed within it.
-   The Flick'ta in **Marathon** have a vertical mouth that goes from their face to their abdomen. This gives them the appearance of ferocious predators, but according to a Pfhor science terminal, they only use this mouth as a filter to drain nutrients from surrounding water.
-   My Singing Monsters has Whaill, the plasma quad with not only 5 mouths on its face and hands, but an extra one on its belly. If one listens to their song for too long, they can begin to tear apart the fabric of space time.
-   **Pokémon** has four:
    -   **Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire** introduced Metagross, though this is more a consequence of its body type. Its Pokédex entry in **Sapphire** and some later games state that it eats its prey using the large mouth on its stomach.
    -   **Pokémon Diamond and Pearl** introduced Dusknoir, the evolution of Dusclops. According to its Pokédex entry, the mouth leads to the Underworld. It uses it as its actual mouth, given that its "regular" head has no mouth.
    -   **Pokémon Sun and Moon** introduced the Ultra Beast Guzzlord (UB-05 Glutton), which has a small, cone-shaped head mounted on a body with a huge maw and two eyes accompanied by eyebrow-like protrusions. Like Dusknoir, it uses its main belly mouth as its actual mouth.
    -   **Pokémon Sword and Shield** introduced Mr. Rime, the evolution of the Galarian variant of Mr. Mime. It is based on tap dancers, but for a bizarre, inexplicable design choice its actual face is on its torso, and the face on its head remains expressionless. Somehow, it is both creepy as hell and adorable.
-   The Gnaar of the **Serious Sam** series are monsters without a head, containing a big eye and mouth on its torso.
-   Mondu, final boss of Genesis "fighting" game **Slaughter Sport** has a whole **face** on his ample gut. It can speak (in the game's intro) and flick its tongue as an attack.
-   Nightmare from the **Soul Series** has a mid-section completely compromised of a mouth and teeth.
-   Some creatures in **Spore**
    -   An example is seen here with this creation. This creature has mouths and faces all over its body (tail, belly, legs, feet, etc...) which can even detach, including on its belly, and these developed minds of their own. After the small human head was crushed by **the feet**, it could be considered a Cephalothorax as its only head was on its belly. However, faces formed on the **belly mouth’s belly**.
-   **Subnautica**: The Shadow Leviathan in **Below Zero** has a glowing blue mouth on its belly, and uses its centipede-like legs to capture prey (including the player) and drag them inside to be digested alive.
-   **Super Ghouls 'n' Ghosts**: In stage 6, bosses Asutaroto, Nebiroth, and Sardius(the final boss) all have belly mouths. The former two spit out fire while the latter spits out platforms for Arthur to stand on in order to attack Sardius. Mid-boss Astaroth in **Ghouls 'n Ghosts** also has eyes on his torso and a mouth on his abdomen. Astaroth actually has this in every single appearance of his, and he is also the most recurring antagonist.
-   The Belly Juju from **Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams**. Also, the Belly Mouth is competent, can speak, and demands candy as payment for help. Meanwhile, his actual head is...less so.
-   **Tekken 5** boss Jinpachi Mishima, in his Devil mode.
-   **Tech Romancer** final boss Goldibus has this in his second form. Which is ironic, since there's no mouth on his actual head. (Interestingly enough, both Jinpachi and Goldibus share the same voice actor, Chikao Ōtsuka)
-   The eponymous character in the fighting game **Tongue Of The Fatman** has one of these.
-   **Twin Caliber** have a giant zombie boss in the Sinister Subway who doesn't have a head, but it does have a giant mouth in it's torso. Which it will try to chew you with.
-   **Trillion: God of Destruction**: It's largely more of a design choice, but Perpell, the Overlord of Gluttony, has one on her dress. Fittingly, she is also a Big Eater.
    -   The titular monster has one in all of its forms, and it uses it to fire lasers in its first/titan form. In its true form, it appears as a young woman, much like Perpell. There is a reason for this.
-   In **Undertale**, two of the monsters — Froggit and Knight Knight — have entire faces, complete with mouths, on their abdomens.
-   **Deltarune** features the Spades King, a boss with a mouth belly full of sharp teeth and a spades tongue which he utilizes in his attacks.
-   **World of Warcraft**:
    -   In **The Burning Crusade**, fiends such as Omor the Unscarred have a face with a gaping mouth on their chest. Some of them can breathe fire from it.
    -   In the **Warlords of Draenor** version of Hellfire Citadel, the boss Gorefiend possesses this. Part of the fight's mechanic is he'll devour the souls of members of the party, who can then help weaken him from the inside.
-   One of the bosses you fight in **Dark Souls** is the Gaping Dragon, a corrupted glutton whose insatiable appetite has, among other things, caused its entire upper torso to **split in half vertically** and become an immense snapping mouth.
-   In **Elden Ring**, the Fire Giant has a mouth on his belly that (along with an eye on his chest) opens up when he Turns Red.
-   In **Five Nights at Freddy's 4**, the fifth night introduces the player to the very dangerous Nightmare Fredbear (Along with his Palette Swap introduced the night after, Nightmare), who has a mouth on his stomach. Fortunately, it's just for show, and it can't open.
-   **Flash of the Blade** have headless giant zombies, who has faces growing out their exposed, bulging bellies as enemies.
-   In **Toukiden**, the large Oni Jollox and its palette swap Edax are mountainous humanoid gluttons that have a gaping maw on their bellies that's usually closed. When the Oni is enraged, this mouth opens and the creature bounces along on the ground like an enormous Pac-Man with trailing tentacles.
-   In **Avencast: Rise of the Mage**, the Wolgath are hulking four-armed Mighty Glaciers with Vacuum Mouths protruding from their stomachs, which draw victims into striking range of their massive axes. According to the lore, they used to be a race of warriors who lost their souls in a Deal with the Devil, and the Belly Mouths are the faces of demonic spirits that took control of their bodies.
-   **Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap** has the Final Boss, the Vampire Dragon, with a second head on his belly. It's as vulnerable as any other dragon's regular head.
-   In **Warframe**, this is Grendel's whole theme. He can use his first ability to absorb enemies into the maw on his gut, then use his second to convert them into a party-wide buff or his third to turn them into a projectile.

-   In **Dexter's Laboratory**, Dexter meets an elephant-like alien that wants to eat him. Dex points out that he can't possibly fit through the alien's tiny snout... and then the alien opens its **real** mouth.
-   Ghash (also called "Mr. Ugly" by the heroes) on **The Real Ghostbusters** was a powerful poltergeist with a fanged mouth with a lolling tongue on his stomach. Even freakier, this was the mouth **he talked with**.
-   The Piper in **Extreme Ghostbusters** has one, where he stores his army of ghosts.
-   **Godzilla: The Series**: The Chameleon has a large, gaping mouth across its upper torso.
-   **Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated**: The "Headless Horror" (based on the Blemmyae), which has no head, eyes on its chest and a mouth on its stomach, appears in episode 22 of the series, pursuing adventurer Rick Spartan. It's really his wife, who just wants him to retire so they can live a normal life.
-   In **The Spectacular Spider Man**, Venom can manifest a large mouth in the center of his costume, and can talk through it.
-   **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles**:
    -   Krang from **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987)**. Insofar as a brain in a mech suit counts as a stomach.
    -   Ch'rell also, when in his Shredder suit. In a Bad Future where he manages to take over the world, he occupies the head area of the mech instead, though.
-   **Wakfu**: Shushu General Anathar has a maw surrounded by crustacean-like pincers hidden in the belly. Although he describes "eating" what he puts there, it seems more to act as imprisonment.

Belly Mouth Example in Real Life

-   Flatworms have their mouths, which are also the only opening in their digestive system, in the middle of their belly.
-   Starfish have their mouths on the central underside of their bodies. And they have "eversible stomachs," meaning they shove their own personal bellies out of their own personal mouths and use them to engulf prey.
