Holy Freudian imagery, Batman!<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

_"Vagina Dentata... What a wonderful phrase!  
Vagina Dentata... ain't no passin' craze!  
It means no wiener for the rest of your days!  
It's a penis-free girl cavity! Vagina Dentata!"_

A classic Body Horror, the Vagina Dentata is a folk myth of toothed female genitalia, which occurs in many cultures worldwide, from Maori to Native American. It is suspected that the concept originally came into play as part of a Scare 'Em Straight cautionary tale, warning of the dangers of sex with strange women, but the surreality of the image, and the castration anxiety it evokes, has made it a hallmark of psychoanalytic painters and writers. Currently, many anti-rape female condoms work along the same principle.

If you believe in deep inner subtext, you're likely to see them in any creature that's moist, has teeth, and devours its victims (often whole and usually alive). Examples run from the Sarlaac pit to Davy Jones' Kraken. Sometimes there seems to be something to that, but usually a cigar is just a cigar... so to speak.

Several women's studies professors have advanced the theory that the vagina-as-Nightmare Fuel trope runs mainly on an inherent revulsion to female sexual power: to quote Stephen J. Ducat, "The fear of entering triumphantly, and leaving diminished." Post-structuralism might have a bone to pick with this notion, since it is based on the binary between lack and desire (i.e. a lack is somehow necessary for desire to be present), while post-structuralism (among other things) decries binarism as restrictive. But we digress.

An alternate theory suggested by some men says that the fear of the vagina dentata arises from the idea that having your penis bitten off would _really, really hurt_, but of course that doesn't even come close to explaining why they'd imagine teeth in a vagina _in the first place_. Strangely enough, this trope has not diminished the male enthusiasm for fellatio. This may be explained by the fact that most legends of Vagina Dentata show said toothed orifice as having a _mind of its own_, and a rather malicious one at that, whereas the standard mouth is manifestly under the control of its owner. Others point out that the idea of a secret mouth — sharp, nasty, and ready to bite you when you least expect it — is terrifying in and of itself (compare the similarly visceral but less Freudian Belly Mouth, especially when it appears as a surprise, like during the defibrillation scene in _The Thing (1982)_).

It's worth noting that if a (normal, human<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ) woman really did have teeth down there, she would still need to Kegel the crap out of her pelvic muscles to make them strong enough to tear skin. Otherwise, the teeth would do nothing more than just feel weird, really, unless they were somehow exceptionally sharp, although this would naturally run the risk of injuring the woman in question as well. (Not to mention imagining what it would be like to bear children through that kind of an opening.)

Note that a woman with a Vagina Dentata, especially one who can control it, can be an example of a succubus too, as both tropes were born from legends warning against sex with strange women. Or a warning for women to not come too near in that special time of the month. Some cultures kept their women in special houses at that time, others would just say: try anything and theirs will eat yours — or make it fall off. Subtrope to Super Sex Organs. Raunchier Sister Trope to Lamprey Mouth and Flower Mouth. The Gender-Inverted version of the trope, "Penis Dentatus", usually in the form of oblong objects or creatures with teeth or spikes, is not entirely unheard of and tends to symbolize masculine dominance or brutality, if not being an outright metaphor for sexual violence ... and shockingly enough, is Truth in Television for certain animal species (the most infamous being cats).<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

Of course, usage of the trope is just as likely to not originate in Sexual subtext or Freudian imagery at all, instead just being a normal horizontal mouth that was rotated ninety degrees for the sake of Bizarre Alien Biology or Body Horror. Can be paired with Psychosexual Horror.

Sub-Trope to Monster Mouth.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The Bio-Meat in _Bio-Meat: Nectar_, particularly on the undersides.
-   The Blue<small>◊</small> from _Blue Gender_.
-   _FLCL_ gives you the comedic version — Boxing Glove Vagina.
    -   This is a reference to a _Lupin III: Part II_ opening credits sequence, though in the Lupin III version the spring originates behind instead of between Fujiko's legs.
    -   Before that episode first aired on Adult Swim, the black-screen intro warned something to the effect of "we cut one shot from this episode. Guess which one."
-   The Mask of Flesh from _Inuyasha_ appears to be a harmless Noh mask of a woman until you put it on, at which point it permanently attaches itself to your face and then splits open vertically to reveal a vicious set of teeth. And then comes the Body Horror.
-   _Kill la Kill_ invokes this trope in particularly weird and somewhat disturbing fashion in Episode 12, when Ryuko has a Super-Power Meltdown in the middle of her berserker rage against her father's killer and transforms into a twisted berserker form, which has a huge mouth filled with sharp teeth **where her pelvis should be**! It's an exception to the general rule in that it opens like a regular mouth, but the implication's still there<small>◊</small>.
-   In the infamous adult OVA _La Blue Girl_ The Rival to the main character Miko transforms into a shikima, the name of the monsters in the series, she gains this along with a tongue.
-   Little demon Fastener from _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_ has an oval head bisected by a vertical zipper that looks like a vagina dentata. This is one of the _least_ offensive things on the show.
-   Norio from _Shadow Star_ named his shadow dragon Vagina Dentata, and sure enough its head does sorta look like a toothy vagina. The fact that Norio is gay, a tad misogynist _and_ in love with his best friend Takeo to the point of wishing he could bear his child makes it darkly amusing.
-   The only female Gunmen (Gunwomen?) mecha, belonging to General Adiane in _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ has its toothy mouth below the abdomen, with fangs. Given the fact that all the male Gunmen use drills, drills, and more drills as weapons, this was _definitely_ intended to evoke Freudian imagery.
-   The 1987 OVA _Wicked City_ features a multitude of demons with Vagina Dentata. The most noticeable one is the local Dark Action Girl, the infamous Spider Woman, who tries to use her Vagina Dentata _to eat the male lead Taki with it_. Right after having sex with him. And she can also _shoot spider webs from it_. And that's only the beginning of how messed up the movie gets.
-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh!_, one of Marik's more usable fantastic fiends, Dark Jeroid, has two faces and a centaurian build. Of course, its forelegs look like distorted arms (complete with hands), and the second face is right at the bottom of the upright torso... with a mouth right at that crucial spot. This combined with the rest of the distorted visage, visible here, qualify it as one of the higher-octane nightmare-cards Marik handles, even if it isn't one of the strongest.
    -   Similarly, there's Worm King. TCG artwork has it covered up as if the mouth is closed. (In fact, vertical, toothy mouths are common in the Worm archetype.)
-   In _YuYu Hakusho_, Kurama turns the tables against Karasu during their fight by using an Ojigi Plant.

    Card Games 

-   _Magic: The Gathering_: Sheoldred, Whispering One plugs her torso into various lower bodies. The one on her card has a great big mouth between its legs.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_:

    Comedy 

-   Joe Rogan does a stand-up bit that retorts female insults against the appearance of male genitalia, with Joe saying "have you seen what _you've_ got down there? It looks like the Predator's mouth!"

    Comic Books 

-   In _Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth_, Dave McKean suggested the Joker would be made to invoke this image, to go along with Grant Morrison's idea of a very sexually fucked up Batman. In the end they scrapped the idea... not that it made the Joker any less terrifying.
-   Spear Counterpart (yeah!) in _Den_ by Richard Corben — the monster is best described as a giant penis with teeth in his "urethra". (The whole comic is NSFW, of course.)
-   Virginia Dentata from _DV8_ is intentionally meant to invoke this image, though her big, toothy, sideways mouth is on her _stomach_.
-   The Elric comic series _The Balance Lost_ has a giant woman-monster with teeth everywhere. The vagina dentata is complemented by breasts that grow teeth, a mouth that grows extra mouths that all have teeth... you get the picture.
-   Referenced in one issue of _Rat-Man_: before having his first time with a woman, Rat-Man tells his penis not to worry, because she hasn't got shark teeth "down there".
-   _Tarot: Witch of the Black Rose_ has a sea witch who has a vagina with a beak. That's right. A squid beak to go with the tentacles growing out her labia.
-   _Watchmen_. Why do you think Ozymandias' monster only has one eye over that mouth?

    Fan Works 

-   An old and now sadly lost _Harry Potter_ fanfic had an _accidental_ case of this thanks to Rouge Angles of Satin. Hermione was standing by the lake being bitten by midges, but unfortunately:
    
    Hermione stood in the centre of a cloud of minges, all of them trying to bite her.
    
-   There is an _Andromeda_ fic where Trance asks Beka how she got rid of Harper's advances. Beka explains she slept with him once, taking care it was bad enough that he didn't want to do it again. Well, Trance decides to take her advice, but since the extent of her powers was never quite clear in the series... try and guess what Harper's last words in the fanfic were.
-   In the Parody Fic _Captain Proton and the Planet of Lesbians_, the evil Queen Sapphia has our hero thrown to the Giant Toothed Vagina of Freudian Nightmares. Proton escapes because the monster is a lesbian, and so doesn't eat guys.
-   In the Pandoraverse, when Bruce and the draconequus Pandora were dating, the idea of Pandora having teeth down there (or tentacles, or her vagina shooting squid ink or laser beams or eating ponies) was something Bruce genuinely worried about for a while, to Pandora's own amusement.
-   From _Starship Hooters 3: Undresser_ (a parody of _Starship Troopers 3: Marauder_)
    
    **Holly Little:** Brittles, would you consider embracing the Christian faith? If you do I'll marry you, and you can have sex with me for the rest of your life!  
    **Brittles:** YES! YES! EMBRACE ME OH LORD!  
    _(In response the ground opens up and Bighugecockroach emerges, looking like a gigantic toothed vagina.)_  
    **Brittles:** ARRGH! That's put me off sex with women forever!
    
-   _None Piece_: "That stung like a woman with teeth in her beef portal!"
-   In _Hellsing Ultimate Abridged_, Alucard claims the pussy of his female form has "rows of teeth like a shark," while taunting Walter about how he really couldn't get much enjoyment out of it even if he did get to fuck him. Being that it's _Alucard_ talking, jury's out whether he was joking or not.
-   Played for Laughs in the _New Tamaran_ pornographic prequel. Robin is ready to perform oral sex on Starfire when he notices her alien vagina resembles a Lamprey Mouth. He proceeds once she guarantees his safety.

    Films — Animation 

-   The film version of Pink Floyd's _The Wall_ features a brief animated sequence of two flowers simulating sex, ending with the female flower eating the male flower. This is par for the course in _The Wall_. Vagina Dentata imagery appears several other times throughout the movie, especially in most of the animations.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Alien_:
    -   Disturbingly blurring male and female traits in the most horrific way possible, the extending "inner mouth" of the titular creature in _Alien_ resembles a phallus, while the snapping jaws at its tip evoke this trope. Its hatchling form is _even worse_, giving humans a Face Full of Alien Clitoris down their throat.
    -   In the same film, the protagonists explore an alien space ship with massive entrances that resemble vaginas.
    -   The opening on the alien eggs themselves was originally modeled on the vagina, but they thought better of it and turned the opening into an X shape instead.
    -   This article on Cracked points out that the chestburster is possibly the most direct depiction of penile dentata on film.
-   These monsters from _Battle Beyond the Sun_, Roger Corman version of a Soviet sci-fi movie _The Sky is Calling_ that was re-edited and re-dubbed for release in the United States. Original Soviet version doesn't have this things. The Other Wiki says this was deliberate.
-   When Nene succumbs to the zombie infection in _Big Tits Zombie_, her vagina sprouts teeth and starts shooting flames at her friends.
-   _Blade Trilogy_:
    -   The Vampire Hunters in _Blade II_ have faces like the _Predator_ which give their victims a Face Full of Vampire Wing-Wong.
    -   In _Blade: Trinity_, while Hannibal King is recounting his past experience with a particular evil female vampire, he jokes (or maybe it wasn't a joke) about how unlike normal female vampires, this one's fangs are located in her vagina.
-   In _Borat Subsequent Moviefilm_, all girls in Kazakhstan are told at childhood that if they try to masturbate, their vaginas will eat them. When Tutar find out it's a lie, she loudly encourages a group of women to masturbate more.
-   In _The Cabin in the Woods_, a monster dubbed the "Ballerina Dentata" is a creature with a toothed maw replacing its face.
-   _Clerks II_ has Elias, a Conservative Momma's Boy explain this is why he practices abstinence (read: he's still a virgin); there's a troll that lives inside vaginas that will bite off male genitalia until the girl's 21st birthday when it is peed out. His girlfriend's is named Pillow Pants.
    
    **Randal:** ...have you and Myra even kissed yet?  
    **Elias:** We would have already if it wasn't for Listerfiend.  
    **Randal:** _\[Beat\]_ Listerfiend is her Mouth Troll, isn't it?  
    **Elias:** _\[shakes his head with a frown\]_ Women.
    
-   The face of the titular _Girl On The Third Floor_ appears to be invoking this, specifically her prominent, sideways mouth studded with thick teeth.
-   In _Grim Prairie Tales_, James Earl Jones relates a similar tale about a demonic woman who does the same thing to unsuspecting males — but becomes _pregnant_ as a result, sucking him into her womb, while the hapless male confidante _becomes her unborn child_ — which then gradually vanishes, as she repeats the process with another unsuspecting man, whom she dupes into helping a "pregnant lady." When her prior lover/victim is fully vanished, she then later tells the new "good Samaritan" that she was just _faking_ pregnancy with a pillow, in order to avoid rapists; and so she "shows her gratitude" to his nobility, by having sex with him. And so the process repeats. (In response, Jones's conservative listener expresses disgust with the story.)
-   A lampshade is hung on the urban legend in the German comedy movie _Killer Condom_, based on a comic book of the same title by Ralf König: It's the condom that is dangerous, not the woman. The condom is a hollow wormlike alien lifeform with a mouth full of teeth at one end that crawls around and hides in drawers in people's bedrooms among normal condoms, and when some guy puts it on during a one-night stand....\* chomp\* . Occasionally it hurls itself mouth-first at naked guys like a spring-loaded Killer Rabbit. No, this is not a porn movie. And it's funnier than it sounds. Especially when you're female.
-   The _Penetration Angst_ (which is actually a horror flick and not vore porn ) features a girl whose vagina actually devours guys whole. A more accurate term for that would be 'unbirthing.' Please don't look it up.
-   Potentially referenced in _Piranha 3DD_, when a piranha forces its way into a woman's vagina, and latches on to her boyfriend's penis (forcing him to cut it off) when the two have sex later on.
    
    "Josh cut off his penis because something came out of my vagina!"
    
-   _Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest_: The monster that eats Jack Sparrow towards the end of the movie. The fact that it actually does devour him should add to the Freudian Nightmare potential.
-   When the _Predator_ finally reveals his face, the viewer gets a good look at what even cable television movie commentary describes as a toothed vagina. Hence the heroes of both films call him "pussyface".
-   In _Skins (2017)_, the character of Samantha has her mouth and anus switched. When someone attempts to anally rape her, it's heavily implied that they learn she has teeth down there when she bites down.
-   The ginormous 'god' bug Behemecoatyl in _Starship Troopers 3: Marauder_.
-   _Star Wars_:
    -   Don't think too hard about this, but: the (_original_ — see below) sarlacc pit. _With tentacles._ Eeeewww. In fact, the recently released Sarlacc Pit playset has a Sarlacc that looks "so" much like a vagina that you have to wonder if someone did it on a bet. There's no WAY this isn't intentional. This did not go unnoticed on I-Mockery's Ten Things I Like About Return of the Jedi (#8)
        
        **Mr. Plinkett:** Sometimes a cigar is just a giant vagina in the middle of the desert that swallows men whole.
        
    -   The re-digitized release of the film, re-envisions the Sarlaac-pit as being simply a plant-well for a "man-eating plant" pod, that very much resembles "Audrey II" from _Little Shop of Horrors_ ("FEEEED ME!"); and rather than falling into the pit, the "Audrey II" simply gobbles them up (which it visibly does to Boba Fett... so much for rumors of his "escaping" from it later, though they were confirmed by the time of _The Mandalorian_). Whether this change was made in response to criticisms of the original Sarlacc's obvious Freudian connotations, is anyone's guess.
-   The most obvious example of all, playing the trope for comedy as well as horror: the 2008 _Teeth_ was a horror movie about a celibate teenage girl who discovers, while being raped, that she has Vagina Dentata, which will bite off the penis of any man who tries anything she doesn't like. It also has the immortal scene of a shady gynecologist who just tried to fist the heroine under the pretense of an examination ("And now I'm going to check your _flexibility_.") clutching his bloody hand and screaming "VAGINA DENTATA! THE LEGENDS ARE TRUE! VAGINA DENTATA!"
-   _The Theatre Bizarre_: In "Wet Dreams", one of Donnie's nightmares involves his wife's vagina sprouting mandibles and biting his penis off.
-   In _Tokyo Gore Police_ one of prostitutes has crocodile-shaped jaw in place of her vagina.
-   Just to show that John Carpenter can out-gross both of the above franchises, some of the transformations undergone by _The Thing (1982)_ resemble this trope, particularly the time that Palmer's rapidly-mutating head splits in half like a clam shell, sprouts toothy edges, and chomps closed on Windows's entire head.
-   Done for real in _War Witch_. Komona is raped on a regular basis by her commander, so puts a thorn inside a fruit and hides it in her vagina. When the commander tries to rape her again, he slices up his penis. As he's reeling in pain from this, she grabs a machete and kills him.

    Jokes 

-   At least one version of the bawdy poem "The Ballad of Eskimo Nell" involved one of the characters' castration by Nell's vagina in a vain attempt to please her.
-   There's a joke about a little boy's mother warning him about this trope to keep him from having sex. When he grows up and explains the reason for his fear of sex to his girlfriend, she decides to show him that vagina dentata is just a myth and lets him look up her skirt.
    
    **Woman:** See? There's no teeth down there.  
    **Man:** ... Well, not with gums like _that._
    
-   One Soviet riddle went like this: it doesn't exist, never did, and never will, but if somehow it appears — the world will end. What is it? The question had double answer: vagina dentata, and communism. (Apparently, in Soviet Russia, pussy eats you.)
-   One joke about King Arthur features a similar trap in the form of a special chastity belt that Merlin designs for Arthur's wife Guinevere. The belt has a hole in front of the groin, but that hole is rigged with a guillotine-like blade so Arthur will know if any of his men tried to have their way with the queen while he was away. Upon returning from his travels, Arthur indeed finds all the knights of the Round Table missing their members — except Sir Galahad. The king congratulates Galahad for his loyalty and offers him a reward — but alas, Galahad is speechless.
-   Another artificial variant appears in a joke about a businessman showing off his robotic secretary, explaining her built-in features (printer, stapler, tape dispenser, etc.), then letting a coworker borrow her to test her out. Upon hearing a bloodcurdling scream from the next room: "Oh, Crap! I didn't tell him about the pencil sharpener!"

    Literature 

-   A lengthy sequence in _American Gods_ culminates in a succubus-like reinvention of Bilquis the fertility goddess/the Queen of Sheba devouring a man whole through her sexual organs. There is later mention of a young, recently enslaved African girl (a twin, and thereby believed to have magic powers) convincing a would-be rapist that she had this.
-   Popular science/humor writer Mary Roach, in her non-fiction history of scientific sex research _Bonk_, mentions a case in which a woman's cervix reportedly sucked in, then clamped shut around, the tip of a condom her husband had donned prior to intercourse. (Her gynecologist had to forcibly extract the prophylactic's torn-off tip from her body, although her spouse wasn't harmed.) The incident was evidently reported to the _British Medical Journal_, in or shortly before 1931, in a letter to the editor.
-   In _A Clash of Kings_, Theon Greyjoy has a nightmare where he sleeps with a miller's wife he killed earlier who now has "teeth both above and below" and she tears out his throat as she is gnawing off his manhood. Theon is later castrated by a sadistic captor.
-   _Crooked Little Vein_ features a variant of this trope when the protagonist stumbles into a conversation with a demented fellow mystery explorer that mentions a homicide by Anal Dentata. Yeah, the book is kind of like that. Warren Ellis is kind of like that.
-   The heroine of Richard Calder's _Dead Girls_ develops vagina dentata (among other things) from a misaimed bioweapon originally intended to weaponise bioengineered love dolls. It's implied that they were included in the design solely for the psychological effects.
-   _Diana Tregarde_: In _Jinx High_, the evil magic user's artificial servant was deliberately created with this feature and is fed through that orifice.
-   The Shit weasels (well, that's what the characters call them...) in _Dreamcatcher_ are described with a vertical, jawless mouth lined with teeth. One of them uses this to chew its way out through a guy's butt (hence their nickname). A Shit weasel also attacks Pete's penis when he goes for a leak. He gets better... for a while.
-   The Gugs of _The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath_ qualify on a symbolic level, though H. P. Lovecraft is too proper to comment on it overtly.
    
    _Then two pink eyes shone, and the head of the awakened gug sentry, large as a barrel, wabbled into view. The eyes jutted two inches from each side, shaded by bony protuberances overgrown with coarse hairs. But the head was chiefly terrible because of the mouth. That mouth had great yellow fangs and ran from the top to the bottom of the head, opening vertically instead of horizontally._
    
-   This<small>◊</small> cover from an _Eighth Doctor Adventures_ novel. Oddly enough, it doesn't have very much to do with the story.
-   Frederick Forsyth's political thriller novel _The Fist of God_ references this.
    
    _"Why?" asked Gidi. "Think she’s going to bite it off when you drop your jeans?"_
    
-   In _Genome_, a genetically engineered super-agent girl turns out to have a sting in her intimate parts that administers excruciatingly painful toxin to an unfortunate wannabe rapist.
-   The short story _Hillbettys_ had a male traveler stop at a house occupied by two beautiful sisters and their equally hot mother; mom and the elder daughter try to seduce him while the third is more hesitant. Turns out all three of them have vagina dentata, with the twist that the fangs are incredibly poisonous, and two of the women use them to seduce, rob and murder men. The traveler fights back and, with the help of the good daughter, kills the mother and elder daughter. He's fallen for the good one in the process, and as the two run away together, she asks how they can be together with her poisonous pussy. He cheerfully responds by revealing his occupation: "I'm a dentist! If there's one thing I know how to do, it's pull teeth!"
-   In the _Hyperion Cantos_, this happens to Kassad when his girlfriend Moneta turns into the Shrike in the middle of sex. He is livid afterwards.
-   A rare toothless example which nonetheless fits the spirit of the trope: in _I Am America (And So Can You!)_, Stephen Colbert claims that Kegels can make woman's pelvic muscles become so strong that she can tear a man's penis off with them. Even worse, a woman you're next to could be doing Kegels _right now_ and you _wouldn't even know._
-   _The Laundry Files_: In the novella _Equoid_, the protagonist reads a letter by H. P. Lovecraft about his encounter with the Mother of a Thousand Young, who is using Hetty van t'Hooft (a girl the then fourteen-year-old Lovecraft is smitten with) as a lure to gain victims. The encounter no doubt explains Lovecraft's later phobia about sex.
    
    _"I looked up, straight at Hetty’s female parts, and saw then what had been hidden in waiting for me: a livid appendage, either vastly expanded from her natural organ (like the clitoris of the spotted hyena) or worse, an extrusion of Shub-Niggurath itself, capped with the concentric circular jaws of a lamprey, alternately gaping open to bite and snapping closed with vile frustration, streaked with blood and mucus, pulsing as it quested blindly from its vulval nest to seek my face—"_
    
-   Played with in the German parahistory crime novel _Meckels Messerzüge_ by Wilhelm Bartsch. Titular anatom Meckel makes a section of a female corpse and finds teeth in her vagina. Actually, not _her_ teeth, and don't bother to ask how they got in there in the first place, but the allusion to this trope is obvious.
-   Vampires in _Necroscope_ are capable of this (among many other bodily modifications) and have been known to use the other modifications to enhance sex before using this one to put an end to the whole thing.
-   The main character of _Polymorph_ by Scott Westerfeld can shift any part of her body at will, so she creates these while she is being raped by another polymorph. The results are quite... graphic.
-   An unfortunate drunk would-be rapist encounters one of these in _Rivers of London_. It's implied that the woman possessing it is the protagonists' maid, too. Jossed in _Moon Over Soho_ — despite the teasing hints at the end of _Rivers_, it turns out to be a different woman, and she racks up a string of similar killings all against Asshole Victims. The sheer physical impossibility of any human woman being able to contract her pelvic muscles enough to do any damage, even with 'false teeth', is also lampshaded by Peter and Stephanopolous.
-   The female Firvulag in _Saga of the Exiles_ all had this, and this was given as a source for human legends of the same.
-   In _Snow Crash_, Y.T. has a futuristic anti-rape device called a 'dentata', which is sort of a spring-loaded autoinjector that jabs an unwelcome penis with a tiny needle and a heavy dose of narcotics — it doesn't prevent penetration _per se_ but does quickly incapacitate the attacker. At one point, she forgets to remove it prior to having entirely consensual sex, which results in a somewhat awkward scene.
-   In _Sun Koh Heir Of Atlantis_, Shani — a priestess of Kali — is able to use Tantric sex magic to kill a gang of slavers and rapists with her vagina.
-   A variant of this trope occurs in, of all places, _The Talmud_. In a discussion of why it's proper for women to shave down there, reference is made to the biblical story of Amnon, who lusted after his half-sister Tamar and raped her, then immediately afterward "hated her with a very great hatred." The Talmud says the reason his feelings changed so drastically was that his penis got caught in her pubic hair and was mutilated. So, shave, ladies. It's more comfortable for the guy who's raping you.
-   In _Tour of the Merrimack_, the Marine Geneva Rhine is stated to wear an anti-rape device that functions in this manner. No details are given other than the fact that it is called a "sausage peeler".
-   _The War Against the Chtorr_: In "A Season for Slaughter", a robot probe is sent into a Chtorran nest, which turns out to have Organic Technology doorways resembling a labia. On seeing this on the camera screen, one soldier quips, "If there are teeth behind that thing, I'm turning gay."
-   In Tanith Lee's short story _The Weasel Bride_, this is the reason the groom murdered his bride on their wedding night.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In one episode of _Ally McBeal_, the female regulars are wondering aloud about Ling's latest lawsuit, and Elaine comments "Maybe her gynaecologist pulled the wrong tooth".
-   Played with in _Danger 5_ when Jackson is about to eat out a Russian escort girl, only to be attacked by a scuba-wearing assassin hiding in her vagina. Well it's not like the other examples of this trope are any less bizarre!
-   _Game of Thrones_: Referenced when Ygritte is trying to seduce Jon. "It doesn't have teeth..."
-   _The Magicians (2016)_: Margo claims she has them to deter her horny husband.
-   _Power Rangers_:
    -   The Disc-One Final Boss of _Power Rangers Lost Galaxy_, Scorpius, was designed with a not-very-toothy one for a _mouth_.
    -   _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_ provided us with the Bloom of Doom, which _did_ have teeth.
-   A Running Gag in _Scream Queens_ is a rumor running around that Chanel #5 suffers from this.

    Music 

-   Australian electronic/rock duo Corpse Penis Eaten By Rectum use a slight variation on this theme as their logo.
-   The music video for Green Jelly's "Three Little Pigs" invokes the trope offscreen, as the camera pans over a seedy part of town and passes by a movie marquee playing a film called "Her Thing Had Teeth".
-   The song _Jones Crusher_ by Frank Zappa from _Sheik Yerbouti_ is about a girl who's able to crush male private parts during sex — which isn't exactly this trope, but still worth mentioning.
-   In the Bawdy Song "Charlotte the Harlot", the titular Charlotte is like this due to getting a rattlesnake in there.
    
    One day in the canyon, no pants on her quim  
    A rattlesnake saw her and flung himself in  
    Charlotte the Harlot gave cowboys the frights  
    The only vagina that rattles and bites!
    
-   Referenced briefly by name in the clipping. song "Hot Fuck No Love".
    
    Damn, oh, damage to the dental dam  
    Dentata fine, he like a lot of bite when he grind

-   The Nadubi, an evil echidna man dog thingie from Yolngu lore, is often depicted with spikes in its vagina.
-   A Japanese legend involves a demon hidden in a woman's vagina, who would bite off men's penises until he broke his teeth on a specially-made steel dildo made by the woman's eventual husband, who also was the local blacksmith. The legend is commemorated with the Kanamara Matsuri (Festival of the Steel Penis) where people eat loads of phallic pastries. Today, it is also used to raise money for AIDS awareness and research.
-   One Inuit legend involved a guy meeting some woman like this, who really, _really_ wanted to have sex with him. He used a stick in place of his own body, and broke the teeth. Possibly then he had sex with her or he opened up a Japanese pastry shop.
-   A Norwegian ballad describes the Vagina Dentata. A boy is surprised when his hand is bitten by his lover. He asks her how many she has bitten; "first she bit a bailiff, then a priest, then she "_bit a sheriff from his horse_". Interpret the last part the way you will.
-   In Hindu Mythology the asura Andhaka, son of Shiva and Parvati (but not aware of it), is killed by Shiva when he tries to force the disguised Shiva into surrendering Parvati. Andhaka's son Adi (also an asura), takes the form of Parvati to seduce and kill Shiva with a toothed vagina in order to avenge Andhaka, but is also slain.
-   According to the legends of the Amazonian Yanomami Indians, when the very first men encountered the very first women, the menfolk were very wary, and let their horny monkey mascot-pet have sex with the women, first. To the monkey's eternal sorrow, the menfolk found out that the women's vaginas were infested with/guarded by schools of piranha.
-   Pacific Mythology: Maui crawls into Hine Nui Te Pō's vagina in an attempt to make humans immortal by crawling out her mouth while she's asleep. She wakes up and crushes him with her obsidian teeth in her vagina.
-   There's a Native American legend about Coyote where he ends up in the home of an old woman with two daughters. One is her actual daughter and the other is a stepdaughter. She has given both of them teeth so that they can kill the men who come, so the woman can steal their belongings. The stepdaughter is sent to seduce Coyote, but since she hates being forced to do this, and knowing Coyote is a hero, she asks him for help. He then takes a sharp stick and lets the daughter's teeth gnaw on that, distracting her so he can kill her, and then the old woman. He asks the stepdaughter to become his wife. Pragmatically, he then has to knock out all the sharp teeth, but saves a little blunt one that they find is rather pleasurable to have during the act.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Transhuman Space_ has this as a rare biomod (supposedly intended for assassination) found in Deep Beyond.
-   _Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay_: One mutation causes your genitals to ditch you in your sleep and run off to the realm of Chaos. In their place, they leave you with "a toothed orifice which stage whispers lewd suggestions at inappropriate moments".
-   _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_: This is one of the powers you can give fomori (humans possessed by demonic spirits), especially those whose powers revolve around seduction. This includes male variants as well.

    Video Games 

-   The man-eating plant above, from Konami's _The Adventures of Batman & Robin_ on the SNES, is part of Poison Ivy's arsenal in her boss fight.
-   _Agony (2018)_: The creatures aren't subtle.<small>◊</small> Neither is the logo.<small>◊</small>
-   The Mook Maker in the first few levels of _Bloodrayne_ looked like a cross between a vagina and the cocoon from _Species_.
-   The first Boss in _Brütal Legend_ is this... stuck to a tentacle... with a clitoris piercing, that apparently smells like a death whale.
-   In _Catherine_, the second "boss" of Vincent's dreams is the Immoral Beast, a deformed torso with its limbs on backwards and various body parts (including eyes and a nose) on its ass. It also a mouth near where the split in its legs should begin. And it giggles and moans while it chases him. It's pretty obviously a manifestation of Vincent's guilt over the indescretions of his adultery.
-   In _Dante's Inferno_, the "temptress" creatures in the circle of Lust have these. And they sprout a scorpion tail out of them.
-   As if its sheer difficulty weren't horrifying enough, _Dark Souls_ gives us the Gaping Dragon<small>◊</small>, which very obviously resembles a fifty-foot-tall toothed vagina on legs when it rears up to attack. Yes, it will try to engulf you at every possible opportunity. Even squickier, one of its attacks has the thing vomit a massive wave of acid.
    -   It also has the more symbollic Quelaag in _I_ and Najka in _II_, both of which are beautiful women whose lower bodies are giant insects (spider and scorpion respectively) with giant, toothy maws where their crotches would be.
    -   Its Spiritual Successor _Bloodborne_ takes this trope even further with enemies such as the Crawlers (giant squid-looking thingies) and the Fluorescent Flower (picture a giant centipede crossed with an anglerfish sporting a vertical mouth that's got as many teeth as you'd expect). Bonus points: the former is full of infant-sized Messengers and the latter has a the Gaping Dragon's gushing attack... yeah. _Both of these are technically mooks_ (though they're also mercifully rare). It's even partly justified, given the later revelations...
-   This phone card art<small>◊</small> for _EarthBound (1994)_ gives local Big Bad Giygas an... _unusual_ face. "Is that an Eldritch Abomination in your pocket, or are you just angry to see me?"
    -   And then remember the fan theories about Giygas being a rape symbol...
-   An example of Penis Dentatus shows up in _The Elder Scrolls_ lores, "The Real Barenziah, Part III" where we learn that Khajiit males have barbs much like most cats.
-   Mantorok of _Eternal Darkness_.
-   In _Fallout: New Vegas_, you can attempt to convince a slave trader to give you a slave for free by mentioning that she has a dangerous disease. If you medicine skill is too low, your character will say that the slave has "vagina dentata", which will not fool the slave trader.
-   The _Final Fantasy_ series' Malboros. Tentacles, teeth, bad breath...yep, Vagina Dentata.
-   _Guild Wars_ also has its own version of this, the Dreadspawn Maw located in the elite endgame area for Nightfall, the Domain of Anguish.
-   In _Halo_, the Elites have sets of mandibles similar to the Predators. Lampshaded in _Arby 'n' the Chief_, where Chief calls Arby Vagina Face occasionally.
-   Part of Zagara's design for _Heroes of the Storm_ has a giant row of crossed tooth-like spikes running vertically down her abdomen. This was not present in her original _Starcraft II_ model.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   In _The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword_, Deku Babas (carnivorous plant enemies that attack by biting) are now able to open their jaws vertically as well as horizontally, giving them the appearance of this trope.

-   The monsters in _Michigan: Report From Hell_.
-   _Monster Hunter (2004)_: The Khezu possesses a rubbery, elastic neck that can stretch to bite its prey. Its mouth is a maw filled with teeth.
-   The Oozes in _Pathways into Darkness_, and the F'lickta in _Marathon 2: Durandal_. The latter's also serves as a literal vagina, according to info in S'pht terminals.
-   _Pico_: The character Piconjo, an Evil Counterpart of Pico, has a rare male example of a Penis Denatus in the form of his Gag Penis. One flash shows it as a fully sentient body part of its own that can transform into a full-on dragon, complete with head and toothy mouth.
-   The Pokémon known as Cloyster, to many it does look like a giant, spiky, purple vagina with an anti-rape goblin living inside.

-   Lurker, a faceless creature in _Silent Hill: Homecoming_ has a toothed, vagina-shaped mouth<small>◊</small>.
-   The Split Worm in _Silent Hill 3_ is a combination of this and a Penis Dentatus. It also goes in and out of holes, representing penetration. Also, the split-jawed Doublehead dogs.

-   _Total War: Warhammer III_: Daemons of Slannesh factions' Siege Towers have designs based on this, especially the part below where the men enter.

    Web Animation 

-   The flying vagina creature in an animated short called _Cumbersnatch_, as well as the mouths of the penissauruses. As you might suspect, not work safe.
-   The classic Gmod monster species, the Vagineer are Engineers from _Team Fortress 2_ whose mouths resemble a vagina. They are often seen fighting or teaming up with the just as classic gmod monster, Painis Cupcake. The implied squick from putting these two concepts together is not helped by the fact than Panis' catchphrase is "I am Panis Cupcake, I will eat you!".
-   There are also "vagi" variants of many other Valve Software characters and characters from other franchises, even coming full circle with "vagi" variants of other gmod characters, including Panis Vagicake.
-   A brazilian youtube channel dedicated to telling urban legends through string literature-like cartoons features The Pale Creature, a monster that presents a vertical belly mouth.
-   The _Helluva Boss_ episode "Unhappy Campers" begins with Blitz arguing with a nurse initially viewed from the back he insults by calling her "Nurse Pussy-Face". When we see her from the front, it's shown that the nurse has a sideways mouth resembling a vagina with teeth.

    Webcomics 

-   _Concession_ invokes Predator with their resident ghostly abomination here.
-   _Edible Dirt_, almost always a deeply NSFW comic, visits this particular brand of Squick.
-   One strip of _Exterminatus Now_ discussed the _American Gods_ example above, with Lothar pissed that Eastwood didn't warn him about it when recommending the book.
-   The fused form of Bob and Lisa, the Sin(s) of Gluttony, from _Jack_. Depending on which one is in control you either get a giant female reptile monster with a male face for a crotch, or vice versa.
-   "Live Nude Ghouls" is a very NSFW (but funny as hell) comic about a monster girl brothel — which tends to have no repeating customers. Regarding this trope, there is a fake ad for "Vagident" — toothpaste for a vagina dentata.
-   _NSFW Comix_ has Entrepreneurial Dan making several unsuccessful pitches for vagina dentata devices.
-   _The Order of the Black Dog_, from the same author as "Concession", describes this with one of the horrors of the astral plane, where it is claimed that a "fanged c\*nt" is what awaits people in the afterlife.
-   _The Perry Bible Fellowship_ naturally has its own disturbingly funny (and NSFW) take on the subject.
-   Mentioned in the 2004-01-21 comic of _Queen of Wands_. Not nearly as gruesome, but just as disturbing, is singing its praises to the tune of Hakuna Matata, quoted above. (Warning: Not Mind Safe.)
-   _SwordCat Princess_: Shackled, Kathryn tells MacKnight that she can use her magic ring to form metal wherever it is needed — her vagina, in this case. She makes it clear she has previously used this ability to chop a choke pear in half — warning him away from thoughts of sexual assault, should he have any (he doesn't).
-   Honorable Mention: _The Unspeakable Vault (of Doom)_ features Kinky Shopping., including Ygo's Fleshdark Toy, "for use with or without teeth". (Not really NSFW.)

    Web Original 

-   SCP\-688 can replicate this, under the right conditions.
-   The parody website _Villain Supply_ had a virtual reality trap for a Supervillain Lair. _Imagine the hero believing that he's sneaking through your lair, on the verge of defeating your plans, when suddenly he's attacked by his mother's toothed vagina!_
-   _Whateley Universe_:
    
    -   Sara is perfectly capable of actually producing teeth there (and anywhere else she chooses), and has in fact castrated and transformed at least one of her opponents (it's Jobe) in the past (and even keeps his organ sealed in Lucite on the mantelpiece as a souvenir). With demons, the metaphor can become real very fast:
        
        I wasn't even bothered by the tiny flashes, like gnat-sized knives, that continued to spark like little bites at the base of my manhood.
        
        It was clear Lucite. Inside was a severed male organ, floating above an inscribed bronze plaque. The plaque read only: "Jobe."
        
    -   Mentioned in this picture<small>◊</small> from "I looked into the Abyss, and it Winked" Part 7:
    
    Warning \* Beware of Vagina Dentata!
    

    Web Videos 

    Western Animation 

-   _American Dad!_: In an episode where Stan is sent to prison, he decides to best way to avoid being raped is to spread a rumor about how his anus has teeth.
-   _Batman: The Animated Series_: Poison Ivy's introductory episode features her Man-Eating Plant trying to devour Batman, and, as it's shaped similarly to a giant Venus fly trap, it of course evokes this imagery. This got adapted into the SNES game _The Adventures of Batman and Robin_.
-   _Drawn Together_: Princess Clara's Wicked Stepmother cursed her and now her genitalia are a tentacle monster (an "Octopussoir") that scares away potential suitors until she finds her True Love's kiss. Naturally, _that_ event didn't go quite as planned. The vagina is later surgically removed and goes on to have a more fulfilling love life than its owner. Also subverted in that the "Octopussoir", aside from being a little jumpy, was actually a very kind creature.
-   _Korgoth of Barbaria_: The man-eating tree has a vertical mouth. Appropriately, the tree used a bound pretty girl to lure its victims.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: In "Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?", the living dresses' mouths are created from their neck holes, resulting in tall, slitted maws with sideways-closing jaws lined with fabric teeth.
-   _South Park_:
    -   "Red Hot Catholic Love": after Father Maxi suggests that the laws be changed to allow priests to have sex with women, the Gelgameck cardinal protests, "A Gelgameck vagina is three feet wide and filled with razor-sharp teeth! Do you really expect us to have sex with them?" But let's just forget about the Gelgamecks.
    -   Hillary Clinton has... _something_ in there, according to "The Snuke".
-   _Xiaolin Showdown_: In "The Dream Stalker", Hannibal Bean uses two Shen Gong Wu (the Shadow of Fear and the Sapphire Dragon) to bring Raimundo's worst fears to life to use against the other monks. While Rai's fear of jellyfish was known from a previous episode, the giant jellyfish monster that Bean sets loose on the temple has, well...a gigantic fleshy, toothy sideways mouth.
