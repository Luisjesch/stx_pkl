"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." — Genesis 1:1

The Big Boss of the universe in monotheistic and monolatric religions. The Alpha and the Omega, the Big Cheese, the Big Guy in the Sky, the Man Upstairs, the Almighty, the Creator, Capital G, Ceiling Cat, Old Beardy.

If all of existence is one big story, _He's_ **THE** Big Good, God of Good, and just generally good. He's also often the creator of the universe/s and everything in it/them.

Metaphysical human concept or not, He's got a pretty large chunk of humanity as believers and followers, thanks in part to best-selling books such as The Bible and The Qur'an, which feature God as a prevalent character, if not the main character, and which are stated to have been inspired by Him.

In nearly all cases, God is shown as being all-powerful, and usually all-knowing. Since God is believed by followers to be the driving force behind the _entire universe_, this also makes a good deal of sense. Also common is a portrayal of God as the ultimate Chessmaster, capable of executing an eternity spanning plan that often works In Mysterious Ways. This leads people to wonder why God doesn't just solve the problem of evil with a single metaphysical finger snap — but that's a discussion best left to theologians. He is even shown to be everywhere at once.

Since depicting God is attempting to portray an infinite divine being in human terms and ideas, this is problematic at best, and many series choose to go with Have You Seen My God?, Pieces of God, or just asking the audience to Take Our Word for It. Rather than giving God an explicitly defined human shape and face, most portrayals tend depict him as a wise elder (often in homage to the Sistine Chapel), one or two giant hands in the sky (in line with Heaven Above), an eye, or even nothing more than an ALL CAPS WORD BUBBLE.

Perhaps the most common portrayal of God (at least in the West) is as a God in Human Form, specifically God in the form of Yeshua the Nazarene. These portrayals tend to follow The Four Gospels pretty closely and often narrow in on his time as an infant or on his execution.

God is also not always seen as the benevolent ruler of everything, hence why tropes such as God Is Evil exist. Some of this is Alternative Character Interpretation from The Bible and similar works, others are authors liking to play with audience expectations, and some of it is authors who dislike God and religion putting a little personal touch on their creation/their creation was made to express those views. Works which feature Rage Against the Heavens often feature God being a jerk, if not outright malevolent to his creation, though some would say he's more concerned with perfect justice than just being nice, which can cause problems with an imperfect humanity. Taking this depiction to its furthest extent creates a variation on the Cosmic Horror Story.

He's usually portrayed as the only deity in the works He appears in, with two major trends going against this. Some depictions create an opposing force to God equal in stature to Him, The Anti-God. In another variation, for when there are other gods in the setting, He still gets top billing. Both of these are actually in contrast to at least Abrahamic religious canon, but that hasn't stopped fiction.

Medieval and Renaissance Art is almost exclusively concerned with depicting God or those faithful to him. Most commonly, He's conflated with the infant Jesus being cradled by his mother, the suffering Jesus on the cross, or the corpse of Jesus being mourned by his mother. Regardless of whether these incarnations deal with God incarnate, they almost always feature him with some variant of the Holy Halo, often even a Holy Backlight, to communicate his wisdom and divinity.

Using God as a character rather than simply referring to the Powers That Be or using terms without religious connotations is a dicey proposition in a multi-faith society, as it is just about the only thing you can do, other than a Series Finale Clip Show, that is 100% guaranteed to alienate a chunk of the viewers.

TV shows in which God plays a major role tend not to last very long, regardless of their various good points. The main reason for this is any characterized portrayal of God is most likely going to follow the rules of a given religion's version of God (mostly Christianity in the West), which often alienates people who aren't members of that religion. This, along with the increasing secularization of society in the 21st century, means that the media often sidesteps portraying God in a particular way for various reasons, as those who run and work in the media are people with their own various beliefs and attitudes towards God. In a practical sense, having an all-powerful, all-knowing, all-good character also risks killing the tension if handled poorly, since at any point, said character could step in and resolve any conflict the heroes might have.

There's a whole host of tropes that go alongside classical appearances of God. Expect him to reward the faithful dead in the glorious paradise of Heaven, where he's praised by Winged Humanoids or rotating wheels depending on whether Our Angels Are Different or not. The Archangel Michael will serve him faithfully against those who are justly condemned to Hell, especially the leader of the Fallen Angels, Satan. Of course, secularized works tend to play with these standard portrayals, often with caricatured versions of Fluffy Cloud Heaven and Fire and Brimstone Hell.

Parodies are common (see King of All Cosmos), but limited to Black Comedy — once you've turned God into a joke, it's hard to do anything else.

The danger of being burned at the stake leads to many writers choosing to thinly veil God as a Crystal Dragon Jesus or "the Light". Said God may even refuse the label for personal reasons.

The Maker is often a stand-in for God, if it isn't outright Him.

On an unrelated note, had you been the person to create this page in the first place, you may well have seen the prompt: "Describe God here". Quite the task indeed, whatever your spiritual viewpoint.

## And then God said, "Let there be examples." And so it was done; God had created many examples of Him appearing in other works:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime and Manga 

-   The Almighty One in _Ah! My Goddess_. Theorized Father of Belldandy and Skuld, as well as Urd, who was produced by a tryst with the Ruler of Demonkind. It has now been confirmed that he IS their father and that he is actually Tyr from the Norse legends.
-   _Angel Sanctuary_ features God Is Evil in a really, really nasty way. God not only forced an Original Sin down on his angels (when growing in their tubes they live from their own Mother, Adam Kadamon; during her captivity in Eden, Alexiel also is made to eat fruits from the Tree of Enlightenment. Which grows from Adam Kadamon's eye. Yuck. That the fruits look like baby heads doesn't make it any better.) — nope, he also considers all of his angels failed experiments and wants to end the world. Oh, and he's a computer program.
-   In _Berserk_, the Holy See claims that it does all it does in the name of God, even though it's members tend to be slimy priests at best and violent psychos at worst. In Chapter 83, it's revealed that God Himself is the Greater-Scope Villain of the _Berserk_ universe by virtue of intentionally turning it into a Crapsack World.
-   In _Code Geass_, God is the collective will of every person that has ever lived (and maybe ever will live, they're not too clear on it). Charles and his wife Marianne want to kill it. Instead, Lelouch geasses it into killing Charles and Marianne, ruining their plans.
-   The Truth of _Fullmetal Alchemist_ starts his speech to anyone who dares cross into his domain (i.e. through human transmutation), by stating that "I am the World. I am the Universe. I am God. I am Truth. I am One. I am All. And I am also you!"
-   Deus ex Machina from _Future Diary_. The story happens because Deus is dying and needs to choose a successor to become the new god. Interestingly, there appear to be a couple of limits on his powers: it has been conclusively stated that he cannot resurrect the dead, as he is apparently unable to bring back the souls of the deceased. That, and he's dying himself.
-   _Haruhi Suzumiya_:
    -   Itsuki Koizumi theorizes that Haruhi is God. She possesses godlike abilities, true, but he's not completely sure that she's actually the creator of the universe, just noting it as a possibility. However, he's a bit biased, being an esper who received his powers from Haruhi; the time travelers and aliens are quite firm that despite Haruhi's powers, she is not God.
    -   There's also a strong fan theory that Haruhi is actually _not_ the one with powers, but instead they belong to her seemingly-normal Deadpan Snarker boyfriend, who lets everyone believe she has them because he doesn't _want_ them.
    -   Kyoko Tachibana is an esper who believes someone entirely different (Sasaki, an old friend of Kyon's) is God. And unlike Koizumi, who is just idly speculating, she believes this _very_ strongly, and gets upset whenever anyone brings up the possibility that she's not actually divine — especially the god in question.
-   _Heaven's Design Team_ has God as The Voice, never seen onscreen. He almost appeared in one episode at the party in Hell, but sent Garuda at the last minute. Most of the plot is the designers dealing with God's arbitrary animal requests.
-   In _Pani Poni Dash!_, God is a cat that changes colors every episode and lives in a vending machine.
-   Lain Iwakura from _Serial Experiments Lain_ may or may not be God. We're not quite sure. At any rate, even if she's not God, her power level makes the whole point kinda moot.
-   _Shaman King_'s Great Spirit is "God" and is every spirit manifested into a giant pillar of light.
-   Tenchi Masaki's unnamed higher self in _Tenchi Muyo!_.

    Comic Books 

-   The _Lucifer_ comics depict God as sympathetic towards humans, but ultimately rather alien and willing to do terrible things in pursuit of greater goals. Indeed, at one point He is willing to destroy the entire universe, as He wasn't sure if it was really a successful experiment or not. Eventually, He was convinced to do nothing and let the inhabitants of his universe solve the entropy of the universe by themselves, an idea He didn't seem to have even considered and thus found rather amusing.
-   _The Sandman (1989)_: The "Season of Mists" storyline features angels discussing God. Lucifer discusses his fall from heaven. Remiel receives messages from his Creator, also called the Presence.
-   _The Sandman: Overture_: The character "Glory of the First Circle" is also called "Shekinah", which is close to a Hebrew phrase for the presence of God, "Shekinah Glory". But Glory is not referred to by other The DCU names for God.
-   God is shown, face and all, in the _Preacher_ comics. Definitely not one of the kinder depictions of his power or personality, as this version of God is more or less a lonely and horribly manipulative narcissist. Basically, everything God ever did in our plane of existence was done to get people to praise and love him, (including the completely horrifying things that created tons of collateral damage and ruined or ended countless lives) and even the few positive things he does during the course of the comic (like keeping a bargain he agreed to when he could have easily betrayed the other party and lost nothing in doing so) are done so that he can _literally_ sing his own praises afterward.
-   Marvel Comics have an interesting relationship with God. The highest being in the setting and creator of the universe is The One Above All, best known as the being who gives the Living Tribunal his marching orders. Spider-Man met him once where he appeared as a homeless man, and the Fantastic Four met him once where he appeared as (or is) Jack Kirby. However, there is also Yahweh, the God of Jews, Christians, and Muslims, who may or may not be distinct from the One Above All and who is a peer of Odin and Zeus. They're both really nice guys, by the way.
-   The DCU has The Presence, also known as The Voice, The Hand, and The Source who plays essentially the same role. His most directly visible role is being the source of power behind the Spectre's abilities, since the Spectre is, technically speaking, a Fallen Angel who repented, and as such gets micromanaged a fair bit more than usual just in case. As The Source, meanwhile, it shows up as a giant burning hand in the New Gods stories, and as witnessed by Krona created the Universe in that form (the "Big Hand" theory).
-   The DC/Marvel crossover that led to Amalgam Comics portrayed the respective masters of The Living Tribunal and the Spectre as universe-sized robotic-looking humanoids. Who happen to be brothers...
-   _Conan the Barbarian_ has Mitra, who's essentially the Judeo-Christian God under a different name. His followers are strict monotheists (the only ones in Hyboria!), believe in Heaven and Hell and are sworn enemies of Set, the setting's serpentine Satan analogue.
-   _Last Man Standing_ has Hex, who is by Word of God the God of The 'Verse.
-   Savage Dragon has an arc named "A Talk With God". Guess who shows up? Special mention to the fight between Him and Satan!
-   In _Century: 2009_, God appears to take care of the Anti Christ: an evil, drug-addicted version of Harry Potter. It turns out God is Mary Poppins.

    Comic Strips 

-   Quino's works portray him as an old man with a triangular halo over his head.
-   Numerous appearances in _The Far Side_ in the usual "elderly bearded dude in a white robe" persona.
    
    "Yes, that's right! The answer is "Wisconsin"! Another 50 points for God, and...uh, oh, looks like Norman, our current champion, hasn't even scored yet!"
    

    Fan Works 

-   In the _Pony POV Series_, while the Elders are joint Top Gods in the setting, the Father of All Alicorns (or just known as The Father) has many similarities to the traditional Christian God, including being the Dimension Lord of Heaven.
-   In the Harry Potter fanfiction _King of Kings, Ruling over Rulers_, the major religion in the Wizarding World worships the Christian-Abrahamic God, known to the wizards as Aernus. To some, however, he is known as Ayavan.
    -   The Atlanteans take this even further, for before the destruction of their civilization, they saw Aernus not as God himself, but as the accidental fusion of the two souls (Al-Aion and Fa-Aion) of God, known to them as the Aion.
-   In _Dominus Mundi : The King of Kings_, a reboot of the above fanfic, the main religion of the wizarding world is a fusion of pre-schismatic Christianity and the general beliefs of the ancient Perennial cults. As such, while there are many deities around, they have the Abrahamic God as their primary deity, yet rarely referring to Him as Aion. The Aeneans also believe that His attributes are embodied in the group known as the Sacred Twelve.

    Films — Animated 

-   _Doraemon: Nobita and the Spiral City_ has a God analogue called The Sower, said to be the creator and progenitor of all life in the universe.
-   _The Prince of Egypt_: Since this movie is a retelling fo the Book of Exodus, it's only natural that He shows up. He is depicted as loving and benevolent, but capable of shocking ruthlessness if pushed too far.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Bruce Almighty_ with Morgan Freeman, who temporarily lends Jim Carrey the role after dissing Him one too many times.
    -   Returns in _Evan Almighty_, ordering the titular character to build a new Noah's Ark.
-   God is stated to exist in _Constantine (2005)_ and has a wager with Old Lou for all of Earth as the prize. He never appears but twice intervened. First was stripping His Favor from the half-angel Gabriel before Gabriel could strike Satan, as Gabriel is the Big Bad of the movie and wants to unleash Hell on Earth to make humans worthy of God's Love. Later because the hero Constantine summoned Lou, thereby committing suicide and asked for the soul of another be freed from Hell as payment and no personal gain, it was enough to absolve him of all sins and not on a trip to Hell, which Lou was hoping for. God possibly even moved Constantine's hand to flip Lou off.
-   This exchange in _Cross of Iron_:
    
    **Anselm:** Do you believe in God, Sergeant?  
    **Steiner:** I think God is a sadist, and probably doesn't even know it.
    
-   God is played by none other than Paul Sorvino in _The Devil's Carnival_.
-   In _Dogma_, God appears in two incarnations. First, He's a rather shabby and gentle old man who unfortunately gets the crap kicked out of Him by demonic underage murderers on rollerblades; second, _she_ is Alanis Morissette in a silver tutu, and is fond of doing handstands. It's also mentioned that God is a Skee-Ball addict. Although it's implied that God's appearance as Alanis is because that was the form the protagonist needed to see most. It is also implied that God was once as vengeful and wrathful as He/She was portrayed as in the Old Testament (Sodom and Gomorrah, the ten plagues, etc), but became less so as time passed. He/She no longer keeps an angel employed to fulfill His/Her wrath and gives His/Her Skee-Ball tickets to neighborhood children.
-   _Field of Dreams_: The Voice — unknown actor, listed in credits only as "Himself"... implication clear!
-   Toller spends much of _First Reformed_ trying and failing to pray to God, as his journal voice-overs explain. He tries diarying as prayer, reflects on discernment, and writes that God chose him for his loneliness, but still feeling nothing, he pursues environmentalism in hopes of becoming as close to God as Mary is. He tries to make a case to a megachurch pastor that God is present and expresses Himself through the environment, but Toller is only met with derision and without consolation from God. Throughout the whole movie, the only time Toller seems to be on good terms with God is when he goes on a bike ride with Mary, the kind, pious widow Toller is trying to imitate.
-   Humorously, the Narrator in _George of the Jungle_ apparently is God (in the straight-to-video sequel, he drags away a villain who told him to shut up into Heaven — complete with heavenly music, cartoon cherubs, and screams of terror), and generally screws around with the villains who often get tired of his narrating.
-   Most of _God's Not Dead_ is set in somewhat reality, other than the over the top evil Hollywood Atheist groups and believers of other religions, and is mostly a drama about maintaining one’s faith despite lack of proof behind it. However, God’s existence is heavily implied when the main “atheist” antagonist, who turns out to believe in God, but hates him because of his mom dying of cancer, gets brutally run over by a car that comes from nowhere, which inflicts an injury that gives him EXACTLY enough time to repent for his sins before dying. All of the Christian teens dance at a club just minutes after this horrific incident. This unintentionally evokes the feeling of God Is Evil to some viewers of the movie.
-   In _The Knowledge_, God is mentioned frequently by various characters. In the 2016 stage play, some references to "God" were changed to "your god".
-   _Life Blood_: She comes to Rhea in the form a lesbian in very little clothing, granting Rhea eternal life as a vampire in return for killing evil people on Earth.
-   _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_ goes all-out subversion of the usual delicacy about the Almighty with a Terry Gilliam-animated God who peers out of the clouds and issues orders to Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, while complaining about people being deferential to Him and how depressing the Psalms are. And all of this back in 1975.
-   _Oh, God!_ and its sequels (starring George Burns as God)
-   _π_: The Jewish group believes that the universal number is the true name of God and that they will come closer to the Messianic Age by invoking it. Max is ambivalent about this notion but feels that only he is worthy because it was given to him.
-   God is referenced as the Hand that stopped the bullets from killing Jules and Vincent in _Pulp Fiction_. Vincent is less than convinced, Jules decides to change his life over it. The audience is left to decide for themselves, but Vincent's fate tends to indicate Jules was right.
-   In _Raiders of the Lost Ark_, we learn that God did not like the Nazis very much.
-   God appears at the end of _Rapture-Palooza_ to furiously rant against the protagonists for having killed Jesus with a laser gun, and gets into a fistfight with Satan before both fall into a jacuzzi and get electrocuted by a boombox, killing both of them for good.
-   In _Star Trek V: The Final Frontier_, the Enterprise crew meets an evil alien playing at being God. The original concept called for the being to _actually be_ God.
-   _Star Wars_:
-   _Time Bandits_ with Sir Ralph Richardson, slightly hedged since he was billed as "the Supreme Being."
    
    **Fidgit:** That was no man; that was the Supreme Being!  
    **Kevin:** You mean God?  
    **Fidgit:** Well, we don't know Him _that_ well; we only work for Him!
    

    Literature 

-   The ancient entity, Maganu, is this in Adam R. Brown's fantasy series, _Astral Dawn_. Maganu has taken on many forms, including that of three giant blue stars. Maganu is actually the creator of just one of many universes within a collection of universes called the Tapestry. How he went about this is actually pretty wild. Though he is not the one total God, as humans might think of it, as far as the "anomalous dimension" goes, he's pretty much it.
-   References to "the Creator" as the antithesis of the Dark One are everywhere in the _Wheel of Time_ series through phrases like "the light of the Creator", but, Church Militant aside, there doesn't seem to be much religion involved, and the Creator itself never directly appears in the series. The lack of religion has been explained by the fact that in-universe Creator and Dark One are very much real, and everyone knows that (for example, saying the Dark One's true name aloud will have dire(ct) consequences). The Creator seems to be a very hands-off kind of deity. In one of the books, it's implied that he created all worlds, but doesn't particularly care if one of them dies in the way that a gardener plants all the flowers in a garden, but doesn't care if one of them wilts. The characters seem to acknowledge and accept this. That doesn't explain why prayers and catechisms are addressed to him, though. It's somewhat implied that he indirectly works to save the world by sending the Dragon and his companions.
-   An interesting take in _DDD_ by Kinoko Nasu: The Multiverse being the way it is, even the phenomenon of "God" was most likely willed into existence by humanity's beliefs. However, while demons are incomplete beings (which is why they need humans to define their existence), if God was truly omniscient and omnipotent, then He would have no need to interact with human beings since He only needs Himself.
-   Eru Ilúvatar in _The Silmarillion_, also known as "The One". He appears to have created the Ainur; however, most of the time he doesn't seem to do much and lets the Valar and Maia manage Arda. Eru is also the only source of the "secret fire" that can give true life and sentience to a people. When Aule created the Dwarves against Eru's will but offered them up to him and proved ready to destroy them, Eru gave them souls. One of the rare cases where Eru did interact was when the Numenoreans, inspired by Sauron, attacked Valinor, causing him to destroy Numenor and make the world round, meaning human vessels couldn't reach Valinor.
-   The Creator in _The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant_ is rather unusual in that while He is undoubtedly the creator of the Land (the setting for most of the novels), it is not so clear whether He is also the guy who made the "real world" where Thomas comes from. He seems benevolent, and unusually humble as gods go, frequently dressing like a hobo (with _really_ bad breath). He's certainly not omnipotent: he can't defeat his enemy, Lord Foul (the Devil), without also destroying the world he created.
-   Agents of God are present in _The Dresden Files_, and the Man Himself is referred to as the "White God" by various supernatural entities. Other gods exist as well, though it's implied that most of them aren't very active anymore. Odin seems to be doing well for himself, though.
-   Monotheistic religious texts, listed below. Some readings treat Him as the _protagonist_. Some treat Him as the _author_; Author Avatar may apply.
    -   The Bible (Judeo-Christian).
    -   The Book of Mormon (Latter-Day Saints).
    -   The Torah (Jewish).
    -   The Qur'an (Muslim).
    -   Bahá'í religious texts.
-   In _The Last Dragon Chronicles_, God is the first dragon, named Godith. _All_ dragon's names start with G. Every last one.
-   He never actually makes an appearance in Good Omens, but his plans and motives are speculated about a lot. His ineffable nature is invoked by an angel in an argument that helps stop the apocalypse.
-   H. P. Lovecraft subverted the notion of an omnipotent god perfectly. He gives us many gods of varying unspeakable power, but the undoubtedly omnipotent one is Azathoth, who is not a loving, merciful creator who watches his beloved creations from on high, but is an incomprehensible mass of literal, mindless chaos that dreams up and devours entire realities randomly. The only reason we still exist is not because we're loved, it's because Azathoth is _asleep_.
-   Christ is a Death by Origin Story character via accounts of Thomas Didymus in _Dirg For Prester John_, but whether or not he was divine is unclear. God proper is highly debated through the series.
-   _His Dark Materials_ is about killing God. Yeah. Though in the third book it's revealed that God isn't actually "evil", just senile, and that he isn't the creator, just the first angel to be born. And when Lyra and Will free him from his protective cage, he's so fragile and old that he's killed by a brush of the wind. _However_, it's _also_ implied that the idea of "God" as we know it, as an omnipotent, omniscient creator of everything, doesn't have a physical or tangible form in the first place, instead existing in Dust, the fabric of The Multiverse and the substance of conscious human thought and knowledge. In other words, God is _everything_. **Wow**.
-   In _Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid_, the dialogue "Little Harmonic Labyrinth" presents GOD as the union of an infinite hierarchy of djinns. "GOD" is a Recursive Acronym for "GOD Over Djinn." In the following chapter, where djinns become a metaphor for natural numbers, the significance of naming the set of all djinns "GOD" is explained by quoting the mathematician Leopold Kronecker: "God made the natural numbers; all the rest is the work of man."
-   Nyx makes frequent appearances in _The House of Night_ and the occasional reminder that Dark Is Not Evil and Light Is Not Good.
-   Aslan is of course Narnia's version of Christ. God the Father is 'The Emperor Beyond the Sea'.
-   _The Divine Comedy_: In the thirty-third canto of the third part of the poem, the last 100 lines is dedicated to describing Him, a task Dante admits is like accurately recalling something you saw 25 centuries ago or speaking wisely with an infant's knowledge. Dante illustrates God as a figure that is made up of three circles which somehow look as if they are a single circle. One of the circles looks like it's begotten from the first circle and the third looks like fire being produced by both. That begotten circle strangely has the same color as the rest of the circles while also bearing the hue of humanity, a fact which encapsulates Dante. Although he tries to take the whole of that great light into his mind, Dante admits he is too weak for that, but the light granted him what his mind had asked for.
    
    _"Here force failed my high fantasy; but  
    my desire and will were moved already—like  
    a wheel revolving uniformly—by  
    the Love that moves the sun and the other stars."_
    
-   _Paradise Lost_ initially casts God as the antagonist through Satan's extensive verse. Once the narrative shifts past him, the poem leans towards God's side of things.
-   C.S. Lewis's _The Great Divorce_ is about how various souls in Hell justify rejecting God's invitation to Heaven.
-   Has been mentioned once in Terry Pratchett's _Discworld_ series in the semi-canonical _Eric_. As a side effect of granting the title character's wish to live forever, the wizard Rincewind meets the creator of his universe, described as a mousy man with a scraggly beard. Heavily implied to be an Author Avatar, the man admits he's actually one of several subcontractors who build universes from scratch while their own creator busies Himself with His own creation.
-   _Till We Have Faces_: The Divine Nature is thought by Greek intellectuals (like Fox) to be a single, all-powerful, and unemotional power who created all things and assigns their destinies. While Fox's logical proofs and scholarly arguments suit the needs of priests and politicians, the old Priest of Ungit maintains that gods must be found in mystery and sacrifice rather than writing and navel-gazing. Every worshiper in the novel affirms the Priest's criticism of Fox.
-   _The Crimson Shadow_: Unlike in most fantasy worlds, God is mentioned as the deity people believe in and focus of their religion (however, we get basically no details besides this). There's also no mention of a Jesus figure, though otherwise it seems to be a fantastic Christianity, with priests and cathedrals in major cities.
-   In _Once_, the _faerefolkis_, elemental ecological nurturers, dwell in "the spirit of nature... the source of everything." Herein, the presence of "the Creator Being" is innately apparent to them.
-   _God's Debris_ reveals that God Himself wanted to experience the only thing He hasn't yet known: His own death. His suicide is what humans now know as the Big Bang. The titular debris from His death is matter and probability, and gravity is Him slowly regenerating.
-   _Sword of Truth_: Mostly just a superstition; the Creator is seen by most of the main characters as, at best, a force of balance.
-   _Bazil Broketail_: The Great Mother is described as having the attributes usually given to God, i.e. being creator of everything, omnibenevolent, omnipotent, omnipresent etc. Her followers don't necessarily deny that other gods exist, but insist they're lesser beings created by her. Also no images are made of her, aligning with Abrahamic prohibitions.

    Live-Action TV 

-   God appears in various forms as a major character in _Joan of Arcadia_.
-   Though Heaven, Hell, and a living personification of all evil exist in the Buffyverse, God is almost conspicuous in His absence. Buffy herself comments that there's "nothing solid" on the matter. However, there are The Powers That Be. They may be gods, but they're not God. It's implied that a divine miracle occurred in Season 3 when it snowed to prevent Angel from committing "Suicide by Sunrise." However, it's left ambiguous enough that it _could_ also have been Santa Claus looking out for vampires with souls. The whole "White Christmas" thing being his entire shtick and all.
    -   Or Jasmine. Could be Jasmine, saving her future grandfather. Which would explain a lot of stuff behind Angel's motivation in Season 5.
-   Cited as the prime mover behind Sam's inability to get home in _Quantum Leap_. (Or, more accurately, as the force which caused the Quantum Leap Project to go awry in the particular way that it did; the series finale heavily implies that Sam is subconsciously keeping _himself_ from getting home.)
-   _Good Omens (2019)_: God acts as the narrator of Season 1, and just like Her literary counterpart, she is described as "ineffable", with Her true plan for the universe completely unknowable. However, unlike the rest of Heaven, who are shown as Tautological Templars who _want_ the apocalypse to happen because they think it's how the Great Plan is supposed to go and resemble their demonic counterparts a lot more than they would like to admit, She appears to genuinely love humanity and it's cited that she may have planned for Armageddon to be averted, and whether or not the end of the world is actually the "Ineffable Plan" is what gets Heaven and Hell to back down.
-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power_: Eru Ilúvatar is invoked opaquely as the One, the Keeper of the Secret Fire, the father of all sapient beings of Middle-earth.
-   God appears inside _Herman's Head_ once, taking the form of Leslie Nielsen to better meet Herman's expectations.
-   In season 1 finale of _The Sarah Silverman Program_, the titular character meets, is saved by, sleeps with, and then dumps the Morgan Freemanesque entity which she refers to as "Black God." When God makes his first appearance, she asks him, consistent with her character's casual racism, "Are you God's black friend?" A later episode has them reconciling and briefly dating, and God is portrayed as clingy, emotionally insecure, and prone to coming on too strong.
-   _Supernatural_: God, the creator of the universe, is living incognito on Earth disguised as the prophet Chuck Shurley. Although initially He played an active part in his creation, at some point after Lucifer's fall He abandoned the Host of Heaven and left them to their own devices, to the point where some believed Him to be dead. Only four archangels, the first ones created, had actually seen God, in addition to the similarly-missing scribe Metatron, and the kindly gardener Joshua (God's only confidante during his leave). He doesn't really care about stopping the Apocalypse after Lucifer's release. However, when The Anti-God returns from her prison in season 11, who is actually capable of killing Him, he reveals His true identity and enlists the Winchesters' help to stop her. God is at different times flawed, absent, benevolent, overworked, or capricious. He really just considers Himself a writer. In Season 14, it becomes clear that God has actually been much more malevolent this whole time, making the Winchesters suffer all these years for his own amusement. He becomes the final Big Bad in season 15 and the Greater-Scope Villain for the entire series.
-   In _St. Elsewhere_, Howie Mandell met God in an out-of-body experience. God was also played by Howie Mandell. As he explained, "I made you in my own image, didn't I?"
-   Gets a minor reference in _NCIS_:
-   _30 Rock_ has a show-within-a-show called _God Cop_, in which God teams up with a New York detective and they fight crime. The writers quickly have trouble coming up with reasons why God can't solve a given episode's problem instantly.
-   In the second-to-last episode of _Rev._, a bizarre cliche-spouting tramp played by an uncredited Liam Neeson shows up exactly when Adam, the titular vicar, is going through a particularly tough time in his life. It's heavily implied that he's God when, completely out of the blue, his personality shifts and he suddenly knows Adam's name despite having no possible way of having learned it.
-   God appears in late-season _The X-Files_... as a ratings stunt! Here he's played by Burt Reynolds, adding a salty, world-weariness to the role. In "Improbable", God is sitting at a bar playing cards with himself whilst watching over one of his troubled souls, willing him to make better choices in life without actually giving him any options because he has to make that choice himself. The distress on God's face when the man heads into the toilets to kill again despite every opportunity he has had to walk away reveals a momentary disappointment in the species he has created. The fact that a man heads to the machine that Vicky was playing on and scores a jackpot just as she is murdered goes to prove what a bitch fate can be.
-   _Legend of the Seeker_: The Creator is the benevolent being who made humanity, and eventually (probably) is born a mortal woman to guide things against her evil counterpart, the Keeper of the Underworld, which is similar to Jesus in Christian belief.
-   A little girl appears in one episode of the first season of _The Umbrella Academy (2019)_, appearing to Klaus after his death in episode seven, when he wakes up in a black-and-white world, riding a bicycle, dispensing cryptic bits of information, and mentioning that she made everyone. Much different from the comics version, who is a cowboy.

    Memes 

-   In the lolcat universe, Ceiling Cat fills the role. He battles to save souls against Basement Cat.
-   Jokes about God being disgusted by humanity's depravity, whether jokingly or not, are pretty common. Some of the most popular ones are "God has left the chat", "Noah, get the boat", "Do you think God stays in Heaven because He too lives in fear of what He's created?", "I've come to hate my own creation! Now I know how God feels.", etc.

    Music 

-   According to John Lennon on _John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band_, "God is a concept by which we measure our pain."
-   In one of the songs that are a part of the Happiness Series of Vocaloid songs, Hatsune Miku is a goddess (and specifically referred to as just GOD in one part of the song), and while she seems nice at the beginning of the song, it quickly turns into her being an egotistical and sadistic goddess who enjoys humanity's suffering, wants the praise of humanity, and eventually wants to kill all humans.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Demon: The Fallen_: God is a major character in the background fluff, although not so much in the actual game campaigns. All the Fallen have known God personally at the dawn of time, but ever since their Rebellion and incarceration in the Abyss came to hate Him (except the relatively small Reconciler faction). There are also indications that in oWoD, God is actually female and that She has sacrificed Her life to save the world centuries before the Fallen broke free from the Abyss. The only ones giving any info on the subject are the same demons who hate God's guts, so the proverbial grain of salt is necessary here...
-   _Dragonlance_ has the Highgod, who created the lesser deities but has only intervened in Krynn's history to prevent its destruction. Chaos is the entity that opposes the High God, and it is from Chaos that the universe was created.
-   _Forgotten Realms_: The Overgod Ao (who created the universe that Faerûn inhabits) is visited by his "boss" in the Avatar Trilogy. He is described as a "being of pure light" and is strongly implied to be the Abrahamic God.
-   _KULT_: He's called the Demiurge, and is evil: Humans were immortal superbeings before he took all our powers away and made us what we are.
-   _In Nomine_: God is one of the central figures in the backstory. He is the Abrahamic God — and also the deity of other monotheistic faiths, such as the Zoroastrian supreme deity Ahura Mazda — the creator of Heaven and Earth, and the omnipotent source of everything that exists. He very explicitly considers humanity to be the most important part of His creation; the War between the angels and the demons was first precipitated when He and Lucifer... disagreed on this point. He also hasn't spoken directly to His creations ever since the Fall, outside of breaking up the trials of two Archangels, although divine favor may occasionally smile on angels and righteous mortals. In-game, this is represented by having Heaven-aligned characters succeed at any task where they roll three ones, representing the Trinity; depending on the situation, the gravity of the moment, and the GM's whim, this can range from a simple convenient coincidence to a vital clue being illuminated by a beam of light to the mighty hand of God descending from the heavens to crush an obstacle in a player's way.

    Theater 

-   In _The Green Pastures_, a Setting Update of the Old Testament to modern-day (actually, 1920s) Louisiana, God is the main character. He is continually disappointed by the human race screwing up.

    Video Games 

-   The _Shin Megami Tensei_ games have an... interesting relationship with God, to say the least. (Although there are occasional exceptions.)
    -   In _Shin Megami Tensei I_, he makes no direct appearance, but everyone on his side is working to build a kingdom on Earth where all men and demons shall fall prostrate before him for eternity, even completing a massive Cathedral that will serve as his Terrestrial Throne, and from all appearances, even though he doesn't show up, God approves of the above. We also learn that he long ago sealed away all the other demons and deprived them of the right to meddle in Man's affairs, but now they are back and aren't leaving without a fight.
    -   In _Shin Megami Tensei II_, He is specifically named as YHVH and is a vain dictator who has created the universe in such a way that it will be subjugated under him forever. He essentially states that He exists because people believe in Him, making _humanity_ the real source of all evil.
    -   In _Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne_, it is heavily implied that Kagutsuchi is a facet of God and that He is the "true enemy" of all who live.
    -   In _Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey_, it is implied that the evil God from the other games has been broken into pieces in the game's backstory and that his pieces have got a life of their own. The game also reveals, albeit subtly that God forgot his love for humans.
    -   In the first _Devil Survivor_, he's not seen, but implied to be, as opposed to his other appearances, very reasonable, and though his angels wanted to subjugate the Earth as soon as demons came back, he was the one who decided humanity should have one last chance to save themselves and decide their fate. However, the Updated Re-release soon revealed the big guy pushed the Abel And Cain scenario in order to create the first martyr and the first murderer, the latter of which has been punished nonstop _since biblical times._ All of this, of course, makes it clear he has _severe_ issues with free will.
-   God is one of the many, many, _many_ things that will show up in _Scribblenauts_ if you type him into the game. He's strong enough to beat up the Kraken and Cthulhu (at least with the aid of a shotgun and skateboard), but not strong enough to kill Death.
-   "Creator" is the final boss of the first _The Final Fantasy Legend_ game. The player can kill him in one hit using the Saw weapon due to a Good Bad Bug. This is referenced in _Romancing SaGa_ as a legend of a man who challenged a god, and the weapon is available for the party to use if you can find it.
-   _Final Fantasy XIII_. The whole trigger of the plot is that the fal'Cie want to summon God by creating a mass sacrifice/slaughter of humans, hoping that the violence is enough to attract His attention. Even the fal'Cie Orphan, who's the one supporting all of Cocoon in the first place, has a death wish for that reason. The fal'Cie can't do it on their own, though.
-   God is a Superboss in _Dragon Quest VII_. The greatest power of the Supreme Being? Terrible jokes.
-   Xenosaga has U-DO, God in the very Gnostic sense, a sort of manifestation of the collective unconscious in a single rather alien consciousness.
-   Similarly, _Xenogears_ has U-DO's more-or-less equivalent, the Wave-Existence, who seems a like a decent enough omnipotent being, it just happens to be trapped in a malevolent planet destroying machines.
-   _Dragon Age_ calls him The Maker. But there's no doubt that it's Him, with his church being modeled heavily after the Catholic _and_ the Eastern Church, and the story of his Prophetess being an amalgam of Jesus, Mary, Mohammed, and Joan of Arc.
    -   Also a case of Have You Seen My Maker? as He got fed up with humanity's sins and left them to rot after they executed His Prophetess. And defiled His city in the Fade. Or so His Chantry says.
-   _Bayonetta_ has Jubileus, who is referred to as "The Creator" by just about all other bosses in the game and her Boss Subtitle is Dea, which is Latin for goddess. It is worth noting that despite her status as God, she is not the hardest boss in the game... that honor goes to Rodin. She's also not the only God in the game; it's revealed she's only the Creator-God of Paradiso, and at the end of the game, Bayonetta summons the Dea of Inferno, Queen Sheba, who kicks Jubileus's soul right out of her body and Hurl It into the Sun.
-   In _Bayonetta 2_, it's revealed each realm within the Trinity of Realities has its own Creator-God; Paradiso has Jubileus, Inferno has Queen Sheba, and the human world has Aesir, who actually split his form into a good half (Loki) and an evil half (Loptr) after he sacrificed his power to give humankind free will. There's also Omni, who looks like a Fusion Dance of Jubileus and Queen Sheba, but is actually a completely unexplained third entity.
-   Random soldiers in _Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker_ will occasionally claim they had a vision of God in the back of a truck. If you choose to investigate, you can find God and _recruit him to MSF_. He has the highest Intel stat in the game, but apparently E-rank cooking skill. He's actually Hideo Kojima himself, foreshadowed somewhat by a minor character being named Cosima Caminandes (written in kana as 'kojima kaminandesu', or "Kojima is god").
-   God (or some form thereof) also appears infrequently the _Tales_ series.
    -   _Tales of Eternia_ makes God (or Seyfert as He's known here) into a _total dude_. He _gives you_ the Infinity Plus One Skills needed to defeat the Big Bad.
    -   In _Abyss_, we have Lorelei, the aggregate sentience of the Seventh Fonon which has a Christianity-like religion centred around it (complete with a Jesus parallel, although it's a little different in that she's female). The game is a little unsure on whether or not it's actually _the_ God equivalent of the _Abyss_ world or a Crystal Dragon Jesus.
-   _Arc Rise Fantasia_ features three gods although two of them are effectively magic rocks... it's complicated, but only one of them is a true "God" parallel. She is also a _massive_ woobie, to the extent that if you aren't close to tears in the ending, there is something seriously wrong with you. L'Arc, You Bastard!.
-   In _The Simpsons Game_, God is the final boss. As if that wasn't crazy enough, you get to fight him in a DDR parody, complete with a remix of the Scorpions' "Rock You Like A Hurricane" as the final boss theme!
-   In _The Binding of Isaac_, God calls to Isaac's mother to make a sacrifice using her son, thus starting the game's events. God later saves Isaac's life at the last second, either out of a Heel–Face Turn, to parallel the original story in that it was all a test, though unlike Abraham, it drove Mom insane… or maybe Mom was just insane all along and imagined she heard God's voice, and God went to stop her.
-   The Golden Spider from _Asura's Wrath_, is a Big Bad example that spins the threads of all of existence, allowed the Deities of the game to use Mantra, and made the gohma attack to test the Deities' resolve.
    -   His real name is Chakravartin, which means Ideal Universal Ruler in Hindu Mythology. Unfortunately, He's evil, and doesn't really fit the Benevolent part that being an Ideal Universal Ruler comes with being.
    -   This being _Asura's Wrath_, though, there's only one logical end to the entire tale. That end being sucker-punching God in the mouth for making your little girl cry.
-   The _Pokémon_ franchise has Arceus, a gold and white Pokémon who apparently hatched out of a Cosmic Egg and created the Pokémon universe with 1000 arms (although its form is quadrupedal). It also created several other legendary Pokémon. It is certainly possible to have this creator deity under your control in the games.
    -   Though only a fragment of it, as revealed in _Pokémon Legends: Arceus_.
-   The final boss of _Oh...Sir!! The Insult Simulator_ is Father, who is portrayed as a Grandpa God and looks and sounds like Morgan Freeman.
-   The True Final Boss of _Hollow Knight_ is clearly an expy of God, with the plot of the game amounting to "what if the Jewish people were not enslaved and the Pharaoh had tried to stop the ten plagues of Egypt?"

    Webcomics 

-   _Muertitos_ depicts God and Satan as the patriarchs of two clans of feuding rednecks.
-   In this _Loserz_ strip. For some unexplained reason, he hates the protagonist Eric so much that it makes his eyeballs bleed, probably to parody the phrase 'God Hates Me', by taking it literally.
-   _Koan of the Day_ features a scene in which the tortoise deduces that God is no better than a bite of lettuce.
-   God shows up periodically in _Dinosaur Comics_, represented by bold text spoken from the top of the panel.
-   In _Breakfast of the Gods_, God is the Quaker Oats Quaker, the first cereal mascot.
-   God and Jesus make frequent appearances in _Overcompensating_. God is depicted in the typical old man with long hair and a long beard wearing a robe. However, the robe is clearly a bathrobe and he dwells in a trailer park for some reason.
-   God talks to Jesus off-panel in a _Penny Arcade_ comic. Jesus makes frequent appearances.
-   God has appeared twice in _Something\*Positive_.
    -   Like almost everybody else in the strip, God is portrayed as a Jerkass who especially hates Davan and Mike and ignores prayers to Him in lieu of watching shit happen to them.
    -   He also made up the whole "Homosexuality angers God" business so that He could watch lesbian couples having sex with each other to spite Him. It's not made clear if the spite is needed in order to invoke His name so that He is allowed to watch, if invoking His name merely alerts him to the location the act is taking place, or if the spite is just part of His kink.
-   God pops up rather frequently in _Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal_ strips, in which He is depicted as a large yellow disk/sphere; a halo from classical depictions of saints and Biblical figures. "Why do you look like a golden pizza?"<small>◊</small> He's usually found behaving in rather questionable ways.
-   Although he doesn't appear directly, God is an indirect presence behind the scenes in _Misfile_, depicted as an all-knowing entity that lets his angelic bureaucracy handle the actual work… or does he?
-   Lord Cyrios, the creator of the _Daily Grind_ universe, has never appeared directly in the comic, but the Fae claim to be will-less bodies inhabited by his spirit, and several dead characters — like Tharka's sister Benjamina and Jolene's Mentor Stenni Eelstad — have shown up saying they work for him now.
-   _Fans!_ has God interfere with Rikk's making a Deal with the Devil to save his friends.
    
    "He did not realized what you have known for years.
    
    "Which is what, just to refresh my memory?
    
    "There is more than one being in the universe who desires souls. I am not Satan. I AM THAT I AM!"
    
-   In _Jack_, God is a more-or-less constant presence behind the scenes, since the comic is essentially about the morality of the afterlife, and how to deal with it. When she finally showed up in the flesh, so to speak, she manifested as a sheep.
-   _Sluggy Freelance_ had one (just off-screen) appearance by God, though this was a near-death experience hallucination _and_ part of unreliable narration. Also, He urinated on Kiki's head. One reader on the forums was offended.
-   _Shortpacked!_ has God appear every once in a while, usually trying to get people to bring back _Enterprise_. Jesus has also shown up (though the person he appeared before had just had a nasty knock on the head), eating a chocolate Easter cross.
    
    **Robin:** ...why are you eating a chocolate Easter cross?  
    **Jesus:** Did you know they sell these at the grocery store? What the _fuck_ dude?
    
-   God in _Planescape Survival Guide_ is more freqently called "Eldest" or "Aoskar," and appears in the form of a large red-bearded man. He is not the only god, however, and the betrayal of his wife thousands of years ago split his soul amongst 3 sacred artifacts and left his body without memory. He has since been put back together, but is now held captive and being drained of his essence by the Nothing.
-   In _Sinfest_, God appears as hands popping out of clouds holding signs or wearing hand puppets. He has a snarky sense of humor, enjoys poking fun at the main characters, and loves to make the Devil his Butt-Monkey. He hasn't shown up as much in the last few years' worth of strips, although his influence shows up in more subtle ways.
-   God is mentioned off-handedly in _Narbonic_. Apparently, Mel kicked him in the nuts.
    
    **Mel:** He took it pretty well. Real class act.
    
-   _The Perry Bible Fellowship_: One strip<small>◊</small> has God depicted as the all-seeing eye. Hmm. A great eye that sees all? Sounds a bit like Sauron. That or the all-seeing eye on the back of the US $1 note.
-   God plays a main role in _Holy Bibble_, showing up mostly in the backstory as a morally ambiguous, dark hooded figure.
-   _Kill Six Billion Demons_: Creation began with the birth of YISUN, an omnipotent, omniscient being with perfect mastery over all things. However, YISUN was completely alone, and so committed holy suicide to create the universe. Despite this being a well-known fact, many in-universe myths have him as an active character speaking and imparting lessons.
    
    **YISUN:** Let there not be a genesis, for beginnings are false and I am a consummate liar.
    
-   _Beyond the End_: While God isn't seen directly, he is regularly referenced as existing by angels and demons alike. When confronted with the other religions and gods that exist within Purgatory, End will push the existence of the One True God, leading to others recognising how sheltered he has been after a lifetime in Heaven.

    Web Original 

-   LOLCats: Ceiling Cat.
-   In the _Mr. Deity_ series of on YouTube shorts, God is interpreted as Mr. Deity, a Hollywood Executive type who, although essentially well-meaning, is a bit vague, thoughtless, and temperamental, with a slightly alarming tolerance for various evils and unpleasantness. He also bears a startling resemblance to George Lucas.
-   O Criador ("The Creator"), a popular Brazilian twitter account.
-   In the Journal Roleplay _MS Elegante_, Captain Redd is every deity rolled into one.
-   Shortly after 9/11, God made an appearance in The Onion.
-   In _The Salvation War_, God declares that the gates of Heaven are closed, and that everyone is going to Hell so they should just lay down and die. Humanity doesn't take this very well. He was killed on July 14th 2010 by the Archangel Michael.
-   On Channel Awesome, a God-like stand-in called Santa Christ makes occasional appearances, usually doing something incredibly awesome and helpful (like erasing a reviewer's memories of a horrible movie) and then doing something else very nice for the reviewer (such as curing their diabetes or giving them a present). Everyone is always very happy to see him. In the second year anniversary video, he is shot, but rises from the grave in three days. When the Chick asks why it took a full three days, he points out that she never rose from the grave and thus has no point of reference.
-   The Creator in the _Whateley Universe_ is said to be the only entity more powerful than the Lovecraftian Outer Gods.
-   God in _Messed Up Bible Stories_ on YouTube (see here), who is portrayed as a speaking, glowing ball of light.
-   _SCP Foundation_:
    -   SCP-343. Made ambiguous in that some theorized that he might just be a really powerful and self-controlled Reality Warper.
    -   There are several other SCP that are also implied to be God as well, although 343 is the most well-known one.
-   A meme depicts the universe, layers-of-an-onion style starting with Earth and ending with "The observable universe". The last panel (presumably depicting the outside of the universe) is an old man yelling instructions.
-   _DarkMatter2525_: A common character in the cartoons, portrayed stereotypically as a bearded white man in the clouds. He's generally neglectful and cruel toward his creation.
-   While not present in the original series, He is invoked in _Hellsing Ultimate Abridged_ to aid Anderson in defeating Alucard. He is not inherently good or evil (comes across more as aloof while Satan is shown to be quite affable), but mostly handles Alucard like a disappointed father disciplining a violent son. While Alucard has some legitimate reasons to reject His forgiveness, He does not make it a point to press the issue more than He must.
-   Of course, mentioned in _Bible Illustrated_, mostly represented as Jesus.
-   God shows up in the last episode of _Monster Lab (2021)_ to speak to Katz. He looks like Steve Harvey.

    Western Animation 

-   God shows up in the _Drawn Together_ episode "Gay Bash" to declare that, despite what Princess Clara says, he _doesn't_ hate homosexuals, and he thinks fundamentalists are assholes (and homosexuals are adorable).
-   _Futurama_:
    -   In the episode "Godfellas", Bender has an encounter with a galaxy-sized being that appears to be God (though, in a Shout-Out to _Star Trek_, Bender theorizes that it's the remains of a satellite that collided with God). It seems to care about living creatures, but espouses a "light touch" philosophy to keep them from dependency. God also has a cameo in _Bender's Big Score_, wherein he makes a sound of surprise and coughs up a Timey-Wimey Ball in response to the speaking of the universal time code.
    -   Robot God appears in the Season 6 episode "Ghost in the Machines", while Yivo from the second movie _The Beast with a Billion Backs_ has elements of the Judeo-Christian God (albeit slightly twisted ones).<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   One of the three main characters of the short-lived _God, the Devil and Bob_. He's depicted as a laidback Nice Guy usually carrying a can of light beer and wearing sunglasses. He's also Invisible to Adults, with the exception of Bob.
-   God doesn't actually show up, but in an episode of _Justice League Unlimited_, Hawkgirl and Diana are fighting monsters/demons in Tartarus/Hell and all of a sudden the demons back off and Hawkgirl realizes why.
    
    **Hawkgirl:** That's right, I'm an _angel_. You can mess with me if you want to, but I don't think you want to mess with _the Boss_. (_points up_)
    
    -   Ironically, Hawkgirl is an atheist.
-   Seth MacFarlane:
    -   God and Jesus both show up from time to time on _Family Guy_, with God being depicted as a bit of a wannabe ladies man with a thing for sniper rifles, who is embarrassed when someone reads from the book of Job. Unlike in _The Simpsons_, God is shown full-body with, naturally, Mac Farlane's voice instead of the traditional deep bass. God is also depicted as every other stereotypical male; drunk, hits on the women, and loves to party.
    -   In _American Dad!_, also by MacFarlane, God is depicted as... Angelina Jolie. Though this was just a form taken to keep Steve's (limited) attention. Looking into the "rack of infinite wisdom" turned Steve into a prophet, who had a solution to all conflict in the Middle East. In a later episode God is depicted as... well, he looks a bit more like Sean Connery.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   As said, God has shown up in _The Simpsons_. His face is never shown on screen, except for a couple of occasions. He's also the only character with five fingers. As well as five thighs.
-   In their usual style, _South Park_ depicts God as a bizarre-looking and somewhat surly mandrill/hippo creature in "Are You There, God? It's Me, Jesus". And he's a Buddhist who only lets Mormons into Heaven.
-   While They don't appear in person, God or something like them exists in _Castlevania (2017)_. Something is certainly empowering Holy Water and Trevor's consecrated whip so they are harmful to demons and vampires. Blue Fangs the demon even references God directly in its Breaking Speech to the corrupt bishop.
-   _Smiling Friends_: God shows up at the end of "Charlie Dies and Doesn't Come Back" to rescue Charlie from Satan. He's a giant with a glowing ball of light for a face, built like a Greek god... and has the shrieking voice of Gilbert Gottfried.
