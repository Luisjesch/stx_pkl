_"I know a girl who's got eyes on her feet  
So when she starts dreaming she roams  
And she'll know where she's going"_

— **The Cat Empire**, "So Long"

Eyes in places where they just don't belong are a good way to creep people out. The palms of your hands are a particularly frequent place to put them, but they can be anywhere on the body.

Subtrope of Body Horror. See also Eyeless Face, Faceless Eye and The Walls Have Eyes. May overlap with Eldritch Abomination and Extra Eyes. Contrast Third Eye.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Ayakashi Triangle_: An iyo Yayo runs into with her sisters has an grapefruit-sized bulging out of its mouth.
-   _Berserk_:
    -   Many of the demonic once-human apostles have eyes in multiple locations on their bodies, but special mention goes to the "Idea of Evil", the God of Evil responsible for the world being such a cesspool of crap and suffering. It basically looks like a colossal misshapen heart with its valves spewing out webs of causality to manipulate humanity's fate and lined on all sides with countless eyes upon closer inspection.
    -   The giant Sea God has dozens of eyeballs _covering its heart_. Each one was staring at Guts the entire time he was trying to destroy it.
-   The members of the Third Eye in _Black Clover_ each have this on their foreheads to the Forbidden Magic used to resurrect them. It opens whenever they tap into the power of Forbidden Magic.
-   _Bleach_:
    -   When Zommari performs his Resurrección, the lower half of his body becomes the test of a sea urchin. Instead of being covered in a sea urchin's tubercles, he's instead covered in eyes that open wide to shoot Zommari's 'Amor' to control the enemy. Zommari's hands, chest and forehead are also covered in eyes that can perform the same function.
    -   One of the transformations that Aizen undergoes includes the transformation of his wings, which end in eyeless skulls; the eyes appear in the centre of the wings instead. When his monstrous face bursts out from the skin of his previous face, he also has a third eye on his forehead.
    -   The Hollow Ayon is created when the Arrancars Appaci, Mila Rose and Sung-Sun combine their left arms. It is impossible to sneak up on him as he has an eye in the back of his head.
    -   Upon completing the absorption of the Spirit King, Yhwach's body, and the ground around him, becomes warped by shadow. The top half of his head no longer details either human eyes or even a forehead. Instead giant malformed eyes of varying sizes cover his face. Eyes also appear across his shoulders and neck. Wherever the shadow touches his body, eyes appear. They even seem to be forming across the ground that is intimately connected to his body via the shadows.
    -   Stern Ritter C, Pernida, has one eye on _its_ palm, except that Pernida itself is a giant hand. Later on it starts growing eyes everywhere on the rest of its 'body', such as the finger knuckles.
-   Because _D.Gray-Man_ is apparently trying to set a record with the "Most types of terror in a series" they've recently introduced the Noah "Fiddler," who has a large number of eyes _on his tongue_ which can _pop out_ and be placed inside other people's bodies.
-   _Death Note_: The spine art of the last manga volume features a Shinigami shaped like an amorphous blob with eyes all around its body. This is Nu, the highest-ranking Shinigami in the Shinigami Realm (right below the Shinigami King, who is seen as something of a god among them). According to _13: How to Read_, she is female. She is also briefly seen in the beginning of the second anime OP.
-   Duskmon<small>◊</small> from _Digimon Frontier_ has a number of extra eyes all over his body. And one of his attacks is to fire lasers from them.
-   _The Elder Sister-like One_: In her demon form Chiyo has a necklace of eyeballs. They apparently work. As a rule of thumb, the more eyeballs she is wearing, the less human she is at that moment.
-   Runa from _Fairy Navigator Runa_ has one on the back of her neck.
-   _Franken Fran_: The embryo in Chapter 26 has two dozen eyes in _one eye socket_. Oddly enough, it loses them when it's born and becomes the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
-   Several of the Homunculi from _Fullmetal Alchemist_ qualify for this. The manga version of Envy turns into a monster-thing with screaming faces randomly scattered across its body. Pride has a Living Shadow _full_ of eyes. And mouths. And he's based on Father's original form, a blob of shadow with a single eye and mouth. Father himself eventually turns into a walking, eye- and mouth-covered man made of shadows. He doesn't even bother to form a normal face, having a single enormous eye and a too-wide mouth where his head would be.
-   Alucard from _Hellsing_ has a tendency to sprout eyes whenever his powers are released — on his chest, or a floating wall of eyes in the room.
-   In _Hell Teacher Nube_, a beautiful yet kleptomaniac Lonely Rich Kid named Ai Shinozaki suddenly starts growing an additional eye on the back of her hand whenever she steals something, because even if _no one_ sees her steal, _her heart_ does, and now everyone will know she's a thief. Poor Ai tries stabbing it out (to no small amount of pain, and not to mention she's a _violinist_) but it doesn't just keep growing back, it brings friends all over her body. She seeks Nube's aid, and he warns of someone who became nothing but a giant mess of eyes and flesh; she _almost_ suffers the same fate until her only friend Makoto's affection redeems her (the eyes would disappear as soon as the culprit confessed their actions out of their own will; once Ai told Makoto that she was a thief, they were gone).
-   Natsume Zange of _Inu × Boku SS_ is a descendant of a Hundred-Eyes monster, and thus has eyes all over his body that he keeps mostly hidden under layers of clothes, along with an eyepatch.
-   After a major Power-Up, Naraku from _Inuyasha_ acquires eyes on the back of his hands and in the middle of his chest.

-   _Naruto_:
    -   A disturbing example with Danzo's whole _arm_. He not only has ten Sharingan eyes taken from dead Uchiha grafted into his arm and palm of his hand, but his shoulder has a _human face_ from Orochimaru's genetic experimentation on infants.
    -   In chapter 700+5 of the New Era's Gaiden series, the new Big Bad not only has a whole armful of Sharigan like Danzo, he also has several on the back, the side and the top of his head.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_: In _End of Evangelion_, Lilith/Rei gets a third eye technically on her forehead. This in and of itself isn't that odd. What makes it qualify for this trope is that it's also in the middle of a _giant vagina_. For that matter, Gendo Ikari ends up with a third eye in his hand, where the embryonic Adam has been grafted in place; in the manga version, Gendo has actually swallowed Adam, and it manifests as a large eye in the middle of his left hand.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Pudding is the daughter of Big Mom and a father from a not-yet-seen race of three-eyed tribesmen, and has inherited her father's deformity. It also grants her a few Psychic Powers and — possibly — the ability to read poneglyphs, something her father's tribe could do. She usually hides it under her long bangs, as she was an outcast as a child because of it.
    -   Nico Robin, thanks to her Devil Fruit, can make any part of her body "pop" anywhere like a flower. This includes, on at least one occasion, making eyes appear on her arms and hands. Or on the walls... or the ceiling... or the floor... or her opponents... One rather unsettling "trick" she learned to do post-Time Skip using her Devil Fruit power was to quickly search an entire city by causing hundreds of arms to sprout out of the buildings, each with an eye on the palm, letting her look everywhere at once.
-   Played with in _Pani Poni Dash!_: Rebecca was annoying everyone beyond the breaking point, and being 11, is easily frightened. Rei goes up to her and opens her hand to reveal an eye (sticker), scaring her to go hide behind a curtain.
-   In the manga _Parasyte_, the parasites can, as part of their total transformation skills, create eyes on any part of their body (that is, the actual parasite flesh — they can't do it with the human body they've taken over). While parasites normally replace the head of their host, main character Shinichi and supporting character Uda have parasites in their right hand and neck/upper chest respectively. Shinichi's parasite, Migi, is particularly fond of putting out long tentacle-like stalks with eyes on the end to look at things Shinichi can't see.
-   _Samurai Deeper Kyo_ has Hishigi, who has kept himself alive by implanting Devil Eyes in the left side of his body.
-   Played for laughs in a chapter/episode of _Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei_, where the eponymous sensei must avoid eye-contact to avoid an Arranged Marriage; his butler thwarts his plans by bringing in a guy who is entirely covered (or made) of eyeballs.
-   In _So I'm a Spider, So What?_ Shiraori has four eyes within each of her eyes which look around independently of each other. Even she's grossed out by this so she keeps her eyes shut.
-   _Soul Eater_: The Big Bad Kishin uses this as a motif. His face has three eyes, and his bangs are shaded in such a way as to look like eyes as well. Even his pupils double back and look like another set of eyes.
    -   The set of three eyes turn up on people who are either hallucinating due to proximity to Asura, or are in someway associated with madness (see Justin's Madness/Evil Makeover).
    -   Mosquito briefly grows a bunch of extra eyes in the same socket when between transformations. While his next form mostly crossed the Bishōnen Line, close-up occasionally show it with five pupils in a line.
-   When Orb Owl is corrupted into an Antinoid in _Superwomen in Love!_, Antinoid Fish Eyes form on her limbs, stomach, and forehead, while her normal two eyes are shut.
-   _The☆Ultraman_ has a one-eyed kaiju called Bagon, whose sole eye is on a stalk growing from its _chin_. Eye-beard?
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_:
-   _YuYu Hakusho_:
    -   Hiei turned green and gained eyes all over his body and arms when he transformed to kick Yusuke's ass. Ironically, he has no eyes on his back which is also his Achilles' Heel.
    -   Itsuki's shadow hands are covered in eyes.

    Art 

-   _Carta Marina_: The "monster seen in 1537", called a "sea-hog" in the commentary, has three additional eyes on each side of his body, making eight eyes in total.
-   One of the bizarre demons in Michelangelo Buonarroti's _The Torment of Saint Anthony_ has a pair of eyes on its butt that form an upside-down face with a mouth that's also down there.
-   One of Khalil Gibran's illustrations for his book _The Prophet_ centers a hand with an eye in its palm, surrounded by a ring of human souls. This is a cosmic allegory of divine omnipotence symbolized by the hand united with divine omniscience symbolized by the eye, orbited by humanity.
    -   This picture went on to inspire an eye-in-the-hand motif in psychedelic art and pop art, such as a portrait of the Beatles with George Harrison's hand displaying an eye in the palm to represent him as the mystic of the group.

    Comic Books 

-   Qiang Wu, the villain of the _Big Trouble in Little China_ comic, has an eye in his hat.
-   There was once a minor DC villain called the Ten-Eyed Man. His only power was having an eye on each of his fingers (he was blinded, so his optic nerves were 'rerouted' to his hands.) Hilariously, the story tried to play this straight as a real threat, with police officers noting "He could easily escape from jail if we didn't constantly keep his hands in a dark box!" The concept was later reincarnated by an author who was a fan of the original character; now, however, it is an entire group of "Ten-Eyed Men" with actual mystical powers. The freaky eyes seem to grant them supernatural sight (and are magic tattoos instead of actual eyeballs). Batman encountered them in _52_.
    -   Amusingly, the Ten-Eyed Man never overcame the reflex to shield his face with his hands. He was defeated when someone threw a cactus at his head.
    -   It didn't even take something really pointy like a cactus. Getting him to grab things was the standard means of defeating him.
-   In _Death Vigil_, when necromancers activate their powers, glowing eyes appear inside sigils on their bodies. Many of the monsters they summon have eyes in unusual places as well.
-   Nineyes from _Float_ (by Yi.magination) has, as her name indicates, nine eyes spread out over her body (head, hands, feet, belly button...) Unlike most other examples here, they are tasteful rather than horrifying; they can only be seen by people with advanced karma, and represent various virtues. Yes, she has eyes on her feet and makes it look good.
-   in the _Gold Digger_ the Djinn race have many members with the eyes in the middle of the torso.
-   Argos makes a brief appearance working for his old boss Hera in _The Incredible Hercules_.
-   "King of the Mountain, Man," an early short comic by Bernie Wrightson, ends with a beautiful woman undressing for the Villain Protagonist cowboy, who immediately loses interest when he sees that she has eyes where her nipples should be.
-   The Antichrist in _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Century 2009_ develops eyes all over his body, and he's pissed off about it. He's also strongly implied to be Harry Potter.
-   The demon Trifors in _Lori Lovecraft: The Big Comeback_ has no facial features on his head, but eyes and a Belly Mouth on his torso.
-   A 1970s Morbius story pitted Morbius against a demonic being called Helleyes, whose body was covered in eyes from head to toe.
-   _X-Men_ student Eye Boy is, naturally enough, covered in eyes. He can see things like magic, though it's hard to say that's really worth having eyeballs on your hands.

    Comic Strips 

-   An old Charles Addams cartoon features the gag of a woman with eyes where her nipples should be. It is funny. And appalling.

-   _Dimensional Gate Screwover_:

-   In Sect, the Immortal of Perspective, Hao Peizhi, seals his wounds by sprouting eyes wherever he is injured. By the end of the fight, his whole face and upper chest are nothing but a mass of ocular tissue.
    -   When Peizhi attempts to manifest his imperfect Finishing Move, his eyes leak out of his sockets and manifest across the landscape instead, leaving trees, earth, and stone covered in unblinking eyes.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Cars 2_: Played for laughs. Mater is a little freaked out by a Parisian car whose eyes are in her headlights instead of her windshield like every other car. (Somewhat understandable when you remember what the headlights stood in for briefly in the first movie).
-   _G.I. Joe: The Movie_: A flashback to Cobra Commander's origin shows the lab accident which originally disfigured him, resulting in multiple eyes all over his face.
-   _Toy Story_: Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head can remove their eyes to see from different angles.
-   _Treasure Planet_: One alien has a set of eyes inside his mouth. Outside material in a Disney magazine states that it enables his species to get a good look at what they're eating.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The ABCs of Death_: Happens in the "L" segment. While looking up the skirt of his female captor, the protagonist sees an eye staring back at him from her crotch. Given his deteriorating physical and mental state at the time, this may have been a hallucination.
-   _Addams Family Values_:
    
    **Gomez:** He has my father's eyes!  
    **Morticia:** Gomez, take those out of his mouth.
    
-   _Army of Darkness_ includes a parody of the scene from _The Manster_.
-   _Beetlejuice_: The ghostly Maitlands deform their faces to look scarier; Adam ends up with eyes on his fingertips, Barbara with eyes in her mouth.
-   _Big Trouble in Little China_: Lo Pan's spherical spy monster has eyes on stalks, on its back, and even one in its mouth.
-   _Clash of the Titans (1981)_: The Stygian Witches have to _share_ a single (magical) eye between the three of them.
-   _Dai Nipponjin_: One of the giant monsters (released in America as _Big Man Japan_) has no head and carries a giant eye on its hands (though in this case, it represents a giant penis).
-   _Doom_: One of the more watchable bits of the movie is a scene where a soldier sees somebody's eyes opening in the darkness, and calls out assuming it's the scientist he's looking for. Then all of the figure's _other_ eyes open, all over its head...
-   _The Gate_: An eye grows out of protagonist's hand. He stabs it.
-   _Gothic 1986_: The poet Percy Shelley had recurring nightmares about a woman with eyes where her nipples should be. It was inspired by the real-life account of his experiencing that horrific vision after a reading of Coleridge's "Cristabel."
-   _The Great Wall_: The Tao Tie, which resemble large, reptilian hyenas, have eyes located on their shoulders (a slight departure from their mythological inspiration which had them on its _armpits_) and notably were the creatures's sole weak spot, killing them instantly once their eyes were pierced by spears and arrows. The queen of the Tao Tie is an aversion, however, being distinguished from her lesser troops by having her eyes on her face.
-   _Hellboy II: The Golden Army_: The Angel of Death had eyes all over its wings... but none on its face. Creepifying. From the same director as the above _Pan's Labyrinth_, and, in fact, the same actor. This is clearly based on Azrael, the Angel of Death from Islamic legend. He has an eye on his wings for _every living thing_, which close as they die. _Way_ cooler than that pansy knitting stuff.
-   _Hot Shots!_: Topper Harley has his father's eyes. Literally. He keeps them in a little velvet case.
-   _Kamen Rider ZO_: There's a bat monster whose eyes are on its palm, much like the Pale Man seen above.
-   _Pacific Rim_: The Kaiju Mutavore has eyes on her lower jaw.
-   _Labyrinth_: There's a mossy plant covered with eyes that watches Jennifer Connelly. Don't blame it a bit.
    -   Not like there was anything else to watch.
    -   Although the Fireys' eyes are usually in the normal place, they function just fine on the ends of their owners' fingers, in their mouths, or just rolling on the ground.
-   _The Manster_: An eyeball growing on a character's shoulder is the first sign that something weird is happening to his body.
-   _Pan's Labyrinth_: The Pale Man has eyes on his palms.
-   The mud-scorpion creatures from _Riddick_ have a pair of large all-black eyes on their _tails_, the better to aim their tail-pincer attacks.

-   _Wham Bam Thank You Spaceman_: The two aliens have their eyes between their legs...
-   _When Evil Calls_: Mark's wish for Linda to be able to see again results in her sprouting multiple eyes across her torso.

    Literature

-   Grendel's mother of _Beowulf_ has eyes in her breasts.
-   In the novel _The Dark Half_ by Stephen King, surgery reveals an eyeball inside the protagonist's brain. It's a remnant of his identical twin, who was absorbed in utero.
-   _Deeplight_: Post transformation, Jelt has a cluster of extra eyes on his back. The narration is vague about their exact location, but they certainly aren't on whatever passes for his face at this point.
-   Probably in reference to Argos (mythology, not catalogue), the _Discworld_ god Blind Io is usually drawn with an Eyeless Face but surrounded by a cloud of floating Faceless Eyes.
-   The _Doctor Who_ novel _The Eyeless_ has an alien race which frequently takes "trophies" from the worlds it visits. It's not actually meant to be _quite_ as grotesque as that word makes it sound, though it's pretty close; they're more ruthlessly logical than brutal. It's a cultural thing amongst them that when they encounter something new, the one who makes the discovery gets to keep a piece of that something... like a young girl's eyes, for example.
-   Wilbur Whateley in H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos novella _The Dunwich Horror_ has two extra eyes on the sides of his pelvis, with a creepy organ for sucking blood in between them. Lovecraft called it a 'tail', but we all know what he meant...
-   In Dan Abnett's _Eisenhorn_ novel _Malleus_, they must infiltrate muties. One mutant woman, a many-armed prostitute, winks at them — with an eye on her tongue.
-   _Emily Eyefinger_ is a series of children's books about a girl who is born with an eye on the end of her finger.
-   In a curious example, the old Chinese romance _Fengshen Yanyi_ has the court officer Yang Ren, who angers King Zhou while trying to persuade him to renounce building the enormous but expensive Deer's Terrace and is subjected to Eye Scream punishment. Rescued by the immortal Qinqxu Daode Tianzhun, he's given a medicine which sprouts _hands_ from his empty eye sockets, with fully functional eyes located in the palms.
-   One of the many weird adaptations of Henders Island creatures in _Fragment_ is an extra set of eyes near the middle of the back.
-   In the Stephen King short story "I Am the Doorway" (found in the collection _Night Shift_), a former astronaut develops eyes in his fingertips. Then things get much worse from there....
-   _Journey to the West_, the aptly named Hundred Eyes Demon Lord (Bayan Mojun) is a centipede monster whose sides are covered in eyes. When he realizes that his sword skills are no match for Sun Wukong, he opens the eyes and unleashes fiery beams from them, hot enough to force Sun Wukong to flee by turning in a pangolin and digging under his feet, where the beams couldn't reach him.
-   In the short story "The Muse" by Anthony Burgess, an astronaut literary scholar imagines he sees extra eyes in weird places on the inhabitants of another planet. The people actually look entirely human.
-   In _The Nekropolis Archives_, one of the monstrous inmates in Nekropolis's prison of Tenebrus is entirely covered in eyes. Matt points out that, while it certainly looks creepy, it is also a significant vulnerability.
    
    **Matt**: Anything that has eyes all over its body should know better than to attack someone. It's like wearing armor made out of your own testicles.
    
-   Likewise, Fanny Four-Eyes, a minor character in _Nights at the Circus_ working in a Freak Show\-cum-brothel, has eyes where her nipples should be.
-   _Percy Jackson and the Olympians_ has the minor character Argus, the camp security director, who is a monster with a hundred eyes all over his body. There is an Urban Legend among the campers that he never speaks because he has an eye on his tongue.
-   _The Scholomance_: The maw-mouth Blob Monster is covered with the stolen eyes and mouths of everyone it's absorbed. Worse, the victims might still be self-aware.
-   In R.A. Salvatore's novel _Siege of Darkness_ a misfiring teleportation spell results in only the casting wizard's eyes arriving at their destination. This is played mostly for slightly squicky humor — the wizard can still _see_ with them and make himself heard at their location, they're just not in the same place as the rest of his body. The same thing is mentioned in one of the _Harry Potter_ books, where it's referred to as being "splinched". It's apparently painful and inconvenient, but not permanently harmful. When treated and fixed properly. Ron's splinching in _Deathly Hallows_ was definitely not funny.
-   In Paul and Hollace Davids's series of _Star Wars_ novels, Emperor Palpatine's long-sought-after heir is reputed to have a third eye. A pretender to the throne appears, who has an extra eye on his forehead and feigns Force sensitivity. Later the true heir emerges, and his third eye is on the back of his head.
-   Tim Powers' _The Stress of Her Regard_ plays with this also, making Shelley's alleged "nightmares" into Polidori's interpretation of something Percy'd yelled in a foreign language, that only sounded like "eyes in her breasts" when mistaken for English.
-   The short story "Tonsil Eye 'Tis" by Paul Jennings involves a boy growing an eye on one finger as a result of a garden gnome-related accident.
-   _Vigor Mortis_: Played for Laughs. As Vita grows in power, she begins to subconsciously modify her body, making it stronger. She also gains extra eyes, seemingly at random.
    
    **Vita:** Four eyes and counting, actually. There's one on my thigh, and I think I feel another growing just above my hip.  
    **Netta:** A thigh-eye doesn't sound very useful.  
    **Vita:** It's really not.  
    **Netta:** So are you like, always...?  
    **Vita:** It has an eyelid, thankfully.  
    **Netta:** Oh. Good.
    
-   One especially unfortunate "Joker" in the _Wild Cards_ novels had eyes all over his body, leading to constant pain because he couldn't even wear clothes or lie down to sleep without irritating them.
-   In Madeline L'Engle's _A Wind in the Door_, the "singular cherubim" Proginoskes is depicted as composed of _nothing but_ eyes and wings, and the occasional jet of fire. (In this, he resembles The Bible's descriptions of angels, which are a long way from modern depictions of "cherubs".) Charles Wallace is apparently the only character who doesn't have a minor brain-BSOD upon first seeing him.
-   In one of Diane Duane's _Young Wizards_ novels, the hero briefly encounters an alien who looks like a berry bush, except the berries are all eyes. A member of the same species later becomes a supporting character. Quite a nice guy, really, with a fondness for baseball caps.

-   The _Stargate SG-1_ episode "Metamorphosis", while on a planet of mutants created by Nirti through genetic manipulation, the team discover a man who had a third eye above his left ear.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_: The episode "Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?" has an otherwise Human Alien who covers his third eye to pass as an Earthling for sinister purposes. (It's on his forehead; in the original short story, it's on the back of his head and normally covered by hair.)
-   _Ultra Series_:
    -   While it's not explicitly stated within the show itself and only available in supplementary material, one of the most iconic monsters from the original _Ultraman_, the final kaiju Zetton, have its eyes being located in the two glowing spots in its chest.
    -   Brocken from _Ultraman Ace_ has eyes on its hands, and two additional eyes on its tails. When it possesses a human, the eyes on its hands gets transferred to its human host as well, hence a human astronaut who is being used as a host by Brocken starts wearing gloves for no given reason throughout the episode.
    -   Gan Q from _Ultraman Gaia_ (and many subsequent series due to being one of the most popular _Ultra Series_ monsters) is a giant eyeball with limbs that are also covered in eyes.
    -   Izmael from _Ultraman Nexus_ has eyes in its shoulders and chest, due to it being a Hybrid Monster fused together from practically all the Space Beasts Nexus defeated throughout the series.
    -   Similar to Izmael, Five King from _Ultraman Ginga_ is another fusion beast created with the bodies of five different kaijus, including the aforementioned Gan-Q. Its left arm is a gigantic Gan-Q eyeball, and it has eyes on its forehead as well as its stomach (respectively taken from Melba and Super COV).
    -   Gargorgon from _Ultraman X_ doesn't have any eyes on her face... but her sole eye is located _inside her mouth_. Said eye can unleash a petrifying beam that turn her victims into stone.

    Music Videos 

-   Madonna's video for "Bedtime Story" ends with a shot of her singing, but her face has two mouths where her eyes should be, and one eye in the place of her mouth. When she closes her eye, the positioning of it makes it look like a bizarre mouth.
-   In the music video for tool's "Vicarious" there are eyes all over the place, most notably on the backs of the transparent-skinned humanoid creatures' hands. And this is still one of the _less_ disturbing things in this video.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Classical Mythology:
    -   Argos, or Argus Panoptes, of Greek myth, had eyes all over his body, and he kept a constant watch by sleeping only some of them at a time. He was pretty badass, too. Argos was the one who slew Echidna, the mother of all monsters. Argos is also apparently the mythological origin of the peacock. After he was slain by Hermes (he pulled it off by putting all of his eyes to sleep at once before beheading him), Argos's master Hera took his eyes and put them on the feathers of a bird. Thus the peacock was born.
    -   The Grey Sisters of Greek myth were three old hags that shared between them a single eye and a single tooth, making this an example of Faceless Eye and Eyeless Face. Perseus got information about Gorgons from them by stealing the eye and holding it hostage. After getting what he needed, he threw the eye into the cave so that the sisters would be too preoccupied "looking" for it to chase him down.
-   Lots of youkai in Japanese Mythology:
    -   There's a Japanese Obake / youkai called a Shirime which has an Eyeless Face and a single giant eye...in its anus. Which it delights in showing off to passers-by by stretching its cheeks wide. Yes. The Japanese, in fact, have a Goatse monster. Oh, Japan.
    -   Another one, Tenome, wears its two eyes on the palms of its hands. It inspired the Pale Man from _Pan's Labyrinth_ picture above.
    -   The Hyakume is a corpulent humanoid creature completely covered in eyes that can detach from its body to search for people to scare.
    -   The Mokumokuren, which is a traditional paper sliding door _covered in eyes_!
    -   The Doudoumeki has arms covered in hundred(s) of bird eyes as a result of stealing (this derives from a pun).
-   Plenty of Hindu deities have eyes in the wrong places; most notably, a third eye in the forehead represents mystical sight and wisdom.
-   The Bible describes some angels as having eyes on all sides of their bodies, making this Older Than Feudalism. Among these angels are angelic beings referred to as Ophans or Ophanim. They make an appearance in the Book of Ezekiel and are described as looking like beryl colored wheels within wheels with rims full of eyes. It seems angels, in true Abrahamic tradition, are terrifying beings of grotesque body horror. Jewish tradition describes Azrael, the angel of death, with a body consisting of _nothing but eyes_ and Christian tradition also includes tongues whose number corresponds to the number of people inhabiting the Earth. Metatron, the Face of God and Heavenly Scribe in Jewish mysticism, is said to have a million eyes (and mouths) all over his body. Several Angels and other celestial beings have strange number or placement of eyes, such as _hundreds covering their wings_. Turns out there was more than one reason to start every conversation with "Do not be afraid"!
-   One monster mentioned in Chinese mythology was the _taotie_, a beast embodying gluttony that devoured all it could, and even its own body when it could eat nothing else. The myths describe it as having eyes in its _armpits_, though versions varied on whether it also had eyes on its head as well.

    Podcasts 

-   Given a spin in episode 127 of _The Magnus Archives_; a man dies, suddenly, painfully, and with no outward signs of what killed him. When the doctor giving the statement performed an autopsy, he found that almost the entirety of the man's insides - his organs, his bones, even the inside of his skin - were covered in hundreds of eyes. Eyes that still moved, and focused on the doctor as he cut the corpse open.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   When Victoria was using t.A.T.u.'s "All The Things She Said" as her entrance music in WWE, her TitanTron entrance video included a scene of an eye in the palm of a hand.

    Puppet Shows 

-   In _The Dark Crystal_, Aughra is capable of removing her one eye and holding it out to see over ledges or around corners.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Call of Cthulhu_:
    -   In the main rules, shoogoths are noted as being covered with eyes.
    -   Supplement _The Asylum and Other Tales_, adventure "The Asylum". The proto-shoggoth can create organs anywhere on its body whenever it likes. One example given was creating an eye in the palm of its hand.
-   _Chaotic_: Klasp is a round ball-like creature with limbs but seemingly no eyes. Turns out they're inside its mouth.
    
    **Flavor Text**: If you find yourself seeing eye-to-eye with Klasp, it means you previously had not.
    
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   Argos is a race of monsters with eyes all over their bodies.
    -   The otyugh has eyes on three tentacles that surround its gaping, toothy mouth.
    -   Beholders have _ten_ eyes on stalks sprouting from their bodies, plus a big one in front. Other Beholderkin have even weirder arrangements. One known as the Overseer is essentially a slimy tree covered in eyes.
    -   In the Cthulhu Mythos section of the original 1st Edition _Deities and Demigods Cyclopedia_, the shoggoth is shown as having multiple eyes all over its amoeba-like body.
    -   Gibbering Mouthers are human-sized amoeba-like monsters covered with eyes and mouths.
    -   The 3rd Edition _Monster Manual 3_ has the odopi, which is a large ball-shaped creature with hundred of arms. Each palm has an eye.
    -   The daelkyr known as Belashyrra, Lord of Eyes, has a particular taste in this; beholders are said to be his creations. One of the more common forms of Belashyrra cult consists of people who have sprouted an eye on one palm that sees certain people as "hidden demons"; typically, these cults believe the eye to be a gift from a god (usually Aureon) and carry out vigilante murders on the "demons" in question. Whether these eyes can genuinely see some kind of hidden evil - quori mind seeds or possessed minions, for example - or if the cultists' visions are just delusions may not be clear, and even if it _is_ clear for one cult, it may not be for another, since the daelkyr are too weird to really predict.
-   From _Magic: The Gathering_, Kozilek, Butcher of Truth<small>◊</small> has eyes peppered on its arms.
-   _Mutant Future_. The Eyedog has eyes all over its body. Some can see heat, some can see in ultraviolet, and others can give off light, radiation or energy blasts.
-   _Pachimon_ has a kaiju called Betalas who has a mass of tentacles in place of its head, and its eyes growing on the tips of two of those tentacles.
-   One memorable piece of artwork for the _Warhammer 40,000_ Chaos god Slaanesh has an eye instead of a nipple on its exposed breast. The Forgeworld model for the Keeper of Secrets (a greater daemon of Slaanesh) has multiple breasts, several with eyes in place of nipples.

    Toys 

-   In _BIONICLE_, Tren Krom has the ability to sprout an extra eye on his back. And it shoots laser beams.

    Video Games 

-   _99 Spirits_ is awash with non-biological examples... the titular evil spirits possessing everyday household objects mostly appear as said object with one or more eyes (and maybe a tongue) added for sheer creepiness. True to the original mythology, of course...
-   In _Abadox_, which takes place within a huge, organic Planet Eater, almost every _interior_ surface has countless eyes. Especially the digestive tract.
-   _Ancient Domains of Mystery_ has a Dorn Beast. Its exact looks are unknown, but it is grey and purple and black and grey and white and has sixty-three eyes. Well... its exact looks, seeing as ADOM is a roguelike, is a purple F. It can be safely assumed that some of the sixty-three eyes are not on the head, anyway.
    -   The Dornbeast is a reference to the _Zork_ games, and previously appeared in _Sorcerer_ and _Beyond Zork_. In the latter, it's too powerful to fight until you immobilize it by cutting a giant onion.
    -   There's also the "You Have Grown a Total of 12 Eyes" mutation.
-   When Fadroh from _Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean_ goes into One-Winged Angel mode, he has an eye in his crotch. Which shoots ludicrously-powerful laser beams.
-   In _Battleborn_, Orendi has an eye in the palm of each of her four hands a la the Pale Man from _Pan's Labyrinth_.
-   The angels in _Bayonetta_ are revealed to be all about this once you crack through their marble skin.
-   _The Binding of Isaac_ has the Analog Stick item, which adds a _ring of eyes_ around Isaac's forehead.
    -   There's also the Eye and Bloodshot Eye enemies that appear in The Womb, which is... well, a _womb_.
    -   Delirium tends to keep its yellow eyes when transforming into another boss. When it transforms into The Husk of Conquest, neither of which have any visible eyes, it opts to place a singular eyeball in the _mouth_ of said forms.
-   _BlazBlue_:
    -   Ragna, the "main" character, has a gauntlet/ magical prosthetic arm with a red eye-like design on the back of the hand. The eye even opens widely when he uses his Blood Kain ability. Note that Robot Girl Nu-13 has a virtually identical eye-design that she wears as an eyepatch, one of many hints that the two characters are connected. The True Ending reveals that these "eyes" are <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Azure Grimoires.
    -   Tsubaki Yayoi is another example of this. When she equips the Izayoi in Continuum Shift she has an eyeball on her hat, and eyeball on her book, and an eyeball on the handle of her sword. Ironically, she goes blind in the second game, but gets better after her Face–Heel Turn in _Chronophantasma_ and Heel–Face Turn in _Central Fiction_.
    -   Hakumen has red eyes on his shoulders, wrists, and shin. Mu-12 has the same ones on her armor's shoulders.
    -   Arakune, the game's resident Eldritch Abomination can grow them just about...anywhere. His Astral Heat turns him into a giant eye which in the first two games merely was an instant KO if it touched you, but two games later, if the move landed, eyes appeared on the screen...and giant centipedes crawled out of them. Oh, and the centipedes have eyes on their backs.
-   _Bloodborne_: This could be the game's friggin' tagline. Eyes show up in all sorts of places they really shouldn't; studded all over heads, on enemies' bodies, on brains, in place of one boss's teeth, as eyeball spiders, on scenery, on lanterns, and so on. Gaining Insight is also often referred to as _lining one's brain with eyes._ And then you realize that most of these monsters are the results of Byrgenwerth/Healing Church experiments on gaining Insight, and suddenly lining your brain with eyes sounds _uncomfortably literal_...
-   Mittux from _Bound by Blades_ appears to be a gigantic, eyeless monster consisting of a giant mouth with bat-like wings. But then it uses it's tongue to lash out at you, and it's eye is located on the tongue's tip.
-   _CarnEvil_ has Eyeclops, a two-headed cyclops with one eye on each head, three on his chest, and several others on his limbs.
-   One of the early boss monsters from _Catherine_ is the Immoral Beast, a warped human torso with its limbs on backward, a Vagina Dentata mouth, and a pair of eyes on its ass.
-   _Cuphead_: The Blind Specter of the Phantom Express has eyes in his hands and even fires out eyeballs from them.
-   _Cosmo Police Galivan_: The arena where you fight the boss, Hezmo, has eyes growing out of the wall in the background.
-   _Darkest Dungeon_ totes so many eyes . Many of the _things_ more heavily affected by the eldritch powers sprouting from the Darkest Dungeon have eyes peppered _everywhere_, most notable being the Flesh, an amalgamation of constantly-mutating pork from failed summoning experiments. As it turns out, blinking black beady eyes in the entirely wrong places is a hallmark of the Heart of Darkness, the Eldritch Abomination the Ancestor came into contact with.
-   Q-Bee (along with the entire Soul Bee race) from _Darkstalkers_ has four eyes. The two eyes on her face, where eyes would normally be found on humanoids, are _not_ her real eyes: those would be the large compound eyes on the top of her head. This is reflected in her animations, with her head tilted downward so her real eyes can look directly at her opponent.
-   A trip into hell in _Devil May Cry_ normally includes eyes on the walls. They tie in with series Satan analog Mundus, who is most prominently represented by the third eye on his forehead.
-   With Disgaea, we have the galactic demons from _Disgaea: Hour of Darkness_ and Desco from _Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten_.
-   In _Disney's Hades Challenge_, Typhon has dozens of heads with eyes inside their mouths.
-   The Architect from _Dragon Age: Origins – Awakening_ is an unusual example. His eyes are in his face... but they're asymmetrically arranged very close together above his nose, with one tilted, in a way that's possibly more wrong than having them elsewhere on his body.
-   _Dragon Quest_:
    -   _Dragon Quest III_: Zoma<small>◊</small> has a big, bulging eye on his helmet. And it's not decorative. It's _functional_. The "hows" of which are probably better left unasked.
    -   _Dragon Quest VII_: Orgodemir's brain on his final form turns out to hide an extra eye, which is shown when he uses Magic Burst.
-   _Dread Templar_ has the Stitches Spider, a former human (or humanoid) ripped apart and reassembled to form a spider-like shape. With a gigantic eye on the shoulder.
-   _Dwarf Fortress_ has staring eyeball, a kind of grass found only in evil biomes that is _made out of eyeball._ Cows can still eat it, though.
-   _Elden Ring_: The Fire Giant boss has a one-eyed face on its torso. The eye opens when he Turns Red.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   The Hecteyes (and similar) enemies in the series are nothing but giant pulsating masses of flesh, entirely covered in eyes. _Final Fantasy VII_ has Jenova, who in the words of the Internet:
        
        "She has eyes for nipples! _Eyes for nipples!!!_"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
        
    -   In _Final Fantasy XII_, the bestiary entry for the Hecteyes monsters explains that only one pair of its eyes actually function, and the others are there to throw off any foes that go for the eyes when attacking.
    -   Estinien, in _Final Fantasy XIV_, spends a while with giant eyes embedded in his forearms. As demonstrated when the player tries to remove them, the eyes are quite firmly attached. This is also a recurring issue with the Terminus Beasts in _Shadowbringers_ and _Endwalker_. One of the Amaurot dungeon bosses appears to be a ten-foot-tall caterpillar covered in eyes, and the mobs in Vanaspati include something that appears to have eyes on the back of an elephant's head.
-   _Flash of the Blade_ have eyes growing out of walls as result of the Soulstealer's powers. As well as an area where you're attacked by dozens and dozens of deformed hands, each of them covered in eyes.
-   Ennard from _Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location_ has several sets of eyes all over its body, owing to it being a combination of the endoskeletons of all four Afton Robotics animatronics. Even when it ejects Baby from itself and becomes Molten Freddy in _Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator_, it still retains the numerous eyes.
-   Malassa, the goddess of darkness in _Heroes of Might and Magic_ games that are set in the world of Ashan, takes the form of an enormous black dragon with eyes on her wings.
-   _I See You_: In a later part of the game there are eyes on the walls.
-   The final boss of _Kirby's Return to Dream Land_ doesn't reveal his mouth until he Turns Red, where you see that it's less a mouth and more a _giant eyeball_. In _Deluxe_'s True Arena, not only does Magolor Soul's main eyes disappear, but the eye in his mouth is _permanently visible._
    -   Anything possessed by Dark Matter usually ends up with this trope applying in some manner. Most famously, King Dedede sprouts an eye on his stomach (which occasionally transforms into a mouth because... reasons?) and in Kirby 64, a Dark Matter-possessed Waddle Dee grows an eye that covers his entire face, making he look like a Waddle Doo minus the beam ability.
    -   A similar thing happens in _Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards_ when 02 reveals his true form. Yikes.
    -   Dark Mind in _Kirby & the Amazing Mirror_ has a massive gaseous eyeball that serves as both his weak spot and true form. Not only that, but this returns in _Team Kirby Clash Deluxe_ and _Super Kirby Clash_ as King D-Mind.
    -   There are also the Grab Hands (which belong to none other than Dark Crafter) in _Kirby and the Rainbow Curse_. Dark Crafter himself also has a pair of sunglasses over his single eye. It could be that these shades are actually his real eyes.
    -   _Kirby Star Allies_ features the final boss, Void Termina, who has eyes that appear in various places that serve as the only place it can be damaged, including on its stomach, shoulders, back, and forehead.
-   In _The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV_, the true form of Ishmelga, a monster responsible for spreading a curse throughout Erebonia, is a large blob with three eyes placed at seemingly random positions.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords_, _The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures_, and _The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap_: Vaati. _The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass_' Bellum, too. The Go for the Eye trope is so prevalent in that series that the games tend to indicate arrow/slingshot targets with eyes. That means most enemies who are specifically weak to arrows have unnaturally large eyes somewhere on their bodies, and walls with projectile-based switches stare at you.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D_ adds eyeball weak points to each of the four main bosses, which don't have them in the N64 version. Naturally, the eyes match those on Majora's Mask itself.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_: The Giant Spider Armoghoma has a giant eye in the middle of her back. She uses is to fire Eye Beams during her boss battle, but it's also her main weak spot.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_: The Final Boss, Dark Beast Ganon, has a cluster of eyes on its back.
-   _The Legendary Axe_ have the last boss of the first game, Jagu, whose One-Winged Angel form has eyes all over his body. Including bulging eyeballs on his kneecaps and shoulders.
-   _LSD: Dream Emulator_ sometimes gives areas textures that put eyes in the scenery, on the floor or in windows, for example.
-   Ultron\-Sigma, the Big Bad of _Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite_, has glowing blue eyes on his chest.
-   _Metroid_:
    -   _Super Metroid_: Phantoon is a bulbous tentacled ghost creature with a large eyeball inside its mouth.
    -   _Metroid Prime Trilogy_: Dark Samus/Metroid Prime has an eye on the back of her hand, for apparently no reason except to look scary as hell when she first appears. This actually makes some sense, because the manual for Metroid 2 says the Power Crystal that Samus has in the same place is a sensor. However, it's unknown if the makers of the _Prime_ series knew that at the time. The eye is absent in from Dark Samus' hand in _Echoes_. Absent until the climax where Dark Samus has been exposed to so much phazon that its insides are visible. At this point the eye on its hand can also be seen.
-   Zoe (formerly known as "Z'gord") from _Monster Prom_ has a humanoid form that _appears_ to have perfectly normal eyes on her face, but they're really only for appearances. She actually sees from the green ones in her "hair," on her chest, and on her left leg.
-   _The Neverhood_: Ottoborg is depicted as having eyes on his palms on Wall of Records. The fact that he is king created to be happy and joyful all the day may or may not induce further creepiness.
-   Wizeman from _NiGHTS into Dreams…_ has eyes in his six floating hands and nowhere else.
-   _Ōkami_:
    -   One of the enemies in the game consists of a wheel with a huge eye in the center. Even better though, the locks in the game consist of a single giant eye and mouth. You unlock them by _driving the key right into the eye_.
    -   One of the bosses, the Spider Queen (or "Prostitute Spider" in the original translation). It's scary enough her head is just an eyeless giant mouth complete with oversized mandibles, but her abdomen can open up like a flower bud which has 8 EYEBALLS for petals.
-   Normally, the _Patapon_ series wouldn't entirely count, since the eyes are essentially their bodies. But Arch Pandara, the final boss slash ultimate Eldritch Abomination of Patapon 3, has five eyes and none of them are on its face: there are two in its palms, two on the backs of its elbows, and one in the very middle of its waist. It looks even more _off_ when compared to the heroes.
-   Jirachi from _Pokémon_ has an eye _on its abdomen._ Thankfully Jirachi is adorable and its eye is closed most of the time, so it manages to not be creepy.
    -   Wobbuffet and Wynaut's eyes are on their _tails_. The Wobbuffet species in particular are _extremely_ protective of them, and the pokedex implies that they hold 'a secret'. A popular theory is that the squinty eyes on their face aren't eyes at all.
    -   Claydol has eyes all around its head, with a beak between each one of them.
    -   Barbaracle has eyes on its hands. Then again, each "hand" is an entity in itself.
    -   Meowstic have psychic organs on the inside of their ears, that look exactly like their eyes.
    -   Lusamine gains _16_ extra ones in her mutated form in _Sun_ and _Moon_; one in each "arm" tentacle and three in each "rear" tentacle.
    -   Mr. Rime has an extra pair of eyes on his torso, along with an entire extra face there minus a mouth.
-   When William Birkin injects himself with the G-Virus in _Resident Evil 2_, his first mutation is a gigantic eyeball growing out of his shoulder.
    -   Eyeball tumors appears to be a side-effect of the G-Virus. Curtis from _Resident Evil: Degeneration_ sprouts a similar eye after he's injected with it, as does Lisa Trevor from REmake.
    -   _Resident Evil 4_: Osmund Saddler, when he goes One-Winged Angel. Those eyes were technically on his face; his face just happened to sprout legs and combat tentacles. In his human form, he has an eye _in his mouth_; his lips are eyelids.
    -   The J'avo of _Resident Evil 6_ have _at least_ five eyes on their heads, two in the usual place for a human while the rest is scattered around their faces. The ones in Edonia typically wrap their faces and use hoodies, while the Lanshiang ones often wear ceramic masks, but both kinds of disguise come off when their heads are attacked. Considering the G-Virus is used to create C-Virus, this is likely a side effect.
    -   _Resident Evil 7_ continues the series' tradition with Jack Baker, whose mutated form is a massive slug-like abomination with orange glowing eyes all over its body. Naturally, you'll want to aim for these.
-   _Scribblenauts_: The Shoggoth has many eyes placed on the side of its body.
-   _Shin Megami Tensei_'s White Rider's horse is covered in staring blue _human_ eyes.
-   Peacock, from _Skullgirls_, has six elongated eyes located prominently on her cybernetic arms. That's not counting the indefinite amount of free-floating eyes she can summon. And those Black Bead Eyes on her face? They're where her normal eyes used to be before they were gouged out.
-   The Sand Scorpion from _Sonic and the Secret Rings_ has a total of 6 eyes: two on each of its tails, one on its back, and one _in its mouth_.
    -   Perfect Dark Gaia from _Sonic Unleashed_ has seven huge eyes inside its mouth.
-   _Soul Series_:
    -   In _SoulCalibur II_, in his shirtless costume, Nightmare's freaky claw-arm extends to his chest, complete with a red eye where his nipple would be.
    -   The cursed sword Soul Edge has a single glaring eye somewhere, no matter what shape it takes, bar a few where it's impossible to place an eye where it wouldn't be held or use directly in common attacks, such as Maxi's nunchucks and Tira's ring of death. But generally it will sprout an eye when possible.
-   _Stray_: A particularly unsettling case of this trope lies in the heart of the Sewers, where the Zurk nest lurks. Not only are there way too many eyes on the walls, said eyes are also huge and blood-red. And when they notice anything delicious they'll summon loads of Zurks to feast on it—cats and robots included.
-   _Super Cyborg_ have various Xirxul-spawned monsters having eyes in the most random of places. You'll see eyes growing on flesh-covered walls, for starters.
    -   The first boss, Imeotra beast have a hidden single eye in its mouth / chin area.
    -   Giddagn Symbiont is an alien monster whose body is a mess of organs, with five visible gigantic eyes on its surface and none on the head.
-   A rather famous bug in _Super Smash Bros. Melee_ shows that Daisy's trophy has a third eye on the back of her head, hidden behind her hair.
-   Eyerok from _Super Mario 64_ is a pair of giant telepathic stone hands with eyes set in the palms.
-   _Touhou Project_:
    -   One of the creepier traits of Yukari Yakumo series is her penchant for having eyes appear in the gaps that she creates.
    -   Utsuho Reiuji has a huge red eye on her chest. It doesn't look entirely unlike Sauron.
    -   Satori and Koishi Komeiji also have additional eyes. On their _hearts_. Which, in turn, are located _outside of their bodies_, being connected to their owners with what's presumably arteries and veins. All of this isn't really as creepy-looking as it sounds<small>◊</small>. It is, however, exactly as _symbolic_ as it sounds, resulting in some truly odd consequences when Koishi closed her third eye.
-   _Undertale_:
    -   A common theme with the monsters is featuring what appear to be eyes some odd place, implying that the ones on its face aren't really eyes. Froggit has a pair underneath him, Knight Knight has very large ones on her torso, and Gyftrot's real eyes might be at the base of its antlers (notably, they appear to blink while the ones on its face do not).
    -   Subverted with Astigmatism: what appears to be a single, large eye taking up most of their body is actually their mouth; their real eyes are actually where you'd expect them to be (by human facial anatomical standards, anyway).
-   Alhazad's final form in _Wild ARMs_ has a single eye _in his mouth._
-   In _The Witch And The Hundred Knight 2_, people who have a vertical slit on their forehead is a sign that they have the Witch Disease, a disease that transforms the infected into an immoral and nigh unstoppable witch the moment that slit opens up to reveal a large third eye.
-   _World of Warcraft_:
    -   The Icecrown Citadel bosses Rotface<small>◊</small> and his brother Festergut. There's another eye on the back of its head, though it's usually staring at the ceiling.
    -   One of the Old God bosses, Yogg-Saron, inverts this trope by having toothy mouths where eyes would be. And those toothy mouths are all over his head and body.
    -   Cataclysm features Cho'gal, an ogre leader of the Twilight Cult, with eyes on his chest and arms.
-   _Yume Nikki_:
    -   One of the powers Madotsuki can obtain turns her head into a hand with an eye on it.
    -   More than that, eyes where they do not belong or no eyes where they do belong are a strong theme in Yume Nikki. In some areas it seems like everything has eyes _but_ the place that should have them.

    Web Animation 

-   Cyriak's online animated video "Something" features 1950s people with excess eyes and mouths.
-   _Mystery Skulls Animated_: Arthur's amputated arm somehow developed an eye in the middle of its hand.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Alice and the Nightmare_, the Jabberwocky have eyes all over their shapeless bodies.
-   Roger Pepitone from _College Roomies from Hell!!!_ mutated an eye in his hand, which is much less frequently referred to compared to the more useful mutations of his roomies.
-   The giant snake-demon from _Blue Moon Blossom_ combines this with Cyclops and Extra Eyes as it has one single large primary eye roughly where one would expect to find eyes, and a bunch of smaller eyes all across its head and up and down its body.
-   _Brawl in the Family_ looks deeper in what daily life would mean for the aforementioned Phantoon, who has an eye in its mouth, in "Phantoon has it Rough". Indeed it does.
-   _Dan and Mab's Furry Adventures_ has Cindy, who was born with an eye on the palm of her hand as a result of excessive exposure to magic. Other than that she's perfectly normal. She eventually commits suicide, several years after Abel left the town due to prejudice about his wings. It's implied that Cindy may have killed herself due to discrimination, and being unable to make friends after Abel's family left.
-   _Drowtales_ had one or more extra eyes being standard for the heavily tainted once their seed starts taking them over, as demonstrated by Kes'sen, or a scar where a third eye should be for one character — but Naal'suul gains an eye on _someone else's tongue_ as part of a massive random fusion of demon-tainted bodies. And it's implied there's more where that came from hidden in the shadows.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, the Abberation known as Gullet has eyes in his torso.
-   _Girl Genius_:
-   In _Goblins_ spin-off comic _Tempts Fate_, the title character has a demonic eyeball on the sole of one of his feet, as a result of being cursed by a demon lord.
-   In _Godslave_, Turner has an extra eye on his neck, albeit this seems to be a method to stay in contact with Heru rather than for seeing.
-   Coyote from _Gunnerkrigg Court_ has an eye on his chest and one on each of his shoulders and thighs. They appear to be stylized eye designs, but in the last panel here, they are clearly turning to look at Antimony. He also has a slightly less conspicuous pair behind each of his _ears_.
    -   He's also fond of juggling his eyeballs.
-   _Homestuck_ gives us the Ugly Cute Vodka Mutini, a mutant kitten with four eyes.
-   Angels in _Kill Six Billion Demons_ have various weird body shapes, but some of the most common features are wings, lots of eyes in strange places, and eyes on wings.
-   In _Ruby Quest_, Ruby enters a dark room to speak with Subject Six. At first, he doesn't seem to have any eyes at all, but as Ruby speaks to him, more and more luminous eyeballs begin opening in the darkness around her. Then Tom turns on the lights... suffice to say, all the eyeballs are attached to Subject Six in one way or another. This isn't even considering Ruby's supernatural third eye, either.
-   _The Sanity Circus_:
    -   Sammy Talbot's eyes _extend out of his skull_.
    -   Spycrows don't have eyes in their faces, but do have giant staring one in their chests instead.
-   Sgt. Schlock from _Schlock Mercenary_ usually keeps his eyes above his mouth, but since he's an amorphous blob and they aren't actually part of his body, he can put them anywhere, such as on tentacles to look around corners. At one point, he had _four_ eyes, and kept two in his mouth, to "watch what he ate!"
    
    "Puns are not supposed to be that gross. Please don't do that again."
    
-   _Trevor (2020)_: When the medical team splits up to get away from Trevor, he appears to watch them with a multitude of eyes through the ventilation system, and it's not clear where on his body they have formed.

-   In _Wurr_, Iralbe the hell hound has two eyes set into his tongue, which open when he pants and close when he retracts his tongue. His empty eye sockets are covered in heat-sensing pits instead.
-   In _Yokoka's Quest_, Copycat has a (sort of) Game Face, where he occasionally reveals additional glowing, stylized eyes, which float around him. It isn't clear whether these eyes are tangible or functional.

    Web Original 

-   Mollymauk and by extension, Lucien, in _Critical Role_ has nine red eyes marked across his body. While he initially thought they were tattoos, they glow and bleed when he uses his powers, and apparently would not take ink when he tried to cover them up. Given their origin, and the fact that they seem able turn and watch things on their own, it's safe to say that they're more than just simple tattoos.
-   Markiplier once did a Let's Play with his friend and frequent collaborator LordMinion777 for the game _Spore_. Naturally, the game gives you opportunities for tropes like this, such as how at one point the duo made a three-eyed monster — with two regular eyes and a "back butthole eye".
-   The Lickitung in this horrific _Pokémon_ drawing.
-   The SCP Foundation has a few of these in containment:
-   _Weapon Brown_: Similar to the Shelley thing, Mistress Van Pelt has some _interesting_ ideas for C.A.L.v1N.
-   Carmilla from the _Whateley Universe_. She's the child of Gothmog and often has eyes on stalks in horrible places. One time she grabbed Shadowwolf and her face split. Down the middle. Inside were more tentacles, with eyes on stalks. And other Body Horror tropes. Shadowwolf screamed and wet himself.
-   Crawler from _Worm_ has eyes all over his torso. He doesn't look even remotely human anymore.
-   _Zalgo_ mutations, although the ones on the face liquify into Tears of Blood.

    Western Animation 

-   Krumm in _Aaahh!!! Real Monsters_ carried his eyes around in his hands. His father did the same thing, but after one of his eyes was fired out of a rifle in the Revolutionary War, he started wearing a black glove on that hand. This was generally played for laughs, such as the episode where he lodges them into a mummy, then can't get them out before they have to retreat.
-   Played for Laughs in the _Animaniacs_ episode, "Chalkboard Bungle", When Miss Flamiel suspects the Warners are misbehaving behind her back, she proceeds to tell them she has eyes in the back of her head. The Warners respond by telling her that they do too and proceed to show her as proof. Wakko is shown to have nine eyes in the back of his head.
-   An episode of _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_ has Carl being sucked into a jet-powered toilet, leaving only his head intact. Frylock makes several attempts to construct a new body for Carl, including one made entirely of eyes from a website specializing in medical waste.
    
    **Master Shake:** Wait a minute. Before you turn him on... do you think he'll be able to see us?  
    **Frylock:** In ways you can only imagine.  
    **Master Shake:** But look, I mean... is he going to be able to chase us? 'Cause if I woke up lookin' like that, I would just run towards the nearest living thing and kill it.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    
-   Ten-Eyed Man and Mutant Master in _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_.
-   _Ben 10_:
    -   One of Ben's many transformations is Eye Guy, a Captain Ersatz of Cyclops from _X-Men_ in powers. Eyes cover nearly every inch of his body _except_ his head, which instead has large batlike ears.
    -   During the first series, when we learn what the Omnitrix is called, Ghostfreak is seen moving his eye behind him to look at Gwen. Without his second skin he can't do it since his head is basically a skull.
-   _Final Space_: In Episode 3, the helpers of the Order of Twelve don't have eyes in their heads but rather several mobile eyes floating around their bodies. Stevil can even use his eyes to trap people, like Mooncake.
-   One episode of _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_ had Ivan, a "seeing eye friend" for a blind child who had dozens of eyes.
-   _Gravity Falls_: In "Weirdmageddon, Part 1": Preston Northwest asks Bill Cipher if he could join Bill's Gang. Bill rearranges every orifice on his face instead. One of his eyes ends up where his mouth is supposed to be.
-   Dondoozat from _Jean-Luc & Dondoozat_ has his eyes positioned so one is above the other, with his nostrils between them.
-   In _Lavender Castle_, Captain Thrice has a third eye on his nose.
-   The Problem Blob from _Numberjacks_ has an eye on a stalk that can come out of his mouth at times.

    -   The Slitherbeast has eyes on its gums, meaning it can only see when it opens its mouth.
    -   Belos's One-Winged Angel form has glowing blue eyes all over its torso and back.
-   One monster in _The Powerpuff Girls (1998)_ was a large floating sphere completely covered in eyes. It could also shoot lasers from any of them. Hence, it effectively shut the girls down in combat as any attempt they made to get close resulted in the monster spotting her and zapping her. Conveniently, Blossom's poorly-cut hair made the monster laugh so hard, it shut all of its eyes, allowing Bubbles and Buttercup to damage it.
-   Peek-A-Blue from _She-Ra: Princess of Power_ gets Psychic Powers by the eyes on her peacock tail.
-   Dr. Five Eyes of _Skysurfer Strike Force_ has two normal ones, one in the center of his forehead, one on the back of his head and a giant eye on his chest.
-   _Steven Universe_: The Centipeedle has a single eye, which also happens to be her gem, inside of her mouth. She's still able to eat despite it though, not that she needs to. Before she was corrupted, she was still a Cyclops, but had a normal mouth below her eye.
-   Morbulus in _SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron_, who has eyes in the back of his head.
-   _Transformers_ :
    -   In an episode of _Transformers: Animated_ Prowl and Bumblebee get infected by space barnacles. They end up with eyes in quite a few places, but Prowl has one distinctly on his hand.
    -   _Transformers: Prime_ features Unicron having an eye inside his spark chamber.
-   _Xavier: Renegade Angel_: Along with being a bizarre humanoid with brown hair, mouth beak, six nipples, backwards legs, and a snake hand, Xavier also has a giant eye placed in the middle of his crotch which he calls his "pen-eye"
    -   One episode had Xavier meet a Mexican pet store owner who sells Mix-and-Match Critters and is struggling financially. At one point, it seems like he says "Ay, chihuahua", but he really said "Eye Chihuahua", which is one of the pets he's selling. It's a chihuahua covered in eyeballs.

    Real Life 

-   In the course of evolution eyes have apparently evolved multiple times, and sometimes in not-exactly-expected places.
    -   Box jellyfish have four sets of eyes on four sides of their body.
    -   Many insects have five eyes: two compound ones and three simple ones called ocelli.
    -   Spiders have six or, more often, eight eyes for 360 degree field of view. As an example, Jumping spiders have eight eyes: six smaller eyes for 360 degree view and a pair of huge anterior median eyes for high-magnification view of their potential prey, much like the field binoculars. The front sides of those eyes cannot move, but the _retinas_ can.
    -   Tuatara has a third, parietal eye (lens, retina, and all) at the top of its head.
    -   Scallops have tiny eyes all over the edge of the mantle.
    -   The critter that takes the cake is _Ophiocoma wendtii_, a kind of a brittle star. The upper side of its whole damn body is covered with refracting crystals and interconnected photoreceptors, forming one huge eye. Think about it for a moment.
    -   While not possessing _eyes_ in the strictest sense, certain species of starfish have skins that are entirely coated in optic nerves, allowing them to look in every possible direction simultaneously
-   Not a straight example, but many animals (especially insects) have _false_ eyes used to startle enemies or fool them into attacking the wrong body part.
    -   Some researchers invoked this, discovering that painting eyes on the backsides of cattle significantly reduced attacks by predators such as lions and leopards. Obviously, they all are eventually going to figure this ruse out, especially if the method is overused, so the researchers believe it is best used sparingly for only the most valuable cattle, with plenty of unpainted cattle in the herd to help lure the predators' attention to only the least valuable ones.
    -   Likewise, peacocks have fanlike tails covered in spots that resemble eyes. In addition to scaring predators, the tails also serve to attract peahens (female peafowl, with smaller tails and drabber plumage than the iconic males).
-   Another non-straight example: many animals - especially deep sea animals - have what _appears to be_ many eye-like structures all over their bodies. These are often smaller and simpler than normal eyes, and may often come in odd shapes such as a teardrop or an ovoid, but they still have many features you'd see in an eye, including lenses and shutters (eyelids). However, once you see them in action on a living creature, you'll see that these structures - called photophores - are actually eyes _working in reverse_. Instead recieving light, they emit it into a focused beam.
-   Flounders are born with normally placed eyes, but as the fish mature, one eye moves to the other side of the head, making them look not unlike a Picasso painting.
-   Speaking of fish, the aptly-named four-eyed fish, adapted to spot food right at the water's surface, has protruding eyeballs that are divided horizontally, giving it an upper set of pupils that see in air and a lower pair that see underwater. That's right: it's got its extra eyes _in its eyes_
-   Genetic experiments on fruit flies have produced flies with up to sixteen functional eyes on various parts of their bodies.
-   A mutant toad was found in Hamilton, Ontario that had functional eyes inside its mouth.
-   It's been theorized that some labyrinthodonts (ancient amphibians) had the ability to rotate their eyeballs to look out the roof of the mouth, letting them directly watch for prey swimming past or into their jaws.
-   A teratoma is a type of tumor in which tissues of very different type (compared to tissues which would be normal for that location on the body) may form _actual organs_ inside the tumor. Relatively simple structures like teeth and hair are the most common organs that occur in a teratoma, but more complex organs have also been reported, such as feet, hands, and — you guessed it — _eyes_.
