You have something you enjoy doing. Everybody does. However, you are the worst at what you enjoy doing. Whether it is cooking, singing, or driving just about anything, you are often the last person people would turn to for these tasks. Then a situation arrives where you are the only person able to take care of the problem. Why? Because your terrible performance is the only solution.

This is moments where somebody being bad at something ends up ultimately being played off as a good thing. Maybe their horrible skill ends up pleasing a monster whereas a skilled professional only pisses it off even more. This may result in them choosing to never get better afterward so as to keep it as a powerful weapon in the future or ask to get more involved in public performances if they think they are good at it in the first place.

Can often overlap with Spanner in the Works depending on the circumstances. See also Chekhov's Skill, when someone is established at being good at an activity that later becomes important. Compare to Blessed with Suck. Contrast Springtime for Hitler, which is when a character tries to suck at something for benefit, only to succeed instead, and Do Well, But Not Perfect where a character deliberately performs _well enough_ but not _the best_. A compare and contrast with Crisis Makes Perfect, for when a character succeeds in performing an action he's failed at previously Just in Time to save the day.

    Live-Action TV
