_"I masturbated once a week for medical purposes. I knew it wasn't good to let things build up."_

Sexual frustration is something that can drive or motivate a character in a number of ways, but it's something difficult for a writer to properly illustrate. One of the most popular ways of doing it is to show a character masturbating.

In Real Life, masturbation is seen as a normal thing that all kinds of people do, even ones that are in happy relationships, if private. But due to The Law of Conservation of Detail, writers won't just add random masturbation scenes, if not to denote something. In fictionland, a character masturbating is done to illustrate that they're sexually frustrated, unfulfilled, or repressed. A character who is Happily Married or in an otherwise fulfilling relationship will never be shown doing it since masturbation is seen as a shameful last resort for someone who can't get laid.

The type of characters this can happen to and how they're framed can vary.

For characters like the Hormone-Addled Teenager, a Lovable Sex Maniac, or have an Extreme Libido, they masturbate to deal with their extreme horniness, which is usually either played for crude humor or to denote them as a Loser Archetype. A sexually repressed character who thinks Sex Is Evil, and I Am Horny may masturbate in secret while hating themselves. A Stalker with a Crush will be portrayed as creepy if they are shown masturbating to their Lust Object while watching them in secret or with the items that they stole from them.

But this can also be framed in a sympathetic or even melancholy manner. It can also happen to characters who Can't Have Sex, Ever, are confused or in denial about their sexuality, are lusting over someone they can't have or has passed away, or even someone who Really Gets Around but is facing a dry spell. In single-sex settings such as a prison, boarding school, or military vessel, if the character is uninterested in a same-sex encounter, they’re portrayed as masturbating constantly to deal with the loneliness. Sometimes a character may actually have sex, but their partner is such a lousy lover that they're forced to take matters into their own hands to achieve orgasm.

Sometimes a character will masturbate to invoke a form of Situational Sociability: Masturbating just before an event where they'll interact with someone that they have an Inconvenient Attraction to, so it can lower their libido, they'll be more relaxed and clear-headed, and be less likely to make an unfortunate choice or embarrassing blunder due to their attraction. This may help a character who is a Shrinking Violet or Cannot Talk to Women to be able to talk to the object of their affection without it being a Gibberish of Love. Alternatively, they might relieve themselves before meeting the one they're attracted to to avoid experiencing a premature orgasm.

A common form of Self-Deprecation involves a self-aware character alluding to their hand being their lover. This can also happen to anyone experiencing or immediately waking up from an Erotic Dream, with the frustration usually stemming from not having finished the dream in question, or alternatively the one dreaming wanting more out of it.

See G-Rated Sex for masturbation depicted in a non-graphic manner. See Fetishes Are Weird for when a character having a specific fetish is used to make them seem weird or creepy. See I'll Be in My Bunk for when a character alludes to going to masturbate. Man, I Feel Like a Woman if the character has changed genders and "experiments" by masturbating. See Self-Abuse for portrayals of masturbation as unhealthy. See Sex for Solace for when a character has sex to deal with other forms of despair. See You Need to Get Laid for when masturbating or sex is suggested to an uptight character as a diss.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You_: Momoha is the first girlfriend to straight up ask Rentarou to have sex with her, and she mentions that while she's currently a virgin, she has plenty of "solo experience". Meanwhile, Hakari is one of the more lustful girls in the harem, but she's also a virgin, though her skill at handling a game controller is attributed to "Mwehehe practice".
-   _Ayakashi Triangle_: When Suzu forms her first omokage from feeling she has no chance of actually dating Matsuri, the framing and position of her hands subtly imply she fell asleep touching herself. Later scenes get progressively more blatant, to the point of showing Suzu in the shower, her hands off screen while she calls out Matsuri's name in ecstasy.
-   _Berserk_: Farnesse is a sexually repressed Rebellious Princess with pyrophiliac tendencies, tending to get turned on by people being burned alive, which she deals with by masturbating in secret. This gets toned down as she undergoes Character Development.
-   _B Gata H Kei_: Since the series is a ecchi Romantic Comedy whose main characters qualify as Hormone-Addled Teenager, masturbation comes up often (more so in the manga) and is the primary method in which the leads Yamada and Kosuda deal with their Unresolved Sexual Tension, which leads to a Running Gag that has the fourth panel featuring both Yamada and Kosuda simultaneously retreating to masturbate. Yamada states that there are two types of masturbation: the "good" kind (doing it to relieve frustration) and the "bad" kind (doing it out of boredom). She is then shown making a tally of the dozens of times she's done the "bad" kind in the last few weeks.
-   _Booty Royale: Never Go Down Without a Fight!_: Early in the series, Misora has a one-night stand go awry because her would-be partner took a pause to snort some cocaine, ruining it for her. The end of the chapter has her furiously jilling off before she can get to sleep. (While plenty of other masturbation scenes happen in the series, this is the only one motivated by frustration.)
-   _Code Geass_: Nina Einstein has a huge obsessive crush on Princess Euphemia li Britannia, who saved her from the Japanese rebels. At one point, she's nearly caught masturbating on the table while looking at the photos of the princess but lucky for her, the person who strolls in is Nunnally who is blind.
-   _Domestic Girlfriend_:
    -   Natsuo accidentally sees Hina masturbating while muttering the name of her ex-lover Shuu, showing she's still pining for him, much to Natsuo's distress.
    -   Momo innocently reveals that she "does it" almost every night, to further denote her eccentric sex-obsessed personality.
    -   Natsuo's two friends, while showing Rui around the various sports clubs, absentmindedly mutter to themselves, "I'll definitely fap to club activities (specifically, the sweaty girls doing sports) tonight." Cue the shocked look on Rui and Natsuo's faces.
    -   After Serizawa is told she's not seductive, she becomes depressed and frustrated. She deals with it by masturbating while watching romantic movies.
-   _My Dress-Up Darling_: Gojo is in a constant state of sexual frustration due to Kitagawa being a Shameless Fanservice Girl who doesn't mind being seen by him in states of undress. It's often implied he resorts to masturbation to deal with the pent-up frustration of their Unresolved Sexual Tension.
    -   In Chapter 5 / Episode 3, after Gojo suddenly wakes up from having an Erotic Dream of Kitagawa in her Shizuku-tan cosplay. When he looks under his sheets, he's clearly aroused and asks his beloved hina doll head if she could "turn around" while he takes care of it. Shortly after when he's at school, he wonders how he can possibly face Kitagawa.
    -   In Chapter 24 / Episode 9, Kitagawa sends him a photo of herself in a swimsuit to ask for his opinion on it, which gets left as "read" on the messaging app. The next day, when she asks why he never replied to her, Gojo muses, "A lot happened after seeing that photo." The anime makes this more obvious by having him look toward a box of tissues in the foreground when he states this.
    -   Chapter 36 / Episode 11 is far more explicit, after a series of awkward moments while doing a cosplay shoot at a Love Hotel while Kitagawa wore a Stripperiffic succubus costume, the final panel of the chapter is a bust shot of Gojo as he's very clearly in the middle of masturbating to thoughts of Kitagawa, indicated by him saying her name while one of his hands being off-panel with motion lines by the associated shoulder. The chapter even ends with the cheeky narration "The lingering memories were amazing". The anime downplays the implications by having Gojo's shoulder remain static during this scene.
-   _Franken Fran_ has a Black Comedy example. When beautiful young policewoman Kuhou visits a death row inmate in the hospital after a failed attempt to execute him, he's so attracted to her that he promptly masturbates on the spot, within full view of everyone present, and even ejaculates on her. Then he says he's good for one more, which sends Kuhou running away screaming.
-   _Full Metal Panic!_: While the _Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu_ anime only hints towards Tessa having an Erotic Dream after sneaking into Sousuke's bed, the _Sigma_ manga goes a step further by having Tessa slide a hand between her legs and start rubbing herself during said Erotic Dream.
    
    **Sousuke:** ...I don't want to sleep under the same roof as the Captain anymore.
    
-   Both husband Makoto and wife Yura are shown to masturbate to deal with their pent-up libidos in _Futari Ecchi_.

Fuyutsuki and others even stumble on Onizuka masturbating while watching a porn movie, and he tries his best to tell them it's Not What It Looks Like. He hasn't changed much since he was a hormone-driven teenager.
-   Despite Hajime of _I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying_ being Happily Married and having a fulfilling sex life with his wife Kaoru, there's one time he's resorted to this. In S1E12, Kaoru has to go to bed early because she has to work the following day. Hajime then goes into a Corner of Woe and reaches for a box of tissues, implying he feels blueballed and needs to masturbate off his frustration. What's worse, earlier that episode their married friends indicated _they_ are intending to have sex that night, owing to Japanese usually treat Christmas as a date night.
-   _Kokoro Connect_: Played for Laughs in episode 4, where two of the Hormone-Addled Teenager characters, Taichi and Inaba, reveal to each other that they've masturbated while thinking of classmates before, _including each other_. Inaba thinks it's funny, but Taichi finds the whole ordeal embarrassing.
-   _Love Hina_: Shortly after Kitsune allows Keitaro to grope her in exchange for a month's rent, Naru catches him in his boxers with a box of tissues next to him. Not too difficult to guess what he was about to do.
-   _Maken-ki!_: Usui is sexually frustrated because his lust for Himegami is unrequited. The 61.5 and 66.5 omakes both lampshade the issue by showing him having two separate wet dreams about her. Both of which, end with Usui dry humping his mattress in his sleep.
-   At the beginning of _Midori Days_, Seiji bemoans that becoming a chronic masturbator is his fate, as his badass Delinquent status actually seems to make it _harder_ to get a girlfriend. He specifically says being stuck "with his right hand for a girlfriend", then it happens literally. Ironically, having Midori on his hand effectively _prevents_ him from masturbating, and she even throws out all his porn to prevent it. A few chapters are dedicated to Seiji attempting to relieve the built-up pressure using his left hand, but Failure Is the Only Option.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_: _The End of Evangelion_ opens with Shinji in a suicidal state after the events of the previous few episodes.

Torn between his attraction to her and his stress from fighting the angels, he instinctively masturbates to the sight, complete with a close-up of his semen-covered palm. Afterwards, he immediately feels as revolted as the audience is. What Shinji then says in the ADV dub sums up his actions best.
-   _Osomatsu-san_: While all of the Matsuno brothers are shown to be sexually frustrated to varying degrees (and they each have their own hidden Porn Stash), Choromatsu is the one who gets hit with this trope the most due to being more of a Covert Pervert. Osomatsu claims he actually spends his time masturbating when he's supposedly looking for employment, which Choromatsu himself confirms in "Accident?". When Osomatsu catches him in the act using one of his own porn mags, it earns Choromatsu the nickname "Fappymatsu" (which comes up more than once in later episodes) and when forced to draw his face from memory, Osomatsu simply draws the outline of a head and writes "Fappy" over it.

-   Ax-Crazy Sako of _Upotte!!_ gets _far_ too turned on by the heat of battle in episode 5 and fondles her magic spot out of pleasure behind a tree.

-   Konuma Ryuuko of _Wolf Guy - Wolfen Crest_ is a nymphomaniac middle-schooler with what appears to be profound psychological damage from repeated rapes in her past, but she's such a nihilistic sociopath that even this isn't enough to make her sympathetic.

    Mythology & Religion 

-   The Bible: An older name for masturbation, "onanism", comes from a passage in the Hebrew/Christian book of Genesis, thus making the trope Older Than Dirt. The actual event mentioned was Onan ordered to have sex with his late brother's widow (this was practiced to keep the dead person's line from dying out). Not wanting to sire a child that would not have been considered his, he "spilled his seed" (pulled out before climax) on the ground instead (or in some translations/interpretations, masturbated before the act), and was stricken for his disrespect.
-   Classical Mythology: Hermes, according to Diogenes, taught his son Pan how to do this while the latter was pining for the nymph Echo, to relieve his suffering. Pan, in turn, taught the habit to the shepherds. It gives "tending the flocks" a whole new meaning.

As a reward, he gives her the key to open the entrance to the aforementioned mines.
-   _Killer7_ has Andrei Ulmeyda make reference to this concept. After discussing a "Stacy concert", he talks about how the sort of men who attend a Stacy concert "beat off _four times a day_!" The implication is that only men with nothing better to do with their lives attend such concerts. Ulmeyda then pantomimes an orgasm right before the arena holding the concert explodes, implying this is how _he_ uses up his energy.
-   _Leisure Suit Larry_: Horny Loser Protagonist Larry did this a lot, prompting him to start his Quest for Sex.
    -   Typing in "masturbate" in the first three games and _Leisure Suit Larry 7: Love for Sail!_ will cause the game to give you quips like "Larry, the whole idea was to stop doing that!" and "Aren't your palms hairy enough?"
    -   _Magna Cum Laude_ contains a masturbation minigame where success boosts Larry's "confidence", allowing him to interact with certain female characters in the game, as he's no longer so attracted to them that he can't function.

The logs said she uninstalls and re-installs it several times... until she finally settled on the _deluxe model_. Liara can even tease her about it in _Mass Effect 3_. The "Nerve Stim Pro" apps in general seem popular with quarians due to their immune system making intimacy very difficult for them.
-   _No More Heroes_: Travis is a Loser Protagonist who's a horny porn addict who's implied to be often jerking off to anime. This is further emphasized by the fact his Beam Sword is a Phallic Weapon that has a Unorthodox Reload that resembles the act of masturbating, with him pumping the sword up and down in front of his crotch while breathing heavily. In _No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle_, one scene even heavily implies he's masturbating while Henry is asleep in the next room. Notably, the masturbation jokes are toned down in the sequels after he and Sylvia have a Relationship Upgrade.

    -   In _Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony_ the Lovable Sex Maniac Miu invokes this by giving Shuichi a box of fap material (of which at least two of the contents feature herself), believing that he is feeling plugged up. Also, given how she openly talks about how much she loves to masturbate and that it is strongly implied that she is pretending to be a massive slut to cover up that she is actually a virgin, it can be reasonably inferred that Miu masturbates at least in part because of this trope.

When they get home, Jamie urges Ellen to "take a shower" while he "takes a nap", by which he means they should each rub one out so they're not sexually frustrated when addressing the fallout of that conversation.

    Western Animation 

-   _American Dad!_: It's a Running Gag that Hormone-Addled Teenager Steve masturbates excessively. One episode even has him suddenly bulking up and gaining a deeper voice after stopping it cold turkey, which, tying in with the show's lampooning of American conservatism, references a widespread rumor among right-wing groups which falsely claims that masturbation feminizes men. In another, when he finally gets a date with a hot girl, he tells her he needs to "check his schedule", so he opens up a day planner and we see that his plans for every night say "Whack it".
