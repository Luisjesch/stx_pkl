**Hondo:** Where were you deployed?  
**Nora:** Afghanistan. Attached to the Ranger 3rd Battalion. Heard you were a Marine.  
**Hondo:** Oorah. Good first day, Army.  
**Nora:** Thanks, Marine.

A lot of cops in media have a history in the military. Maybe they're a former Marine, or a soldier in the Army Reserves. You don't usually see a cop who was in the Air Force, Coast Guard or the Navy (excluding Navy SEALs). This trope is very much Truth in Television since police departments routinely recruit from the military because of the overlap in training at a police academy and military basic training.

Basically, this trope applies to all members of law enforcement who've done a stint in the military, including the Reserves and National Guard. Note: this trope is not specific to only America, other countries' militaries also count.

This is a Standard Cop Backstory. Contrast with From Camouflage to Criminal, when it's the _outlaws_ who have an ex-military background.

## Some examples separated by service branch:

    open/close all folders 

    Branch uncertain 

Comic Books

-   _V for Vendetta_ has an "Intermission", "Vertigo", where a "Fingerman" for the Norsefire government puts a man walking on the outside of a building as a sick form of interrogation (despite being sure he doesn't really know anything about V, he's just personally in a bad mood). V saves the man and puts the Fingerman, name of Colin, through the same routine under threat of certain death at his hands. The narration puts the reader into the head of Colin Clarke, a veteran Fingerman, a soldier before that who had to cope with worse than this in his training courses. Whoever trained Colin never put a Banana Peel in the way.
