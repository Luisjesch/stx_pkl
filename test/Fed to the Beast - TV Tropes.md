**Chairface:** Unfortunately, the three of you aren't going to be around to witness my historic crime, because I'm going to feed you to my pit of ferocious man-eating alligators.  
**Arthur:** What? _What?_ _\[to Tick\]_ WHAT?!  
**The Tick:** _\*ahem\*_ Standard villain procedure.

Feeding people to monsters or man-eating animals is one of the classic perils that villains and others subject people to.

Sometimes this is a Human Sacrifice to a demon, dragon, alien creature, Eldritch Abomination, or some other monster or beast. These scenarios usually have some poor unfortunate Chained to a Rock awaiting their doom. Maybe the local religion is a Giant Animal Worship which demands this to be done to Appease the Volcano God. Maybe the monster wants tribute in the form of people to eat, such as with many dragons. Maybe this is even meant as a punishment, in the case of Daniel in the lion's den from The Bible or Andromeda from Classical Mythology.

Other times, the beast is a Right-Hand Attack Dog — a pet or other creature that the villain keeps around for some reason, which he uses to dispose of victims, and more than one villain's underling has met their end in this way, usually after they've failed him or outlived their usefulness. If a villain tries to do this to the hero, expect the hero to kill the beast or escape in some other fashion. It's also not uncommon for villains fond of feeding people to beasts to meet their end by being eaten by the beast in turn, if the hero doesn't kill the beast beforehand. If the hero is particularly lucky, or the writer wants to be funny, the villain Forgot to Feed the Monster earlier and there's nothing but an emaciated carcass in the pit.

Another possibility is that the villain may set up the hero to be killed by local wildlife to obscure his own responsibility for the death.

Fantasy villains have all kinds of monsters to choose from, ranging from dragons to giant snakes to giant vermin to demons or something even weirder. Contemporary and pulp villains will often have their victims eaten by tigers or sharks or some other large man-eating carnivore. Sci-fi villains will often have some really freaky alien monster to feed people to.

The Shark Pool and the Snake Pit are two quite common forms of this particular trope. So is Fed to Pigs, although the victim is usually already dead in that case. (Usually.) Also related as Animal Assassin, a more clandestine way of killing people using animals.

See also Just Desserts, Eaten Alive, and Eat Me. May overlap with Throw 'Em to the Wolves (although in that trope metaphorical "wolves" are also allowed) and Exit, Pursued by a Bear.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Berserk_:
    -   Apostles are fond of forcing their subjects to send them people to eat, such as the Baron of Koka Castle and the Count.
    -   When one uses a Behelit to be reborn as a demon, The Legions of Hell kill the loved one(s) offered as a sacrifice, generally eating them alive.
-   _Chainsaw Man_: The Falling Devil feeds humans to other devils, usually by having them float up into doors to hell. After she's attacked by a Public Safety team and captures the last living one, she goes to the extra effort of stitching his mouth shut, prying his eyes open, and contorting his paralyzed body to hold a soup bowl full of his partner's body parts, all of which she personally rolls up on a dolly to a giant slug-like devil wearing a bib.
-   Happens in a _Doraemon_ movie, of all places. Specifically in _Doraemon: Nobita and the Birth of Japan_, where the gang - sans Nobita who's lost in a blizzard - gets captured alive by the main villain, Gigazombie, who then have them thrown into a pit containing a hungry sabre-toothed tiger until Nobita arrives with his trio of pets - Pega the Pegasus, Gri the Gryphon and Dragon the Dragon - to rescue everyone. The 2016 anime remake have the pit littered with skeletons, an indication that Doraemon and gang are _not_ the first victims Gigazombie fed to beasts.
-   In one episode of _Dragon Ball Z_, Vegeta and Nappa visit a planet called Arlia where the tyrannical Arlian king regularly hosts tournaments between his guards. The loser, if he survives, is thrown into "the pit" and fed to Yenni, a giant cannibalistic Arlian. While this is not tried against the Saiyans, the king _does_ order Yenni released from his pit when Nappa kills a whole bunch of his guards. However, the Saiyans make short work of Yenni.
-   _Fushigi Yuugi_:
    -   The Priestess is technically a Virgin Sacrifice for the Beast God she summons. It also functions as a Secret Test of Character; if she uses her wishes for the good of others over herself _and_ possesses enough strength of will, she can escape having her soul eaten. Out of the four priestesses, two (Miaka and Suzuno) escape, since both are too plucky to be devored. The third (Takiko) was dying already _and_ her strong will was paired with lots of self-hate, so Genbu started to eat her soul and her dad mercy killed her. The fourth (Yui) is fully devoured due to having been first broken and then manipulated by Nakago, but Miaka uses one of her wishes to bring her Back from the Dead.
    -   There was a snow-demon in the novel that explains Nuriko's backstory that demanded a more conventional Virgin Sacrifice from the village nearby. Nuriko befriends the girl about to be sacrificed, Byakuren, and atempts to save her; however, she ends up being eaten in an Heroic Sacrifice to protect Nuriko himself.

Also, Minuette takes out The Master by throwing the fob watch that contains his essence at the Wolf, who eats it.
-   _Purple Days_ has, in one of its loops, an insane Daenerys who feeds her enemies to her dragon Drogon. This doesn't work on Joffrey, though: not only is he not intimidated (due to all the experience he has from previous loops, including a battle with an even tougher dragon), he _actually manages to kill Drogon_.
    -   Earlier in the same loop, furious after Aegon killed Jon, Joff chopped off his hands and tossed him to Ghost to finish him.

    Films — Animation 

-   Ratigan feeds a hapless lackey to his pet cat Felicia in _The Great Mouse Detective_. Weird, because the professor himself is a rodent. (Or possibly fitting, to emphasize his cruelty, and badassery — a rat training a cat to be completely loyal is a pretty impressive thing.)
-   In _The Prince of Egypt_, Pharaoh Seti had his guards go to the Hebrew village and take away the newborn baby boys from their mothers. Then they would drop them in the river where the crocodiles ate them. It was depicted in hieroglyphs when Moses found out the truth of his heritage.

-   When Killer disappoints Carface one too many times in _All Dogs Go to Heaven_, he's lowered into a pool of pirahna.
    -   Earlier, Itchy overhears two thugs talking about having to feed "Carface's little monster" and assumes this trope is in effect. Actually, the "monster" is Anne-Marie, the orphan girl Carface has captive.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Against All Flags_, Hawke, Harris and Jones are tied to tidal posts to be devoured by crabs.
-   _Austin Powers_:
    -   In _Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery_, in an Shout-Out to _Live and Let Die_, Dr. Evil tries to feed Austin and Vanessa to ill-tempered mutant sea bass using an unnecessarily slow dipping mechanism (he really wanted Sharks with Frickin' Laser Beams on their heads).
    -   In _Austin Powers in Goldmember_, Dr. Evil finally does get his Sharks with Frickin' Laser Beams on their heads and Mr. Roboto is later fed to the sharks for demanding a bonus for his success.

    -   There's another Ray Harryhausen example in _The Golden Voyage of Sinbad_, when the islanders offer up the heroine, Margiana, as a Human Sacrifice to one of their gods: a cycloptic, cave-dwelling centaur. In a Friend-or-Idol Decision, Sinbad and his crew go into the pit after her, letting the villain escape with the magic amulet.
-   Conan's first dungeon crawl in _Conan the Barbarian (1982)_ ends with him killing a big-ass snake that was supposed to eat a girl that the snake cult was going to sacrifice.
-   Humorously averted in _Dragonheart_, in which con-man knight Bowen attempts to rid himself of a nuisance rabble-rouser by suggesting to her village that dragons can be placated with virgin sacrifices. His dragon partner finds the idea ridiculous, and even expresses disgust at the idea of eating a human. Except when he must chew in self-defense (but he doesn't swallow).
-   In _Dragonslayer_, the king feeds virgins to the title dragon every year in order to appease it so it will leave his lands alone. The plot kicks off when Elspeth, the king's daughter, ends up on the menu.

    -   _Thunderball_. Largo has one of his mooks fed to sharks after he botches an attempt on 007's life.
    -   _The Spy Who Loved Me_. Stromberg drops his treacherous secretary into a Shark Pool to be eaten. Later when Bond turns up to visit Stromberg, he's disturbed to see her severed hand lying on the ocean floor outside the windows of his underwater lair.

    -   _You Only Live Twice_. Blofeld drops a henchman who failed him into a Piranha Pool.

-   Shao Kahn disposes of Jade this way for failing to kill the heroes in _Mortal Kombat: Annihilation_, feeding her to a monster carving in a wall (and for extra Narm points, the carving gives out a great big burp after it's done with her).
-   Following the Christian Martyrology claims (see below), many oldschool films set in Ancient Rome include representations of Christians condemned to this. The film version of _Quo Vadis_ has a bunch of Christian kids _forced to put on sheep skins_ before they had a hungry lion released on them; it was such a Kick the Dog moment that the spectators were horrified (and mind you, these were all pagans who hated Christianity), and when Gentle Giant Ursui pulled a Big Damn Heroes for them, the audience pleaded with Nero to give Ursus a thumbs-up.
-   _Rampage (2018)_: Claire has the antidote for the rampaging animals shoved into her purse, and is then pushed towards George the gorilla, who promptly picks her up, tosses her into the air, and swallows her whole (including her purse).
-   _Shanghai Grand_ has the Dragon Lady villainess who owns a boa constrictor, which she uses for disposing of her captives. It bites her back when The Lancer managed to make her boa devour her instead.
-   _Spy Hard_: Parodied. After capturing the hero, General Rancor tries to have Agent Dick Steele fed to... a dinosaur. He escapes, and it feeds on Rancor's right hand-man instead.
-   _Star Wars_:
    -   _Star Wars: Episode VI — Return of the Jedi_:
        -   Jabba the Hutt was quite fond of feeding people to a rancor, including Twi'lek slave dancer Oola in a notorious Kick the Dog moment. He isn't quite so successful in his attempt to do the same to Luke.
        -   Once he's short one Rancor, Jabba tries it again with the sarlacc. This would have been a considerably worse fate than merely being eaten and killed, as apparently sarlaccs keep their prey alive for a thousand years while they're slowly and painfully digested (or at least that's what the locals believe).
    -   In one Expanded Universe story, Jabba's father Zorba tried to throw Leia to the sarlacc, seeking revenge for his son's death; however, a fight broke out that ended with _him_ thrown to the creature. Zorba is saved, however (though humiliated even more) when he makes the beast sick and it vomits him out.
    -   _Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones_: The Geonosians attempt to execute Anakin, Padmé and Obi-Wan by chaining them up in an arena and setting three monsters on them: an acklay (a semi-aquatic lobster-praying mantis hybrid), a nexu (a porcupine-tiger hybrid with four eyes and two tails), and a reek (a monster like a cross between a bull and a rhino, with three horns on its head). (Although the trope doesn't really apply to the reek, which is herbivorous; the acklay and nexu, however, were most definitely _not_ herbivorous, and try their damndest to prey on the protagonists).
    -   _Solo: A Star Wars Story_: This turns out to be how Han and Chewbacca met; Chewie was "the beast". Fortunately Han speaks enough of his language to convince Chewbacca that they can work together to escape.
-   _Street Fighter_: M. Bison attempts to do this, proclaiming his idea to the would-be victims in (OF COURSE!) wonderfully hammy fashion. Blanka, the "beast" in question, has other ideas.
-   _Superman: The Movie_: Lex Luthor keeps a pit with some vicious beasts (that are never seen) in his lair. After his plan to destroy California fails, his Perky Female Minion is almost thrown to them (she being the one who helped Superman and enabled him to stop the missiles) but fortunately for her, Superman shows up in time.
-   _Tower of Death_ has a savage martial artist named Lewis, who owns a personal zoo filled with tigers. Fighters who answers his challenge and subsequently defeated in combat, or attempts to cheat during their fights, will be thrown to the big cats.
-   _What a Carve Up!_: The killer plans to dispose of the four remaining guests by feeding them to a pack of dogs which haven't been fed for ten days. It fails because the butler Fisk has been sneaking down to vaults and feeding them.

-   Has happened to Alex Rider at least once in his career.
-   _Animorphs_:
    -   Taxxons and their Horror Hunger are easy ways for the Yeerks to dispose of people or animals they don't like. The only merciful thing about this is that Taxxons are fast eaters.
    -   Should Visser Three want someone dead in a way that isn't quick or merciful, he morphs into an alien monster and eats them alive. The Animorphs find this out when they first see him, as he only gloats for about a minute before messily devouring the alien prince who gave them their powers. Yeerk underlings who displease Visser Three one too many times are subject to him morphing into a natural Yeerk predator called a Vanarx, which envelopes the host's head with its mouth and sucks the Yeerk right out of the host's head.
-   In _Dragon Bones_ the villain has a Basilisk to which he feeds a former ally who hasn't lived up to his expectations. Alive. Even those who were harmed by the man who is fed to the beast (and made to watch by the villain) are shocked by the cruelty.
-   In _Eisenhorn: Xenos_, the heretical House Glaw tries to dispose of Eisenhorn and his associates by forcing them to fight to the death against two carnodons. This backfires when Eisenhorn’s team kills one of the beasts and breaks the chains restraining the other, allowing it to leap up into the stands and rampage through the audience.
-   As the Historical Fiction book _Fabiola_ by Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman was set in the middle of Diocletian's persecution of Christians, it happens more than once.

Despite how Pancras's legend says he was decapitated.
-   _Fire & Blood_: Before dragons went extinct, the Targaryens were quite fond of feeding people who displeased them to their dragons. The most infamous example is King Aegon II, who had his half-sister Rhaenyra devoured by his dragon, but he wasn't the only one. Rhaenyra herself had one of her husband's cousins fed to her dragon after the man accused her of passing off her illegitimate children from an affair as her husband's, and during the period where she ruled King's Landing, allowed people to pay to watch criminals being devoured by the dragons housed at the Dragonpit as a way to replenish the treasury.

-   The first book of _Galaxy of Fear_ has the planet itself killing and consuming people so quickly that they don't suffer. The heroes manage to piss off the Enzeen enough that they carried them to the "heart" of D'vouran, where being eaten would be far slower and more painful.
    -   In the second book the Big Bad tells his lackey to listen carefully or be fed to his battle dogs.
-   In the _Harry Potter_ books, Voldemort generally feeds his victims to his snake, Nagini, although they're usually (if not always) dead first. He doesn't want them hurting his snake by struggling, after all. Especially since the snake is one of his many Horcruxes.
-   In _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_, the eponymous guide mentions that the best way to annoy a Vogon is to feed their grandmother to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal. It also mentions that a Vogon won't save their grandmother unless they received an order signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as firelighters.
-   _I, Cthulhu_, a Parody Fic by Neil Gaiman. While dictating his story to Whateley, Cthulhu keeps complaining that his shoggoth hasn't been fed. So at the end of the story he feeds Whateley to it.

    -   In _Live and Let Die_, Bond's friend and ally Felix Leiter is caught snooping around the villains' warehouse and partially fed to a shark (the basis for his maiming in the film _Licence to Kill_, including the "He disagreed with something that ate him" note).

-   In _Pact_, Blake Thorburn employs this type of Death Trap as a method of keeping his adversary Laird Behaim contained after he's captured him. Laird is placed within a set of three magic circles, with each increasing in complexity and strength, and Blake sets loose a demonic imp between the first and second. The first circle is small enough that Laird can barely sit down, and certainly cannot afford to fall asleep, as he might unconsciously break the extremely fragile circle and expose himself to the imp.
-   In the Discworld novel _Pyramids_, being thrown to crocodiles is one of the standard methods of execution in Djelibeybi. When their gods manifest _en masse_ and start trashing the country, the crowd of priests who gather to gawk start throwing _each other_ to the reptiles whenever one of them says something that might be reckoned disparaging or skeptical about the rampaging deities.
-   In the short story 'Sandkings' by George R. R. Martin the main character gets into the habit of feeding people to his new pets, the eponymous insect-like alien monsters.

-   Older Than Feudalism: _The Bible_ has the story of Daniel, who was thrown into a lion's den due to a law that some princes had tricked King Darius, who liked Daniel, into passing because they were jealous of his success and hard work. Daniel, who had always been faithful to the Lord, was protected by one of God's angels, who shut the mouths of the lions. When the king learned that Daniel was still alive after spending the entire night in the den, he had Daniel taken out of the lion's den and the princes and their families thrown in instead, where they promptly got eaten by the lions.
    -   Christians in Roman times were supposedly fed to lions in the arena as well. At least, that's the excuse one Pope used for declaring the Colosseum a monument to martyrs to protect it from commercial development. The historical truth of that claim is more murky.
        -   _Damnatio ad bestias_ was the usual Roman punishment of particularly vicious murderers and those convicted of high treason.
    -   According to legend, St. Margaret was sentenced to be fed to a dragon. Large constrictor snakes, such as the African rock python, are known to be able to smother and devour large prey — occasionally children and youngsters. They also often were referred to as "dragons". The Romans knew the rock python, and if Margaret was a petite lady and the snake was a large specimen, the legend may well be plausible.
-   Older Than Dirt, actually: In Egyptian Mythology, souls that were found unworthy of the afterlife were fed to the monster Ammit.
-   The Christianizing King of Norway, Olaf Tryggvason, is said to have executed a pagan Viking chief, Raud the Strong, by having a viper stuffed down his throat. (Or should that be labelled, "Had the Beast Fed to Him"?)
-   In Japanese Mythology, the Yamata no Orochi was an eight-headed and eight-tailed monster that forced a pair of earthly deities to hand over one of their daughters to be devoured by the beast every year. Their eighth and final daughter, Princess Kushinada, was saved from this fate by the storm god Susano-o, who slew the beast by impersonating her, getting it drunk on eight large bowls of sake, and then chopping off each of its eight heads.

-   _Batman Beyond_:
    -   The snake-obsessed Kobra organization uses a variant of this. Any member who fails their duties, or anyone else who knows too much about their operations, is dropped into a pit of venomous snakes where they are presumably bitten to death. One member actually commits suicide by leaping in to avoid capture after believing he has exposed Batman's true identity to rest of the organization, gloating to the hero about how he'll be regarded as a martyr to the organization before doing so. They likely actually regarded him as a complete idiot; when he read a boy's mind using a computer to get an image of Terry's face, the kid replaced it with that of an action hero from a cartoon that he admired, because that's how he envisioned Batman.
    -   In "Ace in the Hole", the villain tried to feed Batman to a giant dog that had been mutated by growth hormone experiments.
-   The Joker threatens to throw people to his hyenas in _Batman: The Animated Series_, though whether or not he actually follows through on this threat is rather unclear. In at least one case ("The Man Who Killed Batman"), he shoves a minion to the hyenas for "asking stupid questions". However, the trope is toned down; the minion shows up later with a just a few bandages.
-   _Birdman (1967)_. In the episode "Hannibal the Hunter", Hannibal trapped Birdman in a net and arranged for him to be dropped into a pit with two lions in it so they could eat him.

-   Used as a threat in _The Legend of Korra_... by _Korra._ She probably wouldn't have actually fed the judge who railroaded her father to her polar bear dog as an afternoon snack, but he sure seemed convinced that she would! (Sticking his head in the beast's mouth might have had something to do with that.)
-   _Muzzy in Gondoland_: Corvax has this fate in mind for Bob when he orders the prison guard to put him in cell No. 19. He knows they are holding an alien monster in there. Fortunately for Bob, the alien is Muzzy, an intelligent and polite Gentle Giant who has no intentions to hurt him.

-   _Rick and Morty_: In "Thanksploitation Spectacular", the unchosen turkeys that aren't pardoned by the president go down a elevator to the feeding chamber of spider Franklin D. Roosevelt.
-   Done a few times in _The Smurfs (1981)_:
    -   In the episode "A Loss Of Smurf", Vanity as a Wartmonger accidentally wakes up the Creepodile in the Pussywillow Hollow swamp region, and Wartmonger legends say that it won't rest until it eats a king, so King Bullrush upon finding out who woke the creature up made Vanity king so that the beast will go after Vanity instead. The Smurflings help rescue Vanity by making the Creepodile feast on a gourd dressed up in royal clothes instead.

He may have overestimated his pet, or underestimated Kit Fisto, as Gor only managed to kill Fil before Kit took it out in self defense.
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)_: In "Turtles In Space: The Arena", the first event when the Turtles are sent to the Triceratons' gladiator games is fighting off a giant, fanged, tentacle monster called a Spasmazoid.

    **Raphael:** No, they're expecting that thing to eat us!

-   The first episode of _VeggieTales_ adapts the story of Daniel and the Lion's Den from The Bible, which goes almost exactly how it went in the original tale. The princes (or wise men in this story) are jealous of Daniel's friendship with the king, they trick him into passing a law that gets Daniel thrown into the den, and he's protected by God's angel. In this version of the story, instead of the lions' mouths being shut, they befriend Daniel and share their pizza with him.

    Real Life 

-   In Ancient Rome, convicts found guilty of heinous crimes could be "sentenced to the beasts" (_damnatio ad bestias_), which meant that the condemned was sent into the arena with a weapon, facing predatory animals such as lions, panthers, or bears. This was the equivalent of a death sentence, though there was a slim chance of pardon if the convict fought bravely. _Damnatio ad bestias_ differs from _objicere bestiis_ ("throw to the beasts"), in which the victim was unarmed and possibly fettered.
-   Vedius Pollio, a wealthy man who governed Ancient Rome's Province of Asia during the first century BCE, executed slaves who offended him by throwing them into a pool full of lampreys— bloodsucking, jawless fish. This ended when he tried to execute one slave while Emperor Augustus was a guest in his house. The Emperor intervened, halted the execution, and had the lamprey pool filled in.
-   When the Spanish started conquering the Americas, they also used dogs to help them out. While the only domesticated dogs known in the Americas were the ancestors of the Chihuahua and hairless dogs which were no larger than their descendants. Spanish conquistadors brought over large hunting dogs, including mastiffs that weighed well over a hundred pounds, and if their size wasn't intimidating enough, the Spanish would often sic their dogs on some unlucky Natives. Once the Natives were mauled to death, the Spanish just sat back and watched their dogs feed on their prey. Accounts claim that Conquistadors weren't just content with feeding adults to their dogs and would often take infants from their mothers and feed them to their hounds.
