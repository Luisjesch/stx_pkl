**Peggy:** I need you to get me a list of all the women that Howard has entertained in the last year.  
**Jarvis:** I don't think there's enough ink in the whole of New York to complete that request.  
**Peggy:** Fine. Just in the last six months, then. Is that possible?  
**Jarvis:** Oh yes. Yes, I suggest we start with the Western hemisphere.  
**Peggy:** Oh, please.

A character who is well known for how _easy_ they are. For sexual contact, that is. This trope is a Double Standard writ large: when a male character sluts it up, he's a stud and usually The Casanova, Kavorka Man, Chivalrous Pervert, a Chick Magnet and The Pornomancer or maybe an Accidental Pornomancer if they are innocent and aren't actively seeking it out. When a woman does it, she's a slut and it's time for the most insulting and aggressive adjectives, with "Really Gets Around" as a euphemism. But if she's a Dude Magnet and/or The Pornomancer, then she's a studette.

This sometimes overlaps with being evil, but is also a staple of sitcoms where it's more used as a simple source of humor. Jokes will usually play on her astonishing number and variety of partners. Often described as man-hungry, easy, loose or fast. In a more rural setting, she is often branded the "village bicycle" (been everywhere and everyone's had a ride...). Expect generous quotations from the Comic Sutra.

Compare Good Bad Girl. Also, Lady Drunk frequently claims to have been one of these in her youth. Sometimes overlaps with Ms. Fanservice. May be Fan Disservice for some.

An Ethical Slut is a specific, more modern Sub-Trope which isn't portrayed negatively. Extreme Omnisexual is related, for characters that are _more_ than bisexuals. See also Everybody Has Lots of Sex for cases where this Trope more-or-less applies to the entire cast of a work. If everyone _believes_ this about a character, but they're never seen doing anything of the sort (or it's mostly exaggerated), that's Urban Legend Love Life.

In Real Life, this is always a subjective topic with lots of Double Standard issues. In the words of couple’s therapist Esther Perel, "Even under the cloak of anonymity, gender stereotypes persist. Men are socialized to boast, exaggerate, and overrepresent their sexual exploits, while women minimize, deny, and underrepresent theirs." What is true for regular people also goes for politicians, Hollywood actors and actresses, models, rock stars, sports stars, TV news anchors and reporters and other media celebrities. Power and wealth eroticize, so they will attract more groupies and lusting fans. On the other hand their reputations are often exaggerated in the popular press or by themselves. The celebrities will be depicted as Bigger Is Better in Bed or as sexual supermen/women with tabloid articles and tell-all biographies informing us of their being in open, polyamorous or Friends with Benefits relationships and having engaged in group sex (both in threesomes and at orgies) while some of them are in reality not that well endowed or that exceptionally great in bed. Not only that, but some of these same stars and starlets have actually paid for sex. Similarly most of these celebrities, including porn stars are too preoccupied with their jobs, family, traveling and other important matters to be bed hopping every night. Many rock stars are too exhausted after a concert to immediately get it on with their groupies and many male sports stars abstain from sex before competitions, for instance.

Even though this trope is Truth in Television for many very attractive men and women, (Researchers have found that those same men and women started their sex lives earlier and have higher body counts consisting of 10 or more previous sex partners.) most of the time both the number of previous sex partners and the amount of sex they have are grossly exaggerated. If you believe some people, they have sex with a different sex partner every night of the week and not only that: it's always a satisfying experience. As the old saying goes: _Money and sex are the topics people lie about the most._ Prostitutes are the only people who, without a doubt, undeniably really get around in Real Life. Has nothing to do with _I Get Around._

    Anime and Manga 

-   _B Gata H Kei_:
    -   Yamada wants to become this, intending to get 100 sex friends in high school. The Tsundere mixed signals she sends out and her own sexual insecurity have so far prevented this, as will probably the genuine feelings for Kosuda she developed.
    -   Chika seems to be this. It is extremely heavily implied (especially in the manga) that she has sex with those boys that give her gifts, and there are quite a lot of them. Half-averted: when asked how to "do it without screwing up" she declares she doesn't know anything about that. Whether she means she doesn't know anything about sex, or just never worried about messing up, is left to the reader.
-   During a flashback in chapter 78 of _Blue Exorcist_, it is implied that Shura constantly threw herself at men when she was younger. When Shiro tells her she should have more respect for herself, she takes her top off and shoves her breasts in his face. We later find out Shiro Fujimoto was exactly the same way in his 20s.
-   In _Code Geass_, Emperor Charles Zi Britania has 108 wives. All are royalty, and obviously many have bore him children. In fact, the protagonist's mother was his fifth wife and very cunning in her own right, and Lelouch was the 17th born (and 11th boy) in the family. Think about that. 108 wives, who bore an indeterminate (with eighteen as the lowest possible guess) number of kids, all competing for the throne, many with genius level intelligence, many chessmasters, several downright ruthless, in a family that rules the society based on survival of the fittest. Yikes, Charles, couldn't you keep it in your pants? It comes into perspective when you realize Nunnally is 87th in line for the throne. In other words, she must be Charles' 87th child. Now, keep in mind the age difference between Lelouch and Nunnally is only 3 years. This means that between their births, he produced _70 other children_.
    -   In some defense to Charles, some later material suggests she got bumped down there as a result of being out of the family for a while, as a similarly 'disinherited and later reinherited' family member Marrybell is the 88th princess and is notably older than Nunnally.
-   Glorya in _The Dark Queen and I Strike Back_. The narrative is very clear that she has sex with lots of men, and one of her abilities even involves her giving birth to (apparently non-sentient) offspring with traits of other inhuman types.
-   Cross Marian of _D.Gray-Man_ He appears to be a big Ladies Man. Allen notes that Cross is supported by numerous lovers in different places. We meet one of his lovers, Anita, the owner of a large brothel in China. And it's from Anita that we hear Cross had relations with her mother as well, who was also in love with him. It's possible Maria was a lover of his, given their coziness with one another when Cross summons her -such as her being shown hold / cupping his face, in addition to the cover Hoshino drew where Maria is draped over Cross, and he's leaning his head on her. Allen also states in a JUMP SQ extra, that under his bed at his church, he has things from his lovers, pictures, accessories. Word of God says he likes good women, and his interest is visiting the Red-Light District. He's referred to as a womanizer by Allen's friends.
-   _Devil Hunter Yohko_: Sayoko Mano was sexually active as a teenager and gave up her virginity at age 15, which is when she became pregnant with Yohko. Which is also the reason the Devil Hunter power couldn't be passed onto her. A fact which her mother, Madoka, constantly berates her for; especially since Sayoko continues to sleep around and actively encourages Yohko to do the same. Thankfully, Yohko followed her grandmother's example instead and retained her virginity until she became the 108th Devil Hunter.
-   _The Disastrous Life of Saiki K._: The first thing Aiura Mikoto does when entering her new class is describing her hobbies of nail art, reading fortunes, and telling how many people she slept with. Then she calls her classmates and the whole school "bunch of virgins from VRGN High". They reluctantly admit it while she admits it's not such a bad thing, and she doesn't get angry or even respond after being called "slutty". However though, those segments are removed in the anime adaptation. Another time, she misinterprets Saiki asking her to go at his home to resolve a complicated situation as an invitation to sex, and he finds her naked in his bed.
-   _Don't Meddle with My Daughter!_: Justified since Clara and her mother, Athena, are frequently the targets of sexual assault by Blowjob's forces.
    -   However, Athena isn't always unwilling, being that she's secretly horny. She was even okay with both the times Point Blank took advantage of her, while she was under Zenovia's control. After being freed, she admitted he was as good as her late husband at satisfying her.
    -   Clara is likely the only character where the trope applies to a virgin. In _"Amazing Eighth Wonder Vol.1"_ she gets possessed by a phallic parasite that was able to feed off her repressed sexual energy. While under its control, Clara uses the parasite as a strap-on to thoroughly ravish Mei, _the entire staff_ at N.U.D.E's HQ, and her own mother, Athena, before she finally collapses in exhaustion.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Gildarts from _Fairy Tail_, listing several women when trying to figure out who he slept with to father Cana.
-   Golgo 13 makes a point of having sex before a job, and rarely if ever sleeps with the same woman twice. He is quite capable of talking a woman into bed, but will hire prostitutes if he can't be bothered. Notably, he's rarely if ever seen using protection, and sure enough, it's heavily implied (and on at least two cases confirmed) that he's left a fairly long trail of illegitimate offspring in his wake.
-   _GTO: The Early Years_: It's implied Yui used to be like this, if the jerks who told Tsukai that weren't lying. Too bad for them. He decides he doesn't care, since she's with him now.
-   In _Hanjuku Joshi_, Mari gains a reputation for being promiscuous with boys. It turns out that she sleeps around because every guy she has sex with leaves her feeling underwhelmed, which in turn is because she's a closeted lesbian.
-   In _Happy Yarou Wedding_, Todou used to and it earned him the nickname "King of the Night" as well as got him kicked out of his dad's house. Yuuhi is implied to have a pretty long string of girlfriends as well, who he dated simply because they asked.
-   In _Heaven's Lost Property_, Tomoki's grandfather claims he slept with about 43 million women. Now he phrases this as that he only needs to sleep with 2,957,272,615 more woman to sleep with _every woman in the world._
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_:
    -   France epitomizes this trope, with his character being mainly defined by his constant flirting with, undressing of, and feeling up the other nations. Just _how_ successful he is at actually getting farther than stripping them is up to debate though, seeing that most of the other nations show far more interest in keeping their distance from him than anything else.
    -   Greece might somewhat fit this trope, being said to be the most sexually active country around (surpassing even _France_), but his promiscuity isn't his main defining character trait unlike with France, so he comes across as more of a sleepy, laidback, somewhat spacey cat lover who just happens to be really good at getting laid. Add to that the fact that canon has shown him expressing sexual/romantic interest in only Japan so far, and it shouldn't be too much of a surprise that fanworks don't really emphasize this trait of his as much as for France who is _way_ more blatant and showy about it.
    -   In fact, pretty much _any_ and _every_ nation can fall into this trope in fanworks that equate all forms of international relations with the sexual kind.
-   In _How Do We Relationship?_ Rika is teased by Usshi about her "harem" in her very first appearance and openly admits to having sex with guys with no intentions of dating. In Volume 5 this is explored a little more with a scene between her and one of her hookups, who's convinced she must have some sort of trauma that causes her to seek sex, which she loudly denies— she says that she simply loves sex and sees it as a sort of "hobby."
-   Iono from _Iono the Fanatics_ is the queen of a kingdom with a harem of "ladies in waiting" numbering in the thousands, and is still searching for more!
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   Dio Brando is shown to have a number of female lovers (and most likely some male ones as well), with at least 4 of those women having had his illegitimate children.
    -   Suzuyo Hirose, Yasuho's mother from _JoJolion_, is implied to sleep around a lot, something that has caused Yasuho to resent her.
-   _Maken-ki!_:
    -   Chapter 32 begins with a veiled shot of Ouken Yamato banging one of his concubines so hard, that the force of his thrusts was shaking the guardian statue outside the bedchamber. By the next page, he's shown being dressed by two more of his concubines, while several of his harem are seen passed out on the floor around him—with another shown limp in her bed.
    -   In chapter 76, Love Espada is said to have slept with over 100 girls, during Tenbi's previous Himekagura Festival. Which is revealed while Usui and Himegami are eavesdropping on her as she's seducing Kyoki inside one of the club rooms. The next page shows Kyoki's been stripped out of her disciplinary committee uniform and is now wearing a school swimsuit and a collar with a cat's bell attached to it - having become another of Espada's willing Sex Slaves.
        -   Three chapters later, she seduces another group of girls and leaves them trembling at her feet, in orgasm.
    -   Episode 7 (season 2) features Rudolf, who's a living teddy bear with a raging libido. The shopkeeper Himegami bought him from tells her she used to be one of his lovers, until she caught him cheating on her with two other women. Later, he bangs Nozuchi offscreen, leaving her dazed with hearts in her eyes. And near the end, while Himegami's searching for him at the park, she finds he's left a trail of women trembling in orgasm; including Aki.
-   Kai Shiden in the _Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam Day After Tomorrow_ is strongly implied to have become quite the ladies' man in his exploits as an Intrepid Reporter. Though he still misses the long-dead Miharu from _Mobile Suit Gundam._
-   Shizuru from _My-Otome_ is another lesbian version. She's very devoted to Natsuki, but Nat-chan is far from her only partner, and when she's late coming home from an investigation, everyone assumes she just found a pretty girl on the way back.
-   Charlotte Linlin a.k.a Big Mom from _One Piece_ did this majorly in order to grow her family and pirate crew. By the age of 60, she ended up with 85 children (46 sons, 39 daughters).
-   Nagi from _Otome Kikan Gretel_ is a lesbian version of this trope. She actively tries to seduce her female squad mates and one of her first acts upon meeting the main character Yuu was to subject her to Marshmallow Hell. Luckily for Nagi, it's a Girls' Love series so her targets are often receptive.
-   Panty from _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_ lives for this. If the frequent displays of her sexcapades aren't enough, she sets the ambitious goal of copulating with a thousand men on Earth before returning to heaven. This being a vaguely Christian setup, she attracts divine wrath and is punished for her promiscuity. In the end, the solution to her problem? Have more sex, but with the right boy.
-   Subverted by Galko of _Please Tell Me! Galko-chan_. It seems the entire class assumes as a Gyaru Girl, she has pretty loose morals, but she actually have _zero_ experience with men, even a _nonsexual date_, to the point she's actually Allergic to Love.
-   Akio Ohtori from _Revolutionary Girl Utena_ has slept with half the cast (including both main characters, one of them being his _younger sister_) by the time the Apocalypse arc is finished. Touga Kiryuu (who hangs around with Akio for much of said arc) is no slouch in this either.
-   _Rune Soldier Louie_: Sometime before she became the head priestess of the Mylee Shrine, Jenny had to serve Rijarl<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , who was her sworn "champion"; and according to legend, he was a great and valiant man who accomplished great deeds... but the rest of the country didn't know him like _she did_. While he never slept with _her_, he was a womanizer who had so many lovers that Jenny lost count. So, she was surprised to hear Melissa say she had hoped to serve a "true" hero, as Jenny once had.
-   Minako from _Sailor Moon_, sort of: she gets easily infatuated almost continuously (in _Codename: Sailor V_ Artemis even congratulated her for 1000th "first love", and the series Dragon-in-Chief remarked she used to do the very same thing in her previous life), but the boys she crushes on never like her back, with the greatest examples being Higashi-senpai (from the _Codename: Sailor V_ manga, notable for suggesting Minako to wear her head ribbon and being the first youma killed by Sailor V), Phantom Ace (_Sailor V_ manga again, he's actually Danburite, the series Big Bad), Alan (from the anime. Minako was infatuated with him, but she introduced him to her best friend in London and they ended up falling in love with each other, possibly because they were both adults and Minako had been a minor), Hawk's Eye and Tiger's Eye (villains she crushed on and dated at the same time and attempted to involve in a threesome, but they were playing with her feelings. Sailor Venus opened a can of whoopass on them later), and Yaten Kou (anime only and definitely one-sided. After the reveal that Yaten was a woman in disguise, Minako states that "all her love had disappeared"). No wonder why Minako in the manga stopped having recorded 'first loves' after she killed Danburite and, later in the series, flat-out admitted to having renounced men...
-   Mitsumasa Kido of _Saint Seiya_ was revealed in the manga to be the birth father of all 100 boys he sent off to train as saints. Add in the law of averages for producing female offspring and boggle at how many women this old guy had in span of about five years. This is changed in the anime version where the kids are all simply orphans.
-   _Sakura Gari_: Souma's actually well known for sleeping with pretty much _anyone_. He's the victim of the more sinister version of So Beautiful, It's a Curse with the consequence that 99% of the time, everyone around him is either trying to sleep with him or trying to get him to sleep with them again.
-   _Yona of the Dawn_: Jaeha is well known to go to the brothels where he's from during his freetime and one can't help to wonder if he goes there to hang up with the ladies or sexual purposes.

    Fan Works 

-   Ling in the _Fullmetal Alchemist_ fanfiction _Seven Names Of Envy Angevin_. To date, although nothing explicit has been shown/described, he's flirted with or been shown to have a history with Ed, Russell, Vicki, Winry, and Sloth, and seems to have designs on Envy. Not to mention he brags to Russell about showing restraint and not sleeping with anybody for a whole two weeks.
-   In _Beating the Heat_, Granny Smith reveals that she did this when she was young. Also, Fluttershy when in heat.
-   _Better Bones AU_: Houndleap got sent to the Dark Forest after his death for having six cross-clan mates, with which he had a total of 16 kittens. Turns out he actually had more than six, though only six of them had kittens.
-   _The Bolt Chronicles_:
    -   Corabell, Dorabell, Mae, and Cheyenne in "The Seven" have clearly had a lot of sex in their day. Justified in that they are residents of a puppy mill, and their primary life purpose is to produce offspring.
    -   Applies to Bolt's promiscuous love interest Mary in "The Wind," who among other things seduces four of the dogs who later rescue Bolt. Lampshaded by their female friend.
    -   The two unnamed female tiger-striped tabby cats in "The Party" describe their promiscuous behavior at the title event. One brags about having had sex with eight male cats and a male dog while there.
-   _Bridge to Terabithia 2: The Last Time_ is set 5 years after the original, and depicts Jess Aarons as a matured, handsome teenager, a Badass Biker and Chick Magnet who had dated six girls in two years, not counting his on-off relationship with his current girlfriend, the new character Sonia Taylors.
-   _A Brief History of Equestria_ reveals that Commander Hurricane was this. It's estimated that 1-in-7 pegasi alive today are descended from him.
-   Corrin in _A Brighter Dark_ has reportedly slept with about half the guards in the Northern Fortress by the time the story starts. Her Hard-Drinking Party Girl status coupled with her Blood Knight tendencies are the early indicators that the story has taken some drastic turns from the original.
-   _Chaos and the Aftermath_: Samus sees her sexual cravings as simply a biological urge to be satisfied. She routinely has one-night stands whenever necessary. She's only ever loved one of the men involved, with most others being nameless and forgettable.
-   Celestia mentions in _Celestia Takes a Vacation_ that Fluttershy had shared her bed with more partners than Celestia had feathers. Not all of whom were male, or ponies.
-   The _Persona 5_ fic _Covering the Phantom Thieves_: By Chapter 16, Ren has, entirely offscreen, slept with Ann, Tae, Hifumi, Chihaya, Kawakami, Hanasaki (the flower shop owner, who is _not_ one of his confidants in the game), and "Aya from down the block", which gets him in trouble with his friend Keiko, Aya's daughter. However, following this he commits to a relationship with Kasumi/Sumire. It's mentioned elsewhere by Rise that Yu was the same before they got together.
-   Several characters show this in _Diaries of a Madman_, but in particular the protagonist Navarone. Slightly differently from the norm in that he does this as a coping mechanism for the psychological trauma he receives over the course of the story, and several characters call him out on this repeatedly.
-   _A Different Outcome_: Thornclaw has slept with at least three she-cats in ThunderClan, being responsible for several seemingly random orange and tortoiseshell she-cat kits in litters where the supposed father's genetics should have made that coat color impossible for them to have.
-   _Discord's New Business_: Downplayed, because she doesn't _actually_ get to sleep with any of them before having some sense knocked back into her, but under the influence of Greedgrowth Insanity, Rarity kidnaps people she's physically attracted to. We have: Spike, Big Macintosh, Applejack, Fancy Pants, Blueblood, Zecora, Trixie, Filthy Rich, Bulk Biceps, and a changeling. _And_ Ember.
-   The Mirror Universe Smurfette is this kind of character in the _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ story "Smurfed Behind: The Other Side Of The Mirror", who, although married to her world's Papa Smurf, likes to flirt around with and even (supposedly) have intimacy with her fellow male Smurfs. The only one she doesn't like, however, is her world's version of Empath, who constantly subjects her to Mind Rape for his perverse pleasure.
-   In _Power Girl_ fic _A Force of Four_, Lyta Tevor doesn't get along well with Power Girl because among other reasons she thinks Kara sleeps around and should stick to one lover.
    
    Besides, Lyta was never taken with Power Girl. Kara had an attitude problem, and Lyta figured she also slept around. She was pretty sure that Syl and PG had done the deed, and Kara might have had a one-nighter with that Firestorm guy at a JLA / JSA party. Plus there was Andrew Vinson.  
    Nope, Kara was just too full of herself. Lyta suspected she was full of something else, too. Little Miss Longlegs from Krypton should just pick herself one guy to sleep with, like Lyta herself had done.
    
-   In _Foundling_, Yukari is more or less implied to be this, as the clues imply she was once a prostitute. It's something of a deconstruction, as, while its implied that she was prostitute, it's suggested that she didn't choose that profession, as she was trapped in it before taking the first chance she had to escape and, subsequently since,was stuck with the stigma.
-   In _Hivefled_, Eridan's potential matesprit Preosh originally dated him out of sympathy because "everyone fucked him, but nobody _liked_ him".
-   In _Lasting Fame_, Riot uses his former rock star popularity to easily sleep with his fans.
-   In the fanfic _The Light Never Goes Out_, Pinkie Pie has _really_ gotten around over 200 years, to the point that nearly half of the ponies in Ponyville by that time can directly trace back to her.
-   _The Luckster and his luck_: A series of one-shots featuring Makoto Naegi's sexual encounters with many female characters from the series. Not only his classmates, but also Chiaki, Seiko, Ruruka, Komaru, Chisa, and even Ryouko.
-   In _The Mandatory Marriage Contract Fic_ Harry constantly refers to Mandy Brocklehurst as "Broomstick Brocklehurst" and at one point mentions that according to his info on her she spends more time out of her knickers than inside them.
-   In _The Means to an End_ while arguing with Harry, Ginny admits to having slept with every boy in Hogwarts from fifth year on up (except him and, obviously, Ron).
-   _The MLP Loops_: Fluttershy, surprisingly. Whenever there is a Fused loop, she often ends up sleeping with one of the new loopers. Of course, because they've all been trapped in a "Groundhog Day" Loop for a _long_ time, spending several years in a dedicated relationship for the duration of the loop is basically a one night stand by their standards. To contrast, Rainbow Dash won't even start a relationship that would last less than a few loops, and several couples date for hundreds of years before they're considered serious.
-   _Monsters In Paradise_: Orin jokingly suggests that this is the case with a Ditto she meets after it turns into a male Utsuho, without really knowing its reputation. Ditto claimed that it wasn't its fault, but considering that the next time the reader sees Utsuho she's introducing Satori to a clutch of eggs, the truth of that claim is up in the air.
-   _New Tamaran_:
    -   Supergirl is a sex addict who takes pride in being intimate with every other young hero (and heroine) in the world ... outside the main cast, that is<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . She's frequently accompanied by her best friend Wonder Girl<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , who follows her mentor's example.
    -   Bumblebee did this while at HIVE Academy, getting most of her intel from pillow talk.
-   Pearl's deceased wife Rosa "Rose" Diamond is described this way in _No One Said Life Was Gonna Be Fair_. It's exaggerated that she slept with the entire town, but Pearl never noticed.
-   In _Origin Story_, John Leslie, a Hydra agent who'd been following Carol Danvers for months, remarks how easy it was to use Danvers' promiscuous sexual habits to dose her with a a mind control drug.
    
    **John Leslie:** "She was cycling through the regulars there – I’m talking, like, a different guy or a different girl every night for a month, never repeating. She is seriously into the entire ‘take them home, fuck their brains out, shove them out the door’ thing and she never repeats a lover, I guess. So, I knew all I had to do was wait. Eventually my turn came around.”
    
-   _Persona EG_ has two major examples of this:
    -   Cadance has been known to sleep with many people, even when she was dating Shining Armor that didn't stop her from cheating on him, and she slept with three other guys when she was engaged to him and even when married to him.
    -   To a much lesser extent, Flash, who despite having a girlfriend and a friend with benefits has slept with almost every girl in the dorm. However, this was mostly to get rid of awkward sexual tension between him and the others and he is given permission to do so beforehand by Twilight, just as long as he remembers who he belongs to.
-   Ash's father in _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_. While his identity is unknown beyond 'the youngest criminal brother of Orre', someone Ash had met before time reset, and the Bloodline King, to pretty much everyone in story, it is slowly revealed that he wasn't exactly what one would call chaste. The fic hinted and showed several individuals who look a lot like Ash, before Chapter 23 happened. After that the story and the tie in oneshots really hammer in the idea that Ash's father was really _busy_. Multiple half siblings, all but a pair of twins by different mothers, appear or are mentioned, and it becomes a ongoing question in the review section of 'what region _hasn't_ he sired a kid in'<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , with one character impling there are _hundreds_ of them. It's eventually revealed that he spent _decades_ researching and following genetic trails to the woman he slept with for the purpose of having children specifically for genes they carried, and that a number of them were sired on the same day at different locations (specifically mentioning the Viridian City native Red and Pallet Town native Ash Ketchum being conceived on the same day).
-   In _A Prize for Three Empires_, Iva Kann has a healthy sex life.
    
    **Carol Danvers**: Don’t you have any feelings about life, or love? Have you ever been in love, Iva?  
    **Iva Kann:** I have mated, Ca-Rol Danvers. Probably more times than you.
    
-   In the _Progress_ side-story "Luna vs. The Facts Of Life", Princess Celestia has really gotten around. It started when she sought comfort in physical pleasure after having to seal her sister away. She has claims to have given birth to, among others: Shadowfax, Arion, Hengroen, Epona, Widow Maker...
-   In _Reinforced Magic_ Harry asks the Ancient Runes and Arithmancy professors for an honest opinion on his parents.
    
    **Septima:** Your father and Black seemed to be competing for how many times they could get laid by the end of their time at Hogwarts. I swear, if there wasn't a contraception ward over Hogwarts, you would have had several hundred elder siblings.
    
-   Yang of _RWBY_ tends to get this in fanfics. In _The Trio Of Festivals_, she takes part in two separate threesomes in two days, and her unconcerned demeanor both times implies that she's done it before.
-   During the Five Kage summit in _Son of the Sannin_, Itachi mentions that the Kinryu clan (of which Mei and Kurotsuchi descend from) are less protective of their bloodline limits than others, partly because of this.
-   _Sonic's Ultimate Harem_ (Not Safe for Work) is a Massive Multiplayer Crossover fanfic which tells of the many sexual exploits of Sonic the Hedgehog as he has sexual encounters with a different woman from a different TV show, video game, cartoon, etc. in each chapter.
-   In _Sunrise_, Frenda has a habit of deceiving innocent and gullible girls into her bed, either just for fun or as a method to gain informations. She also seduced and slept with Ruiko Saten in Chapter 14, though eventually she started to develop genuine feelings for the latter.
-   It's implied that Spinel in _Switcheroo AU_ has had a very productive love-life during her time on Earth.
-   In the _Tomb Raider (2013)_ fanfic _The Camera Loves You_, Sam has, according to Lara, "done absolutely everything" regarding sex. Her constant stream of boyfriends is a source of considerable annoyance to Lara.
-   Marisa Kirisame's status as the _Touhou Project_'s proverbial Launcher of a Thousand Ships (an achievement in its own right in this particular fandom) is often recognized in fanworks along the lines of this trope.
-   _Warriors: The Days The Clans Died_: Eeltail likes flirting with toms. When she gets pregnant, she doesn't know who the father is. This is extra troublesome because she's a medicine cat and medicine cats are not _allowed_ to take mates, nevermind have kits.
-   _What Did I Do In Another Life To Deserve This?_:

-   _The Aristocats_:
    -   Possibly Duchess. While it's not explicitly stated, the fact that she's a single mother and the occasional innuendo hints that she's been around the block a bit.
    -   O’Malley is implied to have had many female cats after him.
-   In _Lady and the Tramp_, Tramp has had many girlfriends/one-night stands before he met Lady. Fun fact: Disney was only able to get away with this because the characters were dogs.
-   Prince Naveen from _The Princess and the Frog_, at least before he met Tiana. While his claim of having had thousands of girlfriends is most likely an exaggeration, he certainly does seem very popular with the opposite sex during his intro in "Down in New Orleans".
-   Flynn Rider from _Tangled_ is revealed in _Tangled: The Series_ to have been this. In one episode it's heavily implied that he once had a threesome with a warlord's twin daughters, and another episode reveals that he got far enough with a crime boss's daughter to leave her at the altar. Much like Naveen above, this was before he met Rapunzel.

However, later in the film, when the X-Men show up again on the party before the final battle, Mystique decides to seduce Peter into having sex with her, even though she still seems to be in a relationship with Wolverine, simply because he's king and she finds that hot. Fittingly enough, the song "Promiscuous" plays over both scenes she's the focus of, the first being Peter imagining her dancing seductively for him and the second being where she shapeshifts into his desires (a larger ass and bust size, along with a unibrow and flabby grandma body type) before they get it on.

He rekindles his failed relationship with Gwen by the end of the movie.

    "I feel about men like you feel about money. So many, so little time."

-   _Kissing Jessica Stein_: Before dating Jessica, Helen casually mentions she was having sex with three men at once (but breaks off those arrangements for her).
-   _Kiss of the Damned_: Maia has lots of casual sex, from what's seen. It's not only for pleasure, but due to being a vampire who then feeds on her sex partners after getting them close. In the film she's with four people (though for Paolo it seems she hypnotizes him so it's probably rape). All are in quick succession after just meeting them.
-   In _Knife for the Ladies_, Travis Mescal is intimately acquainted with every Soiled Dove in Mescal, and apparently many of the respectable women as well, using his wealth and social position to coerce them into bed.
-   _Last Christmas_: Kate is pretty promiscuous at the start, having casual sex with different guys in quick succession. Judging by what Santa says, it's her usual habit around Christmas.

    -   A non-humorous example: the primary source for Angarak sacrifices to Torak are the Thulls. Pregnant women are not sacrificed. If a Thull woman wants to keep her heart inside her body, she does everything (or should that be every_one_?) she can to get pregnant if she isn't currently showing.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   Similarly, Salmissra has this reputation. It is equally unfortunate, since her overdriven libido is a known side-effect of the drugs she takes to maintain her youthfulness and apparent similarity to the original Salmissra. The current Salmissra sees being polymorphed into a ten-foot snake as a vast improvement in her situation because, for the first time in decades, she _isn't_ desperately horny and can actually even think straight.

-   _Black Iris_: Laney gets this reputation as a result of excessive Sex for Solace following her mother's suicide. Blythe... seems to just enjoy it.
    
    They lifted Mc Stud to his feet as he spouted off about suing the club and the drunk slut for all they were worth. Blythe didn't flinch. In her eyes, I caught a maniacal glint of delight.  
    "You stupid cunt," she crowed at him. "You can't slut-shame me if I love being a slut."

Briar uses sleeping partners as a way of coping with severe PTSD and nightmares, and his close family try to convince him to seek out proper help instead.

    _She had had many husbands, and had even been married to three of them._
    
-   Implied and then mocked in the _Dora Wilk Series_. As a succubus-like witch, Dora had to really get around to get energy she needed to live. After the events of book one, she doesn't have to, but she already has a reputation, so in the next books the gossips are that she slept with _everybody_ she met with, including her Guardian Angel, two archangels, Lucifer, Baal, Angel of Death, local vampire lord, local Alpha and her subordinate vampires. None of this is true — she sleeps with exactly two people during the series.

    -   Later _Dune_ books have the Honored Matres, who are so good in bed that the experience acts as an addictive narcotic. In contrast to the Bene Gesserit end of improving the human condition, this is quite openly about ruthless, selfish control, and philosophically at least, the Bene Gesserit have nothing but contempt for them (to the point where their epithet for the Honored Matres is "whore").
        -   Then, Duncan Idaho learns how to do it too, and passes the secrets on to a secret organization of men, leading to a shadow war were most battles are about who can out-nookie whom. The blowback from his very _existence_ leads to the sterilisation of Arrakis by whole-surface nuclear bombardment, which (for various reasons) was what the Bene Gesserit both wanted and needed to happen.

-   _Fairest of All_: It's mentioned that Siofra sleeps with many different beings, including various funny animals and local nature spirits which appear to include dryads.
-   _The Familiar of Zero_: Kirche is heavily implied to be promiscuous in the light novels, though later descriptions suggest that she just likes to string guys along and doesn't let just _anyone_ see her goods. But she won't interfere with anyone who's already in a relationship, as she has no intentions to die over another girl's boyfriend.
-   Francis E Dec accused his brother, Joseph I. Dec of sleeping with dozens of loose women and had to hide in the garage or the cellar.
-   _Frostflower and Thorn_ begins with the warrior Thorn trying and failing to guess which of her many sexual partners got her pregnant. Free sex seems to be a part of warrior culture from what we see in the book.
-   In the _Full Metal Panic!_ novels, when Leonard's first mentioned, he's shown to be a rather loose playboy that sleeps around. Over the phone, he's heard to have had sex with a woman with a high nasal voice.
-   In the _Gentleman Bastard_ series, the Sanza twins have a well-earned reputation for tumbling any willing girl, including quite a lot of prostitutes. Since Camorr's underclass has a fairly pragmatic attitude towards vice, they mostly just get needled for the proportion of their fun that they get billed for.
-   _Girls Don't Hit_: Joss and Colin both cheat frequently on each other, with her having a large number of one-night stands while he had several mistresses.
-   Diana Ladris from _Gone_ states that she had this reputation before the FAYZ, and implies that it was not wholly unfounded.
-   _Grimoire's Soul_: The main stereotype regarding Chatelaines apart from them being pretty but dumb outside of their Core specialties, is that they'll have lots of sex with pretty much anyone.
-   _Guardians of the Flame_: Walter is well-known for this, and continues to have a lot of sex with various women even after he gets married. Doria is a downplayed example, as she was apparently a bit promiscuous but this ends after she gets to the parallel world.
-   Ron Weasley is concerned about Ginny having this reputation in _Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince_, due to how many boyfriends she's had. Although there's nothing to imply that she's ever gone beyond kissing with any of them.
-   This trope is a staple of many of Robert A. Heinlein's female (and male) characters, as many of his works imply (or flat out state) a belief in a Free-Love Future, not to mention Eternal Sexual Freedom. Some specific female examples include Friday Jones (of _Friday_), Star (of _Glory Road_), and Maureen Johnson Long (of _Time Enough for Love_ and _To Sail Beyond the Sunset_).
-   _Household Gods_: Julia is quite promiscuous, saying she just loves to have sex and it's the best pastime. In fact, it turns out Umma utilized this by having Julie charge for sex, with her taking the money (Julia's happy to) but Nicole stops that, not liking the idea of being a pimp.
-   Aur the human Demon Lord and resident Villain Protagonist from _How to Build a Dungeon: Book of the Demon King_ has his way with many, _many_ women over the course of the series; that’s his usual method of recruiting them and make them bend to his will, he is not above taking women already engaged in a relationship either, in fact he doesn’t care, if he wants it he takes it.
-   In the _I, Claudius_ novels, there are plenty of examples, some of which are mentioned under 'TV' below, including: Julia, Augustus's daughter who is exiled for her promiscuity, which especially offends her father, who promotes traditional Roman family values<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ; Caligula, who commits incest with all three of his own sisters and opens a brothel in the imperial palace; and Messalina, Claudius's third wife, who challenges a famous prostitute to a one on one contest to see who can service the most lovers in a day and _wins_. Also, somewhat amusingly, Claudius is able to interpret a part of a prophecy as being about Julius Caesar when it describes him as being "every man's woman and each woman's man."
-   In his book _I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell_, Tucker Max recounts that he has easily had hook-ups in the "triple-digits", and estimates that he stopped remembering names somewhere around the 80-mark. Almost all of his stories have him being hit on by (and sleeping with) multiple women within the course of a day or so.
-   In _The Kingkiller Chronicle_, Bast passes his free time in the small town of Newarre by amusing himself with any number of the locals. When he gets A Day in the Limelight in "The Lightning Tree", he has dalliances with two women and plays Shameless Fanservice Boy to a group of Outdoor Bath Peepers in a single day. As one of The Fair Folk, he's quite single-minded about pursuing his desires.
-   In the book of _The Love Boat_, Geraldine Saunders tells the tale of a woman passenger who had a mission to sleep with every male member of the crew, _including the captain._ She did it, too.
-   In _Loveless_, Rooney often spends the night out clubbing and looking for quick hookups with other students.
-   In the Sidney Sheldon novel _Master Of The Game_, Eve Blackwell is called into her headmistress' office to be informed that she's being expelled for her promiscuity. When Eve angrily denies, the woman calmly hands her a list of everyone she's bedded. Eve herself notes that not only is it a long list, there are several names _missing_.
-   Elinalise of _Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation_ has a curse which makes her physically _need_ to have sex on a very frequent basis. Luckily for her, she also really enjoys having sex and has no issue finding new partners.
-   In _Nightflyers_, Melantha Jhirl sleeps with four of her male crewmates - and two of her female crewmates - within the first few weeks of her voyage aboard the _Nightflyer_.
-   _Night Watch (Series)_: Ignat, one of the Light Others, has the magic specialty of being a Light Incubus/Succubus, which means he's an intensely good seducer. He's a self-absorbed guy with "\[the\] face of a Hollywood actor and \[the\] body of a Greek god" and doesn't care much about the gender of who he seduces, so long as he's successful.
-   _No Gods for Drowning_: Various gods such as Lyvien, God of Instinct take various lovers and produce children on them. There is a chance that the lovers of these gods or the gods' kids can become divine themselves due to the contact.
-   Amber Sullivan from _The Nowhere Girls_ was molested by her Creepy Uncle at age ten. Afterwards, she felt like her body was only good for one thing and she wasn't allowed to say no, so she had sex with almost any boy who asked. Now her reputation for promiscuity has made her possibly the least popular girl in Prescott High.

-   As August helps Jane regain her memories over the course of _One Last Stop_'s first act, it is revealed that the latter had kissed over a dozen girls back in The '70s.
-   The gods from _Percy Jackson and the Olympians_ have enough children between them to have two **armies**, and make up the core of the enemy army against them. True, some are just descendants, and some are far more than others. (For example, Poseidon in the present day only has one child... human child anyway, while Ares has over a dozen, and there are gods who don't have any.) It helps to be omnipresent...
    -   Piper doesn't want to think about how she happens to have a dozen sisters and half as many brothers all within five years of her own age. But then their mom _is_ Aphrodite.
    -   It bites Apollo in the ass in his own series, since he can't even _remember_ fathering a seven-year-old girl who suffers through a Mind Rape due to her connection with oracles (prophecy being one of Apollo's departments). Her adopted moms were not pleased with him.
    -   The Norse Gods get into a bit of this too, though it is by no means nearly as bad as the Olympians. Freya still has so many temporary husbands (for Dwarven jewelry) her children count as a dwarven _subspecies_ though.
-   _Real Men Dont Eat Quiche_ contains a quiz to determine how much of a Real Man the reader is. One of the question is this:
    
    How many women have you slept with in the past year?<sup>Answer&nbsp;</sup>   
    A. 100-300  
    B. 300-1000  
    C. over 1000
    
-   Lalage in Rudyard Kipling's poem _Rimini: Marching Song of a Roman Legion of the Later Empire_.
    
    We've _all_ left Rome for Lalage's sake,  
    By the Legions' Road to Rimini.  
    She vowed her heart was mine to take  
    With me and my shield to Rimini.  
    (Till the Eagles flew from Rimini.)  
    And I've tramped Britain, and I've tramped Gaul,  
    And the Pontic shore, where the snowflakes fall  
    As white as the neck of Lalage —  
    As cold as the heart of Lalage! —  
    And I've lost Britain, and I've lost Gaul,  
    And I've lost Rome, and worst of all,  
    I've lost Lalage!
    
-   In the _Rivers of London_ book _Foxglove Summer_, Derek Lacey, father of one of the missing girls, has a reputation for this in the village. It subsequently turns out he's actually the father of _both_ missing girls. _And_ the changeling from fairyland that replaced one of them.
-   _Schooled in Magic_: Sorceresses, unlike other women in this world, are usually free to have sex with whoever they want. In particular, Imaiqah usually has a new boy in her bed every night. This is due to having use of contraception spells (which most women lack).
-   _The Silerian Trilogy_: Zimran and Elelar both frequently have sex with people. In Zimran's case, it's simply for pleasure. Elelar though only seduces powerful men to gain useful information, taking no enjoyment from it.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_ has a few characters like this, most notably Robert Baratheon, Amerei "Gatehouse Ami" Frey, and Oberyn Martell. The absolute master of this trope, however, is King Aegon the Fourth, who boasted sleeping with over 900 women and had scores of illegitimate children all over the kingdom. His libido was so out of control that it actually led to war.
    -   Cersei Lannister is an interesting example. She certainly _has_ bedded quite a few people, but she does it for political advantage, not out of lust. People she's slept with just because she wanted to number 3: Jaime, Lancel, and Taena.
-   Jason Stackhouse in _The Sookie Stackhouse Mysteries_. He has slept with almost every available woman in Renard Parish. He got in trouble the first book because he slept with most of the women who were murdered by a serial strangler. He did settle down a little with Crystal Norris once he became a Were-Panther.
-   Janea in _Special Circumstances_ is almost completely unhindered in seeking intimate company, and has shown no feelings of shame over it.
-   _Star Wars Legends_: The Zeltrons tend to have this as their hat. Justified somewhat in that they're a society of empaths with some pretty potent pheromones, and it's in their best interest to see everyone — natives and guest alike — are having a good time.
-   _Sword of Truth_: Nicci, having had "relations" with men in circumstances that vary to an insane degree, from having ritual sex with a namble, to willingly/semi-willingly staying as Jagang's consort, to one case that could almost be called prostitution, to one scenario where she slept with a man she _actually disliked_ just to get revenge on Richard and Kahlan.
-   True to how cats work, this appears in a few times in _Tailchaser's Song_. For example, it's implied with Howlsong as he's very friendly with _felas_ and Tailchaser notices that he's especially so with two in particular.
-   Prince Genji in _The Tale of Genji_. Actually just about every named and unnamed character in _Tale of Genji_. Seeing as this is Heian Japan this is also Truth in Television.
-   _The Teresa Knight Trilogy_: Teresa has tons of sexual encounters in each book. The very first one even segues to her having sex almost immediately.
-   _Third Time Lucky: And Other Stories of the Most Powerful Wizard in the World_: Magdelene is cheerfully promiscuous, and beds handsome men in almost every story of the collection.
-   Implied in _The Traitor Son Cycle_, when it's said that the current Abbess of Lissen Carak used to be fairly... prominent at the royal court before one of her lovers almost destroyed the kingdom and she left to take her vows.
-   _The Supervillainy Saga_: Specifically in _Tales Of Supervillainy: Cindy's Seven_. Cindy and Gary's relationship is definitely of the open variety as we meet multiple lovers as well as ex-lovers of each. Cindy even gives a lengthy list of exceptions to a more monogamous relationship she wants to start with Gary that ends up over a dozen. This includes, among others, Drizzt Do'Urden and the girls of Dragon Age.
-   In _Vampire Academy_, Rose Hathaway has this reputation, due to getting semi-nude and making out with hot guys. But she is actually highly selective over who she's intimate with—unlike Lissa. Part of her Good Bad Girl ways.
-   _Warrior Cats_:
    -   Willowpelt had been with three different toms altogether: Patchpelt (her own brother, though it might NOT be true), Tawnyspots, and Whitestorm.
    -   Jake is the father of Firestar and Scourge. He had them with two different she-cats: Nutmeg and Quince. Per Word of Gay, which is also heavily implied in the books itself, he had a relationship with Tallstar as well.
-   Melena from _Wicked_ was known for sleeping around with many different men in her youth. Her three children are speculated to be from different fathers as well, however they're not related to her sleeping around. Elphaba was a Child by Rape, Nessarose was either her husband's or their mutual lover's Turtle Heart's, and her third and last child (because she died during birth) Shell was her husband Frexspar's. _A Lion Among Men_, however, clarifies that Nessa is Frex's after all.
-   In the novels of _The Witcher_:
    -   Geralt is quite promiscuous, to the point where he even beds the leader of a gang of bandits whom he knows he's going to have to fight in the morning. In fact, the _very first book_ opens with Geralt waking up to a mute priestess propositioning him, and he's all too content to reciprocate.
    -   Geralt's minstrel friend Jaskier/Dandelion is also an infamous Casanova who often gets in trouble with scorned lovers or jealous husbands and regularly visit brothels.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Jenna from _30 Rock_ defaults to using her _"sexuality"_ to resolve any problem.
-   The page quote comes from an incident in _Agent Carter_. Peggy Carter suspects that the person who stole a lot of Howard Stark's experimental tech either was or was aided by one of his mistresses, only for Howard's manservant Jarvis to have a hard time naming all of them due to Stark's notorious womanizing. When they finally do find a way to get a list of all the women Howard had slept with over the past few months (by going to his usual jeweler and asking who Howard had commissioned him to make jewelry for recently), it runs to several pages, and Jarvis notes that it's _shorter_ than he thought it would be.
-   _American Gods_:
    -   Shadow's mother had _eighty six_ sexual partners in her life, according to Mr. World.
    -   According to Laura, before Shadow she slept with a ton of men.
    -   Bilquis, as a Love Goddess, is naturally very promiscuous.
-   _Arrested Development_:
    -   Subversion — Lindsay would love to be this character, but she "can't give it away."
    -   Her husband Tobias on the other hand has to practically beat the men off to stop them from coming over him at all hours of the night.
-   Oliver's tradition continues on to his own series _Arrow_ where almost every female character we meet past or present has at some point dated and presumably slept with Oliver. No wonder he ends up with a secret love child. This is thoroughly lampshaded in the _Elseworlds_ crossover — when Oliver, Barry and Kara arrive in Gotham following a lead, Oliver suggests looking up an old socialite associate of his who has connections. When Barry asks if Oliver slept with her, Oliver legitimately doesn't remember.
-   _Babylon 5_:
    -   The Political Officer in "Voices of Authority", leading to one of Ivanova's best ever Deadpan Snarker lines when she catches Sheridan making out with her.
    -   G'kar's romantic life doesn't seem to be limited to other Narn, given his being in the intimate company of human women, and in one case even a Centauri woman.
        
        **Na'Toth:** Ambassador, it is not my place to speculate on how _anything_ gets into your bed. Your reputed fascination with Earth women, for instance.
        
-   _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_:
    -   Starbuck. She gets _all_ the guys, including 2 of the Cylons, and doesn't give them much of a choice.
    -   Baltar slept with an angel, 3 out of the 5 female Cylon models (2 of those simultaneously, and 3 different versions of one of them \[not simultaneously\]), as well as numerous human women. Even more so since he gained his cult. Seriously, Roslin called it his 'nymph squad'. And plenty of fans would point to his interactions with Gaeta as an example, especially since the webisode reveal that shows Gaeta, at least, has no objection to homosexual romance.
-   _The Big Bang Theory_:
    -   Penny is often called out by Sheldon for the number of men she's slept with, although she does show some resentment on being considered promiscuous. Early on in the series she mentions that after a bad break-up she will turn to the nearest guy for a weekend of sex, but that she specifically doesn't enjoy it when it's over. Within the series itself it seems that she prefers a monogamous relationship but that doesn't mean she isn't dating a new guy every couple of episodes, as her relationship with Leonard became romantic and progressively more serious this trait has fallen away. Her bouncing around from guy to guy was more indicative of her tendency to go for pretty-boy jerks.
    -   Recurring character Leslie also shows signs of this. She has mentioned "waking up on a strange futon with a bunch of people \[she\] doesn't know."
    -   Sheldon's mom is a religious fanatic in the present, but freely admits to Penny "When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride and a bottle of strawberry wine."
-   _The Bisexual_: Gabe comments that Leila being bisexual means that she can be promiscuous as her range of partners is more broad. She gets offended and says she's only had sex with three people in ten years. Two men however had been within days of each other, then she also has sex with Tania, a friend, and her ex Sadie shortly afterward too, so it comes off as a Broken Aesop.
-   Blackadder mentions Jane "Bury me in a Y shaped coffin" Harrington, who goes like the privy door when the plague's in town.
    -   She did Blackadder. AND _Baldrick_. That says everything that can be said about her standards.
-   Angela Montenegro of _Bones_ has a lot of sex, to the point that it was a big deal when she decided to stop for a few months. Brennan isn't exactly chaste either, especially in the first two seasons. Interestingly, neither of the women gets slammed by the plot for liking sex, although Bones was justifiably called out for dating two men at once without telling either about the other.
    -   Hodgins seems to have an active history as well, though that's more an Informed Ability.
-   In _The Boys (2019)_, this is how Hughie is able to Blackmail Ezikiel for information. Ezikiel is a superhero that who preaches that through prayer, one can be cured of homosexuality, and his ministry also looks down on pre-marital sex. When Hughie was alone with Ezikiel, he wanted to show him footage of him using his streth powers to have sex with two men. However, Hughie's phone short circuited in the baptismal pool, and tells Ezikiel if he doesn't give him the information he needs then his contact will release the footage of them having sex if he doesn't hear from Hughie at a certain time. It's a lie, but the implication is that Ezikiel has slept around so much, he cannot remember a single individual.
-   Obligatory _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ example: Faith. Before she appears she's had at least three boyfriends, gets it on with Xander, tries to with Angel, appears to have a romantic interest in Buffy, sleeps with Riley, hinted at getting with Spike (later Jossed) and hooks up with Wood. To this day she is on the prowl for a new man, specifying Daniel Craig, but is in a dry spell through a combination of maturity and focusing on looking after Angel, non sexually.
    -   Angel's human self Liam was known for spending all his time drinking and whoring to the disappointment of his father.
-   _Caroline in the City_: This is pretty much the only memorable characteristic of Annie Spedaro.
-   Phoebe Halliwell, from _Charmed (1998)_. To the extent that her high school nickname was "Freebie".
    -   Also Paige. The difference is that Phoebe, at least in her high school days, had a reputation for stealing boyfriends, and even on the show some of her relationships are questionable. Paige is more of an Ethical Slut, with some relationships explicitly being Friends with Benefits. Obscurus Lupa discusses the difference in her Charmed reviews. She claims the reason she considers Phoebe a "whore" is because she mistreats her boyfriends and places her love life above her Charmed One duties, whereas Paige manages to sleep with lots of guys without it interfering with her responsibilities.
-   _Cheers_ had no less than three characters with this character trait. Interestingly, though, all three were something of a deconstruction of the trope, as their motives and reasons for being so open were explored in depth—with Frasier and Lilith around, There Are No Therapists was strictly averted.
    -   Sam Malone, the bartender of Cheers, was a legendary Casanova who serially dated in the first few seasons. However, he genuinely wanted a steady relationship, and repeatedly tried with Diane and Rebecca to settle down. After being dumped in one episode, he falls off the wagon and runs around with a young woman; Coach seems genuinely upset by both, indicating that Sam did this a lot more often when he drank. Eventually, Sam even admitted that he had become a sex addict, and actively sought therapy to help cure his illness.
    -   Carla Tortelli has eight children by at least two different fathers, and once looked forward to an evening off with "a little R and R"—that is, two men with names beginning with the letter. Despite the occasional barb, though, she was genuinely respected (or perhaps feared) by all of the patrons of Cheers. When Carla became unwillingly pregnant by a random man, the entire bar rallied to collect money for her and even sang her a song as she marched up the stairs in triumph.
    -   And finally there's Rebecca Howe, who bought the bar later in the show's run. In high school, she was apparently known as "Backseat Becky" (although she tries to claim that this was because she "never took a backseat to anyone", which fails miserably). Like Sam, she wanted a serious relationship and tried to put her past behind her.
-   Maruja in _Chespirito_. When the show became Darker and Edgier and depended more on adult humor, a lot of jokes rely on Maruja's promiscuous past. María Antonieta de las Nieves, who played her and the more innocent character of Chilindrina has stated that she hated the character.
-   Both 1LT Colleen McMurphy and K.C. Kolwski on _China Beach_.
-   _Dates_: Mia freely admits she likes sex and has had it with a lot of guys. She has casual sex with both David and Stephen later. It also turns out she's a former escort..
-   _Dear White People_: If Lionel's POV is accurate going by the incessant female moans, Troy has a lady over every night of the week.
-   _Dead Ringers (2023)_: Elliot is a nympho who has sex with random men frequently in the six episodes she hooks up with two different men she meets at clubs, a man she meets at a church, a lawyer she bangs in a restaurant bathroom, and even a Japanese investor in front of his translator who watches and gets a large erection.
-   Ben from the BBC's mini-series _Dis/Connected_. It's something of a subversion, as despite Ben's obvious physical appeal (he's played by Bradley James) all the female characters that are portrayed with any kind of substance are very vocally _not_ interested in him.
    
    "Listen you little panty-sniffer. You ever touch me again, I'll break your fingers."  
    "You are such a little slut!"
    
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The Seventh Doctor's companion Ace wasn't this on the show (for obvious reasons), but in the Expanded Universe novels, she shags just about every male she meets. Which is entirely at odds with her in-show characterization.
        -   She "distracts" a guard in "The Curse of Fenric", but Executive Meddling obviously meant it would stay subtle.
    -   "Aliens of London": When the Slitheen impersonating Oliver Charles abandons that guise for General Asquith, he mentions that he's going to miss it because of Oliver's private life:
        
        "He had a wife, a mistress and a young farmer. God, I was busy."
        
    -   Captain Jack Harkness. So much so, he apparently once got pregnant. When he was introduced, the Doctor admitted that when Humans achieve real space travel, our hat is that we are everywhere and have sex with everything.
        -   This is backed up by several episodes, including a Human woman who not only married a literal Cat person, with a complete coat of fur, but actually gave birth to a litter of kittens. And the cat person finds it odd that the two Humans who live next door are an elderly lesbian couple.
        -   Proved further when James Marsters comes back from Jack's time in _Torchwood_ and acts the same way, casually commenting on how horny someone's poodle is making him.
    -   River Song is mainly known for being the Doctor's wife. However, she has mentioned dating androids and Nestene duplicates (with swappable heads!), and in general likes to flirt with a lot of people, telling Strackman Lux in "Silence in the Library" to put his helmet on because he was the only member of the group she _didn't_ fancy.
        -   Furthermore, "The Husbands of River Song" reveals that she's been married to at least _five_ different people, as the episode itself features _three_ of her husbands, hence the title: the Doctor, who is quite astonished to see what she's like when he's not around; Ramone, who River gave Laser-Guided Amnesia of their marriage because he "was getting annoying"; and the tyrannical King Hydroflax — River claims she only married the extremely valuable diamond that had been embedded in his brain at the time. Before she recognizes the Doctor, she tells him he reminds her of her second wife.
        -   According to Steven Moffat, River is married to Benny Summerfield. Benny's creator Paul Cornell responded in less than a day to say that that is canon.
-   Kate from _The Drew Carey Show_ has a reputation for being... well... kind of a slut, and it's something her friends often tease her about. In one episode it's revealed that her nickname in high school was "Give It Away Kate" because she was so easy.
-   Sherlock starts this way in _Elementary_. Joan originally mistakes him for asexual until she starts to notice all the women he has flings with. In the first few seasons it wasn't uncommon for Joan to come home and find a woman leaving. Over the seasons, however, Sherlock has become less so this, and one arc even had him trying to have a monogamous romantic relationship again after his trauma over Jamie Moriarty.
-   _EmilyInParis_: For all her comical prudishness, Emily has a particularly active sex life, sleeping on average every other episode with another man.
-   _Euphoria_: After transitioning, Jules began to have sex with a _lot_ of men. Cassie also has this reputation.
-   _The Family (2016)_: John started having sex with a ton of women he met on his book tours, despite being married to Claire. Apparently losing a son made him very sympathetic to them. He then starts an affair with Detective Nina Meyer, who's investigating the case.
-   _Fellow Travelers_: Closet Gay Hawkins Fuller has been cheating on his wife Lucy since the beginning of their courtship and throughout their marriage. By his own admission, Hawk sleeps with with three or four men per year. If we take his word for it, then over the course of his marriage, he has had at least 96 one-night stands, in addition to two somewhat longer affairs (Andrew the contractor, and Craig on Fire Island). And that's even before we get to his long-term connection with Timothy Laughlin, which predates his marriage and has continued over the decades. (This relatively conservative estimate totals to 99 extramarital sexual partners over the course of his marriage.) Hawk did Gay Cruising more often before his wedding (he explains to Tim in episode 6 that his way of honoring his vow to Lucy is "By lowering my zipper only occasionally"), so the number of men that he has hooked up with since he became sexually active in the 11th grade is well over 100 (and 200 is plausible).
-   _Firefly_:
    
    -   Although it's more down to her plying men's belongings from them as opposed to any genuine promiscuity, Malcolm Reynolds assumes this of the interstellar con artist nicknamed YoSafBridge (stemming from three of her aliases - Yolanda, Saffron and Bridget - and the fact that she never gave her real name in the show). The latest on-screen (she re—appeared in the comics later on) run-in with her leads him and the crew to rob a priceless antique gun from another of YoSafBridge's former marks. As is par for the course, the gun's owner ends up discovering them, leaving her to somewhat predictably inform the captain that...
    
    **YoSafBridge:** He's my husband.  
    **Mal:** Well, _who_ in the damn galaxy ain't?!
    
    -   Jayne probably counts too, given that he has a thing for hitting up brothels when the ship’s docked and Mal doesn’t have him working.
-   Frasier from _Frasier_. The most common plot was that Frasier had a new lover and there's a problem with the relationship.
    -   His coworker Roz Doyle takes this even further, with her active sex life the subject of regular jokes. At one point she tells Frasier about a bar named "The Sure Thing", to which Niles says "How flattering. They've named a bar after her." When Sam Malone from _Cheers_ meets her in "The Show Where Sam Comes Back," they flirt with each other, causing Frasier to muse:
        
        Oh, boy. Just look at the two of you face to face. I imagine wild animals all over the Northwest are lifting their heads, alerted to the scent.
        
    -   Sam and Roz finish their "duet":
        
        **Roz:** Well, if you need any company, give me a call. Here's my number. _\[gives Sam a business card\]_  
        **Sam:** Well, thanks. That's a snazzy card.  
        **Frasier:** Yes, it glows in the dark.  
        **Roz:** So do I.
        
-   Joey is the obvious example from _Friends_; however, Phoebe tends to reveal many unexpected sexual escapades at the most random times as well. This is addressed in season 9, when Ross notes that she's well into her thirties, and still hasn't had a long-term relationship.
    -   Also in season 9, when Rachel tells Phoebe about how Ross flirted with a store clerk, she says he's "picking up some shop girl at Sluts-R-Us". Phoebe pauses for a moment, then asks, "Is that a real place? ...Are they hiring?"
    -   It's also hinted Rachel was like this in high school.
-   It is hinted in the first season of _Full House_ that Jesse has had quite the sex life prior to moving in with the Tanners. The first episode features Jesse talking about spending the previous night with his girlfriend and Danny interrupting with a more G-rated ending. Later Danny asks Jesse’s girlfriend to check into a hotel instead of spending the night because there are young children in the house.
    -   In _Fuller House_ it is implied that Stephanie has an extensive sexual history.
-   Madalena in _Galavant_ has quite the insatiable appetite. In the season one finale, there's a line outside her door of men she's "auditioning" to be her new consort and as one comes out, adjusting his trousers, we hear her announce, in a rather bored voice, "Next!" Later, a shot of her in bed shows her with a man on either side. Galavant even expresses surprise that she and Richard had never had sex in the year they were married, saying, "We are talking about the same Madalena, right?"
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   Ros, the prostitute. She has slept with basically anyone she encounters; in the first season there is not a single scene with her in which she keeps on all her clothes, and often is completely nude. She gets to wear more clothing in the second season, though returns to the status quo by the finale. Once this character not found in the books arrives in King's Landing, her true role is revealed: to be nude, often engaging in sex, in the same scene as one of Littlefinger's long monologues (thus Fanon coined the term "Sexposition").
    -   Tyrion Lannister (though this is mostly pre-series and early Season 1; he settles down quite a bit once he marries Sansa however, much to Shae's chagrin and once Shae dies, all notions of romance disappear - though he and Dany do exhibit chemistry later that neither act upon), an infamous whoremonger. Just look at his opening scene.
    -   Robert Baratheon, who has many bastard children by various women he's bedded (most of them whores) in different parts of the country (and, unbeknownst to him, _no_ legitimate children at all).
    -   Oberyn Martell, who is bisexual and frequently engages in orgies with prostitutes of both genders together with his paramour Ellaria.
-   Brittany from _Glee_: "You're pretty much the only guy in this school I haven't made out with, because I thought you were a capital G gay... but now that you're not, having a perfect record would mean a lot to me, so let me know if you wanna tap this." And she says it so sweetly and innocently, too. And apparnetly she does this with everyone in the school. Girls, boys... and Mr. Kinney, the janitor....
-   _GLOW (2017)_:

Debbie Eagan. In season 3 after divorcing her husband and while staying at the Las Vegas hotel Debbie begins having sex with various male staff. She mentions banging both valets (one of which we see her banging), the night bartender, a baccarat dealer, and even a juggler. She also hooks up with Steel Horse a famously hung wrestler in season 1 after seeing him perform while attending her first live wrestling show. And later sleeps with an old businessman named Tex in Season 3. In total along with her husband Debbie has sex with 8 people over 3 seasons.

-   _The Golden Girls_: Blanche Devereaux's frequent liaisons with quite a few different men are one of the most prominent running jokes in the series. The negative implications of this trope when applied to female characters are somewhat subverted, however, by her friends' usually tolerant reactions and her often being portrayed as having a clearly defined code of conduct in terms of who she dates, a responsible attitude towards safe sex and genuine feelings for her (many) romantic interests. (Blanche was also clearly _very_ faithful to her husband when he was alive, and was infuriated when she learned in one episode that he had cheated on her at least once.)
-   In _Grand Hotel_, Javi Mendoza sleeps with a different girl every day. His father Santiago puts up with it because he feels responsible for the incident that cost Javi one of his legs.
-   Before her relationship with Dr. McDreamy stabilized, Meredith Grey of _Grey's Anatomy_ was in the habit of getting drunk and picking up random men for one night stands. In fact, that's how she met Dr. McDreamy in the pilot episode.
    -   The male characters frequently lampshaded this quality — Derek used it to insult her, Alex told her he thought it was charming, and George pointed out she'd end up in a basement somewhere being told "to put the lotion on the skin or else you'll get the hose again".
    -   Also, Mark Sloan. He's had relationships with Addison (which led to Derek moving to Seattle in the first place), Lexie, Callie (with whom he has a daughter), one of Derek's sisters (who even comments "Come on, everyone sleeps with Mark"), and many more.
-   _Gunsmoke_: Miss Kitty was a prostitute and madam of the Longbranch Saloon which was also a brothel, by the curiously coy standards of TV standards of that era.
-   In _Haven_, according to Duke Crocker, his late father Simon "liked to travel" and has many, many illegitimate children.
-   Sylar from _Heroes_, oddly enough. He's hooked with Elle, Maya, and Lydia, and he's kissed Claire and Angela. He also used his time in Parkman's head to hook up with Parkman's wife. However, Sylar is a deeply unhinged Serial Killer... Elle died at his hands, he shot Maya in the heart, Claire stabbed him in the eye, and he kissed Angela just to creep her out and piss off Peter.
-   _Highlander_: After Tessa died, Duncan ended up sleeping with almost every female guest character, and had on/off flings with immortal friend Amanda as well.
-   _Hightown_: Jackie frequently picks up women for casual sex in Season 1.
-   _Hit & Miss_: Wendy had kids with three men at least, not to mention trans woman Mia (she's got four overall), while also being involved with her landlord in return for living there before she died.
-   Barney from _How I Met Your Mother_. As of Season 6, he has over 230 conquests and counting.
    
    **Ted:** You should be proud. You should be tested, but you should be proud.
    
-   _iCarly_:
    -   Rebecca Berkowitz, according to Fanon. It's implied for her in "iSpeed Date".
    -   Sam's mother also dates a lot of different men, every episode.
    -   Spencer! There's a reason he's a Pornomancer.
-   _I, Claudius_:
    -   Julia the daughter of Augustus in _I, Claudius_. As BRIAN BLESSED puts it:
    -   Messalina takes this to absurd levels. She triumphs over a prostitute in a day-long _mano-a-mano_ sexual contest. The event is taken from Tacitus' annals, in which he accuses pretty much every Roman Empress of being either this trope, a poisoner, a scheming harpy, utterly amoral, or some combination of the above.
-   _I Know What You Did Last Summer (2021)_: Lennon and Johnny, who are incidentally the first of the core group to die, were both quite promiscuous (with the former even making amateur porn videos as well for her Only Fans account).
-   _Interview with the Vampire (2022)_: Lestat de Lioncourt is very horny and openly admits that he actively seeks out the pleasures of the flesh. In his first scene with dialogue, he boasts about emptying a bank vault "sampling" numerous New Orleans women of various skin tones. He's obsessed with Louis de Pointe du Lac and seduces him. After Louis ghosts him after Their First Time, Lestat turns his attention to a prostitute named Lily, but he later murders her when she fails to be a Replacement Goldfish for Louis. Although Lestat's promiscuity tones down after he and Louis enter a committed relationship, he still craves "a little variety," so his wandering eye lands on Antoinette Brown, who becomes his mistress. In the late 1920s <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , he had pulled the wife of a scholar under the stairs during her husband's dull lecture on _Don Giovanni_, which strongly implies that Lestat and the woman had a quickie.
-   _In the Dark_: Murphy, before her relationship with Max, appears to have men over for casual sex with a very high frequency.
-   Dennis, Frank, and Dee Reynolds from _It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia_ all count.
    -   Dennis, who is typically The Casanova, has a sex tape collection boasting at least fifty conquests. Though it's increasingly implied that at least a portion of these women are _less_ than willing...
    -   Frank freely admits that he "bangs a lot of hoors" in his spare time.
    -   Dee sleeps with over a dozen guys in a short amount of time to try and empower herself by giving them all a low rating on a dating website. She also has a lot of potential baby daddies when the Gang try to find out who got her pregnant in Season 6. Both times, Mac and Charlie are begrudgingly impressed by her prowess.
-   _Just Shoot Me!_: Nina is frequently mentioned as being promiscuous, but it's rarely shown. Elliott, on the other hand, regularly sleeps with or dates gorgeous women (often models, since he works with them).
-   Monty Pippin from _Keen Eddie_ is the sluttiest character on the show (and that includes the "40-Year-Old Slut Who'll Do Anything For Money"). Eddie repeatedly disparages Monty for his lifestyle and tries to warn him of the consequences, but Monty never takes it seriously.
-   Despite being well into her fifties, Rose from _Keeping Up Appearances_ has no trouble getting men... _especially_ the married kind.
-   Aneka from _Kröd Mändoon and the Flaming Sword of Fire_. Aneka, who frequently has casual sex with men, often to get items which the Resistance needs, information, or once simply for _the time of day_. What takes the cake is her part in a pagan ritual where she'd planned on doing it with _three hundred_ guys on a single night (judging by the line, she had gotten through more than half). In one episode, when asked by a _cyclops_ if she's ever been with one, the following exchange occurs:
    
    **Aneka**: Ummm...  
    **Krod**: _"Um"_?! That's not an automatic "No"?!
    
-   _L.A.'s Finest_: Though it isn't focused on, Syd seems to have casual sex pretty often. She's shown having had women over for sex twice while not being in a relationship with either of them, the same going for Warren (her ex-boyfriend) and Jason, who she hooks up with. Later Syd hits on two twin guys she meets in a bar, giving her card to the pair so they'll call her and they can have sex sometime. When talking with Ben Bailey, she casually talks about having gotten oral sex from a man the night before too.
-   Mike Logan was unabashedly this at the beginning of _Law & Order_, even admitting to having had at least two girlfriends at the same time at least once. He mellowed out a bit (or at least stopped talking about it so much) by the time he came back from Staten Island.
-   _Lip Service_: Frankie, who's the most sexually active of all the characters. She has casual sex frequently.
-   Cat from _Lois & Clark_. She appears to hit on any mildly attractive man within sight. When Clark first arrives to the Daily Planet, one of the first things that happens to him is Cat inviting him over (then again, Dean Cain can hardly be called unattractive). Lois explains that Cat's bed is like Grand Central Station (even though they're not in New York). Not only has Cat slept with countless men, but she has also done it in any imaginable location. One episode involves Lois getting a luxury hotel room to pamper herself but ends up witnessing something across the street and brings back Clark with her for a stakeout. Cat shows up and reveals that not only has she been to this particular room before but proves it by revealing her name carved into an end table. Unfortunately, Executive Meddling forced the character to be removed after the first season.
-   Sawyer from _Lost_. At least for the first few seasons. He is never once shown with another woman in the original timeline after Juliet's death.
-   _Lucifer_:
    -   The titular character sleeps with a lot of people over the course of the series. Not all of them women, and not always one at a time. One time a case needed to interview his past flings over an eight week period and the total number of interviews came in at ninety-two. When he is dating someone though he is faithful except for when he wanted Eve to break up with him.
    -   Maze is another example, she's slept with Dan, Amenadiel, Lucifer, and a bunch of other dudes, offered to sleep with Linda and has a crush on Eve.
-   _The L Word_:
    -   Shane in Season 2 estimates she's had sex with between _900_ and _1200_ people.
    -   Later on Papi reveals she'd had over _1000_ conquests.
-   Kelly Bundy on _Married... with Children_.
    
    **Bud**: _Any_ chair she sits in is an easy chair!
    
    -   Supposedly, Peg was like this too before she married Al.
    -   In the later seasons we're introduced to Kelly's three closest friends that rival her in promiscuity, Ashley, Fawn ( "Fawn, Fawn, Lets get it on"), and Mindy.
-   _M\*A\*S\*H_
    -   "Hotlips" Houlihan; an early Running Gag was that even while she was dating Frank Burns, she still had side projects going with various Generals. After she dumped Ferret-Face, she was briefly faithful to her husband, then after the divorce went back to making the rounds.
    -   And there's Hawkeye, who at least _flirts_ with all the males while sleeping with (nearly) all the women. In the later seasons, this was somewhat deconstructed, with it being seen as pathetic instead of Casanova-like.
-   _MayfairWitches_: Rowan is known to have lots of sex with men preferring one night stands over monogamous relationships. In season 1 alone she hooks up with a bartender named Max, Ciprien, and Lasher.
-   _Minx_: Joyce once she starts exploring her sexuality and becomes less uptight. So far in the series she's hooked up with male model Shane in a restaurant bathroom, a rockstar, a male stripper she met at a show, and had a quickie with a random guy she just met in a Airplane bathroom.
-   _Misfits_:
    -   Alicia is shown to be promiscuous at the beginning of the show, which her power reflects, and in school was dubbed the "Cock monster". Later she's settled down into a relationship with Simon.
    -   Nathan too is quite like this, and catches an STD in one case. After he meets Marnie though, this changes him and the pair go off to raise her baby together.
    -   Rudy, too, is quite promiscuous. This comes back later to bite him when a woman uses her power on him, making his penis fall off after he leaves her once they have sex.
-   A Running Gag from _Modern Family_ is Claire's past as someone who had many boyfriends and lovers growing up, including several teachers, as a contrast to Phill who almost had no romantic experience before meeting Claire.
-   _Motherland: Fort Salem_: The female witches are actively encouraged to have a lot of sex with their male counterparts while they visit Fort Salem for Beltane (while it wasn't said in so many words, the implications were clear). Abigail in particular unabashedly loves sex and isn't afraid to show it, having a threesome with two guys that appears to be quite casual.
-   _Motive_: This is the defining personality trait of Liz Kerr, the Victim of the Week in "Natural History". Growing up in foster care, she lives as a free spirit and is dating several men and women. Despite the initial suspicions of the cops, her promiscuous lifestyle turns out to be only peripherally connected to the motive for her murder.
-   Rayna, Juliette and Deacon in _Nashville_ all have quite the number of notches on their belts in seasons one to three (though the show never tries to demonize any of them for it). In fact, Deacon's slept with both Rayna _and_ Juliette... although any Jaymes-Barnes hookups are the sole preserve of Slash Fic.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Never Wipe Tears Without Gloves_ has a few such characters. Most notably Rasmus, who manages to get around a lot while being in a loving relationship.
-   Old Christine in _The New Adventures of Old Christine_, a common joke of the series is her promiscuity during her college years.
-   _No Tomorrow_: Evie soon discovers that Xavier is sleeping with other women simultaneously, which she doesn't take too kindly to. Kareema also appears to have a fairly promiscuous lifestyle.
-   In _The O.C._ Marissa Cooper's boyfriend Luke Ward has sex with everyone, according to the character Holly.
-   Implied with Marlene on _Only Fools and Horses_.
    
    "We all remember Marlene!"
    
-   Klaus Mikaelsson on _The Originals_. The list of women he has slept with is long and he often kills them afterward. It'd be easier to list the women he's slept with and hasn't killed. He's only been in love 4 times (Caroline, Tatia, Camille, and Aurora). He only has one child surprisingly due to vampire sterility. Also Marcel has slept with a number of women but has been in love with Rebekah for years. Kol counts as well but once he met Davina, he was devoted to her and she to him.
-   _Pandora_: Atria sleeps with many of the academy students, no matter their gender, and relates some of her more exotic past encounters too (such as having sex with an intersex person from another species).
-   _Party of Five_: Before he had to take over the family, Emilio had a bunch of girlfriends simultaneously. He still gets with four women over the course of the first season alone after this.
-   Al Calavicci of _Quantum Leap_. As Sam Beckett put it, with only slight exaggeration if what Al says is to be believed, he was "a practicing pervert at the age of five." Fortunately, there's a lot more to the guy than that, even it isn't immediately apparent.
-   Brian Kinney from _Queer as Folk (US)_. Even when he supposedly has a steady boyfriend, he's still sleeping with as many men as he can.
-   _Reba_ has Barbra Jean, whose affair with Reba's ex-husband ended up in her pregnancy and marriage with said ex-husband, being this prior to the said affair.
-   _Red Dwarf_ doesn't offer a lot of opportunity, but when it does...
    
    **Debbie:** No offence, but you're not exactly Mr. Difficult-to-Pull, are you? Talk about a pushover!  
    **Dave:** Oh, that's rich, coming from Miss Yo-Yo Knickers!
    
    -   In fact, since everybody on the show is so much like this, having Kochanski from another universe turn out not to be is an obvious double standard used for laughs.
    -   _In fact_ in fact, "Miss Yo-Yo Knickers" used to be the name of this trope, but (a) it's not female only, and (b) next to nobody could figure out how to parse it to make a link, with the dash and all.
        
        -   And of course, Ace Rimmer, (the alternate universe Captain America style alternative to Arnold Rimmer) makes everyone around him act like this, even straight men.
        
        **Bongo:** If you need me, I'll... be in my quarters at lunchtime, covered in taramasalata.  
        **Ace:** I didn't know your bread was buttered that side, Bongo.  
        **Bongo:** It _isn't_. I've been happily married for thirty-five years. It's just... a chap like you can... _really_ turn a guy's head.
        
    -   Rimmer's mother is known to have had affairs with Rimmer's best friend's dad, her husband's brother and Dungo Dennis, the gardener, who is Rimmer's real father, with implied further relationships. Initially, Rimmer was in denial about this, claiming she was "very prim, very reserved", but in a later episode, when Holly and Kryten became upset that they'd "never had a mum", he retorted "You can all have mine. Everyone else did."
-   _Reservation Dogs_: Bev wears all her snags' ID cards as conquest trophies at the IHS conference. Her whole chest is covered in them, and that's before she even snags at this year's conference.
-   _Roseanne_
    -   Jackie has this reputation. In one episode she and her then-boyfriend, Fred, have an incident when they discuss how many people they've slept with. She estimates about three per year, which makes about sixty overall (though it's probably more—Fred just assumes she started around eighteen, while her reaction says otherwise). Fred has been with _three_ women, counting her, and is a bit freaked out. (They started dating after a one-night stand got Jackie pregnant, so he probably should have known better.)
    -   In one episode, Dan and Roseanne perform a Halloween ventriloquist act with Roseanne playing "Mortuary Snerd". After "Deadgar Bergin" (Dan) informs her that Jackie is now a truck driver, she says "That's funny. Jackie. In the front seat of a truck. With _her feet on the floor_."
    -   The revival/Sequel Series _The Connors_ takes place after a Time Skip, during which Mark died. Becky has apparently become (in Jackie's words) "popular" since then. Eventually she realizes that these flings have never gone anywhere because she doesn't want to actually commit to anybody but Mark, so she tries to finally move on and look for a relationship that will involve more than sex.
-   Jordan Sullivan of _Scrubs_. Notably this doesn't bother her ex-husband Dr. Cox. In fact, he was happy to ask all the doctors present to raise their hands if they had slept with her in the year or so that they were split up. Everybody, _including every woman_, raises their hands (J.D. does so behind his then-girlfriends back).
    -   Also Julie Keaton the pharmaceutical representative.
    -   Elliot _sort of_ had such a reputation applied to her, beginning in the second season. Whether it's _Apropos_ or not is debatable; it was originally the result of a one-night stand with a surgeon, who shared the details with everyone he knew.
    -   The Todd comes out of the closet. Not as gay, nor even bisexual. He comes out as The Todd. He becomes aroused at anything, even the **concept** of _not being aroused!_
-   Adrian and Ricky on _The Secret Life of the American Teenager_. The double standard is played pretty straight here as the other characters and fanbase are harsh with Adrian and more understanding with Ricky. Although this may be due to the fact that his father sexually abused him as a child.
-   While all the characters on _Sex and the City_ are, ahem, fairly well-traveled, it's Samantha Jones who best exemplifies the trope. In fact, when she went to get an STD test, the doctor asked her how many partners she'd had. Long pause... "I'm counting." Long pause... "This year?"
-   _Sex/Life_:
    -   Billie had quite an active sex life as a single woman, to judge by the many men she's shown having sex with in flashbacks.
    -   Her friend Sasha is still living that kind of lifestyle in Season 1.
-   Leighton Murray of _The Sex Lives of College Girls_ has frequent casual sex with women. She once stated that she was talking to 30 girls in campus simultaneously.
-   _She's Gotta Have It_:
    -   Nola as in the film loves to have sex and so has it frequently.
    -   Greer also has slept with _many_ women, as shown in a brief sex montage. In a bar he gets greeted by a bunch of those he slept with.
-   _Single Drunk Female_: Sam was pretty promiscuous during her drinking days, and later she expresses dismay at how many "disgusting" people she'd hooked up with. This also provides the Blink-and-You-Miss-It reveal that she's bisexual, since some of the people are shown to be women (she doesn't explicitly have sex with a woman until later). As an example, she'd had sex with James almost immediately after they just met (while both were drunk, though she does make a point of insuring that he consents, for what it's worth). Even when sober she also has sex with Chloe after they just met though.
-   Gangster's daughter Kayley White, Tony Stonem and possible his sister Effy in _Skins_.
    
    -   Don't forget Cassie.
    
    **Michelle**: Cassie's great in the sack, as long as she's not hungry.  
    **Sid**: Says who?  
    **Michelle** and **Tony**: Everyone.
    
-   Oliver Queen lives up to the tradition in _Smallville_. The wiki has this to say:
    -   Lionel does as well, as he's been with _many_ women and has two illegitimate children. (Lucas and Tess.)
    -   In-universe characters accuse Tess herself of this, but it doesn't really work, as during the course of her three years on the show we only see her with three men—one an ex-boyfriend, one a guy who she's trying to manipulate, and one example of Pair the Smart Ones that was entirely the fault of magic-spiked champagne that got both of them instantly blackout drunk (neither of them knew it was spiked when they drank it, so it really is not even remotely the fault of either of them). It actually kind of seems like her habit of trying to flirt her way out of trouble (when beating them to a pulp won't work) is just misinterpreted by the other characters.
-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_:
    -   "The Outrageous Okona" has a male version: Captain Thadiun Okona. Although he is only a one shot character, appearing only in this episode, having sex with tons of women crewmembers is pretty much what he does through most of the episode (it is also implied he does Counselor Troi).
    -   The Enterprise-D visits the planet Edo in the first season:
        
        **La Forge**: Neat as pins, ultra-lawful; and they make love at the drop of a hat.  
        **Yar**: Any hat, sir.
        
    -   Though there's also the original, and possibly the most famous, Captain Kirk. Interestingly Kirk's reputation is actually somewhat exaggerated—he shows interest in a lot of women over the course of the show, but only actually has sex with a few of them.
    -   Marlena in the Mirror Universe episode "Mirror, Mirror" pretty much states outright that she's willing to sleep her way to the top—when Normal Universe Kirk refuses to sleep with her she assumes he's saying their affair is over and asks for a transfer so she can start over.
        
        **Mirror!Marlena**: "I've been a Captain's Woman and I like it. I'll be one again if I have to go through every officer in the fleet!"  
        **Our!Kirk**: "You could." _she goes to hit him and he catches her hand._ "I just meant you were capable of becoming anything you wanted to be."
        
    -   Intendant Kira. Though she went yet a step further, then tried to go a step beyond that when she met Prime!Kira.
    -   Major Kira herself, by _Star Trek_ double standards at least.
    -   Having lived for 350 years and seven lifetimes, Dax actually got around a lot (she once confessed to have spent time with Dr. McCoy while he was at Ole Miss—as Emony Dax). She was married six times and had five children as a mother and four as a father. However, Curzon Dax was never married or had any children, but was widely known to chase after everything that was female and mostly humanoid.
    -   The Mirror Universe episode in _Enterprise_ "put the ho back in Hoshi" (as the producers put it), with the cute Asian ensign jumping from the bed of one officer to another as it suits her advantage politically. T'Pol even snarks at her over it during their knife fight. This is a carry-on of the "Captain's Woman" in the first Mirror Universe episode, who flat out admitted to doing the same thing to survive in that Dog Eat Dog world.
    -   Riker seemed to get around as well. He even ran out of full females and broadened his horizons to include an androgyne.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   While Tom Paris is played off as the ladies' man on _Voyager_, he's mostly dating (or trying to date) one woman at a time for the first few seasons. Then he ends up in a relationship with B'Elanna until the end of the series. It's actually Harry Kim who ends up as the Kirk, despite having a girlfriend at home. He has slept with or fallen in love with several crew mates, Seven of Nine, a number of aliens, and even a hologram.
-   _Supernatural_:
    -   Dean. As mentioned elsewhere on the wiki, he's such a slut that his actor has joked that the character whores himself out. And yet he's probably the only one on this list to, in his own words, have been "re-hymenized" having come Back from the Dead.
    -   Castiel, of all people, in the Bad Future episode "The End".
    -   Or even further, in Season 11, Chuck AKA God, implies that he's had a few girlfriends. And a few boyfriends.
-   Laurie Forman from _That '70s Show_.
    
    **Hyde:** _\[to Kelso\]_ You call that "Going where no man has gone before?" That's going where _every_ man has gone before!
    
-   _Tidelands (Netflix)_: Tidelanders are pretty promiscuous as a rule, with the L'Attente denizens often shown having sex together, including in groups. Free love is part of their commune's way. They can't get pregnant usually, so there are less potential consequences.
-   _The Great_: During the three seasons Catherine certainly lives up to her sexually promiscuous reputation. In the first two seasons only having sex with Peter and Leo. While in season 3 she has sex with many men including the American Ambassador, a Russian court astronomer, and an opera tenor.
-   "TrueDetective" In Season 4 titled "Night Country" Detective Liz Danvers played by Jodie Foster is revealed to be hated by the women of Ennis, Alaska for sleeping with many of their husbands. She's also had a sexual relationship with her police chief boss and keeps a Tinder account to use for hookups when she gets lonely during the cold months in Alaska.
-   Twin Peaks: One of the major plot points is figuring out how many men Laura Palmer has been with, as any one of them could be a suspect. Its later revealed she worked in a brothel but in her personal life she was mostly loyal to her boyfriend.
-   _Two Sentence Horror Stories_: In "Crush" we learn how during her youth Mabel was apparently pretty promiscuous, something that embarrassed her sister Jane as a result.
-   _Vagrant Queen_: Amae is introduced right after having casual sex with a woman in her shop, and seems to have lovers all over the place. She's also later shown casually picking up another woman after the briefest conversation.
-   Caroline Forbes on _The Vampire Diaries_. She's dated most of the main men. She dated Matt and Tyler, She married Stefan. She was engaged to Alaric but that was for convenience. She slept with Klaus in the woods once. Her daughter Lizzie on _Legacies_ is implied to be like this too.
-   Lily Kane from _Veronica Mars_ was known to have been in overlapping sexual relationships with at least three men in the months leading up to her murder. All three are suspects.
-   _Vida_:
    -   Lyn has casual sex pretty frequently, with the second season also revealing that she even regularly attends orgies (though this stops in the episode we see, as she's grown tired of it).
    -   Emma does this too, but to a lesser degree, with her number of sexual partners in the show being more limited.
-   _War of the Worlds (2019)_: Chloe was apparently quite promiscuous as a teenager. She wasn't even sure who her son's birth father was at first, but realized due to his eyes he'd been the result of her brother's rape, not any of the boys she had consensual sex with.
-   Lauren, Tina, & Vince from _What I Like About You_. The expected Double Standard is inverted, though; Lauren & Tina's... openness... is played mostly for laughs, whereas Vince's is a major source of Wangst for Holly.
-   _Why Women Kill_: Eli, Taylor and Jade are all into polyamory, so they have larger numbers of sex partners than most people. Jade though seems to have more than either, especially threesomes (which only she had more than one of).
-   _The Wilds_: Fatin's promiscuity is brought up a lot, mostly by Leah. Flashbacks reveal Fatin had casual sex with guys quite frequently, one simply being credited as "Latest Conquest". She also had at least one threeway with two guys.
-   Lindsay in _You're the Worst_ was this before getting married. She apparently blew 4 guys at her high school reunion. Then she cheated on her husband a few times, saying she still wants to sit on everyone's face.

    Music 

-   Dance with Asmodeus (also known as "The Madness of Duke Venomania", "The Lunacy of Duke Venomania", etc.) from the The Seven Deadly Sins Series (part of Evillious Chronicles by mothy) is about an evil aristocrat who uses his magical powers to seduce women and make them his sex slaves. His countless sexual escapades are responsible for several disappearances, and the censored portions of the missing persons lists in the music video imply he's not above targetting children. His promiscuity is also his undoing: a man sent to investigate the disappearances (who is also the lover of one of the women he seduced) disguises himself as a woman to get close to him and fatally stabs him. As he bleeds out, all the women he enthralled are released from his spell, and they all leave him.
-   _Flower of the Plateau_, in which Mikulia used to be a prostitute.
-   Many musicians like to have this image. Bob Marley, while not advertising it, fathered several illegitimate children around the world.
    -   According to several sources and Mick Jagger himself, the late Brian Jones was this too, fathering several illegitimate children before his 1969 drowning death (at the age of 27).
-   Sophie Tucker - onstage and off - made no bones about the fact that she enjoyed it with lots of men. Pretty daring stuff for the 1930's.
-   The heroine of The Saga of Jenny couldn't say "No" in 37 languages. Bright as a penny, yes, but...she really ought to stop making her mind up.
-   The backstory for the supergroup the Traveling Wilburys explains that the group is made up of half-brothers, all sons of Charles Truscott Wilbury and different mothers. With ten canonical Wilbury brothers, Charles Sr. is this trope.
-   Mary Hill, the central figure behind the 1969 Billy Joe Royal hit "Cherry Hill Park". She "sure was fun down at Cherry Hill Park, playin' games with everyone 'til way after dark".
-   The "black gal that has had a go at all the world" according to the translation of this Literal Music Video qualifies for this, and possibly for Extreme Omnisexual if some of the other lyrics have been translated properly.
-   The cheating wife from the Vicki Lawrence song "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia". She cheated on her husband with at least 2 people, "Andy" and "that Amos boy, Seth", and it was implied there were more. In the Reba McEntire cover of the song, the Judge is implicated as another lover, explaining why he basically had the husband lynched in a "Make-Believe Trial" before getting all the facts.
-   Murdoc of Gorillaz is notorious for this. 2D also at least went through a wild phase between the first and second albums, and now has ten illegitimate children.
-   Cheryl Ladd's song "Just Another Lover Tonight" describes the guy she's hot for.
-   The "Southern belle" in Little Feat's "Dixie Chicken".
-   The Capitol Steps made light of Bill Clinton's sexual romps in such song parodies as "Unzippin' My Doo-Dah," "My Pants Go Down," "Ol' Man Zipper" and "Livin' Libido Loco."
-   In the song _To Keep My Love Alive_, at least three husbands, Sir George, Sir Frank, and Sir Peter, displeased the Black Widow narrator by doing this.
-   The protagonist of Billy Joel's "The Entertainer" has "played all kinds of palaces and laid all kinds of girls.".
-   The narrator of Joni Mitchell's "Just Like This Train" is a dysfunctional version of this, dealing with what appears to have been a bitter breakup by going on an out-of-control sex spree to the point where she doesn't appear to even enjoy it any more and treats it as a mechanical exercise.
-   The Evelyn Evelyn song "Have You Seen My My Sister Evelyn?" revolves around one of the twins looking for the other twin, who apparently knows a lot of guys:
    
    _Where, oh, where'd by sister Evelyn go?  
    Is she with the doctor, or the plumber, or the dentist, or the handyman?  
    Did she go to India, or Africa, or Wichita, or Pakistan?  
    Did she go and join the navy?  
    Or go completely crazy?  
    Or is she playing a trick on me?  
    Did she run off with the barber, the professor, or the banker, or the clergyman?_
    
-   The protagonist of "40 Boys in 40 Nights" by The Donnas is "spendin' every night with a different date.".
-   "The Groupie Song" by Barry Cryer and Ronnie Golden is about a woman who has apparently slept with _every_ rock star of the 20th century ... almost:

    Podcasts 

-   _Mission to Zyxx_ features Dar, who has a personal goal of having sex with one member of every species they encounter. Their list of partners is already in the hundreds when the show starts and keeps getting longer.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   The backstory to the Dudley family of wrestlers: patriarch Big Daddy Dudley was a traveling salesman who really got around. All 12 Dudleys have him as a father, but all are from different mothers.
-   Stephanie McMahon, circa 2000-2002; when "married" to Triple H, it was insinuated (and sometimes outright said, with expected denial) that, as a way to rebel, she had relations with all men employed by WWE not named Pat Patterson or McMahon (though in Vince's case, it wasn't for lack of trying). Even kept it up when she reconciled with him, and really ramped it up when Triple H was injured and the InVasion began. Seemed to put it behind her when she became General Manager of _SmackDown_; however, humiliation by her father coupled with him forcing her to resign sent her into a relapse. Stephanie's promiscuous ways caught up with her in 2006, and she got pregnant with what turned out to be Triple H's child. This apparently sparked a reconciliation between the two. (In reality, though, Stephanie actually _was_ pregnant in real life and this was simply a way to acknowledge their actual off-screen marriage.)
    -   Chris Jericho infamously called her a "filthy, dirty, disgusting, nasty, skanky, brutal bottom-feeding trashbag ho!" He later "apologized", not to Stephanie, but to all the "filthy, dirty, disgusting, nasty, skanky, brutal bottom-feeding trashbag hos" out there for even comparing them to Stephanie McMahon. He then suggested that "bargain basement slut" and "miserable slimeball pig" were more appropriate.
        -   Trish Stratus turned heel on Jericho, costing him his match with Christian at _WrestleMania XX_ on March 14, 2004. Two weeks later, on the March 29th _Raw,_ Trish was the guest on Jericho's "The Highlight Reel", where he recycled the "filthy, dirty, disgusting..." line (though leaving out "nasty, skanky") on her, sending her running from the ring.
-   When Jerry Springer appeared on an episode of _Monday Night RAW_, Kelly Kelly tricked him into thinking she had slept with Santino Marella, Jerry Lawler, Michael Cole, _and_ Chris Masters. Oh, and Hornswoggle.
-   But the grand prize has to go to Vince McMahon himself. In the summer of 2007, he was slapped with a paternity suit on behalf of a woman whose identity was never revealed. It came out that he had fathered an illegitimate son, and for whatever reason neither the woman nor her attorney were coming forward to tell him exactly who this was. This drove Vince and his assistant Jonathan Coachman to desperately try to figure out who the woman was — a near-impossible feat, since Vince reluctantly revealed that he had engaged in his first sexual encounter when he was _twelve_, and since that time had had relations with hundreds (if not thousands!) of women the world over, in various bizarre locations. As the weeks wore on, the task became much easier as it was revealed that Vince's bastard son was a WWE Superstar, which narrowed the field down to about five or six dozen individuals. Batista, Mr. Kennedy, and even The Boogeyman were all prominently put forward as candidates. (Snitsky set the record straight from the beginning, pointing out that _his_ parents had been killed in an accident when he was a child.) It wasn't until the summer was nearly over that the world finally learned the truth: the mysterious offspring was Hornswoggle, the "leprechaun" companion to the Irish wrestler Finlay! Triple H (who, being married to Stephanie McMahon, was Hornswoggle's half-brother-in-law) thought this was hilarious, and drove Vince to distraction with his endless jokes about his having impregnated a midget. ("Was she magically delicious?") Enraged at first, Vince gradually warmed up to the idea of having Hornswoggle as a son, even booking him in high-profile matches. But then, early in 2008, WWE's resident bully, John "Bradshaw" Layfield, launched an unprovoked attack on Hornswoggle. When asked to account for himself, JBL explained that Hornswoggle was actually Finlay's son rather than Mr. McMahon's! It had all been an elaborate, eight-month-long prank perpetuated by Finlay and Hornswoggle!
    -   This whole storyline was a clumsy Author's Saving Throw. Vince's limo had "exploded," with him in it, at the end of the June 11 _Raw,_ which had been, of course, "Vince McMahon Appreciation Night." The planned "funeral" angle had to be abandoned due to the Chris Benoit tragedy. It was supposed to end with Mr Kennedy being Vince's son, but he got suspended the week of the advertised finale.
    -   Try to wrap your head around how many of WWE's roster at the time needed to not know their father in order for this storyline to work.
-   CM Punk, in real life, is said to be this.
    -   However, while feuding with Raven in Major League Wrestling in 2003, he cut a promo where he said that Straight Edge also means "no promiscuous sex," thus contrasting himself with the notoriously Sex Drugs and Wrestling\-addled Raven. He also mentioned the same as to why he couldn't be a candidate for Vince's son in the above.
    -   It's not that he's slept with a lot of women, it's just that he's had a lot of relationships with women, never actual one-night stands. Though, considering that those relationships inevitably hit third base considering him, this trope still applies. The fact that this has never played a major part of his character<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  is astonishing. That said, fans at Ring of Honor events have mocked him with chants of "CM Pussy" and "CM Hump".
-   Missy Hyatt. Guys she's slept with include Eddie Gilbert (who she married), Jake "The Snake" Roberts, John Tatum, Tommy Rich, Dr. Tom Prichard, Brutus Beefcake, Road Warrior Hawk, and Val Venis. And that's just for starters!
-   Kelly Kelly, according to John Morrison and The Miz on a late 2008 episode of _The Dirt Sheet_, referring to the many men she hangs out with: Mike Knox, CM Punk, The Miz, Balls Mahoney, Kofi Kingston, and Cryme Tyme.
-   At this point, we can now add A.J. Lee into this mix for all the guys she's been with in 2012: Primo Colon, Daniel Bryan, CM Punk, Kane, John Cena and Dolph Ziggler.
-   The news that Amy "Lita" Dumas had cheated on her on-screen and off boyfriend Matt Hardy with Adam "Edge" Copeland in Real Life, breaking up Copeland's second marriage in under five years in the process, turned her heel, with crowds bombarding her with chants of "SLUT! SLUT! SLUT!", flushing away **FIVE YEARS** of the fans loving her, leading to her retirement in 2006. Matt's Real Life self-destruction, and Copeland's retirement in 2011 due to accumulated neck injuries, have contributed to a massive reevaluation and now Dumas and Copeland are both seen in more positive lights than they were at the time, which runs into all kinds of Unfortunate Implications.
-   Among many, many, other things, Steve Corino said as much of Matt Hardy while they were in S.C.U.M. If he is to believed, Matt's gotten a lot more action than "your hero" CM Punk.
-   Batista's autobiography _Batista Unleashed_ refers to beautiful women as his real-life "drug of choice". While most wrestlers would develop addictions to painkillers or alcohol while on the road, Batista became frequently seen with a new female wherever he went.

    Radio 

-   The lovely Samantha of _I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue_, who sits on the chairman's right hand, makes sure the teams score, and is happy to see their points going up.

    Religion and Mythology 

-   Freyja, the goddess of love in the Norse Mythology. In at least two poems in the _Poetic Edda_ she is called out on sleeping around. To receive a necklace, named Brísingamen, she slept with four dwarves for four nights. Loki even accuses her of sleeping with everyone in Ásgarðr, including her own brother. She's not just the goddess of love, but of fertility as well.
    -   Loki himself has his own history. He impregnates a female giant thrice, which results in Fenrir, Jörmungandr and Hel. He gets impregnated by a male horse, which results in Sleipnir. He boasts about committing adultery with Týr's wife and impregnating her. While he has a faithful wife all along. A wife so faithful that after all his promiscuity she will stand by his side until Ragnarök, holding a bowl over him to gather the venom of an adder hung over his bound body, thus sparing him the torture.
-   While we're on the subject of gods, Zeus. Just Zeus. Much to the rage of his wife Hera, and much to the misfortune of whomever he slept with (especially when you consider that not all of those trysts were consensual) _and_ their demigod children.
    -   This was the basis for the 400-year setup of an astronomical joke. The planet Jupiter (Jupiter is the Roman name for Zeus) has four large moons, each named after Zeus' lovers. In 2016, the NASA Juno space probe arrived at the planet Jupiter. Juno is the Roman name for Hera, thus sparking jokes that Jupiter/Zeus's wife was coming to confront him and his mistresses.
    -   Most of the Olympians qualify to some degree, for that matter. Hermes, for example, had thirty-five different lovers. Ironically, the goddess of love Aphrodite was relatively prudish, only having ten lovers.
    -   Poseidon was almost as much a seducer as his brother, having many lovers. One story tells how he wooed Demeter (his sister); she tried to reject him and turned herself into a mare to flee, but he turned himself into a stallion and caught her. (This resulted in Demeter giving birth to a foal named named Arion, which grew into a horse that could _talk_. Poseidon held horses to be sacred as a result.) Unlike Hera, Poseidon's wife Amphitrite didn't seem to care about his philandering.
    -   Equally if not even more ironic, Cupid, the god of love, had one wife and was faithful to her. The other Olympian who was completely faithful? Hades, god of the underworld.
        -   The notable exceptions among the twelve major Olympians were virgin goddesses Hestia, Artemis and Athena, and of course Hera, goddess of marriage. Notice a pattern?
    -   One of the interpretations of the Ganymede story was that he was stolen from Greece by Zeus and taken to Olympus to be Zeus's \*ahem\* "cup bearer". Notably, Ganymede is one of the few whom Hera didn't torture, but she still hated him.
    -   Some of the pre-Olympian gods also led an active sex life, earth-goddess Gaia, for instance. Gaia even mated with Tarterus itself in order to bear Typheus, her most powerful offspring. (Which meant, more or less, that Typheus was the offspring of the Earth and Hell.)
-   Hercules once slept with (depending on the version) between 12 and 50 king's daughters in one night at the daring of Hippolyta to get her belt, since she told him that she'd only give it to him if he slept with/impregnated all these different women. She thought this would take him ages, giving her time to seduce one of his friends that he'd brought with him. She was beyond flabbergasted, not to mention annoyed, when he slept with them all in one night. No wonder this is sometimes called his Thirteenth Labor, especially since every single one of them got knocked up that night.
    -   There's another legend that he was staying with a king who had (again, Depending on the Writer) 50 or 100 daughters. He realized that he couldn't find a better father for his grandchildren than Hercules, and, well, same basic story as the above.
    -   That is on top of the many women (and men) he slept with individually. There was a reason his third wife was concerned about his wandering eye.
-   King Solomon is credited with 700 wives and 300 concubines.
-   Irish Mythology, specifically the _Ulster Cycle_:
    -   Cù Chulainn, the champion of Ulster and son of the god Lugh. Slept with dozens of women even _after_ he fell head-over-heels for Emer, who didn't mind as long as it was merely physical. The one time it looked like it wasn't, she verbally beat _both_ into submission. Surprisingly, despite his philandering, only his coupling with Aoife produced a child, a son named Connla.
    -   Medb/Maeve, queen of Connacht. The saying goes that she never had a man without another waiting to be next, and one of her conditions for marriage was that her husband could not be susceptible to jealousy, though this naturally proved easier said than done. She also tended to offer "the friendship of her thighs" whenever trying to make a deal, and a few agreements went through on that offer alone. Ironically, Cù Chulainn was one of the few to turn her down, largely because they were mortal enemies at the time.
-   In Arthurian Legend, one of the few consistent facets of Sir Gawain's character seems to be that, as "The Knight of Maidens", women like him and he likes women... a lot. Though whether he’s The Casanova, a Handsome Lech, or a Chivalrous Pervert is, as is a lot of Arthurian legend, highly subject to Alternate Character Interpretation. While most knights have one or a select few love interests they are associated with, he has been associated with almost _30_ (granted, this is over many centuries of material that usually aren’t canon to each other, but still), and after a while it even starts being mentioned that he has this reputation in-universe, and “Gawain’s Wedding” also mentions that he’s been married several times, possibly in an attempt at Canon Welding. The fact that his character may have been partially inspired by Cù Chulainn is probably a coincidence, however.
-   In Hindu Mythology, Krishna had eight principle wives, and then 16,000 (or 16,100) "junior wives." They had been captured by a demon and were considered Defiled Forever, so he married them all to retain their dignity. They're not sexless marriages, though—-he duplicates himself to sleep with all of them each night.
-   The Jerusalem Talmud mention Orpah, the sister-in-law of Ruth, who allowed herself to be "threshed" by many men as one would thresh wheat. As a result, she was the mother of the four Philistine giants, one of them being Goliath.

    Tabletop RPG 

-   In the _Dungeons & Dragons Mystara_ setting, the Immortal (Immortals being D&D's equivalent of AD&D's gods) Valerias. When you are so old that no one, including yourself and your fellow Immortals, remembers a time when you did not exist in your current form, and when you are at the same time eternally youthful and unchanging, fidelity is inevitably going to be more of a challenge than for ordinary mortals. Especially when you are the Immortal of love, passion, and ill-considered affairs.
    -   The Demon Lord Graz'zt is notorious for being a lustful rake. Most of his demonic servants are female (including marilith and succubi). His numerous affairs with mortals and other demons have caused him to sire numerous offspring, the most infamous being Iuz the Old, an evil demigod who rules a dark empire on Oerth.
    -   Another example is Malcanthet. She _is_ the patron of succubi, but she has even counted Demogorgon among her former lovers (a hideous, two-headed abomination) suggesting her standards aren't very high. Ironically, the one male she has outright rejected is Graz'zt, and they utterly despise each other (each of them giving a conflicting story as to why).
    -   On the other end of the Lower Planes, both Belial and his daughter Fierna, the co-rulers of the Fourth Hell of Phlegethos, are the same. (Both are embodiments of Lust, after all.) They are even rumored to have an incestuous relationship. It's also known that Fierna has a special wing in the prison of her palace reserved especially for her former lovers, and it tends to grow at a rather fast rate. (Her current paramours can clearly see what happened to their predecessors, but they never seem to get the hint.)
    -   It's heavily implied in a few sourcebooks including the illustratively-named Book of Erotic Fantasy<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  that _being this trope_ is humanity's hat, which explains all the half-human, half-whatevers.
    -   Tiamat, the goddess of the evil chromatic dragons. She has traditionally had five consorts. each a male Great Wyrm of a different color. Starting with 4th edition she has quite a few concubines as well (both male and female) including some metallic dragons and dragonspawn.
-   According to the _Exalted_ boxed supplement _Dreams of the First Age_, Ma-Ha-Suchi was like this when he was young. Now, however, he is quite different.
    -   In second edition Exalted, characters have a statline called Motivation, that being the character's ultimate goal with his life (which in the case of Exalted, is 2-3 millennia, longer in some cases). Ma-Ha-Suchi's Motivation in the First Age was to sleep with every Exalt alive. Barring a few deliberate holdouts, he almost _succeeded_ too. I mean, just LOOK at him. That's official art there, folks. If you went from looking like that to being a mutated satyr-werewolf-thing, you'd be angry at the world too!
    -   Lunars in general have a tendency towards this — they were created as companions to the Solars, and when the Solars were all killed and their Exaltations rounded up after the Usurpation, they had to have _something_ to do. It didn't help that one of their innate abilities was the power to breed Beastmen... the old-fashioned way.
-   _All_ of the gods in _Scion_ — their children, after all, are the player characters. There are some exceptions: Athena (a perpetual virgin), Artemis (perpetual virgin in myth, lesbian in 1e), and Osiris (who has no genitals). They adopt.
    -   _Companion_ adds another to the "only adopts" list: Uncle Sam (he emerged from the Puritan mindset and finds the idea of mass-siring uncomfortable).

-   In _Company_, Robert is fooling around with three attractive women and has had many other girlfriends.
-   In Mozart's opera, _Don Giovanni_, Leporello has a catalogue of the women Don Giovanni has slept with:
    
    In Italy, six hundred and forty;  
    In Germany, two hundred and thirty-one;  
    A hundred in France; in Turkey, ninety-one;  
    In Spain already one thousand and three.
    
-   _A Little Night Music_ explores the practicalities of this mindset for women in the early twentieth century.
    -   Petra _bursts out laughing_ when Anne asks her if she's a virgin, and is a shameless flirt. Her big song, "The Miller's Son" has her reflect on her future, and the type of man she could end up marrying. She imagines she'll end up with someone nice who can provide for her, and seems to look forward to it—but in the meantime, she's going to have as much fun as she wants, with whoever she wants. After all, you're only young once, and once you're married, you have to either stick to one guy, or be sneaky about your other relationships.

    -   Madame Armfeldt's daughter, Desiree, is an actress who has had many lovers and one great love of her life. She's wary to get too close to any man who might be too controlling, and has no shame about her lifestyle, but is happy to settle down into monogamy with the man she really loves, once he gets his head out of his ass and asks her. Interestingly, Madame Armfeldt shames her daughter not for her promiscuity, but because she's not calculating enough about it; Desiree sleeps around mostly for the fun of it, while her mother thinks a woman should use her sexuality to control men and give herself some security.
    -   Madame Armfeldt herself was a courtesan in her youth, having become rich off a long line of powerful and wealthy lovers. She's very open about this and encourages her daughter and granddaughter alike to take the same path, as it's made her _very_ comfortable in her old age. Though, in a reflective moment, she admits the money maybe wasn't worth missing out on true love. Her song "Liaisons" is her reminiscing on her most impressive lovers, and fretting that sex has become about "mere desire" for so many people, rather than a tool.
-   In _Me and My Dick_, Tiffany is such a slut that _her own vagina yells at her_. Then again, she is the Old Snatch.
-   Ado Annie from the musical _Oklahoma!!_ has a song called "I Cain't Say No" although she's only linked for sure with two men.
    
    It ain't so much a question of not knowin' what to do  
    I knowed what's right and wrong since I been ten  
    I heared a lot of stories —and I reckon they're true—  
    About how girls are put upon by men.  
    I know I mustn't fall into the pit,  
    But when I'm with a feller...  
    I fergit!
    

    Video Games 

-   This is possible for Michael Thornton in _Alpha Protocol_; you can sleep with Madison St. James, Scarlet Lake, SIE and Mina Tang — seemingly without consequences for the relationship he ends up having apart from Mina asking where he has the scratches on the back of his neck, which he lies about, saying that he got into a fight.
-   _Assassin's Creed_: Ezio Auditore never passes up an opportunity despite apparently only really being in love with Christina, whose room he sneaks into in the middle of the night in the beginning of AC2 , and who he has flashbacks of in Brotherhood. His brother calls him on it in AC2 asking if he's wasted everything on women and wine when Ezio says he has no money and Ezio only replies that he hardly considers it wasted. A short while later _his own mother calls him on it_ when she says he needs to find a creative outlet "Besides vaginas." Later, in Brotherhood, he flirts with a Monterrigioni woman within two seconds of meeting her, has a "political" roll in the hay with Catarina Sforza whom he'd flirted briefly with in the previous game and, when he can inexplicably speak French later in the game and is asked about it, smirkingly replies "There were a couple of French girls in Firenze." Which makes it oddly hypocritical when he gets angry with his sister, to the point of not speaking with her if he can help it for much of the game, when she takes up management of a brothel. Even in Revelations, despite being in his 50's, he continues his lecherous ways with as much gusto as when he was in his twenties. Word of God has even stated that even though he eventually (in his early-mid 50's to be exact) settles down and starts a family with Sofia Sartor (a woman nearly 20 years younger than him) Ezio has likely fathered many illegitimate children in his lifetime,
    
    -   The Funny Moment page for Revelations puts it best;
    
    **Ezio:** When I was your age my interests were... (distracted by a beautiful woman) were mainly... Salve. (hello)
    
    **Suleiman I:** Incredible. I am surprised you got anything done.
    
    **Ezio:** As was my mother.
    
-   It is possible to get through _A Dance with Rogues_ without having sex with more than one person, but it is extremely difficult.
-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   _Dragon Age: Origins_: Zevran doesn't even try to hide how much of a slut he is. You even unlock the "Easy Lover" achievement by bedding him (which is, you guessed it, very easy).
    -   _Dragon Age II_: Isabela, to the point that her promiscuity is a Running Gag.
        
        **Isabela:** _"Imagine the awkward questions: 'Mother, what is a slattern?'"_
        
        **Aveline:** _"I'll just point at you and say 'That's a slattern'."_
        
    -   The Iron Bull from _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ is canonically pansexual and willing to sleep with anyone who's interested that he is sure will not break. Whether he is also panromantic or not is unknown since the Qunari possibly view romance differently.
-   Rita from _Dark Seed II_. She was involved with practically every man in town... except Mike Dawson, the protagonist (and the one person who constantly refers to Rita as his girlfriend.)
-   _The Elder Scrolls_
    -   In a race-wide example, the Bosmer (Wood Elves) are known as the most amorous race in Tamriel. As a result, they are also the most populous race of Mer (Elves) in Tamriel.
    -   In the series' backstory, Barenziah, the future Queen of Morrowind, was the last surviving member of her noble Dunmeri family after Tiber Septim's Imperial Legions sacked Mournhold. Septim's Dunmeri General, Symmachus, convinced Septim to spare Barenziah and had her secretly placed into the foster care of the Count and Countess of Darkmoor (Imperial loyalists) until she would old enough to take the throne in Morrowind as a legitimate vassal ruler for the Empire. She would, of course, escape her foster family and went on various adventures in her teenage years. Notably, she spent some time as The Artful Dodger in the Thieves' Guild and engaged in The Oldest Profession. According to her _unofficial_ biography, _The Real Barenziah_, her reputation for promiscuity was well founded. She slept with everyone from from stable boys to thieves to lesser royalty of all sorts to Emperor Tiber Septim himself. Of course, this was nearly all covered up in the _official_ histories...
-   _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_:
    -   Sylvain _wants_ to be this. In an earlygame confession note, he expresses worry about bringing a girl back to his room out of fear from getting a scolding from Dimitri (his friend and next-door neighbor), and one of Byleth's responses can imply that Sylvain keeps them up, as their room is directly under his. In the Japanese version, an annoyed Felix calls Sylvain a "sex demon," changed to "insatiable" in the English version.
    -   Professor Manuela is also implied to have drunken, one-night stands a lot (one of her Lost Items is even a hangover cure), and one of her supports with Byleth is passing on a message from a knight that he doesn't want to see her anymore. Manuela frequently angsts about being an Old Maid and her frequent dating is implied to be to try and find someone to settle down with.
    -   Like her mentor, Dorothea is implied to have used her good looks and clout as an opera singer to "butter up" some nobles into getting her into Garreg Mach and Byleth catches her flirting with various soldiers in hopes of finding someone she can marry once she leaves the Monastery. Coincidentally, Dorothea has the most romantic supports out of all the students to reflect this goal.
    -   Hilda uses her cute looks and charm into suckering people (mostly men) into doing things for her, and she is one of the very few characters who is strongly implied to have had sex before an S-support, as she attempts to get an oblivious Caspar alone in her room with her.
-   Michael's wife Amanda in _Grand Theft Auto V_ was a former stripper who shares an open relationship with him at the start of the game, and sleeps with every guy in town while berating him for doing the same.
-   _I Was a Teenage Exocolonist_: Two of Sol's potential partners, Rex and Marz, grow from sexually adventurous to sexually adventurous adults. If Sol starts dating them during the game, the relationship either doesn't last or become more of a lifelong on-and-off thing. Both are also mentioned to never be exclusive with their lovers.
-   While it is uncertain how many of them she actually slept with, Nikki of _Mana Khemia: Alchemists of Al-Revis_ ends up dating and dumping a surprisingly large percentage of the school's male population. It gets to the point where you have to create an anti-Love Potion in order to ensure that all those boys stay dumped.
-   _Mass Effect 2_: Yeoman Kelly Chambers falls probably under the trope, given that she will express during her dialogues an interest in hugging Thane, Garrus, Tali (more accurately, quarians in general), Kasumi and, of course, Sheps of both sexes. The only people she doesn't want to know better are Grunt, Zaeed and Mordin. Oh, and she owns an asari dancer dress. The game kind of acknowledeges this: you don't get an achievement when you seduce her, and flirting with her is never a big deal for other romanceable characters.
    -   Some of the side dialogue with Mordin reveals that somehow, an STD only carried by Varren has found its way onto the Normandy. The fandom has a fairly good idea how, though....
    -   And of course, one can play Shepard like this. From having sex with the asari Consort and proposing a threesome with Liara and Ashley/Kaidan (depending on gender) in the first game, to romancing all three of your gender's available romance options, plus Kelly, and suggesting casual sex with Samara in the second game, to picking a romance of your choice, sleeping with Kelly again, and also sleeping with Diana Allers in the third game, not to mention that a female Shepard can have sex with either James or Javik in the Citadel DLC....
-   In his profile on the official _Mortal Kombat_ comic and instruction manual for the first game, Goro is stated to be a polygamist, having seven wives. Fans often assume that Sheeva is one of them, but this has not been proven.
-   In _Persona 3_, _Persona 4_ and _Persona 5_, you can sleep with almost _all_ female social links/confidants. In fact, you can date more than one at a time. In _Persona 3_, you have no choice but to be promiscuous as female social links are romantic by default. You are given the choice to be promiscuous in 4 and 5, but _Persona 4: Golden_ (not original) and _5_ will make you regret it.
    -   _Persona 4: The Animation_ seems to run with Yu Narukami (the P4 Protagonist) being this, as Margaret tells his cousin Nanako Yu is a "manwhore". Although it's subverted as the only girl he was romantically involved with was Marie.
    -   The same applies to the Female Protagonist in _Persona 3: Portable_ with male social links... although you automatically will reject Elizabeth since you're both girls.
-   Ditto from the Mon franchise _Pokémon_ are frequently used for breeding, due to their Transforming abilities letting them breed with almost any non-legendary or non-baby. Whether they are really O.K. with this or not is never really questioned.
-   Shaundi in _Saints Row 2_ is the Saints most useful member, since anything the gang needs can be easily obtained simply by calling up one of the hundreds of guys she's banged. It's legitimately surprising to the gang when none of her ex-boyfriends can give them information about the Ultor Pyramid.
    -   Her promiscuity is downplayed somewhat in _Saints Row: The Third_, since it takes place in a different city that Shaundi has only ever visited once (thus she only has _one_ ex-boyfriend that she can call, who provides the Saints a place to crash). She's also dropped the heavy drug use and has a much more serious personality because she wants to avenge Johnny's death. However, in the time between games, she's become the star of the reality show _I Wanna Sleep With Shaundi_, so she still Really Gets Around, they just don't show it in-game. The show is actually the reason she quit drugs. It takes up so much of her time that she can't get a spare minute to smoke anything.
-   In _The Sims 2_, Romance sims have wants revolving around falling in love and "doing WooHoo" with as many other sims as possible. When Lifetime Aspirations were introduced, Romance sims could have lifelong goals such as "have twenty lovers at the same time" and "do WooHoo with fifty different sims". Pleasure sims, introduced in Night Life, also have shades of this with the "fifty First Dates" goal. There are also Self Imposed Challenges for the players revolving around the concept, such as the "Who's Your Daddy?" Challenge.
-   In _Stardew Valley_, the player character, if you so choose. It is, in fact, possible to date not only more than one bachelor/bachelorette, but _all 12 of them at the same time_. As of the 1.3 update, you will get in caught and confronted for your infidelity, which will cost you all the heart levels your character has culminated and leave all marriageable characters angry with you for a week.
-   _Sword of Paladin_: Lena has a habit of inviting strangers to sleep with her, only for them to run away when they find her too intense. She even managed to scare off the Pirate King, Captain Eagle. This is also a unique mechanic for her when staying at the inn, since she gains more TP the more satisfying her partner is.
-   _A Very Long Rope to the Top of the Sky_: Yevette, although somewhat exaggerated, as an adult, she has been infamous for casually dating and having sexual relations with a numerous amount of men, earning her the derogatory nickname of "Slut Queen" by her detractors.
-   _The Witcher_:
    -   Geralt characterizes this trope to the point that it's Lampshaded in many encounters and is a part of the legend surrounding him. This is subverted by one townswoman, who is teasing and flirtatious about Geralt's reputation, and then leaves him hanging. Witcher mutations render the subject sterile and immune to disease. It only bites him in the ass in _The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_, as if you try to pursue a romance with both Triss and Yennefer, they both gang up on Geralt, humiliate him and effectively dump him. Oh, and then there's also Keira Metz.
    -   A game mechanic and player bonus that may show Geralt's — or possibly just the creators' and audience's — attitude towards this tendency is showing a little blurry cutscene and a collectible 'character card' when Geralt is with a character for the first time. If he sleeps with her again, the game shows none of this.
    -   In _The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings_, Geralt enlists his friend Dandelion to aid him in tracking down a succubus but - as he's controlled by the player - Dandelion can decide to try ploughing her despite the risks.
    -   In _The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_, Geralt and Zoltan have to divide Dandelion's little black book between them when trying to track him down, as they'd have too many people to deal with otherwise.
    -   Sorceresses have this reputation, but it is only really true, if ever, for the first years of their career. The standard version is: Sorceress, who was probably an ugly girl from a poor family with no prospect of ever finding a partner (which is why she became a sorceress in the first place, instead of finding someone to marry and churn out babies for) realizes she is now beautiful (the Lodge maintains certain standards of appearance, and fixing any physical imperfections is easy enough), powerful, can have any man she wants and doesn't have to worry about diseases or pregnancies, and spends some time boning anything with a pulse. Sooner or later, she comes to the conclusion that men are pigs, has a short lesbian period until she realizes women are just as prone to farting in their sleep and tossing their used underwear around as her male partners, and then settles down and becomes a productive member of the Lodge.

    Visual Novels 

-   Angel Starr in the first _Ace Attorney_ game is in a similar situation. She seems to have at least one boyfriend in every area of the police department (and three in forensics), allowing her to use police resources even after she's been kicked off the force.
-   Pedoe from _Area X_ is this, as he has 43 wives and over 444 children. He tries to make Elcia his 44th wife, and in every route except fr Livan's Bad End, he presumably continues to marry more women and have more children and continue to kill them when they hit thirteen.
-   Kotonoha's classmates from _School Days_ believe that Kotonoha is this because of her popularity with the boys and her large bust. The truth is that she's an Innocent Fanservice Shrinking Violet who will only want Makoto and no other guy. Makoto himself can play this trope horrifically straight depending on the medium or what choices the player makes, and his father is even worse in that regard.

    Webcomics 

-   _Beyond the End_ has Cain, who is cursed to sleep around constantly after falling from grace and immediately getting on Lucifer's bad side. Not sleeping around causes his physical pain. If he tries to sleep with the same person repeatedly, the pain wont subside at all. He's constantly having to run off with random people to keep his curse at bay. He doesn't even like sleeping around; it is just as much mental torture as physical.
-   _BOO! It's Sex_: Tara claims to have had a crazy sex life when she was alive. She knows all sorts of sex positions, has been with men and women, and knows a lot of alternatives to penetrative sex. Denise also hooks up with a number of partners, which causes friction when one of her lovers wants to start an exclusive relationship.
-   _Keychain of Creation_ has Marena:
    
    -   When asked about how many people she'd slept with, Marena answered nine (because she though they meant how many people she had ever slept with _at once_). So they clarified by asking about the total number...
    
    **Marena:** ... Define "people."
    
    -   Even before she was Exalted, her mother evidently encouraged her in this direction. When we meet her Lunar mentor Racer, who's in many ways the masculine version of her (and at the time was traveling with a couple dozen women), it all makes sense.
-   _Girls with Slingshots_
    -   Zach slept with over 300 women prior to his relationship with Hazel. However, he considers it a charitable cause— he gave virgins a good first time and helped the elderly feel loved again. And after their breakup he resumed pursuing this trope.
    -   Angel the bartender is a much less positive example. Thea thought they were in a relationship. Angel thought Thea was just another friend-with-benefits. Thea found this out the hard way. Then she found out Angel didn't use protection with any of her other partners, leading to the STD testing storyline. And Thea has Restless Leg Syndrome for the rest of the comic. It's indicated that Angel herself caught something _far_ nastier.
    -   Darren shows up at the STD Party to dole out his wisdom...
        
        **Darren:** Actually, I get tested every time I have a new partner. My last results came in clean last Thursday.  
        **Hazel:** So why are you getting tested with us tomorrow?  
        **Darren:** Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and some guy I met at a bus stop. HOT.
        
-   Chuy, aka El Chupachabre from _Girly_ is an extremely over the top male example. The guy seduces women as easily as breathing, and occasionally has to fight himself not to bring great loving to the nearest woman, much to his own despair later in the comic (when his character is deepened). With the exception of Winter, he's had practically every girl who's a central character, and one girly-looking guy. He's that good.
    -   Much later in the series, after getting married he discovers that his libido is SO powerful that it's directly tied to his Life Energy, and any long-term attempts to NOT be a gigantic man-slut will result in a painful, wasting death. Fortunately, his wife loves him enough to get a divorce so he can give plenty of guilt-free lovin' to the women of the world. They're still together, very much in love, and she's even adopted some of his behaviors.
-   In the _Ciem Webcomic Series_, Marina has 17 partners offscreen.
-   About half of _Least I Could Do_ is about the main character Rayne, who can and will sleep with any woman he sees and will go to insane lengths to sleep with a beautiful woman<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . It's easy to forget that the whole reason he got his insanely high-paying job was because he wanted to screw the CEO. That said, there is a list of women Rayne can't bed, which includes the comic's female lead Issa (a childhood friend who's not interested) and the wives of his friends.
-   _Magick Chicks_: This applies to Faith, Jacqui, and Anastasia:
-   Blue Deiter, from _Namir Deiter_, claims this as her defining characteristic throughout most of the comic.
-   Ash'waren and Zala'ess from _Drowtales_. Note that among drowolath having many lovers is not considered strange/bad and motherhood and many children is a status symbol (which makes Sarv'swati rendering Quain'tana barren in their fight an injury that goes beyond the physical).
-   A few characters from _Something\*Positive_ could count, though Jason may be the best example; apparently he knows some sort of mathematical formula that tells him the best possible way to seduce women. This eventually ends when he gets into a relationship with (and eventually marries) Aubrey.
-   Maytag of _Flipside_, especially in the earlier chapters, although she begins to restrain her proclivities in order to maintain her relationship with the monogamous Bernadette.
-   Two examples in _The Noordegraaf Files_. The first, typical example is Akila, the comic's resident nymph. While the exact extent to which her promiscuity extends isn't known, it's implied she has slept with at least half of the main cast. Katrina, Akila's Best Friend (and possible lover) is a non - sexual example, getting a new boyfriend every few weeks - but is pretty upset about it. Dating an Action Girl is nice for a while, until you realize that she's much more badass in your imagination than she is in real life.
-   Sabine of _The Order of the Stick_ is a literal incarnation of illicit sex. She's in a steady relationship with Nale, but once mentions that she had sex three times while away from him for a couple of hours. She doesn't seem to understand why he'd be upset by this.
-   Ted from _Greg_. Been with a bevy of women throughout the strip, but his most eye opening act that has been revealed so far, is cheating on a girl by having a threesome with her sister and room mate. It's hinted that he might have slept with her mother on a separate occasion.
-   This tends to show up a lot in _Oglaf_. Some specific examples:
    -   Ivan manages to be a Technical Virgin despite frequently "having sex things done to me" (unwillingly), which causes the magical virgin city of Vanorva to decry him as a slut.
    -   Vanka definitely qualifies, as her usual methods of escaping capture tend to involve sex with captors, guards, random bystanders....
-   Nanase from _El Goonish Shive_ is a non-sexual example of this, dating many of the boys at her school (culminating in dating Elliot) in her search for Mr. Right when she should have been looking for _Ms._
    -   Subverted with Diane, she has a reputation for this but in reality while she has dated a lot of guys she's actually a virgin, all of her exes had been lying about having slept with her. Finding out about her reputation really upsets her.
-   Porrim from _Homestuck_, who joked about the 'revolving doors' of her quadrants, and according to Meenah, she used up the extensive amount of spare time she and her group was gifted with by sleeping with most of her friends.
    -   For a nonsexual variant, Kanaya. One of the quadrants of troll romance, auspisticism, is based around one troll keeping the relationship between two others stable. Kanaya is so eager to do this that Eridan refers to her as "the vvillage twwo wwheel devvice".
-   _Bittersweet Candy Bowl_ has Rachel and Jessica, though the latter is actually an aversion, having slept with only one guy, and then only well after she obtained her reputation as a slut.
-   _Glorianna_ specializes in one-night stands, and heads for the hills (using her quest as an excuse) whenever a relationship starts getting serious.
-   Just about everyone from _Ménage à 3_, with central character Gary being an initial aversion who subsequently becomes more of an Accidental Pornomancer. Stand-outs, even for this series, are Zii, DiDi, and Matt.
-   Jan from _Split Screen_. We first see her in the comic coldly dismissing an one-night stand (who seemed more amused by it than hurt). As we get to know her, it becomes clear that her mercenary approach to her love life is a coping mechanism, dealing with her feelings for The One That Got Away.
-   _Vampire Cheerleaders_: Though Steph initially tried to deny it, she's gotten laid more than a few times:
    
    -   While they were investigating the crash scene at "Inspiration Point" she casually let it slip that she'd been there more than once. She tried to play it off... only to turn around and proudly admit it two scenes later, while chatting with Agent Lisbon.
    
    -   After Stephanie goes missing, in vol.4. her sister and her friends travel across space and time in order to find her. They finally do, right as she's getting it on with a Mothman, while surrounded by others who were waiting their turn.
    
    -   Then it's finally revealed just _how many times_ the Mothmen had knocked her up. Albeit justified, since it was to help them repopulate their Dying Race.
-   _Existential Comics_: Albert Camus picks up multiple women at a time without trying.
-   In the backstory of _Girl Genius_, a young Andronicus Valois read a lot of books describing the king as a fertility icon and thought this was a neat idea. Two hundred-odd years later, and the noble houses of Europa have a very hard time figuring out who the rightful heir to the Storm King is, because if the stories are true, _half the continent_ can claim descent from Andronicus. And then it turns out that the rightful heir to the Lightning Throne is... Andronicus Valois himself. He isn't dead.
-   While most of the adult cast of _Ennui GO!_ engages in casual sex, Izzy still stands out as someone who will sleep with anyone over the age of 18, with it even being implied that she's had at least two threesomes with her twin sister and sister-in-law. In fact, her entire relationship with Tanya started because she decided to randomly pay her $3000 for sex just to prove a point to Noah.
-   _Pixie Trix Comix_ doesn't judge any of the female cast who have highly active sex lives (and several of them do), but Sharon's exploitative attitude toward the many men who fall for her and Serial Homewrecker tendencies make her sexual behavior look like a very bad habit.
-   In _unTouchable_, modern vampires have learned to absorb Life Energy by touch. Protagonist Sia is a virgin and has never even kissed, but had a reputation as the school slut in high school due to using her good looks to charm boys into touching her for feeding purposes.
-   _Unsounded_: Bastion has had sex with most of the Black Tongues including Rham with Iori, a few Senet beasts, Elena, and others as he's quite fond of the act.
-   _xkcd_: In this strip, a character's "scientifically rigorous" lesbian experimentation involved many participants (at least twelve men in one "control" group, and presumably a similar number of women in each "experimental" group). According to the Alt Text, the experimentation encompassed "the entire sophomore class".

-   This<small>◊</small> image of "The Bard", drawn by Fredrick K. T. Anderson.
-   Fabiola Onorata and Laura Pizzo from the series Dina Marino are this. Almost all the stories around them revolve in some way or another around sex.
-   Captain Hammer is amazed that he "just might sleep with the same girl twice." They say you get to do the ''weird'' stuff.
    
    **The Hammer Groupies**: We do the weird stuff!
    
-   Solange from the Whateley Universe. Not only does she sleep with guys to get things out of them (she has enough money on her own), but she has a superpower that makes her seem _unbelievably_ good in the sack. Plus she has used her psychic abilities to pretty much enslave guys while bedding them.
    -   Then there's Sahar, her roommate, who's pretty much a female, bisexual James Bond and Carmilla doesn't even bear mentioning.
-   Agent Lux from _Protectors of the Plot Continuum_ will shag anything that moves and will also consent. She also interprets any sort of nudity as a proposition.
-   The Faleshkarti of Chakona Space, due to their Bizarre Alien Biology consider it imperative to remain almost constantly pregnant and will mate indiscriminately within their species. The story in which they are introduced revolves around trying to find a way to circumvent that aspect of their biology, since they are suffering from massive over-population. There's also Chakats in general, Foxtaurs in General (especially the males under Obligation), Skunktaurs in general, Admiral Kline, his wives, plural on wives, there's five so far... the list goes on. And on, and on....
-   Clio Gabriella of _Survival of the Fittest_; the character's creator explained it was because of abandonment issues; she was once tricked into believing she was in love, and ever since, she has been purposely sabotaging her relationships or picking the worst possible boyfriends to hook up with in order to stop herself from being hurt again.
    -   Rosa Fiametta is also an excellent example, and even comes complete with Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places tendencies. This has also been explained as emotional issues, partly due to seeing herself as The Unfavorite among her siblings.
-   The Nostalgia Critic has this reputation and lives up to it well. But he would much rather be an active player, instead of being thought as a slut with a freakish sex life.
    -   Another Doug Walker character, Donnie DuPre, verges on this as well. An entire episode is spent on him forgetting he's married and he has No Sense of Personal Space around anyone he remotely likes. The fact that he's incredibly lonely and estranged from his wife already probably has something to do with it.
    -   Ask That Guy with the Glasses has boasted that he'll go down on anyone and anything.
-   Claudia the Invisible Woman from SCP Foundation has an impressively healthy sex life despite, or possibly _because of_, being permanently invisible. So much so that Dr. Rights had to tell off the male personnel because she kept sleeping with them and then stealing their stuff.
-   The college spring breaker in "Twisted Tales 1" by DeviantArtist Toonexterminator. The drawing shows her after picking the wrong guy to have fun with. (He fell in love with her. And he turned out to be a shapeshifting merman who could give her a fin of her own. And did so without asking.)
-   It's only barely an exaggeration to say almost everyone in _Kakos Industries_ has an incredibly efficient sex life and have little shame in the matter. Even The Narrator of the show isn't afraid to have sex in his office with an employee's daughter. Twice.
-   In Sam & Mickey's videos, Barbie has apparently had sex with everyone in Malibu.

    Western Animation 

-   _Æon Flux_:
    -   The first talkie episode climaxes (ahem) with the revelation that nearly everyone (and we mean _everyone_) in the city of Bregnia has a key to Aeon's chastity belt.
    -   Although, her rival Trevor is really no better. Aside from Aeon herself his lovers have included (it seems) the reporters who interview him, one of his patients, bird creatures, the Demiurge, and in the last episode, an alien who is actually an evolved human (according to him).
-   Francine from _American Dad!_ was like this before marrying Stan. She owns the largest "sex garden" in the world, containing a bush to represent every man she'd had sex with. It's said that the garden is so big, there live a lost Native American tribe that has not seen a white man. She even confessed to cheating on Stan the day before she married him, which may or may not have led to Hayley.
-   _Archer_:
    -   Archer has slept with tons of women over the years that he makes James Bond's appetite for sex look tame.
    -   At least half the cast of the show fits under this trope, with special mentions for Cheryl/Carol and Pam. Pam in particular has slept with every main cast member except for Cheryl/Carol and Ray.
-   Cleopatra of _Clone High_ often tells her _boyfriend_ Abe about her various sexual exploits with other men, while he simply has to wait for a kiss. She hosts an "open mouth kissing booth" with a lineup about a football field long, and even tries to get into Joan of Arc's pants when she thinks Joan is a guy, seemingly not being too put off when she found out the truth.
-   Odd Della Robbia of _Code Lyoko_ has dated every girl in his grade who isn't Aelita or Sissi and some outside it and once had to break up with 2 girls at once (Ulrich wasn't surprised about one of the break ups; he _was_ surprised that there were 2). Eventually came back to bite him when he couldn't get a date to save his life.
-   On _Daria,_ Quinn and the rest of the Fashion Club are a non-sexual example—they date just about any popular/attractive boy in school, but Quinn in particular seems to have a Paralyzing Fear of Sexuality (she won't slow-dance with a guy until the fifth date).
    -   Brittany and Kevin are implied to have fooled around on each other a lot over the years, usually with other football players/cheerleaders. There's also Slutty Girl, a One-Scene Wonder who's implied to be this. (Her claim to fame is apparently taking Kevin's virginity.)
    -   Daria's Aunt Rita isn't necessarily "slutty," but she does apparently have poor taste in men and thus winds up with a strong turnover rate on boyfriends.
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   Quagmire's defining trait is to sleep with as many women as he can, as often as he can. This actually turns out to be a Freudian Excuse for messing up his chances with the one that got away. There's one episode in which the gang is playing "I Never," and Quagmire drinks to _literally everything_ that's said. After the first few (comparatively believable) lines, the scene fades to show dozens of empties in front of Quagmire while the others are still on their first beer and trying (unsuccessfully) to think of something sexual that Glenn won't have to drink to.
        
        **Peter:** Geez, what else _is_ there? I never gave a reach-around to a spider monkey while reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.  
        **Quagmire:** Aw, God! _\[drinks\]_  
        **Joe:** I never picked up an illegal alien at Home Depot to take home and choke me while I touched myself.  
        **Quagmire:** Oh, _come on_! _\[drinks\]_  
        **Peter:** I never did the same thing, but with someone from JoAnn Fabrics.  
        **Quagmire:** Oh God, this is ridiculous! _\[drinks and passes out\]_  
        
    -   Lois was apparently like this before meeting Peter (even after). A few of the people she's mentioned or has otherwise been shown with include Gene Simmons from KISS, Hall (but not Oates) from _Hall & Oates_, and Bill Clinton (whose own sexual promiscuity was sufficient to bed even Peter himself, much to his admittance of how good he is). She also did a pornographic film in the '80s, and her sluttiness gets called out by Meg when she delivers an epic "The Reason You Suck" Speech to her whole family. In "Into Harmony's Way", Lois was seen cheating on Peter and getting away with it while he was on the road with Quagmire.
    -   Meg seems to have become this. She has been shown to practically throw herself at anybody who's willing (and even those who are less than willing), and her parents are aware of this. Peter once flat out said he doesn't care when Jerome confessed to having "all sorts of nasty sex with Meg". Not to mention all the recent jokes about her having frequent abortions, and she's even been seen with a baby trapped in her locker.
    -   Brian has had several one-off girlfriends throughout the series, though he ultimately wanted to avoid this. He wanted to find "the one", but always screwed up in one way or another.
    -   Brian hypothesized that Connie D'Amico is, which is also strongly implied when she admits to having dated every popular guy at James Woods High School.
-   Amy Wong from _Futurama_, at least until she gets together with Kif. (Not only was she open to dating non-humans, but in some episodes, dated creatures that weren't even _humanoid_.) She still brags about her "general sluttiness" though.
    -   Bender out-does Amy, having hit on, if not slept with, just about every female robot he encounters. Naturally, they had a brief relationship with each other too.
-   A G-rated version on _Gravity Falls_; when Mabel asks Wendy if she has experience with breaking up with boys, the older girl starts to rattle off a list of boys, before wondering if she actually broke it off with one.
    
    **Wendy:** No wonder he keeps calling me.
    
-   Gigi in _Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law_ has been seen hitting on, making out, or sleeping with almost every man seen on screen... _except_ the title character. Which didn't stop her from claiming he fathered her child which was eventually revealed to be Grape Ape's.
-   Minx from _Jem_ is as obvious this as can be implied on a children's cartoon. She's so hell-bent on Rio (who sees her as an Abhorrent Admirer) because he's the only guy who she _couldn't_ easily seduce.
-   Boomhauer from _King of the Hill_ is known for a having a lot of sexual conquests, though after getting his heart broken in "Dang Old Love" this is toned down somewhat. However, it's possible Cotton has him beat after decades of affairs and visits to brothels.
    
    **Hank:** How could you not know you had another son?! How many women have you slept with? Five? _Six?!_
    
    **Cotton:** Two-hundred seventy-three.
    
-   In _Avatar: The Last Airbender,_ twelve-year-old Toph shows signs of being a tad boy crazy, seemingly infatuated with Sokka and then Zuko. The Sequel Series _The Legend of Korra_ implies that this evolved into a somewhat unstable love life as an adult, as she has two daughters with two different Disappeared Dads.
    -   Sokka could also fall into this. Despite being devoted to only two girls (Yue & Suki), he's able to get various girls head over heels for him.
-   Skwisgaar from _Metalocalypse_. Most of the band's on the slutty side (being world-renowned rock stars and all) but he's by far the sluttiest. It's a good thing that Charles Foster Ofdensen's got the whole Paternity Suit thing handled. It's outright stated that he has _thousands_ of illegitimate children all over the world.
    -   His mother is even worse.
        
        **Dr. Rockso the Rock'N'Roll Clown (He does cocaine)**: Hey Skwisgaar! I'm gettin a hand j-j-j-j-j-job from yo m-m-m-m-m-mama! Oh, man, and she's got that Swedish grip. It's like you playin' that guitar. Oh! Fiddlywiddlywiddlywilldy! Aww. Is somebody havin' a bad Christmas?
        
-   Peter in _The Real Ghostbusters_ is presented as a flirty womanizer with several ex lovers. Of course, how successful he is on new picks depends on the episode as sometimes his romantic failures are Played for Laughs.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   Mrs. Krabappel has hooked up with quite a few people when she wasn't married or dating someone. Ned Flanders wonders if he should stay with her because of everyone she's been with. In Season 23, they marry.
    -   Luann Van Houten. She has dated many men after the divorce. Otto tells Kirk "even I hooked up with your old lady" before apologizing to Milhouse.
-   Cartman's mom in _South Park_. The two-part episode that revealed this was titled "Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut"/"Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut", wherein most of the adult men on the show were potentially her son's father. Later episodes seem to indicate that she is literally a prostitute for a living.
    -   Kenny's girlfriend in "The Ring" is said to be this. Kenny is thrilled.
