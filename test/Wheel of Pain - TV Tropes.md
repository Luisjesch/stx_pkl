Round and round they go, which is really saying something.

This is a common torment for slaves in pre-industrial and fantasy settings, though occasionally it pops up in futuristic settings, too. The Wheel of Pain is a giant capstan to which slaves are chained and made to drive in order to power some unseen machinery. In Fictionland, it seems, every slave-holding culture has this device. The most notable exception are the slaves held on plantations in the antebellum South of the United States (who were forced to harvest crops _without_ the help of elaborate machinery).

Note that it is not strictly necessary to show a Wheel of Pain actually _doing_ anything with all the effort its victims put into it. Many a Wheel of Pain has appeared only to make a story's bad guys look cooler or more evil.

Has little or nothing to do with Painwheel. Nor about the "breaking on the wheel" method of execution, which is even _worse_. Look it up at your own risk.

Grim Sister Trope of Hamster-Wheel Power; the two can overlap if the Wheel of Pain is also being used as a power source.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Bizenghast_ volume 3, the characters are forcibly chained to one of these.
-   Electricity in Tentei's Capital in _Fist of the North Star_ comes from such a contraption, run by slaves.
-   Some enslaved Numemon are forced to operate one of these to power Machinedramon's city in _Digimon Adventure_.
-   _Superbook_: in the scene where Samson has been captured by the Philistines and is set to work grinding grain in his prison, he pushes one of these.
-   An episode of _Ulysses 31_ shows the loom of fate powered this way by those who have defied the gods.

    Comic Books 

-   In _Lucifer_, Hell is seen to have one of these.
-   In _Barbe-Rouge_, Eric finds himself sold as a slave in Alger. Since he is quick to rebel against his master, he soon finds himself sent to the oil mill, which serves this purpose.

    Comic Strips 

-   Used in _The Phantom_ in one storyline. The second Phantom is briefly held prisoner at one of these, which judging by the design of the wheel powers a mill, and is almost broken by the hard labor and torture, until a vision of his wife and his father, the original Phantom, spurs him into freeing himself by resuming the work by night when his torturer isn't present and using the wheel spokes to wear away on the chain. Eventually, he's worn it away enough for him to break it, and overpowers the torturer and locks him onto the wheel instead.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Named for the device from _Conan the Barbarian (1982)_, which turned the titular character from a scrawny kid into the musclebound Barbarian Hero that rampaged across two films. (Indeed, Arnold Schwarzenegger buffed up _so much_ for the movie, when he was being filmed pushing it along, the director had to have half the crew on the other side of the wheel pushing the opposite direction so it'd look like Arnie was actually exerting himself.) While the wheel's purpose was never revealed in the film itself, Word of God states that it was a grain wheel.
-   Used on the sugar plantation the eponymous protagonist is chained to in _Captain Blood_.
-   Zombie slaves provide the motive power for a similar sugar-mill capstan in _White Zombie_ (1932, and not connected with Rob Zombie beyond a A Good Name for a Rock Band).
    -   There's a surprisingly grisly moment for the movie's era when one of the zombies _falls into_ the mill and is mindlessly ground up by the rest.
-   _Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest_ had the Kraken Hammer raised by a device of this sort.
    -   The Black Pearl has a similar device... to raise and lower the anchor. Most ships of that age had one. (This is what a capstan is; several sea-shanties are paced to the rhythm ideal for pushing it, to keep everyone walking at the same pace.)
-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King_ had trolls turning huge wheels to open the gates of Mordor.
-   The film adaptation of the musical _Oliver!_ briefly shows a variation on the theme, as detailed in Real Life below, during the opening scene.
-   The Louis de Funès film _Delusions of Grandeur_ ends with the protagonists chained to one of those. It pumps water for a tiny "pet" palm tree of a Bedouin chief.

    Literature 

-   A Mammoth-pushed variant is shown in _The Way Things Work_ to power a Merry Go round. The Mammoths have carrots dangling in front of them and are basically tricked into turning one wheel, which is propped up against another with seats dangling off it.
-   The Great Wheel of Kharnabhar, in Brian W. Aldiss' _Helliconia_ trilogy, is _built inside a mountain_, has only one door, and takes several years to make a turn. The locals believe the Wheel drives Helliconia's great year, so in the centuries-long winter when things are bad for humans, the Wheel is basically a monastery staffed by volunteers; in summer, it's a prison.
    -   Which opens another question: How the hell was this thing built? And after it was finished, how was it put into move, since it's harder to make something move than keeping it moving?
-   Shows up a couple of times in _Gor_: the gate that one enters the Sardar Mountains at is powered by slaves, and in _Guardsman of Gor_ the hero is captured and set to work one which opens and closes a water gate. Don't worry, he planned for that to happen.
-   A variant in _Ranger's Apprentice_ - Skandian slaves turn the rack, which is a pair of paddles that aggravate the surface of the water in the well to prevent it freezing over in winter. It's such gruelling work that even the slave owners, who drive their slaves hard, recognise they can only work on it for two hours at a time.
-   In the later books of _Le Donjon de Naheulbeuk_, the barbarian, hired by an elven army as a drill sergeant, sets up one such wheel just for the purpose of strength training. He calls it the Wheel Of Muscle and reminisces about the more impressive ones he saw in his homeland. The Dwarf on the other hand, promptly rigs a mill to it and starts raking in money.
-   _The Raven Tower_ offers a Zig-Zagged example:
    -   The Strength and Patience of the Hill (a god who inhabits a large boulder) strikes a deal with Oissen (another god) to aid in the creation of Miracle Food for Oissen's faithful by promising to "grant the petition of whoever is causing me to be turned." Oissen sets a group of slaves to work at a wheel that turns The Strength and Patience of the Hill like a millstone while prayers are made to cause the food to materialize.
    -   The Strength and Patience of the Hill is later captured by the Raven (an enemy god) and affixed to a hydro-powered wheel in the sea caverns beneath the Raven's seat of power. There are no slaves operating the wheel, but The Strength and Patience of the Hill is themselves enslaved and forced to grant their powers to the Raven as long as the wheel turns them.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Doctor Who_ has the Christmas special "The Next Doctor", with orphans turning this type of device to turn the machinery to start the Cyber King.
-   _True Blood_, but not before the second season. Actually, Eric has one in the basement of his bar.
-   _Norsemen_ has one which, true to the trope, has absolutely no function other than to make the village slaves push something around and around.

    Myths & Religion 

-   _The Bible_: Samson, after being captured by the Philistines and blinded, is set to work on one of these.

    Theatre

-   One of the first missions in _Brütal Legend_ involves freeing a bunch of Headbangers from a mine that features one of these.
-   _The Deadly Tower of Monsters_: One of the friendly apes inhabiting the tower is pushing one of these. He says that if he stops, the tower will collapse, and another ape is ready to take his place when he dies.
-   In _Dominions 3_, Early Ulm has it as one of their national sites. Orphans are sent there, and those who survive are made into Steel Warriors, often called "Conans" by the fans.
-   A non-slavery example can be found in _The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker_. Tingle's brothers are responsible for keeping his lighthouse spinning. They aren't all that happy about it though.
    -   Though given that one of Tingle's "brothers" is a random, unrelated guy Tingle rescued from a shipwreck there may be a little bit of slavery involved...
-   An unoccupied one is seen in Cimmeria in _Age of Conan_. It might even be the same in the Trope Picture.
-   In _Conan Exiles_, it's used to grind seeds into gruel and make the captured NPCs into slaves.
-   One can appear in _Dungeons 2_ in parts of the overworld once they are corrupted by evil.
-   Some large huminoid creatures are shown pushing a wheel of pain in the Outworld Market stage in _Mortal Kombat X_. There are even slavers cracking whips at them.
-   Gene of _God Hand_ fame rescues a few humans from one.

    Western Animation 

-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_: "Return to Omashu": King Bumi's pet, Flopsy, is chained to one of these after the Fire Nation takes over Omashu and overthrows Bumi (or rather Bumi lets them win to spare his citizens).
-   _Samurai Jack_: In the pilot, protagonist finds his now-elderly father chained to one of these devices, which seemingly does nothing but rotate a large statue of Aku. Notably, he's the only person consigned to push it, as an apparent punishment for having been the one to defeat Aku originally.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   "Rosebud": Parodied when Homer, due to not returning Mr. Burns' teddy-bear, is forced to work one, which turns a display wheel at the canteen.
        
        **Lenny:** Hmm, I wonder what makes it turn.  
        **Carl:** Who cares?
        
    -   "The Serfsons": The fantasy equivalent of the power plant consists entirely of a huge version of this, which doesn't actually power anything; the resource it's harvesting is literally human misery.

-   _G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero_: Cobra in many of its earlier episodes inexplicably keeps haggard-looking slaves wearing rags, turning wheels and pushing mining carts, despite that fact that Cobra prides itself on using the sorts of advanced technology that would have made it easier to mine via automation.
-   _The Fairly OddParents!_:
    -   The beauty pageant episode has one of these in _every_ character's fantasy of them becoming mayor for a day. In Vicky's fantasy, Timmy is the one turning the wheel. In Timmy's Mom's fantasy, it's a bunch of men turning the wheel. When Timmy's Dad actually wins the contest and becomes mayor for a day, he basically makes the fantasy come to life...only it's his hated neighbor, Mr. Dinkleberg. turning the wheel.
    -   At one point in _Wishology_, the fairies are forced to do this by the Eliminators. Cupid asks "What happens if we stop pushing this thing?" They decide to find out... and discover that it plays the melancholy background music.
-   In _My Life as a Teenage Robot_, when first informed about the Cluster, we see humans chained to this, apparently to power some kind of Ice Cream Parlor for robots.
-   Seen in an episode of _The Critic_, when Alice is looking for a preschool for her daughter.

-   _ThunderCats (1985)_: In "Sword in a Hole", Captain Shiner forces Lion-O and Snarf to work on one in his ship's reactor. The main problem is the heat and radiation, which Captain Shiner tells Mumm-Ra will kill them in less than a day. Fortunately, Panthro rescues them.
-   In _The Venture Brothers_, in Dean's day-dream/hallucination in the Season 2 finale, he fights the Insect King (a cyborg version of his dad's arch-nemesis, the Monarch), who is forcing enslaved orphans to turn one of these.

    Real Life 

-   Something similar in principle was actually seriously proposed for use in workhouses in Victorian Britain, not for slaves, but for petty criminals and/or the long-term unemployed (the two groups were treated pretty much the same back then). It used a treadmill arrangement that resembled nothing so much as a very large hamster-wheel rather than the traditional capstan, which really isn't very much better, and rarely if ever served any practical purpose because steam power did the same job more effectively.
-   In the medieval period, there were pieces of construction machinery called treadle cranes, powered by people walking in, as in the example above, what amounted to a giant hamster wheel. They were basically the engines of the cranes used in castle and cathedral construction. They could also be powered by animals (a tiny version was found in kitchens, powered by a dog- so common that there was a specific breed of dog created for this, the now-extinct Turnspit dog.) This was never used as a torment for slaves or criminals though. While boring, it was actually one of the least physically demanding jobs on a cathedral building site since they needed the wheel to turn steadily, not quickly. Furthermore, the person in the wheel was unaffected by the weight of the load being carried by the crane. A shift in the wheel would have been more like an invigorating walk, assuming you weren't afraid of heights.
-   Treadwheels were also used to raise the counterweights on large trebuchets. Once can be seen on the modern replica at Warwick Castle in England.
-   The World's Strongest Man competition has this. As it is inspired by the Conan movie, it's appropriately called Conan's Wheel. It is heavy to lift and going in circles gives you a higher score.
-   Sugar plantations used to have presses that would work on the same principle. The Americas were notorious for these machines being pushed by slaves, and horrific accidents were commonplace.
-   The device that raised the anchor aboard an old-fashioned sailing ship worked on this principle. Anchors are incredibly heavy and quite a few men had to work the capstan.
-   Before steam and internal combustion engines became reasonable in size and price, lots of agricultural machinery ran using workhorses in precisely this manner. (This is where the term "horsepower" as a measure of engine power comes from.)
-   On a more lighthearted note: Karol Borchard, who used to be an officer on a ship in the Mediterraenean (in _the 20th century_) mentions in his memoirs a passenger utterly convinced that the ship **must** be run by sweaty, whip-driven rowers. Why? Because she's seen it in the movies.
-   Before the widespread adoption of windmills in the Middle Ages, most types of mill that weren't next to a river (where waterwheels were preferred) worked like this: a person or animal pushing on a bar, causing a millstone to revolve and crushing anything between the millstone and the base. Variations on this setup were used for grinding grain and crushing olives or grapes, dating as far back as the Neolithic period, making this trope's basis substantially Older Than Dirt.
