All the kids in the neighborhood know: if it ends up on his lawn, it _doesn't exist_.

_"Ernesto, can you not see that I am busy getting upset about some kids across the street having FUN?!"_

Kids will be kids. They like to have fun and don't tend to give a lot of consideration to how adults feel about it. The entire world is their playground, pretty much, and they generally don't mean any harm, even when their playing gets out of hand. Most adults are understanding, or at least willing to be tolerant of kids getting a little rambunctious.

And then there's _this_ adult. The one every kid in the neighborhood dreads.

Maybe they're a Child Hater, or they can't remember what it was like to have been young, or they have some other Freudian Excuse for their behavior. Whatever the cause, they feel that children should be seen and not heard, and that their fun is noisy, disruptive, dangerous, offensive, annoying, and otherwise undesirable. In their opinion, most other adults are far too lenient with those rotten little brats and let them get away with too much. While this Cranky Neighbor type can't control the whole world or even their whole neighborhood, they _can_ and will exert complete tyranny over one area —their own lawn.

Any child whose toy or other plaything ends up on this adult's property — lawn, roof, backyard, pool — is in for a bad time; the Fun Hating Confiscating Adult will triumphantly declare something along the lines of "It belongs to me now!" and make off with the plaything in question, which may end up forgotten in a box in the garage, or put in a trophy room of sorts — or worst of all, _thrown in the garbage_. Such an adult may have a vicious Angry Guard Dog to chase away any children brave enough to try retrieving their belongings. (Curiously, nobody ever seems to think to just report the geezer to the police for Theft of Property.)

There's a Sadist Teacher variation too, who will snatch whatever they catch a student using that they disapprove of. Sometimes they will give it back at the end of the semester — or the school year. Sometimes they consider it theirs from that point forward. Such a teacher may have a sniveling suck-up student helping to point out targets.

The most common resolution to a plot involving this villain involves some Kid Hero or another hatching a plan to get in and get all the stuff back, returning it to its happy and grateful owners. Occasionally, the kids will run to a parent, and the parent will confront the confiscator.

The most common subversion to the trope tends to be when the kids finally work out a plan to get their stuff back, only to discover that the adult in question isn't actually fun-hating and hasn't actually confiscated it. In cases like this, it's most likely some kind of misunderstanding. They're usually just a Misunderstood Loner with a Heart of Gold, and they've just been holding onto it, waiting for the kids to come for it.

For practical meta-reasons, this trope is common to family and children's fare. The Media Watchdogs tend to frown on shows involving children facing the types of more serious and deadly dangerous villains that turn up in media targeting an older or adult audience. This trope allows both kid viewers and adult viewers to dislike the villain, as (a) they are showing disrespect to the child and the child's property, and (b) the parent is usually the one who paid for or gifted the child with the toy being confiscated.

When the Confiscator is old (and they usually are) expect to see such tropes as Screw Politeness, I'm a Senior!, When Elders Attack, and Grumpy Old Man as well. Compare Fantasy-Forbidding Father and The Killjoy. May overlap with Fun-Hating Villain if the Confiscator is a main antagonist. See also Threw My Bike on the Roof for a more general application of the same principle. If they are not exactly of the mean type, though, they may instead be an Indubitably Uninteresting Individual, forcing their way of life on others.

     Anime and Manga 

-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ manga: A teacher not only confiscates a toy from Yugi, but threatens him, Jonouchi and Honda with expulsion if they can't find where he hid it within a time limit. Other Yugi triggers the toy's beeping, which reveals that the vain teacher hid it under his wig. And reveals to everyone that the teacher is actually bald.

     Films — Animated 

-   Justified and subverted in _Monster House_: Mr. Nebbercracker cultivated the "scary, cranky old man" image, and would snatch the toys that ended up landing on his lawn to protect kids from trying to retrieve them, because his house was sentient, possessed by the vengeful spirit of his wife who had big issues with nasty, pranking hooligan children and couldn't tell them from non-malicious children being playful. The truth is that he was a kind-hearted sweet old man who was happy to give the toys back once the danger was over.

     Films — Live-Action 

-   _Deadly Friend_: As if Elvira Parker, the local vile old spinster, had not been mean enough by screaming at people to get away from her house (which is fortified like a prison) when they so much as breathe wrong near it, she Kicks the Dog further by taking the protagonist teens' basketball when it lands on her porch... Which becomes a Chekhov's Gun of the most Bloody Hilarious sort later in the movie.
    
    **Tom "Slime" Toomey**: Hey, you can't do that!  
    **Elvira Parker**: Yes, I can. My property, my house... (Beat, smug little smile appears on her face) my ball. (Tosses the ball inside her home, walks back in and closes the door)
    
-   _The Sandlot_ has one. He even has an Angry Guard Dog called The Beast; this ends up being a subversion as neither is really as bad as the children originally believed.
-   Mr. Strickland in the _Back to the Future_ trilogy.
-   Ms. Stout from _The Search for Santa Paws_ hates Christmas for no explained reason and will confiscate any toys or Christmas decorations the girls in her Orphanage of Fear have. She actually goes a step further by throwing them in a furnace.
-   A brief gag in _A Christmas Story_ has the children in Ralphie's class wear fake buck teeth when their teacher comes in. Without saying a word, she holds out her hand and the students hand them over. The teacher isn't so much shown as fun-hating than no-nonsense though, and the fact that the students know the drill and she already has a drawer full of confiscated novelty items implies this is far from the first time they've done something like that.

     Literature 

-   Filch from _Harry Potter_ had a room full of things confiscated from students, including the Marauders' Map, which the Weasley twins liberated and then gave to Harry.

Being fanatical disciplinarians, the Cribbens stowed the toys in the attic.
-   _Just William_ had to deal with several of these, and generally came out on top.
-   In the children's book, _The Wonderful Farm_, one story has an unusual variant in that the girls have their ball confiscated by an angry old _goose_, who proceeds to lecture them on not taking proper care of their things (they were, the ball had just flown past one of them and had the bad luck of rolling too close to the pond). Interestingly, he is quite happy to play with it himself and let his own children play with it. The girls, meanwhile, spend the rest of the story trying to get it back to avoid a scolding from their parents. In the end, the family's donkey uses some clever trickery and the goose ultimately relents.

     Live Action TV

This trope was played with in the sense that over the course of the investigation, she was shown to be a more of a human being. Though they did find the cedar chest where she kept all of the toys.
-   _Saturday Night Live_: Cheri Oteri's recurring character Rita DelVecchio, who would tell kids "I keep it now!

Then he secretly smiles at how cute the kids are. Of course, Joel and the bots have a field day with this.
