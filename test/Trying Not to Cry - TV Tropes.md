Instructions unclear: only cried a little bit more.

_"So, of course, as a young boy, I'm sitting there thinking, 'I'm tough. It's just a cartoon. It ain't gonna leave an impact on me—_ (Grumpy starts to cry) _Oh no, not Grumpy. Not Grumpy, no, he was the tough one! Not Grumpy, not Gr—oh, there's no hope for humanity!'"_

Basically, it's trying to hold back any crying in a situation. The simple fact is that tears are often seen as a sign of weakness. Therefore characters hold them back to try to be strong, either to appear so as an example to others or because it's expected of certain people.

Now often people will fail at this because the grief is too strong for them to hold back, or because they reach a breaking point. Other times the grief may manifest in other ways if it's held in too long. Sometimes the grief can eventually be let out through Manly Tears.

One of the most common forms is if someone says "I promised myself I wouldn't cry".

Compare Sand In My Eyes, Cathartic Crying, Men Don't Cry, Sorrowful Stutter, Stiff Upper Lip, Rage Breaking Point, He Will Not Cry, so I Cry for Him, Running Away to Cry. Contrast Ocular Gushers, Unable to Cry. Compare and contrast Prone to Tears. Opposite of Holding in Laughter.

Tip if you ever need to do this in real life: focus your eyes on an object or fixed point and stare at it as hard as you can.

    Anime and Manga 

-   The reason why Yoshiko Fujisawa from _Captain Tsubasa_ didn't want to face Matsuyama and her team after their loss to Nankatsu was basically her fear to cry in front of them. Considering that she was about to be put on a plane, that would be the last time she'd see them.
    -   Also, this is why Kumi Sugimoto ran away from Tsubasa after he gently but firmly rejects her affections
-   Lafiel from the _Crest of the Stars_ series is heir to the Jade Throne and therefore not supposed to cry. This is explained that crying for any one person in the Empire is a sign of favoritism, and the Emperor/Empress is supposed to be an impartial ruler, so they must either cry for _everyone_ or no one. She refuses to cry when she is forced to order the Basroil's crew to leave Jinto behind during their mission in Lobnas II. After successfully evacuating the female prisoners, however, she returns to the planet and organizes a search party to look for him. When they find him malnourished but alive, she finally sheds a few tears.
-   In Episode 15 of _Healin' Good♡Pretty Cure_, Nodoka tries hard not to cry after Rabirin calls her mean and storms off.
-   _My-Otome_: When Arika Yumemiya finally meets her long-dead mother (revived to participate in Grand Duke Nagi’s Evil Plan to bring down the Otome), she thinks she'd have a lot to say, but after introducing herself ("Look, mom! I'm an Otome! Doesn't it suit me?"), she finds she can't bring herself to say the rest. Queen Mashiro looks on and, knowing that they must destroy Lena to free the Otome, admonishes herself that she promised she wouldn't cry anymore. Of course, she and the audience have trouble keeping that promise. Showing Arika finally embracing her mother for one first and last moment doesn't help that promise, either...
-   Chillingly deconstructed in (what else?) _Neon Genesis Evangelion_. After the nightmarish circumstances surrounding her mother's demise, Asuka swore to herself that she will never cry or depend on someone else ever again. When she breaks this during her Mind Rape (sobbing and calling out for Kaji), she gets a _very_ nasty mental breakdown that eventually drives her comatose.
-   In _Pokémon: The Series_, there are moments throughout the series where Ash will lower his head so the brim of his hat hides his eyes. This is a sure sign that he is trying to avoiding letting others see him cry. A common time for this is when releasing Pokémon.
-   In _Sailor Moon_, just before Mamoru gets put on a plane Usagi comes to say good-bye to him at the airport. She starts crying and says "Oh no! I wanted to see you off with a smile!"
-   In _The World God Only Knows_, this occurred on the very same chapter / episode of the _Goddesses Arc_: FLAG 189 / Episode 12. Chihiro, despite having made a cheerful proclamation at the beginning of her band's performance, completely breaks down to tears at the end of the concert, after having sung a song that was completely about Keima.
-   Tsukimi in _Princess Jellyfish_ promises her mother wouldn't cry as she lay dying but Shuu holds her later and tells her it's okay and that she can cry.
-   _Project A-ko_: Seen when B-ko finally reaches her emotional breaking point with A-ko, when the latter complains about B-ko making her late for class again. Despite trying to hold back her tears, her voice breaks and she ends up crying anyway.
    
    **B-ko:** _(angrily, with tears)_ Is THAT the only thing you care about? Being a "good girl"? Charming the teachers?! Well! Obviously it's never occurred to you that some children just are born with the same CHARM!! But what do _you_ care?? You get to be the heroine, while I'm the one everyone says is spoiled! Okay — If they say I'm the bad girl, **then that's what I'm GONNA BE!!**
    
-   In _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind_, one of Giorno Giovanna's character tics is that he trembles in response to feeling strong emotion. Giorno trembles most noticeably when those close to him die, such as when Abbacchio is killed, suggesting that he often trembles in an effort to hold back tears. Giorno fails to hold back his tears when Narancia dies too quickly to be healed. Near the end of the arc, Giorno trembles so violently that he breaks out in a sweat after defeating Diavolo, grieved over the friends he lost and clearly struggling to keep his composure.
-   The companion manga and movie adaptation of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's_ have a scene where Hayate berates herself for tearing up when Nanoha brings up Reinforce's Heroic Sacrifice. In response, Nanoha and Fate pull her into a hug and tell her that she doesn't need to force herself to be strong in this case, leading to all the emotions she'd kept bottled up to come pouring out at once.
-   _Kotaro Lives Alone_: Early in the series it's established that Kotaro doesn't like crying, despite, in his own words, having been around a lot of adults crying.

When the rest of the apartment neighbors are there to bid her farewell, Kotaro is wearing a Tonosaman mask and refuses to say why. His body language, however, makes it clear that he's trying his best to disguise the fact that he's crying throughout the whole deal.
-   _One Piece_: When asked by Zoro, Usopp says he won't cry during the Going Merry's Viking funeral, as he prepared himself long ago. But like most of the crew, he fails to hold back his tears, which pour out in droves from under his Sniper King mask.

But since Gwen is so unused to being confrontational, she's also struggling to hold back tears — which leaves her eyes intimidatingly red and bloodshot from the strain. Combined with the general strain on her face making it seem like she has a teeth-gritting Death Glare and then a Slasher Smile, as well as her awkward wording making it seem like she plans to vengefully haunt him for the rest of his life, Frederick is left even more scared of her than before.

-   _Centaurworld_: In "The Key," when the herd's attempt to fix a houseboat for the shaman Waterbaby falls apart, Horse begins to break down out of fear she'll never see Rider again. To avoid sullying her image as a hardened soldier, she tries very hard to keep herself from crying, insisting (through song) that the only thing coming out of her eyes are "frustration tears." Eventually she succumbs to Inelegant Blubbering, and the rest of the herd celebrates her first "ugly cry."
-   In the final episode of _Codename: Kids Next Door_, "I.N.T.E.R.V.I.E.W.S", Numbuh 4 tries to act tough while he says goodbye to Numbuh 1 before the latter leaves for the Galactic Kids Next Door, but he ends up breaking into tears like the rest of his teammates.

-   _Happy Monster Band_: In "Even Monsters Cry Sometimes", Frred avoids an utter urge to cry, due to his father getting a flat tire, and being unable to attend the concert. The other band members notice this and tell him it's okay to cry - the lesson being taught by the episode - and sure enough, that's exactly what he does.
-   Bubbles of _The Powerpuff Girls_ invokes this and makes good on it in the episode "Bubblevicious." Having gone "hardcore," she is captured by Mojo Jojo and subjected to a painful ray which Bubbles takes up to level 11 before she breaks free and kicks Mojo's ass.
    -   Later in the series in the episode "All Chalked Up," Bubbles looks as if she wants to lay an unholy smackdown on Buttercup for destroying her colored chalk. But just as she and Buttercup face each other in a tense moment, Bubbles flies off into the woods, wailing inelegantly.

    Real Life 

-   We've all done this at least once in our lives, whether it's during an argument, after receiving tragic news or when overjoyed, almost always because our heavy emotions get in the way of saying what we want.
-   In an example of where this trope crosses over with Tranquil Fury, it's not uncommon for people who are absolutely furious (but barely holding on to their emotions) to begin shedding tears as the adrenaline kicks in, and then try hard to not show it when they realise what's happening... that is, until they've had enough.
-   Wayne Gretzky during the press conference to announce he was being traded from the Edmonton Oilers, with whom he had won 4 Stanley Cups and played his entire career, to the Los Angeles Kings, famously broke down in tears while speaking about it and said "I promised Mess (teammate Mark Messier) I wouldn't do this."
-   David Tennant on his last day on the set of _Doctor Who_.
-   This often happens at tennis Grand Slam finals, as the runners up have to make speeches just minutes after going through the emotionally crushing ordeal of falling at the final hurdle. Players fight the tears both so that they can speak, but also because crying can detract from the winner's victory. Notable examples include:
    -   Wimbledon 2012: Andy Murray was denied his first Slam for a fourth time, in front of a home crowd. He stumbled through an emotional speech, having to break off frequently when his voice failed and in the end he was pretty much the only one in the stadium _not_ crying.
    -   Australian Open 2009: Rafael Nadal prevented good friend and rival Roger Federer from winning a record-equalling 15th Slam. Federer, known for having Nerves of Steel and always being a Graceful Loser, broke down sobbing. He managed to fight the tears for the trophy presentation, but lost it again and aborted his speech, obviously angry with himself for tarnishing Nadal's moment of glory. Nadal pulled him into a hug and Federer got himself together, finishing the speech by talking about what a great champion Nadal was.
    -   Not a Grand Slam final, but it still counts: In the quarterfinals of the 2012 French Open, 5th seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga had an extremely tough opponent in the form of then-World No. 1 Novak Djokovic. Amazingly, he actually came within one point of defeating the World No. 1 and pulling off a miracle upset in front of his countrymen...only for Djokovic to kill every one of his _four_ match points and steamroll over him in the final set, which left Tsonga so shattered that he hid his face in a towel for several minutes after the match.
-   Common for winners of prestigious awards, such as the Oscars or the Grammys.
-   Some actors have struggled not to cry when filming sad scenes.
    -   _Sesame Street_ The famous "Mr. Hooper's not coming back" scene was all done in one take, because the cast was too emotionally wrecked to do second takes and struggled not to cry throughout the entire take, and thus were able to capture genuine emotion. This is because they were all mourning the loss of Mr. Hooper's actor, Will Lee.
    -   Michael Crawford struggled not to cry during the recording of the song "Please Wake Up" in _Once Upon a Forest_ where he's hoping and praying against hope that his dying niece recovers, and his students find the herbs she needs, as he's too old to make the journey himself. It was as if someone in Crawford's own family was dying and he was putting the same investment into a performance that he would put into real life.
