_Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are out camping. Suddenly, Holmes wakes up Watson in the middle of the night._  
**Holmes:** Look up, Watson, and tell me what you see.  
**Watson:** I see billions of stars.  
**Holmes:** And what do you deduce from that?  
**Watson:** Well, Astrologically, I deduce that Saturn is in Capricorn. Astronomically, that it is 3:00 am. Meteorologically, that tomorrow will be a beautiful day. Theologically, that God is all-powerful, and we are small and insignificant. What do you deduce?  
**Holmes:** Watson, you idiot. I deduce that _someone has stolen our tent._

Where the Ultimate Answer is not actually 42.

A scene opens. Two characters stand by each other in silence. Then, one character breaks the silence by asking a vague, multi-meaning question such as "Why are we here?"

The other character then answers by going into a long monologue about the meaning of life, the existence of God, everyone's place in the world, how it is all one big mystery, and no one may ever know for sure.

Only that's not what the first character was asking. He meant something simpler, like "What did we come into this bookstore for?"

In a variation, it's obvious from the first that the question is about something specific, and the very act of treating it like a big question in the first place makes for a joke.

Mostly seen as the first lines of the first scene or a new scene. This can also be used as an exposition shortcut.

Compare, contrast What's a Henway? Frequently a form of Comically Missing the Point. A variation of Mathematician's Answer.

She finally asks, "Just when are you going to explain this to me? What on Earth am I doing here?"

-   Used in a _FoxTrot_ strip, with Paige asking her father why they have fireworks for the Fourth of July.

    “Well, this isn't too bad, is it?” Paul said quietly. “I mean, besides the leather couch....”
    
    “... and the whole military-industrial complex air of the place,” muttered George. “And the armed guards. _And_ the pleasant little notion that more people are fighting each other over us.”
    
    “I meant just the VIP quarters,” Paul clarified, “but yeah.”

    **Teacher**: "Oh. That's because the Caretaker is very, very weird."
    
-   In _Infinity Train: Blossoming Trail_, Chloe asks her partners Atticus and Lexi why they are here<sup>Explanation&nbsp;</sup> :
    
    **Atticus:** Oh, that is one of life’s greatest mysteries. Why are we here? Why were we created as we were, with our goal being to help passengers work through their emotional turmoils when each and every car is its own little world of its own? Does One-One have a plan for all of us? Creating us as we are on an perpetually moving train, infinitely creating more and more cars like they were nothing but dreams of a child who has slept for a hundred years? I don’t know, but sometimes I ponder that whenever I think of Tulip.  
    **Chloe:** ...What? I mean WHY ARE WE HERE FOR THE PAST HOUR OR SO HAVING TROUBLE WITH A STUPID STATUE?!
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Field of Dreams_: Ray Kinsella convinces Terrence Mann to go to a baseball game with him. As they walk into the stadium, they discuss Terrence's writing, his activism, and his current reclusiveness. Finally, Ray asks him:
    
    **Ray:** So what do you want?  
    **Terrence:** I want people to stop looking to me for answers; begging me to speak again, write again, be a leader. I want people to start thinking for themselves. _**And I want my privacy!**_  
    _\[Beat\]_  
    **Ray:** No, I mean... (_points at the concession stand_) What do you **want**?  
    **Terrence:** Oh... a dog and a beer.
    
-   In the film _Dunston Checks In_, an orangutan gets loose in the Majestic Hotel.
    
    **Mrs. Dubrow (Hotel Owner):** Where did he come from?!

-   In _Airplane II: The Sequel_:
-   From Mike Leigh's _Naked (1993)_:
    
    **Louise:** How did you get here?  
    **Johnny:** Well, basically, there was this little dot, right? And the dot went bang and the bang expanded. Energy formed into matter, matter cooled, matter lived, the amoeba to fish, to fish to fowl, to fowl to frog, to frog to mammal, the mammal to monkey, to monkey to man, amo amas amat, quid pro quo, memento mori, ad infinitum, sprinkle on a little bit of grated cheese and leave under the grill till Doomsday.

    Literature 

-   This is very common in the _Discworld_ books.
    -   In _The Light Fantastic_, it's mentioned that the greatest philosopher of the Disc was asked at a party "Why are you here?" He needed three years for the answer.
    -   In _Equal Rites_, when a young girl is asked (after arriving unexpectedly) where she came from, she answers that Granny won't tell her that yet.
    -   In _Eric_, when at the end of time Astfgl the demon lord speaks with Death, resulting in the following exchange:
        
        **Astfgl:** Have you seen anybody?  
        **Death:** Yes.  
        **Astfgl:** Who?  
        **Death:** Everyone.  
        **Astfgl:** I mean anyone recently.  
        **Death:** It's been very quiet.
        
    -   In _Reaper Man_, when Death is asked: "Why are we here?", he says: "I do not speculate on cosmic matters."
    -   In _I Shall Wear Midnight_, when Esk is asked "Do you know what the time is?" she replies "It is a way of describing one of the notional dimensions of four-dimensional space. But for your purposes, it's about ten forty-five."
    -   In _Going Postal_, there's an inversion, as unlikely as that sounds. Vetinari asks a serious philosophical question and gets the answer, "Well, my lord, I've always thought that what the world really needs are filing boxes which are not so flimsy."
-   This happens in a serious and plot-relevant way in Gene Wolfe's _Book of the New Sun_ series. The protagonist asks for "directions to the garden," which is misinterpreted as a request for ultimate enlightenment by an entity capable of obliging.
-   A short story in _American Girls_ Magazine some years back had a woman come to a New Ager tween who people had been mistaking for a Kid Detective (It Makes Sense in Context) saying "I need help finding patience and harmony." The New Ager is delighted that someone actually wants her help in finding enlightenment... until she learns that Patience and Harmony are just the names of the woman's lost cats.
-   Near the end of _Monster Hunter Legion_, Owen receives an info dump from the ghost of a dead Hunter, telling him the nature of the monster that has attacked their hotel and exactly what the monster is up to now. The ghost says that Owen needs to defeat the monster, and when Owen asks how to do that, the ghost just points upwards. Owen asks if that means that God is going to smite the monster. The ghost says, no, it means that Owen needs to get to the roof.
-   In the third novel of _The Dagger and the Coin_ series, Cithrin is sent to train with a banker and wants to make a good impression. Cithrin was raised by a shrewd banker who trained her to discern complex economic and political issues into seemingly simple and unrelated situations, but offered no love and left her emotionally stunted. So, when her new mentor asks Cithrin why she gave her a vase full of flowers, Cithrin gives a long and detailed answer about how gifts create a relationship of obligation in a different/superior way to money. At this point, the mentor sadly comments that she gave the gift so Cithrin would like her, and Cithrin is horrified at having revealed how bad she is at normal human interactions.
-   Early in _American Gods_, Shadow is released from prison and about to fly home, which makes him remember an anecdote his old cell-mate once told him. During a previous parole, the cellmate had planned to fly home to see his sister, but after losing his temper when being informed that his driver's license had expired, ended up going on a drunken bender, robbing a gas station to get booze money, being arrested for public urination, and ultimately winding up back in prison with extra time for armed robbery (in that order). Shadow, who is very intelligent despite pretending to be dumb muscle questioned whether the moral of the story was that "The kind of behavior that works in a specialized environment, such as prison, can fail to work and in fact become harmful when used outside such an environment", but his cellmate insisted the moral was to not piss off people who work in airports.
-   In _Terra Ignota_, when Martin Guildbreaker is interviewing Cato Weeksbooth, he asks why Cato has been volunteering at the science museum since he was fifteen. Cato goes on a long rant about how science is being taught wrong, and it's all geared towards end goals like "learn geometry so you can design a building." Martin politely explains that he just wanted to know why Cato started at that age specifically.

    Live-Action TV 

-   An episode of _Goodness Gracious Me_ has two teenagers in a Hindu temple, one of whom asks the other "why are we here?" After the second gives a long philosophical speech, the first asks "No, why are we _here_? We're Sikhs."
-   In a _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ sketch, Dennis Moore, who robs from the rich and gives to the poor, is asked by his latest victims "What do you want? Why are you here?" He takes this as a philosophical question despite the fact that he just swung into their window to steal their possessions for the third time.
-   _Babylon 5_:
    -   Deconstructed in "Signs and Portents", in which the _point_ is to ask these questions until the questionee starts revealing things that are actually relevant:
        
        **Morden:** What do you want?  
        **G'Kar:** Well, what do you mean, what do I want?  
        **Morden:** What do you want?  
        **G'Kar:** What do I want for supper, what do I want to do this evening, what do I...  
        **Morden:** What do you want?  
        **G'Kar:** This is pointless. What I want is for you to go away and leave me in peace.  
        **Morden:** As you say.  
        **G'Kar:** Wait! What do I want? The Centauri stripped my world. I want justice.
        
    -   And also inverted by the episode "Comes the Inquisitor", in which the titular inquisitor interrogates Delenn with questions of this type, responding to mundane answers with Electric Torture:
        
        **Sebastian:** Do you know why you're here?  
        **Delenn:** Here?  
        **Sebastian:** Here, now, yes!  
        **Delenn:** I was sent.  
        **Sebastian:** Here?  
        **Delenn:** Yes, by Kosh.  
        **Sebastian:** You've answered the wrong question! Why are you here now, _in this place, in this life_?
        
    -   The above are 2 of 5 questions pivotal to the series which invert this trope, they are presented as the ultimate questions, each asked by a different race. Which one is answered and how it is answered is very important... and _never_ ask the question from one race to another.
        
        **Vorlon Question:** Who are you?  
        **Shadow Question:** What do you want?  
        **Techno Mage Question:** Where are you going?  
        **Emperor Turhan's Question:** Why are you here?  
        **Lorien's Question:** _\[the most important, as it's asked by the 1<sup>st</sup> sentient being in the galaxy\]_ Do you have anything worth living for?
        
    -   The Vorlon in general like to play with this trope, by giving broad, and not immediately helpful, responses to simple questions.
        
        **Sheridan:** You know, I just had a thought. You've been back and forth to your homeworld so many times since you got here; how do I know you're the same Vorlon? Inside that encounter suit, you could be anyone.  
        **Kosh:** I have always been here.  
        **Sheridan:** Oh yeah? You said that about me, too.  
        **Kosh:** Yes.  
        **Sheridan:** I really hate it when you do that.  
        **Kosh:** Good.
        
-   Shows up a few times in _Angel_:
    -   In the episode "Sanctuary", Faith has agreed to stay with Angel and start atoning for her (many) sins:
        
        **Faith:** _\[in kitchen\]_ So, how does this work?  
        **Angel:** There's no real simple answer to that. I won't lie to you and tell you it'll be easy, because it won't be. Just because you've decided to change doesn't mean the world's ready for you to. The truth is... no matter how much you suffer, no matter how many good deeds you do to try to make up for the past, you may never balance out the cosmic scale. The only thing I can promise you is that you'll probably be haunted... and maybe for the rest of your life.  
        **Faith:** _\[indicates the microwave\]_ So how does _this_ work?  
        **Angel:** Uh... power level, time, start. Sure that popcorn is gonna be enough for you?
        
    -   In "War Zone", Angel does this deliberately while Perp Sweating.
        
        **Lenny:** What do you want?  
        **Angel:** Big question. What do I want? Love, family, a place on this planet I can call my own... but you know what?  
        **Lenny:** What?  
        **Angel:** I'm never going to have any of those things. And unless these next few minutes go exactly the way I want them to, neither are you.
        
-   The _Friends_ episode "The One With The Two Parts":
    
    **Rachel:** So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?  
    **Phoebe:** Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.  
    **Rachel:** Okay. Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree & Evelyn?  
    **Phoebe:** Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
    
-   _Leverage_ has a classic example:
    
    **Nate:** Soph. Where are we at?  
    **Sophie:** Huh? I don't know, Nate. I think you need to ask yourself that question. You called me, remember? And now we're working together every day... I don't know what you want! And you ask me that, dressed as a vicar! You're a very strange man.  
    **Nate:** No no no, I meant, where are we at, finding the money?
    
-   An interesting aversion/variation occurs in _Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy_:
    
    **George Smiley:** Why did Lacon send you for me?  
    **Peter Guillam:** Do you mean _why_ did he send me for you? Or why did he send _me_ for you?  
    **George Smiley:** Quite right, Peter. I should have known better than to have asked.
    
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The serial "City of Death" (written by Douglas Adams) features the following exchange:
        
        **Romana:** Where are we going?  
        **Doctor:** Are you talking philosophically or geographically?  
        **Romana:** Philosophically.  
        **Doctor:** Then we're going to lunch.
        
    -   Also, in the Seventh Doctor story "Dragonfire", the Doctor distracts a guard by engaging him in a philosophical discussion and then later bursts in on a hold up by Belazs, gun in hand:
        
        **Belazs:** Where did you come from?  
        **Doctor:** Why is everyone so interested in philosophy here?  
        **Glitz:** I think she means to do away with you!  
        **Doctor:** Ah, an existentialist.
        
    -   A variant in New Who when Donna tells Ten she has to leave and he launches into a heartwarming goodbye monologue...only to realize she meant she's going to visit her family for a bit and then come back. Donna doesn't let him off the hook easily, predictably.
-   Inverted in a comic scene from _Xena: Warrior Princess_, in which Plucky Comic Relief Joxer is helping the heroines and "king of thieves" Autolycus track down Joxer's long-lost brother Jett.
    
    **Autolycus:** _\[watching Joxer's antics from a distance\]_ Why is he here?  
    **Gabrielle:** Because he knows how to find Jett.  
    **Autolycus:** No, in a larger sense... why is he _here_?
    
-   In the _Firefly_ episode "Out of Gas", Mal tries to convince Zoe that Serenity is a decent ship:
    
    **Mal:** Try to look beyond what she is now, and see what she could be.  
    **Zoe:** What's that, sir?  
    **Mal:** Freedom is what.  
    **Zoe:** _\[points to something on the floor\]_ No, what's **that**, sir?  
    **Mal:** Oh, yeah, I guess something must've been living in here, just step around that.
    
-   In the _Mad Men_ episode "The Gypsy and the Hobo", Don and Betty take the kids trick-or-treating following Don's confession of his past identity.
    
    **Neighbor:** Let's see what we've got here; a hobo and gypsy (looks up at Don) and who're _you_ supposed to be?
    
-   Inverted in _Everybody Loves Raymond_. Ray's daughter Ally asks 'Where do babies come from?'. He responds with a typical, awkward birds and the bees talk, but it turns out she was wondering about the meaning of human existence.
-   In _Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda_: Trance has just inexplicably broken into Dylan's prison cell and offers him water. Dylan asks, "How?" Trance replies: "Well, when two hydrogen atoms love each other very much, they find an oxygen atom and..."
-   Pops up in _Mystery Science Theater 3000_ in "The Incredible Melting Man".
    
    **Actor:** What did go on here, Doc?  
    **Mike:** During the Ice Age, glaciers moved through... oh, you mean recently.
    
-   _Space Cases_ has an example where Thelma gets asked the wrong question, and sure enough, ends up starting with the Big Bang... surprisingly enough, she gets to the end after a scene switch!
-   In an episode of _WKRP in Cincinnati_, Jennifer reluctantly became the host of a radio advice show. One exchange from her show:
    
    **Caller:** What is the meaning of life?  
    **Jennifer:** The cereal or the magazine?
    
-   _Lost_:
    
    **Charlie:** _\[giving Locke the drugs\]_ You really think you can find my guitar?

    **Locke:** I want you to look up.  
    _\[Charlie looks up... and his guitar is wrapped in vines on a cliff\]_
    
-   _Blake's 7_:
    
    **Tarrant:** Where are we going, Avon?  
    **Avon:** Profound philosophical questions never really interested me.  
    **Tarrant:** Ooh, not up to your usual standard.
    
-   _The Suite Life of Zack & Cody:_
    
    **Zack:** Arwin? Why are you here?  
    **Arwin:** Well, there are two theories, one is evolution, and the other is—  
    **Zack:** No, why are you _here_, in the basement?
    
-   _Austin & Ally_:
    
    **Austin:** What are we selling here?  
    **Ally:** Love, hope, a triumph of the human spirit...  
    **Austin:** No. _\[beat\]_ We're selling soup.
    
-   _Veronica Mars_ had this exchange:
    
    **Logan:** So, what do you think?  
    **Veronica:** Like...in general, or is there a specific arena in which you'd like my opinion?  
    **Logan:** Do you think Duncan, uh, is just cooling off or is he, like, holed up in some hotel room pouring peroxide on his hair and trying to file his fingerprints off?
    
-   In _Blackadder II_, when Blackadder is obviously drunk in front of his Puritan relatives:

-   _The Dick Van Dyke Show_: Richie asks "where did I come from?" Rob & Laura think that he means the act of procreation and try to give him The Talk, after which he clarifies: his friend says that he (the friend) comes from New York, so where does Richie come from?

    -   Later, when Kermit sees Fozzie's abysmal comedy routine:

-   _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1978)_:
    -   A variant occurs when the ship has just landed in a weird, icy cave. Zaphod, waxing philosophical: "We could really... we could really _be_ in this cave!" Arthur, unimpressed: "We are in this cave."
    -   And a few minutes later...
        
        **Arthur:** Why are we here?  
        **Ford:** Now don't you start.  
        **Arthur:** I mean in this cave.
        
    -   We already know that the Answer to the Ultimate Question is "42". So, in a more plot-relevant sense, "What do you get when you multiply six by nine?" is _Not Actually the Ultimate Question_. Especially since six times nine is 54. Except in base 13. Douglas Adams does not write jokes in base 13.
    -   The joke was also used in this context; when Arthur learns that the mice have spent millions of years trying to find the Question, he immediately asks "Why?" They reply "No, we thought of that, but it doesn't fit the answer."
-   _Hamish and Dougal_ subverted the page quote utterly.
    
    **Dougal:** Look up in the sky, Hamish...tell me what you see.  
    **Hamish:** I see the full moon and a lot of stars, each one in its proper place...which tells me God is in his heaven, and all's right with the world.  
    **Dougal:** ...Hamish, you're an idiot. We are in a tent. It is impossible to see the moon or any of the stars from here.  
    **Hamish:** Well...not if somebody had stolen the tent.  
    **Dougal:** _(laughing)_ Stolen the tent! That would be the funniest joke in the world, wouldn't it!
    

    Video Games 

-   In _Normality_, when you are about to be captured later in the game, the Dialogue Tree allows you to respond to the question "Why are you here?" with "That is a question that has puzzled philosophers for thousands of years.".
-   Two of the White Ninjas in _Destroy All Humans! 2_ have a conversation that is a direct Shout-Out to the _Red vs. Blue_ example.
-   _Dragon Age: Inquisition_: There's some party banter poking fun at one of the gripes with _Dragon Age II_:
    
    **Bull:** Hey Varric, I was reading your stuff. Where do your bad guys come from?  
    **Varric:** Well, some of them come from Tevinter, and some are Ben-Hassrath spies, but I like the stories where the villain was the man beside you all the time. The best villains don't see themselves as evil — they're fighting for a good cause, willing to get their hands dirty.  
    **Bull:** All right... that's really deep and all, but I meant "where do the bad guys come from, _literally?_" The way you write it, it's like they just fall from the sky and land on top of the hero.  
    **Varric:** I like to leave some things to the reader's imagination.
    
    -   It also doubles as Foreshadowing, as the secret villain of the game is one of your companions... whose perspective of himself and his motivations are exactly as Varric says.

    Web Animation 

-   _Red vs. Blue_:
    -   The first episode shows two characters on top of one of the Blood Gulch bases. One asks the other, "Do you ever wonder why we're here?". The other expectantly responds with a brief speech about whether or not we were created, or just popped into existence. What the asking character actually meant was "Why are we here in a box-canyon in the middle of nowhere?" It even gives a Shout-Out to _Halo_ and how they'd be fighting aliens if Master Chief hadn't blown up the Covenant armada single-handed.
    -   And then it's played with and returned to in a later episode.
        
        _"Do you ever wonder why we're here?"_  
        _"No. I never, **ever** wonder why we're here. Semper Fi, bitch."_
        
    -   Similarly, the Blood Gulch Chronicles series ends with Caboose asking the same question, and Church gives a rant about how hate should be a personal thing, not a product of prejudice. Caboose just wanted to know why they were standing in the open sun when they could stand in the shade.
    -   And given a Double Subversion, combined with a Call-Back in _Revelation_, Chapter 18. Sarge asks each and every one of the remaining Reds and Blues why they are here. Grif begins reading his lines from Season One, when Sarge cuts him off and explains that he meant to ask an even more meaningful question - why are each of the Reds and Blues still in this group, when they could be off somewhere else? He then delivers a Rousing Speech that brings the both teams together and makes them ready to kick ass.

-   _Gamecheetz_ gives us a rare inversion:
-   In a 2021 _Dork Tower_ strip, Ken asks Igor if he ever wonders why he's here. Igor replies that he tries to live in the moment, untroubled by existential questions. Ken clarifies that he was asking if Igor ever wonders why he's _here_, still living in the game room six months after lockdown ended.
