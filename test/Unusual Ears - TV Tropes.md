**Soval:** What is their fixation with our ears?

**T'Pol:** I believe they are envious.

In Speculative Fiction and Mythology, it is not surprising to see characters with non-standard ears. Having non-human ears is a common way of indicating that a character that otherwise looks mostly human is Not Quite Human, whether it be an alien, supernatural creature or human significantly modified through magical or pseudo-scientific means. Unusual Ears are particularly popular in Speculative Fiction television and film, where they are used as a relatively cheap way of making Rubber-Forehead Aliens. Pointy Ears are by far the most common type, having been associated with everything from demons and magical faeries to Vulcans. In Japan, the ability to hear extremely well is called jigokumimi, which translates to "hell ears".

In Japanese Manga and Anime, cat ears (_nekomimi_) and other types of animal ears (_Little Bit Beastly_) are particularly popular. Expect some Furry Ear Dissonance. Another common anime ear type is "antenna ears," which can be seen primarily on Robot Girls.

It's, "Your ears; are they real?" whilst reaching up and touching them. As does Kagome's little brother; it appears to be something of a family thing.

-   A manga story based on _Tamagotchi_ depicts Yumemitchi with abnormally stretchy ears that she uses to catch a ball and as wings to fly with. This is the only time in the franchise that she demonstrates this (makes sense, as this specific manga story is All Just a Dream).

    Tabletop Games 

-   In the _LARP_ campaign set "Isole Del Cielo" (Island of the Sky), some races have Unusual Ears. Dremmach have furry ears, while Arno have big, pointed ears, with big earrings. Those are needed to calibrate the magic perception sense, so that Arno can feel a single kind of magic, instead of every kind at the same time (that would be uncomfortable). Underworld LARP has Savar and Wolven (cat and dog/wolf people respectively) who wear unusual ears as part of their costume.

-   _Mega Man_: All of the Reploids in _Mega Man Zero_ and cyborgs in _Mega Man ZX_ seem to have these strange white headphone-like things instead of human ears, which is strange, considering that the _Classic_ series had proper ears, despite being _much_ less advanced. Certain Robot Masters tend to have these ears, such as Metal Man and Turbo Man.

    -   Narumi has oversize ears, reflecting her origin as a jizo statue.
