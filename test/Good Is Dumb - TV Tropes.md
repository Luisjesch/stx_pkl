_"So, Lone Starr, now you see that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb."_

A common recurring thread in fiction is the idea that the hero, for various reasons, will engage in stupid or illogical actions largely because it is the "heroic", sometimes idealistic thing to do. Also an exaggerated form of For Great Justice. This index catalogues the tropes that manifest this phenomenon.

Compare Good Is Not Nice and Evil Is Petty. Contrast with Good Is Not Dumb, and its Evil Counterpart, Stupid Evil. This trope is not to be confused with Dumb Is Good... you dummy.
