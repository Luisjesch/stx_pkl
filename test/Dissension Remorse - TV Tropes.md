Let's say there are teammates, two or more, who are having trouble getting along with each other and it got so bad that a fierce argument breaks out, or better yet, the argument leads into a fight between them. As a few minutes pass, they start to realize the dissension between them and feel bad about it. One of them will ask, "What are we fighting about?".

Perhaps their infighting has jeopardized their mission, causing the villain to succeed in conquering the world. Perhaps their fighting has led another of their teammates, usually the one who brings the group together, into harm's way. Maybe the teammates realize that they're lowering themselves in fighting each other. Whatever the reason, they feel bad about it and this will lead them to learn An Aesop about friendship and working together.

This trope can also apply to close friends, family members (usually siblings), and lovers. They will learn to realize that their arguing and fighting is tearing their relationship apart and is hurting them on the inside. That said, this will follow up with a reconciliation of their relationship. Characters who witness the dissension between others will invoke this trope by call them out on their fighting, deeming them to be trivial.

Keep in mind that this trope doesn't always have to involve characters immediately feeling remorse for their conflict. Sometimes, the realization will happen over time, usually serving as a part of Character Development for both parties. On the other hand, if something bad happens to one of the characters before the remorse sets in, it can lead to Parting-Words Regret.

A subtrope to My God, What Have I Done?. This is often done in a Feud Episode or a Break-Up/Make-Up Scenario. Often the step for characters to become Fire-Forged Friends.
