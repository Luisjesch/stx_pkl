In real life, plants are important in nature. They provide oxygen, pollen for bees, and food for herbivores, and they make your garden look nice.

In fiction, however, things can get much more diverse and much, much stranger. Fantasy and sci-fi writers like to create their own unique plants with bizarre appearances and properties. Some may be carnivorous, fast-growing, explosive, springy, fiery, or even sentient.

You get the idea. They're _very_ strange plants. They may be magic or found on alien planets or in other dimensions. If someone can control these things watch out.

In some cases, they don't have to be any particularly wild properties, and are more or less just analogues for real plants or fruit, but they're still called something fantastic. If unusual-looking plants or plant analogues make up a large portion of the background flora, this can overlap with Alien Landmass.

And yes, although they aren't technically plants, fungi are included here, too.

-   _Tooth and Claw_: There are "mineral gardens" where plants made of stone and metal somehow grow. Their "flowers" appear to be gemstones.
-   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: As in mythology the plant Moly is a defense against enchantments and magic and is planted around Circe's cell to keep her contained.

    Fairy Tales 

-   "Jorinde and Joringel": The main character finds a strange crimson flower which can be used to nullify magic spells.
    
    Joringel went away, and at last came to a strange village; there he kept sheep for a long time. He often walked round and round the castle, but not too near to it. At last he dreamt one night that he found a blood-red flower, in the middle of which was a beautiful large pearl; that he picked the flower and went with it to the castle, and that everything he touched with the flower was freed from enchantment; he also dreamt that by means of it he recovered his Jorinda.  
    In the morning, when he awoke, he began to seek over hill and dale if he could find such a flower. He sought until the ninth day, and then, early in the morning, he found the blood-red flower. In the middle of it there was a large dew-drop, as big as the finest pearl.
    
-   "The Turnip Princess": The prince stabs one seemingly ordinary turnip which he apparently randomly finds. Then the turnip breaks in two, showing the magic nail which the prince was searching for, and a relief of a beautiful maiden in its hollow rind.

    Fan Works 

-   _Contraptionology!_: While under the influence of the Nightmare, Applejack creates a giant dark-leaved, dark-wooded apple tree that embodies the cosmic concept of Constancy. It cannot be altered in any way — it plainly cannot be cut, uprooted, or moved, but neither does it grow or reproduce. When Ponyville is rebuilt at the end of the story, they simply have to plan the new town hall around it. It also produces a crop of seedless apples each Nightmare Night — it doesn't grow them, as such; rather, they're just sort of there between one day and the next — with golden skin and black, chocolate-sweet pulp, which if distilled into cider induces intense nostalgia for good times gone by and the feeling that things would be so much better if they just... stopped changing for a bit.
-   _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_: Smurfnip, which is the Smurf version of cannabis.
-   _The Flower's Dream_: The "very special flower" whose dream created the breezies' world is sapient, a lucid dreamer, and capable of eating — it sends itself back to sleep by stuffing itself with the pollen of other flowers.
-   _It's A Dangerous Business, Going Out Your Door_: Magivascular plants are a small group of plants that have a secondary vascular system that draws magic instead of nutrients or water, resulting in innately magical organisms. Examples include the beneviolet (a very powerful Healing Herb) and the canon poison joke (a flowering weed that causes a random, sadistically humorous transformation in whoever touches it).
-   _Nobledark Imperium_: Necromunda, much like in canon, was originally a wasteland of a planet consisting of immense hyper-dense Hive Cities amidst continent-spanning expanses of slag heaps, exhausted strip mines, ash deserts and fields of toxic sludge, beneath skies choked with smog and toxic gases. This left the planet with a persistent food problem, which an ancient governor tried to address by commissioning the Adeptus Biologicus to scour the galaxy for any kind of plant that could be made to grow on the planet. The result was a mengaerie of flora, Earthborn and alien and of unclear origin alike, selected from a double dozen worlds and mainly of the kinds found growing around volcanoes or on Venus-like planets. The AdBio then spent decades crossbreeding the chimeric ecosystem they had created until they were able to create hybrid alien plants that could actually produce food; none of it tastes remotely tolerable but it can be processed down in edible slurries with most of the flavor removed and that's sufficient for the planet's needs.
-   _Rocketship Voyager_. The Air Garden is used to grow food and recycle the air on the eponymous rocketship. These include vegetables grown to large size via cobalt irradiation, and a Soviet bioengineered _triffidus_ (albeit a less lethal variety used for pest control).
-   _Shining and Sweet_: Moondew sap can turn someone to stone. For unknown reasons, King Hippo is immune to this plant's effects.

    Films — Animation 

-   Appropriately, _Fantastic Planet_ is filled with this. In fact, much of planet Ygam's plantlife barely qualify as plants at all!
-   _Titan A.E._: The broken moon of Sessharrim, homeworld of the Gaoul, has its main land mass surrounded by hydrogen trees. These emerge from the water with twisted and gnarled trunks that carry globes of hydrogen gas. Tearing one of these globes begets a fiery explosion, some of which take out hostile Drej spaceships.
-   _Zootopia_: The Night Howlers' ability to induce savagery in any animal is central to the plot. The flowers are distilled into a Psycho Serum that is used to target predators which allows Bellwether to rise in power.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Adele Hasn't Had Her Dinner Yet_: The villainous Gardener grew many fantastic plants: A flower with human-like eyes that sheds tears; a flower with pollen that makes people freeze on spot immediately; a rose that can pour tea from a pot to cups, or cut its own rosebud with a pair of scissors and give it to a lady as a present. He also cultivated fast-sprouting beans used to rob apartments or a rose that puts ladies into deep sleep, used to invoke a very sinister scheme. The highlight of his devilish greenhouse is a carnivorous plant Adele that eats sausages, mice, dogs and people.
-   _Big Top Pee-wee_: The title character is cultivating a hot dog tree, which is technically a bush, but does somehow grow hot dogs. Halfway through the movie he makes a mistake and the hot dogs shrink, giving him one that grows cocktail wieners.
-   _Nightbooks_: The Apartment has a "night garden", a room full of magical plants that glow and are grown under blacklight, because real sunlight is toxic to them. They're watered with things like animal blood and are ingredients in magical spells and potions.
-   _Revenge of the Sith_: The planet Felucia is covered in jungles of blue-green, twisting, bioluminescent plants and tree-sized purple mushrooms.

    Literature 

-   _Aralorn_: The coralis tree attracts butterflies with its blossoms, then closes the petals above them and digests them.
-   In _Harry Potter_, there are various fantastic plants, such as the mandrake roots that look like human beings and can kill people with their cry, the gillyweed, that helps Harry breathe underwater, and the plant _Mimbulus Mimbletonia_ which Neville is given as a gift and brings to school. The Hogwarts curriculum dedicates a major class to studying magical flora.
-   _Inheritance Cycle_: A group of spirits transforms a lily into precious metals, including a golden stem, silver-wire hairs, white gold petals, and other flower organs carved from rubies. Eragon and Arya discover that the metal flower is _still alive_, and Arya hypothesizes that it's also fertile and capable of producing seeds that might grow into more golden lilies, though this is never confirmed.
-   _The Mysterious Benedict Society_: Unusual plants play a large part in the adventures, thanks in part to Sticky's particular talent for recognizing the obscure plants he's read about in his books.
    -   In the first book, he discovers the traps on Nomansan Island thanks to them being hidden by drapeweed, a rare shade-loving type of ivy. Later, it's Sticky's having spotted a patch of "wild chuck-root" (_Euphorbia upchucuanhae_) that helps the group in their plans, when they use it to give a bellyache to everyone in the Institute so that Reynie and Sticky can get their turns in the Whisperer sooner.
    -   _The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Perilous Journey_ is focused largely around Mr. Benedict and his evil twin's attempts to acquire another rare plant, duskwort, which has the potential to cure their narcolepsy when mixed when other substances. In its normal form, however, it's an extremely potent plant that, when burned, releases smoke that can put entire villages to sleep, but it only thrives under very specific conditions. However, it it easily overtaken by thwart-wort, a clever mimic that looks just like it, but has none of the same useful chemical properties.
-   _Skylanders: The Mask Of Power_: Hurrikazam owns the only known Amazing, Fantastic, Incredible, Suprising, Unfathomable, All-Coloured Rose in existence, a flower that is the deepest most vibrant red, before switching to deep vibrant blue, before yellow, and so on. As it turns out, it's so in-tune with life, the undead segment of the mask went into its seed.
-   _The Stormlight Archive_: The world of Roshar is entirely dominated by the massive Highstorms, violent hurricanes which every few days scour the land to bare rock. In the face of this, Roshar's vegetation has become more analogous to coral or sea anenomes than terrestrial vegetation, extending leaves or tendrils when the weather is fair and then retracting them when danger threatens. For example, the main food grain of Roshar is something called lavis, which, instead of growing a head of grain the way terrestrial grain does, possesses a head-sized shell of stone-like substance within which the grains grow, suspended in a sand-like medium.
-   _The Thrawn Trilogy_: The hallways of the New Republic's headquarters on Coruscant are lined with potted ch'hala trees with transparent bark that, when touched, flare with red ripples that move outward from the point of contact. This turns out to be plot relevant. It is the key to a recording device that detects sound waves using the same concept.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Pathfinder_: Numerous magical plants exist, in addition to the game's roster of Plant People and carnivorous plants:
    -   Eruphytes are plants that became hosts to minds or souls cast loose from their bodies or the afterlife, becoming intelligent, telepathic and possessed of Psychic Powers.
    -   Rampant plants are ones that channelled the energies of the Positive Energy Plane and survived, transforming into fonts of unchecked growth — any regular plant within a mile of them starts to grow at three times its normal rate.

    Video Games 

-   _Beastieball_: By trope definition, the various mushrooms count as this, growing practically anywhere and when picked, regrow immediately. One variety even suddenly springs from the ground and forms a net whenever an outdoor Beastieball match starts up.
-   _Bug Fables_ has several plants brought to life from the magic of crystals, usually seen in the form of enemies. The common Seedling family and the bug-eating Chomper family are the most recurring types of living plants.
-   _Dragon Blaze 2000_: The forest level is filled with giant plants larger than the players' dragon steed, and loads and loads of plant-based enemies which can shoot their spores as attacks, from Foul Flower to Fungus Humongous and Venus flytraps that can spill bullets.
-   _Eternal Sonata_ has the Heaven's Mirror, a flower that hides in its buds during the daylight and releases it all in a brilliant display at exactly 2 A.M. in the morning, symbolic of the playable character Polka, and the time of death of the famous real-life composer and playable character Frederic Chopin. There's also the Simile flower, which only blooms with water from Simile Spring, but wilts if you water it with regular water.

Wonderland has flowers that drop improved items when given a specific item and plants that summon treasure chests when Thunder is cast on them. The series also has Heartless based on plants.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_: Multiple plants — voltfruit, numerous wildflowers, swift and endura carrots and fleet-lotus seeds — and various supernatural species of mushroom provide buffs when cooked into food, ranging from increased strength or physical energy to the ability to withstand elemental extremes.

-   _Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition_: The Lost Grove features bizarre plants with pulsating globular net structures that would be more at home in a sci-fi film such as _Avatar_.
-   _Ori and the Will of the Wisps_: The Luma Pools area has fluorescent pink vegetation, which is quite a jarring contrast with the more mundane flora of the rest of the game.
-   _Pikmin_ series: There are a few bizarre plants on PNF-404, with the Pikmin themselves being part-plant creatures themselves. Candypop Buds in particular are giant (compared to the characters) flowers that are somehow capable of transforming the type of Pikmin thrown in.

-   _Temtem_: The world is filled with all sorts of weird and wonderful plants, such as glowing reeds shaped like question marks, and trees with spiralling trunks.
-   _Terraria_ has feiry plants that grow in the ash of the Underworld, trees made of stone and gems that grow underground, and variations of otherwise normal trees and plants when hit with any of the three "Infecting" Biomes. The Corruption turns trees in to "Ebonwood," the Crimson to "Shadewood," and the Hallow to "Pearlwood." Seven types of magic herbs can also be gathered that are used in potion making.
-   _Voyage Inspired By Jules Verne_: The plants on the moon come in a variety of vibrant colours, and all seem to be predatory in nature, and quite hostile to anyone who approaches them. They also seem to be averse to certain types of each other, which the Selenites utilize to be able to walk among them without being attacked.
-   _Waking Mars_ is basically this trope: The Game. You as the player character grow and study increasingly unusual plant species in Lethe Cavern below the surface of Mars, though as your AI companion is quick to remind you, they're technically not plants.
-   _The Wolf and the Waves_: Two of the ingredients the player character needs to craft the cure are a "titan stalk" and a "giant bloom" which are the same size as a human.

    Web Original 

-   _Serina_:
    -   Towertrees are massive trees of the sunflower lineage that have converged upon the niche of redwoods and grow their branches in a unique pattern resembling a spiral staircase.
    -   The cementrees of the Hothouse Age are plants whose symbiotic ant colonies build mounds around them in order to protect the trees from thorngrazers and the like, heaping material until they reach maturity at 40 feet tall. While initially simply made of clay, as the tree grows and the colony gets more established, the mound is further shored up by cellulose from dead plant matter nearby, clay, grains of sand, and ant feces, giving it the strength and durability of hempcrete. By the late Hothouse, the cementrees have further evolved to become massive structures known as sky islands, essentially terrestrial reefs comprised of thousands of trees that can range from separated groups only tens of feet wide to massive constructions that go for hundreds if not _thousands_ of miles and go more than two miles above sea level. Even the individual trees of a sky island can get as tall as a skyscraper.
    -   Clam daisies are ground-dwelling plants living 300 million years post-establishment that have evolved large, stone-like leaves to protect themselves against harmful UV radiation due to the destruction of Serina's magnetosphere, giving them their namesake appearance.
    -   The wandering spiderweed of the longdark swamp 290 million years post establishment is a parasitic plant that is so thigmotactic that it's capable of climbing around (Albeit at slow scales) and is essentially biologically immortal.

-   _The Dragon Prince_: In "The Crown", the flora encountered in the Moonshadow Forest include musical lilies and foul-smelling "fart flowers".
-   _Dragon Tales_ has dragonberries, which all of the characters love eating. Also, Dragon Land is loaded with unusual plants in general — the third season story "A Small Victory" features all of the main characters (and guest Lorca) searching for unusual flowers. The plants seen on the page picture are dande-lions, which can roar like real lions but otherwise are basically just extremely large dandelions.
-   _Gravity Falls_: In "The Land Before Swine", several characters end up in a cavern full of prehistoric life forms trapped in — and recently released from — amber. Soos examines one such life form, a group of pinkish flowers, which produces a powerful acrid smell.
    
    **\[happily\]** This little fella smells like battery acid!  
    **\[the plant releases a cloud of dull yellow vapor into Soos' face with a coughing sound; Soos cringes\]**  
    **\[equally happily\]** Looks like I lost my sense of smell. Ha ha ha!
    
-   _JoJo's Circus_ has merryberries, which JoJo is allergic to. Eating them causes her nose to swell and honk and her skin to turn pink and tingly. There's also the itchy ootchy scratch plants, which are basically a fast-acting fantastic flora version of poison ivy. When JoJo and Skeebo fall into a patch of these, they start itching all over.
-   _The Lone Ranger (1966)_ makes use of this in "Forest of Death", in which Tonto has to go after a mad botanist who wants to conquer the West with mutant plants he's bred. Some of the highlights include: lilies that release clouds of deadly poison when they open, a _literal_ strangler vine, mangrove trees with hands on their roots that try to drown victims, cacti with instant-death poison on their needles that grow to maturity in seconds, lotuses that spit barbed dart-like seedpods (which grow into new lotuses within seconds of impact), and a giant, carnivorous flower that almost makes a meal out of Tonto. Ironically, the one plant experiment he _failed_ at was his efforts to breed a Plant Person: his army of "treemen" turns out to be nothing but hired thugs in thick tree costumes.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   "Bridle Gossip": The "leaves of blue" Zecora tries to warn the Mane Six about turn out to be the source of their strange conditions in the second half of the episode. The leaves belong to a patch of Poison Joke, a plant which causes humorous, often ironic afflictions on those who come in contact with it.
    -   "The Cutie Pox" features two: Heart's Desire is a plant with heart-shaped flowers that can, if eaten, grant someone their greatest desire. The Seeds of Truth are another flower that only grows when true words are spoken, and which can undo the effects of Heart's Desire.
    -   "Family Appreciation Day": The older members of the Apple family are busy preparing to harvest Zap Apples, a magical variety of apple tree that only grows its rainbow-colored fruit, used to make Sweet Apple Acres' famous Zap Apple Jam, after a series of ominous signs (including a lightning storm and swarms of crows).
    -   "Princess Spike": Dragon-sneeze trees grow large flowers that induce violent, fiery sneezing fits in dragons.
    -   "A Health of Information": The plot is precipitated by the effects of a flowering tree whose pollen induces Swamp Fever, a sickness that begins with annoying but harmless effects (spotting and coughing up bubbles), develops more serious symptoms (sneezing out lighting bolts) and ultimately sees the afflicted person sprout branches and turn into another tree of the same species.
    -   "Growing Up Is Hard to Do": Twilight and Fluttershy are studying a mysterious flower that can grant wishes, at the cost of needing to consume a petal for each wish granted.
-   _PB&J Otter_: Numerous, including babbleberries, pompalopes, pompanuts and giggle melons. Most of these are just fantasy equivalents of real-world plants, but the giggle melons actually make you giggle when you eat them.
-   _The Save-Ums!_ has a couple in Wave World, including Wave Melons (which are like watermelons, only the inside is blue instead of pink) and Silly Sea Sammies (flowers resembling daisies that have faces and giggle).
-   _Star Trek: Lower Decks_:
    -   Assuming the holodeck's rendition of the Adashake Center applies to the whole planet, Orion foliage is teal instead of green like on Earth, and the tree trunks are pink.
    -   Most of the vegetation on the Galardonian homeworld is maroon, brown or purple, although there are some green plants. The tree trunks are either grey or blueish-grey, and there are green bulbs with grey spots growing on them.
    -   On Tulgana IV, the brown Kitalia leaves contain a numbing agent, the trees at the park have blueish-purple leaves, and their trunks have purple protrusions.
    -   "Moist Vessel": Alien vegetation grows all over the _Cerritos_ and the _Merced_ as the ships are being terraformed.
-   _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_:
    -   The surface of Saleucami is dominated by forests of coral-like plants in tapering, conifer-like shapes and tall, horsetail-like stems. In "The Deserter", a farm on the planet grows fields of giant purple flowers and plants with leafless stems ending in rounded bulbs.
    -   The swamps of Dathomir are dominated by trees whose trunks grow as gnarled and branchless arcs from whose tips dangle large red pods hanging from long, thin tendrils.
    -   "Nomad Droids": Pattitite Pattuna is dominated by tall trees each topped with a pair of perforated, shell-like leaves, floating clusters of reddish lumps trailing long roots into the air, and wide fields of "grass" with stems dotted with pink, lilac and blue globes.
    -   Umbara's surface is blanketed by strange plants with leafless, twisting stems dotted with luminescent patches.
    -   Onderon is covered by jungles of trees with light purple leaves and cyan trunks.
-   _ToddWorld_: "Garden Variety Pickle" features the kids in the main cast and Todd's dog Benny making an abandoned lot into a garden. They plant things like glitter flowers, which can eat rocks, and a tree with several different types of dog biscuits. None of these, however, are the focus of the story. This instead goes to a small scraggly weed with no unusual properties that Pickle is caring for because he finds it beautiful, the story having An Aesop about respecting how different things are beautiful to different people.

    Real Life 

-   There have been studies to guess the color of the pigments used for photosynthesis that alien plants could have depending of what kind of star their planets would be orbiting. Planets orbiting hotter stars than the Sun would have plants of red, orange, and yellow colors and those around cooler ones would have plants of darker colors, up to and including black.
