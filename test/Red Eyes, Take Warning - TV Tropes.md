**Tak:** I'm Tak of the Pupununu People. You are the good guys aren't you?  
**SpongeBob SquarePants:** Sure! It's the beady red eyes that are a dead giveaway for the evil fellows.

An easy way to tell a villainous (or sinister) character apart from the protagonists, other than giving them a Red Right Hand, is making their eyes red. If they don't start out evil, there's a chance they become so over time or perform full-blown Face–Heel Turn. It's not the same thing as the "red eye" phenomenon in photos, but if cameras could detect evil, or danger these would be the first people they'd catch.

Even those who aren't truly evil or dangerous are often thought to be so by characters In-Universe.

In the progressive algorithm of "Uh-Oh" Eyes we have:

Supernatural Gold Eyes < Red Eyes, Take Warning < Hellish Pupils < Glowing Eyes of Doom

Those with glowing red eyes are almost without exception thoroughly evil or, at least, on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge or filled with Unstoppable Rage. The "almost" section goes to those whose red eyes serve as a marker for their Elemental Powers, since Fire Is Red typically or they’re Playing with Fire. Albino characters with red eyes may suffer from this association with evil; see Albinos Are Freaks.

If the character can control others and brings their red eye color with them, it may then overlap with Eye-Dentity Giveaway.

A subtrope of Technicolor Eyes. Compare Glamour Failure, Red Is Violent, Creepy Blue Eyes. Contrast Red Is Heroic.

Not to be confused with being worried about a late-night airline flight (which would probably fall under Plane Awful Flight), or with the film _Red Eye_ (which is about such a flight), or with the liquor. Sometimes a part of Burning with Anger, and thus a harbinger of wrath from the Seven Deadly Sins wrath.

**It should be noted that this trope is NOT just for characters who have eyes of this color, but when the color actually indicates the character is evil or dangerous, or has the Face of a Thug because of their eye color. Please do not add characters who just happen to have eyes of this color without the proper reason behind it.**

    Asian Animation 

-   _BoBoiBoy_:
    -   When BoBoiBoy Lightning is brought to his Rage Breaking Point, he unlocks his Next Tier Power-Up, BoBoiBoy Thunderstorm, who casts a sudden, piercing red glare upon the villains when he's brought out. Thunderstorm is easily one of BoBoiBoy's most fearsome forms, with his sheer speed, power and ruthlessness.
    -   Season 2 introduces Fang as the main cast's relatively new classmate, who has red eyes and glasses which appear to have a red glowing tint in the dark. He's aloof, arrogant and has a power band like each of the main characters, and the one who provides such power sources, Ochobot, faints at the sight of him. This makes the heroes wary of him, and it doesn't help that Fang sees BoBoiBoy as an obstacle to his quest for popularity, which has led him to team up with the heroes' enemies at times. It's subverted later on, however, as he eventually befriends the heroes and proves to be well-meaning. However, his red eyes do foreshadow that he's not exactly human.
    -   BoBoiBoy Fire has crimson irises with yellow rings (and sometimes he has Fireball Eyeballs), and he tends to be a violent Mood-Swinger who is very destructive when angry.
-   _Boonie Bears_: In Season 2 episode 10, those who are within hearing range of the magic flute when it's played on the sun setting become violently aggressive, with their eyes turning red to indicate this.
-   _Happy Heroes_: In the last episode of Season 8, Huo Haha's pupils turn red when he finally has all of Xiao Haha's magic staffs and becomes much more powerful with them.
-   In the _Lamput_ episode "Signs", when the police officer has finally had enough of Fat Doc and Slim Doc disregarding the "no \[whatever\]" signs they come across one too many times, his eyes turn red.
-   In _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf: Joys of Seasons_ episode 6, Tibbie's eyes turn red when she gets angry at Weslie, Paddi, and Sparky for accidentally covering her in fire extinguisher foam.
-   In the _Simple Samosa_ episode "Sumo Momo", when Samosa is fighting Sumo Momo and finally snaps from him breaking the tip on his head, his pupils go red as he gives him a No-Holds-Barred Beatdown.

    Comic Strips 

-   These aren't a constant for any character in _Candorville_, but most vampires can activate and deactivate them at will. The only exception so far is Saxon, who gets Milky White Eyes either because of his Dhampyr status or because he's a Friendly Neighborhood Vampire.
-   _Garfield_:
-   Al Capp's _Li'l Abner_ strip had the Nogoodniks, which were the evil version of the Shmoos. They were a sickly shade of green and had "li'l red eyes". They devoured "good" Shmoos, were the sworn enemies of "hoomanity," and wreaked havoc on Dogpatch.

    Fan Works 

## General

-   Fan Vids and fanart that present Elsa from _Frozen_ as evil or generally violent very frequently give her red eyes, rather than her normal Icy Blue Eyes. Glowing Eyes of Doom are a common alternative but red eyes are used more.

His originally-dark eyes turn crimson when he wants to visibly show others that he's deadly serious. The remastered version switches his eye colour to permanently claret red, like spilled blood, just to amplify the sinister vibe.
    
    **Narration from the remastered version:** His red eyes were dull, and yet they held a cruel light to them that shone with warning against all sentient life.
    

Fusion Fic

-   _Children of an Elder God_ (Cthulhu Mythos & _Neon Genesis Evangelion_): When Rei got jealous in chapter 4, her red eyes glowed for a split-second. Touji and Kensuke were utterly scared out of their wits when they saw it.

Later, he tries looking in again, but he can only see something red through the keyhole. Not able to stand the questions any longer, he asks the hotel clerk what's wrong with the room. She tells him that, years ago, a couple died inside, and they tended not to mention it to avoid upsetting guests. She also mentions that the couple had unusually red eyes.

    Toys 

-   Zigzagged throughout _BIONICLE_, as the eye colors of the characters are all over the place, especially in the earlier years, though there are few straight/inverted cases:
    -   Naturally, the original Big Bad, Makuta Teridax, also had his trademark red eyes (which he liked to project into shadowy corners), (though in his original set form he had blue eyes with red sclerae),as did many of his brethren, as well as some other villains in the toyline (Krekka, Sidorak, Piraka, Keelerak spiders, etc.). Some, however, eventually substituted orange for red, when the eye colors became Colour-Coded for Your Convenience.
    -   In the movie _Bionicle: Web of Shadows,_ Toa Vakama inverts this: he has red eyes _until_ he goes over to The Dark Side, at which point, his eyes turn green. His toy, on the other hand, always had green eyes.
    -   The evil Roodaka from the same movie had blue eyes normally, but when she got really angry, they turned bright orange/red.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Code:Realize_, glowing red eyes are a sign that the person in question is under the influence of Hidden Strength, a process which uses physical and emotional torture to unlock greatly enhanced physical abilities and leave them Brainwashed and Crazy.
-   _Danganronpa_:
    -   _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_:
        -   Celestia Ludenberg fits this trope, since while they seem helpful and sweet in the beginning of the game, eventually she ends up responsible for two murders, and showed no mercy for it unlike the previous two murderers. Of course, even before that, she was pretty cutthroat and has always been a good liar.
        -   Kiyotaka Ishimaru technically fits - even though he never makes a Face–Heel Turn, his red eyes are a predicator for when he (possibly) absorbs Mondo's spirit and becomes the loud and aggressive Kiyondo Ishida — although even then it's a bit of a fake-out, as despite his more aggressive mode of speech he's just as harmless as Ishida as he was before. Unfortunately — and perhaps partially thanks to this trope — it's enough along with Celeste's manipulation to convince Hifumi that he needs to be put down for the good of the group.
    -   From _Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair_, Peko Pekoyama, the Ultimate Swordswoman has a very noticeable bright red color to her eyes. She's also something of a Perpetual Frowner and yes she is a dangerous individual, being a hitman for the Kuzuryu Clan of yakuza.
    -   In _Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony_, Maki Harukawa is an uncooperative and brutally honest girl who's actually the Ultimate Assassin. Gonta Gokuhara, on the other hand, has red eyes and is a Gentle Giant (unless people insult bugs), but he ends up being manipulated into committing murder to Mercy Kill his classmates.
-   Wilhelm from _Dies Irae_ is perhaps one of the most depraved villains in the story, and being an albino, he has bright red eyes. And the more and more he get's into a fight, the more his eyes start to glow and and take on Black Eyes of Crazy on top of it. This is especially noticeable when compared with the other albino of the cast, Claudia, who have golden eyes instead and is kindhearted to a fault.
-   The dragonslayer's armor in _Dra+Koi_ has glowing red eyes, suitable for its role as the sort-of antagonist.
-   Solidly averted in _Katawa Shoujo_ with Akira Satou, Lilly's easygoing Cool Big Sis. Well, there _is_ the fact that she's quite happy to supply Hisao, Lilly and Hanako, who are minors, with alcohol.
-   _Nasuverse_: A number of characters in the franchise have red eyes, and while it's rarely commented on in-story, a common thread is that all red eyed characters are supernaturally powerful in some manner. Characters like Gilgamesh or Cu Chulainn have divine blood, and their red eyes are an indicator of that. Vampires of all types have red eyes, and people turned into vampires will gain red eyes.

    -   The camera has a tendency to zoom in on Emerald's vivid red eyes whenever she's tapping into her mind control powers, which bodes ill for the target of her power. She can make a target perceive anything she wants, and all the senses are fooled, not just sight. Emerald's abilities are the main reason why Cinder is so successful in destroying Beacon Academy and becoming the next Fall Maiden. She enables Amber to be ambushed by making Amber think there's a crying child in need of help, and ensures Amber has troubling seeing exactly where Cinder, Mercury and herself are during their fight even when looking straight at them. She also fools Yang into seeing and hearing Mercury attack her from behind after their tournament ends, resulting in Yang appearing to the watching world as though she's attacked a badly injured and defeated Mercury for absolutely no reason. This disqualifies Team RWBY from the tournament.

-   Zigzagged in _Critical Role_. Mollymauk's eyes are entirely red, lacking both a pupil and an iris. This in itself doesn't actually mean much; Molly's red eyes are due to his tiefling heritage, and while he can be abrasive, he is a genuinely nice person. What _is_ strange are the nine red eye tattoos placed randomly across his body, especially since Molly himself woke up with complete amnesia about two years prior to the start of the story and has no idea where they came from. It's not until the final arc of the story, months after Mollymauk's death, that the Mighty Nein encounter Lucien, the person Molly was before losing his memory.
