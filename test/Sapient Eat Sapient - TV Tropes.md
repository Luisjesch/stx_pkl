## **Please note that all _sapient_ animals are people, but not all _sentient_ animals are people.**

_"If I'm gonna eat somebody, it might as well be you."_

On the Sliding Scale of Anthropomorphism, one of the first aspects to be added and the last to be removed after sentience is sapience. Whether they walk on two legs or four, whether they speak or grunt, a cartoon animal will show some level of human intelligence. So when a sapient animal is intending to _eat_ another sapient animal, a certain kind of drama arises.

While this does not strictly count as cannibalism (such as a talking wolf eating a talking sheep), anthropomorphism by definition puts an animal on a level of humanity that the audience is meant to identify with. An intelligent animal ceases to be an environmental hazard and becomes a character. "That bear is trying to eat that rabbit" transitions very quickly to "That man is trying to eat that little girl" when the audience identifies with both bear and rabbit. This makes a very short road to Predators Are Mean, particularly if the predator takes the time to taunt its prey with their intended fate, or if they decide to be 'sporting' and invoke Hunting the Most Dangerous Game. People will naturally wonder why are sapient animals any different in rights than humans, and predators that don't kill their prey swiftly and painlessly will come across as consciously cruel if not outright sadistic for knowingly hurting creatures with the same rights as them.

There are generally three scenarios where this trope can come into play, based on the involvement of humanity:

-   In a world run by humans with Nearly Normal Animals or Civilized Animals, only the audience and human characters will be informed of the animals' impending doom, and blatant Animal Talk will prevent the animals from finding out their fate. (Unless perhaps a precocious child who Speaks Fluent Animal tells them.) If the animals _do_ find out, this can add an element of drama.
-   In a setting where humans are either completely nonexistent, or not directly involved, or are otherwise placed alongside Funny Animals and any manner of humanoid creatures and aliens. This puts all prospective predators and prey on a near-to-level playing field in their given society. Predator and prey can carry on full conversations about how one considers the other fully edible, no matter how they protest. More sympathetic characters can at least go the route of saying that friends are not food, and only _strangers_ are acceptable meals.
-   If humans are ever the designated prey, two sister tropes can also occur. I'm a Humanitarian is when humans are textbook cannibals, eating other humans. To Serve Man is when some other species is preying on humanity.

Likewise, it's possible that the predators have rules about who is, or isn't, on the menu, to say nothing about other things, with the possibility that failing to follow the rules could lead to a murder charge:

-   Children - off the menu for sure.
-   Single Parents without prior arrangements to have someone care for the children - off the menu.
-   Criminals under a Death Sentence, like rapists and murderers - On the Menu for sure!
-   Willing Meals - Sure. But if they decide to change their mind, best to respect it.
-   Terminally Ill, who have been through all of the other options, and nothing works, and they'll die anyways - they might want an end to their pain.
-   Important Jobs - Possibly off the menu, unless they waive the restriction.
-   Safe/Mock Predation - Well, there's possibly a special place for it, like a Den of Iniquity of sorts. Might possibly be modeled after a nice restaurant, like an exclusive or high end club. Or, maybe it's a Casual Kink between friends or lovers, and all that's needed is a dining room table, condiments, seasoning, and a cunning tongue. Getting Eaten Is Harmless might also be involved, when the pretend meal ends up in the predator's stomach for a short period of time, same with a non-fatal form of Hunting the Most Dangerous Game in case the predator wants to engage in a mock hunt.
-   Protecting the victim of a violent crime, like rape or murder - the aggressor ends up in a stomach.
-   Quota/Limit Restriction - a Predator might only be allowed to claim a certain number of a Prey species.
-   Reporting/Fees - Predation might have to be reported by the Predator, and they might have to pay off any debts that the Prey owed.
-   Donated Body - Similar to Organ Donation in real life, it's possible that Prey can check off a box that states that, after they die, usually of causes other than predation, their body can be delivered to a Predator for them to eat, or something similar to that effect.
-   Should Magic or Technology allow for resurrection-type stuff, with the Prey coming back to life, for a reasonable price, getting eaten isn't necessarily a big deal. It could just be another day at the office for the prey, or even a means to get to said office.
-   Lower Class People - likely on the menu.

When a sapient does this pragmatically for reasons beyond mere sustenance, you have Eating the Enemy.

Often a result of Carnivore Confusion or Let's Meet the Meat. See also Predation Is Natural, which is often used in conjunction with this trope in examples where predators are sympathetic. Predator-Prey Friendship is what happens when two characters of this type avoid their instincts and become friends.

Contrast Vegetarian Carnivore, Furry Confusion, and No Cartoon Fish, which each can be used as methods to avert this trope in Carnivore Confusion\-type situations.
