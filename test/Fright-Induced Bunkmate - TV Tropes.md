A character is woken up in the middle of the night by a younger character—typically either a son, daughter, younger sibling or younger friend. The younger character was woken up by something frightening, like a nightmare or a bad storm, and can't quite manage to go back to sleep. They'll meekly ask if they can sleep with the older character, just for that night.

In general, this is used to emphasize the bond the two characters share, whether that is familial, friendly, potentially romantic, or (less commonly) to give an otherwise abrasive or aloof character a Pet the Dog moment. It will probably result in Sleep Cute.

    Anime and Manga 

-   An early episode of _Sekirei_ has Kuu waking up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, and she gets scared by Matsu, whom she mistakes for a ghost due to her creepy smile and Scary Shiny Glasses. This prompts her to run off to Minato's room and cling to him. The next morning, Miya states that she thought Minato had taken Kuu, implying that she slept in his room that night.
-   In an episode of _Sailor Moon R_, Usagi wakes up to find her bed wet and Chibi-Usa sleeping in it. While Usagi is angry about this, Luna assumes it was because Chibi-Usa was scared during the night.

    Comic Books 

-   In _Runaways_, Molly at one point asks if she can bunk with Nico because she's afraid that there are monsters in her room.

-   In _Switch_, Mary's younger brother crawls into bed with her after suffering nightmares related to their encounter with Krono.
-   _Jan, Jans en de Kinderen_: One comic sees all three kids and even Jans herself get frightened by a severe thunderstorm.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Baby Blues_ once ran a series of strips that had Zoe and Hammie constantly crawling into bed with their parents whenever they had a nightmare. The arc ends with Wanda calling the mattress store, asking if they have anything bigger.

Calvin chases after him, but Hobbes scares him witless by using the blanket to make himself into a Bedsheet Ghost. The next panel shows Hobbes enjoying Calvin's bed all by himself, while Calvin...
    
    **Calvin's Dad:** GAAAA! Somebody's feet are like ice!  
    **Calvin's Mom:** Calvin had another nightmare.  
    **Calvin:** If it's too crowded, you guys are welcome to sleep downstairs.

    Fan Works 

-   Played with in the _Sorrowful and Immaculate Hearts_ story "Empty Graves". After a time traveler attempts to assassinate two-year-old Clark Kent, his mother goes to check on him in the middle of the night, and he wakes up. Remembering what it means when he goes to his parents' bedside in the middle of the night, he asks her if she's had a nightmare and if she'd like to sleep in his bed.

-   This is a common Fandom-Specific Plot in the _Frozen_ fandom. Many fanfics feature the sisters going into each other's rooms after a nightmare (usually Anna into Elsa's) or outright having them move into each other's rooms. It's commonly used in order to depict them bonding after a decade of being separated:
    -   The second chapter of _An Arm and a Leg_ has Anna joining Elsa in bed after having a nightmare about Hans murdering Elsa. It brings back memories of the last time they slept in the same bed. When Anna was four, Anna had a Fear of Thunder and asked to sleep in her sister's bed. She ended up staying for three days. On the fourth night she asked to play with Elsa and that is when the accident happened.
-   _More than My Friend_: Played for Laughs. At one point, Bloo gets scared that there's a ghost under his bed, so he goes to sleep in Mac's room... and then they both get scared that there's a ghost under _Mac's_ bed. So they both go to sleep with Frankie... and then get worried that there's a ghost under _her_ bed. So the three go to sleep with Wilt... and then Bloo wonders if the ghost is in his _closet_. The four end up spending the night with Madame Foster.
-   A semi-romantic version of this features in the _Lost Girl_/_Merlin_ crossover _Lost in Camelot_, when Morgana asks to stay with Bo after a particularly troubling 'nightmare' about Bo's past wandering lost and her (unknown to Morgana) future meeting with Kilgharrah, with this night together starting a trend of the two 'platonically' sharing a bed to help Morgana sleep better.
-   The _Codename: Kids Next Door_ one-shot _Safe Haven_ plays with this as when Numbuh 5 has a Catapult Nightmare, she ends up remaining in her room and Cree comforts her after coming in. However, Numbuh 5 is still unsure about falling back asleep and asks Cree to stay with her. Cree, not wanting to lose sleep, decides to sleep in her younger sister's bed for the remainder of the night.

    Films — Animated 

-   In _The Lion King 1 ½_, we see a montage of Simba waking up Timon and Pumbaa in the middle of the night for various reasons. At least once, he wakes them up because of a nightmare. No points for guessing what that nightmare might have been.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Alvin and the Chipmunks_ Films:
    -   In _Alvin and the Chipmunks_, Theodore does this with Dave a little into the chipmunks' stay at his house. While the scene itself is Played for Laughs, it genuinely does turn into heartwarming as Dave reluctantly allows Theodore in and doesn't disturb the chipmunk even when he curls up on top of him rather than staying on his own side of the bed as requested. This is later contrasted with Ian, who throws Theodore out of his room when he makes the same request (despite claiming that he sees the chipmunks as family).
    -   In _The Squeakquel_, Theodore does this with Dave's cousin, who is babysitting the chipmunks while Dave is away. He allows Theodore to sleep with him, but unwittingly traps the chipmunk in a Dutch oven while Theodore desperately tries to find a way out from underneath the covers.

Gretl is the first to reach Maria's room and is quickly followed by the rest of her siblings (except Liesl who had tried to sneak back into the house through Maria's room). Maria sings "My Favorite Things" (replacing "The Lonely Goatherd" from the stage version) to calm the children down.
-   In _Ted_, both Ted and John still have a Fear of Thunder, much to Lori's embarrassment. Early on as John and Lori are sleeping in bed and thunder claps, John readily welcomes Ted on the bed when he scrambles into their room out of fear, with both reciting their "Thunder Buddies" song, much to Lori's annoyance.
-   _2010: The Year We Make Contact_ does a variant on this when Heywood Floyd's spaceship does a harrowing "areo breaking" maneuver around Jupiter, and one of his Russian shipmates, a younger woman, silently comes to his bunk and platonically clings to him.

-   In the _Ramona Quimby_ book _Ramona and Her Mother_, after the Quimby parents have a nasty argument while making dinner, Ramona is too upset to sleep and creeps into her sister Beezus's room, where Beezus lets her spend the rest of the night in her bed and promises to take care of her if their parents divorce.

    Music 

-   Played for Laughs in the _Ninja Sex Party_ song "Attitude City". The first verse has Danny building himself up as his city's revered badass, while the second verse has him engaging in decidedly un-badass behavior, like running to his parents' room whenever he has a bad dream.

In respective order: Lisa asked to bunk with Bart, then Bart and Lisa asked to bunk with Marge and Homer.
    -   The episode "$pringfield" had Lisa waking Homer up in the middle of the night and asking to bunk with him because she's scared of the boogieman. Homer's response?
