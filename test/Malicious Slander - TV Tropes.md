_"A lie can run halfway round the world before the truth has got its boots on."_

Rumor, gossip, tale-bearing. Ever present whenever people talk, and sometimes truly vile. And when they are malicious tales about The Hero, they are an unbounded source of problems for him.

Except in unusual cases, we already know in advance that the tales are false, usually by seeing the true events, or seeing his POV during them so we know his true motives so that the Infallible Babble effect is undermined. We just get to see the character wrestle with — and suffer under — them.

Sometimes the original slanderer can be identified (and sometimes punished), but often enough the hero has to deal with a cloud of unidentifiable nastiness. Who is acting out of malice, and who out of carelessness or indifference to the truth — or even desire to warn — may be ambiguous. It makes being arrested look easy: there, you can get through the trial and be acquitted. And often crucial people are really gullible.

The Hero with Bad Publicity often lives in a cloud of this. Wounded Gazelle Gambit is one way of launching them. Gossipy Hens are always launching or spreading them — with or without malice. The Green-Eyed Monster often inspires slander, The Resenter, No Hero to His Valet and Somebody Doesn't Love Raymond will always agree on slanders, and the envious person may even believe his own slanders. The Decadent Court is rife with it, but even there, the Evil Chancellor is particularly prone to it. In many situations, this helps fuel Divided We Fall. Gossip Evolution doesn't exactly help the situation for any of these. The Propaganda Machine often churns it out. Children are often the butts of the subtrope Loser Son of Loser Dad. Torches and Pitchforks are often stirred up with malicious slander.

When spread intentionally, like in Insidious Rumor Mill, the slanderer often acts with Chessmaster-like precision. Frequently he will tell the entire truth with only a few crucial omissions or alter the import of facts by subtle misrepresentations — knowing that Gossip Evolution will turn the hints into full-blown lies.

Compare Shrouded in Myth for another problem the hero can have with rumors. See also Bearer of Bad News, who may be accused of this, and Propaganda Piece. A Success Through Sex Accusation can potentially be this.

No Real Life examples — suffice to say that _all_ propaganda contains elements of this, but to what extent is highly debatable. Too much chance of Flame Bait — besides which, we don't want _this_ to be a Self-Demonstrating Article. We should note that this trope is not exactly the same as malicious slander/libel/defamation in strictly legal terms; in the law of defamation, "malice" means (in most jurisdictions, including, most importantly,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  the United States) publishing/disseminating false information about another either _knowing_ that the information is false (i.e., saying things you know are not true), or _recklessly disregarding the possibility_ that it is false (i.e. saying things that might or might not be true but which you have no basis for saying, and if they happen to be true, it's an accident). The above standard, commonly known as "actual malice", comes from the 1964 Supreme Court case _New York Times v. Sullivan_ <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and applies mostly to public figures, such as politicians and celebrities. It's why it is extremely hard for a celebrity to win a libel suit in America — one of the few successful suits was one filed by Carol Burnett against the _National Enquirer_ for falsely claiming she had been drinking heavily with Henry Kissinger in 1976. While malice is important in suits against non-public figures, more weight is given to the falsity of the statement and the effect it has on the defamed's reputation. Simply repeating something you heard doesn't generally count, so in general terms, ordinary town gossip isn't going to get you very far in a slander/libel/defamation suit.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  However, mere gossip can be enough to be this trope. Please note, however, that TV Tropes is **not** legal advice and so still proceed with caution.

    Ballads 

-   In the Child Ballad _Sir Aldingar_, when the queen rebuffs the title knight, he puts a leper in her bed and accuses her of adultery to the king.
-   In _The Lord of Lorn and the False Steward_, when the young lord improbably shows up again the service of the duke, the steward posing as him tries slander. It doesn't dislodge him.
    
    _"Will you beleeue me, lady faire,  
    When the truth I doe tell yee?  
    Att Aberdonie, beyond the sea,  
    His father he robbed a hundred three."_
    

    Comic Books 

-   Howard the Duck's enemy Doctor Bong got his start this way. After his mother told him how powerful written word could be, he was able to use slanderous writing to make anyone look bad. (For instance, he was able to make his entire school believe a teacher was some immoral drug fiend, when in fact, said teacher had used an illegal stimulant once in his life.) Exactly how he made the jump from "sleazy teen paparazzi" to "Mad Scientist with a knack for genetics and sonic weapons" is a mystery.
-   A sizable chunk of the drek Spider-Man deals with can be blamed on J. Jonah Jameson's blatant libel in the _Daily Bugle_. He actually once took them to court over it, but unfortunately, his overenthusiastic lawyer then included Peter Parker in the suit.
    -   Spidey's not the only one who has to deal with this. In _Ms. Marvel (1977)_, Carol Danvers is hired by ol' J.J. as the editor of "Woman", and he expects her first issue to be an attack piece on Ms. Marvel, getting pretty irate when Carol doesn't do this (and not just because Carol _is_ actually Ms. Marvel, since she doesn't actually know that).
-   _Wonder Woman (1942)_: The Earth Two Huntress (Helena Wayne) has her very own crooked reporter who insists on twisting the facts and outright lying to try and make Huntress seem like an out of control murderer in a cape despite Helena's very strict no killing or even seriously maiming rule. At one point Dedra Borrower blatantly misquotes a medical examiner on television. She turns to the camera and tells her viewers _There you_ have _it. A man's death due to the unchecked violence of an unsanctioned vigilante_.

    Comic Strips 

-   In one series of _Bloom County_ strips, poor Opus was accused of committing "penguin lust" by Bill the Cat (who had become a televangelical scam artist who called himself "Fundamentally Oral Bill"). Despite never even telling anyone just what "penguin lust" was, Opus became a pariah because of it (so much that the public library revoked his card) and was eventually driven out of Bloom County - until, that is, everyone got bored of Bill and stopped listening. Of course, by then, finding Opus and telling him he could come back was a challenge.

    Fairy Tales 

-   In _The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird_, when the heroine gives birth to three Wonder Children, her sisters steal them and tell her husband that she gave birth to three puppies. He puts her in a treadmill as punishment for not having the children as she claimed she would.
-   In _Dapplegrim_, the king orders the hero to perform many tasks because his fellow servants falsely claimed he said he could do them.
-   In _Esben and the Witch_, an enemy of Esben and his brothers is always telling the king that they claimed to be able to do this or that, and then the king orders them to do it.
-   In _Ferdinand the Faithful_, after being slandered, Ferdinand must get a bride for the king and then all the things she demands before she will marry him.
-   In _The Girl Without Hands_, the Devil intercepts the letter telling the king of the birth of his son, and changes it to say that it was a monster (in The Brothers Grimm's first edition, it had been the king's mother who did it). Doesn't work, actually; the king says she is to be treated kindly, and so he intercepts again to order her and the child's deaths.
-   In _The Grateful Beasts_, Ferko's brothers tell the king that he is a magician, and the king orders Ferko to perform three tasks in atonement; his own daughter the princess argues with him until he imprisons her in a tower.
-   In _Mary's Child_, the heroine's children are taken from her, and rumor says that she killed and ate them.
-   _The One-Handed Girl_:
    -   The heroine's sister-in-law tells her brother that the heroine had refused to sell her a pumpkin, which she sold to others, when in fact the heroine had given her one as a gift and had then run out.
    -   The heroine's brother tells the king and queen that her hand had been chopped off because she was a witch, getting her driven off.
-   In _The Six Swans_, the king's mother kidnaps the heroine's newborn children and tells the king she killed them until he agrees to her execution.
-   In _The Three Little Birds_, when the heroine's sisters steal her children and tell the king that she gave birth to animals, he puts up with it twice and the third time throws his wife in prison.

While Edmund did provide Jadis the information that Tumnus helped Lucy, this was not betrayal as he said it very casually and had no idea this was sensitive information. It didn't matter anyway to Jadis as she used it to successfully break Tumnus's spirit.
-   _Doubt_: The plot revolves around a priest accused of misconduct with a young boy. No hard evidence is discovered to either prove or disprove the charge, fueled entirely by rumors, suspicions, and one nun's conviction of their truth. The priest himself makes a sermon condemning gossip and rumor-mongering, pointing out that even if the rumor is proved to be false it can never be unsaid. Eventually, the implication is that he _was_ guilty, as he agrees to a transfer and coverup once the nun leading the attack reveals that she managed to track down a nun from his last posting who could corroborate the story...except she later reveals that she had never managed to find the old nun at all.
-   _Enemy of the State_: The bad guys' plot involves slandering Will Smith's character by planting a false story about him having an affair and being involved with organized crime in the news. The story causes his massively-gullible bosses to fire him and his wife (who up to that point had been a good, caring person despite her own affair in the past) to throw him out of the house.
-   _First Girl I Loved_: Sasha, under pressure from her mother, claims Anne forcefully kissed her (she actually had initiated it) when a photo surfaces. Her mother threatens to call the police if the photo isn't removed from their yearbook.

-   The film _Gossip_ centers around three roommates who knowingly start a malicious rumor about a classmate in order to track how it spreads and changes for a Communications class.
-   _Guyana: Crime of the Century_: This is how Johnson and his inner circle view the letters sent to Secretary of State by the concerned 75+ relatives of the people who live in Johnsontown and aren't allowed to leave (and many such relatives think that there are concentration camps for forced labour and punishments.
-   _The Hunt (2012)_: Lucas is wrongly accused of being a child molester which quickly ruins his reputation in the Close-Knit Community and sets off a nasty Pædo Hunt.
-   _Little Nicky_: Nicodemus (AKA Little Nicky) is framed for murdering a bunch of people in a five-star restaurant. The massacre wasn't even real. The film is so hideously doctored that a demon behind the times gets the reference:
    
    Nicky: What the heck?! That's just my face plastered in that scene from Scarface!
    
-   Seen in _Mr. Deeds_, when a sensationalist news anchor doctors footage of a rescue to make it look like the rescuer killed a woman's cats before raping her in the street. Why do this with a street full of witnesses (including the aforementioned woman) to testify otherwise? Because as far as news stories went the anchor reasoned "Hero is nice. Depraved and insane is better".

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Downton Abbey_ has this as the driving force behind some of the conflicts, especially when O'Brien and Thomas Barrow are involved.
-   _Game of Thrones_: Tyrion Lannister is often on the wrong end of it. Littlefinger claims that the dagger found on Bran's would-be assassin belonged to Tyrion, starting a conflict that eventually snowballs into the War of the Five Kings.
-   _Little House on the Prairie_: Mrs. Oleson's favorite activity was spreading gossip, and more than once, it crossed the line into malicious gossip big time … especially when her targets were Charles Ingalls and his family, particularly adopted son Albert. Prime examples included a story she printed in the town's newspaper that claimed Charles had snuck around and fathered Albert out of wedlock and, a few seasons later, spun a rumor where Albert got a local girl pregnant.

-   The _Sherlock_ episode "The Reichenbach Fall" revolves around Moriarty gradually destroying Sherlock's credibility, eventually leading the police to suspect that he made every case up just so he would look good when he "solved" them, and ending heartbreakingly with Sherlock's apparent suicide. Quite the depressing episode.
-   _The Society_: Campbell, Harry, Lexie and the Guard all make up a story that Allie plotted to steal the election, which results in them arresting her on this supposed charge. Harry and Lexie are placed in charge as co-mayors, with Campbell running things behind the scenes.
-   In _Wolf Hall_, this is how Anne Boleyn gets disgraced, mainly at the hands of her sister-in-law Lady Jane Rochford—she accuses her husband of having an incestuous affair with Anne, and Thomas Cromwell works up a rationalization to make it plausible for the court.
-   The infamous _Wonder Woman (2011 pilot)_ has it to where Wonder Woman has a press conference to accuse a rival businesswoman of illegally selling steroids with bad side effects, then openly admits she has no proof to back up this claim. Made even worse is the fact she admitted to committing a crime to stop a crime she can't even prove was committed. But thanks to being Loved by All she gets away with this without any legal troubles.

    Music 

-   Qbomb: Part of the story of _HYPERPUNK_. Early on, the singer's band becomes the subject of conflicting rumors, gossip, and "constant toxic shit" that he can't stop.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Genevieve of Brabant, the wife of palatine count Siegfried of Treves, was accused of adultery by a rebuffed would-be lover and had to live in the woods with her son (She had actually been put on death row, but the executioner took pity on her and let her go). Fortunately, she had magical help from a magical roe deer, who helped Fallen Princess Genevieve get food while residing in a cavern. When her husband finds out about the deceit, he goes to search for Genevieve and their kid, and thanks to the roe, he finds them and asks for forgiveness. It's apparently based on the real-life story of Marie of Brabant, only that Marie wasn't as lucky as Genevieve and _did_ end up executed.
-   The Devil roughly translates into "The Slanderer", as opposed to Satan, which is merely "one who opposes".
-   In The Bible, Potiphar's wife accuses Joseph of raping her after he refuses to sleep with her. This continues the chain of events that led him to become Pharaoh's advisor.
    -   Also, Jesus warns His followers that they will be subjected to slander, among other forms of persecution. He also tells them to count it as a blessing.
-   In the Book of Nehemiah, when the wall surrounding Jerusalem was near completion, Sanballat and Geshem try to lure Nehemiah away from his work to have "a little chat", and Nehemiah keeps telling them that he's busy and can't answer their summons. They get to the point of deciding to spread some of this about Nehemiah, that he was planning a rebellion against the king by declaring himself to be king and that he has set up prophets to make the proclamation. Nehemiah responds that he isn't and that they're just making stuff up about him to discourage him and his workers.

    Radio

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Psionics: The Next Stage in Human Evolution_
    -   This tends to happen to espers who turn down or resist a recruitment offer. Did you refuse an offer from The Shop and manage to escape from their agents? In the process, did some of their stray bullets hit passers-by? Now your face, name, and whereabouts are plastered all over the news and you’re wanted by the FBI in connection with a terrorist attack.
    -   Every conspiracy will maliciously slander espers from other conspiracies.
    -   Eschaton paints all espers as demon-possessed abominations. Their own espers are no exception.

    Theater 

-   Used as the main plot device in _The Children's Hour_. At a 1930s all-girls school, a bratty girl mad at her teachers conjures up a lie about them being lesbian lovers. Considering one of them was engaged, and this was the early thirties, it single-handedly ruined their lives.
-   Accusations of witchcraft in _The Crucible_ drive the plot, causing the deaths of many innocent people.
-   In _Hamlet_, Hamlet says to Ophelia "Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny." And Hamlet tests the ghost's words; he appears to fear that the ghost slandered his uncle and mother.
    -   Rule of Symbolism: The older king Hamlet was poisoned by Claudius _Through the ear_! That could very well symbolize the power of malicious slander. In that respect, the trope guides the entire play, because each character is taught to mistrust one another (apart from Horatio, that is).
-   In Richard Wagner's version of _Lohengrin_, female lead Elsa is falsely accused of killing her little brother Gottfried, the child-Duke of Brabant (who had actually been turned into a swan by the Evil Sorceress Ortrud. Then the eponymous Knight in Shining Armor comes to her rescue.

    Visual Novels 

-   Invoked in _Double Homework_ by Dennis’s dad. He threatens to plant evidence to make it look like the protagonist caused the second avalanche if he doesn’t tell him what really happened to Dennis.
-   _Mystic Messenger_: Echo Girl tries to pull this on Jumin and Zen for turning down her romantic advances in one of the routes. Her claim that Zen sexually harassed her nearly tanks his career, although the other rumor (that Jumin is gay) gets shrugged off.
-   In _Sunrider 4: The Captain's Return_, Veniczar Fontana takes every opportunity to smear his Arch-Enemy Kayto Shields, baselessly calling him everything from a murderer of children to a sexual deviant. When he captures Kayto late in the game, his Propaganda Machine paints Kayto as The Quisling to Crow Harbor, claiming that Kayto would have sold the whole galaxy to the time-traveling warlord just to set himself up as the petty dictator of his home planet Cera. The Ceran prime minister Miirage Foster gets in on the slander at the end of the game, warning her people that Kayto is a disgraced, glory-seeking womanizer willing to ally himself with tyrants and monsters in his quest to bring ruin to their world.

-   In _Men in Hats_, Aram takes one of Jeriah's poems, rewrites it to be anti-religious, and passes it along to religious zealot Sam.
-   In _Penny and Aggie_, Charlotte makes a YouTube video accusing Sara of raping her.
-   In _Sunstone_, Alan in college was wrongly accused of being gay and subject to harassment because of this; things escalated when his sketchbook of BDSM artwork was discovered, stolen, photocopied and then posted around the campus. Worse still it was a friend of Allison, Alan's future close friend, who kept the gossip about him circulating. This likely accounts for Alan's cynicism about mainstream society's views of his subculture.
-   One of Phillip Kim's main weapons in _Weak Hero_. Since he doesn't have any fighting prowess to his name, he instead spreads rumours and lies so that others will end up fighting his enemies for him.

-   In _The Doctors of the Cat Family_ Jonathan Cat, a businessman, is falsely accused of abusing his wife and getting wealthy through stealing by people who are jealous of his wealth and don't understand how business works.
-   In the _Whateley Universe_, Phase is a Goodkind. That means his family is the most famous, most important group of mutant haters on the planet. Phase is a mutant at Superhero School Whateley Academy. Pretty much everybody there assumes he's still a mutant-hating monster. At the beginning of "Ayla and the Mad Scientist", people are gossiping about him supposedly kicking Bladedancer out of Team Kimba, and all the horrible reasons that might be behind it. To make matters worse, Bladedancer asked to be tossed out of Team Kimba (as part of a gambit to place her as a mole in another group), so it's hard to deny.
    
    The gossip mill at Whateley, which was really less like a mill and more like a large factory complete with loading docks and rail lines for optimal transmission of goods, was saying that I had kicked Chou out of Team Kimba, and the rest of the team was going along with that. Oh, there were other rumors. That Chou had gotten seriously hurt in Boston and had quit the team like a big crybaby. That Chou had decided she was tired of getting in trouble with Carson just for being on our team and getting dragged into team shenanigans. That the team voted her out in a Survivor-esque tribunal, with a clear majority wanting her gone. And my personal least favorite: Chou had gotten tired of being my personal geisha love-pillow and had bailed. I managed not to cringe when I heard that one.

-   In the _Goof Troop_ episode "Talent to the Max", an evil magic hat uses this against PJ.

PJ is one of the two least selfish and most loyal characters in the cast, _and_ a Bad Liar. Max still believes the lies.

Lois and Jimmy, who were assigned to help her, and the former who admires Vale, take Vicky to interview several people who had been helped by Superman to see that he's actually a hero who wants to help people. They then talk to Alexander, an assistant to Dr. Ivo, who became Parasyte, and Alexander states that Superman is the sole reason his boss' business went bankrupt, putting him and thousands of others out of work, never mind that another episode stated that the board of directors wanted to get rid of Ivo due to financial mismanagement, and also blames Superman for the destruction of the building they're in, despite Ivo being the one who started the confrontation after Superman saved an executive Ivo threw out a window, and Alexander concludes the interview saying that Superman is "one bad day" from going rogue. Back at the Daily Planet building, Lois discovers that Vicky lied about looking for a new job, and instead used her story to get a promotion at the Gotham Gazette, when she ignored the interviews of the people Superman saved and only used Alexander's words as proof that Superman is a threat to humanity that must be stopped for the greater good.
