Father Time is the Anthropomorphic Personification of time itself. He's commonly depicted as a bearded, elderly man dressed in a robe and carrying a scythe or sickle à la The Grim Reaper. Father Time is also occasionally seen holding timekeeping devices like clocks, hourglasses, or watches. Sometimes, he also has wings.

The ancient Greeks believed in Chronos, the Anthropomorphic Personification of Time, often depicted spinning a zodiac wheel. In the Renaissance where Greco-Roman art had a boom in popularity, it became very common to confuse Chronos with Cronos, the ruler of the Titans and Zeus' father. The later was a harvest deity most often depicted with a scythe, among other things. This lead to the two trading symbols with Chronos, gaining his scythe, which would become a common symbol for him in pop culture to this day.

Depending on the work, Father Time may be either co-workers or even friends with fellow anthropomorphic personifications such as Mother Nature, The Sandman, and the Tooth Fairy. Especially around December 31, he may meet up with Baby New Year.

As an embodiment of time itself, Father Time is normally a Time Master on some level. Sub-Trope of Anthropomorphic Personification. Compare to the aforementioned The Grim Reaper and The Old North Wind. Compare _and_ contrast the previously mentioned Baby New Year. In some works, Father Time and Baby New Year may be biologically related.

Father Time is an old man with a bald head and a waist-length beard, who wears a white robe and carries a scythe and hourglass. Due to his capture, time freezes and the world stands still, allowing Jim to cause a range of mischief before he lets his captive go and time begins moving once more.

    Music 

-   Old Man Time by Kate Rusby is obviously about this concept.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Classical Mythology: Chronos is the personification of time itself, born from the primordial deities Aether and Chaos, and an egg according to the Orphic tradition. Not to be confused with _Cronus_, a first-generation titan and later father of Zeus that ruled the pantheon after disposing of his father Uranus (ironically, Zeus himself would later dethrone and kill Cronus). Chronos is thought to be the progenitor of the idea of time as a humanoid man.
-   The Zurvanite sect of Zoroastrianism reveres Zurvan, personified time (hence why it is sometimes considered a heresy, even though it technically predates the modern orthodoxy). They (sexless) are the progenitor of both the God of Good and God of Evil, wanting the former to be the ruler of the cosmos but due to wording it as the "first born" the latter bursts from their tummy and declares himself ruler (though Zurvan fixes this by setting a time limit; we're about to transition to the end of Ahriman's rule). Zurvanism holds them to be inexorable and holding control over fate (what is time but things set to happen, after all?), hence an atypically fatalistic perception of life compared to other Zoroastrian sects.

    Theatre

-   _League of Legends_: Zilean evokes this image. He's an ancient Shuriman scholar with chronokinetic abilities, identifiable by his bushy white hair and massive clock-like device that floats behind him.

-   _The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask_: Princess Zelda and Tatl separately make mention of the Goddess of Time, both times during the climax of the prologue. She seems to be a deity of the parallel world that Termina is in, but her powers can still be accessed via the Ocarina of Time from Hyrule.
