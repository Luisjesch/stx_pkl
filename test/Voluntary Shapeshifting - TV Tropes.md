_"If comic books, cartoons, and Sci-Fi Original Movies have taught me anything, it's that shapeshifting comes with a bunch of boring rules and restrictions that limit its potential Turn-Into-a-Bulldozer-Whenever-I-Wantity. 'You can turn into a machine gun but not bullets, contemporary jazz turns you back to normal, you can only turn into presents your grandma's knitted for you.' Crap like that."_

A character with the power to transform and reshape their body. This trope comes in a wide variety of forms, but can be classified by exactly **what** the character can transform themselves into.

Most commonly, a character is limited to a specific set of one or more "alternate" forms, or a specific "class" of things he can change into (animals, machines, elements, etc.) Sometimes, there's a specific feature that they are unable to conceal, like hair color or voice, that others can use to identify them regardless of what form they are in. If the only thing they are able to change is hair/eye color, they have Kaleidoscope Hair/Eye Colour Change.

Usually, the character can transform simply by thinking about it, but occasionally they may use a gadget or a magic phrase.

Magic Pants are almost always in effect, unless the shapeshifting character demonstrates or mentions they are simply molding what looks like clothing out of their body cells for the common decency of those around them. (In which case, it's best not to think too much about that... whoops, too late.)

Many Superheroes have this power, along with nearly all gods and Sufficiently Advanced Aliens. Some of them are Shapeshifting Tricksters and Reality Warpers.

Many with a flexible transformation scheme also have a tacked-on bonus ability to alter their shape in any way they wish; i.e., adopt a clay-like consistency and sculpt themselves blob-style. The stretchy, ultraflexible body of a character like Plastic Man or Elastigirl is a milder form. Others may use a Partial Transformation to "mix and match" elements of their human and transformed states.

Being able to form limbs into stabbing weapons and reform oneself after being blown apart by explosives has become an almost standard ability of the clay-consistency metamorph in recent years, probably due to the popularity of the T-1000 character from _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_.

Quite a few Shifters boast Elemental Powers, with water-based powers being particularly popular. A potent Healing Factor is also often packaged in, considering they can restructure their body at will.

Exactly where their extra body mass comes from (or goes) when a shapeshifter transforms from one _size_ to another is known as Shapeshifter Baggage.

Can be used for Narrative Shapeshifting. The Shapeshifting Seducer finds picking up partners at bars is fairly easy, regardless of sex or preference, and is likely to be rather open-minded themselves about whom they choose. If they only sub-consciously choose to look like something, that's Self-Perception Shapeshifting.

Sooner or later, a Phlebotinum Breakdown may leave the character suffering Involuntary Shapeshifting or Shapeshifter Mode Lock, if only temporarily. If badly beaten or near death, they may have a Superpower Meltdown and lose control of their power, resulting in a Shapeshifter Swan Song. If the character isn't very used to morphing shapes they may have Limb-Sensation Fascination after each change. Such a character might also be Otherworldly and Sexually Ambiguous.

-   Merlock from _DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp_ has a talisman that allows him to turn into non-anthromorphic animals.
-   One of the antagonists of _Happy Heroes: The Movie_, the aptly-named Transformation M./Shapeshifter, morphs into the shape of Doctor H. for much of the movie and does so well at mimicking his behavior that it even fools the Supermen at first.
-   Pain and Panic from _Hercules_ can turn themselves into any number of animals. They can even shapeshift together to make larger creatures they couldn't be alone.
-   Jacklyn from _Igor_ pulls this off using special pills.

Mim cheats by turning into a _dragon_ when earlier she said it was against the rules to turn into something like a pink dragon (she uses Exact Words by claiming she never said it was cheating to turn into a _purple_ dragon). Merlin wins by turning himself into a _germ_, making Mim horribly sick and bedridden.

    Gamebooks 

-   _Lone Wolf_:
    -   The Helghasts from the gamebook series (and its spin-off _Legend of Lone Wolf_ novels) are undead able to take human shape, making them perfect spies and assassins for the Darklords.
    -   The Nadziranim ("dark sorcerers") can turn into vicious monsters when they have to fight. Their familiars the Liganim also seems to have many shapes.
    -   The Deathstalker and its mate, introduced in the New Order Kai series, went on a killing spree in a city and used its shapeshifting abilities to evade detection. Its natural form is some sort of horrible ape-like _thing_.

    Music 

-   Blue Öyster Cult: The titular character of Imaginos is a skilled shapeshifter, with examples given of him turning into a buzzard, a pony, and a _pinwheel_, as well as imitating various humans.
-   Tears for Fears: One of the _Sybil_ dialogue samples from "The Big Chair" (the B-Side of "Shout") is "The devil has the power to assume a pleasing shape".
-   They Might Be Giants: The song "Shape Shifter" is sung from the perspective of a person who suspects that multiple people and things around him are changing their appearance. Considering TMBG's love of the Unreliable Narrator trope, however, this may just be a metaphor.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Quite a few dragons have this ability, depending on the story.
-   In Japanese Mythology, tanuki ("raccoon dogs") usually have this ability; often kitsune (foxes), jorogumo (spiders), and housecats (bakeneko and nekomata) can do this as well.
-   Happens in Celtic Mythology too from time to time.
-   Loki, the Norse god of mischief, and to a lesser extent, Odin. Both gods held the power to change shape at will, and most of Loki's stories hinge on this ability.
-   Proteus from Greek Mythology was an ocean god that specialized in shifting his shape, most commonly to avoid being caught and interrogated by heroes who wanted to make use of his prophetic abilities.
-   Selkies have the ability to change from seals into humans, then back again with the use of their coats.
-   Pookas and kelpies both have the ability to shapeshift, with their defaults being yellow eyed horses living in marshes and swamps. (The difference being that Pookas are generally more benevolent than kelpies, who are just mythological douchebags).
    -   A similar Scandinavian water spirit known as the nøkken (in Norway at least; the name varies from region to region) could also transform into a horse, but his signature form was that of a handsome man with a violin. Its enchanting music would lure victims into the water, causing them to drown.
-   Various African myths and legends include shapeshifters (almost invariably Always Chaotic Evil cannibalistic witches) who take the forms of lions, leopards, hyenas, jackals, crocodiles, snakes, bats, dogs, pigs, water buffalo, geese, grasscutter rats, wildcats, and sharks. They use these shapes to kill and eat people, dig up graves, destroy crops, and other heinous acts.
-   Voluntary weretigers feature in the myths of China, Thailand, Bali, Java, and India.
-   In the Balkans, there are legends of weather-controlling sorcerers who can turn into snakes, eagles, or other animals. Usually these are good guys who protect their home villages, but then they're also prone to attacking neighboring villages.
-   In Mesoamerican folklore, the _nahual_ is a person with the power to turn into an animal, usually a jaguar or puma.
-   In many Chinese legends, certain taoists, Immortals and demons can perform the so called "72 Transformations" to transform into anything they like, change size or even turn their bodies into elements such as stone and metal. The name doesn't actually refer to the number of transformations, but refers to the fact that 72 is considered the number of perfection, as it's obtained by multiplying 9 and 8, the two highest single-digit numbers of Yang and Yin, respectively.

    Podcasts 

-   _Metamor City_, the non-canon spinoff to _Metamor Keep_, takes place after the curse has been manipulated to the point where the cursed can assume their pre-curse forms for up to twelve hours at a time, but they need to spend an equal amount of time in their fully cursed form.
-   Shapeshifting is the hat of Jupiter spies in _The Thrilling Adventure Hour_ "Sparks Nevada, Marshal on Mars" episodes. On multiple occasions, Jupiter spy Jib Janeen infiltrates the group by posing as one of the main characters with the rest none the wiser until it's too late. This being a comedy series, the joke comes from the fact that the the characters are fooled despite the fact that Jib Janeen makes absolutely _zero_ effort to hide his voice and mannerisms while in disguise. His initial appearances feature him singing the Sparks Nevada theme song as either Sparks or Croach and, in the latter case, being so hammy as Croach that Sparks' actor Marc Evan Jackson can't help Corpsing.
-   Void from _The Chimera Program_ arc of _Cool Kids Table_ can reshape their body however they want, including becoming larger.

    Roleplay 

-   _Fire Emblem on Forums_: Laguz characters and the monster classes from _Clashing Ideals_ possess this as part of their class abilities.
-   Indiana Jones in _We Are Our Avatars_ could do this with a Wand of Polymorph and Ring of Polymorph Control, however there are limits: it must be organic, can't exceed a certain natural power, and if a polymorph immune form, he'll be stuck in it.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_ is filled with creatures, races, classes, spells, and items that allow characters to shapeshift.
    -   Dopplegangers can only take humanoid forms, but can mimic any individual or type of humanoid they please, including clothes.
    -   Changelings (theorized to be descended from dopplegangers) can likewise assume other humanoid forms. Changeling wizards can confer a shapeshifting power to their Familiars.
    -   True lycanthropes (i.e. born, not infected) can switch between humanoid and bestial forms at will. Infected lycanthropes can learn to control their shifting to an extent, but voluntarily changing into hybrid or animal form automatically changes their alignment based on which variety they are.
    -   Deep dragons are natural shapeshifters, and gain a number of alternate forms as they age. The first is that of a winged snake, and they later gain access to a humanoid shape.
    -   Druids' Wild Shape ability allows them to take the form of wild animals. The prestige class "Master of Many Forms" focuses pretty much on that ability alone.
    -   Primevals can take the form of a single animal species at will, although it must be a prehistoric beast such as a dinosaur, megafauna or dire animal. They can only do this once daily when starting out, but gain additional daily uses as they level up.
    -   The _Polymorph_ subschool of spells focuses on turning living things into other sorts of living things.

-   _Exalted_:
    -   The Lunar Exalted have the ability to change into animals that they have eaten. Also humans, though they can eventually learn to add new human forms to their repertoire non-lethally. There aren't really all that many limits on what a Lunar can and can't turn into, as some of their Knacks allow them to acquire the forms of plants, elementals, _demons_, _gods_, raksha, and even _geography_.
        
        "Hey, guys, I was just wondering — was this mountain always here? Because I distinctly remember a lake which used to be here..."
        
    -   The Lunars' patron Luna, the shapeshifting god/dess of the moon, is able to take virtually any form in existence (and some that aren't).
-   _Godforsaken_: A character who Takes Animal Shape is a shapeshifter that can take the form of an animal, with full control over their transformation and mind in either form.
-   _Paranoia_. The Polymorphism mutant ability allows a character to change his shape enough to another humanoid form (for example, to impersonate another human being), but no more than that.
-   _Golden Sky Stories_. Being that the players are magical animals (called henge), they can take on multiple forms such as Talking Animal, Little Bit Beastly and fully human.
-   _GURPS_ has lots of ways to do this but the Morph version of Shapeshifting allows the user to become virtually anything they have seen before (within point limits). There are numerous spells that allow the user to alter their shape as well.
-   _Hero System_ does this with the Shape Shift power. This in and of itself only allows "cosmetic" changes (that may not even affect all senses), however — for the shapeshifter to be able to significantly change size and/or mass as well they would have to pick up Required Secondary Powers like Growth, Shrinking, Density Increase, or Stretching, and a shapeshifter who is also supposed to be able to adopt actual _traits_ of multiple mimicked forms would be a prime candidate for a Variable Power Pool.
-   _Night Wizard_ as a number of playable classes which can do this, most notably the Tamer/Magic Beast User, whose main gimmick is transforming body parts into various forms to grant himself various abilities.
-   _Sentinels of the Multiverse's_ The Naturalist can change between three animal forms at will, gaining a fourth during the OblivAeon event.
-   _The Splinter_: All avatars have this ability. Each race has three forms that they can switch between. In fact, beings in the Realm that can't shapeshift aren't even considered truly sapient.

-   _Warhammer_: The Changeling, a powerful Daemonic Herald of the Chaos God of Magic, is able to alter its form at will, using this ability to advance the plots of its nefarious master and generally spread as much chaos and misdirection as possible. It is said that the Changeling has taken on so many forms over the course of its existence that it has forgotten its original form.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_: Vampires from early editions can alter their shape and appearance in order to resemble other alien species, which they use to infiltrate their societies.
-   _The World of Darkness_: Multiple games include variants of this.
    -   _Mage: The Ascension_: Mages can shapeshift depending on the magic used. Life is a pretty common one.
    -   _Vampire: The Masquerade_ and _Vampire: The Requiem_ have a vampiric discipline known as Protean, which allows for limited shapeshifting. Though the first few levels allow the changing of a single feature (eyes, claws, get fur and such), higher levels allow a character to shift into any form normally associated with vampires (i.e. wolves, bats, mist).
    -   _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_ and _Werewolf: The Forsaken_ have you play as a werewolf with five forms ranging through man to hybrid to wolf. Shapeshifting is controlled by the player for the most part. The game is based on werewolves, but sourcebooks allow players in the _Old World of Darkness_ to play a variety of were-animals (big cats, ravens, rats, coyotes, bears, foxes, hyenas, spiders, snakes, crocodiles, lizards, sharks), most of which have either five or three available forms. _New World of Darkness_ sourcebooks open up an even wider range of shapeshifters.
-   _World Tree (RPG)_: Bonstables can take on the form of either any Prime species or of silver-winged birds.

    Theme Parks 

-   Waldo from _Muppet\*Vision 3D_ at the Disney Theme Parks.

    Toys 

-   _BIONICLE_ has quite a few. One example is Krahka, a Rahi who can transform, perfectly imitate and even gain some memories of any living thing she sees. Another example is the Makuta, a race of evil beings, one of which is the Big Bad, that are made of energy and have shapeshifting armor.

    Web Animation 

-   The Imposter from the _Supermarioglitchy4's Super Mario 64 Bloopers_ episode of the same name can shapeshift into anyone. He has even tricked SMG4 and Starman3 into believing that MarioMario54321 was acting weird and Mario was dancing to a Rickroll.
-   In Appisote 19 of _Da Amazin OT Advenchr_, Lite lands on Pluto after getting kicked in the ass BY an ass, where an alien shapeshifts into Nascar to fool him.
-   _Homestar Runner_: In the Strong Bad Email "shapeshifter", Strong Bad points out all the downsides to shapeshifting, such as the restrictive rules like only being able to turn into balloon animals, or half of a person, and the unintended consequences, like turning into a $100 bill, being picked up in the wind, and being stuffed in someone's sweaty pocket. Another "rule" that he points out is that all shapeshifters need to have a cool shapeshifting sound effect, such as "DWAYNE!"
-   _RWBY_: On the world of Remnant, living beings possess Aura, spiritual power that allows them to perform super-powered feats known as Semblances, and which can be amplified through the use of a substance called Dust. However, it's not magic, which everyone knows is just a fairy tale. What people don't know is that there's a secret brotherhood of very powerful people working very hard to make sure the world doesn't find out magic really exists. One member of this group, Qrow Branwen, has the ability to transform into a crow. Because it's a magical ability, he keeps it secret and only a select few people know about it; those that learn about the ability tend to get freaked out about it, strongly implying that the world views shapeshifting as impossible. Qrow's twin sister Raven, who abandoned the brotherhood long ago, has the same ability. Qrow has greyish-red eyes and Raven has ruby-red eyes; their bird forms retain these colours, giving away their identities to those who know what to look for. The twins were not born with this magical ability, but were granted it by the leader of the brotherhood, Professor Ozpin, who once possessed vast magical power that he claims has been dwindling over the many thousands of years that he has walked the earth; whether or not he can shapeshift or only pass on the ability to others is unknown.
-   _Dreamscape_: Keedran can change between an angelic and a monstrous form.

    Web Original 

-   _Codex Inversus_: Transmuter snails are capable of self-transmutation by waving their eyestalks in precise patterns, creating magical sigils and effectively casting spells. A snail may give itself climbing or jumping legs to deal with a tall obstacle, then a tadpole-like tail to cross a body of water, then turn that tail into a prehensile tentacle to reach a piece of food, then grow bristling spines over its shell to fend off a predator.
-   _Whateley Universe_: A lot of the characters have this.
    -   While Word of God states it is a relatively uncommon power, especially at higher levels, given the size of the Whateley Academy student body by the early 2000s, that still means about a dozen or so in any given graduating class (not counting those who have a limited form of it as a Required Secondary Power). This can range from "minor cosmetic changes" (Vamp) or "can only copy other people" (Bogus and Chaney) over "can turn into any natural predatory animal" (Feral) and super-stretchy abilities (Plastic Girl and Reach) to "any viable biological form in a range between 50-500Kg" (Reinforce) to "can change into almost anything you can think of without regard to size" (Jimmy Trauger). Jimmy T can turn into an 80-foot-giant, or 300 pounds of carnivorous protoplasm, or something from _Alien_. He just can't control what shape he'll be when he wakes up, and it takes him hours to revert back to his real form.
    -   And those are just some of the _mutants_. The universe also features lycanthropes (like the tribe whose land the school itself stands on) and shapeshifting spirits and demons. For example, Carmilla's father Gothmog is normally an Eldritch Abomination...but he's also quite capable of taking human form when interacting with humans.
-   Facsimile of _The Descendants_ has no known limits on her powers, and has been implied to have given up on 'real' clothing in favor of creating it all with her shapeshifting.
-   Many Nanocyborgs in _Orion's Arm_ are capable of shapeshifting, but like everything else in that universe they're limited by the laws of physics.
-   All weres in _Above Ground_ can shapeshift voluntarily after they become adults — being able to control the change is a sign of maturity. However, in moments of strong emotion, or with child weres, accidental shifting may occur.
-   Two of the heroes in _The Questport Chronicles_ do this: one transforms into a dragon, the other into a vicious demon.
-   _Elcenia_: Elcenia-native dragons have this as one of the abilities they develop as they reach adulthood, and can transform into animals, though cannot control what they look like within a species.
-   Jaza from The Chimera Bazaar is a shape-shifting being, but has forgotten its original form, which makes its gender questionable.
-   In the _Metamor Keep_ shared universe, those afflicted with the curse of Metamor can adjust the degree to which the curse transforms them to a degree. Age regressed can look like they're any age below twelve, the genderbent can alter the size of their "endowments", and theriomorphs can be anthropomorphic animals or feral animals, sometimes taurs. But at the time they can't return to their pre-cursed state.
-   Called the Morphing power in _Brennus_, coming in different strengths: Mindstar can just do cosmetic things; Bakeneko can change into anything organic, but cannot change her mass; Hemming can change into anything organic or inorganic within a range of one-tenth to fifty times his own mass.
-   _SCP Foundation_:
    -   SCP-040 ("Evolution's Child"). SCP-040-1a was created by SCP-040. It has polymorphic abilities and can change its size, shape, color, and texture as necessary to act as outer clothing (e.g. a sweater) for SCP-040.
    -   SCP-424 ("Nanomimes"). SCP-424 can take the form (but not the coloration) of any object or creature it has ever seen.
    -   SCP-523 ("The Most Unhelpful Object On Earth"). When SCP-523 escapes from containment, it changes its form to that of a useful object. When someone tries to use it for a specific purpose, it changes to another form that's not useful at all for that purpose.
    -   SCP-845 ("Liquid Polecat"). SCP-845 is a polecat that can change into a light brown liquid similar to water.
    -   SCP-929 ("The Cuckoo"). When SCP-929 comes within three meters of an animal it will rapidly change into a younger version of the animal. It will stay in that form until the animal it's imitating dies or it's attacked.
    -   SCP-953 ("Polymorphic Humanoid"). SCP-953 normally has the form of a small Red Fox, but can take the form of objects and living creatures, including that of an attractive Korean woman.
    -   SCP-1536 ("Doppelgängers"). SCP-1536 can transform itself into any moving object or animal it sees, once every 16 minutes. SCP-1536 cannot be distinguished from what it copied by any known test.
    -   SCP-1537 ("Akul'hil"). SCP-1537-A can change into an almost limitless variety of shapes. They can also increase their mass to up 3 times normal and make their skin as strong as steel.
    -   SCP-1961 ("Transformation Booth"). SCP-1961-1 can take the form of any living creature of the same mass, including non-humans and SCP objects. They can retain human form for up to 4 hours but any kind of shock or strong emotions will cause them to melt down.
    -   SCP-2054 ("The Double"). SCP-2054 is an entity capable of duplicating the form of a human being so completely that all of the science and technology of the Foundation can't tell the duplicate from the original. SCP-2054 is also able to copy the mind of the target well enough to convincingly impersonate them.
    -   SCP-2750 ("Navajo Skinwalkers"). All member of the original SCP-2750 could change into at least five different animals found in the southwest U.S., such as crows, wolves, coyotes, eagles and foxes. Some members could change into nine or more types of animals.
    -   SCP-2757 ("Dr. Wondertainment's Projector Fantastico™"). When the SCP-2757 projector is used with the film SCP-2757-1e _The Valiant Crusaders_, one of the powers gained by the experimental subjects is shapeshifting.
-   It's revealed early on in _Running with Rats_ that Alix is a shapeshifter.
-   The Yao Fei Beastmen in _Way of Choices_ can each shift back and forth between a human and a beast form.
-   _Scrub Club_:
    -   Played straight for Gel-Mo, who can shapeshift into anything he likes (although he's still see-through and gooey).
    -   Downplayed for Squeaks who can turn into different kinds of soap, but only soap.
    -   Even more downplayed for the rest of the Scrub Clubbers, who can only turn into one thing (Taki always turns into a clock, Hot Shot and Chill always turn into faucets, etc).

    Web Videos 

-   Morphman from _Save The Supers_ has this power, except that he always takes the shape of objects, still recognizable by their color scheme. This means (beyond an extra in the first episode) that there is no actor playing him; all his appearances are as (mostly) inanimate objects the rest of the cast interact with.
-   _CellSpex_ can switch from her human avatar to her pony avatar at will, when she reviews an episode of _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_. Though she apparently had to learn how to do this at will at some point, as the first time it happened, it just sort of... happened.
    
    **Cell Spex:** Really? So this is mandatory for anyone who wants to analyse an episode? (sighs) Whatever.
