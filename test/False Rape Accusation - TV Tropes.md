Someone claims to be raped. However, the accusation turns out to be a lie. Depending on the scenario, it can be a matter of this fact already being known by the audience or a plot twist. In the case of the former, the conflict is about the credibility of the accused instead of whether or not rape ever happened. This is a very specific form of a Wounded Gazelle Gambit.

In order to qualify for this trope, the following is required:

-   There must be an accusation of rape. The alleged victim does not need to be the accuser.
-   The person accused must be innocent beyond a mere court ruling of "Not Guilty". This is because the "not guilty" ruling could also be played off as the criminal getting away with their actions.

There are also a few ways this can play out:

1.  Mistaken Identity: The accused did not have sex with the alleged victim at the time claimed. They may have had sex with the alleged victim at other times. This is generally seen in fiction with "stranger rape", cases where the alleged victim was too impaired to correctly identify the attacker or cases where the victim was also murdered and is unable to provide an identification. This is also the easiest type to clear up.
2.  Post-coital Regrets: The accuser decides (or has it decided for them) after the case that the sexual encounter was rape based on embarrassment, new information about the accused or social pressure.
3.  Malicious Slander: The accused is simply accused of having committed rape for the purpose of harming them. For this, there need not have been any actual sex or alleged victim at all. Usually does not involve legal charges, unlike some of the others as it is "just" a rumor.

See also either Frameup or Abomination Accusation Attack, depending on how the false rape accusation is done. Compare Unprovoked Pervert Payback, where an Accidental Pervert moment creates a backlash for the offender.

Most everyone in Melromarc, especially the King and the three other Heroes, believe Malty's lie without question, resulting in Naofumi being branded a pariah in the kingdom and becoming quite emotionally embittered to boot. Because of this, he cannot find reputable companions, forcing him to rely on slaves like Raphtalia and Filo to do his fighting for him. Naofumi is exonerated when the Queen and true ruler of Melromarc returns, puts the King and Malty on trial, and then uses a Slave Crest that zaps its bearer every time they tell a lie in order to expose all of Malty's lies for what they really are.

    Religion and Mythology 

-   The Bible: In the Book of Genesis, Joseph is the slave of the Egyptian Potiphar, a captain in the royal guard, Potiphar's wife wants him to sleep with her. Joseph runs away from her, but the wife tries to hold him back and tears off his garment. She immediately calls for help and claims that Joseph has assaulted her (as she now needs a cover-up that explains how she comes by Joseph's garment). Potiphar believes his wife and has Joseph thrown into prison.
-   The Qur'an (surah 12): When Yusuf (= Joseph in the Bible) is the slave of a rich Egyptian (only referred to as Al-´Aziz, "Mighty One"), the wife of his master tries to seduce him. Yusuf refuses her and tries to run away, and as the wife is trying to hold him back, she rends his shirt from the back. Her husband comes by and she explains the situation as Yusuf trying to assault her. However, 'Aziz does not believe her, because he notices that Yusuf's shirt is torn from the back, not from the front. As a result, 'Aziz' wife is mocked by the other women of the city for being attracted to a slave. She retaliates by inviting the other women to their house so they can see Yusuf themselves, with the effect that all of them now want Yusuf. Yusuf again rejects them and is eventually thrown into prison on account of the scorned women (although the Quran does not say under what accusation he is imprisoned). More so than the Biblical account, the Quran is somewhat sympathetic to 'Aziz' wife because it makes clear that Yusuf is incomparably beautiful, and that Yusuf is also attracted to her in turn and rejects her only because adultery is a sin. Yusuf even prays to be thrown into prison because he fears otherwise he might eventually give in to seduction.
-   Classical Mythology:
    -   Proetus, King of Tiryns, takes in Bellerophon in his exile; Proetus' wife, Stheneboea, takes a shine to him and tries to seduce him. When Bellerophon refuses, she tells Proetus that Bellerophon has tried to rape her. Proetus, not wanting to take revenge openly because of Sacred Hospitality, sends Bellerophon on a mission to his friend and father-in-law King Iobates with a letter that asks Iobates to kill Bellerophon. Since Bellerophon stayed under Iobates' roof before he read the letter, Iobates was also bound by Sacred Hospitality not to kill him, so he asked Bellerophon to kill the Chimera, only for him to succeed. In some versions, Bellerophon eventually either killed or humiliated Stheneboea for what she did.
    -   Queen Astydameia of Iolcus tried to seduce Peleus, but he refused because he was already married to Antigone of Phthia. After tricking Antigone into killing herself, Astydameia told her husband, King Acastus, that Peleus tried to rape her. Acastus tried to kill Peleus by taking him on a hunting trip, then stealing his sword and abandoning him when they got attacked by marauding Centaurs. However, Peleus escaped when either Chiron or Hermes returned his sword. Later, with the help of Jason, Peleus invaded Iolcus and killed Acastus and Astydameia.
    -   Theseus' wife Phaedra tried to seduce Hippolytus, Theseus's son with Antiope, but he refused. Pheadra told Theseus that Hippolytus tried to rape her, but in some versions, she committed suicide and left a note saying Hippolytus had raped her. Either way, Theseus believed her and prayed to Poseidon to punish Hippolytus. Poseidon obliged by sending a sea monster to spook Hippolytus' horses, causing him to fall out of his chariot and get dragged to his death.

    Theatre 

-   In Seneca's tragedy _Phaedra_, Phaedra, wife of Theseus, accuses her stepson Hippolytus of rape after he has spurned her. Theseus calls on his father Neptune to punish Hippolytus, and Neptune causes Hippolytus to be dragged to death by his own chariot-horses. Phaedra mourns for Hippolytus and admits her accusation was false, then commits suicide. Not to be confused with Euripides' _Hippolytus_, in which Phaedra hangs herself right away, and Theseus just misunderstands the suicide note.

    Video Games 

-   _Kindergarten_: If the protagonist insults Cindy, she will _loudly_ accuse him of raping her to get back at him. Since Cindy and the protagonist are both kindergarteners, neither the teacher nor the principal take the accusation very seriously, though that doesn't stop you from getting shot by the principal if you don't deny it. She tries to pull the same thing again in the sequel, only for Ms. Applegate to cut her off.

If the Arisen shows up, she throws herself at them and confesses her love to them, only for Duke Edmun to show up and try to strangle her in a trance. If the Arisen saves her, Aelinore saves face by accuses them of breaking into her bedchamber and trying to force themselves on her, then calls for the guards to have the Arisen tortured and imprisoned.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_, Consummate Liar Celestia Ludenburg convinced Otaku Yamada to team up with her to kill straight-arrow Ishimaru. Yamada was already not on good terms with Ishimaru, as they both believed that a laptop (with an advanced and friendly AI on it) belonged to them, and now it had gone missing, with each one blaming the other (this was a very serious problem for the entire cast, but they just took it personally). She did this by telling him that Ishimaru had raped her, took pictures and then blackmailed her into stealing the laptop and giving it to him.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Scandinavia and the World_, Sweden once accused Australia of raping him and his sister to get him to stop telling America's secrets.
