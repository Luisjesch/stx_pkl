_"... a propensity, while in use, to turn instantly beastly hot or blindingly cold upon you, depending on whether your neighbor turned on his cold or his hot to deprive you of a necessary complement in the shower you had so carefully blended."_

— _Lolita_, by **Vladimir Nabokov**

Bob flushes the toilet while Alice is in the shower. Alice screams and curses, unprepared for the sudden increase in water temperature. Or perhaps Alice turns on the washing machine while Bob is in the shower, causing Bob to experience a precipitous _drop_ in water temperature. Can be done deliberately or by accident, but the result is still funny — provided it's not happening to _you_. Can also be done by turning on a faucet elsewhere in the house, which has the advantage of not prematurely giving away the game if you are deliberately pranking someone. Usually deployed as a comedy trope, often accompanied by a quick shot of the Oh, Crap! expression on Alice's face when she hears the unmistakable sound of a toilet flushing.

Truth in Television as most shower valves mix hot and cold water to achieve the desired temperature, so anything that diverts either hot or cold water will result in a sharp temperature shift in the opposite direction. Note that this was always a regional trope as it depends upon the central water heater practice common in non-tropical Western plumbing design but not always found in other cultures. Rapidly becoming a bit of a Discredited Trope in Real Life since the introduction of pressure-balanced shower valves specifically designed to prevent this from happening — the worst that's likely to happen is that the shower's water flow temporarily drops. Such "anti-scald" shower valves are even required by law in some places, especially in commercial buildings like apartments, hotels, and dormitories. Nevertheless, if you have the (mis)fortune of being in a house or building with old plumbing, this trope is still doable.

    Which happened in this shower if somebody flushed a toilet

    Video Games 

-   In _The Sims 2_, if one Sim flushes the toilet while another is in the shower, the second Sim will jump out of the shower, run over to the first Sim and yell at them in Simlish. Of course, someone made a mod to disable this. Although sometimes the Sim in the shower will jump out and yell simply because another Sim has entered the bathroom, even if they don't flush or even get to _use_ the toilet. Sims have to have a very close relationship to share the bathroom; generally, only lovers will do it.

    **Mike:** What the fuck is wrong with you!?!
    
-   Done once in _Fur Will Fly_.

    Western Animation 

-   _Bob's Burgers_: This happens in "Purple Rain-union" when Linda, who's in the shower at the time, talks herself into putting her band back together for their high school reunion, and Gene celebrates with a "victory flush".
-   Done on _The Simpsons_ twice:

    -   Season twelve's "Tennis the Menace" — Bart turns on the kitchen faucet and Homer (once again in the shower) screams, and to tunes such as "Mary Had a Little Lamb".

-   _Kick Buttowski_: Brad does this to Kick in "Love Stinks!".
-   _Mixels_ manages to _invert_ the setup in the episode "Hot Lava Shower". Thanks to the Infernites clearing the pipes of the titular lava shower (which really is a stream of lava treated like water), the clog goes through the pipe system of Mixel Land, superheating both Krader's toilet and Teslo's drinking fountain, making _them_ the ones to scream out from the heat instead.
-   _Dr. Dimensionpants_: Kyle does this to Phillip in the episode "Viking Games" in an attempt to make him tell where he tried to sneak off to last night.
-   _The Loud House_: has this as one of the quirks of the titular (worn) home. The issues tend to happen to Luna Loud the most, much to her annoyance.
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_: In the live action opening segment of the "lost episode" special, Patchy the Pirate is taking a shower when the audience arrives. In order to draw Patchy out and start the special properly, Potty flushes the toilet to make the water hotter. It works, but Patchy admits that he can't start the special because he lost the lost episode and goes back to taking his shower.
-   _Kid vs. Kat_: Kat does this to Coop in the short "Kaponk!".
-   _Lilo & Stitch: The Series_: In the episode "Sample", Stitch hides in the shower and turns on the water to get out of having the shots he needs as a result of disguising himself as a dog (despite being scared of water). Lilo flushes the toilet to get him to come out.

    Real Life 

-   It happens. With old water heaters, ill-timed laundry, or what have you.
-   Most houses in the United Kingdom have two water tanks, or one water tank heated by the gas or electric boiler, and an electric immersion heater tank in the airing cupboard. If you're unlucky enough to take a bath or shower just after someone's used most of the hot water in either one, it's wise to not leave the shower or bath running and hope for the best, but to check the temperature first; once the hot water runs out, you'll either get blasted by cold water if you're in the shower, or come back to the bath to find it full of disappointingly tepid bathwater.
-   A variant with many scald-guard systems; the water will remain the right temperature, but the flow will decrease dramatically, slowing down any rinsing being done. Not painful, but still annoying.
-   In places with electric showers, a plumbing network that has the toilet and the shower in the same manifold (which is doable but considered incorrect for reasons that go farther than thermal comfort) will cause this, either because suddenly the shower's resistor is heating up less water at a time, or because the flow gets so low the heating is disabled altogether. In this case, faucets can't achieve the trope, since the loss pressure on the system caused by them is irrelevant compared to a flush.
-   In college dormitories where this trope still applies (usually older ones), people sometimes yell "flushing!" if they hear someone in the shower, so the person in the shower knows to get out of the way of the scalding/freezing water for a few seconds until the system clears.
