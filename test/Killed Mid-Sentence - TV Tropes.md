**Kreely Slaver:** I'll DIE before I'll—  
_**THOOOM!**_  
**Ennesby:** "...finish my sentence," I think he was saying.

No matter what the medium or genre of a work of fiction is in, there are a few general rules that are usually in place. One of them is that if a character isn't a Red Shirt, it doesn't matter if they're in a situation of dire peril as long as they're speaking. Because as long as they're talking, nothing bad is going to happen to them. Oh sure, they can die after saying some notable Last Words or an important Final Speech, but dying in the middle of a sentence, especially if it's an ordinary, unimportant one? That's not going to happen, ri—GHAAAAACKKK!

...Let me step in for him. WRONG.

There are any number of reasons to kill a character, whether major, minor, or mookish, in the middle of a sentence. Firstly, in an Anyone Can Die story, it's a great way to show that not only can anyone die, but _they can die at any time_. (Which can make for great drama and suspense over the fates of your favorite characters). Secondly, it can be a great way for an Anti-Hero to show off his No-Nonsense Nemesis nature by killing an antagonist in the middle of some sort of threat, or as a more lethal version of Talk to the Fist. (Likewise, it can be a way to show a villain averting the classic Why Don't You Just Shoot Him? scenario). It can be a way of showing that a story is on the gritty and cynical end of the Sliding Scale of Idealism Versus Cynicism. Lastly, it could just be that the author doesn't care much for interminable Final Speeches, and chooses to subvert that trope.

One thing is for sure: when this trope happens, you know that this is for real. If the story was a light, not too serious sort before, it's just gotten a whole lot darker and more serious after this.

See also Deadline News when this happens on the other side of a TV screen (though not necessarily in the middle of a sentence).

If a character is killed mid-_word_, there's a good chance of it being a Curse Cut Short. The Almost Dead Guy will invariably die mid-sentence, and there's a good chance of the sentence beginning "His Name Is...".

If this is a sci-fi story and the scientist figures out how to destroy the alien monster, expect him to die halfway through his explanation, just as he's about to say that it can only be destroyed by—

-   Several safety ads use this trope.
-   A downplayed example (in that nobody is physically killed) occurs in the US Army's "Cyber" commercial, involving an "unstoppable" hacker getting disconnected in the middle of his speech:
    
    **Hacker:** I can shut down your power grids. I-I can paralyze your infrastructure. I can a-access the personal data of everyone in America. I am the enemy with no face. And I can't, be, sto-_\*BZZT\*_
    
    **VO:** For every would-be cyber attack, there's a team of US Army cyber-warriors, who will _not_ be defeated.
    

    Anime & Man— 

-   During the Marley arc of _Attack on Titan_, Griez, a Marleyan soldier and one of the biggest examples of Marley's racism toward Eldians, goes on a fairly extended and disgusting rant about Sasha, who recently died, right in front of her own parents and the guy she loved. Thankfully, this vileness is cut short by Yelena, who blows his brains out as he's spewing out a final insult toward Sasha.
    
    **Griez:** I'll put it in a way that even you can understand. That tramp was the filthy daughter of d—! (**BOOM!**)
    
-   _Black Lagoon_:
    -   Revy, having a bad day and faced with a huge Neo-Nazi wielding a huge golden pistol, calmly reloads and shoots him in the chest before he can finish bragging about his gun, then ridicules him and sends him off with a final lesson: "As long as they hit their target, any gun will do."
    -   Revy also shot Rotton The Wizard mid-introduction, but he had a kevlar vest on and is still hanging around.
-   _Bleach_: Subverted repeatedly. There are many occasions when you'd think this has just happened, but it usually turns out to be a trick using a character's power, or that the character being "killed" is Not Quite Dead.
    -   This happens with Giriko. He boasts so much about his power that Kenpachi gets fed up and just bisects him.
    -   When the Sternritter first invade Soul Society, they slash or blast several Soul Reapers while they were in the middle of introducing themselves or calling their attacks.
    -   Kenpachi does this again to Berenice from the Sternritter group, whom he gives an Impromptu Tracheotomy to _specifically_ because she wouldn't stop talking about her powers instead of fighting him. He even gets to cynically lampshade the trope:
        
        "The second one went on about having something against me and explained her powers forever. I could hardly hear her 'cause of the other guy's roaring. She was annoying, so I just tore out her throat."
        
    -   Shaz Domino also incessantly brags about his powers before Ichigo blasts him away.
-   _Code Geass_ has this happening to Monica Krushevsky/Kruszewski of the Knights of the Round. Shortly after Suzaku kills one of her fellow Knights (Bit Character Dorothea Ernst), she tries to get a bead on him, only for him and the Lancelot Albion to fly _right_ in front of her Florence. She eats a point-blank shot from the V.A.R.I.S. Rifle before she can finish saying the traitor's name.
    
    **Monica:** A 9th Generation Knightmare Frame...? It's Suzaku Kururu—! _(BOOM!)_
    
-   In the _Cowboy Bebop_ episode "Ballad of Fallen Angels", Spike Spiegel shoots a Red Dragon mook who takes Faye hostage, right as the mook tells him to put down his gun and step away, which kicks off the church shootout between him, the Red Dragon, and his Evil Counterpart Vicious.
-   _D.Gray-Man_: Tyki almost does this to Tokusa by chopping both his arms off while Tokusa was ranting about how he loves "serving the lord" to Allen. Justified in that the job of killing the foes was already done and he was in all right to feel perfectly safe when Tyki literally appeared out of nowhere.
-   _Death Note_ has L getting the trademark heart attack almost finishing the word "shinigami"; as well as Matt being shot and killed by Takada's bodyguards for his part in kidnapping her right in the middle of listing the reasons why they won't shoot him.
-   In _Dragon Ball_, King Piccolo kills Chiaotzu while he's wishing on the Dragon Balls for Piccolo to disappear—thus it's a case of being killed _so_ they can't finish their sentence<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
-   _Elfen Lied_: Kouta's sister Kanae is split in half by Lucy as she tearfully begs Kouta not to hate her for telling him that she saw Lucy kill people. Shirakawa suffers the same fate when she is about to warn Kouta about Lucy, and Kakuzawa loses his head bargaining with Lucy.
-   _Fairy Tail_: God Serena tells Acnologia how excited he is to finally find/see him before he kills him in one swipe from his hand before he could finish his sentence.
-   In _Fate/Apocrypha_: As Celenike is issuing a Command Spell order to her Servant Astolfo to kill Sieg, who Celenike despises for developing a bond with Astolfo, in as sadistic a manner as possible to both make Astolfo betray his code of justice and break him, Mordred decapitates her before she can finish the order.
    
    **Celenike:** Now, Rider! Go forth and KILL THAT FILTHY HOMUNC—! \[gets decapitated\]
    
    **Mordred:** _Shut up._
    
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_:
    -   In the manga, Commander of the Drachman army after the annihilation of his forces. Kimblee even lampshades it in a disturbing way.
    -   In _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_, there's Yoki, the soldier Sloth kills and one of Greed's men.
    -   Also, when Al first met Greed, his regenerative powers were revealed this way.
        
        **Greed:** I mean, if you really wanna hurt me, you're gonna have to do something kind of like—  
        _\[Gets his head bashed off with a hammer\]_
        
    -   Lust kills Number 48 before he can tell Ed what's going on in Lab 5.
-   _Golden Kamuy_ has a particularly severe example in the death of Wilk/Nopperabo, who is sniped by Ogata right as he is about to tell Sugimoto the key to the location of the Ainu gold. Given that this is literally the principal mystery of the series and the driving force behind the entire plot, with hindsight it is rather tragically hilarious how straight this trope was played, to the point of being slightly on-the-nose. But then again, what is Golden Kamuy if not really over-the-top?
-   In _Hunter × Hunter_, Cheetu attempts to challenge Zeno, and when Zeno realizes Cheetu won't leave him alone for any reason, Zeno just tells Cheetu to look behind him. As he explains that he's not falling for it, down comes Zeno's son Silva, whose landing squashes Cheetu like a bug.
-   Regius tries to say something to Zest after he's impaled by Due's claws in _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_, but he doesn't get any further than "Zest, I... I..." before succumbing to his wounds.
-   Pretty much every Druggie (Clotho, Orga, Auel, Sting, etc) death in _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_ happens mid-sentence/mid-psychotic laugh.
-   Frequently happened in _Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans_ for anyone killed by Mikazuki, be it a Double Tap, or having a gigantic two handed mace thrown right in the face. Including one who he headshots in the middle of thanking Mikazuki for killing him so he can die with honor.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Done with a Filler Villain who activates his Collapsing Lair and is crushed under a rock in the middle of his Evil Laugh.
    -   Tayuya was also killed in this way: she was in the middle of thinking she would use her genjutsu when Temari's huge attack instantly leveled the area and crushed her under a tree.
    -   Zetsu's clone of Kisame was decapitated in the middle of Calling His Attack.
    -   Sasori dies this way. After being stabbed in the heart capsule by poisoned swords handled by his Mother and Father puppets, he continues to talk to a wounded Sakura and a severely weakened Chiyo, though he is immobilized. He then grudgingly congratulates Sakura on defeating him and gives her a parting gift: Information gathered by a spy he was supposed to meet at Tenchi Bridge. He is stopped mid-sentence while lamenting he won't be able to meet his subordinate when the poison and the damage to his heart finally catches up to him, and he dies.

-   _One Piece_:
    -   In the 9th OVA, a retelling of the Drum Kingdom Saga that adds Robin and Franky, they do this to Dr. Hiriluk.
    -   Spandine, under orders from the Five Elders, shoots Professor Clover in the head before Clover can say the name of the Ancient Kingdom. That name is such forbidden knowledge that anyone who knows of it is to be executed immediately—which means it's fortunate for Spandine he and his assassin squad didn't hear it, as they would've had to die too.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   Kozuki Oden's death turns this, somehow, into a truly epic Moment of Awesome. After surviving his own execution by standing in boiling oil for an **hour**, _while holding his nine samurai above his head_, he begins to say his catchphrase: "I am Oden, and I was born-" before Orochi shoots him in the head. The audience, so impressed with his sheer strength and willpower, _finishes the line_ out of respect: "-to boil!"
-   _One-Punch Man_:
    -   The monster Kamakyuri attempts an ambush by crashing down through the ceiling of Saitama's apartment. He begins to introduce himself, but is killed instantly by an irritated Saitama (who can win every battle with a single punch), who demands he pay for the damage.
    -   Saitama does this a lot because he gets quickly bored by Motive Rants, Explaining Your Power to the Enemy, etcetera. It's even part of the Establishing Series Moment in the very first chapter/episode.
-   _Peter Pan no Bouken_: This almost happens to Wendy when she tries to reason with the fully Face Heel Turned Princess Luna. Ironically, that's what makes Luna snap back to her senses, and Wendy survives anyway.
-   _Rebuild World_: Wataba, an Overzealous Underling of the Slum Lord Shijima, tries to go And Your Little Dog, Too! on Akira by threatening Shizuka who’s essentially Akira’s Parental Substitute mother. Before Wataba can finish, Akira shoots him dead, proceeding to drag his corpse through the streets to Make an Example of Them.
-   _Sailor Moon_:
    -   This happens to Wiseman in _Sailor Moon R_. Interestingly, he is only cut off _after_ his physical form is destroyed, hinting at his true form "Doom Phantom" being the shadowy spirit witnessed for about a second during the battle, which apparently resides inside the Dark Crystal as he is cut off the moment the Dark Crystal is destroyed. Another note is, he doesn't even get to finish the word "Phantom" before he is blasted to oblivion. (This is in the original dub many might not be too familiar with)
    -   In the next season, Kaorinite is in the middle of speaking affectionately to Doctor Tomoe when she is killed by Mistress 9 with a lightning attack.
-   In _Soul Eater_, Mosquito is killed mid-sentence by Noah.
-   _SPY×FAMILY_: During the cruise arc, while Yor is fighting a Carnival of Killers by herself, two of them try to introduce themselves in a dramatic fashion before engaging her. Unfortunately for them, Yor does not believe that Talking Is a Free Action, and promptly disposes of them, the second not even finishing his introduction:
    
    "I am the King of Chak-" _(cut to next panel with him lying on the floor and a hole in his head)_

    Comic Boo— 

-   _Deadpool_:
    -   Being both Combat Pragmatist and having Medium Awareness, Deadpool has pulled this more than once on his enemies and targets.
    -   And had it pulled on him in turn; the difference comes in whether the attacker unknowingly intends to actually kill him, or they are aware of Deadpool's Healing Factor and simply want to shut him up while he regenerates.

    -   When Pharma makes light of Ambulon's grisly death at Pharma's own hand (well, chainsaw) in _The Transformers: More than Meets the Eye_, he's only allowed to get up to "Your face! It was an absolute pic-" before First Aid, a 'bot with a very _proactive_ approach to being The Medic, blows his head off with a minigun.
-   The illustrated novel _Zombies: A Record of the Year of Infection_ is presented as being the recovered journal of a survivor dealing with the initial stages of the Zombie Apocalypse. It ends with the journal suddenly trailing off mid-sentence, and slight spatters of blood on the side of the page.
-   In the first chapter of _V for Vendetta_, a Fingerman grabs what he thinks is V's hand, only for him to be left holding a prosthetic hand as V fights the other secret policemen and escapes with Evey.

        **Bizarro Lex Luthor:** Godship am Big Bad. And it came because of me. Me was trying to find worstest way to hurt Bizarro #1, my worstest enemy, so me sent signal into core of the planet, hoping to find someone to come out and help. But signal went opposite direction into space and it attracted—-

        -   Poetically, Contrasting Sequel Antagonist Riccio in the graphic novel _The Birth of Kong_ (who is a Psycho Supporter of Kong) is killed the same way when he's in the middle of raving his head off in front of Kong.
    -   _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_: Master Sergeant Hendricks only manages to get out a morose "Oh, shi—" before Ghidorah's Gravity Beams blast him to ashes. In a Deleted Scene depicting the death of Admiral Stenz, he would've been killed by an explosion in the middle of saying "It has been an ho—" when his submarine is sinking.

    Musi— 

-   "Run, Joey, Run," a Murder Ballad by David Geddes where an angry father, enraged that a boy he disapproves of did something to his daughter, goes to kill Joey but shoots his daughter instead. "_Daddy please don't, it wasn't his fault/He means so much to me/Daddy please don't/We're gon... na get... mar... ried... ._" (Earlier verses in the song complete the sentence, "... just you wait and see!")
-   "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" by The Beatles. ("But as the words are leaving his lips/A noise comes from behind...")
-   Vaughn Monroe's '50s novelty hit "In the Middle of the House" ends this way, with the narrator run over by a locomotive.
-   Dream Theater's song "Pull Me Under'' ends like this.
-   Pink Floyd's "The Final Cut": The line that goes "And if I'm in I'll tell you what's behind the wall" has a gunshot going off after "I'll tell you", suggesting that whoever was trying to say this line was shot. Possibly done to obscure its reference to the main character in _The Wall_.
-   Assemblage 23's "30kft" ends with the singer's phone call cutting out.
-   "Harrowdown Hill" by Thom Yorke, about the suicide of Dr. David Kelly:
    
    I feel me slipping in and out of consciousness
    
    I feel me-
    
-   Dave Matthews Band's "When the World Ends" (a song about lovers during the apocalypse) cuts off abruptly with Dave and the band still in mid-chorus, at least implying this trope if not playing it straight.

    Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big

-   "Apokalypse Wann Anders" by Farin Urlaub. He's sitting with his girlfriend in their garden and wait for said apocalypse. Just when the morning has come and he thinks to live for another day...

    Ich bin so froh, dass es dich gibt, denn-
    
-   Opera singer Maria Callas used to give _La Traviata_ a Nightmare Fuel ending. Violetta has the Incurable Cough of Death and, realistically, feels much better just before the end — she's supposed to say "O gioia!" (Oh joy) and drop dead. Callas would cut off her own line, say "O gioi—" and die with her eyes wide open.
-   St. Mary's Trumpet Call (Polish: "Hejnał Mariacki") is a traditional anthem played hourly from the highest tower of Saint Mary's Church in the Polish city of Kraków. The melody famously stops abruptly, as if cut off mid-note. As per a popular modern legend, the anthem was played by a sentry during the 1241 Mongol invasion of Poland to warn of approaching enemy troops. City gates were closed in time, but the trumpeter was instantly killed when a Mongol arrow pierced his throat. The modern version of the melody ostensibly ends mid-note to honour his death.
-   Happens a couple of times in Monty Python songs. In "I've Got Two Legs" Terry Gilliam sings about his legs but is shot mid-lyric. In "Never be Rude to an Arab" the singer is blown up after using too many racial slurs.

    No you won't catch me, old Slithergadee,  
    You may catch all the others, but you wo—_
    
    -   _I'm Being Eaten by a Boa Constrictor_, also by Shel Silverstein, ends with the lines:

-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    
    -   Commissars are usually presented as this, as it's their job to maintain morale and discipline by shooting any trooper who shows signs of cowardice, heresy, or pointing out that the battle plan sucks grox bal-**\*BLAM\***.
    -   The flavor text of a Tyranid unit that is basically a mine full of acid reads, more or less, as:
    
    **An Imperial Guard** _(to another who has found the thing_) "No!. Don't touch th..!"
    
    -   _Only War_: A lot of flavor text, especially in sections describing the foes fought by the Guard, consists of a character rallying troops or dismissing a particular threat but being killed by some enemy soldier or alien horror before finishing their sentence.

    Theat— 

-   The Zeroth Law of Trope Examples strikes again, since this is how Hotspur dies in William Shakespeare's _Henry IV, Part I_:
    
    ..._O, I could prophesy,_

    _Lies on my tongue. No, Percy, thou art dust_

        "And rain will make the flowers..."
        
    -   Gavroche also dies one word short of the end of his song.
        
        "So don't you kick a dog because he's just a pup"
        
        "So you better run for cover when the pup grows..."
        
-   In _Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_ Pirelli suffers a similar fate, Judge Turpin narrowly avoids it in the first act when Anthony bursts in, and Mrs. Lovett gets hers near the end.
-   Sometimes during the final scene of _Miss Saigon_, Kim dies in Chris' arms before she can finish the line, "How in one night have we come so far. . .?"
-   Orin in _Little Shop of Horrors_.
    
    **Orin:** Are you satisfied? I—laughed—myself—to—
    
    **Seymour:** Death? _(Orin dies)_
    
-   In _The Fantasticks_, in the Rape Ballet, Henry meets his death in mid-battle-cry:
    
    "God for Harry, England, and Saint Geo—_ouch!_"
    
-   Lord Adalbert D'Ysquith in _A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder_ kicks the bucket via poison right before the last word of his bombastic song "Looking Down the Barrel of a Gun".

-   In the final scene of _West Side Story_, as Tony lies mortally wounded in Maria's arms, she begins hopefully singing one last reprise of "Somewhere" sans orchestral accompaniment, and Tony begins to sing along with her, only to expire after the third-to-last line, "Someday..." Maria's voice also falls silent after singing the following word, "Somehow..." The orchestra steps in to complete the musical phrase with a wordless "Somewhere."
-   In _Machinal_, just before the protagonist dies offstage in the electric chair, she lets out a strangled cry: "Somebody! Somebod—"

        **Delta:** You're welcome.

    -   This trope was also played with in the last episode of the _Blood Gulch Chronicles_, when Captain Flowers deliberately delayed revealing an (apparently) important piece of information about the Reds to Tucker.

    **Boy:** Excuse me, do you have the time?

    **Watch:** \*Lazers the worker as the face cries, "BLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"\*
    
-   In _Space Tree_, an escape hatch in a slave room has a button that, when activated, juts out a spike.

-   _DEATH BATTLE!_:
    -   Starscream. "You haven't won. I'm invincible! My Spark lives. You can never defeat Star—" **GULP** Spark eaten by Rainbow Dash. Yes, a _My Little Pony_ character just defeated a giant robot. The Spark may be indestructible, but it counts as a kill.
    -   Saba lets out a cry of "SON OF A BI-" right before the Tigerzord blows up with him in it.

    -   The ultimate fate of Roman Torchwick. It's pretty ironic since he was ranting about how good he is at staying _alive_ to Ruby Rose, only to immediately be eaten by a griffon.

-   _Babushka: the Movie_:
    -   QuarterJade/Jodi is killed in the middle of saying "What the f\-" by Valkyrae when she returns to the launch pad and sees the bodies of Rae and Sykkuno's previous victims. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

After finding BrookeAB he walks and talks with her for a few seconds, playing up feigned innocence and earnestness. After the two walk to an isolated spot on the map Sykkuno suddenly kills her, having never quite finished the thought he was using to lure her away.
