Sentinels are such divas, they really love head shots.  
Concept art by Goran Bukvic

In fiction, blast attacks are generated from all manner of places on the human body; the eyes, the mouth, the hands and even the chest. And then we have Head Blast.

To put it simply, this is the act of firing attacks from the head. Typically this appears as either a beam fired from the forehead, a weapon mounted atop the head/around the face or even turning the head itself into some kind of blaster. Psychic power blasts, such as those fired by comic book telepaths, are usually depicted this way.

A character who fires beams from their literal Third Eye does not qualify as this trope; that's Eye Beams. If it comes out of the mouth, it's a Breath Weapon.

Can sometimes overlap with Weaponized Headgear and Psi Blast.

Not to be confused with Boom, Headshot!, which deals with situations where a head is the target and not the cause of shooting.
