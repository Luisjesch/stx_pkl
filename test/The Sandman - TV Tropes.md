The Sandman (or Mr. Sandman) is a mythical character in Western and Northern European folklore who puts people to sleep and brings good dreams by sprinkling magical sand onto the eyes of people while they sleep at night. Usually depicted as good, in some stories he is also depicted as bad, as well as neutral. The Sandman as an entity of dreams receives many names (like Morpheus in Classical Mythology), but this character has specific traits that distinguish him from other such entities:

1.  He could be a human or an Anthropomorphic Personification. In some cases, he only has the powers associated with this trope and is not a supernatural entity otherwise.
2.  In his good form he's considered the Guardian of Dreams, but in his bad form, he's an interpretation of the Boogeyman (who might otherwise be his nemesis).
3.  No matter the form or alignment he has, he always uses a magical sand to put people to sleep.

This trope is about Sandman and all his representations in the different media. Compare Sentient Sands (although some examples overlap).

Not to be confused with the Spider-Man enemy (literally a sandman), the comic book, the series based on the comic book, the video game, the short story, or the animated film based on the short story.

Sub-Trope of Dream Weaver.

    Comic Books 

-   DC Comics has used the name of this mythological character for various different characters:

    -   Probably the most known version is _The Sandman (1989)_ written by Neil Gaiman and published by Vertigo Comics and being based on mythology, and also retconned as the inspiration for the Golden Age superhero of the same name, while Sandord and Hall were more direct attempts by the beings of the Dreaming to replace him.
