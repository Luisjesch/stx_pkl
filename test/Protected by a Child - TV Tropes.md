_"Using that little girl for a shield... THIS IS LOW, EVEN FOR YOU!"_

So The Hero is on his Roaring Rampage of Revenge, and finds the man who killed his Mentor, his Loved One, his Sidekick Creature Nuisance... or is just an evil bastard.

He got the Villain on the ropes, and goes to deliver the finishing blow, ready to stop the evil once and for all... what's this?!

Where did that kid come from?! The child of course doesn't want anyone to hurt their family, and refuses to move.

Usually, the Hero backs down — with some amount of hesitation depending on the guy's place on the sliding scale of morality, after all — the kid doesn't need to be traumatized. This invokes a realization of what he's doing. Sometimes ends in An Aesop about Revenge.

Oddly enough, due to the Harmful to Minors trope, you rarely see a full subversion except in the grimmest Black-and-Grey Morality worlds. On the other hand, if it is made clear the hero Would Hurt a Child and actually went after the child, expect the villain to go completely ballistic against the hero.

A nasty variant has the villain invoking this trope by using a child as a Human Shield or hostage.

-   In _Beautiful Girls_, after Steve and his friends beat up Tommy because of Tommy's affair with Darian (as he and Darian were High-School Sweethearts), Mo, Paul and Willie drive up to Steve's house so Mo can carry out a Roaring Rampage of Revenge.

-   Bunch of children in _Christmas Evil_ surround Harry to protect him from their parents who realize that he is the killer Santa responsible for the deaths at the church.

-   In _Crash_, the store owner confronts the repairman who couldn't fix his door after his store is vandalized and threatens to shoot him. The repair man's daughter, watching the confrontation, races out to save her father and throws herself between the two as the man fires.

-   _Kill Bill_:
    -   The Bride and her opponent Vernita Green are interrupted by Vernita's daughter Nikki coming home from school; they both act innocent, and Vernita orders her upstairs. When Vernita makes her attempt to bushwhack the Bride, she puts a knife into her at range — and turns to see Nikki staring at them.
        
        **The Bride:** It was not my intention to do this in front of you. For that, I'm sorry. But take my word for it; your mother had it coming. When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it, I'll be waiting.
        
    -   Later on, when the Bride catches up with Bill, she is interrupted in her attempt to, well, kill Bill, by the sudden intervention of their daughter. This doesn't seem to have been planned by Bill, he just happened to be rearing and taking care of the kid.
-   In _Let the Right One In_, Oskar is saved from the bullies at the last moment by Eli. Although Eli is, admittedly, not a normal child. That said, he's already saved Eli from almost certain death, so this film has _two_ examples of this trope protecting _each other_.
-   Although she was an adult at the time (twenty years old) the trope is otherwise played straight between Elena and Diego in _The Mask of Zorro._ When Diego is about to kill Rafael, Elena throws herself between them, begging her biological father not to kill the man who raised her.
-   In _Once Upon a Time in Mexico_, Agent Sands is left blind by the bad guys and ends up being helped by the Chicleta Boy who he had previously given a large sum of money to simply to make him leave him alone.

-   In _Raiders of the Lost Ark_, Indy gets into a tense discussion with Belloq and is on the brink of pulling his weapon — while surrounded by Belloq's well-armed allies.

    Literature 

-   _2666_: Pedro Rengifo hires Lalo to be a bodyguard for his family.
-   _Codex Alera_: Tavi encounters a Canim female who fallen behind her pack. Terrified, she bares her throat to him, expecting the worst—but Tavi is distracted by the newborn pups nursing her and immediately tells her in her own language “Run.” This chance meeting makes him realize that the Canim are not invading Alera—they are actually _fleeing refugees._
-   A version of this happens in _Congo_ and its movie adaptation, wherein the gorilla Amy defuses a violent confrontation involving one of the Congo gray gorillas and her trainer Peter by hugging him and generally treating him like a baby gorilla, signing to him, "Peter hug Amy". He quickly understands her strategy, having studied gorillas for years.
-   A version of this happens in _Harry Potter_, of all places - subverted in that the aggressor himself is a child, and the defender, a cat. At the end of _Prisoner of Azkaban_, Harry has Sirius Black defenseless and is holding him at wand point, thinking of killing him, when Hermione's ugly, half-kneazle pet jumps over his heart to protect him. Harry doesn't rule out killing Crookshanks as well, but he hesitates long enough for someone to come in and stop everything.
-   _The Hunger Games_: Near the end of _Mockingjay_, this is supposedly what Snow does to protect himself, though it ends up being a ruse of Coin's.
-   The final book of the _Inheritance Cycle_ does this. When Eragon, Arya, Elva, and Saphira enter Galbatorix's throne room, he is well aware of the fact that they have a weapon that can pierce his wards, and that they have a witch-child who can say the things that need to be said to kill him. How does he solve this? He makes Elva mute until she leaves the room, and he brings in two children, and in possibly the most conversational tone a villain can have, he essentially says "You make one wrong move, and both of them will die. You do anything I don't like and they die. Hell, you so much as scratch your nose when I don't tell you to, and they both die." It works.
-   Combined with Shaming the Mob in a famous scene from _To Kill A Mocking Bird_. When an angry lynch mob shows up to kill his black client in the middle of the night, Atticus is waiting for them so he can try to argue some sense, but he fails and they threaten to go through him if he won't step aside. Fortunately, his daughter Scout snuck out and followed him that night. Her sudden appearance and apparent innocent lack of understanding of the situation (greeting the men warmly and asking about how their kids are doing since school ended for the summer) takes all the steam out of them and they are too ashamed to carry out their violent intentions. As Atticus puts it later, she reminded them they were (good) men and not a mob.
-   Done the other way around in "Ayla and the Birthday Brawl" of the _Whateley Universe_. When Generator and Bladedancer have to dive into a supervillain hostage crisis and one of the Felonious Four is about to kill Generator, one of the hostage children steps forward to save Generator. It only partially works. The supervillain is going to mutilate the kid then kill Generator, but spends so much time threatening them that he runs out of time and has to use the escape portal before he can hurt either.
    -   Occurs in Thrasher's backstory, as told in a Flashback; his father, the supervillain Mach 5, had stolen several advanced weapons from a Marine Armory, and The Dragonslayers, an elite unit of Cape Busters, were tasked with bringing them back, and bringing him in, probably not in one piece. They managed to find him in a motel late at night, and Highjacker followed him into the room he was renting, alone. Where he went to take Mach 5 down, his son (Thrasher, as a young child) stepped between them. Erik, realizing he didn't have the heart to intentionally kill a child, told Mach 5 that he would let him escape so long as he told them where the weapons were hidden. This was a turning point not only for Mahren but for Mach 5 as well; he retired from crime and became a stockbroker. A second Ironic Echo came when the now teenaged Thrasher steps in between Mahren (whom he had just realized was the same Dragonslayer who had come for his father years earlier) and the badly-beaten superhero Lamplighter, who had attacked a group of students who were on a Parkour run because he thought they were vandals, despite the signs saying that the area was the Academy's property and got soundly defeated by the students and Erik's 'Marine buddies' (e.g., the other surviving Dragonslayers). Mahren was ready to kill the 'hero' who had dared to hurt those he was responsible for, but Thrasher reminded him that he had to set an example.

    Live-Action TV 

-   On _Lost_, when the survivors have Ben captured in season four, Sawyer says that they should just shoot him and be done with it, and Locke responds that he's not so callous that he will kill him while his daughter is right there watching.
    -   Another occurrence of this is when Ben is about to shoot Penny but is stopped when her young son walks out of the boat and hesitates just long enough to get soundly thrashed by a very irate Desmond, who he had just shot right in the groceries.
-   _Lost in Space_: When Dr. Smith is in danger, see the good doctor pull Will Robinson or occasionally Penny in front of him for use as a human shield.
-   An inverted case of protecting the heroine from the Dean Bitterman in Japanese drama _Shōkōjo Seira_. Little Romi is the only reason why school Director Mimura Chieko kept Seira in the school or otherwise she would have been kicked out.
-   Happens at the end of _The X-Files_ episode "Salvage." The Monster of the Week, a man who is made of living metal, is brutally tracking down and killing the men he blames for his condition. However, he can't bring himself to kill the final guy because the man had his young son in the car. This leads to his Heel Realization.

    Video Games 

-   In _Disgaea: Hour of Darkness_, after defeating Hoggmeister, Laharl is about to kill him when the pig's son begs him to stop. If the player's ally-kill count is low, Laharl automatically spares the guy (who joins). But if your kill count is high, you can go to kill him but Flonne will attack you, leading to a Non-Standard Game Over
-   Nonviolent example in _Persona 4_; Dojima occasionally presses the protagonist on what he does with his time, with increasing hostility; his daughter Nanako (who also happens to be the Justice Arcana) is an expert on shutting him down.
-   _Shadow Hearts: Covenant_ has a rare double-subversion of this trope. When the party finally reaches the leader of the Japanese Shadow Government, Minister Ishimura, Yuri prepares to kill him, but is confronted by Ishimura's grandson. Instead of backing down, he pushes the kid aside, and brutally beats up the old man. However, in the end he is unable to kill him. If anything, the notion of Even Evil Has Loved Ones angers Yuri even more, as that makes Ishimura a Hypocrite, but the realisation that Even Evil Can Be Loved stops him.
-   _Weaponized_ in _Suikoden II_, when your army's strategist suspects the enemy leader of setting a trap at a peace summit. He has access to a little girl said leader has a soft spot for and arranges for her to be present when the trap is sprung. The enemy leader proves unwilling to use lethal force with the girl watching.

    Webcomics 

-   Done without the child's presence needed in _Dominic Deegan_. Celesto, having Jumped Off The Slippery Slope, slaughters a Jerkass athlete and turns to kill the stripper he was accosting... only to get a vision of her telling her daughter good night.
    
    **Celesto:** Go home, hug your daughter tight, and thank her for that good-luck pinch. _She just saved your life._
    
-   _True Villains_: Gray was ready to strike Sebastian down, but Mia intervened just in time. One of the reasons Sebastian made it out of there alive.

    Web Original 

-   From the Evil Overlord List Cellblock A, #142:
    
    If I have children and subsequently grandchildren, I will keep my three-year-old granddaughter near me at all times. When the hero enters to kill me, I will ask him to first explain to her why it is necessary to kill her beloved grandpa. When the hero launches into an explanation of morality way over her head, that will be her cue to pull the lever and send him into the pit of crocodiles. After all, small children like crocodiles almost as much as Evil Overlords and it's important to spend quality time with the grandkids.
    

    Western Animation 

-   _DuckTales (1987)_: An accidental example occurs in "Hero for Hire", Doofus glomping Launchpad pulls Scrooge up sharply in the middle of his effort to lay hands on the pilot for his "faked death" scheme.

-   In _Justice League Unlimited_, Huntress decides to kill the man responsible for killing her parents before he could go into hiding. The villain is literally at her mercy when the man's son breaks free from his escort. She ends up turning her bow away, sparing his life. This is partly because she's reminded of the night when her parents died, so she punches the guy instead.
-   Near the end of the _South Park_ movie, just before Terrance and Phillip are about to be killed, the kids stand in the way and begged to the army and Kyle's mom not to kill them. This doesn't do much good, as the kids are only about a third of T&P's height and though Kyle's speech touches the soldiers, Kyle's mom shoots them dead anyway.

    Real Life 

-   Some people actually try this in Real Life. Unfortunately, it tends to result in dead children. To everyone reading, remember that while this may generate horrific publicity for the erstwhile child-killer, you shouldn't have done that. Seriously, not cool.
    -   The Westboro Baptist Church brings their kids to their protests, just for this purpose.
    -   Some members of the Occupy Wall Street movement tried this in Washington, using kids to barricade the doors of a convention center and block traffic in the street.
    -   It is speculated that those who designed the Murrah building in Oklahoma City _wanted_ the daycare center placed on the second floor, visible to anyone who passed by, in the hopes that seeing the innocent, adorable children playing might deter anyone looking to harm. As we all know, it didn't.
-   Baboons, while trying to avoid a fight, will hide among infants, as most Baboons won't fight in front of them.
    -   It's a social survival tactic to get in good with mothers and provide babysitting service for them. If you're carrying an infant, you're largely immune to attacks from other males. If a male does disregard an infant and attack the babysitter, the females will swarm him in defense of the infant.
-   In 2008, there was a news article about a 7-year-old girl and her mother who were attacked by the mom's ex-boyfriend. When he tried to kill the mother, THE GIRL TOOK SEVERAL BULLETS! Amazingly, she lived.
-   One of Saddam Hussein's tactics was to place his HQ on the top floors of schools to discourage attacks on the commanders.
-   During the 2013 siege of the Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, a four-year-old boy stood between his wounded mother and one of the gunmen, calling him "a very bad man". The terrorist lowered his gun, handed the boy a Mars bar, and said "Forgive me, we are not monsters" before leaving.
-   A real-life possibly apocryphal story: the English explorer John Smith wrote that when he met the Powhatan Indians, they put his head on a rock to bash his brains out with clubs but he was saved when a little girl named Pocahontas put her head over his. He also claims to have been similarly rescued by a little girl while in Turkey, so you've gotta wonder whether he just had a particular kind of good/bad luck or was just telling tales.
