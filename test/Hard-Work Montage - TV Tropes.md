_"Industry, science, and technology! Big men sticking screwdrivers into things, and **turning** them! And **adjusting** them!"_

One or more characters is shown working hard at a particular task through a sequence of shots meant to imply time passing. This may often incorporate a signature piece of energetic or heroic music, or the characters themselves will sing as they work.

This includes the A-Team Montage, "Everybody Helps Out" Denouement, the Training Montage, House-Hunting Montage, and any montage in which somebody does a lot of construction, communication, travel, martial arts training, or scouring many books and files. May be featured in the Forging Scene and other Creation Sequences.

The joyful and optimistic strains of the Adventurous Irish Violins can often be heard in the background of such sequences, especially if the work is one from the Adventure Genre.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   The _Death Note_ anime likes these - lots of scenes of frantic scribbling set to Ominous Latin Chanting.
-   _Doraemon: Nobita's Treasure Island_ has the montage when the gang's ship (onboard with them, their new friend Flock) crashes on the shore of a deserted island after barely surviving a storm. Which is followed by a lengthy scene of the heroes working together to fix the vessel, collect supplies, and upgrade their equipment for the final battle.
-   In _Earth Maiden Arjuna_, Juna and Tokio work over the course of a day to earn a meal from a strange man they found living in the mountains. Complete with Adventurous Irish Violins.
-   _THE iDOLM@STER: Cinderella Girls_ uses them, usually to show the cast practicing in preparation for a big event.

-   The chapter "Magical Girl Yue" in _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ has this being used while Yue studies to be a mage in the Magic World, complete with Exploding Calendar. More Knowledge. More Power.
    -   Also the chapter in which Negi and Kotaro are shown training for their fight with Rakan.
-   Episode 9 of _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ titled "Both of You, Dance Like You Want to Win!" which features quite prominently a montage of Shinji and Asuka training together while also living together, accompanied by appropriately heroic(?) music.

    Asian Animation 

-   In the first episode of _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf: Mighty Little Defenders_, Weslie is given a montage where he cleans up the storehouse and Wolffy has one that runs concurrently where he puts General Wolf's stuff back into his suitcase. Both montages have several parts where they are shown at the same time in a way that gives the illusion of them being directly connected to each other, such as a split-screen that makes it look like Weslie is taking something out of a box and giving it to Wolffy to pack up.

    Comic Books 

-   Tom's training in Chinese from _Double Happiness_.
-   _My Little Pony Micro Series_ Issue #3: Rarity doesn't realize it until later, but all the various jobs she does around the farm help the hippie ponies create their beauty products.

-   The fan-video "Master Chief Sucks At _Halo 3_" features a montage of Master Chief _making_ a montage, with the _Team America: World Police_ montage song playing over the top. The "montage" he makes however is a parody of the many fans make of their best _Halo_ moments, complete with shoddy editing, poor picture quality and loud, looping Linkin Park soundtrack.
    
    **Master Chief:** omg!_\[sic\]_ I must be teh _\[sic\]_ best halo 3 player in teh_\[sic\]_ planet!1_\[sic\]_ It is decided! I shall make.......... a montage!!1!one_\[sic\]_

-   _Ultra Fast Pony_:
    -   In the episode "Little Miss Montage", Rarity invokes her powers as "master of the montage" to finish making her friends' dresses in record time.
    -   The "Behind the scenes" bonus video subverts this. Series creator Wacarb promises to show viewers the process of creating an _Ultra Fast Pony_ episode... and the montage shows Wacarb playing computer games, running around his house at random, and singing along with the radio.

-   _Blossoms in the Dust_ includes a montage in which Edna crisscrosses Texas, tirelessly raising donations one quarter at a time, in order to save the orphanage from the bureaucrats who want to shut it down.
-   Several montages throughout _Chicken Run_ show the chickens building contraptions or digging tunnels for their escape attempts. The biggest one involves them constructing the "crate", or airplane, where every single chicken is working their rump off while sawing and hammering, intercut with Mr. Tweedy as he also repairs the damaged pie machine.

-   _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls_:

        -   Sunset Shimmer's solo song "Embrace the Magic" shows all the girls minus Twilight (who is absent) working on rebuilding the dock while coming to control their magic in the process.
        -   The song "Legend You Were Meant to Be" is both sung during the Crystal Gala, and shows the preparations for it (thus in the form of flashbacks), with clearing up the entrance of boulders, writing and sending the invitations, setting up the musical equipment, decorations and lights, preparing the food (or saving it from mishaps), etc. Though it is intercut by snapshots that fall instead into Good-Times Montage.

-   The construction of the rocket in _Wallace & Gromit: A Grand Day Out_.
-   In _Wolfwalkers_, during both days Robyn has to work as a Scullery Maid, there's a montage of her doing various chores. Unlike most examples, these montages aren't played positively, since the work is shown to be long and monotonous and Robyn is clearly unhappy while doing it.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _Ace Ventura: Pet Detective_: While examining the Miami Dolphins mascot Snowflake's water tank, Ace discovers a piece of orange amber in it and he determines that it's from the 1984 AFC Championship rings given to the players and coaches from the 1984 Dolphins team, so he tracks down players and coaches from the 1984 team, including head coach Don Shula and quarterback Dan Marino, to see if one of them was missing that piece, and thus, was Snowflake's abductor, accompanied by Aerosmith's "Line Up". The abductor is later discovered to be former Dolphins kicker Ray Finkle, who'd transitioned to Lois Einhorn, now the detective investigating the abduction for the Miami Police Department.

    Literature 

-   David Weber's _On Basilisk Station_ has one with most of the junior members of the Command Roster making their impact on Basilisk known.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Parodied by _30 Rock_ here.
-   _The Big Bang Theory_ had a montage of Sheldon and Rajesh _staring intensely at equations on a dry-erase board_ set to "Eye of the Tiger", with frequent angle changes and so on for the full on montage effect, and interrupted by Raj asking Sheldon where he keeps the aspirin.
-   _Black Mirror_ - "Loch Henry": Davis and Pia get a montage of filming their demo reel of the Iain Adair doc, comprised of shots of interviews, drone flights, editing, and behind-the-scenes fluff.
-   Parodied in _Bones_. After finding some critical fact, two of the team members comment that Bones will now proceed to stare at the corpse until they talk to her and play Rock Paper Scissors to determine who will baby sit her while she does so.
-   In the live action adaptation of _Boys over Flowers_, Tsukushi gets a lot of these.
-   _Bridgerton_: In the first episode of season 2, there are montages between the scenes of Anthony's attempts to search for a wife and the ones where he is seen stressed out from doing his tasks as a viscount.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   Referenced, of course:
        
        **Buffy:** I thought it was gonna be like in the movies. You know, inspirational music... a montage, me sharpening my pencils, me reading, writing, falling asleep on a big pile of books with my glasses all crooked ('cause in my montage I have glasses)...
        
    -   Then in "Once More With Feeling"
        
        **Buffy:** I'm worried our training's gonna turn into a montage from an '80s movie.  
        **Giles:** If we start to hear inspirational power chords, we'll just lay down until it goes away.
        
-   _Cowboy Bebop (2021)_. In "Venus Pop", Jet Black gets angry when Spike Spiegel goes off to do his own thing instead of helping hunt down the Mad Bomber. We get a montage of Jet doing a chemical analysis, reading the bomber's manifesto and pruning his bonsai tree. Later we find out the ship's computer did the analysis, while Jet only skimmed the manifesto and actually spent most of the time on his bonsai.
-   _CSI_ does this to show the characters doing the hard work of forensic investigation at the lab. In the episode "I Like to Watch", they do some Lampshade Hanging: Hodges looks forward to a certain test, as he thinks it will be good material for the documentary crew currently in the lab. Nick points out that the test takes six hours, to which Hodges remarks that "When they cut it together, it'll only take thirty seconds." It takes thirty seconds.
-   Used to epic (and heartbreaking) effect in the _Doctor Who_ episode "Heaven Sent," where it's used to show the Doctor punching through a **20 foot thick** wall harder than diamond over the course of _**4.5 billion years**_.
-   _The Dropout_
    -   Elizabeth makes the rounds at several venture capitalists' offices, presenting her concept of a revolutionary blood-testing machine. None of them show interest, as she has no working prototype, has yet to meet with pharmaceutical companies, and she dropped out of Stanford as a sophomore.
    -   Just before Elizabeth is to present the machine to Novartis in Switzerland, the prototype does not work. She and her team work through the night trying everything to fix it, with everybody contributing blood samples. Nothing they try (heating the machine, cooling the room, food wrappers) works. Finally, she has Rakesh rig the demo so that they call up the good reading they did get in the lab.
-   The _Firefly_ episode "Ariel" has one of these as the crew prepare for their heist for that episode. It includes building a medical shuttle from ship parts found in a junk-yard, getting some med tech uniforms and learning medical jargon.
-   Parodied in _Harry and Paul_, where the same piece of Stock Footage (sawing wood, hitting thumb with hammer, mixing cement, reading the Racing Post) serves as a Hard-Work Montage for the Ridiculously Fast Construction of all kinds of buildings.
-   The doctors on _House_ do this to signify they're coming up with the right diagnosis after getting it wrong for forty minutes.
-   Lampshaded in _iCarly_: we don't actually see a montage, but when Spencer sets the assembled builders loose to rebuild Carly's room (which his homemade birthday present for her destroyed), he yells "Montage speed!", clearly referencing this trope.
-   Done at least twice in _It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia_, the notable first is in dual fashion as Charlie gets trained by Mac and Dennis to become an underground fighter, and Sweet Dee's montage at the gym training for an upcoming fight after she started using steroids. The second one is in the fifth season, when Charlie tries to teach Mac how to skate (featuring a short _Rocky_\-like segment where Mac eats a whole drink of yolk before puking vehemently through Gilligan Cut.)
-   _The Mandalorian_. When he finally gets his ship parts back from the Jawas, the Mandalorian gripes that he still needs a full maintenance facility to repair the damage. Or they can just knuckle down and have a montage of Building Is Welding.
-   Episode 49 of _Mimpi Metropolitan_ has a montage of Topan, Prima, Alan and Bambang spending a night sleepily working on Topan's bachelor thesis.
-   The Christmas special of _Misfits_ opens with a montage showing the team hard at work in their lives beyond community service; because they're the Misfits, none of them seem to make any progress: Kelly is stuck picking up litter and getting mocked by passers-by; Nathan works as a Santa Claus with even less success; Simon trains in Parkour so he can eventually become Superhoodie, only to tumble off a one-story building and bounce off a dumpster, narrowly avoiding serious injury; even Curtis and Nikki aren't doing well, as their attempts to have sex in a pub bathroom end with Nikki accidentally teleporting herself away, leaving a very frustrated Curtis to go back to bartending. Alisha meanwhile, has gotten very interested in a sign advertising "Powers For Cash..."
-   Made famous (along with signature music by Lalo Schifrin) in television by _Mission: Impossible_... (for which Bruce Geller took some inspiration from the 1964 movie _Topkapi_.)
-   Used in just about every episode of _MythBusters_. Especially notable, as it's probably the only example here where they really _are_ doing all that hard work. Man, sometimes its got to _suck_ to be the Build Team. In addition, it's often lampshadeed that there's a great deal of editing involved, sometimes by the hosts, sometimes by the narrator. A couple examples:
    
    **Narrator:** But a hop, a skip, and a Jump Cut later....
    
    **Narrator:** With the car frame exposed and the trunk tower support system Time Lapsed into place....
    
-   _Property Brothers_: Especially if they're trying to get back on schedule.
-   _Royal Pains_: After showing us how shortcuts will cause your heart to stop Hank and Divya are shown going through the more grueling and painful version of a detox instead of the instant one promised by the sketchy brochure.
-   Lampshaded in _Stargate SG-1_. When SG-1 is sent to guard an engineering team while they repair an alien ship, the non-technical members of the team find themselves with very little to do. O'Neill and Jackson are shown in the montage to be passing the time by watching the glowing crystals and outright sleeping.
-   In the episode "Trial And Error" of _Supernatural_, Kevin's daily routine (alarm goes off at 5 a.m., drinks coffee, studies tablet, fries hotdogs, takes aspirin, goes to bed in the early morning) repeated as he crosses off days of the calendar starting with January 13, 2013, and ending with February 7, 2013.
-   Many competitive cooking shows (_Top Chef_, _Chopped_, etc.) involving multiple contestants creating dishes under a time limit feature montages of frenetic chopping, stirring, dashing back and forth to collect ingredients and equipment, etc.
-   _Top Gear (UK)_:
    -   Appears as well, in much the same spirit — usually in the context of something automotive, like prepping for a race or assembling a Caterham 7 kit car. Expect a lot of friendly (?) verbal repartee: the presenters quite like taking digs at each other.
    -   Ruthlessly parodied in the Bolivian Special, when the presenters pull a deliberate caricature of one of these showing them hacking their way through a rainforest; afterwards, Clarkson realizes that he left his cellphone back at the river and walks back to get it. That takes about twenty seconds.
-   Quite obviously every single episode of _Trading Spaces_.
-   _The Wire_: One of the best examples of this comes in the season 2 episode "Storm Warnings". It opens with Prez trying to straighten out the Big Board while we see the rest of the Major Crimes Unit doing surveillance on their target (while also seeing them watch Prez at work), all set to Johnny Cash's "I Walk the Line". At the end, at night, we see Prez has organized everything neatly.
-   Occasionally used on _The X-Files_ when agents Mulder and Scully needed to do some research on the case or had to investigate.
    -   "Squeeze": Mulder and Scully need to find something on Eugene Victor Tooms who Mulder believes is a mutant Serial Killer. They are shown to be going through the information for hours. All the find is an address of the investigating officer of his previous murders from 1933.
    -   "The Grotesque": Mulder goes to the library and studies about gargoyles.

    Music and Music Videos 

-   In the music video for "Dancing On My Own Ground" by Lawrence Gowan (currently the lead singer of Styx), clips of him and his band playing the song within a luggage case are intercut with a woman returning to an empty house<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and gradually restoring it to a habitable state by getting rid of dust and squatters' junk, restoring furniture and drapery, and shovelling snow outside.
-   Cat Hairballs is almost entirely a hard work montage, where Stimpy is forced to continuously hwarf hairballs onto a productionline while Ren stamps them with approval. By the end, Stimpy is naked and totally hwarfed out. Which results in Stimpy falling unconscious on the conveyor belt and getting stamped right on the ass.

    Puppet Shows 

-   Lampshaded in _The Muppets (2011)_.
    
    **Walter:** Don't you remember? You guys are the Muppets! You do this kind of thing to music! (_cue "We Built This City"_)
    
-   _Team America: World Police_ has a very literal song about a montage while Gary is training to fight Kim Jong Il.

    Theater 

-   In the Broadway musical _Xanadu_, there is a montage of all of the characters breaking ground and constructing the club Xanadu, set to the song "All Over The World" by ELO. Because this sequence also appears in the film version, they even hang a lampshade over this!

    Video Games 

-   In _Grow Valley_ the designer can be seen working furiously on his projects at his desk also before you win the game there are several tiny montage showing all the different experts working on their domains.
-   _LEGO Dimensions_ has BA Baracus engage in this whenever he uses his Master Build ability, with his show's theme song playing over shots of him using various tools to build a new model (in contrast with the game's other Master Builders, who just jump around and quickly assemble the pieces together).
-   _Red Dead Redemption II_ features an _interactive_ montage, complete with music, in the building of a house.
-   Done in more tragic fashion in _Xenoblade Chronicles 3_ with a montage of most of the party struggling in futility to break out of a prison cell after having been depowered as Mio's last month of life passes by.

    Web Animation 

-   One of the 2002 _BIONICLE_ flash animations showed the construction of the Boxor machine with a Hard-Work Montage of preparation, welding and so forth — well, _mostly_ a Hard-Work Montage. Taipu just dances around holding a Bohrok headplate over his head, pretending to be a Bohrok.
-   Lampshaded in a _Strong Bad Email_
    
    **Strong Bad:** Digging is hard, man! Did you ever try to dig a hole? It's not all wipes and montages like in the movies. It takes forever!
    
-   Played for laughs in the episode, "Hammer and Fail of _Eddsworld_. After Matt returns with "anything that isn't nails", Tom asks Edd what's next on the checklist. He looks and states that's the "Obligatory Building Montage". Then Tom sighs and heads off to go get the music started.

    -   Spoofed: while training to be a Dashing Swordsman, Elan goes through what appears to be a typical training montage, but then the following exchange occurs:
        
        **Elan:** How come we've only been doing this for twenty minutes, but you've already changed the backdrop five times and gone through three costumes?  
        **Captain Scoundrél:** Elan, never underestimate the value of a good Training Scene Montage. It could save your life someday.
        
    -   Later, they do an actual hard work montage when looking for the hidden entrance to Girard's dungeon.
        
        **Elan:** If there's one thing I know, it's that you can't have a good montage without an 80's-style power ballad in the background.
        
-   _Sailor Ranko_: Sailor Mercury, trying to build a portal of her own to save Ranma and Akane.
-   In _Sinfest_, the trike feminists cut down the poles, start welding, and then do a lot of work indicated only by Sound Effects — followed by a night scene panel. (The last two hide their handiwork for the last panel.)
-   _xkcd_ compares a movie science montage and a real-world one in this strip.

    Web Original

When they realize there's only twenty minutes left till the test, Brian says, "Crap, all we've done is work out." Actually a spoof of the training montage from _Rocky IV_ when the titular character trains in Siberia, complete with the same music and the odd farm implement training method.
    -   Also in "Wasted Talent", where Peter performs several complex science experiments involving lasers and such to figure out that 4-1=3.
-   The entirety of the _Happy Harmonies_ short "To Spring" is built around this.
-   About halfway through the pilot episode of _House of Mouse_ we get to see a montage of Donald Duck making an attempt to replace the sign near the entrance with one that reads "House of Duck," but instead he gets signs that end with words that rhyme with "duck." Toward the end of the montage, the sign is replaced with one that reads "House of Pancakes" before finally switching to the correct one.
-   _King of the Hill_ episode "No Bobby Left Behind" has this. The montage shows the less experienced middle school students being taught efficiently in order to get them ready for the standardized test. Before, they were sent to special needs class where they were exempt from taking the test.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   The episode "Winter Wrap-Up" uses two of these, one as a Crowd Song and another as the climax.
    -   "It's About Time" has a montage of the citizens of Ponyville disaster-proofing their town.
    -   There's another in "Apple Family Reunion" with the song "Raise This Barn", in which the Apple family raises their new barn.
    -   Yet another song version is done in "Castle Sweet Castle", showing Twilight's friends working hard to decorate her new home, only to show at the end that they've turned the place into a cluttered mess. There's later a reprise showing the five making another renovation: a chandelier fashioned from the root of Twilight's old tree home, adorned with gems containing her memories with them.
    -   Season 9's "The Summer Sun Setback" features this near the end, as Twilight, her friends, the princesses, all the ponies, and even Discord work together to undo all the disasters caused to Canterlot, in preparation for the last Summer Sun Celebration ever.
-   Spoofed in one episode of _The Penguins of Madagascar_, where they decide to fix a broken robot. After the montage, Skipper says, "Well, now that we fixed the coffee machine, let's get working on that robot."
    -   Also spoofed in another episode, where the penguins build a submarine. Then they realize they can't get the sub outside, so the montage runs in reverse as they dismantle it to rebuild it outside.
-   _Phineas and Ferb_: "It usually takes us at least a montage."
-   _Robot Chicken_ has the superhero Montage. He helps others do a lot in a short amount of time. He can also age someone by several decades within mere seconds.
-   Spoofed in the _Sealab 2021_ episode "Sharko's Machine", where Sharko performs a variety of bizarre tasks to prepare for a citizenship test.
-   In _The Simpsons_ episode "Flamin' Moe", Moe's closes for renovations, with a sign outside reading "Closed for 'Hard Work' Montage". The montage itself is just shots of the outside while Moe talks about what he's doing.
-   _Sonic Boom_ parodies this in at least two instances. In the first, the episode "Hedgehog Day" has Robotnik furiously going over all of the math he can think of in order to deduce how to end his "Groundhog Day" Loop. We see complex equations scroll across the air as he goes, only for him to turn and tell Cubot to stop messing with his hologram projector. Cubot shuts it off, and the floating equations go away. In a later episode, Battle of the Boy Bands, the group starts a montage to learn a dance routine which takes all of a few seconds. They decide to use the rest of their "montage time" to come up with a name, which proves far harder than learning to dance. It ends when calendar pages fly across the screen, implicating time passing, when in reality it's just Knuckles tearing apart the calendar for no logical reason.
-   _South Park_:
    -   Satirized in the episode "Asspen", with a montage song, played over... well, a montage. The lyrics of this song are pretty apt, but may not be appropriate to post here. The same song with minor lyric changes was later used in _Team America: World Police_.
    -   Another South Park montage, and more of a parody of _CSI_'s montages. In "Cartman's Incredible Gift", the detective goes to killer's house and notices his wall of left hands, but dismisses it because they are palms down, while he looks at his left hand palms up. It does raise his suspicions, and under goes a _CSI_\-like lab work (even forgetting half way through the scene, and where the music stop temporarily) to discover the equivalence between hands palms up and hands palms down.
    -   There was a montage set to The Monkees' "I'm a Believer" in which Randy and the boys raced to find a solution to the problem of farting and global warming, but it turned out to be All Just a Dream of Randy's and they had actually bared started.
    -   The end of "Goobacks" is another example.
-   On _SpongeBob SquarePants_ one such montage actually gets an introduction. In "Home Sweet Pineapple", when SpongeBob's pineapple get eaten by nematodes he and Patrick go through one of these to rebuild it. When the montage ends, the result is only large enough to fit on SpongeBob's head, then it falls apart.
    -   Also happens in "A Friendly Game," when SpongeBob and Patrick build their indoor mini-golf course. "What follows is a brief construction montage..."
-   Subverted by _The Venture Brothers_ It looks like Dr. Venture, Billy Quizboy, and Pete White are working hard to fix a shrinking ray when really, they're writing a top 10 guilty pleasures list.
