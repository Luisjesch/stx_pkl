**Ratchet:** What the...where is everyone?  
**Clank:** I tried to tell you, Ratchet. The database said this planet was deserted ages ago!

What you get when a Ghost Town is global in scale. Another planet or Another Dimension that, by the time we get to see it, has been left in ruins for a long, long time. There are signs here and there that this world once boasted a civilization, maybe even a great civilization, but all that's left now are a few decaying remnants. The world need not be _entirely_ barren of life, but, generally speaking, if there are enough of the original denizens left to form a town or city, it's not a Ghost Planet.

Please keep in mind, a Ghost Planet should _not_ be a future version of our own Earth (or at least not explicitly so). A desolated future Earth would go under Earth That Was. Only alien worlds which have gone through their own Armageddon (somewhere between Class 2 and Class 5 on the Apocalypse How scale) need apply.

Not to be confused with Space Ghost's home planet, or _Ghost World_.

Compare Ghost Town and Ghost City. May be a Beautiful Void.

    Anime and Manga 

-   The Shinigami World from _Death Note_ has hints that things other than shinigami once dwelled in it, or, at least, that shinigami were not always like they now are. There are a few remaining signs that the world once had buildings and maybe even cities, something the dozen or so shinigami we see have neither the energy nor the manpower to do. When you add in the fact that the skulls shinigami gamble with had to come from _someone_, and Rem's comment that shinigami have "evolved" beyond the need for food, you get the impression that the Shinigami World was once a far less desolate place.
-   There are several in the _Dragon Ball_ series, often due to the Monster of the Week wiping out all life. Early on, it's revealed to be the Saiyans' job to clear out planets and sell them, such as Kanassa and Meat. Later on was Namek, another victim of Frieza's troops. Then there was New Planet Vegeta, which was already ruined and about to collide with a meteor. After that was _Earth itself_, thanks to Buu.
-   Two in _Kiddy Grade_, first the space prison that Alv, Dvergr, Éclair, and Lumière are sent to investigate, and later, a space colony that Éclair and Lumière escape to.
-   The Moon Kingdom from _Sailor Moon_ has sat in ruins for over a thousand years by the time it's seen in a non-flashback scene. In the fifth and final arc/season, it's revealed that most of the planets that hold life in the galaxy have been reduced to ghost planets, thanks to the main villain, Galaxia's, conquest.
-   One of the planets visited by the Nirvana in _Vandread_ is like this. The only remaining activity is from an automated defense system left by the people who destroyed the colony there.

    Comic Books 

-   _Green Lantern_: Sector 666, only 5 people survived the slaughter of every living being, all were held in a different sector. Even after the Red Lanterns use one planet in it as home base, it's still ruins as far as the eye can see.
-   Asgard in the _Marvel 100th Anniversary Special_ has long been abandoned by the gods and Yggdrasil's roots have overgrown the ruins.
-   In Issue 14 of _Planetary_, Elijah Snow visits one of these. Yet another one of the Four's atrocities.
-   The Ghost Planet from _Space Ghost_ wasn't an example of this trope _until_ the Darker and Edgier reboot comic miniseries published by DC in 2005. That miniseries' version of Space Ghost's origin story had the future superhero left for dead on a lifeless world — and rescued by the last survivor of the planet's inhabitants, who created the weapons that killed the Ghost Planet, some of which Space Ghost would come to use as his own.
-   _Superman_:
    -   "The Unknown Legionnaire": The Legion of Super-Heroes travels to a remote planet which was colonized by the advanced Llorn civilization in the past; climate change and several worldwide natural catastrophes and environmental disasters, though, resulted in their civilization's collapse. Nowadays, there are only ruins littering the planet.
    -   "The Supergirl Saga": The Pocket Universe Earth was turned into one by the Phantom Zone criminals when they decided to destroy all life on the planet by destabilizing the Earth's core and destroying its atmosphere.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Calvin and Hobbes_: At one point Calvin daydreams about Spaceman Spiff being stranded on one of these. Aided by the fact that he missed the lunch bell and is sitting alone in the classroom.

    Fan Works 

-   The 16th episode of The Silverscale Arena takes place on the Planet Xena, which once had a civilization much like Earth's, but has now been reduced to a wasteland thanks to the constant storms and has been overrun with David 8's latest creations: the Vorealiens.

    Films — Animation 

-   In _Treasure Planet_ the titular planet has been abandoned for at least a century, the only sentient inhabitant left is B.E.N. who was marooned by Flint, presumably right before the pirate's death as his body is seen clutching B.E.N.'s memory circuit. Doppler notes that the ruins on the planet look much older than that, implying that an ancient civilization was the one to construct the planet, and Flint later repurposed it for his own needs.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Battle Beyond the Stars_. Shad goes to a notorious Wretched Hive seeking The Magnificent Seven Samurai only to find the planet deserted except for Professional Killer Gelt (who's only there because he's hiding from everyone else).
    
    **Gelt:** The other planets in the galaxy formed a protective association. They raised an army and cleaned us out. We made them nervous.
    
-   Altair IV in _Forbidden Planet_ contains many still-functioning relics of the hyper-advanced Krell civilization, despite the disappearance of the Krell themselves, which seems to have happened quite suddenly.
-   Marvel Cinematic Universe:
    -   _Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)_: Morag, the planet Peter Quill finds the Orb on. At some point there was life on it, but something destroyed them a long time before and left the planet a volcanic ruin. It is strongly hinted to have been the deed of the Power Stone that's inside the Orb.
    -   _Avengers: Infinity War_: Titan, Thanos' homeworld, which suffered apocalyptic disaster related to their resources. All that's left is massive amounts of wrecked buildings and walkways, since Thanos long since left his home behind.
    -   It's also implied that something else strange happened to the planet, which by the time we see it is experiencing gravitational and rotational anomalies, but this is possibly separate from what killed Thanos' people.
-   The Hell Planet in _Pitch Black_. Also, any world the Necromongers visit is left this way.
-   The planet Miranda in _Serenity (2005)_. The Alliance tested an airborne drug meant to curb violent emotions on the people of the planet and make them compliant. The result was nearly all the population ceasing to fight... followed by them ceasing to do anything else, eventually laying down and dying. The tiny percentage of people who survived had the exact opposite ("paradoxical") reaction, becoming the psychotic and cannibalistic Reavers.
-   Planet Juran in _Ultraman Cosmos 2: The Blue Planet_, formerly full of life, until the Scorpiss invasion - a Horde of Alien Locusts - wipes it blank. The next movie, _Ultraman Cosmos vs. Ultraman Justice: The Final Battle_, have humans planning to transport earth's monsters to the now-deserted Juran, so that the monsters can exist peacefully in an empty planet without interfering with the humans, and eventually in _Ultraman Saga_ it's revealed that Planet Juran was eventually restored to a lush blue planet filled with life and vegetation.

    Literature 

-   In _The Chronicles of Narnia_ novel _The Magician's Nephew_, the city/world of Charn is one of these by the time Digory and Polly arrive. The buildings, sidewalks, and other examples of human industry are mostly intact, though in a state of ruin. However, except for the witch queen Jadis, every other living thing on the planet (including vines partially pulled down walls) was killed by the Deplorable Word. It's more than a little creepy.
-   _Eden Green_ has the title character explore an abandoned planet from which horrifying needle monsters are spreading onto Earth.
-   Paul S. Kemp's _The Twilight War_ trilogy set in the _Forgotten Realms_ reveals that Shar has been doing this to other worlds and intends to do the same to Abeir-Toril.
-   In Isaac Asimov's _Foundation and Earth_, the characters discover some of the planets where space-faring humans first settled, in ruins and devoid of intelligent life.
-   The "pit-stop" planet and alien spaceport in Andre Norton's _Galactic Derelict_. The home planet of the alien spacecraft is still inhabited by two primitive alien tribes who are at war, but it is made clear that they are not the civilization that built the ruined city they dwell in.
-   Jonathan Lethem's _Girl in Landscape_ primarily takes place on one which is being sparsely colonized by humans. There are still a few lingering aliens, but they have only a passive interest in either the humans or the relics of their ruined civilization.
-   _The Lost Fleet_ series details a number of solar systems that had once been host to heavy traffic but have been bypassed by the time the titular fleet passes through because the Portal Network rendered the old mode of system-to-system hyperspace travel obsolete. Some of these systems have been completely abandoned, while others still have dwindling populations that lack the means to leave (there aren't any spaceships passing through anymore, after all).
-   Mars in Ray Bradbury's _The Martian Chronicles_ is like this, showing signs of a Crystal Spires and Togas civilization.
-   Mars in H. Beam Piper's short story "Omnilingual" .His short story "Graveyard of Dreams", later expanded into the novel _The Cosmic Computer_, took its title from a poem by a colonist on Mars who was apparently inspired by the planet's ruins.
-   Alastair Reynolds:
    -   _Revelation Space_ has an archaeologist main character and the plot centers on the mystery behind the dead Amarantin civilization.
    -   _House of Suns_ has the galaxy littered with the remnants of human civilization; in an Ungovernable Galaxy with no Faster-Than-Light Travel or Subspace Ansible, human civilizations surge up before withering away after a few thousand years from internal pressure. Every system that the protagonists visit have some trace of human habitation, such as an asteroid belt littered with derelict ships or nanotech-infused clouds on planets.
-   The fourth _Skulduggery Pleasant_ book features a Ghost _Universe_. Everything in it has been murdered by the Faceless Ones.
-   _Star Wars Expanded Universe_:
    -   In the Short Story _The End of History_, Antron Back hides himself and a collection of Jedi artifacts on a nameless and abandoned moon that had once been colonized by Geonosians, who left tunnel systems the size of cities behind which made for a perfect hiding spot.
-   _Star Wars Legends_:
    -   Kiva, in _Galaxy of Fear_. It's without life except for the furious ghosts of the people who lived there, and mentioned to be charcoal-colored when seen from orbit.
    -   _Revan_, a tie-in novel to _Star Wars: The Old Republic_, reveals the Sith Emperor's homeworld of Nathema to be one of these. His ascension to immortality involved a Force ritual that consumed every living thing on the planet. Several hundred years later, the bodies are still there exactly as they died, because the microorganisms that would normally decompose them were all killed. It's hinted that the Emperor intends to repeat this process for the entire galaxy, and this scares the handful of Sith who know about it enough that they're secretly planning to assassinate him.
    -   _Darth Bane:_ Tython, once the home of the first people to use the Force, has become this by the time Bane passes through.
-   In _The Wandering_, Neshi visits many of these, all of which were destroyed (presumably) by the Natasians.
-   Charles Stross's _A Colder War_: The Downer Ending involves the remnants of humanity eking out an existence in the Domed City XK-Masada, entered through a Cool Gate to a planet nearing the end of its tectonic life with the ruins of a long-disappeared civilization. The Rule of Symbolism is obvious to everyone. Earth That Was has long since become this trope once the Eater of Souls consumed everyone there.
-   _Shades of Magic_: Black London, the world whose life was devoured by the magical entity Osaron, is left in an eternal twilight where dust hangs forever in the air and everything that remains is transmuted into black glass.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._, Maveth has become one of these. The ancient civilization has long since fallen, and the planet is reduced to a desert that is nearly Always Night, and there is _something_ malevolent controlling the frequent sandstorms.
-   Markab Prime and Daltron 7 become ghost planets in _Babylon 5_.
    -   In the B5 spin-off _Crusade_, a number of these are also visited.
-   Kobol, Caprica, and "Earth" in _Battlestar Galactica_. Technically, New Caprica also becomes one, though only after one year of habitation.
-   Carl Sagan's _Cosmos: A Personal Voyage_ (a documentary series) included model shots of a fictional Mars fitting this trope, before going on to describe what Mars is _really_ like.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   Skaro, the Dalek homeworld also counts for a large part of the series between the times when the Daleks would abandon and reclaim it.
    -   Several examples in the old series, too, including Exxilon in "Death to the Daleks".
    -   "The Impossible Planet"/"The Satan Pit": Krop Tor was once inhabited, a long time ago, by people who left behind ruins and writing. But now, it's a desolate rock in an impossible orbit around an Unrealistic Black Hole.
    -   The planet-sized Library has a million million intelligent lifeforms following a catastrophe 100 years prior, though the Doctor and his allies can't seem to find any of them. There's a species of flesh-eating bacteria that can move small objects and think through a hive mind, but are generally stupid due to their weakness to light and subsequent minimal populations — then they get into a library through infested paper, and it turns out there's enough darkness, unwitting civilians, and information to develop sentience.
    -   San Helios in "Planet of the Dead". Despite no signs of life apart from the planet-destroying stingrays, the city was fine a year a before the story. Carmen the psychic can hear the voices of its dead residents.
    -   "The Ghost Monument" has the appropriately-named Desolation. The Doctor, searching for what happened to destroy the planet's civilization, discovers that the Stenza conquered the planet and forced kidnapped scientists to create horrific weaponry that destroyed the biosphere.

-   _Lost in Space_ - Although not developed afterwards, implied by the subterranean dead city on the Robinsons' first planetfall.

-   _Red Dwarf_: The episode "Back to Reality" has the main characters exploring an ocean moon where they've found a crashed ship, and despite the log mentioning plenty of life, all the boys find as they explore are lots of corpses. Suicide corpses. Turns out one specific example of that wildlife is responsible.
    
    **Lister:** What are you implying, Kryten?  
    **Kryten:** No implication intended, sir.  
    **Lister:** Yes there is. You're implying there's something out there. Some weird prehistoric leviathan that's porked its way through the entire ocean.  
    **Kryten:** That is one possibility.  
    **Lister:** Any alternatives?  
    **Kryten:** None that occur.
    
-   _Stargate_:
    -   Happened quite often in _Stargate SG-1_. Sometimes it was a plague, or technology gone wrong, or something else horrible happened to wipe out life on the planet. It was rarely not spooky. It's also mentioned frequently that the Goa'uld will take steps to cripple or wipe out any culture within their territory whose technology level begins to pose a threat. Also, the Ancients left a lot of places and things behind when they decided it'd be a good idea to Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence without doing anything about the various powerful artifacts of doom they left lying around.
    -   On the spinoff series _Stargate Atlantis_, the main team operates out of a formerly dead city left behind by the Ancients ten thousand years ago, and finds many more ruins left behind by them.
-   In the _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode "Let This Be Your Last Battlefield", the planet Cheron ended up this way. So was the Time Vortex Planet from "The City On The Edge Of Forever" and "Yesteryear", but for different reasons.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Echo V was home to the Iktomi in _Eclipse Phase_. Now there's nothing but cobwebs. Literally.
-   The _Fate Core_ setting _Ghost Planets_ has this as it's main premise. In the 23rd century, humanity finds itself alone in the galaxy but there are remnants of thousands of alien civilizations. Figuring what mysterious event destroyed these civilizations and how humanity can avoid it is the main goal of the player characters.
-   Several Classic _Traveller_ adventures had planets like this, including _Adventure 4 Leviathan_ and _Double Adventure 5 The Chamax Plague_.
-   Happens occasionally in the _Warhammer 40,000_ universe.
    -   Sometimes it happens when a planet gets swallowed up in a Warp space related-anomaly, and that world is physically twisted, or sometimes it becomes a haunted planet with no sign of the original human population. Most often, however, this trope describes worlds that were all that was left behind after an Exterminatus.
    -   On other occasions, an entire planet's populace may be abducted by hostile aliens, particularly the Dark Eldar or Necrons.
    -   During one notable incident, a Night Lords raid killed the population of an entire planet... without damaging _a single building_.
-   Phyrexia was this in _Magic: The Gathering_ and ultimately became one again. Created by a powerful god-like being, the plane was abandoned after his death. It was eventually discovered by the outcast physician Yawgmoth. After suitable scheming Yawgmoth then fused himself to the plane arcane ritual, transforming himself into Yawgmoth the Machine-God, preeminent villain of _Magic's_ multiverse. Phyrexia—composed of nine concentric spheres reminiscent of Dante's nine circles of Hell—was ultimately doomed. Without its creator to correct it, the unnatural plane would slowly collapse, eventually crumpling entirety. Yawgmoth's master plan was to invade his home plane of Dominaria and use it as a permanent seat of power. This invasion ultimately failed, killing Yawgmoth in the process. Years later, the godling Karona would visit Phyrexia, and find it again abandoned, awaiting its final collapse.
    -   This trope was narrowly averted for the plane of Zendikar during the events of the _Rise of the Eldrazi, Battle for Zendikar,_ and _Oath of the Gatewatch_ expansions. When released from their prison, the Eldrazi began to consume the planet down to the bedrock, leaving only pearlescent wastelands behind. It was strongly implied that Zendikar was doomed to be converted into a Ghost Planet this way. Thanks to the quick actions of the Gatewatch, the planet was merely maimed, rather than destroyed.

    Video Games 

-   A ghost _system_ in _Alien Legacy_. When the UNS _Calypso_ arrives to the Beta Caeli system, the crew is woken up from cryosleep, and the Captain reads all the messages received from Earth since their departure centuries (if not millennia) ago. One of these notifies you that another ship was sent to the same system just over a decade after the _Calypso_'s departure. However, due a slightly more efficient drive, it was supposed to have arrived to Beta Caeli about two decades before you. So, naturally, you expect to find a colonized system with thousands of settlers awaiting your arrival. What you find are planets filled with ruins of the colonies and no trace of the UNS _Tantalus_, the _Calypso_'s sister-ship. Besides settling the system, much of the game involves tracking down the clues and figuring out what happened to the other ship and the colonists. The ship was scrapped for parts by order of her captain, and most of the shuttle fleet was later wiped out in a suicidal charge on the H'riak seedship hiding in the system, leaving the major colonies on the two habitable worlds and numerous tiny outposts isolated from one another; then the habitable planets' native life went insane and wiped out the colonists there; eventually, the isolated outposts died out too.
-   In the higher levels of _City of Heroes_, you get the chance to go dimension hopping, discovering several Ghost Dimensions, including a literal Ghost Dimension where the calamity that wiped out the entire population was _you_. Needless to say, the ghosts aren't happy to see you.
-   _Dead Space 3_ takes this to a chilling extreme. Not only is the planet of Tau Volantis a ghost planet, this game reveals that the setting is essentially a ghost _galaxy_ thanks to the Brethren Moons periodically turning the populations of entire worlds into Necromorphs and consuming them to propagate their own race.
-   LucasArts' old PC adventure game, _The Dig_. Astronauts end up playing archaeologist in the ruins of an alien civilization.
-   It is only a minor element of the setting (absolutely nothing encourages you to land, it's just possible in case you want to read the flavour text), but Neo New York in _Escape Velocity Nova_ is this — once a prosperous colony, a terrible plague swept through it, destroying the entire biosphere. The planetary image wouldn't look out of place for any of the more inhabited Federation colonies, although the fact that the fog surrounding the skyscrapers is green is somewhat telling...
-   _Final Fantasy XIII:_ 500 years ago, there was a war between the Floating Continent of Cocoon and the planet Pulse, and the inhabitants of Cocoon still fear Pulse. When we reach Pulse, there are a lot of animals and some ruins, but no people. The former inhabitants seem to have died off after the war, but the game doesn't go out of its way to explain what happened to them.
-   _Halo_: The myriad planets and installations built by the Forerunners, including the eponymous ringworlds, are ghost space constructs.
-   Lh'owon from _Marathon_ was razed by Pfhor slavers. It is mostly a desert, with a few instances of nasty wildlife and a token Pfhor garrison.
-   _Mass Effect_
    -   Ilos from _Mass Effect_ fits the bill, and the place is appropriately creepy to boot. Every party member comments on how unsettling it feels, and that they _shouldn't_ be there, except Wrex (who's just happy to kill stuff) and Liara (who is practically bouncing with excitement). Earlier on, you also visit Feros, a former City Planet built by the Precursors, now comprised only of lonely skyscraper spires jutting up from the perpetual layer of dust that _still_ hasn't settled, 50,000 years since the planet's demise.
    -   In _Mass Effect 2_, once you start looking at places off the beaten track you'll notice that there are a _lot_ of dead planets out there. Time and again seemingly empty systems will have burial grounds, ruins or even just million-year-old mass accelerator craters spread across the planet. The phrase "Bombardment was focused on population centres" appears far too often for comfort. Of course, this all makes sense, since every 50,000 years the Reapers show up and kill all sentient lifeforms.
    -   _Mass Effect 3_ reveals that Ilos was a ghost planet when the _Protheans_ found it, and the statues are implied to depict the once native Inusannon. Subsequent playthroughs of the first game, knowing that both the Inusannon and the Protheans became extinct on this world makes it even _more_ creepy.
-   _Metroid_: Most of worlds visited by Samus Aran. And if they weren't at first, they are when she leaves. If they're still there.
-   _Nexus Clash_: In one sequence, some of the ways to get lost in a planar maze left in the wake of a Spacetime Eater can drop players into one of these. It has no name, few surviving plants and animals, no useful resources, and the few signs of habitation all suggest that its entire history consisted of plague, failure and neglect. In contrast to the exhaustive histories provided for most Nexus locations, good or bad, we never get any explanation for it.
-   _Radiant Silvergun_'s prologue has the Stone-Like destroy all life on the planet, leaving only four humans and their robot companion as the survivors because they managed to escape the Earth's atmosphere beforehand. The game's first stage takes place a year after the catastrophe, with the survivors having to return to Earth due to being low on supplies.
-   _Ratchet & Clank_:
    -   The page quote comes from _Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction_—the titular duo learn about a planet inhabited by Ratchet's species the Lombaxes named "Fastoon," and immediately take an escape pod to go there. Once they arrive, Ratchet discovers that the Lombaxes had long abandoned the planet, a fact that Clank had tried to tell him beforehand.
    -   _Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus_ has an entire ghost _sector_ — the entirety of Zarkov Sector of the Polaris galaxy was evacuated by order of a former galactic president due to it being "haunted." In reality these "hauntings" were the result of the game's villains Vendra and Neftin Progg trying to bring the Nethers into their dimension. Planets explored in this sector are Yerek, Silox, Kragg (which acts as the game's Gladiator Subquest due to the Thugs-4-Less moving in), and Thram.
-   _Schizm: Mysterious Journey_ cribs from _Forbidden Planet_ as well—everyone on the world you're exploring just _vanished_ in what must have been a single day, leaving behind unfinished work and uneaten meals. The initial research team vanished more slowly, and had enough time to leave behind increasingly panicky audio diaries speculating on what the hell was going on. What's left is a rather sinister Beautiful Void. Subverted in the end. Everyone is still alive, but they were transported into separate dimensions so that the planet's defense system could observe them and determine if they were a threat.
-   The "Forbidden Planet" in _Sigma Star Saga_ takes this trope more literally than most—you'll find yourself under attack from levitating tombstones. Turns out the former inhabitants had(/have) a _serious_ grudge against the aliens you've allied with, and not even death is stopping them from revenge. In a notorious bug, those tombstones are the most lethal enemy in the game; killing one to end the level will instead trap you in purgatory forever.
-   In _Spore_, one of the planets in your home system has a crashed alien spaceship on it. Before they died, the survivors left directions to a nearby system, which turns out to be a ruined planet that was devastated by the Grox. Some theories suggest that the ruins may be human in origin, especially when you consider that Earth is deserted when you discover it.
-   _Starbound_ has Barren planets, which are, well... barren. Barren planets are contrasted with other worlds by their absolute lack of anything; creatures, ores, plants, even weather. Generally, the whole point of such planets is to construct buildings and settlements on them thanks to their relatively flat topography and lack of hazards (barring fall damage, of course).
-   _Star Control 2_ - the Taalo homeworld (sterilized by mind-controlled Ur-Quan), the Burvixese homeworlds (wiped out by the Kohr-Ah after being betrayed by the Druuge), and the Androsynth's adopted homeworld ("Androsynth are not here. Only Orz is here"). Also, any alien homeworld becomes one once the Kohr-Ah reach it on their Death March.
-   The planet Ultimacrash from _Starshot: Space Circus Fever_ is another literal version of the trope. It's surrounded by spaceship debris and is inhabited by the ghosts of space travelers whose ships crashed into it, hence its name and reputation as "the gloomiest place in the galaxy".
-   _Stellaris_
    -   Tomb Worlds are blasted, irradiated hellholes that are usually the result of a species wiping itself out in a nuclear war, though certain factions able to use the "Apocalyptic" Orbital Bombardment policy can make a "fresh" Tomb World. Most species in the galaxy can only colonize a Tomb World through the use of lategame technologies, but races with the "Post-Apocalyptic" trait can settle them from the get-go. In rare cases, a planetary event may have colonists discover bomb shelters that the Tomb World's original inhabitants built, which may or may not be occupied. Another event has colonists shift towards the Pacifistic ethos after being surrounded by reminders of the horrors of war.
    -   With the _Apocalypse_ expansion, you can cleanse a world of higher lifeforms while leaving its infrastructure intact with the Neutron Sweeper superweapon, though if you colonize it immediately afterward there will be a habitability penalty due to lingering radiation.
    -   The _Ancient Relics_ expansion introduces Relic Worlds, former City Planets that have been reduced to planet-wide ruins. They can be refurbished at great expensive, but their real value is in the archeological artifacts left behind.
    -   This is also the doom of colonies that have fallen to the Unbidden - the buildings remain, but the colonists are just _gone_. Which makes them a really nice spot to (re)settle once the Unbidden are taken care of.
-   _Tales Series_:
    -   This is the planet Quartia in _Tales of Hearts_. Everything inhabiting the planet quite literally had the life sucked out of it.
    -   Similarly, Fodra from _Tales of Graces_, however there are a few survivors, instead of machines.
-   In the _Xtended_ Game Mod for _X3: Terran Conflict_, the Expansion system Portal Network is littered with the remnants of Terran colonies that were wiped out 800 years ago when their AI terraformer fleets went haywire and started "terraforming" inhabited worlds. The modern Terrans under the Earth State government control the majority of these abandoned ghost planets, but a few are under the control of the Boron Kingdom or Split Dynasty, which has caused some friction between the races.
-   This trope certainly applies in force once you reach Old Miltia in the third episode of _Xenosaga_ - the entire planet is completely devoid of human life, though all the trappings of the setting's technologically-advanced society are in place, adding to the creep factor.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Homestuck_, Jane's Land, the Land of Crypts and Helium, is almost completely lifeless save for a few plants that have managed to cling to life. All the Alpha Kids' Lands are the same.
-   In _A Miracle of Science_, Mars finds many of these when searching for other intelligent life in the universe.
-   The Dimension of Pain from _Sluggy Freelance_ is eventually revealed to be one of these. It originally just seemed to be a barren, rocky world populated by a smattering of demons. It's not until the end of the "That Which Redeems" arc that we discover the dimension originally belonged to a race of human-like beings, whom the demons overthrew. Over the centuries the demons wiped out all other life in the dimension. They even devoured the original inhabitants' souls and destroyed everything they had built, save for a single, ruined city, preserved as a testament to the demons' victory. It is also implied that these 'demons' were actually mutants created by Nofun labs, and the same could happen to the main dimension as well.
-   _Subnormality_ gives us Wonte IV. "There was something besides oil that came out when the drills got down there and it didn't mix with the human mind and its fuckin' little creations."

    Western Animation 

-   _Filmation's Ghostbusters_ was fond of ghost planets, featuring at least two or three throughout its 65-episode run.
-   _Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures_ implies that the Ghosteroids are the ghosts of life-bearing planets that suffered a Class 6 Apocalypse How and the alien ghosts that live on it were the natives on that planet, thus making this a literal case of this trope.
-   _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_: In "Sacrifice", Yoda journeys to the long-abandoned planet Moraband, the Sith homeworld (better known as Korriban) as the final stage of his Vision Quest. Between the stains of the Dark Side and the ancient ruins, the place has an appropriately creepy air.
-   _Star Wars Rebels_:
    -   When the _Ghost_ crew first visits Geonosis, in "The Honourable Ones", they find they can't detect any life signs from the planet, and Ezra can sense an aura of death surrounding the planet.
