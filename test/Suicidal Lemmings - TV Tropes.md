_"I've known depressed lemmings on window ledges with better survival instincts than you."_

Rodents in fiction tend to have specialized and clichéd roles. The mouse steals food (especially cheese) while avoiding cats and other predators, the rat is like a food-stealing mouse that also spreads disease and is much more unpleasant, the beaver busily builds dams, the squirrel acts nutty (pun not intended), and the hamster and guinea pig act as adorable house pets. One rodent, the lemming, has a special role: killing themselves.

Fictional lemmings tend to be based almost exclusively around urban legends according to which food shortages lead the rodents to engage in millions-strong mass migrations, where the masses of rodents wander purposefully but aimlessly and inevitably perish when they run headlong into great danger — including, most iconically, seaside cliffs. Some works omit the reasons behind the migration entirely, depicting lemmings as simply possessing innate urges to throw themselves off of high places. These depictions often also incorporate An Aesop about herd mentality, the idea being that the lemmings mindlessly do what the rest of the swarm is doing, even when this will lead them to throw themselves to their deaths.

A good deal of Artistic License – Biology is at play here: while it is true that real life lemmings jump off some cliffs, it's done for the purpose of migration. It is not the mass suicide that the media claims it to be; the Square-Cube Law is on their side so terminal velocity usually won't harm them. Falls also happen by accident when a thick crowd runs _alongside_ a cliff. That doesn't stop writers from milking the legend for all it's worth, if for no other reason than that it's amusing. This originally entered the pop-culture consciousness due to the 1958 Disney documentary _White Wilderness_, during the filming of which filmmakers purposely drove lemmings off cliffs to record footage of their demise.

Subtrope to Somewhere, a Mammalogist Is Crying. Will double as Suicide as Comedy if the trope is played for dark laughs. Not to be confused with Gullible Lemmings — an entirely different trope about naivety — though it is the Trope Namer for it.

    Advertising 

-   The follow-up ad to Apple’s “1984” ad portrayed people as lemmings waddling off a cliff unless they looked into the new Macintosh Office.
-   _Cadbury's Caramel Bunny_: One advertisement featured a lemming that was rather enthusiastically about to run off of a cliff... until the bunny gets his attention.

    Comic Books 

-   _Disney Ducks Comic Universe_: In Carl Barks' "The Lemming With the Locket" (which was adapted in the _DuckTales (1987)_ episode "Scrooge's Pet"), the boys get Uncle Scrooge a pet lemming, who runs off to Norway to migrate, carrying Scrooge's locket (which has the new combination to the money bin) with him.

    Comic Strips 

    Films — Animation 

-   _Chicken Little_: Parodied; there is a news report on the panic caused by the title character focusing on a group of lemmings who, unable to find a cliff, start jumping off park benches.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The Disney documentary _White Wilderness_ is notorious for codifying this trope. The documentary contains a scene that supposedly depicts a mass lemming migration that ends with the lemmings jumping to their deaths into the Arctic Ocean. Though the film flatly says that the cliff-jumping is probably less suicide and more migration, it is notorious nowadays for the fact that lemmings were pushed off the cliffs for the sake of showing them being killed on-camera during its production, and for importing a truck-load of lemmings that weren't native to the filming location for the purpose of killing them.

    Literature 

-   _The Book of Bunny Suicides_: One strip has a bunny riding with a group of lemmings on a skateboard as they jump off a cliff.
-   _Deathstalker_: Mentioned and Played for Laughs in one of the books, in which Oz (Owen's quirky AI sidekick) notes that "I've known depressed lemmings on window ledges with better survival instincts than you."
-   _Discworld_: The Discworld has a relative of the lemming called the vermine. Due to being descended from those rodents who were a bit more careful about leaping off cliffs than their cousins, they now only leap from very small pebbles, abseil down cliffs, and build small rafts to cross rivers. When they do reach the seaside, they just kind of sit around awkwardly taking in the view before going home early to beat the traffic.
-   _Trollogy_: Parodied. A lemming feels duty-bound to commit suicide but keeps getting saved from his various attempts by the main character.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Most Extreme_: In the "Animal Myths" episode, the lemmings are the number 1 myth and the episode explains what the people behind _White Wilderness_ (though the episode does not say it by name) did to the lemmings. They filmed the migration sequence by placing lemmings on a snow-covered turntable. Then to add a little drama, they went outside and herded the lemmings towards a cliff by a river.
-   _Red Dwarf_:
    -   In "Stasis Leak", Rimmer, wallowing in misery at how everyone and everything always goes wrong for him in the end, recalls having a pet lemming as a boy. He states that he built the lemming a little wall for him to hurl himself off of. Eventually the Lemming bit Rimmer on the finger and wouldn't let go, causing him to have to smash its brain out against his bedroom wall, thus completely ruining his helicopter wallpaper. The little git!
    -   The idea is used metaphorically in "The Last Day", when the Epic Fail of Rimmer's day working for the Samaritans made the papers as "Lemming Sunday" as five people he had spoken to over the phone decided to jump off buildings. One of them was a wrong number; he only wanted the Cricket scores.

    Video Games 

-   _Deadly Rooms of Death: The Second Sky_ features Lemmings as enemies in the level Lemming Beach, some of which have teeth as sharp as Beethro's sword. While they will stop if they reach the boundaries of a pit or some water, should those Lemmings go towards a bomb or powder keg, the results are generally not in their favor.
-   _Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist_: Freddy saves the town from a horde of stampeding snails by diverting them into a chasm. The narration notes that they "look just like little lemmings, marching over that cliff" and the cutscene of snails falling to their doom is a pretty obvious Shout-Out to _Lemmings_.
-   _The Jackbox Party Pack_: In _Quiplash 2_, one of the possible comics for a Comic-Lash round involves a group of lemmings parading off of a cliff.
-   _Lemmings_ involves guiding a group of lemmings, here depicted as vaguely-anthropomorphic, green-haired, blue-robed humanoids who are not so much suicidal as they are incredibly careless. Unless you instruct them otherwise, the lemmings will blindly march forward, turning around if they bump into a wall or a Blocker lemming, and keep going until they reach the exit for the stage, fall off a too-tall cliff, drown in water, or blunder into a booby trap.
-   _Viva Piñata_: While regular Lemmonings show no suicidal tendencies in the game like they do in the cartoon, Sour Lemmonings will self-destruct when angered, leaving behind sour candy and weed seeds (doubling as a reference to the urban myth about lemmings spontaneously exploding).

    Webcomics 

-   _The Order of the Stick_: One of the voting incentive comics shows a "Dire Lemming", which instead of attacking Roy runs past him and off a cliff.

    Web Original 

-   One of the Fakemon introduced in _The Kaskade Region_ series is Folleming, an Electric/Psychic type rodent that travels in groups, led by a "guru" Folleming (which possesses a long cult-leader-esque beard) that mind-controls lesser Folleming to become its followers.

    Western Animation 

-   The _Ace Ventura: Pet Detective_ Animated Adaptation: One episode involved an attempt to murder someone by poisoning them with lemming hormones, so they would throw themselves off a seaside cliff.
-   _BoJack Horseman_: In "BoJack the Feminist", Princess Carolyn remarks to Vance Waggoner that producers blindly follow each other like lemmings. A nearby lemming family gets offended, and remarks that they're going to go find the nearest cliff.
-   _George of the Jungle (2007)_: In one episode, George saves a group of lemmings jumping off a cliff. He is bored with it because they keep doing it every year.
-   The Bakshi _Mighty Mouse_ episode "Still Oily After All These Years" features an Amish farmer asking Mighty Mouse's help in corralling his flock of runaway lemmings. The farmer is working against nature, says Mighty Mouse, and the farmer concedes.
-   The _Molly of Denali_ episode "Bye Bye Birdie" plays with this trope. The episode has puffins jumping off a cliff much like lemmings would. Molly and Trini are worried about them, and though it's never said outright, it's clear that they think the puffins are killing themselves (or at least severely injuring themselves). Turns out the puffins are simply using the cliff to launch themselves for their first flight.
-   _Robot Chicken_: Parodied in a sketch that spoofs nature documentaries, where lemmings gain the title of "Nature's Retards" for not only the typical behavior, but also running right into the path of moving cars, jumping into a blender, and not using condoms.
-   _The Story of Santa Claus_ has the two elf characters trying to decide what should pull the sleigh. Aurora can't remember the problem with lemmings until they start moving, where they promptly hurtle themselves over the cliff.
    
    **Aurora:** I think I remember the bad thing about lemmingssssss... \*the sleigh goes over a cliff\* They like to run off cliffs.
    
-   _Viva Piñata_: Lemmonings get a thrill over running off cliffs as shown in one episode of the cartoon, though they don't really know why. They don't seem to show this trait in the game\- because instead, the Sour Lemmoning explodes itself!
