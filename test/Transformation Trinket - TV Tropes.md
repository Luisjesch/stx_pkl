Magie Bleu. Brand X parfum extraordinaire.

_"With a device that he wears on his arm, he can change his shape and save the world from harm!"_

A Transformation Trinket is an object which is the source of your shapeshifting powers, or at least a focus for them. It is vitally necessary to have your transformation trinket on your person in order to change into your Superpowered Alter Ego. They're common among Henshin Heroes and Magical Girls, and are almost always activated By the Power of Grayskull!.

They may take the form of and double as a Magical Accessory. Belts and belt buckles are common, as are wristbands, jewelry, and, since the Turn of the Millennium, cellphones. Weapons and magic wands/staves/etc. also sometimes double as Transformation Trinkets; see Become Your Weapon. Sometimes swipe-cards, keys or entry-codes are used in conjunction with the item.

Reliance on a Transformation Trinket can be an Achilles' Heel: they are subject to theft, loss, and breakage. Clever villains may also discover how to jam them and block your transformation ability. If your powers are mystical in nature, your trinket might not work unless you have self-confidence or faith in the righteousness of your cause. Beware that chances are you _will_ be in a dangerous situation where the trinket is just out of reach and you'll be frantically reaching for it saying "If I Can Only Move..." The exception is if the object is a Clingy MacGuffin.

They make lovely merchandise for the kids... of all ages. So buy one today!

Compare Clothes Make the Superman and Power-Up Food. Tends to be a form of Amulet of Concentrated Awesome or Signature Device.

If the Transformation Trinket gives you armor, then see Instant Armor.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Akazukin Chacha_: a little unusual in that there were actually three Transformation Trinkets— shared among the three leads— which had to be combined for Chacha to transform.
-   _Animal Detectives Kiruminzoo_ has the eponymous kirumin compacts for the main characters, while the animilians can transform at will.
-   _Ayakashi Triangle_: Exorcist ninja transform into their battle suits (which often include weapons) with some accessory they wear on their person. Matsuri uses a choker which, being somewhat paranoid, he wears everywhere; it replaces the tie for his school uniform and he even keeps it on while bathing. Soga's is a lightning-bolt shaped badge, and Reo's a bracelet. An ayakashi makes a similar devices for Suzu's ayakashi medium outfit in the form of a necklace, which Reo refers to as an "outfitting tool".
-   _Bleach_:
    -   After the Soul Society Arc, Ichigo is given a pendant that ejects his shinigami soul from his body so he can fight monsters. It beats the hell out of his earlier Transformation Trinket, which is a glove Rukia wears while she _punches him in the face_; and Kon, a modified soul inside a candy that displaces his own. Although Kon is still somewhat useful, because Ichigo's body is essentially dead when Ichigo leaves it.
    -   When Rukia is in the real world she uses her own mod soul called "Chappy", which has an irritatingly cute personality (this was what she apparently tried to obtain when Ichigo ended up with Kon).
-   _Blue Exorcist_ has the Kurikara, a demon-slaying sword. When drawn, Rin becomes covered in blue fire and becomes more demonic looking, with bigger fangs, ears, and Fireball Eyeballs. Unusually, he's actually extremely powerful even when it's sheathed. Then again, Kurikara is more Power Limiter that contains his Demon Heart and Rin is a Half-Human Hybrid who already had Super-Strength even _before_ the seals on him were undone.
    -   There's also a downside: the longer the sword is drawn, the more Rin's demonic half takes over, and the more unstable he gets.
-   In _Blue Reflection Ray_, Reflectors rely on their rings to use their magic and transform. They’re powerless if their rings are lost or taken.
-   _Butsu Zone_ - Sannju's armring.
-   In _Cardcaptor Sakura_, it's the trinket _itself_ that transforms, not the magic user. (Her own personal fangirl provides the costumes.) It is a key-like pendant that transforms into a wand, by the way.
-   The pocket watch in _Chrono Crusade_ could be considered to be a very untraditional Transformation Trinket. When Chrono opens the watch, it allows him to turn into his true form—but the watch is what _keeps_ him looking like a young normally. It doesn't make him transform so much as it removes the seal on his powers.
-   _Corrector Yui_ had a wrist-mounted device.
-   _Creamy Mami, the Magic Angel_ has a magic wand in the early episodes; and then a star-shaped ring when the wand is lost.
-   _Cute High Earth Defense Club LOVE!_: The Battle Lovers use their Lovracelets—later True Lovracelets—to transform while Caerula Adamas use finger rings and the VEPPer either use their microphones or the rings circling their neckwears.
    -   The sequel, _Cute High Earth Defense Club Happy Kiss!_ use Happybraces for Magic Knights, and finger rings for Edelstein. Unlike its predecessors, their mascots need to become human to activate.
-   _Cutey Honey_ has her choker. In _Cutey Honey Flash_, she has a matching ring, and in _Cutie Honey: The Live_, her trinket is a pendant that turns into the classic choker when she transforms.
-   _Devil Hunter Yohko_: Finger rings.
-   _Digimon_ has the various incarnations of the Digivice. Instead of transforming the user, however, Digivices transform the user's Bond Creature partner (except in _Tamers_ in the case of Bio-Merging, and in _Frontier_ where there are no partners). Other Transformation Trinkets across the various canons, generally used in conjunction with the Digivice, include the crests, Digimentals, TCG cards and legendary spirits.
-   _Dragon Ball Z_ pulls a satire of this concept when Gohan tries to hide his identity. He goes to Bulma for help, and she provides him with a watch, which contains a costume (completely with goofy-looking helmet) that transforms him into the GREAT SAIYAMAAAAAAN!!! When Videl finds out about this, she gets in on the act and gets a matching outfit to become the Great Saiyawoman.
-   Ai from _Dragon Crisis!_ has a transformation trinket that has been embedded inside her body, that lets her transform into a pseudo-werewolf.
-   _Fancy Lala_: Lala uses a magic pen which she wears as a necklace. The pen is decorated with a small clock whose hands spin forward whenever she transforms.
-   _Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA_: The Kaleidosticks allow its users to enter a Magical Girl trance, granting them access to an unlimited supply of mana. The Class Cards also serve a similar function when installed, granting the user access to the powers of the Heroic Spirit it is based off of.
-   _Flip Flappers_: Cocona, Papika and Yayaka use the Amorphous crystal shards to become their magical girl selves with a wand-esque stick and a bracelet serving as window-dressing for the former two. They evoke their henshins through the phrase "Flip Flapping!"
-   _Floral Magician Mary Bell_ uses a pink tambourine.
-   Guy Shishioh from _GaoGaiGar_ could in fact be considered the trinket himself, as he does technically 1) As cyborg guy have the power batteries that make him go hyper mode integrated into his body, where as 2) Being Evoluder Guy, he literally becomes part of the machines he pilots.
-   _Gatchaman Crowds_ uses _notebooks_. That triple as communication devices and a way of becoming Invisible to Normals.
-   In _Guardian Fairy Michel_, the fairies act as living examples, giving their powers to Michel, who amplifies them.
-   Avoided in the _Guyver_ anime, where Sho Fukamachi grows telepathic transmitters on the back of his neck that summon the Guyver armor.
-   _Hana no Ko Lunlun_ has a magic pin that can change her outfit to suit whatever task is at hand.
-   In Episode 2 of _Higurashi: When They Cry Kira_, Rika and Satoko were given staves that allowed them to transform into magical girls.

-   _Kamichama Karin_ has magic rings that let people transform into Greek gods.
-   _Lyrical Nanoha_:
    -   The weapon _itself_ (known in-universe as a Device) transforms into a pendant, keychain, badge, card, or other item when not in use, and is activated to transform both itself and its user.
    -   Vivio's is a more traditional Magical Girl Transformation Trinket, since it retains its form while changing Vivio to her teenage Magical Girl form. Oh, and it's a bunny plushie.
    -   It should be pointed out that mages are fully capable of using magic without their Devices (Yuuno being a primary example), it's just a lot harder since then they have to do all the calculations for spells in their heads instead of relying on the Devices to do the math for them.
-   In _Magi: Labyrinth of Magic_, mastery of a Metal Vessel allows it to be this, where the user combines with the Djinn contained within to enter a Super Mode.

-   The titular heroine of _Nurse Angel Ririka SOS_ transforms into Nurse Angel using a magical hat which she got as a present.
-   _Ojamajo Doremi_ uses the "taps", circular musical instruments which vaguely resemble tambourines. In the second season, they were replaced by similar-looking devices shaped like flowers. In the third season, they used circular wrist-mounted devices that were attached to rings. Finally, in the fourth season, they use the "Cologne Taps": perfume bottles which, like the _HeartCatch Pretty Cure!_ example above, trigger the transformations with a couple of spritzes; it doesn't help that both series have the same character designer. And while we're at it, Hana-chan had a transformation device that resembled a compact and was activated through the power of the other girls.
-   _Persia, the Magic Fairy_ uses a magic baton.
-   The Burst Hearts of _Pokémon RéBURST_.
-   _Powerpuff Girls Z_ has rings and belt buckles.

    -   The first few continuities use cell phone-like items (which weren't actually operatable as cellphones) called Communes, in which their Weasel Mascots lived.
    -   _Yes! Pretty Cure 5_ uses the wrist-mounted Pinky Catch, then goes back to the cell phone (but without mascots inside), this time called Cure-Mo. Kurumi uses eye shadow palette-like item to transform, which also doubles as a weapon for her finishing attack, and is required to fuse powers from another item to become her second weapon.
    -   _Fresh Pretty Cure!_ had a handheld kind of cellphone that resembled an electronic notebook.
    -   _HeartCatch Pretty Cure!_ has perfume bottles.

    -   _Go! Princess Pretty Cure_ goes back to perfume bottles, with keys inserted within them to activate their powers.
    -   _Maho Girls Pretty Cure!_ uses Mirai's teddy bear as the transformation item for Mirai and Riko. Kotoha used a notebook of plot importance to trigger transformation.
    -   _KiraKira★Pretty Cure à la Mode_ has compacts.
    -   _HuGtto! Pretty Cure_ has another handheld cell-phone like item (which can also function as phones for the girls to talk with each other,) albeit this time it's able to turn into a heart-shaped item when the MacGuffin is inserted to the device.
    -   _Star★Twinkle Pretty Cure_ has pens and pendants. The pendants double as Translator Microbes, which is convenient when they travel to alien planets.
    -   _Healin' Good♡Pretty Cure_ uses batons with the mascots embedded in it. Said batons are also what they use in their moves. Asumi uses her mascot itself to transform.
    -   _Tropical-Rouge! Pretty Cure_ uses compacts and jewelry rings.
    -   _Delicious Party♡Pretty Cure_ uses their respective mascots to transform equivalent to _Mahou_ minus the attachable items. Amane, in the other hand, uses pendant.
    -   _Hirogaru Sky! Pretty Cure_ uses a quill pen that transforms into a baton-like item.
-   _Pretty Sammy_: a baton.
-   _Princess Tutu_ has a pendant for the main character, Ahiru. However, it's not just so she can turn into Princess Tutu—it's also so she can turn into a _girl_. She's really a duck.
    -   Not only that, but it also turns out to be one of the pieces of Mytho's heart, the feeling of hope.
-   _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_: 'Soul Gems'. Kept as a ring most of the time, turned into a Fabergé egg-like trinket when transforming or using magic untransformed, then becomes a Power Crystal of some sort when transformed. And the name is quite literal In fact, the Soul Gem IS the magical girl, and her human body is merely a remotely controlled husk. When she becomes a witch, the Soul Gem turns into a Grief Seed which is then harvested and used by other magical girls to clean _their_ Soul Gems. Lather, rinse, repeat...
-   _Puni Puni☆Poemi_ uses a dead fish. It's that kind of show.
-   _Ronin Warriors_ used crystal marbles. This element wasn't added until around episode 20.
-   Moka from _Rosario + Vampire_ wears a rosary around her neck that only Tsukune can remove. When it's on, she's Outer Moka. When it's off, she's Inner Moka. It's somewhat an inversion though, as the amulet actually serves as more of a suppressor as Inner Moka is the real Moka and Outer Moka is not.
-   _Sailor Moon_: Usagi and Chibiusa used jeweled brooches, while the other Solar-System Senshi used wands. Usagi also had a Disguise Pen (which was used in the first two seasons of the anime, but dropped after that). The Sailor Starlights used head-mounted microphones, and in the live action series, as well as their transformation items (now bracelets), the girls had cellphones which they could use to disguise themselves. Heck, at one point Sailor Moon even used _the Holy Grail_ to become Super Sailor Moon... or at least something _called_ that for a while, then officially named the Cálice.
-   _Science Ninja Team Gatchaman_ has transmutation wristbands. They also tripled as communicators and tracking beacons.
-   _Shugo Chara!_ has the Humpty Lock which Amu uses to fuse whichever Guardian Character's egg she needs for the situation to transform. Ikuto uses the Key that is paired with it. Everyone else just directly transforms with their Guardian Character.
-   Used in the TV adaptation of _Skull Man_. Coupled with Body Horror and Nightmare Fuel.
-   _Spider Riders_: had a wristband like device called a Manacle that was used not just for transformations, but also for keeping their Giant Spiders in Hammerspace.
-   Karin Kokubu from _Super Pig_ uses a pink compact to transform into the pig Justice Buurin. The compact stores a pig's snout which is called by the phrase "BA BI BU BE BOorin!", the compact then opens and the snout comes out and attaches to her face in one of the oddest transformation sequences in anime. It also apparently is a form of communication of a king of a planet of alien pigs.
-   In _Tamagotchi! Yume Kira Dream_, Yumemitchi and Kiraritchi have Yume Kira bags which allow the user to transform into something resembling a particular occupation (e.g. a fisherman, a cheerleader, etc.) and giving them the skills of that occupation.
-   _Tekkaman Blade_ used small crystal "sculptures." After Blade's crystal is shattered, it's installed into a Humongous Mecha.
-   The second season of _Tiger & Bunny_ has a wrist-mounted device that allows Kotetsu and Barnaby to transform into their Hero forms.
-   In _Tokyo Mew Mew_, the girls wear a pendant as decoration for their magical outfits' chokers. They can transform without a trinket in the manga, but in the anime, they carry around their pendants when untransformed and have to kiss the pendant to transform. However, this does not explain how Lettuce and Zakuro were able to transform prior to receiving the pendants. The anime reboot does away with the pendants and has the girls transform at will like in the manga.
-   Fine and Rein of _Twin Princess of Wonder Planet_ each have a Sunny Luce, a compact that allows them to use the power of the Prominence. They can also use it to call on their Sunny Rod without being transformed.
-   _Umi Monogatari_ has the Bermuda Stones, which turn Marin and Kanon into priestesses. Which makes it a bad thing when Sedna destroys them.
-   The main trio of _Urahara_, the anime adaptation of _Park Harajuku Crisis Team_ wield the Amatsura, magic stones fueled by creativity and imagination to activate their henshin forms.
-   The Triggers in _World Trigger_ are necessary to enter a Trion body, which is super powered and also invincible to anything except Trion attacks. The equipment of the body depends on the programming of the Trigger while the raw power depends on the person using it.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ has the Millennium Puzzle that allows the main character to transform into his Super-Powered Alter Ego when in danger.
    -   The Millennium Ring also hosted an ancient Egyptian spirit who could could take control of his descendant's body when wearing it. The third alter ego, Yami Marik completely averts this trend, though the normal Marik was able to go into the Millenium Ring, sharing a body with both Yami and Normal Bakura, but not able to physically manifest himself like the two spirits of the millennium items are.
-   Though Duel Disk is often used for competitive and summoning purpose, those from _Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS_ can be considered as this, although whether he or she would undergo a physical transformation upon entering LINK VRAINS is completely optional. There are two models for this: an old type and a new type, with the former requiring physical cards to activate.
-   The Magical Girls in _Yuki Yuna is a Hero_ don't have actual trinkets. They instead use a special app created by the Taisha to transform using their cellphones.

    Asian Animation

This is contradicted by the issues in which Diana actually did compete as she wore plate armor and a face concealing helmet and didn't need a magical disguise.
    -   Hercules has a magic mirror that allows him to shift to look like other humans or humanoids of similar body mass, and which also changes his clothes. He has infuriated both Wonder Woman and Wonder Girl (Cassie) by trying to deceive them while posing as someone else using it.

    Eastern Animation 

-   In _The New Adventures of Hanuman_, Maruti uses a mace-shaped locket to turn into Hanuman.

    Fan Works 

-   _The Echo Ranger_, as a crossover between _Power Rangers_ and _My Hero Academia_, obviously features these. Izuku gets the Echo Morpher, which despite being based on Tommy's Master Morpher takes the form of a wristwatch as opposed to the original Rangers' belt buckles. Melissa later manages to combine two morphers given to her by Izuku (who'd received it himself from Rita) and Telos into a single working Morpher for her new hybrid Echo Coin.
-   In _Friendship Is Magical Girls_, the girls activate their Mahoushoujo powers by inserting their Element of Harmony gems into silver pins.
-   Inverted in _Hilda and the howling woods._ Werewolves will often wear a bit of silver on their persons to _prevent_ Involuntary Shapeshifting.
-   The _Miraculous Ladybug_ fic _Hop to It_ has seven artificially created Miraculouses, including a wristwatch (belonging to Jack/Rabbit), a pair of dogtags (belonging to Diego/Perro Negro) and a pair of cuff links (originally belonging to Swan Princess, later stolen by Omega and given to the villain who called himself Trumpeter Swan).

    Films — Animation 

-   In _Moana_, Maui has the ability to polymorph into a number of Polynesian-regional animals through the power in his divinely gifted giant whalebone fish hook, which also doubles as an Absurdly Sharp Blade.
-   _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls_: The magical geodes the girls gain in _Legend of Everfree_. Before that, they could transform with pony ears, ponytails and eventually rainbow colors, but they had little control over it and it didn't involve clothes (except with Daydream Shimmer, which was an All Your Powers Combined special case). The geodes give much greater control, allowing them to transform at will, and add a Magical Girl Instant Costume Change. However, this also introduces the Logical Weakness that the transformation reverses instantly if a geode is lost, since it now depends on it, as happens to Sunset Shimmer in "Cheer You On".
-   In _Red Shoes and the Seven Dwarfs_, the titular magic red shoes allows the main female character to glamour her overweight body and give herself the physique of a thin supermodel.
-   The Amulet of Merlin from _Trollhunters_, which automatically adjusts the Trollhunter armor to fit the wearer.
-   In _Turning Red_, this is inverted with the red-panda talismans that Mei's female relatives all wear. The talisman traps the wearer's red panda spirit and prevents her from transforming as long as the talisman is intact. If a talisman is broken, replacing it requires very specific circumstances.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Iron Man 2_, Tony has a suitcase which turns into and equips him with one of his Iron Man armor variations via something that is pretty much a Transformation Sequence.
    -   He gains a much more proper one in _Avengers: Infinity War_ and _Avengers: Endgame_ due to upgrading to nanotech, in the form of the arc reactor on his chest<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . All he needs to do is tap the chest and the armor forms around him in mere seconds, making Tony a full on Henshin Hero at this point. _Endgame_ shows it's really just stuck on top of his chest and is easily removable without much effort or any risk of injury.
    -   Also in _Endgame_, the time-space GPS developed by Tony, once he successfully finds a working model to time travel, and worn around the palm, also serves as the container for the Quantum Suit, also made nanotech like the above armors. Like the arc reactor above, activating and deactivating the suit only requires the device to be tapped. Likewise, tapping the device initiates time travel once the suit is on. Despite promotional artwork, it cannot be used simultaneously with Tony's Mark 85 armor or Scott's now-nanotech Ant-Man suit. In Rhodey's case, however, since his current War Machine armor isn't nanotech like Tony's, the suit is just integrated into his armor as a protective layer.

-   _Never Cry Werewolf_: Jared uses a charm made from the skin of a dead man to transform into a werewolf whenever he wants.
-   In Disney's _The Shaggy Dog_, Wilby Daniels gets hold of an ancient talisman with an ominous Latin inscription that turns him into the titular carpeted canine.
-   Inverted in _Wolf (Mike Nichols)_, the amulet is supposed to _prevent_ Will (Jack Nicholson) from transforming but at the end he discards it and becomes a full wolf.
-   Hank McCoy makes a serum that temporarily reverts him from "blue Beast" to "Nicholas Hoult" in _X-Men: Days of Future Past_. It comes to save him as a Sentinel is about to attack, as the serum not only disguises him but cloaks his X-gene as well.

    Folklore 

-   Tanuki often place a leaf on their forehead to transform.
-   Werebeasts of various mythologies often have this as a rule, putting on or removing animal skins in order to transform. Selkies are probably the most famous nowadays, but werewolves often used pelts or wolf-fur belts in medieval legends.

    Literature 

-   "Bisclavret", a medieval lay by Marie de France, is about a man who turns into a wolf for three days every week, after first hiding his clothes in an abandoned chapel. He literally cannot transform back unless he retrieves them. Oddly, the story doesn't even specify that it's a certain set of clothes, so it might just be whatever outfit that he was wearing before he changed.

-   _Come On Ossie_, a book by the same author as _Flossie_, main character Oswald uses his grandfather's medal to turn into an 18-year-old.
-   _The Dresden Files_: _Fool Moon_ has fur belts that turn FBI agents into rampaging werewolves. Also double as Artifacts Of Doom thanks to the demon that comes attached.
-   _Flossie Teacakes_ has a magical coat that magically transforms her into an 18-year-old.
-   _Interstellar Pig_ by William Sleator features this in the form of the equipment chosen by Barney that allows him to transform into any of the aliens he is battling; he becomes a carnivorous lichen.
-   In _Heralds of Valdemar_, one of the Tarma and Kethry short stories is of them being called to the aid of a mage who thinks she's found a powerful amulet that lets her take the form of a bear and commune with ancient spirits. In actuality, it's junk and Your Mind Makes It Real. In this setting it's not hard to magically turn into an animal, but there's also such an extreme level of The Mind Is a Plaything of the Body that even brief time spent in a form with a brain that can't support a human mind causes a loss of humanity that a mage can "probably" recover - and Mara's been spending a _lot_ of time as a bear, leaving her unable to question an idea that's become a delusion. She rejects Kethry's offer of help and attacks her, only to be shot and killed by Tarma.
-   The young adult novel _The Monster's Ring_ by Bruce Coville is about a ring that turns the wearer into a monster.
-   In the _Rainbow Magic_ series, the 2 heroines of the series have been given lockets containing fairy dust, which turn them into fairies (by making them shrink and grow wings) when opened.
-   In _The Shape Changer_, O'Leary receives a device just called a "Mark III" from his old friend, the semi-retired highwayman Red Bull, which changes his shape to that of a sneak thief called Zorro, and he promptly ends up getting arrested.
-   In the second book of the _Young Wizards_ Series, Kit has to use a whalesark, or the essence of a deceased whale's nervous system, to transform into that whale.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Aikatsu Planet!_ has AiPlaPhone and Idol License for the idols to summon the mirror portal and enter their avatar form in Aikatsu Planet world. How the non-idol characters entered that world is left unexplained, however.
-   _BIMA Satria Garuda_ has the red Power Stone for the hero, while apparently differently colored ones are used by villains.
    -   The sequel season, Bima X, has all of the Power Stones for the Satria Heroes, who succed in recovering them from the villains in the previous season, while the villains used synthetic power stones.
        -   Bima, the main Satria Heroes, uses 4 power stones : Red, Blue, Green, and Purple; One to transform, while the rest is used for mode change.
        -   The red one is used to transform into Bima X's base form, Bima X Flame Mode, which is the upgrade of his base form in the previous season.
        -   The blue one is used to transform Bima into Bima X Storm Mode.
        -   The green one is used to transform Bima into Earth Mode.
        -   The purple one is used to transform Bima into Magnet Mode.
        -   Azazel, the black Satria Heroes, uses the black Power Stone to transform into his base form.
        -   This season also introduce a new Satria Heroes called Satria Harimau Torga, who uses 2 power stones, which are the orange and white, to transform into his base form and his Ice mode respectively.
        -   Aside from Torga, there is also an evil Satria Heroes called Dark Torga who sides with the villains. He is actually Topeng Besi, a general in the villain army in the previous season, and uses a synthetic power stone to transform.
-   In season 3 of _Black Lightning (2018)_, Agent Odell gives Jefferson a watch that generates a new suit for him with eerily familiar visuals when he applies a 5-volt jolt to it.
-   In _The Flash (2014)_, Eobard Thawne possesses a ring that contains his supersuit. By activating his ring, his suit is ejected from it and he uses his speed to change into it. In season 5, Barry received a ring of his own from his future daughter Nora.
-   The Makai Knights of _GARO_ transform by using their weapons to draw circles in the air.
-   _Kamen Rider_: for nearly all Riders, a belt. In the Heisei era, it quickly became standard to have a secondary collectible item such as cards, keys, stamps, or watches which often serves as the actual source of the power, but needs to be inserted into the belt to access that power. Exceptions still abound:
    -   Amazon lampshades and subverts this. Amazon is always wearing a giant, rather goofy-looking belt buckle, but it's NOT his transformation trinket (his armlet is).
    -   Averted with the deconstruction movie _Shin Kamen Rider: Prologue_; let's just say that its protagonist is closer to (a gorier version of) The Incredible Hulk than a Kamen Rider...
    -   Kuuga's belt is effectively a one-time item; after his first transformation, it merged with his body (and even appears on X-rays!), emerging only when he needs it.
    -   _Kamen Rider Agito_'s G3 had none. He was _all_ tech, and had to physically don his battle suit (with a bit of automated finishing-up as parts lock into place; think Iron Man, suitcase version.)
    -   The Riders in _Kamen Rider Hibiki_, which has a musical theme, use appropriate handheld devices: percussion-type Oni like Hibiki use tuning forks, wind instrument types like Ibuki use flutes, and stringed instrument types like Todoroki use an stringed arm brace. In this case, their belt buckles contain devices that turn their weapons into their signature instruments for Finishing Moves (for example, Ibuki's buckle turns his gun into a trumpet by forming the bell).
    -   _Kamen Rider Double_ uses the regular sort of belt + widget combination, but there's actually _two_ belts, one for each member of the Fusion Dance. The one that Philip wears only gets used to teleport his selected Gaia Memory over to Shotaro's belt alongside Philip's soul, causing his body to pass out. The Fang Memory can flip this around and use Philip as the host body, while the Xtreme Memory teleports Philip's entire body along with it to make a complete fusion.
    -   _Kamen Rider OOO_ doesn't use the belt _buckle_ as the important part of the transformation; instead it's just a holster for his chosen Core Medals, and the actual device that does the transforming is a scanner that he pulls off the side of the belt. As the Rule of Three is a recurring motif, this isn't accidental.
    -   _Kamen Rider Wizard_ has the WizarDriver belt, which unlike most belts is actually worn full-time: most of the time it's in a scaled-back form, having maybe a little larger belt buckle than can be found in real life but it's not too outrageous. Even in this form it can activate most of Wizard's Rings of Power, as all he has to do is hold his ringed hand in front of it. When it's time to fight, _then_ he can turn the thing to the full version that can activate his transformation rings as well. Which of them is the source of his power? Actually, it's the Phantom monster inside him, whose powers he can draw because he was badass enough to resist the "drive you to despair and burst out of you" process.
    -   _Kamen Rider Drive_ has an unusual belt in two ways: not only is the Drive Driver a Robot Buddy containing the mind of Drive's inventor, but the belt itself can't do anything without both the arm-worn Shift Brace to hold and activate a Shift Car, _and_ Drive's Cool Car the Tridoron being nearby to actually send the powers.
    -   _Kamen Rider Amazons_: The Amazons are bio-organic weapons, and so their transformation is a biologically innate process. What the belt does is enhance their monster body.
    -   _Kamen Rider Zero-One_ is notable not for the belt structure, but for the sheer number of belts. By the final episode there are **eleven** different kinds of transformation belts in play, although all except one use the same system of inserting Progrise Keys into the buckle.
    -   _Kamen Rider Saber_: for almost every Rider, it's their holy sword that's the source of their powers and the object that interacts with the magical storybooks they use to access specific forms. The belt only serves as a holster for the sword, the books, or sometimes is purely for decoration. Only Solomon and Storious use the belt itself as the transformation item, highlighting that they aren't swordsmen and got their powers by other means.
    -   _Kamen Rider Revice_: The Revice Driver serves as both a trinket for Revi, who gets to wear it, and Vice, who doesn't, highlighting that Ikki is the Kid with the Leash. It's not until near the very end of the show that Vice finally gets his own copy of the Driver that he can use without having to get Ikki's permission every time he wants to transform.
    -   _Kamen Rider Geats_: While the belt is used to transform as per usual, it has three, sometimes four components to it. The belt itself is used to transform but is generic for all the "player" Riders, the ID Core in the middle is unique to each Rider and is used to signify they've entered into the game and touching it gets them their memories of the game back after each "reset", and the Buckles are used to give power-ups and two can be be used at one time.
    -   Subverted in _Kamen Rider: The First_ and _The Next_, remakes of the original series and _Kamen Rider V3_ respectively. The "Hoppers" have their traditional Typhoon belts, but no actual transformation is involved - instead, they simply change into their costumes by removing the civilian clothing worn over them and donning their helmets. Sometimes it's even hard to tell when transformation _takes place,_ as we cut from an un-suited Rider spinning the Typhoon's wheel to the suited Rider donning the helmet, with no 'ceremony' whatsoever. The _entire suit_ is like the IXA belt: just in place as needed, no attention called to it, when did that get there?
    -   Interestingly, in some of the older series, posing and saying "henshin" causes the belt to appear in place and activate, without existing beforehand or actually being interacted with in any way. Sometimes it doesn't even appear to activate transformation - it just appears before the rest of the suit out of habit.
-   _Madan Senki Ryukendo_ is another case of the weapon itself being the transformation item.
-   _Merlin_ had two villains with these in the episode "Gwaine". They used them to take the identities of knights they killed. They were crystals of some type, activated with a bit of the victim's blood.
-   On _The Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nóg_, the Mystic Weapons are also the transformation trinkets.
-   _Once Upon a Time_:
    -   Similar to the _Wolf_ one above; Red Riding Hood's signature red cape is what keeps her genetic werewolf form condition at bay every full moon. She often forgoes it when she needs to transform as a distraction, however.
    -   Regina gives mermaid Ariel a bracelet that allows her to assume human form, but with an Equivalent Exchange element that forces another person to become a mermaid. Later, after Regina's Heel–Face Turn, she alters the bracelet so that Ariel can assume both human and mermaid forms whenever she desires, without any negative impacts.
-   _Power Rangers_ and _Super Sentai_ have gone through various Transformation Trinkets over the years. Wrist-worn devices are the most common, though cell phone morphers are being seen more often lately, but there are exceptions. The glove-style GekiChangers in _Gekiranger_ and the sunglasses\-styled Solar Morphers in _Jungle Fury_, for example. The Dino Buckler is the most iconic, being the item used in _Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger_ and its western counterpart, _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_.
    -   The phone morphers make sense for Merchandise-Driven reasons: the toys can make a variety of sounds or quotes play with different button combinations, whereas there's only so many ways to hold out your belt buckle and yell "It's morphin' time." However, it became pretty nonsensical in-universe because of how poorly they often fit the theme. It's one thing for a high-tech team, but Gaoranger (Wild Force) is a nature-themed series where the Rangers live on a flying island with their hippie-looking mentoress, which are the remnants of an ancient kingdom. No attempt was ever made to explain why the morphers were phones, devices not invented for _centuries_ after the Animarium left the surface! Magiranger (Mystic Force) wields the powers granted by the powerful magic-users of a magical dimension, so naturally... they get cell phones. (Mystic Force had them start out as Harry Potter-esque wands The Mentor disguised as phones for the whole Secret Identity thing, though.) The newest descendants of a samurai bloodline? Cellphones, of course! Space pirates? Cellphones, what else? However, sentai would get over its obsession with phones with _Gokaiger,_ as the last full team with phone morphers was them, at least until Zyuohger with their Zyuoh Changers.
    -   Then there's the _Power Rangers S.P.D._ A-Squad. Their _unmorphed uniforms_ are their morphers, apparently: Without any device being hauled out, Ranger-colorcoded energy flows from the colored portions of their unmorphed uniforms to become the Ranger suits.
    -   A bit of Early-Installment Weirdness: We actually don't see change devices until the fourth series. In _Himitsu Sentai Gorenger,_ the unmorphed Ranger jumps and yells "Go!" and a Repeat Cut has them fly through the air again, but now suited (meaning we also don't get the first Transformation Sequence in season one, either.) In _J.A.K.Q. Dengekitai,_ the heroes must enter "strengthening capsules", little booths that suit them up. There's a set on the base and a set on their plane. In _Battle Fever J_ the heroes say "Fever!" and turn around once, though the first time, they actually had to physically put on the suits. (This was most likely an artifact of the show's original intentions of being a Japanese adaptation of Captain America.)
    -   _Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger_ follows in the tradition of _Kamen Rider Double_ and _Kamen Rider OOO_ in that the cell phone morphers (the Mobirates) are just holders for the _real_ transformation trinkets, the Ranger Keys: the dispersed essences of every single previous Ranger, materialized in the form of individual Yale keys. Indeed, when past Rangers gets their hands on their respective key, the reabsorbing of its power reverts it back into their own morpher.
        -   _Power Rangers Turbo_ also had the keys be the real power source: the keys were put in a number of devices, and got all glowy to make other things happen (in the manner of several mystical power sources that reserve the right to occasionally do more than what they're normally used for.) However, it's easy to forget because they do this much less after The Movie.
    -   Before them, _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_' Power Coins did way more than morph the Rangers (which, under special circumstances, they could do without the morphers.)
    -   In _Power Rangers RPM,_ it's Engine Cells. A variety of them are placed in a variety of things, including the morphers (cell phones for the primary colors, wrist-worn for Green and Black, weapons for Gold and Silver) and the Zords (to make them grow, because they're pocket-sized by default). However, they're much less of a plot point unto themselves than Ranger Keys or Turbo Keys, let alone Power Coins or Core Medals.
    -   In _Engine Sentai Go-onger_, which is a more lighthearted series, the Engine _Souls_ are more plot points. An Engine is an alien Robot Buddy that can only operate for so long at its proper Humongous Mecha size under Earth's conditions, and after a time will revert to Sleep-Mode Size, which takes the form of an Engine Cast (the toy-sized body) and an Engine Soul (_exactly_ what the name implies.) When an Engine Soul is placed in a weapon, that allows the Engine to operate it from within. When placed in the morpher, the morpher creates a little cartoony hologram of the Engine. The Change Souls that power the morphers for transformation, however, aren't the soul of anything, and only do that.
    -   _Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger_/_Power Rangers Dino Charge_, being a dinosaur series, decides that the most logical choice for the transformation trinkets is... a large gun in which a battery is inserted. The guns, however, are more like the aforementioned belts belonging to Kamen Riders Double, OOO, and Wizard; the batteries, charged up with the user's bravery (_Kyoryuger_)/Energem charges (_Dino Charge_), are what cause the transformation. The exceptions are the Sixth Ranger, who uses a large wrist-worn crossbow-like device, and the first two _Kyoryuger_ Guest Star Party Members, who are already dead and now manifest as spirits that can channel their bravery directly into their batteries. No gun morphers for them because _they became Rangers before guns ever existed!_
    -   _Ressha Sentai ToQger_ returns to the wrist devices for the main five. However, they're two-piece: a model of each Ranger's personal train car mecha is inserted into the ToQ Changer. Yes, they are interchangeable. Each train comes with a model to be used in the Changer to summon it, or in some cases use its power at small size. They're similar to the Beast Batteries of _Kyoryuger_.
    -   _Shuriken Sentai Ninninger_ goes back to the logic of Kyoryuger's weapon-based trinkets, this time using large swords and transformation shuriken for the ninja theme.
        -   The Sixth Ranger's got it worse: His is based on a _cheeseburger phone_, with his golden Shuriken being the _cheese_.
    -   _Doubutsu Sentai Zyuohger_ goes back to the cell phone changers with their Zyuoh Changers, which are giant Rubix Cube-like blocks which flip open to reveal phones. They then press a number which shouts out the name of their respective animal before closing it and turning the top of the Zyuoh Changer 3 times (With the animal photo facing front).
        -   The Sixth Ranger's is a flashlight with a cube shoved in between the light and the handle, and it transforms him by turning the cube to the Rhino photo, slapping it on his knee, and then moving it like the other Zyuohgers do with their Zyuoh Changers
        -   Both the Sixth and Red rangers can actually change their ranger form by switching the masks on their helmets.
        -   Zyuoh Eagle later gets a giant cube that turns into a cannon which give him a new powered-up form called Zyuoh Whale.
    -   _Uchu Sentai Kyuranger_ decides to combine both wrist-devices and Kyoryuger's system into one with their Seiza Blaster, a gauntlet-like transformation device which doubles as a blaster similar to Kyoryu Gold's changer, and Kyutamas, which function like the Zyudenchi.
        -   Xiao has a cane with a dragon head which opens up to reveal the Kyutama slot. He then closes the mouth on the Kyutama before slamming the cane bottom on the ground. Sixth Ranger Houou Soldier has a sword and shield which both function as his changer, by inserting the Kyutama into the sword (which is sheathed in the shield) before pulling it out, which triggers the transformation.
    -   _Kaitou Sentai Lupinranger VS Keisatsu Sentai Patranger_ continues with the weapon morphers with the VS Changers, which function by inserting the ranger's shrunken personal mecha, known as Dial Fighters and Trigger Machines) onto the changer (the Lupinrangers have to turn the dial on theirs) before twisting them around to a certain side (Patrangers twist them to the bottom side, Lupinrangers twist the morpher to the top side) and firing the blaster. It can also summon weapons from other Dial Fighters and Trigger Machines by repeating the process.
        -   The Sixth Ranger's works a little differently, as it only consists of the blaster (which also acts as his shrunken personal mecha, being trains), and functions by turning the top twice before firing. The form he takes depends on what color was facing the direction of the barrel (Lupin X = Silver train, Patren X = Gold train).
    -   _Kishiryu Sentai Ryusoulger_/_Power Rangers Dino Fury_ goes back to the traditional wrist-worn morpher, using the powers of the Ryusouls/Dino Fury Keys, dinosaur heads that unfold into miniature knights with different functions, though aside from transformation they are mostly activated through the swords instead. The sixth ranger uses the same system but with a gun instead.
    -   _Mashin Sentai Kiramager_ has the entire team use wrist-worn devices, the main team uses the smartwatch-like Kiramai Changer, while the sixth ranger uses the older analogue prototype Shiny Kiramai Changer.
    -   _Kikai Sentai Zenkaiger_, being a Milestone Celebration series, has the main team use the gatling gun Geartlinger, along with the Sentai Gears, gears that allows its users to replicate abilities or weapons used by previous teams. However this technology is noted to be easily replicable itself, allowing the villains to create the Evil Knockoff Geartozinger, which their own evil warrior uses to transform and summon controlled copies of past teams.
        -   The sixth ranger also stole and replicated this tech to make his own trinket, the Geardalinger, a hybrid gun-sword-tambourine named for the giant pirate ship steering wheel on its side, which he uses for transformation and to use the abilities of other extra rangers.
-   In the _Stargate SG-1_ episode "Foothold", the aliens use a device to appear as members of the SGC. Later in the episode, Sam Carter gets ahold of one of these devices and uses it to turn into her teammate Daniel Jackson.
-   In season 5 of _Supergirl (2015)_, Brainy makes Kara a new nanotech suit (with pants this time) that is activated by her whipping off her glasses in a specific way.
-   In _Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad,_ the procedure was more involved than most cases: Sam had to bring up the Servo program on his computer, and then play a certain chord on his guitar. The process was automated in a wrist-worn device, so he _can_ just push a button if he wants, but only seems to do this when he can't do the normal procedure from home.
    -   For the others, each says a code and does a pose. For Tanker, he tends to clap his drumsticks together, giving a jolt of electricity nobody but the viewer seems to see, when saying his phrase. This seems to be Rule of Cool or Rule of Funny, because there is really _no_ reason a totally-non-electronic pair of wooden drumsticks would (or could) have anything to do with the program.
    -   The Japanese source for the series, _Denkou Choujin Gridman_, the device Sam wore was the Axceptor and his counterpart Naoto would bond with Gridman by having the program boot up on Junk and striking the button on the Axceptor, crying out "ACCESS FLASH!" This would be the same over in _SSSS.GRIDMAN_
-   _Tomica Hero Rescue Fire_ combines this with Calling Your Attacks the device in this case is a _megaphone_ they have to yell _"Chakusou!"_ into. Fire-4 and Fire-5 use their weapons (swords with microphpones in the hilt) to transform.
    -   Subverted in _Tomica Hero Rescue Force_, its predecessor. While they indeed use a device to transform (specifically, the Nintendo DS-shaped Rescue Commander and an activation card), they have to enter transformation tubes similar to the aforementioned JAKQ, which gives them their suits. The exception is the movie-exclusive R0, whose suit comes from his vehicle.
-   The _Ultra Series_ typically has the human host or form of each title character use a different activator device (given to them by the Ultra if host and self-made if form) to initiate the change. Usually, it's a small handheld wand-thing. For example in the original _Ultraman_, it was the Beta Capsule.
    -   Interestingly despite the Beta Capsule being the Trope Codifier for the Transformation Trinket, the series often shows it as a major Achilles' Heel for Hayata. Either being stolen or being knocked away in an intense moment.
    -   Interestingly, some hosts and human forms don't require a transformation item to change form; Ultraman Jack is the first example, as Hideki Goh transformed into Jack simply through his willpower, and should Jack or Goh be hesitant to fight, the transformation process might be slower or even cancel out altogether.
    -   Ultras have been shown to be able to forbid their host from transforming at times, usually if they want to make a point to the humans or refuse to face the Monster of the Week for whatever reasons. For example, with Jack above, he once refused to let Goh transform when he learned the monster he would battle was a resurrected Zetton.
    -   _Ultraman Leo_ brings an interesting idea to the table when Ultraseven is crippled and forced to remain in his human form Dan Moroboshi, as after the battered and wounded Seven assumes his human form, his Ultra Eye is damaged beyond repair, leaving him stuck as Dan for the remainder of the series. Jack actually shows up later on to take the Ultra Eye to M78 for repairs, and All There in the Manual material says Seven finally got it back, along with his his usual form, after returning to M78.
    -   There have also been variations:
        -   Ultraman Ace had two hosts, Seiji Hokuto and Yuuko Minami, who transformed putting their Ultra Rings together.
        -   Ultraman Gaia's host Gamu Takayama actually had to make his Esplender himself (also implied for Agul and Hiroya Fujimiya) to contain Gaia's light.
        -   Ultraman Mebius' Mebium Brace was attached to his left arm rather than a separate item, since he took a human form instead of having a host.
    -   _Ultraman Ginga_ took an interesting spin on the idea. The transformation trinket is an item called a Spark Doll, which resembles a toy version of an Ultraman or a monster, and using the Spark Doll with a device called a Spark lets one transform into the being, since Spark Dolls are literally the heroes and villains of the franchise turned into toys by the Big Bad.
        -   Spark Dolls also appear in _Ultraman X_, but only the Ultraman X Spark Doll is capable of transforming while it's treated as a pseudo-stasis form for the monsters. However, monsters could be converted into a Cyber Card by Xio that could either summon a cybernetic version of them as allies or create a unique cooperation-based armour for Ultraman X based on their abilities.
    -   In _Ultraman Orb_, Gai Kurenai uses cards of Ultramen that he combines in pairs to give himself various forms with their own sets of powers. Big Bad Jugglus Juggler also owned cards, but of monsters, which he naturally uses to summon opponents for Orb. Both characters relied on a ring-like device to awaken the card's power.
        -   _Ultraman Geed_ followed a similar trend with the Ultra and Monster Capsules, with the latter being used to create Hybrid Monster opponents for Geed.
        -   _Ultraman Z_ follows the example of _Geed_ and has the titular Z employ a special device called the Z-Riser, after himself since he was the test subject along with Ultra Medals which work similarly to the Capsules of _Geed_.
        -   _Ultraman Trigger: New Generation Tiga_ has the GUTS Sparklens, which is a combination of Tiga's Sparklens and GUTS Hyper Gun, however only Kengo (the main protagonist and Trigger's host) can actually use the Sparklens form of his weapon, since that one was made specifically for the purpose of hosting Trigger's power.

    Podcasts 

-   The _Sequinox_ team has the phone charms that they received from Tellie as one part. It lets the girls' phones access the magical app through which they can transform. Vivaldi has a charm that works the same as well.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Princess: The Hopeful:_ Each Princess has a Phylactery, a physical item which symbolizes her title as one of the Hopeful and which she must activate, open, touch, or otherwise interact with in order to assume her Transformed state. Fortunately, if a Princess's Phylactery is lost or destroyed she can summon or recreate it with a little concentration.

    Video Games 

-   In _Amagon_, Amagon only becomes able to transform into Megagon once the Mega-key is found.
-   The bosses you fight in _Azure Striker Gunvolt_ games use transformation trinkets to access their battle forms. The trinkets differ depending on the games: The trinket in the first game looks like a sword (thus the bosses are collectivelly called the Swordsmen), in the second game it's a book (due to its Fairy Tale Motif), and in _Luminous Avenger iX_ it's a shirt pin shaped like a feather (thus the bosses are called Winged Warriors, or Falcons). In addition, the trinkets in the first two games are also explicitly stated as Power Limiter, as the adepts cannot use the full extent of their powers without activating the trinkets.
-   _Cassette Beasts_ features tape recorders that are capable of playing back the recorded cassette of a monster, allowing the listener to take on its form, most commonly for the purpose of battling other monsters on an even playing field.
-   In _Elona+_, Shift Cores are extremely rare items (you can only obtain one by wishing for it) that temporarily change your appearance on top of granting a major boost to some stats, but you need to have a full gauge to use them.
-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   The Manaketes in the series generally require an item called a dragonstone to transform into their true forms. As dragons, they tend to have little trouble destroying the opposition, but once the stone runs out of uses and breaks, they're helpless unless you can somehow manage to find a new one. Story wise, Bantu, Fa, and Myrrh all get their stones stolen from them; the former simply requesting that you catch the thief responsible so he can help you (This happens on two occasions in two different games, no less), and the latter two needing to be rescued from the enemy.
    -   Remedied in _Fire Emblem: Awakening_, where dragonstones are apparently common enough to be purchased from shops, despite the fact that manaketes have become a race of the legends. The same game introduces the Taguel race, who require beaststones to transform (Which likewise, can be purchased from shops). Both races can simply opt to rely on the strength of their human forms by taking up a normal class, as well.
    -   While not a Manakete, the Avatar in _Fire Emblem Fates_, along with any of their potential children, can also use a Dragonstone to transform. In their case, it's needed to retain their sanity and avoid going on a rampage like when their power first awakened. Beaststones also make a return, being used by kitsune and wolfskin races to transform.
-   _Kingdom Hearts_:
    -   The series outright states that Sora's newer, black clothes in _Kingdom Hearts II_ are the Transformation Trinket for his Drive-Forms and the only thing that actually changes when he "drives" in most worlds. It is also implied during the visit to the Pride Lands that these clothes also chance Sora's appearance in Fisher Kingdom worlds.
        -   For the same game's manga adaptation, it is implied that Riku's blindfold serves as one, as when he takes it off, he's already wearing his new clothing. The game had him remove his Black Cloak manually upon joining the party.
    -   In _Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep_ the pieces of armor that Terra, Aqua and Ven wear in their traveling clothes are used to activate the transformation into their full armor.
-   _Kirby_:
    -   In addition to the usual Power Copying, some games have Copy Essences lying around that grant an ability when touched. In _Milky Way Wishes,_ this is the only way to use special abilities (they're permanent and can be switched at will though).
    -   Later games give Kirby a souped-up special ability, usually in the form of a wand or sword. The item bounces around the screen in place of an Ability Star when you let go of it, implying that it's the source of the ability instead of Kirby's copying power.
-   In _The Legend of Dragoon_, the main cast members possess colored crystal orbs called Dragoon Spirits that allow them to change into winged, armored warriors, complete with Transformation Sequence.
-   The 3-D _The Legend of Zelda_ games are known for these.
    -   Inverted in _Link to the Past_. Attempting to visit the Dark World without a Moon Pearl will turn Link into a helpless rabbit-man. This happens when Link is briefly transported to the Dark World version of Death Mountain. He cannot use items or defend himself in this form, so he's unable to trek outside the mountain as of yet. Luckily, once he has the Pearl, he can travel wherever he pleases.
    -   In _The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask_, several masks are used to transform Link into other races, and the Fierce Deity Mask transforms him into... guess what.
    -   In _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_, Zant curses Link into permanent Wolf form using a shadow crystal. After the curse is broken, Midna is able to use it to transform Link at any given time. Also, the first set of Plot Coupons essentially act like this for Midna.
-   _Mega Man_:
    -   The biometals in _Mega Man ZX_ and Geo's Transer/Star Carrier (With Omega-xis) in _Mega Man Star Force_. Most morphing adversaries in _Star Force 2_ use Ancient Star Carriers, which are exactly the same only built directly with Murian technology.
    -   The anime version of _Mega Man Battle Network_ had Synchro Chips combined with the already existing PETs. The transformation only works in areas that has enabled Net Navis to manifest in the real world.
-   In _Muppet Monster Adventure_ , the main character Robin the Frog can channel the powers of the monsters that his uncle Kermit and his friends have been transformed into with the help of special amulets. The Werebear amulet turns him into a werebear with the power to climb any climbable surface, the Muck Monster one turns him into a swamp creature with the power to swim underwater, the Nose-feratu one gives him flight and turns him into a bat, the KerMonster one turns him into a frankenstein-like creature with super strength, and the Bride of KerMonster one turns him into a Bride Of Frankenstein-like character with a superpowerful karate chop that can smash down doors.
-   The sequel for _NiGHTS into Dreams…_ features persona masks that transform the Nightmaren in a Dolphin, Rocket and finally a Dragon.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   _Pokémon Platinum_ has two items for the purposes of transforming two Pokémon between their alternate forms. The Griseous Orb allows Giratina take on its Origin Forme in the real world, and the Gracidea flower allows Shaymin to take on its Sky Forme. For the latter though, the transformation does not work at night and it can be canceled by Shaymin getting frozen.
    -   _Pokémon X and Y_ introduces "Mega Evolutions", which allow a small selection of Pokémon to take on their Super Mode forms during battle. The Transformation Trinket required to make it work comes in two parts: a Mega Stone to be held by the Pokémon, with every Pokémon that is able to Mega Evolve needing a specific stone, and a Key Stone to be held by the trainer (usually in the form of an accessory such as a ring or bracelet), which is used to actually trigger the evolution.
    -   Other items that trigger some specific Pokémon's forme changes include: the Red and Blue Orbs (triggers Primal Reversion on Kyogre and Groudon, in the Gen III remakes at least), the DNA Splicers (allowing Kyurem to merge with either Reshiram or Zekrom to become White Kyurem and Black Kyurem, respectively), the Reveal Glass (Tornadus, Thundurus and Landorus into their Therian Formes) the Prison Bottle (Hoopa Confined into Hoopa Unbound), and Ultranecrozium Z (Dawn Wings/Dusk Mane Necrozma into Ultra Necrozma). The Zygarde Cube, aside from storing Zygarde Cells and Cores, technically functions as another one, since the player can use the Cube to switch a Zygarde (with all 100 of its pieces) between its 10% and 50% Formes.
-   _Silent Hill 3_ has the Princess Heart Transform Costume, which is activated by a key-shaped trinket.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_:
    -   _Sonic the Hedgehog_, once you collected the required Green Rocks. The most famous being the seven Chaos Emeralds to become Super, on in Blaze's case, the seven Sol Emeralds.
    -   The _Sonic Storybook Series_ also bring us two new forms thanks to the seven World Rings, and four Sacred Swords.
    -   _Sonic Colors_ (and the _Sonic Colors_ stages of _Sonic Generations_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ) had them in the form of the Wisps, small aliens who would allow Sonic to change into different forms for a brief period of time.
-   Seems like in every _Super Mario Bros._ game, there's a new item that gives Mario and Luigi a new form in addition to new abilities:
    -   In _Super Mario Bros._, it began with the famous Super Mushroom (doubles Mario's size and grants an extra Hit Point), the Fire Flower (shoot fireballs) and Super Star (invincibility).
    -   _Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels_ (the Japanese sequel) introduced the infamous Poison Mushroom, which inflicted damage instead of powering up Mario.
    -   _Super Mario Bros. 3_ introduced the Super Leaf that turned Mario into Raccoon Mario (raccoon ears and a tail, limited flying/gliding abilities). Later in the game there's the Frog Suit (precision swimming), Tanooki Suit (Raccoon abilities plus transformation into a Tanooki statue that can crush virtually any enemy), and even the rare Hammer Suit (throw incredibly lethal hammers, the shell itself is impervious to fireballs). The GBA version of this added a "Feather" granting _Cape Mario_, like in _Super Mario World_.
    -   _Super Mario World_ retained the original three powerups, replacing the Leaf with the Feather for Cape Mario. A rare balloon powerup inflates Mario, allowing him to float in the air for a limited time.
    -   _Super Mario Land_ was like a handheld _expy_ of the NES classic, with the orignal power ups, only the Fire Flower is replace by a flower that turns Mario to Superball Mario.
    -   _Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins_ continues the tradition with the original three power-ups and a new flying ability, this time a carrot that gives Mario bunny ears that make him fly for a bit. Also, because of the graphics for the black-white gameboy, Fire Mario had a feather on his head here. Also during the final battle with Wario, the villain goes through the three power ups (no star) in the fight.
    -   _Super Mario 64_: Ditch all the powerups for three hats: The blue cap make Mario invisible (and thus, invulnerable) and able to pass through certain walls; the Metal Cap turns Mario into an invincible heap of walking metal (complete with a remix of the Super Star music), and the red Wing Cap allows limited flight. _Super Mario 64 DS_ however made invisibility exclusive to Luigi, metal exclusive to Wario, Yoshi gets to spit fireballs, and Mario can blow-up like in _Super Mario World_ or gets a feather and become Wing Mario.
    -   _Super Mario Sunshine_ didn't have Mario change forms, but his talking-weapon of choice, FLUDD can switch modes with the right power up, to have Mario hover, jet up in the sky or to run with Super-Speed.
    -   _New Super Mario Bros._ retains the Super Mushroom and the Fire Flower. There was also a temporary transformation with a Mega Mushroom, turning the user (even a boss used one!) into a giant unstoppable machine! There's also a new power-up, a blue shell that turns Mario or Luigi into Shell Mario (slide along the ground just like a turtle shell, knocking out everything in your path). There's also the Tiny Mushroom, turning Mario into a _tiny_ One-Hit-Point Wonder that can float through the air, fit into incredibly small pipes, and and run across water.
    -   There are seven forms this time in _Super Mario Galaxy_ (it even brought the Fire Flower to 3-D, if only temporarily). There's also an opposite called the Ice Flower that grants Ice Powers. The _Super Star_ was replaced by a Rainbow Star wih an added speed boost, and this game has two flying abilities: a Red Star (exclusive to the Hub Level, sorry) turns Mario into Flying Mario, and a Bee Mushroom that gives him the hovering Bee Suit. There's even a Boo Mushroom that turns him into, (yep, you guessed it) Boo Mario who can float in the air and pass through certain walls. And finally there's the Spring Mushroom which turns Mario into Spring Mario and grants him super-jumps.
    -   _New Super Mario Bros. Wii_ has an Ice Flower which grants different ice powers from the _Galaxy_ version, a Propellor Mushroom for the new flying form (a jumpsuit with a propellor on the top), and a Penguin Suit (ice powers, slide into enemies, _and_ improved swimming). There's also the Mini Mushroom from the DS version and the usual Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Super Star.
    -   _Super Mario Galaxy 2_ continues the tradition, bringing over almost all of the powerups from the first game, and introducing some new powerups: the Drill, which lets Mario burrow through dirt, the Cloud Flower, which allows Mario to create his own cloud platforms, and the Rock Mushroom, which turns Mario into a rolling rock to plow through enemies and smash into things. Yoshi also has his own powerups: a Dash Pepper that makes him run really fast for a time, a Blimp Fruit which allows Yoshi to float into the air for some time, and a Bulb Berry that lets Yoshi unveil hidden platforms (similar to the Matter Splatter levels of the first game, only Yoshi provides his own spotlight).
    -   _Super Mario 3D Land_ saw the return of Tanooki Mario minus the flight and statue capabilities (in the normal world version anyway), the power-up based hit point system (thankfully Mario's default form is super this time) and the first ever appearance of an unlimited fire flower in a 3D Mario game. It also introduced the boomerang flower, which allows Mario to throw boomerangs.
    -   _New Super Mario Bros. 2_ also brings back the Super Leaf from _Super Mario Bros. 3_, this time granting the flight capabilities(and the return of the P-meter). There's even a Invincibility Leaf that turns Mario into the near invincible White Raccoon Mario if the player loses 5 lives in one world.
        -   Speaking of new, the Gold Flower is introduced in this game, granting Mario and Luigi a more powerful fireball attack that creates shockwaves and can take out many enemies, giving the player more coins. This power lasts till you complete the level or get hit (demoting you to Fire Mario/Luigi in both cases).
    -   _New Super Mario Bros. U_ sees the return of the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, Ice Flower, Mini Mushroom, Propeller Mushroom, and Penguin Suit. It also sees the introduction of the Super Acorn (which turns the recipient into a Flying Squirrel form, effectively a modified Raccoon Suit that looks like a circus costume) and the P-Acorn (which turns the recipient into P-<recipient>, a powered-up Flying Squirrel form capable of infinite flight).
        -   The _Nintendo Switch_ port Deluxe has the Magical Girl\-themed Super Crown meant only for Toadette...that didn't stop a lot of men.
    -   _Super Mario 3D World_ sees the return of the _3D Land_\-style Tanooki form. It also is shown to feature a Cat Bell that gives the recipient a Cat Suit (no, not that kind) that allows them to run up walls and tackle enemies, among other things. And the final battle shows Bowser deciding to use a Cat Bell power-up of his own to fight the player on equal footing.
    -   _Super Mario Maker_ introduces three new transformation items exclusive to the _Super Mario Bros._ game style. The Weird Mushroom turns Mario tall and thin, enabling him to jump slightly higher. Meanhwile, the Big Mushroom increases Mario's mass in addition to his size, enabling him to break more kinds of destructable blocks. Finally, the Mystery Mushroom changes his appearance to a random character or object, but otherwise functions similarly to the Super Mushroom (minus the size increase).
    -   _Princess Peach: Showtime!_ has the ribbon the Sparkle Theater's guardian Stella creates to secure Peach's hair into a ponytail which allows her to attack enemies in her regular outfit and transform into different roles in accordance to the various plays Peach journeys through.
-   _Viewtiful Joe_ has the V-Watches. Henshin a go-go, baby!

    Visual Novels

-   The Crystal Warriors of _Magical Warrior Diamond Heart_ use smartphones called Miracle Links (whic are created from their conviction to fight against the Nightmare Agents) to change into their magical forms. They become wristwatches when transfformed.
-   The accessories in _Princess Debut_ let your main character don one of 20 different ballroom-ready costumes.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Agents of the Realm_, each Agent has an amulet made from part of the Provenance which enables transformation into Frills of Justice.
-   _Alice and the Nightmare_: Rougina's horns used to be this, enabling her shapeshifting, but she lost them before the start of the story, and the ability with them.
-   Apricot from _Apricot Cookie(s)!_ has a skull necklace that triggers her transformation.
-   Myan's collar in _Cat Nine_ allows her to transform into a cat girl or various animals. Removing it turns her back to normal and removes other powers (like human speech) in the process.
-   _Dame Daffodil_ has the flower jewels which enable its' five main characters to become magical heroes.
-   _Darkbolt_ has the Demon Orbs which transforms the 'soul merged' humans into their demon armors. In one case the Phoenix Samurai changes due to an angel.

-   In _Kakikomi Magical Girls_, magical stationary items from Anshin Design Lab act as trinkets for Magical Girls. They turn into weapons as well.
-   Mages in _Leif & Thorn_ use brooches, apparently all brightly-colored crystals in metallic settings.
-   _Magical 12th Graders_: The pin, a magical artifact that can transform anyone into a magical girl (including boys, though their outfits are suitably masculine). The cubics, little pieces of the pin that broke off, can be used for the same purpose, though they're less powerful.
-   Each member of the _Panthera_ team has an amulet on a necklace "that contain\[s\] minerals that ease the transformation and help focus \[their\] elemental power" \[1\].
-   In _Sluggy Freelance_, Zoë's transformations into a camel are tied to a necklace given to her by Torg. She _wishes_ she could conveniently lose the necklace somewhere, but after her first transformation it changed into a seemingly unremovable tattoo. Zoë doesn't mind the tattoo itself too much, but desperately wants to get rid of it so her friends can't turn her into a camel whenever they're feeling mischievous.
-   Yuuki in _Sparkling Generation Valkyrie Yuuki_ (a parody of Magical Girl shows) transforms by use of a brooch. The brooch turns its user into a magical girl (technically, a Valkyrie) which is unfortunate for Yuuki, who was originally a guy.
    -   It's not so much a brooch as a magical jewel _embedded in her chest_. Which does deal with the whole "broken, lost or stolen" thing - if any of those happened, Yuuki would be much more worried about bleeding to death than not having access to Valkyrie powers.
-   Magical girls and their adult equivalents; sorcerers in _Sweet Dreams_ all use one. They take the form of a gemstone in the girl's signature colour and will sometimes be shaped to match a particular motif her magical girl costume has. Whilst transformed, each one is also a Magical Accessory.
-   In _To Prevent World Peace_, every Magical Girl has one. Focus items can be summoned at will (sorta like Sora's keyblade) and are necessary for transforming. If they ever break . . . it's not good.

    Was the Holy Grail a 7-11 Big Gulp cup that someone spiffied up? The magic of it all was very dazzling, but I should have KNOWN something was wrong from the start. This wasn't how it happened on TV. It wasn't this much of a hack job.
    
-   _Whateley Universe_: Murphy has a devise that does this as seen in Murphy's Laws of Whateley:

Unfortunately, Ace doesn't read the fine print which says he who destroys the talisman gets the antlers of the grand high moose himself.
-   The Omnitrix from _Ben 10_ is a Clingy MacGuffin that lets Ben turn into (initially) ten different aliens.

-   In _He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (2021)_, the guardian of Castle Grayskull explains that a "totem" is required to channel cosmic energy like the Power of Grayskull. Adam uses the Sword of Power to become He-Man, but when he shared the Power with his allies, each of them had an item on their person turned into totems so they could transform into Masters of the Universe. Using kirbinite, Skeletor converts his minions' equipment into totems to harness the power of Havoc and transform into his Dark Masters. But later we learn he only needed the kirbinite to _control them_ so they wouldn't rebel against him.

-   _Tenko and the Guardians of the Magic_ featured the Starfire Gems. In a somewhat uncommon usage, the gems are not tied to any one particular person and each contains unique powers. While in the series, the characters have their own gems that they use almost exclusively, there's nothing to stop them from using another if the situation arose where it would be beneficial. Likewise, the gems each contained powers that could be used outside the transformed state, so it was more common for the characters, both hero and villain, to use their preferred gem to transform and others for their own utility.
