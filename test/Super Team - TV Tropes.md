TITANS, GO!

_"There was an idea, Stark knows this, called 'The Avengers Initiative'. The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could."_

A mish-mash team of superheroes, who don't really have anything in common except that they fight as a team. They probably don't share philosophies, world-views, moral codes, or origins; they may or may not even _like_ each other very much (or at all). The only thing that matters is that the members show up when they're needed.

A Super Team may all live in the same place (if they do, the audience can expect occasional friction from _that_). There is often an overarching organization they've all been recruited by, or work for, to help explain why such different characters band together despite their differences.

If the team does get all "I'll do anything for you man! You're like family to me," then they've become a Badass Crew, and probably have to come up with some Badass Creed and the like. If they're actually related, they're a Super Family Team. Exclusively magical or supernatural Super Teams qualify as a Supernatural Team. If the team all has related powers and color-coded outfits, you're probably looking at a Sentai.

Contrast Legion of Doom and Villain Team-Up.

-   _Problem Children are Coming from Another World, aren't they?_, has the team gathered by Kuro Usagi to aid her No Name country. They are Izayoi Sakamaki, a boy from a present timeline with the power to supercharge any movement he does to do things that are impossible . Asuka Kudou, a girl from a past timeline who has Compelling Voice, and You Kasukabe a girl from the future who's capable of Power Copying animals' abilities.
-   _11eyes_ has the six students who get trapped in the Red Night, a monster infested Dark World version of their world. Once they found each other, they decided to band together to increase their chances of surviving the world every time they cross over to it,
-   _Fairy Tail_. Pick any Mage Guild. Despite them being called "mages" they're just like a regular Super Heroes and everyone has a unique power.
-   _YuYu Hakusho_ has the Team Urameshi. consisting of a half demon, two demons, and a Badass Normal. they became a team due to certain circumstances involving the demon world being too much for one Spirit Detective to handle.
-   _Flame of Recca_ has team Hokage, and every other team in Ura Butou Satsujin. Who each have a unique Madogou imbued with a unique power.
-   _Maken-ki!_'s literal Absurdly Powerful Student Council is a team of Maken users (who were apparently voted into position just like a normal Student Council). "Maken" are Applied Phlebotinum weapons each with a unique power.
-   _NEEDLESS_ The other Needless gathered by Adam Blade to fight the MegaCorp Simeon is this, same goes for Simeon's own Quirky Miniboss Squad. They got their powers from being survivors of Black Spots.
-   _Star Driver_'s Glittering Crux is this. While they're not exactly "empowered" at a glance. they each have a civilian Secret Identity and they are capable of piloting Humongous Mecha from within a different dimension. Uncovering their plot is one of the main motivations for the main character.
-   The eponymous _Strike Witches_ are this. They are Mage Species girls gathered together and trained for their valuable magic prowess. they are the only ones effective enough to fight off the Neuroi.
-   In _Sky Girls_. little girls are the only ones capable of wearing the Latex Space Suit and Mini-Mecha ideal for fighting WORMs who recently reappeared. so they make a team of them and gave them the name Sky Girls.
-   _Haruhi Suzumiya_'s SOS-dan is this. The Team consist of a Team Normal human, an alien, an Esper, and a Time Traveller, and a Physical God. Though with the genre being Slice of Life, most action happens within the Masquerade and they're mostly a team of supers who do nothing but have fun.
-   In _Bakuten Shoot Beyblade_, all bladers that own bit-beasts are capable of weaponizing their Battle Tops to the point they can scream commands at their tops so they will spin faster and _create blackholes or encase the stadium with ice_. Which is why they're the ones in the tournament since the ones with ordinary Battle Tops simply don't stand a chance. Most such bladers form teams together. That all said, there's one team, the Justice 5, that on top of bit-beast usages also are super as people. Garland is the Martial Artist, Brooklyn is the Person of Mass Destruction, Ming-Ming is a dual-mode Magical Girl, Mystel defies gravity, and Moses has raw strength like no other.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_: NERV tries to form one, consisting of children made to pilot the EVAs and combat Angels, to protect whats left of humanity, but the group quickly falls apart due to the psychological issues of themselves and the people they work for, as well as Gendo Ikari's hidden agenda.
-   The more powerful members of Earth's martial arts community increasingly act as this in _Dragon Ball_ as threats to the planet escalate from an "emperor" with a nation consisting of three people, to the most powerful and most evil army in the world, to wicked demons, to world-destroying aliens, to nigh undetectable androids, to a wizard holding the leash of a god killing Omnicidal Maniac. The _Dragon Ball Z_ portion of the anime adaptation alternatively names them "Earth's Special Forces", "The Z Fighters" or "Team Z", although In-Universe no official organization exists. Goku and friends just keep rising to the occasion.
-   _Concrete Revolutio: Choujin Gensou_: The Superhuman Bureau, a Ragtag Bunch of Misfits who work for the government to protect others of their kind.

    Comic Books 

## DC Comics

-   DC Comics' Justice League of America, which not only popularized the idea but over its various incarnations has featured pretty much every single major character DC Comics has. Also they made a few Series based on it ranging from the awesome to the not so awesome.
-   The first Super Team was the Justice Society of America. It and the Seven Soldiers of Victory were both created in the 1940s.
    -   Grant Morrison's Seven Soldiers incarnation stretches the very idea of a super team to its limits; In order to keep the new Soldiers from being killed by the Sheeda like the previous team, they have to be sure that _none of them ever meet each other_. Seven people who don't know one another even exist have to accidentally work together to save the world from a threat they aren't aware of.
-   The _Doom Patrol_, who during Grant Morrison's run fought some of the most surreal villains ever, including The Brotherhood of Dada, who used an LSD-powered bicycle to run for president. The team outright specializes in handling extremely bizarre threats that most other heroes in the DC Universe can't even begin to wrap their heads around.
-   _Justice League Dark_: A team of magic wielding superheroes.
-   The Teen Titans, a collection of Sidekicks and other teenage superheroes.
-   Young Justice, another collection of teenage superheroes, less formal and drama prone than the Titans.
    -   _Young Justice (2019)_: Young Justice reformed, with the core members of the original team and a whole bunch of new ones.
-   _Global Guardians_: An international team of superheroes, that ended up mostly folded into Justice League International.
-   The _Great Ten_ (Shi Hao Xia/十豪侠), China's officially endorsed and government run super team.
-   _Legion of Super-Heroes_: a team of young heroes who work for the United Federation of Planets from The Future!
    -   _L.E.G.I.O.N. (DC Comics)_: A group with superpowered members from a federation of planets that straddles the line between heroes, Space Police and Private Military Contractors.
-   _The Movement_: A group of misfit teens with powers trying to do the right thing.
-   _Shadowpact_: A collation of magic using and magically tied heroes and reforming villains.
-   The _Suicide Squad_, a group of Boxed Crook super villains who are given an offer of a pardon if they complete ridiculously dangerous (one might say suicidal) tasks.
-   Super Young Team a team of young superheroes from Japan.
-   Another DC team, the _Inferior Five_, poked fun at the concept of a team consisting of people who save the world by themselves pretty much every other day of the week. The _Five_ were all so weak that they wouldn't be able to do anything if they _didn't_ work together.
-   _The Terrifics_ DC's answer to the demand for a Fantastic 4 style series after Marvel canceled the book.
-   And _many_ others. There are at least 100 listed at the other Wiki.

DC Imprints

-   Deconstructed twice in _Watchmen_.
    -   In "Under the Hood" (a book-within-a-book written by the first Nite Owl chronicling his time as a superhero), Nite Owl said that "it takes an extreme personality to put on a costume and fight crime and the chance of eight such personalities getting along is a million to one." Then, of course, there's the fact that after the Comedian tried to rape the first Silk Spectre, the Minutemen began to distrust each other and subsequently collapsed.
    -   Later when Captain Metropolis (a member of the last super team, "The Minutemen") tries to form another Super Team, "The Crimebusters", the Comedian denounces the whole idea as bullshit, claiming Captain Metropolis is trying to play "Cowboys and Indians". He further explains that whatever heroic deeds they accomplish will be undone by an impending nuclear war. Rorschach agrees, complaining that "a group this size seems more like a publicity exercise,", adding that "it's too big and unwieldy." The first meeting of the group is the last because of this.
-   The Authority deconstructed the idea of the Super Team by featuring a team that doesn't have those pesky Moral Codes against killing or such. Also one of the earlier examples of Decompressed Comics in America.
-   The Seven in Garth Ennis' _The Boys_. They are a super team who aren't together to fight greater foes or even because they LIKE each other. They're together purely because they make more money of merchandising that way. In fact none of them can stand each other.
-   _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_ is a Super Team with a twist - it features public domain characters from Victorian literature teaming up to battle other threats from other public domain works (and one villain who _wasn't_ in the public domain yet, forcing the writers to be careful with what they called him).

## Marvel Comics

-   Marvel Comics' initial answer to The Justice League was The Fantastic Four, a quartet (sometimes) of Super Heroes that had more in common with a Science Fiction dysfunctional family than with a crime fighting organization.
-   Marvel also has The Avengers (in some continuities called The Ultimates) a collection of that universe's best and brightest Super Heroes, much closer in style and set up to the Justice League.
-   The X-Men is probably Marvel's most popular team, with several Series based on it, and a few movies too. There are a gazillion spin off teams of The X-Men including the New Mutants, X-Factor, X-Factor Investigations, various incarnations of X-Force and X-Statix.
-   The Defenders, a team usually featuring several of Marvel's most popular or least (depending on the incarnation) examples of Misunderstood Loner with a Heart of Gold, banded together to save the world from powerful and often strange threats.
-   The Marvel Knights, a Super Team led by Daredevil that has shown up in Marvel's mature line as well as their Ultimate line.
-   Thunderbolts, a Super Team created by The Avengers villains the Masters of Evil but ultimately thanks to the Heel–Face Revolving Door they started to do good. Various incarnations of the team have come about all featuring former or current villains.
-   A full list can be found at the other Wiki; beware, it's ridiculously complete.

## Other:

-   _Astro City_ has **FAR** too many to list, but here's a quick attempt — Honor Guard, the First Family, the Irregulars, the Unclean, Apollo Eleven, the Crossbreed, the J-Hawks, the Omega Rangers, the Birds of Paradise, Reflex 6, Queenslaw,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  the Experimentals, the Silver Centurions, Powerchord...
-   The Invincible Universe has several, Punch Clock Heroes Capes Inc, the Guardians of the Globe (two versions thereof) and the Teen Team (disbanded when most of its members got too old).
-   _Kick Ass 2_ sees Dave joining a group of like-minded superheroes called Justice Forever.
-   The somewhat obscure _Classwar_ features Enola Gay, yet another Justice League pastiche.
-   _Pride High_ has:
    -   Poseidon Preparatory Academy's Inter-Squad Championship teams (Pride High, the Argonauts, Maka Koa, Teh H4xx0rz, the Vixxens, Five Fold Path, Umoja, La Raza, Feral Force, and the Masterminds)
    -   The World Warriors, who can be assumed to be the universe's Justice League/Avengers
    -   The Champions of Atlantis
    -   The Legends
-   In _All Fall Down_, we have the Pantheon, a group of A-listers named Portia, Paradigm, Pronto, Phylum and Plymouth.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _X-Men Film Series_
    -   _X2: X-Men United_: Jean Grey and Storm willingly ally with Wolverine and Nightcrawler, plus Magneto and Mystique (relunctantly) to stop Styker from committing mutant genocide.
    -   _X-Men Origins: Wolverine_: Colonel William Stryker assembles Team X which features James Howlett, Victor Creed, John Wraith, Agent Zero, Christopher Bradley, Wade Wilson and Fred Dukes. Some of them don't get along very well.
    -   _X-Men: First Class_: Professor X, Magneto, Beast, Mystique, Havok and Banshee form the proto X-Men. Charles Xavier's primary goal is to avert World War III, while the other members are seeking Revenge against Sebastian Shaw for murdering someone they cared about.

    -   _Deadpool 2_ sees the creation of X-Force, comprised of the man himself, along with Domino, Bedlam, Shatterstar, Vanisher, Zeitgeist, and ... Peter, who is completely and totally unpowered but saw the ad and needed a job.
-   Marvel Cinematic Universe
    -   _The Avengers_: Yes, they do take some time to get any traction... but when they _do_, they beat the shit out of **gods** (well, Captain America would say there's only one God and he really doesn't dress like that). The Hulk would merely say "Puny god!". In total, the team consists of Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Thor, and the Hulk, and Agent Phil Coulson.
    -   _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_ had Captain America and Black Widow team up with a retired Air Force pilot, Sam Wilson (Falcon), to fight Hydra and the eponymous Winter Soldier (a Brainwashed and Crazy former ally and friend of the Captain's, Bucky Barnes).
    -   _Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)_ saw the creation of the eponymous team of mercenaries, consisting of Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot. _Vol. 2_ added Mantis and Yondu (though the latter later sacrificed himself to save Star-Lord), as well as Nebula through some Teeth-Clenched Teamwork and Yondu's second in command Kraglin.
    -   _Avengers: Age of Ultron_ saw the addition of Vision, War Machine, Scarlet Witch, and Quicksilver to the Avengers (although the latter did not last long on the team). The final scene added Falcon to the roster as well.
    -   _Captain America: Civil War_ split the Avengers in two: "Team Iron Man" had Iron Man, War Machine, Vision, Black Widow, and franchise newcomers Black Panther and Spider-Man. "Team Captain America" had Captain America, Falcon, Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and Sharon Carter. By the end of the film, due to various defections, the Avengers now consists of Iron Man, War Machine, and Vision. Captain America (now Nomad), Falcon, Black Widow, and Scarlet Witch make up the Secret Avengers, a vigilante team.
    -   _Thor: Ragnarok_ saw the creation of the Revengers, made up of Thor, Hulk, Valkyrie, and Loki, as well as Heimdall, Skurge (briefly), and Korg, Miek, and the other gladiators on Sakaar, to take down the Odinsons' mad sister Hela.
    -   _Avengers: Infinity War_ saw the Avengers (except Ant-Man and Hawkeye, who were both on house arrest), the Secret Avengers, Black Panther and the forces of Wakanda (including M'Baku and the Jabari tribe), Bucky Barnes (now the White Wolf), Spider-Man, Doctor Strange and Wong, the Revengers (except Valkyrie, Korg, and Miek, who were confirmed by Word of God to have been on the other half of the Asgardian ship when Thanos attacked and divided the population), and the Guardians of the Galaxy (including Nebula but not Kraglin) team up to stop Thanos.
    -   _Avengers: Endgame_ Once again saw the Avengers with Ant-Man and Hawkeye, who both returned after their families - save the former's daughter - were dusted along with Rocket, Nebula and War Machine working to reverse Thanos's damage. One hulk snap later, this team is joined by Black Panther and the forces of Wakanda (including M'Baku and the Jabari tribe), Bucky Barnes, Falcon, and Wanda as well as the remaining Guardians (without Gamora), Spider-Man, Doctor Strange and Wong with the masters of the Mystic Arts, the Ravagers, the remaining Asgardians, and Pepper Potts in her own armor team up to stop the 2014 version of Thanos.
-   _DC Extended Universe_:
    -   Following the eponymous duel, _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_ saw the Trinity — Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman — teaming up for the first time in live action, as they battled Doomsday.
    -   _Justice League_ and _Zack Snyder's Justice League_ see the creation of the eponymous super team, with the addition of Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg.
-   The _Guardians (2017)_, composed of four enhanced humans, products of Soviet Superscience: Ursus (werebear), Khan (speedster and knife user), Ler (earth elemental), and Xenia (Invisibility, can handle extreme temperatures and survive for long periods of time without air). They're sent against their Mad Scientist creator, who has developed a device that can control all technology and is marching on Moscow with his clone army.

    Literature 

-   The Society of Paragons in Andrew P. Mayer's _The Falling Machine_ and sequels is a Steampunk superhero team.
-   A number are mentioned in _Super Powereds_. In _Year 1_, Alice is shocked to find out that her father used to be in one, having always considered him a Super who was more interested in advancing his career thank actual crime-fighting. Of course, it can be understandable why he might want this part of his life forgotten, since one of the team members killed his partner and went rogue before being taken down by the rest.
    -   The _Corpies_ spin-off focuses on several teams, one of which isn't actually composed of licensed Heroes and are restricted to assisting emergency services in rescuing civilians. Of the other two main ones in the story, Elemental Fury is the most well-known in the city, composed of a number of heavy hitters (some of these characters make cameos in the main series as well). The Wild Bucks are a team composed of Heroes, who have only recently completed their internships.
-   In _Ex-Superheroes_, the protagonist Hunter used to be a member of a team of SPCs (super-powered combatants) called SPCC<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  West, a branch of the US military. The team consisted of Goldhawk (chemical-induced flight), Concussion (produces shockwaves), Bombardier (fires blasts of explosive energy), Lizard (scaly mutant), Titan (Nigh-Invulnerability and Super-Strength), and Hunter himself (Barrier Warrior). Currently, Hunter is gathering his own team to liberate cities taken over by supervillains, one at a time. It starts with him and Nova (Playing with Fire). In book 1 he recruits Yuki (Intangibility). In book 2 he gets Mariana (Making a Splash). By the end of book 3, he enlists Frost (An Ice Person), Elixir (Healing Hands), and Mindfuck (Telepathy and Mind Rape). Oh, and since the series is also in the Harem Genre, all of Hunter's teammates are incredibly hot women with flexible sexual orientations.
-   A more bureaucratic version is present in _Forging Hephaestus_ called the Alliance of Heroic Champions. It's actually a nationwide organization that manages all "capes" in the country. Its sort-of opponent is the Guild of Villainous Reformation. Interestingly, the AHC and the GVR cooperate frequently, and a major part of GVR training involves learning the Code, which is the only thing that prevents an all-out war between the "capes" and the villains. Code-breakers are hunted down and eliminated by the Guild itself before AHC can do it.
-   In _Legends of the Red Sun_, you get a New Weird version. The evil chancelor Urtica needs an effective measure against increasing crime rates and he also wants to score publicity points, so he needs heroes...no SUPER HEROES. So similar to the Night Guard military, he has his government cultists take 3 individuals and alter them with gene therapy and/or bionics to give them unique powers. Urtica then introduces them as the Viljamur Knights.
-   The eponymous _Renegades_ were originally a group of six superheroes who formed a team in Dread Warden's basement in hopes of freeing their city from the gangs ruling it. By the time of the story, they're a super _syndicate_, composed of dozens of small Super Teams, not to mention all the support personnel.
-   Just as _Doc Savage_ was a first-rank Proto-Superhero from the Golden Age of Pulps, so he also assembled one of the first Proto-Super Teams. The Fabulous Five even had Code Name\[s\]; "Renny," "Johnny," "Long Tom," "Ham" and "Monk."
-   _Worm_ has several, mostly government-sponsored. The Triumvirate consists of the three most powerful parahumans in the world, and the Protectorate, with it's youth division the Wards, is the US and Canada's official government team. Technically the Triumvirate are just the strongest members of the Protectorate but they are in such a league of their own power-wise that they operate basically independently.
    -   In _Ward_, the events of the end of _Worm_ have led to the creation of a profusion of new super teams with wildly varying sources of support and objectives for their heroism; the Wardens, the PRTCJ, Foresight, Breakthrough, The Major Malfunctions, and the Girls At Bat are just a few examples.

    Live-Action TV 

-   This is literally the point of the _Super Sentai_ and _Power Rangers_ shows. Super Sentai literally even translates to "super team".
    -   And within the individual franchises, _Power Rangers RPM_ is probably the one to beat when it comes to teams of misfits. We have an Air Force pilot, a _SCOTTISH_ mechanic who can't hold down a job, a formerly rich party girl who's now a badass biker, a cyborg with no memory, someone who is team clown but never wanted to be a ranger in the first place and yet used to be in the mafia, a pair of Single-Minded Twins, and as the team mentor, a 17-year-old genius with zero people skills and is the one who caused all of this in the first place. Definitely a wide assortment of people.
-   The _Smallville_ version of the Justice League.
-   The Legends in _Legends of Tomorrow_, a Ragtag Bunch of Misfits brought together by time traveller Rip Hunter to bring down immortal supervillain Vandal Savage. The team is made up of Rip, White Canary (Sara), Firestorm (Stein/Jax), Hawkman (Carter), Hawkgirl (Kendra), the Atom (Ray), Captain Cold (Leo), and Heatwave (Mick). In Season 2, we are also introduced to the Justice Society of America, a World War II\-era team of professionals fighting the Nazis. The members include Hourman, Doctor Mid-Nite, Vixen (the grandmother of Mari and Kuasa from _Vixen_), Obsidian, Commander Steel, and Stargirl. Vixen (Amaya) eventually joins the Legends along with a new member named Nate (later called Steel), while the Hawks and Cold are no longer with the team. In season 3, we also get Zari (known as Isis in the comics). In season 4, Amaya and Firestorm are out and Constantine is in.
-   _Supergirl_
    -   The Legion from the 30th century, a team founded by Mon-El after a wormhole deposited him in the future with no way back. The only members shown are Mon-El, Imra Ardeen (Saturn Girl), and Querl Dox (Brainiac 5), although others are mentioned. Brainy later swaps places with Winn, with Winn joining the Legion and departing for the future, and Brainy staying behind and joining the DEO.
    -   After the DEO is disbanded, Supergirl leads a team called the Superfriends, comprising herself, J'onn, Brainy, Dreamer, Sentinal (Alex Danvers) and later Guardian (Kelly Olsen) and Lena Luthor.
-   The Arrowverse also has the Crisis Team, which specifically meets during Crisis Crossovers, comprising Flash, Supergirl, Superman, J'onn, White Canary and Black Lightning. Kate Kane was a member before she passed on the Batwoman identity, and Oliver Queen is considered an honorary member posthumously. They meet in a S.T.A.R. Labs hangar which looks exactly like the Hall of Justice in the comics.
-   The Seven from _The Boys_ are a team of Smug Supers that primarily have popularity due to keeping up a veneer of humility when they deal with the public, but are not above using their powers to get what they want and basically have god complexes like crazy. They are the primary villains of the series because of this. Prior to their formation, the primary Super Team was Payback, and the series mentions several other teams, all of whom are controlled by Vought.
-   _The Umbrella Academy_ could be considered a deconstruction of the trope, since the Umbrella Academy is dysfunctional and badly fumbles their attempts to save the world. Then again, they were forced to be a super-team by their adoptive father and most didn't really want to be heroes.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Super Eric(The Cape), Curry Man(a practical joker) and Stone Cold Shark Boy (a violent antisocial hooligan), TNA's Prince Justice Brotherhood<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , embody that particular bit about having little in common. They mostly fought the good fight, but had very different motivations and strategies regarding TNA's varios crises.
-   Sisters of the Mighty, which formed for CHIKARA's 2018 _King Of Trios_. Aja Perera and Mighty Molly do have a little in common(both were dusting off old cape gimmicks...that's about it) but Solo Darling had only became a superhero for this event.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The Freedom League, equivalent to the Justice League or Avengers in the _Freedom City_ setting for _Mutants & Masterminds_. Also the Next Gen, who are basically the Teen Titans with some X-Men influences. Former teams include F.O.R.C.E. Ops, who were the '90s Anti-Hero team, like X-Force or Extreme Justice, and the Liberty League who were the Golden Age team equivalent to the Justice Society or the Invaders.
-   _Halt Evil Doer!_, another M&M setting, has the Patriots (JLA, Avengers) the Tomorrow Society (X-Men) and the defunct New Fighters for Freedom (Wolfman-era Titans).
-   The titular Gatewatch of the _Oath of the Gatewatch_ set in _Magic: The Gathering_ were directly inspired by examples like the Justice League as per Word of God. The Gatewatch itself is essentially a group of Planeswalkers who join forces to fight the Eldrazi on Zendikar, and stick together to fight other threats throughout the multiverse.
    -   After the end of _War Of The Spark_, with the death of Gideon, and both Nissa and Liliana leaving the group, thus removing three of the original five members, however, the Gatewatch has reformed; they're still dedicated to doing good and fighting evil in the multiverse, but they're less of a centralized team and more like an association of planeswalkers that can share information and call on each other for aid, with founding-member Jace as the informal central point.
-   _Masks_ casts its players as a team of young superheros a la _Teen Titans_.
-   _Claim the Sky_: The Society of Seven is the primary one, corresponding to the Justice League or Avengers. Historically, there have been two versions of Freefire, one in the 1960s and 1970s and the other in the 1980s and 1990s. The Golden Shield is an officially-sanctioned team in the EU.

    Toys 

-   The Toa in BIONICLE are Mata Nui's heroes, sent to protect Matoran.
-   Pick a team from any of the more visually-oriented folders on this page. Odds are one company or another has produced that team in plastic. Sometimes several times.

    Video Games 

-   _EXTRAPOWER: Attack of Darkforce_ revolves around assembling one of these to defend against the Dark Force invasion of the Earth.
-   _Rival Schools_ has each of the playable schools' representative characters be either a Badass Normal or someone who can use a Ki Manipulation. They are Cast Herded as teams.
-   In _God Eater Burst_, The God Eaters are Super Soldiers imbued with Aragami cells that allows them to fight the creatures, grouped into teams consisting of the five-member First Unit (which is also your main characters' team), a three member City Defense unit and a three member Support unit.
-   The _Fallout_ series has an in-universe comic book series known as "The Unstoppables", which was a team featuring various fictional characters such as Grognak the Barbarian, The Silver Shroud and the Mistress of Mystery.
-   _Freedom Force_, led by Minuteman in the field and Mentor on the strategic side.
-   _Heroes Rise_ has several, including the Millennial Group, the proposed national team called the American Protectorate, a briefly mentioned Badass Normal team called the Everyman Brigade, and a villainous one called the Splice Circle.
-   _Overwatch_ involves an international team of Military Superheroes and then adventurers, products of superscience plus Science Heroes which first started when the founding members battled an A.I. uprising.
-   _South Park: The Fractured but Whole_ has two competing superhero teams in the form of Coon and Friends (led by Cartman) and the Freedom Pals (led by Timmy), both seeking to become a Cash-Cow Franchise in the vein of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. By the end of the game, everyone has joined together under the Freedom Pals banner except Cartman, who went rogue and kidnapped the New Kid's parents as part of an attempt to get elected mayor after he found out the Freedom Pals' franchise plan would focus on everyone equally.
-   The _Super Robot Wars_ series involves the gathering of the heroes of several Super Robot and Real Robot anime(and the occasional Light Novel, Manga, or even other video games), who come together to form a team to take on their various invaders and rivals together.
-   _XCOM Legends_ an Interquel between XCOM2 and XCOM: Chimera Squad treats the current incarnation of XCOM as this. Besides having standard XCOM personnel, there members from other factions: Aliens, Templars, Skirmishers, Exalt and Reapers. are also part of the overall team. With every member using non-standard costumes + weapons and additionally they all have special skills or actual powers derived from innate psionics, weird genetics, unique tech items and extensive bionics - this XCOM is a Military Superhero team not unlike _Overwatch_ which some of the XCOM Legends characters are based on.

    Web Animation 

-   The eponymous Team RWBY, and most other four-student teams. Justified, because they are all Hunters-in-training.

    Webcomics

-   Team Kimba, of the Whateley Universe. They're only teenagers at Superhero School Whateley Academy, but they've already beaten superpowered ninjas from the Yama Dojo, the Necromancer and his team The Children of the Night, and Lovecraftian horrors. Plus, they're not supposed to be superheroing, so they keep getting detention for this stuff.
    -   Most of the students at Whateley are on training teams or are in groups that can put up some sort of superfight in a pinch, the chief exception being the Underdogs.
    -   Outside of the school, super-teams are fairly common; most nations have at least one, as do most US states, of various sizes and degrees of organization. Many cities have at least one local team, while major cities such as New York or Los Angeles may have two or more. It has been mentioned that most teams only last about ten years, though usually a new group will form some time after the previous one retires.
-   The _League of Intergalactic Cosmic Champions_ was a group of super heroes (more or less) crossed with _Star Trek_ zipping around the universe in a Cool Ship fighting evil.
-   ASH from _Academy Of Super Heroes_ is the big-league super team of that universe. STRAFE is more of a superpowered covert ops team.

-   The Justice Alliance from _Atomic Puppet_ is made of a trio of DC superheroes expies and formerly Captain Atomic (who was succeeded by Atomic Puppet).
-   _Young Justice (2010)_ features a group simply named "The Team" — although they have quite a lot in common with the Teen Titans, whose name was already taken by another cartoon. In-universe, the reason for this is that they're a covert ops group, and there's no need to bring extra attention to themselves.
-   _Xiaolin Showdown_ is a Multinational Team consisting of a Japanese chick, a Brazilian Surfer Dude, An All American Cowboy, a Chinese Apprentice Monk... and a size-shifting Eastern Dragon. They were assembled to gather Shen Gong Wu.
-   _Ninjago_ is about four ninjas who can control Fire, Lightning, Earth, and Ice. they were assembled to protect the Green Ninja, The Chosen One to wield all four elements and The Hero of the verse itself.

-   _South Park_ has the Super Best Friends, a team composing of various religions figures such as Jesus, Moses, Joseph Smith and Seaman (an Aquaman parody). There is also Coon and Friends, which is just the kids dressing up and playing a superhero game.
-   The third season of _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_ featured Marco forming the Marc-nificent 7, consisting of himself, Tom, Hekapoo, Kelly, Pony Head, Talon, and Jorby to take down Meteora.
-   Parodied in the fifth Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy episode of _Spongebob Squarepants_, which features Barnacle Boy turning evil and created his own organization of villains. Mermaid Man then recruits Spongebob and the other characters to recreate the International Justice League of Super Acquaintances with their costumes. Unfortunately, they're so incompetent they end up _beating themselves up_.
-   An In-Universe example appears with the Power Ponies from _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_, although the episode features the Mane 6 taking on their personas in a Trapped in TV Land scenario. The actual Mane 6 themselves could qualify, being formed to take down supernatural bad guys, although it's usually just a Slice of Life show.
-   In the season 2 finale of _Ducktales 2017_, Scrooge McDuck calls upon all of his friends and allies that were featured in the past two seasons in order to fend off the Moonlander Invasion. The main members consisted of two superheroes, his demon butler, a Dark Magical Girl and her bookworm sister, a trio of Badass Normal ladies, a Mad Scientist and his clone army, a headless man-horse and Launchpad. And that's not even counting his own Badass Family and super acquaintances from around the world.
-   _Teen Titans (2003)_, with the titular team. Seen in the picture up top.
-   _Rick and Morty_ has the Vindicators, a group of superheroes that Rick and Morty have worked with in offscreen adventures. They're something of a parody of Marvel heroes (with Morty treating their past team-ups as the equivalent of films and referring to their current adventure as "Vindicators 3"), though the team quickly falls apart during the episode due to Rick's actions as well as their own internal squabbling.

    Real Life 

-   The Rain City Superhero Movement is an attempt to create such a team in Real Life. Of course, the members don't have superpowers, but they use superhero costumes and nicknames.
