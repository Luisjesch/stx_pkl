_"I'm sorry, Papa. This isn't how I wanted this to happen. I had to. You left me no choice, and I'll do what I must to protect our home, even if that means I have to hurt you Papa!"_

Sometimes, family doesn't stay together forever.

This trope is based on when family members, for whatever reason, end up fighting one another. Generally, this is because of one member making a Heel–Face Turn or the inverse, but can often happen due to someone manipulating another as in Deceptive Legacy and Insidious Rumor Mill.

This rarely if ever comes up in works where Status Quo Is God. If a family member changes sides, then they are fighting their former family until the series ends or someone ends up dead. See Big Brother Bully, Cain and Abel, Abusive Parents, Archnemesis Dad, Hates Their Parent, Gruesome Grandparent, and Evil Uncle for examples of characters that tend to end up here.

Note that in order for families to count, both sides have to know that they were family before they started fighting. So Darth Vader and Father (the one from _Codename: Kids Next Door_) don't count as the family they were fighting didn't know about their relationship until later in the series.

Subtrope of We Used to Be Friends and Dysfunctional Family. Contrast Thicker Than Water. Also see Big, Screwed-Up Family and Friends Are Chosen, Family Aren't. It frequently overlaps with Prodigal Family, when estranged family members showing up after a long time complicates a character's life.

-   _Tekken_
    -   Heihachi Mishima used to be deeply in love with his wife, Kazumi. However, when she reveals that the only reason she married him was to assassinate him before his ambitions for world conquest ruined the world, he is forced to kill her in self-defense. In turn, this made Heihachi bitter towards not only her but their son (because he had the same supernatural curse in his blood that she did). Likewise, when a young Kazuya learned that Heihachi had killed his beloved mother, Kazuya attacked him. Then, both as a test to see if the boy would succumb to his curse and out of spite, he tossed Kazuya off a cliff. Sure enough, the Devil took hold and from that moment on, both father and son were mortal enemies.
    -   _Tekken 7_ reveals that while Kazuya loved his mother so much as to try to avenge her after Heihachi killed her, she saw Kazuya as nothing but another aspect of her mission. In fact, she had already arranged for Akuma of _Street Fighter_ fame to kill both her husband and son if anything ever happened to her. Kazuya overhears Akuma telling Heihachi this and is genuinely surprised and _hurt_ to learn that his beloved mother had wanted to kill him. However, being Kazuya, he quickly laughs at the irony, as it no longer mattered.
    -   Kazuya was also very fond of his paternal grandfather, Jinpachi, who partially trained and doted on him as a youth before Heihachi betrayed him. By the time Kazuya had grown up, Jinpachi had been consumed by a wicked demonic power and Kazuya himself had embraced his devil persona. Thus, in Kazuya's Tekken 5 ending, he briefly holds his injured grandfather in his arms and the two recollect their happier years together...before Kazuya's eyes burn red and he flashes a Slasher Grin before finishing Jinpachi off.
    -   History repeated with Kazuya's son, Jin Kazama. While not exactly "loving" of his grandfather, Jin was told by his mother Jun to seek Heihachi if something ever happened to her (which it did). Heihachi raised and trained Jin, and even enrolled him in his school, but it was all part of Heihachi's plan to lure out Jun's killer: a creature called Ogre. When Jin gets to Ogre first and slays him, Heihachi decides that he has outlived his usefulness and orders his men to gun him down. Once again, Jin survives because the Devil he inherited from his father takes control, and Jin spends the next several years despising and plotting the downfall of every member of the Mishima family.
    -   After Jin himself underwent a Face–Heel Turn upon seizing control of the Mishima Zaibatsu, one of his strongest subordinates in the Tekken Force was Lars Alexandersson, who is later revealed to be Kazuya's half-brother (and thus, Jin's half-uncle). While their relationship was mostly that of commander and loyal subordinate (as neither knew they were family at the time), the moment that Jin betrayed him and got the men under his command killed, Lars and Jin became bitter enemies, and in fact, being part of the same family they both despised only made their animosity that much greater. In _Tekken 7_, the two are forced to bury the hatchet to deal with Kazuya, who had finally killed Heihachi and was now poised to conquer the world unopposed.
    -   Finally, there's Lee Chaolan, who's Heihachi's adopted son and thus the adopted brother of Kazuya and adopted uncle of Jin. Initially he was something of an Opportunistic Bastard who worked with Heihachi or Kazuya against the other, but he was eventually exiled and after seeing how badly things were going for the world due to the Mishima family feud, he ultimately ended up teaming up with Lars to try and put a stop to things, positioning himself as a Big Good who was trying to prevent the others from wrecking the world with their fight.

However, once Amber hit puberty, she became increasingly remote from Ruby, just as the latter found herself increasingly isolated and something of a Bully Magnet at school; Ruby became jealous of Amber's attractiveness, social success, and (in Ruby's eyes) favored status with their parents. Then, after Amber left home, the young Ruby discovered (in highly embarrassing circumstances) that Amber had become a porn star — and Amber persuaded the naturally truthful Ruby to keep this a secret from their parents. Then, when the strip begins, the sisters find themselves obliged to share an apartment.
