_"His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from his mouth."_

Myth and folklore are replete with dragons and other creatures spewing fire, corrosive venom, noxious gases, energy beams, lightning, and other exotic and catastrophic exhalations from their mouth. More modern media have applied the motif to fantastic beasties, Kaiju, creatures from alien worlds, mutants, zombies, and even the occasional robot, and expanded the effects to encompass blazing beams of coruscant annihilation. In other words, bright things coming from the mouths of big things that can destroy other things.

Classically a trait of creatures that are, at least physically, animalistic — no matter how erudite and noble they may be. When _humanoids_ vomit destruction from their mouths, they almost always have at least a hint of corruption or, at best, atavism about them. According to anthropologist David D. Gilmore, this is because of the mouth's symbolism as the organ of predation, evoking one mankind's primal fears of what used to hunt them. Given that a human being's only experience with oral expulsions is usually spit or vomit (or in the case of certain snakes, venom), it may then follow that anything coming out of the mouth is unpleasant. Whatever the reason, it's right up there with Glowing Eyes of Doom as a surefire sign of inhumanity. _Heroes_ will generally emit blasts of destruction from their palms or their eyes instead (though villains can do that too). This is also why, in Primate Versus Reptile stories, the reptile is more likely to have the Breath Weapon than the primate.

A number of Breath Weapons are especially common:

-   Acid: While not strictly a _breath_ weapon per se, acidic spit is often included in lists of breath weapons. A more breath-based version also exists where a character breathes out a cloud of corrosive mist instead.
-   Darkness: Common among traditionally evil creatures like demons, this breath weapon usually manifests as semi-solid shadows, dark clouds of smoke, unnaturally colored fire, or, ironically, beams of dark-colored "light". In cases of corrupted creatures, expect to see them use variations of their natural breath weapons, but shaded in the designated "evil" colors of the setting.
-   Earth: The ability to launch sand or rock particulates with deadly force. Common for desert-dwelling or subterranean monsters. The blast can come in a large column that can crush or tear targets apart or a concentrated stream that carves through materials in its path. Rapid-fire sharpened crystal shards and metal "bullets" are common variations of the attack. Sometimes combines with fire to produce blasts of lava breath. Water can also mix to make sticky mud or quick drying concrete as is a common ability for swamp monsters.
-   Energy: Breathing vaguely-defined "energy" is common in more exotic or mystical creatures. While glowing beams or balls are most common, this breath is such an esoteric idea that it can take on many forms, including those of other breath weapons. However it looks, it will always be noted as unique from any other breath and has no obligation to behave as what its current shape would suggest. Examples include "fire" that doesn't burn or "lightning" that can bend to chase down a target. Often said to be related to lifeforce, spirit, ki energy, and/or magical energy in some manner.
-   Fire: The archetypal and most iconic breath weapon, fire is almost obligatory for dragons and related creatures, although anyone with well-developed fire powers may also demonstrate this ability. In particularly extreme cases, the breath may take the form of a beam or an explosive ball of plasma that is much more destructive than normal flame.
-   Ice: Another common breath weapon, ice is often included as a direct inversion of the popular fire breath. The most common form is a gale of icy air that freezes everything it touches, but volleys of icy shards are not unheard of. Beams of "coldness energy" that produce mass volumes of ice on contact are fairly common variations of these attacks.
-   Light: Light, when focused into a point or narrow beam, can be a very destructive force. Light-based breath weapons consequently manifest in the form of lasers, although more diffuse radiance can also prove effective against creatures that are Weakened by the Light.
-   Lightning: While also not a breath-based ability in the strictest sense, characters and creatures with strong enough ties to electricity are known to spit lightning bolts.
-   Poison: Like acid, which may or may not be treated as the same exact thing, poison-based breath weapons can come both as jets of toxic liquid and as clouds of noxious gases.
-   Radiation: Made famous by the King of the Monsters himself, this is the ability to launch blasts of focused high-intensity radiation or radioactive plasma. As radiation is often poorly understood by the general public beyond being seen as dangerous and does not conform to the traditional elements, this ability is usually reserved for monsters with a particular "otherness" to them. Most common with artificially created monsters (especially those mutated by exposure to radiation) and extraterrestrials.
-   Smoke: While often seen as a byproduct of fire breath, smoke can be an effective weapon in and of itself. As a support ability, smoke can be expelled in large volumes to obscure the target's vision or suffocate those who can't escape the area in time. Less commonly, smoke itself can be directly damaging: either by burning the target with suspended superheated ash, poisoning with toxic particulates, or somehow impacting with concussive force.
-   Sound: Some creatures and characters are capable of roaring, howling, shouting or otherwise vocalizing with sufficient volume to employ their voices as effective sonic weapons.
-   Water: An ability often suited to an aquatic creature; indeed, many Eastern dragons in particular will likely have one due to their association with water. It often takes the form of a water spray similar to that from a hose or a concentrated blast similar to a high-pressure water cutter. A variant may even combine this with fire to launch _boiling_ water or superheated steam.
-   Wind: Making the "breath" part quite literal, this ability weaponizes exhalation. A creature need only take a deep breath before unleashing a gale-force blast of air that might as well be a localized tornado in form and destructive power. "Bullets" of compressed air or flurries of cutting wind blades are less extreme alternatives as is inhalation producing a consuming vortex.

Typically, any given character or creature only has one breath weapon. Multiple ones per person are very rare, and usually indicate that the user is special in some way. The primary exception are many-headed creatures; in these cases, it's common for each head to have a different breath weapon.

A particular type of Street Performer or member of The Freakshow — known variously as a "fire-breather" or a "fire-eater" — uses the magician's sleight-of-hand to appear to do this. Such examples can go on this page as well, since such tricks can be extremely dangerous for both performer and audience.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Calvin and Hobbes_: In one of the Sunday comics, Calvin watches a Kaiju movie and later pretends to be a giant monster rising from the depths of his bathtub, shooting a "fireball" at his archenemy Megalon (read: spits water at his mom while naked).
-   In _Hsu and Chan_ "Pocket Morons Platinum", the Charmander-spoof Gila Mobster performs the Flamethrower attack by taking a swig off his flask & blowing it through the cigarette lighter he holds in his tail.

    Fan Works 

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_: Besides Mothra's projectile webbing, Rodan can spit fireballs from his maw like in unused _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_ concept art. Meanwhile, MaNi/Elder Brother retains the ability to fire a Gravity Beam in his current state.
-   _Adopted Displaced_: In addition to his original ability to breathe fire, Spike acquires a variety of other breath weapons, including freezing breath (via Rundus), electricity (via Gandrayda) and Fazite breath, which is antithetical to Phazon.
-   _Antipodes_:
    -   Tantalus can breathe out torrents of green fire.
    -   The sea serpent that lives in the lake below Jigsaw and Tiptoe's home bunker can emit a powerful laser beam from its mouth.
-   _Boldores And Boomsticks_: Thanks to using a TM on herself, Yang can use Flamethrower.
-   _A Certain Droll Hivemind_: From "Entry 26": Mikoto and one of her clones meet the last dragonslayer. While Mikoto is arguing over whether dragons ever existed, 11111 muses on what the Network knows of dragons.
    
    The original nods. "Yeah, sure," she says. She has her arms crossed, and is tapping her foot. We do not believe she is impressed. "And I suppose you've killed lots and lots of dragons. Because they're a thing that exist."  
    Hamida pouts. "No! Because my great-grandfather killed the last one!"  
    "Oh, right." The original crossed her arms. "How convenient."  
    I agree that it is convenient. Our research has revealed that dragons are large fire-breathing mythological monsters. It would be very inconvenient to have them around. They are said to eat princesses. The original is known as the Electric Princess as one of her alternate titles. We suspect she would object violently if a dragon tried to eat her, but it is possible that we would be mistaken for her. We have not been eaten by a dragon before. We are not enthusiastic about the idea.
    
-   _Casey Steele_: When Rebecca Clause mentions her Dragon Ancestry, Casey asks if this also means that she can breathe fire.
-   _Destiny Intertwined_: The first form of elemental manipulation to manifest in a dragon, and which all individuals can do to at least some degree, is a breath weapon. Increased training allows this to be sustained for longer and to cause more damage.
    -   Earth is a stream of nature energy, tinged either green, brown or grey and flecked with leaves, dirt, or pebbles depending on the variety.
    -   Electricity manifests as a lightning bolt shot from the mouth.
    -   Fire is the classic stream of flame.
    -   Ice is a cloud of chill wind and powdery snow that freeze whatever they touch. Practice allows this to be condensed into projectiles of solid ice.
    -   Water is a jet of high-pressure liquid. High training allows this to be ejected with enough force to serve as a pressure cutter.
    -   Wind is a gust of buffeting air.
    -   Shadow can be exhaled as a cloud of icy, asphyxiating black smoke.

-   _Fallout: Equestria - Project Horizons_: In chapter 36, Sanguine reveals that one of the benefits of being a Canterlot Ghoul who isn't fused into a full-body outfit is that he has a constant supply of Pink Cloud in his lungs, which he can exhale over any threat that gets too close. He blows a gout into the face of the unicorn Priest when he tries to stop Sanguine, causing Priest's entire face to melt like a candle too close to a flame. Then, when Priest collapses to the ground, his own running facial flesh _fuses_ to the soul where he falls.
-   _FateBlack Reflection_: Kakolethros' Μηδέν (pronounced Midén, Greek for "Zero") is a stream of spiritual energy and mana that it fires fom its mouth. Although it bears a resemblance to the Cero used by Menos-class hollows, it's outright stated that it doesn't pack anywhere near as much of a punch due to Kakolethros' origins. Despite this, the technique is acknowledged as being a serious threat to a normal human or a magus.
-   _Godzilla Neo_: Several Kaiju are able to do it, but the one with the added ability is the _Godzillasaurus_. It's explained that their breath weapon was natural and when the dinosaurs mutated, so too were their attacks.
-   _Half Past Adventure_: The Grass Dragon has a powerful Acid Attack breath weapon, for some reason.
-   _Harry Is a Dragon, and That's OK_: As a dragon learning magic, in addition to his regular dragon fire (which isn't as strong due to his age), Harry has learned to cast some spells with his breath, usually fire-based ones like Bluebell Flames, the fire whip spell and even Fiendfyre, but also stuff like _Aguamenti_ that allows him to breathe water, and even the Bubble-Head Charm.
-   _Hellsister Trilogy_: During the war with Apokolips, Superman and Supergirl often use their ice-cold super-breath to freeze enemies and put out fires.
-   _Ice and Fire (Minecraft)_:
    -   Fire dragons can breathe a stream of flames or an explosive fireball, ice dragons breathe freezing mist, and lightning dragons spit thunderbolts.
    -   Hydras spit streams of venom.
-   _Origin Story_: Alex Harris (a Kryptonian trapped in the Marvel Universe) uses her “super-breath” on Reed Richards to freeze him, thus nullifying his stretching capabilities. He compliments her on her creative thinking.
-   _OSMU: Fanfiction Friction_: The dragon that attacked Orla and goes after Oswald in Chapter 8 has the typical fire-breathing ability that most dragons have.
-   _Oskar Osäker: True Omnivore:_ Oskar/Emerald gains the ability to breath fire or plasma after consuming a Dragon that possessed the same ability.

-   _Star Wars: Galactic Folklore and Mythology_:
    -   Frostbite, a beast created from ice and stones by the giant Big Bloqo, is said to have been able to freeze enemies solid with his icy breath.
    -   The mythical rolyetra from Frozian mythology can breathe fire. The stated reason for this is that one once heard the true name of the king of the gods, who caused the beast's breath and voice to turn to flame so that it couldn't reveal this secret.
-   _Tales of the Emperasque_: The Emperor, upon merging with a Tarrasque, gets its powerful kinetic/fiery roar which he combines with his own psyker powers, creating a weapon that can cause class 2 Apocalypse How.
-   _Under the Northern Lights_:
    -   Nidhoggs breathe out void-cold freezing wind.
    -   Skolls are an unusual example, in that they approximate the effects of ice breath but do so by inhaling heat rather than exhaling cold. This difference proves critical against Twilight's shield spell, which is designed to keep enemy attacks out while letting allies through — since the Skolls simply make a part of their prey move towards them, their attack isn't stopped by the shield.
-   _Vow of the King_: While transformed, Tatsuki can fire a beam of lightning from her mouth.
-   _What Lies Beyond the Walls_ has Gila the Putrid, whose breath is so toxic that he manages to bring a rat to his knees and makes him throw up profusely just after Gila exhales in his face.
-   _With Strings Attached_:
    -   George, apparently an unlimited shapeshifter, does a red dragon and gets quite a bit of mileage out of his breath weapon during the battle on the Plains of Death.
    -   _The Keys Stand Alone: The Soft World_: George does several dragons to take advantage of their breath weapons, including a red dragon again to wipe out most of the Laser Bats, and a brass dragon to put a room full of giant centipedes to sleep. (He also puts John and Ringo to sleep because he talks nonstop while he's the brass dragon.)
-   _Wyvern_: Taylor has manifested three distinct form of fire breath: an explosive fireball whose size, "fuse" and power she can deliberately control, a narrow and extremely hot blue-white cutting torch, and a broader cone of flames.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Aladdin_: Jafar breathes fire during his battle with Aladdin.
-   _Batman: Gotham Knight_: Killer Croc does one inadvertently when Bats sticks an explosive of some sort in his mouth and sets it off. "Belching smoke and flame", indeed!
-   _How to Train Your Dragon_: Most of the dragons have some sort of breath weapon. Usually it's the standard shots of flame at varying degrees of volume, heat and intensity, but more exotic variants exist:
    -   Night furies and light furies have a turbolaser.
    -   Zipplebacks breathe flammable gas to create a fuel-air explosion — one head breathes out the gas and the other lights it.
    -   Gronkles eat rocks and vomit them back up as lava.
    -   Scauldrons spit out jets of superheated boiling water.
    -   Smothering smokebreaths exhale thick clouds of fog, which they use for concealment and to confuse and disorient enemies.
    -   Changewings spit globs of lime green Hollywood Acid.
-   _The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild_: The small lizards can breathe fire.
-   _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf: Amazing Pleasant Goat_: The goats have to fight a dragon that can turn anything into stone with its breath. The dragon uses its breath to turn several of the characters into stone a couple of times.
-   _Space Jam_: One of the abilities of the Monstars is breathing fire.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _After Earth_: The Ursa can spit gouts of corrosive liquid.
-   _Arachnoquake_: The spiders occasionally breathe fire.
-   _Batman Returns_: The Red Triangle Circus Gang has the Fire Breather, a performer dressed as a devil who contributes to the atmosphere of street terrorism by "blowing fire" on a display of jumbo stuffed animals in a toy store. Batman dispatches him by turning the Batmobile around so that the car's exhaust pipe is facing him and shooting out a jet of flame, setting the Fire Breather on fire.
-   _Big Trouble in Little China_: David Lo Pan fires a blinding blast of light from his mouth. The effects are only temporary, which is apparently common knowledge to residents of Little China.
-   _Blazing Saddles_: During the big fight scene, Gabby Johnson the grizzled drunk mountain man grabs a bad guy by the collar and exhales in his face, knocking him out.
-   _Bone Eater_: The titular monster can somehow spew a gas that turns people into dust _despite being a skeletal monster with no lungs_.
-   _Dragonheart_: Draco is an odd variant: unlike the typical depiction of dragons, he shoots flames from his nostrils rather than his mouth. This is relevant to the plot, as this way he cannot just shoot flames at the knight standing in his mouth and propping his palate with a sword.
-   Gamera breathes fire — a continuous stream in the original series, and exploding plasma balls in the modern films directed by Shusuke Kaneko. The sonic rays fired by frequent nemesis Gyaos straddle the line between Breath Weapon and Super-Scream.
-   _Godzilla_:
    -   Godzilla breathes concentrated streams of radiation. This appears to be a form of superheated vapor in the Showa era films, but becomes a pure energy beam in the 90s and beyond.
    -   Omitted in _Godzilla (1998)_ (where he technically has a "power breath" that simply makes things catch on fire rather than producing fire itself) since Roland Emmerich felt it was "unrealistic".
    -   Godzilla has this power in _Godzilla (2014)_, true to the original incarnation of him. Unlike the laser appearance from Toho's Heisei and Millennium eras, this incarnation's atomic breath is similar to the superheated vapour appearance from the Showa era (though _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_ made it a bit closer to the energy beam design from the Heisei films and more beam-like in _Godzilla vs. Kong_, to the point he uses it to drill through the crust of the Earth into its hollow center). He uses it as the _coup de grâce_ against the female Muto three times, but it's only when he _force-feeds_ it to her that it has any real effect. Also, significantly, the first time he uses it he visibly _inhales_ first. He is quite literally _breathing_ atomic fire.
    -   Ghidorah fires lightning bolts from its three mouths; these are sometimes called "gravity beams", and in _Godzilla: Final Wars_ they actually have an anti-gravity effect.
    -   Destoroyah fires "micro-oxygen" rays that disintegrate matter.
    -   Really, this trope is so pervasive in the daikaiju genre that there is a great number of examples not listed here; attempting to include every one would likely prove fruitless.
    -   _Shin Godzilla_: Godzilla is able to not only shoot a beam from his mouth, but one from a vestigial mouth from its tail, and also a Beam Spam from his spines. However, this time doing so uses up a lot of Godzilla's energy and after doing so he stops moving for several weeks to recharge.
    -   _Godzilla Minus One_: This version of Godzilla's breath weapon (called a heat ray in this film) shows Godzilla inhaling before he fires, similar to the 2014 film. While the blue glow is still here and even travels up from the tip of his tail like his Monstervese incarnation, but now Godzilla's dorsal spines now painfully extend from his back at the same time before slamming back in to release it. This process bears a striking resemblance to how the control rods of a nuclear reactor function. It also causes a massive explosion, as if an atomic bomb had been set off, further driving home the allegory for nuclear war, as a single use destroys Ginza.
-   _The Mask_ features this in what could be described as a _literal_ Blow Gun: villainous Dorian goads his mobster boss into shooting him while wearing the mask... and using the device's cartoonish powers, he absorbs the bullets, takes a breath and "fires" with his mouth.
-   _The Mummy (1999)_: Imhotep belches out a huge swarm of flies.
-   _Pacific Rim_, in keeping with its roots in the Kaiju genre, includes one Category 4 kaiju that spews blue corrosive slime from its mouth. The game takes it a step further, granting breath weapons to some previously unequipped kaiju.
-   _Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End_ plays this one for laughs, as captain Jack Sparrow possesses bad breath of such potency as to be able to make people swoon. To put how bad his breath is in perspective, when face to... mouth with the Krakken, whose breath is said to be the foulest thing on earth he barely even reacts to it.
-   _Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie_: Alex uses wind element magic from her mouth on Justin.
-   _Wrath of the Titans_: The Chimera can breathe fire, with the horned, rhino-like head vomiting gasoline-like fluid that the fanged, ape-like head ignites with hot embers.
-   _X-Men: First Class_: Not quite breath, but Angel can spit Fireballs.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Doctor Who_: Female Raxacoricofallapatorians can breathe poison from their lungs as a defense mechanism. One tried it on the Doctor. It didn't work.
-   _Farscape_:
    -   Sheeyangs can spit fire. Unfortunately, the same biological quirks that allow them to do this also mean that they explode violently when shot.
    -   Although most Scarrans prefer to emit their deadly heat-beams from their hands, at least one projects it from his mouth while speaking.
-   _Game of Thrones_: The dragons have the standard ability to breath fire.
-   _Kamen Rider Hibiki_: Before the Retool, the Rider could shoot flame from his mouth.
-   _Magic Mountain_: Dragon conjures magic by blowing a breath of smoke from his mouth. Notably called his Magic Dragon Breath.
-   _Power Rangers_:
    -   _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_: Various monsters can breathe fire and other dangerous things, the Mastodon Dinozord can snort freezing mist out its trunk, Titanus can launch energy balls from his mouth, Lokar's Breath of Doom can upgrade monsters and cause major property damage, the Red Dragon Thunderzord can breathe fire, the Tigerzord can shoot Energy Balls from the tiger head when in warrior mode, Serpentera can fire an energy attack from its mouth (this was once used to _vaporize a planet_, although Serpentera has not been able to build up sufficient power since), the Frog Ninjazord breathes fire, and the Falconzord shoots laser bolts from its mouth. Additionally, in _Zyuranger_ Bandora can exhale strong winds.
    -   _Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue_: Vypra can breathe blue fire into her hands and then launch it from them.
    -   _Power Rangers Samurai_: Yamiror breathes out poison gas.
-   _Ultra Series_:
    -   Kaiju can turn up with virtually every type, such as fire, acid, poison gas, lightning, generic energy beams, and many others of this sort.
    -   The Ultras themselves were originally intended to possess these. But since the movable mouth for the suit intended to be used for that looked better on paper than on screen, it was scrapped.

        -   The red dragon of seven heads that chases the woman dressed with the Sun and crowned with stars attempts to drown her with water coming from its mouth that produces a flood.
-   Classical Mythology:
    -   The Chimera could breath fire. In some versions, she was actually killed by having a lead tipped spear shoved into its throat causing her to suffocate on the molten lead.
    -   _The Iliad_: The Chimera is described as "a thing of immortal make, not human, lion-fronted and snake behind, a goat in the middle, and snorting out the breath of the terrible flame of bright fire" (VI. 179-182).
-   Egyptian Mythology: The sacred uraei and serpents of the Duat breathe fire to protect the king and gods.
-   Norse Mythology: As if being a sea serpent big enough to encircle the _world_ wasn't scary enough, Jormungandr the Midgard Serpent also has poisonous breath. In the Final Battle of Ragnarok, Thor breathes in too much of Jormungandr's breath while beating it to death with Mjölnir. He's badass enough to try and keep going, but only manages to take nine steps before finally dying.
-   In Scottish folklore, the Nuckelavee has diseased breath that blights plants and makes humans and animals ill.
-   A common version of the mythological beast catoblepas describes it as having poisonous breath (one description of the poisonous exhalation, curiously, matches the properties of the now-well known toxic gas phosgene).
-   One of the Fomorians, the legendary race who ruled Ireland before the coming of humans, is said to have had a terrible eye that turned people to frozen ice, and breath that touched everything with the blight of deep winter snow and frost. Michael Moorcock wrote the second Corum trilogy as a thinly-velied Expy of Irish myth where the "Fhoi Myore" rule the land.
-   The tripodero, a humorous cryptid, spits wads of mud at birds and small mammals to bring them down.

    Puppet Shows 

-   _The Muppet Show_: At the end of "A Nice Girl Like Me" in the Sandy Duncan episode, Duncan — having downed an entire row of whiskies — breaths on the Muppet monsters and they all collapse from alcohol fumes.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   The "poison mist" used by many wrestlers, especially in Japan. According to Japanese Kayfabe, only certain wrestlers can do it because they have a special gland that allows them to produce the mist. Most wrestlers can produce only certain colors of mist, and each has its own effects: The most common, the green mist, blinds the opponent, the red mist both blinds and burns, the blue mist puts the opponent to sleep, the yellow mist paralyzes, and The Dreaded black mist is a career ender.

-   _RPGMP3_: The _Jade Regent_ Campaign features a character called Skygni, who's a magically Awakened frost\-breathing Winter Wolf. He swore a Blood Oath (under duress) to not eat people. Well, at least not the ones travelling with the heroes' caravan, anyway.
-   _RWBY_: Cinder Fall weakly breathes out fire when she screams in frustration. Being a Maiden, she can presumably do this with other elements, but it seems to be involuntary. In Volume 8, as part of her She's Back moment, she demonstrates the ability to control it in the final battle.

    Webcomics 

-   _Aurora (2019)_:
    -   Dragons are the most common users of this, with different varieties having different effects. For a few examples, a burrower wyrm's breath disintegrates stone, a crystal drake's breath causes rapid crystal growth, and a whispdragon's breath is a sonic attack.
    -   Magic can also be used this way by mages, with fire-breathers not being unheard of.
-   _Corgi Quest_ has a somewhat unconventional example: Puffington's breath makes the target deliriously happy. She is a faerie dragon, after all.
-   _Deadendia_: In Issue 2, Courtney uses this on a cowboy named Murdoch.
-   _Dragon City_: The dragons have vestigial venom sacs in their throats that produce flammable venom. They're usually removed as hatchlings and the one time Erin uses hers they burn her throat and render her mute for weeks.
-   _El Goonish Shive_:
    -   Fire summons and the Bulldog Dragon are capable of shooting fireballs from their mouths
    -   As shown in _Dragon Goo_: Omega Goo could straight up breath fire from one of its many mouths.
-   _Erfworld_: Dwagons. The red, green, blue, purple, and brown ones have normal elemental breath weapons (fire, poison gas, lightning, sonic blast, and smoke respectively) while pink ones _breathe pink bubbles that smother enemies_. Yellow ones invert the trope by having _massive_ bowel movements.

-   _Rival Angels_ is a webcomic set in a 'verse where Pro Wrestling Is Real. Not surprisingly, one character is known to use the Asian Mist attack described under Professional Wrestling above.
-   _Schlock Mercenary_:
    -   For a time, the Toughs' flagship is named _Broken Wind_, which due to the religious symbology of the culture they got it from, could also have been translated as "Angry God." Later, an ambassador dislikes it; "wind" lacks the proper spiritual aspect as it does in the original language, and "broken" isn't destructive enough. He suggests an alternative: _Breath Weapon_. When it's reclaimed by its original pilot from millions of years ago, the original term is a Name That Unfolds Like Lotus Blossom...but, conveniently, it is close enough to _Breath Weapon_ that the name is allowed to stick.
    -   Tagon gets an upgraded _Dragon_\-class cruiser with a main gun that shoots a powerful beam of plasma at short range.
        
        **Murtaugh:** My ship is keeping the name _Breath Weapon_. You can't have it.
        
    -   Schlock stores his plasgun in his mouth, and has been known to fake this trope by firing it without taking it out first.
-   _Slack Wyrm_: The two dragons (fire drakes) featured there, Ferragus and his sister Hildegard, breathe fire.

-   _Kaeloo_: Bad Kaeloo can breathe out blasts of air that can send people flying.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   Dragons breathe fire, of course, but Spike's fire has some pretty unusual properties. Scrolls consumed by his (green) fire breath are teleported to Princess Celestia, and she can send mail back in the form of an involuntary belch of Spike's fire. Dragonfire also seems to come in unique colors for each individual — besides Spike's green flames, Ember's fire is a hot magenta, Smolder's is yellow with a nested pink-and-blue core, and Sludge's is magenta with a yellow core.
    -   Chimeras, much like in Classical Mythology, are also capable of breathing fire.

    Real Life 

-   Fire-breathing is a trivial feat in reality, but strongly associated with tooth decay. Many traditional fire-breathers use gasoline or kerosene, which even diluted causes instant halitosis and rapidly rots the teeth. High proof alcohols (150+) are better; though they can cause notable browning within a week of regular performance, the damage is reversible with more frequent brushing and taking time for the enamel to recover.
-   Meet Giant Torayan. To quote the website: "This GIANT TORATAN doll is the ultimate child's weapon, as it sings, dances, breathes fire, and follows only those orders given by children." Thank you Japan, for bringing the world one step closer to the robot apocalypse.
-   Spitting cobras spray their venom at animals they perceive as threats by squeezing it out of their fangs, as end of the venom groove points forward. Despite some species appearing to exhale as they do so, there's no evidence to show that this has any affect on the range or accuracy of the attack.
-   Archer fish use their _literal_ breath - at least, the water they also use as an oxygen-source - as a projectile, knocking insect prey off overhanging branches with squirts of water.
