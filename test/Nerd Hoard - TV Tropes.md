The Monarch is disappointed to learn that Henchman 21's "weapons stash" is really a Nerd Hoard.

_I got a Dungeon Master's Guide.  
I got a twelve-sided die.  
I got Kitty Pryde, and Nightcrawler too.  
Waiting there for me, yes I do._

— Weezer, "In the Garage"

A common trait among nerds, Geeks, and Otaku is collecting items related to their hobbies/interests and often displaying the collection somewhere in their home. The size, extent, and condition of these prized items can often communicate quite a bit about the collectors themselves—their interests, maturity level, organizational skills, wealth (most of these collections are _not cheap_...), etc. It can also serve to reveal that a character not otherwise seen as nerdy/geeky is in fact a huge Closet Geek.

A common scenario has the collector showing off their collection (happily or begrudgingly), at which point a number of plots can kick off, such as the person accidentally damaging an item (opening a "Mint-In-Box" item thus destroying its value is common), mocking the collector for what they collect, "geeking out" themselves over the collection (which may end up as a Geeky Turn-On in a love interest situation), and many more.

While items from Stereotypically Nerdy hobbies part of the usual Geek Reference Pool (comic books, anime/manga, video games, sci-fi works, collectible cards, etc.) are the most common components of such a hoard, this trope can cover collections of children's toys, girly items, and even more typically "cool" things (cars, weapons, antiques, etc.) as long as the collector in question "geeks out" over having them and/or showing them off.

A Hacker Cave and Poster-Gallery Bedroom are common places to see such a collection. A Loony Fan is a common character type to create one of these. Compare/contrast The Collector, as these collections are typically formed without evil intent. See also Collector of the Strange and Kitsch Collection, which may be similarly displayed and treasured, but have significantly different makeups. Contrast the Porn Stash, which is a collection most want to keep hidden.

Truth in Television, naturally.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Case Closed_: Takagi strongly suggests that Inspector Chiba's room is FULL of character figurines and models. The cast gets to see it in File 450 when a case happens at Chiba's house: almost every exposed surface in the living room has figurines or other merchandise, mostly superhero and kaiju-related. Naturally, the detective boys love it.

-   _My Hero Academia_: All of Deku's classmates know that he is a massive fanboy of All Might. When it comes time for the class to move into their dorm rooms, absolutely nobody is surprised to see that he decorated his room with All Might posters and figurines. Deku is still a little embarrassed that he allows himself to show it off though.
-   This is the nature of the Zacharis dossier in _SPY×FAMILY_'s Campbelldon Tennis arc: his collection of theatre starlet photos. He's a fan of musical theatres and their actresses<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , but his wife is disgusted with this hobby of his (which is justified, given he's at least middle-aged and is a prominent government official) and ordered him to throw away his collection, which he responded by hiding the stash with the archives of the Ostanian intelligence, ending up causing a rumour that it contains material that would restart a war.

    Comic Books

He basically geeks out over his own toy line.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The 40-Year-Old Virgin_: Andy has an absolutely massive collection of "mint-in-box" action figures from pretty much all of the major Geek Reference Pool works adorning most of his apartment.

She later talks him into to selling some of his collection online, revealing it to be worth tens of thousands of dollars.
-   _Batman Forever_: Bruce shows Dick his vintage car and motorcycle collection. It's done in an offhand way (suggesting Dick fill up his motorcycle with gas before heading off). It even has a classic geeky exchange "Only ten of these were made!" "I have another one right here."
-   The protagonist of _The Best Offer_ has a Secret Room in his apartment filled with priceless paintings of women. He often just sits there for hours, admiring these works of art. All paintings get stolen in a heist though.

-   A episode of _Psych_ has Shawn and Gus call upon the expertise of a UFO expert and old geekbuddy of theirs, played by Freddie Prinze Jr., who has done a lot in his life to live down being a geek and pretends to be into sports to appease his very attractive wife.
