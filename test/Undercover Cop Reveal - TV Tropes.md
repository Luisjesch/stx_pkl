At its simplest form, a character reveals himself to be an undercover police officer, FBI agent, what have you. Often, he's acting as The Mole, trying to get enough evidence on the villain to arrest him for Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking. It's entirely possible that we, the viewers, won't find out until the rest of the characters do as well. Depending on what side of the Sliding Scale of Idealism Versus Cynicism, this may or may not end badly for the cop.

Subtrope of The Reveal. Closely related to The Infiltration, which involves a law enforcement officer pretending to be a criminal in order to join/infiltrate the bad guys' organization. Compare Booked Full of Mooks. Contrast Can Always Spot a Cop, where police officers are too obvious to ever get very far in their efforts to go undercover. Compare and contrast Must State If You're a Cop where a police officer is forced to do this by someone else.
