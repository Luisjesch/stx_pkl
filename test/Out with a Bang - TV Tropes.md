"I never thought I'd die this way... but I'd always _really hoped_!"

_"O'Grady, he was eighty, though his bride was just a pup,  
He died upon the honeymoon when she got his Irish up"_

— **Da Vinci's Notebook**, "Another Irish Drinking Song"

When a character dies in the very act of sexual intercourse, to the shock, embarrassment, or mortification of the still-living partner. In many cases, the cause of death is a heart attack or stroke — which is generally Played for Laughs. If the moment was particularly heated, the character may also Go Out with a Smile.

Alternatively, someone may be killed through other means during sex. If it's murder, then the killer may do it to get their jollies, or because that's when the victim is particularly vulnerable.

The expected outcome for a Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex scenario. Contrast Mate or Die, where the character must have sex to live, and Pre-Climax Climax where the likelihood of death encourages sex. If death is averted, expect Glad-to-Be-Alive Sex instead. Both Making Love in All the Wrong Places and being Overcome with Desire could lead to this if the couple were particularly careless about the circumstances in which they make love. This trope can also be a result of Lust Makes You Dumb, where a character's libido leads them to making stupid decisions.

Not to be confused with a person blowing themselves up, or with people deciding to make their demise a memorable one. This should also not be confused with Sex Signals Death, where sex is a method of foreshadowing death rather than causing it directly. Also not the same as Coming and Going; although that also juxtaposes sex and death, the people involved don't have to be the same people.

Truth in Television for some people, although the chances of someone dying naturally during sex are very low, unless there are already some serious medical issues, usually pulmonary, cardiac, or blood pressure-related, usually due to age. Also true for some animal species, most notoriously drone bees, whose genitalia literally _explode_ inside the queen bee during mating, and octopi, who both die in relatively quick succession - the male from rapidly going senile and either dying of aging or from being eaten by a predator, and the female from slowly starving to death while protecting the eggs.

May happen to those who sleep together with a Shady Lady of the Night.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Afro Samurai_, Okikku attempts to invoke this trope on Afro by killing him during sex with a blade disguised as a hairpin, but she undergoes a Sex–Face Turn instead. She is killed soon afterward by her former bosses for her betrayal after revealing to Afro that she is his childhood friend Otsuru and briefly fighting alongside him.
-   _Ayakashi Triangle_: A curse the Gogyosen meant to kill Suzu instead ends up inside Matsuri—specifically, the male half of him that splits off. Their plan then becomes to take control of the male Matsuri, have him seduce Suzu, and transfer the curse into her through sex.
    
    **Shadow Mei**: _(imaginging Suzu mid-coitus)_ By literally defiling the ayakashi medium, they could activate it... the god-killing curse!
    
-   _Basilisk_:
    -   It has Kagerou, a female ninja "blessed" with the ninja skill of having her breath turn into instant-death poison when she's aroused. The results of this are seen a bunch of times, too. You'd think it obvious that raping a ninja lady is not a good idea. Too bad the guy who DOES rape her is... well, _immortal_.
    -   _Basilisk_ also had Okoi, a ninja who pulled her opponents' blood out of their bodies via skin contact. Guess what her favorite method of getting close enough is.
-   In the _Battle Royale_ manga, Mitsuko Souma forces herself on already-dying Yuichiro Takiguchi, because she thinks it will "make him better". She stabs him to death out of frustration when it doesn't. This is not played for laughs. At all.
-   The very first demon we meet in _Berserk_ takes the form of a beautiful naked woman who lures men into sex with her so that she can transform into her true form and eat them alive. She is killed by Guts in the very first scene of the manga when she tries this on him and gets her brains blown out the back of her head with his Arm Cannon. But during the Eclipse, we get to see this Apostle in action when she eats Corkus alive.
-   In _Bleach_, Bambietta Basterbine will sometimes call a subordinate to her room under the pretense of sex, but the encounters always end up with her killing them, with it being ambiguous as to whether anything actually happens in-between. Her friends complain, but she doesn't care.
-   In _Blood+_, Diva's rape of Riku is implied to have either directly caused his death (through the... fluid transference) or directly preceded her killing him by giving him her blood.
-   _Demon Beast Invasion_ begins with a demon having sex with a woman until she explodes.
-   Similarly yet again, this is the point of the 'Poison Princesses" in _Dokuhime_. Their poison-exporting kingdom uses them to get rid of troublesome political opponents.
-   _Don't Meddle with My Daughter!_:
    -   Played for laughs in chapter 2, when the giant plant monster makes the mistake of raping _Athena._ Her immense strength, combined with her pent-up libido, made her cum hard enough that the plant monster couldn't contain the energy from it; causing it to explode!
    -   The alien parasite doesn't fare much better, in the _"Amazing Eighth Wonder Vol.1"_. It possessed Clara so it could feed off of her pent-up sexual urges. But it winds up getting caught in the middle of a two-woman orgy between Clara and her mother. During which, Clara uses speed clones to gangbang her all at once. The combined energy released from their orgasms reduces the parasite to a shriveled husk.
-   In the second chapter of _Franken Fran_, Fran heals a crippled girl by making her part insect. When she goes to a love hotel with her new boyfriend after her convalescence is over, she instinctively eats her mate.
-   In _GTO: The Early Years_, Makoto claims that last year's car race winner, Masao, died from too much sex (3 girls every night for a month), and he looked like a (very happy) mummy when they buried him. In the next panel, Eikichi and Ryuji completely miss the point and declare that they're going to win this year. In the background, another student is handing Makoto some money, implying it was just a bet to see if he could get them to believe such a ridiculous story.
-   Narrowly averted in episode 4 of the anime adaptation of _Interspecies Reviewers_. The reviewers enter a room full of Lilim despite being warned, with Crim sitting it out. Zel casts stat buff spells on himself, Stunk, and Brooz beforehand, but the buffs expire half an hour later, with the reviewers only being saved from death by exhaustion by the arrival of a "Raid Party" consisting of 100 orcs, who demand a "rematch" with the Lilim. Stunk gives the Lilim a 1 out of 10 in his review, while Zel and Brooz give them a 0. Furthermore, as mentioned by the narration, it takes the three of them 3 weeks to recover from the ordeal.
-   In _Isuca_, the demons pleasure their victims to ecstasy while fatally draining their life force.
-   In episode 2 of _Kaiba_, a woman has intense sex with Kaiba's body, into which she has copied her memories. The ominously heightening experience, coupled with thoughts of her father, results in an explosion, covering the entire room with what appears to be green blood.
-   _Maken-ki!_: In chapter 111, Love Espada is confronted by apparitions of high school students who call her a whore for always tempting them with her body, yet never allowing them to screw her. So she gives them what they want. But her sex appeal and her libido are both so _unbelievably high_, that they only manage to last a few minutes before each of them blows their loads and dissipates. Espada is left disappointed, but still horny.
-   _Monster Musume_ has poor Kimihito avoiding his charges for one chapter—mostly because they're riled up by the full-moon, a sudden annulment of the "No having sex with extra-species" rule, and have little to no self-control at the moment.
-   A PG variant of this appeared in _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ after the World Tree causes Nodoka's request for a kiss from Negi to turn him into a kissing-obsessed Determinator. Asuna is quick to point out that if he actually kissed anyone in that state, they could die due to suffocation. When Negi finally ends up kissing _her_, she actually faints before the magic wears off and he turns back to normal.

-   In the _Ninja Scroll_ movie, the ninja Kagero is the poison tester for a feudal lord because her body is immune to poison. Unfortunately, the immunity is because her body absorbs poisons instead of processing them, and as a result, her bodily fluids are so toxic that even kissing her is a death sentence for the other person. Tessai finds this out the hard way when, after kissing her (and then going further) his stone form's invulnerability becomes compromised. Subverted later on, when she and Jubei learn that them having sex would be the antidote to Jubei's poisoned state.
-   In _The Seven Deadly Sins_, Nadja's heart disease was worsening, so she decided to spare herself a slow and bedridden death by seducing her Love Interest. Unfortunately, she did not tell _him_ that, which led to Gowther panicking and being falsely imprisoned for rape.
-   The infamous "goosh goosh" scene in _Tokyo Tribe_, in which Buppa rapes a young man so violently that he gets _split in half_.
-   Discussed early on in _Undead Unluck_. After a kiss on the cheek by Fuuko causes her Unluck power to drop a giant meteor, Death Seeker Andy theorizes what sex would lead to. Fuuko is quick to shoot down the idea: since how effective Unluck is depends on how much Fuuko likes the target, Andy would only get crappy results forever if he tried to force himself upon her, causing Andy to wisely change his mind.
-   At one point in the yaoi manga _Under Grand Hotel_ Swordfish has sex with Sen to the point where Sen would have _died_ if Swordfish wasn't stopped by guards.

-   _Urotsukidoji_ is infamous for its graphic depictions of violence against women, especially during sex scenes, where the victims are often raped, then killed. The only exceptions were its two female leads, Akemi and Megumi. Both are raped several times during the series, but they're the only ones to be spared afterward.
-   The Three Sisters in the first _Vampire Hunter D_ novel kills its victims this way. (No, that's not a typo.) They use the demonic power of their hair to consume their victims with pleasure, then they consume the pleasure, then they consume the victims.

    Comedy 

-   Bill Hicks had a bit where he talks about his ex-girlfriend, and how he fantasizes that one day, she'll be having sex with her morbidly obese, abusive husband, and he'll die mid-coitus, right on top of her, slowly crushing her to death, and bile and blood and tobacco-laced saliva will spew out of his mouth into her face, and just before she drowns, she turns her head to the TV, "...and I'm gonna be on it!"
-   One of Whoopi Goldberg's popular characters from _On Broadway_ was a Jamaican woman who travels back to America with a rich old man she refers to as "the Old Raisin". He dies after having sex with her, and she shrugs, "You know, they come and they go." However, she realizes she had developed feelings for him, calling him a "remarkable man" who "liked to give people adventure". Fortunately, she inherits his entire estate of $40 million.
-   Richard Pryor claimed that this is how his father checked out; "My father came and went at the same time". He also said in one routine that it's how he wanted to go if they were ever going to do World War III: "If they launch, we'll get told you got half an hour to get out. Half an hour? That ain't enough _time._ Everyone clogging up the road; you ain't getting no-place! Me, I know a woman I been wanting to be with for ten years... I would _RUN_ over to her house; I'd say "baby (pant) we got fifteen, (pant) fifteen minutes!" And hope I get a nut just as the bomb go off!"
-   In his third _Evening With..._ DVD, Kevin Smith talks about the requirements for being canonized and says it helps to die in the name of God, which means you could be in the middle of coitus, and suddenly clutch your chest and cry out "Jesus!" and you'd be "Saint Nutsdeep, Patron Saint of Dying While Fucking".

    Comic Books 

-   _The Authority: Revolution_: Issue #9 reveals that the Doctor was murdered by the new Rose Tattoo during sex. Her poisonous bodily fluids entered his bloodstream and made it seem like he had died of a drug overdose.
-   The Host of _The Darkness_ dies if they conceive a child, and the Darkness _will_ make sure he does if he ever has sex. There are loopholes, however.
-   In _God Is Dead_, a new goddess, the crimson-skinned goat-legged Gaia, distractedly announces to her female acolytes "Yes, yes, tell my followers I love them. Now... I need a man." In the next issue, a man is on her bed, and she is seen sliding onto the bed with him. Elsewhere in her fortress, two women are talking, and the man's screams are heard. One woman looks up and casually says "The goddess will require new bedsheets." After events elsewhere, cut back to the entrance to Gaia's bedchambers, as two women are carrying the old bedsheets between them with the unfortunate man's dismembered limbs sticking out.
-   _Gold Digger_:
    -   Issue #220 has Madrid running afoul of an exiled Amazon Breeder who devised a spell that would suck nine months of vitality from her lovers and transfer it to a fertilized zygote, allowing her to give birth to a fully developed baby almost immediately after getting pregnant. Problem was, the spell would eventually glitch, and instead of taking nine months, would take _nine hundred years_ from the unfortunate paramours. The fact that she seemed to have no problem with that is one of the reasons she got exiled.
    -   A later episode had Gina and Brianna's respective boyfriends with the otherwise-enviable position of studying a tribe with an extreme size difference between genders; exposure to a magical field made men grow to a good eight or nine feet tall, but the women more like forty to fifty feet. Zan rather worriedly notes that despite their superhuman strength and toughness, the men of the tribe still get _very_ nervous at the prospect of mating with their wives. The "worried" part, of course, comes from the fact that the single women of the village find the two of them _very_ cute, the pheromones given off by nervous or frightened men is considered a turn-on to them, and one of them in particular is having a little trouble with the concept of "no"...
-   One _Hellblazer_ storyline's Big Bad is the act of rape made flesh. In the climax, said rape demon sodomizes a man to death. The poor guy _bursts_.
-   A gruesome example in _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_: Edward Hyde rapes Hawley "The Invisible Man" Griffin to death.
-   In _Lori Lovecraft: Back to the Garden_, two demons use Danke Schoen as a portal through which to enter the mortal realm. The process creates an intense, orgasmic sensation that overwhelms and destroys the target vessel. The demons note that most humans are killed in a few minutes — Dirty Old Woman Danke holds out for two hours.
-   This seems to be a major problem for Elizabeth Hawkesmoore in _Nikolai Dante_ — modern army men have no staying power.
-   The "Little Deaths" storyline of _Powers_ focuses on the police investigation of a philandering Superman Substitute who died at the climax of sex with one of his (many) lovers. In a rather tragic twist on the matter, his secret identity was married and his secret wife, upon being bombarded with the news of how her husband lost his life, kills herself.
-   _Purgatori_: The vampire Jade prefers to have sex with her male victims before draining them of their lifeforce.
-   Common in the _Ramba_ comic series (which is about a hit-woman who frequently uses sex as a weapon to reach her targets). Two particularly disturbing incidences (from the same two-part story) are a woman being raped to death by a man with a blade attached to his penis, and a woman being drowned in semen.
-   _Raptors_: Sex with vampires is very dangerous for humans. Aznar ends up killing his girlfriend Sylvia when his vampire side awakens and he drains her dry, and Vicky nearly dies of exhaustion after being shared on the bed by the Molina twins.
-   _Sabretooth_ has been shown & stated to occasionally kill his sex partners. In one quick instance, we see him lying in bed with a woman, who appears to be sleeping. When we see a close-up, it's clear she's dead and not from natural causes.
-   In _The Sandman (1989)_, a minor Running Gag is the thought of going out "between two nubile virgins, crushed by an elephant at the moment of ecstasy". In Death's story in the anthology _Endless Nights_, someone actually pulls this off (ringing a bell to cue the elephant, if you were wondering) and lives to tell about it, thanks to some Alchemical Phlebotinum that sticks a small island in a sort of "Groundhog Day" Loop.
-   _The Simping Detective_ had this happen to a number of the Boss' Mooks. It turns out that Bob was injecting alien prostitutes with a substance called Jazzalite, explodes violently upon contact with semen. His ultimate plan is to inject the Boss' new wife, Innocence, with the stuff and let nature take its course. It turns out that she's been having an affair with Colm "Shite" O'Leary and ends up killing him instead.
-   In _Spider-Man: Reign_, it's all but outright stated that Mary Jane dies from radiation poisoning and cancer derived at least partially from exposure to Peter's radioactive semen, thus forming a particularly slow-working example of this trope.
-   _Teen Titans_: Cinder of the fake Titans team put together by Deathstroke is a serial killer who hunts down rapists and sex offenders. Deathstroke first discovered her when she murdered one of his targets, a child molester, by having sex with him and causing her vagina to transform into a gout of flames in mid-coitus.
-   In _Tomorrow Stories_, Lapis Lazuli (whose body is composed of sapphire) murders her gangster lover by driving her diamond hard finger into his ear while they are having sex.
-   In _Wanted_, the Professor mentions killing his arch-nemesis by giving his lady friend a radioactive condom.
-   _The Wicked + The Divine_: The 455 special reveals that Attila the Hun dying on his wedding night was because he married the reincarnation of Inanna who killed him as they were consummating their marriage.
-   _Wolverine_: In the story arc "Get Mystique", Senator Ralph Miles Brickman is about to get it on with his favorite sex worker, Zahira. He asks if she would like to oblige him with "one of those funny positions"; she obliges by trapping his neck in the crook of her knee, strangling him. As he dies, she shape-shifts, revealing herself to be Mystique and she hisses "How was that? Was it GOOD FOR YOU?"

    Fan Works

-   In the Parody Fic _Captain Proton and the Planet of Lesbians_, Queen Sapphia threatens to inflict the "Death of a Thousand Sluts".
-   In _Divine Blood_ Aphrodite's last stand in words of one commentator:
    
    "Check me on this, please ... Aphrodite killed at least fifty rebel gods, and incapacitated not less than 250 others for, well, we can assume several days at least, one of whom is Zeus himself ... in a bedroom-Olympiad that ran over two days?"
    
-   In the comedic essay-fic, _Equestria: A History Revealed_, this is apparently the way the Equinus Republic fell, in an induced mass orgy between the ponies of parliament that devolved the nation into chaos. The author even makes a pun about it.
    
    And so the Equinus Republic went out not with a whimper, but with a bang. Several of them probably.
    
-   In _Hecatemus_ Dumbledore has a heart attack while having sex with a prostitute.
-   In "iFight Crime with Victorious", Beck and Jade are submitted to Unresolved Sexual Tension and when they attempt to resolve this, Beck's power inadvertently activates, igniting Jade and killing her.
-   _Kuso Miso Technique_'s Abe Takakazu in this fan video kills a guard by raping him. Which doesn't make much sense until later when it's shown all gay men have lightsaber swords for penises.
-   _League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Tempest Rewrite_: How Emma assassinates Jimmy.
-   _The Lost Cause_ features this fate for Jin Guangshan. Unlike in canon, it was the result of a consensual sexual encounter...and some poison to weaken his heart.
-   In _Seed of Death_, Zagreus died while giving Thanatos a blowjob, neither of them knowing that his ejaculate was basically poison. Given that Zagreus revived moments later, they take it in stride and resume their session, presumably taking Hypnos's advice to spit and not swallow. Zagreus even gives us this lovely feghoot.
    
    **Zagreus**: Death came, and I died.
    
-   In the _Touhou Project_ doujin _Though the Wind Cries_ a man who lost his entire family in the drought blames Suwako for it.

-   _Quiververse_: Changelings are treated as The Ageless in this universe, provided they have a steady supply of love and don't engage in sex. Chrysalis, never having engaged in the latter, is in the neighborhood of a thousand years old, though no other changelings are of similar age. Being Explosive Breeders keeps their population numbers up and balances things out, however.
-   _With Pearl and Ruby Glowing_: King Candy dies this way, as, after being arrested for molesting his adopted children, the corrupt cops assault him in prison, leading to his heart giving out due to his old age.

The resulting court case asks the penetrating (pun definitely intended) question of whether "sex was the murder weapon".
-   _Cabin Fever_ features a moment where the diva is convinced that there is no escape from the deadly disease going around. Rather than actually trying to flee the infected area, like most of her friends, she resigns herself to her fate and decides to spend her last minutes gettin' her freak on. Grabbing the nearest available man, she gets naked in the blink of an eye and rides the dude to her last moaning madness. She was in such a wild mood the guy didn't even have time to put on a rubber. Pity for him that it turned out she had the disease while they were doing the deed bareback. You could say he went out _from_ a bang.

-   _The Hidden_: While possessing the body of a stripper, Puppeteer Parasite\-like alien screws a man to death in the parking lot. It's a bit unclear exactly how this is done, as there were no obvious wounds on the victim, nor does the alien seem able to literally consume a person's life force.
-   In _Infernal Affairs II_, the capo "Gandhi" gets suffocated with a plastic bag by a "masseuse" when he's expecting a different kind of "happy ending".
-   _James Bond_:
    -   In _You Only Live Twice_ Bond is apparently killed thanks to a lethal combination of Murphy's Bed and a Chinese Femme Fatale. Two Hong Kong policeman race in and examine the body, but they're too late. Naturally, the event is lampshaded with the usual tongue-in-cheek Double Entendre. "At least he died on the job. He'd have wanted it this way."
    -   Xenia Onatopp in _GoldenEye_ murders a Canadian naval officer by strangling him with her legs during the act. 007 later finds the officer's corpse still wearing a _huge_ smile on its face. To quote _Empire Magazine_:

-   Played for Drama in _Red Sparrow_:
    -   A nonfatal example early in the film when Uncle Vanya gives Dominika information that the stage accident that broke her leg and ended her career wasn't an accident: the danseur she was partnered with flubbed the move on purpose because he was sleeping with Dominika's understudy.

As quietly as she can, she picks up his elephant gun and lets her have it in the back of her head. Just so happens they were climaxing at the same time too, making this a twofer for the unlucky gal. She then proceeds to flip the hell out and rampage across Germany Mrs. Voorhees style, killing anyone she sees 'doing the deed' or just having done it. For less of a bang but still a bang, she executes a couple of other women with electrified dildos.
-   _Scott Pilgrim vs. The World_ has an unusual take on this trope. In the Scott/Ramona vs Roxie fight, Scott defeats Roxie by poking her in the back of the knee after Ramona tells him that it's her weak spot.

    Jokes 

-   An old joke, somewhat NSFW: Two people are having sex in the back of a car when the man suddenly has a heart attack whilst still joined with his partner. The woman freaks but can't get him off her; she nevertheless manages to summon help, who get the emergency services to come out. They determine that the only way to get him out of there is to take the roof off the car. The fire department saws the roof of the car and manages to get the guy out, and as the paramedics are taking him away a police officer tries to comfort the woman, who is sobbing hysterically. She says "Don't worry, your husband's going to be fine." The woman replies "Fuck him, he's not my husband. It's my husband's car, though."
-   An ambulance is called early one Sunday morning to the home of an elderly couple, and the paramedics find them both naked in bed - him dead, her weeping. When the paramedics ask what happened she explained: "Well my husband had a weak heart, but we both still wanted to have a sex life. So we'd only have sex once a week, timing our thrusts to the sound of the church bells to keep it slow.... _if only that_ _**fucking**_ _ice cream van hadn't come along!_"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Three nonagenarians are chatting.
    
    **Abe:** I see old Zachary died last night. That's how I'd like to go - suddenly in bed while I sleep.  
    **Bob:** You're right about suddenly, but that is way too boring. I want to die in a spectacular high-speed car crash.  
    **Charlie:** You both have it partly right. I want to die suddenly, spectacularly and in bed.  
    **Abe:** How does that work?  
    **Charlie:** I want to be shot dead by a jealous husband.
    
-   Two men exploring a jungle are captured by a native tribe. The two men are given a choice: Death, or Unga-Bunga. The first man chooses Unga-Bunga and is immediately raped by all the men of the tribe. After that, the second man chooses death as he prefers it to gang rape. The tribe leader declares "DEATH... BY UNGA-BUNGA!". Some versions of the joke instead have three men: the first chooses Unga-Bunga not knowing what it is, the second chooses it as he prefers it over death, and the third chooses death.
-   An undertaker is reminiscing about his career: "There was one time when I got a call from a brothel regarding one of their patrons, who seemed to have passed on after congress with one of the ladies working there. I picked up a body bag, a toe tag, collected my off-sider, and off we went to the cathouse. When we entered the room, my young lad noticed that the deceased had an erection. Well, he wasn't exactly polite, but I decided to use it as a teaching moment and said that this often happens. In fact, it could be used as a means of testing whether someone was truly dead or not. Saying so, I reached for the gentleman's member and firmly pulled on it. And... well, it turned out he wasn't dead at all."

    Literature 

-   In _Angels & Demons_, the assassin's _final_ atrocity was to be making the leading lady give him head and slitting her throat as he came. Foiled, thank God.
-   The Yeerks from _Animorphs_ die after mating. Actually, it's not so much "die" as "three Yeerks merge into one big blob and the blob breaks up into little baby Yeerks". Bizarre Alien Biology, indeed.
-   In _Apprentice Adept_, this is more or less how Agape's people, the Moebites, reproduce: when the mating urge occurs, two Moebites basically do a Fusion Dance and form a new Moebite. Since the process pretty much eliminates the personalities and memories of the parent Moebites, it's a case of "Mate and Die".
-   Lawrence Block novels:
    -   In _The Burglar Who Painted Like Mondrian_ this happened to Bernie's lawyer.
        
        **Ray:** He was bangin' his secretary on his office couch, same girl's been with him eight, ten years, and his ticker blows out on him. Massive whatchacallit, coronary, an' he's dead in the saddle. Girl said she tried everythin' to revive him, and I just bet she did.
        
    -   In _Here Comes a Hero_ Léon gives Evan a Belgian passport belonging to one Paul Mornay.
        
        **Léon:** It is genuine.  
        **Evan:** And M. Mornay?  
        **Léon:** M. Mornay has taken to bed one of the most energetic tarts in Montmartre.  
        **Evan:** From his picture, one would think it would kill him.  
        **Léon:** And so it did. At the critical moment, zut! The little death becomes the great one. Thus did his passport come upon the market, and thus one may rest assured that M. Mornay will not report its loss.
        
-   A particularly disgusting variation of this occurs in John Connolly's short story "The Cancer Cowboy Rides". Buddy Carson seduces a drunken waitress and has sex with her; however, on the second round, the waitress begins to feel the effects of Buddy's unique gift — _fast-acting cancer transmitted by touch_: tumours, black blood, and a slow and agonizing death that Buddy watches eagerly.
-   What happens to any Mortal who has — or tries to have — sex with a Caster or Incubus in _The Caster Chronicles_.

-   _Dragaera_: A strange aversion in the third _Vlad Taltos_ book, when the main character decides (for no good reason) to have sex with the female assassin who just killed him (he got better, evidently); later, thinking back, he notes that he was wondering whether she would kill him before they finished.

-   _The Dresden Files_:
    -   _Storm Front_ begins with Harry being called in to help investigate the deaths of two people who took this to the extreme—magic caused both of their hearts to explode messily out of their chests mid-coitus. Justified as Harry theorizes that the strong emotions during sex amplified the magic attack.
    -   White Court vampires feed on various emotions, and the Raith clan specifically prefer to feed on lust. They can and often do kill during sex, especially if they're particularly hungry and need to feed intensely.
    -   Lord Raith was such a boss White Court that he used to use this power as an opener at parties by _kissing_ someone to death, something that takes most of his kind the duration of sex, so minutes instead of seconds. Then Margaret LeFay McCoy neutered his demon and linked that curse to her bloodline, so as long as Harry and Thomas are around, Papa Raith can't Feed and therefore can't do this. He also doesn't have much access to any of his other vampire powers since he can't feed to refresh them.
    -   In _White Night_, Molly gets to re-experience someone's 'out with a bang moment' thanks to a White Court vampire. This makes things very awkward for Butters and Dresden who were watching, expecting pain and despair rather than an orgasm.
        
        **Butters:** Is she above age?  
        **Dresden:** Um, yes.  
        **Butters:** Good. Now I don't feel quite so Nabokovian.  
        _\[Cue comments about needing to get out more.\]_
        
    -   In _Cold Days_, Harry reveals that he considered asking Lara Raith for this if Kincaid refused to kill him.
        
        I mean, hey, if you're going to go, there are worse ways to do it than to be taken out by the freaking queen of the world's succubi.
        
    -   After witnessing a... rather unpleasant death, Injun Joe remarks that he'd rather go in his sleep. Harry, on the other hand...<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

-   In the _Forgotten Realms_ novel _Daughter of the Drow_ by Elaine Cunningham, female-on-male murder during sex is called "the spider's kiss" among the drow (in reference to their spider goddess Lolth, among other spidery things in their culture).

-   The Soft Ones in _The Gods Themselves_ reproduce by "melting", an extended period of time in which they physically merge with their other two partners. Afterward, one of them gives birth. The children's sexes always occur in a specified order, and all the members of the triad die after the birth of the third child. Subverted because we eventually discover (along with the viewpoint Soft Ones themselves) that they don't actually die, they permanently merge and become a "Hard One", which up until now the Soft Ones and the reader have been led to believe is a different race. This also occurs temporarily during the other meldings, though the Soft Ones retain no memories of this.
-   In _Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation: Mo Dao Zu Shi_ and its subsequent adaptations including _The Untamed_, Sect Leader Jin Guangshan is killed this way when one of his many bastard children has finally had enough of his ill treatment, drugs him, and orders a dozen prostitutes to keep servicing him until his weakening heart gives out. No one figures out it was murder for over a decade because he was so notorious as a womanizer that everyone figured it was _inevitable_ he'd eventually be found dead in bed with a woman.

-   In _Like Water for Chocolate_, Tita's lover Pedro literally dies at the climax, due to a sudden heart attack.

-   _Mademoiselle Boleyn_ has Mary Tudor be free of the aged king of France when he dies as they have sex.
-   "Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex", an article by Larry Niven explaining — in _very_ close detail — exactly why Superman could never have a Superboy and why this trope would be the likely outcome of any mating with Lois Lane or other non-Kryptonian females. (This appears to have been totally ignored by the modern-day DC Comics, which has established Clark and Lois as a married couple who, presumably, have a non-lethal sex life.)
    
    With Kryptonian muscles behind it, Kal-El's semen would emerge with the muzzle velocity of a machine gun bullet.
    
-   _Orthogonal_ plays this _universally_ and chillingly straight: For the protagonist race, sex triggers immediate reproduction, which consists of the mother fissioning into four children. It's a necessary part of biology... and also murder.
-   In _Rainbow Six_, part of the villains' testing of their lethal-if-not-vaccinated biological agent involves getting uninfected captives to have sex with infected ones while both sides are drugged. True to form, said virus can be spread by intercourse.

-   Setup for Chuck Palahniuk's _Snuff_: An aging porn star is shooting a world-record gangbang and may or may not die at the end of it. A lot of the book is other characters arguing about whether this result is intentional and/or inevitable. The actual ending manages to be much more embarrassing.

        **Sansa:** That must have been dreadful, my lady. Him dying. _There_, I mean, whilst... whilst he was...  
        **Myranda:** Fucking me? It was disconcerting, certainly. Not to mention discourteous.
        
    -   Also discussed by Tyrion, who, when asked how he wishes to die, replies, "At the age of 80, in my own bed, with a girl's mouth around my cock."
    -   While it doesn't need to be fatal, Melisandre is implied to drain the life out of people she has sex with and use it to fuel her magic. After doing so twice with Stannis, she says she can't do it again lest she kill him.
    -   Given that author George R. R. Martin has created an extensive fictional history for his story, it's not surprising that this shows up in historical contexts. Lord Ossifer Plumm was an old man when he married young, nubile Princess Elaena Targaryen of the royal house. Apparently, this trope was the result. By great good fortune, his single interaction with his bride left her Someone to Remember Him By, and young Viserys Plumm inherited the lands and title upon his birth. However, rumors dogged Lady Elaena that Viserys had been conceived too late. One suspect was the current king, Aegon, the Fourth of his Name — called "Aegon the Unworthy" because he Really Got Around (amongst numerous and sundry other flaws). Another, only a little more outlandish, was that Ossifer Plumm had impregnated his bride from beyond the grave, from six feet under. This becomes a Brick Joke over a hundred years later when Princess Classic Daenerys Targaryen meets one of Plumm's descendents, Brown Ben Plumm, now an exile leading Private Military Contractors on the other continent. He explains that a Targaryen married his ancestor because said ancestor "had himself a cock six foot long."

-   _Split Heirs_: Ludmilla, who was in her seventies or so, died while having sex with Odo when she climaxed.
-   For a nonlethal variation, the novelization of _Star Trek: The Motion Picture_ gives this as one of the reasons Deltans who enter Starfleet swear an oath of celibacy. Because Deltan sex involves a merging of minds as well as bodies, a non-Deltan who sleeps with one risks insanity by doing so. Captain Willard Decker enters into a relationship with Lieutenant Ilia knowing full well the risk.
-   At the beginning of the _Star Trek: New Frontier_ series, the Vulcan Selar is consummating her Pon farr with her mate when he dies. This merely delays the Pon farr for a little while. She eventually consummates with Burgoyne, the hermaphrodite engineer.
-   In the _Star Wars Expanded Universe_, it's revealed that the H'nemthe have evolved (naturally or socially, it's not clear) this trait due to their 20 males to 1 female gender ratio. The females, who are otherwise vegetarians, eviscerate their partners after sex with their razor-edged tongue and they sincerely believe this is actually the greatest expression of love between the sexes. One of the short stories in _Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina_ revolves around an alien Corrupt Bureaucrat named Feltipern Trevaag wooing and having sex with the alien identified in the movies only as "Yamnose", here revealed to be a female H'nemthe named M'iiyoom Onith. When the inevitable happens, the folks who clean up the mess consider Trevaag to have truly been Too Dumb to Live, not only for trying to sleep with a female H'nemthe but for not realizing the Genius Bilingual Bonus in her name; "M'iiyoom" is the H'nemthe word for "Nightlily", a beautiful but carnivorous flower that uses its sweet scent to attract prey.
-   Gene Wolfe's "There are Doors" features an alternate Earth where humans have a very different reproductive cycle; after sex, women store men's semen in their body for the rest of their life and can use it to have as many children as they wish. Men die, as their immune system shuts down.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Featured, not surprisingly, in _1000 Ways to Die_:
    -   A _very_ shy Japanese couple who were very much in love, but restrained themselves from even kissing each other for the 7 years of their marriage so far decide one day to consummate it with the help of some plum wine. As the couple simultaneously climaxes, their bodies weren't used to the exertion, and after passing out, the two die peacefully in their sleep from their hearts stopping.
    -   In another episode, a man with a fetish for overweight women ended up dying by suffocation when his date for the night climaxed and then passed out from exhaustion on top of him, preventing his lungs from expanding and covering his face with her fat rolls. He doesn't seem too displeased. Her reaction when she awoke was disappointed, but oddly not that surprised.
    -   A subversion in "Sex Ray", where the victim didn't die during sex, but because two others were Making Love in All the Wrong Places. A man in for a routine head X-ray gets a front row seat to his X-ray technician getting it on with a nurse in the control room, which he doesn't seem too bothered by. Unfortunately, the patient has his brain fried by repeated X-rays as the nurse kept hitting the button to turn the machine on with her backside.
    -   A cheating sleaze is bitten by a spider, whose venom acts like Viagra during his final hours. Trying to relieve himself of the... _tension_, he goes through a series of his girls until finally collapsing dead with one.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   And there was one about a virgin who went to a Nevada brothel, signed on with a Dominatrix for the night... but it turned out he had a severe allergy to latex. That he was completely dressed in (including a zipper over the mouth).
    -   Another cheater was inadvertently given nine times the recommended dose of Viagra - his wife snuck him three, he took three before he went to see his mistress, **and** she slipped him three. Needless to say, it was fatal.
    -   A couple likes to do it out in the open. They have sex on top of an old and malfunctioning electrical transformer. The dude had just gotten a "Prince Albert" cock piercing, and once it touches the transformer... BZZZZZZT! He gets electrocuted to death. (The girl lives, but only because her feet weren't touching the ground, thus not completing the circuit.)
-   In an episode of _3rd Rock from the Sun_, Sally and Harry were trying to kill an overweight fortune teller they thought knew they were aliens. Eventually, they asked her how she foresaw her own death and she replied that she would be killed having sex.
    
    **Fortune teller**: Not a bad way to die, right?  
    **Sally**: No... but a _horrible_ way to kill. _Right, Harry?_  
    _\[Harry has an Oh, Crap! expression on his face\]_
    
-   _American Gods (2017)_: Shadow's wife Laura died while giving a blowjob to another man (he was driving at the time, and they crashed). Bilquis also devours people while having sex with them.
-   In _American Horror Story: Coven_, we have Girl Next Door Zoe, who has a magical vagina that kills anyone she has sex with.

-   The _Angel_ episode "Lonely Hearts" has a parasitic demon that keeps a constant stream of hosts by emerging from the current one and, er, "penetrating" a partner during sex, killing them and coming to rest in their body. Not during, after. While cuddling.
-   In _Anything But Love_, it happens to a guy Jamie Lee Curtis' character is dating. She later recalls him saying "Omigod, not yet!" but thought he meant something else.
-   _Babes in the Wood_: Caralyn fears that she bonked a man to death in the second episode of Series 2. Charlie is worried when he finds that this sex partner of Caralyn was the same age as him and fears that he'll befall this fate, whilst Frankie implies that this has happened to her before. At the end of the episode, Caralyn finds that the man had a weak heart and is thus convinced that she didn't do it, whilst it is heavily implied that Charlie killed his own partner in sex.
-   _Being Human (UK)_: Succubi and Incubi inflict death on any human they have intercourse with. The succubus Yvonne killed the only man she ever loved in this manner, due to being completely unaware of her own nature, and has been living a sexless life ever since due to the trauma it caused her.
-   One sketch in _The Benny Hill Show_, Benny Hill sings about a guy who died this way. He notes it took the coroner a week to get the grin off his face... and two more days to close the coffin.

    **Buffy & Riley:** Yup, oh yeah, terrible...
    
-   One episode of _Caroline in the City_ had Caroline help Richard fake his death to make his art more valuable and to get back at an art critic. They even arrange a fake funeral, and Richard manages to stay convincingly dead through a harangue by the critic who didn't buy his act, but just as he starts apologizing for his behaviour at the funeral, he mentions how Richard died. Caroline had been telling everyone he died this way with her, and the shock/outrage causes Richard to blow his cover.
-   In one episode of _Cheers_, an elderly woman who Sam hired as a waitress (ironically because Carla didn't want him to hire someone who he would fall for like he did with Diane) claimed that _all three_ of her former husbands died this way. Both she and her daughter believed that it was because she was too passionate.
    
    **Sam:** I don't mean to beat this to death, but were they... smiling?  
    **Lillian:** From ear to ear! And _that_ was the grumpy one!
    
-   Subverted and then played straight in an episode of _Chicago Hope_. A man has a very bad blockage in his heart and shows up to get surgery. It turns out the doctor is an old flame of his. He doesn't tell her about his heart condition, instead acting like the only reason he's come to town is to see her. (Which isn't entirely a lie. It was really both reasons). They end up having sex and he has a heart attack during it. He actually lives for a while afterward since the doctor took the necessary steps to preserve his life and got him into surgery immediately. But while in recovery, his wife shows up. He wakes up to see his wife and the doctor together and instantly assumes that the doctor felt guilty (she didn't know he was married) and told the wife about his infidelity. The panic causes him to have ANOTHER heart attack, which kills him.
-   _CSI_:
    -   Forms the basis of the plot of at least one episode, with rather roundabout complications. The main suspect, a very overweight woman, accidentally suffocates her partner when she passes out drunk on top of him. The woman actually told the police that she smothered him with a pillow because she said she would rather confess to murder than suffer through the jokes that would be made about her because of the true nature of the victim's death. Believe it or not, the show handled this with a degree of sensitivity.
    -   And then there was the guy who fell off a hotel balcony while having sex on the railing... The woman claimed that he raped her and that she accidentally pushed him off the balcony. She was married and didn't want her infidelity to become known.
-   _CSI: NY_: In "Enough", one Victim of the Week is shot in the head while having sex with a prostitute in the back of his car. The prostitute then pushes his body out and steals his car.
-   This is how Kemal Pamuk dies on _Downton Abbey_. Awkwardness, drama, and Disposing of a Body ensue.
-   In _The Dresden Files_, Harry attempts suicide by vampire while having sex with her.
-   On _Dynasty (1981)_, Cecil Colby (Lloyd Bochner) suffers a heart attack and dies underneath new wife Alexis (Joan Collins). Alexis slapping him in the face to bring him around adds Narm.
-   Ha'Gel from _Earth: Final Conflict_. Very similar method of death for his victims. Of course, he was desperate, as he seemed to be the Last of His Kind. He essentially rapes both Sandoval and Beckett to produce Liam, the hero of seasons 2&3. Liam doesn't seem to acknowledge his alien parent any more than he absolutely has to.
-   _Farscape_:
    -   John Crichton enters an alternate reality where one of his plans went pear-shaped and Moya is on the verge of imminent destruction. So naturally, Chiana tries to have sex with him, figuring she might as well die doing something she likes. An earlier episode has Aeryn and John trapped on a transport pod that's running out of air. Realising they'll be dead in less than an hour they suddenly start tearing off their spacesuits to have sex... only to be interrupted by D'Argo coming to their rescue.
    -   Zhaan's backstory has her murdering her Quisling lover while having sex with him.
-   An Invoked Trope in Chilean Telenovela _La Fiera_ (1999). In her Establishing Character Moment, Black Widow Magdalena Ossandón is shown to have gotten rid of her latest elderly mark on their wedding night this way. It crosses into Black Comedy/Gallows Humor territory when people in charge of the funeral suggest making it a closed casket ceremony because the _rigor mortis_ set in too soon due to the guy's strenuous activities prior to his passing (Truth in Television), leaving his face fixed in a _satisfied_ expression that made it incredibly obvious just how he died.
-   _Firefly_: Word of God regarding the mysterious syringe that Inara reveals in the pilot is that it contains a drug that makes having sex with her lethal. There was supposed to be an episode later in the series where Inara was attacked by Reavers. Mal was to discover her badly traumatized and surrounded by Reaver corpses and help her through it.
-   Discussed in _Game of Thrones_ by Tyrion, who, when asked how he wishes to die, replies, "At the age of 80, in my own bed, with a belly full of wine, and a girl's mouth around my cock."
-   In _Ghosts (UK)_, Julian Fawcett is the trouserless ghost of a disgraced MP who died in a sex scandal in 1993.
-   Discussed but averted in _Gilmore Girls_. At the beginning of season five, Paris calls Rory and tells her boyfriend Asher died over the summer while they were on vacation. Asher being old enough to be Paris' grandfather, this is, of course, Rory's first assumption for the cause of death, leading to one of the best lines Paris ever had in the show:
    
    _No, Rory, this great man was not brought down by my vagina._
    
-   On _The Golden Girls_, this is how Rose's husband Charlie died.
    
    **Rose:** Oh, there was something wild about him that night. Although I did think it was strange when he started yelling, "Rose, I'm going! I'm going!" Normally it was the opposite!
    
    -   The episode that revealed how Charlie died started off with Rose's then-current boyfriend dying in his sleep after they made love. She almost gives up sex because she's convinced she must be cursed for this to happen to her _twice._
-   _The Great_: Lady Joanna, who fell out of an open window mid-coitus.
-   In Isabella Rossellini's humorous educational series _Green Porno_, this is the common fate for male bees.

-   _The Hard Times of RJ Berger_: R.J. Berger and Lily Miran... in a hospital bed while she is in critical condition no less. Although viewers will have to wait; due to the machine indicating that she flatlined, it is unknown if she is truly dead.
-   _Harrow_: In "Peccata Patris" ("Sins of the Father"), the Victim of the Week is a gay schoolboy who suffers a fatal allergy to semen while giving his boyfriend oral sex for the first time. This leads to Death by Falling Over when he is given a shove while choking.
-   _Hill Street Blues_: When Michael Conrad died in 1983 (due to urethral cancer), his character, Sgt. Phillip Esterhaus also died. How did he die? Suffering a massive heart attack while making love with his girlfriend, Grace Gardner. (Several episodes that had been completed prior to Conrad's death were aired in late 1983-early 1984, prior to the airing of "Grace Under Pressure," although his last appearances had him only appearing "at roll call.")
-   Not the trope itself, but Barney of _How I Met Your Mother_ names the trope when a cremated friend of his that happens to be a suit in an urn, which he takes to the bar, causes a girl to go home with him.
-   In _Just Shoot Me!_, Nina encounters her old agent, Catherine, who has grown suicidal. Nina tries to help her take her mind off of it by introducing her to Finch. It seems to work as the two hit it off, only for Nina to find out Catherine had intended to invoke this trope, figuring her heart would give out during sex. Nina rushes to try and stop it only to find a stretcher being wheeled out of Catherine's apartment. Ultimately subverted. The one on the stretcher was Finch. Catherine had performed a particular maneuver and his asthma kicked in. He was still begging for more as the paramedics were wheeling him out.
-   _Killjoys_: Sabine dies having sex with D'avin as she hemorrhages the green plasma.
-   Portrayed in an episode of _Law & Order: Criminal Intent_ that opened with a paranoid millionaire having his trophy wife gunned down after one last love-making session.

Hilarity Ensues as the general's aide de camp spends the second half of the episode trying to find a battle into which he can bring the general's corpse. The idea, of course, is that instead of going out with a bang, the general — in the public eye — will Go Out With a \*BANG\*.
-   _Metal Hurlant Chronicles_: In "Three on a Match" the captain of the USS _Atlanta_ is having very rough sex with one of her crew members. The two of them have The Immodest Orgasm at literally the exact instant Metal Hurlant collides with her quarters and sets off the chain-reaction destruction of the _Atlanta_.
-   _Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries_: In "Death & Hysteria", the Victim of the Week suffers a High-Voltage Death when the killer tampers with her vibrator.
-   The concept of this trope gave rise to this classic observation on the British show _Mock the Week_: "There are those who say there is no good way to die. These people have obviously never heard the phrase _drug-and-sex-fueled heart attack_".
-   On _Mr. Belvedere_, George is distressed to learn that one of his friends died this way and is subsequently very reluctant to make love with Martha. She finally manages to seduce him by telling him, "At least you'll go out with a smile." He suddenly remembers that his friend did indeed have this expression on his face and they fall out of sight.
-   Subverted in an episode of _Night Court_. Dan Fielding met a woman who had killed most men she'd had sex with. The only survivor was John Wayne, "... who never walked the same again." At the end of the episode, Dan emerged from her embrace while doing an impression of The Duke.

-   In _Outrageous Fortune_, gold-digging Pascalle marries a much older man but they can't consummate the marriage because he has a serious heart condition. _I could kill him with my body!_
-   _Oz_. Preferred murder method of Depraved Bisexual Serial Killer Chris Keller, as it's a good way to get an inmate to walk off with you someplace where there are no witnesses.
-   _Paris Police 1900_ begins with French President Félix Faure dying of a heart attack while receiving oral sex from his mistress, which is widely claimed to have happened in real life.
-   _Picket Fences_ did a similar story, but without the sex: an obese woman didn't want to admit that she'd rolled over in her sleep and smothered her husband _by accident,_ so she claimed to have done it deliberately.
-   A BBC _Play For Today_ set in the Ulster Troubles featured a scene in which a senior RUC (police) officer was "getting it on" with a "sex worker" when two IRA gunmen burst into the bedroom; before they killed the cop, one of them said "For the love of God, man! Have you never heard of Safe Sex?"
-   In _Powers_ at the start of the series, Olympia dies while having sex.
-   One episode of _The Practice_ involved an attractive woman in her thirties/forties on trial for murdering her elderly husband by sex. The Reveal is, of course, that she did it, but not to get his money; she just had some _serious_ daddy issues.
-   In the "Coasts" episode of _Prehistoric Planet_, the scaphitids (a type of ammonite) are shown dying after mating, just like their modern cephalopod relatives.
-   Emmett of _Queer as Folk (US)_ had an older lover die this way. In an airplane bathroom.
-   _Red Dwarf_:
    -   Supposedly fated to be Lister's death long after the events of the series. "He chokes to death, aged 181, trying to remove a bra with his teeth." The source of this information does not have a stellar record, however. (And the Cat comments that at the age of 181, the bra was probably his own.)
    -   He does seem to have a penchant for that kind of thing, though... in the episode "Timeslides", he gains a Portal to the Past and tweaks things a little so that he does _not_ go on Red Dwarf and instead dies in a plane accident, aged 98. He was having sex with his fourteenth wife and lost control of the plane.
-   Parodied on _Seinfeld,_ where one episode includes Kramer passing out (while not during sex, the situation seemed headed that way). The woman he passes out on top of contacts her relative (brother?) who has mob connections and Kramer wakes up in the East River.
-   The Jailbait episode of season 5 of _The Shield_ had Officers Lowe and Hanlon called to a warehouse where the owner reported discovering two bodies. The fat truck driver presumably having died of a heart attack and crushing his partner to death with his weight. After the necessary gallows humour, the officers are shocked to discover the woman is still alive.
-   Happens in almost _every episode_ of _Silk Stalkings_. Sometimes more than once. One example stands out in "Where There's a Will": a wealthy man is murdered by his younger partner when she handcuffs him to the bed and forces him to take a sexual performance enhancement drug that aggravates his heart condition. The man starts begging her to stop when he realizes what's happening, but she ignores him and continues to ride him _while he's suffering a fatal heart attack_.
-   Referenced in _Smallville_, where Clark spends an episode worrying that this will happen to Lana, if he gets overexcited and loses control of his powers. He doesn't. Which is a pity, cause it would have been hilarious. Jor-El apparently took precautions and later "trained" Clark to prevent this from happening, which allows him and Lois to later have a healthy sex life.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   In the _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ episode "Let He Who Is Without Sin...", Dax's previous host Curzon is stated to have died having sex. (With Vanessa Williams, so, justified.) However, this directly conflicts with Jadzia's Orb vision of her symbiont implantation in the pilot (in which Curzon is very much alive), and with her account of Curzon dying in a hospital bed in "Blood Oath" (in which he is said to have died in a hospital bed a day or so after Dax's removal).<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   In the _Star Trek: Voyager_ episode "Favorite Son", Taresian reproduction involves three women and one man, and is always fatal to the man. Between this and the fact that the species doesn't have male children very often, they end up depleting their male population so severely that they devise a scheme to bring alien men to them.
    -   Jokingly discussed in _Star Trek: Picard_ regarding the Beta Annari, a sentient reptiloid species whose highly developed olfactory sense allows them to smell the last thing you ate and the last person you had sex with... if they're not the same thing.
-   On _The Steve Harvey Show_, Regina's husband Jordan dies this way on their honeymoon. She returns home and recounts the tragedy to Cedric, Lovita, and Steve.
    
    **Steve** (to Cedric): I always knew it would be killer, but Damn!
    
-   _The Tick (2001)_: The Immortal, (a Superman-expy), has a heart attack while under Captain Liberty. Given the... erm, _frizzy_ part of her hair in the following scenes (and the paired scorch marks in her ceiling), it's evident he wasn't in full control of his heat vision during the act.
-   _Tidelands (Netflix)_: All men whom the sirens call to mate with them out in the sea drown while they're doing so.
-   On _Too Close for Comfort_, Ted relates how a friend of his died this way, the woman in question _not_ his wife. ("All he was wearing when they found him was a pair of socks and a big grin..." he mutters.) However, Muriel is less upset by the guy's adultery than the fact that he had no will, something Ted has been putting off writing. (He spends most of the episode trying to convince himself that he has to.)
-   The _Torchwood_ episode "Day One" features an alien that feeds off sexual energy, which has the unfortunate effect of reducing its sexual partners to dust.
    
    _\[The team is watching a security video of the act\]_  
    **Gwen:** He just...  
    **Jack:** _\[deadpan\]_ Came and went.  
    **Owen:** Now that's how I'd like to go.  
    **Tosh:** I'm sure we could arrange it.
    
-   Happens in one of the later episodes of _Twin Peaks_ as a hot 20-something gets married to a 70+-year-old who happens to be the Mayor's brother. Only on their wedding night, the groom dies of a heart attack. The Mayor brands her a witch and almost shoots her but after a quick, ahem, discussion they decide to get married instead.
-   In _Two and a Half Men_, Alan befriends his elderly next-door neighbor (who has a dislike of Charlie), and eventually dates and has sex with her, and she passes. Charlie keeps making fun of them (well, mostly Alan) till the end:
    
    "That's it! I knew there was a "big bang" joke! "
    
-   On _Waiting for God_, Diana reveals this once happened to her. When Tom says, "What a wonderful way to go!" she replies, "For him, maybe! I was dreadfully embarrassed!"
-   _Westworld_. Once Maeve discovers the true nature of Westworld and that Death is Cheap, she arranges to get killed every time she wants to talk with the technicians whose job it is to fix her. One death involved taunting a client during sex until he strangles her, and a couple of others involve having sex with outlaw Hector Escaton, one on top of a safe while a posse shoots down the door, the other inside a burning tent.
-   On _What We Do in the Shadows (2019)_, Laszlo summons his mortal form's ghost. His unfinished business? He died (or, rather, was sired) "in the saddle" but before reaching the end of the act.
-   On _Will & Grace_, Karen's husband Stan apparently dies in bed with his mistress. It's later revealed that he was faking it.
-   _The X-Files_:
    -   The episode "Gender Bender" from season 1, is an example of this trope.
    -   The third season episode "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" had the titular psychic suggesting that this would be Mulder's death: "You know, there are worse ways to go, but I can't think of a more undignified one than auto-erotic asphyxiation."
    -   In the same episode Clyde also predicted he himself would die in bed with Scully. This ended up being true, as he died in bed, and Scully was in the room. He was in bed, and with Scully, but not in bed with Scully. Ironically, he dies in a way similar to how he predicted _Mulder_ would die, but the way he asphyxiates himself is suicide.

    Music 

-   Mitch Benn's Black Comedy "Auto-Erotic Asphyxiation" is about people who died while attempting, yes, well...
    
    _Was it a tragic accident or was it suicide?  
    Would they still be alive today if they hadn't gotten bored and tried,  
    Auto-erotic asphyxiation.  
    Did they want to die? There's no way of knowing,  
    They couldn't tell whether they were coming or going._
    
-   The Eric Bogle song "Little Gomez" is about a randy Chihuahua that is crushed to death while attempting to consummate a liaison with a Saint Bernard.
-   Kim Petras' "Death by Sex", from her Halloween album _Turn Off The Light_, features her _offering_ this to her lovers as an incentive.
-   In name only: If you think "Death by Blowjob" is A Good Name for a Rock Band...too late. A (now defunct Industrial) Belgian label had this name.
-   Musician John Entwistle went out like this in June 2002, in a Las Vegas hotel room with a hooker <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and a supply of cocaine. In the words of his bandmates:

    **Roger Daltrey:** If you knew John, ... that was the perfect ending for him.
    
-   A double KO takes place at the end of "Leaving Love All Over The Place" by George Jones:
-   Yuliy Kim's song "Baron Germont" is about a baron who went to war, leaving his young wife behind. Years later, he returns and is surprised at how young his friends look (they fell victim to the trope; he was looking at their kids).
-   Father John Misty's "I Went to the Store One Day" actually wishes for this.
    
    _When my body says, "Enough!"  
    Don't let me die in a hospital  
    I'll save the big one for the last time we make love_
    
-   "Nymphomaniac Fantasia" by Nightwish _seems_ to be (the lyrics are somewhat cryptic) about a woman who discovers her significant other has cheated on her ("The scent of a woman was not mine") and kills him after having sex with him one last time.
    
    _Old love lies deep, you said  
    Deeper shall be the wound between your legs_
    

    Myths & Religion 

-   Classical Mythology:
    -   In Greek mythology the empousae are a species of female demons that take on the form of beautiful women and use this form to seduce male victims. Once an empousa has gotten the guy to bed, she devours him alive and drinks his blood.
    -   King Minos was under a curse... to ejaculate snakes and scorpions. This was a curse placed on him by his wife, a powerful sorceress, who did it so that he wouldn't cheat on her (the curse was only activated if he slept with anyone other than his wife, in order to cause him pain and kill his mistresses in the process). Minos eventually found a workaround when he got a mistress who was also a sorceress, and she made a potion that counteracted the curse so they could be together.
-   Irish Mythology: In story of the first people to settle Ireland, a ship lands on Ireland carrying 50 women and 3 men.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  In order to try and sire a second generation for the settlers the women split into three groups, one for each man. When one of the men died of exhaustion the women of his group all joined the second man's group. He died of exhaustion too. The final man, a druid and shapeshifter named Fintan, now pursued by an army of lonely women fled by jumping into a river and turning into a salmon so as to not share the fate of his compatriots, and hiding inside a cave until the women were all killed in a flood.
-   The _Book of Numbers_ tells us that after Israel settled in Shittim, they started worshipping Baal and being driven to sin by the Moabites. God responds by smiting them with a plague and in the midst of everything an Israelite man named Zimri and a Midianite woman named Cozbi sneak into a room to have sex. They are spotted by Phineas, son of Eleazar who immediately takes a spear and shoves it through both of their bodies at once. This soothes the wrath of God who ceases the plague.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   This was the climax of WWE Diva Dawn Marie's (kayfabe) romance with Torrie Wilson's (real life) father Al Wilson: his death via honeymoon nookie. It had all been Played for Laughs... at least until Torrie tried to get revenge for her father's death by- what else?- defeating Dawn Marie in a professional wrestling match. When Dawn Marie showed up for their "Stepmother Versus Stepdaughter" match in _mourner's clothing_ and close to tears it felt like the punchline to a different, much less funny joke.

    Radio 

-   _Old Harry's Game:_ The Devil gets pretty irritated after the invention of Viagra, as Hell experiences a sudden flood of old men suddenly showing up half-dressed and smiling like idiots, leading Satan to wonder if mankind will successfully manage to pork itself to death.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Multiple instances of this in _F.A.T.A.L._, including being the victim of an eternal orgasm spell and failing a saving throw if your anus or vagina is stretched too far.
    -   REALISTIC!
-   In _Warhammer 40,000_ this is apparently the _only_ way to have sex, especially when Slaanesh is involved, and _especially_ when the Dark Eldar are involved. The only ones this doesn't happen to are either asexual (Orks, Tyranids), religiously abstinent (Space Marines), or beneath notice (99% of human and tau civilians).

    Theatre 

-   In _La Cage aux folles_, the conservative political leader, while noting that most of the national newspapers have fondly eulogized the president, noticed that one liberal newspaper noted that the president's last words were "Remember my little gift."
-   In _City of Angels_, upon hearing that the sexy young "Miss" Alaura Kingsley actually has a 75-year-old husband, Oolie's quip (after several unsuccessful ones are rubbed out by Stine's typewriter) is: "He must've decided to go out with a bang instead of a whimper."

    Video Games 

-   In _The Consuming Shadow_, victims of a lust god are described as having died from "exhaustion". All damage to the body comes post-mortem.
-   Can happen to your character in the _Crusader Kings_ games if he's old enough, though as it's a Real-Time Strategy / Simulation Game, nothing explicit is shown.
-   In the Gamecube game _Cubivore_, you play as a titular creature, who, as an animal, likes to talk about how much he wants to kill and eat things and also mate. Of course, "mating" in the Cubivore-verse involves the females slaughtering the male in some obscure way. We later find out that what appears to be the dominant female in all of Cubivoredom apparently devours the male when mating with him.
-   _Disco Elysium_ has a notable dramatic version. It turns out that the Hanged Man, whose murder the Player Character is investigating, was shot dead right in mid-coitus with the Femme Fatale. She turns out to genuinely have nothing to do with his death though, except for the killer being a Stalker With Crush towards her and deciding to Murder the Hypotenuse.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_:
    -   In the in-game book _Hallgerd's Tale_, Pasoroth beheads the man cuckolding him during the act of cuckolding, then takes over where the other guy left off.
    -   The Morag Tong is an assassin's guild officially sanctioned by the Dunmeri government. One of their favorite techniques is to seduce their target and murder them in bed. Fitting, given that the Tong operates in service to Mephala, the Daedric Prince associated with manipulation, lies, sex, murder, and betrayal.
-   In _Fallout 2_, the player can get his/her car stolen in New Reno. After finding the chopshop with their car in it, the player can buy it back, threaten to kill the owner T-Ray, or, if female, pay by other means. Female players can keep doing this to get car upgrades and fuel cells. However, doing it too quickly in a short span of time will make T-Ray explode after having too much sex.
    -   _Fallout: New Vegas_ lets you deal with Benny in this manner if you have the right perk.
-   _F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin_'s ending changes the context of several life-threatening scenes throughout the previous game, making this implication clear. If Beckett is killed during any of Alma's attempts to grapple him, it turns out that getting overpowered and raped by a psychic ghost of world-ending power is quite lethal.
-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   Some asari of the universe have a rare genetic defect that kills their partners during sex. These asari, known as Ardat-Yakshi, grow smarter, stronger, and deadlier with each encounter, and it is an addiction to them, such that upon diagnosis, the Ardat-Yakshi is given the choice of living in isolation or being executed. In _Mass Effect 2_, Samara's loyalty mission has you going after an active one of these by the name of Morinth, who uses her condition much like a serial killer and has been doing this for 400 years. You can choose to recruit her on your team, and get it on with her — with predictable results.
    -   Also in _Mass Effect 2_, Science Hero Mordin Solus warns Shepard of possible complications with various romantic partners:
        -   He hypothesizes that Jack might lose control of her already unstable biotic powers and accidentally kill Shepard mid-coitus. If you do consummate the relationship, however, nothing of the sort actually occurs.
        -   A similar aversion also occurs with Tali, except in this case Mordin is afraid that _she'll_ be the one to die due to her species' unusual immune system, which adapted to assimilate pathogens instead of killing them. However, Tali's smart enough to take the right precautions and comes out of it with nothing more than a nasty cold. And even then, she admits that it was totally Worth It. If you continue the romance in _Mass Effect 3_, she suffers no ill effects due to having adapted to Shepard. Mordin also warns both Tali and Garrus that, due to Mirror Chemistry, ingesting bodily fluids could give either partner a potentially fatal allergic reaction.
-   In _Monster Girl Quest_, when Luka is defeated by certain monster girls they will kill him in the resulting rape scene. They may do this by draining all his energy (mostly succubi), draining all of his fluids, forcing him to ejaculate until he dies of exhaustion, or eating him whole.
-   An interesting take on this trope in _M.U.G.E.N_\- Panty's finishing move is to have sex with her opponent (thankfully, it's censored). Granted, this is accurate to her character, but Panty never had sex during a fight at any point in the series.
-   In the Rogue Like game _NetHack_, there are incubi and succubi who might have sex with you (incubi for female characters, succubi for male characters). When this happens, there is a chance that "You feel exhausted", and you lose some hitpoints. If you die because of this, it's considered "overexertion". There is also a chance of leveldrain. Unless you wear proper "protection", then it's just HP loss.
-   _Sengoku Rance_ has the Ninjas themselves. Hell, Suzume has a few like poison on her breasts, a drug that would burst whenever someone came inside her, and so on.

-   _The Sims_:
    -   This is actually possible in _The Sims 3_ (console), as can be seen in this screenshot<small>◊</small>.
    -   An elder Sim in _The Sims 4_ can suffer Death by Overexertion if they "WooHoo" while uncomfortable, and promptly warrant a visit by the Grim Reaper.
-   Avoiding this is actually a puzzle in the first game of _The Spellcasting Series_, as Ernie ends up on an island of amazons who have no problems taking what they want from our dorky hero. Take too long, and Ernie dies from exhaustion.
-   In _The Spiral Scouts_, after providing King Roland with an elixir, he goes to have sex with Queen Vale, so loud and so intense it shakes the castle and sounds like cannon fire, and that Vale can feel Roland's "bone-dog" in her _ribcage_. After it's over, Roland goes back to Remae and tells her "Well, she's dead."
-   _WildStar_ has a quest in Deradune where you guide explosive Mammodin (rhinos) into poacher camps. You fail if you get too close to other Mammodin, which prompts them to either attack you or try to mate with you, prematurely detonating the explosives.
-   Implied to be the cause of death of the first husband of Lucrezia Flathead in the _Zork_ Series. Given that husbands four through eighteen all died on their wedding nights, it may have happened to them, too.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _ATOM GRRRL!!_, Big E's "weapon" hid under her coat. She basically pegs guys to death.
-   The hentai game _Bible Black_ (which spawned an even more popular H-anime) has several "Bad Ends" which use some combination of drugs and/or magic to cause the hero to die of... "dehydration".
-   _Bloodbound_ has a suspiciously cheap diamond scene to hook up with an antagonistic character (less than half the price of typical hookup scenes) and warns you that it's not going to end well. In the scene, the vampire Priya Lacroix warns the player not to make a sound or she'll bite. No matter how quickly you select the choices to stay quiet, you'll eventually cave, causing Priya to suck you dry before you return to the checkpoint.
-   Similar to the _Mass Effect_ example above, in _Fate/stay night_ the Makiri lust worms do this to women. Basically (to quote the game), "The worms will transform when attacking a woman so that they are only able to violate her nerves. They will spread their tentacles all over her body and devour her spirit. The lust worms will wet the woman's skin with their mucus, excite and destroy her central nerves of pleasure, and satisfy their hunger. It must be their instincts, as the worms seem to love the woman's womb. They do not eat female flesh but seek the organs within them. They give the woman huge enough orgasms to fry her brain, and they go into her body to devour her placenta. Unwilling to eat human flesh, the worms have only one way to get what they desire. As a result, the woman's mind and body are completely violated and destroyed." And these worms are basically penises with More Teeth than the Osmond Family.
-   _Katawa Shoujo_ treats this seriously because it is a very real danger for the hero, who has a weak heart that can fail from too much excitement and/or physical exertion. Usually, he's able to keep calm enough to avoid any problems, but at least one H-scene is cut short due to him coming _extremely_ close to having a heart attack.
-   Subverted in _Phantom of Inferno_, where Drei informs the badly wounded main character that she wants to go out like this as commandos approach the building they're in. While in great pain and doubting her sanity, he is forced to go along with her plan as she undresses him herself, and just at the climax the commandos rappel into the room - Drei rolls off, grabs her pistol, and shoots both dead. While stark naked. She then explains that she's decided that was a stupid plan, and she's going to kill them all instead.

    Webcomics 

-   _Amazing Super Powers_ — "I can't decide whether I want it to be Keith..." (see also Alt Text and hidden comic).
-   The protagonist of a risqué webcomic _Bad Bunny_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  is a rabbit in love with a dog twice his size. Every night of their sex ends with him in trauma center. They do each have another lover their size (a rabbit and a wolf, respectively), but the rabbit keeps occasionally coming back for more, despite knowing the next time could kill him.
-   Rek'mar of _Drowtales_ was finally able to sleep with Lulianne, who he had been courting for the longest time. At this point, Lulianne was already under the possession of Khaless and Rek'mar's aura is absorbed by her during the act, killing him.
-   _Get Medieval_: One character finds himself in a brothel and in dire need of clothes. He's given a spare set of clothes whose previous owner is said to have died in the act.
-   In _Mage & Demon Queen_, Malori dies this way after finally managing to get her longtime-crush-now-turned-girlfriend Velverosa into bed. Played for Laughs in that Malori being a human wasn't able to keep up with Vel's draconic stamina, and since Death is Cheap for humans, she revives in her hometown's church not long after, naked and mortified.
-   _Oglaf_:
    -   Navaan convinces a man dying from a snakebite on his penis to have sex with her, asking "Do you want to die fucking or not fucking?"
        
        **Navaan:** Fact! It's not necrophilia if he was alive when the sex started.
        
    -   A man who's about to be executed for treason asks if they the town does "erotic executions", so they assign him to Greta, an executioner dominatrix who proceeds to ride him until he suffocates in the noose.
-   _Ow, my sanity_: Apparently, a female member of the cult in David's dorm went into cardiac arrest and died due to either one mammoth-sized orgasm or several.
-   This _Perry Bible Fellowship_ comic. With a twist, naturally.
-   This _Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal_ comic has Superman explaining to a woman that she wouldn't survive sex with him, she understands and leaves. Then Wonder Woman says the same thing to a guy... next panel shows a tombstone. The bonus panel says he was the Author Avatar, and didn't last two minutes.
-   _Super Rivals_: Shapshifting supervillain, Madame Mischief, executes a security guard after having sex with him while disguised as a female guard he had a thing for.

    Web Original 

    Western Animation 

-   _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_: After Carl's pool is severely polluted for several episodes and is revealed to have even developed life, Frylock finally cleans it. A mermaid comes out and offers to have sex with Carl, or rather she shrinks down into his penis to grant him an unmatched sense of euphoria that turns out to be her laying her eggs in him, which causes Carl to explode open. Frylock admits to having sex with her as well and also explodes, then Meatwad follows suit.
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   Justified, wherein one of the...involved parties is Death.
    -   In season 14, Superman is seen standing over the body of a young woman with some police. She's in bed in her nightie, her mouth is open, and her brains are splattered all over the wall. Superman claims that he just heard her scream, and everything was like this when he got there. No clues, probably never to be solved, but what can you do? One of the police comments it's just like the bodies of three guys they found in a public restroom a few days ago. "Yup. Unsolvable."
-   _Futurama_:
    -   In "Amazon Women in the Mood", Fry, Kif, and Zapp Brannigan are actually sentenced to "Death by Snu-snu" from eight-foot-tall Amazons. Fry and Zapp's expressions upon hearing of their fate shift rapidly (and repeatedly) between horror and shit-eating grins while Kif sticks with horror. As shown by the image above, three skeletons of previous victims are seen nearby with crushed pelvises in very satisfied poses (one even holding a cigarette).
        
        _\[Kif sobs\]_  
        **Zapp:** What are you, _gay_?!
        
    -   Also, as revealed in "Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?", Decapodians die when they mate, much like real octopuses do.
-   This trope was spoofed in an episode of _Robot Chicken_, which combined aspects of _The Golden Girls_ and _Sex and the City_:
    
    **Blanche:** In the middle of my no-denture adventure, my boyfriend's spirit released, in more ways than one!  
    **Man sitting at an adjacent table**: Check, Please!
    
-   _South Park_:
    -   In "Quintuplets 2000", the elderly Grandpa Marsh has sex with an equally elderly Romanian grandmother. The next morning, he discovers her body in the throes of rigor mortis, and remarks "So that's why she didn't say good night."
    -   And Ms. Choksondik... well...
    -   "The Ring" ends with Kenny finally getting a blowjob from his new girlfriend, only to reveal that he died of syphilis afterwards. Kenny's usual behavior implies he thought it was Worth It.
