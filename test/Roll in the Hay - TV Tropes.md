The needle is here, but which haystack to put it in?

_"Oh, come on, we're not just in the hay to look for needles, are we?"_

A popular trope in many stories set on a farm. A young couple decides to make love while lying in a hay barrack in a barn or one in an open field. One of them (or both) can be the teenage son or daughter of a farmer, but it might also be a general couple who just happen to encounter a hay barrack while being in the countryside.

Usually they are fleeing from the wrath of the girl's Boyfriend-Blocking Dad, but rain, police, soldiers, or nightfall can be opportune reasons as well. For some strange reason, their pursuer will be unable to find them, even though a bunch of hay might be the most logical hiding place ever. As he leaves, the couple makes love to celebrate the fact that he couldn't find them.

This is especially a popular trope in erotic fiction, almost to the point of being a cliché.

Also Truth in Television, as many young people who grew up in the countryside will tell you. Of all the possible locations for surreptitious lovemaking and/or hiding, a hay barrack is the most obvious choice. It's soft, comfy, and ticklish. While the term "roll in the hay" can also be an expression for casual sex and/or quickies in general, this trope is specifically about sex on a pile of hay.
