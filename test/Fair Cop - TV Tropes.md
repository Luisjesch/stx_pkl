_"Hello, Officer Pretty."_

— **Detective Berkeley**, greeting Detective Calleigh Duquesne in the _CSI: Miami_ Season 6 opener

In any given Crime and Punishment Series or film, the chances of encountering a Fair Cop are high.

A Fair Cop is any police officer who is ridiculously attractive, ridiculously young, or both. This should not, however, carry with it assumptions that they are dumb. Call it the police version of Good-Looking Privates. TV cops almost never have a mustache.

The title is a play on the British and Australian expression "It's a fair cop", said when one admits having been caught fair and square. See also Firemen Are Hot and Good-Looking Privates. Cousin to Hot Men at Work.

You are not particularly likely to see a Fair Cop in a stripper's police outfit — although you may see him or her as a Dirty Harriet, which gives a whole new meaning to the motto "To protect and to serve".

If you're looking for a fair-_minded_ cop, you're probably looking for Reasonable Authority Figure or maybe a By-the-Book Cop (who _usually_ fits). If you're looking for someone who's attracted to cops, that falls under policing as an Inherently Attractive Profession.

-   The hot lady sheriff in this Schick razors commercial.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Anime & Manga 

-   Sheriff Hopps from the parallel chapters of _+Anima_—he's handsome enough that Nana seems taken by him, though he's also not very nice...at first.
-   Chono from _20th Century Boys_. He could be considered a deconstruction — his youth and attractive face could be seen as serving to highlight the fact that he's inexperienced and idealistic, rather than simply giving the viewer some eye candy. Not that he's "ridiculously" young or good-looking anyway.
-   Birdy Cephon Altera, the title character of _Birdy the Mighty_ is a beautiful Space Police officer. In the OVA series, she once accosted someone who followed her, only to find out that the guy was really a talent scout who thought she could be a model and actually has an alter ego that's a model in _Decode_.
-   _Case Closed_:
    -   Miwako Sato isn't only a strong Action Girl but she's also very beautiful and _very_ popular with men. Aside of her: Inspector Shiratori is very Tall, Dark, and Handsome (despite his really weird bangs), Wataru Takagi is said to be good-looking in a dorky way, the pretty traffic cop Yumi Miyamoto has no shortage of admirers, and Yumi's partner Naeko Miike is also noted to be super moe.
    -   Good-looking cops in the Conan-verse aren't restricted to the Tokyo Police Department. Other good-looking law enforcement officials include Nagano detective Yui Uehara, FBI agents Jodie Starling and Shuichi Akai, CIA agent Hidemi Hondou, currently in disguise as reporter Rena Mizunashi and Black Organization member Kir , and budding detective Tooru Amuro who is actually Japanese Security Bureau agent Rei Furuya, also disguised as Black Organization member Bourbon . Let's just say that good looks are a prerequisite to be a law-enforcement officer in Conan-verse (unless your last name is Camel or Yamamura)
    -   Teenage detectives Shinichi Kudo, Heiji Hattori, and Masumi Sera, while not officially law enforcement, are no slouches in the looks department as well.
-   _City Hunter_:
    -   Saeko is both this and a Femme Fatale. She is a gorgeous police inspector who tends to give Ryo very ungrateful jobs.
    -   Hideyuki used to be one before resigning in disgrace over failing to save their Reverse Mole in a slave ring and to apprehend the slavers.
-   Kirihara Misaki from _Darker than Black_ in season 1 and part of season 2 until she quits the police force.
-   Officer Kuhou from _Franken Fran_. Until she is transformed into a Cute Monster Girl, at least.
-   _Ghost in the Shell_:
    -   Togusa is the youngest and most naive member of Section 9, and the only one who is not a cyborg. He's also easily most handsome of them. Unlike the rest of the team, he's not an ex-special forces member but used to be a regular police officer. He's also the only one who has not yet become completely cynical, but the job is steadily pushing him into that direction as well.
    -   The Major. Her attractiveness is of course completely artificial; the exterior of her prosthetic body is made of standard components, meaning that there isn't a speck of individuality in her sexy frame, and people can easily recognise her as a cyborg, but also mistake her for a cheap model. This, however, is true only to certain continuities in the franchise; in others, she uses custom-built bodies with plenty of individuality.
-   _Gintama_:
-   It's only natural that the Shinsengumi in _Hakuouki_ are this, especially Hijikata, Saito and Okita.
-   Clarabelle "Bell" Kawamoto from _Jagaaaaaan_ is a police officer and is very sexy. Jagasaki sure is lucky to work with her.
-   _Kochikame_.
    -   Reiko Katherine Akimoto. She work as Patrol Officer in the Police Box and is a tall and beauty woman with long blonde hair and large breast.
    -   Nakagawa is a Tall, Dark, and Handsome Chick Magnet.
    -   The anime add Komachi and Naoko, two cute policewoman.
-   The Enforcers of _Lyrical Nanoha_, whose ranks include Chrono, Fate, and Teana. It helps that the law enforcement branch of the Time-Space Administration Bureau gets those spiffy black uniforms.
-   In a Formula-Breaking Episode of _Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch_ in which they're policewomen, the Black Beauty Sisters hit every note of this.
-   _Patlabor_: Each of the women of the SVU are attractive; particularly Kanuka and Shinobu.
    -   Shinobu is noted for her beauty, despite being in her mid-late 20's and it's well known around the barracks that her fellow captain, Gotoh, is love with her. However, she strictly enforces a professional relationship between them.
    -   In her debut episode, Kanauka had practically all the guys in the division (including Asuma) falling over themselves asking her out, or simply asking for her phone number, or if she had a sister as beautiful as she is. It actually took Gotoh to get them to settle down long enough just so she could finish introducing herself.
    -   Noa's no slouch in the looks department either. In chapter 5 of the manga version, she got hit on by a couple of guys, while she was waiting for Asuma to show up for their "date". While in the anime version, during Hana's brief stint with the SVU2, she actually developed a canonical crush on her. Though after seeing the chemistry between Noa and Asuma, Hana relented so they could be together. Naturally, they had no idea what she was talking about.
-   _Pokémon_
    -   In _Pokémon: The Series_, it's Officer Jenny, of course. _All_ of them.
    -   For those who prefer male officers, the _Pokémon Adventures_ arcs set in Johto have Falkner, who works as a cop in addition to his Gym Leader duties.

-   _Squid Girl_ has Keiko Furukawa, a beautiful and absolutely adorable young policewoman. She once traded her uniform for a bikini to stand out less, but ended up standing out _more_ because nearby customers were now attracted to how cute she is.
-   _Tenchi Muyo!_ has Mihoshi Kuramitsu and Kiyone Mabiki, Galaxy Police officers.
-   _Tokyo Ghoul_ has several Ghoul Investigators that earn comments about their good looks. Arima and Akira have both been described as beautiful, while Amon is repeatedly called handsome by admiring women.
-   _You're Under Arrest!_:
    -   This mainly applies to Natsumi and Miyuki, who're noted for their looks at various points throughout the series. Both have been hit on several times, though each has a love interest of their own. So they choose to either ignore other advances, or for the crude, pushy types, they "gently" persuade them to reconsider.
    -   Yoriko and Aoi are also fairly attractive and have had suitors of their own. The only reason Yoriko isn't dating, is because she hasn't found anyone she'd be interested in, who'd be interested _in her_, except for a foreign prince who's young enough to be her kid brother. Which, naturally, didn't sit well with her. As for Aoi's potential boyfriends... you can imagine how well any of those work out.
    -   The guys are fairly easy on the eyes too, including their chief, Kachou, who barely looks a day older than his mid 30's, even though he's pushing 50! There are a couple of average looking guys in Ken's bunch, but we don't see them often.
-   Soichi Kazama in _Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds_ (Called Kaz in the dub version). Also one of the few cops on the show who was _never_ hostile to the heroes.

    Comic Books 

-   Batman:
    -   Detective Renee Montoya of the Major Crimes Unit of the Gotham City Police Department. However, at the end of _Gotham Central_, she quit the force in disgust. As of _52_, she wears the mantle of The Question.
    -   Officer Jamie Harper, formerly of the GCPD where she helped out Tim Drake, is quite good looking. She eventually transferred to the Metropolis Science Police.
    -   Also from Gotham PD is Detective Nick Gage or, as Steph calls him, "Detective McHandsome".
    -   _Nightwing_: Dick Grayson joined the police force as a part of his goal to clean up Blüdhaven. Several story arcs focused on the tension between his superhero activities and what was originally supposed to be a just a cover. One story had Barbara Gordon asking him to visit her wearing the uniform.
    -   GCPD Detective Larry Lance was an attractive Gotham detective for an earlier generation. Larry ended up married to the first Black Canary and fathering the second.
-   _Judge Dredd_:
    -   Psi-Judge Anderson. Made even more blatant by the fact that she's technically in her 50's but often looks like she's in her 20's.
    -   Psi-Judge Karyn. At least, until she becomes possessed. Seems to be a trend among Psi Judges.
    -   Judge (now ex-Judge) Galen DeMarco. A Judge so hot, not only was there someone at her Watch House willing to violate the rule about Judge-Judge relationships, but even Joe Dredd was implied to have been tempted.
    -   Joe Dredd himself has enough of a Heroic Build and Lantern Jaw of Justice to attract at least one stalker, even if we've never seen his face.
    -   Of course, by extension, Dredd's "father" Eustace Fargo, the person he was cloned from, is a Fair Cop himself. He was a rather striking-looking Hunk and a former attorney.
-   Liza Warner, the title character from the _Lady Cop_ comic (see the Other Wiki).
-   Noa of _Last Man Standing_ is one of these.
-   Jennifer Mays from _The Maze Agency_ (actually a PI, but let's not quibble)
-   Vicky Lenore in _Raptors_ is a very gorgeous redhead whose partner Benito Spiaggi has a crush on her, and vampire bombshell Camilla decides to claim her for herself as her "plaything".
-   In the _Sin City_ story _Family Values_, Dwight is hit on by a rather comely female officer. Since Dwight is at that moment on a mission for Old Town with the nearby and concealed Miho, who will kill the cop if anything goes wrong, he pretends to be a Depraved Bisexual to scare her away.
-   _Spider-Man_: Flash Thompson's dad was one; Flash's mom often remarked how handsome he looked in-uniform. Sadly, it was clearly "only skin deep" as he was also an alcoholic who abused both his wife and son.
-   _Viz_: In the one-shot strip _Wayne, Son of Jane_, the title character actually exclaims "It's a fair cop!" when an attractive female constable gives him a ticket.
-   Tract Ais of _White Sand_ is quite pretty, especially compared to other women in the comic.
-   _Witchblade_:
    -   Sara Pezzini. The writers noted that as she was not just an officer but a detective her attractiveness would actually be something of a detriment in many parts of the job. Sara stops being a Fair Cop when she quits the police force in issue 150.
    -   In the new universe Dani is also a police officer for the NYPD.

    Film — Animated 

-   Lucy Wilde of the _Despicable Me_ franchise is a secret agent for the Anti-Villain League who's seen as very attractive by many characters, with no less than five people in her debut film finding her attractive (Gru included).
-   Judy Hopps from _Zootopia_, in contrast to other female officers like Francine and (possibly) Fangmeyer, has a very feminine appearance, Hartman Hips included (justified in that she, as a bunny, has a lot of leg strength and jumps a lot). In a variation, she's not attractive as much as she is adorable (again, being a bunny).

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _Ace Ventura: Pet Detective_ has Lt. Einhorn, whose very introduction is scored by a Sexophone, and Ace is very impressed with her. Although she's not "Fair" in the case of "good", given that Einhorn is the Big Bad, and is using her attractiveness to go beyond suspicion. On just about the entire precinct, if the number of disgusted cops when Ace reveals she is a man says anything.
-   Deputy Rita Marrick in _Army of One_, although given her wardrobe, she is also filling the Ms. Fanservice trope. She starts the movie wearing a Little Black Dress, spends the majority of the film in tight jeans and a crop top, and appears in a form-fitting uniform at the end of the movie in the original ending (though not in the revised one).
-   Foxxy Cleopatra from _Austin Powers_. She shows her badge to Austin and goes, "You have the right to remain sexy, sugar," to which he replies, "Ooh, I hope there's a search involved." Granted that they weren't being serious at the time.
-   _The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans_: The Dirty Cop protagonist hooks up with a hot highway patrol cop he's acquainted with. She even keeps the boots on.
-   _Bedazzled (2000)_: one of the outfits Liz Hurley's devil wears to beguile Brendan Fraser is an attractive female police officer.
-   Officer Kaz Nicol in _Beyond the Lights_ spends a lot of time without a shirt and is certainly not hard on the eyes.
-   In _The Cannonball Run_, upon being pulled over by highway patrol for speeding, Adrienne Barbeau's character attempts to re-use a previous tactic of pulling her driver's license out of her cleavage in order to be let off. In this instance however, it turns out the patrol officer is a female, with a rack just as big as hers.
-   Officer Lindsey Taylor and Officer Ava Perez in _CHIPs_ fill this trope (and their uniform) by the book (though Captain Lindel also gets a honorable mention here).
-   Guard Sally Bishop in _Con Air_ technically fills this trope, even though she is a prison guard and not a police officer. In-universe this proves to be a problem for her once the inmates take over the plane, as there is a convicted rapist on board as well.
-   _Deep in the Valley_: Trapped in a porn movie, Lester and Carl discover that all of the Deep Valley Police Department are this. Lampshaded when Carl even questions if the midriff-exposing tops, short skirts and Combat Stilettos can be regulation uniform.
-   Officer Lenina Huxley, and her usual partner, from _Demolition Man_. Justified, because in _Demolition Man_, the police force had become little more than ornamental, so more attractive officers are probably given preference.
-   _Eight Legged Freaks_: The sheriff is played by Kari Wuhrer, known for many Ms. Fanservice roles. Lampshaded by the horndog teenagers when they call her "the sexiest sheriff in the country".
-   Officer Brian O'Conner from _The Fast and the Furious_ series.
    -   _Fast Five_ introduced Rio police officer Elena Neves, played by Elsa Pataky (aka Mrs. Chris Hemsworth). Lampshaded by Luke Hobbs, who, when asked why he picked her as his "translator", sarcastically replies, "I like her smile".<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Final Destination 2_ has Thomas Burke, a good-looking state trooper.
-   _Fire with Fire_: Talia Durham is a beautiful US Marshal who's assigned to Jeremy when he's put in Witness Protection, and he starts a relationship with her.

-   _Jason Goes To Hell_ has stunning actress/stuntwoman Julie Michaels as FBI Agent Elizabeth Marcus, stripping off for the shower in order to lure Jason Vorhees into a SWAT team ambush.
-   In the German film _Knockin' on Heaven's Door_ (1997) the protagonists get the jump on two police officers. First they order them to hand over their guns. Then they tell them to strip. Cue the male police officer putting on a big grin as he looks over at his partner, who's a hot blonde female (when we later see them tied to a chair, she's wearing sexy lingerie).
-   Jessica Alba from _Machete_ as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Sartana Rivera.
-   Gracie Hart from _Miss Congeniality_. Although she starts as a mess of a woman, her looks are a plot point, since she's the best candidate to go undercover at a beauty pageant despite her unladylike demeanor.
-   "Hottie Police Officer" from _A Night at the Roxbury_. She's played by Jennifer Coolidge, who one year after _Roxbury_, would forever be immortalized as the MILF in _American Pie_.
-   _Scream and Scream Again_ has WPC Helen Bradford who is selected to undercover in the nightclub to go act as bait for the Vampire Killer.
-   _Undercover Heat_: Cindy is already a very attractive young police officer before she gets a Girliness Upgrade. This is the reason her superiors consider her a good choice to go undercover as a prostitute.
-   _We Are the Night_: Tom is a police detective and very handsome.

    Literature 

-   _1Q84_: Ayumi is a beleaguered cop who is forced to take menial, dull work thanks to her sexist colleges. She's young (around Aomame's age) and is quite attractive.
-   Captain Holly Short of the LEP from the _Artemis Fowl_ series. She's also pretty badass, and an elf.
-   In Michael Connelly novels, FBI agents Rachael Walling and Eleanor Wish (briefly) are both considered this.
-   _Crescent City_: Danika serves as a member of Crescent City's Auxiliary and is strikingly pretty.
-   Deborah from _Dexter_. Deconstructed, as it just means she gets to dress up like a hooker for stings.
-   Angua, Salacia 'Sally' von Humpeding, and Carrot Ironfoundersson from the _Discworld_ novels. Carrot's photogenic qualities were once exploited by Vimes in _Thud!_, and Angua initially gets Head-Turning Beauty reactions when she joins up, with half-joking remarks that people would be _queuing up_ to be arrested, which changes - while she doesn't become any less attractive, she tends to scare people via a number of things, such as a habit of intensely staring at peoples' jugulars.
    -   There's also Constable Reg Shoe, who looks quite young for a cop, although the fact he's been a zombie for years makes his appearance a poor indication of how long he's been ali- er, around. (And it's hard to describe him as conventionally attractive, unless undead pallor, visible stitching, and the occasional infestation of carrion eaters are your thing.)
-   _The Dresden Files_: Lt. Karrin Murphy, as well as Connie Murphy, her TV counterpart. In the books, she's petite, being about 5 feet tall, striking a significant contrast with Harry Dresden, whose height is given at between 6'8 _and 6'10_ (he isn't totally consistent, but he can "look down on some people in the NBA"), blonde, blue-eyed, and described as cute. She also once took down an ogre with a chainsaw, while nursing a nasty knee injury. It's noted on more than one occasion that she seems to have become a badass cop to spite her appearance. Unusually for literary examples, the fact that she ages (the series having covered about 12 years so far, and put her through a number of stressful events) is not skimmed over, and it doesn't leave Dresden any less attracted to her.
-   _Girls Don't Hit_:
    -   Shannon, Colin's lover, is a very beautiful, redhaired female police officer.
    -   A couple female detectives in New Orleans whom Joss meets are attractive too.

-   The _In Death_ series:
    -   Eve Dallas is described as one of those people who is very attractive, but puts no effort into it. She has Boyish Short Hair, hates make-up and makeovers with a passion and has incredibly poor fashion sense (her husband fondly remembers the ugly grey suit she wore when they first met like one would remember a spectacular train wreck)... and she's still considered hot, so much that there are a few cases of Even the Girls Want Her. She does get a better wardrobe after marrying a member of the Fiction 500, though.
    -   Troy Trueheart is also very much this. Eve has commented on his hunkiness, and she usually does not seem to notice or care about such things.
-   Isaac Asimov and Janet Asimov's _The Norby Chronicles_: Albany Jones is introduced in the first book, acting on a report of a public disturbance. While Fargo Wells is known to attract women, Albany is the first one he decides to try settling down with. She is also the only member of the cast shown to fight, having learned karate and taught some of it to Jeff off-screen.
-   _Rivers of London_:
    -   PC Lesley May, Peter's friend and World's Most Beautiful Woman… until she gets possessed by the Big Bad, leading to her face falling off near the end of book one, consequently morphing her into a Walking Spoiler.
    -   For a male example, there's minor character PC Omer Kubat, who's so good looking other police never believe he's police even when he's in uniform. He's regularly poached for undercover work.
-   In the _Stephanie Plum_ books, even cop-phobic Lula (a former hooker) thinks Morelli is seriously hot. Most women in the series agree with her — especially, of course, Stephanie (who is in an on-off relationship with him).
-   Arbitor Shira Calpurnia, protagonist of the _Warhammer 40,000: Enforcer_ trilogy.
-   Claudine St. Cyr of the Galactic Police, who works up from Sergeant in novels by Ian Wallace.

    Live-Action TV 

-   All of the undercover cops on _21 Jump Street_. _All of them_.
-   DC Anna Travis from _Above Suspicion_, who is played by a 32 year old actress, but looks 19!
-   _Angel_: In the original plan for the second episode, Kate Lockley was to be introduced as a police officer infiltrating a prostitution ring but had gotten too far into her role and was actually taking drugs and having sex with her clients. In the version that made it to air, she was investigating disappearances from (or hanging out at) a popular singles bar. She would go on to become the Fair Cop love interest and occasional antagonist for Angel Investigations for the first 2 seasons.
-   Detective _Angie Tribeca_ is a female badass police officer and a Parody of the Dirty Harriet archetype.
-   Arrowverse examples:
    -   Detective MacKenna Hall from _Arrow_.
    -   On _Arrow_'s spin-off, _The Flash_, we have Detectives Joe West, Eddie Thawne (who in-universe has gotten the nickname "Detective Pretty Boy"), and Patty Spivot.
    -   DEO Officer (later Director) Alex Danvers and Detective Maggie Sawyer from _Supergirl_, both beautiful.
    -   Crows agent Sophie Moore from _Batwoman_ is very attractive.
-   _Big Sky_: Private detectives, in this case. Cody, Jenny and Cassie are all very good-looking.
-   _The Bill_:
    -   Quite a number of characters, such as Phil Hunter, Zain Nadir, Sam Nixon and Emma Keane.
    -   Especially (age wise) PC Beth Green. On her first appearance, PC Valentine remarked that he "didn't know the station was running a creche". Her actress, Louisa Lytton, was too young to join the real police when she started filming. Lytton won Sexiest Female in the 2005 British Soap Awards- aged _16_. She looks that age now...
    -   One former Inspector was played by a former _lads' mag_ model.
    -   This is ironic given that when _The Bill_ first came out one reviewer praised its realistic look, especially referring to the lack of excessively attractive actors on the show.
-   _Blue Bloods_ has Det. Jackie Curatola in homicide, as well as Det. Melissa Baker as Frank's personal assistant. On the Y side of things, Jamie Reagan looks good in a uniform, and Frank is played by Tom ' 'nuff said' Selleck. Danny Reagan no doubt has some fangirls too.
-   Some rural areas in Australia have a shortage of women. The Victorian town of Mt. Thomas in _Blue Heelers_ just has a shortage of _unattractive_ women if its police force is anything to go by. Besides Sgt. Tom Croydon, the same is generally true of the men.
-   _Brooklyn Nine-Nine_:
    -   Detective Amy Santiago is a very attractive young woman who does get a fair share of attention from men.
    -   Detective Rosa Diaz is easy on the eyes, but in-universe at least her permanently pissed-off attitude means that most of the guys seem to regard her with more fear than desire. Though, that fact doesn't necessarily preclude people from finding her attractive:
        
        **Diaz:** Fear is a powerful aphrodisiac.
        
    -   Detective Jake Peralta is rather attractive and gets a good amount of attention from women. Jake refers to his good looks several times, though it's clear that he's more or less joking.
        
        **Kevin:** Because he's gay, Raymond has been put through hell by his colleagues, many of whom, quite frankly, look exactly like you.  
        **Jake:** Devastatingly handsome?
        
    -   Sergeant Terry Jeffords is very handsome and muscular, and serves as the show's Mr. Fanservice, since a lot of attention is drawn to his biceps in the show. Gina openly lusts after him.
    -   Those Two Guys Hitchcock and Scully are old, lazy and incompetent, but episode "Hitchcock & Scully" reveals they were hunky and handsome enough to make Jake and Charles drool over them, and even had cool nicknames and dropped snappy one-liners after making an arrest.
-   _Californication_: In season 4, Hollywood actress Sasha Bingham is seen starring in a Show Within a Show where she plays a very sexualized cop. Hank Moody appreciates her outfit.
-   _Castle_:
    -   Detective Kate Beckett, played by ex-model Stana Katic. The first episode hangs a lampshade when Castle remarks that an attractive woman like her would under many circumstances opt to become a lawyer rather than a cop if entering law-enforcement, before going on to deduce that the reason Beckett did become a cop is due to something which happened in her past.
    -   The other members of her team, Detectives Esposito<small>◊</small> and Ryan,<small>◊</small> are nothing to sneeze at, either. Once, when interviewing the owner of a talent agency for male strippers, he thought they were there for the tryouts. He encouraged Ryan, but said he had enough guys who look like Esposito, who got offended, mentioning he was previously in an NYPD calendar.
-   Virtually every cop, male and female, from _CHiPs_, Heather Locklear on _T.J. Hooker_, and _Charlie's Angels_ where the three original Angels were all ex-cops.
-   Pretty much the entire Intelligence Unit on _Chicago P.D._, with special mention going to Erin Lindsay, Hailey Upton, Kim Burgess, and Vanessa Rojas.
-   _Class of '09_: Most of the main FBI agent characters are attractive people. The main exception is Tayo, who's both overweight and isn't that handsome.
-   _Cold Case_:
    -   Detective Rush, which is acknowledged in-universe. Notably, her actress gets top billing even though she's not the leader of the team, story-wise.
    -   Detectives Valens and Miller count too.
-   _Chuck_ has Sarah Walker, who is played by the beautiful Yvonne Strahovski. Chuck himself isn't that bad looking either.
-   Crossing over with Real Life, _COPS_ has a list of criteria for who appears on the show, including their service record, camera presence, and yes, looks. Most featured are at least at or slightly above average, but there is the occasional stunner thrown in for good measure.
-   _Criminal Minds_: Pretty much most of the BAU probably qualifies. In particular, Jennifer Jareau and Spencer Reid in a Nerds Are Sexy kind of way.
-   A fair number of characters in the CSI-verse, especially Stella Bonasera from _CSI: NY_, who got hit on by male suspects fairly often.
    -   Vegas offers a bit of justification with Catherine Willows; she used to be a stripper (although bet on the under on the number of strippers-turned-investigators in real life).
    -   If that's not enough fanservice, Bonasera's Kevlar vest has a v-neck to show off her cleavage...and she was once hit on by a female suspect.
    -   Jessica Angell during her run.
    -   On the male side, her Spear Counterpart, Detective Flack.
    -   On _CSI: Miami_, we have Calleigh Duquesne.
-   Galina Sergeevna (Liza Arzamasova) in _Daddy's Daughters_ was briefly one, and looked good in the nice hat and uniform.
-   _Daredevil (2015)_: Ray Nadeem, whose hair many have likened to being that of a Disney prince.
-   _Dark Winds_: Manuelito is a Navajo police officer, Chee an FBI Agent. Both are quite good-looking. Whitover later asks if anyone's told Manuelito she's too beautiful to be a cop, to which she says everyone has.
-   Casey Jones from _Decoy_. One character even calls her "the finest of New York's finest."
-   _Deputy_: Several of the LA Sheriff's Deputies, Joseph chief among them, are attractive people.
-   _Dexter_:
    -   Deb is introduced posing as a prostitute with a Male Gaze panning shot up her body. Almost her first line is complaining about how objectified she feels. She dresses in a very casual and unsexualised way for the entire rest of the show. She's however very pretty and hot, and many a man fancies her.
    -   Dexter is not a cop, but works for Miami Metro PD as a blood spatter expert. He's very handsome.
    -   Sergeant Doakes is a fit and attractive man. Quite scary though.
    -   Quinn is handsome, with his chiselled jaw, and well-built form.
    -   Maria LaGuerta is a voluptuous middle-aged woman.
-   _Doctor Who_
    -   Subverted in "The Eleventh Hour", where the attractive Amy Pond initially appears wearing an improbably short-skirted police uniform. This is shortly revealed to be because she's a _kissogram_, a mostly defunct profession now supplanted by actual strippers.
    -   Thirteenth Doctor companion Yasmin Khan, on the other hand, actually _is_ a police constable.
-   Benton Fraser, in _Due South_. On the American side, both Rays have their admirers in the fanbase.
-   WPC Truelove in _Endeavour_ — young, blonde, brainy and resourceful.
-   Josephina (Jo) Lupo (played by _Erica Cerra_) in _Eureka_. Not to say that Jack Carter (played by _Colin Ferguson_) is all that hard on the eyes...
-   _The Fall (2013)_: With the ladies, there's DSI Stella Gibson and PC Dani Ferrington. With the men, there's DS Tom Anderson and DS James Olson. This is lampshaded variously with Anderson, who Gibson invites to Operation Musicman purely because of his youthful good looks. He is deliberately made to interview Katie Benedetto due to his age, and he also enjoys a one-night stand with Gibson.
-   _The Family (2016)_: Detective Nina Meyer is quite stunning.
-   _Forever_'s Jo Martinez. Alana de la Garza is drop-dead gorgeous, so of course Detective Martinez is an excellent example. The other regular police characters are not quite as amazingly stunning. Lampshaded in "Fountain of Youth" when Henry spells out how beautiful Martinez is by using scientific statistics (i.e., the ideality of the proportions of her facial features). She replies that in her line of work, her looks are more of a liability than an asset.
-   _Gang Related_:
    -   Ryan's quite handsome, and an LAPD detective.
    -   Vee is a very beautiful ICE agent.
-   Both Nick and Renard on _Grimm_ qualify, and Hank has his admirers. Even Wu can be pretty appealing.
-   Almost _every single main character_ on ABC's _High Incident_. Notable examples include this guy(whose character actually had a moustache.) And this one. And this one. Played with in the form of Officer Tops, who is a fat, balding guy, and his younger, good-looking partner. Guess which one's the family man? Not Tops.
-   Many of the officers in the Spanish cop show _Los Hombres de Paco_, including one ironic/hilarious episode where three of the female officers go undercover at a strip club, two of whom actually wear stripper cop outfits.
-   The later seasons of _Homicide: Life on the Street_ suffered from some unpopular characters like this, especially so since they replaced members of the original realistically-homely cast.
    -   Det. Rene Sheppard, (portrayed by Michael Michele) in season 7, had a beautiful face.
    -   Even with this shameful display at trying to get more viewers, the original (or at least older) cast was nothing to sneeze at. Bayliss, Felton, Lewis, Kellerman for starters. Hell, even Andre Braugher (Pembleton) was once voted one of People Magazine's 50 Most Beautful People!
-   _Haven_:
    -   The show features FBI agent and police officer Audrey Parker, an absurdly attractive blonde woman who gains the attention of several men throughout the series.
    -   On the male side of things, there's Nathan Wuornos. He works as an officer alongside Audrey and is quite handsome.
-   _Hightown_: Jackie and Leslie are both good-looking women, becoming partners after the former joins the Providence police. Ray, also a detective with them starting out, is rather ruggedly handsome.
-   _Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha_: Choi Eun-chul, an upstanding local policeman. Mi-seon is attracted to him from his first appointment at the clinic, and later comments that he looks much better in uniform.
-   In _Hunter (1984)_, Det. Sgt. DeeDee McCall is very good-looking and usually well-dressed as well. Her good looks make her a good candidate for Dirty Harriet missions. It also attracts attention from some less than desirable quarters.
-   _How I Met Your Mother_: Barney repeatedly and deliberately gets himself stopped for speeding by a beautiful motorcycle policewoman in order to attempt to seduce her but ends up tasered and arrested instead.
-   _The Indian Detective_: Christina Cole and Gia Sandhu, two very beautiful actresses, play Toronto Police Service and Canadian Border Services Agency officers. Scott Cavalheiro, playing a TPS detective, is a male example too.
-   _Intergalactic_: Ash, a police officer, is a quite pretty young woman.
-   _L.A.'s Finest_: The two protagonists Syd and Nancy are quite beautiful female detectives (respectively played by Gabrielle Union and Jessica Alba).
-   Most _Law & Order_ detectives, as well as some of the captains.
    -   _Law & Order: Special Victims Unit_'s Det. Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay), who is frequently seen wearing low-cut shirts and Painted-On Pants, and who provides the image for this page. Hargitay has a remarkable resemblance to her mother, 1950s blonde bombshell actress Jayne Mansfield (although Mansfield was actually dark-haired; her platinum blonde hair was a dye job).
    -   Benson seems to be getting a run for her money with Amanda Rollins, whose actress (Kelli Giddish) is so pretty that Stephanie March joked she was 'trying to get her fired'. Rollins often exploits this trope and is very talented at being the Honey Trap.
    -   On _Law & Order: Organized Crime_ Det. Jet Slootmaekers' a very good-looking young woman who is now a police detective. In Season 3 she really dolls herself up while going undercover, wearing beautiful dresses including ones with navel deep necklines.
    -   Given that he's played by the _epitome_ of Mr. Fanservice, Jamie Bamber, this was a given for DS Matt Devlin of _Law & Order: UK_.
    -   Det. Ed Green (played by Jesse L. Martin), earns a fair number of points for supplying the sexy voice, tall stature and (albeit rarely seen) beautiful smile.
    -   Det. Nina Cassady (portrayed by Milena Govich), who got her press nickname "Detective Beauty Queen" after her role in a shootout at a beauty parlor.
    -   Who can forget the franchise's prime example of fairness AND fanservice, Elliott Stabler?
-   _Liar (2017)_: DI Vanessa is quite attractive. Her colleague, undercover detective Charlotte, is as well (it's weaponized in her case to lure in a suspect).
-   Crews and Reese, the main characters of _Life (2007)_, are both ridiculously good-looking.
-   _Life on Mars_… where do we start? Well, DC Chris Skelton is definitely in the running, as is WPC Annie Cartwright. Then there's Sam Tyler, who seems to wear a _lot_ of skin-tight shirts with very at least three buttons undone (his neck has a lot of fans). And then there's DCI Gene Hunt. Search 'Gene Hunt is sexy' and see how many hits you get. Spin-off _Ashes to Ashes (2008)_ adds DI Alex Drake, who gets a hell of a lot of Ms. Fanservice moments right from the beginning, as well as WPC Shaz Granger.
-   _Lip Service_: Sam is a good-looking woman who's a Glasgow police constable.
-   _Lucifer_: Chloe Decker, who had a short-lived acting career when she was younger before becoming a police officer. Lampshaded in one episode when she attempts to arrest a suspect, but the suspect mistakes it for an elaborate prank because he knew about her acting career but not about her police career. That, and also her partner introduced himself as Lucifer Morningstar.
-   _Manifest_:
    -   Jared Vasquez is definitely this, courtesy of the handsome J.R. Ramirez.
    -   And for those who like women, Michaela isn't hard to watch either.
-   _Miami Vice_: Crockett and Tubbs, Trudy and Gina.
-   _Mohawk Girls_: Thunder is a very handsome man who's also a peacekeeper (i.e. a member of the Mohawk band's police force).
-   _Murdoch Mysteries_:
    -   Detective Murdoch. He's a man of dark and mysterious beauty and wears a sharp suit. Quite a few women in-universe fancy him, much to his embarrassment.
    -   Constable George Crabtree is something of a Plucky Comic Relief character, but he's good-looking in his uniform. There are some Ship Teases for him with several characters, and as of season 6, he dates the gorgeous Dr. Emily Grace.
    -   Constable Higgins is a minor character and appears mainly paired with George, but he is decidedly handsome and has a sweet smile.
-   Several members of the cast of _NCIS_, notably Tony, Ziva and Kate.
-   _New York Undercover_ to varying degrees and more realistic than the model-types frequently seen on other police shows, but overall, a very good-looking collection of officers.
-   _NTSF:SD:SUV::_: Agent Piper Ferguson primarily spoofs the "tough-as-nails but hot female cop" that frequently show up in procedural crime dramas. She always wears Painted-On Pants and tight-fittting clothing on the job that enhances her figure while kicking ass.
-   _NYPD Blue_:
    -   A prime male example is Det. Baldwin Jones, who is not only good-looking but very tall, athletic and well-toned. He has many Shirtless Scenes to show off his body. His good looks are useful when interviewing women, who tend to open up more to him than his more average-looking colleagues, though it sometimes backfires when female witnesses get so Distracted by the Sexy that they can't concentrate on their statements.
    -   Det. Bobby Simone deserves a mention as well, being played by the very handsome Jimmy Smits.
    -   More or less all the female cops on the show are very good-looking. Some notable examples are detectives Russell (who has several nude scenes), Kirkendall and Ortiz.
-   _Once Upon a Time_ has Emma Swan herself as Storybrooke's sheriff after Sheriff Graham was killed by Regina's magic. Not that Graham was a slouch in the looks department to begin with. Then after she leaves town temporarily, she passes the position of sheriff to her father. Who is the original Prince Charming, and thanks to certain magical shenanigans, is only a couple of years older than Emma.
-   _Patriot_: Agetha is an attractive, blond homicide detective in Luxembourg. The entire homicide department is female, because Luxembourg usually has zero murders per year, and they've all been Kicked Upstairs by their chauvinist male comrades, who derisively refer to Homicide as the Department of Skirts and Stockings.
-   _Picket Fences_ has Deputies Max (Lauren Holly) and Kenny (Costas Mandylor) who are both young and extremely attractive. They also appear to be the most senior officers under Sheriff Jimmy Brock, despite there clearly being older and considerably more average looking deputies in the background of the Rome Sheriff's Department. They're also each other's primary love interest.
-   The 1970s series _Police Woman_ had Pepper Anderson (played by Angie Dickinson). Many of her missions made use of her good looks to get close to male crime bosses.
-   _Psych_:
    -   Detective Juliet "Jules" O'Hara.
    -   Averted with her partner, Detective Lassiter whom is frequently said to resemble Mr. Bean.
    -   There's also Buzz McNab, who was moonlighting as a stripper for extra cash.
-   Leslie in _Republic of Doyle_.
-   _Rizzoli & Isles_: Jane Rizzoli, played by the smokin' hot Angie Harmon, and her brother Frankie Jr.
-   _The Rookie_: Lucy, Jackson, Nyla and Tim are all very good-looking. It's lampshaded in "Brave Heart" when someone comments that Tim and Nyla look more like models than police officers.
-   Though their uniforms are unisex and quite authentic, the main cast of _Rookie Blue_ is the definition of this trope.
-   The Major Crime Unit of Cascade, WA's police department in _The Sentinel_. Especially Det. Rafe.
-   _Shades of Blue_: Hollywood Beauty Standards are very much at play at 64th precinct, with almost all of the officers there being very attractive, with protagonist Harlee herself being the show's Ms. Fanservice.
-   Disney Channel's _Shake it Up_ has Georgia Jones, who happens to earn a living walking the beat.
-   _Sherlock_ has one of each gender. For those who like men, there's Silver Fox DI Lestrade, who, like most of the male cast, wears well-tailored suits. For those who like women, there's DS Sally Donovan, who's got legs and the gun to back them up.
-   The late '80s brought us Sheriff Hildy Granger, played by the sexy, sassy Suzanne Somers, in the syndicated sitcom _She's the Sheriff._
-   Ofc. Tina Hanlon on _The Shield_, which becomes an issue when Dutch Wagenbach falls hard for her.
-   _Six Feet Under_: Keith.
    
    **Keith:** Most of the men I meet - well, they kinda only want me to be one thing.  
    **Claire:** What, big black sex cop? "Sorry I was speeding, officer, I guess you have to punish me now?"  
    **Keith:** Yeah, and I don't wanna be that. Rent a video!
    
-   Lt. Abbie Mills from _Sleepy Hollow_ is in no way, shape or form a pain to watch.
-   Deputy Chief Hale and ATF Agent Stahl are male and female examples respectively on _Sons of Anarchy_.
-   _Squid Game_: Cowboy Cop Hwang Jun-ho, to the point that he catches the eye of a particularly amorous VIP.
-   The audience (and the camera) certainly appreciated _Starsky & Hutch's_ tight, tight jeans — among other fanservice such as Shower Scene or Sexy Soaked Shirt.
-   In the _Supernatural_ episode "Devil May Care" (S09, Ep02), Sam and Dean, who are posing as FBI agents, are described as "pretty-boy agents".
-   _S.W.A.T. (2017)_: Most of the team are quite good-looking. This is lampshaded in "Homecoming" when Chris, Street and Tan are getting photographed for a publicity piece, where a reporter (who's a very attractive blonde woman too) notes all of them are quite photogenic. It continues to be the case with many other cops, the women especially.
-   _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_:
    -   Though Cameron isn't a cop, in one episode she dons a motorcycle cop's uniform. Thus, we have Summer Glau, in a cop's uniform...
    -   Trevor, Kacey's baby-daddy, is this to Kacey, who met him while working in a fancy donut shop in LA. Once she gets pregnant, though, her attraction to him cools.
-   In _That '70s Show_, Kelso became a police officer specifically to invoke this.
-   _Tidelands (Netflix)_: Corey is a very handsome young police officer.
-   Heather Locklear got her first regular TV role as a uniformed LAPD officer on _T.J. Hooker_.
    -   See also Adrian Zmed as Officer Vince Romano. They both (separately) went undercover as strippers (her UC made the opening credits; his did not).
-   _Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger_:
    -   The whole main team are, or look, rather ridiculously young for an elite group, and are all extremely pretty.
    -   Not just the main five. Tetsu, one-shots Mari and Lisa, and older-but-still-hot Wrench Wench Swan aren't half bad, either. The chief, a Muppet\-looking jackal from the planet Anubis, on the other hand... gets way more Rule 34 than everyone else put together.
    -   Their American counterparts are pretty easy on the eye themselves.
-   _Torchwood_ has Gwen Cooper and PC Andy.
-   Russian Forensic Drama _Trace_ has pretty much ALL of female cast qualifying to this trope. You can see it yourself.
-   _Twin Peaks_:
    -   Special Agent Dale Cooper is _very_ easy on the eyes. It's easy to see why Audrey Horne is so taken with him.
    -   Season 3 introduces Agent Tammy Preston, who is young, attractive, and subject to scenes of Eating the Eye Candy. FBI Chief of Staff Denise Bryson suspects that this is the reason why Deputy Director Gordon Cole put her on his team.
-   An in-universe example in _Two and a Half Men_ with Kandi played by April Bowdry getting a part in a CSI expy.
-   Amber Tamblyn was undercover as a prostitute at the start of the pilot episode of _The Unusuals_. The undercover part ended after about two minutes of showtime, but she didn't get a chance to change her clothes until later in the episode. She looked fine either way.
-   Stella Goodman and Mel Silver in _Waking The Dead 2010_.
-   Lt. Dawn Lerner (Christine Woods) in Season 5 of _The Walking Dead_ overlapping with Arc Villain.
-   While most of the cast of _Whitechapel_ are pretty normal looking (though not unattractive), the show also has tall, blond and handsome DI Joe Chandler, and the adorable youngest team member DC Emerson Kent (nicknamed DC Bambi by some fans).
-   _The Wire_:
    -   Lt. Cedric Daniels, a lean and statuesque officer.
    -   Jimmy McNulty is something of a manwhore. He's a very handsome manly man.
    -   Kima Greggs is a female example. She has a pretty face and is very slim. She is somewhat unusual for the trope since she is a butch lesbian who doesn't seem to care much for traditional male ideas of female beauty.
-   Undercover fed Vincent Terranova of _Wiseguy_ was remarkably good-looking, so much so that it ought to have tipped somebody off that he's not the hardened criminal he pretends to be. A real lifelong gangster would most likely have gotten his face smacked around at some point — especially as the character is a Golden Gloves boxer.
-   Pretty much all of the FBI agents on _Without a Trace_, but Martin Fitzgerald and Samantha Spade arguably take the cake
-   _Wonder Woman (1975)_: Carolyn Hamilton (played by Jayne Kennedy) in "Knockout" is a beautiful former cop who kidnaps Steve Trevor rather than letting him be killed because of a debt she owes him in her former profession.
-   _The X-Files_:
    -   Mulder. Tall, dark, handsome, troubled, frequently shirtless or working out...
    -   Scully. She started as a cute young woman, and ended a complete knock-out. Somewhere around season 4, they stopped dressing her down and she started to wear tighter clothes.
    -   In the fanfic world, there's also a sizable block thinking Skinner is hot. There is a segment of one of the gag reels that features him stripping down to his skivvies to "I'm Too Sexy". He had quite a few Mr. Fanservice moments.
        -   In Real Life, several behind-the-scenes articles about the series discuss the fact that Mitch Pileggi, the actor who played Skinner, got a great deal of attention from female cast and crew during filming.

    Music 

-   Lovely Rita, the meter maid of The Beatles' song.
-   Although the song itself isn't about this, Beyoncé wearing a policewoman's uniform in the video for "If I Were a Boy" qualifies.
-   Lil Wayne's "Mrs. Officer".
-   "I Want to Be Raided by You" by Cole Porter: _When he shakes his stick, I get the kind of kick I thought was obsolete._
-   The Red Hot Chili Peppers song "Sir Psycho Sexy" depicts an incident with one of these, as well as various other conquests.
-   "Women in Uniform" by Australian band The Skyhooks:
    
    Beehive hairdo, 45 on the hip  
    Patrolwoman Saunders don't you give her no lip  
    Took me to the station for a breath test  
    Then back to her bedroom for some house arrest
    
-   "You've got that vibe" by R Kelly features a beautiful model in NYPD uniform twirling her nightstick.
-   "Day n nite" by Kid Cudi has him serving a beautiful female police officer whilst working at a flling station and fantasising about her as a dancing dominatrix.
-   "This Afternoon" by Nickleback has a beautiful female police officer called to noisy party who eventually strips to her fancy underwear and joins in the fun.
-   "Pump the Jam" by Technotronic features a dominatrix style beautiful female cop who joins in the dancing rather than trying to clear the congestion.

    Video Games 

-   In _Detective Pikachu Returns_, two female citizens of Ryme City gush about how attractive they find local policeman Brad McMasters to be.
-   Emily in _Deadly Premonition_ is quite a looker.
-   Julie Kidman in _The Evil Within_:
    -   Also Sebastian Castellanos and Joseph Oda
-   _Far Cry 5_ is also not short on characters fitting this trope, given the fact that the player character and its closest allies are members of the local sheriff department. While the elder Sheriff Whitehorse is more closer to a Reasonable Authority Figure, the customizable player character and his/her fellow deputies fit this trope by the book (Deputy Pratt as the male version, Deputy Hudson as the female, and the Cowboy Cop protagonist as either of these, depending on their sex chosen at the beginning of the campaign). Marshall Burke is a bit of a mixed bag: while he's also rather handsome, the narrative goes great lengths to emphasize his Lawful Stupid and Dirty Coward personality instead.
-   Lucia Morgan from _Final Fight 3_.
-   _Ghost Trick_ has Lynne, a pretty teenage redhead who has just been named detective. She seems to attract the eyes and occupy the thoughts of some male officers. One of them even falls in Love at First Sight with her.
-   _Ginga Fukei Densetsu Sapphire_ has a cast of pretty young policewomen in form-fitting suits.
-   _Half-Life 2_: Barney Calhoun as a Metro Cop in City 17 has more than his fair share of fan girls.
-   _League of Legends_:
    -   Caitlyn, the Sherrif of Piltover. Her "Officer Caitlyn" skin ramps up the sexy, making her look more like a stripper wearing a "sexy policewoman" costume than a real lawbringer. Eventually Riot got a bit embarrassed by this and remodeled her to play down the blatant sexiness of her outfits, with her Officer skin replacing the stripper outfit with something an actual police officer would wear.
    -   Her partner Vi, the Piltover Enforcer eventually received a matching skin. She at least gets pants rather than a miniskirt thanks to being a bruiser rather than a marksman, but if anything her boobs are even BIGGER.
-   _Like a Dragon_:
    -   Kaoru Sayama from _Yakuza 2_ is a beautiful young detective who manages to win the heart of series protagonist Kiryu. She even gets a fanservice scene where Kiryu walks in on her after she's showered, much to his awkwardness.
    -   Masayoshi Tanimura from _Yakuza 4_ is a Pretty Boy detective, with women frequently flirting with him and thugs often disparaging him for his looks. His remastered appearance, due to having to change his likeness, has a different haircut and a goatee that make him more ruggedly handsome, with various "pretty boy" remarks instead changed to people mistaking him for a host or an actor instead of a cop.
-   You encounter a few asari police in _Mass Effect_, especially when you visit Illium in _2_. Detective Anaya gets special mention on the grounds that she gets the most screentime.
-   Officer Patricia Wagon of the _Mighty Switch Force!_ is not uncomely.
-   _The Misadventures of Tron Bonne_, a spinoff of _Mega Man Legends_ has Denise Marmalade, a cute rookie cop who tries (but fails) to arrest Tron several times during the game.
-   Kurtis Stryker in _Mortal Kombat_. Also, his partner Kabal was pretty handsome too, before his Emergency Transformation, as _Mortal Kombat 9_ shows.
-   Aya Brea from _Parasite Eve_ has quite a few admirers over the course of the game series, including her nameless date at the beginning of the series, Maeda, Pierce, and Kyle.
-   _Persona 2_ gives us Tatsuya's older brother, Katsuya, who is stated to be the target of all the women on the force's affection. It's stated in a TV program on 3 that Tatsuya himself became a cop.
-   The _Resident Evil_ series loves this trope and features numerous extremely attractive officers over the course of the franchise. Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Albert Wesker, and Rebecca Chambers are all very easy on the eyes, with the second game introducing fan-favorite Pretty Boy Leon S. Kennedy.
-   _Silent Hill: Downpour_:
    -   Anne Cunningham.
    -   The _Silent Hill_ series also has Cybil Bennett, who appears in several of the games. The trope was played to its hilt in the film's portrayal of her.

-   _Street Fighter II_: Chun Li is an agent of Interpol's Chinese branch, who according to Word of God, is the most beautiful woman in _Street Fighter's_ canon. Some of her quotes in later games reflect this. (For example, demanding Yoshimitsu's ID and fighting him to confiscate the sword, and arresting her defeated opponent for "interfering with official Interpol business and destruction of public property".
-   Lt. Christine Malone from the _TimeSplitters_ series. According to the game, her impeccable arrest record is enough to make her chest swell with pride.
-   In the PC-98 exclusive _Touhou Yumejikuu ~ Phantasmagoria of Dim. Dream_, the maniacal princess Kotohime fancies herself a police officer, though the other characters' reactions suggest it's just one of her delusions. Win the game as her, and in a post-game cutscene she'll even wear a uniform.
-   _Urban Rivals_ has plenty of these, mostly in Sentinel. Chloe and Aurelia stand out, and Miranda is a fetish version.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Ace Attorney_: Maggey Byrde is a Meganekko who is considered very pretty by several characters, though this trope only applies in her first appearance since she's fired from the force at the end of the game, and in later games she's no longer a cop.
-   _Metro PD: Close to You_ is a Romance Game set in the Special Investigations 2nd Unit. As all of the detectives in the unit (as well as several others from other units) are all prospective love interests, it should come to no one's surprise that all of them are smoking hot.
-   While Ooe from _Spirit Hunter: NG_ isn't a Ms. Fanservice, her half-lidded eyes, buttoned-down shirt, and husky voice make her seem sultry. Once she joins up with the group, she makes a couple jokes about Akira being attracted to her, much to his annoyance.

    Webcomics 

-   The Webcomic _Girly_ has a very lampshaded version in the form of Officer Hipbone (note her name, and note her most noticeable physical trait), and Policeguy is considered one of this - The Casanova had mistaken him for a pretty woman before his haircut.
-   _I'm the Grim Reaper_: Chase is a detective (one on leave) and is very pretty. He even gets a (sort of) shirtless scene.
-   _Lackadaisy_: Tracy's rendering of FBI agent Dom as a human squarely points to him being Tall, Dark, and Handsome.
-   In _SwordCat Princess_, Detective Erica Richards is attractive enough that she has previously posed nude for Pleb Boi (the in-universe analogue of Playboy magazine); she keep a framed copy of the magazine cover on her desk.
-   In _Unsounded_, Captain Toma's heroic exploits won him recognition, but his good looks caught the interest of a noblewoman who later married him. This proves to be a poor foundation for a successful marriage.
-   Parodied with Officer McSexy of _War and Peas_, a cop who is both very sexy and very flirtatious. Posing in front of a criminal distracts him long enough to arrest the criminal, who even hits on him on the way to the police car.
-   Justin of _Wapsi Square_ is a male example. While he's more cute in a dorky way than straight-up attractive, the comic's female characters certainly think he fits. One is dating him, and another has a crush on him.

    Web Original 

-   Whateley Academy security officer Samantha Everheart. Not only is she a hot blonde, but she looks like she seventeen, despite the fact that technically she is old enough to be retired from the U.S. Navy. As an admiral.
-   Detectives Winters and Martinez of _Where the Bears Are_.

    Western Animation 

-   _Arcane_: Vi explicitly calls rogue enforcer Caitlyn "hot" and both a male and a female patron at a brothel seem enamored with her.
-   Ellen Yin in _The Batman_.
-   A Dirty Harriet from the _Beavis And Butthead_ episode "Feel a Cop".
-   _Bojack Horseman_: Officer Meow-Meow Fuzzyface, at least if you're into attractive Funny Animals.
-   Miranda Wright from _Bonkers_.
-   There's a few DCAU ones- Renee Montoya, Maggie Sawyer, Sonia Alcana, Caroline Greenway, Selma Reesedale, anybody not named Harvey Bullock or Dan Turpin. Also, Harley Quinn disguises herself as one in "Joker's Favor". (Or maybe she's posing as a stripper in a police costume. Her first appearance, incidentally.)
-   Rosie O'Gravy from _Dog City_.
-   _Futurama_: Colleen, Fry’s love interest in _The Beast with a Billion Backs_ is revealed to be this when she and her fellow officers are ordered by Nixon to beat up Farnsworth and Wernstrom for protesting the DOOP being sent at the anomaly.
-   Elisa Maza and Captain Chavez from _Gargoyles_. Or, for male examples, you've got Matt Bluestone and Morgan Morgan.
-   _The Legend of Korra_: When it was revealed that Mako is going to be a cop in Season 2, fans of him were ecstatic, with reactions to the rough sketches ranging from "I'm so excited" to "THERE GOES MY OVARIES."
-   Pizzaz (definitely), Chrysalis (in her own bookish way), and several other (unnamed) female officers from _Moonbeam City_.
-   In _The Simpsons_, Monty Burns falls for Gloria (usually depicted as Snake's girlfriend) on Flag Day as she is giving him a parking ticket. Marge probably counts as one in the episode where she becomes a cop. As for the male officers, Lou doesn't look so bad.
-   Felina and Ulysses Feral in _SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron_ are sexy as hell.
-   Evans from _World of Winx_. (A given, considering World of Winx is a spinoff of _Winx Club_.)
-   Luba from _Yvon of the Yukon_. Besides being the sexiest woman in Upyermukluk, she is the _only_ kind of law enforcement in the town as its sheriff.
