_The Cardsharps_ (ca. 1594) by Caravaggio

_"Trust me, son. When _**I**_ play cards, it ain't gambling."_

Quick hands. The prestidigitator member of a con team, who sometimes works alone. Frequently, the tricks he pulls have to do with manipulating playing cards, hence the name, but a team will sometimes call on a card sharp to make a tricky switch, "dip" a pocket, or put up a fancy misdirection. Likely a Hustler, their favorite routine is Hustling the Mark into getting their guard down enough to make a foolish bet.

May or may not be a Death Dealer. Compare Professional Gambler. Has a good chance of getting into a Gambling Brawl or being hit with Tar and Feathers.

"Card _Shark_" is a variant of the term which doesn't always imply cheating, just a penchant for playing cards. Often in the US it refers to the professional gambler who focuses on card games.

    Anime and Manga 

-   Both Firo and Keith Gandor from _Baccano!_. Firo's picked up enough tricks from managing an underground casino that not only can he slip cards in and out with the best of them, but can pick marks well enough that he can nearly sweep a casino without cheating at all. Keith, on the other hand, cheats so much and so blatantly that he has a deck of cards composed entirely of jokers.
-   In _Cowboy Bebop_
    -   Faye is highly skilled in conning people in a game of cards (also dice, though then she just flat-out cheats with rigged dice).
    -   Spike's no slouch either and was able to spot Faye's con a mile away.
-   Protagonist Allen Walker from _D.Gray-Man_ is an expert at cheating in cards due to the horrible experiences with debt he had from being with General Cross.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_: Daniel J. D'Arby, one of the villains in Part 3, is a gambler who specializes in this. He considers cheating just part of the game, fully expecting his opponents to cheat as well. Unlike most, however, he prefers rigging the entire game _well_ before any cards are dealt. Jotaro defeats him by bluffing so perfectly that what's actually _in_ their hands doesn't matter... which is good, because Jotaro had _crap_.
-   Unsurprisingly, comes up frequently in both _Kaiji_ and _Akagi_.
-   Nearly every major character in _The Legend of Koizumi_ is able to cheat at Mahjong in some way.
-   In _Liar Game_, the 17-Card Poker game becomes a battle of _dueling_ card sharps: Akiyama uses skill and strategy, while his opponent uses superhuman reflexes honed from an aborted career in boxing to track the cards.
-   In _No Matter How I Look at It, It's You Guys' Fault I'm Not Popular!_, the socially awkward protagonist Tomoko cheats at a trading card game. Against _kids_. And she's a _high-schooler_. Her cousin is not impressed.
-   Gojyo in _Saiyuki_ frequently cheats at cards. Hakkai can still beat him though, so one wonders if his playing style is completely orthodox.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_: Bandit Keith tends to use this method of cheating. In his semi-finals duel with Joey, he slips his "7 Completed" cards out of his wristbands (which Pegasus notes and later explains after Joey wins the duel), and in his anime-only duel with Yugi, he keeps cards in a special gadget kept up his sleeve.

    Comic Books 

-   In _Fables_ Jack has the ability to draw into four Jacks anytime he wishes during a poker game. The trick is to only do so only with a very large pot since it only works with four Jacks and his opponents would catch on if he tries it a second time during a game.
-   Though it rarely comes up as a plot point, the lead G.I. Joe pilot, Capt. Brad Armbruster, didn't get his codename Ace from being a top pilot, but rather from his love of cutthroat poker. His superiors look the other way regarding his gambling habit, since he's not only that good a pilot, he's not really "gambling" at poker since he _never loses_.
-   A recurring character type in _Lucky Luke_, either seen at the edge of a poker table or being on top of a rail being escorted out of town after the requisite Tar and Feathers.

-   Quite a few sharps in _Maverick_ got caught cheating during the big riverboat poker tournament (the penalty for which was being tossed overboard). The dealer at the final table was also one, surreptitiously dealing from the bottom of the deck (this is known as "base/bottom dealing", by the by).
-   Clark Gable's character Babe in _No Man of Her Own (1932)_.
-   Matt Damon's character facilitates this role in the _Ocean's_ trilogy. Also, Brad Pitt and George Clooney clean out a poker school of celebrities in the first movie.
    
    **Ocean:** Cause yesterday I walked out of the joint after losing four years of my life and you're cold-decking "Teen Beat" cover-boys.

Worm doesn't listen, and a group of cops beat the ever-loving piss out of them both and confiscate tens of thousands in winnings before kicking them to the curb.
-   The Dean, Vernon and Larry in the poker film _Shade (2003)_. Larry tries to cheat a poker game only to lose his mob boss's money (and shortly thereafter his life). The game was a con to steal the boss's money. The Dean and Vernon each use their skills in the film's final hand, with Vernon's three Jack's losing to Dean's three Queens. It's a con designed to bankrupt Vernon's partners Tiffany and Frank, who had each betrayed him in different ways.

    Literature 

-   From _The Crystal_ there's Saern, a sorcerer, who apparently cheats using both magical means and mundane. Don't bother catching him at it, he'll act offended and fireball you.
-   In the _Discworld_ series:
    -   In _Witches Abroad_, the witches run into some, but Granny manages to beat them without cheating or using magic, and supposedly without having played the game (the incredibly complicated Cripple Mr. Onion) before. She'd actually played it quite a bit while caring for a sick witch, but used her newcomer image for an advantage.
    -   Moist von Lipwig created an alter ego to be this. Subverted in that the character was quite awful at being a card sharp, fumbling and missing golden opportunities to cheat. And when the mark left away, gleeful at having conned such a pathetic charlatan, they'd find that the few coins they'd swiped didn't make up for the wallets and watches they were now missing. And to add insult to injury, the coins are fake.
-   In the _Gentleman Bastard_ series, the eponymous Locke Lamora successfully cheats in the safest gambling place in the world, where the mere act of cheating carries the death penalty.
-   Believe it or not, this was James Bond's _original_ specialty - though he's certainly no slouch at fighting, killing, and seducing, the plot of his first book _Casino Royale_ was all about _out-gambling_ a Soviet agent. His card-sharping skills come in even handier during _Moonraker_.
-   Fisk from the _Knight and Rogue Series_ is rather good at card tricks, though he usually sticks to cons that he can get more money out of and sneak away from easier. Unfortunately this skill doesn't see a whole lot of use. For Michael's sake, he'll usually stick to betting on whether or not he _can_ do a trick than actually tricking people.
-   The Lacework Kid, from Damon Runyon's story of the same name. ("Lacework" refers to his artistry with cards.)
-   Subverted in _River of Teeth_. Cal Hotchkiss is introduced as a potential member of the Caper Crew Houndstooth is about to assemble and as someone who makes his living at the cards table. He then quickly proceeds to have his left ear cut off for being caught cheating and eventually is thrown to the feral hippos to die because he never learns his lesson. As it turns out, Houndstooth didn't want him for his nimble fingers but for his connections.
-   In _Time Scout_, Skeeter's as much a master at cheating with cards as he is with any other cheat. Picking pockets is just another part of the game.
-   Feodor Dolokhov in _War and Peace_.
-   _The Way Of Kings_ (first book of _The Stormlight Archive_): Yalb, a sailor from Shallan's ship. He plays against cops, and he mentioned that the game isn't who will win, the game is will he cheat them out of their money or will they prove he was cheating, take all of his money and throw him in jail for the night to boot?

-   Magnificent Bastard Arnold Rothstein from _Boardwalk Empire_ gets his Establishing Character Moment by showing that he's a first rate poker player... and more than capable of cheating and getting away with it due to his connections on the occasions when that alone isn't enough. Keep that in mind, it sums up a lot about Rothstein's character.
-   Mr Terence Sampson in _Downton Abbey_ is invited to the Abbey in Series 4 for a big house party, where he cheats Lord Grantham, Michael Gregson, and a few others out of substantial sums at poker. Gregson figures him out, and counters with the same technique (which he picked up in his "misspent youth"), winning back not only his losses but those of Grantham and the other guests (which he promptly returns to the respective players, particularly Grantham). Later, in the Series 4 Christmas special, he steals a love letter from the Prince of Wales to Freda Dudley Ward; the Crawleys invite Sampson to a game of poker at Grantham House as part of a scheme to get the letter back and protect the Prince from scandal.
-   _Heroes_: Hiro tries this with his time-altering super-powers at one point. Unfortunately for him, someone notices the switch, because he switched the cards after his opponent had already seen them.
-   In _Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger_, both Joe and Luka are very skilled poker players, but Joe insists that Luka can _never_ lose if she doesn't want to. When events lead to Luka and Joe playing poker against the Zangyak Empire, Luka proves her skills with shifty dealing to cheat their way to victory.

It ends up being a Chekhov's Skill when during the climax of the episode he is forced to play Russian Roulette and is able to take the bullet out of the gun without anyone noticing.
-   T-Bag in _Prison Break_. Claims that maybe 5 people in the country can do what he can with cards. It's only significant in one episode, however.

-   A G-rated version appears in an episode of _The Suite Life of Zack & Cody_, in which a little girl scams Maddie out of all of her candy by getting her obsessed with trying to pick the right card. Then again, aforementioned little girl's father was pretending to be injured in order to get a free hotel room, so yeah.

-   The hucksters of _Deadlands_ find their lives last longer if they minor in _sleight o' hand_, as a little legerdemain goes a long way in convincing the Torches and Pitchforks crowd that, no, you didn't just summon spectral cards into your hand and use them to channel a stream of ghostly-white energy at your opponent. It was a trick of the light and nothing more. Some "hexes", like _trinkets_, even go so far as to allow a huckster to summon small objects literally from thin air into his hands, furthering the use of one as a Card Sharp con man.
