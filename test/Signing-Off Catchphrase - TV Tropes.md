Wise words that the average TV Tropes user should take to heart.

_"Good night, and good luck."_

— **Edward R. Murrow**, legendary CBS news anchor

You know the drill: every episode ends. You can't continue a TV show without it! There's always this one catchphrase that you'll always hear, and it has a nice ring.

Simply put, catchphrases are phrases that the character uses a lot during his or her dialogue in order to convey his or her message. But a catchphrase can be important to a character, as it can show their personality. And also, they might say a catchphrase that they'll mostly use at the end. This is very common in News Broadcasts, to help set the reporters and anchors apart from the crowd. It can also be used sometimes to tel the viewers they aren't leaving yet. Also, they might use this trope in children's shows so the kids can still remember them. Like every catchphrase, once they say it, it always stays with their personality.

I think this is enough time when we say, "That's all folks!" I think that catchphrase was already used though...

It can often overlap with That's All, Folks! (if it's the outright end of the show) or The Stinger.

A Sister Trope to "On the Next Episode of..." Catch-Phrase, Ending Theme.

Seems like we've just begun when suddenly we're through. Goodbye, goodbye, good friends, goodbye, 'cause now it's time to go. But hey, I say, well that's OK, 'cause we'll see you very soon, I know (very soon, I know).

-   _Chockablock_: The last words said before the credits roll at the end of each episode are either "Chockabloke checking out" in episodes featuring Fred Harris or "Chockagirl checking out" in episodes featuring Carol Leader.

-   "For now, Dick Clark," _\*salute\*_ "so long!"
    -   On one episode of Pyramid, celebrity contestant Dick Cavett asked the host _just_ as he was about to deliver his sign off, "Who are you for now?" which at first just slightly confused him, and then, as he attempted to go forward (the show was ending after all), completely broke him up as the Brick Joke hit him.

-   On _Family Matters_, series star Reginald VelJohnson read the following spiel over the end credits: "_Family Matters_ is a Miller-Boyett production, in association with Lorimar Television, and is distributed by Warner Bros.

-   _Green Acres_: "This has been a Filmways presentation, dahling." (Well, it _was_ a Gabor.)

-   _How I Met Your Mother_ parodied this trope in season 4, when Robin feels threatened for not having one and going into an audition, she creates one at the spot, and it sounds bad:
    
    **Robin**: From all of us here, at News 10, have a good evening... So good night, New York, and may the road ahead be lit with dreams and tomorrows... which are lit with dreams... also... Stand tall, New York. Trustworthy. Recycling... Wear a condom.

-   _Just Roll With It_: "And that's our show!"/"You guys have been a great audience!"
-   _Kamen Rider Ex-Aid_ always ends with the scene cutting out in an Ominous Visual Glitch and displaying the message "See you next game." Considering the show is video-game themed, it's likely a Shout-Out to _Metroid_.
-   _Kidsongs_: After the Biggles were introduced, each video ends with them and the kids exchanging "See ya!" before all yelling "Bye!" to the viewer.
-   _Later_: During Bob Costas' run as host from 1988 to 1994, he would always sign off with "And we'll see you later."
    -   On his final episode aired February 25, 1994, he closes out with: "I'll be seeing you from NBC Sports and NBC News over the next several years, but this is the last time from here. Thank you very much. This time I mean it. See you later."

    -   The Spin-Off _Monster House_ (no, not the animated movie\]\]) would end with the narrator saying "Until next time, when who knows? The monster may be coming to your house." (This is less scary than it sounds.)

-   Mark Lamarr used to end _Never Mind the Buzzcocks_ with the Mad Libs Catchphrase "I've been Mark Lamarr, and \[song lyric beginning "I", possibly misquoted\]":
    
    _I've been Mark Lamarr, and I ain't afraid of no ghosts.

    I've been Mark Lamarr, but I've never been to me._

However, if the show ended with a ruling for the defendant, he would sign off by saying "If someone has filed a lawsuit against you and you are convinced you've done nothing wrong, don't be intimidated.

And the Handyman Corner concluded with the reminder that "if the women don't find you handsome, they should at least find you handy." Though as time went on he frequently followed up with "Now if you'll excuse me..." and a quip about what he intends to do with his latest creation, just before it usually goes horribly wrong or horribly right.

-   _Robot Wars_ would end with Craig Charles reciting a four-line poem about the episode's events that always ended "...on _Robot Wars_", after which Charles would salute the camera and say "Bye". Doubles as a Mad Libs Catchphrase.

-   _Saturday Night Live_ would have various ways to end the "Weekend Update" segment.
    -   Chevy Chase and Jane Curtin borrowed the sign off from _The Groove Tube_, "Good night, and have a pleasant tomorrow." Later borrowed _again_ by Tina Fey.

    **Murray**: See you next time on the street! Peace!
    
    -   And before that, starting in 1995, they would end every episode with a bumper called "Coming Soon On Sesame Street", showing a random clip from the next episode to air. After the clip was shown, Big Bird would say, "Toodle-loo!" leading to the funding credits. In 1998, this was replaced with the copyright notice, which moved away to the left as Big Bird appeared. This was used up until the end of Season 33 in 2002.
    -   And, of course, "_Sesame Street_ was brought to you today by the letter \_ and the number \_." Until the 2000s, that was usually followed by "_Sesame Street_ is a production of the Children's Television Workshop." This would be dropped when CTW was renamed "Sesame Workshop". The Murray quote listed above would follow the "sponsor" ending.

    **Dancers:** SOUL!

-   _Supermarket Sweep_: David Ruprecht always closed out each episode with "The next time you're at the checkout counter and you hear the beep, think of all the fun you can have on Supermarket Sweep." Originally said by just Ruprecht, the contestants began joining in by 1992.

-   Bob Barker on _Truth or Consequences_: "...good-bye, hoping all your consequences are happy ones."

-   Every episode of _Llan-ar-goll-en_ ends with Ceri saying "That's how we solved the mystery of the lost/missing X!"

    Music 

-   _BABYMETAL_ ends their concerts and press appearances the same way: Su-Metal does the kitsune sign and says "See you", followed by the other girls doing the same.
-   Heavy metal band Disturbed always ends concerts the same way, with lead singer/frontman David Draiman turning a chant into a sort of Call-and-Response Song. After which, Draiman will thank the city and promise to return soon, ending with "Peace!"
    
    **David:** Say our name with us now! Together, my brothers and sisters, my blood! We are!  
    **Crowd:** Disturbed!

-   Bill Beutel: "Good night, good luck, and be well." When he signed off for the last time before retiring, the news ticker in Times Square read "Good Luck, be well, Bill Beutel".

-   Linda Ellerbee's sign-off catch phrase: "And so it goes." A case of a Borrowed Catchphrase, since it originated with Lloyd Dobyns, the anchor of NBC's _Weekend_, who in turn borrowed it from the "so it goes" Arc Words in _Slaughterhouse-Five_. Ellerbee later joined Dobyns as co-anchor on the show, so she adopted it as well.
    -   When Ellerbee, as herself, hosted a (fake) retrospective of Ellen's showbiz career as the final episode of _Ellen_ to be produced, she signed off as per usual.
    -   In an early episode of _Murphy Brown_ where Murphy recalled how she first auditioned for "FYI", Murphy claimed that _she_ had coined the catch phrase "And so it goes", and Ellerbee stole it from her.

-   Edward R. Murrow ended his CBS News broadcasts with "Good night, and good luck" (hence the title of the 2005 biopic starring David Strathairn and George Clooney).
    -   Keith Olbermann paid homage by using the phrase on _Countdown With Keith Olbermann_, particularly after his Special Comments. On his _Countdown_ podcast (est. 2022), he says "good morning, good afternoon, good night, and good luck" (knowing you might hear it at any time, although he usually puts them out just after midnight eastern time). When he closed on a lighthearted note, he wadded up a piece of paper and hurled it at the camera, "smashing" it. He also did this on his 2013 ESPN 2 show.
-   Over on NBC, Earl Godwin closed off his news broadcast with "God bless you, one and all."
-   On public television's _Nightly Business Report_, co-anchor Paul Kangas always signed off each broadcast he co-anchored with "I'm Paul Kangas in Miami wishing all of _you_ the best of good buys!", a pun on good-byes, during which Kangas would also give off a trademark salute.
-   On September 1, 1986, Dan Rather started using the sign-off "Courage" on the CBS Evening News.

Let's go to press!" and ended with "And so, with lotions of love <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  this is your New York correspondent, Walter Winchell, who knows that all the lights on Broadway are never as bright as the candle in the window when you come home!" When he was in Florida, he would say "Miami Beach" instead of New York.
-   Most broadcasts of the Philippine evening newscast _TV Patrol_ ends with one of the anchors (Mostly Ted Failon or Noli De Castro) saying "Maraming Salamat at Magandang gabi, Bayan!" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  In recent times, this is after the last talks between the anchors related to the last report of that episode.
-   During World War II, news broadcasts kind of suspended the greetings/signoff thing as the news roundup came into being and reporters in key hotspots just gave matter-of-fact accounts of what they saw and heard. CBS' Roger Mudd has more about this in his book _The Place To Be_.
-   During the COVID-19 Pandemic, _CBS Evening News_ anchor Norah O'Donnell briefly adopted "Stay positive, and test negative."

        **Shannon:** We haven't gotten to the part where someone legit calls you a 'chicken-wuss'.
        
-   Every episode of _Desert Island Discworld_ ends with Al Kennedy saying "We'll be back next week with another castaway and another book. Until then, remember: The turtle moves." In the season finales, "next week" is replaced by "in the new year" or "later in the year".
-   _The Hidden Almanac_:
    -   For the first few years, Reverend Mord's sign-off was "Be safe, and stay out of trouble." From November 2016, "Be safe, and remember: You are not alone" became increasingly common, and is now the usual sign-off.

-   Each episode of SciShow Tangents ends with host Hank Green asking listeners to help the show by becoming Patreons, leaving reviews, or "just (_whole cast chimes in_) **tell people about us!**" After the credits, Hank signs off individually with, "Remember, the mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be lighted!"
-   At the end of the second episode of _Shelfdust Presents: The War Effort_, the Al Kennedy-hosted podcast about _Secret Wars (1984)_, one of the guests says "Until next time, keep it secret!" and Al says he wishes he'd thought of that. He uses it in every subsequent episode.
-   The True Crime podcast _Sick Sad World_: "Don't be a murderer."

    -   Seasons 40-46:
    
    **Murray**: "See you next time on the street! Peace!"
    
    -   Since Season 46: "...we'll see you next time on... Sesame Street!"

    Radio 

-   _American Top 40_: Casey Kasem would end the program with "Keep your feet on the ground and keep reaching for the stars!"

    "This is Ray Goulding, reminding you to write if you get work..."

    **Gracie:** Good night.

-   _Hearts Of Space_: Stephen Hill and Anna Turner's landmark New Age music program (link), founded in 1973, has ended since February 1990 with Stephen's gentle "Safe journey, space fans... wherever you are." This reassuring signoff may have come from the fact that many early listeners were (and some probably still are) mind trippers, using the broadcast to accompany contemplative LSD sessions.
-   _I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue_:
    
    -   In the earliest years, the sign-off would usually be some joke about Humph looking at his watch:
    
    **Humph**: Well, with Goofy's tail pointing up and Mickey Mouse's hand pointing down, I realise my Rolex is a fake... and that we've reached the end of the show.
    
    -   The later years would utilize a Signing Off Mad Libs Catch Phrase which goes something like "And so as the <noun> of <meaniningless meaningful word\> <adjectives> the <noun> of <meaningless meaningful word> and <either the same pattern again or some sort of pun on the first clause>, I notice it's the end of the show. So from the teams, myself, and the good people of <town>, goodbye." For example:
    
    **Humph**: And so as the loose-bowelled pigeon of Time swoops low over the unsuspecting tourist of Destiny, and the flatulent skunk of Fate wanders into the air-conditioning system of Eternity...
    
-   _Inner Sanctum Mysteries_ had a chilling one. After a well-acted story loaded with Nightmare Fuel, the pleasant voice of your host, Raymond, would intone:

-   Garrison Keillor:
    -   His _Writers' Almanac_ segments end with, "Be well... do good work... and keep in touch."

He always led off with Vangelis' _Heaven and Hell_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and conclude with a woman's voice reciting "To create is divine, to reproduce is human. - Man Ray." The current hosts, Jon "Wobbly" Leidecker and Robert "K-Rob" Cole, still use these.

-   _That Gosh Darn Hippie Show_: "Have a groovy weekend", regardless of when the show actually airs.
-   _This American Life_ always ends with a quote from some part of that week's show, taken out of context and humorously attributed to creator Torey Malatia. The only time they didn't do this was when they reported on Mike Daisey's faked anecdotes in his story about Chinese Foxconn workers.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    
    **Ira.** WBEZ management oversight for our program by our boss, Mr. Torey Malatia. And I think this is a week I am just not in the mood for an extra quote here from Torey.

-   _Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me_ ends with funny predictions from the panel, after which is the regular sign-off from announcer Bill Kurtis followed by host Peter Sagal thanking the panel by name and telling listeners to come back next week.
    
    **Bill:** And if any of that happens, panel, we'll ask you about it on _Wait Wait Don't Tell Me_!

-   Simiarly, late Cincinnati Reds broadcaster Joe Nuxhall was well known for ending with his phrase, "This is the old left-hander, rounding third and heading for home," which was put on display outside the ballpark when the Reds opened the Great American Ballpark in 2003.

-   Chuck Thompson, an announcer with the Baltimore Orioles and Baltimore Colts in the '60s and '70s, would sign off after those teams' victories with "Ain't the beer cold!"
-   Another inversion of an announcer always opening a broadcast with a catchphrase is Brent Musburger's "You are looking live at \[_venue_\] in \[_city_\]." He claims he started doing this partly as a way to tip off gamblers about game time weather conditions at stadiums, so they could take them into account as they placed their final bets.

-   _No Umbrellas Allowed_:

    Real Life 

-   Before 24 hour TV and radio stations became commonplace (and still used if a station needs goes off the air for something like maintenance), most stations would say something to the effect of "Thank you for watching, and have a good night" or "\[insert call sign here\] now ends our broadcast day, to return to the air tomorrow morning at \[time\]" shortly before shutting down for the night. They were legally required to give the name of the company that owned the station, plus the broadcast site, frequency, wattage and location of transmitter and antenna. There was often a Sermonette or brief prayer or reflection after that, leading into a musical Signing Off Catch Phrase in the form of the national anthem of whatever country the station is in. U.S. stations often used the Lord's Prayer (one memorable version had Chief Shatka Bear Step (Nez Perce) giving the prayer in a Native American sign language), "America the Beautiful" with nature scenes, "This Is My Country", "God Bless America" or "My Country 'Tis Of Thee", or a poem like High Flight. Some versions of "The Star Spangled Banner" could get pretty creative with their video production.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Many ended off with an hour or so of The Test Pattern.
    -   In some countries the national anthem at sign-off was (or is) a legal requirement. Mexico mandates radio stations to play the anthem at sign-off and sign-on, or, if they run 24 hours, to play it at 12:00 A.M. and 6:00 A.M.
-   Every Olympic Games (whether summer or winter) is closed out by the IOC president with some variation of the following:
    
    And now, in accordance with tradition, I declare the Games of the \[ordinal number of Summer Olympics\] Olympiad/\[ordinal number of Winter Olympics\] Olympic Winter Games closed, and I call upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in \[next host city\] to celebrate the Games of the \[next ordinal number of Summer Olympics\] Olympiad/\[next ordinal number of Winter Olympics\] Olympic Winter Games.
    
-   Between the Second and Third Punic Wars, Roman senator Cato the Elder ended every single one of his speeches with "Carthaga delenda est" - "Carthage must be destroyed." - even if his speech was completely unrelated to Carthage. In 146 BC, Rome made good on that when it completely destroyed Carthage in the Third Punic War.
-   It's common for Japanese speakers to end a presentation with the sentence ご清聴ありがとうございました (_goseichō arigatō gozaimashita_) to thank the viewers. Likewise, replace _seichō_ with _shichō_ 視聴 if it's a video and _etsuran_ 閲覧 if it's an art collection/comic.
-   The Catholic Mass takes its name from the final words spoken by the priest in the Latin versions: "Ite, missa est." ("Go, it's over.")
