_"We spectres are a jollier crew than you, perhaps, suppose!"_

— **Sir Roderick Murgatroyd, Bart (deceased)**, _Ruddigore_

Ghosts are often portrayed as inherently somber beings, doomed to remain near the place of their death and mourn their own demise forever. These ghosts however, will have none of that. Silly Spooks are the clowns of the undead, causing laughter instead of, or sometimes in addition to, fear. In some cases, the characters will be scared of the ghost while the audience laughs. Other times, the Silly Spook will be funny In-Universe and out. But at the end of the day, SOMEONE will have the giggles.

The comedy inherent in this trope can be deliberate on the ghost's part or not. Silly Spooks that don't want to be funny tend to be portrayed as hilariously incompetent at scaring people, which is often their job.

Despite the name, this trope can apply not only to ghosts, but to any stereotypically scary supernatural being.

The Trope Namer is _The Haunted Mansion_ ride at Disney Theme Parks and the assorted media directly based upon it. Compare Friendly Ghost, who is also a non-scary but not necessarily funny spirit, or the Reluctant Monster who isn't even aware of its role. This is one of the polar opposites to Ghastly Ghost. Can be a Ridiculously Alive Undead.

    Advertising 

-   General Mills' monster-themed breakfast cereal Boo Berry has a ghost as a mascot. In the original ad, Frankenberry and Count Chocula both are scared of the ghost and perform a Security Cling with each other, despite the fact that they're a Frankenstein's Monster and a Classical Movie Vampire. But Boo Berry just wants to share his cereal.

    Anime and Manga 

-   The first ghost-types to appear in _Pokémon: The Series_ turn out to be pretty funny. They're fond of Tex Avery\-esque Eye Pops and Wild Takes and clearly see their hauntings as pranking Ash and Pikachu, not attacking them.

    Fan Works 

-   Since the fanfics _Haunted Mansion and the Hatbox Ghost_ are based on the Trope Namer, Disney's "Haunted Mansion" ride, they keep this important aspect of the characters.
-   _Lucy's Secret_: Discussed when, while using the Ouija board, Luan hopes they won't summon any prankster ghosts who like to give "ou-edgies".

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The 1944 film version of _The Canterville Ghost_ has the ghost being a big coward, as are all his descendants. He can't pass on until a descendant does something brave.
-   In _The Time of Their Lives (1946)_, Lou Costello plays a ghost wrongly accused of treason, just trying to clear his name (with the typical Costello bumbling, cowardly comedy).
-   The ghosts in _Topper_ and its sequels are helpful but often mischievous.
-   Beetlejuice of _Beetlejuice_ is an interesting situation — referring to him, the movie's tagline was "The name in laughter from the hereafter!", but the movie itself is more intentionally comedic than Betelgeuse himself, who is more of a Monster Clown.
-   Stuart and Cyrus from _The Frighteners_.
-   Elements of this can be found in Brad Greenquist's performance as the mutilated ghost of Victor Pascow in _Pet Sematary (1989)_. Although he's presented solely as a Ghastly Ghost in the novel, in the film he can be seen cheerfully settling into his seat when Rachel returns to Maine from Chicago (even though he's still quite ghastly).
-   In _Poltergay_, the five ghosts of gay partyogers have been partying in the house where they perished for 27 years. Those with Camp Gay mannerisms still affect them. The worst they do is playing mischievous pranks on protagonist Marc and teasing him about his butt since they're, well, gay ghosts.

    Literature 

-   The ghosts in _Harry Potter_ are mainly there for comic relief, though they become relevant to the plot occasionally.
-   _Family Skeleton Mysteries_: Sid the ambulatory skeleton, who's generally cheerful and loves to make bad jokes.
-   Elizabeth, the Cute Ghost Girl in _Maburaho_, takes a liking to Kuriko, because her large breasts remind Elizabeth of her mother. In fact, she mistakes Kuriko _for_ her mother _because_ of Kuriko's breasts. When Kazuki and the girls help Elizabeth out to escape from the house in which she's been bound, she opens up and becomes quite playful.
-   In _The Traveling Triple-C Incorporeal Circus_, ghosts Chelsea and Carmen must become this in order to put on a circus show and distract some poltergeists.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Big Bad Beetleborgs_ featured Flabber, a friendly ghost who grants Drew, Jo, and Roland their powers.
-   _Supernatural_: Ghosts and spirits can be very scary, but the episode "Changing Channels" features a very silly Bedsheet Ghost during the opening credits.

    Music 

-   The meme-tastic song "Spooky Scary Skeletons" by Andrew Gold admits that the skeletons "are silly all the same".

    Poetry 

    Puppet Shows 

-   Three Bedsheet Ghosts on the Vincent Price episode of _The Muppet Show_ who tell corny ghost jokes and sing "I'm Looking Through You". They also appeared in the live show _The Muppets Take the Bowl_/_The Muppets Take the O2_, singing "Boo Danube" (a series of "boo!"s to the tune of _Blue Danube_).

    Theatre 

-   In Gilbert and Sullivan's Gothic Horror spoof _Ruddigore_, the ghosts of the past Bad Baronets of the Murgatroyd family haunt their ancestral castle, acting like The Comically Serious versions of Ghastly Ghosts. They also get an awesomely spooky song called "When the Night Wind Howls" about all the fun they have on dark and stormy nights.
    
    When the night wind howls  
    In the chimney cowls  
    And the bat in the moonlight flies  
    And the inky clouds  
    Like funeral shrouds  
    Sail over the midnight skies  
    When the footpads quail  
    At the night-bird's wail  
    And black dogs bay at the moon  
    Then is the spectre's holiday!  
    Then is the ghost's high noon!
    

    Theme Parks 

-   The Trope Namers are the ghostly stars of _The Haunted Mansion_ ride at Disney Theme Parks, who are clearly more interested in partying than anything frightening or sinister. Even "Grim Grinning Ghosts", the ride's Theme Song, admits that these ghosts only _pretend_ to terrorize.
    -   Emma and Ezra from the 2003 film adaption are these.

    Video Games 

-   _Moshi Monsters_:
    -   Zoinks the ghost and his cousin are mischievous pranksters.
    -   McScruff the ghost is a practical joker.
-   Yu from _Puyo Puyo_ is a punny Genki Girl of a ghost. With that said, she _does_ outright try to kill others, but it's actually because she loves being a ghost so much that she wants others to feel the good effects of being one as well (apparently not realizing what she's doing is murder), and she's quite friendly otherwise.
-   In _Super Mario Bros._ we have the Boos, known for nearly always sticking their tongues out at you like a kid making a silly face and hiding behind their hands when Mario looks at them as if they were playing Peek-A-Boo.
-   Kogasa from _Touhou Project_ is a Karakasa whose main ambition in life is to Jump Scare people and surprise them. Unfortunately, she's a Cute Monster Girl, so all her attempts end in failure.
-   _Undertale_ has Napstablook, who does funny things like leading you to believe that they're asleep when in fact they're awake and saying "ZZZ" out loud, as well as Mettaton, who has more of a Large Ham comedic style.
-   _Yo Kai Watch_ has Whisper, a Know-Nothing Know-It-All who's known to occasionally make cheesy puns and transform himself to go along with the jokes.

    Web Comics 

-   Mort of _Gunnerkrigg Court_. He _is_ supposed to scare people, actually, but when he's not on the job, he borders on Endearingly Dorky.

    Web Original 

-   Carol "Ghost Pupper" Walters, a character created by artist Stedilnik, is an adorable young woman who was gruesomely stabbed to death in 1986. She's still as adorable as a poltergeist as she was when she was alive, although she _can_ get genuinely terrifying if she wants to.
-   Wanda from _Baman Piderman_ giggles, plays pranks and does cutesy things like boop Piderman on the nose and make an origami crane kiss Pumkin.
-   FilmCow has the _Ghost House (2014)_ series of videos, which are about a man stuck in a house full of silly ghosts.
-   Casper as portrayed by the _Nostalgia Critic_. The silliness comes from how Out of Character it is for Canon Casper to be malicious and from the fact that he's still not scary even with the meaner personality.

    Western Animation 

-   Hairy Scary, pictured above, more so than Casper in _Casper and the Angels_. Casper is supposed to be a "guardian ghost" to the Space Cop Angels along with Hairy, but the latter brings about most of the show's laughs.
-   _The Funky Phantom_, who is a scaredy-cat ghost.
-   Slimer, the team mascot/pet in _The Real Ghostbusters_. Instead of "busting" him, the team lets him hang around and be the Comic Relief.
-   The ghosts in the classic Disney short "Lonesome Ghosts". They call ghost exterminators Mickey, Donald and Goofy so they could have someone to scare, and are clearly having a ball while doing so.
-   _Danny Phantom_: Danny Phantom himself qualifies. Although he possesses the power to become a ghost (which tend to be the source of most misfortune in the Danny Phantom universe), he is generally a pretty outgoing, Book Dumb kid who can be a bit of a Butt-Monkey. There's also the Box Ghost, whose job is to haunt...boxes. Absolutely no one is afraid of him, and his bothering the main characters is a recurring gag.
-   Beetlejuice of _Beetlejuice_ (see Film above).
    -   The animated character is _far_ Lighter and Softer than the film version and fits the trope _much_ better.
-   The _Wacky Races_ episode "Creepy Trip to Lemon Twist" features two mischievous ghosts in the abandoned saloon. They play pranks on some of the racers, until Big Gruesome turns the tables on them.
-   _Regular Show_'s Hi-Five ghost doesn't have much in the way of a developed personality, but his design is definitely silly. He looks like a Bedsheet Ghost or a _Pac-Man_ ghost with a single arm and hand growing out of the top of his head.
-   _Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers_: The Boo Brothers, who come across as a ghostly version of the Three Stooges.
-   _The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo_ has Bogel and Weerd, two ghosts who originally tricked Scooby and Shaggy into opening the Chest of Demons, and in subsequent episodes would frequently act as bumbling minions to the Monster of the Week.
-   _OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes_: Spanky and Crudde from the episode "Parents' Day" are two mischievous ghosts who live in the basement of Enid's house. Much to the annoyance of Enid's mom, Wilhamena, they like to possess house guests and make them do embarrassing or destructive things.
-   Spooky, the little spook in the _Cool Cat_ cartoon "Big Game Haunt", is a hybrid of Casper and Elmer Fudd.
-   Popeye encounters one in the 1960 short "Popeye and the Phantom".
