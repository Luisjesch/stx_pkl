"Our courteous and efficient staff is on call 24 hours a day to serve all your supernatural elimination needs."

_"We're ready to believe you!"_

A genre centered on characters who specialize in investigating the paranormal and the supernatural. In other words, works featuring Occult Detectives. After all, _who else_ are you gonna call?

Depending on the case, or the series in general, the paranormal activity can either be a hoax or the real thing. When actual supernatural forces are in play, the detectives may need to consult a specialist to combat it, or they might deal with it themselves through esoteric means, such as: occult magic, enchanted weapons, and the like.

Closely related to Who You Gonna Call? and often involves Demon Slaying.

According to the Ghostbreakers website the genre is in fact Older Than Feudalism starting with the letter _To Sura_ by Pliny the Younger.

A few other episodes have shades of the genre by being investigations into something that turns out to be paranormal, but these are the only two episodes involving legit, recognized paranormal investigators as character.
-   Many of the investigations conducted on _Mystery Hunters_ are based around looking whether alleged paranormal activity is indeed paranormal.
-   Amelia from _Power Rangers Dino Fury_ wants to be one, and is always pitching stories to her boss Jane involving ghost sightings or cryptids.

Conversely, other paranormal investigators regard the Institute as a joke.

Three of the four available character classes (The Scholar, The Wizard, The Ministry Man<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ) are common archetypes of occult detectives.
-   _Phasmophobia_ is a very scary game where you and friends play as paranormal investigators. The ghosts all use a fairly sophisticated AI with no scripting, so every ghosthunt is very different.

-   _Mario Party 8_: Spoofed in the minigame Specter Inspector. Two dueling characters have to enter a deep-dark mansion similar to the eponimous building of _Luigi's Mansion_. The hall they explore is played in first-person perspective with flashlights, and the characters have to check objects and furniture to find mooks (Fly Guy, Flutter, Piranha Plant, etc.) hidden there. If a character unveils a ghost instead, they'll be startled and briefly incapacitated. Whoever manages to find three mooks first wins; if five minutes pass and neither character managed to find three mooks, the minigame ends in a tie.

After 30 seconds, whoever scored the highest wins.
