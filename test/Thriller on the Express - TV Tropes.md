To be fair, who _hasn't_ wanted to kill someone after learning their train was delayed?

_"The hour is two, London time. Tea has been served. A passenger in first class is dead. Thank you."_

— **The Conductor**, _Fallen London_, _The Twelve-Fifteen from Moloch Street_

Train journeys provide a number of advantages for plotting a thriller. They are an enclosed space with a sense of claustrophobia, uncomfortable proximity to strangers with several good justifications for why people can't leave. Long distance train journeys take several days during which the train is locked into a course going through wild terrain with no reception. This may or may not be the best time to commit a murder but it's a damn good time to write about one.

Thus it is that several works create thrillers set around a train. Despite all the advantages noted above, there may need to be adjustments made. Sometimes you just need that extra space or cubby holes to hide in so they'll make use of those places on trains people won't normally see, the kitchen car and luggage compartment. If train companies have made any security measures to stop people walking off the back door or getting onto the roof, they won't be in this film.

The train doesn't necessarily have to be part of the whole work. You might have a train based episode in a series but it won't be much of a Bottle Episode since it requires a new set and extras. There may be brief departures from the train but the time spent on the train should be enough to set up enough plot elements to stop people wandering too far or going to get help.

The Orient Express is a popular choice for the location, but the Moscow-Warsaw-Berlin-Paris "Ost-West Express" with its very distinctive green and yellow carriages plus Soviet crest is good for a Cold War story.

Compare Train Job. If it's an airplane instead of a train, that's Death in the Clouds. May occasionally but not frequently contain a Traintop Battle, most likely as a climax.

Not to be confused with dancing to Michael Jackson's _Thriller_ on a train.

    -   Another Agatha Christie work, _The Mystery of the Blue Train_: also deals with a homicide on board a train, though unlike _Orient Express_, the entire novel does not take place on the train.

    Podcasts 

-   One of these is the focus of the second arc of _The Adventure Zone: Balance_, _Murder on the Rockport Limited._

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Call of Cthulhu_ supplements _Fearful Passages_ ("The Iron Ghost" adventure) and _Horror on the Orient Express_ both have train-based adventures.
-   _Top Secret_, adventure TS005 _Operation: Orient Express_. A set of espionage adventures that occur on the famous title train.
-   _TORG_ had part of its "Relics of Power" adventure take place on a train. Sadly this setting was abandoned when the adventure was remade for the rereleased version, _Eternity_.
-   The _Merc 2000_ setting of _Twilight: 2000_ had an adventure called "Mess on the Orient Express", which involves the player characters having to find a stolen giant Buddha on the Orient Express.

    Video Games 

-   Like so much else, _BoxxyQuest: The Gathering Storm_ has fun with this. In Chapter 6 (which references a similar chapter in _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_), the heroes are excited for a luxury train trip, since it means taking a break from their quest, only for them to stumble over a murder victim the _instant they climb aboard_. Anonymous tries to bail out, and even after Catie guilt trips him into staying to help solve the mystery, he never stops acting really annoyed by the whole thing. And then subverted when it turns out the 'victim' was Faking the Dead purely as a joke.
    
    **Anonymous:** I know how this works, huh? I've seen the movies. That guy got killed, and one of the people on the train did it. It'll be up to us to solve the case before the train reaches GameFAQs in two days. That's stress I don't need right now.
    
-   The game _Chase the Express_/ _Covert Ops: Nuclear Dawn_ is sort of a clunky _Metal Gear_ Follow the Leader set on a trans-European train that will launch a nuke when it reaches its destination - although unusually for this type of story, there are a few stages that take place on a different train running adjacent to the main one.
-   The 2018 digital edition of _Clue_ offers a "Murder Express" theme in its season pass, letting the players find the correct suspect and weapon within a train platform and its neighboring amenities (such as a barber shop); the train engine and three of its attached cars are also considered "rooms".
-   _A Hat in Time_: These seem to be the entirety of the Conductor's creative output. All thrillers, all of them with/on trains. They still win awards year after year, however, so it's worked out well for him.
-   _The Last Express_. The Pre- World War 1 Orient Express setting gives it a very Christie feel and then it actually tries to use some of the same setting advantages that you might get in other media using this trope by having the game take place in real time.
-   _Master Detective Archives: Rain Code_: Chapter 0, “Massacre on the Amaterasu Express” serves as a tutorial mystery as Yuma is confronted with the slaughter of five WDO detectives on the train into Kanai Ward.
-   Chapter 6 of _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_ is a Breather Level that largely takes place on the luxuriant Excess Express. You get roped into solving a mystery that follows this formula during the three-day trip, and, except for a brief rest stop at an abandoned station, is totally devoid of actual fighting until the Traintop Boss Battle on the last day. It also averts the lack of security normally present in these stories—the train staff refuses to let Mario into restricted areas, let alone outside the train. The boss battle is on the traintop because the Smorgs had already captured everyone on the train except the conductor, leaving an unobstructed path out.
-   The first part of _Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box_ is set on the Molentary Express, theough the mystery is more about the train's destination than the train itself.

    Visual Novels 

-   _The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog_ takes place on a high-speed train where Amy is hosting a murder mystery birthday party. Sonic ends up being the murder victim, but the player character suspects legitimate foul play at hand, so he teams up with Tails to explore the train and interrogate the suspects. What makes this stand out compared to other examples is that _the train itself_ is the one responsible for "killing" Sonic, as it's a sentient Badnik created by Doctor Eggman.

    Webcomics 

-   Chapter 3 of _Stand Still, Stay Silent_ takes place almost entirely on a train. A pretty badass one, but that doesn't stop a giant from attacking.

    Web Video 

-   An entire arc of _TUBEPOOP Storymode: Part Two_ involves Super Mario, Patrick Star, and a red crewmate fighting I.M.P from _Helluva Boss_ in and _on_ a moving train. Naturally, the battle ends in a violent train collision caused by Ganon and Claude Frollo.

But as everyone else boards, a tall dark stranger in a Conspicuous Trenchcoat disguise boards the train as well, and then things begin to go wrong when after passing through a tunnel, Minka's diamond necklace is stolen, and Angelica's Cynthia doll and Chuckie's "Wawa" teddy bear are both presumably stolen as well, and Tommy and Chuckie suspect the stranger (whom they call the "Shadow Guy") of the crime. Eventually, it's found that Lulu's ex-boyfriend Dwayne had stolen the necklace, the tall dark stranger is really Jonathan who snuck on board to make sure Charlotte's work could get done faster, and Cynthia ended up under a seat in the babies' compartment after Angelica accidentally grabbed "Wawa" in the dark, thinking it was Cynthia.
