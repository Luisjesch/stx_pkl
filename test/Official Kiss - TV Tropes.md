Show, Don't Tell is a main rule of all fiction, visual or not, and applies even more so in emotionally-charged moments of triumph and heartwarming that are seen as having a duty to be as vivid and narratively satisfying as possible to make the audience cheer with glee. Since the Relationship Upgrade in successful romance almost always qualifies for this, there's a strong tendency for characters to act out the moment of upgrade with a big, uncomplicated smooch.

Often, especially in Unresolved Sexual Tension (and its cousins Belligerent Sexual Tension and Love Epiphany), this is a couple's very first time kissing each other, but this is not always the case. It is, however, often portrayed as the couple's first "real" kiss, meaning it can be the first romantic kiss between two characters that have previously kissed due to other motives, the kiss that marks the moment when two exes reconcile, when a casual dating situation turns into true love, or when a couple that has made some motions towards romance in the past finally become a _real_ couple.

A major staple of TV shows.

Compare Relationship Upgrade, Love Epiphany, Love Confession. Almost always a Hollywood Kiss, and when it's not, it's usually a subversion. Frequently The Big Damn Kiss. A common feature of a Cliffhanger or Season Finale.

    Anime and Manga 

-   On the very last page of _Bakuman。_, Mashiro and Azuki finally have their first kiss.
-   _Girl Friends (2006)_: Mari and Akko kiss a few times through the series, but only their third kiss is considered to be the official kiss, occurring after the two finally communicate exactly what their feelings are and get together for real.
-   Kaguya and Shirogane's first kiss in _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_ initially appears to serve this role given the circumstances, but a lack of proper communication of Kaguya's part over the next couple of days leads to a misunderstanding. It's their second kiss on Christmas Eve (which is much more normal) that truly marks their Relationship Upgrade. The actual Love Confession that the whole series was building up to doesn't happen until two days after that during their first date, but by that point, it's merely become a formality.
-   In phase 38 of _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED,_ after spending most of the series up to that point in various stages of Unresolved Sexual Tension, Murrue Ramius asks Mu La Flaga what prompted him to come back to the _Archangel_ when he was supposed to be on his way to a new assignment. Mu seems momentarily perplexed by the question and answers it by kissing her, after which the two of them are officially a couple with not much more needing to be said on the subject.
-   _Naruto_: After 15 years, fans got to see Naruto and Hinata share their Big Damn Kiss at the very end of _The Last: Naruto the Movie_, right before the credits start to roll. And then again even _more_ officially at their wedding _during_ the credits.
-   This happens between Kamina and Yoko of _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_. On the dawn before a pivotal battle, Yoko surprises Kamina by kissing him out of nowhere. A few seconds later, he kisses her back to show his reciprocation. No confessions or words of love are spoken, but it's pretty clear that they consider themselves to be together, especially when Kamina strongly implies that after the battle is over, they'll make love. It also turned out to be a Last Kiss due to Kamina dying in the ensuing battle.
    
    **Kamina:** When we return, I'll pay you back ten times over. Remember that.  
    **Yoko:** \*laughs\*  
    **Kamina:** Wh-What?  
    **Yoko:** Couldn't you have put that a little more romantically?

-   _The Big Bang Theory_: Penny and Leonard had kissed a few times but she was either depressed/drunk or it was a goodnight kiss for a solitary date they had. In the second season finale, it was clear she was starting to have romantic feelings for him but didn't want to interfere with a summer-long expedition the group was going on.

-   _Interview with the Vampire (2022)_: In "In Throes of Increasing Wonder...", it's the second kiss between Louis de Pointe du Lac and Lestat de Lioncourt which marks their Relationship Upgrade, and it's depicted as being more romantic than their First Kiss because the latter was partly fueled by repressed lust, whereas the former was done purely from their hearts. After Lestat declares his love, he proposes that Louis become his eternal companion and lover. Louis nods his head in assent, reaches out to cup Lestat's face, and then moves forward to kiss him.

-   _The X-Files_: Mulder and Scully at the end of season 7 episode "Millennium," after being horribly teased for at least two seasons. However, it's the midnight of New Year's Eve...might have been considered a kiss of two friends.

    Video Games 

-   Subverted in _Psychonauts_. Following the Big Damn Kiss at the end of the first game, Raz opens the next game cheerfully referring to Lili as his girlfriend... and then immediately backtracks because he's not actually sure Relationship Upgrades actually work that way or if they have to have The Talk first.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Amnesia: Memories_ has Spade World ending with its final CG and event being Ikki kissing the heroine in public. They previously kissed in a more private setting, so this kiss symbolizes Ikki's determination to be open about his feelings and relationship with the heroine in public.
-   _Yarudora series vol.2: Kisetsu o Dakishimete_ has straight, subverted, _and_ averted examples:
    -   Played straight with Mayu: the kiss she and the protagonist share at the climax of the game, after the Race for Your Love sequence, is a True Love's Kiss that not only cement their love but also revives Mayu's memories.
    -   Subverted with Tomoko: she and the protagonist share their first and crucial kiss mid-way in the game, and the kiss sequence's symbolic animation is similar to Mayu's; but the storyline after this sequence will pit you with several bad choices that can break the Relationship Upgrade and provoke Bad Endings. If you pick the good choices, there will be a _second_ kiss between Tomoko and the protagonist during the climax of the game: _that_ kiss will definitely solidify their relationship, as Tomoko will finally have overcome her Clingy Jealous Girl tendencies.
    -   Averted with the Sexy Lady: if you try to kiss her, a Yakuza who considers her as his woman will come for a "nice talk", leading you to a Bad Ending; and there will be no other opportunity for a kiss with her in the remainder of the game.
