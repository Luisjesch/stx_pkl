At least it's not a pterodactyl.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

_"For most of us, 'pterodactyls' are imagined as large, vicious and ugly gargoyles with lanky limbs, leathery wings and jaws lined with savage teeth, the sort of disreputable brutes we find in Arthur Conan Doyle's_ The Lost World_, the_ Jurassic Park _franchise – even a recent episode of_ Doctor Who_."_

While it is true that our knowledge of prehistoric fauna is steadily improving, the depictions in popular media do not seem to be as up to date with modern science. While dinosaurs are increasingly averting Science Marches On, however, the same cannot be said for the other dominant reptiles during their 200-million-year reign. As a case in point, look no further than their close relatives, the pterosaurs — the first vertebrates <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  to fly.

Nothing adds to the atmosphere of Hollywood Prehistory like tossing in some of these flying reptiles. Most media depicts these creatures as something like monstrous reptilian eagles or bats, carrying off such luckless victims like tasty humans or adventurous baby dinosaurs and being far more aggressive than they were in real life. To appear more monstrous, these pterosaurs are often depicted with traits such as exaggerated sizes, scaly reptilian skin (because Reptiles Are Abhorrent), a beak full of sharp teeth, grasping eagle-like talons to grab prey with, and leathery wings that make them look like a giant Bat Out of Hell. As in the case of most other Prehistoric Monster portrayals, Rule of Cool very much applies here.

Note that an inaccurate pterosaur by itself does NOT qualify as an example; Artistic License – Paleontology covers those cases already, so examples must be evil/antagonistic _and_ inaccurate to qualify here. Nonetheless, there do seem to be a number of common traits to most such portrayals aside from the inexplicable urge to attack the protagonists on sight, including:

-   Dragon-like designs rather than anything resembling the real animal. This includes portraying them with a covering of bare skin or reptilian scales rather than the hair-like scales called pycnofibers they had in real-life, and giving them bat-like wings with multiple fingers supporting a leathery membrane, rather than a single finger supporting a more complex, layered arrangement of muscle, gristle, and even air sacs to maintain the wing shape.
-   Flashing beakfuls of fearsome fangs, even when they aren't supposed to have any (Many such portrayals are based on _Pteranodon_, for instance, despite its name _meaning_ "toothless wing"). Relatedly, pterosaurs that _did_ have teeth often have them greatly exaggerated for dramatic effect.
-   Picking up and carrying off victims with strong, bird-like foot talons. Pterosaurs had small and relatively weak hind legs, short feet, and short toes, meant simply for walking on land and unable to carry anything. They also generally lacked the size and strength to pick up a person, and even the biggest ones like _Quetzalcoatlus_ likely landed on the ground to seize prey instead of snatching it on the fly.
-   Feeding strictly on flesh and nothing but. Pterosaur diets were likely a lot more varied than simply meat or fish, with many having beak and tooth shapes adapted for more specialized diets than your typical fictional people-guzzler. Some smaller species likely fed exclusively on insects, for instance, and a few may have even been fruit-eaters.
-   Being seen as backwards, maladapted, evolutionary failures that exist only to be a predatory menace. Pterosaurs were as much a part of the tree of life on Earth as any other animal, being the dominant flying vertebrates on Earth for over 150 million years, and as such were every bit as adapted for survival until their extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period (which was caused by a cosmic event beyond their control rather than any inherent failure of pterosaur evolution).

This is a subtrope of Artistic License – Paleontology. See Artistic License – Ornithology for the avian version and Somewhere, a Herpetologist Is Crying for a reptilian version. See also Giant Flyer, All Flyers Are Birds, Dinosaurs Are Dragons (because pop culture pterodactyls are often surprisingly similar to wyverns), and Terrifying Tyrannosaur (for when tyrannosaurs are the ones depicted as scary).

    Advertisements 

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Dragon Ball_: Early installments feature many late surviving extinct species and pterosaurs are among them — one even makes an appearance in the first episode as a Starter Villain. These pterosaurs _Pteranodon_ as the obvious baseline inspiration, but they're scaled up to near kaiju levels and look significantly more monstrous and cartoony, with scaly skin, teeth, dragon tails and talons. They're never referred to by any genus name, but they _are_ referred to as "dinos", which appears to be treated as a blanket term for prehistoric reptiles in the series.
-   _The☆Ultraman_ has two pterosaur-based monsters, Gadon the kaiju-sized _Archaeopteryx_ who becomes hostile after being affected by the Devil Star, and later a smaller but equally dangerous creature called a Choirus who resembles closer to the classic pterosaur (albeit blue in colour).

    Comic Books 

-   _Deff Skwadron_: The squighawk, a creature leathery pointed wings, a long tail with an arrowhead tip, a fang-lined beak, and a triangular crest on its head, is portrayed as a ferocious and aggressive predator.
-   _Flesh_: The pterosaurs seen in Book 1 and Book 2 carry people off in their claws.
-   _The Savage Sword of Conan_: The monstrous pterosaur featured in "At the Mountain of the Moon-God", apart from being scaly, bipedal, and toothy, is Born as an Adult after incubating in an egg for thousands of years and can fly while grasping a fully-grown human in each hand. The narrative acknowledges that last inaccuracy before brushing it off.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Calvin and Hobbes_: In the arc introducing the Transmogrifier Gun, Calvin asks Hobbes to transmogrify him into a pterodactyl so he can terrorize the neighborhood. Instead, he is transmogrified into a bipedal cartoony "pterodactyl" which is no bigger than a duck, much to his dismay as he believes pterodactyls are big (which is ironic as his pterosaur form is the right size for a _Pterodactylus_) and his puny form won't be terrorizing anyone.
-   _The Far Side_: Pterosaurs are the subject of numerous strips, and mostly depicted as gigantic, heavy-bodied, toothy and ferocious carnivores who co-exist with cavemen in Hollywood Prehistory. They often serve as hilariously inappropriate bird-replacements:
    -   A caveman has "trained" his pet pterosaur to "perch" on his finger, and has lost large chunks of his anatomy in the process, reducing him to using crude bits of wood as replacements.
    -   A caveman family has set up a "bird feeder", which is some cows staked out on tethers for the pterosaurs to swoop down on and carry off.

    Fan Works 

-   _The Bridge_: Like several other _Godzilla_\-series kaiju, Rodan is presented as having been genetically engineered by an ancient civilization as a planetary guardian, in this case being a gigantic pterosaur prior to modification. As this wasn't present in the canon material, it serves as a meta-level Hand Wave for any anatomical changes that brought him closer to this trope (anatomy-wise, at least — his personality is rather laid-back rather than being a predatory menace) than with actual pterosaur anatomy. After he's accidentally teleported to Equestria early in the story and gets magically transformed into a griffon, he has in place of the eagle parts of a normal Equestrian griffon the more reptilian or dragon-like features of his true form, raptorial talons and all.
-   _Rise of the Galeforces_: Two pterosaur genera are among the resurrected Mesozoic creatures to appear: the _Pteranodon_ from _Jurassic Park III_ appear regularly, and are joined by _Ornithocheirus_ later in the story. The JP3 _Pteranodon_ are unchanged (talons, teeth, and all), and the protagonists even end up having to go through almost the exact same aviary scene as in the film at one point. The _Ornithocheirus_ meanwhile behave a lot like the _Cearadactylus_ in the first _Jurassic Park_ novel, being unusually aggressive and strong, though at least they pick things up with their beaks instead of their feet like the _Pteranodon_ do. Most notable of all, however, is the Author Avatar whose super alias literally _is_ "Terrordactyl" - his main schtick being that he's actually a JP3-style _Pteranodon_ who was even further enhanced by the DNA of other creatures including that of one of the human protagonists, giving him a long, dragon-like tail, an absurdly fast Healing Factor, and the ability to assume a human form himself.
-   _Terra Monstrum_: Rodan is one of the main Kaiju characters in this _Godzilla_ fanfiction, taking on a more prominent role than in the films' canon after Godzilla himself is permanently killed by Mechagodzilla. Despite being stated to be a "pterodactylid", Rodan doesn't look too different from the versions in the franchise proper which mostly play the trope straight themselves; specifically, he resembles a mix of the Showa and Millenium versions with the added addition of bird-like talons and serrated, blade-like wings. Despite his monstrous appearance and fierce temperament, though, he's still one of the good guys.

    Films — Animation 

-   _The Good Dinosaur_: Thunderclap and his clan are a band of hostile, toothed and eagle-clawed pterosaurs that are the closest to actual villains in the film.
-   _Ice Age_: The third film, set in a Lost World with Living Dinosaurs features two flavors of this trope: pink ones resembling giant _Rhamphorhynchus_ with short _Pteranodon_\-like crests and the other species being dangerous blue ones with orange stripes, red eyes and pointed teeth which mostly resemble oversized _Pterodactylus_. When Buck, Crash, and Eddie ride one of the pink ones to Lava Falls, a pack of the _Pterodactylus_\-like pterosaurs follow after seeing the possums for prey which leads to a daring aerial canyon chase.
    -   In said chase, the blue pterosaurs also seem to be ludicrously insistent on hunting the possums regardless of personal risk, resulting in their defeats in the canyon:
        -   five pterosaurs are taken down from a distance by explosive berries launched by the possums.
        -   A highlight of the canyon scene after those five are down, one bold pterosaur in of the pack flies straight into becoming his own _spectacle_.
    -   After the canyon scene, the last four are killed off by flying blindly into lava falls.
    -   The pink one is a subversion, though, as it doesn't actively menace anyone and simply flies away once all is said and done (and another one of its kind even showed up as a steed of Buck's in a later spinoff).
    -   Several of the blue pterosaurs also make an appearance in the extended version of the short "No Time For Nuts", with one of them snatching up Scrat and his acorn with its feet shortly after he winds up in the dinosaur age.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Age of Dinosaurs_: Scaly pterosaurs appear that carry people away with their feet.
-   _The Dinosaur Project_: The characters are attacked by carnivorous nocturnal anurognathid pterosaurs, which are also depicted as flightless and instead get around by leaping from tree to tree like monkeys.
-   _Godzilla_: Rodan, a giant pterosaur-dragon Kaiju, is usually portrayed as highly aggressive and territorial, in contrast to the more reactive Godzilla and pacifist Mothra, although he isn't actively evil the way King Ghidorah is. Whether or not he's an actual pterosaur or just looks sort of like one varies — in _Rodan_ he's a mutated giant _Pteranodon_, while in _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_ he dates back to the Permian period, meaning that he predates the pterosaur order by over 60 million years.
-   _Jurassic Park_:
    -   Generally speaking, _Pteranodon_ are portrayed as highly aggressive predators of land-bound targets, usually humans, which they grasp with prehensile feet and carry off into the sky. Depending on the film in question, they may or may not have teeth.
    -   _Jurassic World_: The _Pteranodon_ (toothless this time) still portrayed as Death from Above, and also joined by a different pterosaur: _Dimorphodon_. These are depicted as aerial predators (the real life _Dimorphodon_ was a harmless insectivore/hunter of small animals), and physically resemble emaciated bat-wyvern creatures with toothy jaws instead of beaks. Notably, this film is one of the first pop-culture work to depict _Pteranodon_ plunge-diving for food like pelicans or gannets, something they likely did in real life, and it also remembers their sexual dimorphism (having short, stumpy crests when female). The _Pteranodons_ that get appeared up in the prologue of _Jurassic World Dominion_ inexplicably use the same models as this movie, but one is shown diving into the water, showing that this behavior was not limited to the modern-day hybrids from _Jurassic World_ proper.
    -   _Jurassic World Dominion_: The _Quetzalcoatlus_ in the prologue are depicted as terrestrial, quadrupedal macro-predators. A revived one also appears in the present day, attacking a cargo plane the human protagonists are flying in; this one is much larger than the real animal, almost the same size _as the plane itself_. Its menacing the humans is, in this case, rather realistic — azhdarchids, the group _Quetzalcoatlus_ belongs to, likely hunted terrestrial prey, particularly ground-dwelling animals like small reptiles, mammals, and dinosaur hatchlings.
-   _Kong: Skull Island_: The Leafwings and their larger cousins, the Psychovultures, are said to be evolved descendants of pterosaurs in supplementary material. Both species are very aggressive, with a flock of Leafwings attacking the Monarch crew in the movie and carrying off a crewmember that they dismember in midair.
-   _Legend of Dinosaurs and Monster Birds_: The _Rhamphorhynchus_ in the movie is gigantic, much bigger than the real animal, and extremely aggressive.
-   _The Lost World_: The first prehistoric creature encountered is a massive _Pteranodon_ that grabs a peccary with its beak and carries it to its perch to eat.
-   _One Million Years B.C._ has Loanna captured by an immense, bat-winged _Pteranodon_ to be fed to its young. The _Pteranodon_ and its young then get killed by an oversized, short-tailed, and also bat-winged _Rhamphorhynchus_.
-   _Tyranno's Claw_: A massive pterosaur menaces the main characters several times, and later snatches the (unnamed) female lead to its nest to feed its young.
-   _When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth_: While Tara is hiking back to his tribe, which has been taken over by the overzealous Kingsor, he is carried off by a giant _Rhamphorhynchus_.

    Literature 

-   _Dinotopia_: _Pteranodon_ are portrayed as dangerous, aggressive man-eaters, which prey with impunity on anyone who enters their territories in the lower reachers of the Ancient Gorge where they make their carrion-strewn lairs. Depending on the specific work, they range from mindless monsters to respected but savage gatekeepers of the World Beneath.
-   _Jurassic Park_: The original novel features an aviary full of _Cearadactylus_. While they're depicted as furry, quadrupedal fish-eaters, they also fill the "airborne terror" role. Granted, the reason they're so aggressive is much more plausible than most portrayals — they're naturally territorial and aren't too keen on people wandering into their nesting ground. They're also erroneously referred to as "birds" and "flying dinosaurs", which is made all the more jarring by the fact that the chapter they appear in is told from the perspective of a _legitimate paleontologist_.
-   _Spooksville_: The plot of _The Deadly Past_ is kicked off by the gang being attacked by a pterodactyl, who proceeds to take Cindy to its nest.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Danger 5_: Played for laughs, with a "pterodon" played by a man in a bad rubber suit. It talks, and attacks Jackson with a broken beer bottle after sexually assaulting a woman.
-   _Doctor Who_: "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship" features abnormally aggressive Pteranodons (called "Pterodactyls" by the Doctor) attacking the Doctor, Rory, and Brian (Rory's dad) in one scene. They hunt in packs and, while they don't try to grab anyone with their feet, they instead try to stab the heroes with their beaks.
-   _Monster Warriors_: The Warriors battle monstrous pterodacyls in "Pterodactyl Terror" and "The Secrets of the Lost Canyon". The inaccuracies are Justified is this case these are not supposed to be real pterodactyls, but creatures conjured out of an old monster movie by the series' Big Bad.
-   _Odd Squad_: One episode, "6:00 to 6:05", features Precinct 13579 being attacked by a small pterosaur after a mass breakout from the Dinosaur Room. The odd thing is, the pterosaur is quite clearly a _Pterodaustro_, a filter-feeder that has the Cretaceous equivalent of a flamingo, and is depicted as being about half the size of a real one.
-   _Power Rangers_: Various incarnations have featured Zords based on various species of pterosaurs. While they do have their share of inaccuracies (calling a _Pteranodon_ a "Pterodactyl" just to name one), they do at least try a little by having some lesser-known pterosaurs be featured. The "Dragozord", for example, is a robotic _Tupuxuara_. Plus, the series runs on Rule of Cool, and these are Humongous Mecha, not living creatures, so accuracy isn't exactly a priority.
-   _Primeval_:
    -   The _Pteranodon_ is fairly standard — nothing especially wrong with it, but not exactly a transcendent portrayal — but the _Anurognathus_ in the same episode are bipedal scrawny things that may as well be airborne pirañas and ravenously strip human victims to the bone.
    -   _Primeval: New World_: The _Pteranodon_ from the first episode is a hyper-aggressive man-eater that spears things with its beak, sometimes walks on two legs, and abducts a child. It's particularly odd since the original _Primeval_ series featured a much more nonaggressive _Pteranodon_.
-   _Terra Nova_: The rhamphorynchid antagonists in episode 3 lack pycnofibres and are improbably aggressive, and "rhamphorhynchoids" are believed to have been extinct by the show's 85 million-year-old date.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  There is a larger and (slightly) better-looking pterodactyloid species that has a few cameos in one or two episodes, although it also commits the crime of being naked with pointed wings.
-   _Torchwood_: Pterodactyls look like a slightly less mediocre version of _Jurassic Park III_'s second pterosaur variety. By "less mediocre", its just because it lacks teeth. Sans the appearance, Myfanwy also seems to be a super predator when even its anatomy dictates that injuring partially-converted Cybermen and _Apatosaurus_\-aliens would be a fairly hard task.

    Music 

-   The Historian Himself's "Earth Beasts Awaken" project, based around a Kaiju Apocalypse, features the monstrous "Terrorsoar" as the main harbinger of humanity's demise.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dinosaurs Attack!_: _Pteranodon_ are depicted eating the president and his first lady, and then go on to nest in Mount Rushmore and feed tourists to their babies.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: The Pterafolk of Chult are Beast Man versions of this trope. They are bipedal, with a toothy beak and _Pteranodon_\-like crest, green scaly skin and grasping feet. They also have bat-like wings, but they can magically retract them when on the ground, turning them into humanoid arms. Culture-wise they are barbaric savages who will attack jungle travellers.
-   _Exalted_: Downplayed by sky titans. Their artwork shows them as fairly realistic azhdarchid pterosaurs, but their otherwise share the trope's propensity for preying on human-sized, land-bound victims that they divebomb like meteors and pull into the heavens to toy with before swallowing whole.
-   _Oko Yrrhedesa_: Aggressive pterosaurs are the main danger in crossing a hanging bridge in _The Eye of Yrrhedes_ scenario. You have to fight them, and they can throw you off the bridge, and there is also a chance that the whole construction will fall apart due to their attacks, taking down everyone on it.
-   _Pathfinder_:
    -   _Dimorphodon_ is portrayed as a man-sized, aerial predator with a venomous bite, naked skin, and a hooked beak, unlike the much smaller, arboreal generalist it is thought to have been in real life.
    -   2nd edition portrays _Pteranodon_ as a toothy, draconic monstrosity with a mane of spiny quills, while _Quetzalcoatlus_ has grasping talons and abilities that encourage it to hunt prey from the air and carry victims away into the sky.
-   _Warhammer_: The Lizardmen have units of Terradon and Ripperdactyl Riders, as well as Terradon steeds for heroes and generals, creatures depicted as scaly, floppy-winged, toothy man-eaters with claws strong enough to carry stones to drop on enemies' heads. The Ripperdactyls in particular are highly aggressive, blunt-jawed predators specialized for strafing and attacking land-bound targets.

    Video Games 

-   _ARK: Survival Evolved_: The game's pterosaurs run the gamut:
    -   The _Pteranodon_ has teeth, scales, bat-like wings, and the ability to pick up humans (a technique used by riders to harass enemies).
    -   The _Dimorphodon_ has feathers and Killer Rabbit tendencies.
    -   The _Quetzalcoatlus_ is way bigger than the real thing and strong enough to carry off a mammoth as well as a small building on its back. Ironically, it is portrayed as being constantly airborne like an albatross, despite being one of the most terrestrial of pterosaurs.
    -   The _Tapejara_ has the wrong crest (making it look more like _Tupandactylus_ or _Tupuxuara_, which were once considered synonymous with _Tapejara_), is a carnivore (it probably ate fruit in real life), and has the strength to carry three people and pick up another with its claws.
-   _Banjo-Tooie_:
    -   Terry definitely has teeth, and no end of mucus. For a male, he's awfully possessive about his eggs.
    -   Smaller _Pteranodon_\-like pterosaurs, said Soarasaurus, serve as the Airborne Mooks of Terrydactyland. They are a counterpart of Isle 'O Hags' Gruntydactyls, which are actually dragons or wyverns rather than pterosaurs.
-   _Big Karnak_: Prior to battling Osiris, the god will transform himself into a gigantic purple pterodactyl, backed up by several blue ones, to fight you. Said monster is either Osiris' Attack Animal, or Osiris himself turning into an animal form to fight you before reverting to humkanoid, but it's never explained.
-   _Dino Crisis_ also has pretty stock pterosaurs, which are apparently supposed to be _Pteranodon_. They lack "fur" and are only seen on the ground when they die, flapping pathetically (although they landed in a bipedal stance at one point). They also attack Regina by — you guessed it — hoisting her up into the air with their feet, with one death scene showing them carrying away her 100+ pound corpse. Granted, if they did not attack her it would be a fairly boring game and would make them a pointless enemy, but their motivation is apparently to eat her. Oddly enough, at least one strategy guide points out the errors of a _Pteranodon_ predating on a human and speculates that they are attacking her for territorial reasons.
-   _Dino Rex_: The _Pteranodon_ is shown to be a Maneater, whith one female in particular snatching up the human losers of each match and taking them to her nest to feed them to her hatchlings. She will even occasionally devour them whole!
-   _Dino Trauma_: In outdoor areas, expect pterosaurs to constantly swoop from above and attack you with their beaks. Like every other creature in the game, they're hostile by default.
-   _The Hunter Primal_: The _Quetzalcoatlus_, while physically mainly accurate (they have pycnofibers and a realistic skull shape) show a Kidnapping Bird of Prey\-like behaviour similar to the ones seen in _Primal Carnage_ and _Dino Crisis_ in which they grab the player's character with their feet to then let you free causing to suffer a swift death by showing you how gravity works. Ironically and in spite of the fact that _Quetzalcoatlus_ was one of the most terrestrial species of pterosaur, they are never seen on the ground.
-   _Jurassic Park: The Game_: In episode 2, a _Pteranodon_ (based on _JP III_'s version, down to having teeth) attacks a rescue helicopter for no apparent reason.
-   _Lord of Gun_ has a fire-breathing pterodactyl as one of the two Dual Boss enemies in the swamp level, alongside the tree demon. It swoops in and out of the screen to ambush you periodically.
-   _Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time_: "Pterodactyls" show up in the Jurassic Marsh levels, resembling cartoony toothy _Pteranodon_ but coexisting with "Raptors", Stegosaurus, and T. rex. They're scaly, bipedal, and can pick up zombies with their feet, dropping them off on the near side of your lawn to attack your plants from behind. If charmed by the Perfume-Shroom, however, they carry zombies off the lawn for a One-Hit Kill instead.
-   _Pokémon_: _Pokémon Red and Blue_ gives us Aerodactyl which, despite its name coming from "pterodactyl", barely resembles real pterosaurs at all, looking more like a wyvern than anything else. Later, _Pokémon Gold and Silver_ introduced Skarmory which takes a bit of influence from pop-culture pterosaurs as well, particularly with its _Pteranodon_\-like head with teeth. Both of these have appeared in supplementary material playing the Kidnapping Bird of Prey role a lot of these creatures occupy, with Aerodactyl's very first appearance in the main series anime having it menace the main cast with carnivorous intent and pick up Ash in its talons.
-   _Silent Hill_: The first game features two monsters, the Air Screamer and the Night Flutter, based on illustrations from one of Alessa's favorite books, _The Lost World_ by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. This being _Silent Hill_, the flying horrors haven been twisted by the town, with the Air Screamer resembling a hideously emaciated pterodactyl/bat hybrid and the Night Flutter possessing a human-like body and a wriggling mass of worms for a head.
-   _Sonic and the Secret Rings_ has King Shahryar (played by Dr. Eggman) getting snatched away by a _Pteranodon_, which picks up Shahryar with its beak instead of its feet.

    Web Original 

-   _DinoHunter2's Ages_: The Pterodactyl Legend plays this trope as straight as can be, albeit with traits of various real-world pterosaurs in many of its skins. An almost wyvern-like aerial menace with vulture-like traits, its passive ability enables it to Snatch objects and other Legends with its talons, and its grapple attack has it pick up its enemy and drop it to the ground. It can also Scatter enemy forces with its non-combat "roar" ability (a terrible screech), and its main attacking ability is to rush forward beak-first, allowing it to Spear through multiple opponents.
-   _Mortasheen_, naturally for a creation of Bogleech, has plenty of monster designs inspired by weird and wild real-world biology, so its takes on this trope can get quite odd indeed. Granted, Bogleech normally does his research on the animals his monsters are based on, so it's almost guaranteed that these monsters were intended to be deliberately over-the-top.
    -   One of the oldest monsters in the archive is the Pteracide, an acid-spraying flyer that's next to naked with a skull that looks nothing like any real pterosaur, but is quadrupedal and supports each wing with one finger. Of all the monsters to play with this trope, it's the only one so far that actually uses powered flight, since it was created before Bogleech's design rules for this world came around (one of which is that monsters inspired by winged creatures should generally be flightless, and if there's an exception, it had better be for a very good reason).
    -   The Ectosaur class introduced the Gunkergeist, a flightless ghostly azdharchid with the upper and lower parts of its beak fused together to form a tubular snout. It uses this to spit gobs of Grey Goo at living creatures, converting them into "slime ghouls" which it tends to like a mother bird with its young.
    -   Also from the Ectosaur class, and with even more Body Horror thrown in, is the Vaporgeist. It looks like the Crystal Palace depictions of pterosaurs crossed with a disembodied pair of lungs, bearing a branching tubular snout instead the beak that can spray clouds of poisonous gas.
-   _Neopets_:
-   _RWBY_: The Teryx is a Grimm creature, first seen in Volume 7, resembling a skeletal dinosaur with pterosaur wings on its back. It can grow to almost the size of an Atlesian gunship and, like all creatures of Grimm, is a vicious monster that seeks to cause as much carnage among humanity as it can.
-   _Welcome to Night Vale_:
    -   Subverted; a PTA meeting gets attacked by what Cecil identifies as pteranodons/flying dinosaurs. Later, however, he issues this correction:
        
        _"Secret police are now reporting that the offending beasts were not pteranodons after all, but pterodactyls. Also, pteranodons aren't even dinosaurs, as the station had previously stated — just winged reptiles that lived about 70 million years after pterodactyls."_
        
    -   Subverted again in a later episode. Pteranodons aren't dinosaurs; they're arachnids.
-   The idea of fictional pterosaurs being dragons with the numbers filed off is parodied with relish near the bottom of this comic.

    Western Animation 

-   _Danger Mouse_: A pterodactyl resembling a toothy _Pteranodon_ menaces DM in his flying car in "150 Million Years Lost" and is able to grab the car with its feet.
-   _Dink, the Little Dinosaur_:
    -   The series often features predatory, villainous pterosaurs referred to simply as "Scavengers" (despite the fact that they're always seen hunting the protagonists rather than actually scavenging) that look vaguely like _Cearadactylus_ with stumpy crests like a female _Pteranodon_.
    -   "The Secret" features "Big Wings", which are 80s-styled _Quetzalcoatlus_ that hunt like eagles.
-   _DuckTales_:
    -   One episode of the 1987 series, "Dinosaur Ducks", features a giant "Pterodactyl" that resembles a _Rhamphorhynchus_ with a _Pteranodon_\-like crest, bat-like wings, eagle-like talons, and a bipedal stance. It is shown attacking planes that come across its territory, ripping off the wings of smaller ones with its feet, and it apparently lays oversized eggs in a bird-like nest.
    -   The 2017 reboot portrays its pterosaurs more accurately, though still has instances of this:
        -   The "Meet Scrooge!" short features a bird-footed _Pteranodon_ with two toes in front and one in back, apparently naked (though the art style makes it hard to tell), does not have enough fingers (though that could be chalked up as cartoony art simplicity), and has weird-looking wing membranes attached to the hips.
        -   In "Nightmare on Killmotor Hill!", Lena transforms into a monstrous version of Magica that is reminiscent of this trope, growing bat-like wings with small fingers, but she also drops down on all fours similar to the quadrupedal posture of real pterosaurs.
        -   "Quack Pack!" briefly shows a photo of Donald getting carried off by a _Ludodactylus_\-looking pterosaur with tooth-like serrations lining the beak and bony rods supporting the wing<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . At least it's carrying him with its beak instead of its feet (which still have two toes in front and one in back).
-   _Extreme Dinosaurs_: Bullzeye is a toothed _Pteranodon_ with bat wings, and gains an additional set of arms upon mutation. As a result, he's mistaken for a dragon in one episode.
-   _The Fairly Oddparents_: Any episode that involves dinosaurs or Time Travel will have gigantic pterosaurs that desire to hunt humans for no reason.

-   _Futurama_: "A Clockwork Origin" has a robotic _Pteranodon_ that carries off Fry to feed him to its young.
-   _Gravity Falls_: In "The Land Before Swine", the Pterodactyl is portrayed as an aggressive predator with batlike wings, eagle-like talons, and a fanged beak; first coming to the characters' attention when it snatches up Waddles the pig to carry off to its nest, which is shown to have several human skeletons inside. Later, its newly hatched offspring is ready to eat humans right out of the shell, as shown when it devours Old Man McGucket the moment it hatches.
-   _Il était une fois..._: In "In the Land of the Dinosaurs", the protagonists get attacked by oversized _Rhamphorhynchus_.
-   _Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius_: One episode has a scaly _Pteranodon_ able carry Sheen to its nest using its feet.
-   _Jonny Quest_: Turu the trained (and toothed) _Pteranodon_ is depicted as gigantic and bipedal, and is shown grabbing Dr. Quest with his feet and carrying him away through the air. He is unrealistically durable, surviving multiple hits from bazooka rounds (although they eventually send him plummeting to his doom into a tar pit).
    
    Turu reappears briefly on _The Venture Bros._, since it was inspired by and occasionally crosses over with _Jonny Quest_. In "Venture Libre", Turu is Dr. Venture's first taste of the weirdness going on in the jungle of Puerta Bahia, which his own rogue creation has turned into a refuge for victims of unethical super science. Though still enormous, grasping and damaging a jet the size of a Concorde, this incarnation of Turu has no teeth-like serrations on his bill. The tendency to mix up pterosaur species is lampshaded when one of the refugees demands that Dr. Venture be killed for being a super scientist and for murdering Turu:
    
    **Dr. Venture:** Is Turu a pterodactyl?  
    **Carl the Cheetah-Man:** _Pteranodon_, you monster!  
    **Venturestein:** See, he not even good at science.
    
-   _Justice League Action_: In "Booster's Gold", Green Arrow is attacked by a prehistoric flying reptile and correctly identifies it as a pterosaur. Then, less than a minute later, he refers to it as a dinosaur. So close.
-   _The Simpsons_: The final segment of "Treehouse of Horror XXIX", parodying _Jurassic Park_, has Agnes Skinner transforming into a bipedal pterosaur that tries to eat people (namely her son's arms).
-   _The Transformers_: "Dinobot Island Part 1" features all kinds of Mesozoic reptiles, including a pterosaur<small>◊</small> which decides that one of the Token Human characters is a snack.
