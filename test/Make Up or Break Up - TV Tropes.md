_"Break up to make up  
That's all we do  
First you love me  
Then you hate me  
That's a game for fools."_

— The Stylistics, "Break up to make up"

There are probably only so many things a story can examine about a romantic relationship. This is one of the big ones.

For two characters, Will They or Won't They? has gone by, and they've become a couple. Now, something — infidelity, voting for the wrong political party, or even _slurping soup_ in a really irritating way — has happened and one party has to decide if they can bear it for all time.

The cause of the breach is presented here as both serious and silly (_Because, brother, that soup thing is just **nasty!**_), to highlight that the instigation is not the thing. The story will examine how the offended party comes to grips with it. Sometimes the decision will come down on the Make Up side, and sometimes it will not.

Also see Feud Episode. Frequently used to reassert Status Quo Is God, or as a way to Retcon a relationship (in that case, they will not only break up, but the relationship will quickly be forgotten as if it never happened.) Compare Toilet Seat Divorce.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Charlotte_: Happens in the first episode to Yu and Yumi. He is forced to transfer to Hoshinoumi Academy, which is really far away from her school. He is also unable to visit her without supervision, and she's unwilling to constantly visit him lest she seem like a stalker. As a result, she feels it's best to cut their losses there, though he doesn't take it too well, and has the same shocked look on his face after going home.

    Comic Books 

-   _Spider-Man_: In _Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man_ #98, Peter Parker learns that Felicia Hardy's new luck-manipulation superpowers were courtesy of the Kingpin, who gave them to her to sabotage their relationship.

    Fan Works 

-   _What It Takes_: Oliver/Felicity does not end well in this story. They begin the story seemingly happy in Bali, but after Oliver starts getting homesick, their relationship begins falling apart, as Felicity refuses to go back to Starling or let Oliver go back himself. When Oliver finds out that Felicity has been keeping him Locked Out of the Loop in regards to what's happening in Starling, you can pinpoint the _exact moment_ whatever feelings he had for her die, and they subsequently break up because Felicity refuses to admit her actions were wrong and implicitly claims that in order for the relationship to work, he needs to always put her first. In the final chapter, they have one last video chat, where Oliver apologizes for leading Felicity on and making her believe he was in love with her, but also refuses to absolve her for her actions in keeping him in the dark, making Felicity more than happy to wash her hands of him for not letting her get the last word in. In return, after confirming Felicity is safe and not in danger, Oliver is perfectly content to forget that she was ever a part of his life, being more interested in looking forward to his happy future with Laurel.

        -   It's even invoked by the recurring villain intentionally in the season 8 finale. After Bones proposes to Booth, the villain (who can't stand not being the focus of their attention, forces Booth to turn her down by threatening to murder random civilians if he doesn't (and he can't tell anyone why either). The two are still together, but after finally letting down her last wall and getting rejected, Bones is obviously crushed
