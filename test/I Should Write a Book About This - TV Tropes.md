Bilbo writes his memoirs: _There And Back Again: A Hobbit's Holiday_

**Hammond:** You ever think of writing a book about your exploits in the line of duty?  
**O'Neill:** I've thought about it. But then I'd have to shoot anyone that actually read it.

At the end of a movie or story, a character is shown to have written a book related to the experiences in the movie, usually after they settle down and have their happy ending.

If it happens at the end of a book, the implication is that you have just read that book; sometimes it's stated a lot more bluntly. Sometimes the first thing they write is the first thing you read: the passage becomes literal Bookends.

This is usually a straight out invocation of Direct Line to the Author, with the implication that anything that doesn't quite make sense was due to the main character forgetting things, being mistaken, guessing wrong about events that they didn't personally witness, or lying for the sake of practicality.

A more recent variation more common in film and television is to end with a film or television series being produced about the events. Many times the ending itself will switch from "reality" to the film under production before the camera pulls back to reveal the set and crew. Often this will involve self-mockery, the story being Recycled In Space or another increase in weirdness.

May be responded to with Who Would Want to Watch Us?. If the title of the created work is also the title of the work, see Metafictional Title. Compare with Narrator All Along and Tagalong Chronicler. Write What You Know and Write Who You Know occur when an author draws general inspiration from their experiences or people in their lives. Also see Writing About Your Crime. It's for a Book is when writing becomes an excuse for dubious interests. Don't confuse with Wrote the Book, as there they may not have literally written a book.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Astra Lost in Space_: By the time the cast gets home, one of them does, in fact, write about their experiences in space. It becomes a bestseller.
-   Sayuri Ibe in _Asteroid in Love_ attempts invoking this when the incident regarding Ao's impending move out of town is resolved by Ao and Mira living together, since she is one of the people invited to the Earth Sciences Club to brainstorm this issue. Upon hearing the resolution in Episode 9 / Chapter 28, she tells Ao and Mira the entire story "sounds like it comes straight out of a soap drama" and would like to write it in the school newspaper, but they run away before Sayuri has the chance to interview them deeper.
-   The endings of both the anime and the manga versions of _Chrono Crusade_ feature this in the end, although in two separate ways. In the manga, there's some brief quotations from Azmaria's memoir about her adventures with Chrono and Rosette. In the anime, Joshua is shown working on a storybook about "a boy that goes on an adventure with his sister and a demon to see the astraline!" referring to Rosette and Chrono. However, the horns damaged his mind so much that those are the _only_ memories he seems to have of the two of them.
-   In the penultimate episode of _Comic Girls_, Kaos-chan's manga that finally gets accepted is ''Comic Girls".
-   _Digimon_:
    -   In the season one dub Tai (Taichi) says, "This would make one great story. Of course no one would ever believe it."
    -   The end of the second season has TK (Takeru in the Japanese version), who has written books based on their adventures in the Digital World.
-   In a slight variation, at the end of _Eyeshield 21_, the quarterback for the Alexanders and aspiring mangaka says that she was ordered to write a manga about Eyeshield 21. She just wants to draw shoujo, though.
-   Throughout _Fairy Tail_, Lucy is slowly writing about her adventures and making it into a novel. In the epilogue of the series, it is published and becomes a best seller.
-   At the end of _Jaco the Galactic Patrolman_ Tights is mentioned having become a successful science fiction writer, with her debut novel being a No Celebrities Were Harmed version of the manga. It was her only failure.
-   Chapter 191 of _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_ spin-off series _We Want to Talk About Kaguya_ has Ishigami giving Karen the idea for a series where two characters engage in a Duel of Seduction based on a conversation he had with Shirogane back in Chapter 162 of the main series. She immediately gets to work on something that she titles _Kaguya-sama Wants to be Confessed To_ and comments that it's a good enough idea to win the Shogakukan Manga Award. This is actually a bit of Ascended Fanon, as Karen being the in-universe author of the series had been a popular fan theory ever since the reveal early on that she drew Real-Person Fics about Kaguya and Shirogane.
-   In _Kore wa Koi no Hanashi_, this is suggested in the beginning. Oogaki thinks that Haruka's presence around Shinichi could result in a love story with a large age-gap and tells Shinichi, that he should write such a story. Shinichi begins to write the romance novel, though he insists at times that the concept is similar and not about their own age-gap.
-   Inverted in _Princess Tutu_: Fakir Rewrites Reality at different points (thus, he writes "about" the events of the story), however, the first time he does it successfully (and possibly with all of the others), he burns the "story" afterwards.
-   Mizuki Kawashita drew a manga adaptation of Chikamatsu Monzaemon's play _Sonezaki Shinju_ (The Lovers' Suicide at Sonezaki) in which Tokube and Hatsu faked their famous double suicide and ran away, and that Tokube wrote the play using Chikamatsu Monzaemon as his pen name.
-   _Summer Time Rendering_: In the Shadow free world, Hizuru is inspired by Shinpei's dreams of the events of the shadow filled timelines to start writing a new book entitled "Summer Time Rendering".
-   In _Tegami Bachi: Letter Bee_, Vincent Alcott is a down-in-the-dumps writer we meet in the first season who wanted desperately to be a great writer is an utter failure. Then in Letter Bee Reverse (season 2), during the final battle against Cabernet, he's scribbling in a notebook. It's later revealed that dear old Vincent wrote about it and got famous.
-   Much of the last several chapters of _Wandering Son_ revolves around Nitori writing what essentially is a novel version of the series.

    Comic Books 

-   _The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck:_ Every issue starts with a panel of someone (revealed to be Scrooge's sister Matilda) putting together a scrap-book out of letters, news-paper clippings and photos that are relevant to the issue at hand. In the pen-ultimate chapter Scrooge makes his greatest failure and falls out with his family, and in that one the scrapbook is closed, with the author leaving it in a huff. The final chapter starts with an extended Citizen Kane inspired news reel instead.The later written midquels that told side-stories from in and around Life and Time, the story would often start with The Triplets leafing through the scrap-book, finding one inconsistency or another, inspiring Scrooge to tell them the story.
-   _W.I.T.C.H._:
    -   The original comic has the oracle showing the girls a possible future, to cheer them up, where they all reunite as adults. Adult Will then reveals that she just wrote a book about their adventures as Magical Girls.
    -   In the short stories published during the New Power Saga alongside the main saga, Will got roped into writing the subject of a musical. She wrote a musical version of the first arc.
-   A spoof: there was a series of one-shots in which Goofy is a historical or famous literary character. As Ulysses (in his adventure with the Cyclops), he ends the story by saying the trope name. Mickey (as Diomedes) then points out that he is illiterate. Goofy then says he'll just get himself a ghost writer, turns to a crewman and goes "Right, Homeros?".
-   In _JSA: The Golden Age_, this was Tarantula's last thought before he was killed by Dynaman.
-   _Astro City_ has the cosmic-powered superhero, Starfighter, who retires from heroics and writes about his past adventures as a hobby.
-   The final page of _Red Sonja_: _The Forgiving of Monsters_ shows Halayah scribing Sonja's stories for posterity, starting with the first scene of _Queen of Plagues_.
-   _The Ultimates_: A modern variation: the security tapes of the fight of the Ultimates against Hulk are released to the public as a blockbuster DVD.
-   _The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Cartoonist_: After a health scare Adrian goes into a rant about his life and his views on his career and family. Twenty minutes later he gets up and starts a comic set in "Fresno, 1982", the setting of the comic's A Minor Kidroduction, implying that the incident is what inspired him to write this book.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Madam & Eve_:
    -   One story arc (starting here) features Eve writing and starring in a play about working for the Andersons. They don't find it funny, but it becomes a critical success.
    -   Another arc had Eve write a novel about her job, but it's rejected by the publisher because the characters are unbelievable.

    Fan Works 

-   In _God Slaying Blade Works_, Illya starts working on a manga based on the events of the Fifth Holy Grail War. Of course, she changes several names and details.
-   In the final episode of _Pretty Cure Perfume Preppy_, Chloe decides to write about everything that happened.
-   _Turnabout Storm_:
    -   In a variation mixed with Shout-Out, Twilight suggests Apple Bloom to write a book about the strange incident she claims to have gone through in the Everfree Forest.
    -   In a straight example, the credits and the "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue start off with the cover of a novel based on the events of the series written by Apple Bloom herself, titled _Turnabout Storm_.
-   The _Twice Upon an Age_ series plays with the fact that Varric Tethras writes books about the events in the _Dragon Age_ games. In these stories, he's the editor instead, with the fic author collaborating with him on the project. One of the side volumes, _Agents Acquired_, fills the trope more literally - he gets a letter from Sera with a suggestion and decides that "we" should write a story about her suggestion, except that by "we" he really means the fic author.
-   In _Rainbow Brite and the War of Darkness_, it's shown that Brian told his father about his adventures in Rainbow Land. This ultimately led to a short-lived cult classic cartoon and a film (AKA, the canon _Rainbow Brite_ cartoon and film). The show was unauthorized and most of it was inaccurate fluff aimed at kids. Rainbow's _real_ life wasn't suitable for children.
-   The final panel of _Jon (Gale Galligan)_ depicts Jon drawing a panel of _Garfield_ based on his pets.
-   _Christian Grey vs. Pepper Potts_ ends with Leslie James, a well-known writer of bodice rippers (and a pseudonym for John Allerdyce/Pyro), deciding to write a book based on the events of the story under the moniker E.L. James.
-   The _My-HiME_ fanfic, _Elementary My Dear Natsuki_. Inverted. Natsuki didn't set out to write a story, just to set down the events of "The Adventure of the Reigate Squire" on paper to keep them straight in her head, only to find out that it reads much like her favorite detective stories. After some teasing from Shizuru, Natsuki submitted it to _The Strand_ and found that not only did they publish it, they also paid well for it and asked for more. She comes to suspect that Shizuru had been hoping for just such an outcome.
-   _Date a density_: Nia Honjou publishes mangas based on the adventures Shidou and the Spirits share, as a continuation of the manga that chronicled their adventures that they made to win her over. In the final chapter, she makes a manga that covers the final battle with Isaac Wescott, but changes the ending so that Shidou and Gilgamesh faded away, causing all the girls to swear to become good enough to reach the Throne of Heroes so they can see Shidou again. Maria calls her out on this because they both survived and are living in peace with them. Annoyed, Nia says she thought a dramatic Bittersweet Ending would be more popular.

    Films — Animated 

-   In _Alice in Wonderland (1951)_, Alice says while walking through the Tulgey Wood: "When I get home, I shall write a book about this place. …if I ever _do_ get home…". We all know this happened.
-   Near the end of the original VHS release of _Monster Mash (2000)_, an Animated Musical loosely based on Bobby "Boris" Pickett's hit song The Monster Mash, Drac, Frank and Wolf become movie producers and Wolf expresses interest in creating an animated musical based on their latest exploits. The NCircle Entertainment DVD release omits this scene.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   By the end of _All Too Well: The Short Film_ the woman has written a book presumably about the heartache of her youth as her ex-boyfriend looks on from outside a book reading.
-   George McFly, at the end of _Back to the Future_, has written a book inspired by Marty's radiation-suited visit to him in 1955.
-   The film _Better Than Chocolate_ ends with the revelation that the protagonist eventually published a book called (wait for it...) _Better Than Chocolate_.
-   _The Case for Christ_: At the end of the movie, Lee Strobel's wife Leslie suggests that Lee write a book documenting the research he has done throughout the film.
-   _Chasing Amy_.
    -   Similarly, the adventures of Jay and Silent Bob in _Mallrats_ and _Clerks_ becomes "Bluntman and Chronic."
-   _Clash of the Titans_ ends with Ammon mentioning to Bubo that the tale would make a fine heroic poem or play.
-   In _Dragonheart_, poetry-loving monk Brother Gilbert is trying to write an epic like _Gilgamesh_, and decides to frame it around the adventures of the protagonist Bowen. Not a book per se, but as the film takes place in a time before novels were common, it otherwise fits.
-   The movie _Duplex_ has the main character trying and failing to write a book throughout the movie, mostly due to his upstairs tenant. The end of the movie shows his published novel, also titled _Duplex_, presumably about the events he experienced during the movie.
-   At the end of _The Egg and I_, Claudette Colbert turns to the camera and says, "I could write a book!"
-   One of the events depicted in the epilogue of _Elf_ shows Buddy adapting his experiences into a bestselling children's book.
-   At the end of _Enchanted_, Nathaniel has written a self-help book, and Pip has written a memoir.
-   Another "make a film" example: a Running Gag throughout the movie _Get Shorty_ is Chilli Palmer working on a pitch for a gangster film which gives off some of the backstory for his reason to be in L.A. The very last scene is the filming of the movie of the events of the film. The aftermath of said filming (the In-Universe movie was good enough to merit a sequel, but the reception of it was bad enough (many people crying out Sequelitis) that Chili got fed up with filmmaking) is mentioned on the first act of the _actual_ sequel _Be Cool_.
-   _The Great Gatsby (2013)_ ends with Nick writing the story down and sending it to a publisher.
-   _The Hard Way_ is an example of the "produce a movie about the events of the movie", with actor Nick Lang starring a film called "The Good, The Badge and The Ugly", in which he drops a This Is Reality speech told to him by Cowboy Cop Moss. Moss complains that Lang _stole_ the speech from him as he sees it.
-   _Hook_: Wendy reveals that everyone in the real world knows about Peter Pan because James Barrie wrote a book based on Wendy's stories about him.
-   At the end of _John Carter_, the titular character tells his nephew Edgar Rice Burroughs to do something with his life, like travel or write a book. The implication is that the _John Carter of Mars_ books are the result.
-   _A Knight's Tale_ ends with Paul Bettany's Geoffrey Chaucer saying that he should write the events of the film as a story. Bonus points for also including the implication that the story could be _The Canterbury Tales_.
-   _Koko and the Ghosts_ begins with a news story about the protagonists' previous exploits having inspired a children's book. The film ends with the same news reporter asking our hero if another book were to be written based on the events of the film, what title he would give it. Cut to the film's title as the credits roll.
-   _Little Women (1994)_: Jo is inspired to write a novel about her life with her sisters when going through her sister Beth's things after she dies. (This does not happen in the book, although the Jo of the books does become a successful author.)
-   _Logan_ has Wolverine state that "maybe a third" of the material presented in the _X-Men_ comics actually happened, and not in the way that they say it did. It's implied that this applies to the Loose Canon of the other films, as well.
-   _The Lonely Guy_: Larry, the titular "lonely guy", is an aspiring author who is trying (and failing) to write a romance novel. Eventually he gives up on that and writes _A Guide for the Lonely Guy_ instead, based on his experience of the single life over the course of the movie. Oddly, this is well before the movie ends.
-   _Maybe Baby_ starts revolving around this premise midway through, where Sam Bell starts writing about his wife Lucy's and his conception difficulties as a screenplay.
-   In _Misery_, Paul's agent pitches him the idea of writing a non-fiction book regarding his experience, he elegantly disregards it as a cheap shenanigan.
-   _Moulin Rouge!_ uses Christian writing a book as Book Ends for the film's story. Satine even tells him when she dies that he needs to write their story.
-   In the third _The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor_ film, we learn that Evie has done just this, publishing the books as fiction.
-   Near the end of _My Sassy Girl_, the main character Gyeon-woo not only written a book based on the movie's events, but it's being made into a movie... Wait...
-   In the Jackie Chan fantasy film _The Myth_, his character has written a book of the same name at the end of the movie, and it is dedicated to his Dead Sidekick.
-   In _National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets_, Riley has written a book about the events of the first movie and other conspiracies.
-   Revealed at the end of the Hallmark holiday movie _November Christmas_ by the protagonist.
-   The film version of _On the Road_ ends with Sal Paradise, quite appropriately, typing out his experiences on a long scroll. It's mostly appropriate, except that the real-life Jack Kerouac didn't finish the novel for years later, causing many of his fans to believe he was still a twentysomething adventurer, when in reality he was a middle-aged alcoholic suffering from chronic depression.
-   Francis Ford Coppola's _The Outsiders_ opens with Pony Boy writing the story in class.
-   _Race to Witch Mountain_: Jack Bruno does just that.
-   In-universe, the protagonist of _Repo Men_ writes _The Repossession Mambo_, which is the title of the Real Life novel on which the film was based. He does this in the _middle_ of the movie, and kills an attacker with the manual typewriter he'd just finished writing it with.
-   At the end of _Ring Of Bright Water_, Gavin Maxwell decides to write a book about his experiences with the otters. Justified since it's Based on a True Story, and he did.
-   _Romancing the Stone_ reveals at the end that Joan Wilder's latest book is suspiciously similar to the events of the movie we just watched, although the ending is a little different.
-   In _Scream 2_, Courteney Cox's character has written a book about the first movie, which has been made into a movie, _Stab_. By _Scream 3_, she's written a book about the second movie, which has been made into a movie. _Scream 3_ follows the production of a third, obviously fictionalised _Stab_ featuring the original characters. No doubt Gail wrote a book about it. (_Scream 4_ however shows that protagonist sued to prevent a movie adapting the Troubled Production that was _Stab 3_; the series went on anyway, with increasingly weird directions)
-   In the sequel _Shanghai Knights_, Roy O'Bannon has published books vaguely based on the first movie _Shanghai Noon_
-   _The Spanish Apartment_ is narrated from the perspective of the main character, as he's writing a book about the story.
-   The events of _Stand by Me_ are being told in a book written by the now-adult main character (also the narrator), which he is shown finishing at the end.
-   _Star Wars_ might be an example of this. Among Lucas's unrealized (but still possibly canon) ideas was to have R2 record the events of the films, then relay them in the distant future to "the Keeper of the Whills".
-   In _There Goes My Baby_, at the end of the "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue the adult Mary Beth reveals that she had written a book about the movie's plot and dedicated the book to her best friends.
-   In _A Thousand Words_, Jack is shown bringing the book to his own publishing company to work out a deal.
-   _Throw Momma from the Train_
    -   The bonus: _two_ completely different books about the same events.
-   In _The Umbrella Coup_, Pierre Richard's character only realizes that he has been involved in a mafia Mob War at the end of the movie, when his partner (an undercover policewoman) spells it out for him (throughout the movie, he thinks he has been hired by a movie studio for some method acting). He then decides that the story would make for a great movie. Cut to the epilogue — he is now a celebrated film director at Cannes with Money to Burn.
-   _The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent_ has Nicolas Cage agree at roughly the start of Act II to help aspiring screenwriter Javi Gutierrez write a script for Nick's next movie, which Javi decides to revolve around their budding friendship.
-   At the end of the Bela Lugosi movie _Voodoo Man_, a producer considers making the events of the film into a movie. The hero suggests that Lugosi would be a perfect choice to play the villain.
-   At the end of _Wes Craven's New Nightmare_, the evil has been defeated and Resealed away now that Wes has finished the screenplay portraying it. Heather Langenkamp and her son read from the screenplay, which depicts the first scenes of the movie.
-   Bob's "Death Therapy" book in the epilogue of _What About Bob?_

    Literature 

-   In the first _Animorphs_ book, Jake writes that he's "writing this so more people can learn the truth", implying that he and the others are writing the series as events unfold.
-   _The Book of Lost Things_ has this near the end. It states that the book you're reading is the one the character wrote. It then gets confusing because things happen in the end that doesn't happen until after he wrote it and published. So you're reading things in his book that the character says he wrote but couldn't have despite actually happening.
    -   Well, he obviously didn't have Protection From Supernatural Editors.
-   _The Lord of the Rings_ has Bilbo's and Frodo's _The Red Book of Westmarch_, a continuation of Bilbo's _There and Back Again: A Hobbit's Holiday by Bilbo Baggins_. With an ending by Samwise, of course. And then found and translated long after by J. R. R. Tolkien, of course.
-   Q in the _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ novel _Q-Squared_:
    
    **Q**: Make a hell of a log entry, don't you think. Captain's log, stardate yakkity-yak. Got up. Brushed teeth. Charted some stars. Saved the universe. Had dinner. Brushed teeth, went to bed.
    
-   _Atonement_ is an odd case, because Briony admits to having changed the ending because it would have been too depressing otherwise. The movie makes it clear that Robbie and Cecilia died rather than living happily ever after.
-   At the end of _Things Fall Apart_, one of the Evil White Colonialists is writing a book called something like "The Pacification of the Tribes of the Lower River Niger." Bit of a subversion, in that he imagines that the incident he has just witnessed - Okonkwo's suicide - might make up a good chapter of padding, or a paragraph at least.
-   A very common 19th-century literary device. In Charles Dickens' _David Copperfield_ and Jonathan Swift's _Gulliver's Travels_, the book is written by the hero, as a memoir of the events narrated, and will make occasional references to the present ("Looking back upon that time, I feel...").
-   Happens at the end of some Enid Blyton adventure stories like The Famous Five.
-   Lots of Roald Dahl stories end like this, usually with the very strong implication that the book they wrote is the one you just finished reading.
    -   _James and the Giant Peach_ even ends with, "And _that_ is what you have just finished reading."
    -   _The BFG_ outright says so: "But where, you might ask, is this book that the BFG wrote? It's right here. You've just finished reading it."
-   _Dead Lies Dreaming_: Finale Title Drop as the title of the movie that Imp is planning to make, and he mused on his adventure as inspiration for a movie in any case.
-   _The Outsiders_ ends with the protagonist being assigned to write five pages about his own life and asking "Can it be longer?". The final line of the book is Ponyboy writing the first line of the book. One wonders as to how the teacher felt about grading a 180-page novel.
    -   Plus, the fact the author wrote it BECAUSE she saw something at school and said (paraphase), "I should write a book about this!"
-   _I, Claudius_ is framed as the Emperor Claudius' autobiography.
-   In the Japanese _Ring/Ringu_ series of books, many of the events from the first book (_Ring_) have been publicized as a novel with talks of a movie in the second (_Spiral_). Unfortunately, these methods are also new and somewhat Squicky methods through which Sadako can reproduce.
-   Played with in the most recent _Thursday Next_ book: the _Thursday Next_ books as they exist in Thursday's world evidently bear little resemblance to the events as we read them, and Thursday is very unhappy with the way she is portrayed. To make things more complicated, as Thursday can travel into novels, she ends up meeting versions of herself as she appears within the books. However, at the end, the books are being rewritten and it is strongly implied that these new editions are the series we know.
-   At the end of Charles Stross's _Saturn's Children_, we learn that the book we have just read is a message Freya is about to send back to her sisters on Earth, to warn them that their supposedly long-dead mother Rhea is still alive and dangerously insane.
-   _Be More Chill_ has Jeremy asking the Squip to use its energy to write down everything that just happened in hopes that the story will eventually make its way to Christine.
-   At the end of Jodie Picoult's _Vanishing Acts,_ the Unlucky Childhood Friend and journalist character reveals towards the end that he has been writing - surprise! - a book about this entire event. However, there's the fact that the book was written in first-person, revolving between the four main characters, so this means that the guy was obsessing over the thoughts of the girl he's been in love with since he was a kid. Romantic or Squicky?
-   The book _Freaky Friday_ turns out to be Annabelle's English project, though the events were supposed to have really happened.
-   _Fun Jungle_: The chaotic climax of _Whale Done_ takes place at a Hollywood party. The host is more amused than offended and, after learning that this kind of thing happens to Teddy a lot, proposes making a movie about him.
-   At the end of _Nausea_, by Jean-Paul Sartre, the protagonist decides he wants to write a novel.
-   Nate from _The Enormous Egg_ writes down the events of the book on his dad's advice.
-   The second Artemis Fowl novel implies this in its opening.
-   The _Sherlock Holmes_ stories are presented as the memoirs of Dr. Watson. At the end of the first one, Watson tells Holmes: "Your merits should be publicly recognized. You should publish an account of the case. If you won't, I will for you."
    -   Mark Frost's _The List of 7_ has an similar example. The novel centers around a young Arthur Conan Doyle becoming embroiled in a conspiracy against Queen Victoria, during which he is befriended by a dashing, yet mysterious (and potentially unstable) detective named Jack Sparks. At the end of the novel, he learns that Sparks had apparently died in battle with his hated brother, and chooses to immortalize Sparks by writing a series of novels about him renaming Sparks' character as "Sherlock Holmes".
-   Much like the Holmes example, his Evil Counterpart _Raffles_ has his own chronicler, Bunny, and the stories are all framed as Bunny's memoirs.
-   _I Am the Messenger_, which ends with the author delivering the text of the novel to the main character, who then decides to rewrite it in his own words. Whether the text you're reading has been written by the author or said character is up for interpretation.
-   In _These Happy Golden Years_ by Laura Ingalls Wilder, Laura's older sister Mary, visiting home after enrolling in a school for the blind, confides to Laura that she's planning to write a book about her experience. She then observes that she'd once thought she'd become a schoolteacher before she went blind and now Laura is doing that for her, so maybe Laura will write the book - a suggestion which Laura finds hilarious.
    
    "I, write a book?" Laura hooted. She said blithely, "I'm going to be an old maid schoolteacher like Ms. Wilder. Write your own book."
    
-   Used in the novel _Murder In Moultonboro_ (which you haven't heard of; everyone who has knows the author personally). The hero, Harry, doesn't initially like the idea, though. When Harry's friends suggest that he write a book about some of his strange cases, he answers, "What the hell would I do with a book like that... shim up my fridge?"
-   Lemony Snicket _A Series of Unfortunate Events_ books. There's even an "unauthorized autobiography" on "Lemony Snicket".
-   _Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor_. Throughout the book there are references to pulpy holothrillers with names like "Luke Skywalker and the Dragons of Tatooine", and at the end we find that the character who researched and wrote up something about the Mindor incident sold it to one of the holothriller companies for an absurd sum of cash. Luke's not happy about this, but grudgingly gives in and insists on some rewrites. It doesn't matter if the holothrillers liked it as it was, he can be very persuasive.
-   The classic book _Interview with the Vampire_ (and the movie too, I would guess) is an interview done by a guy with a vampire. It is implied that Louis (the vampire) destroyed the record afterwards, but in the next book n the series (_The Vampire Lestat_) the book has been published to the world. Then Lestat himself took over that custom and started writing his adventures, with each successive book referencing the former one.
-   Megan Whalen Turner's _The Thief_ implies that Gen wrote the book chronicling his adventures at the request of his sovereign.
-   Tried (not particularly effectively) by William Goldman in _The Color Of Light_. It's glaringly obvious throughout the novel that it's an edited version of his own life, including tons of shoutouts to his previous stories. The novel ends with him deciding to turn his life into a novel. It's a pointless ending at best.
-   _Prom_ by Laurie Halse Anderson ends with the narrator musing that she's a pretty good authority on "normal kids" such as herself, and that she _could_ even write a book about them, making this example a little more ambiguous than others (it could just be irony of the This Is Reality variety).
-   Although Marcel Proust has repeatedly stated that _In Search Of Lost Time_ was in no way autobiographical, it is pretty clear by the end of _Time Regained_ that the narrator, who has discovered his artistic vocation, plans to write the very book we are reading.
-   In "The Invention of Hugo Cabret" Hugo isn't content to just write his story. He builds a human-shaped clockwork automaton that writes out the entire book and draws all the pictures with a dip pen every time it's turned on. Quite the feat considering that this book is as thick as one of the later "Harry Potter"s.
-   _The Saga of Darren Shan_ ends like this when vampire Darren sends his journals to alternate-timeline fiction-writer Darren to be published into a novel.
-   _The First Wives Club_ ends with one of the women producing a book she's written about the events of the novel, entitled "The First Wives Club."
-   Christopher Moore's _Bloodsucking Fiends_ ends with Tommy suggesting he's going to write a book, presumably about the events of the trilogy.
-   Implied (or at least, hypothesized by fans) about _The Dresden Files_. In a recent book, we learned that Harry's mentor keeps journals of his own life and career, and his own mentor did as well, forming a tradition of wizards' journals going back centuries. A brief excerpt Harry reads is sort of in First-Person Smartass format, which fits the mentor's personality but also fits Harry's personality and the series' own narrative style. So some think that the series itself is Harry's contribution to that legacy.
    -   There's the fact that the narration is in past tense, but some details are given in present tense ('I did X, Y and Z, then went back to my apartment. My apartment is...') which would be consistent with Harry writing about events a short time after they've taken place.
    -   The roleplaying game and several other supplemental materials refer to Harry's "case files" referring to the events of several novels, and named as the books themselves.
-   _Mr. Small_, an entry in Roger Hargreaves' _Mr. Men_ series, depicts Mr. Small attempting to hold down a variety of jobs. He eventually meets an author who writes children's books; after hearing Mr. Small describe his adventures, he decides to write a book about them. It is explicitly stated that the reader has just read the book in question.
-   In Stephen Lawhead's _Song of Albion_, the entire trilogy is a set of books written by the narrator. The final sentence of the third book is the first sentence of the first book:
    
    "It all began with the aurochs."
    
-   At the end of _The General Series_ by David Drake and S. M. Stirling, one of Center's predictions is that Barton Foley will win an award for writing Raj Whitehall's biography.
-   Loial's goal throughout The Wheel of Time series is to write a record of Rand and company's exploits.
-   A mind-warpingly meta example is implied by much of _The Chronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica._ To wit: Most of the Caretakers of the Geographica are famous authors, especially of sci-fi and fantasy. The implication is pretty strong that they get a lot of their ideas from the Archipelago.
-   In Jack Williamson's _Darker Than You Think,_ one of the characters plans to write a book warning the world about the Witch Breed but it—the book you're reading—is dismissed as pulp fantasy.
-   At the close of T. H. White's _The Once and Future King_, King Arthur on the eve of a great battle asks his page Tom to ride home to Warwickshire and to tell people about the King’s idea, that force should only be used for justice. The boy kneels to kiss the King’s hand before he goes, “his surcoat, with the Malory bearings, looking absurdly new”. It would be Sir Thomas Malory who would write _Le Morte D Arthur_.
-   Implied at the end of Peter Ackroyd's novel _Chatterton_.
-   _The Abomination_, the final novel in _The Omen_ series (which followed a different continuty from the movies after the third) ends with one of the characters deciding to write about the events he encountered. The book then ends with the opening lines of his novel, which are the same as the opening lines of the first novel, _Armageddon 2000_.
-   At the end of _A Macabre Myth of a Moth-Man_, Nina tells Moth-man how she's written the whole adventure they were on down in her diary. Moth-man recommends she hold on to it, in case she ever wants to turn it into a book. To account for how his chapters are in first person, he also suggests she switch to first person for him, so he seems more like a private eye from some detective noir film.
-   _Razorland Trilogy_: Morrow, in _Horde_, repeatedly talks about writing his experiences down in a book and follows through with it at the end.
-   The titular character of the _Alice Series_ decides at the end of the last book when she has hit her 60th birthday to write a series of books about what it's like to grow up as the only girl in a small family, who lost her mother when young and her experiences with her three best friends and marrying her childhood sweetheart.
-   In the _Mortal Engines_ Quartet, the final scene of the last book ends with Shrike reciting the first chapter of the first book to a captive audience.
-   In the fourth book of the _Inda_ series, it's revealed that Fox is writing a book about Inda and his own experiences with Inda. That book becomes important to the plot of _Banner of the Damned_, sequel to the Inda series and set in the same world but 400 years later. Whether Fox's memoir actually _is_ the Inda series is uncertain.
-   At the end of _The Sussex Downs Murder_, the police officer in charge of the investigation explains to one of the witnesses how he solved the crime. The witness in question is an author of detective stories, who decides to write a fictionalised account of the case. The last chapter is the opening paragraph of his account, which is the first paragraph of the book.
-   In _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_, Alice muses (while trapped in the White Rabbit's house due to her new gigantic size) that "there ought to be a book written about her," and plans to do just that when she grows up—only to realize that she's technically grown "up" right now, and there's no room to write.
-   Each of the novels in Cherry Wilder's _Torin_ trilogy is an account written for posterity by that novel's protagonist. The narrator/protagonist of the second novel mentions that she's not much of a storyteller and that she's only doing it because she was asked to specially by the narrator/protagonist of the first novel, who'd missed some important events that she'd been present for.
-   John Wyndham was rather fond of this trope: _The Midwich Cuckoos_, _The Day of the Triffids_ and _The Kraken Wakes_ all use it as a framing device for the first-person narrative. _Day of the Triffids_ takes it still further by briefly mentioning another character who did much the same thing, and a third who said he intended to do the same, but didn't survive the Cosy Catastrophe and get the chance.
-   In the first Sven Hassel novel _Legion of the Damned_, Sven keeps saying he's going to write a book about everything they've gone through as soldiers in a penal regiment in Hitler's army. His colleagues, having long since crossed the Despair Event Horizon, say that no-one will bother to read it.
-   In the Italian childrens' book series _Bat Pat_, all the books are supposedly written by Bat Pat himself as retellings of his many adventures.
-   _Nina Tanleven_: _The Ghost Wore Gray_ reveals that Nine kept a sort of diary of their adventures in the first book, and editor Mona Curtis, after reading some of it, offers to help her turn it into a book for kids; further discussion on it is involved in _The Ghost in the Big Brass Bed_. Coupled with the way the narration goes (the first book alone includes lines like “Her actual words would probably burn this page” and “He also said several other things, but I had better not put them on paper”), it gives the implication that Nine eventually _did_ turn her adventures into books.
-   _Washio Sumi Is a Hero_: Sonoko's a great writer even at eleven. She mentions wanting to one day write a novel loosely based on her friends.
-   This is all implied during the _The Birthday Blues Knows_ novel that the Tantei Team KZ Jiken Note series is Aya taking her senpai's advice of Write What You Know to heart.
-   In the _Bloody Jack_ series, Jacky's friend Amy writes and publishes a series of books based on Jacky's adventures, with the same titles as the real-life books.
-   Averted in _Resurrection Day_ by Brendan DuBois. The protagonist shows a memoir he wrote about the day WW3 started to a British journalist. She says he ought to publish them, only to be told that no American publisher would touch a book like that.
-   The conclusion to "Mr. Eastwood's Adventure" in _The Listerdale Mystery_ by Agatha Christie. The protagonist turns his day's adventure into a new mystery story, breaking the writers' block that had started the story.
-   _Hitty, Her First Hundred Years_: The doll Hitty writes her memoirs while living in an antique shop in the 1920s, using a quill pen and ink bottle that sit next to her on the table where the owner puts her at night.
-   _Me, Who Dove into the Heart of the World_ ends with 41-year-old Karen writing her autobiography and considering _Me Who Dove_ as a possible title.
-   _The Impossible Us_: Nick writes up his adventure with Bee as _Impossible to Explain: A Fucked-Up Love Story_.

    Live Action TV 

-   The _Game of Thrones_ finale includes a scene where Sam presents Tyrion with Archmaester Ebrose's "A Song of Ice and Fire", spanning the exact run of the series.
-   The last episode of _The Dick Van Dyke Show_ has Rob Petrie writing his autobiography and subsequently being offered the chance to write his own sitcom based on his life as a comedy writer.
-   The Made-for-TV and later released on home video movie _Noah's Ark_ ends with Noah writing down his adventures, and expresses concerns that someday, people will say they weren't even there. Indeed, the movie's story is a mixing of the Biblical stories of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and, of course, the Flood... _in that order_. The character of Noah is sort of a mashup of Noah and Abraham, except that Abraham never lived in Sodom.
-   _Episodes_ ends on this note: Sean and Beverly get a new show, which they start watching in the final scene - enter the Episodes opening sequence.
-   _Kamen Rider_:
    -   Maya, from _Kamen Rider Dragon Knight_ actually does this, selling the story of the Kamen Riders as a children's novel at the end of the series.
    -   _Kamen Rider Build_ ends with the protagonist Sento having written his adventures as Kamen Rider Build into a set of scripts (49 of them, to be precise) and planning on selling it to a production company. It helps that the defeat of the Big Bad left Sento and The Lancer Banjou in a new world where the events of the series never happened, meaning nobody would realize that the story is based on real events.
    -   Touma Kamiyama from _Kamen Rider Saber_ writes a book called "Eternal Story" based on his experiences during the series, beginning from him becoming the eponymous Rider, which is published by the end of the show. Interestingly enough, said book is a sequel, being preceded by the book "Lost Memory", which was based on vague recollections of his past which in turn put him on the path to becoming a Kamen Rider.
-   _Avataro Sentai Donbrothers_, the 46th _Super Sentai_, ends with Haruka, the team's yellow ranger OniSister, creating an award winning manga about the team's adventures.
-   The very last scene of _Arrested Development_ plays with this with Maeby acquiring the rights to the family's story to be developed into a television series. However, she presents the material to Ron Howard who tells her "I don't see it as a series. Maybe a movie."
-   Although not revealed in the series, Word of God is that Steve and Susan from _Coupling_ made a sitcom based on their relationship (which, since they are, in fact, Steven Moffat and Sue Vertue, isn't very surprising).
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   Joan Redfern — the love interest of John Smith, a certain humanized-amnesiac Time-Lord — is revealed to have kept John's diary and her memoirs in an attic. Over ninety-five years later, her great-granddaughter publishes them as a book...only for a man, just like the one from the diary, to come to the book signing.
    -   Lots of fans theorise that the Peter Cushing Dalek movies were written by Ian and Barbara based on their own experiences. This was almost canonised in "Day of the Doctor", but Steven Moffat couldn't budget the rights to show the movie posters, so the subplot was cut.
-   The last episode of _Roseanne_ reveals that Roseanne wrote the series based on her life - except the final season, which she completely made up after Dan died.
-   McGee wrote Deep Six in _NCIS_. It is implied the books were fictional events, although the characters were clearly based upon Gibb's team.
-   This happens frequently in _Californication_, in ways that relate to the ongoing story arcs and with the implication that most of Hank Moody's novels come from this trope. The main example is "Fucking and Punching", a novel that Hank writes during season 1 about his experience with Mia, which Mia subsequently steals and publishes under her own name, creating an ongoing conflict for much of the show.
-   During the end credits of the final episode of _Babylon 5_, it is revealed that the entire series was a documentary featuring the history-changing events that occurred on the station. It showed a huge group photo of the actual production team, and ended with the entire run of the main cast's pictures and actor names. This makes the credits avoid Breaking the Fourth Wall and instead say "this Minbari actually existed in the future and played Delenn".
-   The _Stargate SG-1_ quote above gets (unintentionally?) parodied late in the series, when it turns out an ordinary citizen, who had acquired a psychic connection with O'Neill, attempted to publish the team's mission reports as books for years...unsuccessfully. Also, there's "Wormhole X-Treme," the Self-Parody Show Within a Show that acts as the SG-1 of the SG-1 universe.
-   In the _How I Met Your Mother_ episode "Brunch", where Ted, after hearing his parents' less-than-impressive story of how they met ("I think it was in a bar"), declares that when he's older, he's gonna make sure to tell his kids the _full_ story of how he met their mother. Fast forward twenty-four years to 2030, and he does, although as far as we know he never published it.
    -   There's also the movie with the show, The Wedding Bride, which was written by Tony who ran away with Ted's intended bride, Stella. Since Tony actually got Ted his teaching job out of guilt for the incident, we can surmise the film is highly fictionalized since the character, Jed Mosely is extremely abusive.
-   _Bosom Buddies_: In the opener, Henry is shown typing, and the voiceover says "This experience is gonna make a great book."
-   _Gilmore Girls_: In the 2016 revival _A Year in the Life_, Rory begins work on a book telling the story of her life with her mother. She even titles it _The Gilmore Girls_.
-   The final scene of _Orphan Black_ likewise shows that Helena has written a memoir which has the same title as the show.
-   _The Nanny_: "Frannie's Choice" ends with Fran on an airplane talking to a CBS executive about her life story, saying it'd make a great sitcom. This actually parallels how Fran Drescher first proposed the show.
-   A sketch on _Wayne and Shuster_ retold the events of _Macbeth_ as a Police Procedural. At the end, after Malcolm's coronation, the cops find a suspicious guy watching from the bushes - except it's just an English playwright who is convinced the story would make a great play. The cops warn him It Will Never Catch On.
-   The end of _Jane the Virgin_ shows that Jane's book is actually the plot line of the show and at the end of the book the story is made into a telenovela, aka the show.
-   Toward the end of _One Tree Hill_ Lucas writes a book about the town of Tree Hill and they actually almost make it a TV show in the show, going as far as casting themselves to play the parts.
-   _30 Rock_ ends with Liz Lemon's great-granddaughter pitching a show to an immortal Kenneth, who is still the head of NBC about the stories of 30 Rockerfeller Plaza that Liz had told her.
-   _Shadow and Bone_: At the end of season 2 Jesper thinks that they should hire someone to write a book about their adventures.
    
    **Jesper:** _The Four Charming Rogues of Ketterdam_.  
    **Kaz:** There's five of us.  
    **Jesper:** Five of Ke—
    

     Myth 

-   Some versions of Arthurian Legend introduce us to Blaise, Merlin's former tutor. Merlin visits him often to share recent stories from Arthur's court, thus creating the mythos in the first place.

    Radio 

-   _Our Miss Brooks_: In the episode "Miss Brooks Writes About A Hobo," Miss Brooks seeks out a hobo to write an article entitled "The Vanishing Hobo." At the end of the episode, the hobo relates he had bought a set of new clothes with the money he earned from writing about "The Vanishing Schoolteacher."

    Teletext 

-   The Channel 4 Teletext soap opera _Park Avenue_ ended with one of the characters announcing that he'd successfully sold a soap opera based on the street to ORACLE. Fridge Logic when you consider that _Park Avenue_ was full of topical references, and had started four years earlier...

    Theater 

-   Subverted in _Avenue Q_. Princeton thinks he's finally discovered his purpose in life when he sees a kid fresh out of college just like he once was: put together everything he's learned about struggling through life after college and make a Broadway show out of it. The recent grad flips him off and leaves, and everyone else thinks it's a bad idea too.
-   Adaptations of _Little Women_ occasionally do this; examples are the "Dramatized Classic" feature by Plays Magazine and the musical.
-   Older Than Steam: In _A Midsummer Night's Dream_ Bottom, thinking the fantastic events of the play were All Just a Dream, says that "I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream: it shall be called ‘Bottom’s Dream’, because it hath no bottom;"
-   _Cabaret_ ends with a heartbroken Cliff leaving Berlin on a train and beginning to write a novel about his experience (after failing to write one during the rest of the show).
-   Legacy is an important theme throughout _Hamilton_, and so the finale, "Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story" shows the two surviving Schuyler sisters, Eliza and Angelica, trying to preserve the story and legacy of George Washington, soldiers like Hercules Mulligan and John Laurens, and most importantly, Hamilton himself, after their respective deaths. The song ends with Eliza wondering if she's done enough to tell her husband's story — then the fourth wall drops, and Eliza sees the scores of people who have come out to see Hamilton's story. It's an emotionally charged moment, for sure.
-   The Molière play _Critique Of The School For Wives_ is about a group of acquaintances discussing Molière's controversial play _The School for Wives_. In the end they all agree to let Molière turn their conversation into a play, word for word with no changes at all, since both those who praise _The School for Wives_ and those who criticize it expect that their side of the debate will get the complete agreement of the people who'll go see this new play.
-   In the finale of _The Tale of Tsar Saltan_, Old Grandfather, a storyteller, announces that as soon as he gets home, he'll start turning the opera's events into a story, with some Artistic License involved.

    Video Games 

-   In _Animal Crossing: New Horizons_, if you tell a Cranky villager you're into comedies when he asks you what type of TV shows you're into, he'll mention that he's working on a pilot script for a sitcom about "all these wacky characters on a little island".
-   Sinbat's ending from _Arabian Fight_ have him rescuing the princess and deciding to continue his journeys as a sailor. And years later, he compiles his adventures into a novel series, titled "Arabian Fight" to be passed down generations.
-   _The Game Dev Tree_: The last action needed to complete the game is writing your thesis/Magnum Opus, "The Game Dev Tree".
-   If you stayed on good terms with Martin Summers through _Hotel Dusk: Room 215_, he sends Kyle a letter explaining he's going to write a new novel based off of him. Kyle isn't much of a reader and Summers isn't much of a writer, so his reaction is less than enthusiastic. He apparently decides to go for it later in life, as the novel Summers writes turns out as the In-Game Novel version of _Last Window_.
-   At the end of _Paper Mario 64_, one NPC says that he's written a book about Mario's quest, entitled _Paper Mario_.
    -   You can actually see the book in _Luigi's Mansion_, where the ghost Neville can be observed reading a novel entitled "Mario Story", the Japanese name for _Paper Mario_.
    -   Likewise, _Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door_ has Mario's adventures being turned into a play performed by one of his teammates, Flurrie, and a former enemy, Doopliss. The game also features a collection of books describing Luigi's adventures (with some facts being exaggerated to make Luigi look cooler). After beating the game, Luigi agrees to hire his publisher to make a book about Mario's adventure.
-   Non-RPG _Mario_ example: After helping Mario save both Peach and the entire universe from Bowser in _Super Mario Galaxy_, Rosalina actually decided to write a book based on her experiences with Mario where he had to save both Peach and the universe from Bowser again (her first book was about her childhood and the loss of her family), but this time Bowser is now a giant, and Mario now travels in a small spaceship shaped like his own face with the help of his dinosaur friend Yoshi and a fat purple star named Lubba. The title: _Super Mario Galaxy 2_.
    -   And Rosalina then writes herself into her own story where she finally finds the white Luma she accidentally left behind in the Mushroom Kingdom at the end of the first _Galaxy_ (he was traveling aboard Mario's spaceship), and then she writes a third book (right in front of said white Luma, who listened to her reading _SMG2_) about Mario finding various green stars scattered across the universe, and again she writes herself in to give Mario his last star and boards his ship afterwards.
-   In _Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty_, the plot of the previous game is summarized in a series of in-universe publications accessible from the main menu.
    -   The Stinger for _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_ suggests that Otacon will be doing something like this about Snake's life. Moreover, the stinger is implied to be a Framing Device for the _Metal Gear_ video games, making them Otacon's story about Snake.
-   In some of the endings of _Kana: Little Sister_, Takamihi writes a book based on the diary of his deceased sister.
-   In _The Caligula Effect_, going through Naruko's Character Episode has her decide to write a story about the Go Home Club's adventure of being stuck inside Mobius and wanting to return to the real world. But she changes thing by giving them a standard fantasy-style setting.
-   Done in _Riviera: The Promised Land_, by Rose, of all people.
-   The _Sly Cooper_ games suggest that the missions are entries in the Thievius Raccoonus, the Cooper family journal/diary/manual. At the end of _Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves_, it suggests that Bentley was making the last entry in it.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   In _Pokémon Black 2 and White 2_, Elite Four member Shauntal (already an established author) is in the middle of writing a novel about the events of the previous game; when you come to challenge her, she is brainstorming a passage about a trainer who fits N's description and whatever Legendary Pokemon he owns in the current game (either Reshiram or Zekrom) It should be noted, N defeated the Elite Four, including her, in the first game.
    -   Sonia of _Pokémon Sword and Shield_ wrote a book about the events of the story, which you can read a passage of in _Pokémon Scarlet and Violet_. It also has the added benefit of telling that the Two Heroes of Galar were really legendary Pokemon, not humans as was rewritten by history.
-   At the end of _Leisure Suit Larry 3: Passionate Patti in Pursuit of the Pulsating Pectorals_, Larry and Patti screw over the fabric of their fictional reality, wind up at the set of Sierra studios, and receive a lucrative offer from Roberta Williams to code adventure games about their adventures. Al Lowe had to skip an entire installment in the series to undo this ending.
    -   _Space Quest III_ also ends with the Two Guys from Andromeda ending up at Sierra's studio and they end up making a game, presumably the Space Quest series. No ending-reversal here, though, since the Two Guys aren't the main characters. In fact, Roger rejects the offer and goes back to Xenon. The next game starts with Roger on his way back.
-   _Tales Series_:
    -   In the credits of _Tales of Vesperia_, art is shown of Estelle writing a book; when she closes it, the cover pretty clearly has "Tales of Vesperia" on it, though it's written in the game's made-up runic language. Whether the book _is_ a straight-up adaptation of the game or some kind of children's story about Brave Vesperia's romps and adventures is up for debate.
    -   _Tales of Asteria_: In the game's finale, Orie decides to compile the events of the game into a book as a gift to Tirug, and requests the protagonists of each arc help summarise. She names the book "Tales of Asteria".
-   Was it _Suikoden Tactics_ or _Rhapsodia_? That depends on where you live; either way, there's a reason the game's sections are called "chapters," and Andarc comes off as something of a Badass Bookworm.
-   Mentioned in passing in _Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3_. Following a perilous battle in Cuba, Commander Giles mentions that maybe he will write a book about it.
    -   "How the Allied Nations Saved the Free World From Soviet Zeppelins Carrying Massive Bombs Hidden in Soccer Stadiums Through the Use of Freeze Rays, Teleporters, Invisibility Generators and Wave Motion Cannons"?
-   In the original _Tomb Raider_ games, Lara has written several books which are treated as eccentric fiction, including "A Tyrannosaurus is Jawing at my Head".
-   One of Madison Paige's endings in _Heavy Rain_ has her writing a book entitled...you guessed it.
-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   One of Leliana's possible comments at the end of _Dragon Age: Origins_ is that she might write a book about the game's events...but that she'll leave out details about Fereldan food, which isn't any good even at the palace.
    -   _Dragon Age II_ opens with Varric having _already_ written _The Tale of the Champion_ about Hawke's adventures in Kirkwall. Unfortunately for him, he couldn't resist embellishing things somewhat, so the rest of the game takes place in flashback as Cassandra grills him on what _really_ happened. The fallout from that results in him having a ringside seat for the events of _Dragon Age: Inquisition_; the credits of the _Trespasser_ DLC reveal that he went on to write a book about the Inquisitor titled _All This Shit is Weird_.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   Zigzagged in _Final Fantasy Tactics_. Orlan Durai didn't say that he wanted to write a book about Ramza's brave struggle against Ultima and her cult, neither there's a sequence showing him do so. But the book, the Durai Papers, is written anyway— in fact the entire game is about Alazlam Durai storytelling it to you the player.
    -   The ambiguously-Distant Finale of _Final Fantasy XVI_ features a book chronicling the game's events titled _Final Fantasy_, authored by Joshua Rosfield.
-   In _Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood_, Ezio's fellow Assassin Niccolò Machiavelli mentions he will write a book based on Ezio's exploits. It's heavily implied to be _The Prince_. In the novelization of the game, he actually jots down notes while Ezio is giving a speech to the crowd.
-   Kokoro's ending in _Touhou Shinkirou ~ Hopeless Masquerade_ has her creating a new Noh play called "Shinkirou", based on the events of the game.
-   It was only mentioned All There in the Manual, but, after _Mega Man Zero 4_, Neige (a reporter) has written a biography detailing Zero's adventures.
-   This is Invoked early on in _Always Sometimes Monsters_. In order to secure some help from their publisher, the protagonist agrees to turn over their personal journal to him at the end of the month, regardless of whether or not they succeed in their goal. He figures that he can turn that written account into _something_ profitable.
-   In _The Blackwell Convergence_, Rosa receives a rejection from Rel Day Books for her manuscript "The Devil and the Deacon" — presumably an account of the events in _The Blackwell Legacy_. In _The Blackwell Deception_, Rosa has a published (but wildly unsuccessful) manuscript called "The Actor and the Artist" — presumably an account of the events in _Convergence_.
-   In _The Darkside Detective_, one case requires the protagonist and his sidekick to rummage in the precinct house's evidence locker, which also contains several personal items various detectives have stashed in there for safe-keeping. The sidekick discovers and comments unfavorably on a set of notes for a comedic video game about a pair of police officers who solve spooky mysteries, with the protagonist's embarrassed reaction suggesting that they're his.
-   Actually a major plot point in _Investi-Gator: The Case of the Big Crime_. Roxy the secretary makes "like a billion dollars," according to the narration, writing books about Investi-Gator based directly on the court records she writes for his cases. This actually kickstarts the plot. Salmon Salmon and Red Herring set up a conspiracy to secretly help Investi-Gator because they love his books, and that leads to a whole lot of trouble.
-   _Cry of Fear_ plays this for horror. The events of the game are a book Simon has been writing as a therapeutic exercise on the suggestion of his therapist, who wants him to recover from his depression without the use of medication. It backfires horribly, exacerbating Simon's mental issues to the point that, depending on the ending, he either kills himself while taking his friend Sophie and/or his therapist with him, or he accidentally kills a pair of cops because he suffered a psychotic episode as they came to perform a welfare check on him. Side-modes suggest the book even becomes a low-key Eldritch Abomination that's capable of dragging other people into Simon's nightmare.
-   It's a minor plot point in _Gabriel Knight_ that the eponymous protagonist, a novelist, is trying to write a novel using the ongoing Voodoo Murders as inspiration. After he's been dragged into solving them himself, come the second game he's succeeded with "The Voodoo Murders: A Blake Backlash Mystery".
-   _Tales of the Black Forest_: In The Stinger, Kashin goes to check out a book at the library and learns that Yuki made the events of the game into a book with an almost-identical name ("Strange Tales of the Black Forest").

    Visual Novels 

-   At the end of Himatsubushi-hen in _Higurashi: When They Cry_, Ooishi and Akasaka write a book about what they know about the 5-year chain of mysterious deaths in Hinamizawa and the Great Hinamizawa Gas Disaster. Although it isn't the end of the series - the answers are provided in the next four arcs - it is the end of the question arcs, the arcs that lay out the mysteries that the reader is supposed to solve.

    Web Animation 

-   One of the alternate Season 5 endings to _Red vs. Blue_ has Caboose selling his life story to a company in Redmond, Washington who made a popular video game series out of it.

    Webcomics 

-   _Girl Genius_ is written by Phil Foglio and his wife Kaja, also known in-story as Professors Foglio and Foglio of Transylvania Polygnostic University, who wrote the comic as textbooks for their "True Events in the Life of Agatha Heterodyne 101" class. They subsequently came to our world and published them here, to escape notice by the people they were writing about. So far in-story, Kaja has been seen as an announcer at the Vienna Opera, and Phil is an itinerant storyteller and the great-great-grandson of the Jager Oggie.
    -   The illustrated versions of the Girl Genius radio plays also feature the Foglios, performing the radio plays and then having to escape after being tracked down by Agatha.
    -   The idea of writing down the various adventures of the characters is referenced (and title-dropped) by Bangladesh DuPree.
        
        **Bang:** I mean, if they ever write this down, they ain't gonna be calling it "_Boy_ Genius".
