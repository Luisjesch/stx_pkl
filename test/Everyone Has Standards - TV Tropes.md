**Arya:** You're fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you?  
**The Hound:** A man's got to have a code.

Whether someone is a weirdo, villain, pervert, jerkass, geek, or just _way_ too nice, deviant from the customs of "normal" society — one often finds that those things can only go so far. These characters find that when they're in a situation where they would cross a certain line, they don't do it. Or they get disgusted at those who _do_ cross that line.

The standard is often moral or ethical, but could also be regarding culture, or True Art, or good taste, or good manners, or what constitutes a good meal, or even the boundaries around a fandom — basically, anything that a person or group is willing to treat as Serious Business. The point of this trope is that no matter how high or low anyone thinks the line is, they all believe that there _is_ a line, and that those who cross it are in the wrong. Even people you wouldn't think of as having standards still tend to believe in _something._

Compare Conscience Makes You Go Back, Sudden Principled Stand. See What the Hell, Hero? when someone calls out a person's actions for violating their own standards. If someone judges other people's actions but assumes their own must be good by definition, they have Moral Myopia. If someone's standards are applied inconsistently, it's a Double Standard. Conversely, someone's standards may be consistent but at odds with genuine morality, leading to Curious Qualms of Conscience. See also Shades of Conflict for the many variations that may occur when people with different levels of standards collide.

Someone who doesn't observe any standards may cross the Moral Event Horizon and become a Complete Monster.

This is Truth in Television, of course; just about all people do try to follow some sort of standard, and even outright sociopaths can tell (at least intellectually) the difference between right and wrong. Though standards may differ from time and place and individual, and people may fail to live up to their own standards, for someone to not have _any_ ethical or moral standards is usually the sign of an extremely dangerous and unpredictable individual. That said, No Real Life Examples, Please!

    Comic Strips 

-   Lampooned in _Bloom County_, where it was combined with an Evil Lawyer Joke and a dose of Self-Deprecation on the part of the writer. The strip's resident Amoral Attorney, Steve Dallas, was thinking about changing careers, because he wanted "an easier way to make a living than getting psychopaths and rapists off the hook". (Not that he cared about who they hurt; he just wasn't all-that _good_ at it.) Then Opus suggested that Steve try getting into cartoonist art, to which Steve replied by jabbing him in the butt with a pen and angrily shouting, "I have _some_ scruples, dude!"
-   Calvin of _Calvin and Hobbes_ may be quite self-centered, but even he thinks starving people are nothing to joke about. He's also periodically disgusted by people who litter.
-   In _Dilbert_, even a pirate with a diseased parrot refuses to be spokesperson for the unethical company Dilbert works at.
-   _Garfield_:
-   Wimpy from _Popeye_ is a mooch, cowardly, selfish, and has betrayed Popeye on numerous occasions, however, he refuses to kill under any circumstances. He was also once greatly angered when he heard that someone was poaching goons.

    Film — Animation 

-   In _All Dogs Go to Heaven_, before Charlie starts actually caring for Anne Marie, he's indignant when she tells him that he's not that much different from Carface. He even asks if he did what Charlie did for her like telling her a story or tucking her in bed or kissing her goodnight. Earlier in the movie, the dogs at the casino even say that Charlie treats them better than Carface does.
-   _Animal Farm (1954)_: When Napoleon sentences some animals to death for supposedly siding with Snowball, Moses the raven (who had before calmly watched Napoleon's dogs tear up Snowball) turns his back on the dogs mauling the hens and sheep and goose, horrified at this cruelty.
-   In _Balto_, Nikki and Kaltag are eager to see Balto and Steele fight for the medicine. In spite of them helping Steele bully Balto earlier, their amusement turns to genuine concern as Steele uses very dirty moves to get the upper hand, resulting in Balto getting a nasty bite wound. They then become very shocked when Steele carelessly knocks the medicine sled down. After the fight, they and Star decide to abandon Steele and follow Balto.
-   _A Bug's Life_: Flik and Atta have to cover their eyes in horror before Hopper gets eaten by the bird's chicks.
-   _Coco_
    -   Miguel's father, Enrique, takes his mother Elena's side when it comes to enforcing the family's ban on music, but he is horrified when Elena smashes her grandson's homemade guitar that Miguel treasured.
    -   Imelda may be unwilling to immediately forgive Héctor for supposedly walking out on his family even after the truth is known but she gets shocked upon seeing her husband about to fade away, showing that even she thinks that Héctor doesn't deserve such a fate. Indeed, it is the threat of him being erased, not the revelation that he wanted to return before being killed, that convinces her to help him live by retrieving the photo that Ernesto has confiscated.
-   In _Felidae_, Francis says this when Bluebeard comes to his house for the first time.
    
    **Francis:** Did you come back here to take a leak? Forget it. You don't piss in here anymore. I live here now, and I have my standards.
    
-   Most of the population of Paris were quick to bully and attempt to flog Quasimodo in Disney's _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_, but even they were horrified when Judge Frollo ordered Esmeralda to be burned at stake.
    -   Earlier, when Frollo's philosophy begins to extend to anyone who even _might_ have the suspicion of harboring gypsies, the citizens begin to become fearful. When the judge burns down a poor miller's home while his children are inside just because the family has offered lodging to gypsies before, they outright turn on him and say "Frollo's gone _mad_!"
-   _The Incredibles_:
    -   Edna Mode is a bit of a Nightmare Fetishist, what with her having an underground armory designed to test super suits for durability, and she watches the demonstrations with glee when entertaining Helen. But what is one line she will not cross? As she puts it, "No capes!" When Bob tries to argue with her about this after he "convinces" her to make a suit for him, Edna cites a Long List of supers that died due to a Cape Snag (which is confirmed in the DVD extras for most of them), and she makes it clear that she will not have his potential death on her hands due to that. Bob did call her the best for a reason, after all.
    -   Violet gets offended when Helen assumes that she and Dash left Jack-Jack all alone in the house to stow away in the plane. As she puts it sarcastically, only a complete idiot would do such a thing. No, she got the best babysitter she could find at a late notice who had a good reputation for handling infants. Well, Violet ended up being right on that count of her friend Kari stimulating a baby's mind.
    -   After Syndrome vows to get Bob's family one day (and having already proved he _means_ to meet that claim earlier), a furious Bob has enough and throws a nearby car right at his getaway aircraft. He makes a Sympathetic Wince, however, when it results in Syndrome getting Cape Snagged into one of its propellers (as a nod to the aforementioned Brick Joke) and detonating the craft. Even for a monster like him, that's a brutal way to go.
-   In _Monsters, Inc._, bringing objects from the human world into the monster world, even by accident, is a serious crime. Kidnapping children and planning on doing them harm? A bigger crime that the Child Detection Agency's willing to overlook the other one over.
-   In _The Nightmare Before Christmas_, Jack Skellington quite literally lives to scare people (though he's a generally nice guy despite his spooky talents); his whole job as the Pumpkin King is to ensure that the spirit of All Hallows' Eve is kept scary. But he absolutely _refuses_ to work with the villainous Oogie Boogie; the other denizens may be monsters, but Oogie is genuinely evil. When Jack hires the Enfante Terrible trio of Lock, Shock, and Barrel to "kidnap the Santy Claws," he loses his cheerful demeanor for the first time and gives them a strict instruction:
    
    **Jack**: And one more thing...leave that no-account _Oogie Boogie_ _**OUT OF THIS!**_
    
-   Despite his love for penguins, even Corporal from _Penguins of Madagascar_ is a little miffed that Skipper, Kowalski, and Rico destroyed the North Wind's airship.
-   _Ratatouille_: Talon, Skinner's lawyer, knows full well of and seems to support Skinner's frozen foods sold in Gusteau's name. He also advises him to wait for the deadline of the will to pass and then fire Linguini. But even he seems to be unnerved of his client's conspiracy rant, especially when he keeps talking about the rat. He seems to think Skinner was starting to go insane, wondering out loud if he should be concerned about him.
-   In _The Road to El Dorado_, all those witnessing are horrified when Tzekel-Kan reveals that his "proper tribute" to the Gods is a Human Sacrifice, especially Chief Tannabok, Miguel and Tulio. The latter two use their God Guise to quickly put a stop to it before any blood is shed.
    
    **Tulio:** (_quietly_) I don't like this…  
    **Miguel:** (_quietly and urgently_) Tulio, we've got to do something!
    
-   _Rumble_: For as much as Steve wants to distance himself from his father, Rayburn, even he thinks that Tentacular wanting to destroy the stadium that Winnie's dad, Jimbo Coyle, and Rayburn built together purely to get out of Rayburn's shadow is crazy.
-   Snakebite Scruggs from _Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island_. For how much of a grumpy, tourist-hating curmudgeon he is, Scruggs is still above letting a dumb tourist (and his dumb dog) get eaten by alligators on his watch.
-   In _The Sponge Bob Movie Sponge Out Of Water_, Squidasaurus is appalled that the Bikini Bottomites try to sacrifice Spongebob.
    
    **Squidasaurus:** And I thought _my_ friends were primitive.
    
-   _The Super Mario Bros. Movie_: The Bros.'s two uncles spend the family dinner scene making fun of the poorly-made commercial they made for their recently-established plumbing business, as well as using coordinated outfits and white work gloves as their trademark. Then the Bros.'s father tells Mario he's nuts for leaving a “steady job” (the job in question had been toxic due to a Bad Boss) for his “crazy dream” and is dragging Luigi down with him in the process, making Mario insulted enough to storm off from the table. The uncles proceed to give the father Disapproving Looks along with the rest of the family, showing that even _they_ knew he went too far with his insensitive comments.
-   _Trolls World Tour_: When he sees the effects of the ultimate power chord on the troll monarchs, Riff is taken aback and concedes to Poppy's point that everyone being the same isn't a good thing.
-   In _Turning Red_, Tyler has been mocking Mei for how creepy and stalker-ish her mother is. In the climax, when Ming attacks the concert, he joins Mei's friends in assisting with restoring Ming back to normal and saving 4\*Town when they are dangling from their stage harnesses. He is a jerk at first, but he wouldn't want someone hurt for real.
-   _Wreck-It Ralph_: Ralph definitely did not like Vanellope at all in the first act of the film since she stole his _Hero's Duty_ medal. However, when he witnesses the other racers bullying Vanellope, not only is he absolutely disgusted by it, but he chases them off when they shove her into a mud puddle. Keep in mind that this was before Ralph even had a reason to like her.

    Music 

-   In The Lonely Island's "Like a Boss", Andy Samberg's character (the "boss") says it in the moment, but as the song winds up and the man giving him a performance review double-checks that in an average day, "You chop your own balls off and _die,_" he agrees to those two things, but tries to go back on having said "something about suckin' your own dick". That ain't him.
-   Played for Laughs in Jonathan Coulton's song "Re: Your Brains," about a sentient zombie trying to convince some human survivors to give themselves up:
    
    _All we wanna do is eat your brains!  
    We're not unreasonable; I mean, no one's gonna eat your eyes._
    
-   Record label Nuclear Blast is no stranger to publishing blatantly antireligious songs, and had already published some spicy ones by Norwegian black metal band Dimmu Borgir. But the company drew the line with their song "Tormentor of Christian Souls", which was apparently so bad the label refused to put the lyrics for the song in the booklet. They still published the song itself, they just refused to tell anyone what it was really saying.
-   In the "Once Upon a Time in Space" concept album, Jonny D'Ville— a murderous space pirate who loves violence— refuses to kiss the Sleeping Beauty analogue because kissing a sleeping stranger is creepy.
-   In a Songify This of Charlie Sheen's Winning interview, Charlie is giving a list to sort on what is winning or not. Violating the rules of the Geneva Convention is the only thing considered weak.

    Podcasts 

-   _The Adventure Zone: Balance_: Taako is generally the party klepto, as well as the undisputed king of Refuge in Audacity. However, he balks when Magnus tries to steal money from a bank. Not for any moral reasons, but because of the myriad of reasons they'd almost certainly get caught. For one thing, the bank has loads of security measures. For another, they're literally there to _stop a bank robbery_. For _another_, they're working with the chief of police, who not only knows they're there, but is the one who let them in and is currently _right outside_.
    
    **Taako:** This isn't a dungeon, people do _business_ here! Put that back! _\[later\]_ You two can split it fifty-fifty if you want, I swear to _God_, first thing I do when we get outside is I rat you out. I’m writing it on my goddamn character sheet, so I never forget to rat you two out.
    
-   In Episode 2 of _Mystery Show_, Starlee tries to find Britney Spears by going to a mall and a restaurant where she had been had been photographed by paparazzi. After having no luck, she becomes very uncomfortable with her methods and decides to try a different way.
    
    -   In Episode 5, which revolves around Starlee trying to find out how tall Jake Gyllenhaal is:
    
    **David:** So many ways of finding out the objective truth of this information would have been unethical. You can't go to his doctor and find out. That's not the type of people we are. Unless that's what you did, in which case, that is the type of people we are.
    
-   _Wooden Overcoats_: Rudyard utterly _loathes_ Eric Chapman, his business rival, and spends most of the series attempting to destroy him and/or run him out of town. When he meets Jerry in "Rudyard Makes a Friend," he's delighted that Jerry hates Chapman, too, and they bond plenty over that. But when he finds out Jerry intends to _kill_ Chapman, Rudyard immediately points out that this is too far. In one of his most selfless acts, Rudyard makes every effort to thwart the plot, eventually outright standing between Jerry and Chapman, and pulling a Go Through Me.
    
    **Eric:** _\[touched\]_ Rudyard...  
    **Rudyard:** It's the principal of the thing. Nothing personal.
    

    Professional Wrestling 

-   _Really_ bad storylines tend to get this reaction.
    -   Case in point: Katie Vick. The brain child of the Executive VP of Television Production, Kevin Dunn, it was a terrible angle involving necrophilia, a doll dressed up as a cheerleader, and Triple H in a Kane mask. Hunter has gone on to say that it was the _only_ time he ever questioned Vince McMahon about a storyline. After negative fan reaction, the feud between Kane and Hunter immediately ended, the entire angle was moved to Canon Discontinuity, and the only time it's ever brought up is usually to reference how _terrible_ it was.
    -   Vince Russo had a pet gimmick called "Beaver Cleavage", a hyper-sexualized version of _Leave It to Beaver_. He had fought tooth and nail with the rest of creative to get it on the air — after the (expected) negative fan reaction, Vince McMahon himself pulled the plug, which is what would ultimately cause Russo to jump ship to WCW.
    -   Though even _Russo_ has standards. Vinny Ru _hated_ the TNA "Immortal" storyline, which basically amounted to nWo: Take 2. As if to indicate how bad the storyline was, it involved Jeff Hardy turning heel and Ric Flair and Hogan ignoring their decades-long feud. He knew the storyline was going to bomb, and the only reason he kept writing it was because Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff kept pressuring him to do so. All it did was prove that Hogan was still a massive Attention Whore.
    -   TNA was also responsible for Claire Lynch, its answer to Katie Vick, which had wrestling's first ever pregnant crack whore. It was by far and away the _nadir_ of AJ Styles's career, and everyone has gone on to say that the only good thing to come out of it was the formation of Bad Influence. The sad part was that this storyline was _after_ Vince Russo's departure from the company.
-   Despite being a neutral party whose only involvement was being in the match, Leah Vaughan prevented her mentor Cherry Bomb from staking Courtney Rush through the heart, presumably because she didn't want to just step back and watch while outright murder was committed in front of her.
-   Following _that_ Hell in a Cell match featuring Mick Foley and The Undertaker, Vince McMahon personally spoke to Mick after the match and told him this: "Mick, you have no idea how much I appreciate what you just did, _**but I never want to see that again.**_"
    -   According to Mick's first book, the idea to start on top of the Cell and get thrown off originated as a joke, and when Mick took the idea seriously, **Terry Funk** thought he was crazy.
-   In 2004, WWE writer Dan Madigan (who was one of the people behind Katie Vick) suggested that Jon Heidenreich’s gimmick be an unfrozen Nazi managed by Paul Heyman, who is Jewish...and whose mother survived the Holocaust. When the idea was pitched, Vince McMahon himself walked out of the board room and didn’t come back for the rest of the day. Suffice to say, Madigan’s career didn’t last much longer and he was fired in early 2005.
-   Jim Ross has gone on record stating that Brock Lesnar, even with his Real Life abrasive attitude towards other superstars and his mercenary attitude towards WWE, actually _didn't_ want to break The Streak, but was ordered to do so by Vince and had gained the approval of Undertaker himself.
-   **Eddiesploitation**. According to Konnan, _no one_ wanted to do it. Not Triple H, not Stephanie McMahon, not Rey Mysterio Jr., _definitely_ not Chris Benoit and almost certainly not Chavo Guerrero Jr. or the still-grieving Vickie Guerrero. No one — except for the boss himself, Vince McMahon, which means everyone had to go through with it anyway. Match after match, promo after promo, feud after feud, all centered around Eddie and his death. At one point, Randy Orton was forced to say Eddie was "in hell" to Rey's face as part of their feud on the Road to _WrestleMania_, and yeah, Orton hated doing that, because just like everyone else, he loved Eddie. All of this only ended when Benoit finally put his foot down and called Vince out, after Vince tried to set up a feud between Benoit and Chavo over Eddie's "estate". As a coda to this tragedy, when RD Reynolds wrote out its entry for the WrestleCrap Gooker Award (which it unsurprisingly won), he didn't include any soundbites or images — it was so loathsome he couldn't bring himself to go through it again, article or none.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Anathema_: Players are required to murder as many people as possible, but even the most bloodthirsty shrouds have a group of people that they're strongly adverse to killing. The penalty if you do kill a member of that group? You lose some of your will to live.
-   In _BattleTech_, during the opening years of the First Succession War, Jinjiro Kurita ordered the slaughter of the entire population of a planet, Nanking-Massacre-style. While the DCMS obeyed (refusal to undertake the orders was an executable offense), they had to, outside of the most fanatically loyal units, be forced and bullied into doing it. The fluff recounts numerous suicides of DCMS troops who could not live with themselves over what they were made to do.
    -   Since the Succession Wars, any weapons of mass destruction, be they nuclear, biological, or chemical, are considered too horrific to use. Consequently, using one is one of the best ways available to get everyone to stop shooting at each other and start shooting at _you_. Witness the stomping given to the Word of Blake by most everybody else, _including the clans_, as an example.
-   Vivien Reid in _Magic: The Gathering_ is an ecoterrorist who thinks civilisation is a blight on the multiverse, and during her visit to Ikoria, she has nothing positive to say about the city of Drannith, which has a strongly authoritarian philosophy and kills monsters by the dozen. However, when Lucca — who had been her protege earlier in the story — forms an army of monsters by controlling them with the Ozolith and attempts to conquer Drannith with them, Vivien concludes this is an unnatural and cruel corruption of the _eludha_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and leads the army of bonders she's gathered _against_ Lucca in order to _save_ Drannith.
-   In the _Ravenloft_ sourcebook series known as the "Ravenloft Gazeteers", it is mentioned in the first volume that the peasantry of Barovia, the most Uberwaldian of the Uberwaldy domains in the Core, a backwards realm of benighted, impoverished peasants whom the in-universe author has been jeering at, look down on the denizens of neighboring Nova Vaasa, which they regard as hopelessly corrupt, squalid and oppressed. This sentiment is reiterated in the opening fiction of the fifth volume, where the narrator notes she asked the owner of a tavern on the Barovian side of the border why he built his establishment here, in the dark and sinister foothills, rather than on Nova Vaasa's sunny plains. The reply she gets is that whilst there is much evil in Barovia, at least Barovia's evil restricts itself to the night.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_: The Imperium is a deeply religious institution, at times verging on theocratic and at others diving right in. The Imperial Faith is a warlike and xenophobic creed, preaching the fiery destruction of the alien, the mutant and the heretic. Entire worlds are devoted to the Emperor's worship; armies are raised in the name of the God-Emperor of Mankind; the head of the Adeptus Ministorum is one of the most powerful people in the Imperium. And _even within that context_, the apocalyptic fanatics of the Redemptionist creed are widely considered to be sketchy and overzealous at best, outright unhinged at worst, to the point where Imperial authorities often feel the need to either suppress Redemptionists (they're considered a proscribed cult on the planet of Necromunda, for example) or at least find ways to direct them away from burning innocent people for not being fanatical enough.

-   _Les Misérables_, the revolutionaries refuse to let Gavroche put himself in the line of fire, because he's the youngest of all of them. He has to sneak past them to get the shells they need, ignoring their protests.
-   _Miss Saigon_: For all the Engineer's unscrupulous greed, he never even considers the idea of running off with little half-American Tam, to lie his way into the visa he so desperately wants, without taking Tam's mother with him. Right from the start of his plan, he says "they must let _us_ in".
-   In _Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_, Sweeney goes Jumping Off the Slippery Slope at the end of Act One and develops a kill-them-all philosophy, saying that he'll slaughter the upper classes for their exploitation of the poor and the lower classes to put them out of their misery. We see that philosophy in action in "Johanna Quartet," where he kills random patrons of his barber shop without a second thought. However, when a man comes in with his young daughter, Sweeney lets him live—he can't bring himself to kill a father (especially because he desperately misses Johanna, his own child).
