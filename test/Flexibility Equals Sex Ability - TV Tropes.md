**Barney:** There are currently no positions available.  
**Nora:** I'm a yoga instructor. _Every_ position is available.

That character must be a gymnast, or a ballet dancer, or maybe a cheerleader, or even a Yoga teacher. Look at how they bend and flex. They must be incredible in bed, right?

Being flexible is frequently a factor in attractiveness, and is often taken to strongly imply that somebody has extremely good sexual skills. It may even be used as a family-friendly way of indicating the latter.

While this is commonly a trope about women, it can also be applied to men. While the flexibility may be part of the character's profession, it may just be that they work out and keep themselves limber.

Related to All Guys Want Cheerleaders, as their flexibility may be one element of their attractiveness, but this is not the only reason why guys may want cheerleaders. Related to Inherently Attractive Profession, where gymnasts (or other professions involving flexibility) may be considered attractive due to that flexibility, but this trope applies to any flexible character regardless of profession.

Differs from Power Perversion Potential in that this can be just about normal human flexibility, although the tropes can overlap in the case of the Rubber Man. While a Contortionist may end up with this trope as well, this trope is specifically about attractiveness and implied sexual ability instead of the flexibility itself.
