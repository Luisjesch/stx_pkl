A trope so pervasive, not even other species are safe.

**Tommy:** How was it? I heard there was an awesome shower scene.  
**Harry:** Oh, yeah! But then this naked girl got in and you could barely see the shower.

Exactly What It Says on the Tin: A character (usually someone designated a Mr. or Ms. Fanservice — either in-universe or according to the fandom — but an Innocent Fanservice Girl \[or Guy\] can be susceptible) takes a shower.

More often the person is female, but can also be done with men.

This can also involve more than just one person, but they are usually all within the same gender.

Also known as the Obligatory Shower Scene. A Decontamination Chamber can be used as a variation of this in science fiction works.

One of the most common forms of Fanservice, this will usually involve frosted glass, Censor Steam, Censor Suds, a Toplessness from the Back shot and a Modesty Towel before and afterwards to appease the censors, if necessary.

If a waterfall is used in place of a shower for whatever reason (a character is out in the woods or the story takes place before indoor plumbing was common), then it's a Waterfall Shower.

Subtropes include:

-   "Psycho" Shower Murder Parody (Exactly What It Says on the Tin)
-   Shower of Angst (when a character showers as a symbolic way to wash away shame, misery, or embarrassment; sometimes clothed, sometimes not, depending on how bad the character's psyche has suffered and whether or not the scene is Played for Laughs or Played for Drama)
-   Shower of Awkward (a Comedy Trope in which one character walks in on another showering. Usually used in conjunction with unresolved or belligerent sexual tension if the characters are in love with each other but won't admit to it or Nausea Fuel and Brain Bleach if the character showering is not considered sexually attractive and the mere sight of him or her naked is enough to induce vomiting, psychological trauma, hysterical blindness, or a complete change in sexual preference \[including no sex ever again\])
-   Shower of Love (when two people make love while in the shower).
-   Bath of Poverty (when a character is shown to live on a run-down setting)

    Advertising 

-   Frequently used as a Ms. Fanservice gambit by manufacturers of bath and shower fittings, both in print and in television commercials, but in more recent years this is becoming a dead trope. In the period 1950-80 it was very common to sell bathroom fittings by having a naked female model in the bath or shower to appeal to the men who had the decision-making power about installing them. The whole gamut of Censor Steam, Censor Suds, Toplessness from the Back and Modesty Towel were deployed to meet the screening criteria of each decade. As women got more buying power and independence, more of the foam-covered models in the showers became male, for the same reason. With the turn of the century, this has fallen out of favour, with shower manufacturers content to let the unadorned product speak for itself. However, adverts for related sundries, such as shower-gels, soaps, shampoos, etc, still generally manage to put a naked body in the shower using them.
-   A soft drink commercial from the late 90s featured an especially gratuitous one of these that didn't involve an actual shower: a sexy woman in a costume clearly intended to evoke Lara Croft (boots, hot pants and a tight t-shirt) is driving through a desert in a jeep, looking hot and thirsty. Then she spots a water tower. She get out of the car and takes a shotgun from the trunk, then strips completely naked (with much use of Sideboob, Toplessness from the Back and raised thigh to conceal the bits of the actress that couldn't be shown in a commercial), fires the shotgun at the water tower, and luxuriates in the resulting cascade of water, which is duly compared to the refreshing sensation of a cool can of whatever drink the commercial was advertising.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Very early on in _Bakemonogatari_, we get one with Senjougahara behind the shower screen. Whether watchers still remember it by the end of the toothbrush scene is speculation.
-   _Black Cat_:
    -   To celebrate the tenth issue, we're treated to Rinslet taking a shower.
    -   In the anime, Train also gets his shower scene<small>◊</small> in episode 14.
-   In _Bleach_, there's a shower scene of Mayuri Kurotsuchi, of all people. However, this scene shows us that under all that makeup/war paint, he's actually quite attractive.
-   The animated _Captain Harlock_ movie features Kei, though her case may be justified because otherwise she is sticking in a very smelly-looking armoured spacesuit.
-   This happens quite often in _Code Geass_. There's the scene where Kallen confronts Lelouch who came to the bathroom to bring her a change of clothes while she was showering, and quite a lot of her is seen. There's the scene where Lelouch is angry about things that were indirectly caused by him while in the bathtub, and last but not least there's the scene where Suzaku finds Kallen showering in a waterfall after awakening on an empty island.
-   In _Death Note_, Halle Lidner has just had Mello, a wanted criminal, turn up on her doorstep and hold her at gunpoint. She then proceeds shush him, tells her boss and Mello's rival that she's going to take the wire off so she can take a shower, and showers right in front of Mello so they can talk privately, and Near doesn't immediately realize that she's passing info about the investigation to Mello. The scene is basically the entire foundation for the Mello/Lidner pairing- something that is helped by the downright alluring glances Halle keeps sending his way, even joking that, since Near wants her to put cameras up to catch him, he can just stay in her bathroom from now on. (Although, for his part, Mello ignores the fanservice.)
-   As a running gag in _Doraemon_, poor Shizuka never gets to finish a bath or shower, and takes them all the time. Literally so, as she's tried in other time periods, just to be interrupted by Nobita, Doraemon, Gian and Suneo.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   Bulma while camping in the desert in Oolong's double-decker camper. Yamcha accidentally saw her showering while trying to invade their camp.
    -   Vegeta has a scene at the start of the Cell saga, partly to showcase his many and varied scars, and partly to highlight the Unresolved Sexual Tension between Vegeta and Bulma.
-   _Durarara!!_:
    -   We get one of Celty early on. Shinra pokes his head in to "check on her".
    -   Shinra attempts the same thing in the second arc, but this time it's his dad in the shower. Oops.
    -   Shinra himself got a brief one in episode 6. It wasn't as detailed though, much to the fangirls' disappointment.
-   Matsuya gets one in the last episode of _Excel♡Saga_... that Kabapu spies on.
-   _Fairy Tail_:
    -   Erza Scarlet has a Shower of Angst after retreating from the battle with Phantom Lord.
    -   Lucy has one just before the beginning of her Bathtub Bonding Scene with Cana.
    -   Lucy has a Shower of Angst after losing her fight against Flare Corona in the Grand Magic Games. Somehow it feels worse since Lucy lost due to Flare's team cheating.
-   _Fire Candy_ doesn't bother to censor, well, anything in Yukito's shower scene.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_:
    -   Happens to Edward not long after he escapes from Gluttony's stomach, where he spent a fair amount of time ankle-deep in blood.
    -   We also see Riza Hawkeye in the shower, along with a plot-relevant Toplessness from the Back shot.
-   _Fushigi Yuugi_ puts Miaka in one of these (among other bathing scenes in the series), where the camera pans _sloooooooowly_ from her butt up.
-   Parodied in the _Giant Robo_ "side stories" when we get a classic anime shower scene, camera panning up a shapely pair of legs and buttocks... only for the old, bearded and male bad guy Shocking Alberto to turn to the camera and ask the audience if they were expecting someone else. Nice ass.
-   Used for comedy in _Hetalia: Axis Powers_, as Ludwig/Germany's first love declaration to Feliciano/North Italy happens when the latter bursts into the first taking a shower and demands to have him say "I love you".
-   Played straight in the anime series _Initial D_, both Extra Stage 1 and 2 involve Mako in a shower scene.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   _Stardust Crusaders_: Anne takes a shower in Forever's Stand-formed ship, Strength. Forever, a Maniac Monkey, lusts for Anne and corners her in the middle of her shower soon after brutally killing all the Speedwagon Foundation sailors, with obvious perverted intentions. Thankfully, she is saved by Jotaro.
    -   _Diamond is Unbreakable_: Yoshikage Kira, as Kosaku, gets a Shower Scene when he walks in on Hayato and corners him knowing that Hayato is aware of his true identity and tries to kill him on the spot.
-   In chapter 12 of the _K_ manga _Memory of Red_, Mikoto decides to take a shower. However, during it he spots Anna trying to innocently film this with Tatara's camera. He throws her out of the bathroom then slams the door shut.
-   Fujiko Mine from _Lupin III_, especially in the movies. For a good example, the first time she's seen in _The Mystery of Mamo_, she's taking a shower... and absolutely averting Barbie Doll Anatomy.
-   The first movie of _Macross Frontier_ had three shower scenes — Alto, Sheryl and Grace. Alto had a scene where it was even angled from above, much to the joy of fangirls everywhere; and Grace displayed everything in full view of the viewers. The series itself even has a few, featuring characters like Sheryl, Nanase, Ranka, and even the micronized Klan.
-   _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_ has one involving nearly all the trainees, minus Erio, who has to wait for his turn outside. An earlier one takes place in Subaru and Teana's time with the academy, in which Subaru talks with Teana about her admiration for Nanoha, and Teana tells her somewhat coldly that she has no interest in becoming friends with her (she later changes her mind).
-   _Mazinger Z_: Several examples:
    -   During a manga story arc in which Kouji and the other main characters try to sneak into Baron Ashura's submarine base, Ashura decides to have a shower. Since Baron Ashura is a bilaterally\-hermaphroditic being, it's played for Fan Disservice. This scene is later animated in _Mazinkaiser_.
    -   In the beginning of the _Mazinger-Z vs Great General of Darkness_ movie, Sayaka was taking a shower when Kouji walked in on her accidentally. She slapped him right away.
-   In _The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi-chan_, there is a brief Shower Scene à la Yuki Nagato, notable for its departure from the series' usual Super-Deformed character design in favor of a more realist rendering.
-   Machiko frequently shower naked in _Miss Machiko_ that it is even featured in the opening credits... Barbie Doll Anatomy averted completely. And sometimes even the kids join in on these. Also: kid's show.
-   _Mobile Suit Gundam_:
    -   Near the beginning of the series Char got a shower scene. In _Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin_, that scene was a lot longer and left a lot less to the imagination.
    -   Fraw Bow and the kiddies get a scene where she tries to keep the kids from horsing around in the shower. Fraw's nipples are in plain view.
-   Tieria Erde's shower scene in _Mobile Suit Gundam 00_ is a very rare and completely humourless male example of this trope, random as it may have been.
-   In the Remastered _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_ episode where Cagalli washed off at the Waltfeld residence her bath scene was upgraded to a shower scene. She has a shot of Side Boob and her butt showing here.
-   The manga adaptation of _Qualia the Purple_ gives Hatou a two panel long shower scene. More contemplative thoughts are shown than any sort of fanservice.
-   A terrifying subversion occurs in _Naruto_: a shower scene featuring Orochimaru and his decaying arms. Considering that he's the main villain of the series at that point, and his generally high levels of creepy, it's really creepy. Added to the mix is the fact that Kabuto was apparently in the room the whole time.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_:
    -   One of these happens early on. Negi tries to help Asuna by enchanting her brushes.
    -   Later on, more hilarity ensues when Asuna and Makie are getting Negi cleaned up in a girl's locker room, and have to hide him when Class Representative Ayaka, fellow student Natsumi and Hot Teacher Shizuna enter (Makie shouldn't have tempted fate with her loud thinking).
-   Nami's had a few in _One Piece_. Including one with a groping and _licking_ by an invisible lion man. She even develops a technique for it over the time skip.
-   _Dear Brother_: In the first episode, Nanako is shown having a shower after her first day in Seiran school.
    -   Rei "Hana-no-Saint-Juste" Asaka has more than one shower too, but hers go more into Shower of Angst.
-   Due to the nature of the curses, these are a dime a dozen in _Ranma ½_: cold showers for turning into the cursed form, hot baths for changing back.
-   The three shows that were mashed together into _Robotech_ had their fair share of these:
    -   Jeanne Fránçaix of _Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross_ (Dana Sterling in _Robotech_) has a lot of gratuitous shower/bath scenes, most of which were cut from the original broadcast of _Robotech_.
    -   Yellow Belmont of _Genesis Climber MOSPEADA_ (Lancer in _Robotech_) also gets one, which demonstrates that he's a guy, but is as gratuitous as most female shower scenes.
    -   Lynn Minmay of _Super Dimension Fortress Macross_ has one as well, which is shown a second time during a clip show, and is exaggerated in _Macross: Do You Remember Love?_ by being more elaborately animated and showing more skin.

-   Andromeda Shun from _Saint Seiya_ has a random one in the anime, while the bad guy Lizard Misty gets a similarly-framed "bathing in the ocean" scene. And Pisces Aphrodite takes a bath in one of the movies. Amusingly, these three are the most likely to be confused for women even in-universe, so maybe that's why the anime worked it in.
-   Sha Gojyo of _Saiyuki_ gets two shower scenes - one in the series, one in the movie (Requiem).
-   Joe gets one in the _Science Ninja Team Gatchaman_ OAV series. If you thought the original series' Joe was Mr. Fanservice...
-   One brief part of an episode of _Squid Girl_ has Sanae showering in a special shower for cleaning away impure thoughts when she's trying to break her obsession with Squid Girl.
-   In a scene in the manga _Strawberry Marshmallow_, Miu spies on Ana to see if she's actually as... _developed_... up top as the way her clothing lays on her suggests, i.e. moreso than Miu. Apperently so. She's 11, though, and Barbie Doll Anatomy is employed (no chest features are drawn).
-   One of the earliest and best known examples was Chun Li's in _Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie_. In fact, it became the most talked about scene in the movie, among western audiences, since anime and animated depictions of nudity were relatively new at that time. Plus, the scene involved a popular video game character, which helped the movie to gain notoriety; paving the way for others like it.
-   In episode 9 of _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_, being the only time you see Yoko with more skin showing than in her usual clothing is during her own Shower Scene. But let's just say it's not really the best moment for the fans to be happy... Tears are shed.
    -   The manga version of this scene in chapter 16 gives us some nice detail of Yoko's body which we don't see in the anime's counterpart.
-   Yuri Petrov gets one in the sixteenth episode of _Tiger & Bunny_. It turns out to be rather plot important, as that's when the rather nasty burn scar he got from his father is revealed.
-   The _Tokkô_ anime features two shower scenes, one with Ryoko and another with Kureha. Both feature full nudity from the waist up (which were edited/censored in the tv version) and Kureha's shower scene leads into a fight scene with Kureha fighting phantoms completely naked.
-   _Vampire Hunter D_: In the 1985 movie, after D returns Lamika to Count Magnus Lee's castle there's a brief scene in Doris Lang's house where she takes a shower.
-   Rayflo gets one right in the first chapter of _Vassalord_, just to make it clear what kind of series this is.

It starts with a shoulders-up shot of the protagonist's ally, complete with full nudity of extras in the background, displaying all the signs of being a standard shower scene. Then it turns into a psychedelic fight scene; we never see the protagonist's ally below the shoulders, and the protagonist stays clothed. But Joshuu Sasori isn't your typical women in prison film.
-   _Killer Klowns from Outer Space_: Debbie takes a shower and apparently spends a good half-hour in there while the popcorn Klown larva gestate. Given the PG-13 rating, it's not played for fanservice.

-   Lampshaded in _PCU_ as they watch _Dressed To Kill._ "Shower sceeeeene..."
-   _Pitch Perfect_ has this as an important plot point where Chloe witnesses Beca's singing talent and sings a duet rendition of Titanium by David Guetta in the same stall. After they are done singing, a naked man walks into them to compliment their singing.
-   _Porky's_ has a shower scene where the guys are watching the girls shower. One boy puts his penis through the hole only to have the female gym teacher grab it.
    -   "God damn it, would you move it, you lard-ass?"
-   _The Professional_ has a non-sexy one, when Leon is using the shower to clean and patch up a bullet wound.
-   _Psycho_ has probably the most famous shower scene in the movie history with (dramatic chords) included.
-   _Reform School Girls_ has two prominent shower scenes. In the first, Jenny and the other new arrivals are forced to shower as part of the decontamination process when arriving at the school. Later, important exposition is delivered during a communal shower scene featuring most of the inmates of the school.
-   _Resident Evil (2002)_ has the female protagonist taking a shower, only to be knocked unconscious by gas coming from the showerhead.
-   Downplayed in _Riddick_ where The Squadette handwashes herself from a basin (she's on a desert planet so water would be restricted). We get a look at Katee Sackhoff topless so no-one is complaining (including Katee, as her breast "looked it was 22" due to her raised arm as she scrubbed).
-   Considering that _Risky Business_ was basically a movie revolving around teenage wet dreams, it is no surprise that it gives us this trope at the beginning of the movie involving a dream Tom Cruise's character has about a hot girl showering.
-   There was a shower scene in _Road Trip_, described by one of the characters and shown to the viewer... put on pause when someone questioned it, the question is Hand Waved and we review to naked goodness.
-   Maid Marion accidentally stumbles upon the naked Robin Hood, bathing under a waterfall in _Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves_ — and thoroughly enjoys the view.
-   A Deleted Scene in _RoboCop 2_ has RoboCop walking through a coed shower room and stopping to look at a beautiful woman under a shower before abruptly walking away.
-   In _Room_, Ma and Jack have their first shower since escaping from Room. Jack has only known baths, and Ma tells him that a shower is splashier.
-   In _Sands of the Kalahari_, Grace is shown taking a shower when she is stuck in town waiting for a replacement flight. Includes Toplessness from the Back.
-   In _Satan's Cheerleaders_, there is a scene of the cheerleaders showering while the Crusty Caretaker Billy spies on them.
-   _Scream_:
    
    -   Parodied in the opening of _Scream 2_ when Phil and Maureen are at the premiere of _Stab_, a Ripped from the Headlines Film Within a Film based on the events of the first film. Casey Becker, played by Heather Graham, gets a gratuitous shower scene that causes Maureen to roll her eyes.
    
    **Maureen:** "Now why she gotta be naked? What does that have to do with the plot of the story, her being butt-ass naked?"  
    **Phil:** "I don't know about the plot, but I've got a stiffie."  
    **Maureen:** "You better loosen up that wrist."
    
    -   _Scream 3_, however, plays it straight in its opening, where Christine, one of the opening victims alongside her boyfriend Cotton, is showering when we're first introduced to her.
-   Downplayed in _Screamers_ when Jessica strips off her top to wash from a hand basin. Given that everyone's rugged up in combat gear, it's more than enough — the protagonist (who's been a soldier for the past ten years) just gives a quiet, "Good lord, you're beautiful" at the sight.

-   _The Seventh Victim_ has a scene where Mary, the innocent heroine, is showering when Mrs. Redi—soon to be revealed as a high priestess of a Satanic cult—enters the bathroom and tells Mary to back off of her investigation. The way the film is staged, with Mary taking her shower when the door opens and a silhouette appears on the other side of the shower curtain, is highly reminiscent of how the shower scene from _Psycho_ was framed 17 years later.
-   Maggie Gyllenhaal gets a bathtub scene in _Secretary_, and a post-shower scene in _Sherrybaby_.
-   _Sisters of Death_: In a Too Dumb to Live moment, Francie decides the best thing to do while trapped in hacienda with someone who is trying to kill you is to take a shower.
-   _Sixteen Candles_, of all things, contains an obvious bit of Fanservice: the high school's designated Hot Chick is spied upon by Molly Ringwald's character, a Naïve Everygirl who kvetches about her own lack of mammarial development in comparison.
-   _Snuff Movie_: Immediately after being shown her room in the mansion, Wendy takes a shower: accompanied by many lingering closeups.
-   _Spiders II: Breeding Ground_: Alexandra takes a shower in the captain's cabin after she and her husband arrive on the ship. One of the other crew members spies on her.
-   _Split Second (1992)_: Michelle (Kim Cattrall) takes a shower at Stone's apartment, during which she is almost attacked by the alien monster.
-   _The Spy Who Loved Me_. Considering that this takes place on a U.S. submarine and involves Barbara Bach, it gives a whole new meaning to the Navy expression "Hollywood shower". For the ignorant, a Hollywood shower is a long, luxurious shower, where you let the water run for the whole shower. By contrast, a Navy shower consists of running the water, cold, long enough to get wet, turning it off and soaping up, and running the water, still cold, long enough to rinse the suds off. The water is on for no more than two minutes in total. For obvious reasons, Hollywood showers are used as rewards. Though in this case it might have been the captain who was rewarded, as the shower curtain was slightly open.
-   _Starship Troopers_ is famous for a group, co-ed shower scene among the soldiers. Also notable in that, unlike most shower scenes, it showed full frontal nudity as opposed to just back shots. Reportedly, the cast refused to do the scene unless the director agreed to direct the scene in the nude. Which he did.
-   _Stoker_ features India seemingly in a Shower of Angst, after an Attempted Rape leads to the offender being killed by Charlie, but we quickly find out she has a very different reaction to events.
-   _The Summer of Sangaile_: Sangaile takes a shower (in which she's shown topless) as she contemplates the sunlight coming in.
-   _Sweet Sixteen_ opens with a gratuitous shower scene. As if that wasn't sleazy enough, the character that audience just ogled washing herself is revealed later to be only fifteen years old.
-   _Sweet, Sweet Lonely Girl_: Early on, Adele showers in her aunt's house and gets rust washing over her from the old pipe.
-   Averted in Sarah Polley's film _Take This Waltz_, which features a shower scene in a public swimming pool featuring Michelle Williams as protagonist Margot, Sarah Silverman as her friend, and another friend of theirs, along with several other women, with no frosted glass, steam or anything else. Fanservice is averted because the three younger women are talking about and to the considerably older (and larger) women showering opposite them, and the conversation is about how you get old and nobody's young and pretty forever.
-   In _Tank Girl_, Lori Petty has a waterless shower with some kind of white powder used to clean her body.
-   James Bond and Wai Lin share an outdoor shower (both clothed) in _Tomorrow Never Dies_, leading to a combination Shirtless Scene and Sexy Soaked Shirt.
-   _Train_: When the team is supposed to searching the train for Todd, Sheldon instead decides to go and spy on a hot woman taking a shower.
-   Helen Hunt takes a shower in _Twister_. Storm-chasing is no doubt dirty, gritty work with the high winds and all, but the scene itself is entirely gratuitous.
-   In _Two Moon Junction_, April (Sherilyn Fenn) reverses the roles and watches the guys shower at the country club.
-   Case in _The Unborn_ gets a shower scene, but you mostly see only her back.
-   _The Undertaker (1988)_: Pam has a shower in the middle of the movie. While she's showering, she interrupted by her housemate... after the preceding shots seemed to set her up to be killed in the shower by Roscoe.
-   _Valentine_: Kate is taking a shower in her apartment. She hears a noise, and with shampoo still in her hair, puts on a towel and goes out to investigate. Her water then goes out, prompting a bit where she dunks her head in the (hopefully clean) toilet to rinse the shampoo out of her hair.
-   _Waves_: Luke holds Emily in the shower while they're in a motel together.
-   _Weird Science_ has a scene where Gary and Wyatt shower with Lisa. They're later mocked by mutant bikers because both boys wore their jeans in the shower with Lisa being the only one naked.

-   Seen in _Whiteout_ with Kate Beckinsale's character, despite the water restrictions existing on a real life base in Antarctica which would prevent the above-mentioned 'Hollywood Shower'. It's one of the first scenes in the movie, it's very gratuitous, and it's probably there because Beckinsale spends the _rest_ of the movie in a bulky parka.
    -   Referenced in _Ice Bound_ (2003). Susan Sarandon's character is having a shower at the South Pole station when a man barges into her shower stall without invitation and shuts off the water, giving her a lecture on the need for water conservation when she complains.
-   In _When We Leave_ Umay abandons her abusive husband and returns home to Germany with her son. Soon after arriving at her family's home, she takes a shower. It is not played for fan service; despite her mother seeing Umay's bruised back, she tells Umay that she cannot separate a son from his father.
-   In _Wild Things_, Ray Duquette (Kevin Bacon) steps out of a shower near the end to meet up with Sam Lombardo, his accomplice in the whole scheme.
-   _Withnail and I_, a film that's extremely devoted to showing Paul McGann half-naked as often as possible, has an extended bathtub scene consisting of Paul McGann slowly shaving his face.
-   Harrison Ford's character in _Witness_ walks in on his Amish hostess giving herself a sponge bath.

    Literature 

-   In _Lieutenant Hornblower_ from _Horatio Hornblower_ book series, Horatio decides to have a shower on deck. It's described in great detail: the hoseman pumping a stream of water on him, Hornblower casting his towel aside, standing there naked in the sunshine, an amused crowd gathering to watch...
    
    _"Hornblower twirled round and round under the stinging impact, his face screwed up in painful ecstasy. Bush, looking at Hornblower revolving under the sparkling stream, was conscious of a prickling under his shirt in his heavy uniform coat, and actually had the feeling that it might be pleasurable to indulge in that sort of shower bath, however injurious it might be to the health."_
    
-   _Maisy Learns to Swim_, a children's picture book from the _Maisy First Experience Book_ series, shows Maisy the mouse standing naked taking a warm shower after she feels shivery from being in the pool, while chatting with her friend Tallulah, who is wrapped in a towel. (Note: Maisy, unlike some Funny Animals, is normally fully clothed.) This is a rare case in which no Fanservice whatsoever is involved, but it's notable that this is from the same series in which Maisy was shown taking a bath together with Tallulah (see Bathtub Bonding).
-   _Star Wars: Lost Stars_: The manga adaptation added a scene which has Ciena in the shower, with explicit nudity blocked by her arms and legs' positions (though the sides of her breasts are visible).
-   _Whateley Universe_: The school has a number of transgender students but only the standard male/female sanitary facilities and a policy that students are supposed to use whatever a person seeing them on the street would _expect_ them to. This includes Phase, who is intersex, appearing mostly female but retaining his male identity, orientation, and genitals. Furthermore, several of the girls in Poe Cottage are superhumanly beautiful. Phase ogling the "real" girls in the showers (being careful to linger at the mirrors to be discreet as possible) is something of a Running Gag in the series, with Vamp joining him at the mirrors later on much to the chagrin of everyone. The fact that the lesbian girls are all doing the same doesn't save him from their wrath.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Twisted slightly in _Babylon 5_ when someone asks about Commander Susan Ivanova. Cut to a person in a shower who quickly turns out to be Captain John Sheridan. But it's still a shower scene, ladies. Enjoy.
-   _The Bill_ had one during an episode when one of the female officers went undercover in a women's prison.

-   Kate Beckett gets one in the season 2 episode of _Castle_. "Tick...Tick...Tick...". Made somewhat less sexy in that Castle is trying to tell her that she's in danger, and when she steps out to answer his call, there's about three seconds of her in just a towel before the apartment _explodes_.
-   _Chuck_, Sarah, Devon (Captain Awesome) and Ellie. Casey did have a shower scene but remained more or less fully clothed because he was in medical distress (no fanservice for the ladies... yet).
-   _Dead Man's Gun_: In "Death Warrant", John Pike takes a bucket shower with a pair of prostitutes.
-   In the live-action J-Drama adaptation of _Death Note_, L and Light have one after the tennis match. It's played for all the Ho Yay Fanservice it's worth!
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The Third Doctor's debut. The scene was not a part of the original script and was added when the crew discovered the house they were filming in had an old-fashioned shower that looked so cool they couldn't resist using it.
    -   The Eleventh Doctor also gets one of these in "The Lodger". This further annoys his temporary landlord Craig, who is rather on the plump side, when Sophie, whom Craig is in love with but Cannot Spit It Out for her, walks in on the Doctor's half-naked, disheveled state and proceeds to openly ogle him in front of Craig.
-   _Dollhouse_ has one roughly every other episode. Coed showers for groups of people.
    -   In "Stop-Loss" non-doll Adelle steps into one to sober up (and for the view, presumably.)
    -   Also turned into a plot point when a male doll started to get sexually aroused during the group shower (which should have been impossible with his personality being wiped).
-   Inara gives herself a ritual sponge bath in the pilot of _Firefly_, and Shepherd Book walks in on her.
-   _Glee_ has one with Finn singing loudly into a bar of soap as he showers.
    -   Several times with Sam, including a singing scene a la Finn.
-   _Grey's Anatomy_ had one of the most blatant examples with a season two episode that opens with Izzy, Meredith and Christina taking a very steamy (yet somehow non-wet) shower together. It turned out to be just a dream sequence which served absolutely no purpose to the plot, to the characters or to anything else but drawing in male viewers. While they did do a non-sexy "reprise" to "justify" the whole thing, it was still completely pointless.
-   Once upon a time (1981-1987) in France, there was _Gym Tonic_, a fitness show whose entire closing credits was a shower scene with the two female leads. It was changed for a time, before being reverted due to fan outcry.
-   _Himmelsdalen_: Helena is shown going into the shower topless in episode three.
-   In "Mutiny" of _Horatio Hornblower_ adaptation, Lieutenant Hornblower decides that he needs to freshen himself a bit after serving an endless continuous watch assigned as a punishment by their madman of a captain. He gets a shower on deck while other sailors cheer him up. The audience gets to see his bare bum.
-   _House_ gets a few bath scenes, and one shower scene in "Distractions" which leads into a weird acid-trip sequence in which he is still dripping wet.
-   _I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!_ had Mylene Klass showering in a bikini. She came second. You do the math.
-   _Irma Vep_: Mira is shown getting into the shower and standing nude from the back while Regina looks on.
-   In _Jeeves and Wooster_ Bertie seems to get a bath-scene _every other episode_. Always with Jeeves in the room, too.
-   _Kamen Rider Gaim_ has one with Takatora. It being a children's show means that we don't generally see below his shoulders, except for a steamy (pardon the pun) shot of him from behind.
-   _Lexx_ had a few, sometimes including frontal nudity (depending on what country you were in). They were included on the DVD release. Some of these include:
    -   A scene with Zev on the Lexx with Stanley watching.
    -   A scene with Bunny getting some assistance from Kai.
    -   A scene where Zev is taking a bath and some vampire girls intend to scare her by dangling a live rat over her face. The plan backfires when Zev eats the rat, tail and all.
-   Kate has had several shower scenes on _Lost_. She also had an underwear-clad bathing scene in the pilot episode.
-   _Magnificent Century_ features rather a lot of bathing. The sexiness of it is not lost on the characters either, from Mahidevran who tries to use bathing, to İbrahim and Hatice, who go at it in the baths for no apparent reason, to Nigar Kalfa who stops by the baths to ogle her bathing crush.

-   _Misfits_: Alisha discovers Superhoodie's identity because she approaches him while he's showering.
-   _NCIS_:
    -   A number, including one where Gibbs, Tony, Kate and McGee all have to take one after a powder release in the office. Kate's rear has suds on it.
    -   Also subverted: a woman turns on her shower, Dress Hits Floor, her boyfriend puts on mood music, and then blood starts spurting from the showerhead. That must have killed the mood.

-   _Primeval_ Season 2: Stephen Hart comes home to find Helen Cutter in his shower: "Hope you don't mind. I got slimed in the Devonian and the smell would make your eyes water. Now stop staring and pass me a towel."
-   _Proven Innocent_: In a flashback, Maddie had one with Wren, her girlfriend, while they were both prisoners.

-   _Red Dwarf_: From "Krytie TV": "And now, Krytie TV presents... Women's Shower Night!"
-   _Rizzoli & Isles_: In "Class Action Satisfaction", Jane and Maura have to take a decontamination shower after being exposed to a potential pathogen.
-   _Special Ops: Lioness_: Cruz and Aaliyah have an intimate conversation in the shower.
-   Used in the _Stargate Universe_ episode "Darkness", when Chloe and Eli discover the only working showers on the ship. Unfortunately for Chloe, the power goes out right in the middle and she's left soaking wet, in nothing but a towel. Needless to say, Eli is slightly distracted.
    
    **Naked!Chloe:** Eli, I'm getting dressed. Wait up.  
    **Eli:** Sure!  
    _\[Beat\]_  
    **Chloe:** Turn around!  
    **Eli:** Right, right! Sorry!
    
-   _Star Trek: Enterprise_. Captain Archer takes a shower, but the Artificial Gravity goes off. Unfortunately for female viewers, he doesn't float up enough to show anything besides his chest.
-   _Star Trek: Voyager_: B'Elanna spends most of "Juggernaut" covered in sweat, grime, and a tank-top, and ends it with a sonic shower. In "Drone" we find her shower has a Video Phone in it, purely for Rule of Funny when the Doctor calls her there.
-   _Tales from the Crypt_: In "The Man Who Was Death", there is is a lingering shot of one of Niles' victims taking a shower before she hops into the hot tub, just before Niles turns it into an Electrified Bathtub.
-   _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_ has a couple of these, one by Sarah and one by Derek. The former is also a Shower of Angst, while the latter is most definitively a Shirtless Scene.
-   _Van Helsing (2016)_: Shortly after Vanessa wakes up from her coma into a post-apocalyptic world, she takes a shower. Axel walks in on her to warn her to keep the shower short since they need to conserve water.
-   _We Are Who We Are_: Caitlin is briefly shown taking a shower, and naked from behind as she does, although it's dim through the door.
-   _Weeds_ has a bath of angst scene, which shows off Mary-Louise Parker's considerable, um, assets.
-   _Willow_: Boorman has one in his flashback after he escapes the trolls via the refuse barrel, shown under a waterfall as he happily gets clean, tossing around his long hair.
-   In _Zoey 101_, both Logan and Michael get one. And both are interrupted, the first one by a TV Crew, the second by _a horse_.

    Music 

-   Alizée's song "J'en ai marre". Cute French girl, fully dressed, in a giant glass cube, water pouring over her half the time. Oh, and the song is quite catchy too.
-   In AOA's dance unit's fanservice-heavy "Miniskirt" video, member Hyejeong takes a shower clothed... and then takes a bubble bath unclothed.
-   In Billy Idol's video for "Catch My Fall", Billy is shown taking a shower during the last verse, with a conveniently hung washcloth hiding his "naughty bits".
-   In the music video for Jewel's song Stand spends at least half of it with her in the shower.
-   Billy Joel's video for "Allentown" features a scene with the steelworkers showering.

    Theatre 

-   In _The Women_, Crystal has the curtains drawn before actually taking a shower, but before that is sitting in the bathtub naked for most of the scene.

    Video Games 

-   _Agent Under Fire_ had one in the fourth mission. Turned out it was actually R.
    -   "Ah! The latest in holographic technology. I thought that would catch your eye, 007."
-   _ANNO: Mutationem_: One of the first things Ann does in the introduction is take a shower, which is shown from outside the bathroom and with a conveniently placed jar blocking most of the view.
-   _Bayonetta 3_ has two stealth missions where To regain some health, Jeanne can take a shower. However, a passing Homunculi can take notice and try to take a peek. Jeanne quickly drags them inside the shower and takes care of them.
    
    **Jeanne:** I've killed for less.
    
-   Possible to invoke in _Endless Ocean: Blue World_ if you use the shower facilities behind the cabin of Nineball Island. (You take it in a swimsuit, though. In fact, you can't take it unless you have a swimsuit equipped. Justified as the shower is outside on this small island.)
-   Part of _Geist_ involves scaring a woman taking a shower so that you can possess her friend; she helpfully has soap suds covering her private parts, while the friend is clad in towels. A man is even peeping on them through a crack in the wall beforehand.
-   _Life Is Strange_ franchise:
    -   _Life Is Strange_: In Episode 2 of the protagonist Max Caulfield takes a morning shower, during which she overhears other girls' conversation.
    -   _Life Is Strange: Before the Storm_: Chloe takes a shower in her home but first has to find where her towel went now that her mother's boyfriend has moved in and rearranged the bathroom.
-   In _Mass Effect 3_, Female Shepards have the option to offer Specialist Traynor a shower in their private cabin. And then join her.
-   Mona in _Max Payne 2_ bared her back through censor steam in the 3D cutscene and donned a towel in the comic panels. A cheat code to unlock Mona's hidden model showed that her nude body was fully rendered from all directions.
-   In _No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle_, the Save Point is a toilet when you're playing as Travis. During the sequence you play Shinobu, it's a shower. Much like Travis can always find functional toilets, she can always find surprisingly elegant showers.
-   _Parasite Eve 2_: _The 3rd Birthday_ takes it to another level though, it makes the scene in PE2 look arguably classier.
-   _Persona 3_: Not altogether willingly. Creates a bit of Fridge Logic (if not outright Plot Hole) in that the water is perfectly clean, even though it was stated and shown repeatedly that all water turns to blood during the Dark Hour.
-   Shion had a nice steamy one in _Xenosaga III_.
-   Quantic Dream tends to have at least one per game:
    -   All three playable characters have one in _Fahrenheit_/_Indigo Prophecy_. Carla is the only one whose character model is actually naked during the scene (Lucas and Tyler's boxers are sometimes visible).
    -   Madison's shower scene in _Heavy Rain_. Or Ethan Mars' (which was considerably less fan service-y in that regard).
    -   _Beyond: Two Souls_: There are two shower scenes in the game with Jodie that are most notable for the resulting real-life controversy. The first is in the "Navajo" chapter in an outdoor shower in the desert and the second in "The Dinner" as she prepares for her date with Ryan. Nothing explicit is visible in the game proper, but a player who had access to the source code managed to manipulate the camera to release a naked version. Elliot Page threatened to sue Sony since he had never agreed to be featured nude.
    -   Sure enough, _Detroit: Become Human_ has one too - only this one has Connor dumping a fully-clothed Hank in the tub and turning on the water in order to sober him up.
-   Subverted in the second _Tomb Raider_. After clearing the Bonus Level, which consists of Lara shooting thugs while dressed in a bathrobe, it looks like you're gonna get a Shower Scene for your efforts... But then Lara says "Don't you think you've seen enough?" and shoots the camera.
-   You can make Sonic and Knuckles take a shower in Casinopolis of _Sonic Adventure_, although only Sonic reacts to the water.
-   Even _Street Fighter IV_ got into the act; during Seth's intro, there is a scene with Seth taking a shower.
-   Twice in the _The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_. Although neither example is directly 'a shower', it's as close as it gets in a fantasy medieval setting.
    -   First time in Novigrad, when Geralt visits the four bosses of the criminal underworld in a bathhouse which is full of semi-naked ladies.
    -   When Ciri nearly drowns after teleporting to Skellige, she is taken to a nearby village which conveniently has hot springs and a sauna. Ciri visits it in the company of a girl and her mother who tended to her wounds, although Ciri herself is wrapped in tight bandages.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair_, after overhearing Mahiru and Hiyoko taking a shower together, Hajime, in complete out-of-character, develops an urge to peep on both them, with him envisioning the scenario entirely. He immediately regrets his off-moment and pondered what even made him lost sight of himself.
-   The protagonist of _Daughter for Dessert_ walks in on Amanda in the shower (before he knows that she’s attracted to him). He’s surprised that Amanda makes no move to hide her body.
-   The protagonist of _Double Homework_ once sees Johanna in the shower, and she gives him a not-so-subtle hint that she wants him to come in.
-   Apart from her shower scenes with the protagonist, the title character of _Melody_ also has a couple of solo shower scenes.
-   _Plumbers Don't Wear Ties_ shows both John and Jane showering as part of their morning routines. Their butts and Jane's Sideboob are censored with faces that have Gag Noses on them, but they can be removed with a code. The game even says that it has shower scenes on its box, along with things like pandas and a nun.
-   The Screaming Author case in _Spirit Hunter: NG_ features a scene where Akira takes a shower in his apartment, including a split-second CG of Akira's soaked, naked upper half. Though it quickly becomes Fan Disservice when one notices the bloodstained hand reaching out to Akira from the mirror.

    Webcomics 

-   _Angels 2200_ has _lots_ of shower scenes for its Improbably Female Cast, however including Censor Steam and Godiva Hair.
-   _Eerie Cuties_ has featured several, for both comedy and fanservice:
-   _Freefall_ has one of these in a sub-arc, starting here. Since then there have been several more, mostly played straight. The one for the Oct 24, 2011 strip, however, subverts the usual Fanservice purpose: Florence showers with her clothes still on, as her outfit was just as dirty as she was and she was fatigued from the day's ordeal.
-   In _Girl Genius_ Zeetha takes a shower on the same page that Violetta and Agatha can be seen bathing while they are at the Immortal Library.
-   _El Goonish Shive_ likes to use shower scenes to show characters reflecting, or deep in thought:
-   _Ménage à 3_ has too many to count, and they're frequently notable for featuring uninterrupted views of breasts and butts. While they usually serve mildy erotic or fanservice-y purposes, some of the characters occasionally use _cold_ showers as ways to control their runaway sexual emotions. It's notable that every private dwelling in the comic, right down to affordable one-person apartments, seems to have a shower large enough to hold three people in comfort.
-   _Sabrina Online_:
-   _Sandra on the Rocks_ gets no less than three female characters (fairly innocently) into the same shower here, and still remains just about SFW. Also, as in the parent comic, _Ménage à 3_ (above), every private dwelling, down to "rustic" apartments, seems to have a shower large enough to take two or three people in comfort.
-   _Sticky Dilly Buns_ plays with the trope a little here, as two characters who are used to sharing a shower scene blunder in on someone who isn't. It is, incidentally, a measure of how quickly the prudish and virginal Ruby is adapting to the situation in the apartment that she is merely angry at this, rather than incoherent with rage or embarrassment. Note that, typically for this comic's universe, the apartment has a shower large enough for three people.
-   _The Whiteboard_:

    Web Original 

-   The menu for the second TGWTG DVD involves The Nostalgia Critic getting barged in on by his brother while he's in the shower. He's rather questioning of this.
-   Shows up in Welshy's year 4 anniversary video.

    Western Animation 

-   In _Batman: The Animated Series_, Bruce Wayne is sometimes shown stepping into the shower after working out, and later stepping out of the shower as he talks to Alfred about the latest thing that is troubling him.
-   _Batman Beyond_ has a lovely five-second scene of Terry in the shower after escaping Stalker. There's some fanservice one can agree with. Another episode has Dana in a Modesty Towel about to get in the shower at school, only to be interrupted by a "ghost" (actually a remote-viewing telekinetic) messing with all the shower heads.
-   _Kaeloo_: In episode 134, Kaeloo is shown taking a shower.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  It lasts for a few seconds before several clones of Stumpy flush all the toilets they can find and the water runs out, forcing her to cut her shower short.
-   In _What If…? (2021)_ episode 5, the orientation video includes a segment on "Hygiene" demonstrated by showing Bucky Barnes in the shower with some steam covering everything below the waist.
-   In the _Felix the Cat (Joe Oriolo)_ episode "Stone Age Felix", Felix is shown taking a cold shower when he is freezing.
-   The boys of _South Park_ get one in "Lil' Crime Stoppers". Unlike the previous examples, no attempt was made at preserving their modesty: in fact, a full-frontal shot of Stan, Kyle, and Cartman was used in the opening credits for several years afterward.
-   In episode 22 of _Wakfu_, a sunstroke-suffering Sadlygrove has a hallucination of Evangelyne showering with Censor Steam around.
-   _We Bare Bears_: In "Crowbar Jones", Grizzly's movie includes a gratuitous Shower Scene (with painted-on biceps and abs) which at that point is when the audience starts to leave.
