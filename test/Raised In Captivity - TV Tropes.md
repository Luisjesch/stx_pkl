This trope occurs when a wild animal raised in a zoo, household, or farm environment suddenly finds itself in its "natural" environment and is expected to survive. Naturally, this presents some difficulties for the poor critter, as it never learned basic survival skills from its parents.

This is a common problem with the animals raised in captive breeding programs: they haven't learned to be scared of their natural predators, they might not know how to find food, and due to imprinting, they may have the indelible misapprehension that they're supposed to mate with humans rather than their own species. Zoos are getting better at this but it's still hard.

This Trope is sometimes Truth in Television, as if a zoo is going to rehabilitate their animals, they usually provide environments that allow the animals to practice survival skills prior to their release, so it's logical that an animal who lacked that kind of training would struggle.

Sub-Trope of Fish out of Water, often the result of Pet Baby Wild Animal. Compare Raised by Orcs, Raised by Wolves, Escaped from the Lab, and A Pet into the Wild. Contrast with From Stray to Pet, where a stray/feral domestic animal gets adopted,

     Film - Animation  

-   In _Rio_, Blu is a tame blue macaw, and spends the middle of the film chained (by smugglers) to Jewel, a wild blue macaw. Blu finds the jungles outside the city to be particularly frightening, mainly because of his inability to fly (though most of the film takes place in the city, where Blu is not entirely so helpless). Blu's inability to survive in the wild becomes a bigger plot point in the sequel, _Rio 2_, where he and his family travel to the Amazon.

     Film - Live Action  

-   A large portion of _Born Free_ centers around a couple trying to rehabilitate a lion raised in captivity to the wild. They do manage it, but it's a very difficult process. Justified as the film is Based on a True Story and is actually fairly accurate to the reality of the story it's based on (see Real Life).
-   _Two Brothers_ has a pair of tiger cubs that are made pets after their mother is killed. When they break free, the characters express the fear that they may end up becoming man-eaters because they never learned to hunt.

-   In the film adaptation of _Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone_, Harry chats with a snake (not knowing that he can speak Parseltongue) and asks if he knew his parents. The snake sadly gestures towards a sign that says "raised in captivity", and Harry sympathises with the creature as he didn't know his parents either. He accidentally lets the snake go due to Power Incontinence from magical powers he didn't know he possessed, meaning that it gets to go free. It thanks him before it leaves the reptile house, scaring the crap out of several bystanders.
-   Mostly averted or downplayed in the Jurassic Park\-Jurassic World movies despite most of the dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals being born and raised in captivity. When the park(s) collapsed and they have escaped, the animals have managed to easily transition to life in the wild.

     Literature  

-   Bagheera in Rudyard Kipling's original _The Jungle Book_ was raised in the Maharajah's menagerie but had no trouble adapting to jungle life after his escape.

-   Inverted with General Woundwort of _Watership Down_, who was taken in by a kindly human after his mother's death. Growing up apart from other rabbits, and getting hassled by the dog when his rescuer's back was turned, actually made him far tougher than any wild-reared rabbit could be expected to become, ready and able to fight off predators.
-   In _The Fox and the Hound_, Tod the fox's family is killed by hunters when he's just a kit. One of them takes pity on him and adopts him, and even runs more-or-less harmless experiments on him to compare his skills to a puppy he's being raised with. Tod eventually leaves the cushy domestic life and goes on to do just fine in the wild, eventually becoming the last of the wild foxes as suburbia destroys the forest.
-   In _Bambi_, Faline's twin brother Gobo was presumed to have been killed as a fawn however it turns out he was taken in by hunters.

He ends up killed when he approaches a hunter.

She's presented as the Naïve Newcomer of the group (with the other three cubs being born in the wild).
-   Aldagon from _The Blood of a Dragon_ complains that she tried rescuing her dragon brethren from a farm where they are raised for magical ingredients, but "Few have lived long enough to learn speech, and none long enough to learn sense."

-   In _The One and Only Ivan_, Ivan was taken from his family at a very young age and shipped across the sea in a crate, where he was raised in a human home like a human child until he grew too large and strong, at which point he was shut into a tiny glass enclosure in a mall. For _twenty seven years_. As with the real gorilla the book is loosely based on, attitudes on animal husbandry changed and he was eventually taken from the mall and to a zoo, because he absolutely couldn't have survived in the wild.

     Real Life  

-   Christian the Lion is a real-life subversion. He was raised as a pet in London during the 1960's. When he grew too large to live in the city, he was taken to a wildlife preserve where he adapted very quickly becoming the leader of his very own pride.
-   Before Christian, there was Elsa, an orphaned lion cub raised to adulthood by game warden George Adamson and his wife Joy in 1956. Rather than send Elsa to a zoo when they could no longer keep her, the Adamsons decided to set her free; though it was a long and difficult process, they eventually succeeded in teaching Elsa to live in the wild.

He failed to reintegrate with wild orcas and died of pneumonia in 2003.
-   Animal rights groups such as PETA have been known to take animals and dump them into the wild. In nearly every case, this ended badly as the newly-freed animals starved, died of exposure, or other ways, such as one high-profile case where minks were released from a fur farm and were subsequently killed trying to cross a busy road nearby. In another misguided endeavor, one group ended up releasing a bunch of rabbits who had been raised in a lab. Understandably, most quickly died.
-   It isn't unknown for people to release their tame, exotic pet animals into the wild. This may-or-may-not work depending on the animal and the environment. Sometimes animals actually thrive and become an invasive species, but usually they die for various reasons.
