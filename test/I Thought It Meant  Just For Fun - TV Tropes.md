_"**In**flammable means flammable?! What a country!"_

Some of the trope names can be a bit arbitrary, or named after certain series, or punny. Here's a list to make the titles more clear. Obviously, while this list _can_ be very helpful, it's mostly Just for Fun.

A Sister Page to I Thought That Was (confusing work titles), I Read That As (confusing what titles read as), Canonical List of Subtle Trope Distinctions (telling similar tropes apart), This Index Is Not an Example (trope namers that don't use the trope), The Problem with Pen Island (confusing how words are separated) and I Heard That As (mishearing lyrics or dialogue).

Compare Square Peg, Round Trope, You Keep Using That Word, Commonly Misused Words, The Big List of Booboos and Blunders, Lousy Alternate Titles (what names could come from definitions) and X Meets Y.

Contrast Exactly What It Says on the Tin. See Non-Indicative Name when this applies to works.

Has nothing to do with mistranslations.
