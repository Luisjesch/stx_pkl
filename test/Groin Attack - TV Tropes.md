Woman of Steel, Crotch of Kleenex.

_"But the ball! In his groin! It works on so many levels!"_

It's not always played for comedy, but seeing someone get struck in the crotch is usually just plain funny. Whether the object doing the striking is an errant piece of sports equipment or a deliberately placed foot, the end result is going to be a grown man doubled over and trembling with pain. Bonus points if he then hobbles away and says something in a high-pitched voice. Not only will everyone find this hilarious, but tape it and play it back for the guy and even _he_ will probably laugh. At least, once the swelling goes down. Sometimes a cause of Amusing Injuries, especially if the victim is asking for it. In shows targeted at children, it's often a Dangerous Forbidden Technique, or at least treated as one in-story (see _3 Ninjas_ and _Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie_). In Japanese media, the blow is often accompanied by the sound of a bell.

Effectively, this is a human-anatomy's version of Attack Its Weak Point for massive damage. A subversion of this is Balls of Steel, where a character — for whatever reason — does not take damage from a Groin Attack (or at least doesn't take _extra_ damage).

This trope is made possible thanks to an interesting quirk in the human body's design; as the testicles function best at a temperature slightly lower than the core body temperature, this is why they hang slightly lower, and can be raised or lowered by reflex activity to ensure they stay at the right temperature in relation to ambient conditions. Thus, compared to other body parts, even the other ones typically seen as weak points (stomach, solar plexus, toes, etc), one's Crown Jewels are considerably less 'armoured', hence why striking them hurts so much.

This usually only applies to men. Female characters are rarely subjected to groin attacks of any kind, and when they are, they are also likely to just shrug off in a moment.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Female genitals also lack the squish factor that comes from swinging in the wind. On the symbolic level, a groin attack on a male— especially if it's delivered by a female — represents that male being brought low by a well-placed blow to the very source of his masculine pride.

In contrast to most groin attacks, groin attacks that draw blood or involve some form of mutilation are very likely _not_ to be played for comedy — and owing to the Primal Fear of bad things happening to our nether regions, particularly nasty attacks of this nature can be downright _disturbing_. Apart from being a hallmark of the Lust variant of the Serial Killer, this form of attack is most often used as either a particularly vicious form of Cold-Blooded Torture or as a way for Antiheroes to punish rapists and other sexual criminals, though a particularly vicious Combat Pragmatist may also use this tactic as just one more way to even the score or gain the upper hand in a fight. It may _still_ come off as funny, though, if the guy is perceived as having brought it upon himself, such as having his gun go off in his pants. See Crippling Castration for examples of groin attacks that lead to the unfortunate victim losing his organs/the ability to procreate.

Along with Taser Tag Weakness, the Groin Attack also seems to be very effective against Superheroes and Supervillains, although some of them are immune.

Compare Freudian Threat. Very common from someone in Pervert Revenge Mode. For certain kinds of groin injuries (actual or threatened) specifically related to sexual encounters, see both Vagina Dentata and Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex. Also see Standard Female Grab Area for a similar incapacitating spot. Eye Scream, Fingore, and The Tooth Hurts are other primal fear reactions. The Distaff Counterpart to this trope is Breast Attack, although women can be subject to Groin Attacks as well, despite what the Female Groin Invincibility trope would have you think. Often utilized by a Combat Pragmatist, and commonly followed up by Instant Soprano and/or Share the Male Pain. Not an uncommon aftereffect of Tar and Feathers. May be used as part of a "Balls" Gag, though the overlap is smaller than one might think. Near-Miss Groin Attack is when an aversion of this trope is Played for Laughs.

It might involve a Sympathetic Wince and possibly a Universal Group Reaction.

## **WARNING: No matter who you are, reading these may cause extreme paranoia about injury to the pubic area and wincing in sympathy pains. Also, this is _never_ as funny in Real Life as it is on TV and can actually cause _very_ nasty injuries, so unless you are in a real self-defense scenario, Don't Try This at Home.**

-   In an Airheads commercial, during a school play where the lead star is singing "The life of a sailor! That's the life for me", the other students were bored with the play, and one of the students eats an Airhead, causing his head to turn into a balloon, deflate across the room, knocking down sets, and hitting the lead character in the groin, with predictable results:
    
    **Lead character:** _\[oblivious to the deflating head going across the room\]_ The life of a sail... _\[balloon head hits him in the balls, causing a zoom up on his face, as his voice grows high pitched\]_ _...oooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! That's the life for me...!_

    Jokes 

-   One morning, a man discovers an enormous _gorilla_ in his front yard, destroying everything in sight. Terrified, he immediately calls his local animal control service. His local animal control agent sadly informs him that he can't do anything to help him, but he gives him the phone number of a professional "Gorilla Exterminator" who specializes in getting rid of fugitive gorillas. Desperate, the man calls the gorilla exterminator and begs him for help. The gorilla exterminator agrees to come over—but he tells the man that his partner is currently out of town, so he may need to help him. A few hours later, the exterminator arrives in a large van and finds the gorilla hiding in a tree. The man goes out to greet him, and the exterminator opens up the back of his van and shows off his tools: a baseball bat, an angry pit bull, and a loaded shotgun. The exterminator picks up the baseball bat, orders the pit bull to stand guard under the tree, and hands the shotgun to the man. Slowly and methodically, the gorilla exterminator explains his plan: he'll climb up the tree and attack the gorilla with the baseball bat until it falls out of the tree; when the gorilla falls out of the tree, the pit bull (which is specially trained) will immediately bite it in the testicles, incapacitating it just long enough for the gorilla exterminator to capture it in a net and drag it away. Puzzled, the man scratches his head. _"Then what's the shotgun for?"_ he asks. _"Simple!"_, the gorilla exterminator says. _"If I fall out of the tree instead, shoot the dog."_
-   Jane meets Tarzan in the jungle. She is immediately attracted to him and wants to have sex with him, but he says, "Tarzan not know sex." After Jane explains what it is, Tarzan says, "Ohhh...Tarzan use knot hole in trunk of tree." Jane says, "No, no, that's not how it's done! I'll show you." She takes off her dress and lies down in front of him. Tarzan removes his loincloth and kicks her as hard as he can in the crotch. After rolling around in pain for a few minutes, Jane gasps and says, "What did you do _that_ for?!" Tarzan replies, "Check for squirrel."
-   Getting kicked in the balls is more painful than labor pains. Even after giving birth, people would still say "let's have another child", but no one who gets kicked in the balls ever say "hey, kick me in the balls again."

    Music 

-   "Weird Al" Yankovic
    -   In "I Can't Watch This" (which parodies MC Hammer's "U Can't Touch This"), one line goes: "That's funny as a kick in the crotch/And that kind of show, I can't watch".

    Myths & Religion 

-   Norse Mythology:
    -   This trope being Played for Laughs is at least Older Than Print! The giantess Skaði (or anglicized as Skadi), whose father was killed by the Aesir, goes to them demanding reparations. Among her demands is making her laugh. Loki tries his hand at the task...by tying his testicles to a goat's beard and proceeding to have a tug-of-war contest with the goat. You better believe Skaði couldn't avoid laughing then.
-   In Greek Mythology:
    -   The Titan Cronos cut off the genitals of his father Ouranos with the latter’s own sickle as he was about to have sex with Gaea and then took his father’s place as ruler of the world. If that wasn’t enough the severed genitals birthed Love Goddess Aphrodite after falling into the ocean.
        -   In Tzetzes’s account groin karma does comes back to Cronos, as his son Zeus after rescuing his siblings from Cronos’ stomach castrates him as well.
    -   Adonis was caught in a Love Triangle between Persephone and Aphrodite. Aphrodite won, and the jealous Persephone told Ares of Aphrodite's new lover. Ares turned into a boar and gored Adonis in the crotch.
    -   Vincenzo de'Rossi's statue of Herakles wrestling King Diomedes shows one demigod, caught in a piledriver, countering by grabbing the other demigod's junk.
-   The Fisher King from the Parcival mythos. A spear got him in the hips...groins...whatever. (Your Bowdlerize may vary, see here for details.)
-   From Japanese Mythology , there's the legend of "Kanamara" ("steel penis"), where there's a demon who takes a liking to a Girl Next Door, and forcibly gives her a Vagina Dentata via Demonic Possession, and who inflicts this on at least two prospect grooms during their respective wedding nights. The third groom was a blacksmith who forged a "dildo" and tricked the demon into biting it instead of his cock, managing to shoo the demon away and get Happily Married to the grateful girl. The legend would be the origin of the rather infamous "Kanamara Matsuri"
-   _The Bible_:
    -   In the _Books of Samuel_, Saul agrees to let David marry his daughter Michal only if David brings him 100 Philistine foreskins. David goes above and beyond by bringing him _200_ foreskins. Mercifully, some translations point out that he killed them first.

    Pinballs 

-   Hitting Dracula in _Monster Bash_ sometimes causes him to say a line implying that he's being hit in the crotch.
    
    **Dracula:** Not below the belt!
    

    Podcasts 

-   Multiple times in the _Cool Kids Table_ game _Homeward Bound 4_. Jake the Deinonychus slips when trying to glide off a tree and attack a human, and ends up slamming his cloaca into the branches. Ironically, this was in an attempt to eat the nuts of a guy who had shot him previously. But after however many failures, he _finally_ manages to eat them two-thirds through.
-   _Sick Sad World_: Implied during the Elliot Rodger case. One of the people Rodger murdered was stabbed 94 times, half of which were on his lower body. Dev remarks Rodger might have been working some things out.

    Radio 

-   One of the recurring Parody Commercials on _Martin/Molloy_ was a promo for lowbrow Brit Com _Ow! Me Plums!_, which always consisted of an elaborate setup that resulted in the main character (voiced by Tony Martin) being hit in the groin and screaming his catchphrase "Ow! Me plums!"

    Roleplay 

-   In _Destroy the Godmodder_, trying to aim for the groin of the titular character usually paints the attacker as a newbie to the game. Why? It never does anything. He's the Godmodder.
-   Spc. Crota from _Darwin's Soldiers_ sneaks under a guard and shoots him in the groin.
-   In _The Gamer's Alliance_, groin attack is Ax's preferred method of dealing with male enemies. Poor Refan gets to experience it firsthand.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Inquisitor_, a spin off of _Warhammer 40,000_, you can choose to aim for an opponent's groin. It causes a fair bit of damage, and leaves them almost useless for a turn. It's funny.
    -   Some players have remarked about unusually accurate shots from meltaguns ("weaponised microwave oven" is a fairly accurate description) and chainswords.
        -   In the Ork Codex, a mortally-wounded Warboss did this to a _Daemon Prince_ as a kind of "parting shot". With a _Power Klaw_. Khorne was so impressed he resurrects the orks every day on that planet so they can fight and die and fight again. It's win-win.
    -   Not quite played for drama or comedy, but Gabriel Seth of the Flesh Tearers Space Marines has a special rule that means he gains one attack every time an enemy unit rolls a 1 on a D6 when rolling To-Hit. This is supposed to represent him doing this along with headbutting and throat-biting. Yep. He's just like that.
-   I.C.E.'s _Cyberspace_ had the following entry in the "Critical Failure: Melee" table: "Worst move seen in years. You take 60 pts of damage to your own groin. Opponent stunned for 3 rounds with laughter."
-   In _Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay_, the Bretonian truffle hound is noted as becoming extremely jealous of _any_ males in the vicinity after eating a truffle, and will take steps to rectify the situation. The consequences are not spelled out, but are still pretty obvious.
    -   A fan-made Critical Hit table follows the usual Double Standard in that female recipients are incapacitated only half as long as an unprotected male.
-   In _GURPS_, this is very effective, causing twice the normal shock penalty.
    -   If you're small enough, the game allows you to upper-cut an enemy in the groin.
    -   There's also the "Testicle Grab" technique.
    -   If you randomly attack someone the groin is the second most likely part of the body to be hit.
    -   A picture in High-Tech features a man being aimed at with targeting lasers... including a few pointed at his crotch
-   _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_ has one entry on the Battle Scars table labeled simply "Ahem..." The injured spot isn't named, but it's specified that you are now immune to seduction attempts, unable to seduce others, and (if male) sterile.
-   In _Hackmaster_, gnome titans have a special "groin stomp" attack, and characters can perform a "groin punch" attack.
-   The Celestial Monkey martial arts style in _Exalted_ lets you make a called shot to an opponent's primary virtues, as represented by areas of the body. In Valor's case, said area is the groin (something of a pun on "balls of steel"). This does up to five levels of lethal damage depending on the enemy's courage, which is impressive considering that just-starting Exalts and heroic mortals only have seven. (You can punch a moderately-brave extra in the crotch _so hard he dies_. Never let it be said that _Exalted_ does anything by halves.) This is bonus damage in addition to whatever damage got past their soak, making it possible to kill an Exalt with a kick to the nuts.
-   Perhaps showing _The Monster Squad_ as one of its influences, _Grimm_ has an advantage that can be taken by PCs who already have the advantage "Dirty Fighting" called "Right In The Nards!", and the rules on combat feature an illustration of a kid kicking a wolf-man in the crotch.
-   The fan created netbook "Guide To Unlawful Carnal Knowledge" for AD&D features "The Rack Critical Hit Table," which shows the various results of a male character getting "racked."
-   _Paranoia_ supplement _Acute Paranoia_, adventure "Miami Laser". At the end of the adventure, after the "Miami Laser" show replaces the Teela O'Malley show, any surviving Troubleshooters are attacked by rabid Teela O'Malley fans. One of the attacks they use is a knee to the groin.
-   Implied by the "Psycho Squirrel" monster in _Munchkin_, as it will not attack females, or characters wearing the "spiked codpiece" item. And its "bad stuff" is "speak in a high squeaky voice until next turn".
-   Seth Farrow, recurring villain in _Scion_, took a shotgun blast to the groin the night he murdered his nephew Horace's family. It's never stated outright, but it's clearly implied he lost his genitals; most notably, when a captured Donnie Rhodes greets him with "How they hangin'?", Seth pulls a knife on him (Kane barely keeps him from using it).
-   Iron Crown Enterprises: Any location based damage in HARP or Rolemaster with a hit location of "Abdomen and Groin".
-   _Shadowrun_. In the short story "Plus ça Change" at the beginning of the 2nd Edition main rules, the street samurai Nameless kicks a Rat shaman in the groin to prevent him from casting a spell.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_, _Dungeon_ magazine adventure "Flowfire". A half-ogre named Thrash Groin-Guard has a spike on the knee of his armor. He can strike twice with the spike per round, aiming for his opponent's groin. To add insult to injury the spike is poisoned, doing 1-6 additional Hit Points of damage per minute.
-   According to the _Vampire: The Masquerade_ book _House of Tremere,_ the Tremere stronghold of Ceoris was actually created through one of these. Back in the days when Tremere and his followers were still mortal mages, the most powerful of his House gathered in the mountains of Transylvania to ritually consecrate the site of their intended chantry: said ritual commenced with Goratrix willingly castrating himself with a sickle and using his own severed genitals as a sacrificial offering. For good measure, after Ponticulus had to be sacrificially decapitated for accidentally interrupting the ritual, Etrius decided to compound the sacrifice by putting Goratrix's amputated penis in the severed head's mouth <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . And in a final insult, Goratrix - who'd only committed to this act of sacrifice in the knowledge that magic could heal these kind of injuries - discovered that his regeneration left a lot to be desired.

    Theatre 

-   In _The Complete History Of America Abridged_, one of the poses used to illustrate the intensity of combat in The American Civil War is one actor kicking another in the groin.
-   In _Reefer Madness: The Musical_, Jesus tells Jimmy that if he keeps smoking marijuana and goes to Hell, one of the things he'll experience is "separation from \[his\] family jewels." The angel chorus then chimes in with a cheery "Rama-lama! They're gonna cut your ding-dong!"
-   In _The Rose Tattoo_, the fight Alvaro gets into culminates with him taking a hit to the groin from the Traveling Salesman's knee.
-   In _A Very Potter Musical_, this is what happens to Snape during the snake attack death scene.

    Theme Parks 

-   In _Waterworld: A Live Sea War Spectacular_ at Universal Studios, Helen manages to defeat one of the Smokers by pulling this on them.

## Obtaining the Balls

Inspector Gadget mistakenly does this to the guru while trying to train his new cybernetic body (he was blindfolded so that he could "visualize his goal"), after the guru tells him to focus on "obtaining the balls" — as in the metal balls on the floor.
