**Betty Childs:** Are all nerds as good as you?  
**Lewis:** Yes.  
**Betty:** How come?  
**Lewis:** 'Cause all jocks ever think about is sports. All we ever think about is sex.

Sometimes nerdy characters are depicted as being naive and ignorant about sex. Other times, however, nerdy, dorky, and geeky characters are shown to be _hyper-focused_ on sex, to an almost unhealthy or creepy degree. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

Like with Nerds Are Naïve, this seems to be related to the stereotype that Nerds Are Virgins; the typically No Social Skills\-having nerdy characters can't flirt well enough to successfully attract suitors, leaving them with a lack of personal experience regarding sex that becomes a _fixation_. Such nerds might think about sex constantly, drool and ogle over the bodies of their peers, playfully grope their friends, have a robust collection of porn, Hentai, and/or H-Games (depending on the flavor of nerd they are), try to peep at the popular cheerleaders or the unsuspecting in the privacy of their own homes, steal the underwear of classmates, engage in a perpetual Quest for Sex, etc.

At best, these nerds will be depicted as a Chivalrous Pervert. Sure, they may think about sex constantly, but that doesn't mean they lack morals or boundaries or will force their desires onto others. Or they'll be shown as a Covert Pervert: nerdy Shrinking Violets or The Quiet Ones who nonetheless have a hidden perverted side that is only revealed to the audience and other characters every now and then, often by them Nosebleeding (and other actions to indicate horniness) in the background.

Less favorable depictions will be like the Casanova Wannabe, constantly trying and failing to sleep with people. These characters seem to be either unaware of or simply not concerned by their own nerdiness. Or they're more like the Lovable Sex Maniac, whose behavior towards others toes the line between acceptable and predatory, but is treated In-Universe as ultimately harmless. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

But when a work isn't going for a sympathetic portrayal, nerdy characters will have an interest in sex bordering on the depraved. They'll masturbate to the worst horrors Rule 34 has produced involving just about every fetish known to man, lecherously stalk and predate on the uninterested objects of their affection, put explicit Candids for Sale, attempt to trick or coerce girls into sex or just zapping them with The Nudifier in public, or have a Perverse Sexual Lust that crosses over into full-blown delusion. Many in this category are Extreme Omnisexuals or Depraved Bisexuals, having few limits as to who (or what) helps get them off and willing to do the unthinkable _to_ get off. The Basement-Dweller and Otaku of all stripes are the most susceptible to this portrayal. Loners Are Freaks and Fetishes Are Weird go hand-in-hand with this version. Closely related and on a slightly more positive note is Brains and Bondage, since many nerds are genuinely intelligent. However, this can veer very quickly into Bondage Is Bad and Unsexy Sadist.

A trait of many Stereotypical Nerds and very prevalent in the teen Sex Comedy genre. Hormone-Addled Teenager tends to overlap, but there are plenty of adults depicted in this way and often the more critical and negative portrayals are of adults. Horny Scientist is very closely related and will often overlap. Male nerds are far more likely to be coded as perverted than female nerds as A Man Is Always Eager and All Men Are Perverts. But when a female nerd is shown to be a perv, there's often a high chance she's a Yaoi Fangirl and/or just loves to write fanfic.

As always, being that this is a sex trope, No Real Life Examples, Please!

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Don't Toy with Me, Miss Nagatoro_: The popular, athletic Nagatoro clearly has this stereotype in mind when she constantly harps on her shy, geeky Senpai for his love of fanservice manga and his painting skills, on top of offering to model nude for one of his pieces. Senpai himself is no more perverted than any other boy his age, but the author confirmed that the reason he doesn't push Nagatoro away is because he is a closet masochist.
-   _Hidoku Shinaide_: In reality, Stereotypical Nerd Nemugasa is an example of Nerds Are Naïve given his initial complete naivete and lack of experience with sex and dating and overall gullibleness. In a side chapter, though, that doesn't stop a horned up Maya from thinking to himself after some intimate time between them, "So it's true what people say about the smart ones being perverted," alluding to this stereotype.
-   _Midori Days_: At a convention, Seiji sells hand puppets of Midori, the miniature teenage girl his right hand has become. Two nerdy customers take one and start taking its clothes off, leading to Seiji beating the crap out of both of them.
-   _Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation_: In his previous life, Rudeus Grayrat was a Brilliant, but Lazy Otaku, later Neet and Hikikomori, who leeched off of his parents for ten years after being bullied at school. After his parents die, his brothers kick him out after they find him masturbating over porn instead of attending their funeral or showing any remorse for their death. He still retains a lot of his perverted qualities after he's reincarnated in another world, but he grows out of his worst qualities, becoming a Lovable Sex Maniac and later a Chivalrous Pervert, only perving on his three wives.
-   _No Matter How I Look at It, It's You Guys' Fault I'm Not Popular!_: Tomoko is a Creepy Loner Girl, Romance Game Otaku who decides she wants to become popular in her first year of high school. Problem is, she has No Social Skills and is both a self-centered Jerkass and a Covert Pervert from playing so many H-Games. Her reason for wanting to become popular? To lose her virginity. She's also constantly groping her friend Yuu out of misplaced jealousy over her larger bust. When she finally does make friends, though, they tolerate her perviness and treat her as a Lovable Sex Maniac.
-   In _Paranoia Agent_, the first client we see call girl Maria with is a gonky otaku who beds her in a room full of anime figurines. On coming, he blows her off to talk to them about how much they helped him "get there."

    Comic Strips 

-   _FoxTrot_: Nerdy characters Jason and Marcus are both source(s) of the strip's science and Nerd culture Shout-Out humour. A few early strips have some punchline(s) where this trope is in play:
    -   One strip in a story arc depicting the Fox family getting internet has Andy comment about all the things the kids can learn. Cut to Jason and Marcus looking at the computer, where Jason comments that "Ms. October sure has big hooters!" and Marcus pondering if that might affect the download speed.
    -   Another comic strip depicts Jason and Marcus stargazing. Jason adjusts the telescope so he can view other celestial bodies...then tilts it so he can see a couple making out with a smile on his face.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _American Pie_: The film's a high school Sex Comedy about a group of friends on a Quest for Sex to fulfill their destiny as men to lose their virginities before college, so all of the main characters are Hormone Addled Teenagers trying to get laid. But for this trope:
    -   Protagonist Jim is Jewish and Nerdy, turns into an awkward, silent mess around girls he's interested in, boasts about his high SAT scores at a party, and opens the film (after the Cold Open where he's Caught With His Pants Down) discussing how hot Ariel from _The Little Mermaid_ is. He also infamously "has sex" with an apple pie after he asks his friends what third base feels like and one replies, "like warm apple pie."
    -   Chuck Sherman, so nerdy that the idea of him getting laid before Jim and his friends is the motivation behind their Quest for Sex, is a Casanova Wannabe who has been spreading lies that he slept with a girl at Stifler's party, and many others. When she gets wind of this, she publicly exposes him at prom, revealing he's not only a virgin, but he also once tried to have sex with a grapefruit.
    -   Michelle, the band geek that Jim eventually takes to prom who goes on and on about inane stories of her time at band camp, reveals herself to be a sexually dominant super freak, who shares how she used her own flute to masturbate in an infamous Wham Line and only agreed to be Jim's prom date because she knew he'd be an easy lay. In fact, according to her, _all_ band geeks are sex-obsessed Covert Perverts who use band camp as a place to hook up with each other. She gets flanderized in the sequels, in which she becomes a full-blown Dominatrix.
-   In _Back to the Future_, the young, nerdy George McFly climbs a tree to spy on Lorraine changing in a window.
-   _Revenge of the Nerds_: The members of the all-nerd frat at war with the jocks from the other frats are all sex-obsessed. They place spy cams in all of the bedrooms and showers at the sororities and spend hours watching the girls sleep. Lewis even commits Rape by Fraud, pretending to be head cheerleader Betty's boyfriend while wearing a mask to have sex with her. As the protagonists of a teen sex comedy though, they're portrayed as nothing worse than Lovable Sex Maniacs, and even Betty allows Lewis to continue after finding out about the Bed Trick because he's so good in bed.
-   _Superbad_: Geeky high school outcasts Seth, Evan, and Fogell are obsessed with getting laid before they graduate high school and leave for college. In the very first scene, Seth and Evan have a discussion about what pornography website he's planning on subscribing to.
-   _Weird Science_: The film is a Wish-Fulfillment story about Gary and Wyatt, two socially awkward nerds who are so desperate for romantic and sexual female attention, they decide to build a simulation of their perfect woman, Lisa, that ends up coming to life due to a freak thunderstorm. Their main priorities are her physical specs and they raid Wyatt's Porn Stash for material to base her off of. They also take advantage of Lisa being an Innocent Fanservice Girl to shower with her: them, clothes on, her, completely nude.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Big Bang Theory_:
    -   Howard Wolowitz, pre-Character Development, is a lecherous twerp who starts hitting on every pretty girl, most often Penny the moment that he meets them. He has been known to have masturbatory fantasies involving Katee Sackhoff, and was caught by his Love Interest Bernadette having online sex with "Glucinda the Troll", causing a temporary break-up between the two.
    -   Amy Farrah Fowler also qualifies. When Penny pays her a compliment while chaperoning an early date between Sheldon and Amy, Amy asks if Penny is a lesbian, then notes that she'd have been more flattered if that was the case. When doing research on slumber parties on her smartphone, she notes that girls engage in "harmless experimentation in lesbianism", and attempts to put this into practice with Penny, while Bernadette says she would have just stuck to eating raw cookie dough. And lest anyone think that this behavior extends solely to Penny, when Sheldon catches Amy faking sick to get attention from him, she suggests (with barely contained enthusiasm) that he spank her.
-   _Seinfeld_: George Constanza is a short, balding, Pathetically Weak man with nerdy hobbies—he claims his greatest life achievement is getting the high score on a local _Frogger_ machine. He's also _constantly_ scheming to have sex. In one episode, a period of forced abstinence inadvertently turns him into a genius: he's able to perfectly hit home runs by describing the geometry and physics involved and becomes fluent in Portuguese simply by hearing other people speaking it. Jerry determines that since the majority of George's brainpower goes toward getting laid, not being able to do so has forced that brainpower to spend its energies elsewhere. Of course, by the end of the episode, George finally has sex and becomes an idiotic nerd again.

    Theatre 

-   In _Avenue Q,_ Trekkie Monster has only one thing on his mind: internet porn. He even has an entire song about how great the internet is...for finding porn. His nerdiness is implied by his name, which is a deliberate Shout-Out to _Star Trek_, as Trekkie Monster was originally supposed to be a Trekkie, until copyright concerns led the creators to remove all traces of the franchise, save for the name.
-   _Be More Chill_: Jeremy is an anxious video-game-playing nerdy "loser," made clear by his Establishing Character Moment: he's almost late for school because his online porn won't load, leaving him "uncomfortable" all day. One of the first things his SQUIP (a supercomputer in the form of a pill that enters one's brain) does is punish him for masturbating, instead trying to get him to hook up with a popular girl.
-   _Heathers_: In "Beautiful", while all the other kids are fawning over the Heathers and what it would be like to be noticed by them, the Beleaguered Geek says, "I'd like to kidnap a Heather and photograph her naked in an abandoned warehouse and leave her tied up for the rats."

    Video Games 

-   _Bully_: Earnest Jones is a parody of Lewis Sholnick from _Revenge of the Nerds._ Earnest is obsessed with getting revenge on the Jocks for bullying him and his clique and seducing the girls of Bullworth. In "Paparazzi", he convinces Jimmy to take scandalous pictures of the head cheerleader, Mandy Wiles, to rile up the jocks but it's soon revealed that he only wanted the pictures for his personal pleasure. The following missions "Defender of the Castle" and "Discretion Assured" show that the nerds have posted them across Bullworth as revenge porn, inciting the jocks to assault the observatory out of disgust for what the nerds did and Jimmy atoning for what he did by taking down the pictures.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles 2_: Tora (as well as his father and grandfather) is a Gadgeteer Genius, a Driver Fanboy, and The Smart Guy of the main cast, who is passionate about creating an artificial blade, Poppi. Prior to the story, he became The Shut-In out of fear of the people who killed his granddad and to focus on his work, causing him to have No Social Skills. Tora shows a very clear fetish for maids (that he tries to hide), which heavily influences the design and functions of Poppi: he has several maid outfits for Poppi and has programmed some... questionable fanservicey functions into the blade. Poppi QT and Poppi QTπ even take the respective forms of a maid girl and a riff on the Stripperiffic Pyra & Mythra. Considering that the artificial blades his dad and grandfather created _also_ have some maid motifs, the fetish appears to run in the family.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney_: Sal Manella, the director of _The Steel Samurai,_ is a sweaty otaku who speaks in Leet Lingo and meme references. He's also disgustingly lustful, literally drooling over the teenage Maya and having a Power Dynamics Kink for his abusive producer, Dee Vasquez. This apparently works its way into his shows at time, as the studio turned down some of his scripts as "not appropriate for children."

    Webcomics 

-   _El Goonish Shive_: Tedd Verres is a bespectacled Asian and Nerdy Mad Scientist who has a huge transformation kink (helped by his working Transformation Ray) and proudly calls himself a pervert. But Character Development through his love interest Grace eventually makes him only pervy towards her and no one else (which she is perfectly okay with).
-   An early _Something\*Positive_ strip has PeeJee innocently wandering into a game store where the resident nerds immediately start picturing her naked. Cut to her washing and washing, unable to get the feeling of creepiness off her skin.
-   _Spacetrawler_ uses and lampshades the "nerds have bizarre and exotic fetishes" aspect of the trope through Yuri, the Japanese super-geek and budding transhumanist in the first series. When Dmitri puts his moves on all the women of the _I.A. Starbanger_, Yuri is the only one who agrees to sleep with him — though she almost turns him down, concerned that his sexual tastes might not be adventurous enough. For reference, Dmitri would later go on to bed every female alien with 50% or greater compatibility, and Yuri still manages to make _him_ reach for the Brain Bleach.
    
    **Yuri:** Listen, Dmitri, I've slept with quite a few geeks, and some were real freaks in bed. I'm not just talking costumes and ropes, I'm talking inflatable Pikachu. After all that, I'm not sure you have much to offer.  
    **Dmitri:** How about this... _\[whispers in Yuri's ear\]_  
    **Yuri:** Better than I expected, but not great.  
    **Dmitri:** Like you could do better. _\[Yuri whispers in his ear\]_ **HOLY FUCKING CHRIST ICK GOD, EAUUGHHH!**
    

    Web Original 

-   _Jõtaider_: Despite his many good qualities, the story doesn't hide the fact that stereotypical nerd Tsubasa Sato has certain feelings going through his body when coming across some of the corrupted Jõtaijin. He usually channels his perverted thoughts into his writing.

    Western Animation 

-   _American Dad!_: Steve Smith is a glasses-wearing dweeb who's often a disappointment to his CIA agent dad Stan and the biggest loser in school. Depending on the Writer, he's either a harmless, socially awkward kid who is seen by some girls as Endearingly Dorky, or a Hormone-Addled Teenager and Casanova Wannabe, who is always trying to hit on some of his female classmates, much to their displeasure.
-   _Big Mouth_: Andrew Glouberman is a Jewish and Nerdy Hormone-Addled Preteen who jerks off almost all the time, especially in places that are inappropriate to do so (like in front of his dead grandpa's open casket).
-   _Danny Phantom_: Tucker is a Casanova Wannabe and Pathetically Weak technogeek who uses his knowledge to spy on girls.
-   _Total Drama_:
    -   Cody is a short geek who thinks his interest in physics makes him "cool." He puts on airs of confidence to hit on girls, particularly Gwen — he even makes a bet with Owen to get Gwen's bra. He gets ignored at worst and beaten up at best, with the exception of his own Abhorrent Admirer, Sierra.
    -   Harold is a spindly nerd with gross habits and a socially awkward demeanor. He's implied to be a Covert Pervert after it's discovered he wrote a series of "spicy" haikus to Leshawna. In the second and third seasons, this trait becomes more pronounced as he frequently talks about how he assumes several girls are attracted to him. He particularly loves Leshawna's figure (emphasizing her round behind), but Leshawna is less sure about her feelings for Harold.
        
        **Harold:** _\[upon seeing Heather's accidentally-exposed breasts\]_ Boobies...
        
    -   Sierra is a stereotypical Fangirl, obsessed with the Internet without having any friends in real life. She is also incredibly attracted to Cody, to the point of stealing his underwear, using his toothbrush, smelling his shoes, and even forcibly kissing him at one point. This is made worse by the fact she has No Social Skills and seems unable to comprehend that he's not into her.
