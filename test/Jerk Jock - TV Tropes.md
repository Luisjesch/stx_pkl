_"In 80s teen movies, if a character is sporting a letter jacket, it might as well be the letter swastika, because he is going to be committing crimes against humanity."_

See that tall, hunky and vulgar blond guy in the football letterman jacket picking on the nerd over there? What's his name, Dick? Bill? Kyle? Tyler? One of those? That's him. One in every school.

The Spear Counterpart to the Alpha Bitch (and sometimes the Cruel Cheerleader), the Jerk Jock is the Chief Bully who dominates the school/college environment through physical violence and threats of brutal retaliation. A boorish, obnoxious, spiteful asshole with an out-of-control sense of entitlement, he spends his time beating people up, getting drunk and destroying property; and in darker works, he may also be an incorrigible rapist.

Of course, most of that doesn't matter to the student body. Oftentimes, the Jerk Jock is the reigning king of the campus, with many people wanting to be his friend or his date, or at least be on his good side (although if his family is rich then he might have paid them to do so). His bullying ways don't make him a pariah, but a prince, because as everyone in High School knows, anyone who's popular is a bully.

Just as the Alpha Bitch has a Girl Posse, the Jerk Jock has the Gang of Bullies, a crowd of hangers-on who bow to his every whim and help him victimize whomever he decides to pick on. And he inevitably decides that Our Heroes are his favorite targets.

One of the Jerk Jock's favorite targets is the Non-Action Guy, who is either not good at sports, or is simply not interested in sports, because he's more "artistically cultured" than other boys. The Jerk Jock loves to pick on the Non-Action Guy because of his apparent "lack of masculinity", and because the Jerk Jock sees artistic activities as "feminine" or "unmasculine". Often, a Lovable Jock (Passionate Sports Girl if female) will protect the Non-Action Guy from the Jerk Jock.

Like the Alpha Bitch, the Jerk Jock is surprisingly popular despite (or even because of) his repellent personality, especially with the school's staff and most adults, and can get away with most anything. Chances are he's extremely necessary for a high school/college to compete against rivals lest they be wiped out into obscurity. Or, in the similar vein to the Alpha Bitch: politics and cold hard cash.

However, where the Alpha Bitch uses her wiles and sex-appeal to get what she wants, the Jerk Jock usually isn't very smart and is more likely to fall back on fear of violent reprisal instead. Usually, violence is not an option to deal with him, unless The Hero or somebody on their side (likely The Big Guy) is indeed physically stronger than him. Other than that, manipulating him to his doom often proves to be the most effective way to deal with him, since he's seldom bright enough to see through intrigues; the fear of public humiliation, loss of status, or his parents discovering his ways is often sufficient to keep him at bay. That or a Jerkass Realization.

In shows focusing entirely on school life, he'll be a primary antagonist; however, if the school environment is merely a setting and not the key focus he's more likely to be just a recurring nuisance for the characters to deal with, or a Villain of the Week. In shows dealing with the fantastic, he can often be found Mugging the Monster, or portrayed as stupid enough to bully someone even if he knows that they have powers that could reduce him to a smear on the wall. In a Slasher Movie, chances are _very, very_ good that he is going to die, winding up an Asshole Victim. In Professional Wrestling, he's the default archetype for a Heel.

Whilst it's not as common to get a sympathetic side to the Jerk Jock as with the Alpha Bitch, you'll sometimes get a softer version who isn't evil so much as an arrogant, self-absorbed Jerk with a Heart of Gold who doesn't really know any better. This version is much more likely to end up petting the dog, and may reveal his sensitive side in an Enemy Mine. He may also mend his ways and join the hero's side. And even while still a villain, the Jerk Jock can garner sympathy if he's given a Freudian Excuse (with having a "Well Done, Son" Guy as a father or an outright abusive family being the most common).

Unfortunately, this trope tends to be somewhat a Truth in Television, and very much prevalent in team sports. The reason is diffusion of responsibility: team sports encourage tribal mentality, loyalty to one's own tribe (team), hostility to other tribes (other teams), and complete indifference towards outsiders. The tribal mentality dilutes the responsibility of one's behavior and manners, and even in some instances encourages uppity and obnoxious behavior. Schools that have particular reputations for a specific sports program may even grant special privileges to star players (and sometimes even cover up bad behavior to prevent the team's reputation from suffering). _Rarely_ do practitioners of _individual_ sports fall into such a category, and are more often a Badass Bookworm or Genius Bruiser type. Jerk Jock behavior is _seriously_ discouraged in Real Life martial arts, on pain of outright expulsion from the sport, let alone the violator's school.

See Schoolyard Bully All Grown Up and Kids Are Cruel. Compare to, and sometimes may even overlap with, Big Man on Campus, who usually matches the Jerk Jock in popularity, but is less of an antagonistic force. Also compare Dumb Jock. Little relation to Violent Glaswegian. In some settings, an Opposing Sports Team is a team of Jerk Jocks usually who are antagonistic to their rival teams.

Note if a character is a bully, but isn't depicted as a Sports player or a rich boy with Good publicity, then they're probably just a Barbaric Bully. However if thuggish, and Obviously Evil enough, some Jerk Jock characters can qualify as a Barbaric Bully as well.

Contrast with Lovable Jock. Originally Lovable Jock was the normal portrayal while Jerk Jock was a reversal, but nowadays the Jerk Jock tends to be more populous in fiction than Lovable Jock characters. Female Jerk Jocks are not unheard of, either.

Incidentally, the Ur-Example is most likely the Greek god Ares, who represented bloodlust and the evils of war. He forms a couple with the Alpha Bitch Aphrodite, goddess of beauty and lust.

## Examples

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the _Marmalade Boy_ anime, Michael Grant's older brother Brian is a basketball genius who started out as a Jerk Jock with a horrible temper, a Stalker with a Crush\-level love for Jinny Golding and a big competitive streak. When Yuu beats him at his game, though, he admits his defeat and becomes Yuu's friend.
-   Subverted in _Slam Dunk_. At the beginning, Takenori Akagi is a bit of a jerk jock, but this stems more out of his own stoic tendencies augmented by his backstory as a player with mere potential who practically _taught himself to play_ but lacked support, except from Kogure and Anzai and later his underclassmen than real jockiness. Once Sakuragi fully joins, Akagi is shown more as the Team Dad and Big Brother Mentor.
    -   Played straight with the Toyotama High team, whose members are arrogant, rude and prone to commit fouls without getting caught by the referee. The most notable examples are Itakura, who spends the whole match mocking Miyagi for his height, and Minami, who's been nicknamed "Ace Killer" since he injured Fujima of Shoyo in the past tournament by elbowing him in the eye, which he did later to Rukawa.
-   _Kuroko's Basketball_:
    -   The Generation of Miracles are this to some degree. While they aren't bullies, they are _very_ arrogant and often look down on their opponents, with Aomine being the one whose personality fits this trope the most. Kise is pretty much the exception since he's the least jerkish towards people and he started to become a Lovable Jock earlier than the rest.
    -   Team Kirisaki Daiichi's specialty is injuring their opponents without the referee noticing the act. Their team leader (and coach) Hanamura in particular loves to ruin the effort of other teams and he views destroying said effort as a form of art.
    -   Haizaki is a Jerkass who has no respect for anybody, including his teammates, is violent even off-court and he loves to ruin his opponent's play.
    -   Team Jabberwock are this trope taking to the extreme. They are all racist American streetballers who tell everyone in Japan on live television to quit playing basketball because they are "monkeys". They are also prone to violence even off-court and they love to humiliate their opponents which goes beyond normal streetball taunting.
-   _Dragon Ball Z_ has minor character Sharpner from the Buu saga. A classic muscular Jerk Jock from Gohan and Videl's high school who bullies Gohan for his shy nerdiness calling him "brain boy" blissfully unaware that Gohan is a half-alien powerhouse who can destroy the entire planet. Like the rest of his classmates, Sharpner is shocked when Gohan easily catches his home run by jumping 25 feet into the air to catch the ball and even more shocked when Gohan (who decides to play it "normal") tanks Sharpner's baseball getting thrown into his face at high speed so that he'll be out. The anime makes Sharpner jerkier as he gets jealous of Videl's relationship with Great Saiyaman and tries to unmask Gohan only to fail spectacularly. Subverted though as he cheers for Gohan when the latter forgets his disguise and is shown giving energy to Mr Satan (actually Goku) to destroy Buu in the finale implying he's a more likable jock than it first seemed.
-   _Eyeshield 21_:
    -   Agon isn't just a jerk, he's a borderline _sociopath_. He's also extremely selfish, egotistical, yet brilliant and he finds the concept of hard work itself utterly baffling; for him, getting into the NFL would be a nightmare, because, as he says, then it would be _work_. It doesn't help that he has incredible talent for anything he does.
    -   Clifford from the American Youth Cup team plays this trope a little closer to its roots, if not to the level that Agon does. He's certainly arrogant enough, and constantly downplays the talent of his teammates in favor of aggrandizing his own ability and accomplishments.
    -   Donald Oberman, meanwhile, takes the "rich dad who bails him out" part to new heights; His father is the _president of the United States._
    -   Inverted with the Ha-Ha brothers, who stopped being bullies when they redirected their aggression into football.
    -   The Yuuhi Guts aren't a very good team, but their school excels in every other sport. Hoping to raise their chances of winning, the school's principal substitutes players from the successful sports teams for the regular football team. The substitute players are depicted as nasty bad guys in the anime; in the manga they're just regular guys, if selfish because they're only playing for extra credit.
    -   Subverted by the Kyoshin Poseidons' Kengo Mizumachi. He _seems_ like a Jerk Jock at first, but as we see more of him it becomes apparent that he's just a naturally talented Spirited Competitor with No Social Skills. By the end of the Devil Bats' match against the Poseidons, he comes off as a dorky-cute Worthy Opponent. He even winds up on the same college team as the hero, in the Distant Finale.
-   Sasabe from _The Prince of Tennis_. Keigo Atobe and the Rikkaidai players seem at first to be like this too, but thankfully they get some more Character Development.
-   _My Hero Academia_ has the Hot-Blooded school prodigy Katsuki Bakugo who at the start viscously bullies the shyer, nerdier and initially quirkless protagonist Izuku Midoriya and in a real douchebag moment even tells Midoriya to kill himself. However due to Midoriya Taking a Level in Badass Bakugo soon becomes Midoriya's Friendly Rivalry and over time even Bash Brothers with him even if Bakugo is still too jerky for his own good. Also unlike what you expect from this trope Bakugo is actually quite academic having the third best grades in his class, even if his emotional immaturity has gotten the better of him frequently. In chapter 322 Bakugo does _finally_ apologize to Midoriya for his douchery, albeit long after the fact.
-   Jun Manjoume, The Hero's main rival on _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_, was shaping up to be this, or at least a Japanese Draco Malfoy, in the first half of the first season; fortunately, a Journey to Find Oneself and Character Development intervened. Fitting for this trope, the 4Kids Entertainment English dub named him Chazz Princeton.
-   In the original _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ "Bandit" Keith Howard, Insector Haga, Dinosaur Ryuuzaki, and Seto Kaiba are what happens when this character type decides to play card games instead of rule the school.
-   Will from _Heroman_, makes sense since he's an Expy of Flash Thompson from _Spider-Man_.
-   Hanagaza Mamoru from _Hell Girl_. To the point of sabotaging his own baseball team to "save his abilities" for the major leagues. Oh and also to the point of killing one of his fellow classmates, and inculpating his friend. Succeeded in both barring the fact that he was sent to hell for it.
-   In _Arata: The Legend_, Masato Kadowaki is a fellow member of Hinohara's track team who becomes a Jerk Jock toward Hinohara after he lets them tie in a track meet, which Kadowaki calls him out on. He proceeds to ruthlessly bully Hinohara short afterward.
-   Pretty much in all manhwas by Hwang Ri Mi, this type of character occurs.
-   Isaac in _Space☆Dandy_, who also likes to sing. That being said, most of his actions are because he'll do whatever Alpha Bitch Sofia tells him to do.
-   In _Doraemon_, Gian is the captain of the local baseball team, and usually very rude and abusive to his teammates, especially Nobita. Although he somewhat borders along this and Lovable Jock.
-   _Captain Tsubasa_ does have a fair share of these, although most (if not all) end up falling to Defeat Means Friendship at Tsubasa's hands and become much nicer later on.
    -   Genzo Wakabayashi had become rather full of himself when he helped the Shutetsu win the nationals without conceding a single goal. When Tsubasa scored a goal on him he almost had a breakdown, until his personal coach Mikami slapped him for abandoning his teammates when the match hadn't ended yet. The match ends in a tie, but he and Tsubasa quickly become friends (and later teammates) afterwards.
    -   Kojiro Hyuga is rather aggressive and violent to both teammates and rivals alike, and is as far from a team player as one could be. However, this is mostly rooted on the fact that he wants to secure a professional contract to help his family, after his father died in an accident and he found himself having to split his time between training and part-time jobs to support his mother and younger siblings. Like Genzo, he mellows a bit after losing to Tsubasa, developing a Friendly Rivalry with him and eventually becoming teammates as part of Japan's National Team.

    Comic Books 

-   _Spider-Man_: Eugene "Flash" Thompson, one of Spider-Man's foils. He bullies Peter Parker constantly, but is a big fan of Spider-Man, not knowing they're the same person. In a subversion, the comics have him and Peter actually becoming friends after they graduate from high school. He isn't without his bad sides; When he was framed for being the Hobgoblin, everybody believed it immediately.
    -   At least until a car accident gave him amnesia all the way back to college, erasing the past 10-20 years or so from his memory (Comic-Book Time).
    -   Flash's evolution may have come with his military service after he graduated from high school. When he comes back to the U.S. after his tour of duty is over, he's a lot more circumspect and mature than the arrogant prick he was at the start of the series. This is partly represented by his sincere and heartfelt apology to Peter for all the crap that he put him through during high school.
    -   More lately, he became an Ensemble Dark Horse and gets to be the _4th_ Venom, and he's touted as a through and through _superhero_, in spite of his evil jock past and the symbiote's usual villain status, meaning that he manages to make Character Development stick.
    -   In the _Ultimate_ universe, Peter does try to defend himself from Flash after he gets his powers. He winds up accidentally breaking Flash's hand, and the jerk's parents sue Aunt May and Uncle Ben for the medical costs.
        -   In the Ultimate universe, much of the character development Flash would later go through in the regular continuity is instead given to Kong, one of his friends and a fellow Jerk Jock who also picked on Peter Parker... until he, a fan of Spider-Man, came to the (independently-reached) realization that Peter and Spider-Man were one and the same. Over the course of the series, he eventually mended bridges with Peter and became friendly with him, and seemed to break with Flash entirely.
        -   A major theme in the _Ultimate Spider-Man_ title is that bad people often aren't seen as bad by society itself and that lets them step on people to get what they want. After Gwen Stacy dies, when Kong tries to claim that Flash isn't that bad of a person, Peter gives a long "The Reason You Suck" Speech about why Flash is ultimately the high school equivalent of this. His position on the football team lets him get away with bullying and be rewarded for acting like a jerk to people who "don't matter" in his eyes, and he when he grows up he'll continue to behave this way thanks to being coddled and indulged. As mentioned, Flash in this series is much more of a dick and his Pet the Dog moments are extremely rare.
    -   In _Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane_, Flash is one of M.J.'s best friends. In that series, he's depicted in a more sympathetic light, as he's also frequently belittled and demeaned by his Alpha Bitch\-ish girlfriend Liz and nurses a crush on MJ herself. Whilst the other members of the football team are also Jerk Jocks to an extent, and some even _bigger_ ones than Flash (at one point even planning to ruin a drama club performance that MJ was starring in because it happened to be scheduled at the same time as one of their games, until Flash persuaded them not too), MJ and his other best friends are quick to call Flash out on his being a jerk, especially to Peter.

-   Steve Lombard, in the _Superman_ comics, is sort of a grown-up one of these. A former pro-athlete himself, he's the sports writer for the Daily Planet, and enjoys picking on clumsy, bespectacled reporter Clark Kent.
    -   Though Steve has had his fair share of Pet the Dog moments, like in _All-Star Superman_ where after Clark collapses, handing in his final story before his death, Steve is the first to call for medics and check for a pulse.
-   Reggie Mantle from Archie Comics, the eponymous character's greatest foil and rival. He is arguably Riverdale High's top all-around athlete and an egomaniacal Jerkass who amuses himself by playing practical jokes on enemies and frenemies alike.
-   Lance from the comic book _The Invincible Ed_ is a rare case of a Jerk Jock who actually has brains — which makes him scarier.
-   Sort of applies to Roark Junior/Yellow Bastard from the _Sin City_ story "That Yellow Bastard," who, while not particularly athletic, certainly believed he had the right to rape anybody he felt like, and was protected by his U.S. Senator daddy. "I can do whatever I want, whenever I want, however I want it!" A particularly messy death really was the only way to deal with him, as getting shot in the groin by the Anti-Hero didn't make him change his ways one iota.
-   In the Silver Age Superboy comics, Clark had to put up with Smallville High's resident top jock (and jerk) Bash Bashford. Somewhat ironically, post-crisis continuity has Clark as a star athlete throughout high school instead, while in other stories he would be picked on by Kenny Braverman, who grows up to be the supervillain Conduit.
-   _The Intimates_ inverts this: The Duke, a big kid with a costume modeled after a football player's uniform, is soft-spoken, awkward, and nervous. Scrawny Punchy, meanwhile, is an egocentric alpha male, always insulting Duke and bossing him around.
-   Cal King in _Robyn Hood_, whose actions go past mere bullying to outright criminality (which he can get away with because his father owns the town).
-   Parodied in _Adventure Time: Ice King_, in which Bob is actually an erudite type, but was forced into playing this role because his delinquent gang needed a member who was The Brute.
-   In _Robin_ Tim has a classmate he privately refers to as "Varsity Jerk" who is arrogant and incredibly rude.
-   _Dynamo5_ Averted. While Gage shows signs of this in the first issue, he's actually a nice enough guy, and is the first of the five siblings to start bonding with another, namely Hector, the geeky one in the group. In issue 2, they talk about girls while doing surveillance, and later Gage is very supportive of Hector's performance in the fight against Whiptail.
-   _Twisted Dark_: The story "The Experiment" features a trio of jocks, one of whom pushes Mark and makes him spill his juice box on his pants so he looks like he peed himself, causing everyone in the hallway to laugh at him. Mark got back at him by training a bunch of birds to descend on the football field when they hear a whistle, causing the game to be attacked.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Funky Winkerbean_:
    -   In the classic era (pre-1992), Bull Bushka was this in spades, especially to his main target, Les Moore. Late in their high school years, they became friends. Bull has since mellowed – he would reveal years later he was abused as a child – and although he is still Bull in many ways he is one of Les' closest friends.
    -   Conversely, several one-time and bit characters fit the trope fully, including Matt Moore, the star quarterback who — when dating an unpopular girl named Susan Smith — abused her; and a star running back whom Bull kicked off the team (ironically, for bullying... when the bully's actions are recorded on one of victim's friend's iPhones).

    Fan Works 

-   The _Battle Royale_ based 72 Hours has the wrestling club, all of whom except one are horrifically brutal sadists who take great pleasure from torturing and murdering their way through the Program. As flashbacks prove, their head, Joel, has been leading them in such crimes as armed robbery before the Program as well. They're all 17.
-   In _The Loud House_ fanfiction _A Load of Bulk_, Lana drinks a potion that makes her stronger and beefier, gives her a preoccupation with exercising, and makes her mean, insulting her siblings and bragging about her strength.
-   There's a High School AU Channel Awesome fanfic that features a group of homophobic jocks who are all promptly murdered by Phelous and The Cinema Snob.
-   The whole point of the _RWBY_ fanfic Redemption is deconstructing this trope and making the Jerk Jock team of CRDL more sympathetic and likable.

    Films — Animation 

-   Lancelot in _Shrek the Third_, who's captain of the jousting team and torments the short, scrawny Arthur.

-   Bradley Uppercrust III from _An Extremely Goofy Movie_, though a much smaller, weaselier and less intimidating example than usual, who decided to offer Max to be on his extreme sports team while passive-aggressively insulting Acrofatic PJ and Bunny-Ears Lawyer Bobby for vague and likely shallow reasons. Cue the True Companions making him into their Privileged Rival. Then later he drafts Max's own father, Goofy, to the team, and is later revealed to be a dirty cheater. By the end of the movie he has attempted to severely injure or kill no fewer than two people in the name of winning in addition to callously leaving his own right-hand man to die, who by the way was a much straighter example.
-   Scowler from _Walking with Dinosaurs: The Movie_. He often picks on his younger brother Patchi because of their size differences. But when he gets older and becomes the leader of the herd, he gets worse.

-   In _Turning Red_, Tyler dresses like a stereotypical one, complete with a sweatband, and his Establishing Character Moment shows him playing basketball. He is frequently antagonistic and insulting towards Mei.
-   _NIMONA (2023)_: Sir Thoddeus is an arrogant, slowwitted knight who acts like a stereotypical fraternity member who’s better than everyone else even though Ballister, the target of his ire, is the top of their class at the Institute.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The Absent-Minded Professor:_ The ridiculously tall Rutland basketball players are quite petty, as shown when they go out of their way to smugly hold the basketballs just out of the Medfield players' reach and condescendingly pat their heads.
-   The Raimi _Spider-Man Trilogy_ movies make Flash downright irredeemable (although he does only appear for about ten minutes early in the first movie, when he's still in his 'bullying dick' phase, which doesn't help). It's curious how the image of him as Jerk Jock still sticks seeing as how he only fits the trope in less than 15% of his total appearances.

-   The entire football team in _The Rage: Carrie 2_, which rates girls according to their hotness and then scores points with each other by sleeping with them. Sadly, this was based on something that actually happened (the "Spur Posse").
-   Ben Affleck's first major role, on Dazed and Confused, was as Fred O'Bannion, a Jerk Jock who repeated senior year just so he can brutally haze the freshmen once again.
    -   Subverted with star quarterback Randy "Pink" Floyd who is nice to all the factions in school.
        -   His teammate Don Dawson both subverts and affirms. While generally presented as a nice guy, in one scene he terrifies a nerdy student just for laughs. The student's scared reaction shows it is something to be expected from Don.
-   Bo from _Cursed (2005)_ is the captain of the wrestling team, who constantly goes out of the way to harass the nerdy protagonist, Jimmy. It is revealed later that he's actually gay and likes Jimmy, he just was overcompensating by acting macho so that no one else would find out.

-   John Cusack vehicle _Better Off Dead_ has the captain of the high school ski squad (the only one to survive the dreaded K-12), who steals Cusack's girl, denies him a spot on the squad despite a qualifying try-out, is rude to the foreign French student that's crushing on Cusack... His name? Roy Stalin, best Jerk Jock name _ever_.

-   Inverted in _Grease_, where the jocks are the 'nice but dumb' guys.

-   _I Am Number Four_: Mark James, the local Jerk Sue who gets away with assault, kidnapping, breaking into people's lockers and planting paint bombs in them, stalking his ex, has the NERVE to tell her that she's the problem, and gets away scot-free from everything because the plot says so.
-   The character of Tommy from _Dude, Where's My Car?_ is not very bright, hangs out with a group of muscle head friends, and it seems that even his girlfriend Kristy can't stand him. At the end of the movie a giantess devours him alive while Kristy is shown to be rather indifferent to her loss.
-   The main characters of _Watch It_ are grown-up versions of this trope, particularly Michael and Rick (Danny is more of a Lovable Rogue), though Rick eventually gets better.
-   _Thunderstruck_ features first Conner as the Jerk Jock, then the protagonist (although largely in terms of letting the fame go to his head and forgetting his former friends).
-   _X-Men Film Series_:
    -   _X-Men: First Class_: Havok is a downplayed example because he's not as bad as this trope normally is, but he's verbally abusive towards the geeky Hank McCoy, and Alex Summers also fits the blond stereotype.
    -   _X-Men: Apocalypse_: Scott is bullied by one who threatens to kick his ass for winking at the guy's girlfriend.
-   In _The Brass Teapot_ Arnie the Landlord is this, to an almost absurd degree. He's an absolute asshole every second he's on-screen and he even fits to physical description of this trope to a t: tall, muscular, vulgar, blond and almost never seen without his football letterman jacket
-   _Society_: Ferguson has the jock attitude down pat, and turns out to be one of the evil Society members.
-   _The Hunger Games_: Careers, the Tributes from Districts 1 and 2, come off this way due to their district's practice of training children specifically to volunteer for the Hunger Games. As a result, they are far more likely to win than Tributes from other districts. Although, their arrogance is a flaw that can be used against them.
-   Subverted in _The Duff_. Wes appears to be this initially, being introduced as an obnoxious, dumb, immature football captain who disses Bianca for her DUFF status but it turns out to be a case of Brutal Honesty. He's actually a pretty nice guy and remains quite helpful and loyal to Bianca throughout the movie, giving her social advice on how to stop being a DUFF.
-   _The Gallows_ has Ryan; a loud, obnoxious, and all-around Jerkass who antagonizes the theater crew just to be a dick and insults Charlie's death, who was accidentally hanged during the production of a school play. Guess who Charlie's ghost kills first.
-   In _Hangman's Curse_, the football jocks are almost all unrepentant bullies. Blake is the outlier, the result of him falling for Elisha, and realizing that, as the one black person in the film's main cast, him bullying a minority group might be a little bit of an asshole maneuver.
-   Brody in _The Hollow_ is the quarterback and captain of the football team. He spends his time playing cruel practical jokes, forces others to do his homework, and regards Karen as his personal property
-   The Texas Colts in _Necessary Roughness_, particularly Flat-Top.
-   Bluto in _Shrooms_ is an obnoxious, sexist, violent, steroid-using jock who laughs at others' misfortune and who, according to his girlfriend Lisa, is into perverse sexual activity.
-   Rodney in _Hot Bot_, who seemingly spends all his time picking on nerds, ignoring his girlfriend, and hitting on women. He even carries business cards announcing that he has a 15-inch penis. He eventually gets pummeled into the ground by a Sexbot.
-   In _Varsity Blood_, all of the football team apart from Bubba are sexists, horndogs, bullies, and druggies. Blaine is the worst of the lot because he is also a Dirty Coward to boot.
-   Steve in _Evil Breed: The Legend of Samhain_, who seems to have no interest in the subject matter the group is in Ireland to study; spends most of the movie mocking and humiliating Shae; and is generally sexist and misogynist.n He even talks through the movie the others are trying to watch.
-   _Jack the Reaper_: Steven, who wears a football jersey and spends his time tossing a football, picks on the albino Brian and the fat kid Harold; wants to bang every girl but refuses to commit to any of them; and — on being told that Maya is deaf — describes it as 'hot'.
-   All the victims of the Serial Killer in _Some Guy Who Kills People_ were this in high school.
-   In _Angel (1984)_, Ric is the quarterback on the school football team, and is attempting to bang all of the hot chicks in school. Molly turns him down, and later humiliates him, so he attempts to avenge himself by trashing her reputation.
-   In _Just One of the Guys_, Greg Tolan (William Zabka, natch) exercises by abusing his high school classmates, specifically giving one of them a wedgie because he couldn’t find any weights.
-   _Heathers_ has Kurt Kelly and Ram Sweeney, two homophobic jocks who torment other students and only want sex from the Heathers and Veronica. This trope is also in play with the versions of them from the musical, but is inverted in the 2018 TV series, where both are Lovable Jocks instead.
-   _Riot Girls_: A group of jocks called the Titans have turned into a criminal gang who try to control the town after the adults died of a plague.
-   In _Hunk_, one of Bradley's neighbors in Sea Spray is a former pro-footballer named Skeet Mecklenburger who still acts like a high school jock and immediately starts bullying the nerdy Bradley.
-   In _2:37_, Luke is a star soccer player who thinks that school is useless because he is going to be a professional footballer. He talks through class, brags about his sexual conquests, and is one of the primary bullies who picks on Steven and harasses Sean for being openly gay. He is also secretly gay and has had some sort of relationship with Sean.
-   _Wishcraft_: Samantha's boyfriend Cody is the captain of the football team, and the school's star jock. He and his jock friends bully the outsiders like Brett and Howie. Until someone starts picking off the school's disruptive elements...

    Literature 

-   _Angela Nicely_: Downplayed for the Payne twins, who are bullies, and they play soccer/football, but are bad at P.E. in general.
-   In _El Conquistador_, Eheca is a mix between this and a male Alpha Bitch.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   Cormac McLaggen, a talented but obnoxious and self-satisfied quidditch player.
    -   Some of the Slytherin players like Marcus Flint fit the trope enough to warrant a few whispers about a possible blood-relation to trolls. Zacharias Smith of Hufflepuff might also count, given that he plays Chaser for his team and all his scenes portray him as extremely unpleasant.
    -   Draco Malfoy hovers between this and a male Alpha Bitch. While he spends much of his time bitching and generally lets his buddies Crabbe and Goyle handle the more physical stuff, he's a legitimately good athlete in his own right and performs well as Slytherin's seeker.
    -   Harry is horrified to discover that his late father, James Potter, was one of these in his youth. This also happens to be Professor Snape's Freudian Excuse for treating Harry so poorly, as Snape was one of the students that James constantly bullied and Harry looks just like him with the only difference being eye color.
    -   Dudley Dursley becomes a boxer around book five, and ups his game from beating up Harry (who is no longer an available target due to a combination of spending most of his time at Hogwarts and having some dangerous adult wizard friends) to beating up any unlucky kid who looks at him funny. He grows out of it later, though.

-   Ace and his gang of thugs in Stephen King's "The Body". This guy goes beyond the realms of being an asshole to utter sadism. After Gordon scares off Ace and his gang with a pistol, he gets back at him by breaking his nose and fingers and kicking him in the testicles (they were actually on the verge of harming him more seriously when they are run off by Gordon's neighbor). They then attack his friends Chris, Teddy, and Vern by breaking Chris's arm and "leaving his face looking like a Canadian sunrise" and giving less severe beatings to the other two. It's very satisfying when adult Gordon, whose friends have not survived beyond young adulthood, finds Ace a fat, empty shell of a man who doesn't even recognize his former punching bag.
-   _Vampire Kisses_: Trevor Mitchell. He's bullied Raven ever since kindergarten though he flirts with her from time to time. It's hinted on various occasions that he has a crush on her and is incapable of expressing his feelings.
-   In one _Animorphs_ book, Marco ended up on the wrong side of an argument with two Jerk Jocks - Drake, who was a big deal on the swim team, and Woo, who wasn't. Drake was actually the lesser of the two jerks, and drew the line at making fun of Marco's deceased mother. Woo, however, didn't. Marco was in the pool about to test his shark morph, and he'd just grown shark teeth. Jake showed up just in time to very likely save Woo from getting his throat ripped out.
-   Related to the Harry Potter example, British "school stories" tend toward having aristocratic bullies who are a proto-version of this trope. Before being used in his own series, Flashman was one of these in _Tom Brown's Schooldays_, and he fits the jock part too, being good at cricket and other sports.
-   _Discworld_ examples:
    -   As revealed in _Night Watch_, Lord Downey, the head of the Assassins' Guild, was one of these in his youth, and his nerdy punching bag was none other than the young Lord Vetinari. Even at 16, Vetinari doesn't seem to have been terrorized by this treatment so much as...mildly inconvenienced. One can only imagine Downey's reaction when Vetinari became Patrician. And given his love of mind games, Vetinari is almost certainly using their personal history to keep Downey, and by extension the Assassins' Guild, in line.
    -   _Unseen Academicals_ focuses more on bad behavior in the crowd than by the players, but vicious-minded gang leader Andy Shank decides to join Ankh-Morpork United and proceeds to cheat and abuse opposing players outrageously, to the point where his team captain apologizes to the Academicals and the Dean for his behavior. Though he would have been a jerk whether he became a jock or not.
-   Both played straight and subverted in _Artichokes Heart_. The Love Interest Kyle despite being a jock is one of the nicest, most sweetest guys there was. A few other jocks at the school on the other hand ... not so much.

-   The _molesworth_ series provides a very British example in the form of "grabber m.a. head of skool captain of everything and winner of the mrs joyful prize for raffia work", who owes his multiple positions and ability to lord it over everyone to the fact that st custards is virtually bankrupt and his family is filthy rich.
-   _The Wave (1981)_ contains something of a deconstruction. The football team's egotistical players are all so obsessed with making themselves look good and competing with each other for glory that they barely function as a team, and have suffered several losing seasons.
-   Chris Crutcher often plays with this in his books. He usually has several straight examples of the Jerk Jock, but his protagonists are often jocks who are good people, and the extra characters who are jocks can be either. But he has stated in several books that (especially in small towns) the jock subculture in schools creates, supports, and admires Jerk Jocks.
-   George Hellebore in the _Young Bond_ novel _SilverFin_. Having said that, however, George gets better when he reveals that his father, an abusive Social Darwinist, is almost completely insane. His aggression is a direct result of the weird stamina-enhancing pills his father gives him, and when the lad stops taking them, his disposition improves.

-   Russell Quitman from _Where Things Come Back_, though he may be a little more pitiable after he becomes paralyzed in a car accident.
-   An early example is Geoffrey Delamayn, the villain of _Man and Wife_: a popular, handsome amateur sportsman who's prepared to resort to bullying and murder when things don't go his way.
-   _Worm_ has Sophia Hess, who is mentioned to be one of the top students of Winslow High's PE course. She is an incredibly brutal version of this, a teen '90s Anti-Hero and Super Supremacist that believes in a Darwinistic "predator and prey" mindset and has made Taylor Hebert the primary target of her hatred for no good reason other than Taylor being a very quiet girl. Some Fanon stories outright express that is implied in the main story: that the reason why the other students at Winslow are such Apathetic Citizens is because they are _very_ afraid of what Hess would do to _them_ if they decided to try to stand in the way of her "fun".
-   _Miles Taylor And The Golden Cape_ has Craig "The Jammer" Logg, a Big Man on Campus who can bully Miles Taylor with total impunity, especially since Miles is the new kid nobody wants to be around.
-   _N.E.R.D.S._: Jackson Jones starts out as a young version; a 5th-grade star football player and tormentor of nerds. Until his Braces of Orthodontic Overkill prevent him from wearing a helmet, killing his spot on the team and his popularity at the school. Since the first book is from his perspective, he just thought he was pulling harmless pranks on nerds and saw himself as a Lovable Jock, which he genuinely becomes after his Jerkass Realization.
-   In _The Bridge of Clay_ juvenile boxer Jimmy Hartnell, who decides to bully Character Narrator Matthew Dunbar because of his piano lessons (to his mind, a boy who plays the piano, even forced by his mother, must be gay).
-   The _King of the Bench_ series has Jimmy Jimerino, a hotshot athlete at Spirou T. Agnew Middle School (behind Becky O'Callahan). We learn in the third book that the reason he's this way is because of the pressure his dad puts him under to be the best athlete.
-   _Zara Hossain Is Here_: Quarterback Travis Benson and his football buddies harass or insult Zara at every opportunity starting out due to her status as a Muslim girl of color.
-   In _Lily and Dunkin_, the basketball team forms a Gang of Bullies led by Vasquez. Vasquez' favorite target is closeted trans girl Lily, whom he constantly harasses and calls "Fag!" Lily and Dash call them the Neanderthals.
-   There are several examples in the Whateley Universe, but Kodiak at Whateley Academy might be the best, even if he isn't in sports. He's been an Alpha for years, he cut a swath through the hot girls of the school, he has a history of picking on people, and he has now taken over the Alphas. On the other hand, he already got his karmic payback, it turns out he's smart, he has now fallen for a girl who's a nerd, and he seems to be trying to make all the Alphas behave. But it's an ongoing story, so who knows?
    -   It is also mentioned that these types played an important role in supervillain Gizmatic's backstory, including two who put both him and Dr. DNA in the hospital for a month; this event led to the creation of the Order of The Worn Wrench. It was also the cause of his rivalry with the third Champion, who apparently was not such a nice guy before he took up the Champion Force.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _13 Reasons Why_: Nearly every onscreen jock is depicted as such (their leader being a misogynistic serial rapist), with the exceptions of Jeff Atkins, who is a genuinely nice guy, Scott Reed, who, while initially coming off as one of the regular jerks, turns out to be a pretty decent guy who ultimately joins the protagonists' side, and Charlie St. John; seen throughout most of season 3 hanging around jerkass Montgomery de la Cruz, but Charlie abandons him when what Monty did to Tyler comes to light.
-   Sunny Capaduca of _15/Love_ is a weird example, being young and female. She's got the ego, manipulation, and free ride parts down, though.
-   Most of the time _All American_ defies the trope; though Jordan was this at times and Asher fit this trope to a T before their Character Development. The closest example would be Cam, Crenshaw's new receiver who immediately gets an attitude and big head from being on the team and immediately tries to challenge Spencer.
-   Virtually the entire team on _Blue Mountain State_, but most especially Thad. Even Alex, the nominal good guy, can be rather sleazy at times. The trope is subverted in that the other sports teams at the college are no better, especially the rich, snooty lacrosse team. However, they all spend so much time being jerks to each other that the rest of the student body largely escapes unscathed, with the exception of the nerds that do the football team's classwork.
-   _The Brady Bunch_: The season 5 episode "Quarterback Sneak", primarily in the subplot where Carol is visited by her high school boyfriend Tank Gates, a former lineman who boasts about his abilities as the greatest player in Westdale High history. Could also be applied to Jerry Rogers in the main plot — a cheating quarterback who maneuvers his way into Marcia's heart ... just so he can get a look at Greg's playbook; he acts like a complete jerk to Greg when he tries to tell him he got the wrong playbook.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer:_
    -   "Go Fish" has a swim team who take steroid abuse to a new level.
    -   "Reptile Boy" has a fraternity, which turns out to be a front for a demon-worshipping conspiracy.
    -   Larry, until he came to terms with who he was, and Percy, until Vampire Willow kicked his ass some.
    -   "Him": Xander says that he was a bully in school. Now that high school is behind them, he is a pudgy pizza delivery guy.
-   Averted with Devon "Captain Awesome" Woodcombe from _Chuck_. Devon is a jock and main character Chuck is a nerd, creating the perfect conditions for this trope to appear. However, Devon is a good friend to Chuck, a good boyfriend/husband to Chuck's sister Ellie, and an excellent doctor.
-   At least one of the murder victims in _Cold Case_ was like this. That one raped _four_ girls, got away with it thanks to his family's wealth, was cornered by his four victims who wanted revenge... and ended up shot to death by one of the girls' pre-teen younger brother.
-   _Cobra Kai:_
    -   Kyler. He's captain of the wrestling team and the leader of a gang of rich and popular bullies that harass Miguel, Eli, and Demetri simplying for existing. If that's not enough, he tries to date-rape Sam and slutshames her after she refuses to accept his sexual advances.
    -   Hawk becomes this after becoming one of Cobra Kai's top students, being the leader of his own gang of bullies and constantly harassing the Miyagi-Dos (i.e. Sam, Demetri, Chris, Nathaniel). Later subverted when he finally makes a Heel–Face Turn during the climax of the LaRusso house fight (though he was already losing his place in Cobra Kai as Kreese's favorite to Tory and Robby).
    -   In Kreese's flashback, we have David—a varsity football player who bullies Kreese for just being a "freak" (as well as Betsy for simpling LOOKING at him). Nobody felt sorry for the bastard when Kreese gave a much-deserved beating to him and his henchman.
-   _Community_:
    -   Mike from "Comparative Religion." In a variant, it's noted that he used to be an overweight geek, which is why he's so cruel now—he's got a _lot_ to prove.
    -   That said, Troy exists to avert this trope. Sure, he might be a little insensitive sometimes, but he's probably the sweetest person on the show, and is The Heart of the group. Case in point? He's more turned on by girls in pajamas than lingerie because he just wants to know they're comfortable.
-   _Degrassi: The Next Generation_
    -   Dean is a soulless monster who exists only to drink, smash and rape.
    -   The Shep from season 8, who was the school's _principal_. He discriminated against the "weirdos" of the school and favored the football team more than anything. He even called Clare a "little bitch" after she stuck up for Connor when the Shep planned on expelling him. Derek harassed and assaulted Jane for being on the football team with him. Shep didn't care.
    -   Owen in season 10. His main hobbies include playing football and being a bigoted, homophobic jerk towards openly gay Zane and Riley, whose homosexuality was already rumored among the football players by that point. At one point, he writes a homophobic slur across a school bus outside the school just to provoke Riley.
        -   Much less so recently though, as he's been shown to genuinely love his gay brother.
    -   Drew, from when he was first introduced in season 10. He gets better, however.
    -   In season 12, Dallas seems pretty nice to other jocks and on his own, but joins in with the rest of the hockey team in homophobic heckling and pressures Campbell to do the same.
-   _Flashpoint_ deals with this in one episode, where a group of bullies takes it too far and humiliates a kid in front of his crush and posts it on the Internet, causing the kid to snap and bring a gun to school intending to make them pay. However, the kid had no intention of actually killing the bullies. He only wanted them to feel the embarrassment he had felt.
-   _Frasier_: Bob "Bulldog" Briscoe, the host of the sports show at KACL, is an obnoxious jerk who's also captain of the station's softball team. He regularly plays pranks on his coworkers and one station manager encouraged him to keep pranking Frasier as it lead to a boost in his ratings.
-   _Glee_ has a whole squad of these.
    -   It's averted, inverted, or subverted as often as it is played straight, though. Quarterback Finn is one of the kindest, sweetest people in the show and seems to feel that the rest of the team is redeemable if he sets the right example. Puck fits the Jerk Jock archetype best out of the main cast, but he's not privileged, is quite intelligent even though he often states that school is for suckers, and later in the season struggles quite a bit with the consequences of his womanizing in the first few episodes. More recently he has been less of a jerk as well. The show also has Mike and Matt, who despite having Those Two Guys status, they actually seem like nice guys and all four of them have been bullied by the other Jerk Jock types due to being in glee club. Played straight by Karofsky and Azimio, who often target Kurt for his sexuality. It is later revealed that Karofsky is actually gay himself, and specifically targets Kurt, the only openly gay kid in school, because of his confusion on his own sexuality.
    -   This has been subverted again, much more interestingly, in the second season, with Puck moving further away from the Jerk Jock through his experiences in juvie and his relationship with Lauren, while Finn has moved much closer to being one (or shown his true colors more plainly) through his treatment of Rachel, Kurt (particularly early in the season) and Quinn, and the way his self-centered thoughtlessness destroyed the team's chances at Nationals.
    -   In season 3, Finn has mellowed out, Puck is becoming a responsible student and father, and Karofsky transferred schools and has started coming to terms with his homosexuality. The only remaining Jerk Jock is the hockey captain, a minor background character.
    -   The new generation brought in by season 4 comes with Surette and Lipoff, two cronies of new alpha bitch Kitty.

-   Brody Mitchum from _Heroes_ is a jock and serial rapist who targets Claire and, if only temporarily, _kills_ her. He gets extravagantly punished: Claire crashes his car with him aboard, she survives thanks to her Healing Factor, he is confined to a wheelchair, and later he has his entire memory erased (at the order of her Father).
-   Given a twist in _It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia_. Dennis believed himself to have been this in high school, thinking he was the most important person in the school and everyone else was his "Minions". Although Dennis has the arrogant, idiotic bully aspects of this trope down perfectly, he later learns that he was not even at all popular in high school and everyone thought he was a smug jerk with a high opinion of himself (which he absolutely is). Unsurprisingly, Dennis does not take this revelation well.
-   Shun Daimonji from _Kamen Rider Fourze_. However, it's eventually revealed he's a Jerk with a Heart of Gold and he changes his ways. In fact, when he sees another Jerk Jock, he even comments on how he used to be that way and steps in to help the victim.
-   _Letterkenny_ has Riley and Jonesy, a pair of incompetent hockey players that always start insulting Wayne and Daryl whenever they cross paths.
-   Al Bundy was implied to be one of these on _Married... with Children_. This example stands out because the Jerk Jock is actually the protagonist.
    -   He is also something of a deconstruction of this trope, showing what happens to a lot of jocks once they're no longer on the gravy train.
-   _Merlin_''s Prince Arthur starts out this way, but changes through association with Merlin... or maybe Merlin just gets to know him better.
-   _Nowhere Boys_: Jake at first. Trent Long, who replaces him as the school athletic hero, through and through. Also arguably Sam, but he's more air-headed and self-obsessed than actually malicious.
-   In the _NUMB3RS_ episode "Dark Matter", the jocks who rape Karen are this.
-   Luke was this early on in _The O.C._, the captain of the water polo team who was dating Marissa and who was always picking fights with Ryan.
-   Averted with Harvey in _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_. He's a genuinely sweet, if a little ditzy guy. Cruel Cheerleader Alpha Bitch Libby wants to be his girlfriend, but he doesn't show much interest in her.
-   _Smallville_ has it in the beginning with Whitney, the star quarterback who's dating Lana Lang. He eventually reforms but the first episode has him crucifying (no, really) Clark.
-   Steve Harrington _seems_ like one of these in the first season of _Stranger Things_, but really only because he's a thinly-drawn romantic rival to Unlucky Childhood Friend Jonathan. He gets more focus in the second season and reveals a much more likable side. Season two also introduces his Evil Counterpart Billy Hargrove who plays this _much_ straighter to the point of borderline sociopathy (although even Billy gets minor sympathy points as it's implied he's only as bad as he is due to being verbally, emotionally and physically abused by his father.)
    -   Season Four introduces Jason Carver, who..._isn't_ this. Yes he does not treat the school outcasts very well at all but compared to Billy he's fairly stable and he's only the antagonist due to circumstances leading him to believe that local outcast Eddie murdered his girlfriend. Compared to most examples on this list, his only real crime was being self-righteous.
-   Jackson on _Teen Wolf_. Having wealthy parents does not help. He does get a few Pet the Dog moments in Season 2, and it's revealed partway through Season 1 that part of the reason he's so... aggressive is due to him having an almost pathological need to prove himself thanks to being adopted.
-   _Veronica Mars_:
    -   Logan in his early appearances before Character Development kicked in: ostracizing Veronica, wrecking her car with a baseball bat, organizing bum fights...
    -   The series notably averts this in one episode where a girl cheats on her football-playing boyfriend with an artist. The "star athlete" turns out to be genuinely decent and caring, the artist... not so much.
    -   Also averted by Wallace, the star basketball player who is, with the possible exception of Meg (Alpha Bitch aversion cheerleader popular girl who is the nicest person around), the best person in the entire series.

-   Brad from _I Am Not Okay With This_ is a fairly typical, if more reprehensible example. At one point he cheats on his girlfriend Dina but when Dina kisses another girl named Syd, he has the gall to take it personally. He proceeds to steal said girls' diary and out her to the whole school, during their Junior Prom no less. Fortunately Syd manages to silence him before he could get that far.

    Podcasts 

-   Frank from ''Sequinox. He bullies Caiden in the prequel comic, and his nasty personality carries over to the noir world in episode 11.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   It should come to no one's surprise that professional wrestling has always been a haven for asshole career athletes as well as those willing to rub their established athletic legacies in the face of everyone else. A mat wrestling example was "The Natural Guy" Buddy Rogers (naturally good, naturally better than you) and the Big Cat Ernie Ladd, who was a jerk jock from professional football.
-   The Varsity Club of NWA fame, originally featuring former collegiate amateur wrestlers Rick Steiner, Mike Rotunda, "Dr. Death" Steve Williams, and Kevin Sullivan who wore their letterman jackets to the ring and bragged about how much better their amateur background made them in comparison to other wrestlers. They later reformed the group in WCW in 1999 to... decidedly less success. Rotunda, Steiner and Sullivan were all years past their prime at that point, and the stable wasn't utilized well or often. It did, however, feature Leia Meow bouncing on a trampoline and doing calisthenics.
-   Curt Hennig in his "Mr. Perfect" persona, where he shows off how to "perfectly" play several sports.
-   For a short time (less than 2 months), WCW repackaged Ray Lloyd, best known for the Glacier gimmick, as Coach Buzz Stern and gave him a "protege" named Luther Biggs. Even though Lloyd looked and sounded the part, having coached football in real life, the gimmick was received by fans with utter indifference and got canned quickly.
    -   Luther Biggs didn't help. His gimmick was supposed that even though he didn't have a traditional jock build or attitude, he "had heart" and that was why Stern had chosen him as a protege. Before this gimmick, Biggs had played a flamboyant strutter kind of character, and he kept using the same mannerisms. Imagine if Larry Sweeney or even Ric Flair had worn an amateur singlet and a grey t-shirt but otherwise played the gimmicks they're known for - that's what Luther Biggs was.
-   Kurt Angle can be one of these when he's playing a heel, playing up his amateur wrestling skills and Olympic gold medal wins.
-   Then there was Christopher Nowinski, (supposedly) the first WWE Superstar to graduate from Harvard University. He played his character more as an upper-crust snob than a Jerk Jock _per se_, but he did wear his old letterman jacket and thus fit into this trope. (He did legitimately attend Harvard, where he played football. But there have been a lot of guys to pass through Capitol/WWWF/WWE through the years.)
-   The Spirit Squad (a ridiculed heel faction from back in 2006) are an interesting case. They're heavily muscled, gung-ho, and prone to picking on people who don't measure up to their standards. But....they're cheerleaders. Yes, with pom-poms and a megaphone and cheesy rhyming chants. If they were girls, they'd serve as a Girl Posse. As it is, they reside in an uncomfortable frontier between the above trope and Sissy Villain. (If they were faces, they'd probably be an example of Real Men Wear Pink.)
-   Kellie Skater, believe it or not, was a respectful (if cocky) babyface jock for most of her career, but raised her notoriety bar for the times she fell into this trope, gaining an increasing affection for protein shakes (and spitting them on those that displease her) and showing off her "guns", triggered when she was mocked by other wrestlers for being "small", to which she responded "I'm a tank!"
-   The All Night Express, expies of The World's Greatest Tag Team corrupted by Austin Aries in Ring of Honor, who eventually did get matched up against that very same tag team, who in turn were brought together amateur braggarts in the vein of Kurt Angle (and were for a time lead by him as "Team Angle")
-   WWE has "The All-American American" Jack Swagger, another former amateur wrestler (who, as his nickname implies, was an All-American wrestler in his college years) who is the embodiment of what happens when the Jerk Jock graduates from school and doesn't change even the slightest bit.
-   The Miz's protege Alex Riley. The fact that he wears a letterman jacket-like vest with "Varsity Villain" on the back really says all you need to know.
-   During his time as a member of Team Canada in WCW, Elix Skipper was touted by Lance Storm as a Grey Cup winning football player from the Canadian Football League in WCW. While it would rarely get mentioned again in WCW and never in TNA, his ego and heel attributes that came from it remained.
    
    **Elix Skipper:** Pound for pound, I'm the best athlete in the world...BAR NONE!
    

    Roleplay 

-   This is usually subverted in _Survival of the Fittest_, but in v1 the baseball team was said to sometimes bully other students despite the fact that they were like brothers to each other, and in v3 a few members of the football team have shown tendencies to do such, with Gentle Giant / Scary Black Man Darnell Butler having had to fight some of them on occasion to stop them from particularly severe actions. Though that doesn't change that he used to be one himself. V3 character Adam Reeves practically epitomizes this trope, with a touch of fatalism and Social Darwinism thrown in. V4 character Phillip Ward, a member of the ice hockey team, is also known to be a bully and once beat up Jimmy Brennan during a tryout. Not counting the occasional bullies who're otherwise good people, though, this trope almost never appears in SOTF, which is slightly surprising.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Psionics: The Next Stage in Human Evolution_: It's unsurprising that the game has these, given the general aesthetic.
    -   Chad Hutchins and his football team friends are violent, racist, bullies who made another character's life a living hell for being Filipino and unpopular. Their victim even opines that people like them have no business existing, except as antagonists in high school movies.
    -   Jerk jocks are a type of low-level enemy in the game, though they weren't called that.

    Theatre 

-   Brett in _13_ is this. And he is involved in a Betty and Veronica with the Brainless Beauty Kendra and **Lucy**.

-   Max Jägerman in _Nerdy Prudes Must Die_ embodies this trope entirely.

    Video Games 

-   In _Backyard Baseball_, Barry Bonds is exactly like this. However in real life he is more of a jerk in a Loners Are Freaks kind of way.
-   _Bully_ has a clique of jocks, all of whom fit the trope to some degree or other. Especially their leader, Ted Thompson. The Preppies clique fits the trope almost as well.
-   _Fallout 3_ has the Tunnel Snakes, a bunch of thugs who pick you when you turn ten and the main character's best friend at age 16. It's fair to say there's more in the intervening years, but the game glosses over that.

-   Sam in _Growing Up_ establishes himself as a sports-loving bully by throwing an American football on your head. He enjoys bullying other students because he thinks they just can't take a joke. However, he gets over this if you befriend/date him.

-   _Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass_ has Jimmy's older brother Buck. He's rude and domineering towards Jimmy, and kills Information Guy for being too wordy. His skillset is even labeled "Nerd Bash"!
-   Groose from _The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword_ fits this mold well enough being the bullying rival to Link throughout the early game, mainly due to his own unrequited crush on Zelda and jealousy of how close Link is to her. He does get more likable later on when he helps Link save Zelda from Ghirahim and Demise.

-   Roger, the blond-haired bully boy from _NiGHTS into Dreams…_, who has red eyes, to boot. (The name _Roger_ comes from Archie's short-lived comic book adaptation of the game, where he was given that name.)
-   _Paper Chase_: In the BASIC version, the physical education instructor says "Another wimp!" when seeing you and will tell you to get lost after you've passed.
-   _Persona 5_ combines this with Sadist Teacher in Suguru Kamoshida, the volleyball coach of Shujin Academy whose training methods are highly abusive, and who is infamous for injuring students whom he plum doesn't like as well as perving on female students. Over the course of the game's first act, this escalates to him attempting to _rape_ a student, driving her to attempt suicide. In addition, before you came to school, he had broken your friend Ryuji's legs and crippling him before having the track team disbanded out of spite.
-   _Potion Permit_: Contrasting his lazy but gentle twin brother, Derrek is often seen exercising for his job as a police officer, but is distrustful of people from the capital such as you, although he lets his guard down once he sees how capable you are in your field.
-   Dean a.k.a. Dingo and the luchadors from _Psychonauts_. An unusual case in the former since he's the _head cheerleader_ instead of the wrestling team (that role being Edgar, the patient of the level).
-   Issur, The Blacksmith of _Quest for Glory II: Trial By Fire_ gives off this vibe. It's kind of funny to see him refer to the Hero as a wimp; depending on how you played him in the first game, the Hero is probably the bane of dozens of brigands, trolls, cheetaurs, and saurus rex.
-   The Big Bad of _Ring Fit Adventure_ is Dragaux, a body-building dragon who embodies the worst aspects of gym culture like extreme competitiveness.
-   In _Roots Of Pacha_, Jelrod is an arrogant racer who enjoys showing off his guanaco, Fasty, and bragging about his looks. However, he learns to humble himself as the protagonist bonds with him.
-   The jocks in _The Trail Of Anguish_ chase the gang of nerds, forcing you to travel underground.
-   _Until Dawn_:
    -   Mike plays with and then ultimately subverts this trope. At first he has all the hallmarks of being a Jerk Jock as he's "the big guy on campus" in addition to being the athletic Class President who partakes in a cruel prank that involves misleading Hannah (the girl who has a crush on him) into undressing herself in front of him while everyone else is hiding and filming it. This not only humiliates Hannah but seemingly gets her and her sister Beth killed when Hannah runs out into a snowstorm and the latter follows her. However Mike does immediately regret his role in the prank and for the rest of the game shows great bravery and care for his friends. Mike even gets along very well with the nerdier Chris which is rare for this trope.
    -   Played straighter with Matt, who was the one filming Hannah when she started stripping off for Mike, wears his Letterman jacket throughout the game and dreams of being a Linebacker. Like what you'd expect he's ill-tempered, quite the meathead, somewhat cowardly and depending on the player's actions is quite the Crazy Jealous Guy over his Alpha Bitch girlfriend Emily. It's much easier to make the whole cast despise Matt than Mike, if you decide to go down the jerk route while playing as him. That being said, Matt's default state seems to be Lovable Jock.

    Visual Novels 

-   Deconstructed with the protagonist of _Double Homework_ over the whole story. Before the Barbarossa incident, he was hated as much as admired by his peers, and as he discovers, he did some significant things to earn that hatred.

    Web Animation 

-   The titular character of _Homestar Runner_ is usually much more of a Lovable Jock and a Dumb Jock, but his stupidity and bluntness occasionally make him an unintentional jerk toward others, particularly his on-again/off-again girlfriend Marzipan.
-   _The Most Epic Story Ever Told in All of Human History_: Typically the series doesn't focus on sports, but in the fourth episode, "The Most Epically Inspirational Sports Movie Ever", Ridiculously Epic takes on this role. It seems that he only started skateboarding to "antagonize random teenagers for no reason" at the skatepark, and to try to win a skateboarding competition to advance his evil plans with the prize money.
-   _The Stump_: Dirk "the Jerk" Bennington is a brash football captain.

    Webcomics 

-   _Ozy and Millie_ features one rather prominently. Much like in _Calvin and Hobbes_, the titular characters never actually get back at him, and rarely manages to avoid him. Millie could initially avoid his more physical attention since he Wouldn't Hit a Girl, but when she demanded equal treatment, he complied. However, while the kids couldn't do much against him, the fact that Ozy's family consists entirely of dragons has occasionally brought some truly satisfying results.
-   Goes under some deconstruction in _El Goonish Shive_ with regards to Tony. Grace seems to think Tony harbors a secret crush on Tedd, whom he bullies constantly. More telling, though, is a strip in which it's revealed that he's a Jerk Jock even by the standards of his teammates.
-   In _Jupiter-Men_, Rick Chang is a highly popular jock and member of the rugby team who abuses his strength and athleticism to force smaller, weaker kids to do his homework for him. He's also an entitled prick who can't understand why Jackie wouldn't be interested in him and attempts to coerce Arrio into helping him get into her good graces. When Arrio fights back, Rick abuses his mom's prestige to walk away scot-free while Arrio is punished for defending himself.
-   In _The Wotch_, four Jerk Jocks are turned into girls (in body AND mind), and become the school's cheerleaders, getting their own spin-off, _Cheer!_. Ironically, they're much happier that way. Except for the most cheerful looking one, who somehow remembers "her" past as a football player and misses the sport, if nothing else. She keeps quiet for the sake of her happier friends.

-   Arguably the King of this trope is Brett Taggerty from _Dominic Deegan_ who is also misogynistic, and borderline psychotic, the only use he has for women is giving him sex, and he will fly into a rage at the drop of a pin. His most memorable scene is after breaking his hand, and finding out that Pam can't fix it in time for a game hits her so that he can hold her hostage until Greg can fix it.

-   Pontagar, Champion of the Fire Clan is the Proud Warrior Race Guy version of this in _The Challengesof Zona_
-   Equius from _Homestuck_. Not only is he obsessed with being STRONG, he has an enormous ego and an unrepentant bigot to those with lower blood than him.
-   Biff in _Tales Of Gnosis College_ is a narcissistic athlete who coerces _his own girlfriend_ into playing a humiliating role in his fraternity's initiation ceremony. She gives him his comeuppance, though.
-   Sam in _General Protection Fault_ is an interesting case. While the viewer knows that his engagement with Ki did not end well, he's introduced as a nice person. A darker side of him manifests later on, as he insults Fooker, overreacts to Ki getting a haircut, cheats on Ki ((it's never confirmed, but he married the person he was suspected of seeing) and finally attempts to rape Ki, leading to their breakup.
-   In _Dumbing of Age_, Danny is nearly assaulted by a bunch of jocks minutes after being dumped, only to be rescued by Amazi-Girl. Subverted when he tries to duplicate the event, and can only find a very confused football player.
-   Garrett from _Crystal Heroes_ isn't a fundamentally bad person, but he does casually insult and belittle people on a regular basis.
-   _Virgin vs. Chad_:
    -   Chad is often either Played Straight, Downplayed, or Subverted. Chad appears to have the characteristics of a bully, but he is usually more concerned with attracting female attention than actually being a jerk to anyone.
    -   'Brad' from the Virgin vs Chad memes, more than Chad himself. He aspires to Chadhood, however, since Chadhood is something one is simply born into, Brad is fated to never achieve it. He turns to success at sports to try and compensate, is never seen without his letterman's jacket, and he often bullies Virgin. Chad is usually not an example, as he's too good at sports to actually bother playing them and doesn't need to be a jerk because everyone already worships him.

-   A textbook example of the narcissistic gloating Jerk Jock is superstrong Captain Hammer, the nemesis of Dr. Horrible in _Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog_, an online Supervillain Musical by Joss Whedon. Not only does Captain Hammer beat up Dr. Horrible on a regular basis, he steals his sweet girl, too. The Jock part is particularly notable in a prequel comic in which it is shown that Captain Hammer believes that goths and any kid really good at math or science are all potential supervillains and advises kids to get them arrested by the police.
-   The Stuntman from the second season of _The Guild_ is not so much a Jerk Jock as an Oblivious Jock, as he's really only an asshole to Codex occasionally because he doesn't understand what's going on with her.
-   Part of Retsupurae's Alternate Character Interpretation of MuscleBomber2021.
-   Blake from _Sorority Forever_, the president of Omega Tau Omega, is a textbook example.
-   In Stop Bullying Now Brick is an example of one since he's into sports and picks on Milton.

    Western Animation 

-   Averted with Lee of _The Amazing Spiez!_. He's great at sports and quite popular around school, but he's friendly to everyone and a great big brother to his three siblings. He occasionally has a moment of arrogance or chauvinism, but he's set straight pretty quickly and usually learns his lesson.
-   Vince Chung in _American Dad!_, and the coach's son, whose jerkiness stems from being abused by his father, leading to an awkward scene of him crying in Steve's arms while threatening to beat him up the next day.
-   Darren's American football-playing older brother Will in _As Told by Ginger_ is a Big Brother Bully and doesn't think kindly of middle schoolers. Darren himself originally disliked football but was pushed to join the team when he began high school. He Took A Level In Jerk Ass and even cheated on Ginger, though at least he broke up with her quickly after the flirting began, however it's implied he toned down as an adult.
-   Nelson Nash from _Batman Beyond_. When Bruce asks Terry about who would hate him enough to use a Humongous Mecha to flatten his car, Terry tells him that "The line starts with me and goes around the block. Twice."
-   _The Buzz on Maggie_ has her older brother Aldrin.
-   Dean Larrity from _Code Monkeys_ is justified in that he's partially brain damaged and partially retarded, "Wutz up!?"
-   _Clone High_: JFK's clone is pretty much this - athletic, good-looking, popular, and also a cheating womanizer. Best exemplified by "A Room of One's Clone: The Pie of the Storm," where he spends almost a full minute making jokes about Marie Antoinette's boobs, only to then beat up Gandhi for stealing his pun.
-   _Danger Mouse_: The episode "High School Inedible" suggests that Danger Mouse himself was one of these as a teenager.
-   Dash and Kwan from _Danny Phantom_. Like Spider-Man with Flash, Danny could give them what they deserve in an instant, but not without blowing his secret identity. They had at least one Enemy Mine episode, as well.
    -   However, Danny _does_ give it to them in one episode - but it backfires horribly when the ghost of picked-on and bullied Sidney Poindexter stumbles upon what Danny is doing and decides that _Danny_ is the bully and attacks him.
    -   Additionally, like Spider-Man above, Dash is a big fan of Inviso-Bill (before the Danny Phantom appellation is widely used). He's quite blatantly a Flash Thompson Expy.
    -   Kwan is more of a Jerk Jock Sidekick, as he rarely initiates bullying on his own, and in fact protested when Valerie asked him to "hurt the unpopular boy" for spilling something on her sweater, and only reluctantly went along with it when she growled in response to his protest.
        -   Emphasized to its fullest in "Lucky in Love" where Kwan exhibits Hidden Depths of painful loneliness. It indicates he only got popularity through bullying out of a desperate desire for friends because he wanted to belong _somewhere_ than nowhere. If anything, he has a lot in common with an earlier Danny who was also seeking his path in life (ya know, before he found it).
-   Kevin Thompson from _Daria_ is an unusual subversion: he's far too stupid to be anything more than an annoyance, and while he bluntly alludes to Daria's unpopularity he still treats her like a friend most of the time. The same goes for Mack, who's less sports-obsessed and _much_ smarter.
    -   In the first season finale a Jerk Jock graduate appears and is killed by the very goalpost being put up in his honor. However, the episode revolves around exploring characters' reactions to his death with Daria's Best Friend Jane feeling alienated by her callously regarding him as an Asshole Victim after they practically saw him die.
-   Roger Klotz from _Doug_ is a downplayed example; he is a bully and plays football, but so do most of the male cast and isn't mentioned to be particularly talented in the sport. His bullying is also mild teasing or pranks and he is often on civil terms with Doug. Percy Femur, the large, threatening, and talented basketball player who scares even Roger is a straighter example.
-   Kleet in _Dude, That's My Ghost!_ Athletic build, check. Brain the size of a walnut, check. Antagonizes Spencer and his friends, check.
-   Kevin from _Ed, Edd n Eddy_ does come off as a Jerk Jock because of his arrogance. However, he usually only acts like a jerk towards the Eds and then usually because they've provoked him somehow. Kevin also has average intelligence and sticks up for the other kids if the Eds do something to them (especially when he suspects a scam). All in all he's really not that bad. In the Grand Finale, even he decides to stand up for Eddy against his brother, who's a way bigger jerk than him.
-   Lampshaded and Subverted in _The Fairly Oddparents_ where in an It's a Wonderful Plot episode, becoming a football player made Barbaric Bully Francis into a friendly jock due to being able to put his aggression on the field.
-   The Black Knight in _Family Guy_. In the only episode where he appears, he sees Peter sitting with his girlfriend and threatens to kill him if he sees him again in the Renaissance fair. He even hates Peter as much as telling him to leave the fair when the latter only came to watch the jousting competition in the stands.
    -   Peter Griffin's sister Karen, a professional wrestler who competes under the name of "Heavy Flo", fits this trope somewhat, sort of gravitating into bullying territory as well.
-   A key part of the plot to _Galaxy High._ Doyle was a cocky sports star who, with bookworm Aimee, is sent to an interstellar high school and naturally assumes he'll be regarded as a hero. Instead, it turns out the aliens prefer smarts over athletics and thus Aimee is the big star while, without football, Doyle has to learn to get by on his own merits.
-   _Hey Arnold!_: Wolfgang and his 5th-grade cronies, whenever they're going up against Arnold and his friends at sports.
-   Averted in _Kim Possible;_ Brick Flagg might be the boyfriend to Bonnie Rockwaller, but he's actually pretty decent (if a bit dim) judging from what few appearances he gets. He later goes off to college in the fourth season and dumps Bonnie.
-   Averted and played straight in _King of the Hill._ Hank and his friends were all jocks in high school (Dale only sort of counts, though, being the team's towel manager), but were all friendly, upstanding young men and nice to the rest of the student body. Furthermore, Hank himself believes that the act of being on a sports team and being a good athlete will automatically make you an upstanding citizen. On the other hand, there was an episode involving their old, high school rivals who would barge into their houses and gloat loudly about how they won the big game twenty years after it happened. Further, some of the jocks still in school that Hank encounters over the series, although not outright antagonists, are less-than-friendly.
    -   Further averted in the episode "Peggy Makes the Big Leagues", in which Peggy meets a talented football player named David who is allowed to stay on the team in spite of his poor grades. When Peggy flunks him, therefore suspending him from the team because of the school's "no pass, no play" policy, it's the teachers and booster club who come after her and practically ostracize her, not David. In fact, throughout the episode, David was never seen as anything other than somewhat oblivious and entitled yet ultimately good-natured. When the booster club made a plan to make him look like he had a learning disability, he was furious and embarrassed to realize how easy it was for them to portray him this way because of how lazy he's been with academics. He comes to Peggy for help, admitting that he knows he's not that smart and hates feeling stupid, so he usually doesn't even bother trying with schoolwork since the other teachers will _let_ him. When he shows he's willing to work hard to learn, Peggy ultimately decided to let him play.
-   Lynn Loud from _The Loud House_ is a downplayed example as she has a few genuine heartwarming moments among her family but much less than the other sisters and is an extreme Sore Loser and Sore Winner and is frequently seen pushing her younger brother Lincoln around.
-   David in _Monster Allergy_. After having Annie as a friend, he stops bullying anyone.
    -   Soup and Ford, his minions, are also under this trope.
    -   In the comic, David was a closet bookworm all along.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   Gilda is a female example of this trope. She's a griffin who Rainbow Dash knew in Junior Speedsters, and does genuinely care about her. However, she thinks most ponies are "lame", and bullies a number of Ponyville's residents when she visits.
    -   Then there are the two muscleheaded Cloudsdale colts who mocked Fluttershy for her weak flying skills during "The Cutie Mark Chronicles". They didn't exactly grow out of their habits in adulthood either; they were still shown picking on Rainbow Dash in "Sonic Rainboom".
    -   Rainbow Dash herself is a mixture of a Jerk Jock and a Lovable Jock. She does have characteristics of the typical Jerk Jock, such as arrogance and an obnoxious attitude, but her worst traits intersect with her more altruistic traits, such as her Undying Loyalty towards Equestria and her friends, her protection of Fluttershy against the real Jerk Jocks in The Cutie Mark Chronicles, calling out her old friend Gilda in "Griffon the Brush-off", and the fact that while she is bluntly honest, she's never gone out of her way to intentionally harm anyone, unlike Gilda, for example. Underneath her rough exterior, it's not hard to find an obnoxious, but kind-hearted well-meaning pony. She is more of an aversion in later episodes, getting an interest in books, defending and trying to cheer Fluttershy, and having genuinely soft moments especially when around children like Scootaloo who is also a Lovable Jock.
    -   Lightning Dust from "Wonderbolt Academy" is a straight example however. Her sole motivation is to be #1, contrasting to Rainbow Dash's, whose motivations consist of juggling protecting her friends and hometown with training to join the Wonderbolts. Unlike Rainbow Dash, Lightning Dust is uncaring, selfish, and mercenary, which establishes her as a reckless, unpleasant Jerkass.
    -   "Rarity Investigates!" gives us retired Wonderbolt Wind Rider, and hoo-boy, he makes Lightning Dust look like a philanthropist. His sole motivation is to maintain his speed record from his Glory Days. So what if Rainbow Dash idolizes him and regards him as an inspiration?
    -   Speaking of the Wonderbolts, they too can be Jerk Jocks at times, to the point of many fanfic writers painting them in sociopathic lights. Spitfire and Fleetfoot especially in the episodes Rainbow Falls, and especially Newbie Dash where they abandon their fallen teammate Soarin, and in the latter episode, haze Rainbow Dash with a name her childhood bullies came up with, even Soarin joined in. However, they all were given embarrassing nicknames as a part of their job to motivate themselves. While they have moments of good judgment and altruism like Rainbow Dash, especially Soarin in "Rarity Investigates!" Spitfire loves to act like a Drill Sergeant Nasty to her fellow Wonderbolts and cadets at the academy. But then it's revealed in Friends Forever 11, she doesn't know how to teach and order ponies any other way, and that her Drill Sergeant Nasty attitude is because of being born into her Wonderbolt career.
-   Parodied with Jared and Blaine on _The Oblongs_. They're dumb bullies who will often pause their bullying for a moment to talk about their philosophy of life or their therapists.
-   Boscha from _The Owl House_ is a rare female example. In many ways she's a stereotypical rich high school mean girl but she's also the captain of Hexside's grudgby team and she's just as willing to bully people physically or humiliate them in athletic contests as she is to insult and harass them.
-   Skeebo from _Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures_. When he's not making fun of Pac, he's making some misguided attempt to assert his superiority over him.
-   Clinton Fillmore Jefferson XIII from _Pet Alien_ is an athletic jock who always wears a football uniform and loves bullying those weaker than him - particularly Tommy and Granville - by calling them "LOSAHS" and constantly bragging about his physical superiority. In one episode, he took over DeSpray Bay (after Tommy and Dinko altered history) and ruled it like a dictator, banning unhealthy things like video games and taffy and imprisoning those who dared rise against him.

-   Donnie Turnbull, Tommy's older brother on _Robotboy_. Forget Jerk Jock. Look up "douchebag" and you'll see Donnie's picture.
-   _Rocket Power_ has the rare example in which the main character takes on this role, specifically Otto Rocket, who is well known to brag about how much better than he is at others when it comes to extreme sports and is even an arrogant leader of the hockey games, only sticking to _his_ plays instead of compromising with his teammates, one of whom he'd later blame if it goes wrong.
-   _The Simpsons_: In "Home Away from Homer", Homer manages to drive Ned Flanders away from Springfield. A sports coach named Clay Roberts moves into Ned's old house and bullies Homer. Homer hates him so much that he tries to get Flanders to move back (and Flanders himself isn't too thrilled with _his_ new neighborhood, but that's another trope).
-   _The Spectacular Spider Man_. Just like in the original comics, Flash Thompson is a star high school football player and a typical jock and bully who mercilessly bullies his nerdy classmate Peter Parker but greatly admires the costumed superhero Spider-Man, an irony in which the superhero takes some gratification. This version of Flash continues to bully Peter, even when Peter has already been bitten by the radioactive spider and Flash is always trying to outsmart Parker but usually fails. In the series, he dates Liz Allan until they break up, seemingly due to Liz developing a crush on Peter. The series also says that Flash and Peter used to be close friends years ago, but it wasn't able to explain what led to their falling out before it was canceled.
    -   However, Flash isn't completely irredeemable. In the episode in which Peter's aunt has had a heart attack, some of the kids at school express their sympathies to Peter (who at the time is being manipulated by the black suit). Peter tells them that their sympathy won't pay the medical bills and that they can go to hell. Flash later calls him out on this, on the grounds that while he doesn't like Peter, he _does_ like Aunt May. Still, even though beating Flash up would be somewhat justified (grief over his aunt, plus long history of being bullied should be enough to make anyone snap), this comment allows Peter to realize that the Jerkass Has a Point, wise up, and get rid of the black suit. He later goes to thank Flash who in return, is quite polite (well, for Flash anyway).
    -   Flash in this series all around is a little more three-dimensional. A notable example is when the class receives their test results. Liz, his girlfriend, receives a D and he can see she is visibly upset by it. He then sees the teacher praising Peter on getting yet another A and decides to get even by throwing a football at him. Not exactly justified, but you can actually see it from his point of view.
    -   Another example is in the second season when Harry returns from his rehab and lets it slip that the reason he left was to recover from his addiction and not a vacation. Flash is, not surprisingly, pissed that Harry was juiced during his time on the team because that would mean they'd lose the football championship he busted his leg for. Later in the episode the trophy is taken away and the coach informs them they have to wait for the investigation. Everyone assumes Harry was the one who came clean, only for Flash to step up and admit he was the one who told the coach, saying there was no point in having it if they didn't win it fairly.
-   The Very Special Episode of _Static Shock_ about bullying and guns had Nick Connor, who repeatedly bullied a kid named Jimmy to the point where Jimmy brought a gun to school and nearly killed him (Richie got shot instead when someone tried to tackle Jimmy). Nick got off with a short suspension and some other fairly mild punishment. However, it should also be noted that Nick's parents are briefly shown looking very angry and disappointed in him, and Virgil makes a comment that Nick will probably never win any more popularity awards, so while Nick's punishment is light, Nick also loses his positive reputation, so there's that, at least.
-   There are a few of these in _Sym-Bionic Titan_, including Brandon Chase, Baron and a few unnamed high school students. Averted with Edwin "Meat" Kapinski, however.
-   Palmer of _Titan Maximum_ is what happens when you make a Hot-Blooded egotistical Jerk Jock the hero of a Humongous Mecha series. Hint: It doesn't end well.
-   _Total Drama:_
    -   Eva from Season 1 is a rare female version, who intimidates her fellow contestants with her Hair-Trigger Temper.
    -   Averted with Tyler who looks like a jock and is obsessed with sports (though not actually very good at them) yet is generally decent to everyone and DJ who is a star quarterback but is considered the nicest contestant on the island.
    -   Played straight with arrogant and violent footballer Lightning in _Revenge of The Island_ who takes the Jerk part to a whole new level after Scott's eliminated.
    -   Jo, also from _Revenge of the Island_, is another female example. Her "take-no-prisoners" attitude serves to play off against her teammate, the heroically-minded army cadet and Lovable Jock Brick.
-   _Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race_ had the Ice Dancers and MacArthur. The latter does grow out of it some by the show's end.
-   In _Ultimate Spider-Man (2012)_, Flash Thompson acts like the typical jerk that he is most continuities. But it's all a facade to hide the fact that his family is poor, and he tries to act like they're pretty well off. But when Flash finds out someone he bullied got hooked on mutagen in an effort to get revenge, he's horrified and tries to convince the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that it's not all the kid's fault. Sadly, Spider-Man informs Flash that even though he'd fessed up, it can't change what his former victim did. Flash looks heartbroken. This ends up being the start of a Heel–Face Turn for Flash, which ultimately rewards him the Venom symbiote and a place with S.H.I.E.L.D. as the trainee Agent Venom.
-   Rocko of _Undergrads_ isn't much of an athlete, but he's pretty big and muscular and he sure is a jerk.
-   Duncan from _X-Men: Evolution_ makes his debut with two of his friends about to beat Toad to a pulp. (Although to be fair, Toad had just stolen their wallets.) He only manages to get worse once mutants are exposed. His every appearance following the reveal in the second season has him harassing the X-kids or other mutants in some form. It does eventually bite him in the ass, thankfully.
