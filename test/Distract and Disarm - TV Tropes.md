**Seymour Talbot:** You know, I learned a thing or two after the last time you kicked \[my bodyguard "Jackass"'s\] ass.... When it comes to my personal security, I gotta take care of things myself. _\[dramatic gun cock\]_  
**Michael Westen:** You got hollow points in there.  
**Seymour:** _\[looks at the gun\]_ Oh, you can tell just by looking—  
**Michael:** _\[grabs the gun out of his hand\]_ No, I can't, but I can distract you long enough to take it.

Being held at gunpoint is not a great situation to be in: the other guy can kill you before you can draw your own weapon.

But not if you distract them long enough to grab the weapon out of their hand and subdue them, reversing your positions. Maybe lie to them that the safety is on or that It Works Better with Bullets, tell them to Look Behind You, or briefly Show Some Leg. Regardless, the point is to get them to take their eyes off you so you get a brief opening to try to disarm them.

This is possible in real life, and taught in some self-defense courses, but it is very dangerous to attempt: if the gunman is not successfully distracted, they can usually shoot you faster than you can disarm them.

A gun is not necessarily required for this maneuver, but it's more common than doing it against a knife wielder.

Subtrope of We Need a Distraction. Compare Defensive Failure, where the gunman doesn't have the nerve to fire and the other character simply takes it, Disarm, Disassemble, Destroy, where the character formerly held at gunpoint then disables the weapon altogether, and You Wouldn't Shoot Me, where the defending character tries to call the gunman's bluff. If the attempted disarm doesn't get the gun away immediately, it can lead into a Gun Struggle.

First he points out that the safety is on in the boy's gun, and when the boy takes it off, he grabs the gun's slide, pops out the bullet from the chamber, drops the clip off, and then offers to buy the empty gun from him for $100, dropping it in a crate full of empty pistols!

Later on, Earl successfully replicates the stunt by distracting a Cartel goon with a lighter and in the third act of the film Junior tries the stunt himself but he's so dumb that he spends the moment the goon is distracted patting himself in the back for his cleverness instead of disarming the guy and gets punched in the face as a result.
-   _RoboCop_: When Murphy and Lois go into the old steel mill, Lois finds Joe Cox (one of Clarence Boddicker's thugs) peeing in a corner.

When she also glances towards his groin region, Joe slaps the gun out of her hand, and pushes her off the balcony they're standing on. As she lies stunned on some rubbish, Joe laughs and zips up his pants.

-   _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_: Eddie Valiant goes to R.K. Maroon's office, claiming to have Marvin Acme's will, as a ploy to get him to confess to his part in Acme's murder.

    Literature 

-   _And Then There Were None_: When Vera Claythorne and Phillip Lombard find Dr. Armstrong's body washed up on shore they believe they are the only ones left on the island, so each thinks the other must be the murderer.

-   In _The Stand_, Stu disarms the guard sent to kill him by yelling that there's a rat off to the side. When the guy turns to look, Stu clobbers him with a chair. It stuns him long enough for Stu to struggle with him and eventually get the gun away before the guy can use it.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Parodied in the _Black Mirror_ episode "USS Callister": Daly and his crew are held at gunpoint by Valdack. Daly distracts Valdack by saying "Look! A naked lady!" which... works (Valdack asks "where?"), and enables him to attack back and disarm Valdack, who begs for death. In fact, this is because Valdack is another captive clone and he is neither capable of nor interested in hurting anybody. The absurdity of the premise is to show Daly's petty control of the clones and his obsession with remaking tropes from _Space Fleet_.
-   _Burn Notice_:
    -   "Pilot": Michael tells a man pointing a gun at him, "By the way, Vince, you're gonna have a hard time blowing my brains out with the safety on."

-   _The Punisher (2017)_: In Season Two, Frank Castle’s Teen Sidekick Amy, whom he taught how to disarm gunmen, takes advantage when a thug holding her hostage is looking away towards the stairwell Frank is approaching from, to disarm him and shoot him with his own gun.

    Video Games 

-   _Mass Effect 2_: In a close variant, at the climax of Thane's loyalty mission, his son Kolyat takes a local politician he was contracted to assassinate hostage at gunpoint. A Paragon interrupt lets Shepard shoot a lamp behind Kolyat to distract him, then rush and disarm him.
-   _Star Wars: The Old Republic_: When the Bounty Hunter PC catches up with Torian Cadera on Taris, he ambushes them, surprising them with a blaster pistol held to the back of the head. An option for the female PC is to turn around and flirtatiously remark that she just couldn't stay away from him after their previous meeting, which confuses the inexperienced-with-women Torian long enough for her to grab his arm, knock the gun away, and judo-flip him over her shoulder. (Male PCs who pick the corresponding conversation choice simply do the judo throw without distracting him first.)
    
    **Female Bounty Hunter:** _(holding him down with a boot)_ _Men..._ Time to tell me what you're doing out here.  
    **Torian:** Ow... I deserved that.  
    **Gault Rennow:** You must like him. If I tried that, I'd be wearing my face on the back wall.

    Web Comics 

-   Double Subverted in _Leftover Soup_ #943. Jamie is held at gunpoint by Roscoe Knight, who thinks Jamie killed his son Richard. Jamie recognizes the gun from earlier and asks Roscoe if he got a new firing pin for it, then grabs it out of his hands when he's distracted. Lucky the first thing he did was yank the slide back while the gun was still in Roscoe's hand, because the next page reveals the gun did receive a new firing pin.
    
    **Jamie:** Wow, I am _not_ as fast as I thought I was. You pulled that trigger, like, three times.  
    **Roscoe:** What the hell's the matter with you?
    

    Real Life
