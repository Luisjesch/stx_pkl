_"Soon you're gonna leave, so leave us one more weekend."_

A group of friends reach a turning-point in their lives, a moment when they're coming of age. What do they do? Go back to a favourite haunt and re-enact an important ritual from the life they are leaving behind.

Maybe they go to their regular pub or coffee shop for one last time, or spend a day or evening revisiting all their usual haunts and reminiscing. Whatever they do, it's made clear to the audience/readers that this marks a turning-point in their lives. They're growing up, moving on and they want to revisit their youth and fix this period of their lives in their memories before they leave.

    Real Life 

-   This is the original idea behind the Bachelor Party and the Bachelorette Party just prior to a wedding: nothing more than one last chance for a Boys' Night Out or a Girls' Night Out before the groom and bride transferred the focus of their lives from their friendship circles to each other. This is why, in some places, only the first person in the group to get married had a Bachelor's Party or a Bachelorette's Party, because, in effect, his or her marriage marked the end of that friendship circle as a male or female Band of Brothers or True Companions group.
-   High school and college graduation parties often have the feel of this, especially if the event involves one last ski trip or one last vacation together.

_Maybe tomorrow we'll find, to our sorrow  
Our story has come to an ending.  
Maybe we're fated to be separated  
Who knows where our paths might be bending  
How I wish we could stay here forever this way  
But perhaps there's no point in pretending  
If we're destined to head in our own different ways  
Let's make the most of these sweet final days  
Why not go out in a glorious blaze?_
