_"The double-ended laser sword. Now that is a **seriously** good way to cause major injuries to yourself. So you know anyone who dares to attempt to wield one of these suckers in battle is either incredibly good or incredibly stupid. And if they were that stupid, they wouldn't be standing in front of you with all four limbs still attached."_

A weapon that is either impossible, unlikely, or impractical in Real Life, but in fiction is both existent and effective, Rule of Cool be thanked.

Usually made of a bunch of cool weapons and mash them together, such as many examples of Mix-and-Match Weapon, or cranking up the weapon's abilities.

Naturally, this often relies on Artistic License – Physics.

The difference with Improbable Weapon User is that these are based on actual weapons, not non-weapon things used as weapons. A Flaming Sword would count as an impossibly cool weapon. A cardboard tube would count as an improbable weapon.

A Sub-Trope of Rule of Cool.

A Super-Trope to:

-   Absurdly Sharp Blade
-   BFG (most examples of it, so let's save space by leaving them there)
-   BFS
-   Flaming Sword
-   Freeze Ray
-   Fuuma Shuriken
-   Instant Chucks
-   Laser Blade
-   Lightning Gun
-   Macross Missile Massacre (in that a weapon fires more missiles than it should be able to hold)
-   Mix-and-Match Weapon (many Real Life examples are perfectly practical and reasonable, but fiction often dives headfirst into Rule of Cool)
-   More Dakka (any weapon capable of it)
-   Morph Weapon
-   Precision-Guided Boomerang
-   Ray Gun (especially before the invention of the laser)
-   Rocket-Powered Weapon
-   Swiss-Army Weapon
-   This Is a Drill
-   Whip Sword

A Sister Trope of Abnormal Ammo, Cool Sword, Exotic Weapon Supremacy, Improbable Weapon User, and Oddly Shaped Sword.

Compare Cool Starship, Impossibly Cool Clothes, Scary Impractical Armor, Awesome, but Impractical, Weaponized Landmark, and Things Are More Effective in Hollywood.

Compare/Contrast The Power of Index specifically the "(Weapon Name) Are Better" tropes (when normal weapons are impossibly cool by themselves).

Not to be confused with weapons that should overheat but don't.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The goddamn rocket-powered sledgehammer from _Battle Angel Alita_.
-   Many of the characters in _Blade of the Immortal_ use weapons that look incredibly cool... until you start asking questions about how they'd work in reality. The creator, Hiroaki Samura, hung a lampshade on this with the "Samura's Weapon Shop!" feature, which explains all the weapons, including the ones that don't make any sense. Examples: two sickles connected by an expansible chain ("The chain fits into one of the scabbards, and can stretch out to about seven feet. Whether this is good for anything is another question entirely."), a blade with little curved hooks on both edges ("What the hell is this thing? Don't ask me."), and two blades so narrow they look like kitchen skewers ("To be perfectly honest, I wonder why he doesn't just use a normal sword..."). Later, the sadistic Shira, who's had one hand cut off by Manji, makes up for this by (warning: squicky) _sharpening the protruding bone_ and using _that_ as a weapon. It works about as well as you might expect.
    -   Surprisingly, these examples work in real life: the chain-and-sickles is a variation of the traditional Japanese Kusari-gama, also used by Guilty Gear X's Axl (in the same two-sickle formation); the hooked blade can be justified by the additional damage caused by ripping action of the hooks upon cutting (the jagged edges of the wound heal slower), in the same fashion as soldiers who used to saw teeth into their bayonet blades; as for the narrow sword, almost all swords from the renaissance onwards were very thin, flexible blades, useful for only their stabbing action (they could only inflict superficial cuts, nothing like a medieval claymore).
    -   Other weapons are a sharpened handcuff but designed to cut necks on a chain and an L-shaped piece of metal. Even the author was surprised to find they were real weapons: a flying guillotine and a blunt ax.
-   Killy from _Blame!_ has the Graviton Beam Emitter, which looks like a small gun...that has recoil of cannon and firepower of a **DEATH STAR.** Oh, and that's pretty much the only weapon he uses. Needless to say, destruction, to both the city he is traveling in and his arm, ensues.
    -   At its lowest setting, the recoil causes Killy's arm to snap back while the projectile goes... well, we're not really sure what the range is, but nothing stops it until it reaches it. A full power shot causes Killy to go flying backward while things in front of him start blowing up. Also, Killy sometimes _Overcharges_ the gun which, when fired, _rips his arm off_ (though it's easily reattached).
-   _Bleach_:
    -   Ikkaku Madarame's Bankai Ryūmon Hōzukimaru, which turns his zanpakutou Hōzukimaru into that monstrosity of a weapon; all three blades give us one of the most creatively designed (and enormous) adaptations of a monk's spade seen in manga or anime.
    -   Most captains' Bankai are this. For examples, Soi Fon's Bankai "Jakuhō Raikōben" turns "Suzumebachi" into a huge stinger missile with amazing attack power, and Byakuya's Bankai "Senbonzakura Kageyoshi" manifests as a thousand blades that appear out of nowhere, which then dissolve and proceed to attack the target from all conceivable directions.
    -   Due to his Power Incontinence, Ichigo's unreleased sword "Zangetsu" is one of these. Five feet long, 8-10 inches wide at minimum and an inch or more thick, it would weigh 30-50 pounds if actually made of steel but he waves it around in one hand like a feather duster. His Bankai "Tensa Zangetsu" is the only form that actually makes his sword _smaller_.
    -   Word of God is that the characters can easily wave around such massive weapons because, as parts of their soul, the giant axes/swords/etc. are weightless to them (though not to other beings, who would indeed find themselves holding several dozen pounds of metal). That said, if the weight of their weapons end up multiplied (like by "Wabisuke's" Shikai ability), they won't be able to lift them eventually.
-   From _Buso Renkin_ we have Valkyrie's Skirt wielder Tsumura Tokiko.
-   In _Deadman Wonderland_, Genkaku's double Gatling-gun electric guitar. One of the creators even said in his blog that he isn't sure if it would even be possible in real life.
-   _Fairy Tail_'s Ten Commandments - a shape-shifting spear with elemental powers.
-   _FLCL_ has Haruko's Model 4001 Rickenbacker bass guitar, which doubles as a paddle, shotgun, rocket launcher, machine gun, **satellite-bashing baseball bat**, and hoverboard. Naota later gets a Gibson Flying V and later a Gibson EB-0, whose awesomeness stems from _being powered by a solar system-busting Space Pirate_.
-   The Goldion Hammer of _GaoGaiGar_. It's formed by Goldymarg, who can turn into a tank, turning into a giant fist holding an enormous golden mallet, which then attaches to the titular GaoGaiGar. The three-move combo that always follows on is: a giant nail made out of light is plunged into the enemy ("Hammer Hell!"); the nail is removed, tearing out the enemy's core ("Hammer Heaven!"); and finally the hammer hitting the enemy and turning them into tiny little motes of light ("TURN INTO LIGHT!").
    -   _GaoGaiGar FINAL_ manages to top that, though. How? The Goldion Crusher. An enormous energy hammer, made by combining _three_ spaceships, which are _individually_ larger than GaoGaiGar. Its hammerhead is made of Hard Light and localized gravitational shockwaves, and dwarfs the three ships' initial combined form in turn. It's so powerful that everyone aboard evacuated, except for Mikoto, who helped to operate it. It was built to assault enemies on the level of the Z-master, and is so dangerous that it requires a two-key activation system, _a la_ **nuclear launches**, just to initiate the three ships' combination. And it was used to destroy an enemy mech that was essentially a sun.
-   Alucard of _Hellsing_ has two guns, the latter of which is this trope personified. Known as "The Jackal", it's 39 cm or 16" long, 16 kg (or 35 pounds), and fires holy bullets that are powerful enough to explode entire walls. A real gun like that would be too heavy for a human to lift, and the recoil would likely snap his or her arm; but Alucard is a vampire, so he has the strength for it.
    -   There are several weapons that can be carried and used by a single human in that weight class, I admit all of them are two-handed weapons like medium MG's and multi-use anti-tank weapons (FN MAG can be fired while shouldered, it has a weight of 11.79kg empty, the ammo adds 4-5kg dependent on the belt length).
    -   Seras's _shoulder-mounted anti-zeppelin BFG._ The doctor prescribed some 30mm Harkonnen II goodness for those crazy Ghostapo mooks!
-   In _Jackals_, Nichol's weapon of choice is, er... well, completely fictional in design, resembling nothing so much as a grossly oversized bat'leth. He calls it "the Alligator", because of its jagged "teeth", colossal size, and ability to rip through human flesh like it ain't no thang.
-   In _Kamen Rider Spirits_, Skull Rider uses a bizarre weapon that's a combination of brass knuckles & a shotgun. It has shells in it that go off when you punch something. No explanation is given for how he manages to keep them from blowing his own hands off.
-   The Devices of _Lyrical Nanoha_. Some of them speak in Gratuitous English. Some of them speak in Gratuitous German. Most of them can switch from one kickass form to another. Most of them are Determinators in their own right, demanding Deadly Upgrades if they lose and even continuing to fight _even after their owner loses consciousness_. All of them are human-sized versions of Humongous Mecha weaponry that can — and do — take out Humongous Mecha.
-   The Escudo swords from _Magic Knight Rayearth_. They start off as impressive yet plausible, but Escudo weapons _evolve_. The design of the hilts alter with each new iteration and the swords are duplicated in large form by the Mashin. And the final form of Fuu's sword is longer than she is tall by a good foot and a half.
-   _Metal Armor Dragonar_ features one of the strangest sniper weapons in any Real Robot anime series: The Caulking Gun. To elaborate, it fires a shell that penetrates Humongous Mecha armor, then proceeds to inject a fast-hardening foam substance that damages computer systems, destroys circuit conductivity, and for the very unluckiest of victims, suffocates the pilots by filling the cockpit. Particularly effective since every robot in the series can fly, and is usually doing so.

-   _Outlaw Star_ has Grappler ships (including the ship of the title). Ships with arms. That tend to use giant, EVA-style knives. And similar melee weapons, including axes. And oversized handguns.
-   _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_ gives us Panty's pistol and Stocking's swords. Scanty's revolvers and Kneesocks' scythes aren't too far shabby, either. Neither is the heaven-piercing drill made of angelic lingerie from the final episode.
-   _Rave Master_'s Ten Commandments - a shape-shifting BFS with elemental powers.
-   _Reborn! (2004)_ has Lancia's giant flail, which can utilize air currents to inflict more damage as well.
-   The minor villain Cho from _Rurouni Kenshin_ has a whole collection of strange swords, including one that is several feet long and so thin it can be waved around like some sort of razor-sharp ribbon (this is an actual type of weapon, called Urumi).
    -   Cho shows that users of this weapon aren't instantly badass, though, as almost every strange weapon he pulls out is effortlessly beaten by Kenshin (only the Urumi poses any threat.)
-   A villain from _Samurai Champloo_ had a delightful kusarigama variant that seemed to violate several laws of physics. The scythe head shot off of the haft, propelled by springs, gunpowder or black magic and then retracted so quickly that the scythe somehow beheaded or bisected anyone in between it and the haft.
-   An episode of _SD Gundam Force_ features the Zakos showing off an "ultra space universe bazooka cannon gatling triple double wonderful drill super missile rocket machine gun gun gun". It ended up _actually_ impossibly cool because it completely fell apart upon trying to use it.
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ has the famous **\[\[GIGA!!!! DRILL!!!! BREAKER!!!!\]\]** - a drill\-based Finishing Move that just keeps getting bigger, much like the title mecha itself - and when said mecha is _63 billion light-years tall_, that's a pretty big fucking drill.
-   _Trigun_: Vash's angel arm. Apparently a large break-open, six-shot, low-barrel revolver — and one of really rather underwhelming power when you consider the size — turns on command into a gigantic laser cannon _with wings_ that can wipe entire cities off the face of the planet, or _put a large crater in the moon_, in a single shot. Runs on _life_.
    -   For that matter, the same series gave us Nicholas D. Wolfwood's "Punisher", a cross-shaped object wrapped in cloth which he claims is so heavy because it's "so full of mercy." It turns out that apparently Wolfwood considers "mercy" to be synonymous with "ammunition"; the Punisher is basically a (semi-)portable arsenal. One arm of the cross contains a rack of multiple Colt 1911s, the bottom portion contains a machine gun, the other arm most likely contains ammo for the machine gun, and the top portion contains a missile launcher. Wolfwood's mentor, Chapel the Evergreen, has his own Punisher, which splits in half to form _two_ machine guns.
    -   Other gun-based weapons in the show really make no sense. But who cares? They deliver.
-   _YuYu Hakusho_: In the semi-finals of the Dark Tournament Kirenja pulls out a big sword. Bui counters with a giant ax. Everyone is skeptical that Bui can wield it in time. It turns out he can.

And who can forget her razor-sharp tiara which she can throw like a boomerang?

    Fan Works 

-   Jason Shepard from _Sailor Moon: Legends of Lightstorm_ has a few of these thanks to his knowledge of advanced Moon Kingdom science:
    -   His main weapon is a staff that increases kinetic energy. It also collapses to the size of a pepper spray can and remains light enough to clip onto his utility belt.
    -   His main range weapons are enhanced shuriken strong enough to slice through rocket-proof armor. They can also be set to explode if he needs extra firepower.
    -   On his wrists he wears a pair of grapple gauntlets that he can fire at will. The metal tips will form into either a claw or a barb depending on what he fires them at, so he can grapple onto just about anything. The gauntlets have been used to tear out the brains of enemy drones.
-   _Sonic X: Dark Chaos_ features _Fuckslayer_, a demonic guitar with six necks wielded by Beelzebub. It's the very first guitar ever invented. Not only is it both a Lightning Gun and a rocket launcher, but the music it makes is so loud that it can shake _battleships_ apart.
    -   Jesus can create energy swords with his mouth - which is both this trope and a pretty cool biblical allusion to boot.
-   _Those Lacking Spines,_:
    -   **Jeffiroth** gets the coveted Masamune that Sephiroth wields. This is lampshaded.
        
        Unfortunately, a seven-foot katana, while cool-looking and certainly intimidating, is just not all that practical for a battle. Jeffiroth was able to attack with it, mostly by spinning around in a circle with his arms stretched out and hoping it would nick Xaldin, Vexen or Lexaeus enough to make them give up their unceasing barrage of wind, ice, earth, and stabbity-type attacks.
        
    -   It's even impractical for self-use.
        
        Unfortunately, a seven-foot-long katana, while badass and certainly intimidating, is just not all that practical for seppuku. What followed was a ten-minute display of Jeffiroth trying in vain to impale himself on a sword that was taller than he was, in full view of his choir and Nobuo Uematsu.
        

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In the _Blade Trilogy_ Blade has an extensive arsenal of custom weapons to dispense vampires with.
    -   An acid-etched silver-plated katana with a failsafe that cuts the hand off of anyone else who tries to use it.
    -   Shotguns modified to fire silver stakes at ballistic speeds.
    -   A retractable wrist dagger that dispenses an anti-coagulant which turns vampire blood explosive.
    -   Sunlight flash grenades and bombs that flood a small area with sunlight very quickly.
    -   The arch, a UV arc laser that puts out a beam hotter than the sun, and folds up to a convenient carrying size.
    -   In _Trinity_ the Nightstalkers use smart guns with ultraviolet ammo and built-in cameras so they can review fights after the fact.
    -   Also in _Trinity_ Abigail Whistler uses a bow with a holographic sight and camera so she can blind fire her trick arrows around corners and do impossible bank shots.
-   In Sylvester Stallone's vehicle _Cobra_, the director had the ultra-psychotic villain's bizarre knife<small>◊</small> custom-made, as he wanted "a knife the audience would never forget". His wish became reality to such an extent that actual steel replicas of the knife are now being made - never mind that carrying and pulling out a knife with a giant, almost-double blade and a handle full of sharp spikes without the use of velcro would result in one's clothes being torn to shreds every time.
-   It seems fitting that the director who gave us the _Iron Man_ movies made _Cowboys & Aliens_. The trailer shows Daniel Craig's character with an alien gauntlet attached to his wrist, and a holographic scope of sorts pops up; he aims it at an alien ship and takes it down. Then all the parts retract back into the gauntlet. The expression on the face of Harrison Ford's character is priceless. Especially since he is armed with only a six-shooter.
-   The alien weaponry in _District 9_. One of the less impressive ones is a cannon that fires a burst of compressed air. Which can knock a guy through a wall. Also, pig gun. There aren't enough weapons that kill your opponent with a _**goddamn pig**_.
-   _The Dragon Missile_: The eponymous weapon is a pair of twin curved swords whose handles are fashioned in silver dragon heads, whose razor-sharp tip can cut through wood, bone and solid objects with ease. It's also a Precision-Guided Boomerang which can be flung great distances to slice up fleeing targets, before returning to the thrower.
-   The ZF-1 from _The Fifth Element_ definitely qualifies, and doubles as a Swiss-Army Gun.
-   The Ghostbusters' proton packs, being man-portable "unlicensed nuclear accelerators" with the potential to destroy the world via crossing the streams.
-   Scarlett's crossbow from _GI Joe The Rise Of Cobra_. It has two bows, one on top of the other, like a double-barreled shotgun. It has _four_ Laser Sights, a hi-def camera to allow you to target specific body parts, and its arrows are somehow guided using the camera and onboard computers. Oh, and the arrows also explode.
-   Anything from _James Bond_, from his wristwatch/high-powered laser to Oddjob's sharpened bowler hat which can be thrown like a disc and cut off heads.
-   _Jonah Hex_ has dual-wielded crossbows that shot sticks of dynamite! And horse-mounted Gatling guns!
-   _Krull_ has the Glaive, a telekinetic ninja star with retractable blades. The Real Life weapon of that name is a type of polearm. However thanks to this film, anytime the word "glaive" is used, most people just think of this film's version of it, instead of the actual polearm.
-   _Master of the Flying Guillotine_: The infamous Flying Guillotine. Drop the basket on someone's head, pull the chain, and it's Off with His Head!.
-   The villain of _Phantasm_, the Tall Man, uses flying killer spheres to take out his enemies. They fly at you, stick into your head with twin blades that pop out, then they kill you by drilling into your brain, with the blood exiting through a hole in the back. And then there's the Golden Spheres that have the aforementioned extras, _additional buzz-saw blades_, _LASERS_, and can either possess people _or turn into them_. There's also Reggie's four-barreled shotgun, which he made himself by putting together two flip-open dual-barreled hunting shotguns in the second movie, and has continued using in all movies since.
-   _Sorority Row_ has the villain using a lug wrench with innumerable blades jutting out of it.
-   Most of the built-in weapons used during the Casa Cristo Classic in _Speed Racer_.
-   Whatever the hell The Octopus was using at the end of Frank goddamn Miller's _The Spirit_.
-   The lightsabers from _Star Wars_. Most frequent users, such as the Jedi and Sith orders, are essentially mystical psychics. The fact that they're telepathic, telekinetic, precognitive, and generally enhanced is meant to justify their usage of a weapon that'll kill you if you bump into someone.
    -   Asajj Ventress has been known to use paired lightsabers connected by a cable from time to time.
    -   In _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ Pre Vizsla wields the Darksaber, a black-bladed, lightsaber katana looted from the Jedi Temple centuries ago by one of his ancestors.
    -   There's also the double-bladed lightsaber, wielded by such characters as Darth Maul and Exar Kun. Especially interesting because its impossibly cool even compared to other lightsabers. It's hard to use, ridiculously dangerous, and not very useful. But, because no one ever uses it, no one knows how to defend against it, so it's actually a superior weapon. Crazy.
    -   The Inquisitors of _Star Wars Rebels_ one-up that with _spinning_ double sabers that also function as personal helicopters.
    -   And what's even more impossibly cool than an impossibly cool weapon? A weapon that _disables_ that weapon.
    -   "Lightwhips" are introduced in the Star Wars Expanded Universe; despite the name, they're not lightsaber-whips, they're electrified whips that can withstand a lightsaber's blade. Except for the ones that _are_ lightsaber-whips. Confused yet?
    -   In _The Force Unleashed_, Maris Brood uses a pair of lightsaber _tonfas_.
    -   Also, the Death Star. Okay, mass murder is not cool, but it still looks impressive.
    -   _Starfighters of Adumar_ introduces the blastsword, signature weapon of the Adumari. It's pretty much what it sounds like.
        
        **Wes:** So it's like a blaster you have to hit someone with. I have to have one.  
        **Tycho:** Don't give him a new kind of weapon! It would be like giving a lightsaber to a two-year-old!
        
    -   Chewbacca's "bowcaster," a cross between a laser gun and a _crossbow._ Or something like that. Looks really cool, and requires a bandoleer for some reason. It uses a magnetic field instead of a string to fire a metal slug at hypersonic speed like a Gauss Rifle and adds ionized plasma gas for armor-piercing capability.
    -   _The Force Awakens_ introduces a riot control tonfa - an electric tonfa resistant to lightsabers and delivering a painful electric shock. The stormtrooper wielding it obviously had training with it, handing Finn (wielding a lightsaber, but being completely untrained in melee combat) his ass easily.
        -   On a related note, _The Force Awakens_ also introduces the cross-guard lightsaber, in which the cross-guards are mini plasma blades that can both protect the users hands and cut into an opponent. Strangely, these kinds of lightsabers are rare in this franchise, despite being more practical weapons.
-   In _TRON: Legacy_, the discs are no longer neon Frisbees but awesome laser buzzsaw-chakrams that can be used in close-combat and can be thrown.
    -   And are still really something like process ID codes. Evidently, this is what happens when a video game designer's running the system.
-   Inverted Weapons in _Tenet_. While actually being typical guns and other ordnance that have been Temporally Inverted, the unique visual of bullet holes reforming into undamaged walls, sending a bullet flying back into the gun, is as Impossible and Cool as it sounds. If the user is Inverted, they will of course percieve the gun functioning as normal, but non-Inverted characters are also shown to be able to catch Inverted bullets at several points. And that's not even getting into the mind-bending effects of Inverted injuries.

    Gamebooks 

-   _Wizards, Warriors and You_: Among the weapons the titular Warrior can choose in this series by R. L. Stine, is the Triple Crossbow. The Triple Crossbow is shaped like an upside-down Mercedes symbol with 2 extra bolt slots pointing about 40 degrees away from the centre and can shoot bolts in 3 different directions as a mob control weapon. It should be an impractical weapon, but is actually one of the best choices for the Warrior and is a life-saver on many occasions.

    Literature 

-   Detritus's "Piecemaker" crossbow in _Discworld_. Detritus is a massive troll made of living stone and uses a 'crossbow' that was originally a wagon-mounted siege weapon that fired a six-foot iron bolt used to knock down doors. Later, Detritus started firing bundles of normal crossbow bolts tied together with some string, which breaks apart immediately after firing (the string _and_ the bolts), blotting out the sun. The much smaller bolts are fired with such velocity that they actually catch on fire from air friction.
    -   Whenever Detritus pulls this out, everybody stands behind him. _Everybody._ Those who don't are Not Very Lucky.
    -   "When mister safety-catch is not on, mister cross-bow is not your friend."
    -   When first firing it at the testing range, it took out the target, the targets on either side of the target, the earth behind the target, the ground, and a passing bird that was directly _above_ Detritus when he pulled the trigger.
-   Also from Discworld, Death's scythe. In one novel, Bill Door makes a replacement which gets sharpened on an increasingly-fine array of strops, including linen, silk, cobwebs, and eventually _sunlight_. It's so sharp that the edge glows faintly blue from air molecules bumping into it and getting cut in half.
    -   It's so sharp it _cuts the words on the page_ in half
    -   The various war machines designed by Leonardo da Vinci expy Leonard da Quirm half-qualify. The reason why he is not allowed outside — and the entire plot of _Men at Arms_ — is that, since he is a genius, his weapons are quite often not impossible enough.
-   _Heralds of Rhimn_ has Brightfate, a sunlit sword bloodforged by the sun god Gardhe himself. It radiates sunlight, burns, and absorbs the souls of those it kills to fuel its enchantment — and as if that wasn’t enough, if you kill a Herald with it, it will also kill the god they’re bound to.
-   _The Night Land_ and _Awake in the Night Land_ have the Diskos<small>◊</small>. They are tuned to the soul of their user and cannot be used by anybody else. On top of that, they can selectively hurt only monsters and not humans.
-   Neal Asher's _Gridlinked_ introduces us to Tenkian weapons, named after their designer. They're mostly low-tech thrown weapons, but with an AI embedded into them to aid in aiming and targeting.
    -   Main villain minion John Stanton gets a throwing knife that can be called up into his hand with a flick of his wrist; the character he gets it from says the AI will keep it from slicing his fingers off as he does so.
    -   The protagonist, Ian Cormac, has a shuriken that works on similar principles, but that can also expand up to 25cm across. (About the size of your average table saw blade.)
-   The title character of the _Sten_ series has a knife sharp enough to cut a diamond by the weight of the blade, fitted perfectly to his grip in a sheath installed _inside his arm_. It's described as having a wrist muscle redirected to hold the sheath closed, and will drop the knife into his hand whenever he needs it.
-   Damoren, the revolver of Matt Hollis in Ragnarok Publications' _Valducan_ is a holy revolver with a swordblade which can kill demons permanently but which only fires silver ammunition. It can also choose _not_ to fire when it's unhappy with its wielder.
-   In Stuart Hopen's _Warp Angel_, there are acid swords. The hilt projects a force field which contains and shapes a quantity of extremely corrosive acid into a "blade". This is an extremely dangerous weapon, capable of doing horrific damage to enemies and wielders alike.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Angel's sleeve stakes and Wesley's arm sword thingy.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   Buffy has her Slayer Scythe, a multi-purpose superweapon that only the Slayer can use, and is basically Vampire kryptonite.
    -   There is also Olaf the Troll God's Hammer, said to contain his godly power. Buffy used it to pound a previously thought invulnerable godlike entity into submission.
-   _Danger 5:_ In "Diamond Girls", the nuns who break into the World Bank have crucifixes that can shoot ammo.
-   The natives of the fantasy dimension from season 2 of _Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency_ do battle using bladed weapons that are essentially _giant scissors_.
-   The Master's laser screwdriver from _Doctor Who_. The laser screwdriver is a deadlier form of the Doctor's sonic screwdriver and a weapon that shoots out a laser beam that kills instantly and can rapidly age victims whose DNA it possesses.
    -   Prior to this, he always used a shrink ray called a Tissue Compression Eliminator. It didn't shrink you neatly, it _compressed_ (that is, _crushed)_ your tissues down to the size of a doll, so it was quite lethal, and left a teeny-tiny corpse. Regrettably, the show never addressed the fact that the doll-corpses should have been very _heavy..._ But, eh, so what? Rule of Cool.
-   _Farscape_: D'argo's Qualta Blade is a sword that works as a pulse rifle. Two weapons for the price of one!
-   Walter practically mentions the trope by name in reference to an anti-gravity pistol in the series finale of _Fringe_.
    
    **Walter Bishop:** If you shoot an Observer with this, they'll float away.  
    **Peter Bishop:** Why would we want them to float away?  
    **Walter Bishop:** Because it's cool.
    
-   On _Game of Thrones_, the Dothraki use a wicked-looking sickle-sword called an arakh. The sword's curved blade with sharpened outer edge is similar to other cavalry swords, though the sword itself looks more literally like a sickle, with a straight shaft that suddenly bends into a moon crescent blade partway up, making it look similar to a khopesh.
-   House (yes, that House) has a cane that transforms into an axe and a shotgun. Okay, it is just in a dream of his, but it is still impossibly cool.
-   _Xena: Warrior Princess_ has the chakram, a precision guided frisbee of death that can defeat entire armies. It actually existed, although it lacked the ability to cut through multiple people at the same time. Probably.

    Multiple 

-   Any variation of a shuriken that is larger than the user's own body, especially the "pinwheel" types with a cross-grip in the middle. This kind of shuriken tends to come back to the user, often striking several foes at once.
-   Any and all Humongous Mecha. Tanks: acceptable, Walking Tanks: Possible, although with limited applications. Humanoid Tanks the size of skyscrapers: Rule of Cool.
-   A sort of shovel-tipped longsword shows up in various places. It looks cool but is totally useless as a real-world weapon: the broad point prevents stabbing attacks from doing much damage, and it throws off the balance, making slashing attacks difficult. Existed in real life, but as a very specific tool for execution, not a weapon of war or for fighting.
    -   The greatswords in _Fable_.
    -   Vyse's Dream Cutlass in _Skies of Arcadia_.
    -   Some of the longswords in _Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind_.
    -   Odin's sword in _Final Fantasy IX_.
    -   In one of the _Slayers_ novels, Lina and Gourry are attacked by a group of battle homunculi wielding executioner's swords. Presumably in a similar fashion to meat cleavers.

    Music 

-   The Arrogant Worms _Let There Be Guns_ gave us this description: _"super-duper-automatic weapon with a CD-ROM drive, and a big old hard drive, and a big guitar amp so I can play BTOs..."_ And it's only a start of it, there's also mention of it shooting a little nerf rockets among other things.
-   Gloryhammer's second album, _Space 1992: Rise of the Chaos Wizards_ contains two examples where you have to ask what that's even supposed to mean:
    -   The "Crystal Laser Battle Axe" of the Astral Dwarves of Aberdeen.
    -   The Astral Hammer, "forged in the heart of the celestial fire" and "powered by lasers entwined in a star."
-   Fans of The Protomen wield the most intimidating weapon of all time: The chamethrawer, a chainsaw with a flamethrower attached to it.
-   If you're gonna hunt a "Turdy Point Buck" you'd best pack Betty Lou: A combination AK-57-Uzi-radar-laser-triple-barrel-double-scoped-heat-seekin'-shotgun.

    Pinballs 

-   The Glave from _Krull,_ a telekinetically-controlled throwing star with retractable blades.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In Pathfinder 2E, the inventor class can make their innovation subclass a weapon. Literally any combination of options will inevitably become this trope.
-   _1001 Science Fiction Weapons_ for D20, as the name might suggest, has so many weapons that a few of these end up appearing, including an entire section on weaponised yo-yos, a bladed staff with a circular saw at either end<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and a cannon which fires circular saw blades. If someone even has one, clearly they have issues. And now is not a good time to discuss them.
-   _Anima: Beyond Fantasy_ artwork has a good share of them (many are swords), that double as Cool Swords as well as BFS and require a good deal of Implausible Fencing Powers to wield them. The _Angelus_, gripped by Abel, may be the best example being huge and ornamented with feathered wings.
-   As a roleplay set in the world of _RWBY_, _Bay 12 RWBY Roleplay_ is full of these, including Maeve's Shadow Weave and Emeril's Panther.
-   From _Dungeons & Dragons_ the double axe, the two-bladed sword, the spiked chain, and _especially_ the dire flail.
-   The Valaes Tairn elves in _Eberron_ favour a double-bladed scimitar. Despite the inherent impracticality of this weapon, the Valaes Tairn pull it off, possibly because they're badass Elf Proud Warrior Race guys who will kill you if you point this out.
-   _Exalted_ has a fascinating variety of impossible yet awesome weapons. These range from the comparatively mundane (daiklaves, which are BFS's that would make Sephiroth jealous), to the slightly less plausible (the infinite jade chakram, which produces duplicates so you never have to actually throw it), to the straight-out absurd (gyroscopic chakrams, which are Captain America's shield as designed by Ash Williams). Any and all of this can be justified with magic. The kicker, however, is the Grand Goremaul. Imagine the Megaton Hammer tripled in size. In order to wield it, you need to use as much magical power as it would take to nuke a city, and also have a Strength of at least 4-one step below human maximum.
-   The artifact sword named Demonhealer from _GURPS: Dungeon Fantasy_ doesn't have a blade so much as it has a hole in reality that happens to be in the shape of a blade.
-   Several weapons in _Magic: The Gathering_ could count, but Worldslayer takes the cake. It's a sword that, on impact, **destroys the world.**
-   Most _Warhammer 40,000_ weapons fit this trope. The weakest weapon in the setting is a laser gun which can blow the arm clean off an unarmoured normal, and they just get bigger, and more awesome from there. For instance, the Ork gun which fires Snotlings THROUGH HELL into the target's brain. Chainsaw swords (and chainsaw fists). Demon-powered swords. Razor Floss cannons. Weaponised cutting torches which can shoot through tank armour. Molecule-thick shuriken shooters. Guns which fire needles of frozen poison. And so forth. And let's not forget that virtually all of the setting's weapons have versions which can be mounted to Humongous Mecha. And then, there's the Tyranids and their organic weapons systems...
    -   Don't forget the eponymous Bolter, which is basically a rapid-fire RPG in assault rifle form. Also comes in pistol size, to be wielded alongside the aforementioned chainsaw swords.
-   Bauhaus Jungle Kommandos from _War Zone_'s Tabletop Wargame use Big Freakin' Gatling Shotguns with two sets of barrels. Whoever gets hit by THAT, is in a world of hurt.

    Toys 

-   _BIONICLE_ has a ton of these, with most of their impossibly cool status deriving from a combination of size and ornateness. Some of the most notable ones are:
    -   Tahu's magma swords. He had a Flaming Sword, but that got replaced by a _pair_ of flaming broadswords that double as a surfboard.
    -   Onua Nuva's quake breakers. They are effectively a pair of chainsaws that can cut through rock and double as rollerblades.
    -   Nuju Metru's crystal spikes. Just look at 'em!<small>◊</small>
    -   About all the Piraka weapons, especially since they are multifunctional.
    -   Jaller's Sword a _Flaming Laser Blade_ that also comes with _lightning_. Yes, _A flaming lightning sword made of lasers_. Heck, every single weapon used by the Inika are basically "Lightning-infused Plasma, Laser, or similar" Weapon that's dual-wielded with a rapid-fire version of the regular Zamor Launcher used by the Piraka.

    Video Games 

-   _Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare_ had a triple-barreled shotgun and a double-barreled revolver.
-   _Anarchy Reigns_, the spiritual sequel to MadWorld, has an even more insane selection of weapons. This includes lightsabers on all limbs, a mechanical snowflake that contains freezing tracking missiles, and a whip that transforms into a spiky club. Jack's arm also now has _two_ chainsaws in it.
-   _Bayonetta_ has, well, nearly every damn weapon of the game.
    -   To list, normal handguns and shotguns, a demonic katana, a whip that's actually a snake demon, a pair of claws that can switch between fire and lightning modes, ice skates, rocket launcher tonfa, laser pistols, gun-chucks, a lightsaber, and rings which turn into every angelic weapon in the game. Did we mention that those guns, shotguns, bazookas and laser pistols come in sets of four, are all wielded at the same time and that two of each set are attached to the _heels_?
    -   _Bayonetta 2_ adds plant based double whips (Alruna), demonic scythe that shoots its own blades (Chernobog), gigantic thunder hammer (Takemikazuchi), living bow that shoots poisonous bugs (Kafka), bellows that shoot out streams of ice or fire (Undine) and a Chain-Chomp on a flail.
    -   _Bayonetta 3_ continues the tradition with an arsenal that includes, but isn't limited to, bladed yo-yos, massive chainsaws and a club/rifle hybrid.
-   Ragna The Bloodedge's sword in _BlazBlue_, the Blood-Scythe, looks more like a slab of metal in the shape of a cleaver than a sword, it has a cylinder and a trigger which makes the blade slide forth along an extender, turning it into a blunt scythe, and from that form it can fold back the blade and produce a much larger energy scythe. It also eats the soul of anyone slashed with it.
    -   It should also be noted that while cool weapons abound in the game's 'verse, most of them are sorted into a two categories; Ars Armagus and Nox Nyctores. The Blood Scythe is neither... In fact, considering the time loops that have resulted in Ragna inheriting the weapon from his future, time-displaced self, the weapon's existence itself is a paradox.
-   _Bloodborne_ has Trick Weapons, which are psuedo-realistic Morph Weapons.
    -   A shortsword that splits into two daggers.
    -   A metal cane that unfolds into a serrated whip.
    -   A foldable scythe with a giant curved sword for a detachable blade.
    -   Two longswords that can be inserted into their enormous metal sheaths to create a greatsword or a greathammer.
    -   A mace that can charge itself with electricity.
    -   Another mace that you can merge and grow with your blood by _impaling yourself_.
    -   A metal club that can be attached to a pair of huge circular saws to create a _motorized_ circular saw-axe.
    -   A scimitar which unfolds into a bow.
    -   A hammer with a miniature furnace in the head that explodes when charged.
    -   The still alive and sentient severed arm of an Eldritch Abomination which can be swung like a giant club or simply held out in front of the wielder and left to its own devices, attacking enemies with its scythe-like hand.
    -   An adorable alien parasite that does little more than act as a magic charm for your fists - until you infest yourself with Lumenwood, turning it into a plethora of insane attack tentacles that summon magic attacks by _crushing your skeleton_.
-   _Borderlands_ has a plethora of guns that, at best, simply should not work as well as they do and, at worst, violate the laws of physics. Some prime examples include a shotgun that _fires rockets_ and several special weapons that replenish their own ammo supply from nothing.
    -   In the first game, the basic Psycho enemy uses a handweapon that is basically an axe with a circular saw for a blade. Dr. Ned from the first DLC also uses it.
    -   Torgue guns, all of them shoots explosive rounds. This includes: pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, SMGs and even sniper rifles. The Assault on Dragon Keep DLC ups the ante with the SWORDSPLOSION!!! shotgun, which fires swords that explode. Into three smaller swords. Which also explode. Even better if you manage to get the coveted 'Casual' prefix, which causes the gun to shoot _three_ swords that explode into **nine smaller swords that then also explode**, carpeting the battlefield in explosions, or, even better, detonating right in the face of the enemy you originally shot at, making it a nearly One-Hit Kill on all but the most badass. It's one of most powerful weapons in the game.
    -   Tediore guns, which EXPLODE if you throw them, has SMGs that shoots like a bouncing betty. Even better, Tediore rocket launchers go blasting off when they're empty, thus becoming rockets themselves!
    -   Jakobs may be the only serious-business manufacturer of the whole lot — but that doesn't mean in the least bit their guns are any less cool, as they make up for it with exquisite craftsmanship, their high tier guns being made with ivory, gold, silver, precious wood and finely crafted details, and usually having the best accuracy and damage-per-shot of the game. They do have a few eccentric guns though — such as shotgun revolvers, assault rifles that fire cannonballs (they function like a grenade launcher), an assault rifle that's essentially a poor man's sniper rifle, a sniper rifle that fires six bullets like a shotgun, and a shotgun that fires electric tornadoes.
    -   Hyperion guns, GOLDEN guns with a futuristic design, loads bullets mechanically and increases accuracy the more you fire.
    -   Maliwan guns, which don't even use regular bullets — they use instead battery packs, and shoot pure elemental energy.
    -   Vladof, high priest of the Church of More Dakka, gives us their special rotating gatling-style barrel for pistols, assault rifles and sniper rifles. Unsurprisingly, Vladof guns with these have an extremely high rate of fire (only beat out by Jakobs, though that's because none of them are full-auto and can shoot as fast as you can mash the fire button). Their sniper rifles have the fire rate of an assault rifle with no accuracy loss, and are only held back from being total killing machines by the sniper rifle's comparatively small ammo pool. Heck, their more pedestrian variant of assault rifle muzzle has two barrels, unlike any other manufacturer.
    -   Atlas in _Borderlands 3_ now features guns with homing bullets — you paint your target with a tracker dart, and all your normal bullets will bend sharply towards your target. They look like impossibly super modern defense industry prototypes, and feature all kinds of gimmicks such as holographic displays or automatic reload mechanisms.
-   Neo Cortex's ray gun as well as N. Tropy's tuning fork, both from the _Crash Bandicoot_ series.
-   Hayden's Glaive from _darkSector_, you can even use the PS3 motion control to use it sometimes. (Though it's damn hard.)
    -   The weapon makes a return in the game's Spiritual Successor _Warframe_, along with a whole class of similarly behaving weapons.
-   _Dark Souls II_ features the Samurai Superboss known as Sir Alonne, who wields a katana as long as he is tall (and he's way larger than the Player Character). This katana has the distinction of being a classical depiction of a _zanbato_, combining an extra large handle and a lengthy blade, which makes it only practical for two-handing it. On top of that, it can power itself with Abyss magic by absorbing the blood of whoever it pierces.
-   _Dead Rising_ is a general parody of the Zombie Apocalypse genre in general, with incredible superweapons that shouldn't be capable of mowing through zombies, let alone function off Macguyvered scrap. From Dead Rising 2 onwards you can combine weapons to create new ones, and the results get more cartoonish as the series goes on. Examples include (but are not limited to) lightsabers, _working megabusters_, beer hats, chainsaw motorcycles, chainsaw _daggers_, flaming fireball-throwing scythes, steamroller motorcycles, fireworks skewer launchers, Elemental staves (powered by _batteries_ and _traffic lights_), dildo launchers, angry robot bears with LMGs, candy cane crossbows, zombie slingshot trucks, and all the way up to power armor that lets you create localized blizzards or tornadoes in front of you.
-   The Javelin from _Dead Space 2_ is a pneumatic spear gun. As if shooting mutated corpses with spears wasn't already cool enough, its alternative fire mode causes the last spear you fired to emit an electrical storm. Powerful, and useful for mopping up many smaller, weaker necromorphs such as The Pack. Even more awesome than that, once you upgrade the Javelin sufficiently enough, its alt fire mode now causes the spear to EXPLODE after the electrical charge in it runs out.
-   _Dead Target_ from VNG Game Studios has a number of real-life weapons and the outright Sci-Fi examples of 2040 A.D. technology, but the most impossibly cool weapon is the new Pinwheel Cracker. This incredibly busy example of 2040 firearms is equal parts whimsy and incredible firepower. A gun with a giant pinwheel that has a rack of six smaller pinwheels right behind. Shooting causes the first pinwheel to launch and it's a giant buzzsaw that sucks enemies into its whirling blades, this first pinwheel is also a giant timebomb that hits a wide area for tremendous damage and then launches some fireworks. Press the trigger again and the Pinwheel Cracker launches a salvo of the 6 smaller pinwheels which are fairly potent explosives shells. The moment that salvo launches then the remaining frame falls off and is revealed to be a spider robot that's a kamikaze drone which tracks and chases enemies down before acting its powerful proximity bomb. The Pinwheel Cracker can also be used as a powerful melee weapon that shreds enemies that come too close to your front.
-   The _Devil May Cry_ 'verse has many:
    -   In _Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening_ you get Nevan, a frickin' electric guitar **scythe** that shoots out purple lightning and bats. And which used to be a massively hot succubus. And before that, Cerberus, a three-sectioned nunchaku made of ice.
    -   _Devil May Cry 4_ has Pandora's Box, a demonic firearm manifesting as a briefcase capable of morphing into a variety of heavy weapons. A crapload of forms and they're all awesome. Also Lucifer — bright pink exploding energy spears, anyone?
    -   On the slightly more mundane (but still strange) front, we have the weapons of the Order: a sort of revved-up flame/vibro-sword for Alto Angelos (and Nero), and the equally insane _rocket-powered lance_ wielded by the Bianco Angelo armor suits for jet-propelled lunges.
    -   _DmC: Devil May Cry_ reworks Dante's Rebellion sword into a weapon with multiple forms. Its default form is still a sword, but it can turn into a set of shurikens and a scythe (for his angelic side), a pair of fists and a heavy axe (for his demonic side), and a Grappling-Hook Pistol (for both sides).
    -   _Devil May Cry 5_ cranks up the insane awesomeness, even for this series. Nero's new Devil Breaker that replaces his Devil Bringer arm can stop time, function as a Swiss-Army Weapon complete with grappling hook that he can then chain into a powerbomb on unfortunate demons; and _can be fired away and surfed on._ Dante, never one to be outdone in his own series, gets a demonic motorcycle that's a functioning and usable _devil arm. As dual chainsaws_.
-   Kaptain K Rool's blunderbuss in _Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest_. It can fire cannonballs, sure, but it can also... suck in objects, fire spiky mines, fire mines that bounce across the screen, fire mines that rotate and fly around, sometimes in pairs, fire barrels that rotate and fly around, be used as a sort of engine, fire gasses that freeze Kongs in place, reverse the controls and slow them down, and it even manages to turn K Rool invisible.
-   The _Russian Overkill_ mod for _Doom II_ has giving you these as its modus operandi. Also counts as Awesome, yet Impractical, because saying some of these are portable nuke launchers, and that you can easily kill youself with them without God Mode on, is, in no way, hyperbole.
-   In addition to chainswords, _.hack//G.U._ has Azure Kite's weird triple-bladed swords. They look like they'd be hard to handle with just two arms, but hey. Slightly justified by characters in _.Hack_ being virtual avatars in a game being controlled by players at a computer. So the laws of physics and coordination need not necessarily apply. Furthermore Azure Kite himself is an A.I. in the system, so they definitely don't apply to him.
-   _Dungeons of Dredmor_ has waaaay too many to list, what with the massive amounts of weaponry that is either a reference, amusingly weird, or both. But some examples are a dagger that looks more like a metal bush, because the blade branches and branches until every tip's a single atom sharp, and thus stabs a zillion times each thrust, a seriously big pole with six axe blades, three on each end stacked vertically, making for something like a macahuitl made of axes, a double-chainaxe with two running edges at the front, which sometimes swings itself at foes for an extra blow, and a quadruple razor sword, like a giant's shaving tool which you swing around without the plastic clutter, "for when you really, really, really, really need to be sure". That's just the _start_, by the way.
-   _Enter the Gungeon_ lives in this trope. It has t-shirt cannons, t-shirt cannons that fire poison shirts, a unicorn horn that fires a rainbow laser and plays music, a demon's head that shoots a fire beam, a wood beam that is exactly what it says; a piece of wood that grows to the length of the room you're in and lets you smack enemies with a melee weapon at a gun's range, a baseball bat that returns bullets to the shooter, a gun that looks like two brick cubes stuck together that fires turtle shells, a block of meat that fires saw blades, a lower-case r that fires the word 'bullet' one letter at a time that when upgraded with explosive bullets fires the words 'boom', 'explosion' and 'rocket', and a bullet that shoots guns that shoot bullets. You heard me.
-   _Etrian Odyssey IV: Legends of the Titan_ and _Etrian Odyssey Nexus_ have Drive Blades, which are huge blades that are used by the Imperial class and motorized to inflict a massive amount of damage to the enemy in one swing. The only downside is that using them will lead to a necessary cooldown period to attack with the again, though upgrading certain skills will reduce that time.
-   _Fallout_:
    -   The earlier games have the Super Sledgehammer, a giant sledgehammer with a rocket built into the head. Start it swinging and press the button and foosh! It's capable of knocking someone down and sliding them literally a full city block.
    -   The Fantasy Ball from _Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel_. Sole possible explanation for its existence: designed to weird the hell out of anyone in sight, thus compelling target to waive Agility bonus.
    -   _Fallout Tactics_ also has a weapon called the punch gun.
    -   Some craftable weapons from _Fallout 3_; namely, the Railway Rifle. It's a steam-powered cannon that launches railway spikes with such force that a kill instantly dismembers and pins the affected limb to the nearest hard surface behind the target. And as an extra, firing the weapon produces a train whistle.
    -   The Rock-It Launcher. Anything that can turn stuffed animals into insta-gibbing projectiles is automatically awesome.
    -   The Ballistic Fist from _Fallout: New Vegas_ is a shotgun welded to the top of gauntlet, with a pressure pad as a trigger. It is also the most damaging unarmed weapon in the game.
    -   Thanks to the Gun-Runner's Arsenal content pack, we now have the Ballistic Fist's big brother, named 'Two-Step Goodbye': killing shots implant a _live grenade_ in the target.
-   _Far Cry 4_ has a few of these. One of which is a pistol-sized, automatic crossbow that fires silent bolts from a helical magazine. Another, offered as part of a DLC, created by resident lunatic Hurk is a hand-held version of a harpoon gun normally mounted on the bows of whaling ships. Yet another is...a humble chunk of meat. When thrown, said chunk of meat nearly instantly summons nasty predators to kill enemies for you.
-   _Fate/stay night_ features Ea, The Sword Of Rupture, Gilgamesh´s drillsword and the single most powerful weapon in the Nasuverse, which comes from it´s ability to rotate so fast that it literally breaks the world around it apart, destroying anything in the vague direction it´s pointed at, including the world itself if it´s given enough time to charge. Even at an absolutely minimum of it´s power it can easily overpower Saber´s Excalibur, the supposedly strongest sword. On top of all that,it looks fucking awesome.
-   Gunblades in _Final Fantasy VIII_ are a cross between BFGs, BFSs, and Vibroweapons. Unlike most examples, the impossibility is acknowledged in-universe - it's so difficult to master that only the most dedicated soldiers can hope to use it. In-universe, it's speculated that the main character, Squall, uses it _because_ it's so difficult to learn how.
-   _Final Fantasy XIII_ seems to be made of this trope, along with a reappearance of the aforementioned Gunblade, we're also introduced to Twin Guns that combine into an Assault Rifle, a Giant Folding Battle Boomerang, a Double-Ended spear that breaks apart into a Three-Segmented Nunchaku, and some sort of... Staff-whip Fishing Pole... thing.
    -   This Gunblade is different from _Final Fantasy VIII_'s in that it transforms into a sword or gun, but not both at the same time. Also, it uses bullets instead of vibration when fired.
-   A tradition of the Infinity+1 Swords of the _Fire Emblem_ franchise:
    -   _Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade_ features Armads, Durandal, and Sol Katti (Armads being a gigantic thunder axe which causes tremors when it touches the ground, Durandal a gigantic sword of "sacred fire", and Sol Katti just a really long katana).
    -   _Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade_ has Eckesachs, Zephiel's sword/trident, which he uses just as a sword, in addition to the aforementioned Durandal and Armads.
    -   _Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance_ features Ragnell and Alondite, a twin pair of holy BFSs once dual-wielded _by a slim, petite Lady of War_.
    -   _Fire Emblem Fates_ has the Omega Yato, otherwise known as the Fire Emblem, which you only get near the end of the Golden Path. It's a flaming chainsaw-sword fusion with the power to kill a god, which you then proceed to do so with.
-   _Gears of War_: The Lancer, a Chainsaw-Machine Gun hybrid. For buyers of the Limited Edition of _Gears of War 2_, it comes in a _solid gold_ variety.
-   _Gift_: The Shadow Gun. It should be armed at shadows of enemies or objects. Somewhat downplayed since it only freezes enemies and doesn't kill.
-   _God of War_. Swords. On retractable chains! That CATCH FIRE when you fling them around! And Kratos dual-wields them.
-   _Guild Wars_ has "The Dreamer" a legenday bow that looks like a butterfly wing forged into a bow... And shoots _Rainbow trailing unicorns_.
-   Sol Badguy's sword in _Guilty Gear_: _Xrd_, the "Junkyard Dog Mk. III", looks like a giant gas lighter, has a small motor built into the grip, and apparently loads incendiary shells that imbue the sword with fire elemental attacks. It's just a protective casing for Sol's trusty old Fireseal sword, which slides back and opens up like a dragon's maw and then unleashes the blade's monstrous power on his hapless opponent during his Instant Kill.
-   _Heavenly Sword_:
    -   One of the playable characters, Kai, had a HUGE crossbow that fired like a Gatling gun. It also had unlimited ammo and had arrows that could actually be guided directly into an enemy's skull from a kilometer away.
    -   The titular Heavenly Sword was also fairly cool, a pair of curvy ornate swords that could also be attached together into one big powerful two handed sword or strung out on chains and whipped around for _God of War_ style long range attacks.
-   _Hellgate: London_ is full of these. Every weapon the Cabalists can use is one, notably ones that shoot bees or tentacles. The Hunters get more conventional firearms, but even they can play with a rifle that fires electrified spinning sawblades that explode.
-   The XADA Destroyer from _Implosion_ shoots stationary spinning discs with lasers that can kill all but the strongest monsters who wander into their radius, but ignore your WarMech. It's so powerful its ammo is limited to three shots. Runner-up would be the Singularity Gun, which shoots _black holes_ and is limited to 8 shots. Earning enough badges unlocks the unlimited versions of these weapons.
-   _Jet Force Gemini_ gives each of your characters their own _tri-rocket launcher_ relatively early in the game.
-   Parodied by _many_ _Kingdom of Loathing_ weapons, most blatantly with the Ridiculously Overelaborate Ninja Weapon, which grants a +15% chance of landing a critical hit, and a _+200%_ chance of fumbling.
    
    Well, it's definitely a weapon of some sort. It consists of four long blades, three wooden poles, six steel chains, and an assortment of spikes. You have absolutely no idea how to use it, but it looks totally badass.
    
-   _League of Legends_:
    -   Many weapons qualify, though Jarvan IV's lance takes the crown. It is a giant lance that can launch its head at a target point where it falls from the sky and deploys a banner of Demacia, raising the courage of his allies. It can also extend to about the range of a frickin' arrow in order to impale all enemies in front of him and break their armor. If this connects with his flag, it pulls him to the flag and flips the enemies in his path into the air.
    -   Another League example: Jayce's hammer, his own invention, which transforms back and forth between a melee hammer and a ranged energy cannon, with abilities to match. A lot of League is like this, though, from Caitlyn's home-made sniper rifle, to Riven's massive, broken sword.
-   _MadWorld_:
    -   The main character, Jack Cayman, has a retractable chainsaw in his prosthetic arm.
    -   The boss Von Twirlenkller has air turbines for arms.
-   The cast of _Mana Khemia_ use weapons that range from cool to downright improbable, among them Nikki's giant hammer with retractable dual flails for a head, electric drill claws for Pamela's possessed teddy, and Flay's shuriken-launching mechsword. The sequel adds Enna's Power Fist and Et's bladed hula hoop, complete with dual and bow forms.
-   _Mass Effect 2's_ M-490 Blackstorm, a black-hole gun.
    -   And if you thought that was impressive, try swinging around a pseudo-nuclear cannon that can cause a mushroom cloud on impact and take down minor Reapers in one shot. That's the M-920 Cain, for you.
    -   Not to be outdone, the heavy weapons in the sequel are pretty impressive: aside from the triumphant return of the M-920 Cain, there's the Geth Spitfire (a rotary plasma gun), the Reaper Blackstar (basically the Blackstorm, but as built by the Reapers), and the M-560 Hydra (which shoots eight rockets at once).
    -   There's also something of an arms race in _Mass Effect 3_'s sniper rifle category. The second game's M-98 Widow anti-materiel sniper rifle is only the start. Upgrades include a semi-automatic Widow, the Geth Javelin, which shoots "beams" of red-hot molten iron, and the M-90 Indra, which shoots ordinary bullets but is fully automatic (the only full-auto sniper rifle in the game, in fact). Then DLC came around and things went a little crazy: _Resurgence_ brought the Kishock Harpoon Launcher, which sometimes instantly kills humanoid enemies on a headshot regardless of damage, then _Rebellion_ featured the Krysae sniper rifle, which fires _explosive bullets_, and finally _Retaliation_ dropped in the Collector Sniper Rifle, which has modest performance but automatically regenerates ammo by nature of being a semi-organic gun that fires lasers.
-   Most of the weapons from the _Mega Man_ series. Hell, ALL OF THEM.
    -   Excluding Top Spin. Nobody likes Top Spin. Until you need it to beat the final boss, anyway. Except in _Smash 4_, where it works properly and is as deadly as the others.
    -   Zero's Z-Saber may be a simple Laser Blade, but then you see it turning into an electric blade or an ice blade for his moves.
    -   Acid Ace from _Mega Man Star Force 3_ wields a Ray Gun with a built in Laser Blade, which can also shoot a bunch of other attacks at you.
-   _Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance_
    -   Jetstream Sam's high-frequency katana would be totally mundane for the setting, if not for the fact that its sheath is actually a _gun_ that fires the katana out of it for insanely fast quick draws. Did we mention that Sam is an Iaijutsu Practitioner?
    -   There's also L'Étranger, a spear made out of interconnected robot arms that doubles as a whip, and Bloodlust, a pair of giant machetes that both Sundowner and Raiden wield like a pair of giant scissors thanks to an additional mechanical arm attached to their wrist. There's even a chainsaw axe that's SO BIG, that the person wielding it had his body attached to a giant robot just so he could use it.
    -   LQ-84i uses a chainsaw on a _whip_, which is evidently capable of cutting through a whole building.

-   _Monster Hunter_ is all about this trope. Serrated BFSs with teeth that fold into the blade when not being wielded, giant telescoping Jousting Lances, and giant collapsible crossbows that worked more like BFGs are par for the course. As if that wasn't enough, there are several weapon types that are this trope, as well. This includes Gunlances, lances with built-in shotguns that can fire enormous dragon-fire explosions, Switch Axes, large mechanical axes that can transform into giant swords, and Charge Blades, a sword-and-shield combo that can combine to form a humongous axe, which can fire off pure elemental energy and further power up into a giant _buzzsaw_ axe.
-   The melee weapons in the Xbox/PS3 _Ninja Gaiden_ games mostly avert this since they are inspired from real weapons in the first place (apart from one or two BFS). Except the Vigoorian Flail: a pair of chained sickles used like a nunchaku, that would be far too dangerous to use in Real Life. There is also the Plasma Saber Mk. II, a high frequency electrified sword (although gameplay-wise it's every bit identical to the True Dragon Sword). And of course, being a Ninja game, the projectile weapons are mostly this, from explosive kunai to Fuuma Shuriken, let alone a gatling spear gun and a portable cannon. When you upgrade the Lunar Staff fully, on each end of the staff are maces that flail about on a chain.
-   _No More Heroes_: The final five-ranked assassins in the first game come at you with a portable brain-powered earthquake generator, a magic show, a Wave-Motion Gun disguised as a shopping cart, the aforementioned lightsaber dragon, and... a wooden baseball bat. And the assassin who totes that last one is by far the deadliest of the bunch.
-   _No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle_: The tutorial boss uses a revolver that _revolves revolver cylinders._ It gets crazier from there: There's a boom box/rocket launcher that transforms into a giant pair of robot arms, a flamethrower axe, a pair of sniper rifles/scythes, a double beam katana/recorder that shoots deadly bubbles, a pair of guns that shoot money, a giant football-themed robot, an improved, upgraded version of the first game's brain-powered quake-maker, and a backpack covered in waldoes, most of them with lightsabers on the end. It even delivers on the lightsaber dragon from the first game somewhat with a beam naginata that summons giant laser dragons. There's also the Peony, a beam katana that grows in length with the user's fighting spirit, until it's longer than Travis is tall.
-   _No More Heroes III_: Since many of the ranked assassins, mooks and minibosses are extraterrestrial beings with unique superpowers, this trope has a smaller presence as many of them don't need weapons. But Gold Joe, the 9th-ranked assassin, has four of his six limbs equipped with well-crafted, culb-like swords. Also, Sniping Lee has a large rifle he can use to kill targets with perfect accuracy, though he gets killed by asupporting character shortly before the reveal of the true boss of that rank chapter.
-   _Outriders_ has the Legendary weapons. Each of them, in addition to the most powerful Tier III mods, has a distinctive, often very weird appearance. For example, there are guns that look like they're carved out of stone, a sniper rifle that's encased in ice and a submachine gun made out of _meat_.
-   Literally almost every weapon in _Painkiller_ is based around this trope. To wit:
    -   Your main melee/ranged weapon, the eponymous Painkiller, is essentially a horizontally held weed whacker that can be sent flying through enemy ranks, blades spinning. Secondary fire launches the spinning blade forward and then pulls it back, tethered to the gun by a beam of energy that also damages anything it touches.
    -   Your standard garden-variety shotgun, which can not only freeze your enemies, but packs enough of a punch to send them flying into the air.
    -   A gun that shoots yard-long wooden stakes through the air at high speeds, that spontaneously burst into flames after a moment which can pin enemies to walls by their limbs. The secondary fire shoots grenades, and you can shoot the grenades with the stakes to create a long ranged explosive projectile that impales the enemy, and then explodes.
    -   A rocket launcher and minigun _combined into the same weapon_.
    -   And lastly, the Electrodriver, a gun that shoots shurikens and lightning. And even shurikens which themselves shoot lightning.
-   The FarSight from _Perfect Dark_, an alien laser rifle. One-Hit Kill, unlimited penetration and equipped with a scope that can _see through walls and doors and automatically track people._ You literally just have to sit back and pull the trigger. The only downside is that the firing rate is very slow.
    -   The RCP-120, which has a magazine of 120 bullets, an insane firing rate and _comes with its own cloaking device_. Yes, you can also use it to become invisible.
    -   There's also the laptop gun, itself a 50 shot assault rifle. But you can also throw it at a nearby wall, where it'll set itself up as a sentry turret and kill your enemies for you.
-   The Evoker from _Persona 3_. It's basically a pistol. Except instead of using it to shoot people, you point it at your head and use it to summon the physical manifestation of your psyche.
    -   It's much more convenient for awakening the offensive manifestation of your soul than some bow and arrow, after all.
-   _Power Stone 2_ had the so called '3-way shotgun' and its powered up version, the 5-way shotgun. Of course.
-   Just about _every_ weapon in the _Ratchet & Clank_ universe is impossibly cool. The first ads for the games even showed how they just wouldn't work in real life. Of particular note is the RYNO <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  series of weapons, which only get bigger and more ridiculous as the series goes on. All of them are considered Purposely Overpowered and generally function as the Infinity +1 Sword. The first RYNO shoots nine homing missiles. The RYNO II fires blue laser shots that instakill tanks. The RY3NO fires a swarm of homing energy rockets and can be upgraded into the RYNOCIRATOR, which simply reduces everyone around you to ash. The Harbinger (_Deadlocked_'s version of the RYNO) is basically a Kill Sat, with its upgrade (the SuperNova) being _a rainbow-colored orbital bombardment_. The RYNO IV is a Wave-Motion Gun. The RYNO V fires a flurry of rockets and plays the 1812 Overture while fired, with additional homing rockets fired at musically-appropriate points.
    -   In _Rift Apart_, the RYNO 8 tears space-time itself to the point it can open huge portals to other dimensions bringing stuff from there as well.
-   _Resident Evil 5_ also has a triple-barreled shotgun.
-   _Resident Evil 4_: The Mercenaries minigame features enemies that wield _double-bladed chainsaws that are on fire_.
-   _Bulletstorm_ has the Boneduster - a four-barreled shotgun, the Penetrator (a literal drill-gun) and the Flail-Gun (a gun that shoots two grenades chained together).
-   The _Saints Row_ series typically has some weird weapons and Lethal Joke Items thrown in, but _Saints Row IV_ just goes nuts with this. It helps that the game takes place in a virtual world, so the weapons don't have to make any sense, because they're not even real in-universe anyway. Notable examples include the Abduction Gun, which produces an UFO-style light beam to suck enemies into the sky, the Singularity Gun, which fires black holes, and the famous Dubstep Gun, which shoots weaponized dubstep music.
-   Honda Tadakatsu from _Sengoku Basara_ wields a drill-tipped spear almost as tall as he is as his primary weapon. It can later be upgraded to have three separate drill tips. Mori Motonari uses a giant ring-blade that can separate into two curved swords. Chosokabe Motochika uses a giant anchor-flail that can be detached and swung around on a chain and is frequently on fire. And then there's Tachibana Muneshige, who dual-wields _chainsaws_.
-   Bentley's Cool Chair from _Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves_, which can fire rockets and has a jetpack.
-   _Sunset Overdrive_ includes a bowling ball launcher, vinyl record gun, toy helicopters with pistols attached to them, and teddy bears strapped with dynamite as part of your arsenal.
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   Some games gave Bowser Jr. Junior Clown Car, a bowl-shaped vehicle with a propeller on the bottom and more weapons inside of it than could feasibly fit.
    -   Bowser himself in _Super Mario RPG_ gets armed with a Chain Chomp, i.e a living flail that can bite enemies painfully.
-   _Super Smash Bros._: The Dark Cannon.
-   Some weapons in the _Tales Series_ qualify when they're not verging on ludicrous. Hubert's...weapon...thing in _Tales of Graces_ leaps to mind. It's a dual-bladed sword that can separate into two regular swords. And a pair of handguns. Which fire bullets made of magic. And it can also shoot arrows like a bow. No wonder it gives the wielder INSTANT BALLS. Malik of the same game has a BOOMERANG SWORD. He throws it... and it flies back.
    -   Hubert is slightly explained by it being a custom weapon he personally designed to be over the top to give off the image as a bad ass military warrior to inspire fear in his enemies and morale in his subordinates. It was actually based off a weapon from his universe's equivalent of Batman. He spent years training himself to become proficient and make it an effective weapon. In other words he was intentionally invoking this trope and struggled hard to make it work.
    -   _Tales of Vesperia_:
        -   Yeager weirlds a _shotgun scythe._
        -   Raven's weapon of choice is slightly less "cool", but it's a bow that can fold up into a short sword for close combat.
    -   Marta from _Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World_ the sequel wields a ring with a pair of blades poking out of it, or a ring with three blades poking out of it. Which apparently spin without a motor, which would realistically render this weapon even more useless than it already it. Not that that stops her from extremely long combos in melee and cutting down foes left and right.
-   Many weapons in _Team Fortress 2_. The Soldier has a semi-auto rocket launcher, the Heavy has several 150-kilogram minigun that can kill in a second, the Medic has a chaingun that shoots blood-sapping syringes and a bizarre mix of a saw, a short sword, and a hypodermic needle, the Spy has a Hand Cannon with the Scout's mom on it, the Scout has a shotgun with enough kick to send his target and him flying ten feet, the Engineer has his turrets, the Pyro has an ax covered in barbed wire that instakills people on fire, an ax that has a superheated coil for a blade that atomizes opponents, and a flamethrower shaped like a dragon, the Demoman has a sticky bomb launcher with so much firepower, the programmers referred to them as "winbombs", and the Sniper has a jar of piss that causes people to lose the will to live.
-   Damn near everything in the _Turok_ series is one of these. Among them are a gun that shoots land mines that shoot up and shoot out a ring of shrapnel at roughly knee-height, a gun that launches energy helices that carbonize foes and cause them to explode seconds later, and the cerebral bore, which fires an orb that embeds itself in your enemy's head. Then it starts digging. Then it blows up.
    -   On that note, the Cerebral Bore, plus nearly half of the Turok series' other weapons. Remember the _minimum_ of three barrels per rocket launcher? The landmines specifically designed to amputate at the shin? The electrified shotgun that can put the same bullets through a single target six times over? The rocket-propelled sledgehammer? The precision-guided boomerang _chainsaw_? That gun that desiccates enemies and leaves behind jerky? The sticky, radioactive flares that slowly microwave people?ks the unlimited versions of these weapons.
-   _Two Worlds II_: About a third of the weapons that come with blades (as well as many of those that don't), with the second third consisting of almost game breaking ones, and the last third based strictly on actual historical weaponry.
-   The titled protagonist of _Ty the Tasmanian Tiger_ has different types of boomerangs.
-   Most energy weapons in _Virtual-ON_. Homing beams, beam swords, homing beam swords, anti-ship cannons, heart shaped beams, circle beams, scythes— anything is possible. Temjin has a beam rifle that doubles as a beam sword.
-   _Warcraft III_:
    -   The game has the same weapon as the _Krull_ example above (with the same name) but increased to the size of a human torso. Throwing it (or launching it out of a massive slingshot) is apparently not a problem.
    -   Even more confusingly, Illidan's weapon of choice, the Twin Blades of Azzinoth<small>◊</small> are also called glaives, even though they're more like two curved swords attached to the opposite sides of the same hilt. He took them from a demon he killed. The glaives in question had the option of detaching into the two blades, but Illidan just prefers to use them like that all the time. In _World of Warcraft_, he has a pair of them, for a total of four blades. Similar weapons are exclusive to the group he leads, the demon hunters.
-   Many of the swords in _World of Warcraft_. Either they're ridiculously huge, they look like they were designed by Kit Rae in collaboration with Fred Flintstone and a Taos jeweler, or both. Truth in Television: It should be noted that Kit Rae's fantasy weapons are for display purposes only.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles 1_:
    -   The game revolves around the Monado. A cool Laser Bladed BFS Of Combat Clairvoyance And Plot Advancement. Try to compete with THAT. Never mind that it's basically the embodiment of the game's main antagonist — the soul of the titan you live on and your planet's long-forgotten god.
    -   Riki uses biters as his weapon of choice. They're essentially maces with heads in the shape of that of various animals, and he attacks by making the head bite enemies. While his starting one looks extremely silly, the later ones come in the shape of cool animals like lions and dragons.

    Web Animation 

-   _RWBY_: This urban fantasy-meets-sci-fi show focuses on the training of "Huntsmen" to protect civilisation from the monsters that go bump in the night. Almost all the combat-capable characters have complex weapons that can perform a variety of functions, including transformations into different types of weapons or weapon-combinations. Rooster Teeth lampshaded this with a t-shirt showing off many of the weapons framed around the phrase "It's also a gun", highlighting that most weapons in the show also double as guns. Examples include:
    -   Weapons that masquerade as one weapon before transforming into something else: examples include Qrow's huge sword, which can tranform into a gun-sword and scythe; the Grimm Reaper's twin kama that can combine into a dual-bladed staff.
    -   Weapons with multiple transformations that can sometimes be used in combination: examples include Ruby's customised scythe/sniper rife; Blake's sword, which can transform into a gun and a gun-sword-flail on the end of a ribbon; and Sun's staff, which becomes two nunchaku, which can simultaneously be used as _four_ lever-action shotguns.
    -   Weapons that don't look like weapons until used or transformed: examples include Blake's sword-sheath which can be used as a cleaver; Jaune's sword-sheath, which expands into a shield and can become a two-bladed weapon when the sword is sheathed; Coco's satchel, which transforms into a mini-gun; Neo's parasol, which is a cane-sword and shield; or Flynt's trumpet which uses Wind Dust when played.
    -   Non-transforming weapons that have surprising functions: examples include Weiss's rapier that contains a Dust revolver for ranged elemental attacks; Roman's cane, which is secretly a gun; Raven's sword, which is a sheath containing multiple Dust blades, and her sword handle can select which blade to use.

    Webcomics 

-   _8-Bit Theater_: Sword-chucks, yo!
-   The chainsaw nunchucks of _The Adventures of Dr. McNinja_.
-   Inevitable in _Homestuck_ with its volatile combination of Item Crafting and young protagonists; their weapons are often created by fusing together actual weapons with whatever random shit they find lying around, frequently leading to some awesomely ridiculous arsenals. Examples include the Wrinklefucker (a sledgehammer with spring-loaded electric irons attached to the head that can launch the user into the air), the Caledscratch (a broken BFS that has the ability to reverse its own timeline to a point when it was whole, and back again), the Thorns of Oglogoth (a pair of knitting needles that can harness the powers of the Horrorterrors), and the Pop-a-Matic Vrillyhoo (a combination of TWO Infinity+1 Swords).
    -   There's also the concept of innocuous doubles (originating in _Problem Sleuth_); weapons that exist as other, more harmless objects until they're ready to be wielded. Keys become handguns, a sextant becomes a sniper rifle, a typewriter becomes a Chicago Typewriter, etc, and most prominently Kanaya's weapon of choice: a tube of lipstick that transforms into a _chainsaw_.
-   _Manly Guys Doing Manly Things_ has an action figure with a big gun that shoots handguns that shoots deep-fried beer cans.
-   _Problem Sleuth_ features Death's scythe, which can transform into anything. ANYTHING. Anti-tank rockets, F-16s, nuclear bombs, Manny Calavera's head, you name it.
-   The 'black rose' a plasma flamethrower from _S.S.D.D._ that often explodes into a mass of plasma and radioactive shrapnel.
-   In "Tokyo Delta Jetlag D," the in-universe anime/manga series from _Unwinder's Tall Comics_, main character Jaded Lament uses the Katagun, a katana that shoots bullets in the shape of the blade. Check it out (and some entertaining lampshading of anime/manga tropes) here.

    Western Animation 

-   The Star Sword and the Power Sword from _Blackstar,_ which _would_ join to form the even more awesome Power Star if they weren't wielded by the hero and the villain respectively. Used for shooting energy beams more often than as actual swords.
-   _Codename: Kids Next Door_:
    -   The KND have a wide array of 2x4 Tech weapons built out of seemingly random objects (such as hair-dryers, or gumball machines) yet prove to be surprisingly effective. Though sometimes subverted as said weapons occasionally break or come out of the wielder's hand depending on who the KND Operative is fighting. In one episode, Numbuh Four uses a handheld gun that shoots mattresses. Entire mattresses.
    -   One of the most notable subversions is from "Operation: T.R.I.C.Y.C.L.E.": the "K-Strike", a giant ketchup bottle that fires a massive beam of ketchup from their moon base down to Earth. Unfortunately, it had no effect on the giant, evil tricycle that they were trying to destroy- one KND pilot points this out:
        
        **KND Pilot:** The ketchup had no effect! And uh... d'you mind telling me who thought _ketchup_ would do anything anyway?
        
-   Filmation's _Flash Gordon_:
    -   The Arborians' ice arrows (which turned out to be very handy for putting out a forest fire in one episode).
    -   Ming himself was fond of using a Flaming Sword in combat.
-   The title weapon from _Galtar and the Golden Lance,_ an enchanted weapon of prophecy that can only be wielded by a Chosen One, it can split into two smaller blades and shoots powerful energy zaps.
-   Most of the weapons on _The Pirates of Dark Water_ look like they were designed by Kit Rae.
-   Muscle Man's track and field equipment from _Regular Show_.
-   The Sword of Protection from _She-Ra and the Princesses of Power_. It's a BFS that turns the chosen wielder into an 8-foot-tall amazonian goddess with super strength, super speed, and nigh-invulnerability. It shoots lasers and can shapeshift into just about anything. It also lets her heal people, can transform animals to give them wings/horns and sapience, and acts as the activation key to ancient technologies.
-   The Sword of Plundarr from _ThunderCats_. Two curved jagged blades, each attached to the opposite side of a little tiny handle. Mumm-ra mostly used it to create giant whirlwinds of fire. Naturally, it shrank down to the handle when he wasn't using it.
-   _Transformers_ is full of examples
    -   Megatron's Fusion Cannon is a BFG that draws power from a _black hole_. While this was merely a rumor/bit of useless trivia for a long time, IDW turned it into a plot point in their More Than Meets The Eye series.
        -   The Magnus Armor from the same series qualifies.
    -   The Star Saber in any series that uses it. Its a BFS (even for 'bots the size of Optimus Prime) with an Absurdly Sharp Blade that launches energy waves.
    -   Transformers: Armada introduced the Requiem Blaster and Sky Boom Shield. The Blaster is the most powerful gun in all of Transformers lore, while the Shield is the only thing that can block the Star Saber.
    -   From Beast Wars, we have Rhinox's dual Chain-Guns of Doom.
-   _Voltron's_ Blazing Sword, an indestructible blade the size of a good-size _building,_ wielded by a giant robot for hacking apart other giant robots. A solid object, but re-created out of Pure Energy every time it's needed. Despite the name, it is _not_ a Flaming Sword. At least until _Voltron: Legendary Defender_.
