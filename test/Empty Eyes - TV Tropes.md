_"Ever look into his eyes? There's nothing there."_

Lack of pupils, and customary light reflection; iris shading goes from the usual radial to gradient; eyelids drop. Yep, this character is suffering from the "Empty Eyes" trope, a condition denoting that the character is dying, dead, distracted, shocked, traumatized, mind-controlled, broken, in a state of Tranquil Fury, completely insane, or some combination of the above.

Due to the condition of shock causing the eyes to dilate, realistic live action will never have this unless the producers don't know better. Could be a way to show someone is so shocked they haven't blinked for a while, because the tears that accumulate would make the eyes more reflective and the pupils harder to see. Pushed for effect in Break the Cutie scenarios.

Sister trope of Prophet Eyes, and the two may coincide as repeated trauma could give someone a Disability Superpower.

Subtrope of Reflectionless Useless Eyes. Compare Dull Eyes of Unhappiness, Thousand-Yard Stare, Mind-Control Eyes, Heroic BSoD and Angst Coma.

    Anime & Manga 

-   After the climax of _Sailor Moon S_, Usagi emerges from her battle against Pharaoh 90 with blank, horrified eyes.
    -   In the manga's "Infinity Arc," this is used to demonstrate that Saturn has awakened, and Hotaru's no longer in control. In the anime's equivalent season, this is occasionally used when someone besides Hotaru is "behind the wheel," though it prefers to combine Glowing Eyes of Doom and Red Eyes, Take Warning.
    -   In Act 2 of _Sailor Moon Crystal_, a Brainwashed Ami's eyes go from a deep sea blue to a matte, dull deep green with dilated, obscured pupils under the influence of the Crystal Disk, a magical CD meant to enslave the user, disguised as a Cram School study aid.

-   _Azumanga Daioh_: Sometimes invoked by Sakaki, particularly when she's either daydreaming, or when she's suffering from Cuteness Overload.
-   In _Juuni Senshi Bakuretsu Eto Ranger_, Hols' Super Mode has blank, angry eyes, indicating that after seeing red, no amount of looking at anything else can stop him.
-   In _Assassination Classroom_ Karma alone in class E lacks eyeshine in his design. Coupled with them being drawn a bit wider, it makes him look a little unhinged compared to the others. Given that a lot of his attitude is from being let down horribly by a teacher he once respected, there's definitely a sign of being broken there.
    -   This may also be due to his psychopathic and manipulative behavior, since his eyes apparently have always lacked the shine. But that doesn't erase the fact that the incident about how his teacher betrayed him in favor for maintaining images instead of doing the right thing destroyed Karma.
    -   Both Asanos have this as well.
-   Happens to Takiko in _Fushigi Yuugi: Genbu Kaiden_, after Genbu devours her soul.
-   In _Heat Guy J_, this is how Clair is first introduced at his dad's funeral, before he throws a grenade at his father's grave. It happens to him later in the series, when he goes into an Angst Coma, and when he comes out of the coma to rescue his bodyguard/friend Giovanni from the titular J.
-   _Death Note_: Happens with Kiyomi Takada and Naomi Misora under the influence of the Death Note; arguably a case of Mind-Control Eyes, as well.
    -   Inverted with L, whose eyes only become shiny and reflective when he dies
-   _Sengoku Youko_: Senya is drawn with pupil-less irises that resemble black scribbles, and prior to his Heel–Face Turn he was stated to have eyes devoid of everything except murderous intent.
-   Kishou Arima from _Tokyo Ghoul_, which combined with his Scary Shiny Glasses, makes him look quite intimidating. This detail turns out to be significant, as it hints towards him being partially blind and a Death Seeker.
-   In _Kemono Friends_, empty eyes are used to represent Friends born from endangered or extinct animal species like Crested Ibis.
-   _Naruto_: When Sasuke Uchiha impales Karin in order to kill Danzo, the iris of his right eye is shown as being filled with black scribbles to show how far he's succumbed to the Uchiha Clan's Curse of Hatred.
-   In _Skip Beat!_, Kyoko gets these more and more as the message of her mother mentioning on TV that she has no children settles in.
-   _The Mermaid Princess's Guilty Meal_: As the mermaid princess Ela's addiction to seafood worsens, she's drawn with solid black irises both when despairing over her growing desire to eat her friends and when she lets her Killing Intent come to the surface.
-   _My Girlfriend Gives Me Goosebumps!_: Both Haruka and Kisaki are often drawn with black iris, to represent how bored (Haruka) or obsessive (Kisaki) they are. In both cases, those empty eyes are what push them to enter in a relationship with the other.

    Comic Books 

-   Note that empty eyes can also merely mean that the artist was too lazy. A prominent example (got even a Take That! on that behalf in a satiric comic) is Little Orphan Annie.
-   Used to imply mind control in _Heart of Empire, or the Legacy of Luther Arkwright_.
-   _Robin (1993)_: Lady Shiva stops Robin from going after Clyde Rawlins when he goes to what Tim knows it the man's certain death by pointing out that a look in his eyes should tell Tim that regardless of physical health Rawlins died with his family and there's no way to stop him going after their murderer even if he has no chance at avenging them or survival.
-   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: When Artemis dies, her jade green eyes go flat, losing all highlights and shading, to indicate that she is really gone.

    Fan Works 

-   Italy temporarily gained the traumatized type in _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ fanfic _Gankona, Unnachgiebig, Unità_. After Germany pulled out a Browning Hi Power on Japan and Japan pulled out his katana on Germany, Italy had had enough of their cock fight.
    
    It only took one look at the utterly _devastated_ form of their precious beloved, one look at normally limpid brown eyes _dead_ with misery and grief to do all three to those two nations. Simultaneously. And then some.
    
-   _A Moth to a Flame_: Marcy gains these after coming out of the Healing Vat, symbolizing her complete Innocence Lost after Gaining the Will to Kill.
-   _The Sacred and the Profane_: The eyes of the Fallen Angel Zirah, aka Mr. Rah, are as bright, blue, and depthlessly empty as the sky. He's the sort of being who honestly does not understand why one shouldn't kill a baby simply because it's the most expedient way to stop it from crying.
    
    You couldn't have eyes like Mr. Rah's and _not_ have something lurking underneath the surface. It wasn't that there was anger or hatred or suppressed violence in their blue depths. That was the point. There wasn't _anything_ in Mr. Rah's eyes.  
    It was _creepy_.
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   This is what happens to anyone who befell the titular curse in _Bloody Parrot_, notably on the hero's Hooker with a Heart of Gold girlfriend. It's depicted on the film's poster, too.
-   In the original 1975 version of _The Stepford Wives_, Joanna's robot double has empty black eyes when she's first seen.
-   _Jaws_ had Quint's memorable quote about how a shark's eyes look like a doll's eyes - cold and empty.
-   _Halloween (1978)_ had Dr. Loomis describe Michael as having "the blackest eyes. The Devil's eyes." This was back when he was a little boy having just murdered his sister, and he would only get worse from there.

    Literature 

-   In _A Wrinkle in Time_, Charles Wallace's pupils constrict completely, leaving only empty blue irises.
-   _The Hunger Games_: Effie Trinket. Katniss notes how Effie has a "vacant look" in her eyes in _Mockingjay_ due to the torture she suffered while being held prisoner by the Capitol.
-   In all _A Certain Magical Index_ media except for the anime adaptation of _A Certain Scientific Railgun_, the Sisters (Hive Mind clones of Misaka Mikoto with dulled emotions) are drawn with Empty Eyes to distinguish them from the original. The exception is Last Order, a "network administrator" Sister who is already easy to distinguish from Mikoto by virtue of being a Token Mini-Moe Genki Girl.
-   _Shimoneta_: Exhibited by Oboro in chapter 10. Tanukichi mistakes Oboro for a member of Gathered Fabric and wrestles him to the floor, which is when Tanukichi realizes something is "off" and uses his foot to confirm his suspicions. The inspection causes Oboro to silently arch his back as he experiences his first orgasm. After which, he's seen smiling with a faint blush.
-   In _Fate/Zero_, both the protagonist Kiritsugu Emiya and the antagonist Kirei Kotomine constantly have empty eyes.
-   _The Last Unicorn_:
    
    **King Haggard:** _(to Amalthea)_ Your eyes! Your eyes have become empty as Lir's, as any eyes that... never saw unicorns.
    
-   Wights, the main antagonists of _Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children_, can only be differentiated from Peculiars and normals by their lack of pupils. Granted, there are plenty of ways for them to hide this.

    Music 

-   Evanescence's song, "_Exodus_", mentions in the last verse "so much more dismay in empty eyes".
-   The track "Riding Tigers" on Desperate Straights by Slapp Happy goes "An empty gaze/Sitting like that for days."

    Toys 

-   Karzahni and Tren Krom were described as having these in certain _BIONICLE_ media, though the former was illustrated with bright yellow eyes and later released as a toy with red eyes, and the latter was also given glowing eyes because of the writer misremembering.
-   "Beast Changer" (Savage/Noble) from the _Beast Machines_ line had literally empty eyes in his Noble mode. Some think that this was a deliberate decision,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  others say that the toy was simply released incomplete — at any rate, Noble had normal eyes in the TV series.

    Video Games 

-   _Gadget Trial_: The titular trial is pitting two families of E-Series cyborg girl soldiers against each other to see which is better. Contrasting the protagonist White family, are the E-Series Black who are programmed for perfect obedience, lack of character and minimal self-awareness. Gleamless eyes and stiff expressions come with it.
-   Dark Arle in _Puyo Puyo 7_ has these, when under control of Ecolo.
    -   As well as Yu, but mostly because she's a cheerful ghost. Probably her brother Rei too, but he hides his eyes with bangs.
    -   Dapper Bones, too. At least, in the one eye he has left, anyway. (The other falling under Glowing Eyelights of Undeath.)
-   _Touhou Project_:
    -   Giving Koishi Komeiji these was common in fanart even before it became official as of _Touhou Shinkirou ~ Hopeless Masquerade_. The reason why is a very odd combination of the potential uses of this trope - yes, she's air-headed, but more significantly Koishi is a former mind-reader who, after being reviled for her powers, sealed away her own ability. As a side effect she lost the ability to read her _own_ mind, so she's more or less an Empty Shell with a complete Lack of Empathy, wandering around and acting on her unconscious impulses. She's either insane or close to enlightenment, depending on who you ask.
    -   Junko was depicted like this in the spin-off manga _Visionary Fairies in Shrine_, with dull irises, tiny pupils and an empty smile. In her case it's justified because she's less a person and more a vengeful spirit, the purified embodiment of a woman's grudge against those who killed her son.
    -   The fan-made anime _Fantasy Kaleidoscope_ gives this to Yuyuko, who falls under the "dead" distinction by virtue of being a Cute Ghost Girl.
-   _Yandere Simulator_: One of the signs that Ayano has become "visibly insane" is that her eyes go blank. This is fitting, because her true nature is that she's close to emotionless, with what emotions she does have reserved for love for her Senpai and hatred for her rivals. Word of God says that being visibly insane is less her actually going crazy (since she already is), but more her insanity becoming more apparent to onlookers. So, it's only fitting that her eyes go blank when this happens.
    -   Ayano can also torture someone into becoming an Empty Shell. Once the process is over, they'll have these.
    -   Shiromi also has these. In her case, it's to show how odd she is, and not linked to craziness.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_
    -   Throughout the series, this is a trait of some Vampire bloodlines. Their eyes are a pale white with no irises or pupils. Others have Black Eyes of Evil, while others still have Super Natural Gold Eyes. (It's implied that they may all have these glowing gold eyes, but only beings with divine souls, such as the Dragonborn of _Skyrim_, can actually see them.)
    -   In _Oblivion_, this is a trait of Scamps, the weakest and smallest known form of lesser Daedra. Other games have variously given them red eyes or Black Eyes of Evil.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Umineko: When They Cry_, Clair Vaux Bernard always has these eyes, representative of her status as merely Yasu's storyteller, unable to interfere with anything that actually occurs within the story she tells.
-   _Higurashi: When They Cry_
    -   Used when Rika is found dead by the others.
    -   Given to Rena at the height of her insanity during the _Atonement_ Arc, same with Shion during hers, it comes and goes.
    -   Satoko gets these at any time when her Evil Uncle is around and subjecting her to abuse. It's a sign that she's found the courage to stand up to him when her pupils and highlights come back.
-   _The Fruit of Grisaia_: In her bad ending Michiru gets these, after her attempted suicide leaves her with permanent brain damage, all but dead inside.
-   _Doki Doki Literature Club!_: You wouldn't think this would come up that way in such a cheery-sounding game, but it applies to more than one character when they're dead. In one case, they even start out like this but their normal colour, but turn greyer as time passes after the character's death.
-   _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Dual Destinies_: When unmasked as the Phantom, Bobby Fulbright loses the light in his eyes.

    Webcomics 

-   _Ava's Demon_: Implied regarding Odin's sociopathic brother Olai. He's drawn with ordinary pupils, but...
    
    **Odin:** Olai... d-doesn't care about anyone but himself. M-my mother once s-said... he's missing the window to his soul. Wh-when you look into his eyes, it's like he's looking r-right through you... like you're n-not really there.
    
-   The page image is Michael Kappel of _Collar 6_, deep in the midst of a Heroic BSoD after his parents were killed by Unfriendly Fire.
-   In _Genocide Man_, all of the Genocide Men have cold, dead stares (represented in the art by blank white eyes) due to the lifetime of horrors they've each seen and committed. One character actually thought the eyes were cybernetic, because she didn't believe that human eyes could look like that.
    
    **Caera:** What about the eyes? All your Genocide Men... your eyes are so cold and dead. As if you've lost your souls.  
    _\[Beat\]_  
    **Kevin:** ...the procedure doesn't affect the eyes.
    
-   Characters in _Homestuck_ who are dead gain completely blank eyes if they are seen in Dream Bubbles afterward. It doesn't affect their personality or eyesight, though. Andrew Hussie's Author Avatar also had empty eyes even _before_ his in-comic death. Whether that is significant or not remains to be seen.
-   In _Questionable Content_, Hannelore's eyes go flat when she is avoiding engaging with a police officer.
-   _Tapiseri Soujourn_: While burning down the village, Caleb has empty, crazed eyes.

    Web Original 

-   _Dino Attack RPG_:
    -   Most Mutant Dinos and Quasifigus Hybrids have blank white eyes.
    -   After being attacked by a Mutant Raptor, Greybeard's scarred eye appears washed-out in color in comparison to his other eye. He was also nearly blind in that eye.
    -   When Rex's body was possessed by Baron Typhonus, his eyes turned blank white.
-   In _Alice Isn't Dead,_ the eyes of the narrator's soon-to-be stalker The Thistle Man are described as "...flat. Like a bad painting of a face," shortly before he deliberately reveals himself as a Humanoid Abomination.

     Western Animation 

-   _Steven Universe_: In "Mirror Gem", Steven frees Lapis Lazuli from her imprisonment in a mirror, but the gem on her back is still cracked and her eyes have no irises. In the next episode, Steven heals her gem and she regains both her irises and her ability to create water-based wings for herself.
-   _The Owl House_: Under his golden mask, Emperor Belos looks remarkably normal, save for the rotting scar across his face... and the fact that, unlike every other character in the show, his eyes have no shine to them, underscoring his nature as The Sociopath.
