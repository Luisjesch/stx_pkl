**Random Cop #1:** Someone call the Avengers or somethin'—  
**Random Cop #2:** — And tell 'em what? A **polite robot** just walked into the U.N.?  
**Random Cop #3:** _\[into radio\]_ — got a 4-3-7 at the U.N. —

_We've got a 20-26, someone's trying to describe Police Code For Everything here!_

The Monster of the Week has grown to the size of a skyscraper, and is currently rampaging through New York, carrying a load of Noodle Implements. He's even kidnapped the Designated Victim. A police officer on scene calmly pulls out his radio and announces "We've got a 10-340".

No matter how obscure, improbable, or downright _weird_ an event is, the Crazy-Prepared department has a code for it. Furthermore, everyone will have the code memorized and are expected to know instantly what the code means - they might have even trained for its eventual use. (Although there's the frequent exception, or just a non-cop who happens to be involved, leading them to question what it is, and for the meaning to be revealed.) It may be that their beat is a Quirky Town or the City of Adventure, so they come to expect giant apes once again fighting among the stampeding warthogs.

More often than not, this Trope can go hand-in-hand with the Police Are Useless Trope, because having the code just means they know _what_ is happening, not that they know how (or are sufficiently equipped) to deal with it.

Sub-Trope of Crazy-Prepared. Sister Trope to Code Emergency, where a pre-arranged code is used for clandestine communication. See also Hash House Lingo for another profession where everything has its own code which the employees have memorized.

    Comedy 

-   There are a few examples in Stan Freberg's _Dragnet_ parodies.
    -   In "St. George and the Dragonet", St. George finally nabs the fire-breathing dragon on these charges:
        
        **St. George:** I'm taking you in on a 502. You figure it out.  
        **Dragon:** What's the charge?  
        **St. George:** Devouring maidens out of season.  
        **Dragon:** Out of season?!? You'll never pin that rap on me!! _Do you hear me, COP?!?!_  
        **St. George:** Yeah, I hear you. I got you on a 412 too.  
        **Dragon:** _A 412!!!_ _**What's a 412?!?!?**_  
        **St. George:** Over-acting. Let's go.
        
    -   In "Christmas Dragnet," a man named Grudge is brought in on a 4096325-096704: not believing in Santa Claus. Wednesday had previously brought him in on a 1492: not believing in Columbus.
    -   Further parodied in _Little Blue Riding Hood_.
        
        **Sgt. Wednesday:** When I was on my way to a 503, a 618 came in. I added up the 614, the 503 and the 614 and got 1,735.
        

    Comic Books 

-   _Uncanny X-Men_ Issue 366, providing the page quote for Crazy-Prepared:
    
    **Cop #2**: And tell 'em what? A polite robot just walked into the U.N.?
    
    **Cop #3**: (into radio) — got a 4-3-7- at the U.N. —
    
-   _Green Lantern_ shows that this trope is in effect for Space Police, too. 1011, for example, is Deicide. _Rebirth_ gives us 1963: "suspect escaped into an extra-dimensional vortex".

    Fan Works 

-   In _Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality_, one of the codes Amelia Bones has set up for Magical Law Enforcement is code RJ-L20: "Guard requires relief because prisoner is attempting psychological warfare and is succeeding". The psychological warfare that gets this code invoked is _humming_.
    
    **Auror Altunay**: You don't understand! It's really awful humming!
    
-   _The Secret Return of Alex Mack_: Paradise Valley PD refers to superpowered incidents as "10-9000". Justified, given they've been dealing with GC-161 metas for years.
-   In _Takamachi Nanoha of 2814_, a 16887 means "Illegal disposal of a disposable pre-packaged beverage vessel by attempted forced ingestion into an endangered species of carnivorous luminescent crystal fungus" in the Green Lantern Handbook. Nanoha appears to have memorized all the codes - and is strongly implied to be the only Lantern presently in the Corps to have read the thing cover to cover.
-   In the _Discworld_ of A.A. Pessimal, the Ankh-Morpork City Watch has a scale which up until IC-6 is suspiciously reminiscent of that used by the British police force. Then after IC-6 (person of Klatchian or Hubwards Circle Sea appearance), the City Watch scale goes through IC-7 (Dwarf) up to IC-16 (Elf: touches iron). Incidents also have their codes: a Code 23 denotes any manifestation of the eldrich, paranormal, supernatural, or things appearing with too many tentacles. A 23 involving the presence of many IC-16's is something to dread. There is also an unofficial extra category IC-17, which is code for Nobby Nobbs.

    Films — Animated 

-   In _Toy Story 2_, a Buzz Lightyear action figure at Al's Toy Barn (who thinks he's a real space ranger) is completely baffled at the behavior of the other toys, who are trying to rescue Woody. Andy's Buzz (who realizes he's a toy) tells the deluded Buzz, "It's alright, Space Ranger. It's a code 5-46." Deluded Buzz gasps and bows before Woody, saying, "Your Majesty!" And from that point on, while he still believes himself to be a real space ranger, this Buzz takes the situation entirely in stride and works with the remaining toys, although he ends up in combat against an Emperor Zurg action figure, believing it to be real.
-   _Monsters, Inc._
    -   A 23-19 call goes out whenever there's contact between monsters and a human object, even something as innocuous as a sock.
    -   When Monstropolis appears in _Kingdom Hearts III_, we get other CDA examples; 8-35 is an indicator that a human has come through the door network, while 72-16 is a warning of unidentified life-forms.
-   _The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature_: Code 7 means a donut shop selling donuts for half their usual price. When Liberty Land is closed, a cop seizes a donut cart and says it's a code 7. The other cops there approve it.
-   _SCOOB!_: While Scooby and Shaggy are being chased by Dastardly's robots at the Takamoto Bowl, their friends listen to a police radio and hear a report of a 40-15 in progress.
    
    **Velma:** _(reading)_ "Tiny, violent, shapeshifting robots chasing a man and a dog in a bowling alley, linen store or car wash." Wow, the police really _do_ have a code for everything.
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle_: an illegal chinchilla ranch on the premises is an 11-350.
-   A couple of cops in _Mirrors 2_ discuss the ghoulish scene of a disemboweling with this exchange:
    
    **First Cop:** "You ever see a 10-56 like that before?"
    
    **Second Cop:** "I'm not sure."
    
-   Parodied but good in a Deleted Scene from _The Naked Gun_ (often reinserted for TV airings), when Frank keeps rattling off the wrong police codes to describe an attempt on Nordberg's life while an increasingly panicky hospital clerk correctly interprets them as being for things like fire or a gas leak. On his third attempt, the clerk simply screams in horror and dives out a window.
-   Parodied in _Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back_. The security guards on the set for the _Bluntman and Chronic_ movie continually mix up the codes for intruders in the lot and removing a dead hooker from Ben Affleck's trailer.
    
    **Security Guard:** _(arriving to check for Jay and Silent Bob)_ Sorry to interrupt, sirs, but we got a 10-07 on our hands!
    
    **Matt Damon:** _(sighs, annoyed)_ Ah, Jesus, again, Ben?
    
    **Ben Affleck:** No, _bullshit!_ Cause I wasn't with a hooker today, _Ha HA!_
    
-   In _Live Free or Die Hard_, John McClane ferrets out the fake "police dispatcher" by subverting it: using the wrong police 10-code to describe his situation. When the dispatcher smoothly claims that all units have been dispatched to his code,
    
    "You mean you had to dispatch all units for the naked people wandering around?"
    
-   Dispatch radio in _Ted 2_: "All units, we have a 3-17 on Maple Drive. Area units please respond."
    
    **First Cop:** "What's a 3-17?"
    
    **Second Cop:** "Someone's trying to steal Tom Brady's jizz again."
    
-   In _Carnival Magic_, the rural police apparently use cutesy names as code, rather than numbers. The sheriff thinks he sees a runaway car with no driver, so he radios that he's "chasing a Ghost Car." The deputy catches up and sees that there's actually a chimpanzee driving, and a woman in the back seat. So he radios back:
    
    **Deputy:** It's kind of a King Kong, Sheriff. Ten four.  
    **Sheriff:** King Kong? What's a King Kong?  
    **Deputy:** An ape kidnapping a beautiful girl.
    

    Literature 

-   In _Discworld_:
    -   The Diary for the Ankh-Morpork City Watch includes a list of pigeon codes, including one which means "The previous pigeon was eaten by a gargoyle officer, please resend".
    -   In _Feet of Clay_, a "no. 23" is "Running Screaming At People While Drunk And Trying To Cut Their Knees Off".
-   There's a naval variation in _Good Omens_: after trying to find the way to communicate that he's found a sunken city of pyramids, he looks through "international codes" and sends "XXXV QVVX" which means "Have found the lost city of Atlantis. High Priest has just won the Quoits contest."
-   In one of Robert Rankin's _Armageddon_ novels, there is an extended joke sequence with two policemen discussing which ridiculous thing that's just happened is which code. At the end, it is revealed that there is a specific code for "a demon-possessed vehicle in a towaway zone".
-   From a Dave Barry column:
    
    _A tom turkey crashed through the windshield of a dump truck early Monday in Butler County and struck a fighting posture with the surprised driver...Fortunately, the driver was able to escape and call the police, who responded swiftly, as they do whenever they hear the dreaded radio code 10-84 ("Turkey in Fighting Posture")_
    
    -   Another:
    
    Law-enforcement experts will tell you, after they have had a few belts, that in a situation where a member of the marmot family is holding people hostage in a sewage plant (in police radio code, this is known as a "10-6"), the textbook response is to drive a police car over the alleged perpetrator, then, if necessary, advise it of its rights.
    
-   _From a Buick 8_ plays with this trope; the officers of Troop D don't standardly have a code for referring to incidents involving a supernatural car, but as a security measure to keep the Buick a secret they come up with "Code D" for when it's necessary to talk about the Buick over the radio.
-   _Invasion: Earth_. When the protagonist first shows up to deal with an alien spacecraft that's crashed in Central Park, he tells the NYPD captain that they'll be following a specific plan. The surprised captain asks if the government has anticipated a UFO landing. He explains that no, not exactly, but the plan covers a wide range of extreme situations.
    
    L67. One of the blue-sky plans that everyone had laughed at. What if a flying saucer lands? What then? Ha-ha. Not only weren't they laughing now, they probably weren't even smiling.
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._. S.H.I.E.L.D. uses the code 084 to refer to an "object of unknown origin". Fitz later clarifies that even if they don't know what an object is, if they know where it came from it doesn't qualify as an 084. It alludes to the box label for the original object that S.H.I.E.L.D.'s predecessor, the SSR, acquired that fit that category.
-   _Alaska State Troopers_ real life example, if you listen closely to the background radio dispatcher, they have a 10-code for _Moose stuck in greenhouse!_
-   On _Baywatch_, as Stephanie is taken hostage by an escaped criminal, she receives a call from her supervisor. She starts to respond by saying that she's "dealing with a code—", but the man cuts her off, knowing that she could be giving him a code that alerts him to her situation. Luckily her supervisor figures out she's in trouble anyway as she the tells him that she's driving a lost child around to find his parents, something that's a violation of policy.
-   _The Big Bang Theory_:
    
    -   Gloriously subverted when Howard has to visit the hospital for an embarrassing injury. The scene sets up this trope when:
    
    **Althea the Nurse** (_into Tannoy_): Can I get an orderly with a wheelchair down here? We got a robot hand graspin' a man's penis.  
    **Howard**: Could you be a little more discreet?  
    **Althea**: I'm sorry. We don't have a code for "robot hand graspin' a man's penis."
    
    -   Crazy fans trespassing on Skywalker Ranch in an attempt to meet George Lucas is common enough that the private security stationed there have code "AA23" for alerts.
    
    **Sheldon**: They have tasers, but they wouldn't dare use... AAAAAHHH!
    
-   Referenced in _Castle_. In the episode "Undead Again", a murder suspect, dressed as a zombie, has been found dead in his home. In the morgue, the medical examiner sticks a needle into the man's arm - only for the so-called corpse to jerk upright and bolt for the door.
    
    **Castle**: _(at the telephone)_ Is there a police code for zombie on the loose?
    
-   _Corner Gas_ plays it straight in one episode and plays with it in another.
    -   For the former, Lacey calls the police when experiencing car trouble while Hank is accompanying them on a police ride-along program. Of course, since there is little to no crime in Dog River, they probably _would_ have police code for the things people actually call them about.
        
        **Davis:** You're about to witness a 10-13: Car won't start.  
        **Hank:** Is it safe?  
        **Davis:** Keep your head down and stay close. It'll be okay.
        
    -   For the latter, Davis finds what appears to be an alien Crop Circle and gives a police code, but it turns out to be a mundane one that he is using creatively.
        
        **Davis:** Karen, I want you to get the RCMP down here right away. Tell 'em we got a 10-92.  
        **Karen:** Parking violation?  
        **Davis:** _\[puts on sunglasses\]_ By _aliens_.
        
-   In _Doctor Who_ and its spinoff _Torchwood_, a "code 9" signifies that the Doctor has been seen in the area.
-   Similarly, on _ER_, Kerry Weaver tries to implement a code system for people's injuries and illnesses so that they don't have to be embarrassed by having the gory or gross details posted on the admission board. Unfortunately, everyone whines and complains and can't be bothered to learn the various codes, forcing the idea to be abandoned in less than a day.
-   An early episode of _The Flash (2014)_ has a brief gag of Cisco messing up police codes while trying to direct Barry to a crime.
    
    **Cisco**: Code two-thirty-seven on Wade Boulevard.  
    **Barry**: ...public indecency?  
    **Cisco**: Wait, I think I meant a two-thirty-_nine_.  
    **Barry**: _Dog leash violation!?_  
    **Caitlin**: Bad man, with a gun, in a getaway car, GO!
    
-   In the world of _Get Smart_, CONTROL has codes for just about every possible scenario, up to and including alien invasion. Just make sure you've memorized the right codes, and don't accidentally call in that code when you want something else, like Max did in one episode.
-   Precious Puppies: Fang aka Agent K-13.
-   In an episode of _Homicide Hunter_, Detective Kenda is investigating a woman's murder when he notices the notation "JDLR" on the original missing persons report taken. This stands for "just doesn't look right". When Kenda questions the cop who took the report from the woman's husband, he tells him that he wrote that because he was disturbed by the man's Incriminating Indifference, something highly unlikely for a concerned spouse.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Iron Fist (2017)_. Unsurprisingly with all the metahumans running around, the NYPD has the appropriate a police code. In "Heart of the Dragon", Misty Knight responds to a 616, which she explains is "possible suspect with abilities" after someone steals the power of the Iron Fist off Danny Rand and uses it to kill several Triad members. 616 is the universe number of the main Marvel Universe in the comics, so it's also a Mythology Gag.
-   _Mystery Science Theater 3000:_ In _Carnival Magic_, their experiment that episode features cutesy police code names, so Tom Servo and Crow decide to turn it into an Overly Long Gag:
    
    **Crow:** Breaker breaker, we've got a Carnival Magic in progress.  
    **Servo:** Carnival Magic? What's that?  
    **Crow:** That's when a second-rate producer has access to a carnival, so he writes a script in three days and pays all his actors in beer and cheese sticks.  
    **Servo:** Oh, right, and he pads out the movie with footage of sad children and a car chase that does nothing to further the plot, but makes the movie long enough so that way he can run it in theaters.  
    **Crow:** Uh-huh, and it gets buried in a vault for years until a mad scientist makes a TV show where they force poor jerks to watch it, thus giving it a second life its makers never truly intended.  
    **Servo:** Yeah, exactly, Carnival Magic.
    
-   _Night Court_: The Wheelers are brought in on a 509b violation.
    
    **Harry**: I don't believe I'm familiar with that one.  
    **Dan**: Well, sir, it's not used in Manhattan very much. It involves the illegal detonation of poultry.
    
-   A variant in _Red Dwarf_, where Rimmer constantly says the latest wacky situation is in violation of a specific "Space Corps directive", and robot butler Kryten chimes in with the actual, ridiculous directive ("No officer above the rank of Mess Sergeant is permitted to go into combat with pierced nipples?"). Even the serious directives are extremely specific.
-   _That's So Raven_: "Five-Finger Discount" shows Corey hanging out with the wrong crowd and being goaded into shoplifting. When Cory puts the stress-toy monkey he stole back where he found it, Raven has a vision of him being caught by mall security for this offense again, and when he meets up with the gang of bullies again, she disguises herself as a security guard to stop him. The vision comes true, because Raven herself was the security guard who caught Cory shoplifting. Played straight when Cory and Raven try to leave the store, only for them and the bullies to be confronted by a _real_ security guard, who demands to know what sort of situation is going on, and Raven says it's a Code 903, which means a swarm of bees, making everyone freak out. It is then subverted when Raven asks the guard the one for shoplifting, to which she responds there is none and they just call it that. After the shoplifting bullies are caught, it is parodied when Raven tries to put her borrowed mustache back, which hurts when she rips it off and makes her scream "1027 for mustache burn!".
-   On _Third Watch_, the cops realize that they've caught the criminals who have been Impersonating an Officer in order to attack women by asking them a question in cop lingo, which of course, they don't understand, not being real cops.
-   On _World's Dumbest..._, Kevin McCaffrey comments on how the police have a code for a guy who drunk-drives _himself_ to jail.
    
    **Kevin:** You guys are _thorough_.
    

    Radio 

-   In the Reduced Shakespeare Company's _Reduced Shakespeare Radio Show_, a "Elizabethan Plot Device Number 37" ("One of the oldest tricks in the book but it just might work!") covers all of the plot points in the final act of _Romeo and Juliet_. The wedding, the sleep potion, the funeral, the suicides, all of it.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Legend of the Five Rings_, the Crab Clan have "battle-language" to describe common scenarios. For example, "Kannishiki!" means "The creature we are fighting can only be harmed by jade weapons!". "Tsuta" means "The staff of this restaurant or geisha house are actually shapeshifted Shadowlands creatures. Fetch your weapons discreetly and meet me at the door." If that fails, "Yasha!" means "The jig is up. Fight your way out however you can."

    Theme Parks 

-   An article about training to run the Walt Disney World monorails includes a list of 10-codes that the drivers must know, along with a few that are more obscure.
    
    SIGNAL 96-S: There's a huge snake on my train!
    

    Web Animation 

-   Discussed in Overly Sarcastic Productions' "Wild Hunt" episode, where Red jokes that the Stith Thompson Index of Folkloric Classification sounds like an urban fantasy version of this.
    
    **Red (walkie-talkie voice):** Code E-221! E-221! We got a dead-wife-haunted husband on his second marriage!
    
-   Parodied at the end of the _Zero Punctuation_ review of _Astral Chain_, on the notion that the feeling of routine that he got from the gameplay makes sense in the context of its setting as a police game.
    
    **Officer Imp:** _\[walkie talkie static\]_ Attention all officers, a giant armoured gorilla is flinging exploding turds around city centre!  
    **Officer Yahtzee:** _\[walkie talkie static\]_ You mean a 2218?  
    **Officer Imp:** _\[walkie talkie static\]_ No, it's a 2219, because he's wearing a sombrero!
    

    Web Comics 

-   Two non-police examples from _Questionable Content_:
    -   When Bubbles comes into the café somewhat distraught after abruptly realizing her feelings for Faye, Dora springs into action and mobilizes her girlfriend Tai by phoning her to report a "Code 3."
        
        **Bubbles:** You have an _operational code_ for this situation?
        
    -   Sam finds a random metal part on the floor of Union Robotics and asks Faye about it. Faye feigns horror and Bubbles, without missing a beat, pretends to call in a "Code Fuchsia" directly to the President, with the missiles targeted on her location. Once Sam has had sufficient opportunity to confront her own mortality, they clarify that they were kidding, and "Code Fuchsia," though apparently real, is quite a bit more benign than it sounded.
        
        **Bubbles:** "Code Fuchsia" is for a dog loose in the mess hall. It does not typically require a ballistic missile strike.
        

    Web Original 

-   In _Void Dogs_ the _Fickle Finger's_ security has a code for "exiled royalty has detonated a bottle". They also have one for "exiled royalty has detonated a turtle".
-   This _X-Men_ fanart provides a bureaucratic example. When Cyclops reports his wife's demonically-influenced suicide, he finds that they have a standard form for that.
-   _Not Always Working_: A story features a theater worker who must indicate that there is a dog loose. He asks for "Technician Scooby" over the radio.
-   In The Nostalgia Critic and The Angry Video Game Nerd's review of _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014)_:
    
    **Police Officer:** Yeah, we have a 10-10. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>   
    **Critic:** "That's right, a 10-10, four giant turtles fighting a mecha metal samurai. By God, it's been a few days!"
    
-   Non police code version in _Red vs. Blue_ when Simmons discovers from a computer that the Red and Blues are just training scenarios for testing members of Project Freelancer.
    
    **Sarge:** What- what- that's nonsense! We've been through so much! We had that, whole battle with the Blues for the, somethinerother and, then we set off that bomb thingy, and we got blasted through time, and we met an alien and that guy got pregnant.
    
    **Simmons:** According to this that is... Scenario 3.  
    **Sarge:** _Three!?_
    
-   _Hanazuki Full Of Treasure_: Dazzlescence Jones, The Sheriff of Hanazuki's moon, has Police Codes for meteor showers and the cleanup effort that follows them. Respectively being 2-13 and 2-18. He also has one for retreating to the Safety Cave (4-12)
-   In _Epithet Erased_'s fourth episode, Indus the strong and good-natured but also somewhat dim-witted bodyguard of the first Arc Villain is trying to capture the main character during their museum heist, while holding the skull of a dinosaur. He then comes across the police, who are here to stop the robbery...
    
    **Percy:** (while speaking into a walkie talkie) 96-18, we have a 96-18 in progress. Subject is in possession of a Sauropod, Bronto, possibly Apatosaurus, requesting backup immediately.
    
    **Indus:** Ha! Well... this is awkward!
    

    Western Animation 

-   _The Amazing Worldof Gumball_: In the episode "The Prisoner", as Donut Sheriff is chasing down Frankie and Gumball, we get this exchange:
    
    **Donut Sheriff:** I'm in pursuit of a fugitive handcuffed to a tattooed child!
    
    **Officer:** You mean a 12-57?
    
    **Donut Sheriff:** Uh...If you say so.
    
-   When _Bonkers_ was wearing a beanie that was making him fly out of control, Miranda calls it in.
    
    **Miranda:** East on Franklin Ave. I got a Code 6-21.  
    **Policeman on radio:** Code 6-21. Again? Can't you just shoot him down this time?
    
-   _Garfield and Friends_:
    -   In one short:
        
        **Chief:** Looks like we got an 817, Jones.  
        **Cop:** A creature living in the refrigerator, behind the mayonnaise, next to the ketchup, and to the left of the coleslaw?  
        **Chief:** You got it.
        
    -   Also, the episode "Binky Goes Bad" has this:
        
        **Cop**: We've got a 708! That's right! A clown barricaded in a bakery with pies!
        
    -   A non-police variant occurred in one of the _U.S. Acres_ segments, with one of Roy's attempts at placing the most ridiculously Byzantine and unfulfillable order he can dream up at Orson's new diner<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
        
        **Roy:** I'd like an alligator-cheese sandwich made with cheese from an alligator named Cynthia, I want it with lettuce grown in Northern Bolivia and picked on Memorial Day, I want it served on rye bread with exactly 71 caraway seeds per slice, and I want a pickle in the shape of Muncie, Indiana.  
        **Orson:** Very good. One #8!
        
    -   Wade actually has a large file folder system containing code numbers for every possible fear that he could have.
-   In _Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer,_ a family dispute about to the existence of Santa Claus is a 12-25. When Jake insists that he saw Santa run over Grandma, the officers put it down as "sleighicular hit-and-run", which is a 12-24. (One officer lampshades the date there.)
-   _Gravity Falls_ has this gag in the episode "Headhunters":
    
    **Voice on handheld transceiver:** Attention all units. Steve is going to fit an entire cantaloupe in his mouth. Repeat. An entire cantaloupe.  
    **Deputy Durland:** It's a 23-16!  
    **Sherrif Blubs:** Let's move!
    
-   _Kid Cosmic_: After Tuna Sandwich attempts to hijack a truck's direction to get to a crashed spaceship, the truck's driver announces on his radio that there's a 22-10 operating out near the local diner.
    
    **Dispatcher:** Crazy feline with an intent to hijack. Copy that.
    
-   A military variant shows up in the _Kim Possible_ episode "Rufus vs. Commodore Puddles". The initial attack by Drakken's now-gigantic poodle is described as "a 41/5S-type scenario". They even have special equipment ready, trucks loaded with huge dog whistles. When Rufus (also grown to giant size) arrives to help, this development is "a 49/EZ scenario".
-   _Lilo & Stitch: The Series_: 'Swapper'. The police have 304. Blue dog loose in store.
-   Lampshaded in _Mighty Ducks: The Animated Series_ episode "Jurassic Puck":
    
    **Mallory:** I don't know what bothers me more: the fact that we're being _attacked_ by a dinosaur or the fact that you've got a _category_ for it.
    
-   A running gag in _The Loud House_ is for Lincoln to call Clyde on their walkie talkies and give an emergency code, for example "Code Aquamarine." Clyde will respond by clarifying what that code means, which is always for something very specific, in this case, trying to do twelve loads of laundry at once in order to make time to go to an amusement park and breaking the washing machine.
-   In _Phineas and Ferb_, a 10-91-P is a missing platypus.
-   In a _Robot Chicken_ sketch based on _Beauty and the Beast_ Belle calls the cops to report her kidnapping. When they arrive the Beast defends himself and the cops call in a "Code 4-5-9: Giant hamster throwing household items."
-   In the _Rocko's Modern Life_ episode "Uniform Behavior" Heffer takes a job as a security guard. The stress of the position causes him to have a _Shining_\-style mental breakdown and flee into the streets tearing off his clothes. He catches the attention of a police officer who notes 10-41, naked cow in public.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   Used in "Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder":
        
        **Chief Wiggum:** Alright smart guy, where's the fire?  
        **Homer:** Over there.  
        (_Homer points at a fire at the police station_)  
        **Chief Wiggum:** Okay, you just bought yourself a 317, pointing out police stupidity... Or is that a 314? Nah nah, 314 is a dog uh, in, no or is that a 315?... You're in trouble pal.
        
    -   In "Realty Bites", Wiggum reports "a 318 - Waking a Police Officer".
    -   In "So It's Come to This: A Simpsons Clip Show" Wiggum refers to code 8 after a beer explosion, prompting Lou to report "we need pretzels, repeat, pretzels!"
    -   A non-police variant for truckers CB codes occurred in "Maximum Homerdrive".
-   Snooper and Blabber frequently talk in police code when they have a case on their hands. Take this example from "Person to Prison", when Blab gave Snoop the wrong code.
    
    **Snooper:** A 7-08 is an elderly boy scout trapped in a pup tent in Mesopotamia.  
    **Blabber:** I'm sorry, Snoop. I mean a 7-0**9**.  
    **Snooper:** Rumor of a jailbreak in Sing-Song Prison, eh?
    
-   _Star Wars Rebels_: The Empire uses an emergency code system that it took over from the Grand Army of the Republic. In "Stealth Strike", Kanan and Rex have to infiltrate an Imperial Interdictor. Rex uses his knowledge of the emergency code system (which he helped _invent_) to convince the crew to let them board in a stolen unscheduled shuttle. The codes are not explained any further than that a 157 is something that can occur on a shuttle and may develop into a 3376, which is _not_ something you want to happen on your starboard side, even if you're sitting in an experimental cruiser inside a restricted 675 testzone.
    -   Later in the episode, Kanan and Rex accidentally start a conversation with an Imperial officer in an Uncomfortable Elevator Moment. The officer snidely comments that Rex's armor looks tight on him and Rex mutters an insult under his breath, but Kanan covers him by saying that he has hyper-sickness and that he's taking him to the, uh, 257 — which is the commissary. The officer snarks that the commissary is the _last_ place he'd want to take him before leaving.
-   _Taz-Mania_: In "To Catch a Taz", Wendal arrests Thickley on "a 219; a fashion faux pas".
-   _WordGirl_ has around 1000 "emergency plans", usually using one or more per episode. She apparently has done them all at least once before, since Tobey and Dr. Two-Brains both have complete records of what each plan does.

    Real Life 

-   ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases) is a widely used system for medical coding that is published by the World Health Organization. Being vast and attempting to classify every cause of literally every health problem, this leads to some quite bizarre and odd entries. Examples:
-   In North America, psychiatrists and psychologists use the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) system to classify mental illnesses which is overall similar to the ICD, but has a few quirks of its own. Examples:
    -   Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, a controversial addition in which children are highly irritable and repeatedly have severe temper tantrums
    -   Ganser syndrome, a kind of factitious (i.e. faked) psychosis which features giving nonsensical and bizarre answers to questions and instructions; often found in prisoners (removed from the latest edition)
    -   Caffeine-Induced Sleep Disorder (being unable to sleep from drinking too much coffee), REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (acting out one's dreams, like sleepwalking but much more elaborate), Restless Leg Syndrome (kicking and twitching of the lower limbs while in bed)
    -   Rumination syndrome, a rare condition in which one regurgitates immediately after eating (reflexively, not intentionally like in bulimia)
    -   Culture-bound syndromes, or mental disorders that only exist in one culture. Though they can be explained within the context of their own culture, they are often bafflingly odd from a Western point of view:
        -   Taijin kyofusho, or social anxiety due to fear of appearing ugly or smelly, found in Japanese culture - a similar condition called _olfactory reference syndrome_ exists in Western culture.
        -   Dhat syndrome, a delusion of losing male potency from a lack of semen, found in South Asian cultures
        -   Qigong psychotic reaction or having a psychotic break from doing a kind of moving meditation called qigong, found in Chinese culture
        -   Zār, dissociative episodes stemming from a belief of having been possessed by a spirit, found in Middle Eastern cultures
-   Back when telegrams were commonly used, they would charge by the word. Various commercial codes were developed to try and reduce costs for businesses that would send hundreds of telegrams every day.. They weren't exactly secret (though companies could also use secret codes) and were printed in books. Some examples of code words for oddly specific situations.
    -   **ENBET:** Captain is insane
    -   **PAROMELLA:** While leaving dock/harbor, struck the pier, damaging the stern.
    -   **ANTITACTE:** Mozambique, loading at not more than two places, to \_\_\_\_, steamer for about \_\_\_\_ tons general cargo at \_\_\_\_ per ton on the d/w capacity to cargo
