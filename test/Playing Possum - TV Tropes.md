_"Quando omni flunkus, moritati." <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>_ 

A small-scale exchange of fire has just taken place. The bad guys see one of the heroes lying on the ground, apparently dead, with a sword or whatever sticking out of them.

They approach the apparent corpse, or corpse is brought to them via The Body Bag Trick. As they stand over them, the "corpse" opens their eyes. And beats them up.

In Real Life, this is a _war crime_ and has been since at least 1948. The Laws and Customs of War state that those soldiers that are _hors de combat_ ("out of the fight") a category that includes prisoners, the severely wounded, sailors abandoning ship, the dead and ejecting aircrew — although not paratroopers — are not to be attacked. Feigning that status is perfidy and highly illegal, since it would lead to the other side killing the genuinely wounded on the spot (which is a war crime too) to make sure.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Of course, fictionally (and non-fictionally), you're often up against people who aren't signatories to the Geneva Conventions... That said, provided that you don't initiate attack, playing dead until your enemy goes away is not a war crime.

Playing dead in Real Life does have its perks in specific situations. When being confronted by certain animals, like bears, who are hardwired to mostly take interest in prey that look alive and kicking, if you can pull it off long enough the animal in question will most likely leave your body alone, giving you a chance to escape<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .

Note that Playing Possum is a phrase inspired by the Virginia opossum (colloquially, many American dialects drop the first "o" from the name when spoken, hence the term), which famously feigns death and produces a rotting smell. Australian possums (which are named after the Virginia opossum) are not noted for employing this strategy. Unfortunately for the opossum, this response to danger is involuntary and often leaves it incapacitated in a dangerous situation.

Subtrope of Faking the Dead. Buried in a Pile of Corpses is a specific sub-trope. See also I Surrender, Suckers. Compare Defensive Feint Trap and Sick Captive Scam, in which a captive pretends to be hurt or ill rather than dead to get the drop on his captor. Contrast Finger-Twitching Revival and Of Corpse He's Alive. Not to be confused with Dead Person Impersonation. May involve a Mistaken Death Confirmation depending on the circumstances.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Lubbock from _Akame ga Kill!_ plays it after an attack so his opponent thinks he killed him. But when he realizes that his opponent wants to murder a young woman, he gives up the play and attacks him.
-   Several of the immortals in _Baccano!_ do this when they realize the immediate threat they're facing won't leave right away. They have the ability to will their bodies not to reform back into a whole for an undisclosed amount of time, but it has been implied that a person can go for minutes in this apparently dead state.
-   Hei from _Darker than Black_ does this in the second episode, at which point we and some hapless goons learn both that his Badass Longcoat is bulletproof and that he doesn't really go in for that whole "fighting fair" thing.
-   The Big Bad of _EDENS ZERO_ uses this to get a surprise attack on Poseidon Nero. What really sells it is that the Big Bad, Ziggy, is a robot who just got decapitated, something not all robots are guaranteed to survive, and makes his move with his headless body right after Nero shows off his "lifeless" head.
-   In _Future Diary_ the members of the temple of Tsubaki play this. But Yuno quickly realizes that it's just played.
-   In _Goblin Slayer_ a goblin shaman in the first episode pretends to have been killed in order to surprisingly attack the titular hero. But he already has enough experience to see through it quickly.
-   _Inu Baka_: Lupin always tries to play dead whenever he's intimidated by something (usually by much larger dogs).
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   In _Battle Tendency_, Joseph does this to evade notice from the Pillar Man Wamuu to head for a nearby mine cart.
    -   _Stardust Crusaders_: Jotaro plays dead in order to draw his opponent, DIO, within attacking range. As Jotaro currently has a bunch of knives in his body, he can't afford to take any more hits from DIO, so he waits until DIO is practically inches from him, having to stay silent while holding his breath and temporarily _stopping his heart_ to make DIO come closer to deliver the blow to his head. During this, Jotaro points out the irony of the situation: his opponent can stop time, during which Jotaro has to put a lot of effort into moving, but now, he's putting all his effort into remaining as immobile as he can.
    -   _Golden Wind_: In his battle with Cioccolata, Giorno lands a bullet straight into his head and Cioccolata drops dead. But Giorno immediately could tell he's faking it and takes the time to explain how he knows Cioccolata is pretending to be dead and how he'll approach to finish him off. Cioccolate quickly drops the act and tries to kill Mista, only for a stag beetle to burst out of him from the bullet that was shot by Gold Experience.
-   Deed attempts this during the finale of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_ so she can perform one last sneak attack on Teana (it fails thanks to Vice), though since she was struck by stun rounds, it's more accurate to say that she was playing unconscious instead of playing dead.
-   In _Monster Musume_, an orc terrorist guns down a special forces operative trying to sneak up on him, leaving her riddled with bullet holes and lying dead on the ground. Then the operative later gets up and shoots other terrorists with rubber bullets, revealing that she's a zombie, so she was already dead to begin with.
-   _One Piece_: During the Arlong Park Arc, Usopp is chased by one of Arlong's men, but manages to escape him by covering himself in ketchup and pretending to have been hit by one of the fishman's water bullets. However, Usopp becomes ashamed of how cowardly he's being while everyone else is fighting for their lives and calls the fishman back for a _real_ fight. He gets beaten up a bit, but perseveres and actually manages to win.
-   Jessie and Gourgeist when the latter was a Pumpkaboo do this to a Salamence in an episode of the Kalos arc of the Pokémon anime series, letting its guard down long enough for Jessie to put a device on it, which causes the Hoenn dragon to go on a rampage and blast Team Rocket off again, requiring the Nurse Joy of this episode’s Wigglytuff to fight it, due to the Kanto Pokémon now having an advantage because of its Fairy typing.
-   _Rebuild World_:
    -   A Scary Scorpions type of monster does this to ambush hunters. Akira has to have his Virtual Sidekick Alpha highlight the living ones with his Augmented Reality vision to know which bodies are safe and which to attack.
    -   Since Alpha is Invisible to Normals, one time when someone actually can see her, she makes a simulation of her body being killed and leaves it there (it is only an avatar after all), continuing to act as Mission Control. She uses this to distract Akira's opponent at just the right moment with what looks like an attack from behind, allowing Akira to strike.
    -   Akira undertakes a Training the Peaceful Villagers task to turn Sheryl's slum gang into a hunter gang with AR training, where Alpha provides her Mission Control assistance to Akira's opponents in mock battle. She orders them to play possum, making Akira move up to them and head shot them with simulated rounds to counter this.

-   Sakura from _Zombie Land Saga_ resorts to playing dead (even though she's already a zombie) when the parent of a baby boar shows up in front of her. Needless to say, the boar reacted by eating her and separating her head from her body.

    Comic Books 

-   _Commando_. One story features an American soldier who specialises in disarming the Booby Traps left behind by the retreating Germans. He starts discovering taunting messages inside the traps, left for him personally by the German soldier who planted them.

As the American had defused all his bombs, the German had decided to use himself as the ultimate booby trap.
-   _Kid Colt (2009)_: Sherman Wilks' first attack on Colt and his sidekick Hawk starts with a rifle shot that takes Colt off his horse, and Hawk worries that he's dead. He's actually playing possum, as the bullet only hit his gun arm - which doesn't surprise Cold Sniper Wilks at all, as he wasn't shooting to kill in the first place.
-   _Preacher_: Cassidy does this when investigating a Serial Killer's apartment. Just as he finds the corpses (and the guy whose face was cut off and nailed back upside down) he hears the police coming in and realizes he's been set up.

    Comic Strips 

-   In one _Garfield_ strip, while travelling through the countryside, Jon has a car game where he, Garfield, and Odie imitate animals they see. After seeing cows and pigs in a field, he cries "A possum!" as there's the "Thump!" of the car hitting something in the road, with the next panel having Garfield and Odie on their backs with their limbs sticking up.
    
    **Jon:** _(annoyed)_ Very funny.

    Films — Animated 

-   _Ice Age: The Meltdown_: The opossum brothers Crash and Eddie, as well as their adopted mammoth sister Ellie, do this every time they notice a predator. Unfortunately for them, they're rarely wise about it; the first time they demonstrate it, it's against a vulture who is neither fooled nor picky about eating dead things. Another time, Ellie tries playing dead while Cretaceous and Maelstrom are destroying the ice float she's standing on, to which Crash and Eddie have to get her to move because she'll drown if the two sea monsters don't decide to eat her anyway.

    Literature 

## By Author:

-   This tactic is used so often in the WW2 novels by Sven Hassel that veteran soldiers never pass an enemy corpse without putting a bullet in it.

## By Title:

-   In the German book series _Chronik Der Unsterblichen_ the hero gets ambushed. Together with some soldiers, he has to resist an attack by robbers. One of the soldiers pretends to have been killed in combat, but the hero says it will not do help him much because the robbers will later probably make sure that all who attacked them are really dead.
-   _Conqueror_: Tsubodai comes up with such a plan in _Wolf of the Plains_ when the Mongols move to attack the Shizuan fort. Those with the hammers feign death and, when the Xi Xia soldiers come to loot their corpses, they jump up and attack the now-open fort with the rest of the Mongol army waiting just around the mountain.
-   Harry in _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_. He is apparently killed by Voldemort. It doesn't quite work. He ends up playing possum until he can slip away unnoticed, only to confront Voldemort again and come out on top.
-   _Honor Harrington_ : In _On Basilisk Station_, Honor convinces the Havenite spaceship _Sirius_ that _Fearless_ (Honor's spaceship) is dead in the water, so it will come close to finish her with a barrage... only for her to avoid the barrage and bring out her grav lance, which leaves _Sirius_ wide open for a devastating attack that destroys it.
-   Invoked in _The Inheritance Cycle's_ third installment, _Brisingr_, when King Galbatorix starts enchanting soldiers so they feel virtually no pain. They can thus play possum when they really _are_ sorely wounded.
-   This is used in _The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers_, during the siege of Helm's Deep. After Aragorn and Éomer have run off a group of Uruk-hai, a dozen of them pretend to be dead and leap up on them when their backs are turned — only to have Gimli pop up and cleave off two of their heads.

-   In Bernard Cornwell's _Sharpe's Triumph_, Sharpe survives Dodd's massacre, as the Sole Survivor, in the opening by this method.
-   In Robert A. Heinlein's _Time Enough for Love_, Lazarus Long, having lived for 2,000 years and fought in numerous wars, mentions that he knows to "waste" a bullet in any "corpses" he runs across during battle.
-   In Dan Abnett's _Warhammer 40,000_ Gaunt's Ghosts novel _Blood Pact_, when Maggs attacks Kolding, he goes down. Gaunt tries to stop Maggs, and Kolding reappears to clock Maggs from behind; he explains to Gaunt that he thought it wiser to stay down — and that Maggs had clearly been hallucinating.
-   This is the favorite move of Firestar from _Warrior Cats_. When in an enemy's grasp, he goes limp, making the enemy think he or she has won. Then when they're least suspecting it, he strikes!
-   _The Witch of Knightcharm_: An evil Wizarding School considers this to be a valid tactic for winning duels. The protagonist Emily winds up fighting her roommate and loses when the roommate, Megumi, collapses and fakes being defeated until Emily lets her guard down, at which point she unleashes a powerful attack which knocks Emily out of the dueling ring.
-   In _The Witchlands_, when a group of pirates is searching the shore for any survivors of a battle, Iseult covers her face and pretends to be one of the dead.

    Live-Action TV

Once all the Mountain Men are inside the dorm, one of them just barely has time to realize the gas canisters have been put in buckets of water, neutralizing them, before the kids rise up and start killing the Mountain Men with Improvised Weapons.
-   Downplayed slightly on _Babylon 5_: During the Earth-Minbari War, Sheridan destroyed the Minbari warship _Black Star_ by luring it into a Space Mines trap with a distress signal. The distress signal _was_ legitimate, as Sheridan's ship had been crippled by the _Black Star_ and assumed to be dead (and they went along with pretending to be dead at first until they could set the trap), but as per Word of God, Sheridan knew that the Minbari response to a distress call would be to find and destroy the surviving ship, not to rescue the crew, and that they'd get there before any EarthForce assistance could arrive.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_. In "Helpless" the Monster of the Week gets round the Must Be Invited problem by wrapping himself in Buffy's red cloak (which he took from Buffy earlier) and lying on the verandah.

-   Michael and Sam get into a fight by a pier in _Burn Notice_.

Michael goes limp as if he has passed out, waits for Sam to drop his guard and then wallops him hard enough to knock him out for real.
-   _Call of the Wildman_ once demonstrated why this idiom exists when a literal possum pretended to be injured while Turtleman was trying to remove it from a house. It wound up being removed anyway but the ploy briefly worked.
-   _Carnival Row_: Vignette pretends she hanged herself in the holding cell to escape when the police open it. She then tries to flee but is caught.
-   _Community_: this seems to be Troy's go-to move when caught in an awkward situation or confronted by someone angry with him, typically with him saying something along the lines of "pretend like you're asleep", such as when he and Abed caught mocking other students during the end tag of "Social Psychology".
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   In "The Invasion of Time", one of the savage Gallifreyans, after telling Leela I Will Only Slow You Down.

He's a British guy in the Royal Navy, so we still love him. He was sent to accompany General Charette to brief Captain Pellew about their progress, but nearly everybody in the troop gets killed except him, and the General advises him to disguise himself and return back to his ship, as it is not right to die in a foreign war. In addition, the French soldier was stealing valuable things from the dead and had it coming.
-   _Kyūkyū Sentai GoGoV_ and _Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue_ had the Rangers pulling this once to beat the Monster of the Week. They took a powerful attack head on and dropped on the ground laying motionless, waiting for the monster to approach before blasting him at point-blank range with their V-Lancers.
-   _One Life to Live_. Blair leaves her husband Asa to die of a heart attack. When she returns home and prepares to play the grieving widow, she's terrified when he leaps up and grabs her arm (it was merely chest pain and he recovered after getting the pills she denied him).
-   _Primeval_ presents it with humour. Connor is supposed to watch out for an anaesthetized Raptor, but he asks if the Raptor is really stunned or if he just does not play it. Nick jokingly says that raptors are intelligent animals and that he should just be careful.

-   _Star Trek: The Original Series_:
    -   In episode "Journey to Babel", Kirk defeats an untouchably fast enemy ship by shutting down the Enterprise ship's power and pretending to be dead, causing the enemy ship to close in for the kill; this allows the Enterprise to disable the ship with one well-placed phaser shot.

    -   In "The Ultimate Computer", the M5, convinced that "murdering" men and women on the starships in the war games deserves death, deliberately drops the Enterprise's shields to induce the other ships to destroy it. Kirk keeps the shields down in order to restore communications and the commander of the opposing force breaks off attack. Spock comments that this is just the type of trick that the M5 would have played, but Kirk trusted the other captain.
-   _Supernatural_. In "Nightshifter", Sam and Dean are hunting a shapeshifter who likes to Kill and Replace their victims. They find a corpse of a woman who is apparently alive in their custody, so they seize her and drag her off to confront her with the evidence. On seeing her own corpse she faints, whereupon the corpse comes to life as it's the shapeshifter playing dead.
-   A random, unnamed soldier does this in an episode of _Torchwood_, Faking the Dead in order to attempt to kill an alien. Most of the guards stationed at the entrance to a stockpile of United Kingdom nuclear weapons have all been slaughtered by the attacking alien, who has now crossed the entrance and is approaching the facility itself, when suddenly one of the soldiers lying on the ground bounds up, grabs his assault rifle and starts gunning right into the alien's back. It fails (damn forcefields), but still, badass.
-   _Treadstone_. A Treadstone agent shoots The Handler, clipping his ear with a bullet, so the handler falls to the ground and plays dead until the agent rides off on his motorcycle, then gets in his car and does the same. We then see the agent hiding by the road until the handler drives past so he can follow his handler back to his superiors.
-   _Ultra Series_: Kaiju can do it too!
    -   _Return of Ultraman_ has Jack battling King Maimai and utterly obliterating the monster in a Curb-Stomp Battle. Jack was about to execute the monster with his Specium Beam, but then King Maimai falls over, motionless and seemingly dead, so Jack decides to leave only for the monster to suddenly get up and ambush Jack via Projectile Webbing. Jack does managed to unwrap himself in time and finally kill Maimai for good by turning his Ultra Bracelet into an IED and shoving it down Maimai's throat.
    -   _Ultraman Ace_ has the monster Daidarahoshi, who seem to instantly get up once he's knocked down, until Ultraman Ace lands a devastating attack on Daidarahoshi's midsection. The monster seems to be down for real this time... nope, when Ace moves in closer for a better look, it got back up on his feet and tries to choke the life out of Ace.
-   _Wednesday_: When she's nearly caught sneaking into the morgue, Wednesday hides in one of the cabinet freezers. The coroner sees her, but assumes she's a recent delivery that he missed, even poking her face a few times to be sure (Wednesday keeps her deadpan expression the whole time). When Thing releases her, she asks for five more minutes.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   This is a trademark trope of Bret Hart. He would often fake being injured far more severely than really was (usually with the leg) in order to sucker his opponents into pinning predicament. During his feud with Vince McMahon in 2010, he executes a Batman Gambit revolving around this trope to screw his Arch-Enemy.
-   Used brilliantly by A.J. Lee in order to win the 2013 Diva's Battle Royale: early in the match, she gets kicked in the face and is apparently knocked out cold. She remains lying on the floor, 'unconscious', until there's only one competitor left, Layla, who thinks she's won. Layla is quickly told that she has to get AJ out of the ring to win; AJ keeps up the pretence until Layla's trying to haul her over the ropes, and then she pulls away and kicks Layla out of the ring.

-   In _Henry IV, Part 1_, Falstaff collapses in the middle of a fight to make his assailant leave him alone, while Hal gets on with fighting against Hotspur and kills him. After Hal has lamented for his dead enemy (the son his father would have preferred to have) and his dead friend (the man who regards Hal as the son he never had) and left the stage, Falstaff looks around cautiously in case Hotspur too is Playing Possum, stabs his corpse just to make sure, and then picks up corpse as evidence of his victory over Hotspur. When Hal points out that, actually, _he_ was the one who killed him, Falstaff exclaims indignantly: "How this world is given to lying!"

    Video Games 

-   _Army of Two_: Rios and Salem can "Feign Death" after taking a certain amount of damage. They will collapse to the ground as if they had been killed, allowing them to recuperate while the enemies fire at the player's partner. This only works once per battle, since the enemies will see through the ruse and continue shooting them on subsequent attempts.
-   Splicers start doing this regularly by the end of _BioShock_, but it's certainly a scare the first time. "We tricked you, _monster!"_
    -   This may trick your eyes, but not your interface: your targeting reticle will turn red when it aims at a seemingly dead corpse that is really a live splicer in ambush. Regular corpses have it keep its standard white color. Also, they'll still be holding their guns.
-   _Call of Duty_:
    -   Some enemy soldiers, when wounded, will lay on the ground dying, but pull out a grenade or pistol and wait for the player to get close. It's also possible to do this in multiplayer, where if critically wounded your character can either pull out a pistol and try to take the enemy down with them (Last Stand), or drop a live grenade and blow themselves up (Martyrdom).
    -   _Call of Duty: World at War_: The Japanese sometimes do this _without_ being wounded first; at one point in the first mission, the player and his squad happen upon what appears to be a group of corpses. Within seconds, a flare shoots up, blinding everyone while the soldiers get up and surprise attack the unprepared Marines.
-   _Dead Space_ has necromorphs do it, but it falls flat in part because after the first time people are never ever trusting of a dead body.
    -   On the harder difficulty, however, the necromorphs will do it _after you've shot them_. Remember kids: In this game, just because you shoot its head off and it falls down _doesn't mean it's dead_.
    -   In the second and third games, any attempt by the necromorphs to do this falls flat, since when a necromorph dies, it drops an item. Did it just "die" without dropping anything? It's still alive, stomp it to death.
-   In _Detroit: Become Human_, this is one possible way for Kara and Alice to escape being killed by the U.S. military during the chapter "Crossroads".
-   _Divinity: Original Sin II_: Undead player characters have the unique "Play Dead" skill, which pauses the Cooldown counters on their other skills but causes enemies to ignore them — the ruse is easier to maintain when one has no vital signs at the best of times.
-   _Dragon Age_: The rogues have an ability called "feign death", which is Exactly What It Says on the Tin.
-   _Dual Cat_: Exaggerated and Played for Laughs. The main character, Erwin, is so good at playing dead that enemies ignore him, _bullets don't hurt him_ and _**rooms temporarily change their structure**_ when he's in this state. He puts this skill to use to navigate a dangerous lab where his friend Max is kept captive.
-   _Expert_ have a mook enemy wearing green uniforms, who needs two shots to kill. When shot the first time they'll fall over like every other mook, only to suddenly sit up and shoot you In the Back with their sidearm. Though you could tell they're not dead since they don't drop an item.
-   _Fire Emblem: Awakening_: Basilio takes advantage of Lucina's warning that Walhart killed him in her timeline to allow Walhart to _nearly_ kill him and play dead, which proves to be crucial in Out-Gambitting Validar whose spies were no longer following "a dead man".
-   In _Five Nights at Freddy's_, you get a phone call from your predecessor mentioning that if push comes to shove, playing dead can fool the animatronics into thinking you're an empty costume, saving you from getting stuffed into a metal-laden costume, though he doesn't think it the best idea. In the event that you run out of power, though, playing possum could buy you enough time to make it to the end of your shift ... key word being "_could_". If it comes to this, don't move a single muscle, or Freddy will kill you.
    -   Contrary to what Phone Guy says though, playing possum is practically the only way to survive 4/20 mode, because you will most likely run out of power near the end.
-   In _Half-Life 2_, there are several times that zombies fake being dead to then try to jump you when you approach them. Fortunately, it is relatively easy to test it by shooting things at them with the Gravity Gun.
-   _Hollow Knight_ gives us Soul Master, who goes down with a long and flashy death sequence, before collapsing and dropping your reward like most other bosses. You get as far as walking up to your new spell and watching half of the absorption animation before he pops out of it and breaks the arena floor for another round.
-   _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_: There are numerous old battlefields where the decayed husks of Guardians can be found and looted. Some of these Decayed Guardians are still alive and can still shoot at Link with their laser turrets. Even worse, sometimes fully intact Guardian Stalkers (distinguished by still having their legs) will be sitting among the Decayed Guardians waiting for Link to pass by before chasing him.
-   _Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater_: Snake is equipped with a fake death pill in case he gets outnumbered, which drops his vital functions down to almost nothing. When the coast is clear, he can bite down on the Revival Pill embedded in his tooth to get back into action.
-   _Monster Hunter (2004)_: The monster Gypceros will feign death once he receives enough damage. If you fall for it and start carving him, he will flail around wildly, dealing huge damage if you're too close. You can tell if he's just pretending by checking your quest info or by throwing a paintball at it: if the dot in the map is pink, he's still alive, if it's grey he is really dead. You can also tell if he's the only monster to fight and the "quest complete" notice hasn't shown up yet. Players on capture quests can use this time to set up a trap for when he wakes back up, as he's low on health enough to be captured when he does this trick.
-   _No More Heroes_: Bad Girl will drop at random and start crying, though there are times her hands are completely off her bat, which means she's open to a Travis Touchdown spanking. If she's got one hand on her bat, approaching her is a bad idea.
-   Assassins in _Nuclear Throne_ will pull this trick to try and sneak up on the player, but have a subtle tell that sets them apart from actual corpses.
-   _\[PROTOTYPE\]_: Near the end, Alex pulls this off to get close to Gentek director McMullen.
-   In _Radia Senki Reimeihen_, this takes the place of the escape command, where the entire party plays dead to trick enemies into leaving. Curiously, this can be used (and works best) before the battle has even begun, with the result that monsters leave your party untouched after the sight of them apparently gives everyone fatal heart attacks.
-   In _Ragnarok Online_, Novices can learn Trick Dead to play dead and drop all enemy aggro while doing so. This skill is forgotten when the character changes class, even to a Super Novice.
-   In _Red Dead Redemption II_, opossums will try this, appropriately enough. Get too close to one and it will slump to the ground, complete with prompts to skin it or pick it up. If you try to do so, it will suddenly hiss, causing Arthur to step back, before it flees.
-   _Resident Evil_:
    -   The zombies in several of the games have a tendency to do this, falling to the ground after you've damaged them enough, but getting back up a short while later (or gnawing on your legs if you get too close). The key is that they're not really dead until you see the spreading pool of blood beneath them. You can also encounter some zombie bodies lying on the ground that fools many first-time players into thinking they're already dead, only to immediately get bitten at the ankles and find out that the body was a zombie lying in wait.
    -   _Resident Evil: Outbreak_: Jim Chapman can do it right back to them, plummeting to the ground to make zombies ignore him for a while. It's balanced by the virus gauge climbing at a much faster rate, so you can't just lay there forever.
-   The enemies in _Rise of the Triad_ will attempt this, both in playing dead and faking surrender to get you to lower your weapon.
-   _Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice_ plays with this trope. When your health bar is depleted, you really are dead, but thanks to your Resurrective Immortality, you can revive back on the spot. Once an enemy sees that you've died, most non-bosses will turn back and return to their posts, giving you a chance to sneak up and land a Back Stab on them. However, if you wait too long to revive yourself, you will stay dead and get booted back to the last checkpoint.
-   In _Shin Megami Tensei IV_, one boss, King Kenji, will exclaim that you beat him and fall down, and an option to grab the item you were fighting for appears. It's a trap and you're supposed to ignore the item, as the boss will get back up and continue fighting afterwards.
-   _Splinter Cell: Conviction's_ co-op crosses this with last stand. After being shot Kestrel or Archer can go down, then lean up and start shooting. They've still been shot however and will bleed out without the other agent giving them some first aid.
-   In _Syndicate_ (2012), Agents Ramon and Merit do this. When you approach them to do a CHIP-rip, they get back up and attack.
-   _Tales Series_:
    -   Karol from _Tales of Vesperia_ can do this with one of his skills in order to regain HP/TP and escape enemy notice after he's been knocked down. He's a bit cowardly, so it fits.
    -   Returns as a skill usable by multiple party members in _Tales of Xillia_, cowardly or not.
-   _Team Fortress_:
    -   _Team Fortress Classic_: This is one of the powers of the Spy, either dropping silently pretending to be a corpse that's been there for a while or with a loud death cry. Beating A Dead Player ensues. Due to an oversight by the developers (the feigning Spy is "solid" while a dead body isn't), anyone can instantly recognize feigning Spy just by walking over him. What happens then is known as "Crowbar".
    -   _Team Fortress 2_: The Dead Ringer drops a fake corpse when the Spy is damaged, and makes the Spy invisible. Can be very useful to get behind and backstab an enemy, if they don't hear the Dead Ringer's very loud decloaking noise.

-   In the Future level of _Time Commando_, there are space-suited monkey things that will try to do this. Remember, it ain't dead if it don't fade!
-   _Tomb Raider: Anniversary_: The final boss goes down and Lara slowly approaches with her guns drawn. The boss turns her head and then quickly leaps to Lara, grabbing her by the neck, and tossing her aside while taunting her with "I cannot die, you fool. Sooner or later, you'll run out of bullets!" This may be a lampshading of the fact that Lara _never_ runs out of bullets (at least for her basic guns).
-   _Unreal_ and _Unreal Tournament_: In the earlier editions of the game, it caused the player to rather obviously fall over very slowly without bending any joints, leading to a "hinges in the feet" type of effect. Later games corrected this with the use of a ragdoll engine, though it returns in _Unreal Tournament III_.
-   _World of Warcraft_: Hunters' Feign Death move. Like similar moves in other MMOs, it causes monsters to stop attacking the Hunter, thinking him dead, although it can fail.
    -   It also has its uses against other players, but since you're still attackable while you're "dead" and your pet will continue attacking them instead of disappearing like it does when you're _really_ dead, it's unlikely to fool them for long. But even though smart players can see through it easily, the fact that it forces them to stop targeting you can nonetheless save your skin, as it'll interrupt any abilities that have a cast time and possibly get them to focus on somebody else in the vicinity instead.
    -   Truth in Television, as it turns out, _World of Warcraft_ saved the life of one kid.
-   Riki from _Xenoblade Chronicles 1_ can do this to make enemies leave him alone and become invincible for the duration. However, he's so durable that his HP will rarely get low enough to warrant its usage, and the minor heal and brief damage buff it provides upon its expiration aren't worth the amount of time he needs to be out of commission. It's not so much bad as it is simply outclassed by the other potential abilities he could be using instead, though.

    Web Comics

    Western Animation 

-   _Ben 10: Ultimate Alien_: Argit's species as the ability to drop their pulse to a near death-like state to fool attackers, to which Ben snarks "How else could a species that annoying survive that long". It helps that Argit actually looks kinda like a humanoid opposum with porcupine quills.

-   In _Justice League Unlimited_:
    -   In "A Better World", the Justice Lords have captured most of the Justice League and have them locked up and heavily monitored, including vital signs, to ensure no chance of escape.

-   _Kung Fu Panda_: In _Secrets of the Furious Five_, Po relates how Mantis had to learn Patience after getting captured and being unable to escape until he played dead and tricked his captors into opening his cage to remove his body. Po of course treats this like an awesome kung fu technique instead of an obvious ploy.
-   _Looney Tunes_:
    -   Elmer Fudd does this in the cartoon "Wabbit Twouble" to avoid being attacked by a bear and it works, then Bugs Bunny decides to have some fun by pretending to be the bear himself. A very similar scene also happened at the end of the cartoon "Hare Remover".
    -   The Bugs Bunny cartoon "The Fair-Haired Hare" and the _Sylvester and Tweety_ cartoon "Muzzle Tough" both share a joke where a character "wears" a bearskin rug and another character shoots it repeatedly thinking that it was playing possum for twenty years straight.
    -   Again presented in "Hare Brush" when Bugs-as-Elmer plays dead, the bear sniffs him, averts, then buries him in a hole (which is actually a cliff ledge, through which Bugs-as-Elmer plummets into a river).
-   In _The Penguins of Madagascar_ episode "Smotherly Love", there is a possum, who, well, plays the possum to beat Hans and free the penguins.
-   The _Pixie and Dixie_ cartoon "Ghost With The Most" has Dixie playing possum when Jinks clobbers him with a fireplace shovel, making a very paranoid Jinks think he's killed Dixie.
-   _The Powerpuff Girls (1998)_ play possum in "Aliver," a reality show where they've been competing against Princess Morbucks who cheats her way through the contests.

Janna provides the distraction, stopping her own heart for 60 seconds, taking the attention of the paramedics away from Marco, allowing him to escape.
-   _The Transformers_: Nightbird, the female ninja robot, uses this tactic on Optimus Prime and the other Autobots after Prime hits her with what he says is a simple stun blast.
-   _Transformers: Animated_: Ratchet does this to Lockdown in "Thrill of the Hunt". Lockdown later responds in kind, saying he'll have to remember that one. Funnily enough, while Ratchet knows the name of the trope, he has no idea what it refers to.
    
    **Ratchet:** The humans call it "playing possum". Don't ask me what a possum is.
    
-   _Yogi Bear_:
    -   In "Yogi Bear's Big Break", one of Yogi's attempts to escape Jellystone Park involves lying motionless on an exiting car's fender to make it look like he'd been shot by a hunter. The plan backfires when the Ranger, knowing that hunting isn't allowed in the park, decides to make sure he's really dead by prodding him with a pin.
    -   In "Baffled Bear" , Yogi plays possum in an effort to avoid getting hit by oncoming traffic (a new superhighway was built around the tree in which he was hibernating). It appears to work, up until he gets flattened by a steamroller.

    Real Life 

-   Truth in Television just recently: at least one "dead" Islamic terrorist turned out Not Quite Dead and killed at least one U.S. soldier. Despite the perfidy and the laws of war mentioned above, the squad was savagely smeared by the media when the same soldiers, days later, shot a "corpse" for making a sudden move. Fortunately, it ended up into nothing.
-   Another example of Truth in Television — during World War II, Japanese and German soldiers often played dead and ambushed US troops when they passed, or took advantage of corpsman willing to treat them by letting off grenades — a cruel move. One Marine veteran wrote of possum squads — Marines who, after a battle, were tasked with bayoneting "dead" enemy corpses.
-   Happened in 1918 in the Finnish Civil War during the battle of Varkaus. The Reds had feigned surrender, and the Whites advanced over a lake of ice to the Reds' positions. Once they were at point-blank distance, the Reds opened machine-gun fire. The Whites retaliated by an all-out attack and having overrun the Reds, then shot every fifth of the captured and wounded Reds on the spot. This incident is known as "Huruslahti Lottery" in Finnish history.
-   In 1984, "Subway Vigilante" Bernard Goetz reportedly told one of his vanquished muggers "You don't look so bad, you could use another" before firing another bullet at him. As the mugger was only shot once, it is unclear if Goetz hit with the first then missed the second, or missed the first and hit the second, and if the mugger was down at the time or if he was still legitimately defending himself against a threatening target.
-   When the State of Qi during China's Spring and Autumn period was entangled in a Succession Crisis in 685 BC, the two pretenders, with their retainers, were racing back to the capital to be enthroned. When a retainer of Pretender Jiu saw Pretender Xiaobai, he promptly shot Xiaobai — but only hit his belt buckle. Xiaobai quickly played possum to fool Jiu's faction and won the crisis.
-   Anthony Sadowski is regarded by historians as the greatest Polish frontiersman of the American Colonial period, being a renowned trader and Native American interpreter. But before he ever immigrated to North America, he went to help defend his native Poland from the Swedish invasion in 1701; his brother was killed in an ambush and Anthony was taken captive. After resisting torture on the rack for two days, he was thrown on a prison ship. He invoked this trope, pretending to be dead so the guards would stop paying attention to him; then, after night fell, he tied a bag of coins around his neck and dove into the water, swimming nine miles back to shore. He escaped recapture and execution by boarding a ship to the United Kingdom.
-   Injured Barn Owls will sometimes go limp and pretend to be dead when being rescued, examined, or treated. The unwary rescuer, animal health professional or rehabilitator can either (a) end up with a handful of talons; (b) wind up chasing an injured but terrified predator around the clinic; or (c) both, if they fall for it.
-   The Trope Namer, the Virginia opossum, mentioned above.
-   This is actually recommended practice when encountering grizzly bears. Wild brown bears aren't generally interested in humans as a source of food, but they do tend to see us as a threat when we wander into their territory especially if they have cubs, so lying down and staying motionless and quiet can get them to leave you alone, if you have no other options. American black bears will just kill you if you try this, so the recommendation is always to retreat (preferably without turning your back on the animal), make noise, and fight as hard as you can, and always be sure of what kind of bear you are dealing with before playing dead. Either way, it's better to be prepared with something like bear spray when going into the woods than trying to rely on Playing Possum working, because the bear you run into might just be the bear who it doesn't work on. Note that it's really less about "playing dead" and more about trying to lay as flat against the ground as you can get while protecting your vital organs in order to minimize the amount of damage the bear inflicts before it loses interest. Also, something like 20% of all grizzly bear attacks are now believed to be unprovoked acts of predation.
-   19th century Ohio anatomist Joseph Nashe McDowell claimed to have done this to avoid being lynched. As was a common practice at the time, he'd acquired a body for dissection via Grave Robbing, only to be tracked down by infuriated relatives of the deceased. Having hidden the body, he lay down on his own dissection table with a sheet drawn over himself and played dead. Checking under the sheet, the vengeful mob didn't recognize him and left him there, assuming he was just another cadaver.
-   The Hognose Snake will often respond to a threat by rolling onto its back with its tongue sticking out and might even poop to simulate a corpse voiding its bowels. As soon as the enemy looks away, it will retreat. Hilariously, if the snake is rolled onto its stomach, it will immediately roll back onto its back, which would defeat the purpose of it pretending to be dead.
-   Foxes sometimes play dead. And when a crow approaches to eat the supposed carcass, the fox attacks them. Hyenas use a similar tactic to catch vultures.
-   In this viral video, an African painted wolf named Notch that was in the jaws of a lioness holds perfectly still pretending to be already dead so it can escape as soon as the lioness lets go.
-   A species of goat called the Tennessee Fainting Goat will do this when it is spooked (typically by a loud noise). The goat with fall over on it's side (or sometimes flat on it's back) with all four legs sticking out straight. Many videos of fainting goats can be found online.
-   One of the survivors of the Jonestown Massacre was a 79-year-old man named Grover Davis. He realized that he had missed the announcement to assemble on the loudspeaker, instead laid down in a ditch and pretended to be dead.
