"Don't hold back."

_"I want you to hit me as hard as you can."_

For whatever reason, one character has to convince another to try to strike them. Perhaps it is in order to show the avoidance skills of the hittee, to teach the hitter how to hit, or to intentionally hurt the hittee. Occasionally, it's to make up for the hittee previously attacking the hitter. One common use is when the hittee is an Action Girl, and the hitter Wouldn't Hit a Girl. Standing close together, the hittee taunts the hitter with ever-escalating demands of "Hit me, dammit!", countered with demurrings of "I can't/won't!"

This continues for several volleys until the hitter strikes the hittee. If it's for comic effect, the hittee is actually surprised and may be knocked out. They may deliver a line of surprise such as, "You hit me!"

Sometimes crosses over with My Fist Forgives You, One Free Hit, or with Self-Mutilation Demonstration ('cause you might ask someone else); frequently shows up in Make It Look Like a Struggle. Strike Me Down with All of Your Hatred! is when someone wants to be hit so that the hitter will break their moral code and fall from grace. Another variant of this trope is when someone asks to be hit because it turns them on, although that usually will have negative consequences. If this is said during a competition, it’s usually because the speaker feels it would be an insult for their opponent to hold back.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Neon Genesis Evangelion_, Touji tells Shinji to hit him as a "macho" way of apologizing.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   Vegeta tries to get Krillin to mortally wound him during the battle against Frieza in _Dragon Ball Z_ in a last-ditch attempt to raise his power (since as a Saiyan, Vegeta receives a power boost from recovering from the brink of death and one of their allies has healing abilities). Krillin's reluctance, however, is more from paralyzing fear (and the fear of actually killing) of Vegeta than anything else.
    -   Much earlier, in _Dragon Ball_, Kami blocked a punch from Piccolo, and after convincing Kami to stay out of his fight, Goku said he owed Piccolo a punch for the one Kami blocked and took one in the face that sent him flying halfway through a concrete wall. Head first. His response? "Good thing they put a wall there." Of course, it they hadn't, he would have landed out of bounds and lost, but still....
    -   Though he does not explicitly request Goku to strike him, Tien grants Goku several minutes of uninterrupted punching during their first match in the World's Martial Arts Tournament. This is "payback" for Chiatzou paralyzing Goku earlier in the match against Tien's wishes allowing him to get in some powerful blows while Goku was unable to defend himself.
-   In _Ranma ½_, Shampoo would only reverse the Laser-Guided Amnesia she gave Akane if male-Ranma would kill girl-Ranma. At the time Shampoo thought girl-Ranma to be a separate person and was honor-bound to kill her. He bargains her down to "half-kill" and he begs for Ryoga (who doesn't want Akane regaining her memory) to half-kill him. After he then goes to insults, they fight and Ranma accidentally knocks Ryoga out, but luckily Soun and Genma are happy to fill in. Soun is so touched that he cries, congratulates Ranma for wanting to help Akane and beats the shit out of him while yelling "THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!"
    -   When Ryoga and Ranma subject Akane to a Traumatic Haircut in the middle of their first big fight, they tell her to punch them. She does. Hard. (This is a girl who can shatter cinder blocks with her bare hands.)
-   _My-Otome Zwei_ uses this in its fourth episode. Arika and Mashiro, after having a petty argument and separated for a while in the first episode, Mashiro asks Arika to hit her, then returns the favor, telling her that when one of them gets stubborn, the other should hit her.
-   After an episode of _Digimon Adventure_ where he had mostly been a total ass, Tai offered Izzy, who had been the main target of Tai's aggression, a free shot as a way of apologizing. Izzy shook his head and explained that he understood what Tai was going through and that there was no need for violence, leading to Izzy's not-so-forgiving companions offering to do it for him.
    
    **Agumon:** Can I hit ya then?  
    **Tentomon:** I wouldn't mind a whack, myself...
    
-   In _Endless Waltz_, The Movie of _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing_, Heero pulls this with Duo as enemy soldiers close in - and then KOs Duo immediately afterwards. Heero's rationale? "One for one - now we're even." This little trick allows both of them to escape individually when they would likely not have been able to do so otherwise.
    -   In the TV series, after being tricked into killing a plane full of world leaders, he gets a pistol and seeks out every single member of all their families... and offers them the chance to shoot him. They all end up forgiving him instead.
    -   Reversed in the very beginning. Since Relena saw him first engage in his mission, he very ominously tells her, "I will kill you." Several times, she ends up with his gun pointed at her. By episode 6, however, she defies him to shoot...and he can't. He agonizes over why.
-   _Soul Eater_:
    -   After Maka punches Black☆Star during an argument, she insists that he punch her back so they'll be even. He's not particularly hesitant, but asks if she's sure all the same. Maka asks him to give it all he's got, and despite the fact that he agrees, everyone expects him to go easy on her. Black☆Star ends up punching her so hard _in the face_ she goes flying into a pile of garbage.
    -   Black☆Star himself tells this to Kid after challenging him to a fight because he was mad at losing several previous fights. Kid obliges by literally stomping Black☆Star's head into a crater.
-   A line in the English dub of _YuYu Hakusho_ has Yusuke asking Keiko to hit him as an apology for his work as Spirit Detective getting her dragged into a potentially fatal situation.
-   In _Eyeshield 21_, near the end of the Devil Bats' match against the White Knights in the Fall Tournament, Monta asked Sena to slap him and fire him up, since Monta's too worn-out to do it to himself. This is quickly followed by every member of the Devil Bats slapping each other to get pumped up (though some get a little carried away).
-   In _The Prince of Tennis_, the standard punishment in Rikkaidai is a slap to the face from Not So Stoic sub-captain Sanada. At least two players have specifically told him to bitchslap them in front of everyone if they lose their match. And so does Sanada, in the finals.
-   Parodied in _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ when Jack Rakan tells Negi to give him his best shot to see if he's strong enough to be worth training. Negi reluctantly does so, and after a dramatic Smoke Shield moment, Jack coughs up a bunch of blood and smacks Negi into the stratosphere for hitting too hard.
    -   Earlier in the story, Yue and Asuna come up against Takahata, their former teacher. Suspicious of how hostile he is towards them, Yue asks him to hit her. Despite Yue being an ordinary school girl and without a method to defend herself, he obliges. Yue suspected he was a fake, since the real one would _never_ hit his students, and missed a few minor details when speaking to them. This convinces her that the entire situation is an illusion and she promptly shatters it.
-   Used in _Hime-chan's Ribbon_ - after the fiasco that establishes Sei Arei as a Jerk, Himeko wants Daichi to hit her. He refuses. She forces him.
-   In the early seasons of _Pokémon: The Original Series_, whenever Misty was forced to use her Psyduck in battle, she would actively encourage her opponents to aim for Psyduck's head (as, though normally ineffectual, it was able to use potent psychic attacks when its headache was strong enough). She once tried this on Ash, but he wasn't having any.
    -   Ash also invokes this trope frequently in the anime, but instead of encouraging an opponent to strike his Pokémon to trigger its powers during a battle, Ash encourages his Pokémon to strike _him_ during training, essentially using himself as a human training dummy.
-   Tsubaki, nice-guy protagonist of _Mysterious Girlfriend X_, insists his girl Urabe give him a nice hard slap to make up for, in a moment of weakness, trying to take advantage of her the previous day. (She does.)
-   Being a Shonen series, _Hunter × Hunter_ is bound to have these, but a notable subversion comes in the Chimaera Ant arc. Morau tells Gon to imagine him as Neferpitou and hit him with the Jajanken as a fake test of determination. This causes Gon to be filled with so much killing intent that it forces Killua to call the whole thing off before things get ugly.
-   Alucard from _Hellsing_ allows his opponents to try to invoke the Chunky Salsa Rule on him before fighting back, because they'll be even more terrified when he does eventually activate his Healing Factor/Lovecraftian Superpower.
-   In Chapter 112 of _Bakuman。_, Mashiro asks Takagi to punch him as his way of atoning for doubting Takagi in the last few chapters. Takagi eventually relents, but goes easy on Mashiro. This eventually leads to an all-out brawl between the two as a way of "indulging in youth".
-   A rare non-physical variant of this trope occurs in _Bakugan_'s fourth season. Due to visions of him and Drago being connected to Mag Mel and Razenoid, Dan begins keeping it to himself and things start going south. From Drago losing control to the two of them leaving for New Vestoria without letting Marucho and Shun know beforehand causes a rift in the group. This only gets worse when they head to Gundalia to assist in driving Mag Mel's forces away from the planet where Dan disobeys orders from Marucho (who had elected himself as the new leader as the Brawlers) to not involve himself. After finding Rafe and Wolfurio after the Brawlers got separated, Dan learns that the reason why his comrades acted the way they did towards him is because they were worried he was taking most of the burden for himself. Once Dan gets the message, he realizes how inconsiderate and arrogant he has been. After the initial battle has ended, he pleads to his friends to yell at him for giving them so much trouble. The Brawlers just stare at him in surprise, but Shun walks towards him, and seeing how he's been with him long enough, Dan expects the most brutal lecture he believes he deserves. What subverts this trope is that instead of busting his grill, Shun offers his hand to Dan, not only welcoming back him back into the Brawlers, but recognizing him as their leader once more.
-   A minor example happens in _Kiznaiver_. In Episode 3, Takeshiro asked to be slapped in the face by Tenga to try and stop Hisomu. However, all three of them along with four other characters are Kiznaivers, meaning any sort of pain one of them receives is collectively felt by the others. This is Played for Laughs when the local neighborhood patrol stop Tenga from hitting Takeshiro, mistaking it for physical abuse.
-   _Doraemon_: Occurs in "Soap Bubbles". Big G asks Noby to hit him for the graffiti he drew on the wall, but Noby doesn't want to hit Big G. Big G hits himself with a frying pan instead.
-   _Steins;Gate 0_: After time leaping back to 2011, the first thing Okabe does once he returns to the lab is demand that he gets socked in the face once more. Daru immediately complies and sends his friend sprawled across the floor with the swing of his fist. Once that has been done, Okabe begins to laugh maniacally, showing that Hououin Kyouma has finally risen from the ashes.
-   In _K-On!_, Mugi asks Ritsu to hit her due to her interpreting getting smacked as a sign of affection after seeing Mio constantly smacking Ritsu. Ritsu is hesitant, so they try getting Mio to do the smacking instead via having Mugi stealing Mio's strawberry. Despite this becoming a Memetic Moral Event Horizon with the fandom, Mio isn't able to give Mugi what she wants. It takes Mugi suggesting that Ritsu was a guy, she would be a great Chick Magnet in order for someone (Ritsu) to smack her. She then takes a framed picture of herself with the resultant Cranial Eruption, called "me and my lump."
-   _Ayakashi Triangle_: Matsuri invites Shadow Mei to beat him if it'll help her get over her grudge on humanity. Matsuri tries to absorb her attacks with his wind shield, but he's only partially successful.

    Comic Books 

-   A fairly extreme version occurred in _Runaways_, where Nico Minoru asked Gert to have her pet raptor bite her, as she has a magical staff that only comes out when she is bleeding. When Gert refused, she stuck her hand in the dinosaur's mouth and told it she was going to choke Gert to death. It bit her.
-   Supergirl: In _Many Happy Returns_, Kara believes—mistakenly—her X-Ray Vision disrupted a woman's pacemaker. She feels so guilty and distraught that when a super-villain shows up, looking for Supergirl, she asks him to beat her up.
-   _Civil War (2006)_: Captain America starts beating the living tar out of The Punisher—who simply lets it happen. When Cap practically orders him to fight back, Castle responds: "Not against you."
-   _Deadpool_ spent the better part of an issue trying to get Wolverine to stab him. When Wolverine ignores him, he Shoryuken'd Kitty Pryde to get him to do it.
-   _Iron Fist (1975):_ An attempted sparring match between Danny and Colleen Wing doesn't get off to a great start because Danny's reluctant to fight Colleen at all, even in practice. K'un-Lun had severe views on gals fighting, and anyone who broke it got exiled or worse.
-   The mutant Multiple Man actually needs to be attacked to activate his powers. So he either has to provoke someone, or outright beg to be attacked. Well, he needs to be hit, but the trigger is sufficiently sensitive that punching his own hand would do it. He only actually needs someone else to punch him if he is very tightly restrained. Of course, sometimes he might let someone hit him for the intimidation factor or for laughs.
-   In _Marvel Zombies_, after a group of superhero zombies eat Magneto, Bruce begs someone to hit him so he can turn into the Hulk as a large bone will come out of his stomach otherwise (as the Hulk's stomach is large enough to hold the bone). Thor does wallop him with the hammer fairly quickly, although it doesn't really work.
-   In _Usagi Yojimbo_, Usagi talks about how he struck his sensei during sparring exercise and began to profusely apologize. However, his sensei waves it off noting that he was waiting for his student to get good enough to connect in a fight.
-   One issue of _Nodwick_ opens with Yeagar trying to get Nodwick to whack him with a mallet. Nodwick only hesitates to confirm that Yeagar is sober and won't be getting back at him for it later, but that's still enough time for Piffany to stumble on them and chastise Nodwick for violence. Yeagar responds to the confusion by grabbing the mallet, and clubbing himself. The reason? So he can show off his new favorite swear word, "Krutz!"
-   _Watchmen_:
    -   A more gruesome version occurs at the end, where Rorschach eggs Dr. Manhattan on to murder him to maintain the masquerade.
    -   Also, when Laurie and Daniel (two retired costumed heroes) reminisce about past supervillains, they talk about a crazy wacko named Captain Carnage who seemed to commit crimes solely so he could be physically beaten by heroes. He encouraged this, until he pulled it on Rorschach and was thrown down an elevator shaft for his trouble. This causes Dan and Laurie to crack up, and then stop as they unconvincingly agree that it's really not funny.
-   In one _Knights of the Dinner Table_ story, Newt Forager insists on giving only an in-universe description of his character, refusing to provide any game-mechanics stats. Stevil decides to scope out this information by getting Newt's character to attack his. It ends with Stevil's character getting knocked out with one blow.
-   _B.P.R.D.: Hell on Earth_: Iosif Nichayko, being sealed in a life-supporting containment suit, finds himself desperate for a drink. He asks his lieutenant Leonid to punch him and break open his helmet; Leonid is reluctant to risk harming Iosif, but relents when Iosif threatens to do the deed himself, using a gun.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Karma in Retrograde_, Touya screams at Bakugou to blast him as much as he wants after getting one too many tongue lashings, reasoning that it doesn't even matter since he'll go back to being the horribly scarred Dabi anyways.
    
    **Touya:** Forget it. I don't even care anymore. Fucking explode me. Because guess what: I'm gonna end up scarred as shit anyways. It doesn't matter! None of it matters!
    
-   In the _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fanfic "Fallout: Equestria", Little Pip goes through an interaction much like this, while trying to get into the Single Pegasus Project. She has to resort to angering Spike, in order to make him angry enough to burn her to death.
-   In this nameless fic by Kioskstuck, Vriska attempts to invoke this trope with her abuse of Tavros. She wants him to attack her so that she'll be able to justify- however thinly- her own cruelty.
-   _In the Service_ has a particular interaction between the main character and Signum in which she misjudges just how much of a funk he's currently in and essentially dares him to hit her. He does hit her, but immediately afterwards says it was undeserved and requests Signum hit him back to make it fair. She does.
-   In _Intrepid_, this is Emma's response to Taylor _already_ hitting her once when they meet again out of costume in 13-03. She feels like she deserves it after what she did.
-   In _Evangelion_ fanfic "Hand Cannot Erase", Shinji feels guilty for nearly destroying the world twice and failing Asuka, so he asks her to punch him. She refuses to, though.
-   In the _Ma Fille_ chapter "Daddy Dearest", after seeing his absentee father Henri threaten his mother with violence, Joe gets in between them and insists Henri hit him instead. Henri initially refuses, and Joe (whose dialogue is typically in French) roars at him "_Do it, you useless bastard!_". However, Henri does not end up hitting Joe, thanks to interference from Joe's daughter Katrina.
-   In the _Discworld_ of A.A. Pessimal, Johanna Smith-Rhodes is a walking fighting Action Girl. On becoming a mother, one of the loving caring maternal things she does is to teach her daughters to fight and use weapons. Her younger daughter is right alongside the idea and eventually follows Mummy to the Assassins' Guild. Her older daughter, however, has no problems at all with blocking, parrying and defending. Rebecka just cannot bring herself to hit her friends, even in a practice bout with a blunted sword. She can also put crossbow bolts with precision into a standard competition target, the one with the rings. She just cannot bear firing at a human-shaped target. Her mother quietly despairs. Until a friend comes up with life-size iconographs of Parsifal Venturi, a young man Rebecka absolutely _loathes_. And if her opponent in a practice sword-bout is wearing a Parsifal Venturi face-mask... then a whole lot of agression comes out. All at once.
-   In _Time Anomaly_ the Doctor uses a variation of this when he claims that he'll give Kang the Conqueror the chance to destroy New York to prove his belief that Kang can't actually do it.
-   _A Prize for Three Empires_: During a fight between Carol Danvers and Rogue, the former wants to beat the latter to the ground for stealing her life, but she hesitates when she notices Rogue is perfectly willing to stay put while she is being punched.
    
    Binary sat there, kneeling on Rogue's legs, and held one fist cocked at the ready. The mutant's face was bruised, even bleeding a bit. But she was awake, and aware.  
    "Go ahead, Carol," said Rogue. "Aren't ya gonna hit me with that big ol' fist? Or are ya gonna just let it hang till all the blood drains down t'your shoulder?"  
    Binary said, "Give me a good reason. Tell me why I shouldn't do it."  
    "Don't have to give you no reasons not to hit me," said Rogue, coughing a bit. "You wanna hit me, go right on ahead. Seems like it's pretty good therapy for you."
    

    Film — Animated 

-   In _Wreck-It Ralph_, Felix and Calhoun are sinking in Nesquik-sand and their only hope of escape is to attract vines of Laffy Taffy towards them so they can climb out. Laffy Taffy are apparently attracted to what makes them laugh, and they happen to like slapstick. Felix outright demands that Calhoun hit him repeatedly in the face, assuring her that he can use his hammer to fix his injuries, so no harm done.
-   In _Turning Red_, Mei asks Abby to hit her in order to see if Mei can stay calm and not turn into a panda. Abby, who likes when Mei is a panda, is happy to oblige.

-   _Chai Lai Angels: Dangerous Flowers_: When the heroines are trapped in the cage, Spadix demands that Gus grope her butt so she can become angry enough to bend the bars apart. (It Makes Sense in Context.) Gus is barely conscious, so Rose takes his hand and clamps it on to Spadix's butt. This does the trick.
-   _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers (2022)_: When Chip and Dale cook up a plan to get the drop on a transmogrified Sweet Pete, who now has the head of a cat, Chip makes Dale hit him over the head with a metal pipe so Circling Birdies can appear and distract him, just as it did to Fat Cat on an episode of their old show.
-   Played disturbingly straight in _Closer_ when Alice and Dan are breaking up and she tells him she slept with Larry. She ends up spitting in his face, and when he raises his hand to her, she says "Go on, hit me. It's what you want. Come on, hit me, fucker!" He does.
-   _The Crowd Roars_: Lee gets hysterical after her selfish Jerkass boyfriend Joe breaks up with her, slapping him across the face. Then, because she is a Love Martyr, she begs forgiveness as he stalks out the door, saying "Joe, you can hit me! Joe, please!"
-   Variation in _The Dark Knight_. Batman is bearing down on the Joker in the Batpod, and the Joker simply stands there, shooting any vehicle that gets in the way, and muttering (eventually shouting) "Come on. _Hit me._" in order to test Batman's resolve. Naturally he is unable to run down the defenseless Joker and swerves to the side at the last second and crashes. The Joker simply turns around, mildly amused, before advancing on the disabled Batman.
    -   Played more straight later on, when the in-custody Joker baits Detective Stephens into attacking him so Joker can use a shard of glass he has hidden on his person to take Stephens hostage and escape. It almost doesn't work because the Genre Savvy Stephens knows Joker is just trying to rile him up for attention (if not the reason _why_ he wants that attention) and ignores him, but then Joker starts mockingly describing the horrible ways he murdered some of Stephens's fellow officers and...
-   In _Dogma_, the demon Azrael dares Silent Bob to hit him with a golf club. He is surprised when it actually defeats him. It turns out the golf club was a Holy Hand Grenade, since the cardinal blessed it to get a better game.
-   _Dog Soldiers_, in the upstairs bedroom, when they're stitching Sarge up:
    
    **Sarge:** Cooper, knock me out! Hit me!
    
    _Cooper smacks Sarge in the head._
    
    **Sarge:** _\[not missing a beat\]_' I said knock me out, you f\*\* kin' pussy!
    
    _\[Cooper punches him again, and Sarge immediately goes limp. Megan and Cooper look at each other, then shrug and go back to stitching Sarge up.\]_
    
    -   Sean Pertwee was actually drunk for this scene; the first punch was a stage punch, the second was an actual punch that actually did drop him. That little pause after it connects is everyone wondering if he's alright...

The actress was actually knocked unconscious, which delayed the filming of the next scene until she woke up.
-   Spoofed in _Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare_. Believing one character to be in danger from Freddy, another character asks the tomboy of the group to knock him out so he can go into the dream world to help. She tries to tell him another way, but impatient, he punches her and she lays him out. A few seconds later, she joins him in the dream world. What she was trying to tell him was that she knew a technique that would allow them to put themselves in a trance and induce sleep.
-   In _Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai_, Louie, believing that Ghost Dog's actions have doomed him to being killed by his own Crime Family, tells Ghost Dog to just shoot him and get it over with. After Ghost Dog initially refuses, Louie just demands it again and louder so Ghost Dog shoots Louie in the shoulder, then justifies it after the fact by saying that Louie will now have a cover story and can claim that Ghost Dog attacked him. This buys Ghost Dog and Louie just enough time for Ghost Dog to wipe out the entire crime family.
-   _Glory_ has a scene early on when Sergeant Mulcahy is teaching the troops the proper use of a bayonet. He singles out the rather bad soldier, Thomas and tells him to stab him. After some hesitation, he makes two attempts, the blows turned away each time ("I said **stab**, not tickle!"). The third time, after the sergeant delivers a rant specifically designed to provoke the poor kid ("You're the worst soldier in this whole company, now hit me!"), he finally gives it his all - and the drill sergeant gives him a lesson in hand-to-hand that he never forgets (seriously).

-   _Life of a Horse Trader_: Yuki is criticizing Yone about his son Daihei when Yone shoves her. Yuki, who is desperately in love with the Oblivious to Love Yone, asks him to hit her, because she likes it.
    
    **Yuki**: Strike me in the way I feel refreshed.
    
-   Not exactly "hit me" in the sense of punching, but in _Looney Tunes: Back in Action_, Yosemite Sam and D.J. Drake are playing blackjack at a casino. Yosemite Sam keeps pestering the dealer (Foghorn Leghorn) to "hit me" (play a card) — and gets a sock in the face because it's not his turn.

-   In _Rocky III_, Rocky taunts Clubber Lang into hitting him repeatedly during the match to get Lang angry so he would lose control. Of course, unlike a real boxer, Rocky is Made of Iron, so it works and he wins. Note that the _Rocky_ fight **is** based on a real bout. Muhammad Ali suspected that stamina was a weakness for George Foreman, so in their 1974 bout Ali taunted Foreman, blocked most of Foreman's blows, then taunted him some more. Foreman tired quickly, and Ali knocked Big George out for the only time in Foreman's career. Similarly, Rocky is trying to defend against all of Clubber's big punches, although just like with Ali-Foreman, some get through.
-   _Smarty_: Vicki's desire to be struck in the face and dominated is her sole motive for constantly needling Tony until he finally does it. She even says "If he'd really loved me, he'd have hit me long ago" to Anita. The film ends with Vicki straight up asking "Tony...hit me again."

-   A variant occurs in _Watchmen_, where Nite Owl II doesn't feel particularly heroic beating up Ozymandias who isn't fighting back anymore. Subverted after The Comedian almost rapes Sally Jupiter.

    Literature

-   This happens all the time in any martial art that involves sparring. One of the earliest mental blocks many students need to overcome is the conditioned urge _not_ to attack.
    -   This also happens in theater or any performing arts that need an actual hit to sell the authenticity (as opposed to using angles or blocking). Much like in martial arts, some exercises also require actors to hit, and get hit by, each other to really understand the feelings and motivations in the act.
