Superman is super guilty right now!

A character has killed a _lot_ of people, and now they're literally haunted by their actions. The appearance of these ghostly victims is a sign of deeply troubled conscience and the loss of their sanity, often the dead are silent or gesturing towards them, and only the person they're haunting can see them. These visions can occur on multiple occasions plaguing the character until they met a similar fate or worse. If the character has had a chance to repent then this is the sign they're beyond salvation and what awaits them in the next life won't be peace but judgement.

Made famous by the haunting of Macbeth by Banquo. Expect plenty of references to the play when this occurs, especially the bloody dagger Macbeth sees before he murders his king, Duncan.

This can overlap with Sanity Slippage and Through the Eyes of Madness if the character isn't literally being haunted, but is just hallucinating due to their guilty conscience. If the story is deliberately ambiguous about whether or not the haunting is real, see Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane.

Compare with Bloody Hallucinations of Guilt, Scrubbing Off the Trauma, Guilt-Induced Nightmare, and Terrible Ticking for other ways to show that a guilty character is troubled by what they've done. Also see Haunted Heroine for when it's the heroine of a story that's being haunted by her past and the uncanny events around her.

-   Alluded to in an issue of _Wolverine_, when Jubilee has Reno and Molochai, the hitmen who'd killed her parents, at her mercy. Wolverine tells her that one "paff" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  to the brain stem and they'd be dead and it would seem like a regular heart attack, aside from two fairly healthy men experiencing it at the same time. Jubilee protests.
    
    **Jubilee:** You've killed people. You've killed so many, and...  
    **Wolverine:** Yeah. You wanna sit up some night and help me talk to all of 'em?  
    **Jubilee:** Oh. _(Settles for a Groin Attack on both men.)_
    

    Fan Works 

-   _to forget is unforgivable_: Shortly after Katsuki told Izuku to "take a swan dive off the roof", Izuku actually _did_ kill himself. While the police learned about the incident, they decide to drop the charges against him, believing that it would be a shame to bar somebody with such a powerful Quirk from becoming a Pro Hero. Izuku thus takes it upon himself to haunt Katsuki, mocking his newfound status as a social pariah. While Katsuki can't see him, he's still aware of his presence, and is gradually worn down. Izuku later makes clear that he wants Katsuki to live with the shame of his actions rather than dying.
-   _Windows of the Soul_: Set after the events of _My-HiME_, the story has Shizuru in early chapters claim to be haunted by the ghosts of the over 800 people she slaughtered in her war on District One, and performing a "bastardized" version of a purification ritual to punish herself. When Natsuki finds out, she tearfully begs her to stop.
-   _Yesterday Upon The Stair_: Several ghosts that have been murdered often choose to hang around the murderer so they can see them get taken down. For example, Stain is haunted by all the pro-heroes he has killed, Muscular is haunted by the Water Hose duo, etc. This usually works to Izuku's advantage as he can use their advice to take them down. However, it comes to bite him when one of the ghosts that haunts Overhaul still has Undying Loyalty towards him even after he killed her, and is taking advantage of Izuku's assumption that she wants revenge to trick him.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Lucille from _Crimson Peak_ is completely oblivious to the ghosts of her past victims, mostly the wives of her brother Thomas and their mother that haunt Allerdale Hall, until the climax. Lucille has just killed her brother/lover in a fit of jealous rage after he tried to stop Lucille from killing Edith, his latest wife. Lucille chases after Edith all over and then outside the mansion trying to kill the younger woman, but is briefly stunned when she sees her brother's ghost. That gives Edith the chance to win their fight and kill Lucille.
-   At the end of _Dr. Mabuse, the Gambler_, Mabuse has accidentally trapped himself in a cellar his gang used to forge banknotes, with the police coming to get him. As he slips into madness, he hallucinates visions of various people that he either killed or Drove to Suicide during the story.
-   A deleted scene of _Saw III_ had Amanda being terrified by a ghostly vision of Adam, who tells her in reversed garble "How could you do this to me?", in a nightmare after she had killed him a while earlier.
-   _The Invisible_ is essentially this trope played out from the perspective of the ghost. Nick is having an out of body experience while he's Not Quite Dead from Annie's beatdown of him. Once he realizes that she can hear him talking, he spends the rest of the movie haunting her so that she will find his body and rescue him.

     Literature 

-   _Don Camillo_:
    -   In "The Dog", Don Camillo and Peppone investigate the mystery of a stray dog which spooks the locals with its blood-curdling nightly howl. They discover the dog is howling each night over a large bag caught in the river reeds which upon inspection is found to contain a decomposing human body. Don Camillo infers that the man in the bag was murdered and dumped into the river, and the victim's dog has been following the corpse floating down the river ever since. The body cannot be identified and the crime is not cleared up, but the narration closes with the assurance that there are certain people (obviously meaning the perpetrators and accomplices of the murder) who still hear the dead man's dog's howling each night, and will do so for the rest of their lives. It is left ambiguous whether those who keep hearing the howl are being supernaturally haunted, or just being tortured by their conscience.
    -   In "Nocturne With Bells" Don Camillo is approached by a man called Biondo who confesses that during the partisan war he murdered a man for his money, but let it look like a politically motivated killing. Though Biondo asserts that he doesn't regret the killing at all, and even though he is legally clear thanks to Italy's postwar amnesty, he desperately wants Don Camillo to absolve him of his sin because each night after nightfall he can see the dead man standing beside his bed.
-   _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_: The _priori incantatem_ spell forces a wand to show an echo of its last spell. When performed on a wand that has cast the killing curse, an echo of the person killed will appear. This is accidentally cast on Voldemort's wand when his and Harry's wands connect, allowing the echoes of those Voldemort has last killed to begin to appear in reverse order: Cedric Diggory, Frank Bryce, Bertha Jorkins, and Harry's parents. While Voldemort shows no remorse, the echoes swarm Voldemort the moment Harry breaks the twin-core connection, giving Harry the chance to grab the portkey and escape.
-   _Matilda_: Invoked by Matilda, who uses her telekinesis and information from Miss Honey to make the superstitious Miss Trunchbull believe she is being haunted by Miss Honey's father, whom Matilda suspects Miss Trunchbull murdered. It works, forcing Miss Trunchbull to flee and allowing Miss Honey to regain her father's house and fortune.
-   _One Hundred Years of Solitude_: José Arcadio Buendía is haunted by the ghost of Prudencio Aguilar, who he killed. They eventually form an odd friendship, because Prudencio is lonely in death and only has his enemy to talk to.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Babylon 5_:
    -   Inverted in "The Quality of Mercy". Talia Winters reads the mind of a convicted Serial Killer scheduled for Death of Personality (so that the court can be sure the mindwipe worked) and has a vision of all the killer's victims. Rather than appear haunted by them, the killer tells her to join the choir.
    -   Discussed in "The Geometry of Shadows" when Londo asks the technomage Elric to foretell his future. Elric says he sees Londo's hand reaching out from the sky, and thousands of voices calling his name from below.
        
        **Londo:** My followers?  
        **Elric:** Your victims.
        
-   _Banjun Drama_: "Since That Day." At the end, the mysterious visions haunting the main character turn out to be of a woman he hit with a car.
-   _Castle_: Invoked in "Poof, You're Dead". Castle and Beckett set up an interrogation with Christian Dahl to find out if he murdered Zalman Drake. He brushes off the questions and threatens to lawyer up... until he sees a spooky apparition of Zalman in the mirror behind Castle and Beckett. He freaks out and accidentally confesses to the murder, allowing Beckett to arrest him. The apparition was actually Zalman's twin brother Edmund, appearing through the two-way mirror standard in police interrogation rooms.
-   _Leverage_: "The Experimental Job" has Eliot allude to being haunted by the dead.
    
    **Eliot:** What do you want to know? Names? Dates? Locations? (softly) You want to know what food was on their breath? Their eyes ? what color their eyes were? You want to know the last words they spoke? You want to know which ones deserved it. Or, better yet, the ones that didn't? Do you want to know which ones begged? Do you know why I remember these things?  
    **Interrogator:** I don't know.  
    **Eliot:** You don't know? 'Cause I can't forget. So there's nothing you can do, no punishment you can hand out that's worse than what I live with every day. So, to answer your question, no. No, I haven't counted. I don't need to.
    
-   _Merlin (2008)_:
    -   In "The Tears of Uther Pendragon", Morgana and Morgause cast a spell on Uther to bring his worst fears to life. This manifests as hallucinations of his late wife (whose death he feels he is responsible for by unknowingly trading her life to gain an heir) and the children he drowned in a well for possessing magic, driving him mad until the spell could be reversed.
    -   In "A Herald of a New Age", Elyan is possessed by a boy killed in a druid camp raid that Arthur led years before, botched when his men disobeyed his order to spare the women and children. While possessing Elyan, he attempts to kill Arthur multiple times, with Gaius suggesting they might have to kill Elyan if the spirit won't let him go. Arthur goes to the site of the former camp and expresses his deep remorse for what happened, swearing to treat the druids better now that he is king. The spirit forgives him and finally moves on. Downplayed since Arthur did not directly kill or intend to kill the boy, but still feels guilty for his role in not preventing it.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_:
    -   In "Deaths-Head Revisited", an SS officer visits his old concentration camp, which has been turned into a museum, and he is led around by a former inmate, until the officer realized he had killed the man back when the camp was operating. The victims of the war criminal pass judgement of insanity upon him.
    -   In "The Thirty-Fathom Grave", a Navy ship discovers the wreck of a U.S. submarine from World War II. One of the sailors, who was the only survivor of the sub's sinking, is on the Navy vessel and has blamed himself for the disaster ever since. He begins to break down, swearing that he sees the ghosts of men who died on the sub, who are beckoning him to join him. He's ultimately so overwhelmed that he throws himself into the ocean and drowns.

    Theatre 

-   _Anastasia_: Downplayed and discussed. The fictional Gleb was a young soldier when the Romanovs were killed, and while he did not pull the trigger, he let the assassinations happen and justified them as necessary for the revolution, while his father, who actually did the deed, died of shame. When faced with Anya claiming to be the lost princess Anastasia, under orders to finish the job, Anya demands Gleb look into her face and see the faces of her dead family in hers, who appear in the background of the scene. Gleb, out of guilt and a desire not to repeat his father's mistake, lets Anya go.
-   _The Lion King_: "The Madness of King Scar" implies that Scar is haunted by his brother Mufasa, whom he secretly assassinated (though it's likely a hallucination of madness).
    
    **Scar:** Even in death, his shadow looms over me. _(suddenly cowering)_ There he is! No, there he is! And there!  
    **Zazu:** Calm yourself, sire! Or you'll get another one of your splitting headaches.  
    **Scar:** I AM PERFECTLY FINE!
    
-   William Shakespeare used this in some of his plays:
    -   In _Julius Caesar_, Brutus sees the ghost of Caesar, who he helped to kill, who ominously warns him of his fate in the upcoming battle.
    -   In _Macbeth_, as a sign that his sanity is slipping, Macbeth is haunted by the ghost of Banquo during a feast. In some versions, Banquo has the same grisly and bloodied appearance as he did when he was murdered...
    -   In _Richard III_, King Richard has a dream, the night before the Battle of Bosworth Field, in which the ghosts of the people he killed (in the play, that is — the real king wasn't actually guilty of all their deaths) tell him to "despair and die".

    Theme Parks 

-   In the original unused concept for Disneyland's _The Haunted Mansion_, the attraction would have featured a pirate named Captain Bartholomew Gore who murders his wife after she finds out about his bloody past. A show scene would have shown him in his bed being tormented by the ghosts of his past victims, including his wife, who he would try to shoot at with a pistol. The next show scene would have shown him Driven to Suicide by the hauntings, hanging himself in the mansions' rafters.

    Video Games 

-   _Five Nights at Freddy's_:
    -   William Afton/Purple Guy, the main villain of the series, is killed after the souls of the children he murdered come back to haunt him in _Five Nights at Freddy's 3_, getting him crushed inside a robotic suit.
    -   A common interpretation of _Ultimate Custom Night_ is that we play as Afton in Hell, forced to be haunted by his victims for all of eternity.
-   _Fatal Frame III_: Minor character Yoshino Takigawa suffers a particularly nasty subversion. While trapped in the Manor of Sleep, ghosts surround and berate Yoshino as she pleads for forgiveness. Thing is, Yoshino _genuinely_ did nothing wrong; she was the Sole Survivor of a tragic accident that claimed her family's lives, dealing with both trauma and a massive dose of Survivor's Guilt. Implicitly, the Manor is invoking this trope to prey on Yoshino, not to exact supernatural justice.
-   In _Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater_, the encounter with The Sorrow has Snake forced to face ghosts of all the men he's killed throughout the mission.
-   The intro to _Planescape: Torment_ has The Nameless One lying dead on a slab as he's wheeled into the Mortuary by a zombie. While he's lying there we witness a series of visions full of foreshadowing. In one of the visions, a group of ghostly figures cloaked in shadows ominously loom until they all point accusingly.
-   This is how the Jester from _Town of Salem_ operates. By tricking the town into lynching them, they can then kill one person who voted them guilty by haunting them at night.

    Web Animation 

-   _Arby 'n' the Chief_ both suffer this in the show's final seasons
    -   Throughout Season 7, Master Chief suffers this after accidentally murdering Cortana by cooking her in an oven (originally intended as a prank to frighten her). Afterwards, Cortana returns as a series of jumpscary machinations until she fully materializes as a hallucination that only he can interact with only to berate him for what he's done and what he's doing by hanging out with Eugene and his Troll Clan. It isn't until Eugene and his goons are dealt with that Cortana agrees to leave Chief alone.
    -   Throughout Season 8, the Arbiter suffers this after witnessing Eugene kill himself after he and his troll clan are banned, stopping their fragban rampage. Like Cortana, Eugene initially only haunts Arbiter as jumpscary machinations until he too fully materializes as a hallucination that only he can interact with (albeit only when he plays _Halo: Reach_.) Unlike Cortana though, his berating towards Arbiter is purely malicious, often making him question his own actions and past to make him contemplate if he's worthy of living or death. It isn't until the Series Finale when the actual spirit of Eugene gives Arbiter closure by informing him that who he was speaking to was just his guilt being manifested to torment him.
-   _Pokémon Rusty_: In "Ghost Tower", Rusty goes to the Pokémon Tower and is confronted by the angry ghosts of all the Pokémon he's accidentally killed, including a Zubat he drowned by trying to Surf on its back, a Tentacool whose tentacles he plugged into an electrical socket, a Grimer he washed down the drain, and a horde of Bidoofs he crammed into a single Poké Ball. Unlike most examples of this trope, he does not feel guilty for their deaths at all, because he's a complete idiot.
    
    **Rusty**: You came back from beyond just to tell me that I shouldn't feel bad and that I should keep training!  
    **Ghost Cubone**: No! Give up! Go home! You were born to work in a deli!

-   _The Cramp Twins_: In "Cricket Slayers", Lucien indirectly kills a rare species of cricket and he feels very guilty about it. Wayne only adds salt to the wound by disguising himself as a cricket and pretending to be its ghost to haunt Lucien at night. Since Lucien can't see well without his glasses, he is fooled at first, but he finds out it was Wayne all along when the latter says something factually incorrect about crickets. In the end, it turns out the cricket was just knocked out cold, but still alive.
-   _King of the Hill_: The episode _Returning Japanese_ has Cotton in a steam room where he hallucinates a group of undead Japanese soldiers that he killed during WWII about to attack him.
-   In _The Owl House_ episode "For the Future", Belos is haunted by the specter of his murdered brother Caleb and the many Grimwalkers he's created from Caleb's remains. To drive the point home even further, Caleb perpetually has a bloodied dagger floating above his head. Belos denies his guilt, blaming Caleb for his own death, but his attempts to silence the ghosts only hasten his unstable body to weaken further.
-   _The Simpsons_: In the Lady Macbeth segment of "Four Great Women and a Manicure", Marge pushes Homer to kill all the actors in the way of him getting the lead role in a production of _Macbeth_. As a result, the ghosts of Homer's victims haunt Marge until she dies of a fright-induced heart attack.
