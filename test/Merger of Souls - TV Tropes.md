**Ermac:** We hunger for new souls.  
**Kenshi:** Thousands of souls but none your own.  
**Ermac:** We _are_ the thousands!

When two or more souls literally _fuse_ into one singular soul, typically in a _permanent_ manner. It may result from a Fusion Dance. It's also possible for transcendence to involve several personalities merging together into a single collective.

An Assimilation Plot can be this on a large scale. Sister Trope to Split-Personality Merge, which is when this is done with a character who has dissociative identity disorder. Compare Mental Fusion, which is a temporary fusion of _minds_ (though the mind-soul distinction is up to debate in some circles).

Also Compare Mind Hive and Many Spirits Inside of One, both of which involve multiple separate spirits in the same body.

Also also compare Your Soul Is Mine! and Soul Power. It's different from Soul Eating because the soul is not consumed, but rather absorbed, still retaining some of its own uniqueness in the bigger whole.

Not to be confused with Soul Music.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Bleach_:
    -   Hollows become more powerful by eating each other (and human souls). At lower stages of strength, this normally leads to them becoming beastial creatures known as Gillians, composed of many thousands of souls and forming the first stage of a Hollow's existence as a Menos. Occasionally one of these hollows contain a soul strong willed enough to remain sapient and somewhat intelligent, which takes control and continues to feed on other hollows to become more powerful. If such a Gillian consumes enough souls, it turns into a more powerful and now-truly intelligent Adjuchas. Adjuchas then begin devouring other Adjuchas, and if they're powerful enough, they will turn into a Vasto Lorde, the final and most powerful form a Hollow can achieve. It's unclear what happens to all of the souls when a Hollow is killed by a Soul Reaper. The dominant soul is "purified" and sent to Soul Society (or sent to Hell if they were evil enough before becoming a Hollow), and reenters the cycle of reincarnation. But it's never specified whether the same thing happens to all of the other souls a Hollow has eaten, or whether they've all been permanently merged and will reincarnate as a single composite soul from then onward.
    -   Ichigo's inner hollow formed when the soul and _reiryoku_ of the proto-arrancar "White" transferred from Masaki to Ichigo and merged with his Soul Reaper powers and Zanpakuto spirit.
    -   In general, this is how the Applied Phlebotinum in _Bleach_ works regardless. Zanpakutou swords themselves are stated to be built from a conglomeration of souls, everything in the world itself (both the spiritual and physical) is said to be comprised of souls, and the Hyougyoku absorbs pieces of the souls of others in order to power up.
-   Demons fuse all the time in _Devilman_, preferring to do it to gain more power or when one or both is on death's door. In fact, it is how the titular hero is born, with extremely powerful demon Amon fusing with lowly human Akira. How much of each other's personality remains and the exact reasoning for the fusion depends on the adaptation.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   In _Dragon Ball Z_, by putting his hand on Nail and later Kami, Piccolo absorbs them, gaining not only extra power but also their memories. This process is permanent; Piccolo's personality also seems to undergo slight changes after each absorption.
    -   A similar case is when Goku and Vegeta use the Potara earrings to fuse; however, in this case, they split when they enter Buu's body. The personality of the fused being seems to be a mix of both Goku and Vegeta's personalities. It's later revealed in _Dragon Ball Super_ that the potara fusion is only permanent if one of the fusees is a kai, unless the dragon balls are used to undo the fusion, as what was done to defuse Kibito and Shin.

-   _Ghost in the Shell_:
    -   This occurs at the end of the first manga (and in the film adaptation). Motoko Kusanagi and the Puppet Master merge souls (or rather, "Ghosts") to become a new being the with personalities of the two, only now moved to the body of a teenage girl android.
    -   In _Man-Machine Interface_, Motoko has spun off several "daughter" entities that have merged with even more people, including the protagonist Motoko Aramaki ("Motoko 11") and most of the female cast of the comic. In the end they meet and merge with an extradimensional entity.
-   _Inuyasha_:
    -   Demons do this all the time, fusing together to make more powerful demons. The Shikon Jewel was created when a particularly large number of demons fused to fight a priestess. After a long battle both souls fused and crystallized into the series' MacGuffin.
    -   Naraku was created when the deranged and perverse thief (and Kikyou's Stalker with a Crush) Onigumo merged with thousands of demons. And at one point in order to obtain a stronger body, he perfoms a Kodoku spell: thousands of fierce demons fight inside a cave in a mountain, and the winner absorb and merge with the losers. Eventually Naraku ends up absorbing the surviving demon in himself.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_: The Third Impact as envisioned by Seele would've resulted in all human beings on the planet having their souls merged into one singular whole, with all individuality dissolved. Although the process is initiated in the middle of the _End of Evangelion_ movie, it fortunately gets aborted before it reaches the point of irreversibility.
-   In _Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas_, the Oneroi, four dream gods, have a One-Winged Angel form that fuses four of their souls into a single body. While each souls is still separate, they work in tandem to keep the body from being destroyed by harm and grant it Nigh-Invulnerability. The catch? Attacking all four souls _simultaneously_ with precision strikes can kill them.
-   In _Shinzo_, all Enterrans, the new inhabitants of Earth, are reduced to an Encard when defeated. The victor can then decide to keep the card, destroy it (effectively destroying that Enterran's soul) or eat or absorb it. The soul and power of the eaten Enterran are then merged with the eater's, who usually remains in control but does take over some of the physical characteristics of the other Enterran.

    Comic Books 

-   _Druuna_: After the demise of Shastar and Captain Lewis, their spirits continue to live on as a Virtual Ghost, with their minds folded into each other in transient stages of consciousness.
-   Redlance and Nightfall in _ElfQuest_ have their souls merged as an accidental side-effect of Nightfall's love bringing Redlance out of a Heroic BSoD. They get to keep their individual personalities, though.
-   An arc of _Hitman (1993)_ comic features the Mauser, a demonic minion created by merging the souls of several Nazi S.S. officers.
-   _Marvel Universe_:
    -   While nothing was done with it, this is ultimately what Tony Stark currently is: when Franklin Richards saved The Avengers and the Fantastic Four after their Heroic Sacrifice at the end on _Onslaught_, he recreated the heroes closer to what he remembered, hence is Tony's case, resurrecting the Tony Stark who died during _The Crossing_ and fusing him with his teenaged alternate universe counterpart, even having memories of not just his own life and death, and his life in the _Heroes Reborn_ world, but of Teen Tony's as well.
    -   In "What If The Avengers Had Lost the Evolutionary War?" from the second volume of _What If?_, many of the superhumans cut their ties to humanity and leave Earth find their own destiny. Eventually, they merge with the Anthropomorphic Personifications of Death and Eternity, and the resulting entity leaves to create a big bang for a new universe, after which it splits into just Death and Eternity. Meanwhile, humanity evolves to the point that the humans merge their minds and become one with the planet itself, transforming themselves into a Genius Loci.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   _Wonder Woman (1942)_: Steve Trevor of Earth-One was brought back from the dead by housing him in the body of the Steve from Earth-270, whose memories were already a mess due to Eros' actions. The Earth-One Steve didn't fully overwrite the other, as he gained memories he wouldn't have otherwise had from him, so it acts more like a merger with the first Steve being more dominant.
    -   _The Legend of Wonder Woman (2016)_: The Titan is essentially a mecha that houses the souls of a long dead world that have lost their individuality and become one malevolent entity.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Codex Equus_, one theory about Emperor Golden Scepter's origins proposed in-universe by tabletop game writers is that he's the divine collective reincarnation of various Pony mages, wizards, and sorcerers, which explains why he embodies Ponykind. Golden Scepter reportedly laughed at the theory's utter ridiculousness and praised the game writers' creativity.
-   Some _Harry Potter_ fanfictions resolve Harry's Horcrux problem by having him absorb the bit of Voldemort's soul instead of trying to destroy him.
-   This is the conclusion of P. H. Wise's fanfic _A New World In My View_ (page pending) with Xander and Divine's souls merging.
-   In _The Parselmouth of Gryffindor_, the Sorting Hat ends up absorbing the part of Lord Voldemort's soul inside the Cup of Hufflepuff.
-   Happens a lot in _Pony POV Series_, normally with Shadows of Existence merging with souls. The original Rarity dies by merging with the Spirits of Dark Magic to complete them and ensure no Nightmare will ever exist again.
-   Happens to America and Vale at the beginning of the sequel to _Weight of the World_.

    Film — Animated 

-   In _Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn_, Janemba is created when a soul-cleansing machine in the afterlife explodes, causing all the evil souls to merge into the Oni guarding it.
-   Gaia and the alien Gaia in _Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within_ are two giant aggregates of ghosts. In the end, they merge.
-   In _Turning Red_, the red panda spirit that each of the females in Mei's family gain when they come of age appear to bond with their own and can only be separated during a specific ritual.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _Being John Malkovich_ has a secret society of old people hoping for a second chance at life by reincarnating into the body of one child.
-   _The Dark Crystal_ has the wise Mystics and the wicked Skeksis, who were created when the Dark Crystal shattered. They were two halves of the souls of the creatures which shattered the crystal, and a death of a Mystic also kills their Skeksis counterpart, and vice versa. In the climax of the film, the crystal is mended by the hero Jen, and the two races are made one once more.
-   Dan Aykroyd said that Slimer from _Ghostbusters (1984)_ was a "vapor — a kind of confluence of stored up psychic energy, an accumulation of spirits that haunt the hotel who doesn't want to leave".

    Literature 

-   _Aeon 14_: AI are forbidden to fuse with organic minds under the Phobos Accords<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  to prevent one from being dominated by the other, and AI/human partnerships are legally limited in duration to keep it from happening naturally. However:
    -   In _Outsystem_, Tanis (human main character) and Angela (her AI partner implanted in her Brain/Computer Interface) perform a dangerous computing maneuver while leaving the Sol system, linking their minds more deeply than usual in order to share processing power and gain their fighters an edge over mercenaries attacking the _Intrepid_. Afterwards it's revealed that their bond is now such that Angela can no longer be removed without killing them both, though for the moment they're still separate personalities in a Mind Hive. They do start seeing more of each other's thinking, though, and in _Orion Rising_ they acknowledge to Sera that they'll eventually become a single being, though it's likely centuries off.
    -   In _Orion Rising_, Amanda (a human "avatar", a computer expert whose job is to interface between human crew members and _Intrepid_'s shipboard AI, Bob) and the shipboard AI Ylonda are seriously injured fighting a rogue AI. They subdue their attacker but the remnants of their minds seek each other out and merge into a new personality in Amanda's body, Amavia (a portmanteau of the Latin forms of their names).
-   In _The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump_, exposure to arcane contamination can cause infants to be born without a soul; this is treated as a medical condition, called "apsychia". The protagonist meets Razman Durani, a Jinnetic Engineering researcher who is working on an experimental procedure in which tiny pieces of many souls are fused into, essentially, a synthetic soul which can then be implanted in the apsychic child. Whether this will actually work is still unclear.
-   In _The Dark_, occultists rouse an incorporeal sentience, manifest in darkness, which drives people homicidally insane. The titular Dark seems infused with discarnate deranged souls.
-   In _The Ghosts of Sleath_, the souls of Human Sacrifice victims form an amorphous haze.
-   In _The Gods Themselves_, this is how the Soft Ones in the parallel universe have sex. It's also how the Hard Ones are formed, when the last mating becomes permanent.
-   Slime spirits in _I've Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level_ are mergers of the millions of the souls of slimes Azusa killed over the centuries. They have different feelings; Shalsha wants vengeance for all the deaths while Falfa is grateful for the chance to be reborn as a sentient being. They both consider Azusa to be their mother.
-   Happens towards the end of "The Last Question" when the remaining humans (by now bodiless entities) merge one by one with humanity's hypercomputer, the Cosmic AC.
-   This happens in the _Kamigawa Cycle_ between Michiko and The Taken One so that they can become Barrier Maidens.
-   In _The Legend of Drizzt_, Crenshinibon, an Artifact of Doom taking the form of a crystal shard (from whence the first book of _The Icewind Dale Trilogy_ gets its name), was formed from a ritual that merged the souls of seven liches. Upon its destruction in _Servant of the Shard_, the souls are apparently separated and pass on.
-   _The Locked Tomb_:
    -   Becoming a Lyctor requires a necromancer to extract, consume, and successfully integrate the soul of their cavalier, thereby retaining the necromancer's magical abilities, and gaining the physical fighting ability of the cavalier. It kills the cavalier in the process, but if Ianthe's struggle with Naberius's soul is anything to go by, something of the cavalier still lives on inside the necromancer.
    -   In _Nona the Ninth_, Palamedes and Camilla create their own version Pal calls a "Grand Lysis", combining into one person who takes the name "Paul". This is an equal fusion of two souls rather than the destructive lyctoral process, which is implied to be a (deliberately) flawed imitation of this true fusion.
    -   Teacher is fifty souls merged into one being, and while he's kind of odd he seems friendly enough though his motivations are unclear to everyone, and he possesses significant and grotesque power if provoked. He's described as a prototype, though what exactly he's a prototype for is yet unrevealed.
-   In George Zebrowski's _Macrolife_, the Agregate of Minds is a distributed artificial intelligence (spread among a fleet of a million or so artificial worlds) whose countless processors and memory storage systems apparently include a library of simulated personalities. It is apparently capable of reversing the process, allowing a component intelligence to function independently in order to hold conversations and then reabsorbing it when done.
-   In the _Past Doctor Adventures_ novel _Matrix_, the Time Lord Matrix, a database comprised of deceased Time Lords' brain patterns, is revealed to have been purged of destructive, potentially rebellious thoughts, which, hidden beneath the Citadel, are highjacked by the Valeyard. They manifest as a coalescence of shadow and thrive on destruction.
-   _Thief of Time_ introduces Lobsang Ludd and his not-quite-twin brother Jeremy Clockson. The awful truth, when it comes out, is that they are not twins at all but the same soul born twice due to a temporal anomaly (their mother is the anthropomorphic personification of Time, and her labour got a bit strange, despite the best midwife in the Discworld being present). The two half-souls are allowed to fuse together towards the end of the book, with Lobsang dominating, so as to take over the job of running Time from their mother.
-   A couple of examples from _The Wheel of Time_:
    -   Slayer, the Shadow's top assassin, was created from merging the souls (and bodies) of two separate men, Luc and Isam; though he still demonstrates separate personalities, the two souls and closely attached to each other in some unspecified manner, and he is known as "the Man with Two Souls" among the Shadow's elite.
    -   Early in the series, Mordeth tries to pull a Grand Theft Me on Padan Fain. Because of the Dark One's touch on Fain, this failes, and what results is a third personality that combines the worst elements of both men.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Hive, the Season 3 Big Bad of _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._, is a parasitic Inhuman, who Body Surfs into freshly dead corpses whenever he's in need of a new host body. In doing so, he gains access to the new host's memories and personalities, allowing him to impersonate them well enough to convincingly fool anyone. And as it turns out, he keeps the memories of every prior host even after moving onto a new one, enabling him to shift between personalities at a whim.
-   Echo and Alpha from _Dollhouse_ both have 40+ personalities inhabiting a single body. It is clearly shown in Echo's case that her "main" personality is an amalgamation of all the personalities she has been imprinted with, though she can seamlessly slip into one specific personality when needed. With Alpha, it's not as clearly defined and there are even a couple scenes where two or more of his personalities are openly arguing with each other. He does seem to have one "main" personality that is in overall control, though it is never clearly shown if this "main" personality is an amalgamation of all his personalities like Echo's is.
-   Joined Trills in _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ fuse the consciousness of the near-human host with the consciousness of the slug-like symbiont to produce a new individual with personality traits of both. The symbiont is removable, but after 93 hours joined doing so will kill the host, and removed symbionts retain memories of past hosts.
-   Castiel, an angel from _Supernatural_, became something far more powerful by absorbing the souls of Purgatory. Unfortunately, one set of them was too powerful for him and took over.

    Music 

-   In the _Evillious Chronicles_, Ma, the Big Bad of the Chronicles' latter half, is a fusion of three separate souls, Irina Clockworker, Elluka Clockworker/Levia Barisol and Eve Moonlit. A major plot point of her arc is her desire to gain her own identity.
-   The Faithless song "We Come 1" deals with the merging of the speaker and the one addressed.

    Religion 

-   The concept of Animism is loosely connected to this. Under an animistic belief, every individual object has a "soul". However, this becomes ambiguous when you consider that every "object" is made of smaller objects, and is itself part of a larger object. (For example, each speck of dirt makes a rock, which together make up mountains.) Thus, most animistic faiths have larger Deities which personify any concept are likely to be this, especially considering that no two worshippers interpret _anything_ exactly the same way.
-   This is the most common difference that Buddhism has from other "Dharmic" belief systems (such as Hinduism, Jainism and Sikhism). While the latter three all believe in an eternal, unchangeable, immutable soul that is stuck in the hellish cycle of rebirth, Buddhism instead argues that there is no such thing as a "self" and that once one lets go of the illusion that there _is_ one, you are fully free to become one with this world and the one beyond. As such, the state of Nirvana is one in which there is one massive harmony of souls existing as one.
-   In high Hindu philosophy, the goal of the soul, over however many incarnations it takes, is to unite with the Brahman, the absolute reality.
-   The Greek philosopher Plotinus (c. 204-270 AD) postulated "Emanation _ex deo_ (Out of God)". Basically, in the hierarchy of being, there is The One (who is all good, transcendent, and unchanging). The nature of the One is simply that it filters down itself, but the One never loses anything or changes. Next comes the Nous, or Divine Mind, and then bellow that is the Oversoul. From the Oversoul comes individual Human Souls. So what does this have to do with this trope? It's possible for a human soul to reunite with the One again, forever (at least in Neoplatonic tradition).

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Geist: The Sin-Eaters_, Sin-Eaters are created when a newly dead human makes a pact with the titular Geist. In exchange for a new lease on life, the Geist will tag along, leading to an intimate merging of the 2 entities. Although separate and distinct, they are bound as long the Sin Eater lives, and removal of the Geist results in The Vacant. This is also why Sin Eaters are also known as The Bound.
-   _Pathfinder_:
    -   Solar angels, unlike less powerful celestials, are usually created from an amalgam of Good souls and pure divine energy. They function as individuals, and it's unclear whether or how their previous mortal identities carry over.
    -   In general, the souls of mortals, called _petitioners_ once in their afterlife, lose their individuality and merge with the plane itself after an unspecified, but presumably lengthy, period of time. This is the raw material that both the outer planes and many outsiders are made from.
    -   Pharaonic Guardians are created by a powerful Necromantic rite that extracts the souls of several mortal victims and fuses them into a single spiritual entity with an overriding sense of purpose.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   The God-Emperor of Mankind was said to be the reincarnation of thousands of prehistoric shamans' souls, merged into a singular being.
    -   Slaanesh, an Eldritch Abomination and one of the setting's four Gods of Evil, was born when countless Eldar souls that died in extremely decadent orgies and sadistic slaughters coalesced together into a single entity, creating the Negative Space Wedgie known as the "Eye of Terror" in the process. The other three Chaos Gods formed in a similar manner, but more slowly and less dramatically.
    -   The Craftworld and Exodite Eldar have been trapping the souls of their dead in stones to keep Slaanesh from eating them and to eventually form a new god they call Ynnead, the God of the Dead. As of 8th Edition, they've partially succeeded.

    Video Games 

-   _Dark Souls III_:
    -   The first of the Lords of Cinder, the powerful souls who once linked the fire, that the Ashen One faces on their journey is actually an entire army called the Abyss Watchers, who all partook in an oath and drank wolf blood, a process that fused their souls together. As such, they can only use the full extent of their powers while the soul inhabits a single individual and the player receives a single soul upon defeating them, entitled _Soul of the Blood of the Wolf_.
    -   The Final Boss is implied to be one of these. Specifically, it is implied to be the combined might and Souls of every being that ever Linked the First Flame, as its Japanese name translated is "Incarnation of Kings". It also borrows quite a few design cues from The Chosen Undead from _Dark Souls_, and its second phase move set and theme is a direct Call-Back to Gwyn, the first Lord of Cinder.
-   _Darkstalkers_:
    -   Morrigan Aensland fused with Lilith, who was originally a part of her soul Split at Birth and henceforth exists as a Split Personality capable of manifesting in an independent body, as can be seen in _Marvel vs. Capcom_.
    -   Also, this is the basis of Jedah's Assimilation Plot in the third game. He plans on absorbing all of Makai's souls into his body, creating a perfect being (the Shintai) and then resetting all of reality so that he can save his world.
-   In The Very Definitely Final Dungeon of _Digital Devil Saga 2_, Serph and Sera fuse into the androgynous Seraph, gaining a new Atma form and pooling their learned skills in the process.
-   In _Dragon Quest VI_, The Hero and Carver become merged with their Real World counterparts, granting them new powers. The Hero's counterpart takes a bit of work, though.
-   Towards the end of _Dust: An Elysian Tail_, it's revealed that Dust himself has the souls of Ginger's brother and the Big Bad's henchman/best friend, who slew each other. It's explicitly stated that the resulting being has its own mind and body, with either soul just providing moral guidance and power respectively.
-   In _The Elder Scrolls_ series' lore, this is one of the more prominent theories regarding the apotheosis of Tiber Septim, the founder of the Third Cyrodiilic Empire who posthumously became the Aedric Divine Talos. It states that Tiber Septim's Imperial Battlemage, Zurin Arctus, who was tasked with finding a replacement power source for the Numidium, attempted to soul-trap Wulfharth Ash-King (a notable Shezarrine, physical manifestations of the soul of Shezarr/Lorkhan, the "dead" creator god of Mundus, the mortal plane) using the Mantella. Arctus succeeded, but Wulfharth killed Arctus with his dying breath. The two beings are theorized to have been merged into the undying entity known as the Underking. Following the Warp in the West, the Underking recovered the Mantella and freed his soul, allowing him to finally die. Septim, who had possibly "mantled" Shezarr, thus ascended with them into godhood as a merged entity. Another theory states that Septim, Arctus, and Wulfharth were all part of the same "oversoul" from the start. Needless to say, things get very Mind Screwy within the _ES_ universe when divinity and mantling are involved, and even this theory is hotly debated (in-universe and out).
-   _EverQuest II_ introduces the Duality. The combined essences of the great wizard Al'Kabor and a powerful necromancer named Dartain sharing one body. His physical body morphs between the two personalities at frequent intervals.
-   Exdeath, the Big Bad of _Final Fantasy V_, came about after a multitude of evil beings were sealed within a tree in the Forest of Moore.
-   In _Kirby and the Forgotten Land_, the final boss of Ultimate Cup Z, Chaos Elfilis, is a combination of Soul Forgo, the souls of Beast Pack mooks absorbed by Fecto Forgo, and souls stolen from Morpho Knight.
-   In _The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker_, Jalhalla, the end boss of the Earth Temple, is essentially a collective of poes who merge into one massive poe. They (he) can only be harmed when they separate.
-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   There's conflicting evidence for this and Mind Hive in the case of the Reapers. They're created from the amalgamation of millions of sapient minds but it's unclear whether the souls are fused or exist separately: Legion states the latter, but Reapers act like single entities and refer to themselves with singular pronouns (contrast Legion, who always uses "we").
    -   By the end of _Mass Effect 3_, Legion's varying programs have knitted together to form a personality core. Unfortunately, he has to die to save his people soon after.
-   _Mortal Kombat_:
    -   Shang Tsung's power is said to be derived from his having absorbed the souls of his vanquished opponents. He is dangerous because he is not one opponent, he is thousands.
    -   Ermac is made up of the thousands of souls whose shells died resisting Shao Kahn's rule fused together to make a body. Ermac serves as an enforcer for Shao Kahn, killing dissenters and adding their souls to his collection. His body is starting to degrade in _Mortal Kombat X_ due to Shao Kahn's death.
-   In _Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer_, the Thayan Academy of Shapers and Binders has a wizard who can fuse souls and bound his own soul into a clay golem to do it more safely. A sidequest on the same level requires you to trade a particular soul to two pit fiends. Unfortunately, they can't agree on what the soul should have; in fact, each gives mutually exclusive requirements. The solution ends up being to have the aforementioned wizard fuse two completely opposite souls together.
-   _Pokémon Diamond and Pearl_: The Pokémon Spiritomb is a collection of 108 souls that have amalgamated together out of negative emotions.
-   _StarCraft_: The various "archons" created by the protoss.
    -   The first game's high templars can perform a one-way fusion into an archon, a ghostly psionic entity that is very damaging and quite hard to kill<sup>*&nbsp;</sup> . The _Brood War_ expansion allows two dark templar to fuse into a dark archon, a caster unit.
    -   The Expanded Universe and _Enslavers II_ add-on campaign have Ulrezaj, a rebel Dark Templar who eventually fuses with _five_ others to form an Ax-Crazy super-archon of sorts. He's eventually defeated in _The Dark Templar Saga_ by having the last of the templar Preservers sacrifice herself to seal him with her into a khaydarin crystal.
    -   _StarCraft II_ dispenses with the dark archon, allowing archons (initially called twilight archons, but this was dropped in early patches) to be created from any combination of two high templar or dark templar.
-   At the very, very end of _Tales of Symphonia_, it's explained that this is what happened to the souls of the various Chosen Ones who sacrificed their lives in the Journey of Regeneration — they merged together along with Martel, the woman they were trying to revive, with the latter emerging as the dominant personality of the new mana tree's guardian spirit.
-   At the end of the undead campaign in _Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne_ Arthas merges his soul with the Lich King.

    Webcomics 

-   _Dominic Deegan_:
    -   Acibek was a golem created by an ancient Elven tyrant who powered him with several souls combined together, many of them collected unwillingly, and not happy about it. The Sylvan Oracle and her own creation "Dirk the Mighty" were similar golems.
    -   There's also the Storm of Souls, a raging maelstrom of souls formed from deceased members of the chaos-worshipping cult The Chosen and intended to be their weapon to destroy the world with. Acibek sacrificed himself to trap it in a cage forged from his own souls, and centuries later, the Sylvan Oracle sacrificed herself to destroy it.
-   In the backstory chapter of _The Dragon Doctors_, a massive time-destroying paradox (the ghost of a woman who used time-travel to kill her past self) is merged with the soul of a cyber-shaman, giving her a new physical existence and ending the unravelling of reality. Later, the shaman explains she had to undergo an "emergency meditation" to resolve her identity and that she's not entirely the Shelinda the other characters know.
-   _Homestuck_:
    -   Kernelsprites are game constructs resembling floating orbs that can be "prototyped" up to two times, merging the things placed in them into a composite entity. If two deceased or living beings are prototyped, the result is a sprite with a merged name and personality. Overall, the fusion of a person and an animal will result in the person's mind being dominant with only some animal traits, while two people will form a more even blend.
        -   Jade's kernelsprite is originally prototyped with her god-dog Becquerel, forming Becsprite. Later, this is prototyped against with the body of her dead dream-body to create Jadesprite, which retains Jade's appearance and personality with Becquerel's ears, powers, and occasional bark. In \[S\] Cascade, when Jade ascends to the God Tiers, a process that involves a player dying and then reawakening in their dream body with godlike powers, she fuses with Jadesprite to result in waking Jade with Bec's held-over traits and some of Jadesprite's memories.
        -   Vriska's and Tavros' dead bodies are thrown into Jane's sprite, yanking their souls out of the afterlife and fusing them together as "Tavrisprite". Their personalities are so irreconcilable that the sprite explodes (sending the two souls back to the afterlife) mere moments later.
        -   Eridan and Sollux were successfully fused into an Erisolsprite (which spends most of his time flipping people off at random), and Equiusprite is fused with Dirk's sapient AI auto-responder to create Arquiusprite. Feferi and Nepeta are also fused into a Fefetasprite, which had a peaceful life for six months but doesn't last long once Erisolsprite and Arquiusprite start arguing over her — the mental dissonance of having two composite people arguing over different parts of herself causes her to also explode and return Feferi and Nepeta's to the afterlife.
        -   Squared kernelsprites (made from the merging of two seperate kernelsprites) not only merge the two souls that comprise their being, but give them the memories of both their hosts across all timelines. Davepetasprite^2 (Davesprite and Nepetasprite) and Jasprosesprite^2 (Jaspersprite and pre-retcon Rosesprite) are the only two sprites of their kind.
    -   During a battle with Caliborn, Dirk ripped out his soul and shoved it into Lil' Cal. Unfortunately, Arquiusprite (Autoresponder + Equius) and half of Gamzee were dragged in as well. Lord English is a combination of Caliborn, the Autoresponder, Equius, and at least half of Gamzee's souls, though Caliborn seems to be the dominant party.
    -   Sburb lore has an unconsious version of this called the "Ultimate Self", where the experiences and memories of doomed and retconned timelines shape the meta-narrative of a person. While regular kernelsprites and players aren't aware of it, some higher beings like squared sprites can access their ultimate self's knowledge.
-   This happens in _Spinnerette_, unfortunately the souls are evil souls from Hell merging together into a Kaiju\-sized demon.
-   _Stand Still, Stay Silent_: The leader of the mixed troll and ghost herd going after the crew later in the story is this. It is initially made of the fusion of several human ghosts, but quickly assimilates the spirits of Plague Zombie animals as well. Some of its compenents are heard complaining about their Fate Worse than Death by the crew's mages, but there is an obvious "main mind" calling the shots for both the resulting "body" and the rest of the herd. That one is set on either killing or assimilating the members of the crew.

-   In _The Homestuck Epilogues_, Dirk is somehow able to ascend to his ultimate self, giving him access to the memories of both his alternate timeline selves and his pre-scratch counterpart Bro. Since this includes any splinter selves that have gotten merged with other people, this unfortunately also means he has access to _Lord English_.
-   _Orion's Arm_:
    -   "The Amalgamation" is an artificially intelligent _disease_, spread by Nanomachines. Occasionally, crews of ships sent to aid efforts to halt the Amalgamation become infected and turn against their allies.
    -   It isn't uncommon for a number of people to merge themselves into a single mind as part of Transcending into a higher intelligence. The difference between this and the Amalgamation is that this is done voluntarily, whereas the Amalgamation just assimilates everything with no choice given.
-   In _RWBY_, Ozpin's reincarnation works like this, attaching his soul to that of a like-minded individual and starting a process of them slowly merging into the same person. Neither he nor his new incarnation Oscar Pine are happy about this, as both see it as a Death of Personality they can't control, and Oscar spends most of his screentime resenting, dreading, or outright resisting it.

-   Tigerhawk in _Beast Wars_ was originally a Vok Emissary made from Tigatron and Airazor's bodies. However, their Sparks followed their bodies, and after Tigerhawk was defeated, Airazor and Tigatron's sparks merged and took control of the shell.
-   _Danny Phantom_: "Dark Danny" is the result of a Fusion Dance between the ghost selves of Danny and Vlad in an alternate timeline, though Danny is the dominant personality due to being the one to overshadow Vlad (though he definitely took after Vlad's evilness), which is why he's treated as an older Danny even if he's actually closer to an Enemy Without.
-   One episode of _The Real Ghostbusters_ featurs an advanced anti-ghost robot designed to destroy (actually disperse) ghosts instead of capturing them. As soon as the dispersed essence concentration goes above a certain threshold, well<small>◊</small>...
-   Tengu Shredder from _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)_ is the result of the Shredder Tengu fusing his soul with Oroku Saki.
