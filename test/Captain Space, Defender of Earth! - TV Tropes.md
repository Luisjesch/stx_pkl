**Dr Chaotica:** Captain Proton!

**Tom Paris:** Spaceman First Class, protector of Earth, scourge of intergalactic evil... at your service.

In The Future, when mankind has explored the outer reaches of space, the forces of evil threaten our peace. But never fear, for humanity is under the stalwart protection of the hero (or parody hero) of Space Operas and serials, known as _**Captain Space, Defender Of Earth!**_

There have been accusations of this being a Dead Unicorn Trope, since parodies of it are now better known than and arguably outnumber the original straight examples, but yes, by all the stars in space, the trope was once played straight by characters like Dan Dare, Captain Future, and Rocky Jones, Space Ranger!

The parodies tend to be based more on (the popular perception of) Captain Kirk and on Adam West's portrayal of Batman than on the old Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers stories, but that does not stand in the way of their quest For Great Justice! Okay, it might, but even if he is an arrogant Jerkass (meant to mock the old values, or what we think they were), that won't stop people from admiring him (or Green Skinned Space Babes from falling into his arms) due to his deep, manly voice, larger than life mannerisms, dedication to truth and justice, and some of his trusty gadgets (Ray Gun mandatory).

When our hero actually is heroic, although sometimes an idiot, he leads the fight to stop Death Rays, alien armadas, Space Pirates, and Evil Overlords from destroying The Federation! Furthermore, he does not need to do this alone, as he is always accompanied by a Girl Friday, a Ragtag Bunch of Misfits, or a Space Cadet, who may also be parodies of their respective archetypes or the true saviors of the day!

In animation our hero is often drawn with an exaggerated chin and a top-heavy body, to show off his space manliness!

Compare the Space Cadet (who aspires to be Captain Space when he grows up), Space Police, The Cape, The Ace, Raygun Gothic, Captain Superhero (with which this can overlap if a character is a Superhero In Space), For Great Justice, Space "X".

**Note that this is not merely parodies of space operas. This is about any character(s) acting this way.**

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga  

-   The eponymous _Space☆Dandy_, though you'd be mistaken if you ever thought he was in it For Great Justice.
-   _Captain Future_ is based on one of the literary Trope Codifiers.

    Comic Books 

-   _Nexus_ has more than a few elements of this, since he was based partly on Space Ghost.
-   _V for Vendetta_ has a Show Within a Show called _Storm Saxon_ as an idealized Aryan hero. He seems to mainly be a Mighty Whitey who fights black cannibals.
-   _2000 AD_:
    -   In 1981 _Dash Decent_ who was mostly a _Flash Gordon_ parody, but whose name also suggested _Dan Dare_.
    -   Around this same time, a "Tharg's Future Shocks" strip penned by Alan Moore centered around Rocket Redglare—"Golden-Haired Guardian of the Galaxy, Steel-Eyed Sentinel of the Spaceways, and Enemy of Evil Extra-Terrestrials." He's been living out his life as a washed up retiree, ever since he defeated his Meng the Merciless -styled arch enemy.
-   _Nova_ becomes a reconstruction of this in _Annihilation_.
-   Lance Blastoff, from Frank Miller's _Tales to Offend_, is a parody of the sexist and racist elements this character sometimes embodies.
-   _Guardians of the Galaxy_:
    -   Rocket Raccoon started as a very weird version of this trope plus Funny Animal. He later learned that the people he was protecting were actually abandoned mental patients; he'd been created to serve as the least-threatening asylum orderly possible. This leads to his modern characterization as a cynical, kleptomaniac bounty hunter.
    -   _Guardians of the Galaxy (2008)_ started on the very premise of deconstructing this trope, taking some of Marvel's forgotten characters who had played it straight and remaking them as severely flawed characters.
-   DC Comics has their own stable of space heroes: Star Hawkins, Space Ranger, Tommy Tomorrow, and so on. _Twilight_ was intended to give an update to all of them, as was the New 52 story _Threshold_. Also from DC Comics is Adam Strange, who is inspired by John Carter of Mars (a forerunner of Flash Gordon).
-   _Starlight_ was a reconstruction of _Flash Gordon_ where the Flash expy has come back to Earth and grown old with nobody believing his stories of space adventures apart from his now dead wife. He comes out of retirement when an alien teenager comes to Earth and asks him to save their planet again.
-   _Private Eye_ had _Dan Dire<small>◊</small>_, who was based on politician, Neil Kinnock and fought the Maggon (a Mekon parody, based on Margaret Thatcher).
-   _Astro City_'s own Astro-Naut (in honor of whom the city was named) is a Decon-Recon Switch of the archetype - having developed space travel technology during the war with the help of (friendly) aliens, his refusal to share it with the goverment during the fifties led him to be labeled a traitor to the country. He kept traveling across the cosmos to keep an eye on alien menaces (and find his lost Green-Skinned Space Babe love) despite his decreasing popularity and detatchment from human life. His fall from grace was reversed, however, once he gave his life protecting the city from Space Invaders. In keeping with the Deliberate Values Dissonance of his mid-fifties time period, his spaceship had an airbrushed image of his girlfriend, and he kept smoking his cigarettes even when wearing a Fishbowl Helmet.
-   _Valérian_ plays it straight and likely inspired many other examples. While the titular character is heroic, he is part of the Space Police instead of a lone hero.
-   In the "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue of _Fables_, it is revealed that one of Bigby and Snow's sons Connor Wolf would go on to become a renowned adventurer and hero to countless fable worlds, one of which in a Science Fiction setting that evokes the idea of the trope.

    Comic Strips 

-   The original _Dan Dare_ is one of the most bona fide, straight examples you'll ever find, and we love him for it. Later iterations end up being deconstructions, though.
-   _Calvin and Hobbes_: Calvin's Spaceman Spiff persona, who doesn't defend Earth so much as get randomly captured and shot down on faraway planets.
-   Comic strip character _Brewster Rockit: Space Guy!_ is the parody version of this trope.
-   While neither strip started out this way, both _Buck Rogers_ and _Flash Gordon_ evolved into this trope over time. Buck started out with purely earth-bound adventures, but ended up venturing into space more and more often over the years, to the point that his early non-space stories feel like Early-Installment Weirdness. Flash started out in a Planetary Romance constrained to the planet Mongo, but eventually left to have these sorts of planet-hopping adventures instead; however, since most fans regarded Mongo as the heart and soul of the story, Flash and his friends eventually returned there and the strip again became a Mongonian Planetary Romance until it ended in 2003.

    Films — Animation 

-   Uncle Art in _Meet the Robinsons_ (voice, appropriately enough, by Adam West) is a subversion—his spaceship is a conveyance for delivering pizza.
-   Zig-zagged by Buzz Lightyear of _Toy Story_, which plays up the parody factor because we see so little of the in-universe Buzz Lightyear franchise that it wouldn't stand out otherwise. The spinoff cartoon _Buzz Lightyear of Star Command_ is more of a straight Space Opera for kids once it had room to stretch its legs, and _Lightyear_ saw the in-universe origin story of the franchise.
-   Captain Sternn from _Heavy Metal_, although we don't get to see his exploits, just the trial.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The Prince of Space from _Prince of Space_.
    -   Also his Captain Ersatz Space Chief from _Invasion of the Neptune Men_.
-   Bronco from _Gentlemen Broncos_
-   Buckaroo Banzai from _The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension_.
-   The MCU incarnation of Peter "Star-Lord" Quill from _Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)_ styles himself as one with some Lovable Rogue mixed in for flavor. This is actually his intentional presentation of himself, curated from his only Earthly experience being life as a small child before being abducted into space. As such, he pulls this off as a form of self-identity. Also, Iron Man, who nicknames everybody, actually refers to him as "Flash Gordon" in _Avengers: Infinity War_, which he actually takes as a compliment.
-   Commander Peter Quincy Taggart in the Show Within a Show of the _Galaxy Quest_, played in-universe by Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen). Taggart is a parody of Captain Kirk, while Nesmith is a parody of William Shatner for double bonus.
-   "_Flash!_ AHAHHHH! He'll save every one of us!"
-   _Flesh Gordon_ is a softcore pornographic example of the trope.
-   With a plot similar to _Galaxy Quest_, _The Adventures Of Captain Zoom In Outer Space_ has an actor getting abducted by aliens who don't understand his show is fiction. The main difference is that his TV show was a parody of _Buck Rogers_ rather than _Star Trek_.

    Literature 

-   Many would claim E. E. "Doc" Smith is the father of this trope, though his best-known creation, the _Lensman_ series, is arguably more of a Space Police story.
-   _Captain Future_ and his friends are another early straight example, complete with a popular animated adaptation in Japan.
-   _Honor Harrington_ has the series within a series _Preston of the Spaceways_, often mentioned in the context of warning against stupid heroics. To be told one is "playing Preston of the Spaceways" is _not_ a compliment.
-   The parody was firmly entrenched by the time Robert A. Heinlein wrote _The Rolling Stones (1952)_ in The '50s: Roger Stone and, later, Grandma Hazel help support the family by writing a deliberately over-the-top three-vee serial in the Captain Space Defender mold.
-   In universe, this is how Ciaphas Cain (**HERO OF THE IMPERIUM!**) is portrayed. Whether he is or not in person is debatable.
-   Used as a joke in-universe in the X-Wing Series.
-   The _Doctor Who New Adventures_ novel _The Highest Science_ has the Doctor discover a triangular video cassette showing "Captain Millennium" battling "Libida, Queen of the Virenies", which he considers to be So Bad, It's Good. (And when it ends on a cliffhanger with the Captain's assistant being threatened by an evil robot, he concludes it's "almost like real life, in a glamorized sort of way".)
-   There was a short written series in French kid magazine _Astrapi_ called _Nono le robot conteur_ ("Nono the robot story-teller"). In the last episode, a girl asks Nono to tell his own story, and he reveals he used to be Cosmo Max, a handsome and famous space adventurer with dozens of fangirls. However, he wanted to become immortal, so he turned himself into a robot.
-   The _Space Academy_ series by C.T. Phipps: Vance Turbo, HERO OF SPACCCE develops this reputation by the third book where people correct his pronunctiation of the title affixed to his name. EarthGov and Space Fleet has worked to give him a legendary reputation as a defender of the innocent and opponent of evil through their propaganda machine. Interestingly, plenty of people believe he's the parody Idiot Hero of the trope as well, though neither is accurate.
-   Toby Frost's Space Captain Smith, hero of the British Space Empire, is Captain Space with a Stiff Upper Lip.
-   In _Rally Round the Flag, Boys!_, Oscar Hoffa's work as a television producer includes watching an episode of _The Adventures of Crunch Crandall, Spaceman_, whose titular hero fights to "save the fair Skarlotta, a Martian lass from the foul clutches of 'It,' the nameless monster of Ursa Minor." Oscar's executive complaints include not seeing enough cleavage on Skarlotta and the monster needing to be recast on the grounds of being "a faggot."
-   Isaac Asimov's _The Complete Adventures of Lucky Starr_ has overtones of this trope, intentionally as the series was requested as a juvenile series of sci-fi books who Asimov wrote under a pseudonym, but is downplayed by Asimov's traditional style.
-   Deconstructed in _Will Save the Galaxy for Food_ and its sequel _Will Destroy the Galaxy for Cash_, whose setting had a brief "golden age" of heroic star pilots before they were rendered technologically obsolete by teleportation.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Rocky Jones, Space Ranger_ is exactly the sort of show the title makes you think it is, played straight.
-   Likewise for _Space Patrol._ Notably, Elroy Jetson's favorite TV hero, "Captain Blast," is clearly a parody of _Space Patrol,_ complete with the characters doing ads for breakfast cereal with giveaway toys in the box.
-   Not to be confused with... _Space Patrol!_ This British series is this trope done with puppets.
-   _Captain Video_, the original TV space hero, was Played Straight in his billing as an "electronic wizard! Master of time and space! Guardian of the safety of the world!" All this while being the face of the No Budget DuMont network. His future space uniform was made out of an Army surplus uniform, and one of his weapons was made out of car parts. Not quite old enough to be the Ur-Example, but his show is certainly one of the Trope Codifiers. Sadly, only a few recorded episodes survive today.
-   While _most_ versions of the _Flash Gordon_ franchise focus on a single planet, Mongo, and would therefore fall under the Planetary Romance trope, the 1950's Live Action TV series was of the Captain Space variety, with Flash, Dale, and Zarkov zipping all over the universe to fight evil. It was produced during the period when the comic strip had gone a similar route.
-   Tek Jansen of _The Colbert Report_ (which provides the above image) is a Parody Sue who is written by Colbert himself.
-   "Ace" Rimmer (What a guy!); Arnold Rimmer's Alternate Universe self from _Red Dwarf_. Smoke him a kipper, he'll be back for breakfast.
    -   "Our" Rimmer tried to fake this in an earlier episode when he introduced himself as "Captain Arnold J Rimmer, Space Adventurer" while dressed in a garish uniform.
-   _Star Trek: Voyager_. The holodeck program _The Adventures of Captain Proton_ was an Affectionate Parody of this trope, even if downplayed compared to most examples.
    
    **Tom Paris:** (making a Dynamic Entry as the hero) Captain Proton: Spaceman First Class, protector of Earth, scourge of intergalactic evil... at your service.
    
    -   Generally speaking, _Star Trek's_ critics have always accused it of being this trope (as if that were something to be ashamed of!), and its defenders have indignantly denied it, since the franchise has always tried to rise above the stereotypes and limitations of this trope's subgenre.
-   The titular protagonist of _The Middleman_, a pulp hero who battles mad scientists and supervillains straight out of old-fashioned sci-fi novels and comic books.
-   _Black Mirror_: Robert Daly, the antagonist of "USS Callister", is a very dark take on this character type.
-   Ed Mercer from _The Orville_ (played by series creator Seth MacFarlane) as the Orville is a parody of science fiction shows (mostly Star Trek) has overtones of this, although how much depends on the episode.
-   _Buck Rogers in the 25th Century_ is basically this, albeit with a Cassette Futurism aesthetic instead of a Raygun Gothic one.

    Music 

-   _Devin Townsend_: Captain Spectacular in _Ziltoid the Omniscient_ is a parody of Star Trek captains. By the Z2 he became much more similar to Captain Space trope.
-   _Flash Fearless Vs The Zorg Women Parts 5 & 6_ is a 1975 Concept Album with an All-Star Cast (the cover credits Alice Cooper, Elkie Brooks, Jim Dandy, James Dewar, John Entwhistle and Maddy Prior, but that is far from a full list), described as "A Nostalgic Musical of the 24th Century", and with an accompanying comic featuring Fearless.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Masked legacy wrestler Astroman, primarily seen in the Dominican Republic, though Astroman III wasn't particularly heroic, suffering from Chronic Back Stabbing Disorder to the point "The Betrayer" was his Red Baron.

    Theme Parks 

-   Captain EO featured Michael Jackson as a musical one of these.

    Toys 

-   Some _LEGO_ minifigures;
-   Major Matt Mason was a popular early line of action figures about an astronaut and his space exploring adventures with giant alien buddy Captain Lazer.

    Video Games 

-   **CAPTAIN GORDON, DEFENDER OF EARTH!** of _Disgaea: Hour of Darkness_ is the Trope Namer.
-   _Blasto_: Phil Hartman voices the title charter, who is played for comedy.
-   Rad Gravity in _The Adventures of Rad Gravity_.
-   _Captain Commando_ mixes this with Toku tropes.
-   Your protagonist in _Creature Shock_, investigating a monster-infested asteroid.
-   _Captain Quazar_: The title character.
-   Drake Redcrest in _Chibi-Robo!_ is an action figure from a Show Within a Show.
-   Crash and Coco's Star skins in _Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled_ have them look the part, but play it for laughs, since they end up having accidents with their respective tools.
-   _Earthworm Jim_ was a deliberate parody of space heroes plus the Mascot with Attitude.
-   _EXTRAPOWER_: Galaxy Star is a sincere portrayal of this trope. Captain of the Galaxy's team, he's the charismatic and handsome American given jurisdiction to protect both Earth and Space, and does so without sinister intent. Both Zophy and Sharkungo consider him their good friend, and is eager to provide them with as much support as he can.
-   Captain Falcon of _F-Zero_ and _Super Smash Bros._ fame is this trope as seen through Japanese eyes, particularly in the latter where he is voiced in overly hammy and terse Fake American Engrish.
-   _Captain Cosmos_ from _Fallout 3_. Posters even showed the time slot of his show to be identical to the original air time of _Star Trek: The Original Series_. In the fifth DLC, one of the major NPCs is a big fan.
-   Rolf from _Galaxy Fight_ fits the bill, with his heroic personality, wearing a red and white space suit at all times, and utilizing a ray gun and jet pack in combat.
-   Flip Hero in _Hero_ and _Hero Core_. This heroic spaceman thwarts the machinations of Cruiser Tetron and his robot minions. Subverted: Hero is one of Tetron's machines gone rogue.
-   _Live A Live_'s Distant Future chapter features Captain Square, the protagonist of an in-universe retro video game. He looks like Captain Future with goggles in lieu of a helmet, and fights alien monsters across 9 different levels.
-   Commander Shepard in _Mass Effect_ is a modern Reconstruction of this trope, alongside the myriad of other space sci-fi reconstructions that _Mass Effect_ is famous for.
-   Captain Jethro from _Planet 404_
-   Captain Qwark of _Ratchet & Clank_. In the first game, Ratchet seeks his help to fight Chairman Drek, only to learn he'd been hired by Drek as a spokesman and The Heavy. In later games he varies between secondary antagonist and annoying Distressed Dude.
-   Ace (Dexter) from _Space Ace_. Parodied somewhat in that the villain's secret weapon has changed him into a gawky kid who's constantly yelling and screaming. The player gets the option of changing him back into the musclebound space warrior version, but doing this makes the level more difficult.
-   In _Stellaris_, one Random Event has one of your science ship's chief officers (presumably a captain) going insane and believing themself to embody this trope, and that the very stars are pulsing to send them a coded warning about a coming catastrophe that only they can avert. The event ends with said officer being shipped back to your homeworld for therapy, bidding them farewell with "Thank you for your service, \[Science Officer\], protector of the realm!"

    Web Animation 

-   _Homestar Runner_ has "Space Captainface, pretender of the galaxies", Strong Bad's alter ego as head astronaut/poster boy for Strong Badia's space program, SBASAF (the Strong Badian Administration of Some Aluminum Foil, pronounced "sbace-aff"). His missions include Camera Spoofing an Italian spy satellite and attempting to turn fifteen bucks into a million dollars through a "vague understanding of the theory of relativity".

    Web Original 

    Western Animation 

-   _Space Ghost_ is a rare latter-day example that plays this trope completely straight.
-   As in the original game, Dexter is this in the _Space Ace_ segments of _Saturday Supercade._
-   _Atomic Betty_ uses this trope to add to the retro-futuristic appeal of the show. The title character is notably different other examples of this trope in that she's a 12-year-old girl who has to Wake Up, Go to School, Save the World (or in this case, the galaxy).
-   _Ben 10_ and especially it sequels are known to play this trope straight. The Plumbers are a secret Space Police that deals with different inter-planetary issues, they travel between planets fighting against the bad guys with a different set of weapons or alien superpowers. It's clear that Ben wants to be like this, as he wanted to join in the first series a special organization that was mostly a lighthearted parody of this (They were portrayed as rather cartoonish but still capable and useful) and in the flashforward episodes he is seen as a straight example of this trope. The sequel series _Ben 10: Alien Force_ and _Ben 10: Ultimate Alien_ shows a very diverse set of Plumbers with many of them falling squarely on this trope.
    -   With the increasing Space Opera elements in the series, this is seen as a logical progression, inter-planetary travelling became a standard of the series, and many of the villains in the show are classical sci-fi enemies that must be dealt with a regular space hero.
-   _Duck Dodgers_, in both the original cartoon and its TV series Spin-Off.
-   _Buzz Lightyear of Star Command_ is a cartoon based off the Buzz Lightyear property seen in the _Toy Story_ movies. In this cartoon, Buzz is less of a parody than Captain Space heroes often are and the show is closer in tone to genuine Space Opera.
-   Major Courage (a parody of Shatner's Kirk) of _Courage of the Cosmos_, a Show Within a Show in the _DuckTales (1987)_ episode, "Where No Duck Has Gone Before".
-   Zapp Brannigan of _Futurama_ thinks he's a dashing space hero, but in actuality is a despicable, cowardly, perverted idiot who inevitably gets all the men under his command killed pointlessly. Unlike most examples he is not so much a broad parody, as he is very explicitly based on Captain Kirk (his character was originally pitched as "What if William Shatner was captain of the Enterprise rather than Kirk?"), although he does have moments of referencing other things - in "In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela" he has a recurring Imagine Spot in the form of an incredibly cheap looking black-and-white adventure serial called "The Transcredible Exploits of Zapp Brannigan", depicting Action Girl Leela as a helpless Damsel in Distress and Zapp as a macho hero fighting a stereotypical Yellow Peril villain.
    
    _So, Emperor Chop Chop, once again we meet at last. Drop that space gun or I'll shoot... like so! \[shoots\]_
    
-   The "Starboy and the Captain of Outer Space" movie-within-a-show in _Home Movies_.
-   Crash Nebula is a Show Within a Show in _The Fairly OddParents!_ starring the titular Crash Nebula, a prime example of this trope.
-   The eponymous character of _Captain Star_ is an egotistical Captain Kirk spoof totally oblivious to the fact that he's been Kicked Upstairs to a desolate planet at the edge of the universe.
-   The Vindicators, and especially Vance Maximus (Renegade Starsoldier), from _Rick and Morty_, seem to be a more modern take on this, with Maximus himself being a clear nod to the film portrayal of Star-Lord. This contrasts with Rick and the various sci-fi beings he usually interacts with, who are based more on cheesy eighties and nineties cartoons.
-   In _Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_, Jupiter Jim is a popular series the turtles are big fans of, and the main character seems to be inspired by this trope.
-   In _Steven Universe_, Lars helps the Off-Color Gems steal a Cool Starship in an Offscreen Moment of Awesome. He then becomes the ship's commander, and gets fully into this trope when making decisions (while posing heroically).
-   _Captain Simian and the Space Monkeys_ as the name indicates is a parody of this trope mixed with Apes in Space.
-   Captain Adam Francis Shatner in _Tripping the Rift_ is a parody of this trope as the name implies (referencing two well-known actors of camp shows Adam West and William Shatner) as captain of the Confederation (the in-universe parody of The Federation) and with many characteristics of the trope.
-   Marissa Faireborn in the third season of _The Transformers_ has a bit of this vibe. It probably helps her badass status that she's implied to be Flint and Lady Jaye's daughter.
-   In the 1960's, _Space Angel_ was this trope, with _Clutch Cargo_\-style animation! (That is, real filmed actors' mouths superimposed over still drawings. Really!)
-   The eponymous _Commander Clark_ tries his hardest to live up to the trope, although his animal instincts can tend to get in the way.
-   In a _VeggieTales_ episode about bullying, Junior daydreams of being a space hero of this type, facing off against an evil alien who resembles his bully.
