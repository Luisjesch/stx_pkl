_"It's time for me to live up to my family name and face full life consequences!"_

Family honor is the feeling of pride a person has for their own family or clan, whether because of a unique family history, the achievements of ancestors, the elevated social status of their family, or because of some cultural aspect of their homeland that places a strong emphasis on associating personal identity with family identity. Central to the idea of family honor is that the actions of one member reflect on the reputation of the entire family, and the reputation of the entire family reflects on the individual member. Compare to Thicker Than Water, which focuses on a characters obligations to another member of the family, which may or may not be expressed in terms of family honor.

For a character that values family honor, it normally works as a motivator for them to try to act in a way that preserves the dignity and reputation of their family. In cultures that practice dueling, this often includes a willingness to fight against those that insult the family name (which can result in a full-blown Cycle of Revenge when two families each constantly feel the need to avenge themselves for the other's latest slight against them). However, this also includes less violent expressions. Family honor need not just be a motivator for revenge, but can also motivate honesty, courage, hard work, faithfulness, loyalty, etc.

Certain cultures and social classes tend to be more likely to place an emphasis on family honor than others. Some characters might come from a family that has a particularly high status in society and therefore are under a particular pressure to live up to their family name. Aristocrats, especially of the fighting variety such as European knights and Japanese Samurai, tend to place a high value on family honor. Likewise, frontier cultures outside of the protection or hindrance of The Government might maintain a similar, though less refined code out of survival necessity. Other characters might have to deal with social disabilities that come from being a part of a family that is in disgrace or otherwise has a reputation for dishonor.

Just a few of the ways that concepts of family honor (and honor in general) can be incorporated in a story include:

-   A character's sense of integrity is closely tied in with their family identity. Not only do they try to do the right thing because it is good in and of itself, but because they want to live up to and preserve their family's reputation for honorable behavior.
-   A scenario arises where the actions of one individual are said to bring credit or disgrace to their entire family, especially if such credit or disgrace is reflected in how society starts treating members of the family. In some scenarios, this may result in the point of formal privileges or disabilities being given to the entire family because of the actions of one member of the family.
-   A character must go on a quest to restore their family's honor, often by either making right what a family member did wrong or clearing an ancestor's name of something falsely attributed to them. Sometimes, this involves Honor-Related Abuse, though not always.
-   In societies where family honor is given particular importance, families can often act like a mini-state with policies, alliances, and enmities all carefully arranged. Family Honor can be a measurement of success as well as a way of getting more.
-   Arranged Marriages are commonplace; marriage is used primarily as a means to strengthen a family's sociopolitical alliances and produce heirs. They will commonly be arranged as business transactions between the parents or guardians with little or no input from the children involved. (Sometimes, even when a Child Marriage Veto is _technically_ allowed, it will be strongly discouraged, or the prospective bride and/or groom might be threatened with disownment or death if s/he does not accept the marriage.)
-   Or on a smaller scale, a character could be a "Well Done, Son" Guy, hoping to please his/her parents (or Obnoxious In-Laws) in some way, shape, or form.
-   A character could be caught between their family's traditions, and a desire to live the more modern lifestyle their peers are living.
-   In patriarchal cultures, the honor of women and children may be seen as a reflection on (particularly) the men in their lives (fathers, brothers, husbands, sons, etc.) (For example, if a wife cheats, her husband is seen as unable to keep her under control, and therefore "less" of a man.) The honor of women and children in this type of setting can only decrease; a man's honor in a setting like this can either increase _or_ decrease depending on his actions. (Getting rid of the "wayward" wife/daughter/son/etc. might be seen as a way to increase it or gain it back.) The trope Men Act, Women Are is _very_ much at play.
-   Sins of Our Fathers could be a theme, too. Especially in the case of Feuding Families.

     Anime & Manga 

-   _Dragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge_: This is the entire reason Cooler tries to avenge Frieza's death at Goku's hands; he feels Frieza has disgraced their family name by losing to Goku and it's up to him to redeem it. He makes it very clear that he has no love for his brother and would have gladly killed Frieza himself if Goku hadn't done so.
-   _Naruto_: Ninja clans and their politics are often a plot point:
    -   Despite being a founding clan of the Hidden Leaf Village, the Uchiha were infamous for this:
        -   Sasuke understandably is rather fixated on this, considering that he's basically the last Uchiha besides his treacherous brother Itachi. During The Team introductions, he states that his sole "ambition" is to kill his brother and then rebuild his clan, going so far as to abandon his village and comrades in order to do so. When he finds out that the Hidden Leaf's elders were the ones who ordered Itachi to annihilate the Uchiha, he goes completely off the deep end by redirecting his vengeance against the entire Hidden Leaf. Those who'd thought he had already jumped off the slippery slope were startled.
        -   _Itachi_ himself plays with this. When forced to choose between his clan or his village, he ultimately chooses to wipe out his own clan rather than allow them to plunge the Hidden Leaf into civil war. However, one of his primary conditions for doing so was that the village elders would allow him to spare Sasuke.
        -   The whole reason the Uchiha end up being wiped out in the first place is that they felt their honor was being violated by the rest of the Hidden Leaf, despite being one of its greatest clans, and were planning a coup in response.
    -   The Hyuga clan is split into a hereditary head house that runs the clan and branch houses that exist solely to serve the head house, with the justification being that it's all to protect the secrets of the clan's bloodline limit. Nonetheless, the Hyuga's insistence on family honor is portrayed as a force for evil, with all the good decisions made by Hyuga in the series being done for personal reasons:
        -   Branch member Hizashi grew up bitterly resenting his brother Hiashi for becoming head Hyuga simply because he was born a few seconds earlier, but ends voluntarily sacrificing himself to save Hiashi not for the sake of his clan, but out of brotherly love and to finally choose his own fate for the first time.
        -   Hiashi's older daughter Hinata trains day and night to become worthy of being her father's heir but receives nothing but coldness for her efforts. When she does finally finds her strength, it's for her own sake and in honor of Naruto, not out of any real desire to become heir.
        -   Hizashi's son Neji also grew up resenting his position as a branch member who would always remain a mere servant despite his prodigious talent. But after Naruto beats the fatalism out of him, he begins to repair his relationships with Hiashi and Hinata, working with them not as a servant, but as a dear surrogate son and brother respectively.
        -   Hiashi himself gradually softens towards his daughters and begins to abandon the traditions that kept the branch houses subservient to the head family, even personally training Neji in techniques that were originally exclusive to the head house.
    -   The other founding clan of the Hidden Leaf, the Senju, became an aversion of this trope after the village was formed, to the point where they're now all-but-extinct and mostly have only spiritual successors from a variety of other bloodlines. The only known Senju descendant is Tsunade, who personally puts little stock in her heritage (for a while, she even viewed it as more a curse than a blessing) and sees herself is a ninja of the village first and foremost.
    -   Naruto Uzumaki himself plays with this a bit. He deeply admired and respected the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze, long before he ever found out that the man was his father. Also, while Naruto is one of the few known descendants of a particularly respected clan, he's not one to put too much weight on family heritage or tradition, having grown up as an orphaned village pariah.
-   If it wasn't for this then _Ranma ½_ would be over in two volumes at most. The Saotome family honor is in serious jeopardy because Ranma's father is a con artist that engaged him to many girls to pay off debts.
-   _Ping Pong_: Kazuma's reason for doing everything.

    Comic Books 

-   _Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)_ has Hope Kintobor, niece of Dr. Eggman and half-sister to Snively. A big part of her reason for working for GUN, after Eggman carpet bombed Knothole, was because Snively switched back to the Eggman Empire's side shortly after sending her away; Hope wants to destroy the Empire and restore honor to the Kintobor name after all the atrocities Eggman and Snively have committed.
    
    **Hope**: I'm going to become the best engineer ever! And then I'm going to help kick both Eggman and your butts! Then maybe our family name with be worth something!
    

     Fanfiction 

-   A very harsh example is present in _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ fanfic _Kanashī, Wütend, Desolato_, a What If? for _Gankona, Unnachgiebig, Unità_. Instead of being proud of Japan for being in a relationship with both Italy _and_ Germany, China and South Korea—his brothers—were ashamed. In fact, they basically called him a dishonorable disgrace.
    
    "You act like filth, you live in filth-aru." Uh oh! UH OH!  
    The other laughed as he threw the latch open, swarms upon swarms of a certain kind of insect crawling out. "He's right you know!" He sneered. "You always talk about 'honor' yet did one of the most dishonorable things possible!"  
    "Taking two lovers is just plain disgusting-aru." The eldest nation scorned while turning his back on the triad, the latter doing the same. "You are no longer my little brother-aru. I wish I had never found you in that bamboo forest-aru."  
    Japan did not even register the cockroaches crawling all over him.
    
-   _Royal Business_: _Both_ Twilight Sparkle and Spike feel this sentiment regarding their clan, which is an attribute of the Canterlot gentry.
    
    Twilight's eyes misted slightly as she recognized the attitude. It was her own, the ethos of a young member of the elite scholar-gentry of Canterlot. It was the culture she had absorbed as a small filly from her parents and her big brother, and now Spike had learned the same lessons from her. Be smart. Be honorable. Be diligent. Never let your family down.
    
-   _Son of the Sannin_:
    -   This is a major motivator for Sasuke, though for entirely different reasons than his canon counterpart. Here, Itachi and Shisui fail to prevent the Uchiha coup, which resulted in massive civilian and ninja casualties. The two of them and Sasuke become pariahs due to their clansmen's actions as the only three survivors and Sasuke's primary goal in life is to restore his family's good name.
    -   While it's not as important to the narrative or her character arc, Karin mentions at one point that her goal in life is to one day restore the effectively extinct Uzuamki clan to it's former glory. Of course, there's only one way to actually rebuild a clan, so her section in the epilogue sees her pregnant with her _seventh_ child.

     Films — Animated 

-   Deconstructed in _The Book of Life_. Manolo wants to make his family proud, but he doesn't want to follow the bullfighting career, if it means killing the bull. There's also how his love for music is choice of career. This leads to some estrangement with his father. Reconstruction when Manolo uses his music skills to calm the demonic bull and earns his family's, including his father's, approval.
-   _Mulan_: The title character longs to bring her family honor, but keeps failing in all the traditional areas. She finally achieves great honor at the end, only for her father to tell her, "The greatest gift and honor is having you for a daughter."
-   In _Turning Red_, this is very important to Mei. So much so that her talking about it are the first lines of the movie. Balance between maintaining this and pursuit of one's own goals is a major theme.

     Films — Live-Action 

-   _The Eagle (2011)_: The film adaptation of _The Eagle of the Ninth_ by Rosemary Sutcliff. "If I can't win back my family's honor by being a soldier, then I'll do it by finding the lost eagle."
-   In _When Darkness Falls_, Nina gets accused of having offended her family's honor because she met a boy.
-   Costigan from _The Departed_ cites this as a possible reason why he's joining the police force when he has other, much more promising opportunities in front of him. His entire family aside from his father were criminals, and it's implied that he is trying to make up for it. When asked about it, he quotes a line that he attributes to Hawthorne: "Families are always rising and falling in America."
-   _When We Leave_: After Umay leaves her abusive husband to seek refuge with her family in Germany and refuses to return or to send back her son to live with his father in Turkey, the community turns its back on her family. Umay is told explicitly that if her family has to choose between her and the community, they will not choose her.

     Literature 

-   In _A Brother's Price_, this is enforced, as all family members are punished by the _law_ if one steps out of line. One can get out of this by claiming that the family is estranged and was not working together, but it is automatically assumed that they _did_ work together. After Heria and Jerin Whistler save the life of a princess, Queen Elder compliments Eldest Whistler (who wasn't even there at the time) for acting in accordance with the law, even though this endangered Jerin, a valuable boy. However, they also value their honor in the more abstract sense; Jerin's sister Corelle, when she notices that he's being courted by a noblewoman who thinks the Whistler family is beneath her, remarks that they will not be looked down on by their future sisters in law, and rescues Jerin from the unpleasant company.

-   Lucy Valentine, star of novel series bearing her name, had given up her sizeable trust fund because she didn't think she deserved it. Though she is not a wild girl, or done anything to besmirch the family name and honor, she felt unworthy of benefitting from the family's success since without her ESPer gift, she could not contribute as Valentines before her had.
-   _The Eagle of the Ninth_: Marcus Flavius Aquila, the son of the commander of the IX Legion, destroyed by barbarians in what is now Scotland, goes on a mission to recover the legion's eagle standard, in order to restore his family honor, and by recovering it he would also end up restoring the honor of the legion.
-   _RCN_: Family honor is a big deal to the aristocratic families that rule the Republic of Cinnabar, and most especially to the lead characters, Daniel Leary and Adele Mundy. Each character strongly associates their personal honor with the honor of their family, and the strongest promise they can give is on the honor of their family name. The reputation of their families also has a strong impact on how others treat them.

-   In _The Lord of the Rings_ it is the proudest boast of the house of the stewards that they never made themselves kings. Other aspects of this come in. For instance, Aragorn is proud of his descent but considers it his duty to atone for Isildur's failure 3000 years ago.
-   _Vorkosigan Saga_ has tons of this. It even has the name of a fictional dynasty in its title.
-   A Running Gag in _Jeeves and Wooster_ is Bertie's exaggerated sense of family honor and strict adherence to "the code of the Woosters", which dictates, above all things, Honor Before Reason. His Aunt Agatha is equally obsessed with family honor, but has a different idea of it than he does, most of it revolving around not marrying into the lower classes.
-   The Harry Harrison alternate reality novel _Tunnel Through the Deeps_ (aka _A Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah_) has British engineer Captain Augustine Washington working to complete said tunnel to restore his family's honor lost when his ancestor George Washington was shot as a traitor to King George III.
-   Seen in _Harry Potter_, primarily with the older pureblood families such as the Blacks, Malfoys, and even the Gaunts. Can overlap with (or be superseded by) Thicker Than Water, depending on who is involved.
-   In _Honor Harrington_, the Manticoran royal family have strong traditions of duty and integrity. It's more or less mandatory for Wintons to enter some form of public service, generally either the military or diplomatic corps. They also have a reputation of keeping their word. In _Shadow of Freedom_, Michelle Henke (first cousin to Queen Elizabeth III) trades on this when she starts setting up diplomatic agreements with the star systems she's just liberated from Solarian control, knowing that it is extremely unlikely Elizabeth will repudiate said agreements.
    -   The Arranged Marriage department; while Winton princes and princesses are encouraged to marry relatively early to ensure the succession, the current heir is _required_ to marry a commoner.
-   _Kindling Ashes_: The Dunslade family is a dragonslayer family and all of Corran's angst in this book is about living up to this reputation.
-   Very important to Aunt Alexandra of _To Kill a Mockingbird,_ who believes that the Finches are not just run-of-the-mill people. It motivates many of her actions throughout the book, most notably trying to get Scout to act more ladylike and feminine.
-   _The Silerian Trilogy_: This is taken _very_ seriously by Silerians, resulting in many vendettas.
-   In _The Expanse_ avenging the family name is the sole motivation of Melba Koh, aka Clarissa Mao for most of the third book.

     Live-Action TV 

-   _Babylon 5_:
    -   In the episode "There All Honor Lies", a Minbari clan tries to avenge their members killed by Sheridan during the Earth-Minbari war by framing Sheridan. While questioning one of the members, Delenn points out that Lennier is a member of the same clan and has brought honor to the clan. Lennier calls out his own clan for using dishonorable methods, however Delenn and Lennier decide not to go public with the fact that the frame-up was ordered by the leaders of the clan, in order to preserve its honor.
    -   Centauri clans are always squabbling among themselves. This may be a subversion as it is more about family power than honor, but honor is not totally absent.
    -   Londo kills his friend in a Duel to the Death that obliged the winner to take on the loser's dependents as his own. His friend had, as it happens, deliberately arranged the duel to ensure the protection of his family.
-   _Star Trek_: Klingons wear this as one of their hats. Worf's father was accused of betraying the empire by Duras of helping the Romulans attack Khitomer. Worf would eventually accept a ritual loss of honor from the Klingon High Council in order to protect the Empire from a scandal that had framed his father, falsely dishonored his house, and could potentially lead to civil war. While Worf decided to accept this dishonor, it was decided to keep the true identity of Worf's brother Kurn secret in order to protect Kurn's honor.
-   _Kung Fu (1972)_: In "An Eye for an Eye", Caine meets a small southern family whose honor had been besmirched via a Union soldier raping and impregnating the old man's daughter. The old man and his son are out for revenge.
-   _Familys Honor_: A Korean drama about how a particular tries to uphold their aristocratic reputation.
-   In _Game of Thrones_, this concept is _the_ motivation for Lord Tywin Lannister, The Patriarch of the villainous Lannister family. Made particularly clear in the speech he gives his son Jaime during Tywin's first appearance. He even starts a frickin' _war_ because another House kidnapped his son Tyrion — whom he despises, by the way, but he's still a Lannister.
    
    "Your mother's dead, before long I'll be dead, and you... and your brother, and your sister, and all of her children. All of us dead, all of us rotting in the ground. It's the _family name_ that lives on. It's _all_ that lives on. Not your honor, not your personal glory, family."
    
-   In _The North And The South_, this is a major plot point that occurs several times in the miniseries:
    -   When Charles Main gets in fights, it's bad for the family's honor, but when he gets in a duel and shows compassion for not shooting a helpless opponent, he impresses Orry Main because of how his actions made the family look good.
    -   Any time the Hazards visit Mont Royal or the Mains visit Lehigh Station, there tends to be an argument that leads to an insult of one of the families' honor.
-   _Guiding Light_. After a young woman kills a mobster in self-defense (he was trying to rape her and her friend), his brother quickly marries her in order to protect her—despite being a ruthless mafioso chief, his mother is adamant that she will not kill any member of her family so as not to disgrace them.

     Tabletop Games 

-   _Ninja Burger_ uses this as a core mechanic (treating the franchise as the family unit).
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_ supplement _Oriental Adventures_ (1985). Upholding the family honor was very important to characters created under these rules, which covered campaigns set in the Asia-like region called Kara-tur.
-   Aslan in _Traveller_. Other cultures often have this as well but Aslan are notable for it.

     Video Games 

-   Sebastial Vael, a Religious Bruiser from _Dragon Age II_, risks excommunication to restore the honor of his (massacred) family.
-   In _Art of Fighting_ this is pretty much Kasumi Todoh in a nutshell. Back in the first _AOF_, her father Ryuhaku was defeated by Ryo Sakazaki (practitioner of the rival Kyokugen School of martial arts) and subsequently left for parts unknown for self-training, leaving young Kasumi in charge of her family's dojo. As such, she hounds the Kyokugen-ryuu users (specifically Ryo) in _Art of Fighting 3_ and throughout _The King of Fighters_ series with the hopes of besting them so that her father can return home (little does she know that Ryuhaku is actually following Kasumi to see how she's progressed as an heiress to the style). Kasumi holds no real ill-will towards the Kyokugen Team (she even teamed up with Ryo's kid sister Yuri on the Women Fighters Team in _KOF 2000_); it's simply a family obligation.
-   _Mass Effect_ has Ashley Williams, a Military Brat following in the footsteps of her father, grandfather, and great-grandmother. Unfortunately, her family has been unofficially blacklisted since her grandfather surrendered to the turians during the brief First Contact war (even though his only other option was letting his troops starve). The fact that he is the only human commander to do so just makes it worse.
    
    _Takes a special kind of thickheaded to march into a job where your family's blacklisted. Did it anyway._
    
    -   If Kaidan dies on Virmire, she'll despairingly lament that it should have been her. Shepard can gently call her out on this, and ask how far is she willing to go just to clear her family's name. Eventually, she will (depending on player choices) either die a hero's death on Virmire and be held up as a symbol of interspecies cooperation, or become the second human Spectre. Either way, she restores honor to family name.
-   _Tomb Raider (2013)_: Played straight and then subverted with Lara's friend Sam, a descendant of Himiko. She begins the game admiring and respecting her ancestor to the extent that Lara remarks that she _loves_ telling Himiko's story. Near the end of the game, after everything they've been through, Sam explicitly states she hopes she never hears Himiko's name again.
    -   In _Rise of the Tomb Raider_ Lara is trying to restore her family's honor that was stained by her Adventurer Archaeologist father's outrageous claims about the supernatural. This was the case in the first game as well, but after Yamatai Lara knows that her father was correct and wants to prove it.
-   Not a particularly prominent example, but the von Karmas from the Ace Attorney certainly qualify. Manfred von Karma is a prosecutor who has never lost a case in forty years, and he's raised his daughter, Franziska, and his adopted son/student, Miles Edgeworth, to do the same.
    
    **Franziska von Karma:** A von Karma is someone who is destined to be perfect! Miles Edgeworth... you are no longer worthy! You are no longer worthy of being a von Karma! And neither am I!
    
    -   To a much lesser extent, the Fey family. Being the future Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique appears to have its ups and downs for Maya Fey, but, if nothing else, it seems to be the source of a lot of pressure and uncertainty.
-   This is built into the system in _Crusader Kings_ where the score that determines how well you've done at the end of the game is called 'family prestige'. All members of the dynasty are born with a prestige bonus (making other nobles more favourably disposed towards them) based on their family's accumulated prestige, and when they die the total amount of prestige they've accumulated through their life is added to their family's prestige score. Prestige can be gained from events, by holding land, by making a favourable marriage with another famous dynasty, winning wars, and many other things. Players are encouraged to maximize their dynasty's prestige not only through their own character(s), but with all branches of the dynasty.
    -   Members of the Muslim faith have an additional caveat to this trope called 'Decadence', representing the cycle of (often violent and sudden) overthrows of established dynasties in the Middle East. Decadence is a trait gained by male Muslims at random, with certain things (like being unlanded or having the Seven Deadly Sins) making it more likely and others (performing virtuous deeds like _Zakat_ or undergoing the _Hajj_, holding lands or having the Seven Heavenly Virtues) making it less likely. Decadence score is given to your dynasty at a whole, accumulated by every decadent member, and reaching a high Decadence score reduces your tax income, makes your soldiers fight worse, and at high levels can spawn massive revolts to overthrow you. Playing a Muslim dynasty is an exercise in keeping your family on the straight and narrow, doing good deeds to reduce dynasty decadence, and either vigorously pruning the family tree or continually expanding to keep your family members landed and conquering to reduce the risk of decadence.
-   In _Melody_, Xianne is so shaken up that she inadvertently broke policy at her aunt’s massage parlor by giving the protagonist a happy ending during his massage that she tracks him down to apologize to him personally. In her mind, even though she wasn’t aware of the mistake she was making, she disgraced her family by making it.
-   _Cookie Run Kingdom_: Everything Raspberry Cookie does is for the sake of House Raspberry, and she is quick to challenge anyone who slanders her house to a duel. She does tend to be little overzealous about it however, taking even completely innocent comments, like Princess Cookie saying she's tired of fighting, as grievous insults at everything House Raspberry stands for.

     Webcomics 

-   In _Harbourmaster_, family is a big deal to Verans, like the Monteblancs.
-   _Unsounded_: Mistress Lori is considered bad luck, and others blame the attack on the shrine on the gods' displeasure that she was made Mistress, because her twin sister ran away and refused to be publicly drugged, butchered and eaten as a sacrifice. Lori makes a comment about Iori "abandoning" her, despite Iori keeping in touch with her sister, for having chosen to live and making Lori's sheltered and wealthy life a tiny bit more difficult since some people view her with mistrust because her sister wasn't sacrificed.

     Web Original 

-   In _The Gamer's Alliance_, family honor is a big deal to the more traditional Yamatian clans such as the Hyuga and the Ofuchi, so much so that many Yamatians would rather commit suicide than bring dishonor upon their clan.

     Western Animation 

-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_: Prince Zuko had a confused and skewed idea of what having honor entailed. He sought to earn back his honor in his father's eyes, before realizing that his Uncle had already taught him to be an honorable man. Walking the Earth for a while helped.
-   _Ewoks_: The first season episode _Wicket's Wagon_ is centered around this, as the Warrick brothers find an abandoned battle wagon in the forest. Having learnt that it's built by his grand-grandfather, Wicket decides to rebuild it and later, when the Duloks steal it, get it back.
-   _The Beatles_ cartoon "I'll Cry Instead" affects this with the boys as a group. George is mistaken to be judo champ the Masked Masher, and he's not too keen on facing his opponent.
    
    **Paul:** For the honor of the Beatles, you must save face!  
    **George:** But what about the rest of me?
    
-   _The Fairly OddParents!_: Since Chester's dad, Bucky McBadbat, went down in history as the worst baseball player ever, Chester wants to become the best and redeem his family name. Sadly, he inherited his father's skills.

     Real Life 

-   Ancient Romans had a belief that psychological and moral attributes were passed down geneologically. As a result family honor could decide elections.
-   Almost universal in societies that haven't an effective state and often hangs along even then. People need help to survive and the obvious one to turn to is one's cousin. As everyone else in the area will be doing the same, family honor is one way of regulating the relations between different families.
-   The Middle-Eastern concept of _namus_, which often results in the murder of daughters who fall in love with someone other than who their family would want.
-   Many Asian cultures, especially the Chinese and Japanese, are ancestor-worshippers.
