_"You compare this insignificant nothing to Zarbon and Dodoria? Was that a joke? Ha! Either you brought the most cowardly of all my troops to my welcoming party, or the Frieza Force has become woefully faint of heart. How do you expect us to run an empire that strikes fear across the galaxies while we're cowering from a handful of Saiyan garbage?!"_

Whether you consider it short for villain credentials or villain credibility, it's a measure both of how much respect a villain gets among his fellow rogues and of how credible a threat the do-gooders and the authorities consider said villain to be. It's earned through successful completion of bold, daring and devious deeds; in other words, nothing so pedestrian as robbing bank or holding up a liquor store will suffice. It can also be lost in a heartbeat if one runs afoul of meddling kids and their talking dog.

A specific villainous version of a Karma Meter. Often a major motivation factor for a Card-Carrying Villain or Noble Demon.

A supertrope to Arson, Murder, and Admiration, a more comedic take on the concept. Compare Fame Through Infamy. Contrast Unintentionally Notorious Crime, where a villain gets _too much_ cred. Do not confuse with Villain Respect, which is directed at heroes.

     Anime & Manga 

-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   In the original _Dragon Ball_ series, Mercenary Tao has a reputation as a cold, ruthless assassin that he takes pride in; he goes so far as to refuse to pay a tailor for doing a week's worth of work on his uniform in three days purely because doing so would ruin said reputation.
    -   _Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F'_: While's he's largely motivated by revenge, Frieza also invokes this trope while calling out what's left of his empire on how far they've fallen, pointing out that no one will take them seriously if they're too busy being terrified of Goku to actually do anything, especially when they beg him to just forget about Goku and focus on rebuilding the empire.
        
        **Frieza**: How do you expect us to run an empire that strikes fear across the galaxies while we're cowering from a handful of Saiyan garbage?!
        
-   _EDENS ZERO_: Oracion Seis Galactica member and feared criminal boss Drakken Joe takes his reputation as The Dreaded Loan Shark _very_ seriously, as he sees it as insurance of his "clients" paying their owned dues on time knowing if they cross him they've got a Fate Worse than Death lined up. He doesn't hesitate to kill a lackey not just because he lost to the main characters, who he views as a bunch of inexperienced and idealistic brats way in over their heads, but because said lackey name-dropped his relation to Drakken and his screw-up reflects on him.
-   _One-Punch Man_: King is a hero who only has to show up and look emotionlessly at low-level monsters for them to flee or surrender, knowing he's taken out multiple high-level threats and no one knowing how he did it. He doesn't even have to be there for it to happen, just hearing the King Engine going "DOOM DOOM **DOOM**" faster and faster as he gets ready to butcher them is enough. As a result, the monsters who survived facing him (by letting themselves be arrested rather than fighting him) enjoy significant Villain Cred in prison. It's all BS: _King_ is the one scared out of his mind and literally has no powers beyond keeping a perfect Poker Face to prevent his fear from showing, the "King Engine" is just his unusually loud heartbeat that gets faster as he thinks he's going to die. The monsters he supposedly took out are actually Saitama's before he became a registered hero. Thankfully he's able to explain the situation to Saitama and even become friends with him.
-   In _One Piece_, a pirate's bounty is often used as a rough estimate of how dangerous they are, and bounties are often discussed as though they were Power Levels<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Pirates with high bounties will use them for bragging rights and to recruit crew members who want to work for the toughest pirate on the seas. Pirates with Blood Knight tendencies often revel in increases in their bounties (since it shows recognition of how dangerous they are, and makes it more likely that strong Marines and/or bounty hunters will pursue them), while those more inclined to Pragmatic Villainy would prefer to stay under the radar, or if possible not draw a bounty at all, for exactly the same reason (but are often presented as Dirty Cowards because of it).

    Comic Books 

-   In _Eternals (2021)_, after an initial attempt to goad Thanos into killing him, his omni-genocidal great-uncle Uranos eventually hails him as the one member of his line who is _not_ a disappointment. For his part, Thanos thanks Uranos and refers to him as "grandfather".
-   _The Flash_: One Silver Age story has the Mirror Master get upset that he's only ranked as the third most successful criminal in the prison newspaper, so he breaks out to commit more crimes in the hope of raising his standing.
-   _Batman_:
    -   A Silver Age story has the Joker and Clayface commit crimes using each other's M.O.s so that each can claim the title of Public Enemy #1.
    -   The same basic gimmick was used in Poison Ivy's debut story in the 1960s, where she arranges the capture of three other female criminals — Public Enemy numbers 1, 2, and 3 — so that she can step forward and take credit for various previously unsolved crimes.
    -   And used again in a story in the 1970s where rumors of Batman's murder sweep through the underworld, prompting the villains to assemble a Joker Jury of their own to evaluate the Villain Cred of the various supervillains (ranging from the Joker to Lex Luthor to the Riddler to Catwoman) claiming to be Batman's killer.
    -   In the Signalman's origin, he was a small-time crook who arrived in Gotham and attempted to form a gang only to be told he needed to build a reputation first. He adopted the costumed identity of the Signalman and used signal clues to taunt Batman in attempt to build up his rep.
    -   Killer Moth was briefly a very serious villain in the Silver Age, until he spectacularly lost his Villain Cred both in-universe and to readers by being comprehensively beaten by Barbara Gordon in her first ever outing as Batgirl.
-   _Superman_:
    -   _The Death of Superman (1961)_: After Luthor has succeeded in murdering Superman, the criminal underworld throw a party in his honor, declaring he is the greatest of them all.
    -   In _The Death of Luthor_: Lex bursts in rage when Supergirl saves his life because he, who used to be respected by all criminals, will be the gangland laughingstock from now on thanks to her.
-   _2000 AD_:
    -   In _Heavy Metal Dredd_, a wannabe criminal tries to make a name for himself by being the one person who's bad enough to kill Judge Dredd. Obviously, since this is Dredd we're talking about, this turns into an Epic Fail. Doesn't stop him from trying at least two more times with similar results.
    -   In _Tales From The Black Museum_, the serial killer Edward Bernardo is shown to have killed his family during Necropolis before sneaking into Justice Department HQ to attempt to kill Judge Death himself. Since Death is an immortal zombie, this obviously didn't work out, but he subsequently turned Bernardo into an undead serial killer because he appreciated the evil he found lurking in his mind.
-   Roderick Kingsley, the original Hobgoblin, a _Spider-Man_ foe came out of retirement to kill the fourth Hobgoblin, in part for being an embarrassment to the name Hobgoblin. He has since taken to establishing a business of establishing a costumed identity, gaining villain cred, and then licensing out the name to another villain; in fact when the _sixth_ Hobgoblin killed his brother and took the mantle, Kingsley chose to let him live after being impressed by his moves and hammering out an agreement to be given a share of the proceeds from his crimes.
-   In the Mickey Mouse Comic Universe Pete and the Phantom Blot started out as feared criminals, but years of defeats against Mickey ruined their reputations... And they have diametrically opposing approaches to it:
    -   When his reputation plummeted Phantom Blot was outraged and even had a Villainous Breakdown, as he actually enjoys people cowering in fear at his name, and many of his plans actually rely on civilians and the police fearing him. He then went and temporarily wiped out the memory of _everyone in Mouseton_ just to be feared again, and succeeded.
    -   Pete, on the other hand, basks in his poor reputation, as even the police are now prone to underestimate him and forget that if given enough time to build up some cash he can take over all crime in Mouseton and then expand and even try and Take Over the World. On the occasion he stumbled on a device that could take over all machines he accumulated a small fortune and repeatedly humiliated the police, who briefly considered he could be the mysterious "Master of All Machines" but then dismissed the idea as they knew he wasn't that good with advanced technology until the device's inventor asked them for help and revealed it had been lost where Pete was on vacation.
        -   On the other hand Pete has a _fearsome_ reputation among other criminals, as they know he's capable and willing to come up with good plans for other criminals and doublecrossing him means Pete _will_ take his revenge, even if he gets arrested in the process. Even Phantom Blot knows better than angering Pete, and either tries to make sure their paths don't cross or will give him a fair deal and keep his word.

    Fan Works

    Films — Live-Action 

-   An anti-hero example comes from the Steven Seagal film _Above the Law (1988)_. After being informed that he's now number four on the FBI's Most Wanted list, Nico quips that he wanted to be number one.
-   In _Casino_ Nicky Santoro cannot help but respect someone he is torturing for information as they just won't break. For 2 whole days they lay into him, even going as far as sticking ice picks in his balls and he hasn't spilled the beans. It takes getting his eye popped out of his head by crushing his skull in with a vise to finally get him to say anything. As Nicky puts it in his monologue "He was one of the toughest Irishman I ever met"
-   In the third _Riddick_ movie, the mercs are impressed with Riddick's balls when he suddenly appears out in the open, walking toward their camp for a pow-wow. Becomes a Discussed Trope with Riddick to Vaako in the Directors Cut.
    
    **Riddick:** They say you lost your nerve, Vaako, after that big swing and a miss.  
    **Vaako:** Is that what they say?  
    **Riddick:** Now what are you gonna do to get that cred back? What's the big play? Something splashy.
    
-   In _Demolition Man_, the Big Bad Simon Phoenix tries to unfreeze a cryo-prison full of psychotic murderers. When he hears that Jeffrey Dahmer is among the convicts, he joyfully expresses admiration for the guy.
-   _Death Warrant_: The Serial Killer known only as "The Sandman" is a renowned figure in the prison due to his love for killing cops. When he's first brought to the prison, the other cons give him a huge ovation. He has no problem finding allies among them who are willing to follow his orders.
-   _Half Baked_: Parodied when the newly-imprisoned Kenny complains that he's "not getting the respect a cop-killer deserves." While he did technically kill a member of the police force, that member was a _diabetic horse_ that he accidentally killed by feeding it too many sweets.
-   _Daredevil (2003)_: After Daredevil narrowly defeats the Kingpin and then leaves him for the police, Kingpin threatens to tell everyone his secret identity. Daredevil stops him by pointing out his cred will go down the drain once everyone finds out he got beaten by a blind man.
-   _Running Scared (1986)_: Drug lord Julio Gonzalez is left _furious_ by the loss of face that comes from the main character having his Cadillac towed and then chasing him through his building in his underwear as the result of a raid. His way of recovering this lost prestige is to take a woman hostage and force them to toss _their_ pants down the stairway before letting her go in order to publicly humiliate them as well.
-   Discussed in _Training Day_. A trio of Mexican Gangbangers talk about Alonzo Harris: one of them considers Alonzo a "ruthless vato", but their leader Smiley disagrees; "he don't respect nada".

    Literature 

-   _Artemis Fowl_: the second book has two Mafiya goons discussing Artemis Fowl Jr., one grumbling that the kid has an Interpol listing and he doesn't.
    
    Thirteen years old and with an active file? I am thirty-seven, and still no Interpol file.
    
-   In _Interviewing Leather_, the titular villainess describes two different types of crime she commits. To enhance her Villain Cred, she does loud flashy attacks in which she rants, breaks things, terrorizes the citizens, dares the local superheroes to try and stop her, etc. To pay the bills, she leads her henchmen in quiet efficient robberies that draw far less attention (unless something goes wrong).
-   _Dancing Aztecs_:
    -   The reason that unaffiliated criminal Corella claims to be a mafia member is so that his business partners will think he's worthier of respect.
    -   Harlem gang boss Bad Death Jonesburg is practically doing a jig when he captures Frank and Floyd during their search for the statues and believes that they're FBI agents and he's important enough to warrant Federal surveillance, something he wants no time in bragging about to his friends.
-   In _The Supervillainy Saga_, Gary a.k.a. Merciless: The Supervillain without MercyTM is constantly trying to increase his and running into the fact no one takes him seriously. This despite the fact he has a body count three figures long of other supervillains and has killed a number of '90s Anti-Hero types. Amusingly, he's genuinely surprised when villains avert it and assume he's using Obfuscating Stupidity to appear less dangerous than he is. He isn't. He's just an enormous dork.

    Live-Action TV 

-   At the end of _Better Call Saul_, Jimmy ends up getting a life sentence at a max security prison, but is recognized by the prisoners in his bus as "Better Call Saul", with his rep as a lawyer turned lieutenant of a drug empire earning him the admiration of the criminals to the point that they're openly chanting out "Better Call Saul" during the ride with the implication that he'll be decently respected and safe during his stay.
-   A villain of the week on _Bones_ wants to get arrested because he’s a rapper. Brennan had trouble understanding the idea of “street cred”, which is basically this trope.
-   A consistent element through _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ and _Angel_. The Watcher's Council records the exploits of demons and vampires, and the underworld community in general seems to have pretty good word of mouth. Angelus had particularly good cred, something Angel occasionally traded off of. Even the Master held Angelus in high regard, intending to appoint him as The Dragon. The Mayor was keen to have Angelus on his team, as well. At one point Darla and Drusilla managed to attract a group of demons to serve them simply by introducing themselves (and de-earing one person who'd never heard of them). Spike had a particularly good reputation for having killed two slayers despite being barely two hundred — or 126, or a vampire for 120 years. Several enemies come to town specifically because killing a Slayer would be good for their reputation. Wolfram & Hart is another example. Even Sahjhan is familiar with the firm's reputation, being as it exists in other dimensions, as well.
    
    **Nostoyev:** Used to be quite the terror back in the day. Haven't heard much of you lately, though.  
    **Angel:** Haven't heard much of you, _ever_.
    
-   In the _Masters of Horror_ episode "Pick Me Up", two rival serial killers called Walker and Wheeler pick off the passengers of a bus crew that they come across in the northwest. They both despise each other for their respective kill steals and treading on the other's "territory", but are also quite impressed by the other's ingenuity and brutality. Walker in particular prizes Wheeler on decapitating one of his victims with a baggage compartment door.
-   The _Blake's 7_ episode "City at the Edge of the World" features Colin Baker as Villain of the Week Bayban the Butcher, a homicidal psychopath who is the **second** most wanted man in the Federation and is upset that, as he sees it, some johnny-come-lately SJW revolutionary has "stolen" his rightful position.
-   In one episode of _Even Stevens_, a prankster from another school who looks identical to Louis starts causing trouble, and Louis ends up getting blamed for it. However he's less upset about getting in trouble than the fact that he is being credited with the lookalike's amateurish and unimpressive pranks, thus ruining his reputation as a master prankster himself.
-   One episode of _Limitless_ has a mobster be talked into betraying his boss in exchange for the promise that he'll get to take his boss's place on the FBI's ten most wanted fugitives list. Brian's explanation for this is that the mob the two men belong too is becoming obsolete and that its members want that level of infamy in order to feel relevant before the end.
-   _Gotham_:
    -   Jim Gordon drags Professor Pyg by bringing up notorious villains such as Jerome Valeska, Fish Mooney, and Oswald Cobblepot, and their "staying power" in the minds of the citizens of Gotham. Compared to them, Gordon says, Pyg is nothing but a flash-in-the-pan second-rate wannabe.
    -   By the series finale, Jeremiah Valeska has earned this, with The Riddler flat-out calling him "a legend" and the entire GCPD being terrified of his return.
-   _Firefly_: Crime boss and Torture Technician Adelai Niska puts immense value on his professional reputation as The Dreaded as well as a man of his word. Mal and the crew refusing to complete a job he gave them and even sending back the money he gave in advance is seen as an _insult_ from his perspective (the fact they also diced his current right-hand henchman doesn't help matters either).
-   _CSI: NY_: "Manhattan Manhunt." A murderer Horatio Caine follows to NYC from Miami is arrested. In lock-up, he realizes he's sitting next to a notorious serial killer. Looking at him admirably, he gushes:
    
    **Rosetti:** Henry Darius! I saw you in the paper, you killed those nurses! I killed someone once.
    
    **Darius:** Oh yeah? Tell me about it.
    

    Tabletop Games 

-   Games Workshop games:
    -   _Black Crusade_: The Infamy characteristic, which is central to some of the game mechanics, is a combination of reputation among other humans and the favor of the Gods. While you can spend XP to get higher Infamy until you hit lower-midlevel (representing player characters leveraging their actions towards their reputation), Infamy is mostly rewarded by achieving something tangible, which increases your reputation and unholy favor. Optional rules state that if a character becomes too dependent on another with a higher Infamy score to get equipment or favors, he may risk lowering his own Infamy, with a lack of self-reliance being a sign of being an underling rather than a peer. Similarly, particularly Infamous characters can "overawe" less Infamous characters and keep them in their place (i.e., not trying to embarrass, coerce, or otherwise manipulate the more Infamous character).
    -   _Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay_: _The Old World Bestiary_ contains descriptions of major intelligent races and monsters found in the setting, accompanied by quotes from a variety of scholars, people with first-hand experience of them, and the beings themselves when they're intelligent. One recurring commentator is Rikkit'tik, a scholar from Clan Eshin, the Skaven clan specialized in assassinations, poisoning and general subterfuge. Most of his comments are terse instructions on how to dispatch the creature in question, but in the section on hobgoblins, a goblin breed notable for being a pack of treacherous, conniving sneaks who like to win their battles with poisoned knives in the dark, he says "I kind of like these green-things. They show... promise."
-   _Heroes Unlimited_: This is a cultural expectation in Century Station. Supervillains are supposed to engage in big, flashy scores and fight superheroes; those who engage in more Pragmatic Villainy like liquor-store robberies are called "lowballers" and shunned by other villains.

    Video Games 

-   In the _Evil Genius_ game, this is your genius' Notoriety, which increases as you successfully complete Acts of Infamy. It also riles up the good guys something fierce, so you have to strike a balancing act.
-   If your karma rating is 'very evil' in _Fallout 3_, other evil characters will make impressed comments, give you supplies and caps to appease you, and give you special quest and dialogue options.
-   In _Fallout: New Vegas_ if you've done a lot of actions to deliberately oppose the NCR and aid the Legion, when you finally meet Caesar by accepting his invitation to the fort he'll list out all of your actions beneficial to him and talk about how you've definitely earned his respect. In contrast, if you've done a lot of actions hindering the Legion he'll angrily list out all of your sins before threatening you but is still willing to try and win you over to his side.
-   In the videogame adaptation of _The Godfather_, you get "respect" points that make you more powerful. Acts that earn you respect range from helping shopkeepers and bribing police officers to murdering enemy gangsters and blowing up their safehouses.
-   In the first two _Saints Row_ games, Respect is earned by completing side jobs and spent to access story missions. Since _Saints Row: The Third_, it's become straightforward experience, unlocking access to character and gang upgrades.
-   The _Overlord_ series: Not only are you explicitly a villain, but you get ranked on how evil you are via Karma Meter.
-   _Liberal Crime Squad_ has Juice, which represents your street cred as a member of La Résistance and goes up as you slaughter hordes of soldiers, cops, and workers who refuse to join labor unions.
    -   Forget killing people, pulling feats such as hacking the CIA Supercomputer, being the lawyer who gets him a Not Guilty verdict on the charge of Treason he/she/xe got in the act, (or doing both) is both less risky and gives more street cred.
-   _Batman: Arkham Knight_: Once you apprehend Professor Pyg and bring him in to the GCPD, the Joker watches him in his cell with a kind of admiration:
    
    Now old pig-face here? Total lunatic! Far too good for this place. Don't worry! You'll be the first one I let out!
    
-   Occurs in _City of Villains_, as the basic currency Infamy (corresponding to the heroic currency Influence and the Praetorian currency Information). You can even give it to other people, because you're increasing their reputation at the cost of your own due to "selling out."
    -   There was also a Villain tip mission that was explicitly about discovering that you were only number two on Nemesis' Threat List, and taking the fight to Nemesis just to be moved up to number one. (Shock Treatment, number three on that list, joins you in order to be raised up to number two)
-   Demons from the _Disgaea_ series tend to be rather concerned about their reputation for "evilness," but most of them aren't very good at it beyond things like not washing their hands or cutting class. This is probably for the best, since demons who are good at bad (e.g. Baal, Zenon, Void Dark, and The God of Destruction) are kind of scary.
-   _Quantum Protocol_: After the Aegis dungeon, Omega criticizes Corrupt Corporate Executive Victor for skimping on security camera costs, to which Victor responds that he needed to spend money on other hardware. Victor states that he'll only bother upgrading the cameras after Omega increases his funding. Despite being on the losing end of this deal, Omega compliments Victor for manipulating the former into giving the latter more money.

    Web Original 

-   In _Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog_, Dr. Horrible's primary goal through Act I and Act II is to earn enough cred to get into the Evil League of Evil. He eventually succeeds...but at a _horrible_ price.
-   Discussed in Worm as a sort of metaphorical 'shield'; after all, if you're _just that terrifying_ nobody will start a fight in the first place, essentially giving you a free victory. Grue is the one who first talks about this, but it's eventually embraced by Skitter.
    -   One fan theory as to Sleeper's power is that it simply makes everyone _perceive_ him as an enourmous threat without actually giving him any dangerous abilities. His power never actually gets revealed, because _everyone is too terrified of him to try and mess with him_. This was jossed by the author: Sleeper is every bit as powerful and dangerous as his reputation suggests.

    Western Animation 

-   _Kim Possible_:
    -   Kim learns that her Evil Counterpart Shego used to be part of a superhero team, and uses that to blackmail her into helping her defeat this week's villain:
        
        **Kim**: Because if you don't help, I'll tell the the world you used to be a good guy.  
        **Shego**: You wouldn't!  
        **Kim**: I've got a website, and I'm not afraid to use it.  
        **Shego**: Ugh, my evil reputation would be _shot!_
        
    -   One recurring gag is that Dr. Drakken's Villain Cred is so weak that people haven't heard of him — worse, they sometimes mistake him for Professor Dementor.
-   _Phineas and Ferb_: After much evil perpetrated around the Tri-State Area, Dr. Doofenschmirtz rescues one kitten from a tree, and risks the complete loss of his evil-genius status.
    -   His worst Christmas is also his _best_ because it was the first Christmas bad enough to make him hate the holiday. Before that he was unable to summon up more than a passionate, burning indifference — not enough motivation to try to ruin it, as a good villain should.
-   One _Darkwing Duck_ episode is all about Nega Duck learning he lost his Public Enemy #1 spot to Dr. Slug. This prompts him to start a massive crime spree to reclaim his throne.
-   In one episode of _The Powerpuff Girls (1998)_, a Monster of the Week claims that many of the monsters who attack Townsville go there just for a chance to fight the girls, because it's a good way to build up villain cred.
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_: The episode "Jailbreak!" reveals that every criminal in Bikini Bottom looks up to Plankton; they outright describe him as "criminal royalty."
-   _Young Justice (2010)_: Sportsmaster is obsessed with this, to the point that he's willing to betray his former bosses and ally with his hated daughter just to restore it because Aqualad killed his heroine daughter Artemis without him being involved. When it turns out she's alive and it was all a trick to help Aqualad in his deep cover mission, Sportsmaster accepts the cred loss to help keep their cover, because their success would be an even bigger blow to the Light than anything he could do by himself.
-   The _Batman: The Animated Series_ episode "The Man Who Killed Batman" provides us with one-time character Sid 'The Squid', a small time crook who wished to gain some cred as a big shot... And succeeded when he got in a scuffle with Batman and, completely by accident, _apparently killed him_. Then it's deconstructed. As the real life saying goes, "when you're king of the hill, everyone else wants to knock you off". First, he becomes a target for another crook looking to earn cred for himself by taking down the guy who killed Batman. Then, he's kidnapped by The Joker, who tries to kill Sid for depriving him of the chance to kill Batman himself. Finally, he goes to Rupert Thorne for help in getting away from Gotham, but after Sid tells his story Thorne decides that there's no way Sid can be telling the truth, as surely nobody could survive such dangers through sheer dumb luck, so Thorne comes to the conclusion that Sid must be putting on an act as part of an attempt to take over Thorne's drug racket. After all, if someone is tough enough bring down _the Caped Crusader himself_ then why wouldn't Thorne see him as a rival? Of course, Batman was alive after all, letting people think he was dead and keeping Sid alive through these misadventures in order to follow him and find out who was running the crime ring. In the end, Sid _did_ get some prison cred as the man who _nearly_ killed Batman and then proceeded to make fools of the Joker and Thorne.
-   _Wander over Yonder_ has the Galactic Villain Leaderboard, which ranks who are considered the most powerful, evil, and important villains in the galaxy. Lord Hater originally had the top slot, but lost it thanks to Wander, though his position fluctuates throughout the series and he eventually does make it back to the top five. When Lord Dominator shows up, she very quickly skyrockets to the top and remains there until the series finale.
-   _DuckTales (2017)_:
    -   Duckburg's villains generally have a "live and let live" policy of not rubbing shoulders with each other. However, there is one villain who they respect above all else: Magica de Spell. Despite being inactive for 15 years before the show, and then only doing one big public display/battle afterwards, a majority of the Legion of Doom consider her Scrooge's greatest nemesis for her evilness, powers, and composure. Glomgold is the one exception since he wants to be seen as Scrooge's #1 enemy.
    -   In "The Last Adventure!", Bradford Buzzard betrays his ally, the Card-Carrying Villain Black Heron, and has her wiped from existence. Rather than be mad about this turn of events, Heron spends her last moments commending Bradford on this act of villainy.
-   _Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero_: Rippen is a Punch-Clock Villain who hopes to one day gain enough Villain Cred to not only make it a full-time job, but finally gain the respect of his family, who are incredibly successful criminals themselves. However, since he doesn't have a single win to his name and his sidekick is a Minion with an F in Evil, accomplishing this is easier said than done.
