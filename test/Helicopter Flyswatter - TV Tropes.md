A classic move for the giant-monster genre, from King Kong to Clover, this is when a gigantic creature or similar menace lashes out and destroys a helicopter or other low-flying aircraft. The aircraft might be attacking the monster, circling too close to capture footage of the creature (news crews, beware this trope!), or simply passing by and/or trying to get the hell away from it. One of the many hazards of being an Acrophobic Bird, and a standard tactic for filmmakers to justify a monster _not_ simply being blown away by an air-to-ground missile. Of course if the threat is groundbased, and the pilots would logically know it possessed no ranged weaponry, this may be a case of Too Dumb to Live.

Often overlaps with Hellish Copter. Bonus points if we see someone reporting from the helicopter as it gets swatted, making it Deadline News as well.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _End of Evangelion_, Asuka drop-kicks a VTOL craft using Unit-02.

    Board Games 

-   The board game _The Creature That Ate Sheboygan_, which simulates an Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever, includes rules for having the monster destroy helicopters that fly too close.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Attack of the 50-Ft. Half-Klingon_, the giant B'Elanna Torres is introduced striding across a Zee Rust city "swiping at the gyrocopters that buzzed about her like angry gnats". When a giant Tom Paris appears at the end of the fanfic, he's surrounded by a similar swarm of tilt-rotor gunships.

    Film — Animated 

-   In _Batman: Mask of the Phantasm_, Batman does this with small radio-controlled choppers in the old "Gotham of the Future" miniature diorama, which now serves as the Joker's home base.
-   In _Monsters vs. Aliens_, Ginormica does it by accident, while trying to explain how she's not dangerous at all.
    
    **Pilot:** Don't let her get me!  
    **Ginormica:** Sorry.
    

    Film — Live-Action 

-   Near the end of _Cloverfield_, the monster takes down a helicopter full of evacuees the protagonists.
-   Godzilla and his kaiju colleagues do this all the time.
    -   In the 1998 _Godzilla_ movie, the titular 'zilla does this to a helicopter that's tracking him though the city by sneaking up on it from below.
    -   Especially notable in _Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack!_, in which Godzilla THROWS Baragon into a news chopper. What a way to die.
-   _King Kong_: King Kong swats at attacking aircraft at the climax of the movie. He manages to take down three, but unfortunately it's not enough to save him.
-   _Kong: Skull Island_ continues the tradition with actual helicopters, and uses enough of them that Kong not only swats them, but grabs them to toss at _other_ helicopters. The largest, he snatches out of the air and twists apart with both hands.
-   _Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus_ uses the standard version when the octopus swats a fighter plane, and takes it far beyond credibility when the shark _leaps 30,000 feet up to nom an airliner_.
-   _Pacific Rim_ shows the first kaiju doing this to the fighter jets attacking it.

    Literature 

-   The human protagonist of Stephen King's _Battleground_ swats one of the attacking mini-choppers out of the air barehanded (suffering appropriate injuries to his hand), then throws a blanket over the other and stomps on it.
-   The 50-foot Ginger that climbed up the Tower of Art in _Moving Pictures_ tried to play out this trope when two wizards started strafing it from a flying broomstick.

    Music 

-   This is actually in _music_. The intro to _Arockalypse_ by _Lordi_ is a spoken news bulletin about a zombie invasion, including a snippet from a reporter who gets knocked out of the sky by a monster climbing a building.

    Video Games 

-   Can be done in _Crush, Crumble, and Chomp!_, though it's actually somewhat difficult. The helicopter units are fairly good at keeping their distance from the monster, and good at evading the monster's "grab" attack.
-   The _Tyrannosaurus rex_ in _Dino Crisis_ does this to Regina's extraction chopper.
-   Your first kaiju form in _Hakaiou: King of Crusher_ as a Not Zilla have you dealing with military helicopters by swatting them out the air. Of course, that's before you grow wings and gain the ability of flight.
-   The monsters in the Arcade Game _Rampage_ could do this to attacking helicopters.
-   This is possible by many ways and is greatly recommended in _War of the Monsters_, as helicopter gunships are, like those in CCAC, fairly good at evading the player, while at the same time peppering you with their cannons. Fortunately, there are a number of ways to beat them, including by throwing items at them, shooting them with your projectile weapon, close-range special attacks, swatting them, jumping into them, or even grabbing another helicopter and using ITS guns to down the others.
    -   They are especially dangerous in the 4th mission, where you not only have to face helicopters, but also a Mecha-Kong and the mantis Preytor, who exhibits all the traits of the aforementioned choppers.

    Web Comics 

-   _The Adventures of Dr. McNinja_: Hellish Copter vs. Giant Enemy Crab: 0-1 As the Alt Text says: "Helicopters only exist in this comic to get exploded. They serve no other purpose."

    Web Videos 

-   This hamster demonstrates why you shouldn't make your Kaiju-battling aircraft out of hamster treats.
-   Lampshaded by _Yotobi_ during his review of _Megapython vs Gatoroid_: "Since this is an Asylum movie, if you're riding a plane or a chopper, chances are something will try to eat you."

    Western Animation 

-   Parodied in the opening scene of _Beavis And Butthead Do America_.
-   In _Futurama_ episode "Benderama", a Giant human boy is destroying the city. Zapp Brannigan shoots at him from a helicopter but then the Giant grabs the helicopter and uses it to give himself a shave.
-   _Miraculous Ladybug_: In "Stoneheart - Origins, Part 2", Stone Heart swats at the pursuing helicopters as he climbs the Eiffel Tower carrying Mylène.
-   In _The Simpsons_ episode "Thirty Minutes over Tokyo" the plane that the Simpsons are on going home gets attacked by Godzilla.
    
    **Pilot:** Uh, folks, we're experiencing some moderate Godzilla-related turbulence at this time, so I'm going to go ahead and ask you to put your seat belts back on. When we get to 35 thousand feet, he usually does let go, so from there on out, all we have to worry about is Mothra, and, uh, we do have reports he's tied up with Gamera and Rodan at the present time. Thank you very much.
    
-   _Taz-Mania_: In "Taz in Keeweeland", Taz becomes a giant atop a skyscraper, swatting at the Keewee in a biplane.

    Real Life 

-   The Trope Namer is the now-famous tweet joking about using a flyswatter to get rid of an annoying helicopter that was flying around town in the middle of the night. The town was Abbottabad, Pakistan, and the helicopters were carrying Navy SEALS on their way to take down Osama bin Laden. One of them did crash during the raid, but so far there have been no reports that giant monsters were involved.
