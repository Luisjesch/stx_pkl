Clockwise from top left: Phlegmatic, Sanguine, Choleric, and Melancholic.

There are many ways to make a group of people diverse without giving them overly specialized roles within an ensemble. One way is through matching personality types according to an ancient proto-psychological theory. The Four Temperaments (also called the "four humors") was a theory that behavior was caused by concentrations of body fluids — the "humors" of classical medicine: blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm.

A temporary imbalance would create an illness: too much blood caused a fever, too much yellow bile caused a cough, too much black bile caused depression, and too much phlegm caused a cold. A permanent imbalance led to a person having a certain type of intentions, behavior, and personality. Though this has been a theory long-since discredited from a scientific standpoint, the general idea still remains and the theory is still used for personality profiling. An ensemble based on these four humors can make the cast diverse without actually changing the roles of the characters in the story.

One of the interesting factors in the Four Temperaments, is that there is no Leader - any one of them could be The Leader in the piece and defines the approach the team takes to the problem, while in a series the focus can switch back and forth to develop characters separately - see A Day in the Limelight. Rather than meeting through coincidence or brought together in the first episode, these four are more likely to be long-term friends or family from the start. There may be a fifth person hanging around occasionally but they're not really part of the team; they just add flavour or play the part of Mentor Archetype.

Along with a list of characteristics, the four temperaments are:

     Sanguine (blood)

The four temperament system, while interesting, was seen as flawed even back then as some people did not fit with any of the presented humors, so a neutral temperament has been used. Originally derived in modern temperament theory from the once popular FIRO-B psychometric instrument, which included moderate scales. When the temperaments were mapped to it, the traditional Phlegmatic ended up moderate in both "expressive" (classic "extrovert" and "introvert") and "responsive" (classic "people vs task" focus) scales, and the low expressive high responsive area was labeled "**Supine**". While it shares many common elements with the Phlegmatic, the difference is that the Phlegmatic is this way from a lower energy reserve which leads them to take the path of least resistance (to either go with the flow and be agreeable, or to be stubborn and slow), while the Supine has an emotional energy that drives them to be reserved, but wanting of acceptance from others.

In alternative versions of the theory, the Phlegmatic kept in its old place, and the new temperament, here labeled as either "**Leukine**" (after leukocytes to match the body fluids theme) or "**Eclectic**", was considered the moderate one, sharing traits with all of the four temperaments (both "extrovert" and "introvert" and both "people-oriented" and "task-oriented").

In fiction this has been mostly reserved either for the lead character or more commonly for secondary characters (as for Four-Philosophy Ensemble, usually the Conflicted, but can also be Realist or Apathetic).

Historically in plays, there was a whole genre: Comedy of Humors, where the impetus of the story is the sudden banding of these opposing types. This is in contrast to the Comedy of Errors, where the story is driven by the events and situations.

They are similar to the four Personality Blood Types and are sometimes also a Classical Elements Ensemble. In the latter case, this typically overlaps with Elemental Personalities.

See also Cast Calculus for the overarching archetypes in this and differently numbered ensembles. Here is an Image Archive for this trope. Additionally, Pseudolonewolf (of _MARDEK_ fame) has a page that goes into great detail on the four temperaments, here (older version with blends here), Eric B has a page that explains the five temperaments here, and The Other Wiki offers its information here. For another way to split up a group of four, see Four-Philosophy Ensemble. If you want to write such a group, see Write a Four-Temperament Ensemble.

    -   Phlegmatic: Sasha Banks: an emergency room nurse. Professional, good and nice with her patients, wants to help everyone, loyal to her friends.
-   The main cast of _Iron Touch_ has this down to a tee, and almost all four of them are alliterative with their archetype to boot:
    -   Sanguine: Sara, the bold, extroverted leader of the group, jumping at the opportunity to meet other Stand users.
    -   Choleric: Cab, a charismatic Deadpan Snarker with a heart of gold. He’s normally very levelheaded, but badly loses his cool when his buttons are pushed (usually by mentioning fate).
    -   Melancholic: Michelle, a depressive introvert. Though she appears reserved and well put together on the surface, she’s actually insanely paranoid and superstitious about a supposed curse on her Stand.
    -   Phlegmatic: Rumor, an intellectual Vampire Hunter. He functions as the group’s healer and is the first to both accommodate to and be responsive of Michelle’s nervousness and confidence issues. He is also the only one who does not form an Alliterative Name with his temperament archetype.

    -   Phlegmatic: Lekona Lion, a relaxed, pseudo-father figure who loves to kick back with a beer.
    -   Sanguine: Deborah Deer, a bubbly geek fresh out of high school who goes in with a smile and dreams of her one true love.

    -   Melancholic: Kitsune Fox, a timid housewife and mother of one who often doubts herself.
-   _Juxtapose_ has Izuku and his friends in the General Education department forming this kind of ensemble.
    -   Sanguine: Izuku is easy-going, friendly, and optimistic (if awkward). He's by far the most charming and magnetic person in the group who holds the others together.
    -   Choleric: Kensei is excitable and twitchy. He's almost always enthusiastic about everything, whether it's building gadgets or breaking into a room he wants to get into.
    -   Melancholic: Hitoshi is aloof and sarcastic with a biting wit. He often messes with his friends to get a rise out of them and is the most coldly pragmatic of the bunch.
    -   Phlegmatic: Megumi is quiet and a voice of reason in the group. Her Touch Telepathy Quirk makes her The Empath who keeps tabs on everyone to keep their emotions from running over.
-   _Miraculous: The Phoenix Rises_
    -   Melancholic: The brooding and aloof Morgan.
    -   Phlegmatic: The easygoing and chill Max.

    -   Choleric: The rules-obsessed Go-Getter Girl Kiku.

    -   Choleric: Sanakan. The loud, brash Tomboy of the bunch who speaks her mind freely. Always restless and eager to fight.
    -   Phlegmatic: Hugh. Being mute is hardly an impediment to his pleasantness and optimism. In fact, it perfectly complements his elegant yet deadly hunting style.
    -   Sanguine: Lily. One must not equate her relative peacefulness absent from typical sanguines with compliancy. Not only she is the most focused and committed of the group, the fact that she is able to strike up conversations and deescalate tensions highlights her people-oriented nature. She also enjoys teasing Sanakan about her relationship with Hugh.
    -   Eclectic: Soren. He doesn't fit in any of the four temperaments, seeing that he neither possesses the seriousness of a melancholic, the passion of a choleric, the pleasantness of a phlegmatic, nor the sociability of a sanguine. Rather, he is characterised as nervous and lacking in confidence, yet willing to prove himself towards his master, even if it means taking risks.
-   The four main characters of _Seth in the Pokécity_:
    -   Sanguine: May, the generally dorky and sweet girl who loves food, especially ramen.
    -   Choleric: Misty, who is rather short-fused and yells a lot.
    -   Melancholic: Tim Tim, who is also fairly hot-tempered, but usually more rational and logical, with a bit of a snarky streak.
    -   Phlegmatic: Seth himself, the lazy and friendly (until he Took a Level in Jerkass) Extreme Doormat who serves as a Straight Man for Misty.
-   The titular team in _The Simpsons: Team L.A.S.H._:
    -   Sanguine: Hikaru, the optimistic Keet who's friendly to just about anyone.

    -   Melancholic: Simon, the intellectual Teacher's Pet who rarely shows emotion.
    -   Phlegmatic: Anastasia, the level-headed and romantic Proper Lady.

    -   Sanguine: Carlos. The cheeky and outgoing Gadfly.
    -   Phlegmatic: Rosa. The gentle and romantic Ingenue.
        -   Another example in Chapter 7 with the Underdogs plus Vincenzo, with calm and gentle Luca as the Phlegmatic, brash and hot-headed Alberto as the Choleric, upbeat and optimistic Giulia as the Sanguine and brooding and haughty Vincenzo as the Melancholic.

Slaanesh god of passion and lust is sanguine. Tzeentch god of ambition and hope is (ironically) melancholic. Nurgle god of despair and disease is phlegmatic.
