_"Mmmm... my tastebuds just went to Heaven with a side-trip to Paradise!"_

Okay, so Alice likes pie. In fact, it's her Trademark Favorite Food. Thing is, when she eats it, she seems to derive a more-than-culinary pleasure from the experience.

For her, this food is Orgasmically Delicious.

If watching Alice eat said food is sexy, then it overlaps with Erotic Eating. If this food actually boosts the character's performance, then it overlaps with Power-Up Food. If it has this effect on _everybody_, a Supreme Chef probably prepared it. If Bob really likes Alice, he may give her some in hopes that she will return his affection.

May be the result of character's favorite food becoming Flanderized. Could be Justified if the character is starving.

Can also apply to drinks. In that case, it may also cause a Beergasm.

    Advertising 

-   Sonny the Cuckoo does this every time he gets "cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs."
-   A PG Tips Tea ad in which Monkey's attempt to describe "The Taste" quickly turns into a parody of That Scene from _When Harry Met Sally..._.
-   The reformulated Clairol Herbal Essences had endless examples of this.
-   Ladies in Dannon yogurt commercials often look like they are having orgasms.
-   As do the ladies in the 2010-11 York peppermint patty commercials.
-   A controversial (late night) UK TV advert campaign for Haagen-Dazs ice cream had women eating their way through huge tubs and getting more and more blatantly sexualised in their enjoyment of it.
-   Bernadette Peters suggestively fawns over Breyer's desserts in some '90s ads.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the _Ah! My Goddess_ manga, Aoshima loves a good bento _way_ too much. It doesn't help matters for Keiichi that Belldandy (whom Aoshima is always trying to hit on) is a **great** chef, and for Sora (who has a crush on Aoshima) that she's an **awful** chef.
-   Early in _Blattodea_, Setsuna is seen crawling towards Chiyuri with an ecstatic expression and begging for more of something, as if she's fallen to the army ant zombies' sex-based virus again and mirroring the zombie girl seen before in the prologue. Then it turns out she's just crazy about Pocky chocolate sticks she can't find on Thailand and Chiyuri is denying her from having too much of them.
-   _Burn Up! Excess_ opens with a scene like this — we're meant to believe that Rio is engaging in some sort of sexual activity, considering the noises she's making, but then the camera pans out to reveal that she's just _really_ enjoying her ramen.
-   In _Delicious in Dungeon_, some of the faces Marcille makes when she eats border on this. Mostly because she hates the idea of eating monsters and so gets very emotional before she has to do it. Senshi's cooking is just that good.
-   In _Dr. STONE_, when Senku creates a cotton candy machine, the villagers of Ishigami react this way when they taste it for the first time, especially the girls. Somewhat justified given that it's the first time any of them has tried it.
-   Could be said to be Beerus and Whis's shtick in _Dragonball Super_ when eating ANY Earth food. Even things as simple as Cup of Soup and Fish Sausage trigger their O Faces.
-   This happens in _Franken Fran Frantic_ when a young woman who was born with no sense of taste gets to experience the pleasure of tasting food for the first time in her life after Fran cures her (she is implied to climax after her first bite). This being Franken Fran, it does not end well.
-   _Food Wars!_ features elite, young chefs trying to excel at a highly competitive and legendary cooking academy, and reactions to the food feature a multitude of visual gags and puns. Nearly every chapter features this for both genders of all ages (except children because they're too innocent); in fact, Food Porn has never been more accurate and literal. In just the first episode, a character eats food so good, the way they talk sounds like they're trying to hold back an orgasm. Later in the same episode, when a few men take a bite of the same dish, their clothes explode off of their bodies, and they scream in ecstasy.
-   _Gourmet Girl Graffiti_ have this at least _Once an Episode_, because of the local Supreme Chef Ryou.
-   Kurosaki gets orgasmic when eating McDonalds food in _Kemeko Deluxe!_.
-   The anime adaptation of _Monster Musume_ causes Centorea to have this reaction to carrots. In the manga, they're merely her Trademark Favorite Food, but in the anime adaption when she eats one her face freezes, her ears twitch, then there's suddenly an explosion of fireworks while she leaps across the sky.
-   Stocking from _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_ only eats sweets. In "Sex and the Daten City", she's blogging about the "Pudding-gasm" she just had.
-   _Toriko_ has plenty of these moments, being a manga full of Impossibly Delicious Food Porn. Special mention goes to his first taste of Rainbow Fruit.
-   Half of _Yakitate!! Japan_'s comedy comes from Azuma's new bread inventions and the completely insane ways that the rest of the cast reacts to tasting it.
-   _School Rumble_ has an episode where Hanai and Harima offer to cook for the girls on a camping trip. Hanai's dish has them weeping tears of joy as they experience the memories of the boar used in his dish. And Harima's dish, featuring a mitten-crab has them singing in choral harmony.

    Comic Books  

-   Obelix from _Asterix_ has a thing for wild boar.
-   _ClanDestine_: Dominic "Hex" Destine's supersenses make chocolate something between this and I Can't Believe It's Not Heroin!.

    Fan Works 

-   In _The Dragon and the Butterfly_, when Hiccup tries Julieta's cooking for the first time, it's so delicious compared to Berk's Spartan cooking that he breaks down in Tears of Joy.
    
    Hiccup would kill a man for Julieta Madrigal.
    
-   Subverted in _The Next Great Adventure_. After Harry Potter brings one of Sylvanas's Dark Rangers back to life (to prove he can hold up his end of a deal to revive the Forsaken), she bites into an apple and moans happily about how horrible it is. It's just the first time she's eaten _anything_ in years.
-   In _Not In Kansas_, Supergirl often reacts like she's having an orgasm when eating or drinking due to having super taste buds, making things taste far stronger than they do for a normal human.
-   In _Vacation means Chaos_, Xander enjoys Willow's cookies so much that Tony (who's watching) asks if it's too late for him to go gay. At least until he sees Pepper eating some. When it comes to cookies, Willow is a Supreme Chef, and she happened to make everyone's favorites.
-   Serena from _Sailor Moon Abridged_ orgasms while eating creme-filled donuts, and later again while likcing a vanilla ice cream cone.
-   _Flashback (MHA)_:
    -   All Might's reaction to eating an enormous barbeque bacon double cheeseburger topped with onion rings makes Midnight joke that it sounds like he's got a girl servicing him under the table. Justified by the fact that this was the first burger he'd been able to eat in six years, and he'd really missed being able to enjoy fast food.
    -   Eri's reaction to an ice cream sundae is similar, and for pretty much the same reason: depending on which timeline's perspective you look at it from, the last time she had any ice cream was either eight years ago or never. But since her current body is six, her reaction makes everyone else in the room uncomfortable.
-   In _The Redemption of Ron Weasley_ Hermione makes an "orgasm face" when she gets her first taste of wizard chocolate.

    Films — Animation 

-   In _Ratatouille_, Remy's eponymous dish is so delicious that it triggers Anton Ego's childhood memory of his mother serving him the same meal. He becomes a friend and ally of both Remy and Linguini from that moment.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _The Matrix Reloaded_, The Merovingian literally gives a woman an orgasm by sending her a slice of cake that has had its code altered.
-   _District 9_'s Prawns love catfood.
-   _God of Cookery_:
    -   Large amounts of Fan Disservice when a mob boss tries a new delicacy and pictures himself dancing on the beach in the sunset wearing not much and... yeah.
    -   Also later when the cooking contest judge tastes Sorrowful Rice. Complete with an Imagine Spot of her rolling around on a chunk of BBQ pork.
-   In _Beerfest_, this is the reaction to the first batch of Schnitzengiggle beer.
-   This _isn't_ what's actually going on in _When Harry Met Sally..._, but it deserves mention here anyway since at least one person in-universe _thinks_ it is. What's actually going on is that Sally is proving to Harry that she can convincingly fake an orgasm. While they're eating lunch in a diner. As Sally is winding down, a woman (played by director Rob Reiner's Real Life mother) says to a waitress "I'll have what she's having."

    Literature 

-   _Animorphs_: Aximili is an alien who in his natural form is a mouthless herbivore and absorbs nutrients through his hooves. Whenever Ax morphs into a human, _any food_ completely overwhelms him, especially cinnamon buns!
-   _Beware of Chicken_: Due to being saturated with qi and making use of knowledge from Earth, Jin's cooking often gets a reaction like this, but especially from Xiulan, whose moaning becomes a bit uncomfortable for her friends at times. Bowu in particular notes that he had "heard purer noises coming from a brothel". Xiulan's father is shown to have similar though less extreme reactions.
-   _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_'s Arthur Dent really likes a good cup of tea.
-   _Discworld_: Rincewind and potatoes. After spending some time on a desert island he got his appetites a bit mixed up, so that when a trio of breathtaking Amazons showed up looking for a man to help continue their tribe, his response was "can I get them mashed?" A footnote explains that after he returned to civilization, Rincewind's therapy involved a beautiful woman, a plate of spuds, and a board with a nail in it.
-   In Stephen King's novel _Cujo_, a character in a commercial bites into a cookie and "his expression suggests that he is experiencing the gastronomic equivalent of a boy's first orgasm."
-   _Tairen Soul_: The stimulant keflee has this effect on Ellysetta and Queen Annoura, especially when combined with pinelle. On one occasion Ellysetta's latent magic is triggered by a particularly strong dose, and everyone in the room is forced to feel exactly what she is feeling.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Firefly_: In the pilot episode, Shepherd Book 'pays' for his passage on _Serenity_ by handing Kaylee a mysterious box. When she opens it, she breathes 'Oh, grandpa' and lets him on board. Later, she sneaks into the galley and opens the box, revealing a big, delicious strawberry. The camera shows a close-up of her face as she eats it slowly, closing her eyes in ecstasy. It's the first clue in the show that fresh fruit is very rare for people who spend most of their time on ships and is therefore a very valuable, desired commodity. Strawberries also happen to be Kaylee's favourite fruit.
-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_'s Troi and chocolate.
-   _Star Trek: Voyager_'s Janeway and coffee?
    -   Also, The Doctor (when Sharing a Body with Seven) and cheesecake.
-   Joey of _Friends_ got this way about a specific meatball sandwich he rarely got to eat, and Ross also got this way regarding the post-Thanksgiving turkey-sandwiches his sister would make him.
-   _30 Rock_ had the sandwiches that the Teamsters brought in only once a year.
-   _Red Dwarf_'s Lister's relationship with curry is intense enough to qualify.
-   _Food Network_: The hosts tend to treat their creations this way.
-   There was an episode of _How I Met Your Mother_ revolving around finding a shop that sold hamburgers which provoked this reaction.
    
    **Barney:** That was so good I want to sew my ass shut.  
    **Lily:** I think I'm having my first burg-ask.
    
-   _Fridays_: A sketch had cavemen (and cavewomen) having orgasms because of a batch of freshly baked muffins.
-   _Seinfeld_: George ties food to his love life. While he initially has success with strawberries and chocolate sauce, his girlfriend balks at a pastrami sandwich on rye with mustard. George surreptitiously does this anyway, but later gets caught trying to go for the trifecta of combining food, sex, and watching TV, and she breaks up with him. Later at the coffee shop, George discovers that by trying to combine food and sex, the two have become associated with each other in his mind, so his sense of hunger and his sexual urges have merged into one "disgusting, uncontrollable urge." This proves to be a problem for him... at least, until he hooks up with a woman who has the same problem.
    
    **George:** You gonna eat that?  
    **Jerry**: No, but please tell me that's all _you're_ gonna do with it.
    
-   In _Community_ Shirley says her brownies are this.
-   _Samurai Gourmet_: There's barely even a hint of true eroticism in the show, to its credit. Nevertheless, after all the Food Porn, Kasumi enjoys the _fuck_ out of at least one dish in every episode.
-   _The Exes_ Stewart's breakfasts apparently give Haskell these although sometimes he fakes it.
-   The BBC series _Chef! (1993)_ has characters frequently respond as though they were on the verge of orgasm after sampling Chef Gareth Blackstock's cuisine. Of notable example is the episode "The Big Cheese", where Gareth has perfected his salmon mousse. It starts when his wife, Janice, tries to throw it at him in a fit of pique, acting as if it were a pate. As she licks a bit off of her fingers, she goes from pissed off to foodgasm in two seconds. Later, Gareth has his staff sample it, and maitre'd Lola sneaks a sample, at which point she is clearly having an orgasmic reaction. Lucinda, the sous chef, cheekily asks, "Shall I ask if she liked it at all?"

     Radio

    Video Games 

-   _Dave the Diver_; when a VIP eats their requested dish, the cutscene that plays afterwards shows them having what can best be described as a religious experience.
-   _Disgaea_:
    -   _Disgaea Infinite_: When Laharl gets his hands on Super Rare Pudding in , he expresses its deliciousness with _extreme_ delight and even has a hallucination of himself walking on a road of puddings in space! He had been starving himself all day long to fully enjoy the pudding.
        
        **Laharl:** Mmhh, mmhh, mmhh, it's _super delicious_. This. Is. Sooooo. Goooooood.
        
    -   The very first scene of _Disgaea 4_ is of Valvatorez eating a sardine. It does not sound like he is eating a sardine.
        
        **Valvatorez:** What a splendid taste... The extract of life overflows and _fills_ my body... I can _feel_ its power. _Ah_, the _waves_ of _ecstasy_... How magical... are these _insignificant creatures known as sardines!_

    -   Aiko (Ms. Yumi), the Hot Teacher of the cast, sometimes gets this reaction when given food she likes.
    -   The way Beli says one of her lines when given junk food has strong hints of this.
        
        **Beli**: I know I shouldn't, but it's soooooo gooooood.
        
    -   Kyu, unsurprisingly, is incredibly unsubtle when given food she likes. Gems include saying she's going to "bust a nut," and that if the food were a woman, she'd fuck her brains out.
-   Android 21 from _Dragon Ball FighterZ_ reacts like this whenever she eats someone after turning them into candy, particularly if they have a high power level. One noteworthy example happens after she devours Frieza.
    
    **Android 21:** OOH! That's DELICIOUS! Clones just can't beat the real deal! Go organic! So fresh and flavorful. This is the best I've had yet!
    
-   In _Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online_, Purple Heart has this reaction when Neptune<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  gave her pudding, with accompanied CG.
-   Cardinal Barbarella in _Resonance of Fate_ simply _adores_ good food, and her entire chapter is devoted to braving deadly monsters and freezing ruins in order to pick up an old bottle of wine.

Re:Dive_, she can be seen swaying with hearts in her eyes (and mouth) and a drawn-out statement about how delicious her rice ball is after taking one bite. She is a major foodie, who can eat massive amounts, though, so it's completely in character for her

    Webcomics 

-   In _The Order of the Stick_, Durkon's connoisseurship of beer rises to a level akin to matrimony.
-   Tang (of _Tang's Weekly Comic_) uses this as a gag to illustrate how you get across abstract concepts like deliciousness in a drawn medium—the character takes a bite out of a cake, and then proceeds to get a little too excited about it.
-   In _Muertitos_, Jesus really loves those donuts - rather embarrassingly to the protestors who had just been preaching about desserts being sinful. A few pages later, Kaori gets familiar with cake.
-   Variant in _Girl Genius_, where the coffee machine Agatha builds produces coffee so good it produces a sort of ersatz religious experience. It causes Vanamonde von Mekkan to go temporarily, if harmlessly, insane and rhapsodise about the perfection of whatever just passed his line of sight. It also proves capable of stopping a murderous Jaeger Super-Soldier in his tracks.
    
    **Agatha:** (flinging a pot of coffee in Vole's face) No!  
    **Vole:** Dem hyu! Now I vill not just keel hyu - now I keel _efferyvun!_...Hey. Dot is verra good coffee.  
    _Agatha belts him over the head with a wrench_  
    **Vole:** Vit a nice kick!
    

    Web Original 

-   Phase in the _Whateley Universe_ routinely gets teased by his friends for his 'foodgasms'. (The background being a little deal he has with the school chefs; they get a rare opportunity to really show off what they can do and the benefits of being on the good side of one of the richest kids at school and he doesn't have to ruin his refined palate by settling for the standard cafeteria stuff.) Even those friends, though, have to admit that his 'special' treats _are_ frequently just that good.
-   The _SCP Foundation_ takes this literally with orgasm muffins.
-   In _Space Beasts_, Author Avatar Marzipan Cheshire gets extremely excited while eating a hamburger. Guess what the Author's Trademark Favorite Food is.
-   In Maven of the Eventide's crossover with The Nostalgia Critic, they spend a few minutes eating cereal. Guess who the camera focuses on looking like they've received a blowjob? And no, it's not her.
-   When Daily Grace tries In-N-Out Burger. The entire thing is one big Cluster Bleep-Bomb.
-   _Phillip's CD-i depiction of Super Mario_ in numerous YouTube Poops has a vicious lust for toast.

    Western Animation 

-   _The Simpsons_: Homer often has this reaction towards donuts, complete with drooling at the mouth.
-   There's a Hanna-Barbera dog called Snuffles who gets orgasmically happy when fed dog biscuits. To the point of floating up in the air, wafting to the ground, and sighing, "Aaahh." "Floating" is not as apt a description as "launching". Like a rocket. Also, just in case his human companions had any doubts as to what Snooper wanted, he'd cue them in by opening his mouth, pointing into it, and saying "Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!"
-   From _Family Guy_:
    
    **Chris:** Here Stewie, have a Fig Newton.  
    (Stewie eats the cookie.)  
    **Stewie (while chewing):** I say, I must use him for-oh my god, it's like an orgy in my mouth!
    
    -   Also, the episode where Stewie got hooked on pancakes.
    
    **Stewie:** What's this? Blueberries! Oh, oh my G ... oh, that's _better than sex!_
    
    -   Stewie thinks sex is a type of cake.
-   The Powerpuff Girls first taste of hard candy causes them to "oh" and "ah" in a slightly sensual manner, then float in the air while giggling, then float back to the ground with their eyes half closed. If that doesn't sound orgasmic enough, Bubbles ends the sensation with, "that... was... amazing." Similar enough to Snuffles's reaction to dog biscuits to probably be a deliberate Shout-Out.
-   _A Pup Named Scooby-Doo_: Happened whenever Scooby and/or Shaggy ate a Scooby Snack. The snacks were so good, they'd make the duo weak at the knees and instantly faint into bliss. Scooby's reaction — complete with orgasmic self-hugging — to the Snacks was an obvious Shout-Out to Snuffles, though Scooby would often launch like a rocket rather than float upward. In one episode, he carries the Snuffles homage even further by pointing to his open mouth.
-   Papa Smurf's response to trying smurf cream for the first time is nothing but "mmmm mmmm"s in _The Smurfs (1981)_ episode "The Smurfwalk Cafe".
-   In a Pensieve Flashback in the _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ episode "Princess Twilight Sparkle, Part 2", Discord eats some of his Plunder Seeds while he purposely allows some of them to spill out.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  He moans and shudders at how good they taste.
-   Marlene imitated this in _The Penguins of Madagascar_ when thinking about her favorite food. Private covered Rico eyes for decency during this.
-   Monterey Jack of _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers_ goes into a crazed trance whenever he smells or sees cheese (similar to Sonny and Cocoa Puffs mentioned above).
-   In _The Amazing World of Gumball_, Mr. Small deprives himself of meat in order to be a Straw Vegetarian. When he gets a taste of pork knuckle in "The Castle", he practically makes out with the thing as he eats it. Later on in "The Potato", he goes full animal on some sausages and steaks, though this time he's much more embarrassed about it, begging the nearby Gumball and Sarah "Don't Look At Me!".
