(Yawn) We sure did a lot. We made some new friends, went to that new amusement park, fought the Big Bad and won, we laughed together, we cried together, and learned a whole lot about ourselves. Boy, are we tired. So how are we going to end this story / episode / season / series / movie?

Well, there is one way. Let's put on our jammies and hit the sack.

This trope can happen even when the situation is not happening at night. A common ending in some children's books and shows, where they end the story with the characters going to bed.

Always a perfect ending for an Insomnia Episode, a "Getting Ready for Bed" Plot, or one when it was All Just a Dream (as long as they end it by going back to sleep). Could even include Sleep Cute.

## As this is an Ending Trope, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Exaggerated in episode 11 of _Akahori Gedou Hour Lovege_. The first part, _Zettai Seigi Love Pheromone_, took a considerable amount of time; leaving less than a minute remaining for the second part, _Soreyuke! Gedou Otome Tai_, before the end credits. So what do the characters do in that part in the short amount of time, _take a nap!_
-   _Azumanga Daioh_:
    -   Episode 12 ends with Chiyo Chan going to bed. Which is fitting because the whole episode involves her going about her school day, beginning with her waking up.
    -   After Mayaa reunites with Sakaki in episode 24, Chiyo Chan lets the two sleep over for the night at her house.
-   _Dropkick on My Devil_: In Season 2 Episode 5, Jashin gives Medusa a ninja costume for her birthday. After the end credits, we see Medusa asleep in her bed dreaming of her and Jashin playing in color coordinated ninja costumes.
-   _Gabriel DropOut_: At the end of the Beach Episode, Gab and her friends fall asleep on the train ride home.
-   _Interstella 5555_: At the end of "Too Long", the story is revealed to have been in the imagination of a kid who fell asleep while playing with his action figures and listening to a Daft Punk record. His mother tucks him in, kisses him goodnight, and turns off the record player.
-   _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid_:
    -   Subverted in chapter 22. After working things out with their neighbors so they won't be so loud, Kobayashi, Tohru, and Kanna decide to lay down and take a nap. It would have been peaceful if Tohru didn't grind her teeth as she slept. Poor Kobayashi.
    -   Played straight in episode 1 of the anime, where Kobayashi and Tohru lie down for the night (though Tohru does have a short Flashback Nightmare).
    -   The ending credits for season also ends with Tohru, Kanna, Elma, and Lucoa going to sleep (notably, none of their pajamas match up with what they wear in series).
-   Happens at the Grand Finale of the _Mitsuboshi Colors_ anime. During the final skit in the episode (after the credits roll), the gang brings a futon and set it in the middle of the park in order to relax and do surveillance. In the end though, they end up falling asleep.
-   _Mysteria Friends_: The second part of episode 4 ends with Anne going to bed.
-   The New Game! OVA ends this way with the gang sleeping in separate futons in the same room during their company trip.
-   _Pretty Cure_
    -   The last scene of episode 39 of _Maho Girls Pretty Cure!_ has Mirai, Riko, and Kotoha all asleep with all of them holding hands while doing so.
    -   When Ruru makes herself part of Hana's family in episode 13 of _HuGtto! Pretty Cure_, she and Hana turn in at the end and end up sharing the same bed.
        -   This happens again at the end of episode 34, this time involving Hana and her sister Kotori.
-   While every episode of _Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle_ has the princess fall asleep at the end, they don't count because there would usually be a bit more afterward from the other demons before each episode officially ends. However, the last part of episode 12 plays this straight; in which after the princess falls asleep (with a bunch of other teddy demons), the camera pans out to the outside of the castle with the narrator wishing her sweet dreams before the episode ends.
-   All the horse girls lie down and rest after doing all the random fun activities during the ending credits of _Uma Musume_.

    Asian Animation 

-   _Doby & Disy_: Each episode of Season 1 uses a framing device of Doby and Disy's mother reading them a bedtime story, so naturally they end with her wishing them a good night before they go to sleep.

    Comic Books 

-   While it doesn't end _Preacher_ in its entirety, the last thing we see the Saint of Killers do is go to sleep. On God's throne, after shooting God in the head. He can't be redeemed, and he can't be damned any worse than he already is, but he can rest. So he does.

    -   A lot of Game Over screens in the Kirby games have the titular character appear sleeping; always having the hand you use to make your choice with waking him up and running back every time you choose "Continue."

    -   A similar but with a much darker inversion happens in _Porky Pig's Haunted Holiday_, where Porky was planning his vacation (without suspecting the haunted aspect of it) while in bed and then falling asleep and encountering all manners of bizarre and horrific creatures that have plagued his journeys and cartoons.

-   _Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap_ ends with the hero, now back to Hu-man form, going home to sleep.
    
    Good night, brave warrior. Good night, Monster Land...
