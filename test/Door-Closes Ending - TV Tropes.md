Sometimes at the end of a show, right before the Fade to Black, there will be a shot of a door closing, covering the characters from the audience's view. The type of door may vary, it could be anything from a typical front door on a house to the sliding doors of an elevator or the grand gates of some lavish estate.

Why the door is being shown this way at all will also vary.

-   It may be done to tease the audience, if, for example, the last characters seen are a favored pairing in a romantic looking setting and the writers are leaving the audience to ask Did They or Didn't They?.
-   It may be for comedic purposes, where one character has done something which is sure to lead to a Hilarity Ensues moment, but the door closes, leaving the audience to imagine what happens next.
-   It may be for something darker. If the hero has been captured by the Evil Overlord and has been taken to the dungeons to be tortured, but just as he is strapped to the rack, the dungeon door closes, shutting viewers out, and locking him inside along with whatever it is they are about to do to him.
-   Finally, if done at the end of a Grand Finale episode or the last movie of a series, it could be used to invoke the sense that the final curtain has come down.

These are a few examples, but it is by no means limited to them.

May overlap with any of various types of Discretion Shots. Opposite and possible Book End to the Open-Door Opening. A type of Hat-and-Coat Shot. Compare and contrast with Off-into-the-Distance Ending, Ending by Ascending.

## As this is an Ending Trope, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.

    -   The second film ends with Amanda saying "Game over" before closing the bathroom door, leaving Eric to die.
    -   The seventh film ends with Dr. Gordon saying "Game over" before closing the bathroom door, leaving Hoffman to die. Noticing a pattern here?

-   _The Taking of Pelham One Two Three_ subverts this trope by having Mr. Green - the last surviving hijacker, who has been sneezing throughout the whole subway train heist - escort the two cops who were questioning him out of his apartment. Just as he closes the door, he sneezes one last time... cue Walter Matthau (whose character has heard that particular sneeze before) opening the door very slowly and giving Mr.Green the stink-eye.
-   _The Truman Show_ has a variation. The in-universe show ends with a shot of Truman walking up a staircase and through the door that leads out of the studio and into reality. This isn't the last shot of the film, as it's followed by scenes of other characters reacting to the end of the show — but it is the last the real audience, as well as the in-universe audience, sees of Truman. Once he's left the show, Truman gets to live the rest of his life without anyone watching.

-   _Charmed_ did this many times throughout the series, including the series finale.

He walks over to his office and is about to enter when there is a knock at the front door. Sam thinks about answering it, but dismisses it, goes into his office, and closes the door. This is the inverse of the opening scene of the first episode of the series, where Sam emerges from his office and goes through the routine for opening the bar in the morning.
-   Occurs on _Chuck_ at the end of "Chuck vs. the Masquerade" as Vivian reactivates Volkoff Industries.
-   _The Closer_: The last we see of Brenda Leigh Johnson in the Grand Finale is her eating one of her long-missed chocolates as the elevator doors close.
-   Inverted after the final battle of _The Defenders (2017)_. As the Defenders file into the room where their friends are waiting to embrace them, Foggy Nelson and Karen Page are left staring at the open door, waiting for Matt Murdock to enter as well. He doesn't.
-   _Friends_: The last shot of the series pans arounds Monica's empty apartment, past the six keys belonging to the characters and fades out on the purple door and iconic gold frame that is the Friends motif to millions. Definitely representing the final curtain coming down as the gang have left Monica's for the last time and are moving on to a new era in their lives.

-   _Mad Men_ does this numerous times, finally deliberately averting it in "The Suitcase."

-   _The Nightmare Room_ does this twice every episode: once before the commercial break and once at the end.
-   _Scrubs_ 1x15, "Bed, Banter, and Beyond" deconstructed Will They or Won't They?, showing JD and Elliot's first day together as well as the ensuing weeks and their break-up. The episode ended on the door of JD's apartment closing on the Dramatic Irony of JD and Elliot promising each other the relationship won't proceed down the path we just saw it follow.
-   _Seinfeld_ did as well, when Jerry and Elaine are dumped as prospective godparents for a couple's child, who choose Kramer. They go across the hall to talk to him, and shut the door _exactly_ (with the Fade to Black) as was done in _The Godfather_.

-   _Warehouse13_ has shots before some commercial breaks where the final screen shrinks and as if panning back to show the screenshot is inside a crate on a black field, then the top of the crate closes over it with a snap sound effect and then it goes to commercial.
-   An episode of _Without a Trace_ ends like this after an agent sneaks into the Victim of the Week's bathroom in order to steal a bottle of painkillers (he's developed an addiction after being shot).

-   Michael Jackson's song "Thriller" begins (appropriately for a song about classic horror movies) with a creaky door opening, and ends (over Vincent Price's Evil Laugh) with that same door creaking shut and closing.

-   Defeat another faction by force in _Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri_, and you get to see one: the defeated faction leader levitating in a sphere of Electric Torture. Bloodcurdling scream. Blast door with the defeated faction's logo slamming shut, closing off the victim from view mid-scream.
-   _Super Smash Bros._ for the N64 had a variation on this. After defeating Master Hand on Classic, the camera zooms out to reveal the room from the title sequence, followed by the screen going black to the sound of a door shutting. Cue credits.
-   In _Undertale_, choosing to stay with Toriel at the end of the True Pacifist ending results in one of these. If you did a Genocide run at any point beforehand, though, there's one more Reveal Shot before the cut to black.

    Web Comics 

-   _1/0_ ends this way, with a Happy Ending where everyone is Back for the Finale.
