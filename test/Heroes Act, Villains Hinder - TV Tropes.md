When the heart of a story is the hero's strong objective, the story usually isn't a Heroic Fantasy. It's comedy, romance, Slice Of Life, voyages, Rags To Riches... Villains and antagonists that exist are hindrances that challenge the hero to rethink themselves or overcome a personal weakness. If it’s an Action Adventure, then the enemies are Plot Irrelevant Villains who coincidentally meet and antagonise the main character without having anything to do with the cause of the journey itself. Contrast Villains Act, Heroes React.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Most Shoujo comics, being a mix of Slice of Life and romance are about the heroine finding love while becoming a model/mangaka/singer/circus clown and there are a shitload of mean students/coworkers, Alpha Bitches, Jerk Jocks, and rivals keeping her from doing it. Really, you start thinking everyone's out to get you reading these stories.
-   _Code Geass_: Lelouch wants to destroy Britannia and liberate the Japanese, and Britannia fights against him.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   While Dio is very much active in _Phantom Blood_, his role in the plot of _Stardust Crusaders_ is mostly passive; he gets the heroes involved months after obtaining his Stand; The World, which also caused Jotaro's mother Holly to fall ill. After Jotaro and the others set off towards Egypt, Dio sends his minions in their path while waiting in his manor.
    -   _Golden Wind_: In the second half of the part, Giorno and his gang try to find the Boss' identity in order to take control of his empire. Naturally, he sends agents to try and stop them.
    -   The Big Bad of _JoJolion_ has this _enforced_ on him by his stand power. His Stand, Wonder of U, attacks anyone who pursues him with increasing calamities until they stop trying or die, but it doesn't account for his own actions. If he ever acts first, his opponents will be free to retaliate because it isn't really 'pursuit' if he comes to you first, and acting in self-defense isn't pursuit either.
-   _Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans_: The first season has Tekkadan escorting Kudelia Aina Bernstein to Earth so she can rally support for Martian independence, something which leads to Gjallarhorn trying to stop them.
-   _One Piece_ practices both this trope and Villains Act, Heroes React. The story revolves around the Straw Hat Pirates' adventure across the seas, with their ultimate goal being to find the eponymous One Piece treasure. On their way, they stumble onto all sorts of villains with their own objectives. In some arcs, like Alabasta, the villains are trying to enact some evil scheme that the heroes throw a wrench in. In other arcs, like Dressrosa, the heroes are the ones actively disrupting things while the villains are trying to keep themselves in power. The wider context of the story, however, very much plays into Heroes Act, Villains Hinder, as the Straw Hats' actions indirectly cause the setting's entire power structure to get thrown out of whack while the World Government tries desperately to keep them in check.

    Comic Books 

-   Used at times in _Diabolik_: the Villain Protagonist usually has the initiative, but from time to time it's inspector Ginko to come up with a plan to lure Diabolik into an ambush or otherwise foil him or other criminals. Especially notable is the first time this happens, the aptly titled story "Ginko Attacks!", in which Ginko's plan is so sudden and unexpected Diabolik is on the run the entire time and can only watch as Ginko raids his main hideout and discovers a _map to all his other hideouts_ (Diabolik managed to escape and rebuild, but he could never replace the elaborate hideouts taken from Walter Dorian's organization that he lost that day).
-   _Sin City_: In Hartigan and Marv's stories, the main characters respond to crimes that happen off-screen to people they have little connection to. Because they decide to act, this leads them to make more decisions and the plot follows them. Dwight is an even greater example. He starts off reacting to Jackie Boy being the plot driver but he takes over the plot when he decides to chase Jackie Boy into Old Town and from there, his actions led to trouble from different directions. The main villain of that particular story doesn't have a part in the plot until the mid-way point.
-   There was a _Superman_ story arc called _Panic in the Sky!_ which was written specifically to avert Villains Act, Heroes React. Superman and a team of heroes purposefully go after a villain instead of waiting around for the bad guy to act first.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Breath of the Wild_, an adaptation of _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_, this happens in two different ways.
    -   Counting the story arching from 100 years before the Calamity, the heroes were the ones who took the initiative to try and combat Calamity Ganon, using their ancestors' powerful technology to get the job done. Unfortunately, Calamity Ganon was _very good_ at hindering them.
    -   In the present day, though the entire story is a reaction to Calamity Ganon's victory 100 years prior, it still centers more on Link journeying around to gather the resources to fight Calamity Ganon, gathering the help of the various races across Hyrule, and the villainous Yiga Clan's attempts to stop them.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Beauty and the Beast_ would essentially have no central conflict if not for the Beast's overreaction to EVERYTHING- most importantly, throwing Maurice into a dungeon just because the poor guy sheltered from a blizzard in the Beast's castle. Although he is something of antagonist at the start of the movie, from Belle's perspective if nothing else so it's a zigzag.
-   At the start of _Incredibles 2_, superheroism is outlawed and those with superpowers are forced to hide them. So the Parr family and Frozone team up with an eccentric billionaire to restore the supers' public image and make superheroism legal again. The villain, the Screenslaver, appears to be some kind of visionary as well, and makes vague monologues about modern society, but this is ultimately just a distraction. Her real goal is merely to entrench the current status quo, and turn the general public further against supers.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Mad Max: Fury Road_: Furiosa liberating Immortan Joe's harem girls sets off the events of the film.
-   The plot of _Happy Gilmore_ is the titular character entering a golf tournament to earn the money to pay his grandmother’s enormous tax debt so she won’t lose her house. The sadistic orderly at the nursing home exists so Grandma Gilmore has a reason to want Happy to win the tournament, while Shooter McGavin is one of Happy’s many tournament rivals.

    Folklore 

-   Fairy tales where the child has a goal at the beginning, such as Little Red Riding Hood, Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters, Aladdin, etc.

    Literature 

-   _The Odyssey_: Odysseus wants to get home. Every monster and god on the Great Sea is hindering him.
-   _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_: Dorothy wants to get home. The Wicked Witch stalking her for her shoes is hindering her.
-   _Alice in Wonderland_: Alice wants to get home. The sheer craziness of the world she's in is hindering her.
-   Most Romantic and Tragic Comedies are boy and girl wants each other and their jobs, jealous rivals and social statuses are keeping them apart.
-   In the _Firestar Series_, the protagonist is an industrialist who, since she was a teenage girl, has been throwing everything into a space program so that humanity can incinerate any threatening asteroids. Her antagonists are surprisingly sympathetic Luddites, competing business interests, and people who have a grudge against her because of all the control issues she's gotten from decades believing the fate of humanity rests on her shoulders.
-   In _Tower and the Hive - Pegasus in Space_, the main plotline is the development of Peter Reidinger's abilities and the science behind Talent, culminating in the creation of FT&T and humanity's march to the stars. The villains are various people who the Talented have cheesed off in previous books; the only villain whose goals aren't specifically related to destroying Peter is Ludmilla Barchenka.
-   _Theirs Not to Reason Why_ is a rare Action/Adventure example. Technically, Ia _is_ reacting, but the villains she's reacting to won't show up for centuries after her death (she's a precognitive). In practice, she sets out to rearrange the galaxy so that the peoples of it will be ready when the apocalyptic threat arrives, and her plans for this drive the entire plot.
-   This trope is a source of unending frustration for _A Practical Guide to Evil_'s Black Knight because he is stuck in a reactive position. All he can do is stomp out potential heroes soon as his network spots them. Also the reason he wants to "edit" the way Names work, especially since Angels and Demons can only be Order or Chaos respectively, leaving no room for grayer tones.
-   _The Lord of the Rings_ may be one of the most famous subversions, as Frodo sets out to destroy the One Ring and is hindered by Sauron's forces. More specifically, it is a pre-emptive attempt to weaken Sauron before he invades good guy territory (again), so it is still kind-of reaction to a villain's plot.
-   Subverted in _Night Watch (Series)_: The Light Others are fond of social experiments attempting to cure the human condition. Fascism and communism are both explicitly mentioned to be Light social engineering projects Gone Horribly Wrong. However, the Dark doesn't see the need for hindering (much), banking on human nature to screw up any Light interference for them. So far, it seems to have worked for them.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Prisoner (1967)_: Number Six wants to escape The Village. The new Number Two wants to keep him there.
-   _Breaking Bad_ is defined by the attempts of protagonist Walter White to make meth and build a fortune for his family, while the antagonists all threaten that goal. During periods where Walter has (at least temporarily) neutralized all of his antagonists, the show will skip through weeks or months at a time in a single montage as Walter simply goes about his drug manufacturing unhindered. When Walt himself becomes the Big Bad in the back half of Season 5, the story then shifts to the struggle of Hank trying to bring him to justice while Walt hinders his progress.
-   _Kamen Rider_:
    -   _Kamen Rider Decade_ has little in the way of a real antagonist of his own, but rather each of his story arcs is about wandering into someone else's story and becoming an Outside-Context Problem that the villains of that story have to react to.
    -   _Kamen Rider Gaim_ is an exceptionally serialized narrative that brings the Beat Riders into more and more of a proactive role as it progresses and they seek to uncover the mysteries of the Helheim Forest, hindered in their explorations by a myriad of other forces seeking to profit off the crisis.
    -   _Kamen Rider Ghost_ is proactive for the first third of his show, as he tries to find the fifteen Heroic Eyecons he needs to retrieve within 99 days so he can wish himself back to life, which happen to also draw him into conflict with scouts from the Gamma empire. Once he actually has them, this premise takes a backseat to Ghost and his friends reacting to the schemes of the Gamma's main invasion force, comprising the bulk of the rest of the series.
    -   _Kamen Rider Ex-Aid_ takes the opposite route of Ghost, beginning with the doctors at CR reacting to the Bugster virus outbreak and eventually leading to them attempting to follow the necessary steps to win and shut down the Deadly Game _Kamen Rider Chronicle_, with the game's runner doing everything in his power to stop them.
    -   _Kamen Rider Build_ has a very proactive pair of protagonists, with the first arc being about Sento and Ryuga searching for answers as to mysteries of the setting and the villains trying to stop them, to the point where the Monster of the Week formula typical to the _Kamen Rider_ franchise gets almost immediately sidelined.
    -   _Kamen Rider Zi-O_ zigzags, as most of the cast are time travelers proactively trying to stop the title character from becoming the Evil Overlord of their future, but doing so primarily by reacting to the monster attacks meant to spur him along this path.
-   _LazyTown_: Stephanie and Sportacus want the residents of LazyTown to be proactive and healthy. Robbie creates schemes to hinder them.
-   _Super Sentai_:
    -   Most episodes of _GoGo Sentai Boukenger_ invert the franchise norm by beginning with the heroes seeking out a powerful artifact so they can lock it up safely, and the villains trying to stop them so they can claim the artifact for themselves.
    -   _Uchuu Sentai Kyuranger_ is another one where this applies, as it takes place in a Bad Future where the villains have already ruled the universe for generations. Any given episode focuses on the heroes planning to reclaim an important piece of territory or seek out a vital artifact to overthrowing the Jark Matter empire, only to be hindered by whatever local commander happens to be in that area to serve as the Monster of the Week.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   This is pretty common in professional wrestling. A wrestler wants to form a team (Samoa Joe with Jay Lethal) or pursue a title? (Jay Briscoe and the Ring of Honor World Championship belt) Another will act to sabotage, especially if they are going for a title the heel has, wants to have, wants to keep around the waists of their friend or doesn't like anyone of said proposed team(thus Low Ki and Homicide try to end Lethal's career and Rhino gives Briscoe his first injury to protect Kevin Steen). The faces are throwing a party?(Daffney Unger for Nikki Roxx's birthday) Someone uninvited(or only thinks they were uninvited in the case of Mercedes Martinez) is likely to ruin it. Someone is receiving an award?(Kurt Angle into the Impact Wrestling Hall Of Fame) They must be put in their place(thus the Extraordinary Gentlemen Organization forms to protest). Someone is giving out props to the fans(Eugene has a t shirt gun)? Don't be surprised if that is interrupted either(because Armando Alejadro Estrada and his Samoan Bulldozer apparently hate fun). The reasonable authority figure is trying to enact something new in the name of entertainment, safety and or fairness(The Tennessee state commissioner banning the pile driver)? Expect them to be fought every step of the way(Paul Orndorff is piledriving anyone SMW puts him in the ring with, then Al Snow decides it will be a good way to end the career of Ricky Morton).
-   A rather infamous example came from Full Impact Pro, when CM Punk stomped on the head of Homicide while Homicide was watching a strip tease
-   Another CM Punk example came from the Second City Saints vs Prophecy feud when BJ Whitmer interrupted Punk and Colt Cabana's attempted execution of Christopher Daniels. Although given the "heroes" had gone to such extremes in their vigilante justice and Daniels, while accomplice to Whitmer, wasn't actually guilty of the crime he was being punished for, this wasn't quite so bad.
-   EVOLVE had a case where the initial "hero" Mercedes Martinez did not even _need_ to react when Brandi Lauren tried to undo her efforts to bring women into the company. The wrestlers, Shotzi Blackheart in particular, were able to handle themselves, making this look like Villains Act Heroes React if you were unfamiliar with the promotion's history.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Exalted_ gives us the Ebon Dragon, a Yozi who often acts as one of the principal antagonists of the setting. As he represents the cosmic principles of betrayal, villainy, and spite, it's very, _very_ hard for him to act proactively. In fact, most of his powers rely around crushing or spiting others instead of pursuing his own direct goals, and the main reason he created the Unconquered Sun was because that way, he could actually _do something_.

    Video Games 

-   _ANNO: Mutationem_: Ann's main objective is finding her missing brother. Whether it's the Factio Pugni trying to stop her from re-obtaining a stolen ROM or The Consortium getting in her way, Ann will not stop at rescuing Ryan.
-   _Doki Doki Literature Club!_ is about a male high school student who joins a literature club with four other girls, leading him to attempt to romance one of them. Unfortunately, the club president, Monika, intends to bend the world around her so that the player themselves has no choice but to pursue her.
-   _Dragon Age: Origins_: The Grey Wardens (and their newest member, you) need to stop the latest Blight from destroying Ferelden, but Teyrn Loghain (who doesn't believe in Grey Wardens or the Blight), does everything in his power to try to stop you. In this case, the heroes are 'reacting'' to the Blight but a separate, different villain is hindering them.
-   _DuckTales_ has Scrooge seek out five Lost Treasures to further solidify his status as the Richest Duck in the World, fighting enemies along the way.
-   _Life Is Strange 2_: Sean and Daniel's main goal is to make it to Puerto Lobos so they can escape punishment for a crime they didn't commit. The story does not have an arching villain, but the brothers have to deal with several unsavory figures, such as a racist convenience store owner, the leader of a marijuana planting operation, and the insane leader of a cult-like church.
-   _Undertale_: You play as a child who fell underground, and wants to return home. Thing is, everyone and everything underground wants you to stay, or wants you dead.

    Western Animation 

-   _Hurricanes_: In "Around the World in 90 Minutes", the protagonists organize a series of soccer matches to be played at an aircraft carrier. The villains seize the carrier and stop the matches out of spite.
-   _The Owl House_: In Season 3, the plot is driven more by the heroes acting to save the Isles, which has been taken over by The Collector. Belos however, isn't going to let that happen, determined to deny Luz her victory.
