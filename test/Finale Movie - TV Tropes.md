Quite often, a series manages to wrap up the story in an epic fashion by the last episode. However, there are some productions that don't feel content with just concluding the series with a normal episode, so they decide the show should reach its conclusion in a feature-length film.

Contrast Pilot Movie, which is when a feature-length film is intended to serve as the _beginning_ of a television show. Compare Big Damn Movie, Conclusion in Another Medium and Sequel in Another Medium.

Not to be confused with the last movie in a series of movies.

    Anime 

-   The story of _Blood-C_ was concluded with the film _Blood-C: The Last Dark_, which had Saya finally mete out justice against the villain after they had gotten away with their actions.
-   _Free!_ ended its eight year run with the two-part movie _Free! the Final Stroke_, showing Haru and friends as they approach swimming on the world's stage. _Free!_ did have movies before, but most of them were either recaps of previous seasons or one adaptation of the franchise's predecessor novel.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_ had all of its lingering plot threads resolved in _Fullmetal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shamballa_.
-   _Gundam 00: A Wakening of the Trailblazer_ serves as the Grand Finale of _Mobile Suit Gundam 00_, which tells the story of a united humanity's struggle to overcome a new extraterrestrial threat as Aeolia Schenburg's plan moves into its final stage.
-   The _The iDOLM@STER_ 2011 anime closes the book on the 765 cast with _THE iDOLM@STER: To the Other Side of the Light!_, a film that wraps up their character development and and sees them cemented as popular, successful female idols. All appearances they make in the _iM@S_ A-1 Pictures continuity after this movie are just cameos.
-   _The Last: Naruto the Movie_ is supposed to be the final film Studio Pierrot made for _Naruto_, which follows him learning about Hinata's feelings for him and he himself realizing that he loves her back. While he does appear later on in spinoffs and especially in _Boruto_, this movie remains the last one focusing on young Naruto as a central protagonist rather than a side character.
-   _Kiniro Mosaic_ ended with 2021's _Kiniro Mosaic: Thank You!!_ which not only acts as the conclusion to the anime adaptation but the franchise as a whole, as the original manga ended a year before its release.
-   _Love Live!_:
    -   _Love Live! The School Idol Movie_ chronicles the final journey of μ's as they travel to New York and decide if they want to continue being a group with the 3rd years graduating.
    -   _Love Live! The School Idol Movie: Over the Rainbow_ follows Aqours as they travel to Italy to search for the 3rd years and decide if continuing the group without the 3rd years.
-   The conclusion of _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ came in the form of the theatrical movie, _The End of Evangelion_.
-   _Puella Magi Madoka Magica The Movie: Rebellion_ acts as the epilogue to _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_, though the ending is left open-ended in case the creators want to continue. They later would with a direct sequel.
-   _The Quintessential Quintuplets_ movie continues off the second season of the anime, going all the way to the finale.
-   _Shoujo Kageki Revue Starlight_ has its second movie act as the curtains for the main cast. It gives the girls who were sidelined in the television series extra time to shine, resolves each pair's conflicts and characters, and concludes Karen's development after she breaks upon reaching her series-long goal. The movie is also set on the backdrop of the girls graduating from school and is loaded with meta commentary on what the "audience" and their peers expect of each other.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions_ wraps up the story of the original _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ manga while celebrating the franchise's 20th anniversary.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _ALF_: The show itself ended on a cliffhanger in 1990, so in 1996 a movie was made to finally wrap things up.
-   The 2000s version of _Battlestar Galactica_ had two. The Grand Finale, _Daybreak_, ran between 140 to 200 minutes depending on the cut. Although it was divided into three episodes, it is essentially one big movie that wraps the story up. The feature-length interquel, _the Plan_, chronologically took place in Seasons 1 and 2 but it was the last production of the show to air and served as a thematic finale, wrapping up certain elements that were not addressed in _Daybreak_.
-   _CSI_ ended with a movie-length finale called "Immortality".
-   _Deadwood_ was concluded by a film ten years after the final episode.
-   Although the classic incarnation of _Doctor Who_ aired its last television episode in 1989, a movie was made in 1996 in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to revive the series. After the show began airing new episodes in 2005, the BBC and Big Finish (among others) have since viewed the movie as this for the classic era. This is probably because; 1) the movie picked up from where the series left off (something which the revival didn't do), and 2) there was much less time between it and the last classic TV episode than the first episode of the revival.
-   _El Camino_ effectively serves as the first part of the epilogue following the Grand Finale to _Breaking Bad_ by wrapping up Jesse Pinkman's story (with the second part being the final episodes of the Spin-Off/pseudo-Prequel series _Better Call Saul_).
-   _Firefly_ received a deserved ending after being cancelled with the movie _Serenity_, which serves as the finale for the series.
-   The finale of _House of Anubis_ came in the form of a Made-for-TV Movie titled _The Touchstone of Ra_.
-   Perhaps the Trope Codifier is the final episode of _M\*A\*S\*H_, "Goodbye, Farewell and Amen", during which the Korean War finally comes to an end and the 4077 disbands. It runs an astonishing two-and-a-half hours, with sad and endearing moments abound. To this day, it holds the record for most-watched non-Super Bowl broadcast television program in history.
-   _Stargate SG-1_ had its remaining major plots concluded with _Stargate: The Ark of Truth_ and _Stargate: Continuum_.
-   _Transparent_ was wrapped up with a movie titled _Transparent: Musicale Finale_, which had the titular trans parent Maura Pfefferman killed off and focused on her family reacting to her death, a decision that was necessitated by Jeffrey Tambor (Maura's actor) being dropped from the show after facing sexual harassment allegations.
-   _Ultra Series_:
    -   _Ultraman Tiga_: The theatrical film, _Ultraman Tiga: The Final Odyssey_ serves as the epilogue and true Grand Finale of the series, depicting Tiga's last adventure in the Neo Frontier Universe and him subtly passing the torch to his successor: _Ultraman Dyna_.
    -   _Ultraman Cosmos_: The third movie _Ultraman Cosmos vs. Ultraman Justice: The Final Battle_ serves as an epilogue to the rest of the series and the true Grand Finale of Cosmos as a whole.
-   _Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist_ was cancelled by NBC after its second season, after which a movie called _Zoey's Extraordinary Christmas_ was created to tie up loose ends, airing on the Roku Channel.

    Western Animation 

-   _Aladdin and the King of Thieves_ serves as the conclusion of Disney's version of _Aladdin_ (consisting of a movie, the first sequel _Aladdin: The Return of Jafar_ and the animated series _Aladdin: The Series_), in which Aladdin meets his father and finally marries Jasmine.
-   _Drawn Together_ received a direct-to-DVD movie titled _The Drawn Together Movie: The Movie!_ after its cancellation. The film had the show's cast attempt to revive their series after hearing of its cancellation.
-   _Ed, Edd n Eddy_ concluded with _Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show_, where the Eds finally earned acceptance from the Cul-de-Sac Kids after they ended up getting their long overdue karma at the hands of the Kanker Sisters and Eddy's Big Brother Bully received long overdue karma for abusing his little brother.
-   Zig-zagged with _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_. As while the final _produced_ episode of the show is _Destination: Imagination_, the final _aired_ episode is "Goodbye to Bloo", which Word of God confirmed was the final episode. However most fans tend to look at the former as the true finale due to it ending with Frankie _finally_ earning her respect after years of cooking, cleaning, taking care of numerous imaginary friends, and pretty much running the house single-handedly without a bit of gratitude from anyone or an ounce of respect from her slave driving anal stuck-up bunny boss.
-   Zig-zagged with _G.I. Joe: The Movie_, which was originally intended to bridge the gap between season two of _G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero_ and an unproduced third season. With the series continuing production via DiC Entertainment rather than Sunbow, the movie at least serves as a proper finale to the original Sunbow run of the cartoon.
-   _Hey Arnold!_ received a proper conclusion years after the original show's cancellation in a Made-for-TV Movie called _Hey Arnold! The Jungle Movie_, in which Arnold finally reunites with his parents who have been missing since he was a baby.
-   _Kim Possible_ was originally intended to end with the movie _Kim Possible Movie: So the Drama_, which had Dr. Drakken finally pull off a competent scheme that nearly successfully takes over the world and had Kim and Ron's relationship taken to the next level. The movie instead became a Series Fauxnale because Disney was successfully petitioned to renew the series for more episodes.
-   _Leroy & Stitch_ serves as the conclusion to _Lilo & Stitch: The Series_, though the franchise would continue without Lilo thanks to two spinoffs consisting of the anime _Stitch!_ and the Chinese animated series _Stitch & Ai_.
-   The original _The Proud Family_ series ended with the Made-for-TV Movie _The Proud Family Movie_, which had the family dealing with a mad scientist named Dr. Carver planning to use peanut clones to take over the world. It later returned as a cartoon, but it was under a Continuity Reboot that seems to only maintain continuity with events of the TV series proper.
-   _Recess_ was supposed to end with the theatrical movie _Recess: School's Out_, however a few episodes aired after it (though chronologically taking place before the movie). The entire series ended with the direct-to-video movie _Recess: Taking the Fifth Grade_, pieced together from three episodes of a scrapped Sequel Series or seventh season.
-   _Sofia the First_ has _Forever Royal_, a Made-for-TV Movie, to end the series.
-   _The Spongebob Squarepants Movie_ was intended to be the finale of the _SpongeBob SquarePants_ franchise when it first came out. But Nickelodeon wanted to continue the series away, whether the creator wanted to or not, so its a Series Fauxnale instead. However, it's a persistent fandom belief that this is chronologically the final _Spongebob_ adventure, even though the show tends to run on negative continuity.
-   _Steven Universe: The Movie_ combined this with Pilot Movie, signifying the transition from _Steven Universe_ to the Sequel Series _Steven Universe: Future_.
-   _Tangled: The Series_ has _Plus Est Vous_, a Made-for-TV Movie three-part long series finale.
-   _Teacher's Pet_ had its story wrapped up in a theatrical movie where Spot turned to a Mad Scientist named Dr. Ivan Krank to fulfill his dream of becoming a boy.
-   _Teen Titans Go! & DC Super Hero Girls: Mayhem in the Multiverse_ serves as the series finale of _DC Super Hero Girls (2019)_, having the Super Hero Girls and their universe's Justice League try to thwart the schemes of Lex Luthor and Cythonna. The film notably has Supergirl reconcile with her cousin Superman as they concede that they are both great heroes in their own right, with Wonder Woman emphasizing that even as a reserve member of the Justice League, she'll always put her friends on the Super Hero Girls first.
-   _Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo_ serves as a conclusion series to _Teen Titans_, with all the five heroes heading to Japan, as well as Robin and Starfire admitting their feelings before their true love's kiss.
-   _The Venture Bros: Radiant is the Blood of the Baboon Heart_ brings a conclusion to _The Venture Bros._ after the show's cancellation.
-   _Transformers_:
    -   _Transformers: Prime_ concluded with _Predacons Rising_, which had the Autobots take down Unicron for good in a final battle and Decepticon leader Megatron reforming.
    -   _Transformers: Cyberverse_ had two movies made after the run of the original series, with the second movie _The Perfect Decepticon_ wrapping up the series' story by having the Autobots and Decepticons' peace treaty threatened by Tarn, who plots to take over Cybertron by using the Cortex Helm to take control of the other Perfect Decepticons and make them attack the other Cybertronians.
-   _Trollhunters: Rise of the Titans_ is the Grand Finale of the _Tales of Arcadia_ franchise, bringing the heroes of all three series together for a Final Battle.
-   _Turtles Forever_ serves as a conclusion to _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)_ and has the Turtles team up with their counterparts from the 1987 cartoon and the original Mirage comic book to thwart the Utrom Shredder's scheme to destroy the entire Ninja Turtles multiverse.
-   _We Bare Bears: The Movie_ was confirmed as the finale to _We Bare Bears_.
