For extra ambience, cue up anything by Air Supply.

**Sex Addiction Therapist:** Most likely, you'll end up going the way of David Carradine and Michael Hutchence: auto-erotic asphyxiation.  
**Kenny:** Auto-erotic asphyxiation? What's that?  
**Therapist:** I don't want to go into too much detail, but... you choke yourself with a belt around your neck while masturbating, dressed up like Batman or something, then you pass out from lack of air. And apparently, it makes your orgasm super awesome.  
**Kenny:** Really?!  
**Butters:** Oh, no! I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume!

"Intentionally cutting off oxygen to the brain for sexual arousal", to quote The Other Wiki. A general term for sex acts that involve either restricting one's own breathing for intensified sensations during masturbation or one party restraining the breathing of another. Needless to say, this particular paraphilia includes all the risks associated with asphyxiation, including fatalities. Thus it's generally considered to fail the "safe" part of Safe, Sane, and Consensual, particularly when it involves constricting the throat as it is usually portrayed in fiction. Sometimes it will be a plot point that what at first appears to be a masturbation session gone wrong is actually a disguised murder. In the case that the death is just purely accidental, fully expect it to be portrayed as an Undignified Death; a sort of post-mortem Caught with Your Pants Down.

Not to be confused with Marshmallow Hell. Related to Out with a Bang, if you do it wrong. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Possibly related to Too Dumb to Live, in any case. Sometimes used to promote the idea that Bondage Is Bad.

For clarification, _auto_\-erotic asphyxiation is doing it yourself, typically via some form of hanging, as opposed to getting someone else to do it to you. It should go without saying that this is a terrible, terrible, _terrible_ idea — to the extent that many of the more famous deaths from it have happened that way. On the other hand, if you do get someone else to do it and things go wrong, it is liable to get them convicted of murder or manslaughter even if they manage to convince the court that it was consensual. Also, being drunk or under the influence of drugs that affect alertness (whether by making you feel more alert than you are or by lessening awareness and consciousness/depressing the central nervous system) increases the odds of dying, _especially_ if combined with doing it solo.

If you survive it, you can put yourself at risk for chronic traumatic brain damage (in the same way people who suffer from repeated mini-strokes or concussions do — cutting off oxygen to the brain for any amount of time damages it, even if the damage is not noticeable immediately, brain damage is _cumulative_), a major stroke that may be delayed due to damage to the arteries in the neck/dislodging fat or a clot in one of them, and/or weakening or breaking the bones in your cervical spine, causing anything from chronic pain to death when/if the wrong one breaks. The risk of both stroke and broken neck vertebrae is also multiplied _exponentially_ if you do anything else — from playing football or hockey to headbanging or having your hair done in beauty salons a lot — that inflicts trauma to the region.

In short, Don't Try This at Home. Or _anywhere_.

-   In the _Full Metal Panic!_ novels, Gauron once had a thing with a female scientist and strangled her. They both seemed to get off on it, as Gauron even lampshades it by mocking her, asking her if she actually likes making him angry, and actually wants him to hurt her.

-   _CSI_:
    -   The victim in one case apparently died in this fashion. Of course, this being a crime drama, it's _never_ what it first looks like.

-   _Game of Thrones_:
    
    -   This is cited in a deleted scene in Season 2 where former Sex Slave Doreah is strangling Irri to death.
    
    _"A trader from Qarth told me the greatest pleasure comes from a silk cord around the neck, tied very,_ very_, tight. (victim clutches futilely at the cord) The reason so few people indulge in this..._exquisite _pleasure...he told me is it's the danger. A moment too long, and ecstasy becomes death. (goes limp) It is known."_
    
    -   There's also a scene where Myranda chokes Ramsay during sex. Considering that right before that she bit the hell out of his lip, and in the next scene his chest is covered in fresh cuts, it raises... questions.

-   One Jerkass cigarette executive in _Midsomer Murders_ turns out to be into this, as revealed by his wife. As there was a recent strangling recalling a similar series of crimes decades ago, it's yet another reason to suspect him. The murderer was actually his boss, who murdered his blackmailer and tried to pin it on the previous killer, a hotel owner who ended up stabbed in the shower by his mother when she thought he'd started killing again.
-   In the first season of _Murder One_, the defendant likes to strangle girls when he's having sex, which gets used against him when a former girlfriend turns up strangled to death and naked.

    -   Jeremy gets so dangerously bored sitting around the house doing nothing that he threatens to try "that thing Michael Hutchence did".
    -   At one point much later in the series, we get this quote from Mark:
        
        _"If he hangs himself over this, I can stick an orange in his mouth and call it a fatal wanking accident."_
        
-   _Queer as Folk (US)_ has Brian trying this in the first season finale, but he's pulled down by Michael before anything horrible can happen.

-   _Six Feet Under_ had an opener death caused by autoerotic asphyxiation. The dude's wife is devastated and had no idea he was into that stuff.
-   This sort of happens on _True Blood_, but with a twist. Jason is screwing some girl and she's tied up and he chokes her a little, and she "dies". He freaks out and leaves, and then she wakes up — she was just pretending. But then the real serial killer walks in and kills her. Of course, Jason is accused of her murder and even believes himself that he killed her.
-   _The Umbrella Academy (2019)_: After kidnapping Klaus, Cha-Cha and Hazel attempt to strangle him for information, not realizing that he's a masochist. Obviously, their attempt doesn't work, and Cha-Cha is disgusted when she realizes Klaus's reaction.

    **Mulder:** Why are you telling _me_ that?  
    **Bruckman:** _\[shrugs\]_ Look, forget I mentioned it. It's none of my business.
    

    Music 

-   The deaths of at least two famous musicians in what seemed to be this way is how the concept entered public consciousness both in the Western world (as a result of Michael Hutchence) and in Japan (as a result of a common assumption regarding hide) and made it Memetic Mutation as a "badass" or Sex, Drugs, and Rock & Roll way to die.
-   "Suffocate Me" by Angelfish is both metaphorical and literal.
-   Played for very Black Comedy in Mitch Benn's "Auto-Erotic Asphyxiation":
    
    Was it a tragic accident or was it suicide,
    
    Would they still be here today if they hadn't gotten bored and tried,
    
    Auto-erotic asphyxiation.
    
    Did they want to die, there's no way of knowing,
    
    They couldn't tell if they were coming or going.
    
-   In Lana Del Rey's music videos (such as "Blue Jeans", "Born to Die", and "Ride", all from _Born to Die_), she generally depicts men putting their fingers around her neck while they have sex with her. A lot of critics give her heat for this, but when asked in an interview about it, she said, "I just like it rough."
-   According to Michael Gira, Swans' 1986 song "A Hanging" is about this as a form of ritual self-sacrifice.
-   The _Recoil_ song "Breath Control," about a woman trying this out with her lover and accidentally killing him.
-   The UK Subs' 1979 hit _Stranglehold_ managed to include this:
    
    It's oh so painful and oh so nice,
    
    Though I can only do it once or twice...
    
-   "Give Great Thanks" by Dorian Electra has a lyric which mentions this, complete with the Auto-Tune on their voice becoming more high pitched as they sing it.
    
    I'm grateful, I'm grateful  
    I'm grateful, I'm grateful  
    The way that you're choking my neck  
    And not letting me breathe  
    I don't need anymore 'cause I have you, baby
    

    Stand-Up Comedy 

-   George Carlin performs a bit about this in _Life Is Worth Losing_, criticizing parents of young men who die from it for covering it up as suicide to prevent their own embarrassment, thus preventing any kind of discouragement that could potentially save the lives of many more young men. The special in general is considered to be his absolute darkest, even by his standards.
-   Conversely, Ricky Gervais mentions in one of his stand-ups an incident where a British public figure was found dead with various accoutrements suggesting that it was one of this kind of incident. He goes on to say that if he was to ever engage in this himself, he'd let an intimate friend know about it and have him/her drop by to check, and to have said friend get rid of _everything but_ the noose if he was found dead and telling everyone it was suicide.

    Theatre 

-   In _Waiting for Godot_, while debating possible ways to pass the time, one of the protagonists suggests hanging themselves to get an erection.

    Video Games 

-   In _Silent Hill: Shattered Memories_, "the Choking Game" (which is, if not erotic, at least recreational) is apparently a bit of a fad at Midwich High School, and several students have died doing it.
-   _Disco Elysium_:
    -   A possible reading of Harry's trashed hotel room at the beginning of the game is that it is the aftermath of an attempt at him trying to autoerotically asphyxiate himself with the Horrific Necktie, with him waking up after his bender with his tie strung in a noose-style knot and dangling off the ceiling fan. (The other possible reading is that Harry was just trying to kill himself. Or that he was trying to kill himself through autoerotic asphyxiation.)
    -   To support the above reading, having a high Electrochemistry stat and the Horrific Necktie equipped will result in it trying to talk him into autoerotic asphyxiation with it as a Running Gag, usually when learning about something boring or existential.
    -   If the player chooses to start masturbating over the Page Three Stunna with the personified Horrific Necktie equipped<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , it will 'tighten up a bit for you', ask you if that's good and call you a "sick, wild fuck-boy". Electrochemistry, typically a devil-may-care hedonist, will respond by freaking out and force you to stop.
    -   A Harry with a high Inland Empire stat might become obsessed with the idea that the murder victim hanged himself doing autoerotic asphyxiation, talking to the corpse to ask it if it was enjoying its death, and repeatedly touching the corpse's penis (much to Kim's annoyance, who points out how unlikely it is). (We later discover the corpse _had_ enjoyed his death, but that he'd been having sex with a woman at the time.)
    -   Harry's/the Necktie's obsession with autoerotic asphyxiation probably stems back to his fandom for the Revacholian disco star Guillaume le Million (Rhymes on a Dime. Somehow??), who — if you complete the thought — you find out died in an autoerotic asphyxiation listening to a disco record on loop, in a setup similar to Harry's trashed bedroom at the beginning of the game. His Encyclopedia warns him that Guillaume's death is a "metaphor for Revachol". If you try and discuss him with Joyce, she's convinced Guillaume died of venereal disease, possibly implying Harry's ideas about the death are just another part of his own dangerous fetish.

    Visual Novels 

-   An optional scene in Renzei Feng's second season in _Villainous Nights_ has Renzei and the player character engage in asphyxiation during sex using Renzei's power over air, relying on the heroine's telepathy to help keep things safer than would normally be possible with such play.

    Webcomics 

-   The protagonist of _Chopping Block_ once killed an entire band and made it look like they'd inadvertently strangled themselves during an autoerotic asphyxiation circlejerk. He described this as "priceless."
-   Hinted at with _Homestuck_'s Equius, who already has a musclebeast and masochism/submissive fetish. He's always had "bloodshot" bags under his eyes and grins while Gamzee (who is finally acting his bloodcolor) strangles him to death.
-   _Other People's Business_: Shown as a part of Leon and Collin's violent relationship.
-   In _Something\*Positive,_ Davan gets into a Friends with Benefits\-type relationship with a slightly psychotic girl who's into strangling guys during sex. Note that she did not ask if he was into it before trying it on him (and indeed, seemed indignant that he hadn't specifically mentioned it being a turn-off).
-   _Theater Hopper_ had some people wondering why Vader was strapped to a table in the first _Revenge of the Sith_ trailer and wondered if he liked that stuff, supporting it with him wearing leather, and that he likely choked officers for this trope.
-   _xkcd_ suspects Darth Vader of this.

    Web Original 

-   Jokingly referenced in Eurogamer's playthrough of the _Resident Evil Village_ "Maiden" demo.
    
    **Lady Dimitrescu**: _(grabs the player character by the neck)_  
    **Aoife**: ...A little tighter?

    -   In "Double Deuce," Woodhouse finds out the "mysterious death" of one of his old war buddies was just an attempt to cover up an autoerotic asphyxiation mishap.
    
    **Woodhouse:** You know, I do recall a lot of loose doorknobs...  
    **Stinky:** And there was his plane's name.  
    **Woodhouse:** I always thought that had something to do with his engine. _(raises glass)_ Here's to you, "Choke 'n' Stroke."
    
-   The _BoJack Horseman_ episode "Higher Love" uses auto-erotic asphyxiation as a major plot point. Mr. Peanutbutter's agent (and later BoJack's costar in the _Secretariat_ movie) both die from these incidents, and BoJack threatens to do this in order to get his girlfriend to say that she loves him.
-   In an episode of _The Cleveland Show_, Donna reveals she was faking being injured and strangles Holt threatening to kill him if he tells Cleveland. Then she notices him undoing his pants.
    -   A Cutaway Gag has Cleveland at David Carradine's funeral, giggling inappropriately at a eulogy with a lot of Accidental Innuendo. He apologizes, to which the minister says it's ok because autoerotic asphyxiation is a funny way to die. Cleveland replies, "You can die from that?" and starts crying.
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   Michael Hutchence's death is alluded to in a cutaway gag.
    -   In the episode "Business Guy", when Lois' father, Carter falls into a coma, it turns out that he left Video Wills for several situations:
        
        **Carter:** _(on video)_ Hello, if you're watching this, it means they didn't cut the rope when I climaxed. As a result, I'm now dead.  
        **Carter's attorney:** _(fast-forwarding the tape)_ That's not it.
        
    -   This kicks off the Drama Bomb that is "Screams Of Silence: The Story Of Brenda Q.", with Quagmire nearly killing himself via doing this while watching clown porn.
        -   In the same episode, it turns out to be a Chekhov's Skill, when Quagmire's repeated abuse of this trope allows him to trick Brenda's boyfriend into thinking he had killed Quagmire via strangulation.
-   In _Metalocalypse_, when Pickles has to go to rehab the other bandmates suggest autoerotic asphyxiation as a possible substitute. Ofdensen thinks that's a horrible idea, but the other bandmates think it's a badass way to die.
