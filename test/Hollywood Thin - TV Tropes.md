The opposite of Hollywood Pudgy. Basically, the media's tendency to present women far skinnier than the average person as attractive, healthy and average/normal.

If you were to take these people and compare them with a random selection of people, it would become obvious that many of them are _much_ thinner than average. Often they will have an extremely small waist, very shallow ribcage, weak hips, and _extremely_ narrow shoulders that very few women in the real world can possess.

Women considered "fit" enough to be shown on TV generally fall into the fifth percentile when it comes to shoulder width and rib cage depth. These are hereditary traits that no woman can actually control and that have nothing to do with actual physical fitness. Yet these women are the ones who Hollywood shows as "average", especially if they have unrealistically enormous breasts (that are almost definitely implants) hanging just above that extremely narrow waist.

For men the opposite holds true. Any male who isn't sporting a six-pack, ripped pecs, or biceps as thick as oak trunks is often portrayed as, or is implied to be, scrawny and weak, even if the character is supposed to be fourteen years old. (The opposite may be true in cultures that favor the Bishounen archetype for male beauty.) Again, if you were to take these guys and compare them with a random selection of men in the real world, their bodies would not be seen as very average-looking.

Ditto in animation, video games, and a great many comics, doubly so because they aren't required to find living people who have the desired looks. In fact, being unconstrained by human physiology allows non-live-action media to exaggerate features; see also Noodle People, Most Common Superpower and Heroic Build.

This is quite possibly a side effect of the entertainment industry's tendency to cast, and then depict, an entire slate of attractive people, except for when the plot demands otherwise.

Subtrope of Hollywood Beauty Standards. Contrast Hollywood Pudgy and Hollywood Homely. Compare Informed Attractiveness.

    Advertising 

-   Pro wrestler April Hunter stopped eating when she arrived to Japan on her first trip to Chiba to do a Toyota commercial. This made her host/employer worry that she'd get too skinny, something no one had apparently hassled her about before. She then realized that in Japan, where many athletes follow a sumo diet, including the ladies, she came off as fairly small for her size, where she was used to being bigger than most peers at home.

    Anime and Manga 

-   Any human or humanoid character (male or female) in any series by CLAMP. All are _very_ tall (except for kids) and _very_ thin. There's a reason why they're often called Noodle People.
-   Hiko Seijuro in _Rurouni Kenshin_. He spends a lot of time pumping iron to offset the side-effects of the Hiten-Mitsurugi Ryu, to the point where he has weights put into his trenchcoat. As a result, he has biceps the size of tree trunks, washboard abs, and huge pecs. Contrast this to his student, Kenshin, who does not spend as much time weight-training (and, while not flabby or scrawny, is nowhere near as muscular as his teacher.)
-   The eponymous character of _Nana_. She's so thin as to be one of the Noodle People; one has to wonder how she got pregnant in the first place!
-   Clair Leonelli in _Heat Guy J_. The artist (Nobuteru Yuki) draws thin people to begin with, but really played it up with Clair. (It's especially noticeable with his dark clothes and sickly pale skin. Justified, as he's the resident ill boy in this anime. Averted in the manga, where he's still thin, but no more so than any other character, and not sickly looking.
-   _Death Note_ volume 13 lists the height and weight of every major character. For some reason, they all seem to be underweight. Special mention goes to Light and L, who are both 5'10 and weight 119 and _110_ pounds, respectively.

    Fashion 

-   Tabloids. Pick one up at random and you'll see a Shocking Exposé of some star's "embarrassing body flab" or cellulite (which roughly nine out of ten women have), accompanied by ancient stock swimsuit pics. Anyone with ten pounds of extra fat or more is considered "struggling with weight problems."
    -   Tabloids are really inconsistent about it, too. The cover will show a Hollywood Thin girl with the appropriate headlines (Deathly skinny! Only 94 Pounds! Family is Scared for her Life!). However, open it up and five pages later it will talk about her looking "Fabulous in a \[HARD TO PRONOUNCE DESIGNER\] gown at a party last week."
    -   It's also not unusual to see a hand-wringing "How Thin is Too Thin" tabloid that contains pages of advertisements for questionable (and dangerous) diet pills that promise you'll lose twenty pounds in two weeks. In some cases, the woman (and it's usually a woman) in the "before" picture looked a little bit fleshy at the most and in the "after" shot, she looked Hollywood Thin.
    -   More insidiously, the "BABY BUMP??!??!!" articles/headlines often serve the same purpose, except that instead of directly shaming an actress for daring not to be Hollywood Thin, they purport to be excited about her suspected baby. Even if the suspected "baby bump" is no more than wearing a loose T-shirt and sweatpants, or simply looking like she exhaled.
-   Fashion photography has reached the point, in its ever-stricter search for vanishing thinness, where the models are starting to look like death warmed over. So, the visible ribs, the bags under the eyes, the other signs of starvation are photoshopped away, though, of course, the model remains as twig-thin as she was at the start. Readers are led to assume that this kind of body shape can be attained without looking like a walking corpse, and the search for a model who actually looks like Gumby<small>◊</small> goes onward.
-   Worth noting is the controversy over 2011's London Fashion Week, which used models that were obviously very unhealthy. Say all you want about some people being naturally thin, but that sure as hell ain't natural!
-   Closely related... shop mannequins generally have Barbie-like implausible figures, being tall and sylph like. To make the mannequins look even thinner, the stores will put them in the smallest possible size, then pull the excess fabric to the back and tie it there so that the mannequin's inhuman figure can be displayed in full.
-   The aptly named model Twiggy is widely regarded as having first popularized the idea of thin women as sexy, moving away from the "curvy is sexy" image of the early 20th century. There were allegations that she was anorexic, despite the fact she was noted for being a Big Eater. Ironically, Twiggy herself observed in interviews at the time that "obviously" no other models would be so freakishly thin in the future.
-   It has been repeatedly shown in studies that Hollywood Thin is the least healthy weight category of all (it is far less risky to be among the most morbid of morbidly obese). The lack of body weight causes undue stress on internal organs and means your body has no reserves to fight infection or repair from injury.
    -   That said, being _slightly_ underweight might actually be a benefit in terms of lifespan and health (there is, however a difference between being at slightly below the healthy body weight, and being anorexic or bulimic, since there are other reasons, such as a fast metabolism or a whole-grain vegan diet, that one might be below normal). BTW, the same website found that as more and more Americans became overweight this average was wrongly deemed a "healthy" weight, which may be what the article was talking about in the first place.
-   Thankfully, this trope may be on its way to become discredited as many Fashion industries impose a minimum weight limit. They're beginning to realize having models that fit their definition of beautiful isn't much good if they're too unhealthy to get on the catwalk.

    Film — Animation 

-   _Mulan_ uses this to show the hypocrisy and inconsistency of the standards Mulan has to live up to. When preparing to meet the Matchmaker, Mulan is told that her future husband would prefer a girl with a tiny waist (as they tie a sash tightly to make her waist smaller). Upon seeing her, the Matchmaker immediately says she's too skinny.
-   For some of the Disney Princess characters, it actually makes sense for them to be thin in-universe (although Author Appeal was clearly the main intent). Snow White and Cinderella grew up in poverty as servant girls. Aurora and Belle likewise had modest upbringings in the countryside. Ariel and Pocahontas are established to be very athletic and adventurous. Of course in the 2000s, one of the most common criticisms of the franchise was the 'unrealistic body' message the characters were sending to young girls.
-   Merida in _Brave_ is not an example in her film as while she's slender, is not impossibly so and has a figure justified by her love of horse riding and archery. However the Disney Princess merchandise received criticism for making her waist thinner to go with a controversial Girliness Upgrade.
-   Esmeralda of _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_ is the opposite case, where she has a very curvy body and is quite voluptuous for someone who lives on the streets and has to dance for change.

    Film — Live Action 

-   Along with the Twiggy example above, Audrey Hepburn (unintentionally) set a standard in the early 1960s for Hollywood Thin. She was tall at 5"7 but never weighed over 115 lbs (outside pregnancy) her entire life. Sadly, this stemmed from having gone through long stretches of starvation as a teenager during the Nazis' occupation of the Netherlands. This ruined her metabolism and led to lifelong health complications including anemia, having issues getting and staying pregnant, and eventually stomach cancer from she which she died at the early age of 63. The irony of this is that she at first didn't fit the beauty standards of the day, so she was often cast as the Hollywood Homely girl who needed a makeover. She was also less uptight about her costumes being altered to hide her body flaws than other starlets of the day. Of course nowadays she's seen as one of the most beautiful women ever.
-   _Bridget Jones_ presented a Values Dissonance example. To pass as the British everywoman (who obsesses over a weight of 125-138 lbs), Renée Zellweger had to put on 20 pounds to carry the part. This wasn't much of an issue in Britain, but in America this put her outside the realm of "Hollywood starlet." Renee had to lose the weight before she could get Hollywood jobs again, surprising many British fans of the film with her rail-thin physique. She gained the weight back for the second film but not the third - and there was a line from Bridget mentioning that she was now at her ideal weight.
-   Subverted in _Anger Management_ where Adam Sandler's character is confronted with a girl who's sensitive about her weight and thinks he's calling her fat. He tries to say she could stand to _gain_ a few pounds, but this just makes her even angrier. It later turns out she was an actress hired to annoy him.
-   Beyonce expressed backlash to the figure she maintained for _Dreamgirls_, saying she was relieved to be able to gain weight after it was over. She had to lose twenty pounds for the role. After having twins in 2017, she's said she's come to live with the fact that she'll never be as thin as she once was and finds it liberating.
-   Anne Hathaway refused to say her methods for losing weight in _Les Misérables (2012)_ - she lost twenty five pounds in a short space of time - as she didn't want fans trying to emulate them. The point for the weight loss was that Fantine was starving to death on the streets.
-   Defied by Jennifer Lawrence when she starred in _The Hunger Games_, as she refused to lose weight to play Katniss. In the book it's a plot point that District 12 is starving, so Katniss is quite thin, but she opted not to send a negative message to impressionable young fans who would miss the context.
-   _The Devil Wears Prada_ had Anne Hathaway initially told to gain ten pounds, but they changed it around so that she had to lose that amount instead - and would be padded for Andy's pre-makeover scenes. She and Emily Blunt were constantly starving during production (as Emily's character is continually trying to lose weight).
-   Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis lost about 10 kg to play the _Black Swan_
-   To play the role of an anorexic girl in _To the Bone_, Lily Collins had to lose around 9kg

    Literature 

-   _My Year of Rest and Relaxation_: Rava desperately wants to be thinner despite being a size 4 and is jealous of the narrator's thinness (she is significantly thinner than a 4). The narrator is also treated as beautiful by everyone (including herself), while she seems unimpressed by Rava's appearance.
-   Discussed in _The Screwtape Letters_. Screwtape mentions that Hell's newest program on sexuality is to proclaim that being unnaturally thin is natural and attractive.
-   In the _Vampire Academy_ series, the Moroi vampires are naturally tall and svelte. Lead character Rose notes that while Moroi have a body humans idolize, in turn most Moroi women covet the more curvaceous figures that humans and dhampirs have.
    -   In the spinoff series _Bloodlines_, human Sydney has body image issues by comparing herself to skinny Moroi women.
    -   In the first _Bloodlines_ novel, a fashion designer convinces Jill to be one of her catwalk models due to her Moroi physique.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Ally McBeal_ was this trope at its extreme. Portia DeRossi has recently come out about her anorexia issues stemming from the show. Callista Flockhart was no fatty either.
-   _Daisy Jones & The Six_: In the book, Daisy is heavily implied to have an eating disorder that manifests in her only eating one meal a day in order to maintain her thin frame. In the series, no mention of her having an eating disorder is made. The one scene that shows it (where Daisy goes to a hamburger place on a date and doesn't eat) in the book is changed in the series so that she actually eats two hamburgers. She stays extremely thin.
-   _Lost_, which does this for both men and women (with the exception of Hurley).
-   _House_. Particularly Thirteen (Hugh Laurie is skinny—which given the fact he had been a rower at Cambridge makes sense—but any perception of sexiness arises out of his scruffy beard and big blue eyes).
    -   Lampshaded in-verse a few times with Cameron. _"All right. You weigh 90 pounds because it makes you healthier?"_
    -   At one point, House "jokes" that Cameron is too thin to be menstruating.
-   _V2009_ series. Justified for the Visitors. For the humans, not so much.
-   _America's Next Top Model_. _All_ of them. Even the contestants portrayed as "big" or "full figured" are fantastically curvy but nowhere near fat.
-   Actually subverted in the makeover show _The Swan_, of all places. Contestant Kelly Becker from season 1 was the only girl who had to put on weight during her training as the judges felt she was dangerously underweight. She put on some muscle and looked much healthier by the end.
-   Nicely subverted in _Ringer_, as former prostitute and drug addict Bridget attempts to assume her healthier twin sister's identity, and everyone comments on how much thinner she is, which they largely don't see as a good thing. Of course it is still Sarah Michelle Gellar that they're talking about.
-   _Buffy_:
    -   One of Sarah Michelle Gellar's stunt doubles talked about how hard the popularity of this was on female stunt doubles. The stunt double was previously a suit actor for the Pink Power Ranger and several of the monsters at different times, and, despite being the double for wispy gymnast Amy Jo Johnson and willowy dancer Catherine Sutherland, it gave her a little more room in terms of body shape (since the identity-obscuring costume and scenes shared with a team of muscular male stunt actors always made her look smaller by virtue of perspective.) However, she went to _Buffy,_ and as the "Lollipop" look (as she called it) came in vogue in Hollywood, she said she had a hell of a time matching body-type with Gellar and still being healthy enough to do her job. She also said that _Rangers_ switched over from an American to an Asian stunt team around the time she left for possibly the same reason (she mentioned the male actors they brought over from Japan and Korea were about the same size she was, right after she mentioned she was sweating herself down to nothing doing fight scenes in the California sun under several feet of foam rubber.)
    -   Average-sized Amber Benson was criticized for her weight on fansite boards, despite being only large compared to her thin costars.
-   The rigid "thin" standard took its toll on young actresses on other shows, as well. Two notable examples: Tracey Gold had a well-publicized battle with anorexia after media outlets commented on her weight while she appeared on _Growing Pains._ During the run of the show, she was a healthy, attractive teenager. Likewise, Christina Applegate has said in interviews that she spent an unhealthy amount of time dieting and working out to wear the tight outfits required of her as Kelly on _Married... with Children._
-   On _The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency,_ Janice very honestly seemed to believe there was no such a thing as "too skinny." When she was told it would be good for business to at least have a few plus-sized models on her roster, she was openly hostile toward them, saying (_in tears_) they were bad role models and wondering how she would be able to explain health, fitness, and nutrition to her young children and not sound like a hypocrite for employing them. This was then undercut by one of her models named Crystal (who Janice seemed to be grooming as her protege) who later said she had dieted down so far she was no longer having her period, talking as though it were some kind of necessary sacrifice instead of the giant red flag it was.
-   _Love Island_: All the contestants are extremely ripped in the case of men and very skinny for women. It's become a point of controversy that they've never had a plus-size or even slightly bigger than very thin contestant.
-   _The Suite Life of Zack & Cody_ had an episode where Maddie and London were respectively convinced that they were too fat and too skinny. Refreshingly they were taught An Aesop that binge eating to gain weight is just as unhealthy as excessive exercise to lose it.
-   _That's So Raven_ has an episode where Raven tries to model a dress she designed for a Fashion Magazine - only to discover the magazine photoshopped her to be thinner on the cover. They get a professional to model the dress on the catwalk, which Raven crashes. Refreshingly, rather than demonising the thin model, they have her also criticise the magazine's blatant use of photoshop.
    
    **Raven:** (_pointing to the cover_) No one looks like that.
    
    **Model:** _I_ don't even look like that.
    
-   _Nine Perfect Strangers_: Masha's backstory has been changed so that she wasn't Formerly Fat and nothing is made of her extremely restrictive diet. Despite Nicole Kidman's thinness, it isn't treated as remotely unusual and is portrayed as healthy, rather than in the novel, where it was the result of an extremely strict regime.
-   _Big Little Lies_: In both the book and series, Jane is portrayed as a compulsive exerciser. In the book, this is made clear to be a side effect of an eating disorder she developed after being raped, which led to her losing a lot of weight. In the series, it isn't commented upon, nor is it treated as abnormal, and in fact Jane's (thin) frame causes her to blend in perfectly with the other women.

    Music 

-   During his "Thin White Duke" period in the mid-1970s (i.e. _Station to Station_), David Bowie dropped in weight to 94 pounds as a result of his diet of "red peppers, milk, and cocaine." Let us repeat: _94_ pounds. Not 194. Not 94 kilograms. 94 _pounds_. And no, Bowie is _not_ short: he's 5'10", which is slightly taller than the average British man of his generation.
-   One of the most well-known examples is Karen Carpenter. Once she became famous, the singer was criticized in the media for her appearance. In her twenties, she was 5'4" and about 120lbs, which is slender by normal standards (BMI of 20-21). When she died in 1983, from complications due to anorexia nervosa, she weighed only 91lbs (BMI of 15.6), shortly after being hospitalized at 78lbs, and looked terrifyingly skeletal.
-   Mitch Benn's "Size Zero" is about this:
    
    She's a size zero,  
    With a midriff as thin as her wrist.  
    She's a size zero,  
    If she gets any thinner, she'll technically cease to exist.
    
-   Eminem:
    -   In his youth, he was so thin-faced and scrawny that he took on the Lean and Mean persona of _Slim_ Shady, and was still made to lose 24lbs for _8 Mile_. Around this time he looked amazing on camera, but fans at his _The Eminem Show_ tour complained that he looked unrecognisable and sickly.
    -   Eminem lost the weight he gained during his drug addiction before his comeback in 2009, something that became an obsessive quest for him (as he attempted to burn 2000 calories every day, eventually wearing himself out from the overexercising). While he used this in his art to portray his _Relapse_ Slasher Movie character, he faced significant criticism for this from the media and fans, who said he looked sickly or too different. (He would later complain about this on the _The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (Deluxe)_ album cut "Baby".) Upon his comeback in 2017, he appeared at a similar weight to what he'd been in his late 20s, and was praised for looking more like his original self, but it also came with him developing a bit of a belly.
-   The Kpop industry (and Asian pop industry in general) is (in)famous for having ridiculous size standards for their idols, especially the female ones. Extreme diets (like only having water and a cracker as a meal) and an ungodly amount of hours of dance practices are the norm, which has them looking inhumanly thin. There have even been some instances of performers fainting on-stage or just after presentations from exhaustion and malnutrition.
    -   There's even cases of idols being criticized by fans for "getting fat" despite looking like this.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Starting in 2004, CM Punk teased Daizee Haze for being too thin in IWA Mid-South which eventually lead to her flexing muscles at Punk before tossing him to the mat while "disguised" as his nemesis, Delirious, in 2005. This isn't as humorous looking back, as Haze was eventually forced out of the pro wrestling industry due to a battle with anorexia.
-   Stacy Keibler was nearly 6 feet tall with a BMI of 19, which is barely above being anorexic, and was considered "perfect" by fans.
-   One episode of _Raw_ had Randy Orton return from injury and Vince McMahon came out and said his clothes looked like they were hanging off him and his neck looked like a stack of quarters (implying he'd lost weight because he hadn't been able to train due to his injury). Except Randy looked exactly the same as he normally does (although he was put in a suit a size or two too big to help with the effect.)
-   Angel Williams was known as the hard body for her "perfect" abs and biceps. Then she went to WWE's developmental companies and came out noticeably thinner, which made her the butt of these jokes for half a decade, including her second and third runs in TNA as Angelina Love. Around 2010, she was speculated to not be eating altogether. Leva Bates even expressed worry about her state, in what had to be self aware humor. While the jokes have mostly stopped in her fourth TNA run, it bears mentioning Love probably wouldn't be able to wrestle at all if she ever was as worryingly underweight as claimed. Additionally she's said in interviews that her family are naturally very thin and can get abs very easily with minimal training - then joking that many of her contemporaries hated her for this.
-   Michelle McCool faced _massive_ insults from fans while she was getting pushed. She had a massive Hatedom that called her "Skeletor" because of her thin body type. On the flip side, Bryan Alvarez accused her of having an eating disorder, stating it was the reason she had been hospitalized sometime prior to _Wrestlemania 23_. Michelle denied the eating disorder story plenty of times, stating that the reason was ignoring health problems out of fear of losing her spot on television. For the record, Michelle is 5 ft 10 and was billed at 128 lbs.
-   LayCool referred to Maria Kanellis as "the underfed redhead" while they were also mocking Mickie James for being overweight. Giving this some uncomfortable Reality Subtext, Maria has confessed that she was told she was "too fat" by management.
-   A lot of people tend to go on about how the WWE Divas are too skinny but it was quite a shock when Maria Menunous got in the ring and she looked like a skeleton next to Alicia Fox, Rosa Mendes, Gail Kim and Kelly Kelly. Though the difference is obviously down to the divas being actual athletes and having muscle on them even if it's not too visible.
-   CM Punk was later on the receiving end himself in WWE, where he was called a "Skinny Fat Ass" by Kevin Nash. In the wake of the Chris Benoit paterfamilicide, US news media put a spotlight on WWE and its drug issues. In a preemptive bypass to the buffer Straight Edge Punk's presence would have been to the inevitable criticism, reporters made sure to emphasize Punk was "half the size" of the other wrestlers in WWE.
-   Brie Bella has gotten hateful comments hurled at her by fans claiming she looks like a stick insect and "needs to eat something". This is ignoring the possibility that she merely just looks much thinner because she is next to a lot of very curvy and muscular women on _Total Divas_. The twins have said in interviews that Brie is naturally slimmer proportioned than Nikki. Additionally Brie is a vegan so she's bound to be a little less curvy than her sister. Showing how Hate Dumb really is in effect, her sister Nikki has gotten the reverse of this and been referred to as "the fat twin".<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  _Total Divas_ does show the effects of this trope. Brie panics about an upcoming photoshoot and tries to get her sister to do a juice cleanse with her. As in drinking nothing but smoothies for 30 days. While a cleanse is often a good idea if one wants to detox after too much junk food, it's the sort of thing that should just be done for 2-3 days at most.
-   A.J. Lee has faced similar comments, though not to the same extent. She is naturally very petite and again looks much thinner than she actually is in comparison to the more voluptuous Divas on the roster. For added effect, her Chick Busters partner Kaitlyn is a former body builder. So of course AJ is going to look anorexic next to her. AJ is even known to crack jokes about frequently being mistaken as Older Than They Look. And weirdly enough, in her autobiography, she claims she was eliminated from NXT because "no one wants to fuck you".
-   This is the gimmick of Ring of Honor crew member turned trainee turned wrestler, Cheeseburger. He was so named because Charlie Haas took a look at him and proclaimed he needed to eat one.
-   Kristal Marshall was known for having a very skinny figure while she was in WWE. She later confessed that she barely ate at all while she was on the road - and claimed that she was "dangerously underweight". She was a much healthier weight when she appeared in TNA.
-   Layla said that her slim frame came about from an intense diet and working out twice a day. While recovering from surgery to repair a torn ACL, she naturally wasn't able to train quite that much, and gained a little bit of weight. She claims people asked if she had health problems.
-   Dawn Marie admits to being a stress eater and that her body type in WWE came about from excessive dieting (and she's admitted to not being a fan of exercise). When there were talks of her returning to WWE, she said if she were to she would need months of notice - in order to plan a diet to get to the ideal weight for TV.
-   Subverted with Alexa Bliss, who started training at WWE right after some time as a body builder. She was dangerously underweight as a result and was told she had to gain ten pounds before she could train. Alexa has also admitted to struggling with an eating disorder in her youth - which she was able to overcome through getting into fitness.
-   Becky Lynch likewise flirted with being a bodybuilder before she returned to wrestling in 2012 - before giving it up because she felt the weight levels she was expected to maintain were not healthy.
-   Katey Harvey detailed an instance where she was told that if she needed to be hired by a major wrestling company, she'd have to lose weight to fit the 'Diva look'. She also detailed suffering from an eating disorder as a teenager, and getting praise for her figure when she'd been starving herself - and that getting over those insecurities to gain muscle was especially tricky.
-   In the 'Diva Era', Kelly Kelly was considered the ideal body type - with Kaitlyn (mentioned above) saying that Vince McMahon prefers waify bodies like her. Kelly's body type came from ten years of gymnastics, where she admitted to doing nothing but training and had to constantly watch what she ate.

    Stand-Up Comedy 

-   Margaret Cho jokes about this in her standup special _Assassin_, talking about how women at awards shows always want to show off their collar bones.
    
    (Valley girl accent) "Like oh my god! Look at this bone! Do you see this bone? I'm like, totally emaciated! Look at this bone, I'm almost dead! Like, look at this bone!"
    

    Toys 

-   Barbie is probably the most famous offender of this trope. Countless studies have been done trying to determine what she would look like if she were a real woman. They all say a wide variety of different things, but most come to a conclusion that can be summarized thus: "She would be extremely unhealthy, and her body type is virtually impossible for a real woman to attain." To be exact, they said that she would be unhealthily thin, six feet tall in her bare feet, have feet too small to walk with, and have a long, serpentine neck. This<small>◊</small> is a good image showing just how ridiculous Barbie's proportions really are.
-   The male counterpart would be newer _G.I. Joe_ figures. If blown up to full size, they would have roughly 25-inch biceps. For comparison, jacked-as-all-hell Mark McGwire had about 22 inches at his peak, and Hulk Hogan, at his steroid-laced hugest, would brag about his 24-inch, which were really only around 21-22 inch, "pythons".
-   Bratz are this. They've probably done less physical damage than Barbie, though, because their bodies are more stylized, with features bordering on Animesque. That being said, the doll line remains controversial for other reasons, as detailed in the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls's annual report.

    Video Games 

-   Square Enix: In the later years had started to develop several characters that can be considered unhealthily thin, around the time of the Play Station 3 era, with Lightning starting the trend of characters being really skinny for their line of work, unless the character had a more developed figure in canon, most characters had a very thin physique. Women were the most affected characters, but men were also hit by this.

    Visual Novels 

-   Averted in _Double Homework_. Not one of the girls is super thin. In fact, Rachel (whom the protagonist dated before) has an athletic build, the protagonist says flat-out that he finds the average-bodied Daniela attractive, and in Lauren’s epilogue, he mentions her curves as his favorite thing about her body.
-   Sophia from _Melody_ is extraordinarily petite.

    Webcomics 

-   _Ciem Webcomic Series_: Ciem is the closest to this that Machinomics are capable of committing. Almost every female character uses the same custom "Barbie" mesh (Zenman's Curvy Default Replacement at Mod The Sims, with size B breasts.) Candi herself is extremely prone to narrowly avoiding being the poster girl for Hollywood Thin, especially as a teen. Her sisters, however, are implied to be slightly curvier with their clothes off; though there is little evidence in the written canon. Then again, since her sisters aren't superheroes, their being thinner is tolerated, if not actually justified: not having Candi's job gives them an excuse to be laz(-ier).
-   Cinna Grossul of _Pacificators_ is one. However, it's not for Fanservice - her teammate Daryl Smithson is doing her best to get Cinna to eat more. It's actually given Cinna some trouble; for example, she's particularly susceptible to wind attacks, which could easily pick her up and toss her away. Blow Her Away, indeed.

    Web Original 

    Western Animation 

-   Nearly every woman in the show _Tripping the Rift_. _All_ of them, human and alien alike, have wasp waists and _massive_ racks. T'nuck's race is the major exception.
    -   (Sort of) justified in the case of Six, as she's a gynoid created to appeal to repressed nerds.
-   Clever show that it was, _Sabrina: The Animated Series_ featured a character design for the girls that was just unsettling as far as their skin-and-bones stature was concerned. And the show even had an episode where two girls desire to lose weight to fit into a pair of jeans that only come in one size. Admittedly it did deliver An Aesop about body image but Harvey going on about a "creepy skinny girl" and Hilda and Zelda calling the model "scrawny" is undermined slightly by having Sabrina and Chloe being almost just as twig thin normally.
-   The girls in _Winx Club_ have small waists and really wide hips (their hips are drawn even wider from Season 5 onward). Kinda justified for the main characters and their magical friends (with their magical insect wings, it doesn't seem so strange that they have an insect-like body structure).
-   Nearly every female character in _Danny Phantom_ has a small waist, generous rear end, and curvy legs. Even the dead ones. And his middle-aged mom.
-   Same goes for _Fairly OddParents_. They are the Trope Namer for Hartman Hips.
-   Taken to the extreme in _The Simpsons_. In the episode "Sleeping With The Enemy," we see a child model who weights so little she's reputed to have gone back to her birth weight, and becomes too thin to see should one look at her from the side.
-   The casts of _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls_ and _Littlest Pet Shop (2012)_ couple this with cartoonishly oversized heads and legs that would occupy two thirds of their height were it not for said oversized heads.
-   _Kim Possible_: In one episode, Kim states that Bonnie is 105 pounds. Her height is never stated but she looks taller than 5'3. 105 is underweight even for an active cheerleader. Despite this, Bonnie doesn't look nearly as small as she's stated to be.
-   _Family Guy_ takes aim at this - in one episode, Kate Moss is depicted as so thin as to be two-dimensional<small>◊</small>. She's blown out of the window by a stiff breeze<small>◊</small>, and falls through a gap in the floorboards<small>◊</small>.
    -   In another episode, Lois becomes a model, and is given diet pills by her agent in order to 'keep up' with other models. She and other models compare the visibility of their ribcages<small>◊</small>, and play tunes on them with xylophone mallets.
