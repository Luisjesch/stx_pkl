A God or similar creates a world or similar. Unlike a Creation Myth, the creation is part of the actual story, not just its background.

In fantasy and mythology, this is sometimes the first chapter of the story, starting from the _very_ beginning. Other times, it happens as a significant plot point in the middle of the story or as its end.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Milk Closet_ has this as Liesl's true plan — while 600 universes already exist, she aims to absorb them all into one and create a brand-new universe from them. Her plan goes south very quickly once her husband figures out what she plans to do, but the main characters are able to finish the plan by using themselves as the incubator and cradle.

     Comic Books 

-   In _Lucifer_, two universes get created. Each creation get its own chapter detailing the process of creation.
-   _The Sandman (1989)_: Inverted in the graphic novel _A Game of You_. A world is destroyed by its maker, but this act of uncreation is portrayed as inverting the act of creating it.

     Fan Works 

-   _Elementals of Harmony_: Two chapters in _Sideboard of Harmony_, "How Pinkie Got Her Cutie Mark" and "Fiat Harmonia", focus on how Pinkie created Equestria’s plane, Ungula, to fulfill a Stable Time Loop and ensure her own existence. Entropy was incarnated in Discord to prevent Ungula from being destroyed by uncontrolled entropy like other Planeswalker-made planes usually are, with Faust coming into being as incarnate order due to Ungula’s nature seeking balance. Eventually, Faust made a pink sun to have something to look at besides empty void, a moon to balance it, and a planet to have somewhere to rest on, with Discord accidentally popping the sun and moon, hatching Celestia and Luna and creating the actual Sun and Moon. They then go on to create the landscape, life and ponies. In doing so, Faust overexerts herself, going into hibernation and transforming into the Elements, causing Discord to grow more and more mentally unbalanced and leading into canon history.
-   _The God Empress of Ponykind_: The early chapters of the story focus on the Emperor/Celestia, stranded on a barren, molten world, using her powers and science to terraform it and seed it with increasingly complex life over millions of years, before creating Luna and eventually ponykind.
-   _The Many Secret Origins of Scootaloo_: Tydal’s chapter focuses on a retelling of how the Creator made the world, from her perspective. Apparently, it was more like a young child making a playmat and toys to play with than anything, later moving on to hobby-like customizing as a "teen". The gods such as Tydal, Discord and the Princesses were made when she decided she wanted "Top Toys" to oversee the rest.
-   The _Pony POV Series_:
    -   It's explained on a few occasions, but the basic story is that the Four Elders and their children (the Alicorns and Draconequi) crafted the universe, with the Alicorns setting up the Big Bang and it being implied Destruction set it off. Celestia was annoyed it'd take a long time for life to evolve. The individual deities apparently created various species at some point after that. This is also a circular process that has happened over and over: the universe lives out its lifespan, beings in it moving on to their afterlives, until finally Heat Death happens, at which point Entropy devours the dead universe to make room for a new one, which the Elders take the time between to set up the foundations for the next universe.
    -   "The Rise of Tirek", Tirek's Origin Story, is basically this for the world as ponies know it, as Tirek destroyed the Centaur civilization and drove them to extinction, after which the ponies were uplifted by the Rainbows of Light and Darkness, leading to the present civilization.
-   _Eternal (MLP)_: Before time itself, ten mystical proto-ponies were created to help bring the universe into balance. These unicorn-like beings created several pony races in their image, however they didn't make unicorns because they felt superior to their creations. Later on, the firstborn created the stars and brought light to the universe.

     Film 

-   _Titan A.E._ ends with the heroes using the Titan to create a new world, a home planet for mankind to replace the one they lost in the Downer Beginning.
-   _TRON: Legacy_ is very much about Flynn and Clu building a world together. This is ancient history when the story begins, but the flashbacks are frequent.

     Literature 

-   _The Last Question_, a short story by Isaac Asimov, revolves around the question of rejuvenating and ultimately recreating the universe.
-   _The Bible_ begins with God creating the heavens and the earth.
-   _The Magician's Nephew_, the sixth book of _The Chronicles of Narnia_ (in writing order — chronologically it's the first) has almost the entire cast witnessing as Aslan creates the titular world.

-   In _Eric_, the main characters are magically thrown back in time and meet the Creator as he's making the Discworld. ... and accidentally take part. All life on the Disc apparently descends from the bacteria on a sandwich they left behind.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Lucifer (2016)_: Lucifer tells his therapist how the universe was created, couched in terms she'll understand. Apparently the actual Big Bang was caused by God and Lucifer's mother having sex ("You never knew how appropriate that term was, did you?"), and then they built a house called Heaven and filled it with their children, the angels. Then their father started spending all his time in the garage working on a project called "humanity," while their mother became cold and emotionally distant. Lucifer got in an argument with his father and got kicked out of the house, and then a few thousand years later his mother got thrown out as well.

     Webcomics 

-   In _Homestuck_, creating universes is the whole point of Sburb, and the kids' universe was created by the trolls' session. The story ends with the main characters entering the new universe they have made, while sequels and spinoffs explore life on the planet most likely to host the next Sburb game.
-   In _Alice and the Nightmare_, professor Dymond starts her history lesson with telling the students the creation story of Wonderland, even name-checking the trope.
