Jesus' typical outfit (the long hair, beard, sandals one. Not the sword in mouth, albino Revelations one that may or may not be him<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ) and message (at least, parts of it - spread love and peace, leave behind your old life) nowadays makes one think of a hippie. Of course, the connection came the other way round - the hippies followed their model of Jesus.

So nowadays you often see Jesus depicted like this. Not just looking the way, but also acting much like it. Because, even in eras when short haircuts, shaven faces, and fancy suits were the norm, the character was always portrayed "looking like a hippie." Expect him to quote the music of the times and passing it off as scripture.

    open/close all folders 

    Anime and Manga 

-   In _Saint Young Men_, Jesus has something of a quirky, mellow, hippie-esque personality and wears his thorns like a hippie headband. At one point a conservative old Japanese man yelled at him for being a 'longhair hippie'.

    Comic Books 

-   In _Battle Pope_, Jesus is a hippie sidekick of the titular character, and not anywhere near as cool as most depictions..
-   A 1970s Underground Comics series featured Jesus in the present day, constantly being made out to be a hippie (usually by people who don't like hippies).
-   In Marvel Comics, the 1970s alien character Wundarr the Aquarian fit the bill, especially since his powers let him do things like walk on water.

    Fanfiction 

-   The _Good Omens_ fanfic _Manchester Lost_ has Jesus come in as a 'Southern Hippy'. Jesus is even listed as such in the character list.

    Literature 

-   _The Salvation War_ takes this interpretation to its logical conclusion and makes him an Erudite Stoner. Or so it seems at first.

     Live Action TV  

-   Referenced in _Red Dwarf_, when Rimmer dismisses their "High" selves as hippies.
    
    **Kryten**: Sir, you think Jesus was a hippie.
    
    **Rimmer**: Well, he was! He had long hair and didn't have a job! What more do you want?
    

    Theatre 

-   _Jesus Christ Superstar_ portrayed Christ and the Apostles as hippies.
-   In the stage play turned movie _Godspell_, Jesus and his followers are usually shown in hippie-ish or clownish (or both) type clothing...
-   One of many fictional Jesus archetypes Hedda and Mammy encounter in Jeff Whitty's play _The Further Adventures of Hedda Gabler_ is like this.
-   _The Book of Mormon_ has Jesus speaking like a stoner.

    Video Games 

-   Not exactly Jesus himself, but quite close - Kunino-sagiri from _Persona 4_ is seen wearing a stereotypical hippie outfit, complete with the "peace" motif. The messianic resemblances are probably intentional considering his twisted vision of "saving people".
-   _Grand Theft Auto V_ has a minor character named Jesse who is essentially this, a Jesus Christ lookalike/impersonator who soapboxes on Del Perro Pier while acting like a stereotypical hippie.

    Webcomics 

    Western Animation 

-   _Lucy, the Daughter of the Devil_ has DJ Jésus, a hippy/DJ second coming.
-   Jesús, the Mexican-accented carpentry teacher and clone of the historical Jesus from _Clone High_, is not exactly a _hippie_, but he is a bit of a slacker and appears to be a stoner. He's also a little clumsy with his nail gun.
