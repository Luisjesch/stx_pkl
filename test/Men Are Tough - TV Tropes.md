_"The greatest joy for a man is to defeat his enemies, to drive them before him, to take from them all they possess, to see those they love in tears, to ride their horses, and to hold their wives and daughters in his arms."_

An Omnipresent Super-Trope and Brother Trope to Women Are Delicate. It can be assumed to exist in every form of media unless otherwise stated. For a number of reasons, fiction tends to treat men as the stronger, hardier, more reliable, and more resilient of the two genders. In most forms of human society, the assumption is that women are the more delicate of the sexes and are more suited for nurturing than the more aggressive roles undertaken by males of the species. This creates the assumption that _every_ man is a natural badass or _should_ be. This may be because Most Writers Are Male, or the implication that Men Act, Women Are.

This Stereotype has two forms:

1.  Unilateral: Men are naturally tough, strong, competent, capable, aggressive, stubborn, blunt, or dominant.
2.  Bilateral: Men are stronger, tougher, or more blunt, dominant or aggressive **than women and/or inferior men**. In this form, even if a man shows more passive, submissive, or weaker qualities, he either shows less of them than his female peers, there is a weaker man to juxtapose with him (unless he _is_ the weaker man), or he compensates for it in some other area.

Regardless, a man being in a dominant, physical role is seen as natural while a woman in the same role is treated as exceptional. Even if a woman _does_ take on a physical role, there still exist tropes which portray her as less tough than her male counterparts such as Guys Smash, Girls Shoot; Male Might, Female Finesse; She-Fu; or Waif-Fu.

However, the Double Standard has a negative effect for men, too. Men are often treated as the expendable gender or the only ones capable of being abusive. Further, because the toughness bar is raised for men, a Non-Action Guy will be more harshly criticized than a female counterpart. He will also have to take greater risks and perfom more physical forms of combat. In Guys Smash, Girls Shoot, he'd _better_ be the one smashing even if he's more skilled at shooting.

Further, men are often portrayed as not being capable of anything BUT physical force to make their points. Often despite the target audience being themselves male, guys are portrayed as dumb, childlike, blunt instruments who can't do anything right if it involves becoming "domesticated". When that happens, a former badass will turn into a Jaded Washout, and possibly a Fat Slob. His only means of domestic problem-solving will involve Percussive Maintenance or Tim Taylor Technology with marginal degrees of success. When it comes to their own children, domesticated men will often be bumbling wrecks, over-compensating in aggression, or completely disinterested altogether. In short, these domesticated men are portrayed as having something "wrong" with them, due to being removed from fields of violence, power, or non-domestic achievement. In the event that a man is not acting like the in-charge, tough guy he should be, the only things that can cure him are Tough Love or Percussive Therapy (especially if the percussion is on HIM).

Also, please keep in mind that the word chosen to represent this trope was "tough". In addition to physical force or power, "tough" also means resilient, stubborn, slow to change, dense, and inflexible, which are also ways men are stereotyped. We intentionally chose a polysemic word for this trope because Tropes Are Flexible, and like all stereotypes, this one has changed (and will change) a LOT as people attempt to use it or downplay it.

No Examples, Please. This should be an index of tropes, and nothing else.

-   White Male Lead: The most common protagonist template in Western media, as a consequence of men being considered the generic "default". It may also be a WASP. It falls under the "men are dominant" aspect of this trope because part of the dominant/centrist attitudes toward men comes from how normalized it is to see them as the center of a story or the person who drives a story.

    Zig-Zagged 

**Tropes in this section tend to showcase a man with both tough qualities and more delicate ones, or two or more characters with juxtaposing characteristics.**

-   Action-Hero Babysitter: A man is cast in the nurturing role of caretaker, but using tough, badass skills to get the job done. It is typically Played for Laughs.
-   All Gays are Promiscuous: The logic of this trope is that gay men are still _men_, and thus still only want sex, but "marriage" is only for straight couples. Thus, gay men (and sometimes women) have "free rein" to act as promiscuously as they dare.
-   All the Good Men Are Gay: A character or narrative insists that all or most straight men are lustful, aggressive, and filled with Testosterone Poisoning. Therefore, women can more easily find a compassionate, wise, and sensitive guy if he's gay and thus In Touch with His Feminine Side. The female character that feels this way might become a Fag Hag with lots of platonic gay friends, or she might attempt to "turn a good man straight".
-   Beard of Sorrow: A manly way of showing emotions, usually used to show that he's lost touch with society and let his appearance slide.
-   Big Guy, Little Guy: A partnership between a huge guy (usually Dumb Muscle) and a smaller guy (usually the Brains).
-   Bromantic Foil: A raunchy, headstrong, and often perverted male friend or companion which makes another male (usually the protagonist) look well-adjusted or normal by comparison.
-   Casanova Wannabe: A man who believes he's a ladies man, but has substantial flaws in his approach.
-   Caught Coming Home Late: A husband sneaks home after doing some sort of activity his wife disapproves of and thinks he's gotten away with it until he hits the light switch and she's standing in wait. Simultaneously reinforces that husbands are untrustworthy/immature liars and cheats, and that wives are nagging shrews.
-   Compensating for Something: A man who lacks a stereotypical component of an ideal man (usually penis size) compensates for his lacking in some other stereotypical manner.
-   Cuckold: A man whose woman is having sex with another person(s). The "Bull" (her lover) is almost **always** another man because otherwise the effect is lessened. Her infidelity is played for the humiliation and emasculation of the cuckolded man, the sexual depravity of the wife, and to portray the Bulls as "superior" men. The scenario is used for the titillation of the audience. The cultural implication is that any man who fails to satisfy his wife, and "tame" her, is less of a man while the men that succeed are "real" men.
    -   Netorare: A fan term for Japanese cuckold porn.
-   Droit du Seigneur: A new bride is forced to spend her honeymoon with a more powerful nobleman before she is "returned" to her new husband. Subtrope of Cuckold.
-   Emotional Bruiser: A badass who fights with his emotions on his sleeve. It's considered unusual for pragmatic, stoic and tough males.
-   Gentleman and a Scholar: A man who is both educated and adept in culture. He may be a Non-Action Guy, but he is also rational, stable, and elegant.
-   Give Geeks a Chance: A plot in which a geeky, unmanly guy has trouble gaining female companionship. Until he finds the one girl who is different, or otherwise proves that he is manly or successful enough to "deserve" a girl. Rarely gender-inverted.
-   Hot Guy, Ugly Wife: Considered a rare and ironic inversion to the Ugly Guy, Hot Wife trope; if a wife isn't sexually attractive, then her value as a mate is considered diminished.
-   Have I Mentioned I Am Heterosexual Today?: A man reminds everyone that he is not homosexual, because that would be "terrible".
-   I Was Beaten by a Girl: Being beaten by a girl is considered insulting for a tough guy.
-   Little Guy, Big Buddy: A small character (not necessarily a guy) is accompanied by a huge, powerful friend as a protector (_usually_ a guy).
-   Loser Gets the Girl: Two men fight over a woman, but unexpectedly, the one that wins isn't the one that gets her. The trope still treats the woman as a "prize", with the subversion being that the dominant one isn't the one awarded.
-   Manly Tears: Men crying or showing tears. However, these men are usually not shown as emotionally broken or distraught, and only as a moment of "weakness" or irrationality.
-   Noble Male, Roguish Male: A contrast between a more socially-adept and proper man, and a rebellious, roguish outsider. The idea is to compare two models of masculinity.
-   Non-Action Snarker: A man who is not physically tough, but compensates for it with an abrasive or cynical attitude.
-   Papa Wolf: A man who fights to defend his younger charges or children. Usually the go-to portrayal for a fatherly role in an action setting.
-   Prince Charming: A dashing, handsome man who arrives to romance and/or rescue a waiting female.
-   Prince Charming Wannabe: He's not as dashing/handsome as he believes. The woman may scoff at his rescue.
-   Prince Charmless: A prince that has no tact, social skills, or charms whatsoever.
-   Real Men Cook: Manliness is paramount to being able to use fire to prepare food. Cooking is is usually associated with feminine traits, but in this case, the ability to master such a skill is considered manly. (For example: in fiction, maids and housewives can cook, but a Master Chef is usually male.)
-   Samus Is a Girl: A tough and badass character appears and, to everyone's shock, reveals that they are a girl.
-   Sensitive Guy and Manly Man: Two men that contrast each other in regards to toughness.
-   Shirtless Captives: A male character is taken hostage and stripped from the waist up. An Always Male trope because topless women don't have the same impact.
-   Testosterone Poisoning: Parodies of manliness meant to draw laughs instead of awe.
-   Ukefication: A powerful or tough guy is assigned stereotypical Uke traits in order to ship him into a romantic relationship (usually with another man).
-   Would Hit a Girl: Hitting a female is considered reprehensible, no matter the reason, but not hitting a guy. This character would hit both.

    Played With 

**Tropes in this section are tangentially related to this trope, in that they likely would not exist if this trope was not the default assumption. These tropes are typically "exceptions" to this trope—but with some sort of baggage that examines the negative consequences of men failing to be tough, or the benefits of measuring women that have the same capability of men. However, the relation has become woven with so many societal complexities that they cannot directly be considered subtropes or aversions.**

-   Badass Family: Similar to Battle Couple, but with every member of the family being just as awesome.
-   Battle Couple: In heterosexual relationships, having both a man and woman that are tough is treated as remarkable.
-   Bested at Bowling: A man thinks he'll do great at bowling, but his female friend outperforms him.
-   Brains and Brawn: When paired with Women Are Wiser, Men Are Tough becomes the brawn half of this trope. Also can be used in arguments in defense of brawn and against brains, as in "Reading books isn't manly. Real men are tough."
-   Bumbling Dad: A man is portrayed as incompetent at a domestic task like raising children.
-   Camp Gay: An effeminate man who is attracted to men.
-   Dogged Nice Guy: A Nice Guy who is interested in a female companionship, but is stuck in the Friend Zone.

-   Effeminate Misogynistic Guy: A misogynist who hates women despite displaying the stereotypical characteristics of one. Perhaps to show that he can do it "better".

-   Fat Slob: A man who is uncultured, slovenly, and overweight.
-   Female Groin Invincibility: Females are immune to groin attacks; usually used as an "empowering" moment for a female character versus her male counterparts.
-   Fetishized Abuser: A man mistreats his fragile girlfriend (or a less sociopathic boyfriend), but it's played for the titillation of a female audience. Alternatively, an abusive, creepy, or violent woman is played for fetish.
-   Genius Bruiser: Defying the notion that strength or toughness equals stupidity. However, this trope would not exist if Dumb Muscle wasn't common as well. It's also possible have both Dumb Muscle _and_ a Genius Bruiser in the same story.
-   Henpecked Husband: A husband who is nagged, abused, or derided by his wife. It implies that the man is weak-willed, and/or that his wife is irrational or bitter.
-   Jaded Washout: His glory days have passed long ago, and he cannot adjust to a new life.
-   Ladykiller in Love: Being a Casanova comes at odds with finding a One True Love. Again, it carries the connotations that a sexually-aggressive man is unused to more delicate or romantic feelings.
-   Lazy Husband: A man is portrayed as a do-nothing while his wife does all of the work both in home and out.
-   Literal Maneater: A cannibalistic or monstrous female character who lures unsuspecting men to her so that they'll become her dinner.

-   NEET: A college-aged male who is portrayed as a Butt-Monkey, due to being a do-nothing layabout with no ambitions.
-   Nerd Nanny: A bunch of nerdy guys who have No Social Skills are often accompanied by a beautiful, popular, decidedly _non-geeky_ girl who would otherwise be considered "out of their league".
-   Power Hair: Feminine traits are seen as weak or undesirable in positions of power, so a woman in that position cuts her hair to be more masculine.
-   Rookie Male, Experienced Female: A male character (typically an Everyman Audience Surrogate) is new to the setting of the story opposite of his veteran female companion. But commonly, this leads her to become a Quickly-Demoted Woman.
-   Screams Like a Little Girl: A man that screams like a vulnerable, terrified woman for comedic effect or contrast.
-   Sissy Villain: A villain who is campy, effeminate, and evil. The association can imply that those traits go hand-in-hand.
-   The Slacker: Men in a domestic or social setting are shown as do-nothing layabouts. It has become a more reoccurring trope in modern fiction, as the Everyman has gained popularity.
-   Speed Sex: A man who climaxes too fast during sex is lacking what it takes to be a satisfactory sex partner, possibly opening the door for her to cheat or leave him.
-   Straw Misogynist: An extreme misogynist that goes way over the top in bashing women or femininity. Used to push the point that misogyny is really, really bad, but lacks any sort of ambiguity.
-   Teeny Weenie: A man with a small penis is considered to be "less manly".
-   Tiny Schoolboy: A preteen or teenage boy who's shorter than all the other kids his age and is embarrassed about it. Since Tall, Dark, and Handsome is universally seen as attractive and manly, this character sticks out more and is an easy target of being teased and not being taken seriously by potential female partners.
-   Unlucky Everydude: An Everyman who does not know his way with women and generally incompetent in other areas. It's usually implying that this is the typical male condition. While it demonstrates a discomfort with women which is far from the idealized manly man, the "unlucky" portion also implies that this is a bad thing.
-   Unmanly Secret: A man who strives to be manly has a secret which reveals him to be In Touch with His Feminine Side.
-   Useless Boyfriend: A man does nothing to assist in day-to-day life with his far more pragmatic and forward-thinking girlfriend.
