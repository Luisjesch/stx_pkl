_"They don't have any food stored for the winter!_ (sob) _AND IT'S ALL MY FAAAULT!"_

You see characters blaming themselves for major messes fairly often, especially when they're not the only ones who are suffering as a result. It's a universal phrase used in every genre and medium.

Frequent replies:

-   "It's not your fault": A stock reply to an apology, and like the main phrase, it's often followed by why. Often implies the main phrase as well. "There's no way you could have foreseen this" is also popular as is "You Did Everything You Could" when the other failed to prevent bad things from happening.
-   "I am also to blame"/"We're _all_ to blame": As stated above, when the penitent one is neither completely blameless nor solely to blame.
-   "So what are you going to do about it?": This puts the emphasis on fixing the problem rather than assigning blame and offers the character a chance to redeem himself by cleaning up the mess he made.

In the future, it is likely that a Big Bad, The Rival, or an Evil Counterpart will take some opportunity to remind the character of this culpability.

May be the result of failing to make amends. May end up being a Career-Building Blunder. May be uttered by someone laboring under The Chains of Commanding. See also My God, What Have I Done?, in which case it typically _is_ all "my" fault, and "I" have just realized the consequences of "my" actions, and Failure-to-Save Murder. When death ensued, see These Hands Have Killed. If a character has so many It's All My Fault moments that it becomes almost a character trait, it's a Guilt Complex. Characters may irrationally think of this if I Wished You Were Dead. Contrast with Never My Fault. May lead to a Guilt-Induced Nightmare.

        **Superman:** There! I can see Supergirl — and Krypto?! Great Scott, what's he doing there? Supergirl must have summoned him — and now they're fighting those warships against impossible odds! NO! They're hit! They're going down — And it's MY FAULT!

        **Lana Lang:** That wasn't your fault and you know it —  
        **Kara:** It doesn't matter whose fault you think it was, Lana! 80,000 people were put in danger because of something I did... and then Supergirl couldn't save any of them.
        
    -   In _Crucible_, Maxima blames herself for taking Kon to the titular space academy, where he was captured by Korstus. When she apologizes to Kara, though, her friend replies Maxima shouldn't blame herself because she couldn't know what would happen.

At one point, Lex talks about his sister Lena to his cellmate Sam, unaware that Sam holds a grudge against Lena's husband. After learning Sam paid other crooks to gaslight Lena into committing suicide, Lex apologizes to his sister, admitting it was his fault for babbling about her private life to his jailmates.
    -   In _Escape from the Phantom Zone_, Supergirl apologizes to Batgirl and Ben Rubel for being unable to stop them from falling into the Phantom Zone.

    -   _The Plague of the Antibiotic Man_: Believing his old enemy Nam-Ek is responsible for the mysterious plague spreading across Central City, Superman fights him.

        **Superman**: "The Flash is critically injured... Lois Lane is dying! Central City will die, too— and then the whole world! It's all my fault— because I've just killed the only being in the universe who can save it!"''
        
    -   _Let My People Grow!_:
        -   When Superman collapses after being battered by a supernova, Supergirl blames herself for not having gone with him...even though it is not clear that she would have achieved other than passing out alongside him, which would have prevented her from catching him when he plummeted towards the ground.
            
            **Supergirl:** _"Obviously, what we both feared came true— not even a Superman could endure the fury of a supernova— This is all my fault— I knew it would be dangerous— I should have insisted on going with him— If he doesn't recover, I'll never forgive myself."_
            
        -   Superman blames himself when Kandor falls apart and turns to dust because he did not test his enlarging ray on inanimate objects.

    -   _Supergirl (1984)_: Kara blames herself for the loss of the Omegahedron, the matter-transmuting device which keeps her space city's life support systems, even though her mentor Zaltar gets the lion's share of the blame: Zaltar "borrowed" the Omegahedron to satisfy his artistic curiosity. When Kara's mother walked into his chambers, he gave Kara one of his gadgets to keep both her and Alura distracted as he hid the Omegahedron. Unfortunately, Kara playing with his reality-warping device accidentally caused the Omegahedron to be sucked into the vacuum of space.
        
        **Kara:** _"They'll never understand! It's my fault the Omegahedron ins gone...and it's up to me to get it back!"_
        
-   _Fantastic Four_: Reed Richards tends to blame himself for a lot of things that happen to his family. Part of it is semi-justified because the accident that gave them their powers and effectively ruined their quiet, ordinary lives really _was_ his fault. However, he also believes that because he is so incredibly intelligent, any misfortune that they can't avoid is automatically his fault for not pulling a brilliant solution out of his ass. Naturally, his Arch-Enemy, Doctor Doom, is not only one of the most rabid adherents of this trope's diametric opposite, he also further aggravates Reed's issues by narrowing his Never My Fault down to Always Reed Richards' Fault.
-   _Spider-Man_:
    -   Spidey blames himself for the death of Uncle Ben, as he was jerk looking out just for himself back then, and let a criminal escape... who killed Ben later. His whole super hero career is an attempt to atone for it. In recent times, he blames himself for just about _everything_ that goes wrong to anybody in his life. So much so that it's become something of a joke for the fandom.
    -   He even lampshades this several times in _New Avengers_, as in the first arc he says that the rest of the team can blame the prison break at the Raft on him if they want, seeing as the press is going to.
    -   In _The Amazing Spider-Man (Dan Slott)_ #654, when J. Jonah Jameson's wife Marla took a fatal blow for him, Jonah refused to blame Spider-Man (significant given that Jameson is usually the first to blame Spidey for anything and everything) and even came right out and said that it was _his_ fault.
-   At the climax of _Siege_, Loki actually accepts responsibility for the consequences of his actions namely, the near-destruction of Asgard at the hands of the Sentry/Void, and provides aid to the heroes in an attempt to mitigate the damage and is slain by the Sentry in the process. This absolutely couldn't be a trick or anything... wait a minute.
-   Klara Prast of _Runaways_ blames herself for the death of Old Lace, who took the brunt of an explosion in which they'd both been caught. Unlike most examples of this trope, she was actually encouraged to think this way by teammates Chase and Victor for petty reasons (Chase was understandably upset about the loss of his pet dinosaur, while Victor didn't want anyone to realize that he was responsible for the accident that led to the explosion.)
    -   In "It's Not Lupus", a one-shot set before the above-mentioned accident, she assumes that it's her fault that Molly suddenly fell ill, despite the fact that she had nothing to do with Molly's illness.
-   In _Society of Super-Heroes: Conquerors of the Counter-World #1_, the Mighty Atom believes he was responsible for the arrival of the Earth-40 villains, citing that their invasion had begun not long after he looked into the cursed comic book Doc Fate warned him not to read.
-   _Anderson: Psi-Division_: Anderson blames herself for being unable to prevent a nuclear bombing that costs the lives of 500,000 people after receiving a psychic vision.
-   _Black Moon Chronicles_: Wismerhill blames himself for the end of the world after Haazheel Thorn uses his last ounce of magic to cause the Black Moon to crash into the Earth, but the Oracle tells him that every possible path would have led him here.
-   _Star Wars: Princess Leia_: Beneath the façade of stoic resolve, Leia is struggling with the emotional burden of her homeworld's destruction and her father's death, which she feels is directly due to her open defiance of the Empire. She has no friends to speak of (her relationship with Han, Luke, and Chewie hasn't had time to develop yet), and she has no surviving family to turn to. So she sets out with another Alderaanian rebel to rally the survivors of their homeworld's destruction and find them a new home.
-   _PS238_: Played for laughs after the tragic "death" of Moon Shadow:
-   X-23 is highly prone to this due to the guilt she carries over all the killings she committed under the Facility's control. Although she does come to accept she's as much a victim as the people she killed, Laura is nonetheless quick to accept blame for her actions.
-   _Dynamo5_: In Dynamo 5 #17, when Scatterbrain enters Maddie Warner’s unconscious as she lies comatose, it is revealed that she tends to accept a disproportionate amount of responsibility for various unfortunate events in her life and harbors guilt over those incidents. Be it when a supervillain escapes, when Captain Dynamo is unable to save people's lives, or her personal relationships fail, like when her relationship with her former fiance Tom falls apart because of her secret life and the fact that she could not tell him she was an agent of F.L.A.G., a U.S. government organization that deals with threats posed by superhuman beings, though she used the cover of an award-winning investigative journalist. Or when her marriage to Captain Dynamo/William Warner became strained because of his Dynamo's career as a costumed crimefighter often kept him away from home for extended periods of time, and, unknown to her, Dynamo's absences were partially due to the numerous extramarital affairs that he had. It was by Scatterbrain's convincing Warner of her need to move beyond her guilt that he was able to bring her out of the coma.
-   _The Ultimates_: Betty blames herself for all the destruction that Hulk caused. She thinks that, if she hadn't been so harsh with Bruce, perhaps he wouldn't have injected himself with the Hulk serum.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog (IDW)_: Sonic wholeheartedly blames himself for the Metal Virus outbreak, kicking himself for sparing the amnesiac Eggman under the belief that he could do good. Thanks to Starline and Metal Sonic, this led to Eggman regaining his memories and unleashing the Metal Virus on the world, essentially starting a Zombie Apocalypse.

    Films — Animation 

-   From _Beauty and the Beast_, Belle says this after she's comforting the dying Beast.
-   In _Brave_, finally admitting their own roles in everything that went wrong is an essential bit of Character Development for both Merida and Elinor.
-   This is essentially the plot point of _Finding Nemo_. Marlin's overprotectiveness leads to Nemo rebelling and disobeying him by swimming out to a boat, which leads to Nemo getting captured by humans and Marlin driven to do everything to get back his son.
-   In _Kung Fu Panda 2_, after she tends to Po's wounds when Lord Shen leaves him for dead, the Soothsayer shows him what remains of his childhood home. She admits that she blames herself for what happened to the pandas, and by extension Po's family, as she was the one who told Shen of the prophecy.
    
    **Soothsayer:** This was a thriving village. Young Shen was in line to rule Gongmen City, but he wanted more. I foretold that someone would stand in his way; a panda. But I _never_ could have foretold what came next.
    
-   In _The Lion King (1994)_, Simba spends most of the movie believing that he killed his father mostly due to his Uncle's manipulations and tries to hide from the rest of the pride in shame.
-   _Aladdin_ does this on occasion, in both the series and films. In the first film, Jasmine says "It's all my fault" after Aladdin is taken captive. It's actually Jafar's fault since he'd have needed Aladdin and had the guards capture him whether Jasmine got involved or not. Then Aladdin says it after Jafar steals the lamp and takes over Agrabah, which partly IS Aladdin's fault for not setting Genie free.
    -   This instance from "The Spice is Right" is probably the best example:
-   In _Murderess_, the protagonist Lu seems to think little of herself and blame herself thoroughly even when killing in self-defence.
-   Angry declaration: Quasimodo, upon seeing Esmeralda being put on a stake in Disney's _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_.
    -   Also inverted during the song "Hellfire", where Frollo keeps telling himself it's _not_ his fault for being obsessed with Esmeralda while singing about her burning in hell and the red-robed choir representing his conscience contradicts him.
        
        "It's not my fault!" (_mea culpa_ ("Through my fault"))  
        "I'm not to blame!" (_mea culpa_("Through my fault"))  
        "It is the Gypsy girl, the witch who set this flame!" (_mea maxima culpa_ ("Through my most grevious fault"))  
        "It's not my fault!" (_mea culpa_ ("Through my fault"))  
        "If in God's plan!" (_mea culpa_ ("Through my fault"))  
        "He made the devil so much stronger than a man!" (_mea maxima culpa_ ("Through my most grevious fault"))
        
-   In _Snoopy, Come Home_, Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy, and Peppermint Patty all blame themselves for Snoopy's leaving.
-   In _The Tigger Movie_, Tigger starts feeling lonely that he's "the only one", so his friends write a letter to make him feel better, but it backfires spectacularly when he believes that it's from his real family, and that they're visiting him the next day. After several attempts to tell Tigger the truth about the letter fail, the others decide to pose as Tiggers so as not to upset him. However, Roo's disguise falls off and Tigger realizes he has been duped. He does not take this well, and still clings onto the letter as legitimate proof his family exists, going as far running off into a dangerous blizzard to go find them. While everyone feels awful about unintentionally hurting Tigger's feelings, it's Roo in particular who blames himself the most, as he begs Pooh to help find Tigger.
    
    **Roo:** (_tearfully_) You've gotta help me find Tigger! It's all my fault! He never would've left if it wasn't 'cause of me! I didn't mean to make him feel bad... I just... I just wanted him to be my big brother...
    
-   Implied in _Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker_. Bruce Wayne (the original Batman) felt guilty for causing Tim Drake (Robin at the time) to suffer Mind Rape at the hands of the Joker. After the incident, in which the Joker is presumably killed, Tim went through a year in rehabilitation and was ordered to turn over his Robin suit, only because Bruce didn't want Tim or any other accomplice to ever suffer again. This is also the reason Bruce refuses to let Terry (the current Batman at the time) find the Joker, as he didn't want Terry to suffer Tim's fate and lace him with even more guilt.
-   _The Incredibles_. With his entire family taken prisoner by Syndrome, Bob Parr apologizes to everyone for getting them into this mess, in an attempt to relive his glory days instead of treasuring his family. As Helen Parr agrees entirely with this assessment, she tries to hush the kids who meanwhile are working on freeing them.
-   In _Frozen II_, Elsa feels immense guilt when she, Anna, and Olaf discover their parents' shipwreck near the Dark Sea, and find out that they died trying to find a way to help Elsa.
-   In _The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature_, Surly quotes this completely when Buddy is lifelessly laid out on a slab in the ruined remains of the nut shop after falling from the balcony of the evil mayor's house.
-   In _Loving Vincent_, Dr. Gachet and his daughter Marguerite blame themselves for Vincent van Gogh's suicide: Marguerite for following her father's advice to stop distracting Vincent from painting (and depriving him of friendship in doing so), and Dr. Gachet for a bitter argument in which he said that Vincent was probably hastening Theo van Gogh's death through stress.
-   Subverted in _The Magic Roundabout (2005)_, where Dougal _doesn't_ take responsibility for releasing Zeebad, until near the end:
    
    **Florence:** Don't blame yourself, Dougal.  
    **Ermintrude:** Let us do that for you.  
    and shortly afterwards:  
    **Brian**: Now, Dougal, you mustn't feel guilty, just because it's all your fault.
    
-   _Happy Heroes: The Stones_: Careless S. feels guilty after he considers the Supermen losing their abilities to be his fault (with an invention he built being involved with the problem), causing him to run away from the Supermen's house some time before Happy S. arrives 10 years into the future.
-   _Ratchet & Clank (2016)_ Ratchet blames himself for falling for Qwark's betrayal which prompts Clank to say "Taking blame isn't the same thing as taking responsibility.''. So Ratchet sets out to confront Qwark once more and save the galaxy from Drek.
-   In _Turning Red_, Ming blames herself for scarring her mother which is valid but believes that incident reflects on her as a person and makes her unworthy of love from anyone.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Bethany_: Claire says this after finding Bethany's dead body. One winter, Claire asked her mom if they could go ice skating, to which she complied. They spent the next eight days in a cabin ice skating and having fun, inadvertently leaving Bethany to starve to death in the cold dark walls, all because she didn't know Bethany was a real person, not her imaginary friend.
-   _The Blair Witch Project_: During the famous apology scene, Heather blames herself for dragging Josh and Mike into the woods with her, breaking down and sobbing about how they're all going to die just because she wanted to make a documentary.
-   _The Blind Side_: Michael feels this way after he is involved in a car accident which injures SJ. It was partially his fault for not paying enough attention while driving, but on the other hand, Michael also saves SJ from suffering more serious injuries or being killed during the accident.

-   Parodied in _Scary Movie 4_.
    
    **Cindy**: I blame myself.  
    **Tom**: As well you should.
    
-   Used in _Monsters Unleashed_ where the Velma, Daphne, and Fred find increasingly ridiculous reasons to blame themselves for something that was clearly Shaggy and Scooby's fault.
-   In _Spider-Man 2_, Peter Parker breaks down and confesses the indirect role he played in Uncle Ben's death to Aunt May. May is initially unable to deal with it and walks off, leaving Peter alone, but she later tells him: "You made a brave move in telling me the truth, and I'm proud of you, and I thank you, and I love you, Peter, so very, very much." Later on in the film, J. Jonah Jameson repeats this phrase word for word, believing that the slander he put into his newspapers was what made Spider-Man quit.
-   Nathan in _Repo! The Genetic Opera_ has this a _lot_, helped along by guilt trips from the Genterns and Marni's ghost.
-   In _Gettysburg_, there is a scene where Lee removes his hat as he looks out upon the survivors of Pickett's Charge, and he actually says this. The men of course try to convince him it wasn't, and some even urge another attempt. This is historically true but apparently Pickett himself disagreed and thought it was mostly or completely Lee's fault that his division was obliterated. Both he and Lee were right.
-   _The Keeping Hours_: On the surface, divorcees Mark and Elizabeth blame each other for the car accident that killed their son Jacob, but it's an obvious thin veil for their guilt over their contributions to the accident (Mark swerving to avoid hitting a dog while it was rainy, Elizabeth second-guessing if she secured Jacob's seatbelt). It was neither of their faults; Jacob took off his seatbelt.
-   _Back to the Future Part II_: Marty, after realizing he was responsible for Biff changing history.
    
    **Doc:** It's all in the past...  
    **Marty:** You mean the future!
    
    -   This turns up a number of times in the Trilogy where Marty realizes how he changed the timeline and starts to panic with Doc realizing that there's no point in getting caught up on what happened.
-   The TV movie _Rent A Kid_ (used to be on Disney or ABC Family sometimes) had a rather creepy dream sequence where a young orphan saw her whole family chanting, "It's all your fault... it's all your fault" at her until she eventually joined in with "It's all my fault."
-   In _Star Trek (2009)_, Spock Prime blames himself for being too late to save Romulus, leading to Nero's actions during the film.
    
    "All of this, Jim, because of me. Because I failed."
    
    -   In the novelisation, we find that the approaching disaster he was trying to prevent unexpectedly accelerated, thus making the fact of his failure not his entire responsibility (except in Nero's eyes).
-   The "it's not your fault" variation was used in an emotionally climactic scene of _Good Will Hunting_ when Robin Williams' character is finally able to crack through Will's last emotional wall and get him to confront his feelings about the abuse he suffered as a kid by just repeating the phrase over and over with a sincere and forgiving tone. Will recognizes what he's doing right away, but eventually breaks down and admits that he HAS been blaming himself.
-   Practically every member of The Brady Bunch goes through this in _A Very Brady Sequel_: After a smuggler kidnaps Carol and ties the children and Alice to the staircase, Bobby, Cindy, Cindy's doll, Peter, Greg, Alice, and Jan each consider something they could have done to foil his scheme, then think "This is all my fault." Marcia actually averted this, and instead thought, "This is all Jan's fault."
-   Chris in _Mrs. Doubtfire_ blames himself after his parents decide to split up following the secret birthday party his father Daniel threw for him, which led to Miranda saying she had had enough and wanted a divorce. Daniel of course reassures that Chris did nothing wrong and this was probably going to happen sooner or later.
-   _Four Weddings and a Funeral_: The protagonist's brother David (who is deaf) interrupts Charles' wedding because he knows the groom loves someone else. Afterwards:
    
    **David:** \[signing\] I blame myself.  
    **Rest of the cast:** No, no, it wasn't your fault, you did nothing wrong, etc.  
    **Charles:** \[signing\] They all blame you too.
    
-   _Star Wars_:
    -   Subverted in _A New Hope_. C-3PO thinks he's responsible for Luke and the others dying in the Death Star's trash compactor.
        
        **C-3PO:** Listen to them! They're dying, R2! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough! _It's all my fault!_ My poor master!  
        **Luke:** 3PO, we're all right! We're all right!
        
    -   In _The Force Awakens_, it's explained that Luke restarted the Jedi Order in the years following _Return of the Jedi_, but it ended when his student and nephew Ben Solo had the Jedi wiped out once again. Luke felt so guilty about what happened that he went into hiding.
    -   _The Last Jedi_ shows what actually happened. Luke sensed The Dark Side building in Ben Solo and prepared to kill him in his sleep, but immediately regretted the impulse. Ben then woke up to see his uncle and master standing over him with an active lightsaber and reacted out of fear, destroying Luke's temple and fully turning to the darkness. Luke blames himself for not seeing the darkness until it was too late and for his one moment of Killing Intent pushing Ben into his Face–Heel Turn.
-   Parodied in _Ghostbusters_, during their first call:
    
    **Ray:** You know, it just occurred to me that we really haven't had a successful test of this equipment.  
    **Egon:** I blame myself.  
    **Peter:** So do I.
    
-   In _Dawn of the Planet of the Apes_, Bright Eyes tells his father Caesar (through sign language) that it the current situation was his fault because he helped assist Koba take the human city, but Caesar (through speech) tells him that it was his fault for trusting Koba in the first place and concludes that humans and apes aren't so different.
-   At the end of _A Face in the Crowd_, Marcia breaks down and says to Mel, "It was my fault—if I'd only left him in that jail in Pickett."
-   After the Nürburgring accident in _Rush_, James Hunt blames himself because he convinced the other drivers to go on with the race when Niki tried to get them to cancel due to the dangerous track conditions. Niki agrees with this assessment, but he also says that James was equally responsible for his recovery (because he hated seeing him win the intervening races on the hospital TV).
-   In _Independence Day_, President Whitmore blames himself for not preparing for the possibility that the aliens were hostile, leaving millions of people in Los Angeles, New York, and Washington as they were incinerated.
    
    "We could have evacuated the cities _hours ago_. That's the advantage of being a fighter pilot. In the Gulf War, we knew what we had to do. It's just... not simple anymore. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?"
    
-   In _The Martian_, when a storm at the beginning causes a heavy object to knock Mark Watney away, out of sight, Commander Lewis tries to find him but reluctantly decides he's dead and acts to save the rest of her crew. Later, when she hears Watney survived, she blames herself, even though the rest of the crew tries to talk her out of this (and Watney, as it turns out, doesn't blame her). After all, _they_ were following her orders; _she_ left Watney behind.
-   In _Son-Rise: A Miracle of Love_, Suzie blames herself for Raun's autism. When she was pregnant with her daughters she prayed for healthy children, but when she was pregnant with Raun she only prayed for a boy.
-   When Aslan asks how Edmund could have joined the White Witch, in _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_, Peter's reply is to say, "It was my fault. I was too hard on him." Surprisingly, Susan - who up to this point has been pretty much blaming Peter for _everything_ - puts her hand on his arm and says, "We all were."
-   Michael from _Cries from the Heart_ has spent years blaming himself for his parents' divorce, because he broke a car window the night Roger left. Later, Roger blames himself for Michael's molestation because he was so insistent on having him institutionalized.
-   It takes awhile, but William from _The VVitch_ does finally acknowledge what had been fairly obvious to Thomasin (and the audience) from the start: he caused this whole mess with his pride. It got him and his family kicked out of their commonwealth, and his refusal to put his ego aside and go back to ask for help made the situation _much_ worse. Now, they're all stranded in the middle of nowhere with no food, winter on its way, and a witch terrorizing them. He says this in a prayer briefly before he dies, begging God to spare his children (or at least not condemn them to Hell), but do what He wants with him.

-   In Dan Abnett's _Gaunt's Ghosts_ novel _Straight Silver_, Raglon tells Gaunt that the loss of half his troopers (on his first mission as a sergeant) was his fault. Gaunt tries to reassurance, recounting how his first mission had had seventy percent casualties, deduces that Raglon is hiding something, and warns him that his own problem will be if he omitted anything or lied.

-   _Murder for the Modern Girl_: Peter blames himself for his father's death as the latter pushed the former away to avoid getting hit by a train.

-   _X-Wing Series_:
    
    -   Over the three books, Kell, Face, Donos, Tyria, and Wedge (at least) get told that, in fact, is _isn't_ their fault, or that there were extenuating circumstances. Probably the most notable is Phanan's last message for Face, in which he posthumously tells Face it's all _his_ (that is, Phanan's) fault, though he knows Face'll blame himself.
    
    **Phanan**: There are exactly two people to blame for my death. One's me, for not being quite the superior flyer I needed to be. Some unnamed Zsinj pilot is the other, and you killed him. Which I also appreciate, in case I don't tell you. There's no room for a third party to blame, so butt out.

-   _The Dresden Files_
    -   Harry Dresden, the hero, has this in spades. In several instances, he will assume full blame for the choices of others, even through less than logical reasoning, such as failing to inform his girlfriend fully led to her breaking into a vampire party uninvited, becoming a half-vampire, and her eventual death, or failing his friend Michael because he couldn't save Michael from becoming crippled, or some person he didn't know but failed to save from an undeserved death. Michael outright calls him on this level of pride in his belief in his own high standards and failing to meet them.

-   _The Stormlight Archive_:
    -   Kaladin blames himself entirely for his brother Tien's death, since he had promised his parents he would protect them. This is especially notable because it's one of the few things he doesn't blame Amaram for. Amaram promised to keep Tien in a non-combat role for a few years, but tossed him into a spearsquad after just a few months. But Kaladin ignores that, even after he realizes how corrupt Amaram really is, because he's too busy blaming himself.
    -   A very dark version with Odium. He often influences people, inspiring bloodlust across entire continents and causing horrible crimes. When he appears to people personally, he does so as a kindly old grandfather, always willing to forgive people for everything, reminding them that nothing is their fault, it's all _his_ fault. This means that they don't have to feel guilt for their crimes, and—most importantly—they don't have to _stop committing those crimes_.
-   _Mickey Haller_ goes through this in a couple of his books, playing into his self-hate.
    -   _The Lincoln Lawyer_: Mickey blames himself for the murder of Raul Levin, especially since he missed a call from him right before he died.

    -   _The Gods of Guilt_: Mickey finds out he has a tracker on his car, likely planted by the real murderer. Mickey decides to keep it on as a way to show off his confidence... which leads to the killer (or an associate) intentionally crashing into the Lincoln, killing his dear driver Earl Briggs.
-   Wentworth blames himself for Louisa Musgrove's near-fatal fall in _Persuasion_, believing that he overindulged her impetuous nature by his attentions—which were mainly a way to amuse himself while ashore and have a go at Anne by constantly praising Louisa's firmness of decision. (He's mortified equally when he realizes everyone is expecting him to marry Louisa, meaning he's been flippant with her heart as well.) Later, he takes a share of the blame in his own heartbreak by admitting that he could have renewed his addresses to Anne after he struck his fortune, but he chose to be bitter and resentful instead.
-   _Minecraft: The Crash_ has Bianca blame herself for getting into a car crash, and her best friend Lonnie's condition, because she talked Lonnie into going with her.

-   _Asperger Adventures_: In _Lisa and the Lacemaker_, Hannah blames herself for causing the fatal heart attack of Gwyneth, the senior maid and the titular lacemaker. Gwyneth broke up Hannah's Forbidden Romance with the son of her employers, and Hannah was so angry that she stole a beautiful, intricate lace pattern that Gwyneth had worked incredibly hard on. Gwyneth died that night. Now most of the people involved have been dead for decades, so Hannah has no way of setting things right.

-   In _Almost Perfect_, Tammi blames herself for her sister Sage's Trans Tribulations, including being emotionally abused by their parents and beaten up by a transphobic boy, because she encouraged Sage to come out years ago, knowing their parents would blow up. She admits in hindsight that although she did care for Sage, she also wanted to look good to their parents by comparison. While Sage was having regular screaming fights with her parents, Tammi was given much more freedom than other girls her age because her desires were "normal." Logan tells Tammi not to blame herself for anything because even though she wasn't perfect, she supported Sage for years when no one else did, and because if Sage hadn't come out and started living as a girl she probably would have killed herself.

-   Catherine from _On the Spectrum_ is a ballerina who has been teaching her daughter Clara to obsess over her weight since early childhood.

-   In _The City Who Fought_, the tween girl Joat talks her grounded friend (who she'd talked into getting in trouble in the first place!) into leaving home anyway and hang out with her. He's caught and in even deeper trouble, and Joat declares offscreen that it's all her fault - not just her friend's difficulty, but the entire situation, including refugees accidentally leading Space Pirates to the station! A pair of older characters, despite themselves, laugh together. The situation is pretty dire but at least they aren't twelve anymore.
-   In _A Mango-Shaped Space_, the cat Mango was born with a rip in his lung lining and isn't supposed to be outside in cold weather, but he manages to escape one night and is stuck outside for several hours. He dies that night. Zack and Mia both blame themselves for his death, Zack because he thinks he's the one who let him out and Mia because she got so wrapped up in her own life that she didn't notice he was missing. Their parents tell them that Mango had stopped eating even before he was stuck outside, which means that he was probably already dying and it wasn't the kids' fault.

        Hey, it's all me, in my head  
        I'm the one who burned us down

-   Seere says this often in _Drakengard_. He and the Big Bad are twins, and the main reason the Big Bad is crazy is that their mother doted on him and ignored her completely. He keeps the party from killing the Big Bad and then tries to reason with her. Needless to say, this fails. Leonard from the same game probably qualifies as well since he blames himself for the death of his family, and this is the only possible reason he agreed to a pact with that damn fairy.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   _Final Fantasy IX_ has Princess Garnet / Dagger give herself a good chiding after a particularly long stretch of terrible events.

After all that, not only does Dagger blame herself for the things that have happened, she temporarily goes mute in grief. Dagger does snap out of it, but only after an Important Haircut and every other hero reassuring Dagger that she couldn't possibly be blamed for all the tragedy.
    -   _Final Fantasy XIII_ practically makes a _theme_ of this.

The things being blamed include Serrah and Dajh becoming l'Cie, Serrah being taken captive and turned to crystal, and Hope's mother _volunteering_ to join Snow's defensive force and getting herself killed.

    -   In _Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light_, Jusqua blames himself when Aire is cursed to be a cat right after he ditches her for being insufferably selfish.

Except the cat he brings with him is actually just a stray... Aire finds a cure through other means.

    -   Jane Kim blames herself for not being able to stop her son Wonsu from getting Fixed, so she forms a cult around Fixies being "reborn as Saeras" to cope with the loss.
    -   It's revealed that the protagonist, if he's Jisu Cha, blamed himself for not being able to save the people being experimented on by CARI sooner because he was trying to find the cure for Fixer.
    -   Towards the end of the game, Bokho blames himself for getting his friend Nari Fixed for getting revenge on Junghan for attacking and scamming him over a ticket to the Bunker of Freedom. He visits you one last time to tell you to tell Nari that he's "sorry", and if you agree to his request, you'll later run into him pushing Junghan into the sea before jumping in himself.
-   _Persona_:
    -   In _Persona 4_, Teddie blames himself so hard for Nanako's death that he nearly Heroic BSODed himself out of existence.
    -   In _Persona 5_, Futaba blames herself for her mother's death thanks to a fake suicide note written by an opposition conspiracy who killed her mother for sensitive research and blamed her for all of it; This results in her becoming into a Hikkikomori with near-suicidal depression and the depression and crippling self-hatred manifested itself as a Palace taking the form of an Egyptian tomb. The Phantom Thieves performed a heist on it in order to prevent themselves from being targeted by a "Menjed Hacking Attack" by enlisting her help, and the crippling hatred became into a resolve to find her mother's real killer as her shadow transforms into the persona Necronomicon.
    -   _Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth_'s main OC Hikari fits this to a T. When the party tries to talk to her she just blames herself for things that she shouldn't do so she wouldn't receive the pain she is suffering now...And it's revealed in the fourth labyrinth that she suffered from a series of emotional traumas since elementary school that convinced her that individual think is worthless and caused her to end up with catatonic depression and the delusion that everyone hated her, including her father whom she only believed he did because of a Trauma Button phrase he used to cheer her up.
-   In _Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team_, Whiscash blames himself for the player character and their partner getting temporarily kicked out of town, since all the drama around the situation happened as a result of him telling everyone about some old legends.
-   Fail a mission in _Katamari Damacy_? Don't worry, it is not your fault. It is our fault for believing in you. Like THAT'S going to make The Prince feel any better.
-   Oichi in _Sengoku Basara_. It's practically the only thing she ever says.
-   _Dragon Age_:
    -   In _Dragon Age: Origins_, Oghren himself will make this statement if he's brought to the Gauntlet, stating that he believes that if he had been a better husband, Branka might not have dragged their clan to their deaths in her mad search for the Anvil.
        -   Also in _Origins_, near the end of the Sacred Ashes quest, one of the "tests of faith" involves reflecting on the origin of the Player Character. The PC can answer that they feel guilt for not being fast enough, strong enough, smart enough, or whatever to make a difference. While it's a rather heartwrenching part of the game no matter which origin is present, it's especially poignant in the Human Noble and City Elf origins.
    -   Depending on dialogue, Hawke in _Dragon Age II_ will beat him/herself up after his/her mother's murder saying that s/he wasn't fast enough and didn't watch over his/her mother closely enough.
    -   Varric seems to take this attitude in _Dragon Age: Inquisition_, though not without reason. He and his brother were the ones who led the expedition down to the Ancient Dwarven Thaig, discovering the Red Lyrium Idol and more or less kicking off the events that led to Meredith going crazy and sparking the Mage Rebellion. Depending on player choices, this can also have been the quest which resulted in the death of Hawke's only surviving sibling, for which Varric outright tells Cassandra that he blames himself. Varric is also the one who took Hawke to the Warden Fortress where Corypheus was held, which resulted in the party accidentally unleashing him upon Thedas and causing the events of _Inquisition_. And then in the same game he gets Hawke involved _again_ and if you don't play your cards right, Hawke can end up being _trapped in the Fade, possibly for eternity._ The worst part is that for the most part, all these events start with Varric _just trying to help._
-   _SLAMMED!_: The PC never really talks about it, but it's clear they blame themselves heavily for the car accident that seriously wounded JJ.
-   In the _Sly Cooper_ series, Murray blames himself for Bentley being permanently crippled at the end of the second game, saying he "just wasn't strong enough" to save him. Bentley repeatedly makes it clear that he doesn't blame Murray in the slightest, but still takes a lot of Walking the Earth before Murray stops blaming himself.
-   In _Touch Detective 2_, Colleen blames herself for the accident that broke Silver's voice, as she accidentally caused it while listening to him sing.
-   Bain in _PAYDAY: The Heist_ will usually blame himself or says how he underestimated the cops whenever you fail a heist. He apologizes and even starts working on bailing you out of jail. While the player characters have no reaction to this (being in jail obviously), it makes many players see Bain as quite a nice guy despite the fact that he's the mastermind behind all the heists.
    -   This was temporarily reversed in the sequel, where prior to Spring 2016 Bain never took any blame.
-   In _Dead Rising 3_, Annie/Katey Greene blames herself for her father, Chuck, becoming a crime lord because she has to take Zombrex for every 24 hours, so she went off on her own.
-   In _Mass Effect 3_, Shepard takes this attitude after the Fall of Thessia. Shepard states that as the commanding officer, it was his/her responsibility to find every variable and know how to overcome each of them, which s/he failed to do. This sends him/her into a brief but noticeable Heroic BSoD and very nearly over the Despair Event Horizon.
-   In _Disgaea Dimension 2_, upon hearing that Sicily was born in Celestia as a Demon Angel because of their mother's sacrifice and that her status made her an outcast, Laharl recognized that it was his fault for everything Sicily went through and even tells Sicily that she should be angry at him. He does this to also deflect any resentment Sicily might have against their mother for her sacrifice. Luckily, Sicily doesn't resent her mother at all and is happy that her brother lives.
-   _Hometown Story_:
    -   There is a shared one between Carl and his old friend the village sentient scarecrow. While they were engaged, Carl's wife Aisha went on a walk when Carl took his time to show up for a date and got injured. Since then, Carl has become a Creature of Habit. The scarecrow blames himself because the couple's meeting spot was his location, but his conversation was not interesting enough to keep Aisha entertained.
    -   Anna gets a period of this after her younger brother Harvey's death, due to having encouraged him to take care of things himself and rely on others as little as possible.
-   Used as a very gut-wrenching plot twist in _Silent Hill: Shattered Memories_. The Harry Mason you been playing as this whole time? Dead All Along. He's just Cheryl's memories. Harry had gotten a divorce with Dahlia and Cheryl was disturbed enough to think that her parents didn't love her anymore. Right after the divorce, Harry dies in a car crash, which has Cheryl blaming herself for the divorce and her father's death. She spends the majority of her teenage years lashing out against her mother, causing trouble at school and shoplifting. All the therapy sessions done in the game are actually from Chery's perspective where Dr. Kauffman tries to convince her that she is not to blame for Harry's divorce and death. Whether or not Cheryl gets over her issues depends on the player's responses and choices in the therapy sessions.
-   _Tales Series_:
    -   In _Tales of the Abyss_, after a bought Never My Fault after the Wham Episode, this _defines_ Luke fon Fabre after he Took a Level in Kindness and did an Important Haircut to prove it. It's a terrible deconstruction, especially as there was no way Luke could have avoided destroying Akzeriuth due to the Big Bad having groomed and _raised_ him as an Unwitting Pawn, not to mention hypnotized him into doing the final deed and the fact Luke is _actually seven_. The result is not pretty and his friends spend the majority of the plot trying to convince Luke otherwise without much luck.
    -   In one of the campfire skits in _Tales of Arise_, Rinwell reveals that a part of her blames herself for the death of her parents because she cast magic when they had told her not to and this may have revealed them to Almeidrea. Alphen snaps her out of this by telling her that he thinks that her parents likely knew that something like this might happen, but chose to teach her anyway. They would have felt it was better to give her a fighting chance _because_ of the possibility that they might get discovered, rather than her be left defenseless and on her own if that did happen.
-   Tarnum of _Heroes of Might and Magic Chronicles_ was in his first life the Barbarian Tyrant who united the Barbarian tribes into one kingdom via brutal conquest. He is all too aware that this brutality tainted the spirit of his people. When the Ax-Crazy Kilgor becomes king, Tarnum blames himself for it.
    
    **Tarnum:** _The example I set for my people when I was the brutal Barbarian Tyrant has come to its final fruition today. A man named Kilgor now rules my people, and he's turned them into the blood thirstiest bunch of savages in all the land._
    
-   To show what significant changes Kratos in _God of War (PS4)_ goes through since his early days, he blames himself for all the havoc he caused back in Greece. Within the game itself, he takes full blame for Atreus becoming ill. Quite the change from the man who would never accept blame for his own actions.
-   _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_: One of Link's memories shows that after he and Zelda fled from Hyrule Castle in the wake of Calamity Ganon's return, she broke down sobbing in Link's arms because, despite all their preparations, everything had gone wrong, leading to the deaths of her father and the Champions, and the destruction of most of the kingdom. The kicker? She was supposed to be the one to seal Calamity Ganon away, but she utterly failed in unlocking her power to do so. As far as Zelda was aware, the destruction of her home and the death of nearly everyone she ever knew was due to her own incompetence.
    
    **Zelda**: It's all my fault! Our only hope for defeating Ganon is lost all because I couldn't harness this cursed power! Everything — Everything I've done up until now... It was all for nothing...! So I really _am_ just a failure! All my friends... the entire kingdom... my father most of all... I tried, and I failed them all... _I've left them... all to die_.
    
-   _Farnham Fables_: Winona Edison has a bad habit of blaming herself when things go wrong, which is due to her suffering from depression. In Episode 2, she somehow feels like the farm's gate breaking (which causes a cow to escape) is her fault, even though she really had nothing to do with it. Thankfully, her Cool Big Sis Wendy is able to cheer her up.
-   _Spirits of Anglerwood Forest_: When Daniel gets captured by the spirits, Cyrus blames himself because he dragged him to Hatchet's Point against his wishes. Happens again toward the end of the game when Daniel turns into a tree.
-   _Ratchet: Deadlocked_: Ratchet claims to be responsible for Big Al being shot after managing to hack the Dealock collars. Clank shots this down quickly, stating that Ace Hardlight did it, and Gleaman Vox gave the order.
-   _Saints Row (2022)_: After the events of "The Peter Principle", Kevin feels the Boss getting fired from Marshall Defense Industries and Neenah's standing in Los Panteros becoming shaky are both his fault, because both events happen due to the Idols stealing the Hummingbird Codex, something both Marshall and Los Panteros wanted for themselves. Kevin did not find out the Idols' plan until it was too late, and feels if he had warned the Boss and Neenah about it sooner, none of that would have happened.
-   _Undertale_: During some neutral endings, some characters will feel this way if you killed a good number of monsters.
    -   During the two leaderless endings, Sans is the only main character alive, as you killed all the others and Alphys is implied to have killed herself, as her crush Undyne and her creation and best friend Mettaton are both dead. As he is the most fatalist of the bunch, Sans accepted the idea that the Underground will collapse, but still feels a bit guilty about it.
        
        **Sans:** i bet you're wondering why i'm not the ruler. eh. i'm not cut out for something like that. i like to take it easy, you know? ... that's a joke. this is what happens when people like me take it easy.
        
    -   Another ending is the aborted Genocide, which happens if you made the No Mercy run at least until the fight against Undyne the Undying, but fail to kill all the monsters in the Hotland / CORE section before reaching Mettaton NEO. Even if you didn't cause the biggest catastrophe of the game, you still started a Genocide and put fear in every monster's mind. Alphys, who usually is the first to die in Neutral endings, becomes the _de facto_ leader of the surviving monsters, possibly because she hade to hide with them in the True Lab alongside the Amalgamates and needed the courage to explain everything to these monsters while protecting them from you you. Even with that, she still regrets having let others do the dirty work and getting killed.
        
        **Alphys:** God, I miss everyone. Now that they're gone, it feels so clear what I should have done. What I should have said. Undyne... Asgore... Mettaton... at least Sans is here. He's... he's a good guy. And with him around, I... (_sigh_) You know. Just daydreaming here, but... I really should have killed you when I had the chance.
        

    Visual Novels 

-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   In _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Justice For All_, Regina Berry says this when she realizes she was responsible for the accident that sent Bat into a coma, and thus partly responsible for Acro killing Regina's father in an attempt to get revenge on her.
    -   Quercus Alba from _Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth_ does this a lot. It's to prop up his facade of being a frail old man when in reality he's the Big Bad.
    -   Miles Edgeworth falls into this for about half a case during the finale of the first game (not counting the Bonus Case), until Phoenix manages to break him out of it. With Evidence.
-   In _Code:Realize_, Victor was the one to create Zicterium, essentially inventing chemical warfare, and by extension, made it possible for Isaac to create the Horologium and Cardia. Though Victor isn't personally responsible for the crimes that other people have used Zicterium for, he still considers it very much his fault.
-   _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_: When Taka asks to speak to Alter Ego in Chapter 3, it becomes very obvious that this trope is at least part of the reason behind his total breakdown following the deaths of Chihiro and Mondo. The trope is somewhat Averted in that he really _isn't_ to blame, since the only thing he can come up with to place the responsibility on himself is that he wasn't present to prevent what happened, even though logically there was no reason why he _should_ have been. (His questions for Alter Ego are "Do you hate Mondo?" and "Since I couldn't stop him, do you hate me?") Considering that he's meant to be the "Ultimate Moral Compass" and Mondo's closest friend, though, as well as being quite domineering with a tendency to try to take leadership over the whole group, it is very in-character for him to blame himself regardless.
-   The protagonist of _Double Homework_ blames himself for the incident that killed 12 people. The media all seem to agree, while his friends, who don’t have all the facts, tell him that it’s all fine, even when he confesses his role in it to one of them. Both Tamara and Dennis (when he finds out) attempt to manipulate his guilt for their own purposes.
-   _Galaxy Angel_: On the third chapter of _Eternal Lovers_, Tact is forced to shoot down his girlfriend when her Emblem Frame goes out of control, severely injuring her. It didn't help that right before this happened they had an argument which heavily strained their relationship, and he spends hours in the infirmary waiting for her to wake up as he blames himself for hurting her.
-   _Little Busters!_: Said word for word by Kyousuke early on in Refrain in reference to the way Rin's social anxiety had hit critical levels to the point where she can't function normally in society anymore. Though in this case, it's mixed with I Did What I Had to Do, and while the consequences are certainly regrettable the reason behind the actions in the first place are more real now than ever.
-   In _Magical Diary_, during Damien's path, the player character blames herself for the injuries Damien caused her. Virginia is quick to dismiss this, but it doesn't comfort the PC much.
    
    **Virginia:** Don't say that! It is _not_ your fault, it's his! _No one_ saw this coming! He's dated lots of girls and broken all their hearts, you're not the first!  
    **Mary Sue:** No, I'm just the only one stupid enough to agree to give him my soul.
    
-   _Minotaur Hotel_: Asterion feels this way about himself towards the supposed mistakes he made in his life, despite the fact that he was young when he made them. He also feels ashamed of himself for thinking that he could give the hotel a purpose after Clement sabotages it. Obviously, you tell him that it's not his fault.
-   In _Mystic Messenger_, we have V who has endured years of Domestic Abuse at the hands of his ex-fiance Rika to the point where he even blames himself for the eye injury that would eventually turn him blind and cause him to give up his career as a photographer. He blames himself completely for all of the bad things that've happened in his and Rika's life, including her deteriorating mental health even though it was Rika herself who decided to stop her own treatment and V was the one who tried (and failed) to persuade her to keep to it for her sake.
-   While he does recognize that, ultimately, Kakuya is to blame for everything, Akira from _Spirit Hunter: NG_ feels a tremendous amount of guilt for getting his companions involved with spirits after Maruhashi is killed by one. It takes a pep talk from one of said companions, where they insist that they hold responsibility for their own actions, for him to get over it.
-   _Super Robot Wars V_: Tetsuya Tsurugi briefly considers himself the primary reason ZERO awakens and almost dooms the world, knowing that him and Great Mazinger are one of the primary triggers for ZERO's arrival.
-   _Theresia: Dear Emile_ gives us two doctors, Maylee and an unnamed man, the protagonist of Dear Martel. He blames himself for creating Epicari. Maylee comments that she has no intention of blaming him, and would rather create a solution. By the end of the game, it's revealed Maylee actually did blame herself.

    Web Animation 

-   _Helluva Boss_: Though he tries to hide it, Blitzo suffers from a massive guilt complex due to accidentally starting a fire that burned the circus he used to work at, which left Fizzarolli with horrific scars and (it's implied) killed his own mother. This ruined his friendship with Fizz (who believed that Blitzo started the fire on purpose out of jealousy) and possibly sent his sister Barbie Wire into a drug addiction and eventually into rehab; once she checks herself out in the present, Barbie makes it abundantly clear to Blitzo that she _never_ wants to see him again. When Fizz confronts him about it in the present, Blitzo breaks down in tears and apologizes for the whole debacle.
-   _Red vs. Blue_: A running gag in Season 11 involves various members of the Blood Gulch Crew, when confronted with certain questions or statements about their crashed ship, blame themselves for the ship's crashing. Rather than saying aloud that it's their fault, each person has a flashback to something they did on the ship that appears to be the cause of flashing red warning lights, then cuts back to the present where they either cite a Suspiciously Specific Denial or just dodge the topic. As a result, none of them know about the mistakes the others made. Subverted when it's eventually revealed that the only reason their ship survived a lethal tractor beam trap that was desiged to crash ships and kill everyone on board is because all the individual mistakes the crew caused resulted in the ship fighting itself to the point where it was even trying to go in different directions and different speeds all at the same time; the ship's contradictory behaviour countered the trap just enough to save their lives. In other words, while each disaster individually could have crashed the ship in normal circumstances, the combination of disasters ended up saving their lives instead.
-   In _Sodor: Dark Times_, a Darker and Edgier fan video series of _Thomas & Friends_, Gordon and the Fat Controller blame themselves for Alfred (who had murdered Henry earlier) blowing up Knapford Station, resulting in the deaths of Thomas, Edward, James, and Percy, causing the latter to resign as controller.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Clarissa_, the titular protagonist addresses the audience directly on the subject of how best to avoid being sexually abused by daddy during bathtime. But in the end, we see she's actually been talking to herself in the mirror.
    
    **Clarissa, glaring at herself:** We all know whose fault this is ...
    
-   _Chadam_ says this word-for-word when he fails to save a young boy, named Palco, from the Pallids and must confront the boy's mother and brother. Simkin tries to convince everyone that it wasn't Chadam's fault, but they aren't having it.
-   _DICE: The Cube That Changes Everything_: Dongtae blames himself for Byungchul's death, who might not have died and kickstarted the story had Dongtae not ignored the quest X gave him that particular night.
-   _Dr. Frost_: It’s revealed that this is how Professor Song feels about her sister Seol's suicide, and that her blaming Frost is a defense mechanism.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, this is the last thing that goes through Grace's mind before she goes berserk and attacks Damien.
-   Karl of _Emergency Exit_ say this when he finds out about Eddie and Jason's plan to fix his face by trading an artifact, despite the fact he was unaware of the plan while it was in progress.
-   In a less serious example than most Itto of _Girl Genius_ tries to invoke this when he realizes the Baron isn't buying his story of sneaking into the labs alone though he still doesn't give up the names of any other students involved.
-   _Gunnerkrigg Court_:
    -   Probably owing to her (almost) complete self-reliance through most of her childhood, Antimony blames herself for her father's disappearance and for failing to help the Ghost with the Sword (even though their meeting lasted less than a minute, most of which the Ghost spent trying to cut Annie's face off). Both times, Kat tells Annie she's being ridiculous.
    -   Another example is Diego, who was in love with Jeanne (The Ghost with the Sword mentioned above) while she was alive. Any of the court robots (the originals were built by Diego) will respond to "Jeanne" with "She died and we did nothing." It was eventually revealed that Diego set Jeanne up to her fate because she didn't love him back, it really is his fault. Averted. Even on his _deathbed_ he pins all of the blame on the other members of the Court involved in Jeanne's death.
    -   Annie later blames herself for Coyote's death when Ysengrin turned on him after Coyote gave him his powers and the destruction Ysengrin inflicted on the Court. Probably because Coyote gave Ysengrin his power due to supposedly being impressed by Ysengrin's bonding with Annie. And because she helped free Jeanne from her curse, which while a good deed also removed the one power keeping Coyote (and by extension Ysengrin) from outright attacking the Court.
    -   And still later, Annie blames herself for Loup destroying Reynardine's real body, in retaliation for his part in a failed capture attempt. They had no way of knowing the attempt was doomed from the start because of Jerrick being a part of the plan. Jerrick is actually an aspect of Loup in disguise.
-   _Homestuck_:
    -   When a deceased doomed alternate timeline version of Dave finds out that his Bro died, his first question is "what did i do wrong". At the time the event occurred, Dave was psychically unconscious on a different planet, and could not have possibly done a thing to help (of course, he is a time traveller who revisited that point of the timeline several times, so he could theoretically have gone to help, but another alternate version of him was already helping and he still failed).
    -   Also, WV. When he led the black and white pawns to battle, Jack Noir went and killed every single one of them. He blames himself for all of their deaths, and leads to a Harsher in Hindsight moment during \[S\] WV: Lead your men to victory! He's commanding a chess army.
    -   And Karkat. While he may try to push the blame on his past selves for little things, like trolling Jade for most of her life, he always blames himself when things get really serious. Like failing to get Sollux into the Medium in time, not preventing Eridan from killing Kanaya and Feferi, not keeping an eye on Gamzee to prevent him from going Ax-Crazy, accidentally giving the kids' universe cancer... He's complex enough that this isn't exactly his defining trait, but it's damn close.
-   The "it's not your fault" variation is darkly twisted near the end of _It's Walky!_, when the Head Alien uses it to make Sal feel helpless.

-   In _Motherly Scootaloo_, this is one of Scootaloo's main flaws, blaming herself for things that couldn't possibly be her fault.
-   In _Oglaf_ the ghostly Lizard of Guilt pesters Ivan into lashing out and yelling insults... in the middle of his trial for treason against the Mistress. In the last panel, the guards are posting a new "Apprentice Wanted" sign, and the Lizard of Guilt has a screaming guilt trip.
-   _The Order of the Stick_:
    -   Vaarsuvius blames him/herself for not having enough magical power to change the outcome of the Azure City battle and, since then, for failing to locate a missing friend who got separated during the battle. V's self-blame is anything but objective, since his/her friend is blocked from scrying by an abjuration that can only be broken with Epic-level magic, and V's contributions during the battle far outweighed his eventual limitations, but intellectually acknowledging this does little to stop the anguish.
    -   And poor V plays this even straighter — and with more cause — upon realizing that it was V's own spell that wiped out the Draketooth family and _every other bloodline they'd ever reproduced with_.
        
        **Vaarsuvius:** My fault.  
        **Blackwing:** Vaarsuvius?  
        **Vaarsuvius:** I am the cause. It sprang from my brow.
        
    -   Trying to avert this trope is partially Redcloak's motivation for his deeds, as expanded on in Start Of Darkness. While he has other reasons, another part is avoiding the guilt he feels for every goblin that died under his command. As his brother Right-Eye put it best...
        
        **Right-Eye:** It's all about whose fault it is... If I kill Xykon now, then it was all a waste. You ordered goblins to their deaths believing in the Plan- so if we abandon it now, then you were wrong. You let them die for nothing. You're willing to throw good lives after bad so that you don't have to admit that we were wrong to work with Xykon in the first place, much less help him cheat death.
        
-   _Sleepless Domain:_
    -   Low self-esteem and Survivor Guilt combine to cause this in Undine. Her old team was wiped out after a monster attack, with Undine surviving only because Tessa sacrificed her power to save her. Between this and the possibility that the one behind the incident has a personal grudge against Undine, she fears it all happened because of her. An encounter with that person later leaves Undine unable to take pleasure from saving a civilian family from a monster because she fears it was her presence that brought about the attack in the first place. That Heartful Punch was very nearly killed as well only makes it worse.
    -   Tessa also feels responsible for the fate of Team Alchemical. It was an argument with them over who should be leader that caused Tessa to sit out the night of the attack and arrive too late to help anyone but Undine. The reason she was so quick to give up her power for Undine was because, at that moment, she felt that any one of them deserved to live more than she did.
-   _Sluggy Freelance_:
    -   Torg blames himself for failing to save Alt-Zoe. In fact, he blames himself more than he blames the guy who actually killed her.
    -   Riff blames himself for Zoe getting horribly burned, mistakenly believing it was one of his malfunctioning inventions that started the fire.
-   _Tapiseri Soujourn_: Soujourn blames herself for Caleb burning down the entire village in order to find her.
-   In _Undead Friend_ Mahalah feels guilty for accidentally trapping her and Orrick in the game.'
-   _unOrdinary_: Arlo refuses to retake the "king" position after his attack on John to force him to show his true power level and ranking caused John to retaliate by attacking just about anyone who ticks him off, wreaking the school's "royalty" and putting several people in the hospital. Even after this Arlo is still having a hard time breaking with his stringent belief in the hierarchy or admitting the full extent of what he did to John, making his apologies land flat, but he fully admits the ensuing chaos and damage is his fault for not leaving someone alone just for refusing to participate in society's tier system.
-   Something of a character flaw for Ben from _Weak Hero_; though he can handle it when he's the one taking a beating, he can't stand the people around him getting hurt, and feels responsible for it even when it isn't this fault. In middle school, Alex keeps silent about fighting for Ben's honour, knowing that Ben would blame himself for it if he found out.

-   The Nostalgia Critic tortures himself over Ma-Ti's death in _Suburban Knights_, realizing that even though he proved his friendship in the end, it was still partly his treatment of Ma-Ti that drove him to Heroic Suicide in the first place.

    -   Chanyeol blames himself for Suho getting hurt in the first place, but as he was the one who knocked over the water bottle Suho tripped on, he's not entirely blameless.
-   The Angry Video Game Nerd says this when he reviews a bunch of games based on himself, and realizes that many of these games deliberately include some of the bad/frustrating game elements that he commonly complains about in his videos, such as arcing projectiles that are difficult to hit enemies with and nonsensical enemy design. When he sees the hypothetical overkill death trap he described in his _Super Pitfall_ review made real, it's enough for him to subvert his catch phrase, "What were they thinking?!", into, "What was _I_ thinking?!"
-   _Critical Role_ has a multiple-person variant (a reversed Blame Game) when a quartet of dragons attack Emon and tell the inhabitants, "Your protectors brought this upon you." Keyleth is sure it's her fault, because her Aramente took them to the fire plane, where the dragon leader, Thordak, was trapped. Vax is certain it's his, because he was the one to finish Brimscythe, the last dragon to attack Emon. And Allura insists it's her doing, because she and her companions captured Thordak in the fire plan years before, back when _they_ were protectors of Emon.

    Western Animation 

-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_:
    -   Played with when Katara's theft of a Waterbending scroll has gotten them all captured by pirates _and_ Zuko:
        
        **Katara:** Aang, this is all my fault.  
        **Aang:** No, Katara, it isn't.  
        **Iroh:** Yeah, it kind of is...
        
    -   A more serious example is Sokka's attitude in the first half of "The Boiling Rock".
    -   Inverted in the episode "The Desert" when Sandbenders steal Appa. Aang blames Toph for saving him, Katara and Sokka instead of Appa.
    -   Zuko feels this way about being banished, that _he_ did something dishonorable by speaking out against the senseless sacrifice of novice troops and subsequently displaying filial piety in the Agni Kai arena. This is pretty common for child abuse survivors in real life. He finally realized he wasn't to blame, just that his father is "a monster, and the worst father in the history of fathers".
-   In _Batman: The Animated Series_ Batman blames himself for the death of his parents, despite having no logical reason to do so.
-   In the _Batman Beyond_ episode "Curse of the Kobra" after Zander kidnaps Max.
    
    **Terry:** I never should've introduced him to Max.  
    **Bruce:** Don't blame yourself.  
    **Terry:** Why not? It's my fault.  
    **Bruce:** I know, but blaming's not productive.
    
-   Used in _Ben 10_ when Ben thinks that Gwen has died.
    -   In _Ben 10: Omniverse_, Ben also felt this way about losing Feedback.

-   In _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers_ episode "Oneupsman Chip", Chip's joke on Dale backfires when it leads the latter out of safety and right into the hands of archenemy Fat Cat's men. A dejected Chip says "This is all my fault", and the other Rangers console him... until Gadget blurts out that "although basically, you _did_ trick him into going there." Great consolation, Gadget. Chip bonks himself on the head and resolves to rescue his friend.
-   Variation in _Danny Phantom_, after Valerie's been hurt during Pariah Dark's invasion:
    
    **Tucker:** You can't blame yourself for this. It's not your fault.  
    **Danny:** Maybe not. But it _is_ my responsibility.
    
-   _Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines_: In "Have Plane, Will Travel", Dastardly feels the pangs of guilt when he thinks Klunk has flipped his lid in trying to use clouds as a means of chasing Yankee Doodle Pigeon.

-   _Race to the Edge_: "Darkest Night" has an exchange:
    
    **Hiccup**: It doesn't matter if we stayed or left!  
    **Tuffnut**: I thought that was the game. You know, what would've happened if we never left?  
    **Hiccup**: It's not a game, Tuffnut! It's not a dream, it's not a way of life, it's reality. It actually happened— we trained the dragons, we left Berk, and now my father is on his deathbed because of it. Because of me. None of \[the events of the series, especially Stoick's injury\] would have happened, and I mean _none_ of it, if I had never shot down Toothless in the first place! You know it. I know it. Berk knows it. _Everyone_ knows it. \[...\] Even \[Toothless\] knows it. _(storms out)_
    
-   Said word for word by Eddy in _Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show_ after a particularly cruel quicksand prank pulled by him and Ed on Double-D enrages the latter to the point of preferring to be beaten within an inch of his life by the Cul-de-sac kids than hang around with Ed and Eddy any longer.
    
    **Eddy:** **FINE!** GO HOME! I don't blame ya!! Because everything **WAS** my fault! (_beat, then cue sobbing_) Yeah, you heard me! A foul-up wannabe loser! (_breaks down even more_)
    
-   In the _Family Guy_ episode _Mother Tucker_, Peter says this before running up the stairs sobbing when his mother leaves Tom Tucker and needs to be consoled.

-   In the _Futurama_ episode "The Sting", Leela blames herself for Fry's death by space bee sting. The professor tries to comfort her by telling her it isn't her fault - then ruins it by (loudly) telling Bender, "I'm lying to make her feel better!"
    -   Subverted in the first film. Bender believes he's killed Fry, and Amy tries to tell him not to blame himself. Bender says that he in fact blames all of them for what he did. He sees his ability to do so as proof of how great he is.
-   In _Garfield and Friends_ episode 16, "Scrambled Eggs", a turtle mama mistakes Sheldon for her baby, and the turtle baby (who, indeed, is still mostly inside his shell, except for his legs) is led back to the barn by Booker, because they both have vision problems, apparently. Roy, too, is afflicted, as he tries out his sneezing powder on "Sheldon", and hides. It's effective mainly because it wouldn't be funny if it just bounced off. The turtle sneezes, breaking him out. He leaves before Roy looks around the corner. When the dust clears... all that's left is a shell! Roy walks around dejected for a while, thinking he's sneezed himself into nothingness, until a couple of seconds after he realizes he's just said hello to him.
-   In the _Godzilla: The Series_ episode "S.C.A.L.E., while being held hostage by Alexandra Springer, Audrey saids this to Nick because she unwittingly lead S.C.A.L.E. to Monster Island.
-   The _Heckle and Jeckle_ cartoon "The Rainmakers" has the two having a picnic in the rain. Jeckle wishes on a wishbone that it would stop raining forever, and sure enough it does. But now there's the mother of all droughts and it's on the TV news.
    
    **Jeckle:** I say...do you think _I_ caused all this?  
    **TV Reporter:** (_coming out from the TV and in Jeckle's face_) Yes!! And what are _you_ going to do about it?!
    
-   In the _Hercules: The Animated Series_ episode "Hercules and the Big Lie", this is played straight when Herc realizes that said lie caused Icarus to put himself in danger. Subverted a minute later when he adds that it's also partly Cassandra's fault for urging him to do it.
-   Helga Pataki says it twice in the same scene of _Hey Arnold!_, "Phoebe Breaks A Leg".
    -   Arnold also says this after he somehow caused Helga to go blind, which turns out not to be the case, but he doesn't know that. Matters are not made better by Grandpa, who keeps prattling on how Helga will somehow get by, somehow, even after what Arnold did to her. Of course Helga plays this up enormously, as it keeps Arnold completely at her back and call.
-   In the _Jem_ episode "The Music Awards Part 1", Jerrica says this when Deidre, Ba Nee, and Krissie run away after she kept ignoring Deidre for her work for the music awards. Kimber, Aja, and Shana also blame themselves.
    
    **Jerrica:** Oh, it's all my fault, if I'd just stop to listen! (starts to cry quietly)  
    **Aja:** We're all to blame.  
    **Kimber:** We should have given them more attention too!  
    **Shana:** We were all too busy when they needed us!
    
-   _Kaeloo_: In Episode 214, Stumpy repeatedly complains to his sister Lavanade that her supernatural powers are weird and he wishes she could be normal. This sparks an argument between Stumpy and Quack-Quack, because not only is Quack-Quack appalled by Stumpy's treatment of Lavanade, but Quack-Quack has superpowers too and every insult Stumpy says to Lavanade hurts him too. Lavanade being the subject of the argument, she blames herself for upsetting the two of them and starts crying about how it was all her fault.

    (_Shifu pats Po reassuringly on the back, then glares at him_)  
    **Shifu:** Yes, it is.

-   _The Owl House_: Luz is horrified upon realizing her meddling in the past helped Belos came into power.
-   Skipper in _The Penguins of Madagascar_ does this twice in a matter of about 12 episodes. The first time he poked a hole in Julien's bouncy house causing him to lose his crown and that was his fault in fairness, but the second, when one of the chimps causes him and the penguins to spin out and lose a race to the lemurs and by default their car also he accepts full responsibility despite the fact he did nothing that caused it. He even said they would have resignation in the morning because of his shame and guilt.
-   The Brain, of _Pinky and the Brain_, after he accidentally pushes Pinky off the countertop they are standing on: "It's all my fault! This obsession with taking over the world is causing me to hurt the ones I... tolerate."
-   _Punky Brewster_: Punky goes through this in the debut episode when she talks Henry into taking a skydiving photography assignment in Florida where he gets lost in a swamp and she (and the others) think a swamp monster has him. As she sits on a log, head cradled in her hands and arms propped on knees:
    
    **Punky:** We'll never find Henry, and it's all my fault. (_sniffling, tears streaming down her cheeks_) I guess I just wasn't meant to have a family.
    
-   In the _Recess_ episode 'The Lost Leader' TJ blames himself when Gus gets injured during a Zany Scheme...because TJ _forgot a teacher had fishstick stuck in their teeth_. (Complicated plan.) Plus it was mostly Gus's fault for panicking. But TJ goes into Heroic BSoD for the rest of the episode and even resigns as leader until the other five pull him out of it.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   "Dog of Death": Bart, on his dog running away, says this phrase, following it with "I called him a dumb dog". The rest of the family blame themselves as well.
    -   Also, Marge says that Homer getting thrown into a U.K. jail is "partially my fault" in "The Regina Monologues".
    -   This was also done in "Bart the Lover", where Bart said "I can't help but feel partly responsible." when he was entirely responsible for Mrs Krabapple's hurt feelings.
    -   Another one: When Maude Flanders gets Killed Off for Real after being hit by cannon-launched T-shirts while getting hot dogs, Ned worries it's all his fault, for not getting them himself.
        
        **Homer:** Don't blame yourself, Ned. After all, it was me who insisted we go to the game. It was me who provoked the lethal barrage of T-shirts. It was me who parked in the ambulance zone, negating any possibility of resuscitation... But let's not play the _blame game_!
        
    -   Furthermore, when Homer drove Ned into moving away, he lamented "It's all somebody's fault!"

    -   In "Bart vs. Thanksgiving", Bart hears Lisa blaming herself for Bart running away on Thanksgiving. Homer and Marge also feel bad for being too harsh on Bart during dinner.
        
        **Marge:** Homer, this is a terrible thing that's happened, but we can't blame ourselves.  
        **Homer:** We can, and we will!
        
    -   Another Marge example come from "Lemon of Troy" when she finds out that her lesson to Bart on pride for his town worked too well and turned him into an outright xenophobe.
-   _South Park_:
    -   Parodied after Stan's parents split up:
        
        **Stan:** Oh no! This is all my fault, isn't it?  
        **Sharon:** ...yeah, kinda.  
        **Stan:** Dude, you're not supposed to say that!
        
    -   Also when Terrance and Philip reconcile:
        
        **Philip:** Terrance, I—  
        **Terrance:** No. No, Phillip, don't say it. I'm an asshole, and this is mostly my fault.  
        **Philip:** That's what I was gonna say: You're an asshole, and this is mostly your fault.
        
-   _Star Trek: Lower Decks_: In "We'll Always Have Tom Paris", Rutherford's memories might be spotty, but he does remember how Shaxs died in a Heroic Sacrifice to save him and blames himself for it. Shaxs assures him that it is not his fault, and that it was his duty to do as he did.
-   _Star Wars Rebels_: In "Zero Hour", although he doesn't say anything, the look on Kallus' face when he realizes Thrawn played him into giving away the location of Chopper Base, and later when Commander Sato dies in a Heroic Sacrifice to destroy Admiral Konstantine's Interdictor, says everything.
-   _Steven Universe: Future_: In "I Am My Monster" features a deconstruction of this trope. Steven has a complete mental breakdown, which causes his powers to go absolutely ballistic, turning him into a massive, pink Kaiju, lashing out in fear and rage. His father, the Crystal Gems, the Diamonds and Spinel all start proclaiming how it was their fault that Steven is like this, because they didn't support him enough (Greg), never asked if he was okay when it looked like there was something wrong, (Amethyst) or actively tried to kill him (the Diamonds and Spinel). Enter Connie.
-   In the _Super Mario World_ cartoon, Luigi blames himself for the cave people's crops being stolen.
    
    **Mario:** Now wait, Luigi! The cave people can go back to picking berries.  
    **Luigi:** Aw, no they can't! Oh, Mario, I was so sure that we'd have a great crop, that I told the cave people they didn't have to save berries anymore, and they didn't. They don't have any food stored for the winter! _(sob)_ AND IT'S ALL MY FAAAULT!
    
-   This happens to Robin in the _Teen Titans (2003)_ episode "X". After the Red-X costume and equipment is stolen, he blames himself for creating the thing in the first place. (And no-one really argues with him about it, _especially_ when he tells them that he used xenothium to power the suit, an unstable element that is so dangerous, even superheroes aren't legally allowed to buy it.)
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)_ sure have these moments:
    -   The episode "The Way of Invisibility" has Casey blaming himself for getting Raphael captured by the Foot for experimentation.
    -   "Fallen Angel" has the eponymous character of the episode blaming herself for getting Casey captured by Hun and his gang, the Purple Dragons.
-   Quoted on multiple occasions in later episodes of _Thomas & Friends_ when an engine causes some dilemma or can't complete a task.
-   Inversion: In the Woody Woodpecker cartoon "Shanghai Woody", Woody is shanghaied by a ship's captain who immediately blames his first mate (who was told to do so in the first place) after Woody pecks the ship full of holes.
-   Inversion: Whenever Dick Dastardly's plans on _Yogi's Treasure Hunt_ backfired, he'd shout "This is all your fault, Muttley!"

    Real Life 

-   By giving and insisting on a crazy order, Vice Admiral Tryon caused the Victoria-Camperdown collision in 1893 and ultimately the loss of more than 300 lives. He chose to stay on the sinking ship Victoria. His last recorded words were exactly this: "It was all my fault".<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Czarina Alexandra of Russia blamed herself for her son Alexis being born a hemophiliac in 1904. It ran in her family and had killed her brother and uncle. Medical science at the time had no real way of helping him<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and to assuage her guilt, she turned to mysticism to help him to disastrous results.
-   As the troops were planning to disembark for the Normandy landings in World War II, General Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote two letters, the first one commending the troops for their efforts in securing the beaches and the liberation of France. He also wrote a second one in case the beach landings failed (which was a real possibility due to the bad weather, massively complex scheme, and stout German defenses), in which he diverted blame upon himself and not the troops ("It is mine alone"). When the invasion proved successful, Eisenhower was going to toss the second letter away, but a junior officer read it and insisted it be preserved for historical value.
-   An absolutely epic example by Flight Director Gene Kranz after the Apollo 1 fire:
    
    "Spaceflight will never tolerate carelessness, incapacity, and neglect. Somewhere, somehow, we screwed up. It could have been in design, build, or test. Whatever it was, we should have caught it. We were too gung ho about the schedule and we locked out all of the problems we saw each day in our work. Every element of the program was in trouble and so were we. The simulators were not working, Mission Control was behind in virtually every area, and the flight and test procedures changed daily. Nothing we did had any shelf life. Not one of us stood up and said, 'Dammit, stop!' I don't know what Thompson's committee will find as the cause, but I know what I find. We are the cause! We were not ready! We did not do our job. We were rolling the dice, hoping that things would come together by launch day, when in our hearts we knew it would take a miracle. We were pushing the schedule and betting that the Cape would slip before we did. From this day forward, Flight Control will be known by two words: 'Tough and Competent'. Tough means we are forever accountable for what we do or what we fail to do. We will never again compromise our responsibilities. Every time we walk into Mission Control we will know what we stand for. Competent means we will never take anything for granted. We will never be found short in our knowledge and in our skills. Mission Control will be perfect. When you leave this meeting today you will go to your office and the first thing you will do there is to write 'Tough and Competent' on your blackboards. It will never be erased. Each day when you enter the room these words will remind you of the price paid by Grissom, White, and Chaffee. These words are the price of admission to the ranks of Mission Control".
    
-   In the American Civil War, Robert E. Lee felt this and said as much after he lost the Battle of Gettysburg after his ill-conceived Pickett's Charge was repulsed. No doubt, part of that is that he was kicking himself for ignoring General Longstreet's advice to first manoeuvre around the Union Army to get between it and Washington DC, and then disregarding his warning that Pickett's Charge would be a costly debacle.
