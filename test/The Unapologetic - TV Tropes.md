_"If I had any single regret for the countless horrific events that have transpired in my wake... it's that I'm dying."_

This is the opposite of Apologises a Lot, where a character apologizes for things he didn't do or aren't worth apologizing for. This type of character has done something (or a lifetime of somethings) that has upset others, but they refuse to apologize. They are the kind of person who, if asked "Are you proud of yourself for making Alice cry at her birthday party?", will simply reply "Yes" with a straight face. Unlike Never My Fault (though the two can overlap), they're not passing the blame, they simply _aren't sorry_. Or at least, they claim not to be.

This can be because they feel they did what they had to do, and had no choice in the matter, or that the end result was worth it since Utopia Justifies the Means. Alternately, they may be too prideful to admit that they didn't have to go _that_ far. A simple "sorry" can patch things up with everyone they wronged, but their ego is making it hard for them to do so. They could just be a Jerkass who responds by telling the victim to quit whining already, or a Jerkass of the self-aware kind who openly brags about being a horrible person. They might well go into a full-on Redemption Rejection, or at least being Defiant to the End. Or they could flat-out be The Sociopath, knowing on an intellectual level that they've done something wrong but just _not giving a single damn_.

There are some cases that the unapologetic character is in fact in the right, and the person demanding an apology is actually the bad guy from an objective viewpoint. Tyrants often try to make a heroic freedom fighter admit that he loves big brother and was very wrong to try to put a stop to the Government Drug Enforcement.

This is usually, but not always, a Character Flaw, and may transition into An Aesop about showing consideration for others. Naive characters will easily forgive this character despite not apologizing. A common trait of The Sociopath, the Narcissist, and a character who does things For the Evulz, and a key component of the Complete Monster by definition. Related to Lack of Empathy, if they don't feel empathetic enough to apologize. Also related to I Regret Nothing. Also see Virtue Is Weakness as the person may believe that apologizing is a sign of weakness.

Ordered Apologies won't work for this character, but if it does, expect him to give a Backhanded Apology or at least an apology that is half-hearted. If he _is_ genuinely apologetic, but has trouble actually making the apology due to pride, embarrassment, or guilt, he Cannot Spit It Out, or is Gagging On Their Words. Contrast Rejected Apology where a character refuses to accept an apology. Contrast Heel Realization, My God, What Have I Done?, and The Atoner.

    Anime and Manga 

-   Guts from _Berserk_ usually doesn't try to pass blame when he acts mean to someone or takes it on himself to Shoot the Dog, but his attitude is I Did What I Had to Do and he refuses to apologize no matter how much Puck bugs him about it. On the other hand, this is partly an aspect of his facade, especially toward Jill and toward Puck himself. On the occasions when he does apologize to someone, such as to Rita for killing her possessed partner John in _Sword of the Berserk: Guts' Rage_, it's serious business for him and therefore unusually sincere.
-   While Vincent Leung of _The Case Files of Jeweler Richard_ does regret some of the actions he's taken, he never apologies onscreen for any of it, and says he'd do it all over again.
-   _Dragon Ball_: Goku wanders the woods and comes across a campsite and a fish being cooked over a fire. Goku tries to grab the fish, burns himself, then puts out the fire and eats the fish. Then Yajirobe returns to his campsite and angrily attacks Goku for stealing his fish. Goku says he didn't steal it because it was all by itself, but Yajirobe angrily points out the fact that it was cooking on a fire means it belonged to someone, which never occurred to Goku. Nonetheless, Goku refuses to apologize, saying Yajirobe was stupid to leave the fish unattended.
-   _Great Teacher Onizuka_: Miyabi Aizawa is famously this. She never had second thoughts about harming others' life. Only in the end, after seeing Onizuka's "selfless act" (taking the blame for all her crimes) can she finally apologize to him.
-   _Kill la Kill_: Nui Harime finds the mere idea of an apology ridiculous. Even if she comes within inches of crippling her boss's Evil Plan.
-   In _Sonic X_, Amy asks if Knuckles was going to apologize to Sonic for fighting against him because Dr. Eggman had him tricked, only for Knuckles to tell her to zip it just before smiling at Sonic and the gang, tells them "later", and walks away. In season 3, however, he did apologize to the gang for falling for Eggman's tricks.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_: Damian starts out wholly unapologetic for his attempted murder of Tim Drake, endangering innocents with his actions, and general cruel entitled behavior. He remains this way for quite some time before Dick starts rubbing off on him and his shift from this mindset is a clear sign of his character growth.
-   _Green Lantern_: This has become part of John Stewart's character, almost to the point of repetitiveness. John Stewart killed a planet... _and he would do it again!_ John Stewart killed a Green Lantern... _and he would do it again!_ John Stewart killed a Green Lantern planet... _and he would do it again!_ Note that these decisions _are_ usually the last available option.
-   _Joker_: The Joker _hates_ apologies. He hates the very idea that something should ever be apologized for.
    
    **Joker:** My friend... Jonny Jonny... what I hate more than everything... is apologies.
    
-   Black Swan, the enigmatic voice of knowledge in _The Avengers (Jonathan Hickman)_, is first seen triggering a bomb to blow up an alternate Earth. She never apologizes for this or anything else she says she has done, saying she did what was necessary. But she isn't heartless; the emotional toll her career has taken on her manifests in Past Experience Nightmares.
-   _Judge Dredd_: War Marshal Kazan, having launched a synthetic Hate Plague against Mega-City One to weaken it for an invasion, has this to say as he's dying of gunshot wounds:
    
    I regret... nothing! I apologize for... nothing!
    
-   In _The Sandman (1989)_, Morpheus is the immortal ruler of dreams and tends to be very inflexible, refusing to apologize or admit error. In his backstory, he sentenced a woman to hell for eternity simply for refusing his advances (when she had very good, selfless reasons for doing so.) After several thousand years, he is _finally_ goaded into freeing her by his sister Death, which sets in motion the events leading to his own demise.
-   _Superman_:
    -   In _Supergirl (1972)_ #9, Supergirl catches her then-boyfriend cheating on her. When she confronts him, he isn't even slightly sorry.
    -   _Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl_: When Supergirl and Batgirl accuse Lex Luthor of murdering Supergirl's baby cousin, he doesn't feel guilty about it at all. He even claims that it wasn't murder because he merely killed an alien.
    -   _Supergirl (2005)_: Throughout the entirety of Gates/Igle's run, Catherine Grant wages a smear campaign aimed at Supergirl, driven for petty reasons: Kara bruised her accidentally as she was saving her life, and Cat thought that she could gain notoriety by libeling the young hero. And she doesn't feel guilty at all, not even after Supergirl saves her life in _Day of the Dollmaker_. The only thing resembling an apology that Supergirl got was a "I was not wrong, but maybe Supergirl might deserve another chance after all" recantation.
    -   _The Phantom Zone_: Jax-Ur did not intend to blow up one moon and kill hundreds of persons, but he was utterly unrepentant about his tragic mistake when he was taken into custody.
-   _Ultimate Marvel:_ Loki, when he's sealed away inside Yggdrasil by Odin for causing the start of Ragnarok.
    
    _"I apologise for_ nothing. _Nothing..."_
    
-   _Wonder Woman_ Vol 1: Queen Atomia is self-centered, murderous, experiments on people, and forcibly transforms people into her mindless slaves while also rearranging their bodies to her liking. She only shows remorse for her horrific actions when welded into a mind-altering device which forces her to and when she escapes from it she is furious. This does not apply to the reimagined Atomia seen in _Wonder Woman (Rebirth)_ as she is much more heroic.

    Fan Works 

-   _Advice and Trust_: Gendo does not make a habit of apologizing... ever. He fired his two best pilots for "insubordination" (i.e. not following orders would have got them hurt or killed during a battle), stating that he would replace them with the more reliable and more efficient dummy plug system. In the next battle Zeruel easily destroyed the dummy plugs and it would have killed everyone if Shinji and Asuka had not returned of their own volition. Did Gendo rue his words, think he was wrong, and apologize? Not at all. He commended them - giving them the world's most token commendation - and rehired them because he had been _ordered_ to, and he never ever suggested he was sorry at all.
-   _All For Luz_: When Luz asks Shigaraki if he ever regrets becoming a Card-Carrying Villain, he replies that the only thing he'd change if given the chance is his approach, tweaking things here and there to make his plans more effective.
-   _Cain_: The only thing Katsuki regrets is that he didn't attempt to outright _murder_ Izuku sooner, and that said attempt failed.
-   _A Clear Pattern of Behavior_ makes clear that Katsuki is _fully aware_ that his Barbaric Bullying of Izuku is both wrong and a _privilege_ he's enjoyed due to teachers turning a blind eye. He fully expects this to continue at U.A., misinterpreting the warning he gets for attacking Izuku during their Quirk Assessment test as a tacit nudge towards giving them all plausible deniability by _only_ beating the shit out of him during combat training.
    -   Tellingly, when Aizawa asks him if he _knew_ how much force he was attempting to use on Izuku during their Heroes vs. Villains exercise, Katsuki proudly points towards the half-destroyed building they were in and proclaims "Yeah, about that \[much\]," making clear that he _deliberately_ aimed for lethal damage.
-   _CONSEQUENCES_: The only time Lila ever apologizes for any of her behavior is when she's forced to via Ordered Apology. In _EYES OF THE OWL_, when her mother and Principal Damocles attempt to make her apologize in front of the whole school, she tells Marinette that she's sorry that she didn't _successfully_ destroy her life and reputation, and that she's _especially_ sorry Marinette isn't dead, before spitting in her face.
-   Zigzagged in _Craving the Sky_. Weiss absolutely hates giving apologies because she was forced to apologize so often growing up that she believes the entire point of an apology is to be humiliating. When under stress however she'll revert to apologizing for anything and everything she thinks she might be blamed for. Interestingly, this means she also dislikes receiving apologies from those she cares about.
-   _Dandelions in the Wind_: After getting expelled from Yuuei, Katsuki reflects that his prideful, antagonistic, and unapologetic attitude is part of what landed him in such a bad position in the first place.
-   _Dominoes_: Whenever anyone attempts to call out Yuusaku for being an abusive, Manipulative Bastard, he offers up some pithy, self-flattering excuses and self-rationalizations before _doubling down_ and proving himself to be utterly unremorseful.
-   _A Dream_: The entire Valiant family acts this way. Not only is not a single member ever the least bit apologetic about any of their actions, most are openly _proud_ of what they've done.
-   Trixie from _An Extended Performance_ rarely apologizes for her mistakes, due to her Inferiority Superiority Complex. This predictably gets her in a lot of trouble.
-   _For His Own Sake_:
    -   Initially, Shinobu is the only resident of the Hinata Inn who recognizes how much she unintentionally hurt Keitaro by not trying to reign the others in. The rest believe that their various bad behavior is completely and totally justified.
    -   Over time, Kitsune and Motoko get Heel Realizations and grow out of this. Granny Hina has an Ignored Epiphany, briefly realizing how much she's hurt her grandson before rationalizing it away.
-   _I See What You Do Behind Closed Doors Miraculous Ladybug_: Not only does Lila refuse to apologize to her classmates once they learn how she deceived them, she brags about how much fun she had along the way, gloating that "The stuff I made you guys do was too good to be true!" She also casually outs Adrien as her Accomplice by Inaction.
-   In _Infinity Train: Blossoming Trail_, it's a known fact that Paul does not apologize for the horrible, horrible things he did in the anime and has a severe Lack of Empathy. This ends up ruining him since he didn't apologize for how he essentially let an Apex child _drown in Silent Hill_ with Walter, his warden, showing absolute disgust that Paul didn't even try to save him.
-   _Jimmy's Visit With Dr. Franklin_: Ebon, he didn't feel any remorse for what he found out he had done, instead he was proud of what he did, to the disgust of the rest of The Meta-Breed.
-   _Long Con_: Lila makes clear that she's not particularly worried about her classmates figuring out how she lied to and manipulated them, pointing out that Ms. Bustier never punishes her "problem students" like Chloe, instead passive-aggressively pressuring their victims to Turn the Other Cheek and "lead by example".
-   _A Marriage Of Convenience_: Hans starts out this way. However, after realizing that he's starting to fall for Elsa, Anna convinces him to drop this attitude, pointing out that he's not doing himself any favors by refusing to acknowledge or make any effort to make amends for his past behavior.
-   _Mean Rabbit_ has Aizawa, who refuses to apologize for his sadistic teaching methods. Such as singling out Izuku for being Quirkless, turning most of Class 1-A against him through his 'logical ruses' and manipulations. Even after Izuku saves his life at the USJ, he makes clear that he has no intention to recant or treat him any better, insisting that Izuku will _always_ be mistreated for his Quirklessness and "had better get used to it".
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion: Genocide_: When Asuka beat Keiko during a combat simulation, Misato ordered her to apologize. Asuka didn't want to say sorry, though, because she didn't think that she did anything wrong, and the other girl shouldn't be a pilot anyways.
-   _Olivine Romance_: Jasmine _never_ apologizes to anyone, freely acknowledging that she is incredibly prideful and stubborn, much like her mother.
-   _The One to Make It Stay_:
    -   Adrien/Chat Noir is like this whenever he's not dealing with somebody who has power over him, like his father. Whenever anyone calls him out on his selfish behavior, such as his entitled attitude towards Ladybug, he refuses to acknowledge what they're saying. Instead, he tosses out some other accusation towards _them_. Such as complaining that Plagg "used to be fun", or accusing Ladybug of "airing out their dirty laundry in front of others" in an argument HE started.
    -   Chloe is naturally horrid about this as well. She knows full well that her Alpha Bitchery is wrong; she just doesn't want to admit it, or put in the effort to change her ways. It takes a _severe_ screw-up for her to express remorse, and at that point, nobody wants to hear it.
-   Paul in _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_ apparently had not apologized to anyone in years. Much to his chagrin, he's forced to do it when Gym Leader Janine refuses to otherwise give him info about an upcoming tournament to enter the Safari Zone.
-   _Scarlet Lady_: Chloé, being incredibly self-absorbed, never acknowledges that she's done anything wrong, no matter how blatantly she's at fault. Adrien has repeatedly questioned whether she has _any_ sense of shame, which typically draws a blank stare from her as though she doesn't understand the concept.
    -   This is so severe that she was shocked beyond belief when her father actually _ordered her_ to apologize for falsely accusing Marinette of theft during the Rogercop incident. Note that he likely only did so because he was heavily shaken by how Chloé seemingly fell to her death during said incident, only for his daughter to completely ignore his attempt at a tearful reunion.
    -   Her status as such fuels Marinette's Rage Breaking Point in "Zombizou", when she calls out Mme. Bustier on expecting Marinette to forgive her latest transgression when Chloé not only refuses to apologize but is clearly _smug_ about it — and fully aware that their teacher won't do anything to punish her.
-   _Type-2 Hero_:
    -   When Nedzu confronted Katsuki with the fact that he _knew_ he had blown off one of Izuku's arms, Katsuki casually dismisses it, showing absolutely no remorse for his actions. Even after being informed that he's not permitted to enter U.A.'s entrance exam, he blames Izuku, infuriating Nedzu enough that he hits him with a "The Reason You Suck" Speech:
        
        **Nedzu:** Why should I let a bully and a thug like you enter U.A.'s halls?  
        **Katsuki:** _(shrugs idly)_ Like you said, I got a strong quirk and good control over it. What does it matter what I did to a useless deku like him?  
        **Nedzu:** _(in a Tranquil Fury)_ It matters because U.A. is a _hero_ school, where we train _heroes_. Being strong isn't the only thing that makes a hero, and you are greatly lacking in those categories. As such, Bakugou Katsuki, despite your school's best efforts, you are hereby barred from taking the U.A. entrance exam. You are not permitted to attend.  
        **Katsuki:** _(head lowered, muttering)_ Damn deku...  
        **Nedzu:** What was that?  
        **Katsuki:** This is all that deku's fault! He's always getting in my way and ruining things! Why can't he just stay down like the Quirkless _freak_ he—  
        _(Nedzu tosses a throwing knife past his cheek, drawing blood)_  
        **Nedzu:** Make no mistake, Bakugou, everything that has happened today is your own fault. I had hoped you'd display some regret for what you'd done, but it's clear you care only for yourself, and we don't need a second Endeavor. You've earned yourself a Red Mark. You are barred from applying to other Hero programs for the remainder of your life. If any program extends an invitation is their own prerogative, but any application you submit will be rejected. _(to Vlad and Eraserhead)_ Take him away, dump him at the gates. He is no longer welcome on U.A. property.  
        **Katsuki:** _(flailing and screeching)_ You can't do this to me! I'm stronger than anyone! I'm supposed to be the hero!  
        **Nedzu:** Then you shouldn't have acted the part of the villain.
        
    -   As Nedzu alludes to, Endeavour is completely unrepentant about everything he did in his efforts to become the Number One Hero or the way he abused his family in order to live vicariously through his 'successor'.
-   _Whispered Tribulation_:
    -   Aizawa refuses to acknowledge that he might have jumped to conclusions about Izuku, insisting that he was right to kidnap him and that he should have been _permitted_ to torture a False Confession out of him... though naturally, he believes said confession would have been legitimate. It takes extensive therapy for him to recognize his mistakes and start expressing remorse.
    -   His co-conspirators Vlad King and Sniper are just as bad about this, which leads to several Broken Pedestals. Especially amongst Vlad's students, like Pony, whom he knew was _dating_ Izuku and still refused to apologize to her. Once Izuku is officially cleared, they regret what they did, in no small part because their careers are completely destroyed.
    -   Katsuki naturally refuses to show any remorse over how he treated Izuku, even when confronted by an utterly _furious_ Principal Nedzu.
-   _Words May Hurt_: Despite seriously injuring Tenya during their first exercise together, Katsuki shows absolutely no remorse for his actions. In fact, he treats U.A.'s response as a Bewildering Punishment, protesting that the only reason he ignored All Might's orders to stand down is because Deku was there.
-   _The Young Six_: Sandbar's old friend, Comet Trail insults Ocellus due to him being in Canterlot during Queen Chrysalis' invasion. When Sandbar asks him to apologize, Comet refuses, causing Sandbar to end his friendship with him.
    -   In a later chapter, Comet _does_ apologize to Ocellus for insulting her.

    Films - Live-Action 

-   In _In This Our Life_, Stanley doesn’t care that she stole Peter from her sister (her husband!), that he killed himself after she basically drove him crazy, or that she’s trying to seduce her former fiancé, who’s now Roy’s fiancé.
-   From _John Wick_, when John confronts Iosef for killing his dog, instead of apologizing, the bastard just coldly tells him that it was no big deal... before John casually gives him a Boom, Headshot!.
-   In _She Wore a Yellow Ribbon_, John Wayne's Catchphrase is "Don't apologize, it's a sign of weakness."
-   Barry Champlain from _Talk Radio_ is a Shock Jock who specializes in being as big of a Jerkass as possible on-air and refuses to apologize for his crass and offensive statements. During his climatic Villainous Breakdown, he admits to being a Hypocrite and says he still won't apologize.
    
    **Barry Champlain:** I should hang; I'm a hypocrite. I ask for sincerity, and I lie. I denounce the system as I embrace it. I want money and power and prestige: I want ratings and success. And I don't give a damn about you, or the world. That's the truth: for that I could say I'm sorry, but I won't. Why should I?
    
-   _Us_ has Adelaide. While she is willing to put herself between her counterpart and her family for their sake, she can never bring herself to apologize for stealing the real Adelaide's life and leaving her to a life of living hell. Whether this is just part of "Adelaide"'s personality or the result of her suppressing her memories is unclear.
-   In one scene of _Wedding Crashers_: Jeremy had made a foul remark about one of the proper ladies in the wedding, earning him glares from the guests. He then makes this statement to John:
    
    **Jeremy**: I'm sorry. I'm not sorry. Okay? I'm not gonna apologize, I'm a cocksman! _\[gets glares from wedding guests again\]_ Tourette's.
    
-   Joanna in _You Again_ is this, first by refusing to acknowledge that her fiance's sister Marni is a former victim of her high school bullying, or that she even remembers Marni at all. When Marni confronts her about it in private and demands an apology by threatening to tell her brother the truth, Joanna gives a dismissive, insincere apology and insults Marni afterward, hardening Marni's heart further. The trope is finally subverted after Marni exposes Joanna's unpleasant past to Will (the brother/fiance), effectively ruining the wedding, does Joanna genuinely apologize to Marni, explaining that she feels awful about abusing her in high school and that she only lied about not remembering Marni because she panicked when she realized she was marrying into her abuse victim's family.

    Literature 

-   _Bartholomew and the Oobleck_: When Bartholomew snaps that he might at least say he's sorry for causing the rain of oobleck, King Derwin initially says that he's a king, and kings never apologize. Bartholomew chews him out and starts to leave, but then Derwin begins to cry and admits it _is_ his fault and he _is_ sorry.
-   Nanny Ogg's rant from _Carpe Jugulum_ after a priest tells her to repent. She's been a bit naughty her whole life (by religion's standards) but is a good person. Her fellow witch Granny Weatherwax also never apologizes, to anyone, for anything, because she's not sorry.
-   _Carrie_: A rare example of this trope where the character is very sorry for what they have done and believes that a simple apology is not enough. Sue Snell joins her friends in taunting Carrie and pelting her with tampons after she had her first period. She was disgusted with herself after a talk with her boyfriend Tommy Ross, who helped her realize how disgusting her behavior was. Despite this and Tommy calling her out for not apologizing, Sue does not apologize to Carrie because she thinks that an apology was not enough. Instead, she decides to have her boyfriend take Carrie to the prom so she can feel accepted for one night, with tragic consequences.
-   Susan of _Changes_ is very clear and unapologetic about hiding Harry's daughter from him for years. She considered it the best solution then and won't waste time worrying about "what ifs?" Harry understands and tells her simply they are through which Susan expected years ago when she hid Maggie away and isn't sorry for that either.
-   In _Children of the Black Sun_, Dremman, warleader of the Wolf Clan, is unwilling to even feign remorse for betraying Sierra, even after he has clearly failed and now has to work with Sierra again. Drugging her and selling her to a torturer was apparently a perfectly reasonable course of action under the circumstances, and why should he act like he did anything wrong?
-   In _Doctrine of Labyrinths_, Felix often neglects to apologize for the things he does to annoy or hurt others, sometimes because he thinks he's doing what's right even if it's against the rules, or because someone really needs to be taken down a peg. Other times he's needlessly reckless or cruel and is clearly ashamed of himself afterward, but is too arrogant and fearful of emotional vulnerability to admit it, or even feels that he's done something _too bad_ to be fixed with words (e.g. when he nearly kills someone during a rage blackout he insists it would be pointless and self-indulgent to say sorry, however guilty he feels). Him learning to swallow his pride and apologize more consistently is a crucial part of his Character Development in book 4.
-   _Martín Fierro_:
    -   At song III, before describing the Indians as The Savage Indian and an Always Chaotic Evil race, Fierro exaggerates this trope when he declares: "No one asks them forgiveness". Then he describes how Fierro was part of the invasion of the Indian territories and his little part in their genocide.
    -   After committing numerous murders, the only one Martin Fierro asks for forgiveness is God in song IX, when Fierro kills a lot of the men of the partida (soldiers who work as policemen) who tried to arrest him for his first two murders. He never apologizes to anyone else.
-   Satan from _Paradise Lost_ refuses to repent to God due to his pride that had him thrown out of heaven, even if God is willing to welcome him back if he does so, because, in his words, he would rather rule in hell than serve in heaven.
-   The classic Israeli children’s poetry book _That Kid Is Me_<sup>Hebrew&nbsp;</sup> , there’s a poem in which the narrator says he’s willing to suffer all sorts of punishments, from not being allowed to have chocolate to getting Corporal Punishment, so long as he doesn’t have to apologize.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In one scene on the Israeli series _Arab Labour_, Jewish-Israeli Meir asks his Arab-Israeli friend Amjad how to say ‘sorry’ in Arabic. Amjad initially says that there’s no such word, as it would be a huge humiliation for an Arab to apologise, but quickly says that word is _mut'asif_.
-   Downplayed on _Babylon 5_ with the character of Londo Mollari. He's shown to apologize several times throughout the series (notably in "The Gathering" and "The Geometry of Shadows"), but in "The Very Long Night Of Londo Mollari", it's revealed he was never sorry that he'd _done_ something, but that he'd been _caught_. It's not until he's willing — and able — to give a sincere, unlooked-for apology to his rival G'Kar that he's able to escape the coma his conscience had put him in.
-   Insufferable Genius Sheldon from _The Big Bang Theory_ doesn't apologize for anything he does. For him to apologize would imply that he was actually wrong, which is impossible for a genius like him, as his calculations for all things in life are always correct. He could never accept the possibility that he might be wrong, and thus he never apologizes. Of course, when push comes to shove, even he'll break down and try to make amends if he wronged any of his friends. He'll come up with a solution or compromise to the problem that he started, thus still making him look good, but that's as close as he gets to actually apologizing.
-   _Breaking Bad_: As Walt's criminal career progress, the side of him that would feel sorry for killing even in self-defense disappears. His pride also doesn't help, making his few apologies insincere and the sincere ones only happen when he is sedated. By the time of the final episode, even after admitting that his intentions weren't as noble as he tried to claim, he still never apologizes to Skyler or Jesse for everything he put them through.
-   In _Coach Trip_, Bruce and John got kicked out of the fourth season after Bruce picked a fight with the coach for no apparent reason. He then refused to apologize for doing so.
-   In _Extraordinary Attorney Woo_, the episode "The Pied Piper" has Young-woo and her coworkers defending a young man who kidnapped a school bus full of children. He turns out to be a Well-Intentioned Extremist; he's protesting a particularly brutal cram school which emotionally abuses its students and harms their mental and physical health, and he took the kids out for a day of playing outside to show them what they were missing. As such, when asked by the court if he has any remorse for his crime, he answers with a Blunt "No", and says he'd gladly do it all again, jail or no jail.
-   In _Friends_, Joey demands that his date stop eating off his plate. Shortly afterward, she gets the last slice of chocolate cake for dessert. When she comes back from the ladies' room, he's finishing the last bite and announcing "I'm not even sorry!"
-   Played for Laughs in an episode of _Full House_, Michelle hides some of her family's things, which she later returns. Among them is DJ's Milli Vanilli cassette. Upon discovering Michelle had taken it, Stephanie calls DJ out for accusing her of stealing the tape and demands an apology. DJ simply says "in your dreams". Stephanie accepts this anyway.
-   _Game of Thrones_: In Season 7, Gendry runs into Beric and Thoros and angrily yells at them for betraying him and selling him into slavery earlier, which almost got him killed. They refuse to apologize or make amends, saying that since he's still alive, he shouldn't be complaining.
-   In the _Home Improvement_ episode "Luck Be a Taylor Tonight", Fred states that he never apologized to any woman, and when Tim asks how many times has he been married, his response was three because he can't find a woman who understands him.
-   In _House of Anubis_, when Joy tries to talk to Nina about the former's kiss with Fabian, Nina asks if it's supposed to be her way of saying sorry. Joy responds by saying, "I wasn't going to apologize".
    -   Patricia has a moment like this too where she refuses to apologize to Eddie for accidentally spilling a secret of his, only it's justified, because she didn't actually do anything wrong, and was just being forced to apologize to Eddie so she could convince him to drop an article he was writing about the local ghost.
-   _H₂O: Just Add Water_: In the episode "In Hot Water", Lewis is accused of releasing a dolphin from the aquarium he recently was hired by and his rather vicious new boss calls the police. However, the girls, who actually caused said dolphin to break free, are able to return him. When Lewis demands an apology for all he went through, his boss scoffs at the idea. The police quickly call her out by threatening to inform her boss of the dolphin going missing, getting her fired if she doesn't do as Lewis asked. She reluctantly agrees to do so.
-   Uther Pendragon from _Merlin_ is unfailingly pompous and has a reactionary, gung-ho attitude that results in a _lot_ of innocent people being wrongly accused, tortured, imprisoned, and/or killed. His heavy-handed actions have devastating repercussions for Camelot, but he barely ever acknowledges this or shows remorse for the suffering he's caused. Even when he's actively proven wrong he refuses to take it on board, and as he's the King (moreover, the sort of King who'll gladly lock his own kids in the dungeon for days on end for defying him), it's understandable that people are reluctant to call him out.
-   On _NCIS_, Gibbs' Rule #6 is, "Never apologize. It's a sign of weakness."
    -   He does, however, admit that this doesn't necessarily apply when apologizing to a friend.
    -   Rule 18 provides a partial aversion: "It is better to beg forgiveness than to ask permission."
    -   When first informed of Rule 6, Bishop responds that she thought it being a sign of weakness was kind of the point, to which Gibbs unusually has no answer.
-   Angela from _The Office (US)_ refuses to apologize for her actions. This is exemplified in an episode in which she is given the task of calling up clients who were upset due to a company mistake.

-   Jean-Ralphio Sapirstein of _Parks and Recreation_ is an example that's Played for Laughs - in addition to being an obnoxious Jerkass, he's also completely shameless, immune from embarrassment, and even seems kind of proud of his spectacular failures.
    
    "Check it out: _two_ ankle monitors! Judge says it's the first time he's ever had to do that. Ya boy's a question on the state bar exam!"
    
-   Alice Cooper from _Riverdale_ never apologizes for what she's done, from harassing Archie even after she learned about his sexual abuse, gaslighting Betty while she was undercover in The Farm cult, enabling Polly's criminal behavior and her general Holier Than Thou attitude. While she sometimes sort of makes amends, it never sticks. It doesn't help that nobody ever fully calls her out or punishes her, giving her little incentive to make a lasting change.
-   This is discussed in one episode of _The Sopranos_ after Christopher gets out of drug rehab:
    
    **Tony Soprano**: So, what step are you at now?  
    **Christopher**: I did all the steps, except for the one where I'm supposed to go around and apologize to all the people I fucked over when I was using.  
    **Tony Soprano**: ...I think maybe you shouldn't do that one. You know, let sleeping dogs lie.  
    **Christopher**: Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

-   Dean Winchester from _Supernatural_ does not apologize for his harmful actions or admit his wrongdoings, often justifying himself by saying things like "I'd do it again," "I made the right call," or "That's not what I meant."
    
    **Dean:**: Yeah. I lied. But you were being an infant.  
    **Sam**: Wow. Even for you, that apology sucked.  
    **Dean**: Oh, I'm not apologizing. I'm telling you how it's gonna be.

    Music

    Forgiveness for the things I do_
    
-   Elvis Costello invokes this in his song "Hand in Hand" from _This Year's Model_ with the opening line "Don't ask me to apologize, and I won't ask you to forgive me." It sounds like an even compromise until you parse it.

-   _Fat, French and Fabulous_: Jessica is never sorry for the horrifying things she says or at least not as sorry as she probably should be. In fact, she usually responds to criticism with "You are welcome!"

    Professional Wrestling 

-   In a stretcher match against Shawn Michaels in _One Night Stand 2008_, Batista mouths off "I'm not sorry. I don't love you" to him before planting a Batista Bomb. This was an Ironic Echo to Shawn's _WrestleMania XXIV_ match against Ric Flair in which he says "I'm sorry. I love you" before giving Flair a superkick thus not only beating him but also ending his career, which was the main reason why Batista had started a feud against Shawn in the first place.
-   It happened again just a few months later after Chris Jericho smashed Michaels's head into a video screen, nearly permanently blinded him in one eye, and then tried to punch him in the mouth but hit Shawn's wife Rebecca instead. Even though Rebecca's injury was (technically) an accident, Jericho refused to admit responsibility and blamed it all on Michaels, saying it never would have happened if Shawn hadn't brought Rebecca into the ring with him. This set up Michaels's and Jericho's Unsanctioned Match at _Unforgiven 2008_, where Michaels whipped Jericho so hard with a strap that he broke out in welts and then continued to whale on him even after Jericho went into shock and was completely unconscious before the referees finally managed to calm him down.
-   Michaels himself once played this trope in _Wrestlemania 22_ promo against Vince McMahon. Coach interviews Shawn, noting he started the feud by mocking Vince by calling him a child and asking if he wants to make an attempt at an apology. Given the onslaught of humiliations Vince had put through over that one insult, Shawn asks why he should apologise for being honest.

    Radio 

-   _John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme:_ The Shadow Minister of Saying Something Stupid and Failing to Apologise For It has this as his job.

    **Shadow Minister:** You know, I think it's possible to apologise _too much_.  
    **Patsy:** Yes, yes, I do think that's possible. I don't _think_ that's a mistake _you've_ made.

-   Anne Boleyn is portrayed this way in _Six_, and proudly so. A large chunk of her solo "Don't Lose Ur Head" is her defiantly refusing to apologize for her outbursts and impulsive actions, even as she's about to be beheaded. The chorus even starts with, "Sorry, not sorry."

    Video Games 

-   Vico from _A Dance with Rogues_ will never apologize for anything he does or has done to the Princess and to others. The only apology he'll ever give the Princess is for raping her, but he only gives it if she slept with him in the Dwarven Inn and then goaded him into finally admitting he's sorry. He will not apologize if not asked right then and will never bring up the subject himself afterwards.
-   In _Final Fantasy XIV_, Emet-Selch is flippant about the chaos, mayhem, and death he's caused in his quest to undo the Sundering. Should the Warrior call him out on this, he takes it as flattery. At the end of _Endwalker_, Emet-Selch makes it very clear that although he was beaten _and_ has the benefit of hindsight now that his memories have been restored, he does _not_ regret what he did as an Ascian. He goes so far as to call his ideals "inviolate" and "invincible".
-   In _Nancy Drew: Alibi in Ashes_, the character Alexei refuses to apologize for treating **everyone** contemptuously all the time.

Unusually for the trope, however, he seems to learn from the experience; a number of later episodes have him telling her he's sorry for minor inconveniences.
-   _Bojack Horseman_. Part of what makes it difficult to reconcile with anyone he’s hurt: he stands by his choice, but he’s not happy with the results or having hurt someone, yet doing so won’t ensure the relationship will be mended nor that the situation will improve nor that everything will be the same as before. So he does nothing. And time passes.

-   In _Harriet the Spy_, part of the reason why Harriet's friends and classmates are so angry at her for the things she wrote in her notebook (along with the invasion of privacy with her spying) is her stubborn refusal to apologize for her actions. For her part, Harriet believes that one should never apologize for seeking and speaking out the truth (and that she thinks she should be apologized to for the theft and reading of her notebook). It isn't until she sees just how hurtful her words were (as well as a pep talk from her former nanny via mail, telling her she should apologize) does she come around and give a Heartfelt Apology to her friends and classmates.
-   _Harry and His Bucket Full of Dinosaurs_ had the episode, "Yo-hoo-hoo," where Harry and his dinosaurs play "Pirates," but Harry soon gets carried away with the game and starts ordering everyone around and being mean to them.
