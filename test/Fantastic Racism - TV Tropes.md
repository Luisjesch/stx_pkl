_"Racism was not a problem on the Discworld, because—what with trolls and dwarfs and so on—speciesism was more interesting. Black and white lived in perfect harmony and ganged up on green."_

"Fantastic" as in "fantasy" or _fictional_, not as in "awesome", obviously.

Now that we got _that_ out of the way, Fantastic Racism is a subset of the old trick of dealing with thorny issues through metaphor. Instead of having The Hero encounter racism between, say, white and black people in the American Deep South, or between ethnic Czech and Roma in the Czech Republic, or between Ainu and Japanese, or any other sets of real-world groups, they encounter "racism" between two-headed aliens and three-headed aliens, or between people with earth-themed elemental powers and people with water-themed elemental powers, or between shapeshifting squid-people and shapeshifting octopus-people.

Not to be confused with Space Jews, in which an imaginary species or culture has disturbing similarities to a real-world racist stereotype. Also related to Have You Tried Not Being a Monster?, where said monsters are usually used as a metaphor for other types of discrimination, oftentimes discrimination based on characteristics perceived by the bigot to be alterable, "curable", such as an alternative sexual identity, a disability, or a different religion/religious differences (the two tropes can often overlap in the case of religion), rather than race or ethnicity. Fantastic Slurs are often involved, as are Monster Rights Movements. Real Life weaselly lines like Some of My Best Friends Are X may feature. The undesired minorities may be rounded up inside a Fantastic Ghetto, and may also be the targets of Superhuman Trafficking. Conversely, they may form an Outcast Refuge away from the oppressors to live in (relative) peace.

Futuristic science fiction examples of human-on-alien Fantastic Racism will often make the human racist a member of a group historically discriminated against on Earth (such as a black character in an American-created work) both to emphasize that human-on-human racism is a thing of the past, and for the sake of irony from the viewers' perspective.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

If the point of the story is to show the evils of racism, this trope can lead to a Broken Aesop if there are in fact good in-universe reasons to discriminate against a certain type of creature (say, because they need to eat other sapient beings in order to survive, or they genuinely are Always Chaotic Evil apart from the odd angsty heroic one, or they're just potentially-dangerous enough that one doesn't strictly have to be an absolute incorrigible raving xenophobic lunatic to consider making certain... _precautions_ (at least against the loose cannons) to be a good idea).

Also note that Tropes Are Tools: most people wouldn't believe in a world where elves, dwarves, aliens, etc got along with perfect harmony, because their own experiences of different groups' interactions don't bear that out. It's called _Fantastic Racism_ for a reason.

If the racism appears to be spilling into something a little less fantastic and into something more real, it's Values Dissonance.

Compare Superior Species, in which one species actually _is_ objectively superior in some way; Species Loyalty, which may but does not need to entail this; and Master Race, when it's just in their head (and is probably a metaphor for Those Wacky Nazis for further bad-guy points).

See also People of Hair Color (which can be another occasion for racism in fantasy), Dehumanization (where one race is dehumanized to make them easier to kill) and Demonization (where negative character traits are fabricated, exaggerated, and generalized in order to justify some form of prejudice and hatred). Death Means Humanity is one potential resolution to any conflicts born from fantastic racism in which the death of a non-human being makes a human character recognize that being's personhood and value.

    Advertising 

-   Between meerkats and mongooses in the Compare the Meerkat campaign. During "The Battle Of Fearlessness" Alexandr's "grandpappy" fought in a war against them.
    
    **Q**: _Isn't a meerkat a type of mongoose?_
    
    **A**: _NO! This great insult! Mongoose not good enough to lick dropping from my shoe! I am meerkat and I live in mansion filthy mongoose could only dream about in wildest dreams._
    
-   The GEICO cavemen ads could be seen as an example of this... which leads to Unfortunate Implications, when you consider that the campaign is essentially mocking the victim for getting offended.
    -   In fact, it mutated over time; the first few ads were about the admakers themselves being totally unaware the cavemen existed to be offended and trying to run damage control. Then they kept using the ads.
-   This Sonic commercial. You actually feel bad for the vampire.
    -   Again with Sonic, where the police talks with a ghost about someone rattling chains and moaning. The ghost takes offense to this only for moments later to see a guy on the other side of the parking lot doing just that.
    -   The fact that he's being profiled by a black cop causes people no end of amusement.
    -   It seems that Sonic's new ad campaign is 'Sonic is Fantastically Racist', because they have a commercial where a robot isn't allowed to eat the food because it's 'People Food'.
-   The "Crazy Good" Pop-Tart ads are this in a nutshell: various humans and animals trick, trap, and cook the Pop-Tart people alive so they can enjoy delicious pop tarts. Sometimes the humans and animals will fight each other (lightly) for a pop tart as well. Occasionally even the Pop-Tarts themselves end up going after each other, and have to fight a human for the opportunity to eat one their own.
-   The Trix Rabbit is an unintentional example: the whole reason the kids give for not letting him have any Trix is simply _because_ he's a rabbit and "Trix are for kids", which comes across as a pretty lame reason (imagine if someone in real life said "\[some food here\] is only for white people.") This isn't helped when the kids are willing to give a bowl to Bugs Bunny, but once the disguise the Rabbit dons fails, take the bowl away from him.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Garfield_ hates dogs with a passion. For example: he once wore an "I Hate Dogs" t-shirt which got him beaten up by a bunch of dogs after he wore it outside, thinking dogs were too dumb to read; much of his stand up material that gets him forcibly pulled off from spotlight on the fence consists of anti-dog jokes; one strip had Jon tell Garfield that evolution consisted of lower organisms evolving into higher life forms, and Garfield concluding that rocks evolved from dogs; and finally a very early strip goes something like this:
    
    **John:** Garfield! A mouse, get it!  
    **Garfield:** No! I refuse to abuse one of my furry brothers. _(Drop kicks Odie)_ I reserve my abuse for the lower life forms.
    
-   In _My Cage_, Norm's neighbour, Bernie Turkey, is a "flight supremacist" who belongs to a group called the Coo Clucks Clan.
-   _Peanuts_:
    -   An August 1973 storyline had Snoopy challenging Hank Aaron for Babe Ruth's career home run record...and getting hate mail telling him "go back where you came from" and "we hate your kind", similar to what Aaron was getting in real life.
        
        **Snoopy:** I just want to be a credit to my breed!
        
    -   "NO DOGS ALLOWED!"
    -   Snoopy also has Charlie Brown write a letter to the producers of a TV cartoon complaining that the animal characters were portrayed as "silly and stupid", and also considered boycotting their sponsor.
    -   On the other hand, Snoopy _does_ have an irrational fear of snakes.
    -   There's also his hatred of cats (which could be justified because the cat living next door is genuinely mean and scary, although Snoopy goes out of his way to provoke him). He "celebrates" National Cat Week by loudly booing. And he and Woodstock once made a list of all the things they loved about dogs, using a _huge_ sheet of paper; and then pulled out a tiny scrap of paper for listing all the things they loved about cats. ("We'll probably have lots of room left over.")
    -   In another strip he says he has the world's largest collection of "anti-cat jokes".
    -   Snoopy can also be a Boomerang Bigot, as in an early strip in which he declares he's tired of being a dog, he's tired of associating with dogs, and that if he were human he wouldn't even _own_ a dog.

    Music 

-   The song "Xenophobia" by Bill Sutton is about, well, hating aliens.
    
    Let's be xenophobic! It's really in this year
    
    Let's find a nasty, slimy, ugly alien to fear
    
-   "I'm In Love With A Big Blue Frog" by Peter, Paul and Mary, is set in a community which is prejudiced against big blue frogs:
    
    The neighbours are against it, and it's clear to me,
    
    And it's probably clear to you,
    
    They think value on their property will go right down,
    
    If the family next door is blue.
    
-   "The Trees," by Rush.
-   Señor Wooly: In "Billy y Las Botas", the anthropomorphic scarf Billy hates other kinds of clothing. He hates gloves, jackets, and even hats.
-   The _Sesame Street_ song "Being Green" was originally written as a plea to understand people who are different and not judge by appearance.

    Podcasts 

-   Solvin the elf from _The Fallen Gods_ doesn't think much of Tuatha other than that she's the "half-human" of the group (she’s also half-elven). On the other hand, Tuatha hates wizards (though she's quick to clarify that that's classism, not racism).
-   Lachlan from _Jemjammer_ explains that unfortunately, prejudice against Half-Orcs is present in many spheres, though some are better than others and there are many that don't judge them at all. He mentions his home of Eberron as a place where they're looked down on but not necessarily persecuted. He faced playground bullying for being half and half, but had loving parents. He also wants to find an all-orc city out in space.

    Professional Wrestling 

    Radio 

-   _Dimension X_'s "Pebble in the Sky": Bel Arvardan's unconscious/systemic racism is completely removed in this adaptation due to the need to keep it under thirty minutes, but everyone else's mutual hatred of Earthman vs Outsiders is kept intact.
-   Star Wars Radio Dramas: From Luke Skywalker, of all people. When Luke sees the hologram game on board the _Millenium Falcon_, he assumes Han has to play the ship's computer. Obi-wan has to explain to him that Chewbacca is an intelligent being who can play games of strategy with Han.

    Religion 

-   In _The Qur'an_, Iblis the Djinn refused to bow before Adam, because Adam was made of clay and Djinn were made of fire, which somehow made them superior according to him. Though, if you're a Muslim, you're gonna drop the "fantastic" part.
    -   And possibly God's reason for demanding Iblis bow to Adam.
    -   Angels are also considered by some Muslims to be below humans because they lack free will, so their worship of Allah is not worth as much as a human's, which do have free will.
-   Also gotta drop the "fantastic" part if you're Christian, but some Christians believe God will give humans authority over angels in Heaven, and a few go as far as to say he loves humans more because we're said to be "made in His image." _The Bible_ itself is silent on this matter, and if anything it would seem that God loves all of His creations equally, but the concept has made its way into a few works (such as _Dogma_, _Supernatural_, and _Constantine_) which portray angels as being bitter, angry, and jealous of humanity over this issue.
    -   Some Christians believe the opposite, that we are lower than angels because they never sin.
    -   Demons are portrayed as hating all of humanity and trying to drag as many into Hell with them as possible. They also are implied to hate angels too, but there is only slight reference to this; a "war" in Heaven, and Satan trying to antagonize Archangel Michael over Moses' corpse.
-   According to Buddhism the Nagas (snake-like spirits) and the Garudas (bird-like spirits) were embroiled in a Forever War until Buddha helped them to attain peace.
-   The myth of a primordial hatred between to races of deities, one of Chaos generally seen as giants and monsters and another of more civilized heavenly (and more humanoid) beings is common in most Indo-European myths which is probably some sort of allegory about civilization defeating barbarism. These myths include the war between the Olympians and the Titans in Greek Mythology, Aesir and Jotuns in Norse Mythology and the war between the Devas and Asuras in Hinduism. In some cases the war was long before won by the heavenly (like in Greek mythology) in other the war is still going on (like in Norse and Hindu).
    -   For Zoroastrianism the battle is among the Ahuras considered to be good heavenly beings and the Daevas (demonic monsters), exactly the opposite than in Hinduism.
    -   In Buddhism it's also mentioned that Asuras (sometimes translated as "demigods" in Western sources) and Devas (translated as "gods" but not considered in Buddhism to be really divine or eternal) are in a perpetual war. However in Buddhism the Asuras are not really demonic like in Hinduism (the equivalent of "demons" in Buddhism would be the Maras) they are just (alongside humans, animals, demons and prettas or "hungry ghosts") part of the six Buddhist realms (forms that someone can be reborn into, although some more secular approaches of Buddhism see them more as states of minds). As Buddhism is more pacifistic the Buddhist myth also establishes that Devas normally manage to repel the Asuras without hurting them.
-   In Maori mythology, the Maero are a race of Frazetta Man Precursors who were displaced by Maori settlement and forced to flee into the mountains, and thus harbor a hatred for humanity.

    Roleplay 

-   _The Chaos Zone_'s portrayal of Rika (a human engineer) has questionable views of the kappa in Gensokyo, feeling like she's been left in the shadow of the technologically-advanced race. She _is_ more accepting of the mountain-dwelling yamawaro (especially Takane), though their own business with the kappa means when Rika works with the yamawaro, she has to be stopped from doing things like throwing around slurs in public.
-   _Dawn of a New Age: Oldport Blues_ has various visions of the future that show the negative reaction the public have to the existence of superheroes: the protagonists are forced to abide by curfew, are blamed for the country's degradation, and are eventually sent into hiding as the government starts to hunt down and exterminate them.
-   _Fire Emblem on Forums_:
    -   _Wonderful Blessing_: Two major examples:
        -   Revivians, humans taken from Earth to reincarnate into Generia are largely dismissed as odd, weird and slightly insane by Generian natives. It doesn't help that the stereotype of them (which a few live up to) are as overly-obsessed Otaku with a fascination with living out their Perverse Sexual Lust.
        -   Demons and Demon Races have some minor prejudice, but it doesn't seem to interfere too heavily with their integration, with a goblin-Revivian marriage passing without comment and gargoyles being part of a popular adventuring team.
    -   _Solrise Academy_: The Belgor faced heavy prejudice in the past, due to being seen as shifty and omens of bad luck. While the prejudice has largely faded in the present day, Mordecai, a Vampire (in this setting a Belgor subrace) still fears it from time to time.
    -   _Laguz Test FEF_: As in their original games, the Laguz and humans don't always get along too well. Within the main party, Joachim (a Cat Laguz) despises Milos (a human) and even Ella (another Laguz) for being a bigot and being too eager to cosy up to humans (as Ella is carrying out a secret romance with a human prince). Milos is largely terrified of Laguz, though his fear (and thus dislike) of them fades throughout the story.
-   _There is no GATE; we did not fight there_:
    -   Most humans of the Empire are heavily prejudiced against the many demihuman species scattered around the setting. Likewise, many demihumans bear grudges against humans (and other races) for a number of reasons.
        -   Even in Rhavenfell, where racism is much less present due to the many contributions of various races on the frontier over the years, most people still have certain prejudices against demihumans. However, the Rhavenfells' efforts towards integration have been slowly chipping away at the racial tension.
-   Pretty much the basis of _This Is War_, where the supernaturals were forced out of their home countries by the government doing this, only to find similar from the people in Britain.

    Stand-Up Comedy 

-   Parodied with a fictional and very unsubtle children's story in Bo Burnham's stand-up act:
    
    The squares lived happily in their square houses, in their square yards, in their square town.
    
    But then, one day, a family of circles moved in from the west.
    
    "Get out of here, roundies!" shouted one of the squares.
    
    "Why?" said one of the circles.
    
    "Because this is a metaphor for racism!"
    
-   Martin Pearson has a rant about this in _The Unfinished Spelling Errors of Bolkien_ (aimed at the producers of _The Lord of the Rings_ movies):
    
    "What is this inability to put dwarves on screen?! SPECIESIST, THAT'S WHAT IT IS!"
    

    Theatre 

-   In _Orpheus: A Poetic Drama_, Hades is suspicious of Eurydice, a water nymph, as others like her helped alert Demeter to Persephone's location back when he abducted her.
-   _Seascape_: A surrealistic play about an old married couple—Charlie and Nancy—at the beach who are startled to encounter two lizard people—Leslie and Sarah—who crawl out of the ocean to have a chat. Leslie the aquatic lizard-man hates fish, calling them dirty and stupid. Charlie is amused greatly by this, calling Leslie a bigot.
