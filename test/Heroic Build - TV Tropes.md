No hero is complete without a bodybuilder's physique.

_"Why are superheroes always so good-looking?"_

We all know that certain things come along with having superpowers. No, we're not talking about responsibility, justice, or even the American way (or whatever is their Evil Counterpart, for the morally villainous). We're talking about a great body.

Wherever spandex and capes are found, so too are sculpted chests, broad shoulders, narrow waists, and washboard abs. Wherever there are chainmail bikinis, there are large breasts, curvy hips, and shapely legs. It could almost be called a secondary power in itself - the ability to have a perfect physique.

This is true even for heroic men whose powers do not include physical strength, such as psychics, speedsters, and super-scientists. For example, you wouldn't expect someone with an Imagination-Based Superpower to have a bodybuilder's physique just from concentrating on things really hard, but it is so. It's just become a convention of the genre, and many comic book artists don't know how to draw in any other way. Even ordinary civilians will often be implausibly muscular.

This is mostly Justified, since many superheroes/supervillains seem to spend a great deal of their off time training rigorously, or for that matter, running around and getting exercise on the job (that goes double if it’s a Badass Normal superhero with no powers like Batman or Green Arrow, or even if it’s a hero with skills centered on fighting and martial arts like Goku). Basically, being a hero or villain, especially a superhero/supervillain, often means that you’ll be getting a lot of exercise and physical activity on the job, so you’ll probably be losing weight and building muscle really fast. It’s also for that reason why you don’t see many fat and overweight superheroes/supervillains running around. Because if a someone like that did become a superhero/supervillain and actually made a successful go out of it, they probably wouldn’t stay fat or overweight very long.

Or maybe they're this way after getting their superpowers. Although one should note that, for females at least, reducing body fat tends to make a figure a lot less lush than that of the typical superheroine/supervillainess. And forget about Stout Strength.

Note that in classical sculpture, the term "heroic proportion" refers to characters with healthy figures who stand eight or more heads high (i.e. their head is an eighth or less of their total height). This imposing figure was used for statues of Greek gods and later biblical figures (Michelangelo Buonarroti's _David_, for instance). It is a given that almost all western superheroes and supervillains are eight-and-a-half heads tall or more, and most fashion designers sketch their ideas onto outlines of over eight heads. However, in early Marvel comics, as well as a few from other houses, this rule was subverted: heavily built figures were often drawn with huge heads in proportion to their height so that they looked squat and burly despite being over six foot (see early versions of the Thing, Hulk or the Kingpin).

Exceptions

    Art 

-   Some cultures did not have the same standards for heroic proportions as those of the West. For example, medieval Japan favored stocky builds with barrel chests, believing that strength originates from a person's core. For this reason, samurai were often depicted with big bellies, in contrast to the heroic V-shaped torso.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Tiger & Bunny_, Mr. Legend wasn't just an old, fat superhero — he was an old, fat superhero that just happened to be the best damned superhero of his time, and possibly the first superhero. You know, when he wasn't beating his wife.
-   Most characters in _Naruto_ e.g Tsunade, Sakura, Sasuke, Itachi and Naruto's dad Minato are extremely powerful despite being very skinny. Played with however as Naruto has a Heroic Build with his shirt off and there are strong characters like A and Killer B who are muscle-clad.
-   In _Yowamushi Pedal_, Tadokoro Jin is one such member of Sakamichi Onoda's team. Sure, he may be a big eater and may come off as a fat cyclist. But he tends to get more better. Which leads to his buff stature.
-   _Fire Force_:
    -   Captain Obi of Company 8 has trained immensely to catch up to his superpowered teammates despite having no pyrokinetic abilities. Not only does this make him incredibly ripped, but as a result of his daily intense regimen, he has become a powerhouse who possesses strength bordering on superhuman levels.
    -   Maki Oze, thanks to her time in the military before joining company 8, maki is a very lean and muscular young woman. Due to her well muscled build and military training, she is considered to be the second strongest member in terms of close quarters combat.
-   _Berserk_: Griffith pre-Eclipse demolished the muscle-bound Guts effortlessly. Judeah and Serpico also are bean polls who are capable of taking out larger foes.
-   In _Toriko_, The main protagonist after the name of the series, is a heavy eater. But yet never gets fat. Yet when it comes to hunting for food, he has a Bruiser with a Soft Center attitude of for others even Komatsu, as if he was his very own brother or son.
-   _Dragon Ball Z_:
    -   The Saiyans are a race of Big Eaters. Goku is the best example of this that he will eat until his belly balloons. Despite this, Goku has no fat and has muscles everywhere. Though exactly how closely he resembles this trope varies from arc to arc and based on which transformation he's using at the time. When he was a kid, he was a somewhat pudgy Pint-Sized Powerhouse. As a young man in the 23rd Budokai and Saiyan arcs, he resembled a lean, cut, but not particularly buff bantamweight martial artist- fitting his official stats of 175 cm (5'9") and 62 kg (138 lbs) fairly well. Whenever he used Kaio-Ken, though, he would bulk up _enormously_ and resemble a bodybuilder. From the Freeza arc onward, he started to be drawn like a huge bodybuilder all the time (when not in combat).
    -   Goku's son Gohan is introduced as a scrawny child...who's still super-strong. He gets more muscular as he gets older, but he's always more slender and has smaller biceps than his father even during the periods when Gohan is the strongest person in the series. In _Dragon Ball Super_, he's become quite scrawny due to his life as a scholar, until he takes up training again for the Tournament of Power.
    -   Unlike most of the heroes, Krillin has a small build and can't dish out the level of power the Saiyans, Half-Saiyans, and Namekians can. However despite his size Krillin is still a Physical God compared to us puny mortals, he along with Tien and Yamcha have enough power to blow Earth into space dust if they wanted to. Tien is a completely straight example of this trope (bordering on exaggeration at times given his enormous biceps), being the tallest of the human characters and absolutely ripped. While Yamcha is of average height and fit but relatively slender, befitting his day job as a pro baseball player.
    -   Android 19. Gero gave him a fat, Gonk design. He is still quite powerful, being many times more powerful than Frieza.
    -   Android 20, based on old man since he is Dr. Gero. He's stronger than 19, or so he claims. Android 20 is Gero's Brain in a Jar with a robot body, and he apparently made that body look exactly like his discarded human body.
    -   Android 17 and 18 are built like skinny teenagers, but the pair were still strong enough to slaughter the Z-Fighters and commit near-global genocide in the Bad Future. _Dragon Ball Super_ reveals that 17 only appears to be skinny as one of his sleeves is torn off and his arm is very toned underneath. However, played with as the hulking Android 16 far outstrips 17 & 18 in terms of power. Word of God eventually revealed that Android 16 was designed to look exactly like Dr. Gero's deceased son, who was a Red Ribbon Army soldier.
    -   Future Trunks starts out as slender but decently muscular. He trains for a year in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber and comes out completely jacked. Then he attempts to fight Cell with the Super Saiyan Grade 3 transformation (see below) and becomes an exaggeration of this trope. But when he returns in _Dragon Ball Super_ he's gotten slender again yet is much stronger than when he had the gigantic biceps.
    -   The Super Saiyan Grade 2 and ridiculously muscly Super Saiyan Grade 3 transformations turn any Saiyan into this trope. Each grants a massive increase in power, but Grade 3 proves useless because it brings a huge decrease in speed.
    -   Buu's forms mix this around. Fat Buu is the least dangerous (and eventually the weakest) of all the other Buu forms, who fit into the Lean and Mean category, but he is still one of the strongest characters in the series. His fat body absorbs almost all damage and he uses his fat to crush people. Given his malleable body, Fat Buu can _make_ himself look like this trope and has done so a couple of times, but normally doesn't bother because it doesn't actually make him any stronger. Evil Buu and Kid Buu, who are both more powerful than Fat Buu, are both very skinny, the former to anorexic extremes. And finally there's Super Buu, the strongest and most intelligent of the Buus, who plays the trope straight by being muscular (albeit with a lean fighter's physique rather than an exaggerated bodybuilder's) and _extremely_ tall nearly 244 cm (8').
-   _One Piece_
    -   Despite being the strongest of the main characters, Luffy is a rather beany person, something that is often lampshaded. When the Time Skip kicks in, Usopp becomes unrecognizable in the physique depatment, gaining a Heroic Build while Luffy remains as skinny as ever. He is also _much_ stronger than Usopp. While Usopp has indeed gotten much stronger by building those muscles, he's still below average New World pirate standards.
        -   Subverted however as Luffy can expand his muscles at will and Gear 4 gives Luffy the muscle mass of the Hulk, something Usopp lacks. Luffy also has gained a legitimately bulky build ever since the beginning of Wano Arc.
    -   Played with as males like Sanji, Rob Lucci, and especially Silvers Rayleigh have skinny builds thanks to the art style but remain some of the strongest fighters in the series. And yet at the same time underneath their clothes they all possess a Heroic Build.
    -   Admirals Kizaru and Aokiji. They are both very lean people, yet they are second only to the Four Emperors in strength. This is mostly because their Devil Fruit powers don't rely on brute strength, though Aokiji was shown to have a Heroic Build in _One Piece Film: Z_.
    -   Shanks is a good example as while he has a relatively fit build, he doesn't have the enormous muscular figures that Whitebeard and Kaido possess and is tiny compared to them; but he still matched the humongous Whitebeard in a clash...one-handed. Likewise for Shanks' Friendly Rival Hawkeye Mihawk, the world's greatest swordsman who effortlessly wields a sword taller than his own body and is fit but relatively slender.
    -   Yonko Big Mom is fat old woman, who wrecked Luffy with ease and walked through an iron door like it was cardboard.
    -   Blackbeard, who took Whitebeard's place as a Yonko and is one of the top contenders for overall Big Bad of the series, is a portly man with disproportionately thin limbs for his enormous size. He's still got immense physical strength on top of having one of the strongest Devil Fruit powers (later two of the strongest).
    -   Sabo, 2nd in command of the Revolutionary Army, has a similar slender build to Luffy (to the extent that, when Luffy was wearing a face-concealing gladiator's helmet, Sabo was able to impersonate him by simply wearing the same helmet and painting a copy of Luffy's burn scar on his chest). He's also strong enough to destroy an entire arena with a fire-enhanced punch, and to crush an inch-thick steel mask with one hand.

    Comic Books 

-   Subverted with Hulkling in _Young Avengers_. His heroic build is just shapeshifting to emulate the jocks at school. Before that, he was a runt. Annoyingly, Hulkling keeps this muscular build even after being exposed to a device that should reveal his true form.
-   _X-Men_:
    -   The Blob is a Nigh-Invulnerable Fat Bastard. His resistance to damage is derived from his excessive elastic-like skin. He's also quite strong and shockingly agile for his size and build.
    -   Nightcrawler is usually depicted with either a gymnast or a swimmer's body (or sometimes just out-and-out scrawny). When he is drawn especially muscular it's usually his legs rather than torso that are overdeveloped.
    -   Cyclops was initially quite a scrawny lad, hence his nickname "Slim." However, he has long since filled out.
-   _Great Lakes Avengers_:
    -   Big Bertha has complete control over her adipose tissue, and the ability to create "superbulk" in her body that basically turns her into a female version of the Blob (though not quite as Nigh-Invulnerable as him). She also only has her superhuman strength and durability while bulked-up.
    -   Flatman pretty much doesn't need to have a Heroic Build, given his stretching powers, and due to being flat most of the time, doesn't appear to have much of a definition as all. On the _exceedingly_ rare occasion where he is depicted not flattening himself, he appears to have a rather average body.
-   Static notably doesn't have this because he is first of all, a normal, somewhat skinny teenager, and also because his powers have nothing to do with his body, physically.
-   _Fantastic Four_:
    -   Ben Grimm, a.k.a. "The Thing", is a mishmash. In the comic books, as Ben Grimm, he's fairly muscular; as The Thing, he's pretty much rectangular with no definition at all. In the movies, Michael Chiklis as Ben is less sculpted, but Thing has distinct abs, biceps, and triceps.
    -   During John Byrne's run, he drew both Reed Richards and Johnny Storm skinnier and less buff as they looked when they first appeared in 1961.
-   _The Incredible Hulk_: Bruce Banner is not particularly muscular or defined as himself (Bill Bixby, who played Banner in the TV show, was widely regarded as having the proper physique); how sculpted he becomes when he Hulks out depends on the artist.
-   Let's not forget Fatman, the Human Flying Saucer!
-   Subverted by _Herbie the Fat Fury._ Superficially he is a fat, rotund, bespectacled loser with a Moe Howard haircut, with a costume consisting of red long johns and a toilet plunger on his head. But armed with his magic lollipops, he has enough powers and abilities to take on anyone like bank robbers, alien invaders, and _Satan_.
-   _Avengers: The Initiative_ member Butterball is overweight, and because his Nigh-Invulnerability powers prevent his body from changing, will always be overweight.
    -   Before they gave up on training him, the Initiative program theorized that a starvation diet would probably cause him to lose weight but it would take months.
-   In _Major Bummer_, Gecko and Francis are both very skinny.
-   Red Tornado of The DCU — not the current Red Tornado, but the Golden Age Red Tornado — a chubby, crimefighting housewife named Ma Hunkel.
-   Roxanne Spaulding (aka Freefall) of _Gen¹³_ is _usually_ drawn as having relatively small breasts and moderate curves, at least compared to her teammates Fairchild and Rainmaker. (Emphasis on 'relatively'.)
-   Peter Parker in _Ultimate Spider-Man_ retains his scrawny teenage physique even though he has superhuman strength. In the regular Marvel comics, Spidey's physique was sometimes closer to a jogger than a bodybuilder, Depending on the Artist. On the other hand, it's also not unusual for characters to be surprised by those firm biceps that uber-nerd Peter Parker is hiding under his baggy shirt. Usually said biceps are (when displayed by the skintight Spidey suit) merely well-toned rather than massively bulging like most superheroes.
    -   Some will even draw him very thin. You will often hear artists say that Spider-Man has a gymnast's body. While female gymnasts tend to be very small and thin, male gymnasts are actually quite muscular, if slim.
-   Nightwing was an acrobat and usually portrayed as such. A tad muscular for that, but only occasionally did someone draw him as a full-on bodybuilder.
    -   Likewise, in Batman comics, Tim Drake (Robin III/Red Robin III) is usually drawn as leaner than Nightwing. While they can both end up more muscled, Depending on the Artist, they are usually shown on the leaner side in comparison to Bruce and Jason.
    -   Also Damian Wayne, justified as he's only about 10-11 years old.
-   Big Atomic Lantern Boy of The DCU's Super Young Team is a little chubby, but not truly fat. He tries to hide it under a Badass Longcoat, with moderate success.
-   _Top 10_ plays this straight only with a few characters: Smax, Peregrine, and King Peacock. Other than that, the cast ranges from scrawny (Shock-Headed Peter, Toybox) to paunchy (Spaceman, Irma Geddon, the Word) to simply average (Synaesthesia, Jack Phantom, Dust Devil). Of course, given the setting — a city where Everyone Is a Super — this only makes sense.
-   Lobo, supreme icon of Sheer Manliness (and example of Testosterone Poisoning), had kind of an average build in the first issues of _Justice League International_ that he appeared in, but as his popularity grew, so did his physique. Depending on the artist, he makes Mr. Olympia look like Woody Allen, often becoming Top-Heavy Guy.
-   Like Spider-Man, The Flash (any of them) are often drawn as "jogger" rather than "bodybuilder". Which makes sense since they're fast rather than strong. This does vary between them, however, with Wally and Jay (who was a football player in college) tending to be closer to this trope than Barry and Bart.
-   The Kingpin, of _Daredevil_ and _Spider-Man_, is a borderline case; while he lives in a superhero universe, he has no powers. Thus, Stout Strength is invoked rather than Heroic Build.
-   In _The Avengers (Jonathan Hickman)_, Kevin Connor is a scrawny teenager who receives superhuman strength and durability (among other destructive powers) from the Starbrand, yet still stays just as physically skinny as he was before he got the powers.
-   Kate Kane is drawn rather lean in _Batwoman (Rebirth)_, possibly to reflect her official height and weight (5'11" and 141 pounds, respectively). She resembles a boxer or MMA fighter more than a bodybuilder.
-   Brody from _Brody's Ghost_ is initially a mere ghostseer with a lanky frame and beer gut. But as he's trained into a more muscular appearance, his powers also begin getting stronger to match.
-   Honor Guest (The Silencer), a former assassin, has a lean, muscular build that one would expect from someone in her line of work.
-   As his name would suggest, Bouncing Boy from _Legion of Super-Heroes_ is usually depicted with a big round belly, and he actually inflates when he bounces.
-   The New Mutants were all drawn as scrawny, gawky teens, and it wasn't until years down the line — after puberty and intensive training in the Danger Room — that they gained the standard superhero body. The one exception is Roberto, who was always in shape due to being a star football player before his mutant power appeared.

    Fan Works 

-   _Child of the Storm_ has most of the younger cast as this, both thanks to the author's desire to include slightly more realistic body types, and the fact that they're teenagers. Harry, for instance, is short and skinny as he is in _Prisoner of Azkaban_, and even after malnutrition is corrected for and he undergoes a growth spurt, he's still described as somewhat gawky as he grows into it, being compared to a half-grown falcon. Even once he has, he's more athletic than heavily muscled, and both he and resident speedster Jean-Paul are described as having dancer's builds by the sequel.
-   Iris in _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_, who is the most physically capable member of Ash's group, is described as lacking a curvaceous body type. Gary Oak later describes her build as "a track team member". Nonetheless, Ash and several others consider her fairly attractive in her own way.
-   In the cyberpunk Transplanted Character Fic _The Artisans of War_ by Odon, one of the bodyguards of the Big Bad is wearing body armor sculpted in the shape of a muscular torso.
-   Luz, after morphing for the first time in _POWER RANGERS: Owl Force_, gains a more muscular build as a side effect of her powers to be conductive to the ranger lifestyle. Eda comments that she _really_ misses this aspect of her former ranger powers now that she's older and less physically fit than she used to be.

    Literature 

-   _Guards! Guards!_ has Carrot Ironfoundersson, an enormous muscular human who was raised by dwarves. He undertakes an uneventful 500-mile journey to the city, with the narration noting that people with his sort of build often have uneventful journeys.
    
    -   Even his name is a reference to this:
    
    The young man is called Carrot. This is not because of his hair, which his father has always clipped short for reasons of Hygiene. It is because of his shape. It is the kind of tapering shape a boy gets through clean living, healthy eating, and good mountain air in huge lungfuls. When he flexes his shoulder muscles, other muscles have to move out of the way first.
    
-   The female version often comes with an hourglass figure: this is deconstructed at one point in _Soon I Will Be Invincible,_ when female cyborg Fatale observes that her torso has to be roomy enough to accommodate a miniaturized power core. Most of the other female characters play the trope straight, to her chagrin.
-   An interesting example in _Warbreaker_, the returned have the appearance that is, to their individual taste, perfect, along with the fitness that comes with it. However, they are useless in a fight, because their pampered lifestyle leaves them unprepared for pain and they have no combat training unless they had it when they died.
-   In _Wearing the Cape_, Atlas, the setting's Superman character, wears a sculpted muscle-suit that mimics a Mister Atlas body. Elsewhere, Hope notes that not all superheroes can get away with spandex, and the Hollywood Knights are chosen not just for their powers but also for their physiques (often the result of personal trainers and plastic surgeons).
-   _Wild Cards_: most "Aces" look like regular humans. And the "Joker-Aces" are those who got both powers (hence "Ace") and deformities (hence "Joker") from the same transformation, e.g. Bloat.
-   _Worm_: "Case 53" describes those who lost their human shape as a side effect of a Super Serum. This can range from fairly benign to utterly grotesque.
-   _Second Apocalypse_: Cnaiur the berserker Barbarian Hero is often described as having broad shoulders, a huge back, and a narrow waist.

    Live-Action TV 

-   While _Power Rangers_ toys and merchandising range from "realistically muscled" to "standard buff superhero" to "ridiculously overexaggerated", the show itself averts this as the Ranger suits show no definition at all. Well, with three exceptions: Andros and Shane got muscle definition as part of their "Battlized" Super Modes (done in order to match the toys); and Xander got a magic spell that gave him gigantic bodybuilder musculature.
-   _Batman (1966)_: Due to the standards of men's fitness being much lower than in modern times, Batman and Robin's physiques look downright ordinary compared to comics and modern super-heroes. At the time, they were considered to be sex symbols.
-   Most males in the _Buffyverse_ like Giles, Oz, Gunn, and Wesley don't have a Heroic Build but can easily match those who do. Played straight on both genders as Buffy and the rest of Slayers plus female vampires like Darla, Drusilla, and Harmony have lithe figures and yet are incredibly strong. In fact, you have a harder time finding those who are muscular or have large builds like Angel, Spike, Lindsey, and Hamilton.
-   A fair number of _Heroes_ don't fit into this trope, including but not limited to Hiro Nakamura and Matt Parkman.
-   A lack of this is justified in _The Flash_ by the fact that Barry has both a healing factor and a metabolism that is extraordinarily fast. When he first gains his powers, he keeps blacking out due to low blood sugar. Cisco states that he needs to consume the equivalent of 850 tacos _a day_ just to break even on his energy consumption. For those playing at home, that's _tens of thousands_ of calories. This explains his lean, low-body fat build common to long-distance runners, as getting fat or building more muscle mass would require even more food. As he finds out in the first episode, the lightning that gave him his powers threw in another bonus...
-   _Loki (2021)_ has Classic Loki, which was Richard E. Grant in a very faithful recreation of the original comics costume. Grant stated that early in production he asked "So it's in the green Lycra bodysuit with muscles", and they responded it would not be padded, which he jokingly added to have made him "very distraught" at not being able to look like he had muscles, "having been born without any". Grant even had to share a concept art that looked like what he thought. 
-   _Ultraman_: Ultraman was mean to be tall and lean to emphasise his alien origins, which is reflected in the A-type suit used during the first 14 episodes. While Art Evolution led to Ultraman gaining an increasingly muscular build as the series went on, _Shin Ultraman_ saw a return to the original tall, lean build present in concept art.

    Mythology & Religion 

-   Samson from The Bible is an interesting case: there was an archæological site found where he allegedly pushed the stone pillars and killing all those Philistines; the evidence showed the broken pillars were probably pushed by a large man with such a physique. Many religious Jews used it as proof of the historicity of the Bible; however, Israeli writer and columnist Meir Shalev pointed out in his column that Samson is actually described as a frail-looking man, far from the image we often think of him today since his supernatural strength came from God he might have not had the Heroic Build people think of.

    Video Games 

-   While still quite fit, Link from _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_ is very short and slender, dwarfed even by the petite Princess Zelda. Several NPCs he runs into will express disbelief that he's the Hylian Champion and chosen wielder of the Master Sword simply because he looks too slight to even use it properly.
-   Leon S. Kennedy from _Resident Evil_ has a pretty skinny frame but still displays feats of Super-Strength and equals the muscle-clad Chris Redfield in physical combat.
    -   The same logic applies to Albert Wesker even though he has visible muscle mass but lacks the sheer bulk of Chris (but nevertheless demolishes the latter in their fights). This trope applies to the lithe RE ladies such as Jill Valentine, Claire Redfield, and Ada Wong.
-   Geralt of _The Witcher_, while taller than most characters and visibly muscular, is rather lean, built more like a distance swimmer than a bodybuilder or heavyweight fighter. This is in stark contrast to Letho, as noted in the exaggerations below.

    Webcomics 

-   _Sidekick Girl_: Most sidekicks got their position because they did _not_ have this- Val and Hazel are flat, Jasper has a gut to go along with his massive musculature, and nobody can tell what Chris's gender is. The one known exception is Sparkle, who had the attributes but didn't pass her all her classes in hero school.
-   _Grrl Power_: While most superheroines are incredibility photogenic and highly muscled, the main character Sydney Scoville is not, due to her powers coming from an external artifact. Harem is also fairly average looking compared to the others.
    
    **Sydney:** I didn't realize it was possible to feel both skinny and fat at the same time.  
    **Sandy:** This place is just magic like that.
    
-   Averted by Amazi-girl from _Dumbing of Age_ who is downright pudgy, as various characters remark at one time or another
-   In _C Karrus_ most of the men seem to have this, heroes and villains alike.
-   In _Axe Cop_, Reality Warper superhero Uni-Man was originally drawn as a deliberate aversion — he originally gained his powers from being really smart, so he looked like a stereotypical skinny old professor. Eventually, though, he transformed himself to become really buff, dwarfing the other male heroes who usually play the trope straight. A couple of others are also exceptions, though, including the skinny Leaf-Man and Mr. Stocker, the superhero with no powers who also doesn't look like a superhero at all.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, Grace could choose to use a bodybuilder's physique as "Shade Tail" since she's a shapeshifter but doesn't because she doesn't have the skill to pull off having beefy muscles _and_ good dexterity and prefers to use a compromise form.
-   _Kill Six Billion Demons_: World's Strongest Man Jagganoth has a notable strongman build rather than a bodybuilder build, with a visible gut instead of sculpted muscles. His One-Winged Angel form has a heroic build, but that form is implied to be shaped by Jagganoth's Atum rather than a 'true' physical shape.

Justifications

    Anime & Manga 

-   The commercialized nature of superheroics in _Tiger & Bunny_ makes appearance just as important as actual heroics (especially for heroes marketed on their sex appeal, such as Blue Rose and Barnaby Brooks Jr.). Thus, HeroTV's provided the heroes with training facilities, which they use quite frequently in their downtime.
-   The soldiers of _Attack on Titan_ are all shown to be in _incredible_ shape, with washboard abs and lean, muscular physiques. It's entirely justified, as their equipment and standard method of fighting requires them to be able to perform on the level of an Olympic gymnast or professional acrobat. A strong core and powerful leg muscles are noted to be absolutely vital to using the 3-dimensional Maneuver Gear safely. Since the artist uses professional Mixed Martial Artists as models and references, their builds tend to accurately reflect how different body types build up muscle.
    -   Levi in some ways can be considered an aversion, being one of the strongest and most skilled characters while he's of slight build, short and has more delicate features (aside from his ever present death glare).
-   In _Fire Force_ recruits seeking to be a part of the Fire Force companies, must not only have sufficiently powerful pyrokinetic abilities, but also undergo rigorous physical training, as being in great physical condition is essential to be a member of one of the eight companies they are assigned to. However, Captain Obi of Company 8 takes this to a whole other level. Due to having no form of pyrokinesis, he has to train like hell every single day to compensate. This has made him not only incredibly jacked, but has also given him near superhuman strength. Maki Oze is another member of Company 8 who developed an incredible physique from her military service in Tokyo’s armed forces. Due to her second generation powers not being the best in terms of offensive capabilities, she has to rely mostly on raw strength and her adept CQC skills when on active duty.
-   In _Sailor Moon_ Minako, Makoto, Haruka, Ami, and Michiru are the only ones among the Sailor Soldiers shown to actually work out (Minako) or otherwise do intensive sports (Haruka is a runner, and, at least in the anime, Ami and Michiru swim often, Makoto prctices martial arts). Fittingly, Minako and Haruka are stated to be the most in-shape of the Senshi, much to Minako's chagrin, as she had been _tricked_ into starting to work out in her solo series and she only realized the result when her new muscles caused her to rip her costume's skirt.
-   In _Tokyo Ghoul_, being in peak physical condition is a basic requirement for most Ghoul Investigators. Their career involves taking on superhuman beings that are physically superior to them in every fashion, so being in the best possible shape is necessary for survival. Some take it to greater extremes, with people like Koutarou Amon and Kuki Urie shown to be obsessive in their training regimens and absolutely _ripped_ as a direct result. In _:Re_, training facilities are shown and discussion is held about the importance of being physically prepared because major Combat Operations are like very violent marathons, taxing them to their limits.
-   In _Devilman_, the demonic fusion that grants Akira his powers also gives him an impressively athletic figure in his default human state. Just how dramatic the change is varies by installment or adaptation, ranging from fairly subtle in the manga to impossible to ignore in _Crybaby._
-   _My Hero Academia_: Most of the main characters are or are in training to become professional superheroes, a job that requires a lot of physical exertion and Quirk use, and have the musculature to show for it. A large part of U.A.'s curriculum is devoted to making sure students can survive the exercise they're going to get on the job.
    -   Any user of One For All _has_ to be this, since the Quirk affects the body's muscles and is so strong that an unprepared body would _explode_ if it were to be used. Izuku took a 10-month Training from Hell regimen to be able to use its bare minimum- and _still_ broke whatever limb he channeled the Quirk with. All Might _was_ a prime example, but is currently emaciated due to a devastating injury. This also limits the amount of time he can be a hero.
    -   Mirio Togata is shown to have a very muscular body-and is openly stated to have trained immensely. This is one of the reasons why Sir Nighteye and Nezu had proposed All Might to have him inherit One For All... Well after All Might had started training Izuku.
    -   Star and Stripe, the number one American hero, idolized All Might and emulated herself after him to the point that she used her Reality Warping power to permanently bulk herself up like him.
-   In _Black Clover_, Asta is almost freakishly muscular for his age due to subjecting himself to Training from Hell from an early age to make up for his lack of magic. Captain Yami is pretty much the only character who exceeds his muscles, because most Magic Knights rely exclusively on their magic to fight and thus don't bother to exercise. After the Time Skip, further training has rendered Asta even _more_ ripped, making him look like a shorter version of Yami. Aside from those two, Klaus of Golden Dawn also becomes visibly muscular after being inspired by Asta to combine his magic training with muscle training. While Mereoleona, being a Blood Knight who values all types of power, is far more muscular than any of the other female characters.
-   Male martial artists in _Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple_ have such bodies due the formidable training they undergo (even Daimonji is quite muscular, and often brags about all the time he spends working out). There's very few exceptions, and they have good explanations too:
    -   Kenichi starts out very skinny because he's a beginner, and never seriously worked out. As the series goes on, he starts gaining muscles and the proper build.
    -   Tsukuba is the vice-captain of the Karate Club, and while muscular he's not very developed due training as much as expected from a high-school karateka.
    -   Koga the Kicker, of Kisara's Technique Trio, is simply very short and doesn't train much. He quickly becomes a speed bump during the Ragnarok Arc before disappearing completely.
    -   Loki's Shadows look exactly like him, Heroic Build and all... Except for one who looks like him but fatter. An omake shows that the Shadows deliberately dress themselves and dye their hair to resemble Loki, but the chubby one can't stop himself from overeating.
    -   Koetsuji is much skinnier than most masters because he has absolutely no excess body fat. Once his shirt is removed he's revealed to be just as muscular as the other Masters, he just doesn't have their bulk.

    Comic Books 

-   DC Comics's _Major Bummer_ (see listing at Missed the Call) has a sculpted physique due to Imported Alien Phlebotinum but he uses it as little as possible.
-   Caitlin Fairchild of _Gen¹³_ went from a Hot Librarian to Amazonian Beauty because that's part of the powers she gained, as evidenced by an attempt to copy her Super-Strength that also resulted in another superpower... on a guy.
-   When Jon Osterman's original body was destroyed in a Freak Lab Accident he built himself a new one based on the ideal male form to become Doctor Manhattan of _Watchmen_.
-   The X-Men, when drawn more muscular, do have the justification of all the workouts in the Danger Room.
    -   They've also tried to justify this a few times with the idea that mutants generically get an Olympic-level physique and Spidey-level rapid healing. It never really took.
-   Archangel explicitly has zero body fat and peak human musculature as part of his mutation to support his wings.
-   Steve Rogers (a.k.a. Captain America) has a rather impressive physique, justified by the Super-Soldier Serum that turned him into the peak of physical perfection.
-   Batman. We see him training all the time, and his abilities solely come from that physical training. Same with Jason Todd, Green Arrow, Wildcat, etc.
    -   When Colin Wilkes turns into Abuse, he gains this build, but is more heavily built than the average hero due to it coming from the same stuff Bane uses.
-   Venom (when he was first introduced, rather than the Huge Dude he became later), in contrast to Spider-Man, was _enormous_. This was because Eddie Brock was a nigh-obsessive bodybuilder.
    -   Flash Thompson was in the military for a few years and before that was heavily into sports so it makes sense that he'd be muscular. However, he is still smaller than Eddie.
-   Justified by _Power & Glory_, as A-Pex is the product of a government-sponsored project to create a patriotic super-heroic ideal. Too bad he has a crippling fear of disease that leaves him incapable of fighting anyone...
-   Teddy Altman a.k.a. Hulkling in _Young Avengers_ has a perfectly muscular classical build because he's a shapeshifter and deliberately changed his body to look more like the buff boys he saw in the school locker rooms.
-   When transformed, the Guardians of Kandrakar from _W.I.T.C.H._ look like they'd _want_ to look when older thanks to their magic. This is best shown by Cornelia, who, being perfectly happy with her body shape, merely transforms into an older version of herself.
-   In _Marshal Law_, the Public Spirit uses anabolic steroids to maintain his physique.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Of Quirks, Dwarves, One For All and Arkenstone_, Izuku Midoriya and Bilbo Baggins undergo a "Freaky Friday" Flip every few days, living out a day in each other's lives. During this time, they discover that the effects of physical exertion from either end of the flip ends up affecting both of them. So Bilbo ends up working out in Izuku's body while Izuku works out in Bilbo's body to prepare himself to use One For All. Combine that with the protein-rich and energizing hobbit diet and you have one leanly muscular teenage human and another sturdily built hobbit. Bilbo ends up so muscular that a Dwalin, a warrior dwarf, initially mistakes Bilbo for a warrior and ends up challenging him to an arm wrestle that Bilbo would have won if not for the dwarf bailing out.
-   _The Pieces Lie Where They Fell_: Captain General Gentle Step of the Royal Guard has this, and she's worked for it - her body muscle mass is described as having "seemed to belong to an earth pony that had trained themselves to the cusp of being unhealthy opposed to a unicorn".
-   _Miraculous Ladybug_ fanfic often describe Marinette and Adrien as rather muscular, justifying it with baking without electric tools (something that requires solid muscles) and having to always run to not get late at school for Marinette, the gymnastics required to stay in shape for his modeling career and his sports activities for Adrien, and the extreme physical efforts they take as Ladybug and Chat Noir for both.
-   Invoked by Hachiman in _My Hero School Adventure Is All Wrong As Expected_, who gave himself a Bruce Lee\-quality build in a matter of months. Since the basis of strength training is damaging one's own muscles in just the right way and at the right pace for the body to rebuild itself stronger little by little, Hachiman came to the realization that he could combine the muscle straining aspect of his copy of One for All with his Healing Factor to bypass any need to actually exercise. While this does have its fair share of drawbacks — the procedure is very, very painful, requires abundant nutrition to maintain, and he had to forgo the chance to include more gymnastics, martial arts training, etc. into the regime — Hachiman does manage to cram years of physical conditioning into less than one, giving him at least a chance to endure the physical aspects of U.A.'s Hero Course.

    Films — Animation 

-   _The Incredibles_: Mr. Incredible is a Justified example, as he is indeed shown to lose shape with age until he started training again. He doesn't go all the way back to his youthful heroic build, either.
-   Kristoff of _Frozen_ due to being both an ice harvester and adopted by trolls, who are _really heavy_ rocklike beings who often climb on him.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Stephen Amell of _Arrow_ fame justifies Oliver Queen's physique by performing most of the stunt work himself, which he would not be able to do without being exceptionally in shape himself. Numerous scenes in Season 1 were dedicated to watching Oliver work out (shirtless, of course), and a Training Montage in Season 2 shows him exercising in order to become ready for the acrobatic fighting and parkour-based movement he uses.
-   In _The Boys (2019)_, Queen Maeve and A-Train are seen working out. The costumes also bring up the physiques to the max given the "Supes" are exploited by a corporation - the costume designer was delighted to take down a Double Standard in The Deep, whose pants clearly accentuate his rear.

    Video Games 

-   Chris Redfield from _Resident Evil_ got his Heroic Build and enormous strength after a decade of extensive workouts so he could stand a better chance against various Bio-Organic Weapons (read: huge mutants) and especially his Lightning Bruiser Arch-Enemy Albert Wesker. It generally worked. Notably, in _6_, after spending half a year as a drunken amnesiac, Chris is in noticeably worse shape than in _5_, though his strength didn't suffer much.
-   Compared to the rest of the magic users in _Fire Emblem Fates_, Odin is quite muscular (with his Dark Mage outfit flaunting his figure to boot), and although he starts off in a class that can only cast magic, his strength growth and magic growth are almost equal to one another, and his initial reclassing option is a class that uses swords. As he's actually Owain from _Fire Emblem: Awakening_, who was a sword-wielding myrmidon in that game, it's far more than justified, and this is actually addressed in his supports with Hinata and Orochi in the _Revelation_ path of the game.
-   The _Wii Fit_ trainer has the body one would expect out of a fitness professional (slender and curvy as a female, muscular as a male). Although the character's feats only turned superheroic on _Super Smash Bros._...

    Webcomics 

-   Part of the premise of _Sidekick Girl_ is that the Hero Agency actually _selects_ for this, so almost all heroes are buff and heroines are bombshells. For the _exceptions_ to that rule (who become sidekicks), see the Webcomic folder on the 'exceptions' section.
-   _Grrl Power_: Apparently, whatever it is that causes humans to manifest superpowers also causes them to develop a perfect build, regardless of whether this should have anything to do with their powerset. Sydney (whose powers come from the orbs she carries rather than being innate) occasionally feels intimidated by this effect. However, super_villains_ also get this treatment due to the same genetic quirk.
-   Tiger from _Spinnerette_ was revealed to have gotten his bulky musculature, at least in part, from the Spirit of the Tiger. When he and Dr. Universe had their powers swapped, Tiger became much leaner, while Universe puts on a lot of muscle overnight.
-   _Kill Six Billion Demons_: God-Emperor Solomon David is The Perfectionist and is implied to have intentionally sculpted his body to look as divine as possible to his subjects. Given that his martial arts grandmasters all had normal body shapes and were no less powerful for it, it is likely said muscles are literally meaningless to his actual power.

    Web Original 

-   _Whateley Universe_: The Exemplar power set, which usually shapes bearers into looking like their ideal self, justifies this in-universe; an estimated 20% of WU mutants have some degree of this trait because they think it's the ideal.
    -   However, even those with the Exemplar trait don't always possess this, since the power doesn't have to work from an idealized version of themselves, or their ideal self isn't what they expected. In some cases, its a reflection of their worst fears instead. A heroic build is merely the most common result of this.
    -   Also, since the Exemplar power works at least in part on the mutant's self-perception, it can go to exaggerated degrees as well, such as Bravo's absurdly-sized Lantern Jaw of Justice or Attributes' large chest.
    -   It is noted early on that those superheroes and supervillains who don't have this trait, but try to wear tight suits anyway, tend to come across as laughingstocks.
    -   Attempts to duplicate the Exemplar trait by Devisors and Wizards are frequent, and almost invariably fail. The closest successes to date were Compiler (who gained a Barbie-doll like figure by means of nanotechnology but now cannot control her super-strength or super-speed), Spark and Reach (who did it by accident), Delta Spike (who entrusted her life to a Mad Scientist and who might have been brainwashed into total subservience in the process), and Jobe's Drow (who were completely transformed into dark elves by the serum) <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . For the majority, such as Migraine (who became trapped in an immobile exoskeleton and went insane), it didn't work out at all. Outside of the school, there are several examples as well, such as Dr. Venus' treatments (both those she uses herself and those for her 'studmuffins'), Akelarre's potion, and whatever it was which Belphegor appears to have used by 2016, but most have some limitations attached to them (for example, Dr. Venus' treatments only last a limited time, and eventually need to be renewed, or replaced by some new treatment).
-   In _Worm_, Triumph's powers specifically aid in forming such a physique while Browbeat can use biokinesis to adapt such a physique.
-   In _Brennus_ the Adonis expression of the Physique power reshapes the body according to their perception of attractiveness, much as in the _Whateley Universe_. Among Western men, it often results in this.
-   One of the key reasons the _Plumbing the Death Star_ episode "Why Isn't Nightcrawler Fat" exists is that there are no conventionally fat members of the X-Men even if most of them have powers with no relation to physical exertion. Ultimately, the three cast members agree to the "Joel Duscher Bird Theory," the idea that mutant powers must burn calories and fat like physical exercise, although that comes with its own problems and Fridge Logic.

Exaggerations

    Anime & Manga 

-   Alex Louis Armstrong of _Fullmetal Alchemist_ could, in brief, be described as three ordinary men worth of muscles crammed into a frequently disappearing shirt. His devotion to displaying his exaggerated musculature at all costs is both frequently comedic (at one point he forms a lifelong friendship with the similarly strong Sig Curtis by having a flex-off) and a pretty overt case of Author Appeal.
-   _How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?_: Most of the men who attend the Silverman Gym have hugely muscular builds. Taken to ridiculous levels with Naruzo Machio, who first appears like a normally slender, handsome young man in a tracksuit, then he strikes a bodybuilder pose and the suit gets shredded to pieces, revealing he's ''packed'' (and even gains some height). He somehow _shrinks_ back when he puts on another tracksuit.
-   _Kengan Ashura_, by the same team as _Dumbbells_, does feature a decent variety in terms of heights and weights among its roster, but the vast majority of fighters are improbably buff, or at least far more cut than they should be. Of the thirty-two competitors of the manga's main Tournament Arc, twenty-nine of them have washboard abs. The remaining three are Stout Strength\-types, including a sumo wrestler, and all three of them are eliminated in the first round.

    Comic Books 

-   _Eight Billion Genies_:
    -   The genies are Reality Warpers who can grant virtually any wish. As such, it's a trivial thing for them to give someone exaggerated physical proportions, such as giving a child biceps bigger than his own head.
    -   When Robbie wishes for his genie to transform him into a powerful superhero strong enough to protect his parents and find a safe haven for them amidst the chaos, the genie follows his childish drawing to a T, making him so huge that his arms are as big as his formerly child-sized body. Meanwhile, his head and face remain unchanged, poking above his muscles thanks to his equally muscular neck.
-   _Superman_:
    -   The adult Superman is one of the earliest and most blatant examples since in the comics and cartoons he is nearly always shown to have a bodybuilder's physique, despite the fact that his powers originally came from his species being highly evolved. Later this was changed to sunlight _and_ Krypton having a higher gravity, then just sunlight.
    -   In Superman's earliest appearances, he was fairly lean. Later interpretations generally gave him a bodybuilder physique, or at least a fairly buff one.
    -   Kryptonians still get stronger by increasing muscle mass. That's why Power Girl works out so much.
    -   His original designs were based on the circus strongmen of the time.
    -   Superman's physique probably also reflects what's considered "impressive" during various time-eras. For example, Curt Swan's Superman looked in-shape, but not ridiculously muscular. Contrast his appearance by various modern artists, where he looks like he'd give Arnold Schwarzenegger's physique a run for its money.
    -   Pre-Crisis, the Fortress of Solitude was sometimes shown with specialized workout equipment (a robot sparring partner for boxing practice appeared in the first Fortress story, for instance). Ditto the Golden Age Superman; in his mountain retreat, had some specialized workout equipment. (Said equipment appeared again in a Bronze Age "Mr. and Mrs. Superman" story). As Clark, he worked during the Silver and Bronze Age at Ma and Pa Kent's general store (not a farm) for most of his childhood/teen years, and (to protect his identity) seldom participated in sports.
-   Rob Liefeld is immensely fond of drawing grossly exaggerated human physiques, hence the parody character Bloodpouch<small>◊</small>. At least in one example, his picture of Captain America, is due to him using a bodybuilder as reference to present Steve Rogers with much larger muscles (but he uses one of a bodybuilder flexing his pecs and arms, something he doesn't show Rogers doing).
-   Strong Guy from _X-Factor_ has an immensely exaggerated musculature. Also justified in that a childhood accident with his mutant powers permanently deformed him (he didn't learn until afterward that he needed to quickly use his enhanced strength, i.e. hit something, in order to shed the excess bulk), and he's in constant pain because of it.
-   The Juggernaut from _X-Men_ is often depicted often almost as broad as he is tall, with fists bigger than his head. This insane physique comes from the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak, which makes him unstoppable (and makes him resemble Cyttorak himself). When he's not using the gem's power to its fullest, his physique remains big, though the proportions are considerably less impressive.
-   Tom Strong has the title character parody both this and Top-Heavy Guy. He's drawn with a physique that is just slightly exaggerated. He's got a huge torso and comparatively skinny legs — not to the point of cartoonishness, but more like he's very slightly deformed. Indeed, it's actually implied he is, being described by multiple characters as looking like an upside-down triangle — which just happens to be his Chest Insignia.
-   _Star Wars (Marvel 1977)_ was all over the place with regards to this trope and Luke Skywalker. Towards the end they usually averted it completely<small>◊</small>... except in the very last issue<small>◊</small>, which also inexplicably removed his shirt and gave him a huge gun he did not use once.
-   The _Doctor Who Expanded Universe_ comics apply this to the Eighth Doctor<small>◊</small> (while he's shaving and wearing his Goofy Print Underwear), even though, thanks to his rather numerous Shirtless Scenes in the film, we know for a fact he's not quite that chiseled and muscular. Kind of trim and athletic, but not a six-pack in sight.
-   Danny from _Next Men_ is this and a bit of an inversion of Top-Heavy Guy. A kid speedster, from the waist up he is toned, but otherwise has the average proportions of a mid-teen. From the waist _down,_ his thighs and calves are massively disproportionally muscular, (To be fair, his universe lacks a handwaved energy source that other speedsters derive their energy from). On average, he seems to have a pro bodybuilder's legs. Drawn at its most exaggerated, his legs are drawn even bigger, as in; _just one leg is wider than an adult's torso,_ bigger!
-   The short-lived Malibu Comics superhero _Prime_ had an _extremely_ exaggeratedly muscular build—since his appearance was a young boy's idea of what a superhero should look like.
-   _Megaton Man_ was specifically designed to lampoon this trope with everything from his overly muscular physique to a lantern jaw larger than the rest of his head.
-   _The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe_ and DC's _Who's Who_ would often correctly surmise that various characters probably didn't work out that much, especially the Mad Scientist or Non-Action Guy types, and described them as "engaging in minimal physical exercise." Then you looked over to the picture, and you could count their six-pack through their jumpsuit.
-   Wolverine! Even without the adamantium, Logan is 200lbs of pure muscle, which is a lot for most people but is absolutely insane for a guy who is only _5'3_. Though it's somewhat understandable given that his healing factor regenerates and therefore grows muscle tissue much faster than on most people, not to mention the fact that anybody with 100lbs of indestructible metal in their skeleton would need to bulk up significantly to even be able to move.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Spoofed in _The Goodies_. In "U-Friend of U-Foe", faced by an apparently hostile UFO, Graham declares that they must convince the aliens that humans are a race of supermen! Cue the Goodies ducking into a line of phone booths so they can put on superhero tights. Bill's comes with a padded chest that gives him some difficulty re squeezing out of the booth, but he tries to bulk himself up further with a bike pump. Hilarity Ensues.
-   Likewise in _The Kenny Everett Video Show_ spoof Captain Kremmen, the eponymous space hero has a shirt that inflates into the appropriate muscled build.
-   In _Too Many Cooks_, Miranda's physique is emphasized fairly strongly when she first poses (in civvies) for the camera.
-   From its 2000 revival, until 2019, almost every main Kamen Rider had a perfectly identical physique once they henshin. The reason: with two exceptions<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , they were all played by one man, Seiji Takaiwa, who's often called Mr. Heisei Rider for this reason.

    Pinball 

-   Exaggerated and subverted in Data East Pinball's _Tales from the Crypt_, which shows a bodybuilder with a toned, idealized muscular Heroic Build... and the wrinkling, balding head of an old man.

    Toys 

    Video Games 

-   _Immortal Souls_ kind of takes this to silly degrees in its comic book-style art, giving everyone who engages in combat an exaggerated bodybuilder physique. And by everyone, we mean the women (who have She-Hulk muscles to go with their Most Common Superpower), the Fat Bastard thugs, the ghosts, the zombies, the mutants, all of the animal monsters, and the human guys in form-fitting Power Armor. _Everyone_.
-   In _Dragon Ball Xenoverse_ (1 and 2) you can scroll the body-bar all you want but the male Saiyans/Earthlings will still be as muscly as hell<small>◊</small> while the female Saiyans/Earthlings have super-model physiques. Subverted only with the Buus as while the female Buus are lithe, the male Buus are all fat.
-   _WWE All-Stars_ features goofily pumped-up, muscle-bound caricatures of yesteryear and modern figureheads like John Cena, Rey Mysterio Jr., Hulk Hogan, and The Ultimate Warrior.
-   Due to the way the character creation tool works in _Saints Row: The Third_ and _Saints Row IV_, your character can look _ludicrously_ musclebound. Note that it has no impact whatsoever on the Boss' physical strength, which will always be the same no matter how fat, scrawny, or buff they are. Oleg also qualifies, and so do his clones.
-   Montana from _Battleborn_ possesses an extremely exaggerated muscular build that's practically Rob Liefeld-like in design. Even the very game itself notes him as being "biologically improbable".
-   _The Witcher_ contrasts Geralt's relatively lithe build with Letho. Letho is absolutely jacked, including rather ludicrously proportioned biceps. Even among other more muscular characters (Skelligan tough guys, Eskel, and such), he stands out as remarkably swole. _Literally_ remarkably, as when Geralt is asked early in the second game if he could identify Letho, Geralt's response is to say it won't be a problem, as he's never seen "such a mountain of a man."
-   Marvin Seo's Thrall mod for _Darkest Dungeon_ introduces a former slave gladiator character class, the eponymous Thrall, who looks rather like he was put together from vast quantities of spare meat and pointed in the general direction of something punchable. Look at this guy.<small>◊</small> He barely fits in one slot in the hero lineup. His comic portrays him coming up against a more traditional handsome and muscular hero, who manages to annoy the Thrall in the arena and gets his head reduced to a red splatter for his trouble.
-   A _Dragalia Lost_ 4koma has Luca take on this appearance in Euden's nightmare, with the latter frightened at the sight of the former. This was remade into a sticker for use in multiplayer communication.

    Webcomics 

-   _Beyond the Canopy_ parodied this when Greliz draws a poster depicting Glenn (who's scrappy but not at all muscular) as a mix of Conan the Barbarian and the Hulk. Another character points out "Muscles don't work like that."
    -   Happens again in an April Fools' Day comic: the comic briefly turns into _Fist of the North Star_, and Glenn is drawn as Ken.

    Web Original 

-   This was parodied in a _Homestar Runner_ cartoon; Strong Bad discusses a hypothetical Strong Bad action figure, which looks remarkably like this. Strong Bad lampshades it by claiming it would look "just like him," specifically mentioning the relative sizes of his head and body. In an Easter Egg, Homestar, Strong Mad, Strong Sad, and Pom Pom get the same treatment; the action figures' physiques are Liefeldishly overmuscled, even Pom Pom and Strong Sad, who are literally spherical. This is a bit of a poke at the old _Masters of the Universe_ line, which also had nearly every character sharing the same cartoonish bodybuilder mold only distinguished by skin color.
-   This trope being associated with WWE wrestlers is parodied in _Hogan Vs Flair_ by the created wrestler TF British and his ludicrously muscular self.
-   Gully of _Worm_ has massively over-developed musculature to the point of nearly being hunchbacked. She's been passed over several times for promotion by the Protectorate because of her appearance and is understandably bitter about the whole situation.
-   _Dragon Ball Abridged_: According to Chiaotzu, Tien's shoulders are so beefy from all the training he's done that his doctor has expressed concerns about his health. When reminded of this before another training session, Tien just scoffs, "That's why we don't see \[that doctor\] anymore."

    Western Animation 

-   On _Max Steel_, Steel becomes obsessed with comic books and alter the suit. One of the changes he makes is giving Max 20 abs. This is promptly mocked by everyone else.
-   In one episode of _Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts_, Kipo and the gang are caught in a Lotus-Eater Machine, each with their own individual dreamworld fantasy. In Wolf's, she and Kipo are both living as six-foot, gravelly-voiced megamute hunters with _incredibly_ huge and chiseled muscles.

    Other 

-   Bodybuilder physiques on action figures was a general trend in the '90s. While it (somewhat) made sense for characters like He-Man who's so muscled he shouldn't be able to move, it looked downright weird for, say, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo.
    -   And of course being surrounded by these physiques leads to body dysmorphic disorder, which ultimately leads to obsessive exercising, use of steroids, etc. And you thought only girls had it tough. Not so in The '90s!
-   Many children's Halloween costumes have exaggerated chest and arm muscles, even if the character they are dressing up as is not so buff. The most obvious example is probably Spider-Man, who is toned but slim in most incarnations, but the costumes look like bodybuilders.
-   In an appearance on _The Tonight Show_, Jeff Goldblum brought on his action figures from _Jurassic Park_ and _Independence Day_, to show "how much he bulked up between the two movies".
-   On _The Red Green Show_, Ranger Gord, who is slender and lanky, has a cartoon segment in which he is portrayed as having an astoundingly muscular physique, so much so that when he bends an arm or even a finger, there is a metallic squeaking sound.
