While in Real Life the concept of beauty is very subjective, in fiction there is a clear consensus on beauty. In addition, beauty tends to be dynamic, as some characters get uglier or more beautiful than before.

This scale is to show how beautiful someone is _to the rest of the cast_, not to the audience (differences happen).

Please note that this isn't a meta trope, nor a subjective trope. All beauty should be measured as it is portrayed inside the story.

## Sliding Scale of Beauty

    open/close all folders 

    Level I: Intolerably Extreme Beauty 

    Level II: Divine Level Beauty 

## Level II: Divine Level Beauty

For these people, "gorgeous" would be an insult. Their beauty is so great, it appears to be nothing short of divine intervention (and it may well be). They might attract heterosexuals of the same gender. They are so beautiful, in fact, that everyone loses control of themselves simply by looking at them. You could stare at them for hours. Just the fact that a character is hot is not enough to qualify them for this trope. Indeed, many of these characters fall into Informed Attractiveness. The character must be explicitly stated to be the world's most beautiful woman/person, hence why this trope is usually limited to fantasy and mythology, two genres that tend to go light on real-world logic (Was there a worldwide beauty contest that every woman alive was forced to enter?). Of course, having two (or more) individuals contending for the title is usually not good, and you really, really, really want to limit it to mortal competitors. Asserting that a woman is more beautiful than a goddess is dangerous. Even...especially if she's another goddess.

**Comparisons:** Vain Sorceress, Angelic Beauty, Inhumanly Beautiful Race, Hot God, Hot Witch

    Level III: World Class Beauty 

## Level III: World Class Beauty

These characters are extremely good looking. It isn't uncommon for numerous characters mentioning their attractiveness often. They always have a lot of people after them at all times. Their beauty is magazine cover-worthy and they are usually envied a lot. Beyond that, characters don't act particularly different around them.

**Comparisons:** The Beautiful Elite, Amazonian Beauty, Proud Beauty, Hot Consort, So Beautiful, It's a Curse, Screw the Rules, I'm Beautiful!, Ms. Fanservice, Mr. Fanservice.

    Level IV: Common Beauty 

## Level IV: Common Beauty

These characters are "slightly" beautiful. They are certainly attractive, as in, there is something "special" in their appearance, just nothing "extraordinary". They are beautiful enough to have admirers, but not enough to live off their beauty. Cute characters and Loser Protagonists are often in this category.

    Level V: Imperfect Beauty 

## Level V: Imperfect Beauty

These characters would be very beautiful, if it wasn't for some kind of flaw that ruins their beauty. Maybe it is a scar, glasses, a tail or another kind of flaw or uncommon trait. Sometimes related to "Freakiness Shame" when other characters think those uncommon traits actually enhance their beauty. Also of this category are characters who aren't beautiful but ruggedly handsome, the kind of appearance which is only enhanced by scars, Perma-Stubble, intimidating demeanor or the like.

    Level VI: Good-looking but Uncanny 

## Level VI: Good-looking but Uncanny

These characters are undeniably beautiful or handsome, but there is also something about their appearance that looks subtly wrong or creepily unnatural.

**Comparisons:** Uncanny Valley Girl, Dark Magical Girl, Cute and Psycho

    Level VII: Cool/Special Average 

    Level VIII: Just Average 

    Level IX: Flawed Average 

## Level IX: Flawed Average

These kind of characters would be average, if it wasn't for some kind of minor flaw or uncommon trait that makes them look uglier than average. Similar to "Cool/Special Average", except the flaw that makes them unique has the opposite effect.

    Level X: Uncanny Average 

## Level X: Uncanny Average

These people aren't nessesarily ugly... they just look somehow "unnatural", "creepy" or "weird". There is just something in them that doesn't look right.

**Comparisons:** Uncanny Valley Girl, Yandere, Stepford Smiler

    Level XI: Ugly Cute 

## Level XI: Ugly Cute

For these kinds of characters there is no denial that they are Ugly as they aren't what society considers beautiful. Despite that, looking at them isn't unpleasant. On the contrary, they are considered very cute. Though that cuteness isn't enough to make them Casanovas.

**Comparisons:** Cute Monster Girl, Freaky Is Cool

    Level XII: Normal Ugly 

## Level XII: Normal Ugly

They are by no means horrendous. They are simply slightly unattractive and homely. Sometimes caused by being fat or having poor care on their appearance.

    Level XIII: Ugly and Uncanny 

## Level XIII: Ugly and Uncanny

They are unattractive, yes, but more than that: they are unattractive in a creepy way. Think Governor Tarkin of _Star Wars_ fame. Their traits are not blatantly gonkish, fairly within the limits for a normal human being, but subtly repulsive. More often than not their appearance will match perfectly with their nasty character: for example, a Nazi concentration camp commandant will have a gaunt, skull-like face and glasses that tend to reflect light when it's dramatically appropriate, and an overweight food-hoarding merchant in a famine-struck medieval land will be not fat like an elephant, but his (otherwise completely normal) girth will have a slimy, greasy sheen to it. However, this appearance isn't a sure indicator of evil; a Misunderstood Loner with a Heart of Gold can look like this, too.

    Level XIV: Super Ugly 

## Level XIV: Super Ugly

These characters are very, very ugly. Not enough to be excluded from society, but ugly enough to be unliked and/or bullied by that society. They are often the Butt-Monkey.

    Level XV: Ambiguously Monstrous 

## Level XV: Ambiguously Monstrous

These characters are so ugly that just looking at them may make you sick. They may use a paper bag to hide their faces or something similar out of shame. When people look at them, they either feel pity or fear for them. It's not uncommon for them to be called "monsters", even if they are explicitly human.

    Level XVI: Fearsome and Clearly Inhuman 

## Level XVI: Fearsome and Clearly Inhuman

In no way can this being be confused for a human. They can be obviously undead, a giant ogre-like brute, an alien resembling an Earth invertebrate creature. They are unambiguous monsters. Onlookers, however, suffer no ill effects beyond a fight-or-flight response.

    Level XVII: _Lovecraftian_ 

___

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Dragon Ball Z_:
    -   According to Goku, when he tried to bribe old Kai with a Bulma's picture, he claimed that Bulma was very beautiful, as opposed to Chi-Chi.
    -   In the Cell saga, future Trunks is considered a very handsome man by his mother Bulma.
    -   Goku is described as Common beauty, Some women mention that he is handsome, but he doesn't seem to attract much attention.
-   In _Neon Genesis Evangelion_, there are numerous examples.
    -   Rei Ayanami, by Word of God, was intended as an Imperfect Beauty who fell into the Uncanny Valley. She is described as beautiful, but nonetheless, her lack of emotions put her in the Imperfect beauty. However, in Real Life the perception of her is drastically different.
    -   Misato fits into the same category, being attractive enough to attract several admirers, but having a large scar across her chest.
    -   Asuka is described as a World Class beauty, according to Shinji's friends, who nonetheless dislike her because of her personality.
    -   Shinji himself could probably be classified as "common beauty", given that he's stated to be good-looking in-universe, and shown to have a few fangirls in episode 6, but his looks alone weren't enough for anyone to notice him before he told his classmates he was a mecha pilot. He must get it from his parents, who were both lusted-after by multiple coworkers.
    -   Kaworu was even explicitly referred to as "divine beauty" in some early scripts. Shinji, who had previously shown a lot of interest in boobies and the like, promptly reacts with a blush when he first gazed upon his face.
-   Calling Belldandy, Urd, Peorth, or any of the "Special" residents in Keiichi's home anything other than "Divine beauty", would be Blatant Lies and a very, very, VERY bad idea.
    -   Campus queen Sayoko is only a simple everyday World Class beauty who gets constantly out-glamoured by the goddesses. Poor thing.
-   _Death Note_: Word of God admits Light and L were designed on opposite ends of the scale to better cloud the audience's perception of character morality. Light, who is "very evil", is often acknowledged to be a World Class Beauty, while L, who is "slightly evil", is anywhere between Ugly Cute and Normal Ugly. Alternatively, the Shinigami, who are neither evil nor good, are Clearly Inhuman, and the unseen Shinigami King is Lovecraftian.
-   Ahiru from _Princess Tutu_ is a Cool Average. Despite not being described as the most attractive person, her personality and her happy disposition made Fakir fall in love with her.
    -   Rue / Princess Kraehe is described as a "world class" by her classmates. She is envied for both her beauty and her talent in ballet by a lot of characters.
    -   Mytho (at least from Ahiru's point of view) is described as divine level, due to the fact that Ahiru became completely obsessed with him, even becoming Princess Tutu for him. It wasn't love as revealed in the final episode, because Kraehe was the one who was really in love with him.
-   Sunako from _The Wallflower_ seems to constantly switch between Normal Ugly and World Class beauty. The four guys fit the latter description too.
-   _One Piece_ in-universe examples:
    -   Hancock and Shirahoshi are Divine Level beauties. Nami and Robin, especially Nami, and a few others are World Class beauty. Most other female characters, except the Gonks, are Common Beauty.
    -   Kokoro's mermaid form is Lovecraftian for the main characters. She traumatizes them so much that when they meet Camie, they say she is the first mermaid they've met, which means they are pretending that Mermaid Kokoro never happened.
-   In _The Secret Agreement_, Iori is a World Class beauty, known in the community for not only his family status but his stunning looks, to the point that Kyuusai recognizes him without any introduction after seeing him for the first time. Kyuusai later teases his nephew Yuuichi about their relationship saying "I understand you're the type attracted by looks."
-   _Fate/Zero_ Lancer (aka Diarmuid O'Dyna) is a World Class beauty with an innate magical ability that renders him a divine class beauty to anyone without adequate magic resistance. He's a bit annoyed by this.
-   Chick Magnet Lelouch of _Code Geass_ is a World Class beauty; even Word Of God says that a vast majority of the female populace at his Elaborate University High has a thing for him.
-   Griffith from _Berserk_ was a World Class beauty before the Eclipse and a Divine Level beauty following his reincarnation. His Femto form is a little too creepy to be any level of beautiful though.
    -   Casca, for her part, is a World Class beauty, particularly in her post-Eclipse Ophelia state. Unfortunately for her, her beauty is very much a curse, as there are a lot of humans and demons that want her, whether she wishes it or not.
    -   Guts, meanwhile, may qualify as a World Class/Imperfect Beauty himself, given how much attention he gets from the female members of his new group. In the past, even some guys (Griffith especially) wanted him, and after the Eclipse, he attracts his share of demons as well, and not just because of the Brand on his neck.
    -   Guts and Casca's child in his demonic form is Ugly Cute, being very much grotesque due to his cursed existence but still having infantile attributes like chubby cheeks and puckered lips.
-   Allen Walker from _D.Gray-Man_ is either a World Class beauty or an Imperfect beauty (due to his deformed arm and facial scar). He gets a lot of attention from girls and guys alike.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Sasuke is "world class beauty"; his good looks are mainly commented on by his admirers.
    -   Tsunade and Kushina are possible examples of World Class beauty, as basically everyone who claps eyes on them comments on it.
    -   Gaara and Naruto are described as "Common beauty" or "Special Average".
-   Sousuke Sagara of _Full Metal Panic!_ is Possibly "Word Class beauty", since Even the Guys Want Him.
-   _Haruhi Suzumiya_:
    -   Haruhi Suzumiya herself is described as a World Class beauty by Kyon, who admits that if her personality would improve (which it did) then she would be even more beautiful than Mikuru. Mikuru herself probably at least qualifies for World Class.
    -   Yuki is shown to be at least "Special Average". She's seen as very cute, but almost never speaks. Kyon usually focuses his attention and gushes over the more straightforward/obvious beauties Haruhi and Mikuru, but sometimes throws in a small nod about Yuki here and there. This becomes more pronounced in Disappearance where she gains a Shy Blue-Haired Girl personality and When She Smiles. Each of the girls is is implied to have a small legion of fanboys in the school, offset by some fact that makes them completely unapproachable. Haruhi is accepted to be completely weird in the head, Mikuru is universally idolized and anyone who approaches her would immediately be jumped by her other fans, and Yuki pretty much refuses to acknowledge anybody.
-   _Urusei Yatsura_:
    -   Rei is a Divine Level Beauty, full stop. Women everywhere can't control themselves when they see him for the first time. Though the novelty apparently wears off when they discover he shapeshifts into a bull/tiger-like werebeast, which is treated as Fearsome and Clearly Inhuman.
    -   Characters like Lum, Sakura, Mendou, and Ryuunosuke are all World Class Beauties. Considered so attractive In-Universe, each have their own dedicated fan clubs that swoon the moment they appear. In Sakura's case, part of this appeal stems from the fact that she is a fully-grown woman in a school with budding teenage girls, and the male students always make sure to treat her as such. Ryuunosuke, on the other hand, isn't exactly portrayed as _Divine_, but _does_ have heterosexual female admirers.
    -   Depending on how goofy and lecherous he's seen in the moment, Ataru is either Just Average or Normal Ugly. And Cherry is Ugly and Uncanny enough to invoke mild aversions.
-   In _Hunter × Hunter_, the scarlet/flame-coloured eyes of the Kuruta clan are universally considered so beautiful that they're called one of the seven wonders of the world and are more valuable than diamonds. The Phantom Troupe kills them for this exact reason.
-   Celty from _Durarara!!_ hovers somewhere between World Class beauty and Divine beauty... or rather, she _would_ be if it wasn't for the fact that she's _missing a head_, thus making her an Imperfect beauty.
-   Madlax is an example of World Class beauty, as basically everyone who claps eyes on them comments on it.
-   _Bleach_: Retsu Unohana is World Class beauty. Word of God says she's the most gorgeous woman in all Soul Society. However, characters don't particularly act differently around her.
    -   Byakuya Kuchiki is World Class beauty. He is regularly voted as Soul Society's most beautiful man by the Shinigami Women's Institute's. The only reason he doesn't figure on magazine covers more often is because the Shinigami Women's Institute find it very difficult to get pictures of him. It's practically a war, with the women employing paparazzi-style tactics on one hand and Byakuya retaliating with an army of ninja bodyguards on the other.
    -   Ichigo is Special Average or Common beauty, Riruka mentions how handsome he is, but that's it.
-   _Betrayal Knows My Name_: Luka Crosszeria, aka Zess, possesses a Divine Level beauty. As Shuusei explains in episode 6, "High-level Duras, known as Opasts, take on unbelievably beautiful human forms. They draw humans to them, to deceive them." After which Yuki immediately concludes Luka is an Opast. When he arrives to pick Yuki up from school, all the students stare entranced at him. He's so beautiful even other Opasts want him.
-   _My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU_:
    -   Yukino Yukinoshita is likely a world class beauty. Because she is described as having "unparalleled looks" and according to her the majority of males were infatuated with her, from her looks alone, in the past.
    -   Yui Yuigahama is likely a common beauty, because she and Yukino have similar facial features but no one has commented on her appearance so far.
    -   If the Hikigaya siblings are right, Hachiman Hikigaya is pretty good-looking. He would fall under Imperfect Beauty. Because his "fish eyes" and "gross disposition" counteract his similar neutral facial features, bar his eyes, to Hayato Hayama who is probably at least a common beauty. If they're wrong, Hachiman probably is Flawed Average on the scale.
-   Souma Saiki of _Sakura Gari_ is a World Class Beauty; he can use his looks to get what he wants, has many lovers and had admirers since he was a child, not that it was a good thing. Masataka is a Common Beauty; he is good-looking but only Souma, who's in love with him, comments on his appearance.
-   _Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches_: Going by the characters' reactions and comments to each other, Shiraishi and Miyamura are World Class Beauty, Itou and Odagiri are Common Beauty, and Yamada himself is Just Average. It gets muddled up somewhat thanks to Generic Cuteness and very similar faces, however, so the major clue to how good a character is looking is not his/her actual appearance, but his/her body language - Miyamura, for example, has a more elegant and charming body language than Yamada.
-   In _Interviews with Monster Girls_, Sakie Satou is easily Divine level due to her nature as a succubus and her beauty having a supernatural effect on those around her. This isn't necessarily a good thing for her, since she attempts to tone down her beauty by wearing very baggy clothes and even then is still considered a world-class beauty.
-   Word of God has it that Fullmetal Alchemist's Roy Mustang was supposed to be around Level IV. Attractive, but not especially so. Despite this he's managed to pick up a massive number of fangirls both In-Universe and in Real Life. The former is justified in the manga and 2009 anime, where Mustang has been carefully cultivating his reputation as The Casanova so that nobody takes his behind-the-scenes politicking seriously and as cover for his spy network, to whom he sends coded messages under the guise of flirting with one of his many girlfriends. The 2003 anime, on the other hand, has no such excuse, and Roy's womanizing persona appears to be genuine.
-   _Sailor Moon_:
    -   Rei is a World Class beauty. She gets a modeling gig due to her beauty, and Usagi is so mesmerized by her that she follows her home before truly meeting her. Haruka and Michiru also count in this category. Haruka is attractive enough to have otherwise straight girls fall head over heels for her, and a little bit of flirting is all it takes for a girl taking care of her to become flustered. and Michiru is so beautiful that Usagi mistakes her for a princess, and she and Minako are floored by her beauty.
    -   Minako is a Common beauty. Kaitou Ace describes her as a goddess, and she is known as "The Goddess of Beauty" (though it's usually her calling herself that). Other than that, nobody really comments on her appearance.
    -   Usagi is a Cool/Special Average. In-universe, she's chubby and nothing remarkable in terms of appearance, but her innocence, idealism and cheer endear her to most of the series' protagonists, and some of the antagonists.
    -   Makoto can be considered a Flawed Average, as she is tall and muscular, which people find unattractive in-universe, but has no other notable attributes with regards to her looks.
-   Andrew Hanbridge of _Little Witch Academia (2017)_ is a World Class beauty. Almost _all_ of the students of Luna Nova find him attractive.
-   _Komi Can't Communicate_: Komi is on the line between World-Class and Divine; _everyone_ who encounters her considers her the most beautiful girl they've ever seen, to the point that during the class elections, she ends up getting elected "Class Goddess" because the students feel that "Class Representative" isn't good enough for her, despite the fact that she didn't even volunteer to run in the first place. In her case, it's very much a case of So Beautiful, It's a Curse. Everyone else considers themselves unworthy of interacting with her, but she has no idea that they view as such, and believes that there's something wrong with her. Combined with the fact that she already has an extreme case of social anxiety, the result is that she can barely manage routine social interactions like ordering a drink at a restaurant or talking to a friend on the phone.
-   Discussed to some extent in Genshiken. In-universe, Kousaka is described as a World-Class beauty, while Ohno is merely Common.

    Comic Books 

-   _Sin City_'s women tend to be quite beautiful, ranging from common to World Class beauty. The men, on the other hand, run the gamut from good-looking (Dwight McCarthy) to ugly as sin (Marv).
-   Wonder Woman, in the early years of her comic, was the frequent subject of unwanted (and sometimes violently obsessive) courtship from males of many species, including a giant, sapient amoeba. This would suggest Divine level (although a pair of glasses and businesslike hairdo still rendered her unappealing to the normal human Steve Trevor). The modern version of the character is still considered World class, which is to be expected since she was explicitly given the gift of beauty at birth by the goddess Aphrodite.
-   Power Girl has pretty consistently been treated as "the hot one" by other superheroes, with even the polite one-woman-man Superman commenting that she's exceptional. More recently, this gets played for humor regarding her large (even by superhero standards) breasts.
-   The character Chandra in "Rising Stars" had the power of causing everyone who observed her to see her as the observer's own idea of the perfect woman. She couldn't turn it off, so she was treated as a Divine or World Class beauty, although she was merely above-average under the illusion.
-   Emily Crowe of _Desolation Jones_ is an interesting case. She was a very attractive agent who specialized in "Honey Trap" seduction missions and underwent experimental surgery designed to cause overproduction of sex pheromones. It backfired, and she produces a smell that triggers Arachnid Reaction, making her a type II in terms of looks alone, type IV to the reader and Jones (who's unaffected) and a type XIV to everyone else in-universe.
-   Rorschach of _Watchmen_ is described as "Fascinatingly Ugly", with years of beatings and poor hygiene and a blank expression adding to his Flawed Average looks.
-   Even when Morbius was human, people used to laugh behind his fiance's back for being with someone as ugly as him. Being turned into a living vampire made his appearance even worse: people describe him as looking like "the back-end of a bulldog", and one of Spider-Man's first thoughts when coming face-to-face with him for the first time was "His face—it's hideous!" Morbius himself is shown to be pretty ashamed of his appearance on occasion. Being a brilliant doctor, he has said one of the reasons he wants to find a cure for his condition is because otherwise, no one would ever again see him as anything but a monster.
-   Kate Kane is a Level III, having been described as so beautiful that "pictures never do her justice" and that her beauty is breathtaking. Even as her alter-ego Batwoman, she's had other characters, even unprompted, refer to her as "beautiful," "hot," or otherwise express their attraction.
-   _Li'l Abner_ features both extremes of the scale: the Lovecraftian-level Lena the Hyena induces insanity in those who look upon her, while Stupefyin' Jones is an Intolerably Extreme Beauty, the sight of whom causes any mortal man to be frozen petrified on the spot.
-   Mary Jane Watson is a Level III, having built a successful modeling and acting career based off her good looks. Black Cat matches her in this due to her being a Femme Fatale and The Vamp.

    Films — Animated 

-   _Shrek_ examples:
    -   Shrek is considered Super Ugly in his ogre form, and world Class beauty in his human form.(Considering the enormous level of attention he receives from the 3 girls in the stable and the people of the city.)
    -   Prince Charming is considered World Class beauty or Low Divine..
    -   Princess Fiona is considered World Class beauty in her human form.
-   In the Disney Princess franchise, this is Disney so none of the princesses ever fall below World Class beauty standards, though one or two repeatedly get mentioned as being the most beautiful both within their respective universes and sometimes even in Real Life. This is usually visually represented by having the female lead drawn differently in comparison to other female characters. The best example would be that of Belle and the Bimbettes.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Nanny McPhee starts out as Super Ugly<small>◊</small>, and becomes Common beauty<small>◊</small> at the end.
-   _(500) Days of Summer_, Summer Finn is considered as World Class beauty by Tom Hansen.
-   Princess Leia from _Star Wars_ is Common Beauty: Luke mentions how beautiful she is, but that's it.
    -   Leia's mother, Padmé Amidala, on the other hand, would be considered a World Class Beauty - well, her actress being _Natalie Portman_ is a good enough argument in this case.
    -   Rey and Jyn Erso would be considered Common Beauties. Rose Tico would probably classify as well without her uniform and hairstyle (justified, as she's a mechanic and a case of an Unkempt Beauty). Due to her Femme Fatale status, Qi'ra could be somewhere between Common Beauty and World Class Beauty - not to mention being played by Emilia Clarke might help.
    -   Grand Moff Tarkin is more or less the codifier for Ugly and Uncanny. While not outright hideous by any means, there is something subtly creepy about his Lean and Mean appearance, which is exemplified by his Villainous Cheekbones. Leia comments on his metaphorical stench.
    -   Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine after his deformity are Fearsome And Clearly Inhuman.
-   _Amélie_ is a vague example, the headshots in one of his pictures come alive and argue over whether Amelie is all that attractive. Some will only say that she's Special Average, but another insists that she's World Class beautiful.
-   Marvel Cinematic Universe:
    -   Thor is considered a World Class Beauty. As well as being the Mr. Fanservice of his own films, his hunkiness has reached sufficiently memetic levels in-universe that the normally stoic Melinda May (who has never appeared with him on-screen) calls him "dreamy" in _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._.
    -   In _Captain America: The First Avenger_ pre-serum Steve Rogers is Flawed Average, and post-serum Steve Rogers is a low-level World Class Beauty: he's not as famously hunky as Thor, but he attracts plenty of attention, including causing a Distracted by the Sexy incident for the normally composed Peggy Carter with his post-transformation super-abs. Peggy and Bucky are Common Beauties, and the Red Skull is Ambiguously Monstrous.
    -   Black Widow's portrayal fluctuates between Common and World Class Beauty. _Iron Man 2_ emphasized her Ms. Fanservice aspects, whereas in _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_ she was acknowledged as attractive but nobody made a big deal out of it, and she was able to go undercover without attracting too much attention because of her looks. That said, it is also worth noting that in the former, she was intentionally made-up and emphasising her looks for the mission at hand, and in the latter, she was much more plainly and practically dressed, with minimal make-up (by film character standards, anywhere).
-   _X-Men Film Series_:
    -   Professor Charles Xavier is a Common Beauty in _X-Men: First Class_ and _X-Men: Apocalypse_, his past self in _X-Men: Days of Future Past_ is an Imperfect Beauty, and his elderly self is Just Average. While he generally appears younger than his age (especially in _Apocalypse_), the ravages of time catch up to him in _Logan_, when his health has sharply declined, and he becomes a Flawed Average.
    -   Wade Wilson in _Deadpool (2016)_ starts out as Common Beauty, but is treated as Super Ugly after he gets his scars. (Although some fans consider this a case of Informed Deformity.). Ironically, actor Ryan Reynolds is treated like World Class Beauty by Deadpool, to the point of saying that the only reason he has a successful career is because of how handsome he is.
-   _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_: Jessica Rabbit is a World Class Beauty, bordering on Divine Level Beauty, having been created that way. For someone like her, beauty is more of a problem than an asset.

    Literature 

-   In _The Princess Bride_, the narrator believes beauty to be completely objective. There is a #1 most beautiful, #2 most beautiful, and so forth. The very first sentence is "The year that Buttercup was born, the most beautiful woman in the world was a French scullery maid named Annette." Buttercup starts in the top twenty, but after the removal of a few at the top and a life-changing experience, she becomes #1. So she would be World Class beauty.
-   _Harry Potter_: Severus Snape and Pansy are normal ugly, Hermione is Flawed average or Common beauty when she wants to be, given that Harry describes her as "pretty" during the Yule Ball (though she's implied to get a bit prettier in general after her front teeth are shrunk a bit and like Harry and Ron, grows out of the typical awkward teenage stage), Cho and Ginny are considered (by Harry) World Class beauty, while Luna is Imperfect beauty. Of course, this is all limited by Harry's perceptions; he has a major crush on Cho, he's in love with Ginny, and the Yule Ball is more or less the only time he even notices Hermione's looks. The majority are avoided in the film by the Adaptational Attractiveness.
-   In Alan Dean Foster's _Humanx Commonwealth_ novel _Dirge_, the alien Pitar are described as having somewhere between World Class beauty and Divine Level beauty. Many (but not all) humans are described as being affected by their beauty.
-   Sophie from the _The Infernal Devices_ is an Imperfect beauty example. She used to be beautiful and still is but has a scar stretching across her face.
-   In the world of J. R. R. Tolkien, Arwen Undómiel, her paternal great-great-grandmother Lúthien Tinúviel, paternal great-grandmother Idril Celebrindal, and her maternal grandmother Galadriel count under the Divine beauty category; Lúthien almost literally does, as her mother was the Maia (kind of like a minor goddess) Melian, to whom nightingales would flock when she sang.
    -   All of them are elves, anyway; the whole race could be considered either Divine beauty - since they're immortal - or World Class beauty - since they are certainly not the most perfect or the most beautiful creatures in Arda.
    -   The Valar - particularly Varda, queen of stars - definitely fit under Divine beauty (when, that is, they take humanoid form).
    -   Éowyn, the only human woman given any significant character development in _The Lord of the Rings_, probably counts as a World Class beauty.
-   In the _Sword of Truth_ series, Kahlan, Cara, Merissa, Nicci, Shota, and possibly Jennsen would all be World Class beauties. From what other characters say, it seems like Richard, Darken Rahl, and Drefan Rahl are male examples of World Class beauty.
-   Atreus Eleint, the protagonist of the _Forgotten Realms_ novel _Faces of Deception_ by Troy Denning, clearly has a Monstrous appearance. It's really quite difficult to imagine what he's supposed to look like, to be _that_ ugly. In his case, it's the result of having been changed into a different shape while young and having to grow up without anyone removing the spell; he doesn't look like the other form anymore, but it really messed up his normal growth and shape. Interestingly, not everyone in the book thinks he's ugly, but that's just because he meets some people who don't see anyone as ugly. And even some of _them_ do think he is.
-   _Uglies_. Tally is Flawed Average, the pretties are Divine beauties, the specials are Imperfect beauties.
    -   Interesting example, actually. Tally might be anywhere from Normal Ugly up to at least Common beauty. The thing is that no natural beauty can compete with the pretties, so all non-pretties are considered equally ugly.
-   In _The Neverending Story_, the Childlike Empress is a Divine beauty. The text mentions that she is "indescribably beautiful", and Bastian's first wish while in Fantastica is to be able to keep looking at her forever.
-   In the _Dragonlance_ novels Caramon, Tika, Crysiana, and Kitiara are all Common beauty. Goldmoon is at least a high-end World Class beauty; she was literally worshipped by her barbarian tribe for her beauty. Laurana had multiple characters swear that she was the World's Most Beautiful Woman, all the heroes (even the ultra-cynical Raistlin) are dazzled by her looks upon first seeing her, and when she rode into the city of Kalaman every man, woman, and child in the city was so mesmerized by her beauty that they could only stare at her in silent awe. Making an entire city go weak in the knees at the sight of her should qualify Laurana as a Divine beauty.
-   In The Bible, Queen Esther, Joseph, Saul, and Abigail are described as "World Class beauty".
    -   For perspective, Esther won a beauty contest of all the women in the vast Persian Empire. Joseph, in Islamic legend, literally has half of the beauty that God gave to mankind.
    -   Isaiah 53 says God's servant had "...no form or beauty, that we should look at him: no charm, that we should find him pleasing." Christians interpret this to be Jesus.
-   In _The Kingkiller Chronicle_ series, the fey creature Felurian is in the Divine beauty category, basically being a sex goddess with whom men fall instantly in love and presumably die either from exhaustion or separation. Then there's Denna, who from Kvothe's point of view is a World Class beauty. However, there are some subtle hints from other characters that Denna is merely Common or Imperfect beauty, implying that Kvothe's impressions are skewed by his love for her. But because she is constantly with other male suitors and essentially lives off her looks, she probably is rather beautiful. Most other women in the series fall into the Common beauty category.
-   In _Twilight_, the Cullens are Divine beauty. Bella is just average (or maybe Common beauty; the people around her seem to think the latter), until she becomes a vampire. Every human has a beauty upgrade if they become a vampire; some, like James, were probably so ugly in life that even as a vampire they don't reach Divine beauty.
-   Dorian Gray is absolutely divine for everyone. Everyone stares at him in breathless wonder, does everything to please him and gets ruined because of him.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_: Most of the characters are firmly places on attractiveness ladder. Expect the individuals from the opposite ends of it to be paired with each other often.
    -   The Maiden of the Faith of the Seven is a Divine beauty, being the religious embodiment of Beauty Equals Goodness and Virgin Power. The Targaryens, an Inhumanly Beautiful Race, could count as this too; though their beauty might get points for being "exotic" to both Essosi and Westerosi.
    -   Cersei and Jaime are World-Class Beauties (although by the fourth book, Cercei's looks are starting to go...). Several noble ladies are World-Class beauties, most notably Sansa Stark and Margaery Tyrell. Robert Baratheon (and Renly, who resembles him) in his prime was also one. Sansa's mother Catelyn, after whom the former takes, is probably between World Class and Common; Sansa is said to be prettier than her and Catelyn, while beautiful wasn't renowned for her beauty like Cersei or Sansa are.
    -   Lyanna Stark (and by extension Arya, who strongly resembles her) are either "Cool" or "Common" beauties. POVs note Lyanna was beautiful, but unconventionally, and she was far outshined by Cersei-in-her-prime. Arya becomes this when she cleans up nicely.
    -   Eddard Stark (and everyone else with the Stark look) and Stannis Baratheon are considered average.
    -   Melisandre is Good-looking but Uncanny - she is noted as beautiful, but something is off about her.
    -   Brienne is described in a way that would make her Normal Ugly, maybe with a shade of Ugly Cute (given she has pretty eyes), but she looks mannish and acts on it, which is considered extra-repulsive in the society she lives in, so she is considered Super Ugly. Having a part of her face chewed off later by Biter doesn't help her case, moving her to Ugly and Uncanny.
    -   Ramsay Bolton is Ugly and Uncanny, with blotchy skin, dry hair, meaty lips, pallid skin and most prominently, ghost-grey eyes described as being all but colourless, like "two chips of dirty ice". His father Roose, is Uncanny Average. While never described as particularly _un_attractive, Roose's leeching habits (which left him with milk-white skin) and the Bolton family's prominent pale eyes make him look somewhat off, more like a vampire than a normal human. While never mentioned to have them, he is often drawn with raven black locks just to exemplify his Dracula-esque appearance.
    -   Beric Dondarrion, albeit an unkempt beauty before his many deaths, eventually downgrades to Ugly and Uncanny after multiple brutal deaths permanently destroyed a piece of his appearance and mind.
    -   Tyrion, a hideously deformed dwarf, is Ugly and Uncanny, and becomes Ambiguously Monstrous once he gets his nose cut off. Sandor Clegane, who is also Ugly and Uncanny, has burns covering the entire half of his face (and the other half isn't that much of a looker, either).
-   _The Windrose Chronicles_:
    -   Joanna is Just Average on account of being an Unfazed Everyman. She's described as fit and solid despite being less than five foot tall and with dark eyebrows and 'too-curly' hair. Her friends tell her she would be pretty if she made an effort, but she's too nerdy and timid to bother.
    -   Caris is World Class. Joanna describes him as looking like a TV ad, with a 'Nordic beauty' look about hin.
    -   Antryg is Ugly Cute, with a thin and gawky build, a peculiar face where every feature looks too big for the bone structure, a huge beaky nose, a scary Cheshire Cat Grin, a mop of messy and greying curly hair and a dress sense that consists of oversized clothing and lots of cheap sparkly jewellery. But he also has likeable, kind eyes, a graceful demeanor, large but gentle hands and a deep voice 'as beautiful and flamboyant as an embroidered brocade'. Joanna and Caris find him strangely fascinating to look at, and he gets picked up by a woman for casual sex within minutes of dimension-travelling into Los Angeles despite repeatedly telling her he was a mad wizard from another world. (He's a Comic-Book Fantasy Casting Tom Baker, what do you expect?)
-   _Dragon Bones_ has Ward, who is implied to be average, his brother Tosten, who is a Common Beauty and has to be careful in the proximity of male sailors, sister Ciarra, a normal pretty girl, the Queen Tehedra (Common Beauty, with the "flaw" that she's over thirty), Bastilla (Common Beauty), Garranon, a man who is thirty but looks younger, a favourite of the king and the ladies at court, a (World Class Beauty). And then there's Tisala, who has a face that would be average for a man, but some consider her ugly. Ward sees her as Ugly Cute, he acknowledges that she's no beauty, but is fascinated with her anyway.
-   Polly Hampton in _Love in a Cold Climate_ is a World Class Beauty.
    
    "Polly Hampton had beauty, and this beauty was her outstanding characteristic."
    
-   _Doctrine of Labyrinths_:
    -   Felix Harrowgate is a World Class Beauty, only amplified by his talents as The Charmer.
    -   Mehitabel is Cool Average: not conventionally pretty, but still attractive enough to be a Heroic Seductress when required.
    -   Mildmay is an Imperfect Beauty, emphasis on Imperfect: he has Face of a Thug issues due to a large, disfiguring facial scar, and tends to be quite self-deprecating about his appearance, but several characters find him attractive anyway.
-   _Black Jewels_:
    -   Daemon Sadi is a high-level World Class Beauty, generally recognized (by men as well as women) as the sexiest man in the Realms.
    -   Plain Jane Cassidy is Flawed Average, which causes problems with people who expect Queens to be The Beautiful Elite.
    -   Jaenelle Angelline is Good-Looking But Uncanny. Being unprecedentedly powerful (by in-universe standards) as well as, on a metaphysical level, not entirely human, she often gives the impression of being a bit off.
-   Ayla from the _Earth's Children_ series falls into the category of World Class Beauty, but borders on Divine Level Beauty. However, because she was raised by Neanderthals (who have a very different idea of beauty than modern humans) she tends to see herself as being somewhere between Ugly Cute and Super Ugly.
-   In _Asimov Laughs Again_ (1992), Isaac Asimov recounts having coined, along with a friend, a humorous unit for measuring beauty, the "millihelen", measured as the amount of beauty required to launch a single ship, based on the beauty of Helen of Troy having launched a thousand ships (although it is not certain whether he was the first to come up with this idea). Theoretically, each point on this sliding scale could correspond to a measurement in (milli)helen, with levels of beauty ranging from Just Average at 0 helen to Divine Level Beauty at 1 helen (1000 millihelen), since Helen of Troy was considered Divine Level, and levels of ugliness being measured with a corresponding negative number (-1 millihelen being the amount of ugliness required to repel a single ship).
-   Many of Agatha Christie's works play with the Beauty Is Bad trope; whenever a story features a handsome man of Common Beauty or higher, the odds are that he will turn out to be a villain or at least immoral; a heroine who has fallen for him may end up paired with his foil, a man of much better character who may be around Just Average in appearance. This may be a case of Writer on Board, considering Christie's two husbands. Diana Ashley from "The Idol House of Astarte" borders on World Class Beauty while Richard Carey from _Murder in Mesopotamia_ comes under Good-looking but Uncanny; in both cases, their striking appearance contributes indirectly to the murder that follows.
-   Sundari from _Midnight's Children_ by Salman Rushdie is initially of Intolerably Extreme Beauty. Her mother and the women helping with the birth become fully blind at the sight of her as soon as she is born, her father suffers vision impairment just from a fleeting glimpse, and for a time she has to cover her face. A cruel great-aunt slashes her face with a knife and she is reduced to becoming a beggar; she becomes very successful at this because "nobody who looked at her could fail to pity a girl who had clearly once been too beautiful to look at and was now so cruelly disfigured."
-   In Richard Kennedy's "The Dark Princess", the titular character gradually progresses from Divine Level Beauty to Intolerably Extreme Beauty by the time she grows to young womanhood, causing all who look at her to go blind (and she is also blind herself). The King discovers, however, that she can be looked at safely through a piece of colored glass.
-   Queen Swanwhite of _The Chronicles of Narnia_ is easily Divine Level, with Jewel the Unicorn describing her as so beautiful that any pool reflecting her face would retain the image for a year and a day.
-   _The Goblin Emperor_:
    -   Hesero Nelaran is on the top end of Special Average: visibly middle-aged and "not beautiful," but poised and stylish enough to still impress Maia with her glamour.
    -   Former Empress Csoru is a high-level Common Beauty - on a strictly physical level, she's gorgeous, but her looks weren't enough for her to parley her position as Empress Consort into real political influence while her husband was alive, or to distract people from her unpleasant personality in the present.
    -   Eshevis Tethimar is another "textually very handsome but not enough to overshadow his massive personality flaws" Common Beauty.
    -   Nedao Vechin is a World Class Beauty, with a beautiful voice, refined manners, and elegant dress sense to complement her impressive-in-themselves good looks.
    -   Csevet Aisava is Special Average, not noted to be handsome but repeatedly described as graceful and elegant, as well as possessing a beautiful smile.
    -   Thara Celehar is Flawed Average, being unhealthily thin and exhausted-looking, with a harsh and gravelly voice.
    -   Cala and Csethiro are Average.
-   Arvenean Shelsin from _The Cemeteries of Amalo_ is a World Class Beauty, attractive enough to collect a steady stream of wealthy admirers and patrons despite her demanding, self-centered personality and blatant Gold Digger tendencies. Her beautiful voice and the glamor of being an opera star probably also helped.
-   Zoya and Genya from _The Grishaverse_ are World Class Beauties (until Genya becomes an Imperfect Beauty in the second book). The Darkling also fits in that category, even after getting lightly scarred by a volcra attack.
    -   David is often described as Just Average, which leads a lot of people to question why World Class Beauty Genya is into him.
    -   It's debatable whether Nikolai is a World Class Beauty or a Common Beauty, because a fair amount might boil down to sheer charisma.
    -   Mal gets a lot of female attention (notably from World Class Beauty Zoya), but he's probably in the Common Beauty category.
    -   Alina constantly describes herself as plain and mousy, placing her in Special Average at the very least at the beginning of the story.
    -   Nina is a Common Beauty, of the Big Beautiful Woman variety. Matthias is the Sexy Scandinavian while Wylan is the Pretty Boy.
-   An interesting case in _The Last Unicorn_, where Lady Amalthea starts off as a high-end Divine Beauty (to the point where she makes anything she touches or wears seem beautiful too) and slowly fades to a mere World Class Beauty. This is because she is a unicorn turned mortal, and as her humanity becomes more evident, her beauty becomes more ordinary.

" In _One Hundred Years of Solitude_, while most characters oscillate between just average and imperfect beauty at most, there is Remedios the Beauty, who _begins_ as World Class Beauty and gradually becomes a Divine one, and the only reason why she hasn't fully stepped into Intolerable Beauty is because her family is actively trying to tone her down. Also, she's mentally about five years old, is totally unaware of her own attractiveness, and when informed that people have_actually died_ because of being distracted by her beauty she immediately qualified the deceased as being the dumb ones.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Brady Bunch_: The Season 5 episode "Peter and the Wolf" has Greg needing to find someone to go on a double date with his girlfriend, Sandra, and her cousin, Linda. When Greg admits that Sandra hadn't seen Linda in years nor had seen a recent photo of her, when he is asked to try to tell what Linda looks like, all he has is Sandra's pre-pubescent description of her ("pigtails and braces"). Naturally, all of his shallow buddies run for the exits, assuming Linda is super ug-lee!!!! Rather than admit defeat and wait until Linda goes home, Greg eventually turns to Peter to salvage the date... and it is Peter's faux alter ego Peter Packer who gets to date who turns out to be a super-hot Linda.
-   _Community_: Annie Edison is considered a World Class Beauty, although initially she seemed to be an example of Hollywood Homely, As the series progresses, many characters notice how beautiful she really is, to the point of being distracted by her appearance.
-   _The Cosby Show_: The Season 4 episode "Theogate" – where Theo is kicked off the track team for an incident and tries to conceal this from his parents – played with this through an unseen waitress at a fast food restaurant. This part of the plot featured Theo and a fellow track teammate being waited on by a severely obese and certainly ugly waitress, and the two – perhaps upset that an attractive waitress wasn't waiting on them (even though nothing is ever said as much) – make cruel jokes about her to the point where she runs off in tears. (Of course, Clair is able to get the truth out of Theo and tells him to apologize to the waitress.)
-   _Sanford and Son_: While no means an all-American beauty, Aunt Esther's physical appearance is constantly the butt of Fred's cruel jokes. Example: "Was your mother a gorilla? Because you got the face of one!"
-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_ plays with this in one episode where a woman undergoes plastic surgery to become beautiful because she falls into the Most Horrible Ever category (there's a village made just for ugly people so nobody would be forced to look at them). Of course being _The Twilight Zone_ there's a twist: she turns out to be what many viewers would consider at least somewhat pretty, as she is played by Donna Douglas. It's just that everyone in their world is hideous with pig noses and their beauty standards are built around that.
-   In _Zoey 101_, James is considered "World Class beauty" while Logan is considered **Common beauty** or "Special average".
    
    **Lola:** Oh! Yeah, we're here to meet a guy named Logan...our age. Sorta...good looking.  
    **Michael:** Sorta.
    
    -   Lola is "World Class Beauty", since many people mention how beautiful she is, Zoey is also considered "World Class" although to a lesser extent than Lola.
-   Most Disney Channel Live-Action Universe protagonists are considered (In-Universe) Common beauty. That is to say that they are considered handsome or beautiful, but not enough to stand out, or belong to any popular group.
-   Princess Mithian on _Merlin_ arrives in Camelot in a Big Entrance that creates some suspense over her appearance by having her wear a veil over her face. When she draws it back the Reaction Shot of the assembled crowd puts her on a World Class beauty level. Whether this is a Justified Trope or Narm depends on your opinion of the actress in question, and how much The Reveal deserves the dramatic build-up.
-   Ginger on _Gilligan's Island_ was considered World Class beauty while Mary Ann was considered Special Average.
-   _New Girl_, Jess is considered Common Beauty, while Cece is considered World Class beauty. Both considered beautiful, but Cece usually attracts more attention due to being a model.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   According to Steven Moffat, the Doctor is a kind of Special Ugly Cute ("utterly compelling, attractive in a very odd way... None of the Doctors are conventionally attractive, but they’re all arresting") and should only ever be played by actors of that type, as "handsome men don't quite suit". In-series, this also seems to be the rule - they're generally considered to be a funny-looking bunch at best, usually losing extra points with their awful fashion sense as well, but make up for it with bags of charm/presence/charisma to the point that most people find them enjoyable to look at anyway. The exceptions are the Eighth and the Tenth - the Tenth is regarded as a Common Beauty, while the Eighth is on the bottom end of World Class (being very good looking to begin with, but also possessing a lot of slightly inhuman traits that make him strangely more attractive, such as naturally smelling of honey).
    -   Companions are generally Common Beauties - making them too hot makes them unrelatable, but they are also there to provide Parent Service and have UST with guest characters. A few exceptions:
        -   Steven Taylor is explained to be a World Class Beauty in the Expanded Universe (although the actor who played Steven claimed that he was not written as attractive in the show, and only figured out that he was Mr. Fanservice after he left and people kept saying they fancied him). His most extreme moment of Character Shilling is probably when Jane Austen says he's so handsome that he could steal the heart of every woman in London.
        -   Romana - any Romana - is the top end of World Class, with the expanded universe going into detail about her unearthly charisma, which she has even if the person observing her doesn't find her sexually attractive.
        -   Jack is World Class, and how.
        -   Amy is a World Class Beauty. Two of her jobs involve making money off her looks (a "kissogram" and a model) and Clara is extremely intimidated when she sees a photo of her legs. (Of course, Amy's being a model is also an Actor Allusion, as Karen Gillan is a former model.)
        -   Rory is Special Average - Amy describes his looks as 'just alright' and her friends call him 'the ugly one'. However, his loving personality makes Amy consider him 'the most beautiful man in the world', and both the Doctor and the TARDIS claim to fancy him. The TARDIS even calls _him_ the "pretty one" (confusing the Doctor who was expecting it to mean Amy).
-   _Game of Thrones_ is a bit of a tricky case, because despite the large amounts of Fanservice, and despite this being a universe where looks are quite important, not many characters' looks are referred to in-universe, probably because the actors' looks speak for themselves. Here are some attempts:
    -   Sansa Stark and Daenerys Targaryen are definitely World Class Beauties at least. They're probably the two characters whose level of attractiveness becomes a plot point the most often. Their great looks are remarked upon by several characters, and several important characters fall in love with/lust after them. Walder Frey accuses Talisa Maegyr of having been preferred over his daughters solely for being a World Class Beauty as well.
    -   Amongst men Jaime Lannister is a World Class Beauty. In the first episode Ros tells Tyrion that Jaime is said to be the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms, and in season 6 Bronn implies all women look at him as if they'd like to -ahem- have sexual relations with him. Loras Tyrell is also probably this. He has managed to achieve a special nickname, "The Knight of Flowers", that refers to his good looks and flair, and Word of God proclaimed him the "Sexiest Man of Westeros".
    -   Jon Snow is referred to as being uncommonly "pretty" several times, but it's not clear if this means he's supposed to be World Class Beauty or just a Common Beauty in a setting that's unusual (especially since in at least one of those occasions the adjective is used to deride him for his supposed lack of toughness).
    -   Brienne of Tarth gets a lot of sneering for being "big" and dressing like a man, but Jaime is the only one who outright calls her ugly, and that's only when he's trying to get on her nerves. So she's considered Flawed Average in her society for being a big, muscular woman who fights. Despite the general negativity, however, there are a few who admire her for being such a capable fighter, so she could probably also be considered Cool/Special Average depending on your point of view. Especially now that it seems she's World Class Beauty in Tormund's eyes.
    -   As part of his Adaptational Attractiveness and his burns being less prominent, the Hound is upgraded to Flawed Average from his Ugly and Uncanny book counterpart.
    -   Tyrion Lannister is Flawed Average in this adaptation, or Imperfect Beauty according to Margaery Tyrell. Nobody on the show points out any flaw in his looks other than his dwarfism (which, however, _is_ considered a huge deformity in this world). Margaery, on the other hand, notes that once you get over it he's actually quite handsome.
    -   While Gregor Clegane before his deformity was more or less average after his wounding he became Fearsome and Clearly Inhuman.
-   _How I Met Your Mother_ has Robin Scherbatsky, who claims that she doesn't have to pay for bagels, newspapers, or rent in Manhattan because she's so beautiful, and whom Lily hated when they first met, but now seems to have a bit of a crush on. This would probably classify her as a World Class Beauty.
-   _King the Land_. Both protagonists. Goo Won and Sa-rang are treated as world-class beauties, with people mentioning how attractive they are, in Sa-rang's case, a prince fell in love with her just by seeing her.
-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power_: Sauron is described as a Morgoth's beautiful servant by Waldreg, but when he actually appears on screen, Sauron is merely a Common Beauty. Justified, as he took a human form in order to stay hidden. He is still quite handsome, having the charms of a Loveable Rogue with an Aragorn appeal to him, but without being otherworldly.

    Music 

-   Singer Brandy grew up in a school in Los Angeles where many casting agents would turn when they needed child actors. One time, when a call came for a "Drop dead gorgeous, Vanessa Williams-type", the woman in charge of setting up auditions (something like the school's guidance counselor) didn't send her. When Brandy asked her about this, the woman told Brandy, "You're cute, but you're not Vanessa Williams drop-dead gorgeous." A couple of people have said that that was the spark that fueled Brandy to become successful in the first place.
-   The title character of Dolly Parton's song "Jolene" is described in a manner that implies World Class Beauty level:
    
    Your beauty is beyond compare, with flaming locks of auburn hair, with ivory skin and eyes of emerald green.
    
    Your smile is like a breath of spring, your voice is soft like summer rain, and I cannot compete with you, Jolene.
    
-   Eminem frequently remarked at the beginning of his career that he wasn't comfortable being seen as a sex symbol, because nobody found him good-looking until he got famous, and if not for that nobody would look twice at him. (He did, in fact, not look good until his record company got him to shave, lose weight, build muscle, swap his glasses for contacts, dye his hair, get a skincare routine, and dress better.) After realising that his newly Pretty Boy looks led to him being seen more as a Teen Idol for the _TRL_ set than as a serious rapper, he eventually incorporated this into his persona, bragging in his songs that his cute, white appearance lets him hug swooning girls and sneak Black culture into their CD collections.
-   TWICE. In music videos, Tzuyu usually varies between being considered World-class and Divine level, to the point that she usually fills the role of Angelic Beauty.

    Mythology and Religion 

-   Aphrodite/Venus from Classical Mythology definitely fits the Divine Level description.
    -   Apollo also goes under the Divine Level beauty.
    -   Hephaestus/Vulcan goes somewhere near Super Ugly.
    -   Most monsters such as Medusa were considered Lovecraftian.
    -   Helen of Troy also had Divine Level beauty despite being a mortal (though this may be explained by Zeus possibly being her father). Her beauty started the famous Trojan War.
    -   The mortal Psyche's Divine Level beauty led to her being worshiped as a goddess and making the god of love himself fall for her.
-   It is implied that many gods of the Greek pantheon may be of Intolerably Extreme beauty, to the extent that they do not appear to mortals in their true form, but take on A Form You Are Comfortable With.
-   Many Biblical angels were described as horrific creatures including Seraphs, angels who had to cover themselves with their wings or else anything that looked at them - including lesser angels - would burn. But there were also many beautiful angelic figures in the bible, so the angels filled both extremes of the Sliding Scale.

    Oral Tradition 

-   "Adalmina's Pearl": Adalmina is a princess who gets as her birth gift an enchanted pearl that makes her more beautiful every day. The plot also makes her a plain peasant girl at one point - depending on version, Flawed Average or Normal Ugly. Adalmina is a character who depending on how pretty she was as an infant, could very possibly be five grades of beauty and one grade of ugly, while averting Hollywood Homely and Beautiful All Along. It's actually scary to think that no matter what, she will be much more beautiful as a granny than as a young princess.

    Tabletop Games 

-   The Appearance Attribute in the _Old World of Darkness_ measures looks which, normally, goes from one to five i.e 'Normal Ugly' to 'World Class Beauty'. Anything beyond five is 'Divine Level Beauty' and it means your character is a walking Masquerade breach.
    -   The Sidhe from _Changeling: The Dreaming_ gets two free dots in Appearance which places most of them in 'Divine Level Beauty'.
    -   The Nosferatu from _Vampire: The Masquerade_ is a vampire Clan cursed with the supernatural ugliness that goes way below average. Most of them fall under ''Fearsome and Clearly Inhuman' while the "prettiest" of them are no better than 'Ambiguously Monstruous'.
-   The _New World of Darkness_ has a Merit called Striking Looks which measures your character's appearance and gives her a nice bonus on Social rolls. Not having it means your character is anywhere between 'Just Average' to 'Normal Ugly'. The Merit itself has two versions (two-dot and _four_\-dot) which fall somewhere between 'Special Average' and 'World Class Beauty'. Having or lacking Social Attributes/Skils can improve or decrease her appeal by one or two levels. 'Divine Level Beauty' can be achieved through supernatural means.
    -   The Daeva and the Fairest<sup>*&nbsp;</sup> are two groups of supernatural beings that are known for their above average beauty and for having the powers to back it up.
    -   The _Requiem_ version of the Nosferatu can be anything between Ugly and Uncanny down to Fearsome and Clearly Inhuman since their curse is not specifically in a physical sense, but in a more Uncanny Valley\-esque sense.
-   _Exalted_ also has an Appearance stat, with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6+ being Super Ugly, Normal Ugly, Just Average, Cool/Special Average, Common beauty, World Class, and Divine respectively.
-   _GURPS_ literally has such a sliding scale — every character, every creature can have an above- or below-average appearance as an advantage or disadvantage (the scale goes Transcendent, Very Beautiful, Beautiful, Attractive, Average, Unattractive, Ugly, Hideous, Monstrous, Horrific).
    -   GURPS writers have suggested that, once you move beyond Transcendent, Mind Control or Terror are the next steps.
-   Nymphs in _Dungeons & Dragons_ must be Intolerably Extreme Beauty — they're so beautiful it acts as a Brown Note, at least if they will it. In 2nd Edition, it could not be turned off. See a nymph, you go blind. See one naked, and you die. Talk about So Beautiful, It's a Curse.
-   The first edition of _Unearthed Arcana_ added an optional "comeliness" stat for characters. It could range from -16 or below (equivalent to Level XVI) to +25 to 30 (equivalent to Level II). The rule was unpopular as it allowed anyone with a high stat to effectively temporarily charm anyone without a sufficient wisdom stat to resist. Playing as written, if a group of adventurers who'd not previously met decided to meet up and enter a dungeon, the first meeting would include some of them being charmed by other members of the group!
-   In Warhammer 40,000 the Emperor of Mankind and his Primarch sons generally occupy the very top levels of this scale. They are all said to possess more or less supernatural levels of attractiveness and charisma.
    -   The two most prominent examples would Sanguinius and Fulgrim who are both S-tier Divine level beauties, though in subtly different ways; Sanguinius could best be described as possessing _true_ Angelic Beauty, while Fulgrim is more the sort of slightly _too_ perfect beauty you'd get if a mad scientist spliced together genes from all the most beautiful people throughout time to create the perfect White Hair, Black Heart character.
    -   And more towards the other end of the scale, you've got Vulkan and Magnus the Red who while awesome-looking are also uncannily inhuman – mostly due to being Amazing Technicolor Population.
    -   Slaanesh, one of the Chaos Gods, is described to be so beautiful that you lose all free will and other desires to him. This puts him technically on Divine level (it helps that he's an actual deity). Depictions of him tends to lead towards Good-looking but Uncanny, as his followers are generally supposed to be the absolute apex of perfection, yet always have something subtly wrong about them.
    -   Tzeentch firmly occupies the Lovecraftian level. While Nurgle and Khorne look respectively conventionally disgusting and badass, Tzeentch's form is said to be incomprehensible. The most _conventional_ way of describing him would be a screaming, yawning vortex of pure energy and malice (and that's only when he doesn't want to break your mind).
    -   Eldar are described as World-Class beauties physically, but when they move they are so graceful and swift that it looks unnatural, dipping straight into Uncanny Valley to humans. This, combined with the fact that they frequently manipulate humans into doing their bidding, has caused the Imperial Guard to issue warnings against communicating with them.
-   _Nobilis_: Ananda, Lord of Murder, the Infinite, and the Fourth Age takes the Intolerably Extreme Beauty level up a notch. Even a picture of him induces physical and/or psychological damage in those who see it. In the flesh, his incredible beauty causes madness or death to any creature within a certain radius of him, _even if they can't actually see him_.

    Video Games 

-   _Metal Gear_:
    -   Raiden in _Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty_ is described as being "easy on the eyes" but his white hair coloring and androgyny supposedly makes him seem a little bit weird and creepy. This creepiness is somewhat more apparent in the Japanese voice performances, where Raiden was deliberately cast with an actor much older than Raiden's mid-20s appearance to give him an eerie, ageless feel.
    -   In _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_, the BB Corps are physically on the top end of World Class, but in practice are terrifying Imperfect beauties due to their animalistic robot suits and unstable personalities. Snake is implied to be an ex-bottom-end-of World Class who is now Ugly as a result of his age, its effect on his appearance likened by Drebin to the effect of the BB Corps's suits.
    -   Big Boss is specifically noted to be so charismatic and attractive he is able to demand undying loyalty even from his enemies with it. His men are repeatedly shown to beg for more when he beats them up.
-   Based on the amount of attention she gets (mainly from very minor characters), Aerie from _Baldur's Gate II_ might just qualify for World Class beauty. By the same logic, at least Jaheira and perhaps other female party members as well as qualify for Common beauty.
-   The Player Character from _A Dance with Rogues_ (a _Neverwinter Nights_ custom module) is definitely World Class beauty, even if it's not intended quite that way. _Everybody_ drools after her. (Well, the module _was_ written by a female who thought there wasn't enough flirting in the official plot and who apparently had some rather racy fantasies.) Even though the module allows a custom (female) character, there is a minimum requirement of 14 charisma for her to account for this. One gets the feeling it should be 16. (For the uninitiated: 18 is the normal maximum.)
-   In _Stretch Panic_, 12 young women were all incredibly vain, meaning they would likely be in the upper levels of beauty. The Demons of Vanity transformed them all into twisted Ugly and Uncanny versions of their perfect images of beauty. Special mention goes to Jelly Chan, who turned into a Level XVI giant blob monster and Demonica, a horror fan who became so hideous that looking at her would kill you, putting her on Lovecraftian level.
-   _Dragon Age: Origins_: Everyone seems to think the Warden is a World Class beauty. It is possible to deliberately make them hideous during character creation.
-   _Katawa Shoujo_ goes Freaky Is Cool Ugly Cute with Hanako, a beautiful girl apart from her extensive physical scarring, who has to overcome her shame for it. Lilly is a World Class beauty, ironically despite the fact that she is blind.
-   _Final Fantasy VII_:
    -   Tifa is a World Class Beauty, semi-famous in her city for her good looks, able to get 'interviewed' in a brothel for the position of a wife for a powerful crime boss, and so gorgeous one of her worst enemies won't attempt to hurt her in boss battles.
    -   Aeris/Aerith is a Common Beauty, although one canny enough to overcharge admirers she dislikes for the flowers she sells. In the original, she's described as being 'pretty' and is second-choice to be 'interviewed' by the Don, behind Tifa. In _Final Fantasy VII Remake_, she's noted by several NPCs to be just OK-looking, which makes her annoyed, although she can later comment that she thinks people like her everyday, down-to-earth charm. Averted if you get the best dress for her in the Wall Market sequence. Johnny has to physically keep people back (those who aren't standing there taking pictures), and Cloud can't _speak_ for a bit after he sees her in that red ballgown.
    -   Cloud:
        -   In the original _Final Fantasy VII_, Cloud as himself is a Flawed Beauty - he's convincingly good-looking enough to pass as a former SOLDIER 1st Class and more than a few women (and Mukki) in game are immediately attracted to his looks (Johnny describes him as being a 'playboy'). On the other hand, he's also seen as overly intimidating and with Creepy Blue Eyes that are not well-liked (though Aeris likes them and one NPC finds them sexy). Several other characters (including Cid) describe him as being unpleasantly odd in demeanor, likely the effect of his winning personality. Cloud in a dress is Uncanny Average, described euphemistically as being 'healthy-looking', and said to be 'not bad' if you don't look closely. 'She' is the Don's least favorite, and even if you dress 'her' well enough to make the Don pick 'her', he still finds her a bit suspicious...
        -   In _Final Fantasy VII Remake_, Cloud's upgraded to a World Class beauty. His looks catch the eye of two of Wall Market's entertainment moguls as star potential - both Madam M, and the extremely discerning Andrea. After a couple of rounds at the Colosseum he attracts a group of screaming fangirls, multiple characters comment on his perfect bone structure, in Sector 7 his appearance inspires a bunch of new fashion trends for both women and men, and in Sector 5 rumours fly around town about the 'hot mercenary'. When in a dress, he is apparently an awesomely attractive woman as well, with young men breaking up with their girlfriends over her after seeing her in the street, and even the sexless Chadley falling head over heels for her on sight. The Don notices 'she's' muscular and has a very deep voice, but apparently quite likes the idea of a buff trans woman in Visual Kei fashion calling him a disgusting pervert and cussing him out.
    -   Yuffie describes herself as being super-hot and a babe, but outside her head, she's merely Average. She's described as being a skinny brat, and even the Don appears to like her more for her personality, finding her looks unremarkable.
-   Miranda Lawson from _Mass Effect_ is a World Class Beauty since she was made to be genetically perfect (and being modeled on Yvonne Strahovski probably helps).
-   _God of War_: Kratos is Flawed Handsome. He has a very fearsome and intimidating appearance due to his ash-like skin and perpetually frowning face, yet he manages to be The Pornomancer effortlessly, getting on bed with several women possibly because of his masculine and well-built physique.
-   _Disco Elysium_:
    -   Harry is a _very_ mangled Imperfect Beauty. In his youth, before he became the 'broken' part of his Broken Ace status, he was an exceptionally handsome World Class Beauty, and he still retains some of the best parts of his looks, particularly his Lantern Jaw of Justice and strong muscles. Unfortunately he's wrecked his body so much with his alcoholism, smoking, amphetamine and psychedelic abuse, suicidal depression and insomnia that he's ruined his skin, he's developed a beer gut and a sagging bum, he stinks, he has greasy muttonchops, he dresses in a bunch of hideous items mixed together at random, and his face is permanently fixed into a repulsive disco smirk that does not meet his eyes. You can have him remove the Expression and the muttonchops - he finds the first one an unambiguous relief, but his partner Kim thinks the facial hair was better because it 'covered up more of the damage'.
    -   Kim's Special Average - his overall appearance is that of an unexceptional binoclard, though it's noted that his features naturally look young for his age. However, he also hand-tailors his own wardrobe to fit him perfectly, and cultivates his mannerisms to project an air of elegant, aloof cool that leaves Harry struggling for words.
    -   Klaasje is a World Class Beauty. She was a former beauty queen representing her own country, and, when Ruby's love of classic female movie pinups is brought up as evidence that Klaasje (who looks like that kind of woman) is her type, Ruby responds that Klaasje is everyone's type. Klaasje is so beautiful that she's able to overpower Harry's brain, leaving the voices in his head unable to suss out her lies; her appearance also drives Dros insane with lust and disgust\]\]. Even Kim, who isn't interested in women and is therefore insulated from the worst of Klaasje's powers, is beguiled by her somewhat. Interestingly, the one character who is immune to her seems to be Garte; he claims she's not to his taste and is disgusted by the mere implication she is (which Volition confirms to be true).
-   _Star Control_:
    -   The VUX in general are deemed by humans in general to be of the Fearsome and Clearly Inhuman type, and external official sources state that other alien races have similar views on their appearance. The VUX themselves not only actively discriminate by appearance, but in particular view humans in general in the same way humans view the VUX in-universe, if not Lovecraftian given how some VUX speaking to you actively try to avoid looking at you directly and clearly lest they vomit from the sight. Given how their standards on beauty are much different from ours, the scale of beauty on this very page may be flipped from the VUX's perspective, and any being that looks better than Just Average from our perspective would be seen as the opposite from a VUX's eye, and vice versa.
-   _Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines_:
    
    -   Nosferatu are "Fearsome and Clearly Inhuman". As a Nosferatu Fledgling, being seen in public is a violation of the Masquerade and so you have to sneak around and use the Absurdly Spacious Sewers for travel. It does however open up some hilarious dialogue options with select NPCs.
    
    -   A character with high levels of Seduction, especially a female one, will be "World Class Beauty". With a Seduction score of 7 or higher, prostitutes will offer their bodies to you without you even having to pay them.

    Web Originals 

-   The _Whateley Universe_ has a few examples of this:
    -   The "thornies" and most of Faction 3 would be classed as monstrous.
    -   Fey is a Divine beauty due to her glamour that she can't turn off although she would be at least world class without it.
    -   Despite actually being a Lovecraftian horror, Sara comes across as a Divine beauty.
    -   Most of the exemplars are World Class beauties.
-   Cecil in _Welcome to Night Vale_ describes Carlos as somewhere between World Class and Divine, but he's biased. The other townsfolk do seem to find Carlos charismatic and pleasant-looking, perhaps a high-end Common Beauty. Word of God is that he's supposed to look like the sort of person you'd find playing a scientist in a Hollywood blockbuster movie.
-   "Tc Candler" is a website that is responsible for listing the 100 most beautiful women and 100 most handsome men in the world. Just qualifying is enough to qualify as World Class Beauty, while those in the top 10 are seen as angelic beauties.

    Western Animation 

-   Several examples of various levels from the _Total Drama_ series:
    -   Justin is Divine Level Beauty so that nearly every woman (and several men and even animals) fall instantly in love with him.
    -   Lindsay, Alejandro and Heather are World Class beauties, with numerous characters mentioning their attractiveness. However, unlike Justin, no one loses control of themselves simply by looking at them (Alejandro comes close, but even he has to speak before his charm fully kicks in).
    -   Gwen, Izzy, Duncan, Trent, Courtney, Bridgette etc. are common beauties. A couple of people call each of them hot, but that's it.
-   In _Family Guy_, Meg Griffin varies between Super Ugly and Monstrous. Being with her is considered A Fate Worse Than Death in this show (this is a good example of how this is an in-universe trope, being Played for Laughs in this case; to the audience she is normal-looking and even resembles Lois, only shorter and chubbier). However, in an Alternate Universe, she is super attractive - though she is still "one of the ugly ones" as everyone is gorgeous in this universe. There is also the episode where she gets a make-over and is upgraded to World Class beauty.
    -   Lois Griffin is considered World Class beauty.
    -   James Carville is described as a class XI in one episode: "I can handle ugly, but he's like circus ugly."
    -   Peter's boss Angela is considered Super Ugly, being so ugly that not even Quagmire wanted to have sex with her, describing her as a "dumpster fire".
-   In _Gargoyles_, Demona is seen as a World Class beauty gargoyle by that species' standards. For a human, she looks like an Imperfect beauty. When she transforms into a human by day, she is considered very attractive, enough to fool her nemesis Mcbeth into marriage.
-   _The Fairly OddParents!_ has a super ugly example. There's a kid named Elmer with a boil blown out of proportion nerd style. He's the most unpopular kid in school and nobody wants to sit near him.
    -   Cosmo also is considered Super Ugly.
    -   Rex Perfection is considered World Class beauty.
    -   Trixie Tang is also seen as World Class.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   Patty and Selma are Super Ugly: they're portrayed as uncaring and unkempt with their physical presence, and, In-Universe, are occasionally mistaken for men.
    -   Moe Szyslak's "cauliflower ear, lizard lips, little rat eyes, caveman brow, and fish snout" often drop him as low as Ambiguously Monstrous in the eyes of strangers. Part of his Multiple-Choice Past implies his parentage may not be entirely human. However, he's upgraded to World Class Beauty in the episodes "Pygmoelian" following plastic surgery, earning him a role on a soap opera.
    -   Homer Simpson is Normal Ugly, being considered _just_ attractive enough to be considered a Kavorka Man. Often, it's implied that this is a problem with his obesity and baldness than anything else: whenever he _does_ get in shape and/or grows his hair back, he _instantly_ jumps straight up to Common Beauty.
    -   Marge's appearance hasn't changed over the run of the show, but she's treated as Common Beauty in the earlier seasons and World Class Beauty in the later ones.
-   Ugly Bob from _South Park_ starts off as Ambiguously Monstrous in his debut, but is upgraded to a full-on Lovecraftian Brown Note when he returns in a later episode. Of course, _all_ Canadians look the same, so we just have to take their word for it.
-   In _The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack_, there's Tee Hee Tummy Tums, "the most beautiful man in the world" who wears a mask at all times to protect the world from his shining Divine beauty. His beauty is so great that it causes people to throw money at him and his presumably equally beautiful family.
-   _Futurama_:
    -   The mutants are a Fearsome and Clearly Inhuman example. They are people mutated by toxic waste and their children are almost always born horribly mutated. The law forces them to live in the sewers because they're so hideous.
    -   Leela usually varies between Ugly Cute and imperfect beauty depending on the episode.
-   Level V: In _Avatar: The Last Airbender_, Jin, Mai, and the fangirls in the Beach Episode don't seem to mind Zuko's giant facial burn scar and lack of social skills, and he can summon Disturbed Doves by removing his shirt.
-   _The Penguins of Madagascar_, Arlene (Marlene in disguise due to chlorine accident) is considered World Class beauty, As everyone mentions how pretty she is.
-   _Scooby-Doo_:
    -   Fred and Daphne are World-Class Beauties. They're both intended to be the attractive members of the Mystery Gang and they're considered as such in-universe.
    -   Shaggy falls under Special Average since despite being designed to look less attractive than Fred, he still has a lot of female admirers throughout the franchise, with a few of them admitting he's cute.
    -   Velma is Just Average for the most part, being known for her brains rather than her looks.
-   _Steven Universe_ has Stevonnie as Divine Beauty, as they effortlessly attract both female and male characters.
    -   Rose Quartz would count as World Class Beauty, as she has also been portrayed as extremely beautiful, with Greg and Pearl both commenting on her looks.
    -   The other three Crystal Gems, Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl, would count as Common Beauty. Garnet and Pearl have both been the object of crushes (Jamie and Dewey respectively) and Vidalia uses Amethyst as a model for many of her paintings.
-   The Ugly Barnacle, from Patrick's story in _Spongebob Squarepants_, would count as among the ugliest of Type XVII, for apparently he was so ugly, that everyone died.
-   _Winx Club_ has Stella as a World Class Beauty, since she and a lot of other characters constantly refer to her good looks: winning the Miss Alfea contest and being referred to as the most beautiful fairy in Alfea probably don't hurt either. The other girls are on the Common Beauty level.
