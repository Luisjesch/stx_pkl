_"There was a change, like '92 to '94 or 5, it was just the guitar rock, everyone was a 3 or 4-piece. No keyboards, no keyboards, strictly no keyboards."_

— **David McCormack** of Custard, _Long Way to the Top: Stories of Australian Rock & Roll_

Commonly found in rock-and-roll lineups, a rock trio is a band of three members: the lineup is typically one playing guitar, one playing bass and one playing drums. The rock trio is essentially rock and roll with a bare minimum of musicians, with one member, usually bass and (almost) never drums, doubling on vocals and the guitarist doubling the rhythm and lead parts. The rock trio is thus commonly found in bands that stick to Three Chords and the Truth, though the format had its roots in bands that were more experimental with their music.

The rock trio took off in the 1960s thanks to developments in amplifier technology that allowed for the volume of guitars and bass to increase. From there, the format was popularized in the blues-rock and hard rock genres before spreading to prog rock in the 1970s and falling in popularity in the early 1980s. In this first wave, the format was commonly used by bands that engaged in long, intrinsic improvised solos and bombastic jam sessions. This version of the rock trio contributed heavily to the development of heavy metal, especially power metal. Some bands at this time (i.e. Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath) took a "3+1" approach, having a core rock trio with a fourth on vocals. Prog rock also introduced a variation that swapped the guitar for a keyboard (i.e. Emerson, Lake & Palmer), while keeping the same general idea.

After the original wave fell out of favor, the format was later adopted by punk rock and grunge bands in the late 80s and throughout the 1990s, finding the stripped-down ensemble to fit perfectly with their stripped down approach to music. Several notable punk bands from this time still exist today. The rock trio also continued to remain popular in progressive rock, though prog as a whole was in a down period at this time. Today, the rock trio continues to be used in all varieties, as well as in bands that use it as their core while adding supporting instruments and a dedicated vocalist.

It should be noted that a rock trio is more commonly known in the music industry as a **power trio** but that name is already used as a trope. Not coincidentally, the rock trio is itself a subtrope of our Power Trio. Musically, it could be compared to a Freudian Trio in that the drums focus on the beat (Superego), the guitar focuses on the melody (Id) and the bass reconciles the two (Ego), though this says nothing about the personalities of the musicians themselves. Despite the name, the rock trio is not strictly limited to rock bands: Several pop and metal bands have taken the general idea of the format and made it work.

Note that many rock trios often add "touring" musicians for live shows, especially on second and subsequent tours. Typical choices are a second guitarist to handle the rhythm and harmony parts created by overdubs by the principal guitarist in the studio or a keyboard player to handle song elements (lush synth pads, vintage organ, piano) that can't be recreated live by the basic setup. A multi-instrumentalist who can switch from guitar to keyboard to a wind instrument (sax) is also a common choice. These touring members often contribute additional auxiliary percussion (shaker/tambourine) and backing vocals to tracks where additional guitar or keyboards isn't required.

Sometimes touring members become official members at a later stage leading to the band evolving beyond the rock trio concept. Sometimes if the trio's identity as three founders is deemed too important to allow a fourth touring member onstage, the touring member may play hidden _offstage_ and have their sound added into the mix by audio engineers.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

-   Grand Funk Railroad, from 1969 to 1971.

-   Brazilian band Os Paralamas do Sucesso: Herbert Vianna (vocals/guitar), Bi Ribeiro (bass) and João Barone (drums)
    -   Also from Brazil, Legião Urbana became this after their original bassist, Renato Rocha, left and frontman Renato Russo took over his instrument on studio. In fact, Rocha was always a replacement musician; he was brought into the band because, during the recording of the first album, Russo (who was officially singer/bassist) slit his own wrists and could not play.
    -   A third example from the country was Engenheiros do Hawaii, which following the departure of The Pete Best were a trio for their first eleven years (their last album in that formation was even _Gessinger, Licks & Maltz_). Then the guitarist left, and a keyboardist became a full member to grow the band to 4.
-   Pato Fu started with just singer-guitarist-bassist and a drum machine, becoming a quartet by adding an actual drummer for their second album.
-   The band Pezz, currently known as Billy Talent, started as this before bringing Ian D'Sa in to play guitar so Ben Kowalewicz could stick with vocals.
-   Pig Destroyer used to be an unusual example: just vocals, guitar and drums, forgoing bass altogether. In more recent years they've had a fourth member in charge of noise and samples and later, added an actual bass player.
-   The post-Roger Waters Pink Floyd could count - though it was not the traditional setup (a guitarist, a keyboardist, and a drummer, and the first two sung) and lead to hired bassists (and extra singers for touring).

-   R.E.M. after the departure of drummer Bill Berry, albeit padded out with session and touring drummers.
-   Remo Drive started as a duo until Sam Mathys was added to the band, making them this trope. Then he was fired following the band's first full-length album, reverting the band into a duo for their second album. Mathys was later replaced with Sam Becht, but it's unclear if he's an official member: although he's credited as a member on their third album, he doesn't seem to be acknowledged by the rest of the band or their promotional material as one, and he seems to have less creative input in the band than Mathys ever had.

-   Revocation, at least until they hired Dan.
-   Rush: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart.

-   Sick Puppies, with the only constant being bassist Emma Anzai.

-   Sodom are probably the best known Thrash Metal rock trio, having operated as from 1981 to 2018, which is when they finally started operating with two guitarists.
-   Soft Machine, from 1967 to 1969. Their debut was recorded with a trio lineup, and their second record, though featuring Brian Hopper on alto and tenor sax as a fourth player, still only lists the core three as full-time members. Amusingly, by the release of their third album a year later the group for a short while went from formally being a trio to having as much as _seven_ members, adding four brass players to the lineup at once.
-   Sleep started out with four members but were most successful after the departure of one guitarist.
-   Snow Patrol started of as a trio and released two albums on that line-up during their indie phase. They've expanded as a quartet before the recording of their breakthrough album _Final Straw_, and have become a quintet before _Eyes Open_ and have stayed for the most part as that until September 2023, with the departure of bassist Paul Wilson and drummer Jonny Quinn, returning to the trio line-up.
-   Stray Cats. The minimalism extends to drummer Slim Jim Phantom, whose usual kit comprises a bass drum, snare drum, and one crash cymbal - which he plays standing up.
-   Stereophonics were a trio until 2007 when Adam Zindani was hired as the second guitarist.
-   The Supremes: A rare all-vocalist version, especially their music in The '60s.
-   Switchfoot was this for their first three albums. Their fourth member joined just before they hit it big, and the fifth joined just after.
    -   The same thing happened for the respected indie band Modest Mouse as well, though they've become a five-piece prior to their biggest hit and evolved into an eight-piece recently.
-   Sunny Day Real Estate were this on their album _The Rising Tide_.
-   Heavy metal band Tank started this way in a line-up similar to Venom and Motörhead (vocals/bass, guitar, drums). Just like them they later added a second guitarist, but while Venom and Motörhead returned to three members, Tank not only remained with two guitarists ever since, but they eventually expanded to five members as in 2008 they replaced founding bassist/vocalist Algy Ward by Chris Dale and Doogie White respectively (of course, unless you believe Algy, who claims he is the only member who owns rights to use the name).

-   Unlocking the Truth is a metal band consisting of three teenagers.
-   V6, which did the theme songs for _InuYasha_ and _Eyeshield 21_, contains two with the band releasing albums and touring both independently and as a combined group. This is evident in _Eyeshield 21_, where the _Coming Century_ trio did the first intro song and the _21st Century_ trio did the second. The two combined to do the _InuYasha_ theme song.

-   Violent Femmes. The classic lineup consisted of Gordon Gano (guitar), Brian Ritchie (bass), and drummer Victor De Lorenzo.

-   The Warning three sisters from Mexico
-   Wolfmother's original formation. When the band came back, it was now a four-piece.
-   Wolves in the Throne Room's original line-up was this, before they got a bassist in. They were also this at some other points of their history, but they're currently a duo consisting solely of the Weaver brothers.

-   XTC became one after the band retreated to the studio and drummer Terry Chambers left. They used studio drummers for their albums from that point on until David Gregory finally left, leaving them a duo.

    Webcomics 

-   The newly (as of August 2011) reconstituted Deathmøle (if they even choose to keep that name without Natasha around), in _Questionable Content_, fits the mold with Marten on guitar, Amir on bass and Hannelore on drums. In the short time since they got back together there's been no mention of adding a fourth member again; granted, so far it's just one semi-impromptu jam session, but clearly Marten has bigger plans this time around.
-   _Ménage à 3_ has Zii and the Troublemakers — Zii on lead guitar, Sonya on bass, Yuki on drums, with the first two apparrently sharing the vocal duties.

    Web Original

    **Strong Bad:** What!? You're not allowed to have a band with only three people in it!
    
-   The _Nightmare Time_ episode "Killer Track" has the band Needy Beast, which is made up of Thrash, the lead singer, Rose, the lead guitarist, and Skud, the drummer.

    Western Animation 

-   _Alvin and the Chipmunks_ are sometimes this, depending on the adaptation. When they do, it's Alvin on guitar, Simon on keyboard/piano and Theodore on drums. Canonically, all three are multi-talented with instruments and the later films have had Simon on bass, fulfilling the traditional definition.
-   _Josie and the Pussycats_ replaces the bass with a tambourine. As with _Alvin_, the film swapped the tambourine with a bass guitar, or rather returned to original comics, where Valerie also played bass.
-   _Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost_ gave us The Hex Girls, a goth rock trio led by Thorn (Lead vocals/Lead Guitar), with Dusk (Drums) and Luna (Bass/Keyboard) on backing vocals. The band has evidently proven popular enough to have been brought back in later iterations of the franchise.
-   The _Sonic Boom_ episode "Battle of the Boy Bands" ends on the main trio playing a rock song: Sonic is the one singing and playing guitar, Tails plays the bass, and Knuckles plays the drums.
