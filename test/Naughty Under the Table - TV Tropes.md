The naughty cousin of Footsie Under the Table, this trope features a character touched/groped/grabbed under a table or some other kind of cover. Traditionally, this is at a dinner table, but it doesn't have to be. Anyone else present doesn't know what's happening, but will probably react with confusion to the unusual expression/behavior of the victim. Differs from Footsie Under the Table in that, though a foot can be used to instigate, the target is not the victim's foot. It's the thigh. Or an even... more intimate target. Of course, Footsie Under The Table can lead to Naughty Under The Table.

The victim of the squeezing/groping, by reason of modesty, disinterest in the instigator, or simply an attachment to normal rules of propriety, will NOT desire this (at least, "not NOW")... or at the very least, would not want the other people to know what's happening.

Comes in two basic varieties: The PG-version will probably be a quick grab (probably the thigh) that causes the victim to jump up and/or react vocally, or kick the instigator. The R-version will continue longer, possibly all the way to orgasm.

If the "victim" is male and the instigator female, which is usually the case, this is almost certainly played for laughs.

No Real Life examples, please.

    Anime and Manga 

-   A short in the _Ayakashi Triangle_ manga, adapted and expanded into an audio sketch with the anime's voice actors, has Suzu's legs touching Matsuri under the kotatsu. The narration points out the ambiguity of how far she's going, and she looks too far away to reach Matsuri's crotch, but Matsuri's aroused fidgeting (and the way Suzu peels a piece of fruit) suggests more than playing footsie. Matsuri pretends nothing is happening as Suzu subtly gloats, until she accidentally wakes up Shirogane, who bites her leg.
-   This happens quite a lot in _Maka Maka_ (which is a hentai manga, so take a wild guess which variety it uses). Though strictly speaking it's only under a table once.

    Comic Books 

-   Performed in _Tart_, an erotic comic book, by the eponymous character and an ex-boyfriend. Goes the whole range from groping to oral sex to vaginal sex to him throwing off the table and revealing them to the whole restaurant in twisted exhibitionism.
-   In _Jessica Blandy_ volume 17, Jessica's lover begins caressing her between the legs. He whispers her to remove her panties, then we see his hand between her hips and Jessica is no longer able to have an intelligent conversation, and cannot hide her orgasm. At the end of the book, it is implied seeing this helped an uptight young man to become boyfriend material.

-   In the comedy film _Going the Distance_, a farmer's daughter crawls under the dinner table and goes down on one of the male guests, and then on one of the female guests.
-   In the film _Kissing Jessica Stein_, Jessica and her girlfriend Helen (who have just gotten together and are still trying to get over Jessica's epic physical intimacy issues), are at a bar together, when two men come over to their table and try to chat them up. Helen engages them in conversation and when they say they love the idea of lesbian couples, asks them what men find so fascinating about lesbian couples. As the guys are trying awkwardly to explain this, Helen begins feeling up Jessica's thigh under the table, causing Jessica to squirm in her seat and desperately try not to make a sound...until Helen's hand disappears up underneath Jessica's dress, and Jessica can't help but gasp at a sudden spike of arousal. Cue hurried excuses ("you don't look well, I should get you home to bed") and they leave...to indulge in some lovemaking. Which suffers Coitus Interruptus just after getting in through the front door.

Our eyes met and we gave into our passions right there." The priest tells them that unfortunately they couldn't join the church. The husband replies, "That's okay. We aren't allowed back at that restaurant either."
