_"Sisters of Battle, reporting!"_

The Amazon Brigade is an elite fighting unit, often the best of the best or damn near close to it, that is composed entirely of women. Naturally, they should never be underestimated, for they can and will kick your ass with ease.

They are The Squad, with about four liters of estrogen added, and little to no loss in testosterone. They are the Lovely Angels after a recruitment drive. In any case, they are a Badass Army.

This trope is common with Humongous Mecha anime, and Science Fiction in general, especially if they use fightercraft in their universe. Occasionally it shows up in Fantasy works as well, usually as the personal guard of a wealthy and powerful ruler.

In a Bishoujo Series, they are probably the main characters, their existence in this case due to the Improbably Female Cast policy. They may include The One Guy for good measure. Expect some degree of Ho Yay, especially if they are kept isolated from men. This being about fiction, they're usually at least moderately attractive.

Not to be confused with the Estrogen Brigade.

Contrast The Smurfette Principle. If the entire world is an Amazon Brigade instead of a single squad, then you have a World of Action Girls. Similar to Battle Harem (an Amazon brigade in love with the same guy).

    Art 

-   "The Battle of the Amazons", commonly attributed to Reubens, depicts a battle between Greeks and Amazons.

    Comic Strips 

-   Played for laughs in one _Bloom County_ arc where Opus infiltrates Mary Kay Cosmetics and comes face-to-face with the Mary Kay Commandos, salesladies in pink dresses _and_ combat gear. "Even their Uzis are pink!" gasps Opus. (They were such a hoot, they were featured on the cover of a paperback collection.)
-   The original _Flash Gordon_ strip's villain Emperor Ming's army has segregated female combat units, though relatively little is seen of them (presumably because a hero like Flash Wouldn't Hit a Girl).
-   Sala and her Sky Band, an all female band of Sky Pirates, from _The Phantom_.
-   A _Tarzan_ parody from Wally Wood's _Sally Forth_ features a tribe of naked, pterodactyl-riding warrior women.

    Fan Works 

-   The Mirage squadron in _Ace Combat: Equestria Chronicles_.
-   The Replica Elite from _Aeon Natum Engel_, although their femininity is only skin-deep; they act no different from _FEAR_'s male Replica Elite.
-   In Terry Pratchett's _Discworld_ fandom:
    -   A whole body of work has been presented about the Last Detail, the all-female combat unit introduced in _Monstrous Regiment_. This largely results in femslash about Polly Perks and the vampire female Maledicta, but all the fictions emphasise what a coherent, hard, fighting unit they are.
    -   The new generation of female Assassins are also badass, either taken individually or working as teams. Lady T'Malia, Alice Band, Madame Deux-Epées, Remora Selachii, miss Smith-Rhodes and Jocasta Wiggs are the named Assassins in Pratchett's canon. Other fanfic writers have expanded on these characters and added new ones, such as Ruth N'Kweze, Joan Sanderson-Reeves and Davinia Bellamy. (For an example, see _The Graduation Class_ by A.A. Pessimal.)
    -   Howondalandian Assassin Ruth N'Kweze is ordered Home, against her will, to take up her Royal duties as Paramount Crown Princess. Ruth discovers she is practically obliged to raise her own impi of fighting soldiers for the Zulu Empire. Checking the small print and discovering nobody has ever specified the gender of her troops, nor placed an upper limit on how many people make an impi, she starts recruiting women - for the first time ever in the Zulu Empire. The Lioness Impi - which also incorporates cavalry and later on artillery - wins a war on its first blooding in combat. After a battle with a powerful werecreature sent to kill her, Ruth rewards her best fighters with silver-plated spears and nominates them as her élite bodyguard.
    -   And the Ankh-Morpork City Watch Air Police, from its humble beginnings involving two air minded witches joining a couple of Gnomes and Feegle, develops into what amounts to a full Air Wing of forty fliers, mainly on broomsticks and Pegasi, but with a motley of other air-capable Magitek. The only non-female flyers are a couple of Klatchians who tend the magic carpets, and those Feegle - subordinate to the Witches - who pilot the birds of prey. The Bursar of Unseen University is also a honorary member. Otherwise, the best part of forty flying witches are an Amazon Brigade in service of the City, the nearest thing Ankh-Morpork has to an Air Force. As the commander and her deputy are both Discworld "Russians", the analogy to the Night Witches of World War II is deliberate. At the latest point in the unfolding tale, the Air Witches are poised to form a new squadron of heavier and more powerful winged creatures than Pegasi - winged flying elephants. One witch muses that with one of those castle things up on the back like war elephants in the old days, we've got Flying Fortresses.

-   _The Great Alicorn Hunt_: Rarity's new branch of the Royal Guard, the Radiant Guard, is composed entirely of mares who look like models, but can throw weapons with pinpoint accuracy and toss a grown stallion across a room.
-   In the _Star Wars / Harry Potter_ crossover _Harry Tano_, a high-tech all-female paintball team called the Themyscerans make an appearance and later participate in the final battle.
-   The Kamen Rider Club Girls in _Horseshoes and Hand Grenades_.
-   Since _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device_ is based in the _Warhammer 40,000_ universe, the Adeptas Sororitas show up.
    
    **The Emperor**: Right, right. I think I remember that too. Some girl came in here, and stared at me with depraved, flustered eyes. If I had the proper bodily components left, I would have probably gotten a fairly insecure boner.  
    **Kitten**: That's the Adeptas Sororitas for ya!
    
-   _A Jade Dragon_: The Jade Order are a group of specially trained women warriors who act as bodyguards to the female members of Yi-Ti's royal family. Arya joins their ranks after arriving in Yi-Ti.
-   The Professional Wrestling series _The JWL_ included The Revolution, made up of Ivory, Molly Holly and 11 alumnae of WOW Women of Wrestling.
-   The Keepers in _Keepers of the Elements_.
-   _The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time (DragonRand100)_ The Gerudo, like the counterparts in the game, are a predominantly female race that rely on mixing with other societies to find males. It is revealed that in the distant past a curse was afflicted on them by the Sheikah that causes male children to often die at childbirth. Inevitably, it is explained that this would result in the Gerudo race dying out in the future, unless the curse could be broken.

-   _Naru-Hina Chronicles_ has Anko's Angels, an all-female squad leaded and trained by the Snake Lady herself.
-   In keeping with the base canon, _Armored Core_ + _Muv-Luv Alternative_ crossover fic _Project Ignition_, all of the Lynx who are actually affiliated (Not Independents, Not Torus, and not Aldra) with the Interior Union are female. A special note goes out to Kagami, Lunaterisa, and Aerilynn, who are generally known as "The Three Valkyries", who are an elite squad piloting stolen Super Prototype.
-   The Professional Wrestling story, _The Return - Remixed_, centers around WWE being invaded by DEAR, a group made up of former Divas led by Trish Stratus and Lita. The Diva roster eventually unites and combats them by forming their own group, the Diva Army.
-   _Secret Dreamer_ has the newly reformed pegasus knights, led by Cynthia and Severa.
-   _The Secret Return of Alex Mack_ sees Alex assemble a team that's primarily female. Understandable, since the starting point of the story was that Alex had been part of The League of Extraordinary Women, and now wants to track down the local analogues of the Alternate Universe women she met. But even the new team members who weren't part of the league are largely female.
-   _Shadows Awakening_: The Shadowkhan tribe that Jade learns to create is composed entirely of kunoichi (female ninja).
-   Clan Falzen in _The Tainted Grimoire_.
-   In _Total Drama_ fanfic series _Unbreakable Red Silken Thread_ Upon meeting Jasmine's family, Heather's first instinct is that she's stumbled into a home of giants. The fact that Jasmine's youngest sister is the same height as her, and hasn't even hit puberty yet, only reinforced this notion.
-   _Voyages of the Wild Sea Horse_:
    -   The Kamikaze Pirates, our protagonists, are almost literally 99% female. Of the eleven crew members (not counting The Imp and Living Macguffin, Umok), there's a grand total of three guys, and they consist of two master martial artists who turn into girls when splashed with cold water and a Wholesome Crossdresser swordsman so girly-looking that he won a pirate beauty contest. The female crewmembers consist of two practitioners of Supernatural Martial Arts, a Little Bit Beastly Anime Chinese Girl who _also_ practices Supernatural Martial Arts, a Technically Living Vampire, a 3-meter tall shark-girl, a skunk-girl with Super-Strength, a Fem Bot, and a shapeshifting naga with Super Spit.
    -   The Island of Femille in the Paradise portion of the Grand Line is an "Amazon Island", which means it's a Lady Land with a proud martial tradition where _only_ women are allowed to practice martial arts. Men are instead expected to be quiet, demure, polite, and generally extremely effeminate homemakers.
-   _Webwork_: Jade eventually gains a Quirky Miniboss Squad in the form of a trio of tough biker chicks whom she forcibly transforms into Jorogumo/Oni hybrids like herself. And then there's her tribe of spider-ninja creatures that she uses as Mooks and who are all female as well.
-   Discussed and inverted in the MLP:FIM adult fic _Xenophilia_. Between the gender disproportion of Equestria and the matriarchal system resulting from the two immortal princesses, Men Are the Expendable Gender is inverted, along with many social norms. That means the buff pegasi and unicorns guarding Celestia are the local equivalent of Bodyguard Babes.

    Films — Animation 

-   In _Shrek Forever After_, Rumpelstiltskin's entire standing army is made up of _Wizard of Oz_\-style Wicked Witches. Apparently, nobody thought to utilize their Weaksauce Weakness and just spray them with a fire hose.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The Slayers after season 7 of _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_. Every slayer is female and all of them are walking anti-vampire weapons. After the events of season eight Kennedy didn't just sit on her hands. She creates Deepscan, giving Slayers with no further purpose a job in bodyguard work.

-   _Legend of the Seeker_: The series has three groups of this type.
    -   The Confessors are an all-female order with the power to brainwash people by touch so they'll fall helplessly in love with them. Often they use this power on enemies in battle, making them come to their side, but are also adept with daggers.
    -   The Mord Sith are the Bodyguard Babes of the D'haran Empire's ruler Lord Rahl and his torture technicians. With their agiels, magical weapons that inflict pain, they're formidable opponents, and also use bows ably. They can also rebound spells back on sorceresses or wizards, making them feared among even the most powerful magic users.
    -   The Sisters of the Light (plus the Dark faction among them) are powerful sorceresses who train young magic users. Many are very skilled at fighting with spells and bladed magical weapons called dacras which can kill instantly if they will it.

-   _Star Trek: Picard_: The Qowat Milat is a very ancient order of Romulan warrior nuns who are so exceptionally skilled in combat that even the Tal Shiar fears them.
-   _Supergirl (2015)_ gives us a temporary one in "Fort Rozz", where Supergirl and Saturn Girl are forced to work alongside Livewire and Psi in order to go to Fort Rozz and find out more about Reign. The only reason no male characters go is because the station is circling a star, whose radiation is lethal to anyone with a Y chromosome (apparently, all males in the universe have the chromosome).
-   The Amazon cult in season 7 of _Supernatural_.
-   _Super Sentai_
    -   The Zero Girls of _Taiyou Sentai Sun Vulcan_ are a villainous example, an Elite Four of female assassins who act as spies and enforcers for Machine Empire Black Magma.

-   _S.W.A.T. (2017)_: In "Never Again" the robbers turn out to all be women. Due to their skill, Deacon and Hondo openly express admiration for them. They also had been in an all-female Israeli military unit together, which is how they'd acquired their skills.
-   _Troy: Fall of a City_: The Amazons, naturally, are a group of warrior women that fight on the Trojans' side.
-   _The Wheel of Time (2021)_:
    -   The Aes Sedai aren't all fighters, and they refrain from using magic as a weapon against human beings (Shadowspawn are fair game) unless there are no other options, though nonetheless they're quite capable of doing so. In the time of the show, they only have female members, since the male half of the One Power is now tainted and these days men who channel inevitably go violently mad. One of the seven color-coded groups called Ajahs that make up the Aes Sedai's organization, the Green Ajah, is devoted to combatting Shadowspawn, however, fitting this trope the most. The Red Ajah also fit to an extent since they're devoted to preventing misuse of the One Power, which most often means hunting down and gentling male channelers by force.
    -   The Shienaran woman all take arms like their men in "The Eye of the World" to defend Fal Dara from a Trolloc army.
    -   At the end of Season 1, we see the Seanchan Empire's fleet coming to the shore, after the _damane_ (enslaved channelers) and _sul'dam_ (their taskmasters). Under their command, the _damane_ channel to create a tidal wave. Later they are shown creating fire and blows of air. Both _damane_ and _sul'dam_ are entirely women, with the _damane_ being channeling slave soldiers for the Seanchan who use the One Power against their enemies in battle under control of the _sul'dam_.
    -   The warrior societies of the nomadic, desert-dwelling Aiel people include the all-female Maidens of the Spear, who are shown to be individually capable of overpowering several grown men armed with swords.

-   The tribe of _literal_ Amazons in _Xena: Warrior Princess_.

-   The _Sabaton_ song "Night Witches" is about the all-female 588th Night Bomber Regiment of the Soviet Air Force (see Real Life below).

-   In _Sunrider_, all the pilots in the player’s Mecha squadron are female, and they routinely defeat enemy forces which vastly outnumber them. Granted, they each use unique, specialized mecha suited to their individual fighting styles as opposed to the enemy forces' standard, mass-produced mecha, but all of them are still considered to be highly proficient in their respectives areas of expertise. They’re so skilled, in fact, people start calling them the Sunrider Valkyries in the good endings of _Sunrider Liberation Day_’s \[RE\]turn scenario.

    Web Animation 

-   _RWBY_: Team RWBY is comprised of four females who are all highly talented fighters. In Volume 7, General Ironwood fast-tracks them to graduated, licenced Huntresses, even though they've only had a single year of formal training at the elite Beacon Academy because the year they've spent outside the Academy has successfully pitted them against challenges and threats most people never face and don't even know exist. They are then mentored throughout the volume by Atlas's most elite team, the best-of-the-best Ace-Ops. When the heroes come to blows at the end of the volume, Ace-Ops assumes they'll win because they're the best Huntsmen in Atlas. However, Team RWBY is unexpectedly able to defeat them; while Volume 8 clarifies the Ace-Ops only lost because they refuse to admit their feelings for each other, thereby sabotaging their own ability to work as a team, Team RWBY's achievement is still regarded as unprecedented enough to cement their place as an elite team of female warriors.
    -   There's also the Happy Huntresses, a Gender Flip Expy of Robin Hood and the Merry Men. They were all top students in Atlas Academy, but decided to abandon the military in favor of helping Mantle.

    Web Comics 

-   The eponymous _Agents of the Realm_ are a group of five Chosen Ones Magical Girl Warriors. The interlude at the end of chapter two suggests that on the other side of the Divide, the Agents are also women only.
-   The Amazons of _Amazoness!_ To be expected, since their whole population is female.
-   The entirety of Earth's military in _Angels 2200_. (A plague having wiped out most of the male population, there are no adult males on Earth or most of Earth's colonies.)
-   The matriarchal Orycalopes of _Charby the Vampirate_ are a race of bunny demons whose weaker males traditionally stay hidden in their Kingdom's caves while the females are their warriors and gatherers. A group of young orycalope girls called the Rose Sisters work as guards for King Samrick since he finds it hilarious that they are surprisingly stronger and more vicious than they appear, even if they are far from the strongest things in Kellwood.
-   The Amazons of _Chasing the Sunset_. Their foremothers were ordinary women who took up combat to save themselves: by the time we meet them in the comic, they are blue-skinned warriors who reproduce asexually.
-   Completely justified in _Digger_. The hunters and warriors of the hyena tribe are all female because they, just like real-life hyenas, are larger and stronger than the males. Also played with: at one point digger goes adventuring with two females and an ungendered shadow creature, the only male being their guide. But culturally, Grim Eyes the Hyena has a 'male' role and attitude. Similarly, Ed the Hyena is Digger's best friend and he is male, but is cuturally in a 'feminine' role.
-   Haven's Guard in _Earthsong_ form an Amazon Brigade, including The One Guy, Zaebos. And one Hermaphrodite Tengu...
-   In _Erfworld_, the Archons of Charlescomm. Yes, that makes them Charlie's Archons.
-   _Girl Genius_:
    -   Bangladesh DuPree's pirate crew seems to be entirely female.
    -   Geisterdamen are spider-riding albino Amazones.
    -   And Zeetha's mysterious tribe. Lots of Amazons.
    -   Same goes for Heliolux Airship Fleet's flagship crew.
-   The priestesses of Ojhal in _Glorianna_.
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, Ellen, Grace, and Nanase form a temporary Amazon Brigade during the Painted Black arc.
-   As of _Homestuck_'s Act 6 Intermission 5 (and the subsequent Interfishin), Vriska, Aradia, Meenah, and Aranea could be considered a pirate-themed spin on this.
-   The Remix Comic version of _Jet Dream_ recasts the girls as an all-transgender Amazon Brigade.
-   _Jewel Vixens_
-   _Leif & Thorn_: The Embassy guards are all athletic blonde women, with Alruna as The One Enby.
-   An internet offshoot of Marvel UK's _Warheads_ series, _Loose Cannons_ tells the tale of an experimental all-female group of Warheads (paramilitary units sent through spacetime wormholes to gather technology and magical artifacts for the Corrupt Corporate Executive leaders of the sinister MysTech; think _Stargate SG-1_ as mercenary raiders hired by a cabal of evil sorcerers) called the Virago Troop— who bring back more than they bargain for from an After the End future.
-   _Outsider_ has the Loroi, a species of space elves with an all-female military. Justified, since only one in eight Loroi are born male, which they consider a basic adaptation for a warrior species, since it allows them to create some massive population booms where necessary, or avoid overpopulation by restricting access to males. Further justified by the fact that Loroi females are actually the bigger and stronger members of the species. The males are child-sized.
-   In _Pacificators_, Commander Bismun Volborth set out to create a platoon consisting entirely of T-Pacificators. He did just that... without realizing that he accidentally created a platoon full of girls. Ever since, it's been a Running Gag that Platoon 113 is a Harem Platoon.
-   Illyra, Elysia, and Occela form the basis of a budding Amazon Brigade in _Rumors of War_. Given that the setting is based on Greek Mythology, _one or more of them may actually be Amazons_.
-   Though not a brigade specifically, the female cast members of _Something\*Positive_ are both more violent and most of the time, stronger than the male cast members (although how much the male members are willing to fight in general may have something to do with it). The basic rules seems to be that if somebody has a pair of breasts and is reasonably intelligent, she can probably kick your ass.
-   The Princesses of Jahad in _Tower of God_.
-   Subverted, horrifically, with the pornographic Guro webcomic _U.S. Angel Corps_, whose Excuse Plot consists of a band of orphaned women and girls who are trained as an elite fighting force meant to take down a terrorist organization... except they all get brutally raped and / or murdered in the most over-the-top gruesome fashion imaginable in _every... single... episode_.

    Web Original 

-   Practically the entirety of _The Black Legion of the Dark Lord Sketch Melkor_. They're run by a girl in high school, Sketch, and the majority of the Legion consists of action girls that make blood sacrifices and invaded Canada. There's also a genderqueer balrog warlord, and the only three guys in the Legion are self-proclaimed nerds that participate less than everyone else in conquests.
-   _Critical Role_: While the Mighty Nein are a mixed-gender group, there's a pretty clean split between the more martial ladies and the more magical guys. Barbarian Yasha is a hulking powerhouse wielding a five-foot greatsword, monk Beau is a Butch Lesbian jock who specializes in Supernatural Martial Arts, and rogue Nott is fast and slippery with a deadly crossbow aim. Meanwhile, the men of the party are scrawny and shy wizard Caleb, insecure pretty-boy warlock Fjord, and unhealthily skinny cleric Caduceus. Exceptions that prove the rule are Jester, a female cleric who is second only to Yasha in Strength, and Molly, a masc-aligned genderfluid bloodhunter and Agent Peacock who dual-wields scimitars.

-   In _The Gods Are Bastards_ the biggest example is Silver Legions, Church Militant of Avei, goddess of war, women and justice.
-   In _A More Personal Union_, the Chinese revolutionary known as Red Tiger has a harem of concubines that also serve as his inner circle of warriors.
-   The Entire Nileniran Military in _The Movolreilen Saga_, but especially the Swordcheeks, woman who completed a nine-year Training from Hell.
-   Team Kimba of the _Whateley Universe_ is really close, considering that their one 'boy' was born a girl named Hannah. The Whateley Academy Martial Arts Cheerleaders are all-girl but not tough enough to be a true Amazon Brigade.

They are open to men and foreigners joining them, but only if they commit to the group's cultural and feminine identity.
    -   There's the trio of Princess Azula, Mai and Ty Lee. Not only are they three of the gaang's toughest antagonists, consisting of one gifted firebender and two nonbenders skilled enough to go toe to toe with benders, they also managed to conquer Ba Sing Sei. This is a feat not even Iroh's army could accomplish after laying siege to the city for six hundred days!

-   The Amazons (surprise, surprise) in _Motorcity_, with their leader Foxy. Claire briefly teams up with them, and Julie pretends to be interested in joining.
-   In comparison to the previous generations, the main characters of _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ are prepared to get into a fight and handle themselves well if they have to. The G1 ponies seem to be helpless without Megan, and the G3 ponies had virtually no conflict to begin with. The male fans of the show seem to like it this way too, to the point that if someone refers to the main characters as the "Mane 7" and includes poor Spike, it tends to cause drama.
-   _Phineas and Ferb_ has the Fireside Girls. Doubly so in _Phineas and Ferb The Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension_, where their counterparts and Candace-2 form the main squad of La Résistance, with Baljeet-2 as The One Guy. (Buford-2 apparently used to be part of their group as well, but he started resisting them, too.)
-   Season 5 of of _Samurai Jack_ has the Daughters of Aku, septuplets raised by an Aku-worshipping cult who were trained since childhood specifically for the goal of killing Jack.
    -   We later find out that the Scotsman had about at least a few dozen daughters, each as brawny as him and trained to help battle against Aku.
-   _She-Ra: Princess of Power_: There's a couple of token guys but the vast majority of the Princess Alliance is, as you'd expect, made up of a variety of butt-kicking ladies.
-   _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ features the Night Sisters of Dathomir.
-   While actually genderless rocks that project a humanoid form, the Gems of _Steven Universe_ are all very feminine in appearance, voice, and are interpreted as female by the humans in their setting. The Crystal Gems, central to the story, is a trio that are experienced fighters of superhuman capability- the titular character Steven being the only male Gem due to being a Half-Human Hybrid. Due to the nature of Gems, it's likely any group of offensive Gems would qualify as this.
-   The Screaming Queens from _Storm Hawks_.
-   Villainous example: Turmoil and her all-female squadron of fighter pilots from the _SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron_ episode "Cry Turmoil".
-   The Warrior Maidens from _ThunderCats_.
-   _Total Drama_:
    -   _World Tour_ has "Team Amazon" consisting of four girls and Cody.
    -   Also in _Pahkitew Island_, "Team Kinosewak" after episode 8, their team is reduced entirely to female members.
-   The three eponymous characters from _Totally Spies!_ (WHOOP doesn't seem to have an all-female requirement for spies, but the most prominent recurring character who was a member was Britney, and Mandy was also a member briefly. The trio does report to Jerry, a male superior.)
-   Elita One and the Female Autobots in _The Transformers_.
-   The _Winx Club_ <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  are six fairies who face evil witches, wizards, and monsters on a daily basis, and beat them all up spectacularly.
-   The five title characters of _W.I.T.C.H._ are five Magical Girls in the vein of Sailor Moon. As they work for a Guardian of the Multiverse in the series and the original comics they are frequently dispatched as a squad to deal with the occasional Dimension Lord and other threats.
    -   It also appears that the Guardians are always all-female; the previous team, CHYKN, was also all-girls, and it is implied that that is tradition.
-   The Bayville Sirens from _X-Men: Evolution_.
