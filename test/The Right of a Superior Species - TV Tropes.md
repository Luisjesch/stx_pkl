_Each was powerful, well-armored, and a veteran of many a raid. Those who saw them said they made Toa look like some kind of Rahi that crawled out under a rock. They saw themselves as a higher level of being, preordained to rule by virtue of their superior strength and intellect._

— _BIONICLE_ on the subject of the Barraki, "City of the Lost"

Out in the reaches of space, an alien race exists that has developed far beyond any human civilization. Said aliens will believe they are justified in killing or enslaving humans due to their higher intelligence. They don't necessarily hate humans, they just believe that humans are so insignificant as to be unworthy of moral consideration. Bonus points if they draw parallels between the way they treat humans and the way humans treat other animals.

The purpose of this trope is often to question the attitudes that justify the exploitation of animals, the environment, and/or other cultures. Works that use this trope ask the question, "What if there was someone who treated you the way you treat those you have power over?" In particular, this trope often draws inspiration from the white supremacist attitudes that were used to justify slavery, the actions of European colonial empires, and America's westward expansion, to say nothing of the Nazis.

Not every alien species that victimizes humans fits this trope. As a guideline, please note that this trope applies if either:

-   A character in the work articulates this trope, such as the aliens explicitly stating that their superiority frees them from moral considerations; or
-   It is shown that the aliens behave in a more honorable manner towards those whom they believe to be their equals or superiors. A race that treats everyone badly when they can get away with it may be simply evil.

Overlaps heavily with The Social Darwinist, type three, and Humans Are Insects. Contrast Alien Non-Interference Clause and Benevolent Alien Invasion. See also Can't Argue with Elves. When these attitudes are applied to fellow members of one's species, then you're looking at a self-styled Master Race. It can be argued that _any_ species that practices this trope is probably **not** actually a Superior Species, but stories that use it heroically/unironically never seem to touch upon this argument.
