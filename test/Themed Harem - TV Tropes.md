A type of Author Appeal in the Harem Genre. Like a particular Moe character type? There's not just one character that fits in this show/game/what have you, but the whole cast is composed of them! (Well, usually. Sometimes there's an odd haremette out, just for variety's sake.)

Necessarily needs something like Four-Girl Ensemble or Four-Temperament Ensemble to differentiate their personalities, if not attaching other moe stereotypes to each of the characters, because you can't very well have four or five pining childhood friends that have been waking you up in the morning for fifteen years without a bit of variety between them.

Also, doesn't seem to apply to settings; even though these are actual and well-known moe attributes, "they're all soldiers" or "they're all schoolgirls" doesn't count, or we'd have every harem series on here and then some. Plus it's really about personality type. If they were all the hardened soldier type with a secret Bodyguard Crush or tall high-school students with inferiority complexes, now that would be different.

Super-Trope of Hero's Slave Harem.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You_ plays into its already ridiculous long term promise by having each of the titular girlfriends be a different flavor of crazy through Deconstructed Character Archetypes and parodying numerous Harem Genre clichés. Also, practically everyone in the harem has a Friendless Background.
-   _Ah My Buddha_ - a harem of nuns (not Mikos).
-   In _Ai Kora_, every member of Hachibei's harem has one of what he considers to be the perfect attributes for a woman.
-   In _Asa kara Pika Pika_, all three of Itou's suitors are named Hiroshi.
-   Minor joke in _Black Lagoon_ fandom, as so far, Rock, of all people, attracted at least two Action Girls (Revy & Eda) and one Lady of War (Balalaika). Although it's definitely obvious that only one of them is clearly falling/lusting after him (in a way), at least they had some potential.
-   _Bonjour Koiaji Patisserie_ - a harem of four aspiring pastry chefs.
-   _Change 123_ has a "harem" of four girls who are actually Split Personalities of the same girl.
-   In _Do You Like Big Girls?_, the girls are all members of the main character's sister's volleyball team, and (with the exception of the team captain Sanae) are MUCH taller than him.
-   In _Eiken_, every female in the harem has huge boobs.
-   _G-On Riders_ has nothing but meganekko.

-   _Monster Musume_ - another harem of Cute Monster Girls.
-   _Nisekoi_ - A harem of childhood friends, more specifically the Forgotten First Meeting kind of childhood friends.
-   In _Omujo Omutsu Joshi_, for reasons of personal need, personal pleasure, or the personal belief it's what the male lead is into, all three haremettes wear diapers.
-   _Ouran High School Host Club_ differentiates the characters into common types, but they all fall under Princely Young Man — and, if you ask the protagonist, Upper-Class Twit as well.
-   The girls in _Princess Resurrection_ are all dominant/assertive, with half being Aloof Dark Haired Girls.
-   In _The Quintessential Quintuplets_, Fuutarou gains a harem where all five girls are identical quintuplet sisters.
-   _Ranma ½_ features dangerous martial artists of some kind or another, however bizarre or outlandish. They're all Tsundere Clingy Jealous Girls, on top of that.
-   _Rosario + Vampire_ - an Unwanted Harem consisting of five Cute Monster Girls.
-   _Two_ harems of Robot Girls in _Saber Marionette J_ - not only that; Lime, Cherry, and Bloodberry have an Edible Theme Naming, while Tiger, Luchs/Lynx, and Panther have a Vehicular Theme Naming / Animal Theme Naming.
-   _Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei_ may count - the protagonist is male, and most of the other characters are female students. Many of them have crushes on or Ship Tease with him, and every single one of them has an unnerving psychosis of some kind. Some of them have actual psychological disorders, others are just plain weird.
-   _Sekirei_ features multiple harems of Human Alien Magical Girlfriends, most of which are also Action Girls with enormous breasts.
-   _Tenchi Muyo!_ - a harem of Human Aliens. The original OVA series also has an incest theme - Ayeka and Sasami are Tenchi's great-aunts, Ryoko is technically Washu's daughter, Washu herself is actually a goddess and a sister of Tsunami (the goddess who is fusing with Sasami), which technically makes her Sasami's sister (albeit on a spiritual level rather than a genetic one), and Mihoshi is Washu's descendant.
-   _Yumeria_ - a harem of Super Heroines.

    Comic Books

-   _Gonin Hitoyaku demo Kimi ga Suki_ - another harem of quintuplets, with the twist that they're all pretending to be the same person.
-   _Ground Control to Psychoelectric Girl_ is basically a harem of really weird girls — hence the name. The first part of its Japanese title (_Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko_) is often translated as "Lunatic Women".

-   _Nyaruko: Crawling with Love!_ - A harem of Cthulhu Mythos Eldritch Abominations in the form of cute teen humans.
-   In the book _Power Play: A Hockey Romance_ by Mia Moon, the heroine finds herself being courted by four hockey players.
-   In _Rebuild World_: While this is more a straight up action Cyberpunk series, there is the theme of the teasing Cool Big Sis / Big Sister Mentor (known in anime communities as the "Ara Ara Onee-san" archetype), represented by Virtual Sidekick Alpha, the Friendly Shop Keeper Shizuka, and the two Heterosexual Life-Partners Elena and Sara. While Sheryl and Carol differ from that template, most of the mentioned characters are a Proud Beauty, as well. Although Akira denies having a type.
-   _Sister Princess_ is a harem made up of Little Sister Heroines, with 12 or 13 sisters running around proclaiming their Big Brother Attractions.

-   In _The Phoenix's Ashes_, the heroine is a phoenix shifter who becomes the love interest of three sexy dragon shifters.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Kanon_ has four childhood friends; in fact, the fact that Shiori is a standard Delicate and Sickly girl with no previous connection to the hero (making her the odd haremette out) may explain why she always gets shafted in adaptations and merchandise. In this case, Nayuki has the traits of the typical Patient Childhood Love Interest, living with the male hero and harbouring a crush on him for years.
-   The eroge _Little My Maid_ is Exactly What It Says on the Tin: a meido-centric game (although you could also go after the ojou); the title is actually a pun because it turns out the maids are actually _mermaids_ and, more to the point, the daughters of Urashima Tarō and mistress Hime was his wife, Otohime and is their mother.
-   _Lets Meow Meow_ has 3 catgirls (one of which is a Meido, one is a Robot Girl and the third is a Miko), a rabbit girl, a police officer dog-girl and a Childhood Friend who doesn't mind dressing up like a Cute Monster Girl from time to time.

-   _Futakoi_, at the very least, had _six sets of **twins**_ for the harem. It really took things to the next level and, naturally, repeatedly pushes the protagonist into some sort of awed dizziness (that is, when he's not too busy running from his harem's own "harems" or other "defenders").
-   _Katawa Shoujo_ is set in a school for special needs students, and so all the girls are somehow disabled, ill, or otherwise physically "vulnerable": you get to choose between one who is deaf-mute, one who is blind, one with no arms, one with no legs, and one who is covered in horrible burn scars.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Dracu-Riot!_ is about vampire girls, with one exception for variety.
-   _Imouto Paradise_ is, unsurprisingly, about Little Sister Heroines. Five, to be specific.
-   Invoked in _Tsukihime_. Shiki is said by fans to have this strange "Tohno Gland" that specifically drives away normal girls, and attracts incredibly beautiful but incredibly crazy women. Thus, all of his girls have something to do with the supernatural.
-   _Purino Party_ sets the player up for girls with different sexual interests.
-   Both _Yandere I Love You So I Want To Kill You_ and _My Harem Heaven is Yandere Hell_ revolve around a harem of Yanderes.
-   In _Seven Hotties, All My Husbands_, all of the love interests are celebrities with high-paying jobs.
-   In _Liar! Uncover the Truth_, nine of the ten love interests are liars.
-   In _Extracurricular Activities_, the main cast are muscular anthropomorphic men who are all tennis players that are on the same team as you, including the coach, and they have quirky personalities.
-   _Kamigami no Asobi_ features a harem of attractive gods.
-   _Star-Crossed Myth_ has a double theme - not only are all the love interests gods of the Zodiac, half of them are from the Department of Punishments, while the other half are from the Department of Wishes.
-   _Shall We Date?_:
    -   In _Shall We Date?: My Fairy Tales_, all of the heroes are Gender Flipped versions of famous fairytales (with the sole exception of Hansel and Gretel - Gretel is gender-flipped, Hansel isn't).
    -   _Shall We Date?: Ninja Shadow_ has a harem of handsome male ninjas for a ninja Player Character.
    -   In _Shall We Date?: My Sweet Prince_, all six love interests are princes.
    -   _Shall We Date: Destiny Ninja_ - another harem of male ninjas.
    -   In _Shall We Date?: Blood In Roses_, all the love interests are magical in some way (werewolf, vampire, wizard, etc).
-   _Diabolik Lovers_ is a reverse harem consisting of vampires, and they're all Fetishized Abusers, too.
-   _Enchanted in the Moonlight_ - a harem of ayakashi, all of whom have a Bodyguard Crush on the heroine.
-   _Starry☆Sky_ - a harem of good looking young men (3 per game) who each represent a sign from the Western Zodiac.
-   _Harem Island ~Otoko_ - a harem of Cosplay Otaku Girls (it's a fantasy-themed park).
-   _Eji Koi_ - a harem of Egyptian gods.
-   The Black Foxes of _Love Letter from Thief X_ are a harem of Kaitous.
-   In _Dream Daddy_, all the potential love interests are single fathers (as is the protagonist).
-   _Seduce Me (Otome)_ - a harem of incubi.
-   _Pirates in Love_: A harem of handsome pirates.
-   _Scandal in the Spotlight_ - the five attractive members of a boy band.
-   _Dame X Prince_ – another harem of princes. _Eccentric_ princes.
-   _Missing Stars_ is set in a school for teenagers with mental health problems.
-   In _XOXO Droplets_, the theme is...well, the trailer referred to the boys (and the protagonist) as "f\*\*\*ing terrible people" for a _reason_. None of them reach Fetishized Abuser levels, but still.

    Web Comics 

-   _El Goonish Shive_:
    -   It was Played for Laughs once for Nanase, who had a lot of ex-boyfriends whose name started with G.
    -   Played-Not-So-For-Laughs in the "Family Tree" arc when an evil magic user starts turning everyone at a holiday party into identical, subservient, mind-slaves (who happen to bear a striking resemblance to Nanase) in an attempt to rebuild the harem-cult he had controlled in the past.
-   _Ow, my sanity_ - a harem of Eldritch Abominations who take the form of Cute Monster Girls.
