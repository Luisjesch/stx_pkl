It's all part of being human.

So your show is ending and you want to add some drama? Why not have the characters move away? This trope is when a piece of media ends with the characters moving away from their home to another place. It can be anything - a new job, finally getting the chance to go to a dream location, evil being still out there. What matters is that it's where the media ends. Generally, these endings feature the character having achieved their Goal in Life, and the show may end there as they may have nothing more to say about the characters. It's also used as a form of fitting dramatic conclusion - after all, Nothing Is the Same Anymore.

If the character has suffered over the course of said media, then it can serve as a form of Earn Your Happy Ending - they're finally able to escape the past and move on with their lives elsewhere. Whilst it usually occurs as part of a standalone, it can apply to series as well. Focus may be put on the character experiencing Moving Angst before being given An Aesop that life changes all the time. It may also be used to show off an end-of-series Continuity Cavalcade via the character seeing their favorite locations in their home location a final time before leaving. This is generally a Bittersweet Ending - the character is usually heading off to somewhere better, but they have to say goodbye to all their friends as they do so.

Of course, if it proves to be a Series Fauxnale or a sequel is created, then it can go a few ways. One involves doing a Sequel Reset and have the characters return. Another way is to simply set the sequel to where the character has moved and use the opportunity to tell different stories using the changed setting. Alternatively, the opportunity may be utilized to simply write out the character.

May occur as part of a Stock Sitcom Grand Finale. Can overlap with Babies Ever After if the reasons for moving involve raising a child and Wedding Finale if it involves a wedding. It can also overlap with Starting a New Life, especially if in moving away the character completely disconnects from their old life. Compare But Now I Must Go, when itinerant heroes move on at the end of the story; I Choose to Stay, where the character has already left home and opts not to return; and Graduate from the Story, where the characters complete school and are often getting ready to move away. Contrast Home Sweet Home and Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence, when a character moves away after death to a greater spiritual realm. If this is subverted, it's With a Foot on the Bus.

## As this is an Ending Trope, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.

Unfortunately for Bloo, Mac tells him they've done all those things already.

Angelica overhears the story Tommy tells and remembers when the babies pulled her head out of the fence, now feeling bad that she has to move away. In the end, it's revealed that the promotion was instead given to Charlotte's assistant, Jonathan, meaning that Angelica isn't going to move away after all. Originally, this was to be the Series Finale, but because reruns of _Rugrats_ were performing well in the ratings, Nickelodeon renewed the series for six more seasons.
