... is how you get it to stay so silky smooth.

_"Oh gross, he's gonna touch me with his hair!"_

Sometimes people have a hairdo so big it seems like it has a mind of its own, and moves of its own accord. And then there are the people who have the ability to _make_ it move. Characters with superpowers that allow their mullets to become murderous. To allow their afros to attack. To allow their plaits to pummel. To allow their pigtails to pick fights. To allow their braids to barrage. To allow their dreads to decapitate. To allow their fringes to— okay, you get the idea.

Depending on the Writer, this can act as a Swiss-Army Superpower, and its strength ranges from forming a whiplash or picking up a spare weapon, to allowing characters to form extra arms, mallets, chainsaws, and throwing around boulders with a flick of their fronds. Depending on how it's used, Required Secondary Powers are necessary if the hair can support more weight than the wielder's scalp and neck.

A subtrope of Artistic License – Biology, as hair is, by definition, a filamentous outgrowth of _dead_ cells from the skin. However, there are acceptable justifications such as Functional Magic, Bizarre Alien Biology, etc. Can fall under Bizarre Alien Limbs.

Compare Expressive Hair, which is when a coif is more inclined to telegraph emotions than to strangle random passersby — although there can be considerable overlap between the two. Even when this type of animate hair isn't in motion, it tends to look like its inanimate cousin Messy Hair.

-   _Skittles_: "Share the Rainbow" features a man in a job interview who possesses a long prehensile beard. He uses it to pick skittles off a table and place them in his mouth and the mouth of his interviewer.

    Anime & Manga 

Examples by author:

-   Junji Ito:
    -   In the _Junji Ito Kyoufu Manga Collection_ story "The Long Hair in the Attic", the main character, Chiemi, is decapitated, and her head is discovered in the attic, moving around with the hair. However, it turns out that Chiemi's truly dead- it's _the hair_ that's alive, and it killed her for trying to cut it off.
    -   _Uzumaki_ takes this to a level that must be seen to be believed. In one of the few cases where _hair_ qualifies as Body Horror, Kirie's hair once grew long and fought any attempts to get rid of it or the spiral, and it _strangled_ her if she didn't do what it wanted, draining her life the more it grew.

Examples by work:

-   Empress Gehenna in the Korean manga _Aflame Inferno_ uses her magical hair as whips, blades, shield, etc.
-   In _Alien Nine_ the anime, Kasumi develops this when she gets eaten by the Yellow Knife alien; earlier in the series, when Yuri freaks out as she's attacked by three classmates possessed by the aliens clamped on their heads, her borg turns into Prehensile Hair and starts killing all the aliens in the room.
-   _Assassination Classroom_: Itona has prehensile hair literally made of Combat Tentacles; the same kind Koro-sensei has. He loses the tentacles later on.
-   Mino Nenki from _Basilisk_ can control hair as if it were his limbs, allowing him to do everything from wielding multiple weaponry with hair bundles to skewering victims with pointed strands.
-   _Betrayal Knows My Name_: Ashley has long hair that she can use to attack or grab people with.
-   Eve from _Black Cat_ uses her Shapeshifting abilities to use her hair as a weapon. Mostly she turns it into hammers, but it has also become spikes, fists, blades, porcupine quills, and a bell like the ones used in boxing matches.
    -   Naturally, this carries over into her expy Yami in _To Love Ru_.
-   Halbet from _Black Clover_ is a vain mage who uses Hair Magic that grows her hair to be prehensile and shaped into bladed weapons.
-   _Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo_: Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo — although that's _nose hair_ in his case. Also chest, leg, armpit, and head hair in the case of Bobobo's relatives (one type of hair for each). This comes from his ability to communicate with hair, which is only shown in a flashback in the first episode with his afro telling him that he's some kind of freak for being able to talk to hair.
-   Minatsuki "Hummingbird" Takami from _Deadman Wonderland_ has this as her Branch of Sin power.
-   In _D.Gray-Man_ the characters Jasdero and Devit are twins, in which if they sing their song and shoot each other (seriously), they turn into one entity that has an unbelievable amount of hair reaching his full height, which he'll often use to stab.
-   _Duel Masters_ has Mikuni—later named "Johnny Coolburns" in the dub—is able to flail his ponytail when he gets worked up enough.
    
    **Shobu**: And I thought I had hair issues!
    
-   _Fairy Tail_:
    -   Flare Corona can not only extend her hair to ridiculous lengths and block most forms of magic but also transform it into a wolf or set it on fire.
    -   Vivaldus Taka from Trinity Raven can also use his long hair to attack, as well as absorb water attacks with it.
-   Menou Sakura (and later, Kage Houshi) from _Flame of Recca_.
-   Inami from _Fushigi Yuugi: Genbu Kaiden_ has this power and, to an extent, Tomo from the original series.
-   Kitaro from _GeGeGe no Kitarō_ has prehensile yokai hair.
-   Played for laughs in the second episode of _GUN×SWORD_ which has a group of people with prehensile mustaches which they use for combat.
-   Korikakumon of _Digimon Frontier_ has six braids of hair, all of which are tipped with arrowheads. They have been used to both stab and ensnare enemies.
-   _Bio-Booster Armor Guyver_ features noble Zoalord antagonist Waferdanos; normally already pretty hairy, he can extend his mane and beard into _several football fields worth_ of hair, which is not only prehensile but can form giant, armor-piercing drills. It is later revealed he is a sapient plant - or rather, an entire species of plant beings folded up into a single humanoid form, and the hairs are actually plant fibers.
-   A one-off female character in _The Hating Girl_ has prehensile _nose hair_ that grows when she lies. She uses it to ensnare Ryouji in order to ravish him and does the same to Asumi when Asumi tries to stop her.
-   Alucard's hair is able to do this in both the manga and the anime versions of _Hellsing_. Although it's kinda difficult to tell where the guy's hair ends and where his shadow... things begin. But he definitely has more prehensile body parts than any creature has the right to have.
-   Shows up in _Humanity Has Declined_. It's a side effect of the hair growth formula. In this case, the hair is acting on its own, but it is loyal to the person it's attached to.
-   Palm Siberia from _Hunter × Hunter_ is an expy of Yukako Yamagishi below, except rather than using her hair as a weapon she's able to use it as durable armor.
-   A minor villain from the beginning of _Inuyasha_, Yura, has the ability to animate people like puppets and cut things using Prehensile Hair. Unlike most examples of this trope, Yura could actually add the hair of her victims to her Prehensile Hair, which she kept as a giant hairball rather than it being connected directly to her head. This was because Yura herself was not a person, but actually a demonic comb.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   Bruford from _Phantom Blood_ has the ability to control his hair. Apparently, he had this ability _even before_ he became a zombie.
    -   In _Stardust Crusaders_, DIO gains the ability to shoot strands of his hair into people's brains. The hair then turns into parasites called Flesh Buds, which control the infected victim into being a servant for DIO without thinking.
    -   Yukako Yamagishi from _Diamond is Unbreakable_ has the Stand, Love Deluxe, which allows Yukako to control her hair. Unlike many examples of this trope, she is shown to be able to control her hair even when it _isn't_ attached to her head.
-   One of the many, many, many skills that Kogarashi the Maid Guy in _Kamen no Maid Guy_ possesses. "Maid Guy Hair Sensor" also doubles as Razor Floss and... other things. Yes, it's that kind of series.
-   The Holy Woman from Minoru Murao's _Knights_ manga, whose hair (even her eyelashes, in an Omake) can grow to prodigious lengths to snare, entangle, and immobilize foes even over hundreds of feet, whipping and snaking everywhere on its own accord as she remains still. Once she has disabled the enemy thus, she can slice them to kibble with her razor-sharp strands.
-   Miyabi of _Koi Koi 7_. As she demonstrates in the series, the many uses of her hair include a cutter, an umbrella, and a _Popeye_\-esque fist. She also has a limited degree of shapeshifting abilities.
-   α (Alpha) from _Lapis Re:LiGHTs_ is a Magitek Robot Maid with multifunctional hair. It is capable of growing and moving at will while holding objects, can be used to slice open tough materials like pineapple skins, and can turn into a drill for making sparks to start a campfire.
-   One of the characters from _The Law of Ueki_ sequel, _Law of Ueki Plus_ fights using hair strengthened by hair gel.
-   Akane from _Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro_ is an extreme example since she is nothing but hair.
-   Heuller from _March Story_ can freely control the hair that makes up her wig. In a flashback, she demonstrated just how deadly this ability can be when the person is significantly pissed.
-   Protagonist Oto of _Milk Crown_ is always drawn with one lock of hair sticking up slightly. In an omake in volume 4 of Milk Crown H Jin has a nightmare in which he asks her about it, and Oto reveals that she can control that lock of hair with her mind. She then proceeds to demonstrate this by picking up a duster with it and starting to dust the ceiling.
-   The star of _Miimu Iro Iro Yume no Tabi_ is Miimu, a little white head on legs. She's without arms but with a lot of pink hair that she manipulates into the shape of arms whenever she has need for it.
-   Lala demonstrates this in Chapter 60 of _Monster Musume_. After her head is accidentally stuck in her luggage when the group goes to the Lamia country (implied to be somewhere in Greece), it winds up in Italy. In the last panel of the chapter, her head is seen sitting on a table in an Italian cafe, using a strand of her hair to hold a coffee cup.
-   _My Hero Academia_:
    -   Nagamasa Mora can freely manipulate the growth and movement of his hair. Handily for a user of this trope, he resembles a cross between Cousin Itt and Chewbacca.
    -   Ibara Shiozaki might count for this trope, or perhaps a hybrid of this and Green Thumb, assuming you can count the cluster of thorny vines that grow out of her head as "hair". She can manipulate them in pretty much all the same ways as Nagamasa Mora, though Shiozaki can still manipulate hers even after they are separated from her.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Jiraiya has this ability. Also, he can form his spiked hair into a shield.
    -   Post-timeskip Choji has a similar ability to a lesser extent, being able to lengthen his hair and harden it to make spikes, which he uses to make his Human Boulder ability more powerful.
    -   A villain from a _Shippuden_ Filler arc could do this — it turns out that she is a demonic head of hair controlling a body.
    -   Princess Kaguya Otsutsuki has this among her Super Power Lottery. She can make them solid to block attacks, seize or swat away people, and even fire thousands of them to strike PressurePoints.
-   One of the slime sisters in _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ uses this to latch onto Setsuna and drag her into a water portal after distracting her by pretending to be a naked Konoka.
-   _Ninja Resurrection_ features a misguided Messiah reincarnated as Satan, who looks like a naked, insanely giggling Sephiroth clone who resurrects famous samurai as his undead minions, and flies around killing people with his razor-sharp, uber-prehensile hair, which even features prominently in his gory birth scene.
-   Kejourou from _Nura: Rise of the Yokai Clan_ uses her hair to attack and bind enemy Youkai, usually to allow Kubinashi to finish them off.
-   _Nurse Hitomi's Monster Infirmary_: Class 2-D teacher Kaminaga has nerves inside her hair, so she can never cut it. She often uses it to grope Hitomi.
-   Nyarko from _Nyaruko: Crawling with Love!_ has a lesser version; her Idiot Hair hasn't demonstrated the ability to pick up or otherwise manipulate objects (not that that stops the hentai artists), but she _has_ used it to Dope Slap someone and it can form into complex shapes like kanji. As the Moe Anthropomorphism version of Nyarlathotep, the hair is acting as a stand-in for a tentacle.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   Kumadori's hair wasn't merely prehensile, it could be formed into actual hands and used as part of a martial arts move that let him poke people with the force of a bullet. Using multiple hair hands.
    -   Sandersonia of the Gorgon Sisters can make snakes out of her hair, Medusa-style. Her younger sister, Marigold, is able to combine this with Infernal Retaliation.
    -   Kaido pulls of an odd example during Anime Filler. During his battle with Kozuki Oden, he utilized his Mustache to entangle Oden<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and toss him into a mountainside.
-   The Monster Devil Long Hair in _One-Punch Man_ who became a monster because he took care of his hair to an obsessive degree. It is also his Achilles' Heel, as if it is cut he is defeated.
-   _Pretty Cure_:
    -   Poisonny in _Futari wa Pretty Cure_. It backfires when the heroines fire their Marble Screw channeled by her hair.
    -   Anacondy in _Yes! Pretty Cure 5_. Her hair turns into snakes and she uses them to petrify her enemies.
    -   Sasorina in _HeartCatch Pretty Cure!_. The end of her extendable braid is like a scorpion sting. And it's toxic.
-   One of Pretty Sammy's less useful powers in the _Magical Girl Pretty Sammy_ continuity. With it, she can perform such heroic deeds as reading while eating, and scratching her own back.
-   _Ranma ½_: When afflicted with the curse of the Dragon's Whisker (which makes mens' hair grow uncontrollably until they lose it completely,) Ranma fought Genma and Happôsai by tying his meters-long hair around cinderblocks, truck tires, park benches, and other such blunt instruments, to swing as giant flails.
-   _Sailor Moon_:
    -   Queen Beryl in the manga.
    -   In the anime, Kaolinite, Mistress 9, and a replica of Queen Nehellenia show this power, but not Queen Beryl.
    -   There was also an anime villain who ensnared the girls in her Prehensile Hair, preventing them from fighting her. It turns out that Makoto really is the most talented, though not that way: her Mid-Season Upgrade is _exactly_ what is needed to save the day.
    -   Sailor Aluminium Siren has this power in the manga and uses it to strangle Mercury and Jupiter to death.
-   Berenike, one of Abel's warriors on _Saint Seiya: The Legend of the Crimson Youth_, uses this ability as his main offensive method, with the plus of being able to launch a burning wave through the filaments.
-   While not actually hair, the title character of _Squid Girl_ has highly prehensile tentacles growing out of her head, which look quite a bit like hair.
-   Shaula Gorgon's braid in _Soul Eater Not!_ works a lot like Sasorina's above, mainly because of the shared Scary Scorpions motif. She can't extend it, unlike Sasorina, but it's long enough to serve as a close-quarters weapon, garotte, and stinger.
-   _Symphogear_: Shirabe Tsukiyomi's Symphogear evokes this by armor plating her Girlish Pigtails and converting them into extendable robot arms that wield massive buzzsaws.
-   Niche of _Tegami Bachi: Letter Bee_ can fight and grab onto things with her hair (although only a heart bullet can finish off an armor bug). Her older twin sister can use her hair to considerably greater effect, and can even turn it into weapons like a giant bow.
-   From _Toriko_, we have Sunny of the Four Heavenly Kings. He has a massive case of multicolored hair, each color with a purpose (white to detect pain, green for pressure, pink for heat, and blue for coldness). Aside from the standard use, he can manipulate the tiniest strands to enter the bodies of people and enemies and control or paralyze them, catch and push back attacks and later upgrades them by coating them in Appetite Energy, resulting in pure golden hair which can devour anything they touch and vomit it back. The manga goes as far as explaining two major weaknesses of this power: first, each hair is incredibly sensible, so that for Sunny, cutting a single strand is as painful as having a tooth removed with no anesthetic. Secondly, as pointed out by the Master Swordsman Guemon, his efforts to control all his hair at the same time take too much focus and weaken his potential. After Guemon teaches him to apply "instinct" to his hair, Sunny's powers skyrocket considerably.
-   In _Tsukihime_, Tohno Akiha's hair turns crimson red when she is excited (generally a bad sign). However, her method of attack (_Origami_, or "Imprisoning Hair") is not so much using her actual hair, but spiritual extensions that attack at the speed of thought. Invisible to Normals (including herself), the red strands can skewer straight through a human being, or ensnare and hold them in midair - at maximum output, she can encage whole buildings. She may or may not have used her hair to climb along the side of a building. The Origami also serves as a medium for her other ability: lethal absorption of heat (or Life Energy; the line blurs).
    -   Ironically, Medusa is featured in _Fate/stay night_, and her hair is completely normal except for color and length.
-   In _Umi Monogatari_, two Monsters of the Week have this, using their hair to tie up and strangle Kojima. They nearly kill him before being defeated.
-   The Three Sisters ensnares its victims with its hair in the first _Vampire Hunter D_ novel and movie.
-   In _Wedding Peach_ Nocturne of the Night has this power, as does Cloud.
-   Masane, Reina, and Nora from the _Witchblade_ anime all had prehensile hair that they used as a weapon. Also, Maria. In one of the funniest scenes Masane also used it for _mechanical target lock_. In the test fight she wasn't deft enough with her battle form yet and the bot barely dodged her once, so she used her hair to grab it and then to propel herself toward it.
-   _YuYu Hakusho_:
    -   Elder Toguro can freely manipulate any part of his body, including his hair. While he never tries killing people with it on screen, his powers would certainly allow him to, extending it to wrap up and strangle people, turning the tips of his hairs into razor-sharp blades to impale victims, using it to engulf and crush helpless enemies, etc.
    -   In the Dark Tournament saga, Kurama wields his Rose Whip with his hair in order to beat Gama despite being immobilized by invisible 300lb weights on his arms and legs.

-   Cebolinha/Jimmy Five from _Monica's Gang_ has only five spiky strands of hair, which apparently are sharp as wire (injures people, pops balloons and balls, and once, when the hair was overtly big, his dirty/aquaphobic best friend used some plastic to turn it into an umbrella).

-   _Baifa Monu Zhuan_ is the origin of the white hair witch seen in many Wuxia films. Such is her popularity among Kung Fu fans, movies like _The Forbidden Kingdom_ expect the viewer to already know her name (Lian Nichang) and tragic Woman Scorned history.
-   _Captain Underpants_: _Captain Underpants and the Wrath of the Wicked Wedgie Woman._ has the Wedgie Woman, whose prehensile hair is used — you guessed it — to give wedgies. The In-Universe comic book by George and Harold had it depicted as a singular robot tentacle, but a hypnosis mishap involving getting their teacher Ms. Ribble to reverse their failing grades led to her thinking she's the titular supervillain and she ends up getting her hair powers after some "Super Power Juice" got into her beehive.
-   _Chronicles of the Kencyrath_: In the short story "Hearts of Woven Shadow" Rawneth's hair is descended this way. It starts out with a subtle example—"Her long, black hair stirred and rose about her as if in an updraft, although the room was close and still."—and gets more obvert—"Her braid tumbled down and swung wide, darting, probing, as if with a mind of its own. When she stopped in a swirl of stars, it coiled around her neck." In the scene in one of the later novels based on that short story, her hair does not behave that way.
-   Cthulhu Mythos: "Medusa's Coil", a story ghostwritten by H. P. Lovecraft for Zealia Bishop, Marceline Bedard's lengthy hair turns out to be an indestructible separate entity.

-   In _Grimm_ a Blutbad used her hair to break the necks of the episode's villains.
-   From _Les Guignols de l'Info_, many gags are milked out of Bernadette Chirac's hairdo. Most extreme parodies include giving her prehensile hair with a mind of their own.
-   _Super Sentai_:
    -   Dora Raiger in _Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger_ (and her _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_ counterpart Madame Woe) uses her long braided hair to wrap up and throw people.
    -   Though not exactly prehensile, a minor villain in _Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger_ has a secret technique that lets him whip his ponytail around and teleport anyone and anything it touches into a Death Trap miles away.
    -   In the _Power Rangers S.P.D._ version, Bridge is actually knocked out and dragged to said deathtrap, and the hair attack actually _disintegrates victims outright._ It's especially notable because you'd expect it to be the other way around.
-   In _Young Hercules_, Stregna has a long ponytail that functions like a whip or tentacle.
-   _Intergalactic_: Genevieve, one of the prisoners, has a device she hides in her dreadlocks which sprouts hair like this which can be used to attack people with very long tendrils.

    Myths & Religion 

-   The _futakuchi-onna_ (two-mouthed woman) of Japanese myth is a seemingly anorexic woman with an extra mouth on the back of her head that eats twice as much. Her hair supposedly acts in the manner described in order to put food in the extra mouth, either as a parasitic force or as an aid to the woman because she is being starved by a miserly husband.

    Roleplay 

-   In _The Mad Scientist Wars_, Jane Narbon had invented a "hair symbiote" that gives her this ability. How it gets the necessary leverage and tensile strength to lift people and swing objects is unexplained.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   In the _Forgotten Realms_ setting, the Seven Sisters use hair in melee and for delicate manipulations (e.g. in _Silverfall_). Not _too_ impressive, as they're so stuffed with magic that tend to spray silver fire whenever seriously wounded... and were born as semidivine beings to begin with.
    -   3rd Edition supplement _Creature Collection_. The Storm Hag can use her hair to grab and strangle multiple opponents at one time.
-   In _Feng Shui_, prehensile hair is a good excuse for a Ghost to have the Tentacles power, as mentioned above in "Film."
-   The Wu-Keng of _Mage: The Ascension_ can acquire a demonic gift that makes their hair prehensile. Given the Wu-Keng were inspired by the same Wuxia material as _Pathfinder_'s White-Haired Witch, this isn't surprising.
-   _Pathfinder_:
    -   The _Ultimate Magic_ sourcebook includes the Prehensile Hair hex, which allows a Witch to animate her hair as a limb, and the Strangling Hair spell, which does Exactly What It Says on the Tin. With the hex, it includes notes that the caster can elongate their hair specifically to facilitate its usage. Also, male witches can use it on their beards and moustaches.
    -   The _Dragon Empires Primer_ added a White-Haired Witch archetype based on several characters from Wuxia. Someone at Paizo must _really_ love this trope.
    -   The "Classical Monsters" mini-bestiary includes mention of an Ogre tribe, the Shaggras, whose rampant inbreeding has resulted in them developing thick, matted coats of prehensile body hair, which in-game gives them the Improved Grab feat and damage reduction against non-piercing physical attacks, as the fur lashes out to wrap hold of victims or incoming strikes.

    Video Games 

-   _Alien Challenge_: Nic-San and Claus are two fighters in this game who can manipulate their hair to varying degrees. Though in the case of the latter, he uses his long beard instead.
-   _Azure Striker Gunvolt 2_: One of the bosses, Desna, has the Septima "Splitting Ends", that allows her to create hair constructs, including blades, drills, hands, and a _giant rotator fan_. Most of her stage is entangled in her hair, some of which even serves as platforms.
-   _ARMS_: While most fighters have titular ARMS in place of their, well, arms, Twintelle instead has ARMS in her hair, and uses her pigtails to fight.
-   _Bayonetta_, from _Devil May Cry_ creator Hideki Kamiya, features a protagonist whose special moves are pulled off with help from her hair. Also, her hair composes her _entire freaking outfit_. Needless to say, the more powerful special move she uses, the more hair she needs (like using it to make a spider several stories tall), and the more skin we see.
    -   Subverted that it's not the hair moving by itself - she's summoning demons by using her hair as a conduit.
-   The indie platformer game, _Beard Blade_, have you playing as a knight who kicks ass using his _beard_. Which is ridiculously tough, can form into fists, and be used as a flail against enemies. Further power-ups allows you to turn your beard into swords or maces. Yes, really.
-   Lionwhyte in _Brütal Legend_ has a ridiculously over-the-top hairdo that can transform into a pair of wings, allowing him to fly.
-   Clair in _Distorted Travesty 3_ uses her own hair as effectively as a whip starting with Castlevania segment, then on through the rest of the game.
-   _Donkey Kong Country_
    -   Dixie Kong from the _Donkey Kong Country_ games can use her ponytail as a whip and a helicopter. She can also lift and throw barrels and even cannonballs with it.
    -   Her younger/older sister Tiny Kong from _Donkey Kong 64_ can use her pigtails to punch enemies and glide, though she doesn't seem to be able to lift objects with her hair the way Dixie does.
-   In _Eternal Fighter Zero_, Akane Satomura uses her long hair as her primary weapon, forming it into whips, drills, and swords.
-   The latest raid boss from Patch 3.3 of _Final Fantasy XIV_, Calofisteri, turns her hair into blades.
-   This is Lilac's main form of attack in _Freedom Planet_, whipping her two strands of hair. She can also form them into a wheel to roll around or spin like a top.
-   _Glam_: Glam can use her hair to grab on shrubbery growing on the bottoms of Floating Platforms, and swing back and forth. This can be used to cross large gaps between the platforms.
-   Millia Rage of _Guilty Gear_ has this in spades, able to move and shape her hair however she pleases. Forming it into various stabbing implements is just the tip of the iceberg.
-   The main character from _Kabuki Quantum Fighter_ uses his hair as his primary weapon. He also uses guns, shurikens, and other projectile weapons, but they're not quite as cool.
-   In the NES pirate game _Kart Fighter_, Princess Peach has a hair attack.
-   _The King of Fighters_: Kula's crouching HP has her attacking with her (sometimes icy) hair.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   Midna of _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_. Because she also doubles as Link's Exposition Fairy for the game, she mostly uses it to grab hold of switches, open doors, and point threateningly at objects just before she blasts them with magical power. It even takes the shape of a hand.
    -   Midna also appears in _Hyrule Warriors_, where a number of her attacks involve using her hair as a giant fist.
-   King Long Sauvage from _Little King's Story_ has a prehensile beard that reaches all the way down the mountain from where he sits. And he can electrify it.
-   Kanako Hosokawa, from _Maria Watches Over Us_, appears in the doujin Fighting Game _Maribato!_ as a playable character. Kanako is able to use her long hair as a weapon, and most of her moveset is based on Millia Rage. She also throws basketballs in battle.
-   In _Mega Man Battle Network_, one of Roll.EXE's attacks is using the pigtail-like cords on her head to whip enemies.
-   In addition to his Sinister Scythe, Prometheus from _Mega Man ZX_ can attack players by planting his hair into the ground and then attempt to _stab them with the strands from underneath_, he can even protrude them _from the walls too_, as seen here.
-   _Mortal Kombat_: This is one of Sindel's signature powers along with her Super-Scream. One of her Fatalities has her use her hair to wrap up the opposing character, and then spin them so fast they explode into bloody chunks.
-   In _La-Mulana_, the area 8 boss, Tiamat, uses her hair flying outwards in eight directions as one of her attacks.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   Gourgeist from _Pokémon X and Y_ has hair that act as its hands.
    -   Alolan Dugtrio from _Pokémon Sun and Moon_ has gold hair that it can use to ensnare its opponents. It even has Tangling Hair as an ability, which slows down enemies that hit it with a contact move.
    -   Grimmsnarl and to a lesser extent, his pre-evolution Morgrem, introduced in _Sword and Shield_. One of their Secret Arts, False Surrender, involves the user pretending to bow before stabbing its opponent with its hair. Grimmsnarl's entries go into more detail: his hairs act as muscle fibres to enhance his muscles, with which he can overpower a Machamp.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  They can also latch onto opponents to ensnare them, though he doesn't have Tangling Hair as an ability, unlike the aforementioned Alolan Dugtrio. His Gigantamax form has hair covering almost the entirety of his body.
    -   Morgrem and Grimmsnarl's Distaff Counterparts, Hattrem and Hatterene, have something similar. Hattrem uses her hair as a set of legs and as a means of beating up anyone that bears strong emotion, whereas Hatterene uses her hair as a sort of shell with a tentacle made of hair serving as a means of tearing apart anyone that sets her off. Like Grimmsnarl, Hatterene's Gigantamax form has her body completely covered in hair.
-   _Rayman_ has two strands of hair (originally three) that he can spin like a propeller to fly.
-   _Rocky Rodent_, where the main character was a Funny Animal of some sort with a mohawk that could slice and be thrown as a boomerang. Various powerups gave you different hairstyles with different powers.
-   _Romancing SaGa_: Schirach's magic emanates from her hair.
-   _Rumble Pack_: Tsukiko can throw or whip her opponents with her hair. The whipping attacks count because the hair moves by itself.
-   _Shantae_: Shantae's primary method of attack is whipping enemies with her hair, with various hair care products such as cremes and shampoos serving as upgrades to this ability. Strangely enough, despite being half-genie, _Shantae and the Pirate's Curse_ implies that she actually inherited this trait from her _human father_.
-   _Skullgirls_: Filia has a hair parasite, named Samson, who acts as this for her. Attacks include Samson's appendages turning into spikes, utensils, teeth, or Samson himself taking control over Filia's mobility to turn into different beasts momentarily to deliver some powerful attacks.
-   _Singular Stone_: Miku attacks enemies by impaling them with her hardened hair. Her attack range is the shortest from all characters, but has fast attack rate and damages all enemies in its reach.
-   _Tales of Xillia_: Muzét uses her hair for extremely quick and painful melee attacks when she's not busy nuking the party with elemental magic. In the sequel, where she's playable, her "weapon" is a _hairpin_.

-   _Xenogears_: Emerelda Kasim often reshapes her hair to use in melee combat. Granted, she does this because she is entirely composed of nanomachines, and uses other parts of her body as well, but she does seem to favor the hair.

    -   Ring-Ring is very prone to attacking people with her magically stretching blue hair.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Drowtales_, Ariel has this thanks to her extensive shapeshifting abilities. This ability has always been subtle and subconscious on her part - until she learns to do it deliberately and snags Kalki with it to compensate for her lost arm, allowing her to land an awesomely vicious punch.
-   K'Thonya from the webcomic _Earthsong_ has the power to control metal with her mind. Since her race's hair contains traces of metal, she can manipulate her hair, as well. Her race is said to have inspired the myth of Gorgons on Earth.
-   Miss Futakuchi, the history teacher in _Eerie Cuties_. An incarnation of the Japanese myth in the Myths & Religion section.
-   Grace in _El Goonish Shive_. Though not the hair — any greater chimera has (often furred) antennae, which in her case look much like thick locks. When she morphs them away, her hair is quite inert.
    -   Susan checks her spellbook hoping for a spell that will allow her to control her hair with her mind.
    -   Several characters, most notably Susan, are referred to at various times as having "badass-hair-in-the-wind-with-no-wind" effects, and in one out-of-canon strip, there are apparently "hair fairies" who can cause such effects (as well as put ridiculous hairstyles on anyone who doubts their existence/powers).
-   In _Everyday Heroes_, Carrie Pelosi has hair that reflects her moods. (This is not the same as Compressed Hair.) She can also use it to wield a Hyperspace Mallet, or get someone's attention.
-   In the webcomic _Flaky Pastry_, Zintiel's hair has this property even when no longer attached.

-   _unOrdinary_: Keesh, one of the criminals X-Ray fought, has the ability to grow her hair and manipulate it like extra appendages.
-   Murrey's mullet in _Wonder Weenies_ can be used to pick things up or can be formed into various blunt instruments.
-   Mistress Stress from _Yamara_ has her Stress' Sunblocking Hairy Cantrip. Repeated use has some... side effects.

    Western Animation 

-   _Ben 10_:
    -   In the original series, minor recurring villain Frightwig (of the Circus Freaks) has prehensile hair with metal weights at the end of each "tentacle" which she uses to bludgeon opponents.
    -   In the _Ben 10: Omniverse_ episode "Breakpoint", we discover that this is the primary ability of Mole-Stache. It turns out to be ridiculously strong, able to serve as a parachute, Helicopter Hair, punch Fistrick several feet, and _lift a truck_ overhead. "Awesome 'stache", indeed.
-   _Centaurworld_: Zulius's trademark spell is "Shapely Hair", which allows him to reshape his mane however he likes, whether to use as a third hand or just for showing off.
-   _Central Park_: Molly's superhero persona Fista-Puffs can turn her pigtails into hands that can punch and pick up things.

-   Golden Locks and her evil alter-ego Hair Razor on _The Fairly OddParents!_.
-   In _Gargoyles_, Lord Oberon of The Fair Folk, being a shapeshifting Physical God, can do this with his hair. When he's also the size of Godzilla, it can get kinda scary.
-   _Get Blake!_: In "Get Hairy!", one of the effects of the hair growth formula is to give Blake and Mitch prehensile facial hair (at least temporarily) which beats up the Squalliens.
-   _Gravity Falls_: "Well, first I hootenannied up a biomechanical brain wave generator, and then I learned to operate a stick-shift with my beard!".
-   Freddy Folicle from _Grossology_, who is covered in prehensile body hair from a biochemistry accident. There's some exposition that his hair strands are smoother than natural hair, and they react to electrical impulses like a muscle. Unlike most examples, and keeping in theme with the show, having such long and thick hair leaves him very oily and rather smelly.
-   On _Harvey Street Kids_ and _Harvey Girls Forever!_, Audrey is depicted as being able to shape her center pigtail into a functioning arm.
-   One episode of _Justice League Unlimited_ features a version of the Royal Flush Gang that included a Ten with this power.

-   Entraptra, a minor villain from _She-Ra: Princess of Power_ has two long braids of hair which she can use to entrap her opponents. However, since she isn't much of a combatant, this ability is generally treated as secondary to her engineering skills.
    -   Renamed Entrapta, she reappears in _She-Ra and the Princesses of Power_ with even greater hair control powers, to the point of her pigtails serving as extra hands and/or feet when she is not using them as a chair (and often when she is).
-   _The Simpsons_: The Dumbledore parody Lord Greystash may or may not canonically have this ability. However, it is at least plausible enough for Homer to ad-lib an ending where Greystash, rather than die at the hands of the series' villain as scripted, shouts "MUSTACHE POWER -- ACTIVATE!" and beats him to a pulp with his mustache.
-   Stripperella's hair can be used as a parachute.
-   Metalhead, a Silver Age\-styled superhero in _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)_, has prehensile metal hair. Not to be confused with the Evil Knockoff robot turtle from the original series.

-   In _Wakfu_ season 1 episode 4, princess Ydalipe can do that with her enormous head of hair (and beard, and mustache...) as a result of a curse from the god Osamodas. She initially lures Sadlygrove into her cursed castle in a spoof of Rapunzel's story.
-   _Wander over Yonder_ has Dr. Screwball Jones, a floating banana with a mustache that he uses as arms.
-   Elastika from _Zevo-3_. She can even _fly_ by using strands of hair as a propeller.

    Real Life 

-   Yes, there was actually somebody in Real Life that could reportedly do this. 19th-century French actor Pierre Messie was allegedly able to make his hair stand, fall, and curl. He could even make one side of his hair go up and the other side stay flat. Just how he could do such a thing is unknown, but given that hair is _dead_ tissue without muscles, chicanery seems likely.
