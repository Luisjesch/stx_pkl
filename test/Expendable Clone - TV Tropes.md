_"If I die, I can be replaced."_

The tendency of characters to treat clones and other Doppelgangers as expendable, often to the point of killing them casually because they can be replaced with reserves, or, in cases where there is an original version of the entity, it's the only one that 'matters'.

Occasionally, both clone and original will have a deep-seated loathing akin to There Can Be Only One. May be justified if the clones are naturally Empty Shells or soulless and psychotic. This is often a justification for using a Clone Army.

Compare What Measure Is a Mook?, Uniqueness Value and What Measure Is a Non-Human?. Related to Ambiguous Clone Ending, Cloning Gambit, Tomato in the Mirror and Evil Knockoff. Expendable Alternate Universe is when alternate _realities_ similar to your own are given this treatment.

Sub-Trope of Our Clones Are Different. Given how impossible chemically assembling a single amoeba would be, anyone willing to devote the _astronomical_ funds and resources needed to create clones using ordinary science would consider them anything ''but'' expendable. Of course, Applied Phlebotinum can make clones much cheaper and therefore easier to throw around.

Contrast Clones Are People, Too. Please add all aversions/inversions there.
