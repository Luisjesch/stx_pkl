**Will:** There's no such thing as getting used to what you experienced. It bothers me a lot. I worry about nightmares too.  
**Abigail:** So killing somebody, even if you have to do it... it feels that bad?  
**Will:** _\[beat\]_ It's the ugliest thing in the world.

During an important part of the story, our hero, or just the character in focus, kills someone or something. This death could be popping his murder cherry, or it could just be one of the first kills he thinks is wrong. Even if it was self-defense and completely justified, he still feels guilt-ridden. He looks down in a My God, What Have I Done? moment, shocked at his hands because they just became accomplices in taking a life. Often this leads to a Heroic BSoD particularly if the hero is especially moral or idealistic. The act itself is usually part of a Batman Grabs a Gun situation with the hero breaking a solemn vow that he swore never to break.

"These hands have killed! I've got blood on my hands, and I'll never be the same again..."

Could be followed by Scrubbing Off the Trauma, but it doesn't have to be. May be accompanied with Bloody Hallucinations of Guilt if they begin to hallucinate blood on their hands. This has nothing to do with washing one's hands of blood, metaphorically or literally — only with acknowledging the shedding. In some cases, murder isn't even required to invoke this trope; a sufficiently broken or driven mad character may gaze upon their hands in this way.

This is a Sub-Trope to My God, What Have I Done? — the character in question experiences that guilt while staring horrified at his hands. If this trope is in a character's backstory, it's Sympathetic Murder Backstory. Compare Bleed 'Em and Weep, where the character literally cries after taking life/shedding blood. If a character is contemplating their hands for an entirely different reason, usually drug-related, then see Contemplating Your Hands. If the character thinks what he has done is inherently wrong, he may become The Atoner. If he ultimately decides it was necessary, he may decide I Did What I Had to Do and, in darker settings, start his path down Gaining the Will to Kill.

As a Death Trope, expect the possibility of unmarked spoilers.

At the time, she thought that she metaphorically killed her siblings by breaking the vase; but the burglars probably would have been unimpressed by the offering anyway, and she eventually decides that she should stop blaming herself for their deaths.

-   _Full Metal Panic!_: Invoked very hypocritically by Leonard Testarossa, when he tries to drive a wedge between Kaname and Sousuke by pointing out that the latter has killed over 100 people during his time as a Child Soldier. Leonard has actually caused many more deaths, but since they were indirect deaths (such as ordering his subordinates to kill someone), he acts like they don't count when stacked against Sousuke's active killings. This nonetheless cuts Sousuke pretty deep—not because of the tally, but because he realizes in hindsight that a fair chunk of his kills (prisoners of war or soldiers _hors de combat_ executed as a precautionary measure) probably constitute war crimes and that he hasn't made the greatest progress trying to atone for them.
-   _Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple_ has a "These hands _could_ kill" variation.

Kokin then tells Kenichi that, whether he likes it or not, his hands have become weapons capable of killing, and the realization that "the power to protect your loved ones" is no different from "the power to kill your enemies" makes him afraid that he may commit Accidental Murder the next time he fights an opponent.

    **Kenshin:** This one's wife. Himura Tomoe, who was killed by these two hands.
    
-   _Sailor Moon_: While she hadn't killed anyone at that point yet, during the S season, Haruka/Sailor Uranus looks at her hands and laments that they will become dirty after she and Neptune collect the Talismans from Eudial since the only way to get the Talismans is to rip them out of the hosts Pure Heart Crystals. Which makes it doubly ironic when it turns out the Talismans are inside her and Michiru's/Sailor Neptune's bodies the entire time.
-   _Spider-Man (Manga)_: Yu Komori's "Great Responsibility" moment comes not from the death of his uncle, but from the guilt of accidentally killing Electro while trying to collect the bounty on him, driving him to become a "real" hero.
-   _Sword Art Online_: Shino Asada, AKA Sinon has her character arc centered around this. At age eleven, she was in the middle of a robbery at a post office and trying to protect her mother, she jumped on the robber and caused him to drop his gun, then in the middle of the struggle, she ended up shooting him to death.

Along the way, she gets ambushed by a giant acid rain mutant monster. Pinned down and unable to run, she busts out her trusty revolver and unloads into the monster, after which her hands tremble violently and her breathing stagnates. This is especially traumatic considering not only that Sakura had previously been played up as a Friend to All Living Things, but this is the most violent thing that _any rendition of Sakura_ had ever done, or ever would do again (barring the rest of the chapter / OVA).
    -   Also Clone!Syaoran when he realized that he had just killed Clone!Sakura.
-   _Unlimited Fafnir_: Yuu finds out that his sister Mitsuki was forced to kill a fellow student after she turned into a dragon against her will.

Fortunately, he stops her from having to do that, while also helping them to defeat the dragon attacking the school and coming for Iris.
-   _Vagabond_: Miyamoto Musashi, likely experiencing PTSD in the aftermath of his bloody attempts to become a famous swordsman, spends some time living with a peasant family. The peasants see him as a kindly big brother figure to the children, and at one point someone tells him that he shouldn't be so sad all the time, and he deserves happiness. Musashi responds by saying something along the lines of "How can I deserve to be happy when these hands have killed over 100 men?" The scene serves to show the difference between the younger Musashi, (who was a Glory Hound that never had a second thought about killing his opponents) and the Warrior Poet he is growing into, who is haunted by the blood he has spilled and the recognition that everyone he has killed had a family and loved ones.

-   In _Origin Story_, Alex Harris has this reaction after she kidnaps and kills Henry Peter Gyrich. Surprisingly, this isn't the first time she's killed someone.

The death of Gyrich, on the other hand, was simple premeditated murder. Alex thought it necessary to protect Louise, but it still wasn't like the others: they were fighting back, if ineffectively. Gyrich, on the other hand, never had a chance.

He's still accused of murder; ostensibly because Saico-Tek's inhumanity is irrelevant to the fact that he was just extrajudicially killed, but actually because the police officer making the accusation is the real Big Bad and sicced Saico-Tek (a mindless construct) on Robin expressly to frame him.

He then scoffs, "I don't see what the big deal is."

But it's revealed in 1666 that the Goode family have been letting the Devil possess selected people and go on killing sprees in exchange for wealth and power for centuries; Tommy Slater, the supposed Camp Nightwing Killer, was Nick's first sacrifice. The blood really was on his hands.

-   Inverted in _The NeverEnding Story_, where the Rock Biter is unable to keep his friends from being pulled away into the Nothing. He sits, staring down at his massive stone limbs, and says slowly, "They look like big, strong hands, don't they?"
-   In _Return of the Jedi_, Luke has an instance of this, though it's because he cut through Darth Vader's prosthetic arm in anger, has his own, and grasps what he's doing.

-   _Studio 666_: After being exorsised (kinda), Dave Grohl stares down at his hands in horror once he finds out what he did to the rest of The Foo Fighters while possessed.

    Literature 

-   This is the immediate thought process of Jonah Wizard from _The 39 Clues_ after he shoots a Vesper at point-blank range. He's especially traumatized because up until this point, barring the Clue hunt a few years earlier, he's lived the sheltered, luxurious life of a teenage pop star and hasn't yet come to terms with all the violence that the conflict entails.
-   _The Bible_:
    -   Pilate washes his hands to get the figurative blood of Jesus off of them. History lesson: it doesn't work. (The blood of the thousands of _other_ miscellaneous threats to Rome he crucified, of course, are presumed to have come off easily.) Pilate's act was actually something of a Roman tradition, indicating that the official responsible for an act was not acting for himself, but rather in his official capacity. In other words, he wasn't trying to "wash his hands" of the Crucifixion, but rather saying (more or less): "_I_ didn't do what just happened. That was the Roman State." Unfortunately for Pilate, very few non-Romans in that time and place understood the concept of separating the office from the person; it was quite the Roman concept, which didn't really translate for the mostly Jewish and Hellenistic Greek early Christians.
    -   This was the very reason God instructed Solomon to build the Temple instead of his father, David, who has killed and was no longer as innocent and pure as he should be.

-   _Death Star_ has one of the gunners manning the superlaser go through a full-on nervous breakdown after the destruction of Alderaan.

-   _The Divine Cities_:
    -   The source of Mulaghesh's trauma is having killed innocents when she first started out as a soldier after being ordered to by her superior officer and not having questioned it. Her regrets over these actions define her later years as depicted in _City of Blades_.
    -   Sigrud has killed so many, and regrets his actions so much, that by the third book, _City of Miracles_, he has himself become a Death Seeker.
-   In _Freckles_, one villain objects to killing Freckles because he does not want this trope. They could have prevented him from seeing anything.
-   _In Desert And Wilderness_ has Staś kill the kidnappers during his last attempt to escape from them. He's not proud of this.
-   In _Inheritance_, the final book of _Inheritance Cycle_, after Eragon heals the baby Hope, he says that his hands are too bloody for that type of work.

Luckily, she is rescued not long after.
-   In the sixth book of _The Saga of Darren Shan_, Darren participates in his first real battle. He kills an enemy for the first time — and when he realizes what he's done, his tone dramatically changes. Before, he had been eager to catch the "bad guys", shame them, _get_ them, and make sure there are no survivors. The other vampires live in that mode, and Darren rode alone with their wave. But when he sees this dead person, dead at his own hands, he realizes how wrong it is. He realizes that no one ever even asked why members of the enemy clan were in Vampire Mountain, they just ran in for the kill. He realizes that everything he's been taught so far might be wrong...
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_:

    -   King Stannis plays the trope straight when he dreams of his brother Renly's assassination by dark magic, carried out by a shadow assassin created from his Life Energy.
-   _The Stormlight Archive_: Aladar, who's a veteran of Alethkar's Decadent Court and has the cynical mindset to prove it, invokes this trope when grudgingly joining forces with the heroes.
    
    **Aladar:** You realise that I'm stained through and through. I've got blood on these hands, Dalinar. I'm not some perfect, honourable knight as you seem to want to pretend.  
    **Dalinar:** I know you're not. I'm not either. We will have to do.
    
-   _Tempest (2011)_: In _Tempest Rising_, Tempest kills Malu in self-defense by stabbing him in the stomach with a shell fragment. She's disgusted and horrified by what she's done, even though it was necessary. In later books, she becomes more comfortable with killing.
-   _There Is No Epic Loot Here, Only Puns_: Delta didn't intend to kill anyone, but she did send out her goblins on resource gathering missions without instructing them about what to do if they encounter humans — with the result that they rob a farmer, who chases them into the Dungeon and gets himself killed by them in self-defense.

When Rootspring is given control again, he doesn't remember the fight, but he shivers uneasily at the taste of blood in his mouth and the realization that his claws have killed a cat. He gets over it pretty quickly, though: shortly afterward, he thinks about how his paws defeated one of the strongest Dark Forest warriors and is eager to see more of what they're capable of.
-   In _Wyrd Sisters_, the Macbeth Expy Lord Felmet has blood-red hands from the night he murders King Verence until the night he dies. However, the fact that he uses progressively harsher methods to remove the blood (including sandpaper and a metal file) implies that maybe the reason it doesn't come off is that the blood is coming from an actual wound rather than karma. He eventually moves up to using a _cheese grater_ after a book-long's worth of Sanity Slippage, with the result never being explicitly described except that it's 'not quite a hand anymore'. This actually leads to his Karmic Death, as, due to him being in a delirium from believing he's dead and a ghost (his Sanity Slippage _really_ kicked into overdrive by the third act) he wanders out onto the battlements during a dramatic thunderstorm, arguing with Death himself over whether or not he's actually dead, and pointing out that is he isn't, why can he see him? Death simply responds that he's 'waiting' before Felment ends up slipping off the battlements in the rain and unable to catch himself due to his damaged hand, falling to his death and becoming a ghost for real.

-   In _The 100_, Clarke stares at her bloody hands and cries after killing Finn.

In "Elegy for a Pig", Malloy's narrative brings up the subject again with an officer he knew and the first time he killed a perp on duty.
-   _Babylon 5_:
    -   From the episode "Knives":
    -   In "The Long Night", it is not Londo, but the innocent and unlikely hero Vir who kills the insane Emperor Cartagia.

Londo assures him that it was necessary and that the fact that he is feeling so troubled over it shows that he is a good person, which Londo envies.
-   _Bad Education_: Alfie when he believes that he pushed Pickwell to suicide, emphasized when he spills red ink on his hands. It turns out that she didn't actually kill herself, but rather faked her death and personally blamed many people that so she could laugh at their guilt.
-   _Barry_:
    -   While Barry is a hardened combat veteran turned hardened hitman, his old buddy Chris is neither (Chris was in logistics in the Marines). He breaks down in episode 1-7 after having to kill one of the Bolivians (and makes the fatal mistake of telling Barry about it). He tells them he was stunned and horrified at what he'd done, and decides to turn himself into the police. Barry stops him.
    -   Subverted: Barry tells a story in class of the first person he killed in Afghanistan. He tells them he felt remorseful (while looking guilty and uncomfortable), and the classmate acting out his story drops to his knees in horror in overly dramatic fashion. In reality, his fellow marines were deeply impressed at his shooting skills and congratulate him, leaving Barry with an almost childishly giddy expression, in the moment clearly having disconnected from the reality of having actually killed someone.
-   In the _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_ episode "Collaborators":
    
    **Tom Zarek:** They have a jury, but they don't get lawyers. They don't get to showboat for weeks and months on end. They don't get to blame the system.

In the great twilight between the long night of the occupation and the dawn of a new era, you come into office clean, without their blood on your hands.

    -   In the _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ episode "Enemies", after Faith stabs a demon to death in a frenzy, she later shows Angel her bloody hands. Subverted when it's revealed that she's trying to gain his sympathy so she can seduce Angel and turn him evil.

    -   In the season 5 _Buffy_ episode "Weight of the World", when the line between Ben and Glory starts to blur, Ben remembers all the people Glory killed as if it were him doing it. He stares at his hands and asks where the blood is, saying he can still feel it.

-   Midway through the third season of _Chuck_, Chuck himself briefly has a moment like this after he shoots Shaw.

-   In _CSI: Miami_, when Horatio has to clear his name, he invokes this trope; the blood in question is the real killer's (he punched him in the face), which proves he was at the scene.
-   In the _Dick Turpin_ episode "The Impostor"
    
    **Swiftnick:** Happened? What happened to you? What happened to Dick Turpin? Shall I tell you? He's a memory! I believed in him. A lot of us did. Because he meant freedom and a chance to hit back at injustice, to struggle from the mire! But he's a memory. And you, you stand there in his place. With my uncle's blood on your hands!

-   The Norwegian miniseries _Hanging by a Thread_ has the main character assisting an illegal abortion. When the fetus comes out, she quickly wraps it up in a newspaper and shoves the whole thing into a burning stove. Cue this trope immediately afterwards, as she, visibly shaken, looks at her hands.
-   In _Hannibal_, Will Graham consults on FBI cases by using his heightened empathy to trace serial killer motives and actions. However, that doesn't make it any easier when he's forced to gun down serial killer Garrett Jacob Hobbs in order to stop Hobbs cutting his daughter's throat; the act of acting lethally to save a life still sets him on a path where he finds it easier to look into the minds of killers because he can't cope with his actions. The increasing decay of his mental and emotional state is often discussed throughout the show:
    
    **Will:** There's no such thing as getting used to what you experienced. It bothers me a lot. I worry about nightmares too.  
    **Abigail:** So killing somebody, even if you have to do it... it feels that bad?  
    **Will:** _\[Beat\]_ It's the ugliest thing in the world.

-   _Leverage_: Referenced by Eliot Spencer when he tries to warn Nate that If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him!.

-   _Monk_: Mr. Monk Meets the Godfather, who was chopping up fish at the time.
    
    **Salvatore Lucarelli:** _\[shrugs, chuckling\]_ I have blood on my hands.
    
-   In _Pretty Little Liars_, Emily fatally stabs Nate. Even though he was going to kill her and her girlfriend Paige, and _did_ kill her previous girlfriend Maya, she is deeply shaken by it and even needs a Cool-Down Hug. Later in the season, she admits to still being haunted by it, and everyone saying that what she did was really brave is just making things worse.

Although the man he killed in her place was an Asshole Victim, he still struggles with the guilt of 'accidentally inadvertently manslaughtering' someone. It doesn't help matters that Emerson calls him a killer to his face.

-   "These hands have killed men" is said twice in the Promethean's speech on the back cover of the _Promethean: The Created_ core book. However, the speech is written such that it could be read in a resigned tone - she's long since inured herself to that fact.

    Theater

    Webcomics

-   _How to be a Werewolf_: Heavily downplayed (the victim's injuries, impressive-though-concealable scars aside, were rather superficial and he received far less psychological damage than his attacker) but very much invoked in an early flashback; with young Malaya staring at her blood-covered fingertips... fingertips that became claws moments earlier when her baby brother clocked her with a block and she lost her temper.
