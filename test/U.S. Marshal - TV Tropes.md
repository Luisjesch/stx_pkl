In most countries, a marshal is a high-ranking (or _the_ highest-ranking) military officer. A _United States_ Marshal, however, is a federal law enforcement officer, charged with apprehending fugitives from federal law, protecting the federal courts and ensuring the smooth function of the court system.

The United States Marshals Service was the first federal law enforcement agency created in the young U.S.A., in 1789. While its primary duty was to the judicial system, the Service also acted as the local-level representative of federal laws. For example, the Marshals took the census every ten years until 1870.

Marshals have the ability to deputize ordinary citizens (but not military personnel) at need, popularly known as "forming a posse." In films and television, many marshals' deputies are clueless, which will inevitably exasperate the marshal when he finds out. Sturgeon's Law strongly suggests that this happened in Real Life as well.

Since a marshal is directly responsible to the federal government, they're not as likely to be influenced by local politics as The Sheriff or a police chief. That said, many U.S. marshals have also been sheriffs or town marshals before or after their federal service.

Note that the difference between something like the FBI and the US Marshals is that the marshals are expected to go off into the wilderness, usually alone, take into custody and bring back to justice whoever they are sent after. It pretty much requires that you be a total badass. So while an FBI agent might or might not be a badass, a US Marshal always is - even if he looks like a nerd. Big duties assigned to the Marshals Service today include Witness Protection and prisoner transport across state lines; that said, a surprising number of them spend most of their time doing pretty mundane work like doing security at federal courthouses (manning the scanners that sprouted at the courthouse entryways after 9/11) and serving court papers and enforcing judgments on litigants in federal cases (if somebody sues you in federal court, and wins, and you refuse to just cut a check despite having plenty of stuff, it's a US Marshal who will be seizing your car or your house or your prize fancy cat to pay the judgment; if you don't have a lot of stuff but do have a steady income, it'll be the Marshals who arrange the garnishment).<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  They are not, however, the Air Marshals assigned to flights to counter hijackings, which is a separate service entirely.

-   _Pacific Rim_: The use of the word "Marshal" for the higher-ups in the Pan Pacific Defense Corps (and the use of the word "Ranger" for the Jaeger pilots) was done both to evoke Westerns and because director Guillermo del Toro is a pacifist who wanted to avoid giving the organization a militarized vibe.
-   Stockburn of the Clint Eastwood Western film _Pale Rider_ is a corrupt, villainous variant.
-   In _Primal_, a team of U.S. Marshals are sent to escort Richard Loffler back to the U.S. to stand trial. None of them survive the assignment.

    Podcasts 

-   _Sparks Nevada, Marshal on Mars_ from the _Thrilling Adventure Hour_ is another Space Western version assigned to a whole planet.

    Radio 

-   Matt Dillon of Dodge City in _Gunsmoke_ — who described himself in the radio episodes as "the first man they look for, and the last they wanna meet. It's a chancy job, and it makes a man watchful - and a little lonely."
-   James Whipple of _Lightning Jim_ and his deputy marshal Whitey Larsson.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _BattleTech_ has the Colonial Marshals, which are based on the US Marshal system: independent lawmen answerable to the New Colony Region's federal government, usually serving as a mixture of pirate hunter and wandering judge, as they were required to memorize the laws they upheld and also empowered to make binding rulings. They also had to be qualified Mechwarriors, in order to be assigned one of the eponymous Marshal Battlemechs for the purposes of kicking around pirates and ensuring people respected the Marshal's authority.
-   _Blue Planet_: The GEO Marshals on Poseidon act similarly to the US Marshals. They are the leaders of GEO law enforcement, and each one of them is a certified badass.
-   U.S. Marshal is an option for player characters (detailed in the _Law Dogs_ source book) in _Deadlands_.

    Video Games 

-   Marshal Johnson in _Red Dead Redemption_. His actual role in the plot is that of The Sheriff of Armadillo, and he doesn't act much like a real U.S. Marshal would. At one point he even says that he can't do anything about early game Big Bad Williamson because he commits his crimes in the next county over. This is despite real Marshals having jurisdiction over the entire state or territory they're deployed in. Presumably the game designers confused him with the "town marshal" who only has jurisdiction in one locality.
-   _Alien: Isolation_: The "Colonial Marshals" in charge of law-enforcement on Sevastopol Station appear to be an offshoot of the Trope Namer, suggesting that at least someone in Congress realizes that there are certain things Weyland\-Yutani and their competitors should _not_ be entrusted with.

    Visual Novels
