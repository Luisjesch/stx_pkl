_"Blade with whom I have lived, blade with whom I now die.  
Serve right and justice one last time.  
Seek one last heart of evil, still one last life of pain.  
Cut well, old friend, and then... farewell."_

The medieval knight who fights baddies, whether villains, knights or dragons, and in The Tourney, charms ladies without deliberately seducing them, behaves honorably, and saves the day with his sword; but also, any hero who behaves similarly. Invariably Lawful Good and honor bound. First appeared in the Chivalric Romance. He has a very high incidence of having a Bodyguard Crush and Rescue Romance.

Historical knights were first and foremost professional soldiers. They usually were of Blue Blood — or, if commoner-born, founders of a new noble family. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Their _modus operandi_ was lance-armed heavy cavalry, which charged the enemy in full gallop on closed ranks. They often were used dismounted as well, when they fought as heavy infantry, usually armed with enormous can-openers such as poleaxes or two-handed swords. A knight might also lead a group of common footsoldiers in battle.

A cultural trope in Europe since The Middle Ages, most good knights practice something called chivalry, Honor, and Self-Control and occasionally chastity. Prone to rescuing the Damsel in Distress, or delivering her from false accusations, often whilst bearing The Lady's Favour. The Knight in Shining Armor was a frequent carrier of The Dulcinea Effect: medieval Chivalric Romances, indeed, portrayed knights who fell in love with a _princesse lointaine_ merely on hearing her described, without even seeing her - though his love and heroism usually won her heart. Another occupational hazard is Chronic Hero Syndrome, Knights Errant being charged to Walk the Earth righting wrongs until a worthy quest shows up. Oh, and he will Save the Princess, usually from dragons.

This is often invoked to describe a man who acts _chivalrously_ toward women. The term may be used in more cynical works to indicate a Wide-Eyed Idealist. Even the Ur-Example of the straight usage of trope, Arthurian Legend, messed around with it a lot. The one-two punch of Disney and _Dungeons & Dragons_ saw this trope's stock rise like crazy.

The "shining" originally referred to the way his armor and weapons were kept in good condition, as opposed to the rust that accumulated for less competent knights. Most knights will be depicted wearing plate armor, despite it appearing relatively late in the era of knights.

When Prince Charming is a Knight in Shining Armor he's the Warrior Prince. Prince Charmless, on the other hand would not be a knight by choice.

See Lord Error-Prone and Miles Gloriosus for common variations, played with tropes, and parodies and Knight in Sour Armor for what happens when the world fails to live up to _their_ standards, but they keep on being good anyway. If the knight is _too_ dedicated to his ideals and code, he may become a Knight Templar. If he likes fighting a bit _too_ much, he is in danger of becoming a Blood Knight. A knight who is shiny for one person in particular is The Champion. A knight that gets magical powers as a reward for this goodness is almost certainly The Paladin to boot.

If the Knight in Shining Armor wanders the land seeking evil to slay, then he's also a Knight Errant.

Animated Armor will appear as this, all the way to The Reveal.

Subtrope to Ideal Hero. Compare the gentleman's Old-School Chivalry. Compare and contrast the Dogged Nice Guy. A white knight is an internet persona who wants to be this.

An Officer and a Gentleman is the modern version of this trope — _very_ often even their direct genetic descendants as old noble families are _grossly_ over-represented in all military academies around the world. With the notable exception of the United States, of course. Compare Samurai, which usually tends to be the Japanese equivalent of this trope.

**Before adding examples, remember that—despite the name—this trope doesn't necessarily have anything to do with a character's armor or its color. A well-behaved knight in black armor or even no armor could still qualify, and a character who just wears shiny armor without behaving in a heroic manner is not an example.**

    Advertising 

-   Fruit of the Loom wants you to meet the knights (who wear nothing but fruit costumes) who will give new shirts to people.

    Art 

-   The propaganda painting "Der Bannerträger" ("The Standard Bearer"; painted c. 1935; first exhibited in 1937) by Hubert Lanzinger shows Adolf Hitler as a knight in (literally) shining armor on horseback, his right hand holding the billowing swastika flag of the Nazi Party / the Third Reich. The image was frequently reproduced in Nazi Germany, including as a postcard.

    Card Games 

-   In _Magic: The Gathering_, this is generally White's shtick. Though depending on the setting, it might range from anything from classical heroic knights to insidious fanatics and other deconstructions.

"I treat every foe according to the highest codes of conduct. Then I kill them."

-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_:
    -   By day Ghostrick Dullahan masquerades as a suit of antique armor, but at night he shows his true colors as a veteran knight, acting as a leader figure for the other residents of the museum.
    -   Another good example would be Freed the Brave Wanderer (who would later become Freed the Matchless General). His appearance as a Duel Spirit in the anime shows his Heroic Spirit rather plainly.
    -   The Gem-Knights, with the sole exception of Antiluminescent Knight Cairnogorgon. They only got involved in the storyline's battles after repeated attacks.

    Comic Books 

-   Antoine D'Coolette eventually grows into this in _Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)_. He's very chivalrous and proper and an expert swordsman. This culminates in issue 234 where he grapples with Metal Sonic and nearly dies all in the name of service to the king.
-   The Black Knight (Marvel Comics) from _The Avengers_ is a literal one, though the first one was a villain. Black Knight II, however, plays it straight. Both are descended from a lineage of Black Knights that dates back to Arthurian times.
-   Though he may not be called a 'knight', Captain America is as much a pure example of this trope as modern jaded audiences can stand. His classic outfit includes maille or scales on the upper portion, he carries a shield, and a modern Captain owes much to the role of a knight in leading his troops. In behaviour? No more noble or righteous 'knight' exists in the Marvel Universe - Ultimate Cap excepted, of course.
-   Johan, the protagonist of the Belgian comic book series _De Rode Ridder_.
-   In Marvel Comics' outer space stories, the Spaceknights of Galador also aspire to this ideal, but arguably only Rom ever truly achieved it. One story even has Rom encounter the frozen form of King Arthur, still waiting for the day he will reawaken to save Britain from some future calamity, and Rom feels an instant, instinctive kinship with him.
-   _The DCU_:
    -   The titular character from _Steel_ wears a cape and shining armor, wields a weapon, and is as moral and good as Superman himself.
    -   DC Comics also had the Silent Knight, a more traditional knight than the Shining Knight, and his adventures took place at King Arthur's Camelot.
    -   In a post-nuclear war apocalypse, there were the Atomic Knights who were heroic individuals who wore plate armour to protect them from radioactive fallout (though in more contemporary comics, the Atomic Knights are a faction of Powered Armour soldiers).
    -   _Seven Soldiers of Victory_: Shining Knight of the Seven Soldiers of Victory. Sir Justin, a knight of King Arthur, was given by Merlin a suit of magical armor that would protect him from all harm, and a magical sword that would cut through anything. Merlin also gave Justin's horse wings and the ability to fly. Justin was frozen for centuries and revived in the 1940s, where he applies his honor as a knight to fighting crime in the present day. His chronological predecessor/published successor Ystin also qualifies, although they're a bit less idealistic than Justin, coming from a more Low Fantasy version of Camelot.
    -   _Captain Atom_: Captain Atom's daughter Margaret _sees_ him this way. He _eventually_ becomes one.

    Comic Strips 

-   In _Frank and Ernest_, Frank, as a knight, complains of having to dress on a cold morning.
-   In one _Garfield_ comic strip, Jon gets freaked out by a scary part in the movie theater and starts sucking his thumb. Liz sarcastically mutters, "My knight in shining armor", and Garfield replies, "Make that your sissy in double-knit."

    Fan Works 

-   _Child of the Storm_:
    -   Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America epitomises the trope; noble, a superb warrior and deeply honourable, fighting for justice, most especially the protection of the oppressed (because he hates bullies), and pining after/mourning his lady love, he is frequently compared to King Arthur. He's also a Nice Guy who rescues kittens from trees, because of course he does. He is more ruthless than most examples, it has to be said, and has a certain hint of cynicism — plus, unlike most examples, he has a child out of wedlock, with Peggy, Alison Carter - who had children and grandchildren of her own, much to Steve's shock when he finds out. This devastates him, because he feels that it was an ignoble act on his part, before being reminded (repeatedly) that it takes two to tango, Peggy most certainly knew her own mind, and the rightful course is to stop avoiding his great-granddaughter, Carol, who idolised him and was deeply hurt by his rejection, no matter how understandable it was at the time. Nevertheless, it is not in the least bit surprising that he is knighted at the end of the first book, becoming part of the Order of the Garter.
    -   Thor is a noble and charming Warrior Prince, right down to the shining armour. Especially given his increased dutifulness towards Asgard (not necessarily to the throne, however, as he's more than willing to challenge his father), dedication to protecting the small and defenceless, and slaying of monsters - these days, no longer simply for the thrill of the challenge. He's also and an all-round Nice Guy, a good boyfriend and a good dad, being dedicated to both roles - though it should be remembered, as and when his son gets hurt, that he is the God of Thunder and Lightning _not_ Reason and Understanding.
    -   Harry is an interesting variant, being a Decon-Recon Switch.
        -   In the first book, he plays the trope Straight, with his largely idealistic nature, Chronic Hero Syndrome, and The Dulcinea Effect (minus the romance). It doesn't always pan out very well, such as his Bully Hunter antics, compounded by his temper, but he's always going to help, no matter the cost. It's regularly noted that he's far too sweet and kind for his own good, standing out in a jaded and cynical cast, his Power of Trust bringing out better natures in those who didn't even know they had them. Even his darker moments are brief, and his good heart is key in the first book's climax when he's relied upon by arch-schemer Doctor Strange to resist The Final Temptation. For his actions, he is also Knighted as a member of the Order of the Garter.
        -   Near the start of the sequel, in the _Forever Red_ Story Arc, the trope is brutally Deconstructed. His typical leap back into the Red Room for to try and talk Maddie, a Living Weapon and Jean's stolen-at-birth twin sister around ends in disaster: he's right that she's a Tragic Villain and his question makes her think. But a lifetime of ingrained obedience and programming isn't so easily overturned, and instead he spends days being horribly tortured, a mere prelude to a Trauma Conga Line that includes his Blank Slate body being turned into 'the Red Son', used to create an aggressive Russian Empire, and repeatedly raped by Yelena Belova, the Red Room's Black Widow, in her twisted take on the Black Widow/Winter Soldier dynamic. This leaves him on the brink of a Suicidal Cosmic Temper Tantrum, and even after he's talked down, he's left horribly traumatised and deeply bitter.
        -   Yet despite the above, the trope is steadily Reconstructed in appropriately nuanced fashion. He's still dedicated to helping a newly reformed Maddie, he's horrified when confronted by Cedric Diggory about how he's been terrorising his fellow students and he remains a Knight in Sour Armor. As Strange says, he is _still_ the person who will _always_ do what is right rather than what is easy, and it's why he's The Chosen One. The _Bloody Hell_ arc shows him as a shining knight once, rescuing Carol from Dracula (who wants her special blood). He faces Dracula twice (once in a literal suit of armour), and despite being almost crippled and horribly outmatched, he plans ahead, gets help, and (eventually) succeeds, before nearly killing himself to save Carol with an emergency transfusion. All while resisting the temptation to tap into his reality warping Superpowered Evil Side. He vows to become a Knight of Faith, and sealing the transformation, he receives a personal silvery-white suit of Iron Man armour, leading Coulson to codename him 'Agent Galahad'.
-   _Equestria Girls: Friendship Souls_: What Sunset's Bankai turns her into.
    -   Applejack's completed Fullbring covers her in armor save for her head, white cape attached smoothly across the back and shoulder guard, and gives her a giant lance/drill combination.
-   _Greenfire_: Inverted when the knight finds Greenfire and Rarity, it's the knight acting like a murderous bully, and it's the dragon who's attempting diplomacy and defending his lady.
-   _Infinity Train: Knight of the Orange Lily_: Gladion aspires to be this, and he admires the White Knight in being a chivalrous character. Unfortunately, the story deconstructs a lot of things that goes wrong with this, ranging from the training and nights Gladion slept in hotels, the fact that Gladion keeps seeing Lillie as a helpless princess stuck in a tower, or the fact that most of the problems could've been avoided if he told his mother about what happened with Lillie, Nihilego and Type: Null so much sooner.
-   _The King Nobody Wanted_: Ser Clegane... Ser Tytos Clegane, that is. He is an honorable man who cares passionately about helping the innocent, and is deeply resected and admired by his followers..

    Fairy Tales 

-   In Andrew Lang's "The Golden Crab," the king tries to have The Tourney to substitute a bridegroom for the crab his daughter married. Three times the crab-husband shows up in human guise to fight.
-   In "Iron Hans", the prince dresses up in armor to fight on the king's behalf. Then he does the same to catch the princess's golden apple.
-   In "The Princess on the Glass Hill", Boots finds suits of armor with each Cool Horse, and so can ride up the hill as a knight.
-   In "One-Eye, Two-Eyes, Three-Eyes", a knight takes Two-Eyes away from her abusive family and marries her.
-   In Franz Xaver von Schönwerth's "King Goldenlocks", Goldenlocks is given a magic sword, a suit of armor and a horse to fight a war.

    Films — Animation 

-   Disney:
    -   _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_: At the end of the movie, a prince arrived to take Snow White away on his white horse.
    -   _Sleeping Beauty_: The climax is a battle with Prince Philip up against Maleficent (as a giant dragon) to save Princess Aurora, King Stefan, King Hubert, Queen Leah, and the entire kingdom from their slumber.
    -   _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_: Phoebus is more of this than his counterpart in the source material, being less prejudiced and willing to defy orders from a corrupt judge to rescue a family from a burning house. Quasimodo even calls him this when Phoebus doesn't hesitate to go to warn Esmeralda and the other Romani that Frollo is coming.
    -   _Tangled_ has Flynn Rider gallantly racing on the white Maximus over the bridge to rescue lost princess Rapunzel, which is not only a visual shout-out to this trope, but symbolic of his Character Development from a selfish, thieving rogue to something closer to this trope.
-   _Doraemon: Nobita and the Knights on Dinosaurs_ have the Knights of Enriru, troodon-men warriors bearing shields and lances on their trusty velociraptor steeds. Their leader Banhou is introduced into the story saving the lives of Doraemon and gang while beating off a horde of hostile Naga tribesmen.
-   _Enchanted_ begins with Prince Edward saving Giselle from a troll, resulting in their planning to get married the next day.
-   _The Flight of Dragons_: Sir Orrin Neville-Smythe is a classic example of this; the aged, but steadfast and noble knight dedicated wholly to justice. He gives a badass speech during the final battle; then gets set on fire by Bryagh's flame. He withstands the heat long enough to hurl the now-flaming sword into the heart of the black dragon, then collapses next to his fallen love.
    
    _"Blade with whom I have lived, blade with whom I now die.  
    Serve right and justice one last time.  
    Seek one last heart of evil, still one last life of pain.  
    Cut well, old friend, and then... farewell."_
    
-   _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls_: Flash Sentry. The human version that's the closest thing to a Love Interest for one of the Mane Six has a counterpart in Equestria, it turns out — the pony Flash is a member of the Crystal Empire' royal guard — the only one we've seen who isn't a Crystal Pony. He gets more screentime — well, page time — in the comics.
-   As _Shrek 2_ opens, Prince Charming has adventured, overcoming many obstacles and climbing the high tower in order to rescue Fiona, finding instead a cross-dressing wolf. It turns out that there was an old promise that Charming would be able to marry Fiona, but Fiona has already married Shrek in the first movie. It's later subverted when he reveals himself to be a snobby, narcissistic, sociopathic jerk.
-   _The Swan Princess_: After Princess Odette is kidnapped, Prince Derek becomes determined to find her. Once he does, he plans to break the spell on her by making a vow of everlasting love.

    Gamebooks 

-   The titular Warrior from _Wizards, Warriors and You_ is brimming with weapons, wears a full suit of plate mail, and is a loyal servant of King Henry, always ready to face whatever challenge threatens the kingdom, the king, Princess Saralinda, and the people. Weirdly, it is noted that he wears no heraldry, and given how he's always referred to as Warrior, he may not even be a knight.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Saint George: In the medieval legend, St. George kills a dragon, thereby saving a virginal princess, and aferwards refuses all material rewards but instead converts the locals to Christianity. Thus St. George the Dragonslayer embodies the ideal knight, as he is both an undaunted warrior and a saint who dedicates his martial prowess to helping the helpless and the promotion of Christianity.
-   Saint James "Matamoros", from the myth of the Battle of Clavijo. He supposedy came down to help save 100 virgins that were given as tribute to the Caliphate.

    Music 

-   The music video for "Holding Out for a Hero" by Bonnie Tyler has one: in this case, a heroic cowboy knight in angelic white armor on a white horse, which is also mentioned in the song. ("Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?")
-   The Faith Hill song "This Kiss"
    
    Cinderella said to Snow White  
    'How does love get so off course?  
    All I wanted was a white knight with a good heart,  
    soft touch, fast horse.'  
    Ride me off into the sunset, baby I'm forever yours.
    
-   The song "Glory of Love" by Peter Cetera:
    
    Just like a knight in shining armor  
    From a long time ago  
    Just in time I will save the day  
    Take you to my castle far away.
    
-   The country song "Suds In The Bucket" by Sara Evans.
    
    When her prince pulled up - a white pickup truck  
    Her folks shoulda seen it comin' - it was only just a matter of time  
    Plenty old enough - and you can't stop love  
    She stuck a note on the screen door - "sorry but I got to go"
    
-   The Taylor Swift song "White Horse" is a subversion, as it features a woman who got heartbroken by a lover who she once believed to be her knight, and realizes that real life is not like the fairytales she thought it was.
    
    I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale  
    I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet  
    Lead her up the stairwell  
    ...Now it's too late for you and your white horse  
    To come around.
    

    Pinballs 

-   Heavily featured in _Golden Logres,_ which has quests for all twelve Knights of the Round Table.
-   The player is cast in this role in the "Knight of the Rose" table of _Last Gladiator_.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   When EMLL became the more internationally diverse CMLL, few of the new luchadors were better received than Steele, the large, powerful, honorable, fair playing knight in his shiny face plate looking mask.
-   Chikara has the time-displaced knight Lance Steel and his more time-displaced self, who also serves as his Tag Team partner. They made it their mission to defeat the gnashgabs and uplift pro wrestling to a new, glorious level, and they wear colorful 'armor'. "Huzzah!"

    Tabletop Games 

-   Chaosium's _Pendragon_ game is based on the stories of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: The paladin class was based on Knight in Shining Armor archetype in general and supposedly _Three Hearts and Three Lions_ in particular. Paladins are more like holy crusaders empowered with divine magic, though (which has its own trope, on that note).
    -   Sturm Brightblade of the _Dragonlance_ D&D saga is the epitome of this trope played straight except for not actually being a knight until shortly before his death. His fellow Knights of Solamnia are not quite so ideal but, with a couple of (important) exceptions, are generally good.
    -   The _Player's Handbook II_ from late in _D&D_ 3rd Edition introduced the knight class, which is a lot like the paladin but without magical abilities. The knight's abilities focus on mounted combat, single combat with an opposing champion, and maintaining honor.
    -   The 1st edition Cavalier class, introduced in that era's _Unearthed Arcana_, was closer to the "standard" Arthurian knight. For a while, the Paladin class was a subclass of the Cavalier instead of the Fighter.
-   Paizo's _Pathfinder_ RPG has brought The Paladin full-circle with the "Shining Knight" archetype, complete with bonuses to mounted combat and riding skill. For those not wanting to add divine elements to it, there's also the Cavalier class.
    -   Ironically, Alain Germande, the Iconic Cavalier, is very much _not_ this, though he does excel at presenting himself this way to aid in seducing impressionable women. He's a Lawful Neutral arrogant Glory Hound Blood Knight who, though surprisingly charismatic, regards all others as expendable tools in pursuit of ever-greater glory and success.
-   TSR's _Knights of Camelot_ game also covered the Arthurian knighthood setting.
-   The _Talisman_ board game provides two examples of this trope, who reflect the chivalric code slightly differently: the Knight character, who is always of good alignment and who cannot attack other characters of good alignment, and the Chivalric Knight, who can aid rival characters in battle and cannot attack another character whose strength value is less than his own.
-   In Wargames Research Group games DBM and DBMM, Knights are the second most formidable troop types after War Elephants. They are fairly confident on running down any mounted troops and most foot, but they are vulnerable to shooting. The Achilles' Heel of Irregular Knights is their impetuosity: unless constantly guarded, they are liable on charging spontaneously the nearest enemy and thus ruining the battle plan.
-   _Warhammer_:
    -   All noble Bretonnians aspire towards becoming true knights in shining armour...though as a whole they also tend to display all of potential abuses and flaws of the system of feudalism as a Deconstructive Parody of the trope. Grail Knights, who have been found pure in heart and soul and blessed by the Lady of the Lake, are said to all qualify for this trope by definition (though the aforementioned skewed sense of morality has some fans wonder if the Grail Knights are really more like their more ordinary fellows).
    -   The Empire also has several noble knightly orders, but their modernization means that the chivalric ideals are not as predominant there as in Bretonnia.
-   The Cyber Knights from _Rifts_ are a post-apocalyptic version of this trope, combining Mad Max aesthetic and advanced tech with traditional chivalric values and discipline. Ironically, their founder Lord Coake was a straight up knight from a fantasy world that was displaced to Earth and created the order for the purpose of fighting evil in all of it's forms. While he fits the trope perfectly, his principles do get him into trouble like the one time he refuse to lend aid to Tolkeen (one of the other main heroic factions of the setting) because they consorted with demons as last resort to resist an enemy siege. This action alienated his knights who went on separate ways and he went to found another knightly order to serve this purpose as the Cyber Knights.

    Web Animation 

-   _RWBY_: Portraits of Nicholas Schnee in the Schnee Manor depict him in knightly armour. The design of the armour can also be seen in the Knight statues that decorate the house, and forms the basis for the Amor Gigas that Weiss defeats in the White Trailer and transforms into her primary summoning aide. Nicholas was noted as being a man of the people, who became wealthy only as a result of his quest to create a better economy and living conditions for the people of Mantle. The men who travelled on dangerous quests to find new Dust mines were led by him and they had a great deal of respect for his willingness to risk his life for others. He only gave up his adventuring lifestyle when it became clear to him just how much his wife and family missed being with him.

    Webcomics 

-   Sir Toby, from _Chivalry and Knavery_. A Christian knight (who happens to be an anthropomorphic lion), who is kind, brave and extremely strong. And patient, otherwise he would have run screaming from Kira and Ulf. According to his character description, he believes that there is good in everyone - amazingly, his time with the two of them hasn't beaten that belief out of him.
-   In _Cucumber Quest_, due to being a work of satire that affectionately pokes fun at video game tropes, this trope is zigzagged.
    -   The knights of Cake Town all wear hodgepodge suits of armor made of random parts, and are just little more than glorified servants for King Croissant and his daughter, Princess Parfait. Because of the king's low standards of knighthood, most of the knights are easily defeated by Peridot during Cordelia's invasion of Cake Town. The rest of them turn traitor while one, Sir Carrot, escapes.
    -   Sir Carrot aspires to be a true knight and behaves according to chivalric traditions, but his crippling cowardice prevents him from acting like he should, to the point of becoming The Load while his much younger friends (Nautilus, Cucumber, and Almond) are much more capable than him. In fact, Sir Carrot's cowardice becomes a point of drama in Chapter 3 where Almond is manipulated into seeing him as a villain by Rosemaster and the others, including himself, lose faith in him. But the Nightmare Knight's intervention, combined with receiving a Love Letter and a love boost from a captive Parfait, causes Sir Carrot to regain his courage and level up permanently - gaining a gleaming, heart-themed suit of armor and a strawberry-shaped heart on his chest that allows him to summon magical weapons from it. And he defeats Rosemaster, too.
-   _Goblins_:
    -   Big-Ears is probably the most good-aligned character in the whole comic. If he were human they'd have named a city after him.
    -   Kore, on the other hand, is a complete inversion though _he_ believes he's the good guy.
-   Sir Muir in _Harkovast_ fits this trope, even if his armour is more battered then shining most of the time!
-   _The Order of the Stick_: All the Sapphire Guards are, but O-Chul even _more_ so. The Giant describes him as "everything right about the paladin". He was already one in all but name in his prequel story, when he was just a regular captain in the army. He is honest and humble, stern but compassionate, courageous in the face of overwhelming odds, but above all else, committed to protecting the lives of _everyone_, human or hobgoblin. In fact, he alone is the main reason that the Sapphire Guard is such a bastion of righteousness. He initially tried to have the Sapphire Guard dismissed due to them being a bunch of elitist nobles more concerned with slaughtering evil than paying attention to the most obvious ramifications of their actions, but when told that wasn't an option, he joined them instead as an Internal Reformist. It worked.
    
    **O-Chul:** A lot of people are going to get hurt tomorrow. All we can do is stand in the way of that and say, "Not them. Me. If you need to hurt someone, hurt me."
    
-   Esten in _Roza_. Even if lacking the armor and resembling a Bounty Hunter.
-   Hong Chunhwa from _Tower of God_, a chivalrous knight who always pays his respects to the ladies.
-   _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!:_ Dame Abby Primrose, with her suit of Powered Armor, is essentially this for the dragon civilization.
-   In _Crimson Knights_ the titular warriors are a cross between this and Hunter of Monsters, being an Order of knights tasked to kill monsters and apprehend misusers of magic.

    Web Original 

-   While several Servants in _Fate/Nuovo Guerra_ come from Arthurian romances or the Matter of France, the best example would probably be Sir Roland. Sir Gawain is a special case: his devotion to Chivalry eventually led to Camelot's downfall, as he refused to call for Lancelot's help for the Battle of Camlann.
-   _Fire Emblem on Forums_: This is the ideal for players of the Paladin class, and indeed many characters exist that live up to it.
    -   _FEF 2_: Miguel aspires to be this despite his old age. Whether he lives up to the trope is....questionable.
    -   _Final Hour_: Lamden is this, though downplayed due to his Chivalrous Pervert tendencies.
    -   _Demon Soul Saga_: The White Knight of Mishima, later revealed to be the Kaijin Gawain, is designed after this aesthetic, but he himself averts this trope. Mori (and a few other characters) take Akihiko to be this trope due to being a Bully Hunter, but he's closer to being a Knight in Sour Armor.
    -   _Mortal Transgressions_: Ferdiad Domniann. His codename is literally _Knight_. This starts to chip away, however, as he is forced to confront the realities of working within Gray-and-Grey Morality, with the stress leading him to temporarily disappear from the party.
-   In _The Gamer's Alliance_, Marcus Sarillius is a virtuous, and occasionally gullible, paladin who is always eager to save damsels in distress and set things right. Osmond Locke and Swenson Von Strupenguard are other notable examples.
-   In _Tales Out of Tallis_ Sir Bastien is trying very hard to be one, though Rien tends to make it extraordinarily difficult for him.
-   Roman from _Sanders Sides_ would very much _like_ to be one, but he has difficulty since, 1) He's simply a facet of Thomas' personality, not an actual human, and, 2) Thomas lives in modern, suburban Florida. He still tries to push Thomas into acting like one from time to time.
    
    **Roman:** _(on finding a romantic partner)_ There's a way to simultaneously make them feel special, _and_ show them how awesome you are.  
    **Thomas:** How?  
    **Roman:** You find out what might be making their life difficult...  
    **Patton:** Yeah?  
    **Roman:** ...And you _kill it_.  
    **Virgil:** What?
    
-   Worm has Gallant, a superhero who explicitly chooses to live by this trope.
    -   Chevalier as well. He's one of the most morally upright characters in the setting, and for bonus points he actually wears shining armor.
-   The title _Knight of Hope_ is naturally this. It's implied he's sent by God Himself to answer woman's prayers to be saved from a camp of bandits, and after slaughtering literally all of them, takes time to return her necklace depicting Saint Michael back to her and show her she's safe now before departing.
-   _7-Second Riddles_: They often show up to save the Princess Classic from their predicament, sometimes by fighting a dragon, other times by solving puzzles.

    Western Animation 

-   The recurring _Adventures of the Gummi Bears_ character Sir Victor, the White Knight, is a classic Knight in Shining Armor. However, it turns out that he is actually the estranged brother of the series' Big Bad, Duke Igthorn, and lives in constant fear that he would turn evil like the rest of his family (before An Aesop is delivered to him, anyway) and rights wrongs as perceived atonement for his house's ill deeds.
-   Sir Roderick from _Gawayn_. It's a shame he also tends to be Lord Error-Prone.
-   Shining Knight of _Justice League Unlimited_. Especially played up in "Patriot Act" where he and a mutated General Ripper do battle while they argue what duty to one's country means.
-   _Mr. Benn_: In the first episode ("Red Knight"), an invitation to a fancy dress party enticed Mr. Benn to seek it out. In a bit of irony, he's not fond of parties, but he loves dressing. There was no party to find anywhere, which eventually lead Mr. Benn to the costume shop at which he would become a regular, and then go on to wear a bright red suit of armor. Rather unusually, Mr. Benn goes on to subvert the typical dragon slaying, instead ending up befriending the dragon he encounters, who goes on to tell Benn about how he was framed for burning buildings by a greedy matchstick maker.
-   In _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_, Twilight Sparkle's big brother is a tall, white stallion named Shining Armor and is Captain of the Canterlot Royal Guard. For bonus points, he even marries a princess in the season 2 finale, though his sister and his bride-to-be Cadance have to save _him_ from the Monster of the Week.
-   Sir Giles in Disney's animated featurette of Kenneth Grahame's "The Reluctant Dragon" chapter of _Dream Days_ both embodies and subverts this trope, in that although he actually _is_ a famous dragon-slaying hero (in Grahame's book actually St. George himself), he is nevertheless willing to fake a combat with the eponymous dragon on learning that he, too, is 'a bit of a bard'.
-   _South Park_: Stan Marsh became a mix of this and the Only Sane Man. And sometimes he himself parodies this trope.
-   Prince Alex from _Super 4_. Despite coming from Kingsland (a medieval location) he doesn't wear a lot of armor, but has the personality to a T.
-   _Steven Universe_ has an entire episode, "Sworn to the Sword", dedicated to a deconstruction of this trope. Pearl trains Connie Maheswaran in swordplay, while also instructing her on the duties of knighthood as being "completely dedicated to a person and a cause", expecting Connie to be dedicated to Steven as Pearl was for Rose Quartz. Unfortunately, Pearl has severe self-esteem issues that she ultimately projects onto Connie, demanding that she be prepared to sacrifice her own well-being for Steven, just as Pearl had done for Rose countless times during the Gem War. Steven, Connie's "liege", is freaked out by the thought of Connie sacrificing her safety and self-worth for his sake and eventually gets through to her and Pearl by proving that it's better to fight together as a team, and gets Pearl to admit that Rose never devalued her and that she was just beating herself up.
-   _Transformers_:
    -   Silverbolt, from _Beast Wars_, is a usually tongue-in-cheek example of this type. He's not a parody so much as a walking Lampshade Hanging, complete with trumpet fanfares when he speaks. It really helps that both his animals — one a wolf, the other an eagle — are typical "noble" animals. (which sorta makes a Griffin, an even more noble animal)
        
        **Blackarachnia:** Oh no. You're not saving my life again? Even after I _shot you_?  
        **Silverbolt:** It's my duty, ma'am, as a Maximal and as a heroic character.
        
    -   Sadly, he also counts as a case of Stupid Good, and in the sequel _Beast Machines_, he gets run through the ringer quite cruelly.
