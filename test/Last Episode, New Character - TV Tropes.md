While most characters are introduced at the beginning of a series or story arc, sometimes somebody doesn't get to show up until the end of the last episode; they may not even get to speak. This can be a not-so-subtle way for the creative team to ask for another season: obviously, the fans will want this character to actually be in some episodes. Or it could be done when the team knows that another season is planned, and they will be able to incorporate this character in the new season. Occasionally, if the series has a larger franchise surrounding it, the character might be from one of these side-materials, whom the writers couldn't fit into the main work but still liked enough to give them at least cameo before ending everything.

If a sequel is not planned, the new character may act as closure via Passing the Torch, more broadly showing the influence the main character(s) had over the course of their adventures, or simply showing that life will go on as usual, especially in the case of settings where characters (major and minor) tend to come and go.

Compare with God Created Canon Foreigner, 11th-Hour Ranger, Early-Bird Cameo under Continuity Cameo.

    Asian Animation 

-   _BoBoiBoy_: The series finale for the original series introduces Captain Kaizo as the new antagonist when it seems that the heroes will be fighting Ejo Jo again, only for him to be swept out quickly by Kaizo. However, he does reappear in the middle of _BoBoiBoy Galaxy_'s first season.
-   _Happy Heroes_: The last episode of Season 1 introduces Careful S. to the team.

    Comic Books 

-   The final issue of _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ Season Eight introduces a new character: a young villain with round sunglasses. Of course Season Nine followed soon after.
-   In the _Charmed (1998)_ comic continuation, the finale hinges on a medium named Amelia Desmots, who only appears in the last three issues. It's also a case of Remember the New Guy?, because she clearly knows the sisters. There was going to be a canon tie-in book explaining how they met her, but it's been put on indefinite hiatus.
-   The final issue of _Flashpoint_ introduces Pandora, with no fanfare or explanation of who she was. It was setup for the New 52.
-   _Spider-Man_, of all heroes, was introduced in the last issue of _Amazing Adult Fantasy_ (re-titled _Amazing Fantasy_).
-   The final issue of _Supreme Power_ introduces Shape, Inertia, and Emil Burbank, who would all become regular characters in the subsequent _Squadron Supreme_ series.
-   The final issue of the DCU version of _The Web_ introduced Fly Girl and War Eagle, who were part of The Mighty Crusaders in their mini series!

    Fan Works 

-   _Metroid: Kamen Rider Generations_: Similar to the last episode of _Kamen Rider Ghost_, Kamen Rider Ex-Aid makes an appearance in the final chapter when he gives Samus and Micchy a hand, fighting a horde of Bugster Viruses. After Emu de-transforms, cue his reaction upon meeting Samus. In fact, the author threw it in.
    
    **Emu:** Are you the real Samus Aran? _The_ Samus Aran from Metroid?  
    **Samus:** You're looking at her.  
    **Emu:** I'm a big fan! I used to play _Super Metroid_ when I was a kid, this what made me becoming a Genius Gamer today.  
    **Samus:** Appreciated.
    
-   In _Necessary to Win_, Oarai's new Student Council is introduced in the last chapter.
-   _Tales of the Undiscovered Swords_ series: Nikkō Ichimonji is teased at the tail end of the first story, but it's not until the next entry that he gets a starring role.
-   _Weight Off Your Shoulder_: The final chapter employs a Time Skip, bringing in Zoe Lee in order to show that she didn't suffer a Karmic Misfire due to being Chloe's half-sister.

    Films - Animated 

-   _Justice League Dark: Apokolips War_ is the Grand Finale of the DCAMU but introduces Wallace West and the many members of the Green Lantern Corps in non-speaking cameos, while King Shark appears for the first time as a secondary character.

    Films - Live-Action 

-   Within the Marvel Cinematic Universe's first Myth Arc, "The Infinity Saga", Carol Danvers only appears for the first time in her titular movie _Captain Marvel_, which is the penultimate movie of the entire slate (eleven years and twenty films) prior to the Grand Finale _Avengers: Endgame_, where she also plays an important part.
-   _Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny_: The Ice Cream Bunny doesn't appear (or even get mentioned) until the climax.
-   A bit of an odd example: although the trailers seem to indicate otherwise, Venom doesn't show up until shortly before the last battle in _Spider-Man 3_, but Eddie Brock and the alien symbiote that make up Venom are both major players in the story as separate entities for most of the film.
-   Although the character is shown throughout the movie, it's not until the last act of _The Dark Knight_ that Harvey Dent becomes Two-Face.
-   _Star Wars_:
    -   General Grievous is introduced in _Revenge of the Sith_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , the final episode of the Prequel trilogy.
    -   _The Rise of Skywalker_, the final episode of the Sequel trilogy as well as the Skywalker saga altogether, introduces Zorii Bliss, Jannah, Babu Frik and D-O.

    Literature 

-   _Animorphs_ does this with The One, the mysterious entity that absorbs Ax and leads the others to the Bolivian Army Ending.
-   _The Shepherd's Crown_, the final _Discworld_ novel, introduces and is partly written from the perspective of an entirely new witch character. Of course, the afterword reveals that it wasn't _intended_ as the final _Discworld_ novel, because Sir Terry simply didn't think that way, and indeed he had plans for even _more_ new characters. Whether he also had plans to revisit this one will sadly never be known.
-   _Dying of the Light_ has Kirak Redsteel. A poet unconnected to any of the main players, he is oft-mentioned but never seen until the last chapter when a white-bearded old man strolls up to muse on some long dead Old Kavalar poetry. And he's even nice enough to arrange duels.
-   The denouement of _The Handmaid's Tale_ takes place as a Distant Finale after every other character has died in one way or another. As a result, the postmortem of Gilead is expressed through an entirely new character, Professor James Piexioto.
-   _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_ introduces several new characters, most of whom had at least been mentioned before due to the series's very liberal use of Chekhov's Gunman:
    -   Albus Dumbledore's sister Ariana is introduced as a Posthumous Character early on without ever having been mentioned before. Downplayed with his brother Aberforth, who’d been mentioned several times directly and indirectly and actually had brief appearances during _Order of the Phoenix_ and _Half-Blood Prince_ but wasn't properly identified until the final book. Harry even notes he looks familiar when he briefly meets him but can’t put his finger on why.
    -   Bathilda Bagshot is mentioned in passing as early as the first book as the author of _Hogwarts: A History_ but appears for the first time midway through the book. She's a major example of One Degree of Separation as a long time resident of the quazi-Wizarding village Godric's Hollow. She's a family friend of the Dumbledores, previous Big Bad Grindelwald's great aunt, and a neighbor of Harry's parents when he was a baby. She's also dead by the time Harry and Hermione "meet" her.
    -   Grindelwald himself is only ever mentioned in the first book on Dumbledore’s chocolate frog card, never to be be mentioned again until this book. He plays a significant role in the Dumbledore backstory b-plot but doesn’t appear in the present until about 2/3 through where he commits Suicide by Cop via Voldemort.
    -   Luna's dad, Xenophillius, is known to own a conspiratorial newspaper but doesn't appear until Bill's wedding at the beginning of this book. He also appears a little later in the story when he tells Harry, Ron, and Hermione about the Deathly Hallows.
    -   Several characters who were born during the nineteen-year Time Skip between the climax and the epilogue.
-   Theo Waitley was introduced into the _Liaden Universe_ in the final chapter of what seemed like the final novel of the series, as part of an And the Adventure Continues ending. After a break of several years, the authors found a new publisher for a couple of novels about Theo, and the series has been going strong ever since.
-   Lampshaded in _Last Term at Malory Towers_, where several new sixth-formers were introduced, and the main characters express surprise in seeing new students coming in so late in the school year.
-   _City of Heavenly Fire_, the last book of _The Mortal Instruments_ introduces Emma Carstairs, hero of the sequel trilogy, _The Dark Artifices_.
-   In Book 40 of _The Railway Series_ (which, then, was Christopher Awdry's final book) the final story features a new engine, who is named "Ivo Hugh" on the last page. Unfortunately, the publishers scuppered the plans to publish any more Railway Series books (they did eventually do two more), meaning that Ivo Hugh hasn't had his personality developed.
-   Professor Moriarty, supposed to be THE nemesis for Sherlock Holmes is introduced only in _The Final Problem_, originally written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as the definitive series ending. Holmes got better, though.
-   In the _Warrior Cats_ series, Dovepaw and Ivypaw are born at the ending of Sunrise (the last book in the third series), with Jayfeather realizing that one of them is the third cat in the prophecy. Both of them are main characters in the fourth series.

    Mythology and Religion 

-   Surtr, the fire giant who is responsible for the end of the world in Norse Mythology, is probably the Ur-Example. He doesn't appear in any myths except the one that tells of Ragnarok, where he and his armies invade Asgard, he kills Freyr and engulfs the world in fire, and even that myth gives him little description or characterization. Still, while he may not appear, he is referred to in numerous other tales of both the _Poetic Edda_ and the _Prose Edda_. Some have suggested that this is because Surtr was a late addition to the mythology inspired by the volcanoes of Iceland. When Iceland converted to Christianity around the year 1000 AD, the only real myth involving Surtr that had time to develop was him being added to the story of Ragnarok.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   The Estonian Thunderfrog, The Latvian Proud Oak and Lithuanian Snow Troll: The Baltic Siege, who originally only had one match in Chikara before it died. However, they played an important role in helping Icarus revive the promotion during the Ashes angle running through Wrestling Is and returned two years later for some more fights.

    Video Games 

-   _Copy Kitty_: In the 12th and final world of Boki's Hard Mode (a continuation of the Normal campaign), during the 3rd stage, the game abruptly cuts to static with two unseen characters tracking her progress and spying on the simulation. The next stage barely has time to load before a character named Isotope suddenly breaks into the simulation to challenge Boki to the most serious encounter in the game and Boki's True Final Boss. The dialogue strongly suggests a future encounter between the two will take place.
-   _Fate/EXTRA_: Most of the game is spent focusing on the Holy Grail War, in which Leo and his Servant Gawain are built up as the most powerful enemies the player has to face. It’s not until the end of the game that the audience is introduced to the hidden mastermind of the tournament, though sharp-eyed players will remember seeing his name mentioned multiple times before: Twice H. Pieceman, and his Servant, Saver.
-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   In _Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon & the Blade of Light_, the final character available, Gotoh, joins in the last chapter. In the remake _Shadow Dragon_, you can either get him as normal or get a different character (Nagi) by completing a secret level right before the final battle.
    -   _Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade_:
        -   The final character available (Athos) doesn't join your party until the final chapter.
        -   For bosses, it's possible to fight the gaiden chapter-exclusive Kishuna in the second-to-last chapter of the game, without having previously encountered him in one's play-through. When this happens, Nils gives the other characters a brief explanation of Kishuna's Anti-Magic seal before the battle; otherwise, he'd use this moment to describe how much more sorrowful Kishuna's aura is, in contrast to the more hostile previous encounters.
    -   In _Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn_, the Laguz Royals become playable in the last part of the game and if the player fulfills the requirements, they can get Sephiran for the final battle.
-   In _Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator_, the last installment of the main _Five Nights at Freddy's_ games, there is one new animatronic called Lefty.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Turns out to be subverted, as Lefty has The Puppet from _FNAF 2_ inside of it.
-   _Grand Chase Dimensional Chaser_ has Lapis (who got her name after being released as a new playable character), who appears at the end of World 9, after Decanee's villainous story arc. After the Grand Chase heads back home after defeating Decanee, the scene changes to Nelia, with Veigas and another demon resembling Dio, only to be interrupted by someone coming in. That person is Lapis, asking "what propositions does she have for her", which is the very last scene in the ending.
-   _Jade Empire_: Death's Hand can be recruited 5/6 of the way through the game if you are a Magnificent Bastard.
-   _The King of Fighters_:
    -   Shingo Yabuki, as well as the Orochi Team (Yashiro, Chris and Shermie) all debuted in _The King of Fighters '97_, the final canonical entry of the Orochi Saga.
    -   Likewise, Ángel, K9999/Krohnen, the original Zero and Igniz made their first appearances in _The King of Fighters 2001_, the end of the NESTS Chronicles.
-   While he's briefly mentioned early on, King Mickey Mouse never actually turns up until the ending sequence of _Kingdom Hearts_. Also, Roxas's first appearances were in The Stingers for _Kingdom Hearts I_ and _Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories_. A similar thing happened with many of the new _Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep_ characters, first appearing in The Stinger for _Kingdom Hearts II_.
-   _The Last of Us Part II_ got the Rattlers, a group of not better described slavers who serve the purpose of being the last bunch of psychos you have to walk over before the end of the game.
-   Valimar from _The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel_ ends up being introduced right before the two final bosses of _Cold Steel I_, complete with a brand new game mechanic introduced to players just for those two boss fights. Valimar fights end up being more prominent from the second game onward.
-   In _Mass Effect 3_, The Catalyst plays this role.
-   Averted with Alia and Signas from _Mega Man X_ - the game they debuted in (_Mega Man X5_) was originally going to be the Grand Finale of the franchise, but the release of _Mega Man X6_ and its sequels caused them to have more appearances than originally intended.
-   In the original _Metal Gear Solid_, Jim Houseman, the Secretary of Defense and the person who authorized Solid Snake's mission, only appears during a CODEC call prior to the game's final boss fight with Liquid Snake.
-   The all-important Madeline Bergman doesn't make her first appearance in _Metroid: Other M_ until right before you've beaten the final boss, and she doesn't tell the player who she is until after the boss is dead. At which point she unloads a whole truckload of new plot exposition and character motivations. This is considered by most to be one of _Other M_'s bigger missteps in the story department.
-   Brave Young Layna shows up in _Soul Nomad & the World Eaters_ for only a few maps (storyline ones at least, not counting the random dungeons) when Revya and co. arrive in Drazil.
-   The final DLC character added to _Street Fighter V_ is Luke, an American MMA fighter that Capcom notes will "play a big role in the future of _Street Fighter_", which was another way of saying he was an Early-Bird Cameo for _Street Fighter 6_.
-   Although calling it the last "episode" is not quite accurate, in _Super Smash Bros. Brawl_'s story mode, The Subspace Emissary, Sonic the Hedgehog makes his first appearance at the last possible second, showing up in the cutscene immediately preceding the final boss.
-   _The World Ends with You_:
    -   The mobile port of the first game adds an extra image after the credits showing a then-unnamed girl (Tsugumi Matsunae) who would ultimately go on to show up in _NEO: The World Ends with You_.
    -   _NEO_ itself has the Angel Hazuki "Haz" Mikagi. He doesn't show up until the game's final day (and then doesn't appear again until The Stinger of Another Day), but he manages to have quite an impact on the plot in spite of this.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Crescendo (JP)_, there's a route that can only be unlocked _after_ all the others have been completed. The girl in said route is the local Delicate and Sickly girl, Miyu Shizuhara, who barely appears in the other paths.
-   The mastermind of the killing game in _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_, the real Junko Enoshima, doesn’t appear in the flesh until the final trial, with the Junko seen beforehand actually being her twin sister Mukuro disguised as her.
-   Dennis's dad and Amy's mom both debut in the final episode of _Double Homework_.
-   The final chapter/episode of _Harvest December_ ends with the introduction of the children of the two main heroines.
-   The very last scene of _Liar Liar 2_ introduces Nao. She is a childhood friend of Yukari's that reveals Yukari has always been Ax-Crazy and has killed everyone she's ever dated _since elementary_.
-   While she is mentioned all the way back in "Turnabout Sisters," Misty Fey does not make a proper appearance until "Bridge to the Turnabout," the final case of _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Trials and Tribulations_, and by extension the final case of the original trilogy.

    -   In Season 3, Weiss' father has a brief cameo, forcing her to return home to Atlas with him, setting up her Volume 4 storyline.
    -   Season 3 also has Salem, the series Big Bad who doesn't make her first physical appearance until the very last scene of the third season.
    -   Season 4's last scene before the credits introduces the headmaster of Haven Academy, Professor Leo Lionheart. Not much of him is shown, but his first onscreen appearance reveals that he's the informant Watts was ordered to meet at the beginning of the volume, and, according to Watts, he's been in league with Salem for a while now.
