_"Did you know dolphins need to be in a pool with other dolphins? It's a law, because they're so social... like us... or me, anyway."_

In most media, especially most fiction, dolphins are portrayed as playful creatures, who will easily befriend humans and like to play around in the water with them.

In real life, the extent of this varies. Tame dolphins are usually trained to be like this, and stories of friendly behaviour by wild dolphins abound and predate dolphin training. However, random wild dolphins are often as hard to predict as a random human stranger, and like any other animal, they can be dangerous. Experts recommend keeping your distance from them.

Sometimes overlaps with Heroic Dolphin, or Sapient Cetaceans, or both. Compare Sweet Seal, Playful Otter, and Warm-Hearted Walrus for other friendly sea mammals.

Contrast with Devious Dolphins.

-   _Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead_: One of the items on the bucket list is to swim with dolphins, which the group manage to do in the "Dolphins of the Dead" arc. They are depicted as playful and friendly, where they have no problem swimming alongside the protagonists. That said, they actively avoid Akira and Shizuka, the dolphins being able to detect the awkward air around the two of them (where Akira and Shizuka are partially avoiding each other due to the latter remembering how he confessed to her while she was delirious). Near the end of the arc, when Akira and Shizuka manage to confess to each other for real, they manage to be saved by the dolphins from the zombies that cornered them on the beach. The group wonder if the dolphins did this intentionally, while Lambda Chop tells them about how there are heroic myths and stories about how they saved people from drowning or shark attacks, though note the dolphins view it as "playing" instead.

Their final message to humanity<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  was misinterpreted as 'a sophisticated attempt to jump through a hoop while whistling The Star-Spangled Banner'.

    Webcomics 

    Web Original 

-   Averted (and combined with a dose of Humans Are the Real Monsters) in _Mortasheen_ by Jonathan Wojcik. The 'Dolfury' monster is said to be a genetic combination of dolphin and human that was deemed 'too violent and cruel' to watch over _human livestock_ by its octopus-vampire creator, who tried and failed to have them exterminated. They're regarded in-universe as one of the few examples of 'true evil' in a setting where Blue-and-Orange Morality is so prevalent that 'evil' as a concept practically doesn't exist anymore. Also, like Wojcik's other example above, they reproduce parasitically.

    Western Animation 

-   Hank Hill meets an _overly_ friendly playful dolphin in an episode of _King of the Hill_.

-   In _Flipper and Lopaka_, Lopaka is Flipper's best friend and they go on many adventures together.
-   _Zoom the White Dolphin_ is about a white dolphin who is friends with two children who live with their sailor uncle.
-   Inverted in one of _The Simpsons_ "Treehouse of Horror XI", where an army of dolphins kill or kick everyone out of Springfield.
-   The _Action Man (2000)_ episode "The Triton Factor" has Action Man befriend an amiable dolphin he names Triton.
-   On _Star Trek: Lower Decks_, the _Cerritos_ has two Beluga whales who otherwise play the trope straight, being friendly towards the rest of the crew and inviting people to swim with them. Preferably naked.

    Real Life 

-   Some scientific explanations of wild dolphin behavior subvert this. For example, male dolphins typically leave the pod when they mature to pursue a solitary life or a life with other males. Sometimes, when males refuse to leave the pod, the females will push the males above the water line and expose them to the sun. Too much sun-exposure can be very uncomfortable for the dolphins, so this convinces the males to swim away. Sometimes, they will do the same thing to humans. Of course, humans aren't threatened by prolonged exposure to the sun, so they think the dolphins are swimming with them, when really the dolphins are trying to drive them away.
-   Dolphins blow bubble rings.
-   There was an Australian surfer who went under the breakers and lost his board, only to be saved by a lone dolphin who not only kept him afloat and guided him towards the shore, but also chased off a shark.
-   Opo the friendly dolphin of Opononi.
-   Tiao started out friendly but eventually (accidentally) killed a swimmer who was harassing him.
-   Fungie the Dingle Dolphin.
-   There are a number of instances of orcas (which are a species of dolphin) behaving friendly and playfully toward humans. One notable example is Keiko, the orca who starred in _Free Willy_. Even after he was released to the wild, he was very friendly toward humans, and even let children ride on his back. Unfortunately, this meant that he failed to fully adapt back to the wild and died at the age of 27.
    -   Despite this, captive orcas can still be dangerous animals if maltreated. Tilikum, for example, has killed three people while in captivity. He is believed to have been severely traumatized by his capture at the age of 1 and by the early years of his captivity, which he never fully recovered from.
        -   Ironically two of these deaths were caused because he wanted to play with humans, but did not know that they were easily breakable and couldn't survive long underwater. The exact circumstances of one of the deaths is unknown, because the victim had covertly stayed in the park after it closed and then snuck past the guards to swim with the orcas. It's also possible that in the first instance he wasn't trying to play, but to defend the two other whales in the tank (who unknown to the trainers were both pregnant).
-   Wild orcas, like other dolphins, do exhibit curiosity and even playfulness towards boats, with behaviors ranging from approaching to seemingly putting on a show of breaching and splashing to bowriding. Unfortunately, one group of orcas in the waters off the Iberian peninsula seems to see boats as a threat and have taken to ramming and disabling them on sight, usually targeting and making off with the boat rudders. Or at least that's how some biologists see this; others surmise that these orcas are engaging in overblown play behavior, thus still technically playing this trope straight—the "playful" part at any rate.
-   Dolphins have at times displayed what is known as "fad" behavior, where one or several individuals will exhibit or do something that serves no real purpose and entire pods will pick up on the trend. Like human fads, it usually gets old and fades away with time. This is particularly seen with wild bottlenose dolphins "tail-walking"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and one group of northern resident orcas "wearing" salmon on their heads or rostrums. The rudder-stealing orcas mentioned above might also be guilty of this but the trend has yet to show any signs of dying down.
-   Bottlenose dolphins have been observed playing with and prodding pufferfish into releasing small amounts of tetrodotoxin <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . The reason? Apparently to get high from it! That's right, dolphins are the sea's answer to potheads.
