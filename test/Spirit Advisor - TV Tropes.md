_"You know the trope?  
In storytelling it's a norm.  
When a person's in trouble  
manifestation of their subconscious appears in the form  
Of a Dream Ghost!  
Giving advice you kind of already knew."_

A character who can only be perceived by one or a small number of other characters. This character's purpose is most often to provide advice, act as a moral compass, or substitute for Mr. Exposition.

If there are two with opposing viewpoints, then you're dealing with Good Angel, Bad Angel instead. Ironically, the Spirit Advisor is rarely The Ghost (even if he is a genuine ghost).

If someone who can't see the Spirit Advisor learns about their existence, they will inevitably try to talk to them, leading the character who can truly see them shaking his head and saying, "He/She's over _there_."

A rough sci-fi equivalent is the Virtual Ghost, though it is usually visible to anyone. Can be the result of ascending to a higher plane of existence.

Compare Helpful Hallucination, who only exists within one's head, thus their entire personality and being are shaped by the person imagining them.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Frozen II_: Iduna watches over and sings with her daughter Elsa in the song _Show Yourself_.
-   _The Lion King_: Mufasa becomes one of the "great kings of the past" and advises his son on the responsibilities of his birthright from beyond the grave. He continues this in _The Lion King II: Simba's Pride_, but that's more of a "deity talking to a Good Shepherd" thing with Rafiki. He does a more blatant version with his grandson in the spin-off series, which is discussed below.
-   In _Ratatouille_, a lonely Remy, desperate for someone to talk to, imagines that the spirit of his hero, Auguste Gusteau, is his spirit advisor. However, Remy is fully aware that Gusteau is a figment of his imagination, and Gusteau eventually disappears for good when Remy finally accepts that he can rely on his own judgment. Played for laughs, too; if Remy ever needs reminding that Gusteau is just a figment of his imagination, Gusteau provides it.

Inverted with Norman and Aggie, as he is a living person trying to help guide a spirit.
-   Littlefoot’s mother in _The Land Before Time_. When he finds his lost tree star leaf, she reminds him of the way to the Great Valley, and later, she leads him through the tunnel to the valley and lets the sun through the clouds to reveal the valley to him.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The Big Lebowski_: This is parodied with Sam Elliot's character. Picture the cheesiest cowboy you can imagine, and make him speak entirely in lines that have little or nothing to do with the rest of the plot and are pretty much Narm (or maybe Narm Charm).
    
    "Sometimes you eat the ear, and sometimes, well... the bar eats you."

-   _Twixt_: Baltimore Hall is guided by the ghost of Edgar Allan Poe in his dreams.

Initially, Pete thinks it's a game and spends as much time trolling people as helping Ted.
-   _The Chronicles of Riddick_: In the extended cut, Riddick is visited several times by the spirit of a dead Furyan named Shirah to remind him of his heritage and his destiny: kill the Lord Marshal of the Necromongers, the man responsible for wiping out their race. She also appears in the opening and ending of _Escape from Butcher Bay_.
-   The premise of the ridiculous Hong Kong comedy film _Where’s Officer Tuba?_ starring Sammo Hung and David Chiang. Chiang used to be Sammo's superior in the force until he gets shot dead by a mob leader, and spends much of the movie being a ghost pestering Hung to avenge his demise. Hung happens to be chasing a promotion and investigating the same mobster responsible for Chiang's demise, resulting in their uneasy alliance. Hilarity Ensues.

-   _Rhymes for Young Ghouls_: Anna appears to be this for Aila (though it may be just her imagination).
-   In _Frankenstein Island_, Sheila Frankenstein is being advised in continuing the family's blasphemous experiments by the spirit of her dead great-grandfather who communicates by using her comatose husband as a medium.

    Literature 

-   _Coiling Dragon_: Doehring Cowart is a 5,000 year old magus who put his soul into the Coiling Dragon. After Linley bonds the ring to himself, he can see and speak to Doehring, whose magical tutoring allows Linley to quickly advance in power. Since he is just a spirit, Doehring is unable to affect the surrounding world, at least not until he sacrifices his existence to free Linley from some assassins' trap.
-   In _Deep Secret,_ Rupert's Mentor Stan is allowed to come back as a ghost in order to advise Rupert, specifically in the task of choosing an apprentice. Although Stan is invisible to most people, the _music_ he listens to is not, leading to a number of people wondering just where that classical music is coming from.
-   _The Divine Comedy_:
    -   Dante is guided through Hell by the spirit of Virgil, the famous Roman poet, who is more than familiar enough with the worldly sins of all those they encounter. It is only once they see the entirety of evil and reach Purgatory that Virgil begins to falter. He still guides Dante up the mountain and teaches him, but since Virgil himself is a denizen of Hell, the continuing importance of the Angels and the growing proximity of God forces him to leave Dante once he is about to enter into Paradise.
    -   Beatrice, the deceased love of Dante's life, takes the Poet through the spheres of Heaven, becoming increasingly more beautiful and jovial as they further approach God. As a Saint leading a fallen mortal, Beatrice guides and teaches Dante like a mother deals with a particularly distressed child. She often knows what Dante wants to ask before he does and she always has an answer that leaves him stunned and better for it.
    -   Saint Bernard takes over as Dante's guides for the last two cantos so that Bernard, on the advise of the Blessed Mother, can help Dante better perceive and experience the true presence of God.
-   _The Dresden Files_:
    -   Lasciel is one of these. Though Harry has bound the magical trinket Lasciel resides in, a psychic echo of her still appears in his mind and offers him power and advice. While Harry doesn't necessarily _want_ the help of a fallen angel who's playing a long game on him so that he ends up in Hell's coffers, the things he encounters require him to make use of her Hellfire and other talents.
    -   The Archangel Uriel also qualifies as one of these for Harry, and is significantly more benevolent about his advice (though not necessarily more polite about it).
    -   In _Ghost Story_, Harry himself acts as a Spirit Advisor to a young man named Fitz.
    -   The air spirit Bob ironically is a light downplayed version since while he is a literal spirit and acts as an advisor to Harry, he is visible to other characters (no matter how much Harry might wish otherwise).
-   Julia Jason Andelius is revealed to be this at the end of Maria Gripe's _The dung-beetle flies at dusk_. She owned the old summer house that the three main protagonists took care of in summer vacation, and her spirit used the home's phone to drop hints about the house's secrets to one of them via an odd chess game.
-   _The General Series_:
    -   General Raj Whitehall is advised by Center, a pre-collapse-of-civilization computer (originally a traffic-control computer, but its abilities go far beyond).
    -   In later books of the series set centuries later, Whitehall's consciousness has joined with Center's, and now they _both_ act as Spirit Advisors on other barbarian planets — Center as the logical fount-of-knowledge and Whitehall as the wise voice-of-experience. This puts their protege in the position of being the moderator of a Power Trio.

-   _The Great Divorce_: Every visitor from Hell is invited to Heaven by a saint assigned to them. Though the Heavenly Beings are all fully visible to one another, the ghosts from Hell can only see them depending on certain circumstances.
-   _John Dies at the End_: John serves this role when his best friend David starts becoming aware of the supernatural and questioning his own sanity. John can't appear for David directly, and thus communicates by broadcasting his words through a cell phone, a bratwurst, and a dog, in that order.
-   _Journey to Chaos_: Dengel serves as this to Eric in the first two books (_A Mage's Power_ and _Looming Shado_), first in a Heroic Host fashion and second in a more classic fashion (Only Eric can see him, gives advice etc.) but the second time is technically "Grey Dengel" which is not the real Dengel.

-   _Liaden Universe_: In Sharon Lee's and Steve Miller's story, the witches of Sintia have a formal Spirit Advisor system—each young witch has an old soul. It's not entirely clear how this works in practice, because none of the point-of-view characters has been a witch of Sintia except Priscilla, and she only becomes a point-of-view character after she leaves the order. (Officially, she was cast out for blasphemy; actually, it was because she—with her Spirit Advisor's encouragement—did the Right Thing when her superiors would have preferred her to do the Politically Convenient Thing.)
-   In _The Lord of the Isles_ by David Drake, Garric is advised by his thousand-years-ago ancestor King Carus. A great deal of the advice actually amounts to, "Don't do what I did in a similar situation; it was a disaster because I didn't think it through."
-   _Malazan Book of the Fallen_: Wither, a wraith, tries to play the spirit advisor towards Udinaas, a slave. Wither hides in Udinaas' shadow to escape capture, and offers Udinaas secret knowledge and advice in exchange. Unfortunately, Wither is a Jerkass with delusions of grandeur, while Udinaas knows that knowing too much is bad for your health. When he eventually escapes slavery, Wither keeps hounding him and whispering pseudo-arcane revelations until Udinaas calls him out on how anyone with a working brain could come to the same conclusions. The now ex-slave points out that Wither feels cheated after he's put so much time and effort into it and now wants Udinaas to have been worth all that attention, which Udinaas isn't as he isn't willing to play along. Wither repays the insight by trying to kill Udinaas in the finale of _Reaper's Gale_.
-   Advice-dispensing pseudo-deities visible (or audible) to only a few people run rampant in Brandon Sanderson's _Mistborn_ series. There's a malevolent version in Ruin, who's advice tends to run toward killing everything. More traditional benevolent advisors include the Mist Spirit/Preservation, who communicates via pointing (and stabbing); Kelsier, who won't let something as silly as death keep him from meddling; and eventually ascended Vin and Sazed.

-   In the book _The Neon Court_, Matthew is advised by the dying breath of his former master, Robert James Bakker. Their relation is complicated by the fact that they killed each other.
-   In _The Neverending Story_: The Purple Buffalo that Atreyu didn't kill in his ritual hunt to officially become a hunter becomes this in Atreyu's dreams. He is the one who points Atreyu to Morla as a thanks for not killing him and instead answering the call of Cairon, whose job was to send him on the mission to save Fantasia.
-   _Nina Tanleven_: The ghosts in the series tend to be this, leading Nine and Chris to critical information that will eventually help the ghost in question resolve their unfinished business and pass on.
-   In _Pet Sematary_, Victor Pascow, who enters the plot as he is dying of massive head trauma after being hit by a car, attempts to warn the protagonist, Louis Creed, against using the Micmac Burying Ground by appearing to Louis in a dream. Unfortunately for just about everyone else in the story, Louis does not heed his warning.
-   _Rain of the Ghosts_: Rain's grandfather Sebastian is an interesting case, in that his ghost looks several decades younger than he was when he died.

-   _Revelation Space_: The Mademoiselle loads a beta-level sim of herself into Ana Khouri's brain implants in Alastair Reynolds'story.
-   _The Silerian Trilogy_: The Beckoner for Mirabar, an odd spirit who only she can see, advises her about what must be done to help the Firebringer, though she's very frustrated with him giving her only cryptic verbage that is difficult dicephering.
-   In Barbara Hambly's _Sisters Of The Raven_ books, Pontifer Pig is this to Pomegranate. Those who know her mostly assume that she is hallucinating about the ghost of her late pet. (In _Circle of the Moon_, however, some consideration is given to the theory that Pontifer might have been a djinn who is managing to use Pomegranate as a host.)

-   Star Wars Legends:
    -   Between _A New Hope_ and _The Empire Strikes Back_, the very green Luke Skywalker is actively mentored by Obi-Wan's spirit. In _Splinter of the Mind's Eye_, which was both written and takes place between those two movies, Luke mentions feeling an "agreeably crawly sensation," like someone is standing with him, which he associates with his teacher. At the end of the book, Obi-Wan briefly possesses Luke in order to fight off Darth Vader, since Luke and Leia would both be killed otherwise. In _Allegiance_, Obi-Wan patiently helps convey to Luke what the Force needs him to do, telling him not to shoot someone who would later become an ally, helping him recognize a "coiled-spring predator" sensation in certain thugs, and generally trying to talk him through things. When Luke, Han, and Chewbacca are locked into separate rooms by the Hand of Judgment, Obi-Wan tells Luke that Leia is in danger, and then has to tell the boy that he's not as trapped as he thinks.
        
        **Luke:** You know, you could make this whole thing a whole lot easier.  
        **Obi-Wan:**_Your uncle could have carried you around on his back until you were fifteen, too._  
        **Luke:** _\[grimaces\]_ Sorry.  
        **Obi-Wan:** _You've taken your first steps into a larger world, Luke. But there are many, many more steps to go. I cannot carry you along your own personal path. All I can do is guide you, and teach you, and help you to find that path for yourself._
        
    -   Obi-Wan continued to mentor Luke after the first death of the Emperor and redemption of Anakin Skywalker. In "The Truce at Bakura" Obi-Wan tells Luke that it's vital he go on the mission to aid the people of Bakura in fending off a Ssi-Ruk invasion.
    -   Obi-Wan also appears several times to Ferus Olin to advise him in _Rebel Force_. Maybe because Olin's already a Jedi, Obi-Wan can manifest more easily to him than to rookie Luke.
    -   A Jedi spirit haunting a space station in _Galaxy of Fear_ can't be detected by anyone who is not Force-sensitive. Tash arrives and _is_, but she's untrained and can only vaguely sense him. He follows her around trying to warn her away from the many hazards, seriously spooking her in the process. Only when she manages to clear her mind and ignore her fears can he make himself properly seen and heard, and for the rest of the book he tries to help and advise her.
    -   Playing off the hint in _Attack of the Clones_, Yoda is depicted conferring with Qui-Gon Jinn's spirit in several Clone Wars–era novels. In _Dark Rendezvous_, Qui-Gon provides a crucial insight into his old master Dooku's intentions, and in the _Revenge of the Sith_ novelization, Yoda actually accepts a position as Qui-Gon's _apprentice_, to learn how to pass into the Force himself. It is implied that Qui-Gon, having been a less conventional Jedi in life, will also teach Yoda how to train Luke to defeat the Emperor, which Yoda himself could not accomplish.
    -   At the beginning of Obi-Wan's exile in _Star Wars: Kenobi_, Qui-Gon has yet to appear to him without Yoda present, but Obi-Wan addresses him in nightly meditations, which serve as Captain's Log entries for the reader. In the last chapter of _Dark Lord—The Rise of Darth Vader_, Obi-Wan discovers that Vader is still alive, and Qui-Gon finally speaks to him to reassure him that Luke is safe—Vader will never return to Tatooine, the planet that caused him so much pain. Qui-Gon also tells Obi-Wan not to tell Luke about his parentage "until the time is right," leading to Obi-Wan's famous Metaphorically True speech when _he_ is a Spirit Advisor.
    -   Anakin briefly becomes one to his grandson Jacen when he tells the young Jedi to stand firm against Omini, the true overlord of the Yuuzan Vong.
-   Syl in _The Stormlight Archive_ fits this trope, she's usually only visible to Kaladin, unless she chooses to let somebody else see her, though Rock can also see her, for some reason. She helps Kaladin by providing encouragement. Later we find out she's a Bond Creature, an honorspren that provides Kaladin with Surgebinding abilities while gaining a capacity for thought and memory.
-   _The Traitor Son Cycle_: The Red Knight has Prudentia, his magic teacher, whose soul he saved from passing on by pulling her into his Happy Place when she was killed. She advises him on magic and acts as his devil's advocate and sounding board. After she sacrifices herself to save him, Harmodius helps Red Knight recreate a simulacra of her to help him with spelcasting.
-   _Trapped on Draconica_: After dying, Erowin takes this role until the climax, by appearing to her sisters and giving advice.
-   _Warrior Cats_: StarClan cats serve this role, guiding their former Clans and cats in it that they cared about.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Expanse_: in Seasons 3 and 4, Miller, who died in the crash of Eros, repeatedly "appears" to Holden as a mental projection created by the Protomolecule in an attempt to communicate with and guide him in a familiar form.
-   _Game of Thrones_: Jojen Reed appears in Bran's dreams about the three-eyed crow, advising him on how to follow it.
-   _Heroes_:
    -   A subversion in the third season—Linderman appears to have come back as a spirit advisor to various characters, but he's actually a hallucination created by Maury Parkman.
    -   In the first season, an Indian kid named Sanjog has people visit him in their dreams and deliver cryptic messages.
-   _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_:
    -   Number Six is usually invisible to anyone but Gaius Baltar. Her appearances are carefully crafted so that she can be seen as a figment of Gaius's imagination, although she seems to be able to physically manipulate Gaius's clothing and person, and gives Gaius information that could be interpreted as foreknowledge. In one episode, Gaius Baltar appears to a resurrected Number Six, and plays the part of _her_ Spirit Advisor. Interestingly, neither the "real" Baltar or Number Six have any knowledge of their Spirit Advisor counterparts, until an episode in which Baltar's Spirit Advisor counterpart appears to Baltar.
    -   Kara's father showed up to teach her two-thousand-year-old Earth music.
-   In _The Big Bang Theory_, the deceased Professor Proton has become this to Sheldon Cooper, turning up (unwillingly) in his dreams to dispense advice whenever Sheldon is having a crisis. Arthur is usually bemused to be dressed like Obi-Wan Kenobi, but is fascinated by the mandatory lightsaber.
-   Mr. Ed in _Mister Ed_.
-   Al in _Quantum Leap_ in some sense even if he is alive and appear like an hologram from the present time.
-   Appropriately enough, God in _Joan of Arcadia_ might be the ultimate Spirit Advisor.
-   Marty Hopkirk in _Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)_ was a Spirit Advisor whom only his partner-in-detection Jeff could see.
-   Ed Chigliak of _Northern Exposure_ has a literal Spirit Advisor, an ancestral Indian spirit named One-Who-Waits.
-   Bob, formerly Hrothbert of Bainbridge, in _The Dresden Files_ TV series, is a prime example of the trope. This character is a Spirit Advisor several times over. He not only gives Harry advice on what kind of magic to do in any given situation, he assists in many cases, thanks to his spectral abilities. He also started teaching Harry magic when Harry was eleven. He was also Spirit Advisor to a number of other wizards down through the centuries, including Harry's evil uncle, Justin Morningway.
-   _Slings & Arrows_: Geoffrey disregards a lot of Oliver's advice, and often that makes things turn out better than they might have if Geoffrey had listened to him.
-   _Lost_:
    -   Boone appears to Locke in the sweat lodge.
    -   Charlie and Anna-Lucia have appeared to Hurley and given him advice, much to his dismay. Mr. Eko has also played chess with him.
    -   Christian Shephard, Jack's father, has appear before various people on the island.
    -   Jacob, leader of the Others, of which only Ben and Locke have really interacted with.
    -   After Jacob's death, he puts on this role to guide Hurley, taking advantage of Hurley's ability to converse with the dead. Hurley actually compares his appearances to Obi-Wan Kenobi. Of course, he's got his own motives, good or bad, and he's more of a Manipulative Bastard than The Mentor.

-   _The 10th Kingdom_: Snow White calls herself a fairy godmother, but also freely admits she is actually dead (something which is never stated about fairy godmothers). Only Virginia and Wendell (the latter either because he's gone doggy at the time or because he's her grandson) can see and speak with her—Tony cannot. She later appears in Virginia's dreams.
-   _American Gothic (1995)_: Merlyn. While Caleb is not the only person who can see and speak to her, she does appear for the most part only as a ghost who advises her brother on how to stay on the straight and narrow. The others who catch sight of her or even interact with her (apart from her brief stint as a mortal in "Rebirth") are Buck (who even aside from being the Big Bad has a lot more powers at his disposal than the average resident of Trinity) and Ben Healy. In the latter's case, this is only because Merlyn herself chooses to appear to him and haunt his dreams, since he knows the truth about how she died and she's trying to appeal to his conscience so he can break free of Buck's influence. No one else, like Gail (who is her cousin as well as Caleb's) or Mrs. Holt, ever sees her.
-   _Farscape_: Harvey, a neural clone of Scorpius jammed into John Crichton's head, who eventually does provide some advice... after several seasons of trying to completely screw with Crichton's head and causing several character deaths.
-   _Due South_:
    -   Benton Fraser gets to know his father much _better_ after the latter's death (in the series pilot) than he ever did in life, thanks to Bob Fraser's insistence on hanging around and offering (frequently irritating and unwelcome) personal and professional advice. Fraser Sr. even sets up extradimensional living quarters (so to speak) in his son's office closet.
    -   We also very briefly see Ray Vecchio's deceased father doing this to Ray once or twice.
-   John Scott serves as SA for Olivia on _Fringe_ resulting from their Psychic Link, despite some obvious trust issues between them.
-   _The Mighty Boosh_: In the episode "The Chokes", Howard Moon is saved from stage fright by the apparition of his acting coach, Montgomery Flange.
-   In _Dexter_, Harry Morgan has become one of these. Initially he was a flashback character, but as the series progressed, he began appearing to Dexter as a kind of hallucination. Dexter also has his Dark Passenger, but this is not personified in the series.
-   _Six Feet Under_: This is usually from a character who has recently died, although the writers have explicitly stated that they are figments of the particular character's imagination.
-   _Mercy_ plays with both this and Magical Negro by having Veronica hallucinate the ghost of Trey, the robber she had to shoot in the previous episode. He keeps trying to get her to run away, as well as get drunk. She finds out in the next episode that he was a serious scumbag.
-   _Charmed (1998)_: The main characters can summon their dead relatives if they need help.
-   _Veronica Mars_: Lily Kane first appears to tell her brother that her murder isn't solved. She later appears and distracts Veronica from getting on a bus with a bomb on it that ended up crashing and killing everyone on board.
-   Godric on _True Blood_ for Eric.
-   _Constantine (2014)_: The Angel Manny is _supposed_ to be this, but as John notes, he usually shows up to chew John out, say he cannot do anything about the current problem, or any advice he does give is so cryptic it is useless. So, while he is intended to be a spirit advisor, he is a very poor one.
-   _Star Trek: Voyager_: Chakotay can go on vision quests and talk to spirits. He also tries to teach others how to do this, with less-than-ideal results.
-   _SCTV_ did a parody of "Play it Again, Sam" built around Woody Allen's admiration of Bob Hope, hoping to do a film project with him. Like Bogart in the original, he's coached by the spirit of Bing Crosby on how to connect with Hope.
-   _Crazy Ex-Girlfriend_ lampshades this to hell and back with the song "Dream Ghost":
    
    _I'm going to take you on a journey through time and space  
    And in the end you'll realize,  
    you knew the answer all along.  
    Honestly, it's a bit of a waste._
    
-   In the very short-lived series, _The Book of Daniel_, the titular character has multiple one-on-one conversations with Jesus.
-   _CSI: Miami_ has two examples of this.
    -   One as Eric Delko receiving help from the recently deceased Tim "Speed" Speedle on a case. Anybody familiar can explain this away based of Delko's bullet-across-the-head incident in an earlier season.
    -   A second example is a running theme in the episode "Backfire". Calleigh Duquesne is visited by the spirit of the innocent dead boy whose body was found inside of a burned down house. This one can't be as easily explained as Delko's.
-   _Ash vs. Evil Dead_: Ash's dead father Brock Williams appears to him as a ghost in season 3 to provide him clues on the evil going-ons in the town.
-   _7 Yüz_: In the episode "Refakatçiler", Serdar thinks Vildan has appeared to be his "companion" (_refakatçi_), a spirit which guides a dying soul to the afterlife. She has only appeared as a helper, however, hoping to grant him clarity and peace in his final days by facing his regrets. Additionally, she implies that she can't be his companion, as she has already once served that role (presumably to their son Okan).
-   Ben (reluctantly) plays this role to Klaus in _The Umbrella Academy (2019)_, as Ben is dead and Klaus is the only person who can see him. He usually dispenses snarky comments and occasionally suggests that Klaus make some effort to turn his life around, though he seems fully aware that that won't work. In Season Two, he gets a bit more serious about offering help and advice to Vanya, while he's inside her mind trying to save her from herself. He reminds her that she's no longer alone, and that her siblings love her. He then fully passes while in her arms.
-   In _Obi-Wan Kenobi_ the Force Ghost of Qui-Gon Jinn finally appears to Obi-Wan after he rescues Leia Organa from the Imperials, feeling that Obi-Wan was finally ready to see him.
    -   The _Star Wars Expanded Universe_ carries this on further, with Qui-Gon continuing to act as a spirit advisor to Obi-Wan. By the time _A New Hope_ takes place, Qui-Gon becomes almost coporeal again in his final meeting with Obi-Wan while the latter was still alive, but does not tell Obi-Wan that very soon Obi-Wan would make the same journey he did.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Believers in ancestor worship, such as Chinese folk religions, Shintō, and some Native American religions, often believe that this literally happens. Whether it's animal spirits, dead relatives, or something else giving the advice varies.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Leva Bates heard about a way to meet a spirit guide and sought it out after losing to Mia Yim at SHINE, going on a losing streak in IWA Texas/ACW and then failing to defeat Solo Darling at Full Impact Pro, all this happening after she resolved to hold nothing back from then on. Her guide didn't really have any guidance to give though.

    Radio 

-   Parodied in Fit the Seventh _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1978)_, where Zaphod Beeblebrox claims to be one for himself:
    
    **Zaphod:** I came to myself in a dream and said "Go see Zarniwoop." Never heard of the cat before, but I seemed very insistent.
    

    Roleplay 

-   In _Dawn of a New Age: Oldport Blues_, Fesxis serves as one to Sebastian. She's a form of spirit that is able to possess his body, and by doing so can speak to him mentally and tutor him on how to use his superpower. Other characters can't hear her (apart from Zia, a telepath) which gains Sebastian some strange looks when he apparently talks to the air.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Pathfinder_'s _Curse of the Crimson Throne_ adventure path, this role is filled by Zellara, the fortune teller who assembles the PCs to get revenge on crime lord Gaedren Lamm at the very beginning of the path. After disposing of Lamm, the characters find Zellara's head, revealing that she was Dead All Along. Her spirit continues to assist them throughout the path, performing Harrow (Pathfinder's tarot equivalent) readings at the start of each adventure that grant the characters minor bonuses. In the final adventure, she merges with another ghost to turn her Harrow deck into a powerful, but risky artifact for the PCs' use.
-   _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_:
    -   Ancestor spirits perform this role for the Gaia Garou.
    -   In one Time of Judgment scenario, Old Man Manyskins (a Nuwisha elder) is assassinated by the Nagah for stealing secrets from other changing breeds. Afterwards, he appears to his fellow Nuwisha in their dreams and shares his secret knowledge with them.
-   If the Medium is killed in _Town of Salem_, they have a choice to seance a target for a night, allowing them to rely their information for the person to will or otherwise know for the upcoming day.

    Theatre 

-   In the play (and miniseries) _Angels in America_, Ethel Rosenberg appears to Roy Cohn after he is diagnosed with AIDS, though it's mainly just to torture him while he's on his deathbed (It's stated that he illegally influenced the verdict in her trial to get her executed). She fits this trope more traditionally when she helps Louis recite the Kaddish (the Jewish prayer for the dead) after Roy dies. Prior's ancestors fit this trope too.
-   In _Allegro_, Joe's grandmother and mother appear occasionally as Spirit Advisors to him after their deaths, though the Greek Chorus serves as his all-purpose Spirit Advisor throughout the show.
-   The opera _The Turn of the Screw_ plays the two ghosts as a not-so-benevolent version of this. Miles can hear Quint and Flora can hear Miss Jessel, while the Governess sees both (except in the final scene) but hears neither. They are not always visible to the audience; in particular, Quint appears as no more than a silhouette in the interscene where he tells Miles to take the letter the Governess has written.

    Video Games 

-   _Elohim Eternal: The Babel Code_: A group of seven glowing apparitions, the elohim, often give advice to Joshwa and claim that he's destined to become a great king one day. In the ending, they somehow slow the detonation of the infernos in order to give the party enough time to evacuate the residents of Jericho. However, they seem to be communicating remotely, since they mention that they're on the run from something.
-   _Get in the Car, Loser!_: Anyone who wields the Sword of Fate temporarily dies in battle against the Machine Devil, only to meet the previous wielder of the sword, get a pep talk from them, and get revived. Agi states that in a thousand years, Grace will meet the next wielder of the sword and revive them too.
-   _Odin Sphere_ has the bird that appears to Gwendolyn at certain points of the game. Throughout her story, the bird appears to be a manifestation of her inner conscience, and she struggles against it often. It berates and blatantly talks down to her, throwing out nagging truths that eat at her from the inside. It turns out to be the spirit of her late sister Griselda.
-   In _Prey (2006)_, the main character's grandfather, Enisi, is a wise Indian who keeps scolding the protagonist for his rebellious nature. Soon after the aliens attack, Enisi kicks the bucket as an alien machine eviscerates him... and he shows up again as a ghost, granting the main character otherworldly powers (like not dying and spirit walking) and another Spirit Advisor in the form of a hawk, who translates alien messages.
-   _Shade: Wrath of Angels_ have a spirit-like entity called the Angel of Faith who appears to serve this role, appearing to you in the intro to bestow news of your brother's disappearance and giving you a Cool Sword capable of harming demons and the undead. But it's quickly subverted when it turns out she's a Hidden Villain and your Treacherous Quest Giver using you the whole game.
-   The _Shadow Hearts_ series both plays with the trope and uses it straight.
    -   In the first game, the Spirit "Advisors" are the Four Masks, fiendish entities who torment and mock those who can see them, plotting to steal their souls. Later, in _Covenant_, Jeanne plays the role straight for Yuri. A past Big Bad also appears in a dodgy Heel–Face Turn.
    -   In both _Covenant_ and _From the New World_, the Ring Soul appears, a being with power over fate. This being _Shadow Hearts_, the main character quickly gets past their formality and makes friends with them.
-   _Puzzle Quest: Challenge Of The Warlords_: one of the last subquests involves Sunspear the Minotaur going off to die in battle against an elder frost dragon. When you follow his instructions and return to your departure point, he rejoins your party as a spirit (with his Red Mana bonus now extending to battles with the undead as well as other minotaurs) It's never mentioned whether any of the other party members can see him.
-   Both _Baten Kaitos_ and its prequel have the _player_ act as the Spirit Advisor to the game's main character, which allows the characters to break the fourth wall without acting out of character.
-   _The Conduit_: Prometheus after you have to destroy his body so Adams/Enlil can't make any more Drudge, and he transfers his mind into the ASE
-   _Ghost Trick_: Ray is a spirit advisor to another spirit. He helps Sissel figure out how to use ghost tricks (supernatural abilities used to influence the world of the living). Sissel himself can also be considered a spirit advisor to characters he saves and talks to, especially to those he meets recurringly.
-   _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_: The Hero's Shade teaches Link various skills throughout the game. It was eventually confirmed that he is the spirit of Link from _Ocarina of Time_ and _Majora's Mask_.
-   _Warcraft_:
    -   In _Warcraft III_, Kel'thuzad serves as a spirit advisor in his ghost form to the undead Arthas after his soul has been consumed by Frostmourne. This continues until Kel'thuzad is resurrected in the Sun Well.
    -   Uther the Lightbringer, the revered paladin who founded and headed the Silver Hand and perished at the hands of his own pupil Arthas in _Warcraft III_, came back as a ghost in _World of Warcraft_ to paladins who accomplished the quest to honor (Alliance)/desecrate (Horde) his grave before the revamp of the _Cataclysm_ espansion, and gave some advices. He also came back as a ghost to give advices to Sylvanas Windrunner (Horde)/Jaina Proudmore (Alliance) and the players in the five-players Icecrown dungeon Halls of Reflection on how to defeat the Lich King (Arthas), with his spirit apparently emerging from the Soul Eating sword Frostmourne.
-   The phantom Alchemist in _Reah: Face the Unknown_, whose body is hidden in the Desert City's temple. The front door is locked and his ghost can only travel so far, but this doesn't stop him from giving you subtle clues and testing you with puzzles when you get inside. Later, after you use a hidden portal, the Alchemist follows you throughout the rest of Reah as this trope. By the endgame, however, the Alchemist shows his true colors when you activate the Core machine, revealing that Reah is his own creation, and that you've already been there before the game started.
-   In _BioShock 2_, it's possible for Subject Delta to become this for Eleanor at the end if she absorbs his essence. In the good ending, this means he becomes her conscience as they're finally reunited. In the bad ending, Eleanor decides that his instincts are not going to waste and that the world is about to change.

-   _Deadly Premonition_: Francis York Morgan regards Zach as something around the lines of this, with the implication that he may just be asking the players themselves. The ending reveals that York is the real Spirit Advisor to Zach, who created York to protect himself from trauma inflicted by Big Bad Forrest Kaysen.

-   _Star Fox 64_: James McCloud at the canonical end guides Fox out of Andross's Collapsing Lair.
    
    _Never give up. Trust your instincts._
    
-   _Batman: Arkham Knight_: Inverted where the Joker returns from the dead as hallucination that taunts Batman and mocks his failures throughout the game.
-   In the _Evil Dead: Regeneration_, Necronomicon expert Professor Knowby becomes a Spirit Advisor to Ash, as the latter is the best hope of stopping a demonic invasion of Earth. Ash, naturally, calls Knowby a useless floating head.
-   _Dante's Inferno_: Taken literally with Virgil, the classical Roman poet. Since he is a pure spirit, he cannot help Dante fight his enemies, but can only steer him on his path to save his wife's soul through the nine circles of hell.
-   Right at the beginning of _I-Ninja_, Sensei becomes a Spirit Adviser for Ninja... after the latter blindly chops his head off in a Rage Stone-infused fit.
-   In _The Elder Scrolls_ series, as revealed in _Skyrim_, this is part of the agreement the Nightingales make with Nocturnal, the Daedric Prince of Darkness and the Night who is also associated with Thieves and Luck. In life, Nocturnal grants the Nightingales immense power and freedom to do with it as they wish, on the condition that they _always_ protect the Ebonmere, the conduit between her realm of Oblivion, Evergloam, and Mundus, the mortal plane. Deceased Nightingales then serve a "term" as the "spectral guardians" of the Ebonmere and Twilight Sepulcher, allowing them to communicate with the still-living Nightingales.
-   In _Cyberpunk 2077_ V is equipped with a brain implant allowing him to communicate with the Virtual Ghost of punk rocker and terrorist Johnny Silverhand, who acts as a snarky Mentor in Sour Armor to them as they traverse the Wretched Hive of Night City.
-   In _Star Wars: The Old Republic_ the Jedi Knight Player Character is visited by the ghost of their old master Orgus Din on several occasions throughout the storyline.
-   In the _Knights of the Old Republic_ Fan Game _The Jedi Masters_, the Player Character is a Force-sensitive Adventurer Archaeologist who ends up being trained by the ghost of the Sith Lord Freedon Nadd while exploring his tomb. If the player decides that they want to follow the Light side of the Force later on however, he's generous enough to point them in the direction of the ghost of Jedi Knight Ulic Qel-Droma for further guidance (if only to prove to them how "futile" it is to resist his influence).
-   Early on in _Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin_, Jonathan and Charlotte encountered a friendly ghost, who appeared capable of resisting the castle's power and influence. Calling himself Wind, he supported the pair by granting them skills and equipment if they could prove themselves worthy of them by completing the tasks he gave. His true identity turned out to be Eric Lecarde, the man who had previously fought alongside Jonathan's father in _Castlevania: Bloodlines_.
-   Ghosts of the Chosen in _Eternal Darkness_ often communicate with future Tome-bearers, passing on their burden of stopping Pious Augustus and his Ancient, along with physically giving whatever helpful tools they may have found during their own lifespan.
-   While only seen once in _The Walking Dead (Telltale)_ series, being in Season 4 Episode 3, apparently Clementine meets Lee every now and then in her dreams whenever she is about to embark on a difficult mission. Each time, the setting will always be the train they took to Savannah, being the place where Lee helped Clem to prepare for how to survive. During each of these meetings, Lee will give her some last minute advice and expresses how proud he is. They also meet in her dream after she was shot by Arvo in Season 2 Episode 5, set in the RV back in Season 1.
-   Legion expansion of _World of Warcraft_: In one of the cutscenes that take place after the Alliance King Varyan Wrynn dies in battle against the Burning Legion, his son, prince Anduin Wrynn receives a vision of his father's spirit on the battlefield where Varyan fought, doubting himself whether he can be as good of a king as his father was.
-   _Honkai Impact 3rd_: Fu Hua takes up this role for Kiana in Chapter 11EX and some later chapters.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney_: Mia Fey performs this function in the games. It's made easier by the fact that Phoenix's Sidekick Maya is a Spirit Medium and Mia's little sister, whose _job description_ is speaking on behalf of dead people. (This often happens involuntarily, as Maya's abilities for the first game and a half are a bit hit-or-miss, and Mia's a definitely forceful personality.) Later on, usually when Maya is unavailable, their Medium-prodigy cousin Pearl does similar helpful channeling.

    Web Animation 

-   In _Ducktalez_ 7, a heroic BSODing Vegeta tries to get advice from Mufasa, but he just calls Vegeta a tool.
-   In _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device_, the ghost of Ferrus Manus acts like a parody of this, repeatedly demotivating his advisee.
-   _RWBY_: In Volume 4, the fourteen-year-old Farm Boy Oscar ends up joining the heroes in their fight against Salem because he has the ability to channel a spirit advisor who possesses key knowledge and experience they need in the battle against her. It comes as a bit of a surprise to all of them, especially Oscar, who went to bed "normal" and woke up "special". When Ozpin's physical body is killed at the end of Volume 3, his soul, Aura and memories merge with Oscar. He can communicate either as a voice inside Oscar's head or by taking control of Oscar's body directly. It's a form of Parasitic Immortality bestowed upon him thousands of years ago by the God of Light to guide humanity towards The Day of Reckoning. Unfortunately, his ability to do that has been complicated by Salem, whose Complete Immortality makes her an Invincible Villain. His decision to hide this Awful Truth from the heroes means they stop trusting his advice and guidance, sending him into an Heroic BSoD where he locks himself in the back of Oscar's mind for two volumes.

    Webcomics 

-   _The Way of the Metagamer_: Gary Gygax _is_ a genuine ghost — he can control his visibility for individuals, as demonstrated here.
-   _Homestuck_:
    -   The Kernelsprites when suitably prototyped. So far, every player has protoyped their Kernelsprite with the remains of the deceased, in essence reviving the departed in sprite mode, with all memories of their past life. Using something dead isn't strictly necessary, but Kernelsprites are preternaturally drawn to death and using something not dead is rare, with only 3 (out of 16) being shown in canon, and all of those were tier 2 prototyped with a dead person. All of these sprites are ultimately fated to die a second time.
    -   Some of the Trolls die and continue to linger in pseudo-purgatory and provide advice for the remaining players. Oddly the most literal definition of the trope applies to Vriska for _WV_, as she harasses him in his dreams.
-   _Bob and George_: Megaman, briefly. X and Ran also become these more cohesively to George and Megaman respectively later on, until they each are created.
-   In _Fite!_, Cub is one to Lucco though he's actually just another patient in Lucco's hospital who's Conversing With The Unconscious. After Lucco wakes up, Guz becomes one.
-   In _MYth: A Promise_, Metis attempts to become this to Zeus but _Distillation_ reveals that she failed and entrusts his guidance to their daughter Athena.
-   _Sam & Fuzzy_ : Conscience Cat may or may not be one of these. Flying talking cats are hardly outlandish by the standards of that 'verse, and the only time Conscience Cat appears in a setting there a third party would be able to see him, said third party decides it would be more interesting not to answer whether or not he can see him.
-   _The Meek_: When this trope and Treacherous Advisor meet in the same person, _very_ bad things can happen, precisely as they do (to the emperor Luca and, particularly, his wife).
-   In May's first appearance in _Questionable Content_, this is her intended function, as an AI augmented-reality beta program streaming from a server to Dale's Google Glass–esque spectacles, which only the wearer can see. However, since she's only participating in order to make parole from Robot Jail, she's vulgar, sarcastic, and rude, and her advice is terrible. After she and Dale warm up to each other, however, she offers some real relationship advice. She later appears incarnated as a robot, having made parole.
-   _Star Mares_ has a ghostly Applejack fulfilling this role to Moontear (as Twilight "Kenobi" Sparkle was already spoken for).
-   _Kill Six Billion Demons_: After his body gets decapitated during the comic's intro, Zoss' subsequent appearances are all as a phantom only visible or audible to Allison. He has a tendency to appear out of the shadows to give her cryptic but motivating advice. _King of Swords_ reveals Zoss communicates with Allison mentally, meaning Incubus can see him as well as long as he's using his Dream Walker powers on Allison at the same time.
