_"And do you know what a fixer does? Allow me to explain. Not only do I finalize transactions. I can accomplish the goddamn impossible. Makin' sure the buyer, supplier, and ever-neglected intermediary not only keep their heads in their games but keep their heads. Period. So don't you ever ask me who, with whom, where, when, why or how."_

A con crew role, the Fixer is essentially the stage manager for the crew ... or maybe "properties (props) director" or "set designer" would be better analogies. Either way, this is the person the Con Man goes to if he needs a thing to do his thing. Criminals can't go to a regular rental agency or consultant, because they're planning a crime. So they use a veteran, trusted criminal to source the gear or advice they need.

Call up your Fixer if you need a fake storefront for a day, convincing counterfeit money, squibs for the blow-off, a credible-looking Ming vase to con an art dealer, or a CIA-grade cellphone jammer. You also call them in as a consultant if you need to know how to get fake passports, find a Back-Alley Doctor to do an emergency operation, turn off city power for an entire block or... well, anything else of an illegal nature that needs "fixing". The weirder, the better. Live jackalopes, a specialty.

Compare Knowledge Broker, Friend in the Black Market, and The Scrounger as well as The Engineer in military and other settings. Contrast Clean Up Crew, who may assist by eliminating forensic evidence and bodies after dirty deeds are done.

Alternative uses of the term:

-   Gangster films from the forties called lawyers fixers - see Amoral Attorney, The Consigliere.
-   Big Hollywood studios use fixers to smooth over their movie stars' sex scandals and boozy misadventures. A brown envelope here, a call to a Police Commissioner there, and a few strings pulled at the newspaper and the problem vanishes.
-   A gangland type (sometimes called a Bag Man) who specializes in resolving conflicts between gangs may also be called a fixer.
-   As are people who interface with law-enforcement to put the "fix in."

     Literature  

-   In _The Dresden Files_, Harry is an important figure in Chicago because he's the most knowledgeable and neutral consultant there for all things supernatural. (There are more knowledgeable people, but they demand things like souls or political allegiance in exchange for any help they provide.) Want a cure for werewolf fleas? He can do that. Want to get in touch with the mafia? He can do that. Want to kill a child-devouring monster that predates electric lighting? He can do that. This is one reason why his death in _Changes_ causes so much trouble; it's not that Chicago's groups are any less strong individually, but he was the guy keeping them all in contact, and now the right hand doesn't know what the left is doing.
-   Several appear in _On Wings of Eagles_ by Ken Follett, as Ross Perot and his EDS executives try to get their colleagues out of an Iranian prison.

    -   An Iranian helps them evacuate most of the EDS staff when the revolution starts, but gets a small tip so refuses to have anything further to do with them. One of the executives makes a formal apology and places a large sum of cash on the table to re-establish relationships.

Though Felix is quick to say when intimidating Karen in her attempt to talk to him that 'fixer' isn't how he thinks of himself.
    
    **Felix Manning:** Off the record, you are incorrect. About what I do for a living. I don't fix problems. I make them disappear.
