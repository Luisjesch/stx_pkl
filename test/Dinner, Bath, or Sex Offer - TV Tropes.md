_Welcome back, honey! Now what would you like? Dinner? A bath? Or perhaps... me?_

— **Loving wife, to her husband**

A character, usually a housewife but almost Always Female, offers her partner three choices; traditionally, it's either meal, bath or sex. Downplayed examples may ignore the offer of sex, while Exaggerated examples may offer multiple partners, or show up in a Naked Apron.

As this trope has its basis in an old Japanese custom<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  (which is likely to get parodied nowadays), this trope is fairly common in hentai and Ecchi, particularly Rom Coms and Harem Genre anime. In modern comedies the protagonist will often either choose one of the options that isn't sex or ignore the question entirely; it's not uncommon for the person being asked the question to not reciprocate the girl's feelings at all. Alternately, in a raunchier sort of comedy they may choose all three at the same time.

Merely making the offer implies the submissive/dominant roles of the relationship between the characters, because the submissive is ready for "anything" asked of them. In exaggerated or parodic examples, the third option may be Punctuated! For! Emphasis! in a suggestive and often sing-song way. Only giving one option doesn't qualify, unless it's a Morton's Fork where each option leads to the same result. Another part of this trope is that it is also often practiced by Insatiable Newlyweds or Sickeningly Sweethearts, and played for maximum glurge that ends up giving their colleagues and acquaintances cuteness overloads and/or jealousy.
