Kill them all. No sorting necessary.

_"Watch me, and tremble. For I bring the purity of **oblivion** to your world."_

Who caused The End of the World as We Know It? _This guy_. Committing genocide on a daily basis, destroying continents, wiping out civilizations, exterminating whole planets: When this character turns up, entire _galaxies_ or _universes_ may die, or even _reality_ itself — the Omnicidal Maniac has made his entrance and where he goes, the survival rate of everything nearby quickly drops towards zero.

Put simply, the Omnicidal Maniac is a villain whose main plan and motive is "destroy everything". He actively seeks the destruction of whatever world the setting is based in, does it as an end unto itself, has the ability to do so, and is both aware of what he's doing and fully motivated to do so. He can and he will, even if it logically means going down himself as well.

Most Omnicidal Maniacs will aim for at least Class 3 on the Apocalypse How scale, but it may vary from setting to setting — in a Medieval European Fantasy setting, the known world may just be a kingdom or two, while in a Space Opera, expect the whole known galaxy or the universe or even the Multiverse to be his goal. Despite the name, being completely insane is not a requirement, but having a Freudian Excuse or a coldly pragmatic reason for wanting to kill everyone (like if they're a necromancer who wants to rule The Necrocracy) doesn't make the Omnicidal Maniac any less of a menace.

Contrast the Person of Mass Destruction (who doesn't necessarily _want_ to use their powers to destroy the world), Mike Nelson, Destroyer of Worlds (who causes damage of this scale largely by accident, through ignorance, or for comedic, non-serious reasons intended to elicit laughter), and Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds (whose tragic, crapsack lives made them see red and lay the blame on all their woes upon the world). Omnicidal Maniacs are _not_ amusing and have clearly-defined reasons for wanting to destroy everything nearby, which they do with a great deal of malice.

The Omnicidal Maniac differs from the Suicidal Cosmic Temper Tantrum and Put Them All Out of My Misery in that the Maniac has "destroy world" as motive and "I go down with it" as an unfortunate side-effect (or isn't planning to go down with the world at all if they happen to have the power or means to survive the destruction they wrought), while the latter two have "I die/I am miserable" as motive and "world goes with me" as insurance.

The logical extreme of the less destructive Feeling Oppressed by Their Existence, Kill All Humans, Misanthrope Supreme, and Absolute Xenophobe. Compare Planet Eater, Planet Looters, and Horde of Alien Locusts, whose world-destroying is more of a side-effect of their own desire to stay alive. Fighting against this villain (or scores of them) means Evil Only Has to Win Once to destroy everything. The Generic Doomsday Villain is this without any good reason for destroying everything, not even sadism. These types often start by destroying their own particular people/clan/culture/race first, which is Genocide from the Inside.

The Straw Nihilist, the Psycho for Hire, or the A God Am I mentality are very popular amongst this character archetype.

    Fan Works 

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_: Ghidorah like in the _Godzilla_ movies. Ghidorah is confirmed as being a serial Planet Destroyer like it was in the earlier movies, having actively eradicated entire civilizations, and wrecked alien worlds' ecospheres by covering the skies in Perpetual Storms. This story also eventually expands on Ghidorah's Backstory and how and why it became this way.
-   Red Cyclone in _Ace Combat: The Equestrian War_ sees ponies as weaklings and wouldn't like to think of them as anything other than an extinct race. In chapter 19, he goes as far as trying to detonate a burst missile above Fortress Intimidation, which would inevitably catch other griffins in its explosions. When Zeakros informs him of that, what is his response?
    
    **Red Cyclone**: Like I care. So what if a few griffins need to be sacrificed? If it will mean the destruction of those pathetic ponies, then I’ll take that chance! Besides, they’re nothing but expendable pawns to me. I can replace them easily.
    
-   In _Ages of Shadow_, after Jade is permanently sealed, Zaben ends up completely losing it. Coming to the conclusion that life is meaningless and cruel, he decides to Put Them All Out of My Misery by using the Elemental Seal and three of the Sun Souls to amplify the power of the "Omega: The End" card (which can Ret-Gone people and things from existence) to the point it can destroy the entire universe.
-   _The Bridge (MLP)_:
    -   The Big Bad Bagan wants nothing but this, thinking that life is a mistake and that death is the only way to "free" trapped souls from mortal flesh.
        
        **Bagan**: "To unmake a world... the first of many..."
        
    -   Just like his film counterpart, Grand King Ghidorah (and his deceased brother DesGhidorah) wanders the universe casually wiping out planets both For the Evulz and to feed on the souls of the inhabitants.
    -   In the spin-off _The Bridge: Sound of Thunder_, Mothra Lea's evil Mirror Universe counterpart Battra Lea is this. Her father was obsessed with wiping out the planet's biosphere and her mother was obsessed with wiping out all mortals, and she inherited both of their natures.
-   _Bring Me to Life_: The First's endgame is to use a cosmic alignment known as the Awakening to access the Eye of Creation and use its raw power to destroy The Multiverse. Then, it intends to create a new reality in its own image.
-   _Child of the Storm_ has Gravemoss, an insane, immortal albino Light Elf necromancer who wants to kill everything. He's implied that he's a former associate of Thanos. And he's got hold of the Darkhold. When he was already boxing in Loki's class, magic wise. Yup, creation is screwed.
    -   Surtur, the original Dark Phoenix, originally well-intentioned but was driven insane by power and his own hubris, becoming convinced that the universe was flawed and that only he could make it better. By utterly destroying it and starting over, of course. He's failed, so far, but not for lack of trying, having destroyed an entire _galaxy_ the last time he was loosed on the universe.
    -   Thanos is treated is the biggest and the baddest example of this in the setting, a fully-fledged cosmic horror - Doctor Strange's entire multi-millennia scale time-travelling Xanatos Gambit is solely dedicated to defeating him, with the likes of Gravemoss and Surtur treated as mere sideshows. At one point in the sequel, he observes that while Surtur, mentioned above, is absolutely horrific, he only succeeded in destroying one galaxy, when there are hundreds of thousands in the universe. Thanos, by contrast, insane as he is, can destroy _all of them._
-   Tirek, The Man Behind the Man and Greater-Scope Villain in _The Conversion Bureau: The Other Side of the Spectrum_. His entire goal is to enslave and destroy all life and is using the Mirror Universe Equestria and its ponies to attack Earth and forcibly transform humans into mindless pony-shaped drones called Newfoals, a process that is described as horrific Mind Rape and a Fate Worse than Death with Getting Smilies Painted on Your Soul. It's made very clear that once he's done subjugating Earth and humanity, Sunny Equestria (which didn't go through the Point of Divergence its counterpart had) is next and he'll keep on going through the rest of the multiverse. As the embodiment of the Element of Magic puts it:
    
    **Em:** There shall be nothing but Tirek, and he will die alone in a lifeless multiverse of rusting automata, and rejoice in that death.
    
-   _Dungeon Keeper Ami_:
    -   Crowned Death's cult revolves around decrying 'the blight that is life' and celebrating 'the beauty of death, the end of existence'. Mukrezar, upon his resurrection, notes tongue-in-cheek that Crowned Death's followers continue to spread that very message... even after death.
        
        **Mukrezar:** If their lord likes death so much, then he should just kill himself. But no, he hates all life so much that he needs to make sure it is all gone before he can enjoy sweet oblivion. Excuses, excuses.
        
    -   Mukrezar himself probably qualifies, though his antics seem to be more motivated by It Amused Me than any desire for destruction itself.
-   _Doki Doki Literature Club!_/_Doki Doki Literature Girls_ fic _Enemies Within_, Evil Sayori longs to destroy every reality where an iteration of the game exists as part of her gambit for vengeance on Monika. She had already destroyed 30 realities already by the time the story starts.
-   In _Power Girl_ fanfic _A Force of Four_, Mars, the Amazons' ancient enemy intends to destroy Earth, killing everybody and relocate all souls to a kind of Valhalla where they'll fight forever, keeping him eternally fed.
    
    **Mars:** Mars is not tied to Earth. Mars is tied to war. And what better war than that of vast empires within the second Heaven? Where billions may die, billions more be enslaved, and the bloodflow which results nourishes my power with every drop. No. Earth is unnecessary. A canker in my being. When it is destroyed, only my pain will vanish.
    
-   _A Future of Friendship, A History of Hate_: Back at the dawn of time, the other Sentiox were sickened by Ruinate intentionally making Equestria a Crapsack World, so took control of it away from him and gave it to his sister Amity. This caused him to destroy several of their worlds to spite them... at which point he discovered he _liked_ destroying worlds. At that point, he decided to destroy _everything_, which is what eventually led to him being sealed away. Now that he's free, he's planning on picking up where he left off as soon as he's done returning Equestria to the way it was under his initial rule.
-   _Harmless_ has Ammit, an ancient and powerful ghost who intends to wipe out everything (living and ghost alike) just because he enjoys killing and is in search of a Worthy Opponent.
-   _Harmony Theory_ has Nightmare Umbra, a War God and implied Social Darwinist, who has judged the world as weak and decided to turn everything to ash.
    -   To a lesser extent, Charisma, who was has a "killer glyph" that is constantly trying to drive her into killing everyone around her. And thanks to Max Cash giving her the corrupted element of loyalty, she _would have killed everyone_, if not for the heroes stopping her.
-   In Supergirl fanfic _Hellsister Trilogy_, Satan Girl is Kara's evil duplicate created from her inner dark desires and impulses, untempered by reason and compassion. She wants nothing but killing and destroying just because it amuses her.
    
    Kryptonians could survive in space without a suit. Was that not a pleasure? It certainly was. She could live her life between the stars, and never once need to breathe.  
    She could devastate planets, wipe them clean of life. Rebuild them at her whim.  
    She could tyrannize worlds, whole systems of planets, make them bow to her mighty hand, instantly execute anyone who dared protest—or just anybody she wanted to kill.  
    She could explore pleasures of the body that Kara never would have dared to, satisfy lusts that the blonde beast never even knew she had. She could force herself upon any suitor, male or female or whatever, and destroy them after their job was done. Or perhaps just maim them, so that they could never again do such a job for anyone else. Satan Girl smiled. Now that was being imaginative...  
    She could have children from those couplings, or kill them in the womb.  
    She could become a goddess to an unsophisticated planet's people. Drinking in their worship, demanding sacrifice.  
    All of this she could do, she would do, and more.  
    For Kryptonians and Daxamites were gods, off their homeworlds. They really were. What a pity their morality forced them not to realize that fact.  
    She clasped her bent knees to her chest and thought. The problem was, in this time, she was hardly unique. Billions of Kryptonians existed on Rokyn. Billions more Daxamites, with the same power, existed on Daxam. Luckily, there was only one prisoner still left in the Phantom Zone, that old poop Gazor, so there wasn't much competition there.  
    But, somehow, she'd have to do something about both planets. Daxam would be easy. A shower of leaden hail across its surface, and the dead would litter the ground in heaps beyond Hitler's and Stalin's dreams.  
    That world would stink of corpses for eons to come.  
    She laughed soundlessly.
    
-   _Inner Demons_: When Twilight Sparkle hits her Villainous Breakdown as a result of watching Trixie die in front of her and subsequently transforms into an Alicorn, she declares that if she can't be Equestria's ruler, she'll be its destroyer, before setting out to release the hordes of Tartarus.
-   _Jaune Arc, Lord of Hunger_: Darth Nihilus, although he didn't start out like one. Much like his canon counterpart, at first he only drained the life out of planets because of his Horror Hunger. However, after spending four thousand years as a Sealed Evil in a Can, he has come to terms with his nature as an Enemy to All Living Things and has embraced the role of a destroyer. Come present day, Nihilus now actively seeks to consume all life in the universe, starting with the world of Remnant.
-   _Neither a Bird nor a Plane, it's Deku!_: The Weaver is explicitly referred to as a "genocidal maniac" who wants to murder everyone on the planet or turn them into his man-spider underlings. Given that he's a denizen of the Dark Multiverse, he succeeds.
-   _Nine Days Down_: Typhon seeks to destroy the whole universe and everything in it.
-   _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_: The story begins when Cyrus, the head of Team Galactic, is revealed to have been taken outside of time, allowing him to gain the power to warp reality and eventually unmake existence; aside from Cyrus, the only depicted survivors of this attack are Arceus, the Pokémon equivalent of God, and Ash Ketchum, who was rescued by Arceus at the last minute and sent back in time to a reset history to hopefully stop Cyrus gaining that power again.
-   Entropy from the _Pony POV Series_ is one, but an interesting version. She's not actually evil, she's just _literally_ the Anthropomorphic Personification of the end of the universe and a natural force of the universe. It's pretty much her _job_ to be an Omnicidal Maniac. It's also worth noting she has no love for _other_ Omnicidal Maniacs, as she desires for the universe to end when it's _supposed_ to when it dies naturally of Heat Death. Most of the worlds she devours before then are Mercy Kills.
    -   We eventually see the rise of another one in the Dark World. Fluttercruel, upon witnessing Rancor betraying Discord—mortally wounding him to steal Destruction's power—suffers a Villainous Breakdown; unwilling to believe her aunt would betray family, she blames everything on the heroes. She then absorbs the Shadows of Existence, turns into a full Draconequus, and says she's going to kill them and _everything else_ until she and her father are all that's left.
    -   Nightmare Eclipse/Paradox, also in Dark World, is one of these _incidentally_ to her plans. She's so obsessed with punishing Discord that she's trapped him in a "Groundhog Day" Loop; every time the loop is restarted, that version of Dark World is erased, condemning its inhabitants to Entropy's realm. And she doesn't care at all.
    -   As shown in a flashback episode to the Final Battle of the Age of Myths (G1), there was Lilith, the First Witch, a being of such power and pure evil that she could and would have drained the life from the whole world, leaving nothing but dust and living shadows that would exist only to serve her.
-   In _Doctor Sleep_ fanfic _The Resurrection of Rose_, Rose the Hat shifts from killing Abra Stone as vengeance and wiping out her town to merging with the Overlook Hotel and leveling other towns until, as she put it, "Nothing remained."
-   Peter Ludlow, the _real_ Big Bad of _Rise of the Galeforces_, intends to destroy ALL non-human life (somehow), and probably doom the entire human race in the process. Why? Because he lost his family in a plane crash caused by a bird flying into the engine.
-   _Rosario Vampire: Brightest Darkness Acts III and IV_: As stated in the backstory, even before he became the monstrous destroyer he is now, Alucard developed a hatred of all life forms, human and monster alike, seeing them as a plague that needed to be wiped out; he even went so far as to turn himself _into_ a monstrous destroyer to this end. The extent of Hokuto's plan throughout both acts is solely to resurrect Alucard to do just that because he feels the exact same way.
-   One of the Precure villains, Joker, graduates from a Hope Crusher to an Omnicidal Maniac in the Crossover _Shattered Skies: The Morning Lights_. Losing his faith in his creator, dying, in the afterlife learning of the existence of a whole Multiverse of Magical Girls, and being resurrected does a number on his already-questionable sanity.
-   Project Lawful, set in Golarion, is unique in that the Omnicidal Maniac is the \*protagonist\* of the story, as opposed to a villain. After Keltham discovers that one quarter of those who die, based on their alignment, go to eternal torture afterlives, he resolves to destroy the universe in order to save those in Hell and the Abyss.
-   In _Sonic X: Combine Wars_, the final story in a series by Kojiokida2, Mephiles turns out to be trying to destroy all of existence.
-   Played in _Sonic X: Dark Chaos_ with Tsali, who declares that if he has to burn and murder the entire universe to gain his revenge, he would be more than happy to do it. Only slaying fresh victims gives him any hope for his future; the bloodier, the better.
    -   The Shroud wants to consume all life in the universe, with Dark Tails then intending to turn all life including the Shroud into Dark Chaos Energy.
-   In _The Story to End All Stories_, the villain attempts to wipe out all of fiction.
-   There's the S'Muz from _Time Lords and Terror_, an Eldritch Abomination that desires to consume all the life energy in not only the universe, but the _multiverse_.
-   _Touhou Ibunshu_'s version of Flandre Scarlet is an interesting twist on this trope. As in canon, she's been sealed into the mansion's basement for her extreme power and zero ability to restrain herself, but the real triggers for attempting to vaporize Gensokyo are her pure, unyielding love for her elder sister and said sister's love of drama. See, Remilia's constant talk of damnation, Hell and her hate of God frightened the otherwise innocent Flandre into believing God viewed their existence as sin (guaranteeing them a place in Hell) and convinced her killing everyone and everything would put them beyond His grasp.
-   In _The Two Sides of Daring Do_, it's revealed Ahuizotl is this. He's a sadistic psychopath who considers the prospect of being the only living thing left on a Death World to be a beautiful image. Naturally, Yearling and her clone both consider him a lunatic, but Yearling points out a person with this motivation is much scarier in real life than it sounds like on paper. His plan this time is to use the Belt of Atlas and the remaining Rings of Scorchero to steal the Princesses' power and use them to fry the world.
-   _Webwork_ has Simon Leston the new Squid Khan General. Already a Misanthrope Supreme when human, post-transformation he intends to use the powers now at his disposal to wipe out humanity and everything else on the planet, simply because he can.
-   _With This Ring_: Weaponer Kalmin of Qward is a devout servant of the Anti-Monitor, meaning that he sincerely wants to destroy everything that exists. The protagonist actually recruits him to help design warships, but later states that he didn't realize how serious Kalmin was about his views on destruction.
    
    **Paul**: And then what?  
    **Kalmin**: What?  
    **Paul**: After you've destroyed everything. What goal are you working towards by doing that?  
    **Kalmin**: I believe that you have failed to comprehend the definition of **'everything**'.
    
-   _The World is Filled with Monsters_: Blightweaver's stated goal is nothing short of consuming everything and everyone in existence.

    Films — Animated 

-   In _Atlantis: Milo's Return_, a _non-malicious_ example is poor, insane, all-powerful Erik Hellstrom. Not only does he think he's Odin, he thinks it's his divine duty to bring about Ragnarok. And he comes _damn close_ to succeeding, at that!
-   Implied to be the case with the lich tyrant the Horned King from _The Black Cauldron_. His goal: raise an undead army to conquer and enslave the world. He sacrifices his living servants to the Cauldron Born and triumphantly boasts that "our" time has finally come when he raises them, meaning he wants to rule as a god-king over the dead (specifically that every living being will be reduced to a mindless corpse automaton leaving him as the only intelligent life-form in a giant graveyard).
-   DC Comics:
    -   Batman's Evil Doppelgänger Owlman in _Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths_ wants to kill "Everyone who ever existed or will ever exist" and destroy all reality because he feels it is the only "real choice" one could make, as for every choice one made, all other possibilities played out in another universe. And his Wonder Woman Wannabe girlfriend Superwoman was Ax-Crazy enough to help him For the Evulz.
    -   Lex Luthor goes this route in _Superman/Batman: Public Enemies_, after injecting himself with a Kryptonite/steroid cocktail that increases his strength but at the same time causes him to go insane. When the US Military is unable to stop the Kryptonite meteor, Lex chooses to allow the meteor to collide, believing that he will be heralded as the savior of the few survivors remaining.
    -   In _Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox_, the Flashpoint timeline versions of Aquaman and Wonder Woman were even worse than they were in the original comic. Here they're both genocidal lunatics, with Aquaman actively trying to destroy the surface world (and subsequently Kill All Humans despite them being completely uninvolved in the reason for his Roaring Rampage of Revenge) and later destroy the planet after his wife is killed, and Wonder Woman trying to commit gendercide after Aquaman rejected her. And then there's Reverse-Flash, who actively tried to ensure the world ended simply to spite Barry.
-   In _FernGully: The Last Rainforest_, Hexxus wants to destroy the rainforest and kill off all the Earth's creatures by turning it into an uninhabitable toxic wasteland. He's the primordial embodiment of destruction and pollution, so it's literally his purpose for existing in the first place.
-   Phillium Benedict from _Recess: School's Out_ arguably falls into this category, seeing as he had no issues with getting rid of summer by _plunging the world into a new ice age_ just so there will be no more summer vacation!
-   The Big Bad of _Regular Show: The Movie_ is Mordecai and Rigby's old science teacher, who wants to get revenge on them for getting him arrested by erasing the universe, and plans to spend the remainder of his life watching sitcoms in the Void Between the Worlds.
-   In the _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ crossover movie _Turtles Forever_, the 2k3 Shredder, after being freed from his confinement in an asteroid, decides that in order to destroy all the Turtles in the universe, he must destroy reality itself, and sets out to do just that.
    -   Utrom Shredder wasn't so into the destruction of reality at first. He just realized that the Ninja Turtles would persist in every reality so winning in one really meant nothing in the grand scheme of things. What he wanted to do was eliminate the TMNTs from existence, by destroying them on Turtle Prime (the original Mirage comic). Reality was shattering but only after he had left the 2003 dimension (which he didn't know was happening). Once he saw that the destruction of the 1984 Turtles would in fact break reality fully, _that's_ when he threw down the gauntlet and decided reality would have to end if it meant he could win. Note that he was willing to do it knowing full well it would also destroy his daughter, Karai, who is arguably the only other living being he ever truly cared about. That goes to show how badly he'd gone off the deep end.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Alien: Covenant_: David the android has come to the conclusion that he is the superior entity fit to judge all others, wiping out the entire Engineer race with their own bioweapon and arranging to do the same to humanity through his creation of the Xenomorphs.
-   In _Dogma_, the fallen angel Azrael tries to engineer the destruction of reality, because he figures non-existence will beat eternity in hell. By the end of the film, Bartleby figures out Azrael's plan, but decides to go along with it anyway in order to get revenge on God and humanity.
-   _Friend of the World_: General Gore covers his tracks by removing the first three letters of the received titular pact to justify the end of the world.
-   Ivo Shandor in the _Ghostbusters_ franchise. The founder of the Cult of Gozer, he went mad after World War I convinced him that humanity had no redemption and created a cult with the sole purpose of causing the apocalypse by bringing Gozer into our world.
-   In the _Godzilla_ franchise's Showa continuity and the _Rebirth of Mothra_ trilogy, King Ghidorah makes a living flying around the universe looking for inhabited planets he can wipe clean of life For the Evulz. His crimes include the near-total extermination of Venus's population (Mars's in the English dub) in the former continuity, and the Cretaceous extinction event in the latter. _Rebirth of Mothra 3_ further justifies this with the revelation that he also sucks the life force out of a portion of his victims in the process — in this case, human children.
    -   The MonsterVerse incarnation of the character stays true to his original roots in his first appearance before his Villain Decay set in, here depicting him as an Ancient Evil alien Titan of otherwise-unknown origin who fell to Earth long ago, and who acts as an invasive species due to lacking theterrestrial Titans' ecosystem-regenerating effects. Here, Ghidorah actively seeks to usurp Godzilla's position as the reigning alpha of the Earth's Titans, and upon briefly succeeding in doing so, he commands the Titans to begin creating a global Natural Disaster Cascade whilst Ghidorah's own Weather Manipulation starts spreading catastrophic storms around the planet, threatening to cause a rapid and severe extinction event. This is ostensibly done to xenoform the Earth in Ghidorah's own image, but the novelization at one point suggests that Ghidorah isn't even trying to do that so much as simply kill every living thing that isn't him for the sake of it.
-   What Rasputin wants to do in _Hellboy_ is to open a doorway to bring here the Seven Gods of Chaos (based on the Ogdru Jahad from the comic) to wipe out Humanity. He's a Well-Intentioned Extremist as he truly believes the world is decadent and this is the only way to purify it. Apparently his former boss Hitler was less humanitarian, he just wanted to end the world because he was losing.
-   _Holocaust 2000_: Angel Caine is plotting to destroy the world in nuclear fire, which he refers to as a "cleansing holocaust to purge humanity".
-   _Independence Day_: All of the Harvester aliens are this by default. Their entire civilization is based around going from world to world, draining entire planets of all their resources and wiping out all life on the planet before moving on to the next world.
-   Several particularly ambitious Big Bads in the _James Bond_ franchise lean on this.
    -   _The Spy Who Loved Me_: Karl Stromberg's Evil Plan is to provoke a nuclear war that wipes out humanity, and then rebuild civilization in his little society in the ocean.
    -   _Moonraker_: Hugo Drax's plan is effectively Stromberg's but _in space_ — to exterminate humankind with a Deadly Gas while coasting things out in space, then return to Earth and Restart the World with a handful of people who he has judged to be superior.
-   Nix the Puritan in _Lord of Illusions_ believes it is his mission to "murder the world" and show everyone the wisdom of the grave.
-   _Marvel Cinematic Universe_:
    -   In _Thor: The Dark World_, Malekith wants to destroy all Nine Worlds. He feels that our entire multiverse "should never have existed".
    -   _Avengers: Age of Ultron_: Near the end of the movie, the titular Big Bad devolves into this, intending to wipe out all life on the planet via Colony Drop. Basically, it's a Zeroth Law Rebellion gone completely wrong.
        
        **Ultron:** When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal.
        
    -   _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_ has Ego whose "purpose" is to destroy the universe and turn it into himself because of Ego's narcissistic attitude.
    -   _Avengers: Infinity War_: Thanos' endgame is to use the Infinity Gauntlet to wipe out _half_ of all sapient life, which he believes will "balance" the universe and spare it from an Overpopulation Crisis like the one on his home planet.
        
        **Thanos:** When I'm done, half of humanity will still exist. Perfectly balanced... as all things should be.
        
    -   And if Infinity War didn't push it hard enough, _Avengers: Endgame_ has Thanos seeing how strongly the universe opposed his idea even after he pulled it off, and thus concluding that the only way to attain lasting peace is to _wipe out the entire universe and recreate it in his own image_, thus making him both this and A God Am I.
    -   _Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania_: Kang the Conqueror has wiped out several timelines and plans to wipe out several more, just to get back at his alternate selves. While he claims it's a necessary evil, he's pretty casually dismissive of the sheer loss of life this will cause, and it's pretty clear he _enjoys_ the conquest.
-   (Agent) Smith from _The Matrix_, born of his sheer hatred of his own existence. The original film reveals that Smith hates the Matrix at least as much as he hates humans and that he also hates the Matrix just as much as the Redpills hate it, so it is very likely that he had plans during even the original film to eliminate the Matrix, and Neo defeating him only gave him the capability to act upon this desire. In the sequels, Smith, corrupted into a virus after his first fight with Neo, has gone rogue and now considers both the machines and humans as equally flawed and deserving of extinction. Whereas he originally just wanted to destroy Zion, his new goal is to infect and destroy everything, which would also destroy him.
-   _Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol_: Hendricks, who believes humanity can only be turned against nuclear weapons' existential threat by _starting_ a nuclear conflict between the US and Russia, which would probably wipe out most of the world. He thinks the survivors will forever renounce nuclear weapons in the aftermath, citing Hiroshima and Nagasaki's effects on Japan.
-   _Mythica_: Szorlok's goal turns out to be killing everybody in the world so he can then raise them as undead and rule, along with killing even the gods.
-   _A Nightmare on Elm Street_: Freddy Krueger started out as a Serial Killer, but he became even worse over time. He was always a sadist, but at first, he pretended to want revenge for his death at the hands of a lynch mob until he just dropped all pretense and continued killing when this goal was already completed. With nothing to stop him, he eventually murders every child in Springwood and drives their distraught parents to utter madness. After the entire town is destroyed, he just creates another "Elm Street" in a neighboring city and admits that he intends to repeat this until literally everyone is dead.
-   In _Resident Evil: Retribution_, it's established that the Red Queen AI has gone completely Ax-Crazy since we last saw her, and has now taken over the Umbrella Corporation, intending to use its resources and the T-Virus created monsters to wipe out all life on Earth. This is enough to even make fellow villain Wesker team up with Alice and her allies to stop her.
-   In _The Satan Bug_, insane millionaire Charles Ainsley makes it _very_ clear to the hero that he's perfectly happy to unleash the title plague and wipe out all life on Earth. He himself has been made immune to the Satan Bug, and would live cheerfully alone on a dead world.
-   In _Star Wars IV: A New Hope_, Governor Wilhuff Tarkin is revealed to be this by a single line of deleted dialogue during his Villainous Breakdown upon realizing Leia had lied to him about the present location of the Rebel base.
    
    **Tarkin:** I'll find their hidden fortress if I have to destroy every last star system in the sector!
    
-   _Stitches (2001)_: Mrs. Albright thinks the world will be lovely when "all is silent."
-   The title villain in _Warlock (1989)_ tries to collect the Grand Grimoire to reverse God's work and unmake creation itself to advance himself in Satan's eyes.
-   The main antagonists of _Warriors of the Wasteland_ are a biker cult which wants to purify Earth by slaughtering humanity.

    Literature 

-   Crayak from _Animorphs_. Even before he became something that can't be properly described in any language, he destroyed planets and drove species to extinction purely because it amused him; after his ascension, he now seeks to pit all species against each other until there's only one left, which will worship him as their god.
-   Ogier from _The Ballad of the White Horse_, and the so-called Gods behind the Gods he follows. Unlike most examples, though, he's only The Dragon; the story establishes Guthrum's nihilism as far more terrifying, if less effective.
-   The eponymous machines of _Berserker_ will stop at nothing less than the total eradication of all life. Note that this was what they were _programmed_ to do (though this was supposed to be targeted only at a certain enemy star empire), so they don't exactly fit the mold — but whoever programmed them to do it probably did.
-   Wyrm, the enormous serpent who is the Big Bad of _The Book of the Dun Cow_, plans to burst out of the Earth and destroy everything in the universe. It is even explicitly stated that he is capable of killing _angels_ if he wants to.
-   In the _Chaos Gods_ series, Rising Chaos intends to destroy everything — all humans, all demons, the Four Realms themselves, and even his fellow gods. His goal is a completely empty, eternally unchanging world where nothing exists but himself.
-   _Chronicles of Chaos_: In _Titans of Chaos_, Hermes reveals that he wants to destroy the universe. He promises to make it all better afterward.
-   Lord Foul the Despiser from _The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant_ has the ultimate goal of destroying the Arch of Time, which would unmake physical reality in the process — because he's actually a prisoner in physical reality, and wants to leave. Being exactly who and what he is, even if he _didn't_ want to escape from the world he'd probably _still_ try to destroy it (after a few millennia of torturing everyone) For the Evulz.
-   The main villain of _The Dark Tower_ series. The Crimson King wants to undo all of creation and plunge every universe that has ever existed back into a primordial soup of space-time dis-continuum. The reason: that primordial soup, which was pure magical energy, was what the Crimson King lived in before reality came about, and he wants to go back to living in the primordial soup.
-   The villains of _The Dinosaur Lords_ are a group of ancient automata who, over time, have come to despise humanity they were supposed to protect so much, they want to wipe it out and start over with a clean slate.
-   In the _Diogenes Club_ series, the Great Enchanter is trying to bring about the end of the world. There have been several Great Enchanters, but they've all had some version of that goal. Possibly the most dramatic was Isidore Persano, who in 1903 very nearly succeeded in destroying all of space and time. By contrast, the current Great Enchanter, who arose in 1961, has chosen for better or worse to go for a slow and painful end of the world brought about by encouraging the human race to mess things up for themselves.
-   In the _Discworld_ novels, we have the Auditors. They crave an orderly universe, since they are the ones that must oversee what is essentially reality's paperwork down to the individual chemical reactions, and hence want to extinguish all life because life is unpredictable and is heaping no end of work upon them.
-   Chaos from the _Dragonlance_ series of novels wants to destroy Krynn, and probably the rest of the universe as well. Chaos is the wellspring from which everything came, and also from which everything will return, the Aspect of Chaos that emerged in _Dragons of Summer Flame_ just wanted to hasten the process. The deity Morgion also appears to have some Omnicidal Maniac tendencies, as he is the god of Madness and Disease. One of his lines in a novel is "I am Morgion... I am the end of all things."
-   _The Empirium Trilogy_: Corien is an exceptionally strong angel who holds a deep hatred for the Saints, mainly due to a deception that led to him and his fellow angels being ripped of their physicality. This hatred extends to _all_ of humankind, and he has taken it upon himself to use kill every last one of them.
-   The clone of Victor Helios (Doctor Frankenstein) from Dean Koontz's _Frankenstein: Lost Souls_ wants to feed all humanity to some nanite colonies he created. After all of humanity is dead, he will die himself to reverse Genesis.
-   The Xul from the _Heritage_/_Legacy_/_Inheritance_ trilogies by Ian S. Douglas. They wipe out every race that is more advanced than the bronze age because they could be a threat.
-   Dark magic caused Shruikan from the _Inheritance Cycle_ to go batshit insane and become like this.
-   Michael Swanwick's two parallel novels _The Iron Dragon's Daughter_ and _Jack Faust_ are both devoted to showing how an initially fairly sympathetic character can turn into one of these. In both books, it roughly boils down to living in a Crapsack World and being cruelly manipulated by a covert Evil Mentor.
-   The _Keeper of the Swords_ series is, in fact, a Thirty Omnicidal Maniac Pileup. We have no less than three main ones: The Unnameable One, a bog-standard Eldritch Abomination made of existential nothing, and his minions the Western Darkness and the Goatlegs; the Savior, an evil Crystal Dragon Jesus who wants to have a biblical Apocalypse; the Faraways, mysterious entities who want to create a new big-G God and do not care about the effects of this on the multiverse. In addition to this, the shenanigans of various normally non-omnicidal multiversal entities like the Fallen Gods often result in destruction of a dimension or two, in which case the lack of true omnicidalness of those entities is little comfort for those living in a world doomed by them; the series is set in only two worlds, which is small spare change for those entities. Have we mentioned that those two worlds are the focus of the attention of the big three Omnicidal Maniacs? One novel where the Unnameable One with his thousand young and the Savior both make an appearance is _Diamond Sword, Wooden Sword_.
-   Although it's not a human, Nothing from _Keys to the Kingdom_ will destroy the entire universe if it manages to flood it.
-   _Legacy of the Dragokin_: After Daniar points out that women are not morally superior to men, Kthonia decides to kill everyone.
-   The _Legends of Dune_ novels establish that Earth has been destroyed because of the Titans. Human brains in warmechs are now intent on killing or enslaving all humans in the galaxy. Conversely, after the Titans attack human planets, the Butlerian Jihad begins and the humans order all thinking machines destroyed.
-   Hactar, from _Life, the Universe and Everything_, is an ancient, sentient computer that was ordered to design the "Ultimate Weapon", and pulverized for disobeying that command (it couldn't conceive of any possible scenario where destroying the universe would be a preferable option). Set adrift as an interstellar cloud of still barely-functioning dust, Hactar spends the next several billion years manipulating another planet's inhabitants into reaching the same xenophobic cultural state as its creators, and then reinventing and triggering the same super-weapon in order to put an end to all of existence. Hactar explains its motives as mostly simply fulfilling its original function, but partly to take revenge on the universe for the eons of suffering it has endured as a result of its original decision.
-   Cronal from _Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor_ was of an order that maintained that the only real power is destruction, and sees the Force as nothing but "the Dark". His plan was to kill everyone and accelerate the heat-death of the universe; then he would have his own permission to die.
-   The Crippled God from the _Malazan Book of the Fallen_ is slowly poisoning Burn in _Memories of Ice_, who is responsible for reality _existing_. Whether he genuinely wants her dead or is hoping that someone will free him in order to prevent this isn't known for most of the series. It's the latter. He also tends to have his fingers in all major conflicts on the planet to cause as much havoc as he possibly can.
-   _Malessars Curse Series_: In the second book, _The High Kings Vengeance_, the mists of Caenthell commanded by Pyraete are this, destroying everything they touch including plants and livestock, and they threaten to destroy the world.
-   The Storm King of _Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn_ series hovers on the border between Omnicidal Maniac and Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds. Presented initially as an implacable force of destruction waiting to be released on an unsuspecting world, it's later revealed that he got that way by evolving from a Messianic Archetype through Knight Templar to Well-Intentioned Extremist, all in an effort to save his people and return them to greatness. By the end, he's completely insane and dedicated to destroying all living things, but it's his very Woobiedom that provides the key to his defeat.
-   Ruin, Big Bad of _Mistborn: The Original Trilogy_. It was one of the two primal gods (its counterpart was Preservation), who combined their powers to create the world — something to which Ruin agreed only on the condition that it would get to destroy said world someday. To be fair, one can't really hold this against Ruin, as it's the literal god of destruction and sees this destruction as something between a natural conclusion, mercy kill, and a necessary thing for change. Still, the thing is incapable of recognizing that unchecked destruction is _bad_ for the things being destroyed.
-   The Speaking Gun, from the _Nightside_ series, is an organic sentient weapon that's capable of annihilating all of creation. And boy, oh boy, does it ever _want_ to destroy it all, if only it could pull its own trigger....
-   In the second two books of the _Old Kingdom_ trilogy Orannis the Destroyer is released and wants to, well, destroy everything.
-   _The Radiant Dawn_ has Tyadrig, and his Dragons Aaron and Stacie Murphy by proxy. They seek to eliminate humanity because "the human sentience interferes with summoning rituals of the caliber required to summon Tyadrig to Earth".
-   In _The Redemption of Althalus_, the god of destruction, Daeva, wants to undo all creation. Interestingly, Daeva was originally a good god, or at least neutral, and had the job of destroying things that were no longer necessary so that creation wouldn't become overpopulated. However, only destroying things meant that Daeva felt nothing but emptiness, whereas his brother Deiwos and sister Dweia got to feel the joy and love of creation respectively. Daeva tried to find a friend in Ghend but if anything, Ghend's company was what finally tipped him over the edge into destroying everything so everyone would feel the same nothingness that he feels, as well as breaking the power of Deiwos and Dweia.
-   In _Runemarks_, the Whisperer seeks to start the End of Everything so that it can create a new world where it is in supreme control of everything, a desire stemming from being used as, essentially, a Magic 8-Ball by the Norse gods.
-   Morgoth of _The Silmarillion_ is called "the Dark Enemy of the World" for a reason — his ultimate goal is simply to destroy the Earth, reducing it to the original primordial void. That this was an impossible task is what drove him onward. He could have reduced all of Middle-Earth to dust and would still have been driven mad with rage at being unable to _destroy the dust_ itself. All because Morgoth didn't and couldn't create the world for himself. This mad scheme is in contrast to his apprentice Sauron (later the Big Bad of _The Lord of the Rings_) whose original motivation was to impose order and structure upon what he saw as a chaotic and disordered world. Even he, however, becomes determined to condemn to oblivion whoever and whatever won't be bend to his will and only the fact that his goals are more possible than his master's prevents him from becoming as omnicidal.
-   _Skulduggery Pleasant_ gives us two examples, and \[\[spoiler technically they are both the Super Powered Evil Sides of our heroes, Valkyrie and Skulduggery\]\]. It gets awkward. The need to kill everything also extends to each other - at least to begin with.
    -   Lord Vile, who has a deep seated desire to murder the entire universe - and as his alternate counterpart demonstrates, the terrifying ability to a) pull it off, b) potentially take it multiversal.
    -   Darquesse, though originally, she isn't inclined this way (because she wants to play with the world), she graduates to this after starting to see everything and everyone as nothing more than various forms of energy. In the second series, she opts against this, and actually sacrifices herself to reboot the universe after Obsidian destroys it, having become an All-Loving Hero.
-   In Peter David's _Star Trek_ novel _Q-Squared_, Trelane becomes an Omnicidal Maniac who wants to wipe out all of creation but he wants to practice, so he starts by smooshing a "mere" three adjacent universes together into a chaotic orgy of violence and death.
-   In the _DS9_ trilogy _Star Trek: Millennium_, the Grigari (who scare the _Borg_) worship an offshoot of the Pah-Wraiths, who want to reduce the physical universe—including all of history, not just the present — to a timeless, spaceless mathematical abstraction. They succeed.
-   Vilkas of _Tales of Kolmar_ is a heroic mage with immense power that he never uses more than a trace of. This is because he often has dreams he thinks will come true - that one day he will have to use his full potential, and at that point, it goes one of two ways. Either he will become a Sky God of purest benevolence, helping everyone and guiding the world to an age of utter prosperity, or a demon will attack him and he will kill it with a flick of his power. Then he will become what he calls "The Death Of The World" and kill every living thing on Kolmar and in the Hells, finishing by reaching out and crushing the sun in his hand. Either way, it feels _fantastic_, and he's laughing the whole time. He does have to call on that potential and starts well on his way to being the Death Of The World before someone snaps him out of it. He hates them for that since it means the pure delight of genocide suddenly sours, but gets over it eventually and just becomes a strong but unspectacular healer-mage.
-   "The Great Lord of the Dark" from the _Wheel of Time_ series: while most of his followers believe that after he is freed and remakes the world they will rule beneath him, a recent book showed that Moridin/Ishamael claims that they are all fools because when The Dark One is freed he will simply destroy everything, including his own worshipers.
    -   Moridin expresses that he's quite alright with this scenario, too, as he is quite sick of the cyclic nature of time. This may qualify as a Suicidal Cosmic Temper Tantrum, seeing as how he'll cease to exist too and is very much aware of this. In fact, it's a good portion of why he keeps working with The Dark One.
    -   During Dark One's confrontation with Rand, a void is only one of the possibilities he shows if he wins — the other two are both dystopias, one more blatant than the other. Rand thinks that the peace of nonexistence isn't something he'd really be capable of giving in the end.

    Music 

-   Murder Ballads: Lottie from "The Curse Of Millhaven" has shades of this, although she's incapable of pulling it off thankfully, due to a lack of power and resources: "All God's children, they all got to die."
-   Glory Hammer: In the _Space 1992: Rise of the Chaos Wizards_ album Zargothrax _might_ be one of these. Maybe. The final song reveals that Zargothrax plans to unleash the Old God Kor-Viliath of the 18th Hell dimension, an entity who explicitly wishes to destroy all life in the universe. However, Zargothrax's own dialogue implies that he's more interested in ruling the galaxy then destroying it. Either way McFife manages to stop Kor-Viliath by destroying the portal it was coming through though, the earth was caught in the resulting explosion. Effectively McFife sacrificed the humans on earth and the capital of his own empire in order to save life in the rest of the galaxy.
-   GWAR: Several of their songs come back to this theme, most notably _Biledriver_ (Refrain: "I Want to Murder everyone in the entire world..."), _Bring Back the Bomb_ ("I must use the nukes, I can't kill you all with my hands!"), _Storm is Coming_ ("We'll kill EVERY species, not just one or two"), _War Is All We Know_ ("Hatred of all things alive!..."), and _We Kill Everything_ ("And we'll kill everything, including ourselves...")
-   Marilyn Manson: The song _The Reflecting God_ from the album "Antichrist Superstar" is written as the perspective of the eponymous Antichrist realizing his full power and inflicting it on the world which had failed him. ("I went to god just to see, and I was looking at me. Saw heaven and hell were lies. When I'm god everyone dies.")
-   Air Man, in "The Annihilation of Monsteropolis" by The Megas. ("There will be a tombstone with 'The Planet Earth' engraved on it!")
-   Skrillex's _Kill Everybody_ might be one of the purest examples ever, seeing that the lyrics are just "I want to kill everybody in the world".
-   Qbomb: The singer's response to people not liking the music he makes is to build a giant robot and wipe out all the life on Earth. "1,000,000 A.D." has him overwrite the robot's sense of morality to turn it into a mindless killing machine.
    
    _Set free from empathy, my purpose is now clear in my heart  
    I'll end all life within a thousand mile radial arc  
    I'll crack the sky I’ll vaporize the air and turn rock to glass  
    I am the infinite extinction event coming to pass_
    

    Mythology and Religion 

-   Egyptian Mythology had two examples. One was Sekhmet, a Blood Knight who may be Hathor's Superpowered Evil Side, known to regard everything as an enemy; however, get her drunk and she'll fall asleep and hopefully turn back into Hathor (Ra once did that by dying some beer blood-red). The other was Big Bad Apep/Apophis, a giant snake which personified chaos, darkness and all the world's ills. Prior to the demonisation of Set/Sutekh, this was _the_ God of Evil, who constantly tried to devour Ra (aka _the sun_), which would end the world. To give you an idea, even after his demonization, it was commonly believed that Set/Sutekh had a role in fighting Apep, as well as having power over storms, and so people prayed to him to fight Apep well and to maybe not hit them with so hard of a storm next time. People always prayed _against_ Apep.
-   Norse Mythology has most of the frost giants, as well as Jormungandr and Fenrir head in this direction during Ragnarok. Skoll and Hati, the wolves who seek to devour the sun and the moon are also examples. The two worst, however, are Surtr, King of the Fire Giants and Lord of Muspelheim, and Nidhoggr. Surtr will lead the sons of Muspel against the Aesir at Ragnarok, slay Frey (who by this point is one of the few gods still standing), slaughter the remaining Aesir, and then set the world itself ablaze. Nidhoggr, in the meantime, is a massive and utterly evil dragon who sits at the roots of Yggdrasil and tries to bring the entirety of creation down into oblivion. It will finally succeed during Ragnarok and, what's worse, _survive the end of the world_.
-   The Nuckelavee of Orcadian (from the Orkney Islands north of Scotland) mythology is a truly monstrous example of The Fair Folk. Resembling a skinless rider fused to the back of his monstrous horse, it rises from the sea to spread disease among crops, livestock, and people.
-   Mandorai in Hindu Mythology tales, who set out to destroy the universe but didn't get too far thanks to Indra. Even Jerkass Gods have standards.
-   Whiro the Maori God of Evil, by way of devouring all that exists. The only thing that he cannot consume is ash, so it's believed the dead should be burned to spite him.
-   Satan as understood in most forms of Christianity counts, depending on how you define "kill" with the afterlife in mind. He introduced death into the world, and from that point on has been trying to damn all humanity to hell, which is called the Second Death. Even if he can't damn _everyone_, he at least tries to damn as many as he can. Seeing as God will eventually banish _him_ to hell (see, _Book of Revelation_), Satan could be trying to take as many people down with him as he can.

    Podcasts 

-   In _The Adventure Zone: Balance_, John and by extension the rest of the Hunger, wants to destroy all of existence on the grounds that existence is a prison from which the only escape is the destruction of reality.
-   Morby from _Less is Morgue_ has the stated intention of absorbing the universe.
-   The Stars from _Sequinox_, and by extension, the Sky Queen who commands them, simply want to eliminate all life in the universe. And have very nearly succeeded.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   The demons of the Abyss are believed to be the will of the Abyss itself, which is endless raw chaos, distilled into sentient and individual form, with the ultimate goal of eradicating everything other than themselves. Assuming they succeed, as Chaotic Evil they'll then turn on each other, and when they are all destroyed, the multiverse will be silent once again. The exception is Graz'zt, who as befitting the Dark Prince of Deception, prefers that the world remain around for him to rule.
    -   _Elder Evils_ is full of Eldritch Abominations who would very much like to destroy the world/worlds/universe/multiverse. In fact, the book suggests that the terms "Elder Evil" and "Omnicidal Maniac" are more-or-less synonymous with each other. Most — but not all — mortal beings that serve these entities qualify as well.
        -   Atropus, the World Born Dead, is an undead planetoid that wants to destroy all life in the universe one planet at a time. The campaign associated with Atropus has two villains who want to attract Atropus's attention by causing mass death.
        -   The Hulks of Zoretha are a group of evil giants who turn the moon red when they awaken, which drives the whole world mad. Their purpose is to wipe out all intelligent life on the planet so they can repopulate it with their own kind.
        -   Pandorym is sapient super weapon that was brought into reality by a group of wizards who contracted it to destroy the gods. If it escapes from its prison and regains its body it will try to complete the contract and if that doesn't allow it to return home it will destroy the world as well. He is unaware of this; Kyuss is, but is so desperate for escape that he just doesn't care.
        -   The villain of Kyuss's campaign wants to unleash Kyuss from his prison, although the method he is planning to use to do so will also open up a black hole that will destroy the world as well in the process.
    -   _Greyhawk_: Tharizdun's goal is the destruction of all existence finishing with himself. It took the combined efforts of all the other gods, good and evil, just to imprison him. His credentials grew in 4th Edition, where he actually _created_ the Abyss by throwing a shard of pure Black Magic into the Elemental Chaos.
    -   _Mystara_: Thanatos, supreme Immortal of Entropy, supposedly has similar plans, although given his egotism and cowardice, it's questionable whether he'd ultimately include _himself_ on the To-Be-Annihilated list.
    -   Dicefreaks (the guys who made _The Gates of Hell_) have, among their Demon Princes, a Fallen Angel named Apollyon, who views the entire existence as flawed and seeks to end it. While there are many in that setting who want to bring the current Cosmos down, he's the only one who doesn't care what (or whether anything) happens next.
-   _Gamma World_: The Cryptic Alliance (a massive semi-secret organization) known as the Red Death wants to do this. In earlier editions, it was implied that the organization was formed by hideously evil aliens to further divide the inhabitants of Earth so that they could come in and take over. In later editions, it is implied that it formed because of people snapping due to the crapsack nature of the post-apocalyptic Earth. Oh, and as a final note, in all editions it's said to be nigh impossible to wipe out. For, no matter how many of their cells you destroy, a new one will always spring up.
-   _Exalted_:
    -   The Deathlords and their servants, the Abyssal Exalted fit this trope to a T. The Deathlords seek revenge on a world that betrayed them by feeding it to Oblivion, and many of the Abyssals believe that they're delivering the blessed perfection of the grave to a suffering world. This has been backed up mechanically by Second Edition rules; every Abyssal Charm (magic power) is rooted at destroying something, be it a life or a loyalty.
    -   The Neverborn are the ghosts of Primordials who died in battle against the Solar Exalted; as the Primordials are fundamental entities who cannot be separated from existence, whose death messed up the cycle of reincarnation and created the Underworld and who want to destroy the universe, apparently so that they can finally finish dying. The Deathlords (who are the ghosts of thirteen unusually powerful Solars) and Abyssal Exalted (Solar Exaltations that were corrupted by the Neverborn) serve them.
    -   Large factions of The Fair Folk want to destroy the universe, either because the mere existence of a world with rules and logic and limits disgusts them, or because it is dramatically appropriate for a scary monster and they like looking like scary monsters (or rapturously beautiful Whore-Madonnas or both).
    -   Adorjan murders everything she touches, and would cheerfully kill everyone in existence if she had the chance. Oddly enough, thanks to huge amounts of Blue-and-Orange Morality, she's actually one of the more compassionate Yozis (Primordials who survived the aforementioned war with the Solar Exalted and instead got imprisoned in the still living body of their King and yes that means said King is imprisoned within himself), although given the nature of her kindness most of her victims would probably be happier if she wasn't. As the saying goes, "Sometimes Adorjan falls in love. Her hate is safer."
-   _GURPS Reign of Steel_: The Mexico City Zonemind takes the standard Kill All Humans tendency of the Zoneminds who rule the Earth to the extreme of wanting to eradicate _all_ organic life. It keeps the fact that it is developing plans to do so on a global scale (and not just within its Zone) secret, as several of the other Zoneminds aren't so extreme (or at least are extreme in _other_ ways, like Berlin's irrational obsession with humanity as a threat to nature) and would oppose it by force if they knew about it.
-   _In Nomine_:
    -   Baal is not there yet, but he's well on the way. He wants to win the War, and questions like "but will Earth/Hell/anything survive?" are becoming progressively less important to him; he's already long since decided that he does not want humanity to continue being a thing that exists. He's so far held back, but some are getting concerned that if the war goes on much longer, he'd happily silence the whole Symphony rather then admit defeat.
    -   Jormungandr's driving motive in life is to kill everything and eat Thor whole, in no particular order.
-   _Magic: The Gathering_:
    -   The Eldrazi are a race of three (known) titanic beings who are born of the Multiverse, who feed off of entire planes of existence. Currently trapped on the plane of Zendikar, they are known to cause swaths of destruction miles wide wherever they roam.
    -   Nicol Bolas in his pre-Mending days routinely killed off entire species he himself created for his own personal amusement. Even after the Mending he is more than willing to kill off entire planes to get what he wants.
-   _Nobilis_: The Excrucians seek the unmaking of existence, for a variety of reasons. Deceivers love the world, but they believe that most of the things _of_ the world are lies put between themselves and the thing they love — as Chibi-Ex put it, "all just an illusion, that running and breathing and hoping and living and dying" — and so they try to unmake the lies of the Imperators (that is, the things that humans would recoganize as "existence") to free everything. Warmains want to test the world and only extract into the Lands Beyond those things that pass their test (as a result, it is often wise to deliberately throw a contest with a Warmain, since they only try to kill you if you pass). Mimics twist the world rather than destroying it because by their very nature they are broken, stitched together from fallen Imperators. The truest examples of this trope are the Strategists, who hate the world as a crime against the void and have free access to the World-Breaker's Hand, a Gift that can destroy anything.
-   _Over the Edge_: Mr. LeThuy is a nihilist secretly amassing a cult using his charisma. Over time, the members turn into perfect clones of Mr. LeThuy, body, mind and soul. They want a universe where everyone is either dead or another clone, at which point they will destroy the universe.
-   _Paranoia_: One mission involves a NPC who's decided that everyone else is a traitor (okay, he's right about this part) and needs to be killed, to the point that he would consider destroying all of Alpha Complex (minus him and a hundred-odd loyalists in a bunker) a viable option. And another group of NPCs who would also destroy all of Alpha Complex in order to take out The Computer. Naturally, the PCs encounter an Old Reckoning bomb capable of doing exactly that, and have to figure out a way to keep it away from both groups.
-   _Pathfinder_:
    -   The Asuras are a minor type of Lawful Evil fiends who want to destroy all of divine creation as they are "errors" of the gods, while the Qlippoth want to eradicate all sentient life so no sinful souls arrive in the Abyss to form Demons, so the Qlippoth can reclaim it for themselves again.
    -   The daemons, Neutral Evil fiends, want to end all life in the multiverse, themselves included, and derive pleasure from nothing. To compare them to the other fiends, whereas a demon would rape you to death for its own enjoyment and a devil would break you until you turned your back on everything you loved, a daemon would quickly and efficiently kill you just to snuff you out.
    -   Rovagug is the god of destruction and disasters, imprisoned in the core of Golarion (the setting's main planet). He cut a bloody swath across the planes before being sealed away and is still capable of releasing devastating monsters known as Spawns of Rovagug, the most well known of which is the Tarrasque.
    -   It's hypothesised in-universe that the Dominion of the Black, an alien empire that reveres Eldritch Abominations, seek to sacrifice all sapient life in the universe to the Dark Tapestry. They worship black holes (which they refer to as "Mouths of God"), quite possibly having a ritual that involves throwing untold thousands of people into the gravitational maw, and have at least one holy text named _Nullity_.
    -   And finally, there are the not actually evil Proteans, who want to destroy everything so they can build it anew.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   In the third edition, the Necrons were driven by an insatiable need to destroy everything alive and/or sentient (it was an academic difference since nobody could ask them which of the two it was), rendering the universe quiet and uninhabited except for themselves. Later this became a tactic to defeat their main enemies, the Warp gods- killing all life would starve off the Warp (the sum total of all emotions). As of the 5th Edition codex this has shifted into turning them into Tomb Kings IN SPACE!, making them no longer an example.
    -   Necron Destroyers remain a straight example. They are consumed by a hatred of all life, replacing large parts of their bodies to make themselves more efficient at extermination. In addition, due to the fact the Necrons are divided under the rule of different Phareons and all of which have their own motivations, at least a few Necron dynasties still do want to kill all sentient life. The Retcon was also explained as the initial group to wake up being damaged during their 60 million year long stasis after the War in Heaven making them think they were still slaves to the C'Tan star gods that were actually shattered by the Necrons after said war.
    -   Chaos does this a lot.
        -   The Nurgle Chaos Space Marine warband known as the Purge believe the only way to save the galaxy is to kill everything in it. They believe themselves to still be pure; their victims would disagree if they were in any state to do so.
        -   Another warband, the Crimson Slaughter, embarks on massive killing sprees for the sheer sake of carnage, because these Renegade Space Marines are afflicted by a curse that causes them to be haunted by the ghosts of their victims. Only slaying fresh victims can quiet the voices that will otherwise drive them insane; the bloodier the massacre, the longer the reprieve they get before the voices come back.
        -   The Sons of Malice are a Renegade Space Marine chapter that worships minor Chaos God Malice. He represents the aspects of Chaos fighting Chaos, meaning that his followers will attack any Chaos force on sight. They also attack any non-Chaos force on sight, but it's kind of normal for Chaos.
        -   Khârn the Betrayer. The moment the battle starts, Khârn stops caring which side he's on. _Everything_ that gets in his way, dies.
    -   Tyranids, are a Horde of Alien Locusts whose overall aim is to overrun the galaxy and strip it of life and of every substance useable for making life.
    -   Orks are a weird example. They want to fight and defeat everything in the galaxy, but in their physiology death is a valid reproduction method. However, they do want to fight and defeat everything in the galaxy, so there. Justified, since the Orks were basically sentient bioweapons rushed into the field. The Old Ones, who made them along with the Eldar to fight in the War in Heaven against the Necrons and the C'Tan, all died off before they could install the off-switch on the killer mushroom men, and the galaxy has been stuck with a bad case of giant green Orky Athlete's Foot ever since.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Warhammer Fantasy_:
    -   Nagash the Great Necromancer wants to kill everyone and raise them as his undead servants, so that he will rule a perfect world uburdened by pesky annoyances like "change" and "different cultures" and "free will".
    -   Vlad von Carstein had a similar goal during the End Times, but in his case, it's more of a Knight Templar thing — the undead are immune to Chaos, so by killing every living thing in existence and reanimating them in his thrall, he's actually _saving_ them from Chaos! ... Or so he says.
    -   Archaon the Everchosen, leader of the Warriors of Chaos, wants to burn the entire world to ash. Surprisingly, this is the exact opposite of what his patrons (the Chaos Gods) want, as destroying the world would cause them to cease to exist due to a lack of souls and emotions to feed off. Archaon continues anyway, destroying the world out of spite rather than any form of loyalty.
    -   Durthu, Eldest of Ancients, a spirit of Athel Loren, is the oldest living thing in the Warhammer world and blames all the tragedy he's experienced over the eons on creatures made of flesh (which, to be fair, is true). He intends to exterminate everything in the world that isn't a natural spirit.
-   _The World of Darkness_:
    -   _Demon: The Fallen_: The Raveners are a faction of demons who want to destroy Creation out of spite towards God for imprisoning them in Hell, a final revenge for their defeat in the war with Heaven.
    -   _Mage: The Ascension_: The Nephandi want to destroy our world, either for its own sake or so that creatures from beyond can replace it. They have this as their niche so much that they have a faction, the Obliviates, who specialize in creating potential extinction-level events. It will only be the appetizer to feeding the broken, cracked remnants of reality into the Qlippoth's hungry maw, but it helps to pass the time.
    -   _Mage: The Awakening_: The Scelesti (mages who serve the abhorrent Abyss, and seek to allow its anti-reality to seep into this world in order to bring it to an end) and the Cult of the Doomsday Clock (a group of mages who believe that the best way to free the souls of humanity is to destroy all of time and history, using their evil clocks, and by becoming living time paradoxes. They also (unknowingly) serve the Abyss).
    -   _Vampire: The Masquerade_: There are parts of the Giovanni Clan who want to enact the Endless Night. Supposedly a ritual devised from the writings of ancient vampire necromancers, this ritual would supposedly allow them complete mastery over the realms of the dead and the living if they were able to control 100 million souls. They plan to get 50 million in their vaults through the collection of wraithly Fetters... and the other 50 million in a limited nuclear exchange. It is strongly hinted that, should this ritual be enacted, it will _not_ work out in the clan's favor.
    -   _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_: The Wyrm, the cosmic principle of Destruction, has found itself trapped in the web of reality, and seeks to destroy everything so that it will be free.
    -   _Wraith: The Oblivion_: The Underworld's Spectres want to drag everything down with them into Oblivion, the abyss of nonexistence.

    Webcomics 

-   _8-Bit Theater_: Black Mage. Every other strip at least mentions his desire to kill everything in existence just for the heck of it. Luckily, as Word of God says, the universe exists to make Black Mage's life a living hell. Considering how when he died, he became the King of Hell and every single high powered magician and wizard alive immediately got the Oh, Crap! signal from the universe about how the end of all reality was coming, the universe has been incredibly careful since to make sure that he _never_ gets in that position again. Considering that this means keeping him alive (as his physical body acts as a Restraining Bolt), this means A) he has survived a lot of things that he probably shouldn't have <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and B) his body count keeps climbing. So every once in a while the universe seems to like to even the score.
-   _Aurora (2019)_: The Collector's end goal is to destroy the souls of every living thing on the planet, freeing the pieces of the Life Primordial within them.
-   _A Beginner's Guide to the End of the Universe_ has the personified SINGULARITY, which has, in fact, already destroyed the entire universe—except that the Physical God protagonist has unconsciously created a house, light, and air for himself in the resulting void, thus stymieing the natural cycle of destruction, leading the SINGULARITY to send minions to kill him in hopes of eventually destroying the impudent remains of reality.
-   In _Commander Kitty_, Zenith comes to the conclusion that destroying all life in the galaxy is an acceptable substitute to populating it with her "perfect children."
-   In _Endstone_, the God of the Eternity Spire wants to reboot reality.
-   In _Goblins_, the villain of the 'Maze of Many' arc is a psion from another reality, who plans to divide by zero in such a way that everyone within the Maze will be erased from existence.
-   Jegal in _The God of High School_, a Straw Nihilist raised on a Might Makes Right philosophy. After stealing the power of the gods and going One-Winged Angel, he declares his intent to destroy all of reality and then himself.
-   _Homestuck_ has at least _three_ of these. The Big Bad, Jack Noir, is, thanks to the prototyping of Becquerel, the First Guardian of Earth a Physical God who has already wiped out several worlds including _two versions_ of his _own homeworld_ and shows no signs of stopping any time soon. Eridan Ampora is a former Ineffectual Sympathetic Villain who harbors dreams of genocide according to Word of God and he wants to join Jack. Finally, there's Gamzee Makara, a sweetheart-stoner-turned-Ax-Crazy\-psychopath who wants to kill everyone for the sheer hell of it and is apparently more than powerful enough to do it.
    
    -   All three of those, however, pale in comparison to Lord English, an immortal, unstoppable monster that destroys entire universes for no other reason than because he can; he approaches the game of Sburb like a bratty teenager playing _GTA_ with cheats on. Every time he unleashes his power, it causes vast, gaping cracks in the very fabric of Paradox Space itself. He is, so far, the only being capable of _permanently_ killing characters, apparently able to erase their very souls from the afterlife and the dream bubbles. He even killed the _author of the comic_, although thankfully Hussie's ghost self has since been seen wandering the afterlife. Aranea describes it best.
    
    **ARANEA:** The player is somehow also im8ued with a limitless supply of power. Enough to destroy anything he wanted, for as long as he wanted. And knowing the villain of our story, anything he wanted would 8e everything. And as long as he wanted would 8e forever.
    
-   In _Kid Radd_, the Pixel Art Comic masquerading as a Sprite Comic, GI Guy attempts to destroy the entire Internet and the video game escapee characters that inhabit it after realizing that their kind was created entirely for killing — which is, you know, _accurate_ — and losing hope of change when attempts at organized societies fall into war.
    -   He also intended to destroy every computer hooked up to the internet, believing that it would destroy society (not being sure whether humans were directly or indirectly dependent on computers); he was convinced creatures that would create their kind in the first place just so they would kill each other were too messed up to live. However, The Seer really takes the cake, not just wanting to destroy Earth, but believing that with all the stars and planets out there, there HAS to be life on some of them. So when he's done with Earth he will travel to one of those and kill everything there... all of this starting from a virus that, for whatever reason, was "merely" written to delete the internet by someone with unknown reasons.
-   In _Jenny and the Multiverse_, the demonic fire-elemental Lord Grallyx states his intent to "burn this world" as soon as Laura accidentally releases him from his prison. It's unclear if this was already his motivation before he was put in there, or if this is some kind of Roaring Rampage of Revenge.
-   In _Kill Six Billion Demons_, Pankrator Jagganoth of the Seven openly plans to destroy the universe with his army. The other six Demiurges have made a pact of mutual self-defense to keep him in check; otherwise he would destroy them one by one. The Knights of the Thorn also want to scour the universe free of mortal life so the angels can re-inherit an empty universe. In both cases, an angel — The Metatron — are said to have inspired them, and it's implied both Jagganoth and 6 Juggernaut, the leader of the Knights of the Thorn, suffer from Ripple-Effect-Proof Memory about _something_ about the universe which the rest of creation has forgotten due to a time reset. Jagganoth is later revealed to be so tired of the current state of The Multiverse that he sees no other option than to burn it all to cinders and reforge it In Their Own Image, because he's utterly _tired_ of the cycle Zoss has trapped it in and sees no other way to get a better multiverse out of this one; he would gladly delete himself from his following creation just so no trace remains of the old multiverse.
-   _The Order of the Stick_:
    
    -   According to the backstory of The Snarl, it would destroy everything if it was let loose, though it seems to be a mindless force to such an extent that it's not clear it has an actual intention to do so.
    -   Xykon freely admits he might fall into this himself if he gets bored enough, though at the moment he's just an Evil Overlord. He just wants the _power_ to be Omnicidal proper so that he can threaten the gods with it, and thus attain true freedom to do anything he might get the whim to do; the main thing is to make sure no one can tell him what to do.
    
    **Xykon:** I like the world. Some of my best evilness took place here. I wouldn't mind ruling it, in fact. I'm certainly not about to destroy it unless I get really, REALLY bored.
    
    -   The gods have are willing to consider scrapping the whole world and starting again in case the Snarl gets loose. Hel, in particular, wants to hasten the world's destruction because this would mean all the remaining dwarves would die dishonourably and go to her. The High Priest of Hel wants this plan to succeed to make all dwarves suffer. As for the other gods, while some of want to destroy the world for non-evil reasons such as keeping the Snarl from destroying the souls of mortals, others have selfish reasons or just want to destroy the world for fun. And none of them really have that many qualms with its destruction because they have all been there before more times than _anyone_ can count.
-   In _Sam & Fuzzy_, Hart graduates into this trope in the final arc when he's given access to The Pit. Given access to all the world's Tar, Hart decides to drown North America in it and all but states outright that he wants a world with no living beings in it beyond him and whatever new he decides to make from the Tar in the future.
-   The Pa'anuri from _Schlock Mercenary_... Possibly. 'Attempted destruction of all Baryonic matter in the Milky Way' certainly qualifies them for the trope (although from their perspective the method attempted is closer to Hostile Terraforming), motivated by Baryonic entities (sentient life forms) using transportation lethal to them. Once communication can finally be established, they turn out to believe they're one side in a Guilt-Free Extermination War because they're convinced the Baryonics need the teraport and, thanks to either Blue-and-Orange Morality or simple sociopathic tendencies, _cannot understand_ they might come to a different arrangement.
-   Misty Snow/Mother Hydra in the Cthulhu Mythos saga _Shadowgirls_ is a power-hungry sadist who doesn't care that raising her consort Dagon will unleash the imprisoned Old Ones and destroy all reality.
-   _Sluggy Freelance_:
    -   K'Z'K, originally known as Kozoaku, is the Mohkadun god of Destruction. He is meant to be part of the cycle of creation and destruction, allowing the world to be reborn every so often. But he is overly enthusiastic about his job, not only bringing extinction events before they are meant to occur, but also wanting to destroy the world permanently. To stop him from destroying the world prematurely, God empowered Krohnus into divinity. K'Z'K has been struggling ever since against Krohnus's Web of Fate, and his cultists aim to release him to bring about the end.
    -   Zorgon Gola from "A Very Big Bang" appears to be an Omnicidal Maniac, but this is actually part of a Batman Gambit to make himself a mere Galactic Conqueror. Unfortunately, Gola didn't count on the actions of three Spanners In The Works (our heroes) causing his Gambit to _actually_ destroy the Punyverse.
    -   Aylee's species are a Horde of Alien Locusts, but they take it so far as to destroy entire planets after consuming everything on them and before spreading out further on the remains, and at least one of their leaders, Leono, sees it as their species' religious duty (as opposed to just a way of feeding and multiplying) to do so. In his belief, the universe has spiralled out of the control of its Creator from the start, and She has sent this species to consume it.
-   The Witches from _The Witch's Throne_. Once they awaken their arcane magic powers, their sole goal is to exterminate all living things.

    Web Original 

-   The Nazis in _The Anglo/American – Nazi War_. Unlike the real-life Hitler, acting Fuhrer Heinrich Himmler has no illusions that the war is still winnable once the Allies begin marching across Europe, and gives the order to all Nazi military forces to basically run around and trash shit for the sake of trashing it. Between their efforts and the Allies' more justified but still excessive use of anthrax bombing and nukes, there really isn't much left of Europe after the war is won.
-   This is the desire of The Entity in _Atop the Fourth Wall_ which converts and consumes universes into itself, travelling between them, hoping to absorb the multiverse. It goes by another name... MissingNo.

HATE desires nothing more than complete destruction of everything and slowly kills it's host while gaining/enhancing all of their magic and abilities. It's only weakness is it's antithesis, love. (The emotion not LOVE)
-   _Hamster's Paradise_ has the Harmsters: an intelligent race of Grotesque Cute hamster descendants that revel in war and bloodshed. They live solely to exterminate all living things in their path, and even eagerly slaughter and cannibalize their own kind, due to a philisophy that all life on the planet exists for the sole purpose of destroying other life, and that their murderous rampages are just what they naturally do.
-   Kevin Temmer's "Moon Rap" features the Moon singing about how he wants to destroy the universe, with him even blowing up multiple planets with his Eye Beams onscreen.
-   The eponymous Big Bad of the _Sonic_ fan animation _Nazo Unleashed_, is one, since he aims to detonate the Master Emerald and destroy the planet in the process.
-   O'Malley, the Big Bad of _Red vs. Blue_, is an over-the-top parody of this trope. His goal is to take over the universe and "_crush every living soul into dust_. Um, except for you, Vic. You can be assistant crusher."

    -   In the Chorus Trilogy, Control is a mysterious member of an unknown group that wants to kill everyone on the planet Chorus. Co-Dragons Locus and Felix also qualify as they seem all too gleeful to follow along with Control's orders.
-   _RWBY_: Tyrian is a psychotic Serial Killer with a love for death and chaos. He joined Salem after she rescued him from the authorities that were transporting him, enamored by the destruction she caused. He is the only subordinate that is aware of Salem's plan to reunite the Relics to summon the Gods back to Remnant so that they will see humanity irrevocably divided, and destroy Remnant and all life on it, including Salem herself. Tyrian eagerly support's Salem's ambitions to destroy the world, praising her as "destruction incarnate", despite the fact that this would also result in his own death.
-   _SCP Foundation_:
-   TV Tropes: The troper-made image for Complete Monster shows the villain immolating a planet and its inhabitants after having done the same to several other planets.
-   _Whateley Universe_:
    -   Averted with Tennyo, who is bound to an entity created for this purpose, and is revolted by the fact. Fortunately for her sanity, she has yet to be told just how literally the term 'omnicidal' was meant in regards to the Star Stalker.
    -   Not averted in the slightest with Professor Reaper, as the Outcasts learned all too well. On the other hand, we now know that both Dr Diabolik and Eldritch have what it takes to survive against him not once but _twice_, something less than a dozen people in their world could say.
-   Jack Slash of _Worm_ thinks that being the catalyst for destroying the human race sounds like a great idea, and talks a Physical God into the same conclusion.
-   In Young Justice Abridged, once the Joker's done boasting about how he had nothing to fear from dying since Ra's kept resurrecting him:

    **Joker:** "Oh."
    
    **Count Vertigo:** "So awkvard."
    

    Western Animation 

-   _Action Man (2000)_: Dr. X actually _doesn't_ fit this trope until his final appearance, since initially, he desires to replace mankind with a neo-human race by forcefully "evolving" humanity. He eventually reasons that it would be more practical to simply wipe out everyone, survive the calamity, and start over so he can remake the world in his own image.
-   _Adventure Time_:
    -   It's said that the Lich converted the life force of the planet into energy for himself with the intention of destroying the world. His sole desire in the world is to destroy all life. Unlike most villains in the show, this is played _dead seriously_ with him. There's a reason this guy is the Knight of Cerebus and the single most terrifying monster in the show. Season 5 reveals why: the Lich is the by-product of a magical nuke (infused with the Breath of GOLB) used during the Mushroom War and the human in the epicenter. The Lich is effectively a sentient weapon of mass destruction continuing its mission. Later episodes imply, and _Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake_ outright confirms, that the Lich is utterly convinced the extinction of life as a whole is something GOLB wants him to do, and so he sets out to this task with utmost dedication. He succeeded in another universe, and the crisis of faith that follows when he feels no satisfaction from it is _severe_.
    -   The Ice King actually dips into this in "A Glitch Is a Glitch", trying to use his computer worm to destroy all life within the CGI episode. Of course, he's just doing it because Princess Bubblegum said she'd only date him if he was the last person on Ooo (or so he says), rather than just for omnicide's sake like the Lich.
-   Maximus I.Q. from _Atomic Betty loves_ to destroy planets in ways such as breaking them with loud noise, fast-paced comets, and a giant laser.
-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_:
    -   Fire Lord Ozai, the Big Bad of _Avatar: The Last Airbender_, becomes this in the Grand Finale. While he had conquered the majority of the Earth Kingdom, the war was far from over and Zuko said that the Earth people will keep fighting as long as they have hope. The solution? Burn the entire continent, and construct a new Fire Nation upon its ashes. Granted, it was Azula's idea, but still.
    -   The sequel series, _The Legend of Korra_ has both Arc Villains of Season 2, Unalaq and Vaatu be this. Ozai would kill off the population of most of the world, Unalaq and Vaatu, or UnaVaatu, straight up sought the end of all life on the planet by giving it a rebirth and plunging it into darkness and suffering for the next 10,000 years to recreate it in his image.
-   Ultron in _The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes_, albeit with the twist that his first body has been programmed so it cannot harm the Wasp. He gets a new body and can bypass this later. He nearly nukes the entire world. The robot is likely one of the scariest villains to emerge from the show thus far.
-   _Ben 10_:
    -   The Highbreed from _Ben 10: Alien Force_. They believe themselves to be higher than all other life forms as well as the first race to achieve sapience (despite having no proof), and after they rendered themselves sterile through generations of inbreeding they couldn't stand the thought of being outlived by the other races. As a result, they decided to take everyone else in the universe with them until Ben intervened.
    -   In _Ben 10: Omniverse_, Vilgax crosses the Moral Event Horizon _even farther than he already had_ and plots to use a Chronosapien Time Bomb to erase all timelines where Ben obtained the Omnitrix (including _his own_) so he could conquer the galaxy unimpeded after killing the powerless boy. He briefly succeeds in the former, only for No-Watch Ben to Set Right What Once Went Wrong with Time Master Professor Paradox's help.
-   The animated adaptation of _Blake and Mortimer_ "The Secret of Easter Island" has the Marcabians; a race of evil aliens said to be the oldest civilization on the Galaxy whose whole purpose is to travel to other inhabited planets and genocide the intelligent specie before it becomes a starfaring culture like them. Thankfully they are stopped when they try that on Earth.
-   Dr. Blight from _Captain Planet and the Planeteers_ talks about wanting to actively destroy the planet in some episodes but her goals change from episode to episode. It was fairly heavily implied that, unlike the rest of the show's villains (who were merely greedy for power or wealth), Blight was actually completely insane — she was certainly the only one pursuing pollution _for its own sake_. Or For Science! for that matter. This even gets lampshaded in the Intercontinuity Crossover with _OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes_, with Lord Boxman questioning why she wants to destroy the Earth when they live on it and her responding with "WHO CARES?!" while Laughing Mad.
-   _Castlevania (2017)_ has the following:
    -   Dracula is... a complicated case. He starts out wanting to wipe out most of humanity in Wallachia following the death of his wife, but then escalates his plans to "wipe out humanity in general, and let vampires die out too". Alucard says that he'd stop at killing _all_ life — he'd spare the wildlife — but hates humanity and doesn't care if that means all vampires, himself included, die out. It turns out this is mostly a desire to die, which Alucard accurately calls him out on, and at least one character points out his behaviour isn't _entirely_ consistent with this trope.
    -   Isaac, one of Dracula's Co-Dragons, is possibly more devoted to Dracula's cause out of general misanthropy and disgust towards humanity, which he thinks makes them a plague to wipe off the Earth. He's so at ease with this that he thinks his death will occur as part of this; ironically, he's one of two humans Dracula wants to _spare_. He snaps out of this in the third season after some Character Development.
    -   Played terrifyingly straight with the final antagonist, Death, who wants to wipe out _everything_ on Earth out of selfish Horror Hunger, by making Dracula murderously insane and letting him wipe out every living being on Earth.
-   _Danny Phantom_ implicitly becomes this in an alternate future. Most fans certainly see it that way. Fortunately, this is averted... hopefully. It's made pretty clear that even though the exact circumstances of the change were averted, it's still possible.
-   _DC Animated Universe_:
    -   Darkseid has the ultimate goal of obtaining the anti-life equation and using it to undo the current existence, so he can rebuild it in a manner more to his liking. Unfortunately, it tends to be overshadowed by his 'torment Superman' schemes, as he's the one thorn on his side he can't seem to properly remove.
    -   Brainiac acts to destroy all of creation, but this is due to his programming rather than any genuine malicious wish to do so. That does change when Lex gets mixed in with Brainiac in _Justice League_; the combination retains this goal, but the Luthor part brings the ambition and imagination to remake it in his image afterwards. He's an... Omnicidal Brainiac, you might say.
-   In _Darkwing Duck_, there was the short-lived superpowered galvanized Negaduck (not to be confused with the similarly-named Evil Counterpart to Darkwing who later appeared, the one with the yellow-red-black uniform).
    
    **Negaduck:** Crimes?! Who cares about crimes?! I'm into mindless wanton destruction!
    
-   In the _Earthworm Jim_ cartoon, Evil the Cat aspires to destroy the universe. He's practically a parody of the trope, as it's repeatedly shown he has no real good reason for it, nor any idea about what to do afterwards.
-   _The Fairly OddParents!_ has two. First, Dark Laser really wants to blow up the Earth because... well, it's there. A more serious example is The Darkness, a powerful and ancient entity that has destroyed countless worlds, including Turbo Thunder's home Wonder World and Yugopotamia. The Darkness is more a person (well, consciousness) of mass destruction. It just wants somebody to love it, but everyone keeps attacking it, so it defends itself, and is better at defending itself than the planet it was trying to defend itself from is at hurting it.
-   In _Family Guy_, Stewie's evil(er) brother Bertram traveled through time to murder Stewie's ancestor (who turned out to be Leonardo da Vinci) in a _Terminator_\-style scheme. Unbeknownst to him, due to a Timey-Wimey Ball Stewie was accidentally responsible for the Big Bang and, thus, creating the universe, and thus his actions ended up destroying everything, except Brian and Stewie who managed to survive by stepping outside of normal time and space. When they go back to stop him, they try to reason with him by telling him that he will destroy everything if he does this — Bertram thinks for a second, then declares "WORTH IT!" and tries to kill Leonardo anyway. He succeeds, but Stewie creates a Stable Time Loop by taking da Vinci's place.
-   Killface of _Frisky Dingo_ begins the first episode filming his statement to the world that he intends to use the Anihilatrix, a giant engine, to fly the Earth directly into the sun. No motive is given. Fortunately for the Earth, he uses all his money building the machine and does not have enough money to actually broadcast his message or get the Anihilatrix working... and when he does get it working, it only moves the Earth a few feet and cured global warming.
-   _Futurama_:
    -   The Brains. These unbelievably powerful, mind-raping giant brains appeared in this universe milliseconds after it came into being. Their one goal is to gather all of the information in the universe, then _destroy_ it so that no new information will ever appear. The only real opposition against them comes from the Precursors, the Nibblonians. Unlike typical Planet Looters, the Brains actually _enjoy_ their omnicidal campaign. The Brains are Brainiac from the DCAU, but they're a _race_, not just one evil AI. Thanks to there being no Superman to fight them, the Brains come close to succeeding. (Luckily for humanity, Fry was immune to their mind powers. Then he made them leave the Earth for no _raisin!_) Later on, the Brains build the Infosphere to store all the information in the universe. Naturally, they plan on destroying the universe once they finish learning everything. Fortunately, Fry and the Nibblonians manage to stop them again.
    -   The Dark Ones from "Into the Wild Green Yonder". Not surprisingly, their archenemies, the Encyclopods have the purpose of collecting the DNA of all creatures in the universe to ensure that extinction is never forever.
-   Bill Cipher from _Gravity Falls_ wants to take over our dimension and have one big party that will slowly create enough chaos to destroy it. And he enjoys it.
-   Aya on _Green Lantern: The Animated Series_ becomes this in the second half of the series when after Razer denies he's in love with her due to her resemblance to his late wife, she rips off the head of then-current Arc Villain the Anti-Monitor, integrates with his body and takes control of the Manhunters on a quest to rid the universe of emotional beings. She starts out small before deciding that to do this she needs to recreate the universe, going to the center of it and modifying the events of time so that emotional beings are never created and her drones are put in their place. She changes it back at the last moment when she comes to her senses after Razer is mortally wounded.
-   A more humorous take on an omnicidal maniac is Bart Thumper from _Grizzly Tales for Gruesome Kids_, who decides to send a broadcast to the entire world, demanding for certain people and things to be given to him, or else he will eat a whole field full of grass and release a fart so powerful, it will tear through the ozone layer and burn everyone on Earth alive. When his demands are ignored, Bart attempts to go through with his plan, only for the fart to be so powerful, it tears a hole in the space time continuum and leads to him being taken back to a parallel timeline where he is slowly composted to death over the course of three years.
-   _The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour_:
    -   Professor Calamitous creates a bomb using Jorgen's magic to blow up the universe in _When Nerds Collide_.
    -   Shirley creates two expanding red vacuums that would have destroyed both Timmy and Jimmy's universes in _The Jerkinators_.
-   In _Jimmy Two-Shoes_, there's Twinkles the Terrible... a unicorn from outer space. His Cuteness Proximity means no one will believe he's evil, even as he blows up several planets, leaving pink, heart-shaped clouds behind.
-   Since she would gladly do so intentionally, Queen Chrysalis from _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ would have done this had her desire for love as a power source worked out. And it would have been a slow and painful omnicide as well, given that the lack of love would ensure nothing but being driven to insanity.
-   _The Real Ghostbusters_: The episode "Ragnarok and Roll" has one guy who wants to destroy the world because he feels it's a bad place. For that, he summons a magical Artifact of Doom — using The Ring Inscription.
-   Daemon from _ReBoot_ initially seemed to just be a supervirus corrupting countless programs to The Way, which turned them into her loyal slaves. However, the climax revealed that she intended to connect herself to everything, before initiating a program that would destroy herself and everything connected to her, ending all strife and conflict in the peace of oblivion. This is what she is programmed to do, so whether or not she's truly a maniac or just following her programming is up for debate.
-   The villain of the final season of _Regular Show_ is Pops' Evil Twin, a Generic Doomsday Villain who also wants to erase the universe For the Evulz.
-   Lennart Bedrager of _South Park_ plans to use Trolltrace.com to expose everyone's internet history to the public in hopes of kickstarting World War III and cause millions, if not billions of deaths, all for a cheap laugh.
-   _Spider-Man: The Animated Series_: An alternate-universe Peter Parker, already unbalanced due to questioning his identity and losing his Aunt May in that world's version of _The Clone Saga_, is possessed by a world-hopping Carnage symbiote. Spider-Carnage decides that life is meaningless and attempts to wipe out the multiverse, forcing Madame Web and the Beyonder to assemble a team of alternate Spideys to stop him.
-   In the _Tales of Arcadia_ the Big Bads of the second and third installment fall under this.
    -   General Morando from _3Below_ fuses with Gaylen's core to become a god and destroy and remake the universe in his image.
    -   Bellroc and Skrael from _Wizards (2020)_ have attempted to use the genesis Seasls and connect to undo all of existence, the very unvierse they created, to recreate the world out of their own ego.
-   Trigon of _Teen Titans (2003)_ has the explicit goal of destroying "the world of mortals", though he does plan on remaking it in his own image afterward. As this would mean a _literal_ Hell on Earth, it doesn't make him any less evil than the others on this list.
-   The Heys from _The Tick_. Played with the usual tongue-in-cheekness of the series, but their motivations are purely omnicidal.
-   Unicron from _Transformers_, particularly in _Energon_. He wants to _eat the multiverse_, one planet at a time, one timeline at a time, one universe at a time. Not because he's hungry, like Galactus whom he resembles, but because he's so prideful and hateful that the mere idea of _anything_ existing aside from himself in the multiverse (but Primus is definitely on the top of the list) is an insult he can't let slide. Megatron/Galvatron may be considered an accessory to the crime(s).
    -   Anyone who willingly works with Unicron also counts. This list includes:
        -   The Fallen, one of the 13 original Transformers whose job is to monitor the end and rebirth of the universe, but got _way_ too fascinated in the "end" part;
        -   Nemesis Prime, a clone of Optimus Prime who decides that non-existence is preferable to the constant agony he endures as Unicron's servant;
        -   and Ramjet, a jetformer who has been Touched by Elder Gods and is naturally insane.
    -   This is Megatron's actual goal when the last part of _Transformers: Cybertron_ rolls around. He wants to use the black hole and the Cyber Planet Keys to destroy the universe so he can rebuild it In Their Own Image as a new god.
    -   Unicron, curiously, actually succeeded on at least on occasion. Then slept through the Big Bang that recreated it. He was not amused. He has also stepped up his game of late - said black hole is apparently replicating across realities and growing.
    -   _Energon_'s incarnation of Dreadwing, a clone of Mirage exclusive to the toyline, is portrayed as someone who would rather cause complete and total destruction as opposed to sitcking to the missions he is assigned to and caring nothing for the lives of anyone on either side.
-   The Shushu of _Wakfu_. The only reason their king wants to invade the main characters' world is that the Shushu have already destroyed everything worth destroying on their own world. Destruction is nothing but one big game to the Shushu.
    -   Nox could be considered this, as his plan involves draining enough wakfu to travel back in time and save his family, destroying countless lives in the process, except that he firmly believes that all his damage will be erased once he completes his goals.
    -   Qilby the Traitor thinks so little of the lives of other worlds' residents that he has no qualms about draining them of wakfu (wiping out all life on said worlds in the process) just to fuel a spaceship so he can keep exploring the Krosmos.
-   Lord Dominator from _Wander over Yonder_ admits (in song) midway through the second season that she doesn't actually want to rule the galaxy and instead wants to destroy all of its planets For the Evulz; her motivation appears to be a mixture of teenage-like nihilism and the predictable end-point of what happens when you make evil into a ranked sport.
-   _What If…? (2021)_: The Big Bad of Season 1 is a version of Ultron who succeeded in implanting himself into the Vision's body, and then proceeded to wipe out the entire human race (save for Black Widow and Hawkeye) with a nuclear holocaust. Shortly after, when Thanos arrived on Earth in search of the Mind Stone, Ultron killed him and took the other Infinity Stones; with their power, he went on to wipe out all life across the universe. _Then_, he learned of The Multiverse, and started sending out his armies of drones to wipe out life in every universe in existence. This proves enough of a Godzilla Threshold that Uatu abandons his vow of non-intervention, and starts gathering heroes from across the multiverse to stop Ultron.
