So you have some Half Human Hybrids? What about Beast Men? Rubber-Forehead Aliens? Cute Monster Girls? Well, be careful. If a character has some form of non-human anatomy (ears, wings, _especially_ tails), chances are that said physical feature will be… sensitive. Even characters who look mostly human may have erogenous zones in odd areas to establish that they have Bizarre Alien Biology or Bizarre Alien Reproduction. For obvious reasons, this leads to a lot of I Didn't Mean to Turn You On type incidents, especially when one party is unaware that the resident Cat Person gets aroused when someone strokes their tail. It can also be used in some cases of Boldly Coming where the attractive alien doesn't have comparable human-like genitalia, but does have a type of erogenous zone on them, allowing for a type of human/alien coupling nonetheless.

For obvious reasons, this leads to a lot of Power Perversion Potential when said characters show up in fanfic, and if a character does not possess any known Fantastic Arousal the fans may create one.

Compare and contrast Something Else Also Rises, where this is more of an innuendo for the, er, traditional forms of arousal.

Contrast Strangely Arousing, where the inexplicable incident leads to arousal on the observer's part, though there could be some overlap if the aroused believes that ordinary humans have similar erogenous zones to them. Not to be confused with a character having a strange sexual fetish.

## Examples:

    General/Multiple 

-   If any fantasy story has any mentionings about sexuality, elven ears are always erogenous zones. Actually, this is true for many humans as well.
-   When handling the subject of Cat Folk, expect the tail (or, less often, ears) to be their "sensitive area".
-   Wings. Anything with wings has a high chance of revealing them to be especially sensitive, if not outright stating they're an erogenous zone.
-   Horns are a popular one, mostly in fanfiction but increasingly in original work too, cropping up in fic regarding succubi/incubi, tieflings, demons etc. This one in particular is illogical because horns by definition are bony growths with an outside layer of hard keratin, the same substance hair and fingernails are made of. Meaning that there is no feeling in them except at the base (which is less the horn itself and more the connected tissue and muscle) and _maybe_ the interior (which... if you're cutting someone's horn clean through, arousal probably won't be their reaction). Horns are explicitly meant for combat and defense, so it would only be detrimental if they were sensitive. Some authors will handwave this by claiming that they're sensory organs that just happen to be shaped like horns, though it's rarely specified what purpose these organs are supposed to serve.
-   Antennae are less common than horns, but they sometimes act as this. They’re more justifiable than horns as erogenous zones, given that antennae actually are sensitive.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The wings of a _12 Beast_ Harpy are very sensitive to touch and stimulation.
-   In _Birdy the Mighty Decode_, the beast-people seem to be aroused by having their chins scratched.
-   _Dog Days_ has a basic rewarding treatment for the dog-warrior race, patting on his/her head. It's shown through a Tsundere Eclair as she blushes when her princess pats her, but gets mad when the Idiot Hero does it.
-   _Dragon Crisis!_:
    -   Ai's ears and tail are _very_ sensitive to touch.
    -   The spot on Rose's back where her wings come out seems quite sensitive, when Ryuji touches her there she blushes and starts trembling. Then there are the scales on the back on Rose's hand.
-   Usa-tan, the rabbit of _Etotama_'s Chinese Zodiac, has her feet as an erogenous zone. A later episode has random magical effects turn her entire body into one, leaving her writhing on the floor.
-   In one episode of _FLCL_, Naota sprouts cat ears, and Haruko, in typical fashion, teases him by rubbing them, resulting in a wriggling and ebullient Naota.
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_: The Italy brothers both have an Idiot Hair which acts as an erogenous zone. Germany messes with Italy's, and Spain messes with Romano's (although Germany at least doesn't realize what he's doing) because what kind of world would this be if they didn't? The brothers get their Idiot Hair tangled together once, and Italy's panicked phone call to Germany sounds... less than innocent out of context.
-   _High School D×D_ has a variant: Koneko goes into heat. Unusually for a fanservice series, this is considered a _problem_, as getting pregnant at her size would be life-threatening.
-   _Monster Musume_:
    -   Miia the lamia gets very aroused when someone strokes her tail, specifically the tip. She was also very clearly aroused when Kimihito helped peel her scales off when she was shedding. The first chapter has Kimihito accidentally do this in an attempt to get her off him...it's later shown to be a trait shared across reptile extraspecies, as Draco the Dragonet reacts the same way.
    -   Centaurs apparently associate riding on their backs as a sexual act or something akin, and when Kimihito rode on Centorea's back it's pointed out that he essentially raped her... but this being a harem comedy it's just played for laughs.
    -   A chapter where the group goes to a farm has them meet a faun (sheep girl) who _really_ enjoys being sheared.
-   _Musuko ga Kawaikute Shikataganai Mazoku no Hahaoya_: Demons' tails are very sensitive to touch. An omake page describes it as making her weak-kneed. This is problematic for Lorem, in particular, as her infant son Gospel likes to chew on her tail despite her efforts to teach him not to. When she lets Gospel do it to calm him down, Merii notices Lorem is biting her lip to keep from crying out and drooling.
-   The demons from _My Balls_ (don't ask) have each a tattoo somewhere on their body that are both the focus of their demonic powers, and very sensitive to caresses.
-   In _My Bride is a Mermaid_, young mermaids grow tails when they get wet. Resisting the transformation results in a tickling sensation, which was milked for all it was worth in one episode when two mermaids practice endurance training.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_:
    -   Winged Humanoid Setsuna gets flustered when Asuna starts stroking her wings.
    -   Robot Girl Chachamaru's whole key winding incident is a variation. And then they introduced a method for Chachamaru to resupply mana to herself. It's treated exactly the way you'd expect.
-   Lizlet from _Omamori Himari_ is a Tsukumogami; to be more precise, she is the spirit of a 100+ year old teacup. Said teacup is also apparently an erogenous zone, judging by her reaction when the title character strokes and licks it in an attempt to wake her up.
    -   This is very much confirmed when Yuuto unintentionally drinks from said teacup.
-   _So, I Can't Play H!_: Seen in episode 4, when Ryosuke restores Lisara's energy during the climax of her battle with Ilia. Except he does it by thrusting his pelvis directly into her face. Even though there's no actual contact<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , Lisara becomes visibly aroused by it and submits to him.
    
    **Lisara:** _(blushes, whispering)_ "S-so... so erotic!"
    
-   In an arc in the _Sword Art Online_ anime, Kirito grabs Sinon's ALO Cait Sidhe avatar's tail, revealing that apparently the system in ALO translates the tail as a particularly sensitive area. Bonus for Silica's sense of dejection that he never grabs _her_ tail.
-   In the manga _Tail Chaser_, the Cat Girl cast members' tails. Playing with their tails led to Does This Remind You of Anything? rather quickly.
-   _To Love Ru_: Devilukeans' tails are an erogenous zone, especially the spade-shaped tip. We only see the females' tail being touched, but there's a mention the males' aren't as sensitive. Naturally, there's a chapter where Rito gets his hand stuck to Lala's tail. In the sequel _Darkness_, where the fanservice goes _much_ further, the tail's main use (especially Momo's) is having various characters stroking or licking it − including Momo herself. Ironically, even that eventually falls by the wayside for characters being touched in their actual private parts (one scene all but showing Lala has a clitoris just like a human female). Bizarrely, while Lala's tail is so sensitive she's immobilized if it's grabbed, she can somehow shoot an energy beam from it.
-   In the first episode of _Utawarerumono_, Eruru gets annoyed with Hakuoro when he gently strokes her tail. For a second she looks like she really likes it, then seems embarrassed and shoves him away. Watch the sequence here. Just prior, a couple of brats ran by and took a swipe at her tail, which she reacted to as if having her skirt flipped up.
-   _Yumeria_: Tomokazu had a daydream in which Neneko's ears were her "weak spot".
-   In the Boys' Love manga, _Datte Maou-sama wa Kare ga Kirai_ (_Goodbye World Conquest_), the titular Demon King and Hero both possess erogenous zones called Marks stamped on the back of their tongues. This is actually plot-related; since both characters look like normal humans, the Hero uses the existence of this Mark to "confirm" he found the Demon King.
-   In _Claymore_, it's revealed that using Yoma (the energy that gives Claymore their abilities) is similar to sexual arousal. This explanation is used to explain why Claymore who use too much energy at once are at risk of permanent transformation into monsters called Awakened Beings—the feeling is just so pleasurable that many can't help themselves from having what is essentially an involuntary orgasm. What's more, male Claymore are stated to almost _never_ be able to resist it, invoking I'm a Man; I Can't Help It.
-   An extended Fanservice scene in episode 6 of _No Game No Life_ reveals (through Jibril) that Flügel people's wings are filled with erogenous zones.
-   _Bakuon!!_: Badass Biker Rin talking about how she was feeling while riding her Katana bike, and unknowingly transmitting her thoughts to her friends via headsets on her helmet, fellow biker Onsa then speeds up a yellow light, trying to escape her radio signal. This was not shown in the anime, through.
-   _Macross Delta_: If Freyja's reaction is any indication, Windermerian runes are highly sensitive to touch.
-   For whatever reason, the title characters of _Frame Arms Girls_ can really feel it when you plug in their charging cables. In the Lab Days manga, Stylet gets angry with Gourai for plugging her in without warning, and in the anime, Ao is surprised when Gourai squeals a little when she first charges her up.
-   In _The Helpful Fox Senko-san_, the very suggestion of being allowed to touch her fluffy fox tail elicits very suggestive reactions from Senko herself. The entire time she allows Nakano to do so she's blushing and breathing heavily.
-   Considering the subject matter, this is unsurprisingly par for the course in _Interspecies Reviewers_. Birdmaids, especially those similar to parakeets, have a very sensitive spot near the nape of their necks. As for Tritagonist Crimviel, his halo and wings are erogenous zones.

    Comic Books 

-   A cubi's tail in _Fine Print_ is an erogenous zone and it's rather sensitive. It's implied that this is because this is where they store raw, primordial desire that they can inject into others, not unlike the venom in a scorpion's stinger.
-   _Spider-Woman_:
    -   Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew) secretes pheromones that make every man around her want her. _Badly._ And while she can adjust the strength of them, she can't turn them off fully. At one point in _New Avengers_, when she explains how her powers work to her teammates, many of them are happy to know what's finally going on, revealing that they all wanted to jump her bones the entire time. Spider-Man in particular is relieved, because he was trying so hard to remind himself how much he loved his then-wife Mary Jane.
    -   This also applies to Veranke, the Skrull shapeshifter that replaced her and copied her powers. The above scene is later revealed to have been Veranke in disguise at the time.
-   _Silk (Marvel Comics)_: It's later revealed that Spider-Man _also_ uncontrollably secretes pheromones, and so does his true Distaff Counterpart, Silk. The difference is that these pheromones only work between the two of them, due to being bitten by the same spider. When they're in close proximity to each other, the duo can only resist for a few minutes before they have an uncontrollable urge to tear into each other. Silk eventually starts avoiding Peter because of it, even when the events of _Spider-Verse_ reduced the effects (at least on Silk's end of things, anyway).

    Fan Works 

-   Nearly all _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ Fanfiction that even glances off Rule 34 holds that pegasus wings are a major erogenous zone, based off a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment from "Over A Barrel" where Rainbow Dash has her wings fully outstretched for no apparent reason just as Pinkie Pie appears in a showgirl outfit. It was then extended to unicorn horns, with all the phallic symbolism that this implies.
    -   _Racer and the Geek_ includes a scene in the second chapter where the main character experiences some interesting sensations in his horn while taking a shower.
    -   One scene from _The Non-Bronyverse_ has TD ask Celestia if she's made any progress in getting him home, emphasizing his point by tapping Celestia's horn. Rarity wonders if that means he's gotten to "second base," and Luna is _furious_.
    -   _The Great Alicorn Hunt_, however, specifically shoots both ideas down as ridiculous, though they do mention that pegasus wings are sensitive in the sense that they are used to sense air currents. But this doesn't make touching them any more arousing than touching the average person's nose is.
-   The _Ah! My Goddess_ fic "Vows" had the area between their shoulder blades (where their wings appear) to be an erogenous zone. Keiichi has to take lessons from Peorth to avoid injuring Belldandy (or getting injured)…
    
    **Urd:** Goddesses are required to attend a sex education course when they declare they intend to have a relationship with a mortal. Otherwise, they might lose themselves in the passion of the act and cause the man's heart to cave in on itself and then explode.
    
-   Some _Maleficent_, the wings. Inspired by birds, where part of the mating ritual is to take care of each other's feathers, which conveniently is something Maleficent and Diaval can have in common ...
-   _Blue Exorcist_ fans really love Rin's tail. In fanfiction, having it stroked feels either extremely soothing or arousing depending on what the author decides. There is no evidence of how tail stroking affects him in canon, though it has been shown that having it tugged is extremely painful. Despite that, there is at least one fanfiction dedicated entirely to how aroused the tail makes him feel.
    -   Considering tails are a common trait of demons (including how sensitive they are), this transitions over to Mephisto and Amaimon as well as Yukio if he happens to be awakened within the fanfiction but mostly the focus is on Rin.
-   A _Doctor Who_ fanfic pokes fun at this trope, coupled with I Didn't Mean to Turn You On. A P.O.'d Rose jabs her finger into an alien captor's chest a few times to emphasize her ranting and the captor immediately lets them go. To Rose's horror, the Doctor explains that that particular species keep their genitals in their chests...
    -   There's a lot of _Doctor Who_ fanon concerning this, one piece of which is dubiously canonical: in one scene in the _Eighth Doctor Adventures_, the Doctor gets a back massage. He demonstrates his appreciation via all manner of undignified noises, _especially_ when his neck is being massaged. Some people have taken this to mean that a Time Lord's neck is an erogenous zone.
-   Comes up in a lot of _Gargoyles_ fanfic. Fanon dictates that the shoulders and middle of the back, between the wings is especially... sensitive.
-   In many _Inuyasha_ fanfics, the eponymous hanyou's ears are much more sensitive than portrayed in canon, where he actually _doesn't_ like people to touch them, even Kagome. Fanon thus declared them an erogenous zone. Sometimes he even purrs when someone pets them. (Even though he's part DOG demon, not CAT.)
-   Zim's antennae (and that of other Irkens) in _Invader Zim_ fanfiction being this trope is well-established Fanon. Which admittedly has _some_ basis in reality if they're physiologically similar to real life arthropods.
-   Appears in _Tales of Symphonia_ fanfic:
    -   Elves and half-elves. (Not all of the latter have pointed ears, somewhat oddly.)
    -   This trope gets odd when applied to the angel's wings. If you've never played the game, the wings are more fay-like than traditional angel-wings and are appear to be made of light or energy rather than anything corporeal or solid. Why would that be erogenous? It logically shouldn't even have nerves!
-   In _Touhou Project_ fanworks, many of the Little Bit Beastly girls are subjected to this:
    -   Ran's tails and ears are commonly played with by an unsuspecting Chen or by a bored Yukari, producing interesting reactions, spawning the meme _A cat is added_ as a result of a particular piece.
    -   Horns are a common source of this for fans, including Keine in her hakutaku form, Yuugi, and Suika.
    -   Wings are also a common item, including Mystia, Remilia, and Aya.
    -   Wriggle Nightbug's antennae are partially justified, since they _are_ sensory organs, just not that kind.
    -   Parsee is so jealous that her Pointy Ears get so much attention!
    -   A Played for Laughs parody is hitboxes, depicting light touches as pleasurable but too much will make them pichuun. Relatedly, an image that designates _every part_ of Reisen's body as being an erogenous zone.
    -   Satori and Koishi are often depicted as having very sensitive third eyes, and not in the Eye Scream sense.
-   _Freakin Gensokyo_ adds elemental strengths and weaknesses on top of the above. If you have more than 100% resistance to an element, being hit with a corresponding elemental attack strengthens you... and turns you on. Genkan the yuki-onna discovers this while decked out in enough magical gear to give her 800% ice resistance.
-   _The Return_ has Succubus horns being very sensitive; it's also implied that their tails may act as a pseudo-inseminator. You may now wash your brain.
-   This piece of _Pokémon_ fanart has Airalin the Gardevoir get extremely flustered after her trainer pokes the horn sticking out of her chest, followed by her slapping him in the face for doing so.
    
    **Serene:** That's like poking her in the boob.
    
-   _Buffy_ fandom frequently suggests that the brow ridges of a vampire's Game Face are an erogenous zone—and when they're stroked, vampires _purr_. This is most frequently invoked with Spike; most other vampires aren't considered as cuddly, except for Angel, who hates being one.
-   In every _Dragon Ball Z_ fanfiction in which the Saiyan characters have their tails, said tails will _always_ be — without exception — major erogenous zones. Justified in that a Saiyan's tail is _very_ sensitive, unless the weakness is trained out of it.
-   At least one _Elfen Lied_ Fanfiction has shown that the cat-ear-like horns of the Diclonius are _quite_ sensitive. May be a Justified Trope as we see Lucy going into shock or reverting to her more docile "Nyuu" persona anytime her horns are broken off. Then again, who wouldn't go into shock, or at least suffer agonizing pain if you get part of your skull blown away? That is, if you actually _survive_.
-   In the _Sky High (2005)_ fanfic "Stop," the pyrokinetic Warren Peace's hands are erogenous zones due to the special nerves necessary for him to conduct fire.
-   _Toy Story_ fandom has it that pull-strings and wings are erogenous zones.
-   _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_ fans have run away with the idea of Soul Gem Play <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> (directly applying physical contact to a Soul Gem in order to stimulate the poor Magical Girl the Gem belongs to) after that scene where Kyubey reveals the literal truth about the Soul Gems by making Sayaka feel pain through her own Gem.
    -   _Stars Above_ plays this for cold drama when Desideria violates Homura through her Soul Gem.
-   _TRON_ and _TRON: Legacy_ fanon has it that programs' circuits are as sensitive as human genitalia (which programs are often but not always assumed to lack). This is supported by a deleted scene in the original in which Tron and Yori indulge in a moment of physical affection by tracing each others' circuit patterns with their fingers.
-   In _Mass Effect_ fandom, turians and quarians are subject to this (it also doesn't hurt that a turian and quarian are two of the most popular love interests). For turians, fans have run with the idea that their fringes and mandibles are very sensitive to touch. As for quarians in fanfic... their whole bodies are basically erogenous zones, as since they're stuck in their suits for their entire lives, practically any kind of skin-to-skin contact can get them going.
-   _Supernatural_ fandom postulates that touching an angel's wings is an act of deep intimacy—but whether that intimacy is sexual or emotional varies. Angels being what they are (namely, conceptual beings closer to light than flesh), the line between sexual intimacy and emotional intimacy isn't always as clear. Often, angels are portrayed as not having physical sex at all, but instead merging their persons and minds together. In sum, angels are odd.
-   In _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_, a male Smurf's bald head is considered an erogenous zone, which is part of why they must wear the hats, though it can only be triggered by the touch of a female Smurf (or just a female in general). This was mentioned by Papa Smurf to Hefty in "I Dream Of Smurfette", and where the colorful euphemism for sex "getting under one's hat" comes from. Smurfette figures this out for herself when she performs the hat-removing ritual on Empath during their marriage consummation in "Empath's Honeymoon".
-   Subverted in the _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ Fic "Hearts on Fire" when Donatello and the Anthropomorphic Dragon Girl Belladonna Starchild finally manage to confess their love for each other, Belladonna innocently asks if she can touch Donny's shell, you may think this trope is going to happen but instead of getting aroused Donny just gets very sleepy and relaxed; it is mentioned in another fic that the Turtle's shells are NOT erogenous zones.
-   In _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ fanfiction, other characters are sometimes given erogenous zones like the Italy Brothers' Idiot Hairs above. America's own Idiot Hair is one of the more common ones.
-   In _Bait and Switch (STO)_ chapter eight, Eleya, a Bajoran, gives a gasp when Gaarra, also Bajoran, strokes the ridges on her nose.
-   In _Alpha and Omega_, when Shinji takes Councilor Tevos hostage, he pokes her in the small of her back with a gun whenever she stops walking. Eventually she angrily snaps at him for his "molestation", causing him to remember that spot is a major erogenous zone on Asari.
-   After being turned into an Alicorn in _Shinji's Nightmare_, Shinji's wings always spread out stiffly when he's aroused, particularly when Maya stroked his horn. Misato finds this hilarious.
-   _White Sheep (RWBY)_: Subverted. When Jaune finally discovers what "tentacle hentai" is, he is offended and insists that his tentacles do _not_ work that way. They're more like flexible arms, and certainly not erogenous zones. This doesn't stop people from writing in-universe smut about them.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Little Nicky_, one character is cursed with breasts on his head. Of course they are erogenous zones.

-   The alien protagonist of _What Planet Are You From??_ has an artificial phallus that audibly buzzes.
-   _Coneheads_, based on the _Saturday Night Live_ Coneheads sketches. The Coneheads are aliens with a game where they toss a special ring onto each other's cones, which has something to do with sex. The Movie expands on this, first by showing that the Coneheads touch the top of their heads together in a fashion resembling a kiss (making the lights dim), later by suggesting through a sexy discretion shot a more intense situation where, among other things, the lights went berserk.
-   _Ted_: The eponymous teddy bear has a desire for his girlfriend to finger his tag, most likely because it's the closest thing to a lower body orifice he has, seeing that he's a magically animated teddy bear and all.
-   _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country_ teaches us that "not everyone carries their genitals in the same place" when Kirk delivers a Groin Attack to an alien's _knee_.

    Jokes 

-   A common childish prank has the prankster shaking hands with the target, introducing themselves as an alien. The prankster asks about several biological functions and the body part used to perform them, saying every time that their own species uses another for that (e.g. ‘What do you use to eat? Your mouth? We use our chest’). Finally, the prankster asks what they use to have sex, and says they use their hand.

    Literature 

-   _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ has Eccentrica Gallumbits, the triple-breasted whore of Eroticon VI. Some people say her erogenous zones start some four miles from her actual body. Ford Prefect disagrees, saying five.
-   In Robin Hobb's _Ship of Destiny_, Malta, as a result of spending a lot of time on the Rain River, ends up with a ridge on her forehead which appears to be, basically, a facial clitoris.
-   In Robert Jordan's _The Wheel of Time_, the catlike ears of Ogier are explicitly stated to be erogenous zones. Exposing them completely is scandalous, and Loial becomes embarrassed after accidentally mentioning his fiancee's.
-   In the _Hurog_ duology, healing magic seems to be this for Ward (who is an ordinary human being with a drop of dragon's blood, who has magic abilities) - he can feel magic, and at one point mentions that someone's healing magic feels "almost erotic, like a hand touching me intimately". It makes him a bit uncomfortable and embarassed, but he can ignore it as he gets used to it.
-   In the _Star Wars Expanded Universe_, Gotals' horns are both electromagnetic sensors and erogenous zones. The Twi'lek's head-tentacles likewise. In-story they're explained more as being used like arms; there's a specific sign language that few people of other species understand, but the major use is gesturing and emphasis. _Tales from Jabba's Palace_ has Oola using hers to indicate Sarcasm Mode and express disbelief without anyone but Threepio knowing it.
-   _A Court of Thorns and Roses_: Wing-touching for Illyrians. According to Rhysand, Illyrian males can reach orgasm through only this if it's done right.
-   Wings were mentioned for Aliisza from _War of the Spider Queen_. But then, she's Alu-fiend (half\-succubus)...
-   _Temeraire_: The titular dragon grows a "beard" of tendrils and a spined ruff when he reaches maturity, unlike any of the other dragons he knows. His human friend Will starts petting them to alleviate Temeraire's Freakiness Shame, then yanks his hand away when he realizes _how much_ he's enjoying it.
-   In _The Hollows_, when Rachel first moves in with her bisexual vampire co-worker Ivy, she unintentionally does a pile of things that tend to arouse vampires, such as borrowing Ivy's clothes (causing their scents to mix). It's made worse by the fact that Ivy has been trying to avoid drinking blood.
-   In the _His Dark Materials_ trilogy is it considered taboo to touch the daemon (manifestation of a soul in animal form) of another human being. At the end of the trilogy Will and Lyra accidentally and then deliberately touch each other's daemons, and the subtext couldn't be more obvious. This serves to make the procedure of 'intercision' so much more horrifying.
-   Sapient Ship Daisy Mae (USS Des Moines) in the _Legacy of the Aldenata_ book _Yellow Eyes_ has a spot directly between her reactors that needs to be scrubbed regularly...
-   The section on mermaids in _The Encyclopedia of Fantasy: People of the Light_ uses this as half a solution for the Mermaid Problem, although it's not the tail, it's the hair. Ismael Merindol reveals that mermaids spend so much time combing their hair because that is their erogenous zone, and a source of incomparable pleasure. He writes: "In my youth I had a mermaid for a lover, but I was unable to give her pleasure in the usual way. However, if I scratched her scalp in a certain way she would very quickly swoon away. For what other women have between their legs, mermaids have in their hair."
-   Elves in _Magika Swordsman and Summoner_ have very sensitive ears. Sufficiently so that Kazuki was able to stimulate Koyuki to orgasm by stroking them.
-   _Tinker_: Elves' ears are... sensitive. After Tinker is transformed from a human to an elf, her cousin touches her ear and she has to hastily explain why he shouldn't do that.
-   _Sword Art Online_: Cait Sith tails are sensitive to touch, even though humans don't really have the capacity to feel tail sensations. Cue Sinon's blushy reaction and squeal when Kirito grabs her tail during the Excalibur arc.
-   _Galápagos_: Humans have evolved into marine lifeforms very adept at swimming and catching fish with their mouths, one million years from now. The fingers that were once so precise and dextrous have become sexually sensitive areas attractive to the other sex.
-   _Immortals After Dark_: Demons' horns are so sensitive that stroking them is referred to as a hornjob.
-   _Sholan Alliance_: Bathing in a hot spring can have surprising results for male Sholans.
-   According to Holo from _Spice and Wolf_, wolves touching noses is to them what kissing is to humans. Apparently Lawrence's fingers feel like a wolf's nose. So when he does touch her nose... She also stiffens and yells at him when he impulsively grabs her tail.
-   _Xanadu (Storyverse)_: In Alveric's mermaid series, mermen possess a pair of fins running down their tails that mermaids find looking at, and especially touching with their own tails, to be sexually exciting.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Alien Nation_: The Tenctonese women are aroused by, among other things, certain notes (coincidentally one of them is the TV test card tone), contact with their lower back but as a species their genitals are less of an issue sexually. (They're egg-layers, sort of — their sex is... complicated.)
-   The _Angel_ episode "She" involves a demon species whose females have bony ridges along the spine that become red hot when they're in heat. The extremely patriarchal males of the species cut off these ridges to keep their females docile, as sexual arousal is implied to make the women supernaturally strong. Of course, the whole episode is one big allegory for female genital mutilation.
-   In the _Babylon 5_ episode "Acts of Sacrifice", Ivanova takes advantage of this trope to get out of having sex with an alien race that traditionally uses it to conclude negotiations. He goes away with the impression that human sex consists of putting your hand on someone's head and dancing around them singing. Or rather, he's forced to come to that conclusion; he probably suspects he's been conned, but to admit that would be more humiliating than just going with it.
-   The pilot of _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_ had the (female) Cylons' spines glow during sex. This was dropped for the rest of the series, however, as a major plot point early on was how to detect the Cylons among the fleet and was pointed out that Baltar had a Cylon detector in his pants.
-   _Farscape_:
    -   In the premiere episode, Zhaan gives John Crichton a Smooch of Victory by pressing her ear against his. From the expression on Crichton's face, it's implied _something naughty_ happened. She also speaks coyly to D'Argo of having experienced "The Fourth Sensation", but unfortunately, we don't find out what that is.
    -   The Hynerian "ear brow" is very sensitive.
    -   Zhaan's "photogasms". As one character put it "She's a plant. Put her in the light and watch her smile."
    -   A Luxan's "tenkas." The tentacles on a Luxan's head are very sensitive, though in the show, it's usually to pain. Though during the body-switching episode, D'argo notes that his "tenkas are a little sore," and he wonders what Chiana was doing with them. Knowing Chiana, she was enjoying her (new) self. A lot.
-   An episode of _Merlin (2008)_ has Arthur react with distinct pleasure when Gwen strokes his recently acquired donkey ears (long story).
-   From _Saturday Night Live_ we have the Coneheads, aliens with, what else? Cone-shaped heads! And they have some sort of game or something where they put a special ring on said cones. This game has something to do with sex.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   The Ferengi, whose ears are an erogenous zone (and "oo-mox" is basically a sex act involving stroking the ears).
    -   Also in _Trek_, we discover that Cardassians get a bit hot and bothered when somebody strokes their neck ridges.
    -   For Vulcans, the touching of fingers seems to be equivalent to a kiss. There's a sort of finger caress that's a bit more intimate as well. That's because Vulcans have psychic powers that work by touch. Brushing fingertips specifically isn't anything special, quite the opposite - it's the most skin contact they'll allow in public.
    -   May or may not be indicative of all male Talaxians, but Neelix gets aroused by someone tugging at his whiskers.
-   _The 10th Kingdom_: For Wolf, it's the tail. He even gets do use it in a Something Else Also Rises sort of way now and then.
-   An Italian comedy show once had a sketch featuring an interview with a woman with a wandering G-spot. Obviously, when the host shook her hand...

-   Quantus the Tech Priest (David's character from Fandible's long-running series of _Rogue Trader_ episodes) is equipped with a very... _versatile_ set of mecha\-dendrites.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Some of the research notes in the _Warhammer 40,000_ fluff book _Xenology_ point out that an Eldar's ears are packed with nerve endings and are highly sensitive. The deuteragonist adds "Speculation: Erogenous?" at the end of the notes.
-   Elves are noted as having sensitive ears in some _Dungeons & Dragons_ sourcebooks, which has led to scenes in D&D novels of elven characters making out by rubbing or kissing each others' ears.
-   One _Shadowrun 4th Edition_ book talks about Shifters, which in Shadowrun are animals that can change into metahumans. One character begins discussing interspecies relationships with Shifters and begins to talk about how they have different erogenous zones than humans. Another character immediately censors them when they start going into details, citing Too Much Information.

    Video Games 

-   In the _Old World Blues_ DLC for _Fallout: New Vegas_, Dr. Dala is disturbingly fascinated by your breathing due to the fact that as a Brain in a Jar, she hasn't had a body of her own in centuries. It's even possible to induce The Immodest Orgasm in her after finding this out.
-   _Mass Effect 2_:
    -   The infamous conversation where Mordin offers Shepard sex advice hints at this trope, with Mordin offering aides to Shepard which includes "erogenous zone overviews" when romancing either Garrus or Tali, neither of which are human.
    -   An easily missed conversation in _Lair of the Shadow Broker_ mentions the "Azure", or slang for an asari erogenous zone "in the lower reaches, near the bottom." The end of the DLC hints that this is in the lower back, since if you're still faithful to Liara, at the end, Shepard's hand goes to said spot, which instantly turns her eyes black with a smile on her face, along with a gasp.
-   A fan-made modification to the main campaign of _Neverwinter Nights 2_ gives Neeshka, the resident tiefling of your party, an... interesting... reaction if you try manipulating her tail without warning.
-   In _Persona 3_, Aigis apparently experiences pleasure when someone touches her Papillon Heart which is located on her neck. During Rank 10 of her social link she asks the Protagonist to touch it and apologises in advance if she makes any strange noises.
-   In _Planescape: Torment_, Annah's skin gets hot when she, uh, gets hot. To the point that she'll start giving off steam. She also finds having her tail touched to be extremely stimulating.
-   In _Portal 2_, GLaDOS and Wheatley get what GLaDOS calls a "euphoric response" whenever a test subject solves a test, as a form of positive feedback to encourage testing. GLaDOS compares it to a drug addiction and mentions withdrawal, but the latter's reactions go into The Immodest Orgasm territory.
-   In _Sam & Max: Freelance Police: What's New, Beelzebub?_, there's a Workplace Sexual Harassment chart which indicates the zones where Sam should not be touched as his crotch and his floppy dog ears. Shambling Corporate Presence's are in a variety of obscure places, the most obvious being the ends of his tentacles. Max just has a big question mark over his body along with a Stop sign and the caption 'approach with caution'.
-   In _Star Control II_, the Slylandro's "glowy bits" are visible to humans but not to Slylandro; the fact that humans can see them makes at least one Slylandro more... stimulated.
    
    **Slylandro:** Ah... your species sees in a different spectrum than we do. We can't see those. As for what they are... erm... well, they're used for... um... when a male and a female... uh, look, can we talk about something else?
    
-   In _World of Warcraft_, the female Pandaren player character has a /flirt emote: "Don't touch the taaail!... Okay, NOW touch the tail!"
-   Knowing this trope will actually help you succeed in the weirdly erotic Dungeon Crawler _Moero Chronicles_. Your adventuring-team consists entirely of Cute Monster Girls, most of whom you must first fight and then free from a dark influence, by way of filling them with 'positive energy'... that is, teasing them to an Immodest Orgasm. This involves using the touch-screen (or your mouse, in the PC-port) to rub, poke, tickle or otherwise stimulate various areas of their anatomy, looking for designated 'weak spots'. And more often than not, those 'weak spots' include their various nonhuman features, such as ears, wings, tails, tentacles - even EQUIPMENT that you wouldn't normally guess was part of their body, like the Will-o'-the-Wisp's umbrella.
-   _Undertale_ implies this with one of the only two voiced lines in the game. When you flip Mettaton's switch, he is heard saying "Oh, yes." in a tone that sounds like the action turned him on.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _Dra+Koi_ the 'reverse scale' is apparently some sort of erogenous zone and weak point at the same time. It's not entirely clear.
-   The incubi and succubi in _Seduce Me (Otome)_ are shown to have very sensitive horns that act as a general erogenous zone, though this only comes up in the sequel. Animal demons, like the cat girl Eric is seen flirting with, are also shown to have unique erogenous zones, presumably based on their individual animals.
-   In _Fate/hollow ataraxia_, magicians can store emergency reserves of mana in their hair by washing it with a special shampoo. It's unclear exactly what's _in_ the shampoo, but when a magician who doesn't know how to use it gets some on his skin, he starts feeling very, uh, itchy.
    -   Rider- not being a magician- can't replenish her mana in the usual way, so she drinks blood instead. She enjoys _that_ in exactly the same way, though.
-   In _VA-11 HALL-A_, Alma's description of hacking computers is enough to send Dorothy, a sentient android, into a truly _desperate_ state of arousal.

    Webcomics 

-   In _Keychain of Creation_, Marena, the foxy Lunar Exalted, gets _very_ turned on when Racer, a fellow Lunar, starts stroking her ears. Which Secret makes a note of...
-   The D'Bo sisters from _Our Home Planet_ are somewhat of an odd example: Their antennae secrete a protein, that, simply said, at one point causes Rika's finger to have an orgasm. It hasn't been shown, but given that the antennae are said to be the most sensitive parts of their biology and that they're reproductive organs, fiddling with them should have this effect.
-   In _TwoKinds_, Basitin ears are very sensitive and, as Keith later confesses to Natani, to rub someone's ear is an intimate gesture for their society. Later Flora is shown with a sensitive tail, and Raine also seems to have a sensitive tail.
-   For Uryuom in _El Goonish Shive_ empathy / limited telepathy does most of the job (they are androgynous, anyway). It's far from being limited to their own species and this property is inheritable. The genetic lottery leaves some Half Human Hybrids without the human form of attraction and others with a combination of both.
-   _Dangerously Chloe_. Succubi horns are apparently quite sensitive, though that's Pandora masquerading as Chloe. Chloe's horns are _much_ larger.
-   For centaurs in _Hotblood!_, the horse chest, withers, where their (human) hips would be, and backs/shoulders/necks are erogenous/sensitive.
-   In _Drowtales_, Ariel gets, ahem, _considerable_ pleasure out of her hair being combed, leading to some fans to speculate this trope being in play. Ariel, after all, is a Voluntary Shapeshifter who can turn her hair prehensile at will. It would only take a small extrapolation for it to be sensitive as well.
-   Troll horns in _Homestuck_ are implied to be erogenous zones due to some dialogue between Gamzee Makara and Karkat Vantas. Naturally, the fandom went nuts with it.
-   Downplayed in _The Monster Under the Bed_, where the titular monsters' tails are erogenous zones equivalent to human lips; twining tails together is equivalent to kissing for them.

    Web Original 

-   _Cosmos Eternal_:
    -   The Fellpool race (no relation to _Star Ocean_) have prehensile furry monkey-like tails that keep them balanced when moving, and give them innate skill with acrobatics, and is a heavy erogenous zone. Stroking it can make a Fellpool purr like a cat, heavy stroking can make them sexually aroused. Light nibbling, licking, and other acts can make them orgasm. The main character at one point strips down because of how hot the arousal is making her (much to her crew's mixed reactions). And this affects Fellpools of all genders, but only applies when someone _else_ rubs their tail. On the opposite scale, damage to the tail can be so unbearable that a Fellpool can pass out. Getting their tail cut off has even made some Fellpool who aren't combat-trained die from the pain.
    -   Featherfolk (also no relation to _Star Ocean_) with their wings. The downside, however, is that their wings are so goddamn sensitive that just grabbing one can make them cry out in agony. Plucking even a single feather is painful enough to make them pass out or empty their bowels. Serenity apparently had her rare golden feathers plucked by slavers, which is noted in that her wings have some patches with no feathers. It's explicitly stated that, theoretically, a Featherfolk _could_ feel pleasure from their wings' sensitivity. But their sensitivity is so great that few things can tough them light enough to cause pleasure without crossing into pain. Serenity is noted as enjoying light breezes, it seems... Hmm...
    -   Chimeras, animal-human hybrids, get this treatment with their ears and tails.
-   For Shirelings in _Tales of MU_, it's strongly implied to be the _feet_.

    Western Animation 

-   In _Gargoyles_, Gargoyles stroke their mate's hair instead of, perhaps, kissing. Gets a tad awkward when human Elisa Maza accidentally touches gargoyle Goliath's hair.
-   Spoofed in a _Robot Chicken_ short; a character wishes for unicorns to be real, after which one appears at his window and takes him away to have "fun adventures"... which include stripping down and polishing his "magic horn".
-   In _Futurama_, Bender's antenna is treated as a surrogate penis.
-   In _He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983)_, Trollans always obscure their faces with their scarves and hats. Because in their culture, showing faces is an intimate gesture. This is shown in one episode when Orko revisits his homeworld and flirts with his crush Dree-Elle towards the conclusion. Another episode reveals that not all Trollans hide their faces, as shown with the Trollan country of Karadania that doesn't share the tradition.
