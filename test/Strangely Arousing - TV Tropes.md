_"I have the weirdest boner right now."_

Sometimes, someone will come upon something they don't understand, or simply cannot comprehend. Maybe it's two (or more) people engaged in something so Head-Tiltingly Kinky that it blows their mind. Maybe it is an Eldritch Abomination made of nothing but tentacles and gaping orifices. Maybe it's Australian-rules football. It doesn't matter. All that we know is that:

1.  They have no clue what is happening.
2.  It's _**hot!**_

Strangely Arousing is a trope that takes people far beyond the brink of arousal, with no understanding of why. The confusing element doesn't even have to be sexual in _any_ way. Nor does the character have to be one that responds sexually to everything. In fact, the trope works infinitely better if the inciting incident _isn't_ indecent. Though if it is, it should be so far gone beyond "normal" sexuality it comes out the other side.

Compare Head-Tiltingly Kinky. Note that Stupid Sexy Flanders is a very mild form of the trope, limited only to an unusual homoerotic sensation. Can overlap Fantastic Arousal, but only when a party witnesses it without understanding it, or to further drive home a sense of Blue-and-Orange Morality. Can also be referenced later as a Call-Back when we later find the character has embraced this trope and turned it into a personal fetish.

Shirogane then give Matsuri a Dope Slap, with the obvious suggestion that watching someone else do things to Suzu was arousing him.
