_"If a man could pass through Paradise in a dream, and have a flower presented to him as a pledge that his soul had really been there, and if he found that flower in his hand when he awake — aye, what then?"_

An object that proves the adventure the main characters had written off as All Just a Dream was not a dream after all. Usually something relatively small and conspicuous, which may have been a MacGuffin at a previous stage of the story. It's found shortly after the protagonist "wakes up", and usually right after they begin to question the reality of their experience. It may be used in The Stinger. Sometimes it's never found by a character, and is only shown to the audience in a kind of wink from the creator, but this can leave the audience unsatisfied, as it leaves the characters believing that their entire adventure never happened.

This can be played with elements of ambiguity. Sometimes the keepsake is definitely from the dreamworld and even has supernatural powers; at other times, it's a relatively mundane trinket whose presence is at best somewhat implausible, and which may have alternate explanations. Worse, finding an item from a dream can lead a character to question the reality of their waking life.

This plot device isn't only employed in dream sequences. Many a protagonist has returned from the Magical Land with a souvenir, sometimes a powerful one that will give them an edge in their ordinary life. This way, the audience is assured that they won't languish in mundanity from now on. At the least, the item can be used to quell people who doubt the protagonist's story, though few will be really convinced.

Sister trope to Fantasy All Along. Compare Taken from a Dream, where an item is retrieved from what is, indeed, a dream in-universe.

**Commonly an Ending Trope, so beware of spoilers.**

-   In _Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers_, the key from Gabriel's dream magically appears next morning by his bedside.

-   Zig-zagged in _Romancing Saga 3_ when Muse, an already ill-in-bed lady, is poisoned by Jackal with a potion (maliciously claimed to be medicine) that causes her to be trapped in a dream dungeon. From the outside, she looks alive, but unconscious of the world around her and struggling. Sharl, a dear friend of Muse (with one missing hand) who was trying to nurse her back to health, suggests drinking the potion too so he can try to help her, and the player has the option to join him (refusing causes him to drink the potion alone, and both Sharl and Muse become permanently removed as players for the rest of the game, effectively dead.) The resulting dungeon has random encounters significantly more powerful than normal, and the boss of the dungeon is effectively That One Boss. However, the dungeon has a few items in it, two notable: the Dream Tears, a powerful consumable that heals all health and mana when used in combat (although it doesn't cure LP, the stat that limits how many times you can be revived), and the Silver Hand, a Gamebreaker item that lets Sharl attack as normal (with boosted stats), or lets other units make two normal attacks in a turn. Defeating the one-time dungeon cures Muse and causes the Dream Tears to disappear from your inventory since they are a figment of the dream. However, the Silver Hand is explicitly noted to NOT disappear, representing the bond and gratitude of Muse toward Sharl and her desire to help him. The two then become available as party members.
-   In _Spellcasting 101: Sorcerers Get All The Girls_, the spells used in a simulation of rescuing a princess are supposed to be removed by the supervising professor when the simulation ends, but by sitting in the simulation chair after the university has been raided and the professor is no longer present, the simulation can be made to proceed past its usual end point and the player character keeps the spells after waking up.
-   In _Tomodachi Life_, your Miis can dream about various weird stuff. When they wake up, you get a gift related to their dream.
-   In _Touhou Project_'s official works, Maribel Hearn, a young woman from 20 Minutes into the Future with the power to see the "boundaries" between worlds and concepts, has a habit of crossing into the games' setting of Gensokyo when she falls asleep and waking up with things she found during her "dreams," like cookies from the Scarlet Devil Mansion or bamboo from the Bamboo Forest of the Lost, which she shows off to her friend Renko Usami. This goes both ways, and Gensokyo's resident historian has a baffling scrap of paper from hundreds of years ago that mentions things like cell phones, GPSes, and a memo to "tell Renko about it when I wake up." The cherry on top is that Maribel looks awfully like a younger Yukari Yakumo, _youkai_ of boundaries, and recent stories about Mary show her now able to freely and consciously cross to other worlds...
-   _Xenosaga_ has the Encephalon, which is a curious aversion. It's supposed to be a virtual reality taken from your mind, but you can go into it, gain levels, come back with items, and even go into places that were behind locked doors when you visited the places in reality and couldn't have been taken from your mind. This has no implications at all and is at best a version of Gameplay and Story Segregation.

    Web Original

    Western Animation 

-   In the _Bob's Burgers_ episode "Dream A Little Bob of Bob", Bob falls asleep looking for a key he lost somewhere inside his car, and then dreams he is small so he can find it better.

However, when she goes to show the jacket to the rest of the crew, what she has is her own jacket and not Fry's. Ultimately, it turns out that _all_ of this was a coma-induced dream, and she's the one who almost died.

Wirt's friends can be seen looking surprised by this just as the episode is ending.
