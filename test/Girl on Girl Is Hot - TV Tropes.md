...Well, hot enough to set you on _fire,_ that is.

_"Hey, wadda ya know. Look at that. A lesbian sighting. Ho-hoo, my lucky day...  
They're so fascinating. Why is that? 'Cause they don't want us. \*clicks tongue\*  
You gotta respect that."_

It is widely believed that every man attracted to women is, deep inside, turned on by two or more women interacting sexually. The idea is that if a woman having sex is arousing, then _two_ women having sex is _twice_ as arousing. Plus, a straight man watching doesn't have to waste mental energy ignoring any male nudity.

Despite what logic may suggest, the prevalence of this trope does _not_ equate to acceptance of homosexuality. Many have noted the hypocrisy of straight men who pleasure themselves to two women getting it on while condemning LGBTQ rights with equal fervor. Even where this trope is concerned, the women involved are always presented in a manner that's attractive to men: long hair, makeup, conventional femininity, etc. Rarely will you see a Butch Lesbian sexualized unless the work is made specifically for queer women.

Since young men are key demographics for networks and advertisers, and because Most Writers Are Male, lesbian fanservice aimed at them flourishes. See: Catfight; Fanservice Faux Fight; Lovely Angels; Pseudo-Romantic Friendship; Sweeps Week Lesbian Kiss; and Skinship Grope. Also a frequent appeal of the yuri media. Expect a male character to feel that Girl-On-Girl Is Hot when All Men Are Perverts is in play. A much more twisted version of this trope may be Double Standard: Rape, Female on Female. Of course, lesbians in the real world tend to see this trope as being fetishizing, creepy, or even dehumanizing, similarly to how gay men tend to find the trope's male equivalent equally offputting. Due to this, any works that include this in-universe trope often require a certain amount of tact and sensitivity to keep the story fun and characters sympathetic. It is certainly doable, however.

This trope is for in-universe character reactions to female/female titillation, not for every time you think a lesbian love scene was intended for male fanservice. For fanservice that doesn't involve a voyeur, see Les Yay. For those who _are_ interested in the romantic and emotional aspects of lesbian relationships, see Yuri Fan. For the rapidly increasing Spear Counterpart, see Guy on Guy Is Hot.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Early in the _Ah! My Goddess_ manga (the 15th chapter), during a beauty contest at Nekomi Tech, Urd hooked a finger into the top of Sayoko's swimsuit and took a good look inside. "Just checking ... and mine _are_ bigger!" The watching males were going ape, and Otaki, acting as an announcer, said, "Now, now, Miss Urd! No trying for bonus point!"
-   _Blend-S_ has the chef Kōyō Akizuki, whose obsession with yuri makes him desire to witness female best friends doing casually intimate things together, like sharing dessert, examining and fondling each other's bodies, etc. This makes him wish that the cafe, which is male orientated due to the waitresses being attractive female archetypes, had more female customers.
    -   In the second episode of the anime, Akizuki tests the idea of female customers by having Maika and Kaho feed each other dessert. He naturally gets pretty turned on by it. At the end of the same episode, the cafe gets a pair of female customers. But they're not exactly what Akizuki was hoping for.
-   In _Bloom Into You_, Touko plays the main character in the play, while Sayaka plays her lover. Koyomi, who wrote the play, made the choice because people thought they were like a married couple. Doujima pesters Koyomi to add a kiss scene, and when Sayaka's character takes the stage during the actual play, the crowd goes wild. Sayaka, who's in love with Touko (who doesn't return her feelings) is not amused.
-   Sunohara in _CLANNAD_ was overloading with hormones when he and Tomoya tricked Ryou into thinking that Nagisa is going to confess her love to her, and the entire thing started playing out like something straight out of a Yuri Genre anime, complete with Intertwined Fingers and roses blooming.
-   In an episode of the third season of _The Familiar of Zero_, Saito was visibly...interested when the girls took an OD of Love Potion while he wasn't around...
-   During the pocky scene between Yomi and Kagura in _Ga-Rei -Zero-_, Kazuki was obviously interested, if initially embarrassed, in what was going on in the backseat. The pilot couldn't care less.
-   _Ghost Talker's Daydream_: Deliberately invoked by Misaki's co-worker, Shizue, in chapter 5, when she arranges to do a photo shoot for a lesbian magazine; featuring the two of them doing S&M play. The photographers were snapping so many shots they were running out of film!
-   _Girls Bravo_: The reason Fukuyama hosts his private underground "Girls Fight!" competition. And to ensure there's plenty of eye candy for himself and the crowd, he's set the rules so the ladies have to wear progressively smaller swimsuits as they advance in the rankings.
-   In later episodes of _Haruhi Suzumiya_ Taniguchi and Kunikida start drooling upon seeing Tsuruya affectionately rub Mikuru.
-   At one point in _Heaven's Lost Property_, Tomoki is trying to meditate when he suddenly imagines Ikaros and Nymph embracing suggestively. He gets a Raging Stiffie.
-   The Cat Fight version happens in _Irresponsible Captain Tylor_. The crew is covertly bugging the snarkfest between Lt. Commander Yuriko Star and Lt. Kim, and express disappointment that they're not throwing punches at each other.
-   In _Kotoura-san_, Manabe once shouted this trope out when he mistook the relationship between Haruka and Yuriko as Pseudo-Romantic Friendship.
-   _Kuromukuro_ has Kennosuke get flustered after Yukina mentions that Muetta undressed her.
-   _Lady Snowblood_: A brothel enjoys tremendous success because of "Toichi Haichi"; basically they have male spectators pay to watch lesbian sex.
-   One of the earlier examples in manga and anime is in _Maison Ikkoku_ when Godai gets a nosebleed when watching a completely drunk off her gourd Akemi kiss Kyoko right on the lips.
-   The finale of _Majokko Meg-chan_ has a Catfight between Meg and Non that has blatant sexual undertones, and the scene constantly cuts to Chou getting off on it.
-   _Maken-ki!_:
    
    **Takeru:** _(thinking)_ "Dammit—!! We missed a chance to see Aki-sensei and Haru-nee sleeping (with their breasts squeezing against each other)!"
    
    **Usui:** _(thinking, at Takeru)_ "We missed it and it's _YOUR_ fault!!"
    
    -   The preface page of chapter 45 shows Takaki and Yuuka spooning together in lingerie, while Yuuka's hand is down the front of Takaki's panties. However, the caption explains the scene has nothing to do with the story and is purely for fanservice.
    -   In chapter 69, Takaki and Haruko explain what Love Espada did to them at the previous Himekagura Festival. Not only were Takeru and Usui okay with it, they lament not being there to see it.
    -   Near the end of chapter 76, Usui eavesdrops as Espada has sex with Kyoki in one of the school's clubrooms and gets a nosebleed, as he imagines it. But the reality ends up being more than he hoped for.
-   Likewise, Nagasumi from _My Bride is a Mermaid_ when Sun and Akeno "did it in the bath" in episode 18. They were just testing how long they can endure water before reverting into their mermaid form but it sounded just the right way...
    -   The boys happily eavesdrop on Mawari indulging in Skinship Grope with the Class Rep.
-   _Naruto_: This is Naruto's reaction to Konohamaru's jutsu appropriately named Sexy: Girl on Girl technique. Sakura called the two perverts... until Konohamaru then tried the Guy on Guy variation. The anime dropped the male version.
-   Like most Skinship Grope scenes, this comes into play at the end of the _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ episode "Magma Diver." Shinji is quite intrigued by what he hears coming from the women's side of the hot spring where Asuka and Misato are bathing.
-   In _One Piece_, Franky was rather pleased when he saw Nami searching Kalifa for a key.
-   Maybe, Kyouya Ohtori from _Ouran High School Host Club_. He _did_ think that the Accidental Kiss between Haruhi and Miyako was, well, "nice."
-   Invoked in _The Ones Within_ by Roromori. As their objective is to raise their viewer count, and knowing that they're probably being constantly monitored, she flirts with fellow female participant Sarayashiki to see if it'll attract more viewers. Sure enough, it does.
-   In the _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_ manga, Brief reminisces about one time when Stocking crashed his party and had a lesbian orgy, which he and his friends filmed the whole thing on tape and used it as fuel a hundred times.
-   During one episode of _Soul Eater_, the city was being destroyed by an escaping Eldritch Abomination who ends up squaring off against Death, and a bunch of men are watching the cat-fight between Blair and Mizune.

    Comedy 

-   In one of his routines, Dave Chappelle calls it the "_one penis per fantasy rule_": where lesbian sex is far more pleasurable to the average male viewer (and less violent, mind you).
-   George Carlin. From the part about tollbooths from the "New Jersey and License Plates" section of "More Stuff About Cars and Driving" from his 1988 album _What Am I Doing In New Jersey?_:
    
    "Or just tell them, 'I don't have any quarters, I spent all my money on pussy and beer.' That'll wake them up. Especially if you're a woman!"
    

    Comic Books 

-   _Champions_: In an issue of _Champions (2016)_, Viv Vision tries making out with Amadeus Cho to try to understand this "love" thing. She doesn't get the appeal, but suggests she might have to try with a different gender. The lads are all visibly disappointed that Kamala Khan isn't feeling experimental.
-   _Echo_: When Ivy Raven is starting to be seriously disturbed by the changes to her body, particularly that her mind is regressing in addition to her body, she instructs Dillon to not sleep with Julie since that is how she first began to be changed by the alloy.

When June "awakens," Dove is gone, but June has a vague memory of her getting very angry and saying something about a male fantasy...
-   In Alan Moore's _Lost Girls_, Alice recalls having sex with other girls at boarding school which made everyone else aroused. She later recounts visiting an opium dealer who enjoyed watching women playing with each other.
-   In one _MAD_, there was an article composed of strips deconstructing various sexual hypocrisies. One had two men and two women are walking home from a movie with a lesbian sex scene that the men enjoyed, claiming that it's because the act of making love is beautiful. When the women ask what they would think of two men doing the same, the men immediately say that they find it disgusting.
-   _The Maze Agency_: In the story "The Two Wrong Rhoades," Jen and Ashley (both dressed in Spy Catsuits) end up grappling each other in a darkened room. Upon hitting the lights, Gabe's reaction is:
    
    "With a few gallons of mud, and some beer, my evening would be complete!"
    
-   Invoked in a comic by Ignacio Noe: a man, upon finding his wife apparently cheating on him with a female friend, is aroused rather than angry. But once the man's had his fun watching/joining them and gone back out, the woman's actual paramour is revealed to be a guy who'd been hiding in the other room, along with the man who'd been sleeping with her friend. It turns out the women had heard the husband at the door and decided to take advantage of this trope by feigning bisexuality.

-   _Red Ears_: The series exploits this trope.
-   _Runaways_: During a game of "Truth or Dare," Karolina, Chase, and Victor goad Nico into revealing which of them is the best kisser.

During a later appearance in _Avengers Academy_, Chase's opinion of the Academy is improved after finding out that Lightspeed is bisexual and that there's some chemistry between her and Karolina.
-   _Scott Pilgrim_: The series makes a lot of discussions and references to lesbians being hot.
    -   The titular Scott once owned a lame poster of two chicks kissing.
    -   This exchange:
        
        **Scott**: So, have you ever kissed a girl?  
        **Ramona**: Yes.  
        **Scott**: (shivering with delight)
        
    -   During Ramona and Envy's fight scene in Volume 3 (_Scott Pilgrim and the Infinite Sadness_), an onlooker yells "Make out!"
    -   In the side story _Free Scott Pilgrim_ (published for _Free Comic Book Day 2006_ and later featured as an extra in the color edition of Volume 3), Scott's first question at the Winifred Hailey poster characters coming alive to confront him is "Are they going to _**make out?!?!**_"
    -   In Volume 4 (_Scott Pilgrim Gets It Together_):
        -   Scott accidentally sees Kim and Knives making out while drunk, but it's subverted since he reacts with and leaves in shock. We can only guess listening to the two of them (who were both in love with him) complain about boys prior caused Scott some self-esteem issues.
        -   When Scott finds Ramona and Roxie casually chatting at his newfound restaurant workplace, he angrily walks up to the two and asks if Roxie is dating one of Ramona's "evil ex-boyfriends." He's initially puzzled when Ramona responds by correcting to him (in one of many times) that they're her "evil exes," until he ends up getting that Roxie is Ramona's fourth evil ex, at which he outright yells "YOU HAD A SEXY PHASE?!"
    -   In Volume 5 (_Scott Pilgrim vs. The Universe_) Scott says "Make out!" when he sees a drunk Ramona and Kim starting to cuddle.
-   _Supergirl_: Happens three times in _Identity_
    -   When Supergirl returns to her apartment, her roommate Boomer aka Captain Boomerang Jr., asks how her day was.
        
        **Supergirl:** I met a girl tonight.  
        **Boomer:** _\[Double Take, then grin\]_ Explain. And _do not_ leave out _any_ details.  
        **Supergirl:** _\[hits him with a pillow\]_ Idiot... Another hero in a costume.
        
    -   When Supergirl and Wonder Girl hug, with Kara's arms around Cassie's neck, and Cassie's arms around Kara's waist.
        
        **Kid Devil:** Can't talk. Committing image to memory.  
        **Ravager:** Someone get a video camera... We'll get two billion hits on YouTube.
        
    -   When a guy asks his girlfriend and Supergirl to hug and let him take a picture.
-   In _Tomorrow Stories Special_ #1, Cobweb and Clarice are caught in an inescapable Death Trap. Thinking they are about to die, they reveal their true feelings for each other and kiss. The villain is so turned on that he shuts off the Death Trap so he can watch them make out.
-   _Ultimate Spider-Man_: During the "Venom" arc, Peter and MJ have this exchange while reconciling after a bad breakup:

    **Mary Jane:** You wish.
    
-   _XXXenophile_: This exchange from the story "Heart of Stone," when Feljikk, Avery and Hinks arrive in the aftermath of a lesbian threeway caused by the Deus Sex Machina Mineral Macguffin:
    
    **Feljikk:** I see we missed the party.  
    **Otaz:** Not your kind of party.  
    **Feljikk, Avery, Hinks:** (_in unison_) Sez you!
    
-   _Y: The Last Man_: Yorick, the last man on Earth, finally meets up with his former girlfriend Beth in Paris after nearly five years Walking the Earth. Beth claims she does not care what the world's most eligible bachelor has been up to in the time they have been separated.
    
    **Beth:** If I got it on with ladies while we were apart, I'm sure you wouldn't want to hear every little...  
    **Yorick:** (_eagerly_) You were with _ladies_?
    
    -   Also averted: when he walks in on 355 and Dr. Mann together, he just says "This is the weirdest fucking nightmare I've ever had." That line has more impact within the context of the series since his disturbing and horrifying nightmares make frequent appearances. 355, the experienced, lethal government operative, has explained that she would not be willing to endure even _one night_ of what he goes through.
-   _Young Justice_: As Zen speedster Max Mercury once told Dubbilex in one issue, "There's only two things a man can bring to a Catfight: popcorn and a comfortable chair."

    Fan Works 

-   _Code Geass: The Prepared Rebellion_ has Rivalz (and to a lesser degree, Suzaku) get turned on to the point of distraction by the flirting between C.C. and Milly. Lelouch, being used to such activities thanks to his bedroom escapades, is able to ignore them.
-   _Doing It Right This Time_: According Asuka, Shinji always likes watching when she and Rei make out.
-   In _Kyon: Big Damn Hero_, Kyon had a dream involving Adult!Mikuru and Mikuru. He stopped thinking about it before going into any detail.
-   In the _Fairy Tale Friday_ version of _Beauty and the Beast_, Belle walks in on the beast watching lesbian porn. She takes it as an opportunity to improve his mind by recommending _Blue Is the Warmest Color_.
-   In _Kara of Rokyn_, Van-Ol watches Kara and Jara sparring. He ponders the scene is... interesting.
    
    To see her pitting her strength and skills against another woman, both of them clad only in bikinis, was, he had to admit... stimulating.
    
-   _Naru-Hina Chronicles_:
    -   Yori sees two girls arguing and thinks they're talking about doing some girl-on-girl action, which he finds to be really hot, and he even hopes to have a threesome with them. In reality, the two girls were Naruto and Sasuke after using the Sexy Jutsu to become girls and infiltrate the village during the Chunin Exam, and their argument was about Sasuke really not liking the idea of someone seeing him like that.
    -   Konohamaru thinking about Moegi and Hanabi. Subverted, though; all three of them realize there are way too many emotional landmines in their mutual friendship to make such an act feasible. Only time will tell if they ever manage to work their issues out.
    -   In one of the Mini-sodes, Hinata insists on giving a gift to Naruto. The latter reluctantly admits that one thing he would love is seeing her kissing Sakura, much to Hinata's shock.
-   The rules for a fan-art contest run by the _Naruto: The Abridged Series_ creators; "NO YAOI... we _really_ don't want to see it. NO YURI... it's not that we don't want to see it but..."
-   In _Neon Metathesis Evangelion_, Shinji has had some... _entertaining_ thoughts about Rei and Asuka kissing. Or Asuka atop a naked Rei, as happened in variance to canon in Rei's apartment. He feels rather bad and guilty about this.
-   In chapter 3 of _No, Chika, You, We do NOT Make Out to Show Our Friendship!_, when the other members of Aquor catch Chika and You in a "friendship" kissing session, Riko needs an entire box of tissues to deal with the Nosebleed from her fantasy of her fellow idols together. And when the two kiss to finally embrace their feelings for each other, Riko flat out faints and her friends have to take her to the hospital.
    
    **Riko**: Ah…I got to see ChikaYou Yuri…I can make so much fanfiction…and burn this into my memory…  
    **Dia**: Take her to the hospital!  
    **Riko**: NO DONT TAKE ME THERE I WANT TO DIE HAPPY
    
-   In an omake for _Nothing but Trouble_, while in line to motorboat Tsunade, Mei offers to let Tsunade motorboat her afterwards. Everyone present agrees to move Mei up the queue until she's next in line.
-   In _Opening Dangerous Gates_, the guys all do typical Nosebleed and other reactions when Cana playfully gropes Lucy. They do this again when Rangiku glomps Lucy and ends up straddling her with their breasts pressing together.
-   In _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_, apparently many challengers lost in the Celadon Gym because they were too busy focused on the members of the staff making out with each other to concentrate on their battles. Erika wasn't amused by this.

-   In _Ranma ½: The Abridged Chronicles_, Kunō believes that it's always a good time for girl-on-girl action.
-   Played with in the _NCIS_ fic _Shards to a Whole_. Early on, when Tim and Abby make love for the first time in years, Abby admits that she enjoyed some of Tim's early erotic novels (described as a lesbian "_The Dresden Files_ meets _Anita Blake_" with the leading character modeled loosely on Abby). Later, as a Valentine's day gift for their men, Abby and Jimmy Palmer's wife Breena have Ziva take photos of the two of them making out. Both Tim and Jimmy approve. This turns out to be foreshadowing for later chapters, when the Palmers and the McGees enter into a long-term polyamorous relationship with each other. Abby identifies herself as bi while the otherwise-straight Breena invokes If It's You, It's Okay.
-   _Superwomen of Eva 2: Lone Heir of Krypton_: Shinji thinks so in chapter five's omake. Due to radiation from a special chunk of kryptonite, Asuka seduces Misato and both women start making out. After seeing what they were doing, Shinji called his friend Kensuke and told him getting over there and for the love of God, bring his camera.
-   In _Suzumiya Haruhi No Index_, when the adult Asahina from the future gives Kaori Kanzaki a hug, resulting in their boobs pressing together, Kyon finds it arousing, then berates himself for his dirty thoughts.
-   Cloud Angle from Kid Icarus Uprising 2 Hades Revenge is this type of male, constantly reminding the readers that 'lesbeans' are cute.
-   Subverted by A.A. Pessimal in a chapter of the _Discworld_ fic **There's Nothing Like a Fresh Pair of Eyes...**which was advertised as containing _hot girl-on-girl action_. There is. But the hot action is a duel between the heroine and the School Bully during a sword-fighting lesson, in which the bully is royally trounced by a hitherto disregarded opponent. Who has recently received Igor-tooled eye implants cloned from a master sword-fighter.
-   In _Thousand Shinji_:
    -   When Rei mentions that Asuka dragged her into the shower stall, pinned her beneath the shower and scrubbed her body until she was fully lathered, Toji and Shinji get nosebleeds.
    -   Mentioned when Rei fantasizes about her and Asuka making out while Shinji watches "with amusement."
-   _This Bites!_:
    -   During the Alabasta arc, Cross tries to get Nami and Vivi to invoke this to inspire Scissors to fully run across the Sandora River. The girls disapprove. Violently.
    -   In the Skypiea Arc, Nami ends up kissing Robin in the midst of her gold-fueled euphoria.
-   In _Tickles your fancy_ (NSFW), Raven and Starfire end up having sex one night, even making a video. The next day, Raven is worried that she might have ruined the relationship between Starfire and Nightwing... but when she intends to go and talk to them, Beast Boy comes over, and reassures her that, judging by the sounds coming from inside Nightwing's room, it appears quite obvious he is _definitely_ not upset at having seen the movie. A later chapter has Raven and Beast Boy watching the video together as well.
-   In the (technically SFW) Black Comedy Rape\-filled _Touhou Project_ doujinshi _Acting on Instinct_, Reimu and Rinnosuke team up to molest various girls in Gensokyo. Specifically, Reimu does the molesting and Rinnosuke takes pictures, this trope being the motive of the whole thing for him.
-   _Ultra Fast Pony_:
    -   The episode "A Library With No Twilight" parodies this phenomenon. The Interactive Narrator clearly wants Applejack and Rarity to hook up and uses his narration to read entirely too much subtext into their interactions. Applejack and Rarity want no part of this, and eventually bond (platonically) by mocking the narrator.
    -   In "The Best Episode Ever," Twilight Sparkle tries to pander to the audience, but she misunderstands and thinks the fans want "smoking hot thespian action." So, the cast puts on a play, and the audience isn't amused.
-   In _The Unfantastic Adventures of Bizarro No. 1_, the Bizarro Justice League find Bizarro Supergirl and Bizarro Wonder Woman cat-fighting when they're going to pick them up. The Leaguers decide unanimously it'd be rude to interrupt.
-   In _The Wedding Crashers_, as part of a ploy to disrupt the titular wedding, Leah and Rosalie stage a cat fight followed by a makeout session on the dance floor. The Winchester brothers, Emmett, Embry, and just about every other young male watching approve greatly.
-   In the fifth Evil Council episode of _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_, Steve Lumis and Steve Umbra say that, on the moon, it's okay to be gay as long as it's women on women. And as long as they're invited.
    
    **Steve Lumis:** There ain’t no party like a zero-gravity lesbian moon-based party.
    
-   _B'Elannarella_. Anna Seven is challenged to a "butt-naked bed-wrestling" contest by the Rebel Leader B'Elannarella, causing the rebels to be caught with their pants down, "in many cases around their ankles" when the Queen's Royal Redshirts attack.
-   In _Kissing Starfire_, after an Operation: Jealousy attempt by Starfire and Beast Boy fails (the plan was to have Robin walk in on them kissing for allegedly language assimilation purposes), Raven decides to help Star instead, and also make Beast Boy jealous as well. The result was the boys seeing "a sight that left two with nosebleeds on the floor, and one stuck in a software freeze."
-   In _Lady Luck's Favor_, _Danny Phantom_ finds himself turned on when Ember's music causes Sam and Valerie to start making out.
-   "Only One Year": Rare Female Example: After seeing Elsa and Esmeralda engage in a very sensual dance and then passionately makeout in front of the whole club, Rapunzel is absolutely ecstatic; mostly it is because her friend is finally coming out of her shell, but also because she thought they looked really, _really_ hot together.

    Jokes 

-   The other day I was asked how I view lesbian relationships. Apparently 'In full HD' was the wrong answer.
-   My lesbian neighbors got me a Rolex for Christmas. It's a nice gift, but I don't think they understood me when I said "I wanna watch."

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _40 Days and 40 Nights_: A lesbian pair kiss in front of the celibate hero to try and make him break his celibacy.
-   _À l'aventure_: The man whom Sophie is involved with has his wife Mina kiss then go down on her while he watches. Soon he has sex with her too.
-   _All Cheerleaders Die_: Inverted In-Universe. Terry does not take Tracy hooking up with Maddy very well at all.
-   _Alto_: Nicolette is seen making out with a female baker at the beginning as her young male assistant gleefully watches, proclaiming it makes her baking better. Later he's also equally happy to see her and the female FBI agent together.
-   That entire scene in _American Pie 2_ where the boys break into a house with lesbians. They were willing to kiss and fondle each other, but they were Yaoi Fangirls as well. They wouldn't fondle each other unless the guys did stuff to each other as well. Naturally the women were willing to go all the way, but the boys struggled each step of the way and finally stopped before one touched the other's penis.
-   In _Le Bal des actrices_ by Maïwenn: Joey Starr asks his partner Maïwenn to kiss another woman, Estelle, who Maïwenn doesn't even like that much at that point. It kind of backfires when the two women start making out passionately and won't stop when Joey tells them to. Then Maiwenn falls head over heels for Estelle -her love unreciprocated and doesn't last long. Mostly played for laughs.
-   _Bet Your Life_: When Sonny is thinking about getting out of the elevator and not going to the penthouse, the two Gambler Groupies start making out to make him change his mind.
-   In _Bitter Moon_, classy lady-like Englishwoman Fiona goes dancing and seductive French Mimi instantly joins her. They start flirting with each other and go down on each other. The whole bar cheer them. Only Fiona's husband is little uneasy because _he_ wanted to sleep with Mimi.
-   _Blood of the Tribades_: Discussed when the priests of Bathor come upon Élisabeth and Fantine lying together partially nude after they've had sex. They call the pair "abominations" but Élisabeth says she can tell they're also turned on by seeing it, condemning this as hypocrites. None of them even try to deny it.
-   _The Butchers_: While trying to seduce Kip, Nicole and Candi start making out. Kip, who was anxious to get out there, decides that he has time to stop and watch.
-   Subverted in _Carry On Girls_, during the Catfight between Hope Springs and Dawn Brakes. None of the men in the room are aroused or excited about it (even the randy Admiral is speechless in terror), and Sid Fiddler tries desperately to break them up. Ultimately played straight in that Hope's goal was publicity.
-   _Chloe_: Chloe seduces Catherine and they have sex in the hotel. Once he finds out, David's reaction is muted, possibly because he finds this appealing instead of threatening.
-   _Colette_: The implicit homoeroticism between Claudine and other school girls in a major selling point for the books Colette writes, as Willy encourages, saying not only he but many other men will love this. After she's attracted to Georgie, a rich American woman, Willy also accepts this but makes it clear this only applies to women. Her seeing a man is _not_ okay with him. This however is violently subverted when Missy and Colette stage an erotic act at the Moulin Rouge.

-   Averted in _The Grand Budapest Hotel_; Zero and Gustave steal the valuable painting "Boy With Apple" and replace it with a funny pornographic painting (titled in the credits as "Two Lesbians Masturbating"), but Dmitri doesn't even notice the new painting (or indeed that the original one went missing from his family's house) until _much_ later.
-   In _Hatchet_, Jenna and Misty are introduced making out for a porno film.
-   _Holly Slept Over_: Noel is very interested when Audra tells him she once had a relationship with her roommate Holly in college, wanting to know details of what the two did (she demurs).

-   _Kissing Jessica Stein_:
    -   It is lampshaded in a hilarious scene. What makes it hilarious? Helen stroking Jessica's thigh under the table, and the fact that the guys to whom they are talking are completely oblivious to it. The guys they talk with say that it's because one woman may be sexy, but two is _double_ sexy.
    -   The taxi cab honking loudly as it drives past the scene where Helen kisses Jessica can be seen as this.
-   _Lethal Weapon_: Subverted. When Murtaugh suggests that a female murder victim had slept with a female prostitute, Riggs replies, "Okay. Disgusting, but okay." Unsurprising perhaps, considering Riggs is played by Mel Gibson.

-   In _Neighbors_, Kelly makes out with Brooke in the frat house to turn Pete on, and then makes out with him as well. Kelly finally manages to coerce the pair, Pete and Brooke, into making out afterwards, and later, sex.
-   _Night of the Demons (2009)_: While playing spin the bottle, Jason gets Maddie and Suzanne to kiss. The girls do, and actually seem to be getting into it, to Jason and Dex's obvious enjoyment. The subsequent request for guy-on-guy is played strictly for laughs.

-   In _Pirates XXX_, a group of pirates arrange a lesbian floor show as entertainment at the bucks night for one of their number who is getting married.

    "Dammit girls, I've told you before: If you're going to do that — do it on stage!"
    
-   Appears at the end of _Requiem for a Dream_, where Marion performs a lesbian sex act on stage so she could have money for drugs. The people who watch it in-story do find it hot, but the audience surely won't.

-   _Scott Pilgrim vs. The World_: Scott's reaction to discovering that one of Ramona's "Evil Exes" is a girl, which Ramona described as "just a phase."
    
    **Scott Pilgrim:** You had a sexy phase?
    
-   Marty thinks this at the beginning of _The Sex Monster_, and badly wants his wife to agree to a threesome with another woman. When she finally does, he is thrilled, at first. By the time she starts having sex with half the female population of Los Angeles County, including his sister, he is very unhappy about it.
-   _Shandra: The Jungle Girl_: When the guard finds Shandra and Karen curled together on the bed of the cell, naked, he says "Ladies, you shouldn't be doing that here. <Beat\> Not that I mind." He is so distracted that Shandra is able to knock him down and escape.
-   _She Hate Me_: Milked for all its worth to mixed results from the audience. Two fairly explicit scenes with Fatima having sex with women (once her and Alex, her girlfriend, previously another woman who'd made her realize she's a lesbian) are shown. Some Italian-American mob guys also discuss this, claiming disgust toward lesbian sex but are also into viewing it in porn.
-   When Rachel and Silka are frolicking naked in the surf during _Siren (2010)_, Ken's reaction is "If this is a dream, I don't want to wake up."

-   _Wedding Crashers_: Jeremy's girlfriend, Gloria, asks if he wants to watch her do it with a Brazilian girl. He proposes. Technically, he was planning on proposing before she asked—he said he had something to ask her, and she asked if he wanted to watch her do it with another girl. Of course, he doesn't exactly reject that idea.
-   In _We're the Millers_ when Edie asks if she can touch Rose's boobs, David says he has no problem and Don quickly puts on his glasses.

    Literature 

-   In _Almost Night_, Ed is rather happy to enjoy watching Stella and her girlfriend.
-   Patrick Bateman from _American Psycho_ is a virulent homophobe when it comes to gay men, but he's obsessed with lesbians. He once wonders whether he could force his fiancée to have sex with a woman.
-   In _Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts_, Tsuchiya ('Voyeur') whips out his camera and Akihisa helps him with the lighting (though he's also saying that homosexuality is wrong) when it looks like Shouko is about to kiss Himeji. She doesn't.
-   In the _Bloodline_ series, Mina's seduction of John includes her, in one scene, kissing and undressing a female victim while he watches mesmerized.
-   In _The Dresden Files_ book _Blood Rites_ it is revealed this trope exists purely because the centuries, if not millennia old, King Raith of the White Court, an incubus, prefers this over guys with guys. And since he controls the porn industry, he's made sure we all agree.
-   _Is This A Zombie?_:
    -   Ayumu spies on Seraphim kissing Haruna and nearly masturbates before they catch him and beat him up for being a pervert.
    -   While caring for a feverish Eu, Haruna cuddles with her to share body heat. Ayumu says that is hot.
-   Jacqueline Wilson has the boys in her novel _Love Frankie_ react with excitement when they hear Frankie and Sally kissed on New Year's. One boy even asks Frankie out, saying he doesn't mind if she's lesbian, but asking if she can describe all the juicy details between her and Sally. Frankie understandably turns him down.
-   In the _Magic Ex Libris_ series, the Hero expresses this sentiment after his crush makes a rather thinly-veiled comment about her gender preferences. He's on a Truth Serum at the time.
-   In a book of _One-Star Reviews: The Very Best Reviews of the Very Worst Products_, which offers commentary on hilariously poorly written reviews, one review complains that "the two mommies episode of _Good Luck Charlie_" destroyed the reviewer's son's "Disney dreams and fantasies." The author's response?
    
    "Wait until he turns thirteen. I assure you that every single one of those Disney fantasies involving two mommies will come roaring back."
    
-   In the 1881 Victorian gay male porn novel _The Sins of the Cities of the Plain_ by "Jack Saul," "tribadism" (now usually used to refer to a specific lesbian sex act, but then often used to refer to lesbianism in general) is described as "a vice which every man in his heart looks on with kindly eyes."
-   In _My Almost Epic Summer_, Drew dares the two lead females to make out in a closet.
-   In _Pretty Little Liars_ all the Typical Rosewood Boys are suddenly talking to Emily when she is outed by "A."
-   In the Discworld novel _Thud!_, Angua and Sally are covered in mud, and gearing up to fight (it's slightly less contrived than it sounds – they're a werewolf and a vampire, and were both shapeshifting without the benefit of Magic Pants) and Sally suggests that if they're going to continue, they should at least do so in front of a paying audience.
-   _Girls Don't Hit_: Joss and Echo easily seduce a target by dancing together then promising that he can have a threesome with them.
-   _The Change Room_: Eliza and Shar make out in a bar, with the male bartender watching them despite feeling ashamed because it turns him on so much.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Ally McBeal_:
    -   Used in an episode. Ling Woo asks Ally out on a date and later they dance together to entice the men who are flirting with them.
    -   Even more hilariously, Richard Fish's "reasoning" on why lesbians are ok, but gay guys aren't.
        
        "The survival of the human race is dependent on the male becoming aroused. 2 women together does that to the male, whereas 2 men together causes the male to go limp for a week, thus the species is threatened"
        
-   _Black Mirror_: A much darker variation occurs in the first episode "The National Anthem". To save Princess Sussannah, Prime Minister Callows must have sex with a pig. His Cabinet then brings "visual aids", pictures of two women having sex, in order for him to maintain an erection so he can finish the indecent act.
-   _Bliss_: All three seasons had at least one episode featuring a girl on girl pairing.
-   _Bottom_: Eddie's video collection includes "Swedish Lesbians in Blackcurrant Jam!" Richie's thrilled until he reads the box and sees 'Swedish _Legends_ in Blackcurrant Jam Making'.
-   A "Freaky Friday" Flip episode in _Boy Meets Girl_, where Martin Freeman's character is trapped in a female body and gets a pleasant surprise when 'her' lesbian friend comes on to him: "And I'm a girl!!"
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   In "Restless," Xander has a dream involving watching Willow and Tara. Justified, in that they really are lesbians, and would have needed only a taste for exhibitionism and wearing way too much makeup for the scene to work. In the same episode, Willow has a dream where Xander and Oz, too pointedly, note how the show uses the phrase "doing spells" for what Willow and Tara do together. After Willow wanders off, the dream remains with the boys long enough for Xander to say, "Sometimes I think about two girls doing a spell together... and then I go do a spell by myself."
    -   In "Buffy vs. Dracula," Willow tells Xander she's keeping a secret and he tells her that everyone knows about her and Tara by now, before adding that if she _does_ want to tell him a secret about her and Tara, he'd be happy to listen.
    -   Subverted in "Storyteller" when Ambiguously Gay Andrew brings a video camera into Buffy's living room to find Willow and Kennedy kissing on the couch. He comments that this is hot – and turns his camera to the window repair work recently done by Xander to which he was referring.
    -   Parodied with Xander again in "Dirty Girls" where he has a dream of all the teenage Potentials having a pillow fight in sexy lingerie... and is then woken up by a couple of them, wearing modest sleepwear and no make-up, complaining that the toilet's blocked again.
    -   Averted by Oz when he finds out about Willow and Tara in "New Moon Rising." Instead of thinking it's hot, his anger and jealousy causes him to transform into his werewolf form and attack Tara. This has more to do with Willow dating someone at all than it has with her dating a _girl_, because through lying by omission she had given him the impression they could get back together. After being stopped, Oz is ultimately accepting of Willow and Tara's relationship, and notably respectful enough _not_ to reduce it to this trope. His reaction when he figures it out, in a near aversion, isn't even "Are you sleeping with her"; it's "Is she in love with you?"
    -   A more important aversion was choosing to do the show's first on-screen kiss between Tara and Willow in "The Body." The kiss was played as a completely normal and definitely unimportant moment of an episode focusing on Buffy and the Scoobies dealing with the immediate aftermath of the death of a loved one. The studio execs didn't advertise it as is usually the case in other series (and, indeed, reportedly tried to cut it until Joss Whedon put his foot down, leading some writers on the show to comment that networks prefer sensationalised one-off kisses to a committed long-term relationship).
    -   Relatively early in the series, it was decided that either Willow or Xander would end up in a same-sex relationship at some point. It wasn't until years later that Willow was chosen, probably because of this trope.
    -   The Cat Fight version can be seen in "This Year's Girl," where a male college student can be heard excitedly shouting for others to check out Buffy and Willow slugging it out with Faith.
-   Averted in the _Cold Case_ episode "Torn," when the detectives reopen a 1919 case of a murdered woman involved in the suffrage movement. They find what appears to be a love letter from the woman to her maid. When they bring in the maid's by-that-time elderly daughter, she just laughs and says "You men love to think that, don't you?"
-   _Community_:
    -   Annie and Britta are two hotties of the group. In "Investigative Journalism," Buddy is a guy who wants to join their study group. He reminisces about stuff that happened to them and what he was doing. One of his memories is Britta and Annie fighting in cheerleading outfits. Shortly after, they fall into a pool full of bubbles. Buddy does admit that he sleeps in class a lot, and that that memory may actually have been a dream.
    -   In "The Psychology of Letting Go" Annie and Britta's oil-wrestling match draws a very large crowd. The men of the study group also approve when they reconcile and start hugging.
-   There's the male cast of _Coupling_, Steve in particular. Not only did an entire episode revolve around his "Lesbian Spank Inferno" video, there was a sequence in which after he was unable to give a sample at a clinic because the material provided had men in the pictures alongside women (invoking dangers of eye slippage at a crucial moment leading to a case of lower whiplash according to Jeff) so he sent Jeff to fetch some from his private collection which contained only women, 'preferably with some female friends...'
    -   Also very amusingly played up in the fourth season, in which Susan tests the theory that, after several years together, she can still turn him on "with a single kiss." This theory is confirmed indirectly when she passionately snogs the supposedly-bisexual Jane and turns on every man in the room, including Steve, and Jane.
-   _The Crowded Room_: Inverted twice by men interested in Ariana seeing her with women. First, she's with Danny and then starts to kiss Annabelle, a girl he was somewhat into. Annabelle and Ariana later have sex offscreen. Danny appears subdued while it starts and claims he's fine with this later, but definitely not turned on. Later, she kisses a woman in front of Jerome, who's furious about it, hitting them. This was right after she went into the bathroom and had sex with him there. Ariana is really an alternate personality of Danny's though, so it's him (physically anyway) with them, and possibly acting on a fantasy of his.
-   On _The Daily Show_, they got a bunch of Staten Island guidos to sit on as a mock Supreme Court to render a decision on Proposition 8, which would forbid same-sex marriages. The chief justice of the exercise starts the ruling with, "If two guys wanna get married, that's cool. If two chicks want to get it on, that's _great_," before ruling 5–4 against the proposition.
-   _Dates_: The guys who buy drinks for Kate and Erica in the club then invite them to dance seem aware they're on a date together, but don't mind, particularly when they start dancing pretty seductively then kissing. Callum is also similarly very eager to hang out with Kate and Erica, as she lampshades.
-   In the _Doctor Who_ 2011 Comic Relief special, Amy hits on herself. The Doctor is annoyed, Rory is nearly catatonic.
-   _Dollhouse_:
    -   Echo is sent to bodyguard a beautiful female singer, and Dr Saunders goes to complain to Topher about it, saying she's only supposed to have romantic assignments. Topher quips that as Echo's last romantic assignment turned out to be dangerous, maybe this high-risk assignment will turn out to be romantic. Topher quite enjoys this idea.
    -   In Season 2 Claire Saunders is conducting a pelvic examination on Echo, who has a flashback memory of kissing Whiskey for the enjoyment of a male client at a masked ball.
-   _Eldorado Ka De We_: The boorish nazi character Rüdiger Hartmann is seen hypocritically masturbating to a lesbian erotica magazine produced by a lesbian-feminist group that he had previously been persecuting.
-   In an early episode of _The Facts of Life_, two friends become rivals when they join the track team and get into a fight. Blair tries to break it up and gets hit. When another girl describes everything to her boyfriend, she's shocked when he declares, "It sounds sexy."
-   In the _Farscape_ episode "John Quixote," the apparently-male evil controlling force of a VR game in which John and Chiana are trapped gets very creepily excited about the idea that Chiana might have to kiss a princess to "win."
-   _Firefly_:
    -   In "War Stories," it is revealed that Inara takes female clients as well as male when the councilor she invites aboard ship turns out to be a woman. Jayne, who witnesses this reveal and is the most lecherous of the crew, has only five words for this: "I'll Be in My Bunk." Kaylee also seems to have liked it.
    -   In "Our Mrs. Reynolds," Saffron knocks Mal out by kissing him while wearing poisonous lipstick. After she realizes he's not actually dead, Inara is so relieved she kisses him, and gets knocked out by the residue. When they've recovered, Mal assumes Inara got knocked out by kissing Saffron, and his mind naturally goes through the gutter. She's too embarrassed to correct him.
-   _Friends_ used this trope quite often:
    -   In "The One with George Stephanopoulos," when the guys want to go to a hockey game while Ross is bummed over his divorce:
        
        **Ross:** You know what, I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.  
        **Joey:** The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
        
    -   In "The One with the Evil Orthodontist," Rachel's ex-fiancé is marrying Rachel's best friend, and now the best friend wants to talk (and Rachel just had sex with the ex-fiancé). She and the best friend practiced kissing with each other at camp and Joey asks "Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and... were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or?" and Rachel slams the door in his face.
    -   In "The One with the Flashback," when Janice asks if anyone of the group ever slept together:
        
        **Joey:** Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.  
        **Monica and Rachel:** What?!!  
        **Rachel:** Excuse me, there was no time!  
        **Joey:** Okay, but let’s say there was. How might that go?
        
        -   During the flashback.
            
            **Monica:** Hey, are you okay?  
            **Ross:** My wife's a lesbian.  
            **Joey:** Cool!
            
    -   In "The One with the Chick and the Duck," Monica slams into Rachel when she practices roller skating, knocks her down and falls on top of her. When Joey sees them, with Rachel moaning (in pain), he says: "Oh, my!"
    -   In "The One with the Girl from Poughkeepsie," when Rachel is sad about her single status, Chandler hugs and comforts her... then he asks: "Have you ever been with a woman?" She gets upset and he notes that there's no good time to ask that question.
    -   In "The One with Joey's Dirty Day," Chandler goes to a strip club with the girls to get out of his post-breakup depression, but doesn't enjoy himself... until they get home, and the girls start to contemplate which stripper they'd sleep with if they were into women.
    -   In "The One With All The Haste," Monica and Rachel offer to kiss each other in front of Joey and Chandler for one minute to win their apartment back. It works.
        
        **Joey:** That was one good minute!
        
        **Joey:** Night.
        
    -   In "The One Hundredth," when Phoebe is giving birth and the gang goes to the hospital with her:
        
        **Rachel:** Monica? You're gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
        
        **Joey:** Oh my!
        
        **Rachel:** They're male nurses.
        
        **Joey:** Not in my head.
        
    -   In "The One with Joey's Big Break," Rachel is afraid to take her eye drops, and Monica tries to force her, and ends up straddling her and pinning her arms down. Rachel says: "You know, if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!"
    -   In "The One with Rachel's Sister," Ross mentions that he wishes he had a brother that Rachel could go out with after she accidentally gives her blessing for him to date her sister. This happens:
        
        **Ross:** _(to Rachel)_ If you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.  
        **Joey:** And mine!
        
    -   In the "What If?" episode, "The One that Could Have Been," Ross is still married to Carol. She suggests a threesome in order to spice up their sex life. Ross later confesses to Joey that he was mostly a passive participant, and he even made a sandwich while watching.
        -   At the beginning of the episode:
            
            **Ross:** Seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.  
            **Joey:** I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
            
    -   In "The One With The Birthing Video," Chandler mistakes a birthing video of a friend of Phoebe's for a girl-on-girl porn that Monica got him on Valentine's Day.
    -   In "The One With Rachel's Other Sister," when Rachel got into a Catfight with her sister, Amy:
        
        **Phoebe:** Oh my God! Shouldn't we stop this?  
        **Joey:** What? Are you out of your mind? Let's throw some Jell-O on them!
        
    -   In "The One With The Birth Mother," Phoebe and Rachel discuss helping each other try on bras, and Phoebe says "Wait a minute. Are we in Joey's imagination?"
    -   Joey's sudden interest in Rachel and her friend Melissa kissing on the lips in "The One With Rachel's Big Kiss."
    -   In "The One With The Nap Partners," Ross and Joey judge a contest between Phoebe and Rachel to decide who will be Monica's maid of honor. Phoebe wins one of the rounds simply by saying "I remember talking about this day with Rachel, when we were showering together _naked_."
    -   When Chandler starts working as an intern in advertisement, the interns' first assignment is to come up with an idea for a TV commercial to sell sneakers on wheels. One of the interns presents a spot with lots of sexy women who are in a hot tub and they kiss each other and come out of the hot tub... except he forgets to mention the product.
    -   When Joey sets his mind to screwing Ross's babysitter, Chandler and Ross try to stop him. When they all see her kiss her girlfriend, they have nothing but satisfied grins.
-   _Game of Thrones_ plays with the trope occasionally:
    -   Subverted in one episode, when Tyrion hires two prostitutes to entertain Joffrey, hoping that if he can get the evil little shit laid, he'll stop torturing his poor betrothed Sansa. At first, Joffrey orders them to play with each other, but finds it boring. So instead, he commands one of them to beat the other, severely. He really _is_ an evil little shit.
    -   An earlier episode plays with the trope in a different way, as Littlefinger watches and instructs two of his whores on how to make use of this trope with their clients, while simultaneously delivering what has popularly become known as Sexposition.
    -   Myranda and Violet use this to sexually abuse Theon as a lead up to a horrific Groin Attack.
-   _Ginny and Georgia_: Two straight girls at a party make out to the delight of the guys watching.
-   In _Glee_, Santana and Brittany's plan for seducing Finn is to have him buy them dinner and then allow him to watch the two of them making out, and prior to that episode Brittany implied that she and Santana were in a sexual relationship. In Season 2, they were shown kissing and made explicit verbal references to more sexual contact, but Santana explains that this does not make her gay, she just needs something warm under her to properly digest her food. _Glee_ ended up deconstructing Girl On Girl Is Hot by having Santana realize that she was legitimately in love with Brittany and confused and scared by these feelings.
-   When Blair and Serena make up after having been in a big fight in _Gossip Girl_s third season the following exchange follows:
    
    **Chuck:** If you two want to kiss... it won't count as cheating.  
    **Serena:** Creepy, Chuck.
    
-   _The Handmaid's Tale_: Some of the brothel's customers clearly feel this way, as we see one having sex with a woman who's kissing another at the same time while others watch. Both Luke and Commander Waterford bring up the possibility of June and Moira having sex.
-   _Herman's Head_. Herman and his Handsome Lech friend Jay go to a single parent group to pick up women. They start talking about their cover story.
    
    **Jay:** Our wives ran off with other men.  
    **Herman:** No, our wives ran off with each other!  
    **Jay:** Ohhh yes...  
    **Herman:** We were stunned as they spent hours exploring the delights of Thai massage...  
    **Jay:** But why would we have divorced them? They could do it all they liked, as long as we were allowed to watch!
    
-   In Season 5 of _House_, the bisexual Thirteen gets herself invited to the bachelor party House is planning for Chase: "If I get drunk enough, I might make out with a stripper." At the party, she does a body shot off one of the strippers (Karamel, with a K), prompting Wilson to ask her boyfriend:
    
    **Wilson:** Are you okay with this?  
    **Foreman:** Okay with it? I paid fifty bucks for it.
    
    -   Foreman and Thirteen were also shown lying in bed together, with Thirteen telling him stories of her escapades with women.
    -   House himself is prone to this, or at least is prone to making snarky comments about watching _The L Word_ with the sound off. He also explicitly notes, when two women (twin sisters, no less) start to have an argument, that they're distracting to every straight man and gay woman in the room.
    -   There was another episode where House thought either Foreman, Chase or Cameron was having sex with a female pharmaceutical rep, then he turned towards Cameron and said, "Please say it's you." (It was actually Foreman.)
    -   There was also an episode which featured Thirteen making out with a woman during a one night stand. When she turns out to be the patient of the week, House winds up asking her questions about the sex they had, under the flimsy excuse of medical relevance. Of course this being House, he was probably also doing it to annoy/embarass Thirteen.
-   On _How I Met Your Mother_, Barney is quite fond of this trope:
    -   When Ted's ex-girlfriend is seen kissing a girl, Barney quickly takes a pictures of them.
    -   When Lily and Robin almost got into a Cat Fight, Barney was about to take out his cellphone and record the fight, only to be angered when Ted breaks up the fight. He's so incensed that he punches a hole in the wall of Ted's apartment.
    -   Barney also records Lily beating up Jenkins, an attractive female employee at GNB, for kissing Marshall.
    -   Barney even added a rule on the Bro Code that "a Bro will inform another Bro when there's a Cat Fight."
    -   When he finds out Robin was in a Canadian kids show with her BFF Jessica Glitter:
        
        **Barney:** Ah, BFFs. Did you guys have sleepovers, get mad at each other and wrestle, but end up _kissing_ in a tender embrace? Here, show us on Lily.
        
    -   He also forced Lily and Robin to kiss as punishment for Ted breaking a "broath."
    -   Averted when Robin tries to seduce Barney by grinding with a female co-worker of hers, but Barney nonchalantely ignores it and instead takes Robin's co-worker on a date.
    -   In a season 9 episode, Robin and Lily wake up a drunk Barney simply by kissing each other.
-   Subverted hilariously in an episode of _Jerry Springer_. A man convinces his girlfriend to have a 3-way with another girl. The girlfriend finds one and takes the camera crew to her apartment to meet her. But to the guy's horror (he's watching from the stage), the third party is a total Butch Lesbian. When the ladies come onstage, the girlfriend dumps him for her and adds that the lesbian was better in bed that one time than he ever was. But more generally, _Jerry Springer_ audiences will cheer lesbians and boo gay men.
-   Deliberately invoked in the first season of _The Joe Schmo Show_ when a fake network executive tried to get the show's "schmo," Matt, to get two of the female contestants, Ashleigh and Molly, to either go topless or kiss and if he could, then everyone would get a big-screen televisoin prize. What Matt didn't know was that the reality show he was on was fake, though despite being Genre Blind, even he smelled something fishy about this.
-   _Justified_: In "The I of the Storm," Dewey Crowe celebrates a score by hiring two hookers and having them make out with each other as a prelude for the main event. He calls it the hottest thing he's ever seen.
-   _Just Shoot Me!_:
    -   The entire premise of "Two Girls for Every Boy." Finch learns that an attractive female model has a crush on Maya, and does everything in his power to get them to hook up. Not only that, but random men all over town are willing to help him with whatever he needs once he tells them what he's trying to accomplish. When both of them learn this, they make it seem like Maya (who's straight) is into the idea and they'll let him watch while they have sex in revenge to toy with Finch. They then fake a break up to dash his hopes.
    -   In the ending of another episode, Maya confronts a colleague about using flirtatious behavior to get her way around the office. The other woman then uses these same tricks on Maya, who starts getting into it. The other woman then walks away, having won the argument. After they're both gone, Dennis emerges from behind a desk, having listened to the interplay.
        
        **Dennis:** _\[talking to God\]_ You do love me, don't you?
        
    -   In "It's Raining Babies" Finch tries to trick Nina and Vicki into kissing, to their annoyance (the two prank him in revenge).
-   Referenced in _Kyle XY_:
    
    **Jessi:** I can do anything Kyle can do.  
    **Josh:** Can you make out with Amanda? Cause that would be hot.
    
-   _Leverage_: In "The First David Job," Parker and Hardison stage a Fake-Out Make-Out while Sophie hides. Nate and Eliot hear the sounds of the make-out session over their earpieces. When Sophie returns, Eliot eagerly asks her which one of them Parker was making out with.
-   _Lucifer_.
    -   In "Expire Erect," Eve kisses Ella to shut her up from her cocaine-fueled rant. Lucifer (who is dying of gunshot wound nearby) sees them and makes an appropriate quip.
        
        **Lucifer:** Ladies... Oh, it's a comfort to know I'll expire erect. _\[raises glass\]_ Cheers.
        
    -   In "Save Lucifer," Maze and Eve have an accountant Bound and Gagged in his own office, and they start making out in front of him because Eve is hoping to make Lucifer jealous. Sure enough Lucifer turns up in the middle of events.
-   _The L Word_: Exploited. Due to featuring _a lot_ of sex scenes between women, the show has a _very_ large male fanbase whose primary motivation for watching it is... yeah. The show got often accused of Pandering to the Base because of said Misaimed Fandom. Writers eventually performed a Take That, Audience! with Mark's attitude towards Shane and Jenny to a mitigated reaction from the audience. Multiple times later straight men would also comment on two women together with approval, which they found creepy at best.
-   Invoked in a very creepy way on _Mad Men_. Roger and Don are at the office with a pair of young models. Roger asks one to kiss the other. They're sisters. And sisters should be friendly.
-   Parodied in a _MADtv (1995)_ spoof of _Brokeback Mountain_ which inverted the genders by making it a secret relationship between two cowgirls. Rather than facing hostility and ostracism, the women's husbands encourage the affair and even get their buddies together to watch.
-   _The Man Show_ loved this trope, and had a couple of skits showing as much.
    -   Camcorders for Lesbians, a fake charity dedicated to sending donated camcorders to lesbian couples so they can record themselves.
    -   Jimmy once went out on the street to find women who would make out on camera for twenty dollars. He found several.
-   This is the basis of a couple of sketches on _Man Stroke Woman_. In each, a guy does something to which the two women in the sketch respond "How can we thank you?" and the guy suggests that they make out.
-   Averted in _Midsomer Murders_, at least in the episodes with Troy, a homophobe. Of course, since the women involved are rarely of the Lipstick Lesbian type...
-   _Modern Family_: At one point, Haley gets a job promoting clubs on social media. She and her fellow promoters mention pretending kiss each other in order to attract male club-goers.
-   From _Mr. Sunshine (2011)_, Ben's assistant sets him up with her sister. No one on this show is balanced, so it doesn't end well. The sisters start fighting.
    
    **Ben:** I'm gonna go.  
    **Heather:** I should slap you.  
    **Stephanie:** I should slap _you_.  
    **Ben:** I'm gonna stay.
    
-   _Mystery Science Theater 3000_:
    -   The robots' fondness for female wrestling and/or lesbian scenes was a running joke in the series.
    -   The B-movie _Racket Girls_, about female wrestling, is built on this trope, and riffed mercilessly by the guys.
    -   The characters theorize that the Catfight scene in _Manos: The Hands of Fate_ is the only reason the film is allowed to exist.
    -   Mike and the Bots get excited when two women get into bed together in _The Thing That Couldn't Die_.
-   _NCIS_:
    -   In an episode, two women who were both engaged to the same (dead) man get into a fight. Gibbs goes to break it up. Tony calls out about it. _McGee_ videos it on his cell phone. **Abby** watches the fight later and enjoys it.
    -   Tony's a large one himself — Ziva's "I'm bisexual" insinuations are probably for his benefit/confusion. Definitely, as shown by his suggestion that Ziva and Abby make up for their slapfest with "a deep tongue kiss." Instead, both women simultaneously punch Tony in the chest.
    -   Kate Todd brings up the Fridge Logic of this trope, and I quote (or paraphrase): "Why are men interested in women that, by definition, are not interested in them"? This trope is played straight when Tony does not seem to care about that. Which makes sense, given what starts this conversation is discussing a case where a man's wife was having an affair with a woman and Tony stating he wouldn't mind if _his_ (hypothetical) _wife_ did it.
-   In the episode of _The Office_ where Michael accidentally outs Oscar, Michael and Dwight become interesting in learning whether any other staff members are homosexual. Michael proposes that Angela might be a lesbian, which Dwight (who is secretly having an affair with Angela) disputes. Michael comments, "Imagine Angela with another woman," which Dwight does, with a smirk.
-   _On My Block_: When Monse mentions that she and Olivia have "girl stuff" to do after school, Cesar jokingly asks if he can watch. Later, when kids are playing "Marry, Make Love, Kill" and Olivia says she'd make love to Monse, Ruby is unabashedly aroused.
-   _Orange Is the New Black_: In season 1 Pornstache looks quite excited when he sees Alex and Piper dancing provocatively together.
-   _The Outer Limits (1995)_: Girl On Girl Is Hot:
    -   In "Caught In the Act," a sleazy detective taunts the male protagonist and says his girlfriend is a slut (she's been infected with an alien parasite which sucks out people's lifeforce through sex). He angrily retorts that she would never cheat on him. The detective goes, "Oh yeah? According to her roommate, she goes both ways!" The boyfriend says eagerly, "Really?"
    -   In "Ripper," Dr. Jack York, who is high on absinthe and opium, is transfixed by the sight of Polly Nichols and Annie Chapman making out until an Energy Being leaves the former's body, killing her in the process, and takes possession of the latter.
-   Subverted in _Peep Show_: Jez finds out the girl he's dating, Elena, is bisexual and in a lesbian relationship. At first, he thinks it hot. But then he starts to grow jealous, especially since she seems more committed to her relationship with the other woman than theirs. Elena even agrees to her marriage proposal. He gets so jealous that at one point, he worries that he might have subconsciously tried to murder the other woman.

-   In _Red Dwarf_, episode "Parallel Universe," the guys travel into a parallel universe where women are the dominant gender. Apparently, they also find man-on-man videos arousing.
-   Betty and Veronica try to invoke this in the _Riverdale_ pilot in order to get on the cheerleading squad. Cheryl scoffs, says lesbian kissing isn't a big deal anymore, and tells them they need to do something more impressive to get on the team.
-   _Saturday Night Live_:
-   _Scrubs_:
    -   In one episode where Elliot and Carla are having a spat, every time they start to argue Dr. Kelso sticks his head around the corner and meow, eventually complaining to Ted that "Dammit Ted, I wanted a Catfight!"
    -   Todd in almost every appearance. In one instance:
        
        **Elliot:** No, Todd, I won't date you. And I don't want you to think that it's because I just broke up with someone or that I want to preserve our friendship or that I'm a lesbian. It's because I find you so creepy that I think you should have to have a bell around your neck.
        
        **Todd:** All I heard was "lesbian."
        
    -   Also subverted in one episode in which JD has the same fantasy every time he sees two women he's slept with talking - Rerun from _What's Happening!_ teaching them both to dance. Apparently, this is also his ideal bachelor party.
    -   In another episode J.D. imagines what it's like in Turk's head, which involves Carla and sexy female psychiatrist Molly Clock making out. When Molly points out that Carla isn't a lesbian, Carla just sighs and says: "I am in here." Molly takes a moment to contemplate this, comes to a realization, and says "Me, too."
    -   Molly once mentioned having had a threesome, to which JD responded with the question "Was it two girls and a guy, or was it a Devil's Threesome?" When she answers "All girl," the men have a predictable reaction.
    -   In the Season 8 finale, Carla and Elliot decide to imitate Turk and JD and embrace, much to their astonishment. The two guys then coach the girls to try to get them even more intimate ("I usually cup the buttocks"). They finally draw the line at "Our crotches are usually closer together."
    -   Molly was advising Elliot about what to say to an upcoming presentation and says "If it doesn't work, we'll just make out." Cue Todd bursting into the room, having clearly just come running out on a surgery, to watch.
    -   In the second episode of the series, _My Best Friend's Mistake_, JD fantasizes about a progressive future with Elliot, one that involved a three-way.
    -   One episode saw Elliot give a pelvic exam to a plain looking woman, accidentally giving her an orgasm. JD recalls the incident differently, namely that the patient looks like a buxom supermodel that _wanted_ an intimate moment with Dr. Reid.
    -   In "My Way Home," JD and Turk discuss their plans to meet up "by the milkshake stand on the lesbian cloud" in the afterlife.
-   Hilarious subversion in _Skins_, where JJ completely fails to realize that he's just lived through every man's fantasy. (The two girls are – for certain values of the word, at the time – a couple.)
    
    **JJ:** Bit cramped in there. Me, two girls and one tent. Nightmare. You girls like to wriggle, don't you? Anyway, I need a wee and a Tic Tac.
    
    -   And played straight earlier; he also got to watch when the same two girls got high on spiked chocolate brownies at a pyjama party and made out a lot (this was before they became anything resembling a couple).
        
        **JJ:** Oh my giddy, giddy, giddy... aunt.
        
-   Possibly a reason that Irene Adler was revealed to be a lesbian in _Sherlock_. Throughout the episode "A Scandal in Belgravia," the only person she is shown to be sexually interested in (outside of her work, of course) is the eponymous detective. Played for laughs when Mycroft explains, while John drinks tea, that Adler has compromising photos of herself with a young, royal, female person:
    
    **Sherlock:** And I assume in a number of compromising scenarios.  
    **Mycroft:** An imaginative range, we are assured.  
    _\[pause\]_  
    **Sherlock:** John, you might want to put that cup back in its saucer now.
    
-   Subverted in _Sherman Oaks_. When Billy finds out that his hot girlfriend wants to have sex with his hot maid, he immediately kicks her out of the house.
-   Discussed in _Smack the Pony_, in a sketch involving two (attractive but apparently rather sheltered and naive) lesbians recording a dating video shyly asking if any men might be interested in watching them have sex or in joining in with them having sex... only to sadly turn to each other and conclude that they don't think anyone's going to be interested.
-   Played for laughs in a daydream sequence in _Stargate SG-1_ in the episode "Avenger 2.0." Carter and another female scientist get into a Catfight over the daydreaming character but, as he moves to break them apart, O'Neill stops him so that he can keep watching the fight.
-   The _Star Trek: Voyager_ episode, "Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy," involves The Doctor daydreaming that Seven of Nine, B'elanna Torres, and Kathryn Janeaway are all catfighting over him.
-   _Sugar Rush_:
    -   The title character uses this to get attention from men. Clubbing with Kim, a lesbian with a crush on her, she is asked by a man if they're lesbians. She replies that they are and kisses Kim, who then goes to get drinks for them, thinking they are now a couple. However, when she returns, Sugar is with the man.
    -   In an earlier episode, Sugar enters a relationship with a Frenchman who cannot speak English. Likewise, she can't speak French and uses Kim as a translator. When he is leaves on a bus, Sugar asks Kim what the last thing he said was. Kim lies and says that he always wanted to see two girls kiss; Sugar obliges.
-   In the _That '70s Show_ episode "The Kids Are Alright," Donna and Hyde's Girl of the Week, Raquel are sitting next to each other and talking:
    
    **Raquel:** I mean, just because I don't wear dresses... And, I know how to fix a car, doesn't mean I don't like to be told I'm pretty.  
    **Donna:** Wow, it's like I'm reading my own journal. I think you're pretty. I think you're really pretty.  
    **Raquel:** I think you're pretty. _\[touches Donna's shoulder\]_  
    **Donna:** _\[giggles\]_ Stop!  
    **Eric:** _\[to Hyde\]_ Is this really happening?  
    **Hyde:** Shh! You'll break the spell!
    
-   _Supernatural_: Dean notices that the two very attractive females in the back seat of the Impala are an angel and a demon, respectively, and remarks that it feels like the beginning of a Penthouse forum letter. Later, the angel in question visits Dean in a dream where he is at a strip club and watching a stripper dressed as an angel and a stripper dressed as a demon dance.
-   And then there's the reaction of _Torchwood_'s Owen Harper to seeing two women kissing in "Day One" - "Happy birthday me!" It also caught the attention of the very female (and bisexual) Tosh.
-   _Will & Grace_: Subverted in one episode when Will and Jack find Grace and Karen passed out on top of each other after a night of drinking. Since Will and Jack are both gay the sight does absolutely nothing for them.
-   _You Me Her_: Izzy gets harassed while in a bar by a man whom Emma stops. Once he hears they're married, it turns him on.

    Music 

-   Ken Ashcorp makes his love for Yuri abundantly clear, it being a major trend throughout his music, and _especially_ the cover artwork<small>◊</small>.
-   In "Queer for Cat" by Big Rude Jake the singer is delighted when he arrives home at 3 a.m. to discover his girlfriend making out with the girl of his dreams.
-   On the "Words of Wisdom" track from blink-182's _The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show_ live album—the track is mostly a collection of between-song jokes from different concerts — is the following (typically crude) exchange:
    
    **Tom:** Hey, how many of you guys have girlfriends and how many of you girlfriends have guy friends?  
    _\* the crowd cheers\*_  
    **Mark:** And more importantly, how many of you girlfriends have girlfriends?  
    _\* the crowd cheers **louder**\*_  
    **Tom:** Because we believe in the love that exists between two vaginas!  
    **Mark:** The most special kind of love of all is the love that exists between two naked women while I watch!
    
-   In "Both Ways" by Liam Payne, the male singer loves that his bisexual girlfriend regularly makes out with other women for his viewing pleasure.
-   The first verse in CupcakKe's "Crayons" critiques that lesbians are often over-sexualized while gay men are gagged at.
    
    Girl-on-girl, they're like "yup"
    
    But when it's man-on-man, they're like "yuck"
    
    Motherfuckers need to be gone with that shit
    
    Bitch, we ain't playing along; ain't no skits
    
-   In "I Didn't Just Kiss Her" by Jen Foster, the woman the protagonist is singing about insists that she's straight and only kissed her for male attention. She, however, seems too experienced in kissing and having sex with women to not have done them before.
-   Gleefully exploited on the Kevin Bishop Show by Karen Gillan spoofing Katy Perry's "I Kissed A Girl":
    
    "This is exactly as I planned, to give minor erections.  
    I got a hit by flaunting this — full lesbianism.  
    It is not what I usually do, I just wanted Number One.  
    I'll be bi-curious for you, pretend girlie titillation.  
    I kissed a girl just to have a hit, and you lot all bloody fell for it.  
    I sing about girls and you'll buy it, cause it looks like I'm well up for it.  
    It's not that new, it's just that you like to think about it.  
    So I'll kiss a girl, just to sell this and you bloody fools will buy it!"
    
-   The "I'm a Lesbian Too! skit" from lesbian rapper God-Des's album _Reality_ features a drunken, male Straw Fan talking about how great lesbians are.
-   Two-thirds of "Surf City" by Jan and Dean are about two bisexual girl and one guy threesomes.
-   "Girl Crush" by Little Big Town:
    
    "I wanna taste her lips, yeah, 'cause they taste like you  
    I wanna drown myself in her perfume  
    I want her long blonde hair, I want her magic touch  
    Yeah 'cause maybe then you'd want me just as much  
    I got a girl crush, I got a girl crush"
    
-   The MC Frontalot song, "I Heart Fags" requests that everyone be as tolerant toward homosexual relationships as Frontalot himself is. After all, the song points out, "you already think dykes are hot."
-   Katy Perry's "I Kissed A Girl," of course, is all about this. (As opposed to the earlier — thirteen years, to be exact — identically-titled Jill Sobule song, in which the kiss is a result of a relationship between the kissers.)
-   Pittsburgh Slim's "Girls Kiss Girls" is all about this. During the song, Slim convinces his long-distance girlfriend to do an _American Pie_\-style striptease before a friend of hers shows up, who gladly gets in on the act, striping down as well before the two girls kiss in just their underwear.
-   Deconstructed in the music video of The Pretty Reckless's _Fucked Up World_, which is a Protest Song about the commercial explotation of this trope. At one point, two "naked" girls (they're actually wearing skintone bodysuits) start making out on a huge pile of money, then look at the camera and hold up signs that say "Is this what you want?"
-   The live version of Reel Big Fish's song, "She Has a Girlfriend Now" ends with, "My girlfriend left me for another girl, and it can happen to you too if you follow your hopes and dreams!
    
    **Scott Klopfenstein:** Don't quit believing!
    
-   Type O Negative has the "controversial" song "My Girlfriend's Girlfriend." Which _may_ have been controversial in 1996, but seems pretty straightforward now. Given the band's sense of humor (and the actual controversies stemming from previous releases), it's likely they didn't consider it controversial.

    Podcasts 

-   Justified in _Kakos Industries_ episode 25. After Hailey Solomonari joins Melantha's company, Corin tries to ignore it seeing how he's had sex twice with the former and hates/lusts after the latter in a complicated relationship. That is until they interrupt his broadcast like two teenagers at a sleepover just so Melantha can rub it in.
    
    **Corin:** is that all? Can I go now?  
    **Melantha:** Of course that's not all!  
    **Hailey:** Corin, I'm naked! WOOOOOOOOOO!  
    **Melantha:** That's entirely her choice! I'm not making her do anything!  
    **Hailey:** It's a new thing I've been trying! Melantha is super supportive of all of my decisions.  
    **Corin:** Please, can we not do this right now?  
    **Melantha:** There's more! I wanted to tell you that Hailey and I have now done things together. In a sexual fashion.  
    **Corin:** You mean you had sex?  
    **Melantha:** Oh yes, we did that, and we did some other things. And we did some other things still, and those things were really, really good.  
    **Hailey:** Oh my Evil, so good!  
    **Melantha:** I think we've done just about everything there is to do, really. You know, all the sexy things. Naughty things. Physical things. The kind where we touch. Erotically.  
    **Hailey:** Almost everything. We haven't done—  
    **Melantha:** Silence!
    

    Poetry 

-   A possible explanation for _The Songs of Bilitis_, a book of lesbian poetry which first appeared in the late 1800s and was claimed to have been written in Ancient Greece by one of Sappho’s lovers. In fact, the actual author was a male French poet, Pierre Louÿs.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   During the first few months of Eric Bischoff's run in the WWE, he seemed to enjoy booking a lot of "HLA" matches, much to Jerry Lawler's enjoyment. The crowd got into it too, chanting "HLA! HLA!" whenever the matches were booked. The meaning of HLA wasn't stated _too_ much on the show, but it obviously stands for Hot Lesbian Action.
-   A bit of history for the HLA thing. It started as nothing short of a ratings stunt, where the WWE promised they would have live "hot lesbian action" on TV, and even instructed color commentator Jerry Lawler to mention it _constantly_. As in, right before every commercial break. They finally brought the lesbians out. They hugged, kissed, and then came the Bait-and-Switch. Eric Bischoff said they weren't entertaining enough and had his goons Three Minute Warning come out and beat the girls up. Utterly ridiculous. Even worse, one of the girls was legitimately injured by Jamal, who was as rough with the girls as he was the usual male opponents who outweighed the girls by 150 pounds or so.
-   At one point, Bischoff tried to convince Vince McMahon not to fire him by attempting to ply him with "bisexual lesbians." "HLA" would be brought up on occasion, usually with matches or in-ring promos involving the highly attractive Divas, the stated goal being to arouse the male audience.
-   There was an angle around 2003 which, for reasons not relevant to the trope, Dawn Marie had forced Torrie Wilson to go to a hotel room with her. They kissed and we got a fade to black. What makes this a valid example of this trope is that according to Torrie, when they were filming it, most of the roster crowded around the set to watch.
-   Alexis Laree had come to Ring of Honor because it was an extra-serious promotion and she was ready to get away from this sort of thing. Unfortunately for her, ROH had a working relationship with JAPW and soon enough, Allison Danger of the exotico "Christopher Street Connection" had set her sights on Laree and was uninterested in Laree not sharing her attraction. It should be noted though, the men in the connection (Mace and Buff E) got pops for kissing other men just as Danger did Laree.
-   Invoked at _JAPW Wild Card 6_, March 20, 2010. The Osirian Portal teamed with Annie Social in a loss to Mia Yim and The South Side Playaz Club. The Portal used their hypnosis to get the SSPC's valets to kiss.
-   Exploited by Seleziya Sparx during the unauthorized _ROH A Night Of Hoopla_ during the "pants off dance off" competition, where Scarlett Bordeaux and Valerie Malone competed to impress the judge but Sparx invaded the space of a woman in the audience. It didn't work, as the as crowd overwhelmingly favored Malone, but Sparx did manage to avoid getting booed like Bordeaux...and then really averted when Davey Richards, believing he had to defend the promotion's dignity, showed all three of them up.
-   The crowd constantly chants "Kiss! Kiss!" whenever Madison Rayne and Brittany interact.

    Radio 

-   Said Howard Stern on his show: "Nothing gives me a woody like two chicks getting it on."

    Sports 

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder_ has the card "Shining Armor Approves Of This Experiment." Oddly enough, it's a goal card, and since the whole game is supposedly Twilight writing fanfics...

    Video Games 

-   Can be played straight or subverted in _Crusader Kings_.
    -   Christian Lords who marry a lesbian woman might get an event where she's discovered to be having an affair with another woman, and one of the possible options is to be okay with this.
    -   Meanwhile, Muslim Lords who marry at least two lesbian women at once might get an event where they're both sleeping with each other, and one of the possible options is to join in.
    -   On a meta level, many players actively seek out lesbian women to marry when playing as male rulers. The reason is that other men with the seduction trait can't target them, so there's no question of parentage.
-   _Dragon Age II_: Gamlen's reaction to your romance with Isabela as a female Hawke is to ask for details, which comes off as more than a little creepy considering you're his niece.
-   _Dragon Age: Origins_:
    -   Oghren most _definitely_ believes this. If questioned about how he felt about his wife Branka and her lover Hespith, he'll initially be disgruntled but eventually state he'll be in his tent. If a female Warden sleeps with a female "worker" at the Pearl brothel while he's in the party, his approval will go up more than with any other pairing. He'll also interrupt, saying he had the "wrong room." And if you invite Leliana to an all-girl threesome with Isabela, Oghren will _faint_.
    -   If the Warden is female and romantically interested in both Alistair and Leliana, the former will comment that his beloved's relationship with the latter is 'hot', even as he insists that she choose between the two of them. He also points out that 'most other guys would think he was crazy' for insisting on it. Meanwhile, if you've "hardened" (ahem) Alistair, you can invite Alistair to join you when you have a chance to bed Isabela. Whereas he doesn't like the idea of you in a long-term relationship with another woman, given the chance to participate in a one-off, he says "I am a weak, weak man." If Leliana joins instead, he will wonder aloud if he's dreaming.
    -   In _Leliana's Song_ DLC, the male party members Tug and Sketch look _very_ interested whenever Marjolaine starts hitting on Leliana.
    -   When the Templar guarding the ferry to the Circle of Magi expresses interest in her, Leliana awkwardly turns him down by claiming to be a "poetess". She ends up turning it to the party's advantage.
        
        **Carroll:** I've never met a _poetess_... The other men sometimes tell stories about them... when the Knight-Commander isn't around, of course... he doesn't abide that sort of talk.  
        **Leliana:** Pah. The stories sheltered templars tell will pale in comparison to mine. Would you like to hear my tales of debauchery and excess?  
        **Carroll:** Yes!... Please...?  
        **Leliana:** I'm sure we could talk on that long, dull boat ride across the lake, yes?
        
-   A side quest in _Fable III_ has your hero getting pulled into a tabletop game by some RPG geeks/amateur wizards who task you with rescuing a princess from an evil baron. After you defeat the baron, the princess offers you a kiss, and the geeks will be especially enthusiastic about this if your hero is female.
    
    "Two girls kissing, isn't that kind of a cliché?"  
    "An incredibly _hot_ cliché."
    
-   In _Fallout 2_, the PC can meet a family consisting of a father and his two adult children, a son and daughter. The PC, regardless of sex, can sleep with either the son or the daughter, leading to a shotgun wedding. However, if a female PC sleeps with the man's daughter, he admits to being a little turned on by catching two women in bed despite one of them being his kin.
    
    **Miria's Father:** I can't say I'm not just a little turned on by this, but I can't have her living in this house now that I've seen it.
    
-   When the Player Character in _Fallout 3_ reaches Girdershade, the only two inhabitants are Sierra, a Nuka Cola–chugging woman, and Ronald, the man who desperately wants to sleep with her. Ronald will confront you after you leave Sierra's house, and female PCs with the "Black Widow" perk can drop some hints that if Ronald helps you with Sierra's quest, he can bed the both of you. This causes Ronald to abandon all reason and charge headlong across the Wasteland to his death.
-   _Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix_: Hana and Rain use this trope to sneak into the upper floors of the Wing Chun Tower. This scene, along with the ads at the time, made the game rather infamous.
-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   _Fire Emblem Fates_ has Soleil when she's not the one hoping to be on a receiving end, contrasting her Spear Counterpart Nina.
    -   _Fire Emblem Engage_ features Louis, the game's first Armor Knight. This is reinforced by his personal skill, Admiration, which reduces the damage he takes by 2 when 2 female allies are adjacent to each other and within 2 spaces of him. This aspect of his characterization was heavily toned down in the English localization, however.
-   _Guenevere_: After being kidnapped from Camelot, Guen runs into Lancelot in the Frankish countryside. If Guen has had sex with Morgana, you have the option of dropping that bomb on him in response to his Reunion Kiss. Lance is stunned by the notion...and then his imagination begins to run away with it. One of the responses is, "Oh, gross! Don't you dare imagine Morgana and me together!"
-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   In _Mass Effect 2_, if you complete both Jack and Miranda's loyalty quests, they will have a potentially violent confrontation. When recommending you go down to do something about it, Joker's parting comment is "Take pictures!"
    -   In the _Lair of the Shadow Broker_ DLC, at the start of the reconciliation scene with Liara, she mentions seeing Joker. If you are playing a female Shepard, she goes on to say that Joker asked if the two of you would be reenacting scenes from _Vaenia_ (an in-universe vid starring some glamorous asari, implied to be porn or at least the equivalent of R-rated).
    -   Continuing the Jack/Miranda "animosity," the _Citadel_ DLC of _Mass Effect 3_ has Shepard suggesting that they're just frustrated over sexual tension and should just kiss already. Kasumi offers to record it for an eagerly-waiting market.
-   Played with in _Medieval II: Total War_. On the one hand, a Princess who picks up the "Potentially Confused" trait will receive a _bonus_ to Charm, making her more likely to convince other nations' family members to marry her and join your faction. On the other hand, if that trait develops into "Prefers Women," the Princess will have penalties to both Charm and the odds she'll bear children.
-   In _Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker_, Cécile gets kidnapped by an out-and-proud lesbian who gives her personal sponge baths every day. When she gets rescued, she teases Snake about this, mistaking his interest in her well-being for this trope. "Would you like to hear about all the _horrible_ things she did to me~?"

    Visual Novels 

-   Prince Gaston of _The Confines of the Crown_ is all too enthusiastic about getting Madeleine and his maid Colette into bed together, and makes it clear that he'd love to watch.
-   Deconstructed in _Deiz_. In one ending your character is witnessing one girl _raping_ another, and doesn't do anything because it's hot.
-   _Katawa Shoujo_:
    
    -   In Emi's route, Emi ends up giving Rin her cold. Hisao wonders whether he'll get it as well, given that he and Emi were pretty close yesterday, including having a pillow fight and her sleeping on him. Which makes him wonder...
    
    **Hisao:** So what did she and Rin do that got her ill?  
    **Hisao:** ...  
    **Hisao:** Steady on, old lad. Don't go down that road.
    
    -   In the beta version, Hisao has a few moments where he thinks that Lily and Hanako might be more than just friends. This perks his interest.
-   _Melody_: If the protagonist, Melody, and Sophia are all dating each other, the protagonist can walk in on the two girls fooling around. This trope can be played straight (if he admits to himself and to the girls that he was turned on) or defied (if he pretends he didn't see anything).

    Webcomics 

-   This is why Pip keeps trying to find out how Integra and Seras conceived D in _And Shine Heaven Now_. Because he's pretty sure it was hot.
    
    **Seras:** Don't make me put you in time out, dear.
    
-   Kevin from _Anime News Nina_ was revealed to be one.
-   _Books Don't Work Here_. When Robin is pimping out her roommate on the page called the benefit of having friends Sparky asked whether her girlfriend is a girl and a friend or a girl on girl friend.
-   _Bronze Skin Inc._: In chapter 3, Dante has to keep from getting aroused at work or he'll be fired. Unfortunately, the customers that day are two giantesses who won't stop making out with each other.
-   The One Guy in _Crossroads of Booger County_ turns out to be a Yuri Fan; since the other four main characters are a lesbian, a Transparent Closet case, a proclaimed straight woman who spent much of college in a lesbian relationship, and his murdered girlfriend, this has some ramifications.
-   Turns up in the _Death Note_ fancomics by Silent Reaper, where Takada and Misa get into a catfight.
-   This _Dinosaur Comics_. T-Rex re a lesbian wedding: "We'll get to see them KISS!"
-   _El Goonish Shive_:
    -   Played with in the non-continuity story "Goonmanji." And subverted rather hilariously, as well.
    -   Teen Genius Tedd is more or less the incarnation of this trope... except, apparently, when one of the girls involved happens to be his own cousin. The Westermark Effect is a cruel, cruel mistress, although there is a fan theory that Tedd is simply in denial about finding his own cousin attractive, hence the unconvincingly exaggerated response.
    -   When Duck, one of the comic shop regulars, learns that Nanase and Ellen are in a relationship, he immediately reports this to his friends:
-   In _Ensign Sue Must Die_, Empress Sue tries to show off how evil she is... by making out with Uhura. Kirk declares that he likes this Sue better. Two sequels later, Chekov concurs:
    
    **Chekov:** _\[with hearts in his eyes\]_ That vas the best thing I've ever seen.
    
-   This popped up in _General Protection Fault_ when Sharon and Ki got in a Catfight due to a conflict of authority. As Trent put it "Don't let them stop - I'll go get a pair of bikinis and some Jell-O!" For added visual gag value, he shows up carrying Jell-O and bikinis right after they've stopped...
-   Reynardine from _Gunnerkrigg Court_ asks if the two female leads are about to kiss after a tender make-up because he "would be interested in watching". In his case, it's notable because he's a demon (well, sort of - it's complicated) and the girls in question are about twelve, although he may have said it just to get a rise out of them, but the fact that it's later revealed he's sort of in love with one of them may mean he said it out of a jealousy.
    -   And when Kat reveals that she's in a relationship with Paz, Reynardine takes a few seconds to process this before opening his mouth with a stupid grin on his face. She stomps on him before he can say something stupid.
-   One possible explanation for the (fictional) publisher of _Jet Dream_ being open to implied lesbianism while eschewing depictions of male homosexuality (even if the males look just like cute girls.)
-   _Last Res0rt_ had Addy forcefully kissing Jigsaw out of the clear blue on one page, and you can practically hear Jason Squee. Slick and White Noise are also visible in the background but are more shocked than anything else.
-   Johnny Danger comments on the lightsaber duel between the gruff and cynical Dr. Belinda Reines and Darth Tiffany in _Legostar Galactica_ by wanting to get Jello involved, or at least have them get down and dirty in the mud of Dagobah. His crewmates tell him that it's not that kind of catfight.
-   _Loserz_:
    -   Jodie and Alice get into a brawl over Eric while at the movies because Alice (Eric's girlfriend) didn't trust Jodie (Eric's best female friend) one bit. Before Eric breaks the fight up, this trope is in full play, including a couple of movie theater workers grabbing some popcorn.
    -   When Jodie confesses to Ben that she's had sex with Jesse, his response is that he doesn't know whether to get really angry or go jerk off for about five hours.
    -   In this strip, Jodie plans to purposely invoke this trope at a party by making out with girls to get the attention of a guy.
        
        **Eric:** So are we gonna go watch or what?  
        **Ben:** Of _course_ we are!
        
-   This trope is the basis for quite a bit of Fanservice in _Ménage à 3_, and is also effectively invoked in-setting by some of the characters from time to time (as, for example, when Zii shows Gary a video to prove that she once made out with Amber, and Gary asks enthusiastically for more proof). However, it should be noted that a lot of stuff is considered hot in this setting; it's a broad-minded comic with a good-looking cast.
-   This _Misfile_ strip. Cassiel and Jenny Jr. get into a fight, and a security guard thinks it's hot.
-   Averted in this _Mountain Time_, as the lesbians shown are as boring as any other couple.
-   This page from _Mystic Revolution_.
-   Duncan in _Niels_ is at one point determined to set up Natalie (his wife) with another woman.
-   _9th Elsewhere_: Note that this takes place during a non-storyline, joke strip.
    
    **Carmen:** Besides, thanks to all the wonderful boys I've met in my short but ostentatiously miserable lifetime, I play for a different team now. If you know what I mean.  
    **Eiji:** Well, there's my happy thought for the day!
    
-   _The Order of the Stick_:
-   _Penny Arcade_:
-   Parodied in _Planet Zebeth_ when Kraid witnesses a deathmatch between two Samii. A moment later, the pair mysteriously find a swimming pool full of mud and decide to chuck the whole deathmatch thing. It's all a daydream, of course, as a nearby minion rudely informs him.
    
    "I don't know... but being in here makes me want to wrestle rather than just blast you..."  
    "No... I just want to make out with you instead."  
    "Yes! Let's make out!"  
    "Lots!"
    
-   Brent from _Pv P_. When Jade's sister Miranda appears, Brent assumes she is someone Jade has found/hired to fulfill his fantasy of watching Jade get it on with another woman.
-   In _RPG World_, one of Diane's abilities was a Kiss that acted as a weak heal spell. Cue a boss fight where Cherry nearly gets killed and Hero tells Diane to Kiss Cherry to heal her (Cherry and Diane don't even like each other at this point). Eikre loves every second of it, even though Diane and Cherry are both grimacing and it's the most reluctant kiss ever.
-   In _Sexy Losers_, when Mr. Shibata's wife starts an affair with an 18-year-old girl, his response is to install video cameras in her bedroom.
-   Robin of _Shortpacked!_ has used the tactic of making out with another woman for public display as a means to some elaborate end (this, of course, before she entered seriously into a relationship with a lesbian).
-   _Sinfest_:
    -   The subject of a running gag, with its two succubi that Devil uses to try and seduce Slick to (further?) evil with their girl-on-girl shenanigans. (One of them — Fuschia — has since fallen in mushy love with Criminy after being purified by Jesus and imperfectly restored to evil by Devil.)
    -   This page where Slick witnesses Monique hitting on a girl.
-   In _Skin Horse_, the 70s-styled robot Sweetdaddy Jupiter Velvet learns that his ex, the Water Cooler is seeing someone else and says "that brings a bot low." When he learns the cat ain't a dude, he adds "Picturing this elevates the bot slightly."
-   In a guest strip in _Sluggy Freelance_, Zoë and Gwynn cajole Torg and Riff into cleaning the house by promising that they're going to kiss once it's clean.
-   _Something\*Positive_:
    -   Averted when Lisa and Monette's relationship hits a rough patch and Lisa gets angsty about it at work. When she leaves to talk to Monette, one of her coworkers, an older man, remarks, "Just when I finally concoct the perfect lesbian fantasy about those two, they go and spoil it all by being people."
    -   One comic shows that God likes Him some girl-on-girl. The only reason He even said homosexuality was a sin was to Batman Gambit lesbians into having more sex just to spite Him.
        
        **Angel:** Uh, God? I think two lesbians are having sex down there, hoping you'll watch.  
        **God:** This whole "homosexuality angers God" business gets me more awesome private shows than anything else I've tried. What hair color they got?  
        **Angel:** Both are redheads, sir.  
        **God:** Mmmmm... Jehovah like.
        
-   In _The Space Between_, Frank most definitely agrees, as evidenced in this strip. By Word of God, the pale color is all the blood in his body heading south.
-   _Spinnerette_:
    -   While a medical student is treating Spinnerette's injuries, Sahira tells him that she shared an upside-down kiss with the new superheroine. This (along with her ample assets) was a way to keep him from getting too nosy.
    -   When a teenage boy who used his powers to invade Spinnerette's dreams without her consent learns that she's in a relationship with Mecha Maid, he responds with excitement. Spinnerette responds to this by slapping him repeatedly and shouting, "I'm not gay for your amusement!"
    -   Sarah Nicole, upon seeing Spinnerette and Mecha Maid get into a fight that involves a lot of wrestling and spilled oil, frantically crams the pies that she's been eating to "cure" her lesbianism into her mouth and chants, "You don't like girls. You don't like girls. You don't like girls."
-   _Vampire Cheerleaders_: During the _"Adventures in Space... and Time?!"_ arc, Zoe becomes so emotional after reuniting with Suki, that she lays one on her. Then tackles her to the ground and starts humping her leg in front of everyone at Lita World. All the male attendees start cheering and snapping cellphone pictures of it, despite Suki's protests.
-   According to this, lesbians are one of two exceptions to people not liking public displays of affection (the other being old people).

    Web Original 

-   Pointed out more than once by Phase of the _Whateley Universe_. He's commented on this when he goes to talk to Zenith and finds Zenith 'busy' with Sahar. He's brought it up when Fey is necking with Bugs, and when Chaka is hanging with Riptide. He dislikes it when people bring it up by talking about him and Vox, however, because while he looks like a hot brunette, he's decidedly male between the ears (and elsewhere).

    Web Videos 

-   Averted in Chip Cheezum's Retsupurae video "Yowie wowie!!!" Most of the video consists of two girls kissing, but they're dressed up as Naruto and Sasuke acting out a Slash Fic.
-   The Cinema Snob expressed a little disappointment that parts of the Messalina/Agrippina sex scene were cut in _Caligula II: Messalina, Messalina_. He notes that it's usually out of character for him to complain about a movie he hates being shorter than it could have been, but come on, two chicks were having sex!
-   _CollegeHumor_:
-   Diamanda Hagan (herself a lesbian, so she at least has justification) has been known to _kill_ when lesbian teasing isn't followed through.
-   The _Honest Trailers_ video for _Maleficent_ has the narrator's Alternate Aesop Interpretation of the movie:
    
    **Narrator:** If your movie comes after _Frozen_, true love only exists between two girls. _\[beat\] Aw... yeah_.
    
-   In "An Intervention for MySpace," everyone goes nuts when TMZ and The Superficial start making out.
-   Moviebob goes further than just finding girl-on-girl action hot, and suggests that Girls' Love "from a story perspective makes for great improvement in terms of dramatic relatability" and that _Titanic (1997)_ might have been improved by swapping out Leonardo DiCaprio for Gina Gershon "and not just visually." It seems he even thought that lesbianism renders men obsolete:
    
    I figured that was the end of the line as far as my prospective future with the opposite sex was concerned... If they can be "with" each other now (yes, "now," as far as a sixth grader knew this was a brand new invention) what the hell will they want with us? As if I needed to be more insecure. To this day, I don't really grasp why any woman sleeps with any man, period.
    
-   Channel Awesome:
    -   The Nostalgia Critic always voices very enthusiastic approval whenever he sees a hint of Les Yay in the movies/shows he reviews, although he's also nice enough to put a few Yaoi Fanboy moments in there too.
    -   During the _TGWTG Year One Brawl_, Spoony and Sage conspire to get The Nostalgia Chick and That Girl with the Goggles to fight, while they take pictures with their phones. There was going to be a reciprocation of Spoony and Sage having a girlish pillow fight, but they only had time for one take, and it was ruined by everyone cracking up at their eerily accurate performances.
-   Torn to pieces, alongside Bait-and-Switch Lesbians, on the webshow _That's Gay._
    
    **Brian:** A straight girl kissing women is what's really exciting, let's face it — Katy Perry's "I Kissed a Girl" went number one for a reason. Because nobody wants to hear a full-time resident of vag-town sing this:  
    **Woman with acoustic guitar:** _I kissed a girl and I liked it/Makes sense cause I'm a lesbian/ I kissed a girl and I liked it/Makes sense cause I like to kiss girls..._  
    _\[men in background walk away disgusted\]_
    

    Western Animation 

-   _Adventure Time_: In the episode "All the Little People", Finn finds a bag containing miniature animate figurines of himself and all his friends and associates. He gets addicted to setting up romantic relationships between various characters, which starts to disturb Jake. Eventually, he sets up a situation where Flame Princess catches Finn cheating on her with Princess Bubblegum, resulting in a violent Cat Fight. Finn gets wide-eyed and blushes at the sight of his two former crushes beating each other up.
-   In an episode of _American Dad!_, when they are discussing bullying, Francine tells Stan about a time she got bullied at school: in the locker room during a shower that involved the bullies rubbing her so hard with soap and such, they left red marks. Then it cuts to a shot of Stan sitting with his jacket on his lap.
-   One episode of _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_ involved physical real-life pop-up ads filling up the Aqua Teen's house. When Meatwad gets surrounded by pornographic pop-up ads, one of Shake's first questions to him was if any of the ads involved women-on-women action.
-   You'd be forgiven for looking at early promotional material of _Drawn Together_ and thinking that the show is entirely about Foxxy Love french-kissing Princess Clara. In-universe, their kiss was popular enough to get an audiobook read by Droopy Dog.
-   In the first episode of the _Family Guy_ spin-off _The Cleveland Show_, responding to an "anything we can do" query, Cleveland asks if Lois and Bonnie can make out—they do, to the shocked enjoyment of the men.
-   _Family Guy_:
    -   Quagmire, Peter, and every straight male in Quahog are obviously big fans of this. This trope was parodied in a beer commercial that Lois was watching which had two bikini babes drinking beer and making out. Lois remarks "Oh, that is _such_ a male fantasy! Women drinking beer..."
    -   A notable example in "One If by Clam, Two If by Sea" is when Peter and company try out a new bar to "act like idiots" in and realizes that they're the only guys there. Quagmire is quick to assume that the 2 girls making out by the disk are "practicing" but Cleveland, being the sharp one in the bunch, points out that "I don't think they're practicing." This reveal is followed by his 3 friends exclaiming "oh" four times in a row, squeezing into that short statement how their minds go through the states of; standing corrected, realizing what was just said, joyfully approving of the information that the statement implicated and, finally, dismay at the fact that the information is of no value to them... Still doesn't stop Quagmire from trying though.
    -   In "Brian Sings and Swings," Meg pretends to be a lesbian, because that way the lesbian community in her school accepts her. Peter's reaction is "That is _awesome!_" and Chris and Quagmire try to film her with her girlfriend - despite the fact that she's normally treated as being utterly repulsive.
    -   "I Am Peter, Hear Me Roar": Peter is sent to Sensitivity Training and comes back as a Straw Feminist. Watching Lois and the sensitivity training instructor have a Cat Fight snaps him out of it.
    -   "Stew-Roids" with Bonnie asks Lois to put suntan lotion on her back; she removes her bikini top and Lois removes her shirt. A hole in the fence appears, and we realize it's Quagmire and another hole in the fence appears around his groin area.
    -   Then, there is "Partial Terms of Endearment" where Lois meets her college friend, whom she experimented with. Peter's first reaction is to thank God.
        
        _"God. He knows what turns you on!"_
        
-   _Futurama_:
    -   Farnsworth and Bender in the movie _Bender's Game_ like this trope; or at least, their fantasy alter-egos Greyfarn the Wizard and Titanius Anglesmith, Fancy Man of Cornwood are. To clarify, the alter-egos of Leela and Amy, Leegolas the Centaur and Gynecaladriel, the Queen of the Water Nymphos were making out because Leegolas saved Gynecaladriel's life, and Greyfarn and Titanius spared a moment from their task of saving the universe to watch.
    -   In "Love and Rocket," the Planet Express ship gets a new, female personality and Bender starts to date "her." When Fry tries to wash the ship, Bender shoves him away, but when Amy does it in a bikini, he watches approvingly.
-   In the _Gargoyles_ episode "High Noon," Coldstone (or rather, his evil persona, Iago) and Macbeth are watching a wrestling match between Elisa and a (barely clothed) human Demona. The line bellow takes on a double meaning when the Weird Sisters reveal the whole battle was, in fact, a diversion. Takes on a triple meaning when you realize Macbeth can feel everything Demona does.
    
    **Coldstone:** Well, this is diverting.  
    **Macbeth:** You don't know the half of it.
    
-   In _Harley Quinn_ by Season Two when Dr. Psycho openly states girl-on-girl is hot when Harley kisses Poison Ivy to break Psycho's mind control of Ivy. It doesn't wake Ivy, but it does distract Psycho enough for Harley to put a control-blocker in Ivy's ear.
    
    -   Pretty much most of Season Two as the show finally goes into the fan-supported Ho Yay between Harl and Ivy. As revenge for defeating him in front of an unimpressed Darkseid, Psycho broadcasts Ivy's memories of making out with Harley to embarrass Ivy in front of her fiancée Kite-Man. _Everybody_ in Gotham and beyond just sit there gawking, with Batgirl Barbara Gordon and her dad the Commissioner covering each other's eyes, Alfred drawing the curtains of Wayne Manor - and then peeking out to watch anyway - and the rest of Harley's crew waking up and noting that the revelation is going to screw up the team.
    
    **Bane** (watching from his own prison the Pit, having guessed earlier about Harley and Ivy's mutual attraction): The tension was palpable!
    
-   In the _Justice League Unlimited_ episode "Grudge Match" Sonar seems to get a little too much enjoyment from watching Tala and Roulette nearly getting into a fight. This inspires the idea of creating a new Meta-Brawl featuring only female fighters (in this case, Justice League members mind-controlled by through their comm-link earpieces).
    -   Played with in another episode where the Flash, supposedly a slick ladies' man, becomes tongue-tied with Fire, leading Hawkgirl to rib him to tell her how he feels, but his reluctance makes Hawkgirl add why it wouldn't work between him and Fire:
        
        **Hawkgirl:** You know, she's... \[_dramatic pause, and Flash's eyes start going wide in anxiety_\] ...Brazilian!
        
        **Flash:** \[_annoyed_\] Ha. Ha.
        
-   In _Rick and Morty_ Jerry is devastated after Beth cheats on him with her clone, but quickly forgives her in exchange for letting him watch them have sex.
-   In the _Sealab 2021_ episode "Splitsville" the Cat Fight the two Debbies and Yumi got in ended with them making out. Everyone at the bar (except Stormy, who got struck blind) watched and cheered them on. And when Debbie Dupree told Sparks and Quinn about it later, Quinn got distracted from the nuclear crisis at hand at the thought of the girls making out.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   In "How the Test Was Won," Homer fantasizes about Marge kissing Lindsey Neagle.
    -   Subverted in "Viva Ned Flanders," when Homer and Ned accidentally marry floozies in Las Vegas whilst drunk. Homer suggests to Ned the next day that having two wives could have its advantages, and we cut to his fantasy of Marge and the Vegas lady doing the yardwork while Homer lounges on the hammock. Even in the fantasy, Marge says lasciviously "You know Homer, there's so much more that two wives could do for you..." to which he replies, "I hear digging, but I don't hear chopping!"
    -   Averted in "Fear of Flying" where Homer tries to find a new bar. One scene shows him standing in a crowd of women saying, "There's something bothering me about this place... \*gasp\* This lesbian bar doesn't have a fire exit! Enjoy your death trap, ladies!"
        
        **Lesbian:** What's _her_ problem?
        
-   _Stripperella_ gives the Kiss of Life to a supermodel who bloats up to enormous size and falls in a swimming pool (It Makes Sense in Context... somewhat) leading one onlooker to state that if the supermodel looked like she did five minutes ago, that scene would look really hot.
    -   In another episode, Stripperella was a guest in a talk show, where the hostess, Sally Rose, went off-topic and talks about how sexy Stripperella is, describing her attractive features, and hints on wanting to have sex with her. If you noticed, the camera gets closer to the two, apparently hoping for some action.
