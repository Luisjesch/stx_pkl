_"Well, in any major city, minding your own business is a science. First thing they teach women in rape prevention is never cry for help. Always yell 'fire'. Nobody answers to 'help'. You holler 'fire', they come running."_

— **Detective Somerset**, _Se7en_

Fire alarms, security systems, and other such means of alert are intended to be passive ways of letting people know that something's gone wrong, and are meant to signal that a specific kind of hazard is present. However, sometimes a character is in a bad spot and needs help, but has no active means to summon anyone. By deliberately tripping whatever alarm is available, they can broadcast their distress and (hopefully) count on whoever shows up to assist them. This includes fire alarms, burglar alarms, and old-fashioned signals such as bells.

Note that an alarm being tripped for its intended purpose, as a means of demonstration of function, or as a distraction for enemies doesn't count.

-   _The Abyss_: After Lindsey finds out that the Navy SEALs have brought a nuclear warhead onto the rig, she goes to their room and demands that they remove it.

-   _Aliens_: When Ripley realizes that she and Newt are locked in the facility's medical bay with live facehuggers, she first tries to get the attention of the Colonial Marines in the control room through one of the security cameras, not knowing that Burke has turned off the camera feed.

The Marines don't know what's actually happening, but Hicks sees the alarm notification on the computer and they come to her and Newt's rescue.
-   _Die Hard_: John is desperate to get help to fight the terrorists who have taken over the Nakatomi building, but they've cut the phone lines. So he triggers a fire alarm in order to get firefighters (and hopefully police) to come and check it out. The terrorists coolly respond by calling 911 and telling them that it's a false alarm (and then disable the fire alarm system for good measure).

    -   The Thing first infiltrates the camp in the form of a dog. After it is put in the kennel with the other dogs, it starts to transform so it can absorb and duplicate them. MacReady hears the real dogs' terrified barking and howling from several rooms away, and pulls the fire alarm to get the attention of the other members of the team so they will come and help out.
    -   Windows discovers that Bennings has been attacked and copied by the Thing, and tells MacReady and Fuchs. MacReady looks out a window and sees the Bennings-Thing running away. The fire alarm is pulled again to bring the other team members, but it isn't shown who did it.

    Literature 

-   This happens accidentally in _Brother Bells_. When a gang of robbers breaks into a monastery and believes gold to be hidden in the bell tower, they glance up and see the bells, believing that they _are_ the gold.

-   _Dreadnought!_: Exploited by Piper when she's confined to her quarters under computer guard after the initial meeting with _Star Empire_'s hijackers. Knowing that the computer guard won't keep someone locked in a burning room, she sets off the fire alarm by overheating some circuitry in the wall with her curling iron. It works because (thanks to her engineer boyfriend) she knows how to disable the alarms that would normally alert the bridge and bring a whole pack of Red Shirts down on a prisoner under computer guard whose room actually suddenly caught fire.
-   Artemis Fowl: In _The Eternity Code_, when Artemis has Butler in need of fairy magic, he makes a quick call on the phone and mentions key-words about Haven City that would set off all of Foaly's monitor alarms so they would send someone to investigate, and luckily for Artemis, Holly was just in the area.
