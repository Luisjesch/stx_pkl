_"After dealing with \[Lord Grathan's\] son, I stayed to socialize with Lady Grathan. An added humiliation for him."_

Alice seduces Bob's lover Charlie as an act of one-upmanship over Bob.

If it's done non-consensually, it's Revenge by Proxy. In _this_ trope, however, Charlie is a willing party, and _that's_ the particular sting — that Charlie was more than happy to cheat on Bob. This is an Invoked Trope version of Emasculated Cuckold, although it's not gender-specific. Occasionally Charlie is not Bob's lover, merely his crush, but Alice wants to "steal" Charlie from Bob nonetheless.

Alice's feelings toward Charlie may vary, but the key to this trope is that Alice's relationship with Bob is _more important_ that her relationship with Charlie. In an odd way, she cares more about Bob—and hurting him—than she does about Charlie.

This could also be considered the Inverted Trope of Love Triangle. Rather than conflict caused by competing over a lover, competing over a lover is the manifestation of an existing conflict.

A subtrope of Relationship Sabotage. When it's in the context of Japanese porn, it's Netorare. Compare Better Partner Assertion. Also see Foe Cooties and Sleeping with the Boss's Wife. See also Seduction-Proof Marriage for cases where the seduction attempt fails.
