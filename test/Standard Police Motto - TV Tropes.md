Um, that's not quite how it goes, Barricade...

_Die Polizei - Dein Freund und Helfer! <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>_ 

The Los Angeles Police Department's famous motto, "To Protect and to Serve" (coined in 1955), has been adopted by many other police departments across the English-speaking world, sometimes in its alternate form "to serve and protect." It's been adopted by so many police departments, in fact, that it's practically a Stock Phrase in the English-speaking world. Unsurprisingly, it shows up a lot in fiction as well. Played straight in most Police Procedurals and Cop Shows, it's routinely subverted, lampshaded, and/or otherwise played with in other media.

Not to be confused with Miranda Rights.

-   The Casseline Brotherhood, in _Kushiel's Legacy_, say this a lot.

    Live-Action TV

    Web Comics 

-   _Paradigm Shift_ uses this trope to Show Their Work: "We Serve and Protect," the motto of the Chicago Police Department, can be clearly read on the side of a Chicago police cruiser on this page.
-   This is Trenton's motto in _Dead Winter_. He's the last good cop in a corrupt police force.

-   The National Police of France uses "Pro Patria Vigilant" = Vigilance for the Homeland.

## Subverted, parodied, lampshaded, etc., in:

    Comic Books 

-   Marvel Comics once produced a _Silver Surfer_ T-shirt bearing the slogan, "TO SURF AND PROTECT."

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Transformers Film Series_:
    -   In _Transformers (2007)_, the Decepticon Barricade has a police car mode with the phrase "To punish and enslave." According to Michael Bay, the altered motto apparently got a few laughs from the present LAPD officers providing security.
    -   In _Transformers: The Last Knight_, Barricade retains this motto while also gaining an alternate "Keep calm and hail Megatron."
-   In the film _The Mask_, Stanley Ipkiss tries to get a policeman guarding him to help Tina (who's being chased by Mooks) by telling him "Serve and protect!"
-   In _The Terminator_, the motto on LAPD cars is shown as "To Care and to Protect" at least twice. But after the Terminator crashes and abandons a car whose motto we've already seen as the preceding, the empty car's motto has inexplicably changed to "Dedicated to Serve."
-   In the low-budget sci-fi movie _R.O.T.O.R._, the motto of the robotic law-enforcement project is "To Judge and Execute." Guess what happens to the prototype?
-   In _Wrongfully Accused_, at least one police car has "To Swerve and Protect" on the side.
-   In _The Untouchables (1987)_, when Ness and Malone interview police cadets to add to the team, both trainees give stock mottoes when asked why they want to join the force. The first even stammers out "To protect and serve" verbatim.

    Jokes 

-   In 1992, Los Angeles erupted into riots after the videotaped beating of a black man, Rodney King, by officers of the Los Angeles Police Department. This lead to a joke about the department:

Q: What's the new slogan for the LAPD?

A: _We'll treat you like a King!_

-   In 2011, the owner of a Zanesville, Ohio exotic animal refuge released all his animals - including tigers, lions, bears and wolves - before committing suicide. The police didn't have much of a choice but to issue a shoot-to-kill order. The story made major headlines as 49 animals were shot by the end of it all. This lead to a joke:

Q: What's the new slogan for the Zanesville police department?

A: _It's a jungle out there!_

    Literature 

-   Shows up several times in the _Discworld_ series:
    -   The Ankh Morpork Watch has the motto "Fabricati Diem, Pvnc", which is Dog Latin for "Make My Day, Punk". In-story, Fred Colon claims that it translates as "To Protect and Serve". The full motto is in fact "Fabricati Diem, Pvncti Agvnt Celeriter," but has been rendered partially unreadable over time. This supposedly means "Make the Day, the Moments Pass Quickly."
    -   Pratchett also uses it in _Guards! Guards!_ with the prophecy that Carrot fulfills: "Yea, the king will come ... and Protect and Serve the People with his Sword."
    -   In _Feet of Clay_, the motto on the Vimes family arms (defunct since Old Stoneface killed the last king) is "Protego Et Servio". The Vimeses have been watchmen for a _long_ time.
    -   The same book has the golem watchman give his own spin on the _RoboCop (1987)_ example above: "To Serve The Public Trust, Protect The Innocent, And Seriously Prod Buttock".
-   In the _Myth Adventures_, Asprin uses this for one of his chapter-beginning quotes: "To Serve and Protect. Traditional motto of protection rackets."

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Square One TV_: Mathnet's motto is "To cogitate and to solve."
-   In _Corner Gas_, Karen and Davis have a long, drawn-out argument over whether or not their cop car says "To Protect and Serve" or "To Serve and Protect."
-   When Carl fears Mike might not pass the upcoming police fitness exam on _Mike & Molly_, he asks Mike if he's prepared to spend the rest of his career behind a desk, where he can "protect and file."

    Video Games 

-   A police officer in _Destroy All Humans!_ can sometimes be heard constantly repeating this to themselves if their mind is read. Until they get it wrong: "swerve and defect...dammit, I lost it!"
-   In _The Longest Journey_, the same cop that gave us Move Along, Nothing to See Here and Sorry, I'm Gay lines, also finished his conversation with "We are here to protect and to serve", right after proving as useless and outright obstructive to the heroine as he possibly could.
-   _Grand Theft Auto_: The motto of the Los Santos Police Department appears to be "Obey & Survive".
-   _Fallout_: Protectrons say "protect and serve". It's somewhere between playing it straight and subverting it, given that while not particularly powerful or competent, they do actually attempt to maintain law and order, except for in 3 where they're just haywire robots. Parodied more directly in 76, where the reprogrammed scavneger collectrons say "collect and store".

    Western Animation 

-   In _The Simpsons_, an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon shows shows Scratchy entering a police car that turns out to be driven by Itchy. The motto is "To Protect and Sever." Bloody carnage ensues.
-   _South Park_: The side of Officer Barbrady's patrol car has "To Patronize and Annoy" on it.
-   The tagline of _Science Court_ was "To Serve and Observe", even though it wasn't about a police department.
