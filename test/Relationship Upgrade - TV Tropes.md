_"Huzzah!"_

The moment when two characters become an Official Couple.

There may have been Unresolved Sexual Tension earlier, romantic feelings on either side or even an unmistakable Held Gaze or two, but that was all on paper. This is _it_, the actual relationship. It's happening, starting now. In a work, it's that point where until further notice there's no more sense in asking Will They or Won't They?. In Real Life, it's that point beyond which you'd feel justified calling the other person "my boyfriend/girlfriend." Expect the Shipper on Deck for this particular couple to be proud of them and/or jumping on joy. For The Matchmaker, this is often their Series Goal. If the characters they're trying to hook up finally successfully get together, expect them to rejoice and declare "Mission Accomplished".

This is the kind of plot development that gets an audience's attention, so it is often seen in parts of the plot where it is imperative for the story to do just that (e.g. in delivering a Plot Twist or a Cliffhanger, or as a cherry on top of the series Grand Finale). If the relationship was a major source of tension in the work, and the writers don't plan for introducing a new source of this nature instead of the one they just blew apart with this big bang of a payoff, they might find out the audience is not as interested in the story any more.

Most commonly broadcasted with a First Kiss, but every once in a while you find a more… drastic variant (Glad-to-Be-Alive Sex comes to mind). Compare Relationship Reveal — a moment where an implied but existing couple becomes canon. A move from casual to serious can involve I Got You a Drawer. Contrast Derailing Love Interests — where a relationship downgrade happens to a Romantic False Lead so an Official Couple can be hooked up. Though they often coincide (e.g. in a Last-Minute Hookup) the two are far from synonymous; a Relationship Upgrade can be the beginning of hardships, trials and tribulations that the relationship may not survive at all.

See Significant Name Shift.

Not to be confused with characters upgrading their abilities by socialization.

**WARNING: Due to the inherent nature of this trope, the examples below will be spoiler-heavy.**

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   For _Digimon Adventure 02_, the Christmas Episode was an opportunity to upgrade some relationships—i.e. Ken and Iori could from that moment on converse with each other in a friendly, civil way rather than with constant unease. Also, Ken laughed for what was pretty much the first time—much to everyone's amazement. In the more traditional use of the term, this was also implied to be when Sora and Yamato/Matt started dating.
-   In the last episode of _Candy☆Boy_, Yukino and Kanade's relationship appears to get an upgrade from a Pseudo-Romantic Friendship to something more—not hindered by the fact that they are fraternal twin sisters.
-   _Mazinger Z_: The moment Kouji and Sayaka becoming an item varies between adaptations, but in the Gosaku Ota alternate manga, it happened when they kissed right before Kouji sortied to fight a hopeless battle against the Mykene Empire army.
-   _Karin_, when Usui finally acknowledges the millions of hints given to him that Karin and him were meant to be and does what Karin herself was too scared (for good reason) to do and confesses to her. This drives Karin to tears.
-   _Science Ninja Team Gatchaman_: It happened at the end of the third series (Gatchaman Fight) when Jun finally chose Ken over Joe and they got together.
-   _Sweet Blue Flowers_ has Akira asking Fumi out, after learning Fumi has feelings for her.
-   _Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water_: The kiss between Jean and Nadia may be treated as the moment where this upgrade takes place. Unfortunately, it was very inconveniently placed in the middle of an arc, with about 20% canon material. (And even then, it's treated as a cruel tease, as the writers quickly take them back to square one instantly afterwards.) Regardless, they end up as an official couple in the epilogue (although 31, and 35-39 also show the upgrade).
-   _Toradora!_ is a good example of this trope. With a confusing Love Dodecahedron and twice your daily serving of Will They or Won't They? , Taiga and Ryuuji _finally_ get upgraded from… whatever they were, to a couple in episode 24, where Ryuuji proposes to Taiga.
-   At the end of _...Virgin Love_ Kaoru and Daigo upgrade from Friends with Benefits to lovers after Kaoru overcomes his commitment issues.
-   In _Fullmetal Alchemist_, Ed and Winry play out this trope well. Before leaving for the west, Ed somewhat "confesses" his feelings to Winry at the train station, using the words: "It's equivalent exchange! I'll give you half of my life, so give me half of yours!" Though he corresponds alchemy with love, Winry acknowledges what he really means, resulting in her agreeing to give him all of her life. Then, she quickly corrects herself, being flustered when those words dawned on her. Depending on how you want to interpret it (some say this was a proposal, while others say it was merely a confession), Ed and Winry end up with two children anyway, not to mention a wedding ring on Edward's finger. After spending their entire life denying any romantic feelings, they pass their comfort zone and hit home run!
-   In _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_, Mu la Flaga and Murrue Ramius manage to upgrade from Unresolved Sexual Tension into an actual relationship only after they've defected from the Earth Alliance and are thus no longer officially constrained by the military's rules against fraternization.
-   At the end of _Happy Lesson_, Chitose's mothers decide that he's a grown man and doesn't need mother figures anymore… he needs _wives_. They all change into bridal gowns and marry the poor guy on the spot.
-   Done very methodically in _Psyren_ between Ageha and Amamiya, after quite a length of implied Two Guys and a Girl and light harem.
-   Occurs at the end of episode 18 of _D.N.Angel_ between Daisuke and Riku.
-   In _Fairy Tail_, Alzack and Bisca are revealed to have gotten married after the time skip. Sherry is also engaged to Ren after the Oracion Seis arc hints at them getting together.
-   In _The Familiar of Zero_, Louise and Saito start getting serious with their relationship at the beginning of the fourth season. They also marry at the end of the series.
-   Guts and Casca from _Berserk_ started as teeth-clenched comrades, but eventually worked up to Fire-Forged Friends in Volume 8. Eventually, with Casca realizing the nature of her feelings towards Guts and Guts being encouraged by his other comrades, they were led into becoming an Official Couple when they shared their first kiss in Volume 9, progressing to much lovemaking soon after. Things looking up for them, right? Unfortunately, it all started to come tumbling down in Volumes 12-14; in the Eclipse, their relationship is brutally ripped in half when Griffith sacrifices the Band of the Hawk to become Femto and as his first act as a Godhand, rapes Casca to insanity in front of Guts (who is Forced to Watch the ordeal). Casca has since then been reduced to a Cute Mute who completely distrusts Guts, demoting them from Battle Couple to Star-Crossed Lovers. Given the recent return of Casca's sanity, time will tell if they can still be together.
-   Daisuke and Hinako in _Bitter Virgin_ finally become a couple in the end. Sadly, not even they think it will last because they assume one day they would find someone better to support them.
-   In _Case Closed_, Wataru Takagi and Miwako Sato get their relationship upgrade in the second part of the "The Scar that Evokes the Past" arc. After Takagi is beaten near death and then shot when he's in a Hostage Situation with the killer of the week, Sato visits him at the hospital and she is relieved the he's okay. At the end, when he mentions how many almost kisses have taken place between them, she leans over him and _actually_ gives him The Big Damn Kiss, establishing their relationship.
    -   Similarly, the "Timeless Sakura Love" case is the one where Sumiko Kobayashi and Ninzaburo Shiratori also become a couple. Kobayashi is the star witness to a case that Shiratori is working on, she learns about his former courting of Sato and almost cuts him off because she fears he's using her to forget Sato, he tells her that she was his First Girl After All but she still is unconvinced and depressed... but once the culprit fails to do her in and Shiratori gives him a Shut Up, Hannibal! that sounds almost exactly like the one from their Forgotten First Meeting, she remembers him from their shared past, and accepts his definitive Love Confession.
-   _ReLIFE_: Kariu liked Ohga from the start, but it took him almost 100 chapters to realize his own feelings. After some prodding from friends, they start dating.
-   _Happy Happy Clover_: While Shallot and Mallow are both great friends, Shallot has mentioned to Clover earlier in the series that he has a crush on Mallow but he's to shy to tell her that. However in the final volume of the manga, one story titled "Mallow's Heart Sours" contains an accidental love confession between Shallot and Mallow in private. Basically, Mallow asks Shallot to find an ingredient she needs since she wants to be a nurse, which Shallot did. This resulted in him not showing up at Professor Hoot's school the next day and Clover, Kale, and Mallow are the only students present. Mallow decides to visit Shallot's house where he is seen laying in bed covered in bruises and injuries on his hands. Mallow starts taking care of him but Shallot starts asking her why she is at his place and not at school. She replies by stating that he was absent that day and starts asking him how he get hurt. He starts becoming very tongue twisted and has a hard time responding until he yells at Mallow that he really liked her. This causes Mallow to blush and becomes speechless for a moment and quickly hug Shallot in bed. Mallow then mentions that her heart has been beating alot lately and felt weird. They later end up getting married and have children of their own.
-   In _My Love Story!!_, Takeo and Yamato get together very early on (in the third episode of the anime), subverting the usual trend of pandering the ship. Instead, the series focuses on how their romantic relationship blooms.
-   Haru and Tsurezure from _Ojojojo_ get together pretty quickly (Chapter 14), but their nature as a Chastity Couple means that it takes a while for them to do things that normal couples do (like kiss, hold hands, or even refer to each other by their first names).
-   Hori and Miyamura from _Horimiya_ start dating when Hori's father asks if they're already going out (Hori initially stutters, but gives a very annoyed "yes, you got a problem with that?").
-   After a few episodes of Ship Tease, Professor Kukui pops the question and gets married to Professor Burnet at the end of _Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon_'s Nebby arc.
-   _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_: Kaguya and Shirogane officially start dating over winter break, after having spent a year engaging in a Duel of Seduction and an additional week in the "not quite friends, not quite lovers" stage after their First Kiss.
-   _Crazy Food Truck_: In the final chapter, Gordon and Arisa kiss and have sex for the first time in the food truck, right before the military catches up to them.
-   Happens in episode 26 of _Eureka Seven_ for Renton and Eureka. Renton's absence made Eureka realize his importance and what he meant to her.

-   Superman: Clark and Lois were casually dating already, but the Relationship Upgrade happens in "Krisis of the Krimson Kryptonite", when he proposes.

Finally, he tries to invoke this trope by planting a Forceful Kiss on her, and tells her how much the kiss is going to change things. Laura, however, permanently breaks off their relationship instead by telling him she no longer has feelings for him. Julian's angry outburst in response finishes off their friendship, as well (though Laura admits to Gambit she still cares for him at the end of the issue).
-   _Robin_: Tim and Steph have a sort of flirting relationship in their masked identities which Tim sort of tries to discourage since he already had a girlfriend at the time and knew he'd never get Batman's permission to tell Steph his secret identity. After she saves his life and he kisses her in thanks he quickly goes to end his already failed relationship with Ari (though she breaks up with him before he can get the words out) and informs Steph that any relationship they were to have would have to stick to their costumed ids. When Steph makes it clear this isn't an issue for her they quickly upgrade to official status, and start going on dates in costume.
-   Karolina and Nico from _Runaways_ seemed doomed to forever be stuck in Will They or Won't They? status until they finally got together in the 2017 relaunch of the series. Their Big Damn Kiss was the culmination of over a decade (in real time; two years in canon) of romantic tension. The TV adaptation decided to fast-track things and have them become a couple at the end of the first season.

-   That moment in Chapter 14 of _Origin Story_ where Alex reveals that she's had an epiphany about her awkward relationship with Louise:
    
    **Alex Harris:** So anyway, uh, after I sort of figured out I loved you, I started asking myself if this was for real. I mean, uh, are our feelings for each other real? Are we really falling in love, or are we just desperate? I feel love for you. I love you. I know I love you. I can feel it. But… but… you were in a really crap place, and I was in a really crap place, and maybe we just, uh, I don’t know, latched on each other, you know? I was just sort of wondering. Just wondering if we, you and me, if we hooked onto the only people we know who gave a shit. You know? I’ve been thinking about it, I mean. The whole desperation thing. About whether our feelings are real. And it’s why I’ve come to a decision about leaving you behind and hiding to keep you safe and whether or not we’re just being desperate. I’ve come to a decision about all of it. And what I’ve decided is, I don’t care. I love you, Louise. I know we’re not to the in love stage, but I want to be there. And I’m not running away from you. I’m not going anywhere unless you’re going with me.

-   Simon and Kaylee finally get it on at the very end of _Serenity_. They should've checked the ceiling before they chose their base of operations.
-   Modesty Blaise and her sidekick in the 1967 movie version (and they _sing_ about it). This is one of the reasons The Movie is considered Canon Discontinuity.
-   An unusual example in _Attack on Titan_: In the original manga/anime, Eren and Mikasa are adoptive siblings in an Ambiguous Situation. The film version removes the sibling angle and ambiguity, and makes them a full-blown Official Couple.
-   All three film versions of _Annie_ (1982, 1999 and 2014) have Warbucks (or, in the 2014 version Stacks) and Grace become an Official Couple in the end. While in the stage version there's some Ship Tease between them, their actual upgrade is put off until the sequel _Annie Warbucks,_ but in the screen versions the romance is definite.

    Literature 

-   _Harry Potter_
    -   Harry and Ginny in _Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince_.
    -   Same with Ron and Hermione in Book 7.

-   Book four of _The Immortals_ has Daine and Numair realizing that they were meant for each other. The previous books give a few clues to this end, but not all that many—the fact that Daine was in her early teens and Numair in his late twenties, and her teacher, made him uncomfortable about the thing. Luckily for the author's observing Moral Guardians, Daine was already at an age where she would be considered an adult in her time period before this happened, and by that time Daine and Numair were no longer teacher and student, but friends and co-workers.
-   Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade. Han and Leia went through it. So did Jacen and Tenel Ka. Even Ben looks like he's going to get his own version of his parents' relationship in the person of Vestara Khai.

Though Murphy herself says "I am on so many drugs" in the middle of it and Molly seems to have finally accepted that their mentor/student relationship is truly over, so don't expect things to be that cut and dry.
    -   Or not. In _Battle Ground (2020)_ Murphy dies in battle, and is selected as a Valkyrie. Which has the side effect that she won't return as a Valkyrie until no-one on Earth remembers her. Also, thanks to some careless words by Lara Raith, Mab ends up forcibly engaging her to Harry. Only Molly's intervention keeps it from being an immediate wedding.

-   _Babylon 5_: John Sheridan and Delenn get theirs in "Ceremonies of Light and Dark" when he tells her, "...I can no longer imagine my world without you in it."

    -   Sheldon and Amy, though this is less a resolution of UST and more Sheldon finally getting over himself and recognizing that he and Amy are a couple.
        
        **Sheldon:** I would not be opposed to us no longer characterizing you as "not my girlfriend".  
        **Amy:** Interesting. Now try it without the quadruple-negative.
        
-   Booth and Brennan in _Bones_, despite several false starts, finally achieved their relationship upgrade at the end of Season 6.
-   On _Boy Meets World_, Cory and Topanga officially get together in the first episode of season three.
-   The writers and actors of _Castle (2009)_ didn't even try to hide the fact that Kate Beckett and Richard Castle were eventually going to become a couple; the tension (which was arguably the primary driving force behind the show) was in seeing how. As of season four's finale, "Always", it finally happened where Castle proclaims his feelings for Beckett and she returns them at the end of the episode. Season five has them secretly dating (even though Everybody Knew Already, which does eventually end up out in the open) and the season ends with Castle's proposal. Season six has them working together as an engaged couple planning their wedding, which is set to happen at the end of season six... but things go awry when Castle vanishes on the way to the wedding. However, he turns up in the season seven premiere, and they eventually wed early in the season ("The Time of Our Lives") to become a crime fighting husband and wife team.
-   In Season 3's "Chuck Versus the Other Guy", Chuck and Sarah dropped the Will They or Won't They? pretenses and got their relationship upgrade by episode's end.

    -   _Daredevil (2015)_:
        -   Matt Murdock and Karen Page have an instant attraction to each other. By season 2, it's been six months since Fisk has been locked up, giving them more time to explore their feelings for each other, with Matt willing to let Karen guide him to sink the 8-ball during an after-work round of pool at Josie's. By "Penny and Dime", the two are flirting whenever they're alone or Foggy has just stepped away from them to handle something else. Their way of celebrating Frank Castle's capture, after a round of drinks at Josie's, is to share a passionate kiss in the rain. They are temporarily driven apart in the second half of season 2 by Matt's nighttime activities and Karen finding Elektra in Matt's bed, but in the season 2 finale, Matt privately meets with Karen to disclose his secret, with a hint that they'll reconcile. They're slowly on the rebound in _The Defenders (2017)_, though things take a step back after Matt is seemingly killed defeating the Hand underneath Midland Circle.
        -   Wilson Fisk and Vanessa Marianna get one after James Wesley takes the initiative and reaches out to Vanessa to calm Fisk down after he's intimidated by Madame Gao. Vanessa's calming influence give Fisk a new dose of confidence and inspires him to go public, delivering a speech on live TV in which he paints himself as a savior and paints the Devil of Hell's Kitchen as a terrorist. It also alienates Fisk from his own associates, who think that Vanessa is turning him into a softie, to the point that Madame Gao and Leland Owlsley try to have her killed.
    -   _Iron Fist (2017)_: Danny Rand and Colleen Wing have a lot of clear tension from the moment they first meet. They eventually realize their feelings and become lovers halfway through the first season.
-   _Dollhouse_:
    -   Topher and Bennett, just before Saunders shoots Bennett in the head.
    -   And Echo and Paul, just before Alpha makes him brain-dead.
-   Crichton and Aeryn had one _hell_ of a rocky road to travel on _Farscape_. They hook up fairly early in the series on a one-night stand in the first season ("A Human Reaction"), but not only do they never talk about it in the episode (Crichton starts to, but Aeryn shuts him down), they don't even acknowledge they actually slept together until the season 2 premiere. Although season 1 had some other Ship Tease moments (such as when stranded in "The Flax," and their farewell in the season finale before Crichton's Suicide Mission, one take of which involved an unscripted kiss) the UST doesn't start building particularly heavily until season 2, particularly the "Look at the Princess" trilogy. They confess their feelings for one another in the season 2 finale, unfortunately, it turns out Crichton is being mind-controlled by Scorpius's neural clone at the time. Due to various complications, it takes until mid-season 3 for Crichton and Aeryn to _finally_ become an Official Couple. Unfortunately, it's after Crichton has been "twinned," and the Crichton Aeryn hooks up with dies in a Heroic Sacrifice by the end of the season. Season 4 reverses their relationship, with Aeryn doing the pursuing and Crichton avoiding her, with Noranti's help, and it's not until the last half a dozen episodes that they finally get together for real, and Crichton proposes to her at the end series finale (right before the cliffhanger ending in which they get blasted by an alien spaceship, setting up the miniseries). Whew!
-   _Friends_: Ross and Rachel in Season 2.
    -   Monica and Chandler get together in the series 4 finale. It's initially a Friends with Benefits relationship that upgrades further to a full-blown romance that eventually ends up with them Happily Married.
-   Olivia and Peter from _Fringe_. Which was instantly railroaded by AltOlivia switching places with the real Olivia, and an oblivious Peter continuing his relationship with (and _impregnating_) the wrong one. When the real Olivia found out… she didn't take it too well. It's up in the air right now whether the upgrade will hold. It held, or was reinstalled. Then was promptly erased from all time three episodes later. Until Peter somehow wills himself back into existence, they eventually get back together, Olivia announces she's pregnant, and they time skip three years to show Peter and Olivia very much together and raising their daughter Etta. That is, up until the Observers invade and they're separated from Etta and get encased in amber for 20-odd years. Shenanigans ensue involving the plan to defeat the Observers, and Etta dies. Eventually the Timey-Wimey Ball comes into play and the final episode ends with Peter and Olivia still together with Etta (who's back to being three years old and obviously no longer dead.) Phew!
-   _Game of Thrones_: Daario with Daenerys in Season 4. She breaks up with him in the Season 6 finale, however.
-   _Good Omens (2019)_:
    -   At the end of season 2 Crowley _finally_ confesses his love to and kisses Aziraphale.
    -   Crazy enough, the supreme archangel of Heaven Gabriel and the Prince of Hell Beelzebub fall in love, get together, and elope.
-   In _Hannah Montana_ Oliver and Lilly had been friends since kindergarten and now, in high school, are an official couple. However, this is a milder example than others, since the actual moment of upgrade happened off-screen with very little build-up. Needless to say, the shippers of this couple felt rather cheated.
-   Given that _How I Met Your Mother_ is the Romantic Comedy of Sitcoms, this isn't exactly uncommon. Special mention goes to the season one finale where Ted and Robin finally get together after he makes it _rain_ for her. Also notable is "Definitions", which is all about this and how the relationship-averse couple wants to stick to their Friends with Benefits deal, but Lily won't let them. Although, as Ted points out, they had their Relationship Upgrade months ago (in the previous season finale). They just never defined it.
-   In the middle of the final season of _I Dream of Jeannie_, Major Nelson finally drops the Idiot Ball and confesses his feelings for and to Jeannie.
-   _Interview with the Vampire (2022)_: In "In Throes of Increasing Wonder...", Louis de Pointe du Lac and Lestat de Lioncourt were close friends for a few months before they made love. However, they don't become an Official Couple until Louis agrees to be Lestat's immortal companion, which results in Louis being transformed into a vampire.
-   Robbie Lewis and Dr. Laura Hobson in _Lewis_ as of Season 7 "Ramblin' Boy"
-   _Lost Girl_ has several.
    -   Bo and Dyson go from strangers to friends with benefits to lovers in season 1.
    -   Bo and Lauren go from friends to lovers in season 3.
    -   Kenzi and Hale begin a relationship in season four after three years of friendship mixed with a healthy dose of attraction.
-   Jane and Lisbon in _The Mentalist_ after several seasons of unresolved sexual tension and a lot of fan shipping. Of course, Jane's past come to play as at least one of the reasons of why he was reluctant to explore those feelings.
-   _Mimpi Metropolitan_: Bambang and Melani agree to go on a relationship in epiosde 48.
-   Harry and Christine in _Night Court_. A bit of a subversion in that they don't date for very long before deciding they work Better as Friends.
-   Jim and Pam on _The Office (US)_ got a Relationship Upgrade between seasons three and four, and then another one later on.
-   _Scrubs_ dabbled with this repeatedly in the relationship between JD and Elliot. At one stage they even became no-strings-attached "sex buddies", which JD says is the best thing a man can hear from a female friend. They receive their true Relationship Upgrade into Official Couple during the final (well technically there's another season, but in truth it's really more of a spin off setting/content-wise) season, one that is clean and without any drama mucking it up (aside from one bit of drama that arbitrarily arises during the two-part episode).
-   In the final episode of the first series of _Torchwood_, Captain Jack Harkness and Ianto finally (and very dramatically) kiss in front of the team—not quite a Last-Minute Hookup but almost.
    -   Played With throughout season 2 with Toshiko and Owen: all of their relationship development takes place after Owen becomes undead, and Owen absolutely does not care what happens anymore. They share a mid-battle kiss, have that date that Tosh wanted all along, dance quite romantically at a wedding, and eventually say a tearful goodbye. They both realise how thoroughly dysfunctional it is and that they're both just going through the motions and waiting for the end.
-   _Sesame Street_: Maria and Luis were Just Friends and co-workers for years, but when Sonia Manzano (Maria's actress\] became pregnant and it was decided to write her pregnancy into the show, the two fell in love, were wed in a landmark episode, and have been Happily Married ever since.
-   _Schitt's Creek_:
    -   After a series of starts and stops, Alexis thinks she must move on from Ted, but he surprises her at a Singles Week event and kisses her in front of a cheering crowd.
    -   Although they are dating and run a business together, David is shown as unclear what to introduce Patrick as when they encounter Jake. This dramatically changes after Patrick and Stevie spend a day pushing David's aesthetic Berserk Button in an effort to get him to compromise. David finally admits to being unable to do so, but he also calls Patrick his boyfriend.
        
        **David:** These mountaineering shoes that my boyfriend is wearing looking like Oprah on a Thanksgiving Day hike, incorrect.  
        **Patrick:** I'm sorry what did you just say?  
        **David:** I said the breath mints need to move.  
        **Patrick:** I think it was something about your boyfriend's shoes.  
        \* _The Wilds_: Toni and Shelby in episode 10 become a couple. They date in the second season, and although they keep it secret first the rest soon learn.
        
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_: Odo and Kira _finally_ got this late in season six of the show after nearly a _decade_ of UST. Miraculously the show avoids Shipping Bed Death and they're still madly in love in the series finale.
-   _Sonny with a Chance_: Sonny and Chad go on their first date in "Falling For The Falls".
-   On _Spartacus: Blood and Sand_, the path to Relationship Upgrade is often fraught with Official Couple Ordeal Syndrome.
    -   Crixus and Naevia probably have it the worst. He's a slave gladiator, she's a house slave being kept as a virgin to preserve her market value. They're Star-Crossed Lovers. Or as much as they can be given that he is kept locked in a cage at night. Then they are forcibly separated and a good chunk of _Vengeance_ revolves around finding Naevia, and then reconnecting her with Crixus.
    -   Agron and Nasir have a rather less melodramatic version. There was an early kill-him-or-kiss-him dynamic however. Although a near-death experience is involved, they hook up fairly quickly and easily in comparison.
    -   Spartacus and Mira never make it.
-   It's not really clear whether the scene at the end of the second season of _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_ with John and Cameron in bed together is supposed to be this or the _opposite_, with John realizing how much of a machine she really is and understanding the sexual tension between them isn't real.
    -   Since he commits a Heroic Sacrifice and dives into the future to get her chip back, it seems pretty confirmed he doesn't think of her as a machine.
-   _The X-Files_: Mulder & Scully are a weird example; they spent five seasons as Platonic Life-Partners, then had an Almost Kiss in the first movie, and the UST became more and more overt in season 6. For the last few seasons of the show it's hinted increasingly strongly that they're already together, and in the second movie it's finally made explicit. It's not clear when the Relationship Upgrade took place, though. (The leading candidate is season 7's "all things," which features Scully evaluating her past choices about life and relationships, leading up to a scene where she's getting dressed in Mulder's bathroom while he's asleep in bed, apparently naked. This episode also occurred at about the right time before Scully's pregnancy was discovered/revealed in the season-ending episode "Requiem".)
-   On leg 8 of Season 17, Chad proposed to Stephanie in Oman while they were waiting for their departure time to continue their leg. Their title was subsequently upgraded from "Newly Dating" to "Engaged".
-   Happens for Josh and Donna midway through the seventh season of _The West Wing_. They share a in-the-heat-of-the-moment kiss after getting unexpectedly good polling numbers and consummate their relationship on Election Day shortly thereafter.

    Music 

-   Deconstructed in the Barenaked Ladies song "Conventioneers." The first three verses describe a man having a romantic passionate evening with a woman he's had a crush on for a long time, musing about how he wants to marry and grow old with her the whole time. Immediately after they have sex, he decides that it wasn't worth it and leaves while she's sleeping, secretly hoping that they never see each other again (which is really awkward, as it's revealed that they're co-workers).

    Video Games 

-   This is essentially the point of all Dating Sims and most Visual Novels.
-   Shaun and Rebecca get a massive upgrade from Friends with Benefits to _married_ in _Assassin's Creed: Valhalla_, although it's very likely the two had begun dating somewhere between _Unity_ and _Origins_ and the player was left unaware.
-   Played with in _Tales of Legendia_. Senel and Shirley had a 'bread winner and homemaker' set up pre-main story but at the time they were pretending to be siblings. At the end of the Main Narrative they accidentally enact the ferines engagement ritual and the local deity approved but at the start of Side Story they still feel like siblings.
-   In the _Mass Effect_ series, Tali and Garrus have forged a strong bond with Commander Shepard due to the events in the first game to the point where they both trust him/her unconditionally. Depending on both Shepard's gender and choices, the relationship he/she has with these two characters can turn into a romantic one.
    
    -   In the third game, it's possible to start an entirely new romance with any of the first game's love interests. This includes a male Shepard and Kaidan (though not Femshep and Ashley).
    
    "It does. It does feel right. After all this time. You and me."
    
    -   The third game also had a moment: if neither Tali nor Garrus was romanced and both survived the suicide mission in ME2, you can walk in on them hugging. Their embarrassed attempts at making up an excuse (she asked him to check her helmet for a rupture) to Shepard are both hilarious and heartwarming.
        
        **Garrus:** Guess it helps to have something to come back to.  
        **Tali:** What do you mean, 'something to come back to'? _(in a flirty tone)_ This is just a fling, Vakarian; I'm using you for your body...!  
        **Garrus:** You're so mean... _and I'm okay with that._
        
-   In _Final Fantasy VII_, Cloud and Tifa's night under the Highwind, according to Word of God.
-   In the _Harvest Moon_ series, this is an important, but usually optional part of the game. However, in _Rune Factory 2_, missing a Relationship Upgrade means you miss 2/3 of the game.
-   In the later _Persona_ games, reaching a certain rank in your social link with a girl (or boy, if you're playing _Persona 3 Portable_) will give you the option to pursue a closer relationship. This can happen with every girl you Social Link with, and if you're already dating one, there's no reason why you can't date more <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Notoriously, completing a romanceable girl's Social Link (and thus unlocking more Personas) in the original versions of _Persona 3_ actually _required_ you to accept a Relationship Upgrade; later games made it possible to complete all S-Links while still remaining genuinely faithful to one girl/boy.
    -   This maybe happens at the end of the original _Persona_; "Ideal" Maki kisses the protagonist right before they leave each other, and when the cast reunites in the final scene, the protagonist and "real" Maki show up together.
-   In the 2018 _Spider-Man_ video game, Peter and Mary Jane reconcile their relationship at the end of the game, which continues into the DLC's after the main story.
-   _To the Moon_ had a healthy dose of Ship Tease between Neil and Eva since the first game, but this trope finally happens in a comic follow-up to the third game, _Impostor Factory_.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Amnesia: Memories_ plays with this trope by having the heroine already having performed a relationship upgrade with the respective boyfriend on the routes, especially when it comes to Shin and Toma, as they were childhood friends with the heroine. _Amnesia: Later_ involves performing the next relationship upgrade to becoming engaged, and _Amnesia: Crowd_ performs the next step to marriage.
-   Downplayed in _Daughter for Dessert_. The closest thing to a moment is when the protagonist announces his choice of a girlfriend to his whole staff. However, the choice is in the making for a long time before that.
-   _Double Homework_:
    -   The moment when the protagonist needs to choose between Johanna and Tamara and a girl from his class. Afterwards, he and whichever girl(s) he chooses will officially be an item.
    -   A subverted example can appear with Lauren, who will only go all the way with the protagonist if he will agree to be boyfriend and girlfriend, but that doesn’t preclude him from dating other girls as well.
-   After the title character of _Melody_ moves in with the protagonist (on her romantic path), her relationship status on the information screen changes from “Single” to “In a relationship.”
-   The _Mystic Messenger_ Christmas DLC features one for the main character and Jaehee... sort of. In the original game, Jaehee's route is extremely ambiguous: she repeatedly talks about their great friendship, at one point saying at the end that while romance between a man and a woman is powerful that the friendship between two women is also powerful, but also does many things that indicate romantic feelings, such as when she says near the end that she's so thankful to have met the main character and that she's slowly beginning to understand how she feels about her. In the Christmas DLC, however, romantic feelings are stated outright: in an option reading '(Go to her and tell her your feelings),' the blushing MC kisses Jaehee's cheek while she's asleep and has the option to say 'One day... I'm going to tell you how I truly feel...' After this, Jaehee says in a chat 'Perhaps... I've developed feelings over you without knowing.' But though their feelings are each confirmed to the audience, neither hears on-screen of the others' feelings. _But_, as Jaehee confessed in a public chat, it can be assumed that the main character would read it later and, presumably, they would get together. So while the actual coupling doesn't happen on-screen, the text finally confirms that they do feel that way and that it _will_ happen.

    Webcomics
