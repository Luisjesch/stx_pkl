When a character, most often The Dragon, The Renfield or Sycophantic Servant, breaks the Big Bad out of an imprisoning entity. This is most commonly done either in the form of freeing the Big Bad from a Tailor-Made Prison, or breaking out a Sealed Evil in a Can. Sometimes, this will be part of an Evil Plan thought out by the Big Bad.

Generally, one of three possible outcomes occurs:

1.  The person or thing being broken out is fully cognizant and quickly gets back on their feet, barking out orders as though nothing happened.
2.  The person or thing being broken out is heavily tired by their long captivity, and must be minded by their liberator. Perhaps his mental faculties are in order, but his body is not, perhaps the opposite. Regardless, it will normally take anywhere from a few days to a few years to recover. Rarely, this state can be permanent.
3.  The liberation backfires, and the entity kills, enslaves, or otherwise harms its allies. Often a consequence of unleashing the Sealed Evil in a Can (because Evil Is Not a Toy), and may lead to an Oh, Crap! or My God, What Have I Done? moment. Usually the result when being captured and sent to prison was All According to Plan.

For cases where the Big Bad in question was brought Back from the Dead, see Resurrect the Villain. Compare Pet Gets the Keys.

This has no relation to individual video game bosses being set free to fight you, although this does overlap (usually with Final Bosses).

-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V_: The reason Chojiro's two lackeys decide to help Shinji start his riot in underground recycling plant is because Chojiro was moved there after he participated in another prison riot in his previous facility, and subsequently losing the "Friendship" Cup.

    Western Animation 

-   _Wildfire_: Some goblins spent most of an episode trying to release their boss. When he eventually escaped, despite the goblins having been defeated, there was no reason to believe he was any less powerful than before. Fortunately, he was defeated again.

-   An episode of _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ as a variation of this. The episode, _Deception,_ is about Obi Wan, disguised as a wanted bounty hunter, arrested and is sent to the Republic Jurdiciary Central Detention Center. Once there, he tries to befriends an inmate, Moralo Eval, as, and this is where the variation comes into play, he is hired by Count Dooku to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine. Rumors spread and it must've gotten to the Senate, so they brought Obi Wan to the case to stop him. But in this episode, Moralo is the head boss of the episode as he, Obi Wan, and Cad Bane, breaks out. The episode after that, _Friends and Enemies,_ continues to have Moralo as the leading role until Dooku takes role of the head boss in the next two episodes _the Box_ and _Crisis on Naboo._ So really Moralo is the brains of the operation.

### **The person or entity is only partially cognizant:**

-   In the beginning of _Code Geass R2_, the Black Knights fetch Lelouch/Zero. It falls into type 2 because he is amnesiac after the Time Skip.
-   _Dragon Ball_: Still in great shape, but certainly past his prime was Demon King Piccolo. He managed to curbstomp Goku the first time they met, before he got rejuvenated by the Dragon Balls. Also, sort of Type 3 for Pilaf, who, even if he didn't get killed, also got no gratitude from Piccolo and got ditched pretty quickly.

    Literature 

-   In _Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception_, Opal Koboi is broken out of her mental clinic-prison by the Brill Brothers. She is mentally cognizant, but extremely physically weak (even by pixie standards), and it takes several days in a muscle-massager to get her back into shape.

    Western Animation 

-   Occurs to recurring baddie Jammerhead in the _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward_ episode "Enter the Jammerhead", after he had been imprisoned during his last appearance.

-   In one episode of _The Life and Times of Juniper Lee_, Cordoth's daughter tried to undo his banishment. When he was finally brought back, it was revealed he let himself go and was quite overweight.

### **The breakout backfires on the liberators:**

-   Unusual example: In the movie of _Mystery Men_, Captain Amazing arranges for Casanova Frankenstein's release from the jail so he can gain publicity by fighting him. It doesn't go well.
-   The parody and pastiche _Kung Fu Hustle_ does this for laughs, when the Axe Gang has an inept patsy with a knack for picking locks break out the Big Bad from his prison. Throughout the prison, the film sends up horror cliches, including the blood-flooded corridor, before revealing the Big Bad to be an old, unkempt, flabby-looking man. Naturally, it turns out his kung fu is virtually unstoppable and he winds up taking over the Axe Gang.
-   The Clive Barker film _Lord of Illusions_ opens with the Evil Sorcerer Nix being stopped by his closest follower Philip Swan from sacrificing a female child and buried in a magical harness. Nix's cult spends the rest of the film trying to resurrect Nix and succeed at the end. The undead Nix expresses his gratitude to his followers, but then reveals himself to be a sadistic Omnicidal Maniac and promptly kills them all for their blind obedience.

    Literature 

-   In the backstory of _The Wheel of Time_, Lanfear did this accidentally, thinking the Dark One was just an untapped magical power source. When "the Bore" was drilled into his Can, evil and brutal chaos was unleashed on the world. Now that he's been re-sealed, the Forsaken plan to break him out again—this time completely. They (mostly) don't understand that _fully_ breaking him out involves destroying the world itself, and themselves.

When he does come back, he sets up a grand heist at Wayne Enterprises. When getaway is imminent, he tries to kill them for forcing him out of hiatus early.
    
    **Scarface**: When the muscles think they're smarter than the brains, it's time to amputate.
    
-   An episode of _The Batman_ has Black Mask's thugs organizing their boss's liberation from the GCPD. As soon as Black Mask is free, he electrocutes his right-hand man and hands the reins over to a random goon.
    
    **Black Mask**: You, you're my new Number One.
    
-   _Jackie Chan Adventures_: If not for Jackie, Shendu would have probably killed the Dark Hand at the end of Season 1.
-   In an episode of _The Real Ghostbusters_, three ghosts with the attire and personalities of gangsters sneak into the Firehouse in an attempt to spring the "boss-lady" (Spiderlegs, a powerful ghost who was jailed off-camera) but have no idea how to work the Containment Unit. So they decide to grab Slimer and hold him for ransom, which quickly turns into a Pity the Kidnapper story that results in _them_ getting busted. (And worse - for them - contained with their _very_ angry boss.)

### **Examples for which explaining the nature would constitute a spoiler (spoilers unmarked!):**

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Fairy Tail_:
    -   Hades's Evil Plan is to "awaken" Zeref, the Greater-Scope Villain whose true power was allegedly sealed for centuries, making him much weaker than he is said to have been in his prime. This turns out to be a subversion, as Zeref is actually a neutral force with constantly fluctuating power that was never sealed to begin with, but he is so angered by the senseless evil Hades committed along the way that it ends as a Type 3 with Hades's death anyway.
    -   E.N.D., the master of the dark guild Tartaros, is sealed inside the book Zeref created him from, so his guild aims to break him out. Like Zeref, this is a subversion, as the true E.N.D. is actually The Hero, Natsu, and the book simply contains his demonic essence.

    Films 

-   In _Hellboy (2004)_, there's a female Nazi seeking to reincarnate Rasputin. Results in Type 1.
-   In _Revolver (1973)_, an Italian prison official's wife is kidnapped, and the kidnappers demand that a notorious prisoner be released in order for the man to get his wife back.

    Video Games 

-   The villains of the first _Wild ARMs_ game spend most of the first act attempting to unleash the sealed Mother, who will ostensibly lead them in their conquest of the planet. It's a case of Type 3 that's bad enough to the point The Dragon simply allows the heroes to kill Mother before resuming said conquest himself.
-   Both subverted and played straight in _Dragon Age II_. During the _Legacy DLC_, Hawke is forced to release Corypheus, one of the _first_ Darkspawn from an Ancient Grey Warden Prison with the intent of slaying him, in order to prevent a group of Rogue Wardens or Ghoulfied Carta who are vying to break him out _first_. Unfortunately, Corypheus manages to possess a nearby Grey Warden just before Hawke strikes the killing blow and escapes.

### **Parodies:**

    Western Animation 

-   In _Kim Possible_, Dr. Drakken is left in prison for the first half of Season 4, and he's constantly waiting for rescue from his henchmen. On two occasions, other villains show up to liberate his sidekick Shego, but they completely ignore him. In one case, the jailbreaker is Drakken's own cousin, Motor Ed, who takes the time to wave goodbye. When he does get busted out, it's by an alien suffering from mistaken identity.
