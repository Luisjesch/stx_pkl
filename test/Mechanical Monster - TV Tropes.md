The Fun-Sized Mobile Agony and Death Dispenser, order yours today!

_"The master of the Goblin blacksmiths offered to build the king a golden mechanical army. Seventy times seventy soldiers that would never know hunger, and could not be stopped."_

So your Mecha-Mooks aren't cutting it? What's the next logical step up from taking the already impressive stamina, loyalty, and destructive power of a mechanical henchman?

Simply, you go absolutely off the wall with them. Where the mecha-mook will be a dime a thousand, you'll see only a few, or only one, Mechanical Monster. This may be due to limited resources or simply because everyone involved in making it is no longer amongst the living. They are always improbably hard to stop, incredibly persistent, never needs to recharge and always, _always_ terrifying to look at. Very likely to be the big bad's Dragon, and often times much tougher to kill.

While mecha-mooks are often fragile, incompetent, and generally gentle at their jobs, expect the Mechanical Monster to be far less kind to its prey. Slashing, stabbing, soul-stealing to fuel their infernal engines, and loud noises are all par for the course. Lastly, in extreme cases, it may also be much bigger size-wise than a standard mecha-mook, with some even doubling as Humongous Mecha opponents.

Mechanical Abomination is when it goes to Eldritch Abomination levels.

## Examples

    open/close all folders 

    Anime and Manga 

-   _Daitarn 3_: The Megaborgs, although they start out as less-monstrous Meganoids before mutating themselves.
-   _Getter Robo_:
    -   _Shin Getter Robot_ is a rare heroic example, at least in the original manga arcs (its more monsterish aspects get _severely_ toned down in other appearances such as _Super Robot Wars_ or the getter OVAs).
    -   Mechasauruses and Mecha Oni play it straight, though: the former ones are robotic dinosaurs, and the seconds are horned, demonic-looking mechanical beasts.
-   _Kakurenbo_: The "oni", which resemble giant animatronic puppets.
-   _Kotetsu Jeeg_: The Haniwa Phantom Gods, mechanical monsters animated through magic means and resembling mythological creatures or evil spirits.
-   _Mazinger_:
    -   The Monster of the Week Mecha-Mooks in _Mazinger Z_ are called "Kikaijuu", which is made of the words for "machine" and "monster" in Japanese.
    -   Then you have the Mykene War Beasts ("Sentoujuu") in _Great Mazinger_, Mykene soldiers grafted into gigantic mechanical bodies. The're shaped like humanoid warriors, evil spirits, mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes or insects.
    -   The Saucer Beasts and Vega Monsters from _UFO Robo Grendizer_. They are animalistic mechanical monsters resemble flying saucers pre-transformation.
-   _Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans_ has the Hashmal, one of the Mobile Armors responsible for the Calamity War that saw a quarter of humanity decimated. As opposed to the humanoid-shaped piloted Mobile Suits (which were originally built to fight Mobile Armors), Hashmal is a completely autonomous machine with a monstrous appearance designed with only one purpose: to kill all humans. It is accompanied by its own army of insectoid machines known as Plumas that can Zerg Rush any opposition in addition to keeping the Hashmal itself functional. Further adding to its monstrous nature is its name, which is taken from an angel as opposed to the Gundam Frames, which are named after demons. To further emphasize how dangerous it is, the Hashmal also has a beam cannon, a rarity in a series where Kinetic Weapons Are Just Better: while the beam cannon won't necessarily destroy a Mobile Suit thanks to its nanolaminate armor, it's plenty useful for vaporizing humans and destroying cities.
-   _One Piece_: The Pacifistas. These guys are made of an incredibly hard material, making them nigh-invulnerable to typical physical attacks, possess Frickin' Laser Beams in a story that presumably takes place in the 15th century, and share the appearance and physical strength of Bartholomew Kuma, one of the most feared men in the One Piece world. It's said that one of these things is the equivalent of a _battleship_, and it took all of the main characters working together with everything they had to beat a single one pre-Time Skip. Double subverted after said Time Skip. Two Pacifistas fall victim to The Worf Effect to demonstrate how powerful the Straw Hats are now, proving to be absolutely no challenge for them anymore. However, immediately after that, it's been stated that there are far more powerful Pacifista out there now, although they haven't been shown nor has it been stated exactly what's improved over the originals.
-   _Reborn! (2004)_: Gola Mosca. It is powered by the Life Energy of the Ninth Vongola Boss.

    Comic Books 

-   Batman has a robot dinosaur in the Trophy Room of the Batcave, a souvenir of a case called "Dinosaur Island".

-   In _Gotham City Garage_, Lex Luthor has the giant robot Amazo which Kara Gordon, Dick Grayson and Selina Kyle bump into when they break into a Luthor's secret base.
-   In Marvel Comics's toy tie-in comic _The Starriors_, the title characters are about evenly split between semi-humanoid robots and animal and dinosaur-shaped ones. They're all perfectly sentient.
-   _The Transformers (Marvel)_ features the Guardian Units, which are bright yellow, ridiculously huge by Cybertronian standards, and have a distressing tendency to turn against their owners. They are also incredibly over-powered and very strong, to the extent that even one of them is enough to give Optimus Prime trouble. They reappear in _The Transformers: More than Meets the Eye_ when an army of them is sent up against Overlord, who quickly ploughs through them.

    Films — Animation 

-   _9_: The villains fit the bill, being a collection of animal-like robots sent to hunt down and destroy the protagonists, and all of them are appropriately horrific. The Big Bad, the huge, multi-armed artificial brain thing, _definitely_ fits the bill.
-   _Atlantis: The Lost Empire_: The Leviathan is a Magitek version of this, somewhere in the vicinity of a _couple miles long_, capable of staying intact without recharging for thousands of years, immune to direct torpedo hits and equipped with shearing claws and a particle beam-like Breath Weapon. Only one of them still functions by the time the heroes arrive at the gateway to Atlantis — there used to be an entire fleet of them back in Atlantis' heyday that had the ability to fly as well— but it's more than enough to trash their sub and kill over a hundred people.
-   _Dragon Rider_: The villianous metal Dragon-eating monster Nettlebrand.
-   _The Incredibles_ sports the Omnidroid. Developed and controlled by the Big Bad by evolving the design from pitting it against retired superheroes, the robot is extremely intelligent, fast, extremely deadly, and invulnerable to just about anything except weapons made from the robot's own tough metal.
-   One of the Superman Theatrical Cartoons is actually titled "The Mechanical Monsters", featuring a Mad Scientist with a small army of robots that he built to steal for him. They have twisted, ogre-like forms, grasping claws, a stilted range of motion, and eye-mounted flamethrowers.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Death Machine_: The Warbeast is essentially a ten-foot tall, nigh-invulnerable collection of hydraulics, claws, and teeth. Given that its creator was very much a Mad Scientist and its official role would be a "Frontline Morale Destroyer", it's intentional.
-   _Godzilla_: The original Showa-era Mecha-Godzilla was a vicious alien robot built with the intent of first discrediting, and then killing Godzilla. Powerful enough to battle Godzilla and King Caesar at the same time, the robot proved a match for anything that the more heroic kaiju could throw at it.
-   _Hellboy II: The Golden Army_: The title Golden Army. Saved from being simple Mecha-Mooks by their sheer hardiness and a self-repair function.
-   In _Red Sonja_, the bad guys unleash a killing machine in the form of a robotic alligator. It's completely invulnerable to the heroes' weapons, except for the eyes, which they manage to carve out while it's thrashing about.
-   _Runaway_: The small attack "bugs" may be the most realistic examples around: their compact six-legged design was based on real state-of-the-art robotic prototypes of the time. Not as formidable-looking as others on this page, but their Zerg Rush tactics and acid-injectors make up for it.
-   _Star Wars_: The Droideka model of battle droid from the prequel trilogy. These fun bots often give the Jedi a run for their money, and amply earn their in-universe status as The Dreaded.
-   The giant Harvester from _Terminator Salvation_ most definitely counts, as would the semi-humanoid tanks from the earlier _Terminator_ movies.

    Literature 

-   _Fahrenheit 451_: The Mechanical Hound, an assassination tool used by the authorities. It's never described in full, only that it moves too silently for a truck sized machine with eight spider-like legs, and it has a proboscis meant for injecting lethal doses of morphine into its targets. The only reason it can be called a hound at all is because it's a Super-Persistent Predator that tracks through scent.
-   _Forges of Mars_: The Tindalosi are robotic hellhounds designed to be unstoppable killing machines. They’re strong, fast, intelligent, heavily-armed, and can quickly repair any damage they take. When the Big Bad unleashes them to hunt down Kotov, they tear through a squad of Howling Banshees and give the Black Templars some serious trouble.
-   _Star Wars Legends_:
    -   _Galaxy of Fear_: Tash and Zak Arranda are menaced by a simulation of one of these in _The Nightmare Machine_.
    -   _Razor's Edge_:
        -   During the Big Bad Viest's Blood Sport "test," she drops a large barrel-shaped mining droid reprogrammed for rage and insanity into the playing field. Its cutting and digging arms attack the players, killing a Red Shirt and injuring Leia, its "sampling oriface" roars at them, and it more-or-less defeats itself by getting partially caught in an ore crusher.
        -   Later, Leia and the _Aegis_ crewmembers find Viest's technician attempting to repair the droid, and they commandeer it to rampage through the Space Pirates' command center at an opportune moment. This backfires on them when it gets too close to the bomb they had rigged to blow up said command center, setting it off early.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Doctor Who_: The Raston Warrior Robot in "The Five Doctors". Built as the ultimate killing machine, a single one is able to destroy an entire squad of Cyberman without taking a scratch in return.
-   _Kamen Rider_:
    -   _Kamen Rider Drive_ has Advanced Roidmudes, the forms taken by Roidmudes who've successfully evolved through use of a Viral Core, granting them a monstrous form and special powers.
    -   _Kamen Rider Ryuki_ and _Kamen Rider Dragon Knight_ has the vicious Mirror Monsters of the supernatural variety.
-   _Lost_: Not a straight example, but the Smoke Monster mixes mechanical noises (cranking, whirring) in with its biological noises (roaring, growling). Because it has no moving parts (being an amorphous cloud of black vapor), it is not clear where any of these noises are coming from. The most popular Fanon theory is that it generates these noises arbitrarily to frighten people.
-   _The Prisoner (1967)_: If the Smoke Monster counts, then its grandfather Rover deserves a mention too. It's a white floating plastic sphere, and acts as a security device for the Village, but it's also _alive_ somehow; it roars and groans and has a mind of its own, even killing the wrong person once. Rover was originally a straighter robotic example of the trope, but it didn't work very well during the initial stages of filming.
-   A very early example of this trope in live-action television appears in _Spider-Man (Japan)_, where the Monsters of the Week are called the Machine BEMs (Bug-Eyed Monsters).
-   _Super Sentai_: Whenever the enemy group is mechanical in nature, there is a high chance the Monsters of the Week they employ are this trope. Examples are the Machine Beasts of _Chouriki Sentai Ohranger_ (adapted into Machine Empire monsters in _Power Rangers Zeo_), the Barbaric Machine Beasts of _Engine Sentai Go-onger_ (adapted into the Venjix Attack Bots in _Power Rangers RPM_) and the Metaroids of _Tokumei Sentai Go-Busters_ (adapted into the Robotrons in _Power Rangers Beast Morphers_).
-   The _Ultra Series_ have numerous robot-based kaiju terrorizing Earth, for the Ultra-warriors to defeat every once in a while.
    -   _Ultraseven_: King Joe and Crazygon are robotic monsters sent by alien invaders who gives Ultraseven a hard time to defeat in their respective episodes.
    -   _Return of Ultraman_: Builgamo is an Expy of Crazygon who goes on an unstoppable rampage, and Ultraman Jack needs to figure out a way to defeat the monster without killing his allies trapped in the monster's core.
    -   _Ultraman Taro_ concludes his run with the battle against Grand King, the mecha-behemoth monstrosity sent by Juda, who nearly defeats the Ultra Brothers until Ultraman Taro managed to unlock his Golden Super Mode.
    -   _Ultraman Leo_ has Gamelot, originally created by an alien race for peacekeeping purposes, but suddenly decide to turn against it's creators and wipe out it's home planet, before hunting the father and daughter pair of scientists who created it all the way to Earth.
    -   _Ultraman 80_ has Mechagiras and Zatan Silver, sentient robots unleashed by alien invaders, who continues their rampage even after their alien masters are killed.
    -   _Ultraman Tiga_ gets to battle more than one of these, including Ligatron (a spaceship hit by cosmic energy and morphing into a mechanical beat), Guwam (who captures Tiga's ally Reina in it's forehead, giving Tiga a hard time in battle), Faivas (a classic A.I. Is a Crapshoot example) and Geoshark (a completely mechanical Land Shark created by a rogue scientist).
    -   _Ultraman Dyna_: Terranoid from the last arc was originally a mechanical clone of Ultraman Dyna, who ends up being affected by the Sphires and going on an unstoppable rampage.
    -   _Ultraman Gaia_ has a trio of ancient machines, Enzan, Tenkai and Shinryoku, who upon reactivation is dedicated to reset all life on earth, and the mecha Σ-Zuigul who captures Ultraman Gaia's human host Gamu, stripping him from his transformation powers necessitating Ultraman Agul to save him.
    -   _Ultraman Cosmos_ has Hellzking (an Expy based on King Joe listed above), Sidebackter (an Expy based on Gamerot) but there's also Igomas, a non-violent, peaceful toy kaiju which only goes on a rampage due to a malfunction in it's design.
    -   _Ultraman Mebius_ have multiple episode story arc featuring the nigh-unstoppable juggernaut monster, Imperializers, sentient humanoid machines which can absorb plenty of hits from Ultraman Mebius, and even reassemble itself after being blown up. Even with the assistance of Ultraman Taro, it still takes three episodes to finally defeat Imperializer.
    -   _Ultraman Zero Gaiden: Killer the Beatstar_ has it's Big Bad, the titular Beatstar, who commands an entire army of Mecha-monsters, including numerous units of the aforementioned King Joe and Imperializers.
    -   _Ultraman Orb_ introduces Galactron, a mechanical dragon-beast originally used for peacekeeping purposes, but upon gaining sentience, ultimately decides the best course to preserve peace is to wipe out all life in the universe. The following installment, _Ultraman Geed_, would conclude with a revelation that the Galactrons are mass-produced under their master, Gilbaris.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: There are several "constructs" that fit this category, most notably the Hellfire Engine, a Giant Mecha made out of cold iron and powered by (as well as shooting) hellfire and the Anaxim, basically the twisted mechanical abortion produced by a god of the forge getting a little too crazy.
-   _Exalted_ has its fair share of these, such as the Thousand-Forged Dragons and the Brass Leviathan.
-   _Fabula Ultima_: The Razorbird is a large Magitek construct resembling an enormous bird of prey. It has razor-sharp feathers with which to make melee attacks and an arsenal comparable to that of a real-world fighter jet, complete with missiles and gatling guns. Militant empires often make use of these machines in their air forces.
-   _Gamma World_: Whenever you want to tell your players to go screw themselves in your game, you use the Death Machine, the setting's mechanical equivalent to the Tarrasque.
-   _Iron Kingdoms_: Warjacks are large (seven to twelve feet tall) steam-powered robots used to protect and assist the setting's Not-So-Squishy Wizards. 'Jacking is a form of capital punishment in some countries and, if that wasn't bad enough, the _WARMACHINE_ wargame introduced Deathjack, a semi-autonomous Orgoth warjack powered by _souls._
-   _Magic: The Gathering_: Some of the more impressive artifact creatures easily qualify as this rather than the standard Mecha-Mooks of dragon engines and myr. The main villains of the series, the Phyrexians, have the purpose in life of turning all living things in existence into this, and are themselves a collection of nightmarish, twisted biomechanical monstrosities.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   The Dark Eldar Talos is a heavily armored floating mechanical scorpion acting as their version of a tank that grabs people off the battlefield and pulls them inside itself to slowly torture them to death, which powers its systems and weapons with their agony and souls. On the outside it has various torture implements acting as claws to restrain other victims, then torture and kill them to remove their souls. It also has a cannon in the shape of a tail that fires incredibly corrosive bio-acid.
    -   The Necrons have the Tomb Stalker, a giant metal centipede with two guns that fire beams of energy that flay you molecule by molecule. If that wasn't enough, it can become incorporeal in order to pursue its targets _directly through_ the labyrinthine halls of the Necron crypts it guards. It can also sense you coming from literal miles away.
    -   Chaos has a variety of these as well.
        -   Chaos Daemons employ hulking brutes fused to a Spider Tank chassis called Defilers, that have cannons both mechanical and organic in nature. They can also use a form of monstrous Mecha which teleports. As well, Juggernauts are basically half-mechanical half-organic demonic Rhinos. The forces of Khorne additionally have the Lord of Skulls and the Kytan Daemon Engine, the former marrying a humanoid body with a huge tank-like mechanism and the latter being more like a small Titan.
        -   Chaos Space Marines have similar bipedal Mecha monsters that were formerly entirely mechanical. They have mechanical dinosaurs with More Dakka called Forgefiends that are armed with Gatling Good or plasma cannons, or a close combat variety. Last but not least a robotic dragon flyer called Heldrakes that have a gatling cannon or a flamer for a Breath Weapon and adamantium claws which can swoop down and slice tanks in half.
    -   When they were still a legion and had their primarch Lion running around, the Dark Angels had the Ironwing company which specialized in war engines. If things got ugly, sometimes they'd bring out the Excindio-class Battle Automata which are powerful and vicious robots. Being a mechanical monster is a step down for these machines as they were previously part of the Silica Animus that nearly destroyed humanity.

    Theme Parks 

-   Universal Studios' _Horror Make-Up Show_ has "Eddie", a mechanical werewolf that ends up coming to life and going rogue at the end of the show.

    Video Games 

-   The Deimos of _13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim_ certainly fit the description, with them being aggressive kaiju-like robots with a red and black color scheme and glowing red eyes. Strangely enough, they are revealed to be construction equipment. Why they are such Unnecessarily Creepy Robots is anyone's guess.
-   _Agent USA_: The FuzzBomb from used to be a normal television set, until an experiment Gone Horribly Wrong gave it malevolent sentience (with angry eyes!), and it's now trying to turn everyone in the entire United States into mindless, walking TV static.
-   _Banjo-Tooie_ has Weldar, the boss of Grunty Industries, and is an unconventional case. He is a giant killer welding torch who can electrify the floor and perform a wide variety of attacks during battle.
-   _Castlevania: Lords of Shadow_ has a giant robot scorpion Brain in a Jar built by Doctor Frankenstein.

-   _Conker's Bad Fur Day_:
    -   Haybot serves as the first major boss in the game (the wasp army from the Windy chapter is the first overall, but they aren't challenged in a proper battle until much later in the game). Initially disguised as a large sentient pile of haystack, the boss's true form is exposed during the second phase of the fight, deep within the basement of the stable. In this form, it is capable of shooting missiles, squashing opponents with its hands, and crushing them. Its weakness is a self-destruct button located in its back, but it has to be pressed three times so the monster is defeated.
    -   The Big Big Guy is a living orange boiler piloted by a duo of fire imps, and is the second major boss in the game. It can charge at Conker to cause him damage, as well as exhale fire as a flamethrower. Bathing it with fecal debris will stun it, which gives Conker the chance to crush its (literal) Brass Balls with a pair of red bricks. Conker has to do this a total of four times to disable the machine for good and claim victory.
-   _Crysis_: The alien Hunter. It's a house-sized Humongous Mecha with a decidedly inhuman design (looking more like a deep-sea crustacean), bristling with Freeze Rays and Wave Motion Guns. It also has several moving parts on its front, which seem to be there only because they look threatening. Also, it can _roar_.
-   _Cyberpunk 2077_ has the Cerberus MK-II, a maintenance robot built for extreme environments. While it is "only" armed with a terminal jack, it's impervious to conventional weapons, fast enough to outrun sprinting augmented humans and can't be hacked; it's the only enemy that _can't_ be escaped from or killed in the whole game. One controlled by a murderous rogue AI is the last enemy V will encounter at the end of _Phantom Liberty_ should the player betray Songbird.
-   _Descent 3_ has the Homunculus, which looks like a mechanical version of the Rancor from _Return of the Jedi_.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_:
    -   Among the many Dwemer Animunculi you run into in throughout the series, there are always at least one type of these. In _Morrowind_, it's the Steam Centurions. In _Skyrim_ there are Dwemer Centurions. These things are difficult to kill, hit hard, can end your quest in a few blows if you are careless, and their steam jet is a pretty good approximation of dragonbreath. And as if that was bad enough, _Skyrim_ also has the Dwemer Centurion _Masters_. They are twice the size of their lesser brethren, as well as having double the armor and killing power. If **that** wasn't enough for you, try the Forgemaster on for size. This unique Centurion boss is even bigger, hits even harder, and instead of a steam breath is armed with an outright **flamethrower**.
    -   In _Morrowind_'s _Tribunal_ expansion, toward the end of the main quest, you'll be forced to face the Imperfect. The Imperfect is a borderline Humongous Mecha, standing easily twice the size of the Player Character, who serves as a Mini-Boss in Sotha Sil's Clockwork City. It has some of the strongest physical attacks in the game and can also use powerful Lightning attacks against you. If you are able to kill it quickly, you can claim the Elixir of the Imperfect from its corpse. It's a potion that restores 20 points of Health, Magicka, and Fatigue every second for 15 seconds, essentially giving you god-like abilities for the duration. However, you only get one from the Imperfect, and unless you kill it quickly, _it will use the Elixir_, making this fight all the more difficult.
-   Mechanical bosses aren't too frequent in the _Etrian Odyssey_ series, because of the fantasy setting, but they exist:
    -   _Etrian Odyssey_: Though the original game averts the trope, _The Millenium Girl_ remake adds two robotic bosses in the also-added dungeon Gladsheim: The first is Gimle, which is capable of shooting powerful missiles at the player's party even before its boss battle properly begins; and the second is M.I.K.E., which by the point it's found goes haywire and must be destroyed).
    -   _Etrian Odyssey III: The Drowned City_: The Gatekeeper is a black robot that serves as the boss of the Molten Caves, and aims to protect the entrance to the Abyssal Shrine at all costs (it was originally build by the Abyssal King to prevent outsiders from going further). Its attack repertoire is also very varied, including laser beams and missiles, and its individual parts can be separated to attack more efficiently.
    -   _Etrian Odyssey IV: Legends of the Titan_: The Cradle Guardian is the King Mook of the robotic F.O.E. that roam the Echoing Library, and is capable of switching its strengths and weaknesses at will. It's summoned by Prince Baldur, who in that moment is being corrupted by the influence of Yggdrasil, and is kidnapping the Medium to revive the Yggdrasil.
-   _Final Fantasy_: Omega Weapon from is often depicted as this. Other times he's a _bio_\-mechanical monster. The very first _Final Fantasy_ has fellow Superboss in mook clothing Warmech, an extremely durable, regenerating, nuke-tossing monstrosity with a Death Ray.
-   _Halo_: Scarabs are controlled by the same alien worms that compose the Hunters, and have an organic roaring sound.

-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask_ has Goht, whose epithet actually _is_ (Masked) Mechanical Monster. It's an enormous mechanical goat-like monster that constantly runs away, and the only way to make it stop after waking it up is to destroy it.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker_ has a non-malicious example with Gohdan, an ancient machine created by the gods to challenge the new hero before their access to the biggest secret of the Great Sea.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_: The Guardians and the Divine Beasts. The Guardians are massive Spider Tank machines capable of firing extremely strong lasers, while the Divine Beasts are four Humongous Mecha shaped like animals. While the Guardians and the Divine Beasts had been built to protect Hyrule, all of them were literally Hijacked by Ganon 100 years before the game takes place, and have since been a very high threat for the lives of everybody living in Hyrule.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom_: Unlike the standard Soldier Contructs which act as standard Mecha-Mooks, or even the stronger Training Construct minibosses, the Flux Constructs are boss-level threats and _far_ more dangerous due to their increased strength and attack repertoire, as well as their ability to rearrange their cubical body parts to showcase and exploit various forms. Defeating them requires exposing their weak point and disarming it from the boss so they can inflict damage to it.
-   _Mass Effect_: Reapers go a bit beyond this into Mechanical Abomination, but they'd have to count the few times you fight one on foot — most notably Priority: Rannoch, which famously involves syncing up a target pointer to the biggest fleet in the galaxy and having them rain Thanix projectiles on its weak point. It takes one hell of a pounding to down it, and it's the _smallest_ type of Reaper — a mere 160 meters tall<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , unlike its two-kilometer long siblings.
-   _Mega Man (Classic)_, being a robot-based series, has its share of these, mostly as Wily Fortress bosses, most notably The Yellow Devil and all the other Devil series robots.
-   _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_: The Gekko are as much life-form as machine; they're about as smart as an animal, make appropriate sounds when they're in distress, and, of course, have organic legs. They also follow the basic use of the Mechanical Monster trope in that they are much more dangerous and intimidating than a simple robot would be.
-   _Metal Slug 2/X_: Most players wouldn't know what the second boss (Aeshi Nero) is when they first see it. It's a gigantic excavator robot designed to look like a cobra.
-   Despite its futuristic setting, the _Metroid_ series has a bigger focus on large monsters instead of large machines when it comes to bosses and antagonists. However, some cases still exist:
    -   _Metroid Prime 2: Echoes_: Quadraxis, the King Mook of the Quads, is a gigantic quadrupedal automaton that serves as the boss of Ing Hive (the Dark World version of Sanctuary Fortress); it was originally a benign creation by the Luminoth, until the Ing corrupted it with the power of Dark Aether. There's also the Caretaker Class Drone, a Mini-Boss found earlier in Sanctuary Fortress itself, at the start of a path leading to the Screw Attack.
    -   _Metroid Prime 3: Corruption_: The Defense Drone is a big robot built by the Chozo many decades ago that protects the Boost Ball powerup in Skytown, Elysia. Due to Phazon corruption, it's now hostile and proceeds to attack Samus as soon as she attempts to grab the Boost Ball powerup. Despite its large size, it is capable of performing impressive jumps.
    -   _Metroid: Samus Returns_: The Diggernaut is a large drilling machine built by the Chozo in SR388. Initially, it is located in Area 3, but Samus witnesses its activation before it moves away; it later tries to kill Samus in a frantic chase in Area 4. Finally, it confronts Samus in a boss battle in Area 6.
    -   _Metroid Dread_: The E.M.M.I. are a mix of this trope and Xenomorph Xerox. They were originally research drones sent by the Galactic Federation to investigate Planet ZDR over rumors of surviving X Parasites, only to then lose contact and be reprogrammed to hunt Samus down and extract her Metroid DNA for Raven Beak's use. Unfortunately for Samus, they are invulnerable to all of her standard arsenal (and the only weapon that can destroy them deactivates after being used on each one), are incredibly mobile, have really sharp hearing, are highly intelligent, and many of the later ones have abilities that make them even more dangerous. If they catch up to Samus and she fails to counter their attacks (which is _very_ likely, since the timing for the counter is really tight), it's a Non Standard Game Over.
-   _Mini Robot Wars_: The Frost Orca is a large, whale-submarine bot that spits out deadly ice balls, has a _ton_ of health, is more tenacious than the regular mooks, and acts as a Boss in Mook Clothing. It also practices good dental hygiene.
-   _Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask_ has a large robot (only known as "mechamutt", due to its dog-like face) fought in the last regular level of the Toy Robot minigame. Unlike the smaller, weaker dog robots that appear in the other levels, the Mechamutt is large, strong and capable of moving around while covering a wide area, thus being a lot more dangerous. The main character (a small toy robot built by Emmy) has to use a windup key to ram at the monster and damage it (the process has to be done twice to defeat it).
-   In _Puella Magi Madoka Magica Portable_, the witch Gisela is a Transforming Mecha made of motorcycle parts that can cloak itself in a whirlwind.

-   _Quake IV_: The Harvester Spider Tanks seem to be partially organic like the aforementioned Scarabs, by the sounds they make. They're easily the most threatening Strogg faced by Kane, being a Mini-Boss when on a vehicle and when on foot, an obstacle to be evaded instead of an enemy to be fought.
-   _Shantae and the Pirate's Curse_ has the Steel Maggot (Patent Pending), a giant, robotic maggot that serves as the boss of the Abandoned Factory.
-   _Sim City 4_: The Autosaurus Wrecks is basically a _T. rex_ (or perhaps Godzilla) made of cars, which when summoned rampages around wrecking everything it finds.

-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   _Super Mario Bros. 2_: Robirdo serves as the boss of World 3 in the Game Boy Advance version (in the original version, the boss is Mouser, who also appeared at the end of World 1; the Mouser rematch is pushed to World 6 in _Advance_). Robirdo is a large, robotic dinosaur who spits eggs like normal Birdos do, but these are much bigger. It is also capable of charging at the player's character as well as performing a Ground Pound that shakes the floor.
    -   _Super Mario 64_: King Bob-Omb serves as the King Mook of Bob-Ombs (themselves being Mecha-Mooks), and attacks Mario by grabbing him to throw him; that's the same thing Mario has to do to him (three times) to win. In the Nintendo DS remake, if it's Yoshi who challenges him, then King Bob-Omb will attack by throwing smaller Bob-Ombs instead, since Yoshi cannot grab anything and instead has to throw the Bob-Ombs back at the boss by using his mouth. Bob-Omb went on to return in several _Mario_ spin-offs since then.
    -   _Super Mario Sunshine_: Mecha-Bowser is a large robot modeled after the Koopa King. It is piloted by Shadow Mario a.k.a. Bowser Jr., and serves as the boss of Pinna Park; it can breathe fire and shoot missiles, forcing Mario to dispel any incoming projectile with the help of FLUDD.
    -   _Super Mario Galaxy_: There's a different version of Mecha-Bowser located in Toy Time Galaxy, and in it some Gearmos are kept captive, forcing Mario to disassemble it to rescue them. There's also Megaleg, a gargantuan robot modeled after the Snifits (a subspecies of Shy Guys) which Mario has to destroy in order to claim the Grand Star it has in its top.
    -   _Super Mario Galaxy 2_: The Megahammer is an enormous robot whose arms are shaped like hammers; Bowser Jr. challenges Mario with it in a battle for the Grand Star of World 3, and obviously loses. There's also Digga-Leg, a smaller version of Megaleg fought in Spin-Dig Galaxy which only guards a regular Power Star.
    -   _Super Mario Odyssey_: Mechawiggler is a large robotic specimen of Wiggler which is terrorizing New Donk City and its people, and is capable of attacking with energy spheres as well as warping from one spot to another with portals.
-   The boss Fernus from _Teslagrad_ is a mechanical dragon (it looks a lot like the Truckasaurus, actually) that lairs in the bottom of the Tower. It has the requisite fire breath, and has magnetic powers.

-   _Xenoblade Chronicles_:
    -   _Xenoblade Chronicles 1_: The Mechon are all walking machines of death and mayhem, but they couldn't be called monsters, at least not individually. The faced Mechon, however, are the ones who could be called monsters, but they aren't really machines.
    -   _Xenoblade Chronicles X_ has various large, mechanoid Tyrants across the continent of Cauldros. Among them is Leva'el the Terminus, a Superboss that only appears in the Playable Epilogue.

    Webcomics 

-   _Girl Genius_ has a lot, including a great many built by the Heterodyne family. When the Mechanical Monsters are not available, the Heterodynes fall back on their good old-fashioned biological monsters.
-   In _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_, Molly builds one, seemingly just for fun.

    Web Original 

-   In _Mortasheen_, the genocidal villain civilization of Wreathe has nine of these called Celestial Engines, all of them named and themed after planets, as well as the model for all Wreathe's Mecha-Mooks.

    Western Animation 

-   _Challenge of the GoBots_: The Renegades use Mechanical Monsters called Zods. Cy-Kill's Evil Plan in the Five-Episode Pilot is to obtain the means to build an entire army of the suckers; he succeeds, but they all get blown up by a Chekhov's Bomb introduced earlier. The Renegades continue to use Zods after this, but more sparingly. They also have one called Scales, who can transform into a racecar, but he only appears rarely.
-   _Samurai Jack_, due to the nature of the setting and the former rating, has a lot of those. The fused assassin droids in _Samurai vs Samurai_ really stand out in that regard.
-   _Star Wars: Droids_ features one of these in the form of the villainous Great Heep, which eats other droids to refuel and maintains a droid harem. Later on, he is revealed as a member of the Abominor, an entire species of these creatures from outside the main galaxy. They were at war with the Silentium (who are made up of Alien Geometries), which is implied to be the reason for the Yuzhaan Vong leaving that galaxy.
-   _Transformers_ has several, including the Terrorcon combiner team, the Monsterbots, the Fuzors and Trypticon.
    -   The draconic Predacons of _Transformers: Prime_ are particularly intimidating in appearance, and possess strength and durability that most normal Autobots and Decepticons couldn't dream of matching. Like Cy-Kill above, Megatron planned to mass-produce his beasts, but he scrapped this plan immediately upon finding out that the Predacons were not the simple creatures he had initially thought them to be.
    -   The 2015 _Robots in Disguise_ cartoon has nearly all its Decepticons sport beastly robot modes that evoke this. The main antagonist, Steeljaw, resembles a large robot werewolf.

    Real Life 

-   _TRUCKASAURUS!_ A pseud-dinosauroid monster made out of car parts.<small>◊</small>
