_"You get used to it. I don't even see the code. All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead..."_

The hair equivalent to vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry (dessert flavors) or yellow, blue, and red (primary colors) or ketchup, mustard, and relish (condiments) or gold, silver, bronze (metals). The trope is strictly for visual appeal; they are not personality types.

Sometimes, they're heroes. Sometimes, they're friends. Sometimes, they're contenders, fighting for the same love interest. Whatever the details, they're proof that Central Casting does count: three women, three natural hair colors. Collect the full set. This trope was inspired — or at least made popular — by The Andrews Sisters, a Girl Group from the 1940s who were famous for entertaining US army forces during World War II. Their diversity of hair colors—all natural—was probably due to their partial Norwegian-Greek ancestry, an interesting mixed race in those days.

Strictly speaking, these women need not have the exact Clairol hues of blonde, brown/black, and red, particularly when stepping away from the natural spectrum. The blonde will have the lightest hair, the brunette the darkest, and the redhead will have a distinct moderate shade — all for instant sight recognition.

Note: Although this is stereotypically a female trope, male (or mixed-gender) examples also count. However, in such cases, the masculinized spellings "blond" and "brunet" are applicable instead of "blonde" and "brunette".

-   Heineken: An advert had a Blonde, Brunette and Redhead sitting in a drinking establishment, along with a trio of priest, minister and rabbi; and a man with a duck under his arm. The claim was that the beer was "the real reason they all walked into a bar." The Blonde doesn't get it.
    -   Another ad for Heineken (maybe; definitely a very green-tinted commercial) had a fembot that not only dispensed beer but also had two other fembots inside of her, the "original" being blonde and the two "copies" being a brunette and a redhead.
-   Nutrisse Garnier: Commercials in the United Kingdom feature Davina McCall (brunette), Holly Willoughby (blonde) and Angela Scanlon (redhead).

    Coppertop, carrot head, simply red, it’s your time to shine.  
    Towhead, lemon drop, corn crop, it’s your time to shine.  
    Brown bombshell, raven hair, chocolate eclair, it’s your time to shine.
    
-   Rice Krispies: The mascots for the cereal: Snap (redhead), Crackle (blond), and Pop (brunet). The original color iterations of Snap and Crackle had their hair colors swapped, before the change was implemented.
-   Koleston ran a 2008 campaign called "Change," in the form of a billboard atop a west-facing cliff, with the silhouette of a woman's facial features and hair carved out, so that she became a blonde when the sun was low in the sky and directly behind her, a redhead at sunset, and finally a brunette after sunset when the sky was dark (at which point the sign was illuminated white to contrast with the darkness in her hair).

    Comic Strips 

-   The three main characters in long-running soap comic _Apartment 3-G_. While blonde Lu Ann plays to the stereotype, redhead Tommie and brunette Margo seem to have swapped theirs.
-   Luann (straight-haired blonde), Bernice (curly/frizzy-haired light-brown brunette) and Delta (short black-haired token minority).
-   Sally Forth's daughter, Hilary (brainy blonde) and her two friends: Faye (troubled brunette) and Nona (ditzy redhead).
-   The classic _Flash Gordon_ newspaper serial comic has had several major female leads, so it's not surprising that this trope would eventually come into play. In the "golden age" of the strip, as drawn by creator Alex Raymond, the women who best fit the trope are Flash's requisite Love Interest Dale Arden (who has black hair), Queen Fria of Frigia (a blonde) and Queen Desira of Tropica (a redhead). There's also Queen Undina of Coralia, who has long dark tresses similar to Dale's. (In case you haven't figured it out yet, the planet Mongo has a lot of royalty.) Princess Aura is a bit harder to pin down, as she started out with red hair (plus yellow skin and pointy ears), but later underwent Art Evolution and became a blonde with Caucasian features, right around the same time she rebelled against her father's evil regime and joined Flash's band of good guys. (And while we're on the subject of hair, Fria's hair buns were copied rather shamelessly by George Lucas for Princess Leia's hairstyle in _Star Wars_.)
-   _Rip Haywire_: Rip's various love interests — veterinarian Fawn Forrester (blonde), Rip's mercenary on-again/off-again girlfriend Cobra Carson (brunette) and helicopter pilot Breezy Easy (redhead).
-   _Big Nate_:
    -   The three Wrights: Nate himself is a brunet, Ellen is a blonde, and Marty was a redhead before he went bald. The personalities don't match however. Nate is fiery, Ellen is smart, and Marty is dumb.
    -   Nate's three friends too. Francis is a light brunet, Teddy is the Token Minority, and Chad is a redhead. Again, Francis is smart and Teddy is fiery. However, Chad isn't dumb - just a little too friendly for his own good.

    Fan Works 

-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ fanfic _Gankona, Unnachgiebig, Unità_: Germany is the blond, Japan is the brunet (his hair is actually black though) while Italy is the redhead (though it's closer to brown, but with a reddish tinge in the light).
-   A _Kim Possible_ fan artist drew a pic featuring Tara (blonde), Bonnie (brunette), and Kim (redhead) in a photo shoot in a remote jungle...wearing bikinis. As a Shout-Out, they also did the famous _Charlie's Angels_ pose. The pic can be found here.
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_: England is blond, and when fans create OCs representing his siblings, they'll usually do this trope. The directions vary. Some follow the basic stereotype, with Wales a brunet and Scotland a redhead. However, it's just as common to make Wales a blond, for the gag of him getting mistaken/interchanged with England a la America and Canada. In this case, the three major Celtic countries will usually form this trio, most often when Scotland is a brunet because the fan wants to reserve the red hair for the Irelands, or when they make Ireland a brunet/te (both male and female Ireland have been considered by the author) and keep Scotland a redhead if they prefer the slight statistical differences over stereotypes.
-   _The Night Unfurls_:
    -   The six Bloodborne-centric characters have two trios that follow this pattern:

-   The triad necessarily recurs with lead characters in the _Discworld_ of A.A. Pessimal: members of the red-haired Smith-Rhodes family tend to team up with blonde and brunette/black-haired working partners.

-   _Batman Returns_: There are three female criminals in the Penguin's gang. The Poodle Lady is light blonde, the Snake Woman has fiery red/orange hair, and the Knifethrower Dame never shows her hair but dresses like a Native American, so it's easy to imagine the hair being black.

-   _Scooby-Doo (2002)_: In the film, the addition of Mary Jane, played by Isla Fisher, a blond, and of course, Velma (Brunette) and Daphne (Redhead). They do fulfill the traditional roles somewhat - Mary Jane is a little spacey (though more innocent than actually stupid), Velma is the brains and Daphne is really sassy in this version.

-   In Charles Ogden's _Edgar & Ellen_, Stephanie is the redhead, Cassidy is the blonde and Pepper is the brunette.
-   Opal, Jade and Amber respectively play this trope straight in _The Prophecy of the Stones_. The three of them are known as "the Stones" of the prophecy (referring to their namesake magic stones).
-   In the _H.I.V.E. Series_, Shelby, Lucy, and Laura fill these roles respectively.
-   In Robert A. Heinlein's _Stranger in a Strange Land_, Jubal Harshaw's secretaries are Anne (blonde), Dorcas (brunette) and Miriam (redhead). Jubal mentions many times that this is exactly the way he wants it. Whenever one of his secretaries leaves his service, he will only hire a replacement with her hair color to keep things evened out.
-   Older Than Steam: Madame d'Aulnoy's Fairy Tale _Princess Belle-Etoile_ features a queen with three daughters. Exaggerated in that they are _named after their hair colors_. The oldest is a redhead named Roussette, the middle is a brunette whose very name is Brunette, and the youngest is a blonde named Blondine. Blondine is the mother of the title character.
-   From _Samhain Island_ there are the St. Charles's siblings; Hannah is a platinum blonde, René is a brunet, and Zac has dark red hair.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   Taken together, the Golden and Silver Trios form a male and female set of these. True to stereotype, Hermione's a Brainy Brunette, Ginny's a Fiery Redhead, and while Luna certainly isn't dumb, she's definitely a little spacey. For the guys, we have black-haired Harry, redheaded Ron, and Neville, who is blond according to Word of God (though he has dark hair in the movies).
    -   In the films the main trio is bumped up to this as Emma Watson's hair becomes blonde from the fifth film onwards - making her the Brainy Blonde, Harry the Fiery Brunet and Ron the Dumb Redhead.

    -   In the films, the secondary trio also fits the bill with Neville (brunet), Ginny (redhead) and Luna (blonde).
    -   The Fanon grouping of Albus Potter (brunet), Rose Weasley (redhead) and Scorpius Malfoy (blonde) counts also. (Note that Rose's hair color is never stated in the book, though her father is a redhead.)
-   From the novelization of _Iron Man_: "One was a blonde, the other a brunette. Stark glanced around, hoping that he could find a worthwhile redhead in order to complete the set..."
-   _I've Got You Under My Skin_: This applies to the four graduates suspected of murder, helping to make them as distinct visually as they are in personality and potential motive for murder: Claire Bonner has ash-blonde hair, Regina Callari has midnight-black hair, Alison Schaeffer is a brunette, and Nina Craig is a redhead.
-   In the _Land of Oz_ books, Dorothy is the blonde, Ozma is the brunette and Glinda is the redhead. At least, according to the illustrations—Ozma was actually described as having "ruddy blonde" books early on, but that seems to be an Early Installment Character-Design Difference.
    -   The Adepts at Magic in _Glinda of Oz_.
-   _Star Wars Legends_:
    -   The three women Luke describes as the greatest loves of his life: Callista (blonde), Gaeriel (brunette) and Mara (redhead).
    -   This seems to be something of a trend, as well. Obi-Wan-Kenobi has had three major women in his life: Duchess Satine Kryze (blonde), Asajj Ventress (brunette, thanks to a recent Retcon) and Siri Tachi (canonically blonde, but famously dyed her hair red for an undercover operation). Obi's Angels, anyone?
    -   Ben Skywalker, Luke's son and Obi-Wan's namesake, has officially picked up on this tendency. So far, he's been involved with one canonical love interest (Vestara Khai, brunette), had one off-hand flirtation with another Jedi (Seha Dorvald, redhead) and been the recipient of one really twisted molestation attempt as a part of a Sith plot ( Tahiri Veila, blonde). Hopefully, his options will get a little better with time...
    -   Jaina and her two would-be sisters-in-law form this with Jaina (brunette), Tahiri (blonde), and Tenel Ka (redhead).
-   Yasmine Galenorn's The Otherworld Series has three full sisters with very different hair colors. Camille, the eldest, has black hair, Delilah has sunny blonde hair and Menolly, the youngest, has bright red hair.
-   _The It Girl_ series by Cecily Ziegesar features power trio Callie (blonde), Tinsley (brunette) and Brett (redhead). Newcomer Jenny is also a brunette. Guess which of the three feels most threatened socially and works hardest to try to tear Jenny down (at least to begin with).
-   Pauline (blonde), Petrova (brunette) and Posy (redhead) in _Ballet Shoes_.
-   Emily (redhead), Adriane (brunette) and Kara (blonde) from the _Avalon: Web of Magic_ series.
-   _The Wheel of Time_: Rand's three girlfriends (and eventual wives)- Elayne (blonde), Min (brunette) and Aviendha (redhead). It's toyed with, though, as Elayne is strawberry-blonde, Aviendha has reddish brown hair, and Min's hair is dark.
-   In the _Deepgate Codex_, we have Rachel (blonde), Carnival (black hair), Mina (brunette) and Alice (redhead).
-   _Circle of Magic_: Sandry (light brown), Daja (black) and Tris (redhead). And Briar (boy) is the odd man out.
-   Betsy (brunette), Tacy (redhead) and Tib (blonde) in the _Betsy-Tacy_ books. Plays with the hair types a bit: Tib is definitely not dumb — she's generally the most sensible and practical of the group and Tacy, far from being fiery, is fun and charming with her friends, but suffers from crippling shyness. Betsy may be brainy in that she's a good writer, but she's generally average at school work. Also somewhat subverted as a cliche in that the three characters are based on three real women, who were a blonde, a brunette and a redhead.
-   The Doctor Who Expanded Universe _Eighth Doctor Adventures_ feature a blonde (Sam), a redhead (Compassion) and a brunette (Anji, who happens to be of Indian descent) who travel with the Doctor, just none of them at the same time. There's also Trix, who's sort of dirty blonde but usually wears wigs. And if we were counting the guys, Fitz has dark brown hair and the Doctor's hair is chestnut brown and, if backlit a certain way, looks practically orange, so there would pretty much be two full sets.
-   In _Percy Jackson and the Olympians_, Annabeth is a blonde, Thalia has dark hair and Rachel is a redhead. However, Annabeth is smart, Rachel is a bit ditzy and Thalia's the one with the fiery temper.
-   In the _Gone_ series, the three main girls are Astrid (blonde), Diana (brunette) and Lana (unspecified hair color). However, none of the girls fit any of the blonde stereotypes (such as Dumb Blonde). Lana fits the typical redhead personality, but Astrid is one of the most intelligent characters in the series, while Diana is a snarky, sarcastic villainess.
-   On the cover of _Saving Zoë_, Echo, Janay and Abby are depicted this way. Janay is the blonde, Echo is the brunette and Abby is the "redhead" (which is really more of a dark blonde/strawberry blonde).
-   Lestat (blond), Louis (brunet/jet black) and Armand (redhead/auburn) from _The Vampire Chronicles_.

-   The respective trio of Bess (light blonde), George (brunette) and Nancy (strawberry blonde/"Titian-haired") in the _Nancy Drew_ series. True to form, Bess is the ditz, George is the smart, practical, athletic and tomboyish one, while Nancy is the main protagonist.
-   The Hatter sisters from _Howl's Moving Castle_. Sophie (redhead), Lettie (brunette) and Martha (blonde).
-   _The Chronicles of Amber_: Three of the Princesses of Amber fit this trope; black haired Deidre who seems to be something of a tomboy, redheaded Fiona, the 'brainy' one and Dumb Blonde Flora. The fourth princess, Llewella, has green hair.
-   _Faeries of Dreamdark_ has Magpie, a brunette; whose best friend and Love Interest is Talon, who's blond; and whose childhood Only Friend is red-haired Poppy.

-   The Swensen daughters in the _Hannah Swensen_ series with Andrea being the blonde, Michelle being the brunette, and Hannah being the redhead.
    -   The movies subvert this by making Michelle and Hannah blondes as well.
-   In the Web Serial Novel _Correspondence From the Goddess_, main characters Lydia and Elana Devin have black and red hair respectively, and when recurring mysterious plotter Rachel Hawkins shows up, she fills in the blonde point of the triangle.
-   The three main female characters in the Monster Mash neo-noir _City of Devils_ follow the pattern. The doppelganger Imogen Verity usually appears blonde, the siren secretary Serendipity Sargasso has black hair (albeit with green highlights), and the witch Hexene Candlemas is a redhead. Additionally, the close harmony group/witch coven the Salem Sisters consist of Hyacinth (blonde), Verbena (brunette), and Lily (redhead).
    -   The sequel, _Fifty Feet of Trouble_, swaps out Imogen Verity for the blonde pinup Giant Woman Pilar O'Heaven.
-   A male example in Relativity: When Michael (blond) was a teenager, his best friends in school were Tony (brunet) and Andy (redhead).
-   In _The Chemical Garden Trilogy_, Rhine is a blonde, Jenna is a brunette and Cecily is a redhead.
-   Ralph (blond), Piggy and Simon (brunet); Jack (redhead) in Lord of the Flies.
-   _The Secret Garden_: Mary, Colin and Dickon. They also form a Two Guys and a Girl team of three .
-   In E. Jade. Lomax's Leagues And Legends series, the vigilantes in the mountains: George (blond), Jack (redhead), and Liam (brunet).
-   The three main girls in _Stranger And Stranger_. Ainslee is a redhead, Shawna is blonde, and April is brunette. Though, after they complete the change into fae they'll all be varying shades of blonde.
-   In _Goddess Girls_, Aphrodite is the Blonde, Athena and Artemis are Brunettes and Persephone is the Redhead.
-   In _Princess Holy Aura_, Cordy is blonde, Holly has black hair, and Tierra has red hair.
-   This is how the sirens from the first _Watersong_ novel, _Wake_, are introduced. Lexi is the blonde ( before she's replaced by another blonde siren, Liv), Penn is the brunette, and Thea is the redhead.
-   The three sisters in _Beauty: A Retelling of Beauty and the Beast_: Grace is the blonde, Hope is the brunette, and while Beauty's hair is a nondescript "neither blonde nor brown" in her awkward adolescence, it turns red as she matures.
-   Male example with the three children in _Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day_; Anthony, the eldest, has blonde hair, Nick, the middle child, has brown hair, and Alexander, the youngest, has red hair. In the 1990 Animated Adaptation by Klasky-Csupo from _HBO Storybook Musicals_, it's Anthony who has brown hair and Nick who has blonde.
-   The main children from _A to Z Mysteries_: Dink (blond), Ruth Rose (brunette), and Josh (redhead).
-   _A Tale of..._: Manea's three daughters: Hazel (silver), Gothel (black), and Primrose (red). Their lack of resemblance is noted to be ominous for witches. It's also foreshadowing to the fact they're not actually triplets.
-   _Warrior Cats_ fans have noticed that main character groups tend to follow a pattern of ginger/black/gray:
    -   The first series began with the best-friends trio of Fireheart the ginger cat, Ravenpaw the black cat, and Graystripe the gray cat.
    -   _Power of Three_ focused on the ginger Lionblaze, the black Hollyleaf, and the gray Jayfeather.
    -   _Dawn of the Clans_ followed ginger Thunder, dark gray Gray Wing, and pale gray Clear Sky.
    -   _A Vision of Shadows_ centers around ginger Alderheart, black-and-white Violetshine, and gray Twigbranch.
    -   _The Broken Code_'s protagonists are the yellow Rootpaw, dark gray-black Shadowsight, and gray Bristlefrost.
-   Despite being a quintet instead of a trio, _The Fabulous Five_ girls fit this trope too. Unusually, only Katie's personality fits her hair—Fiery Redhead. The blondes are _not_ ditsy.
-   In _The Halfblood Chronicles_, Kara, Gianna, and Rennati, the three women bought to be in Lord Kyrtian's harem. True to form, Kara the blonde is sweet-natured, while Gianna the brunette acts as the leader of the three, making most of the decisions. Somewhat subverted with Rennati, who is not really Fiery Redhead, but instead is quite clever and intelligent. (Though she does have a passion for dancing and is the one that feels the most confined as a harem slave.)
-   _The Shadowhunter Chronicles_:
    -   The three main characters of _The Mortal Instruments_ are Clary (redhead), Jace (blond), and Simon (brunet).
    -   The main female leads of the franchise are Clary (redhead), Tessa (brunette), and Emma (blonde). The traditional dynamic also fits to an extent. Tessa, as an immortal, is the most experienced one. Clary is the middle ground, being experienced but still young. Finally, Emma is the youngest of the trio, though she is far from dumb or naive.
-   The eponymous trio of John Updike's novel _The Witches of Eastwick_ exemplifies this ... but unlike the film (and header image), the character whom Cher later played is blonde, Susan Sarandon's eventual character is brunette, and Michelle Pfeiffer's is the redhead.
-   In _Rhythm of War_, Shallan changes her hair color in order to signal which of her three personalities is currently in control: red for "Shallan" (the social/scholarly persona), black for "Veil" (the stealth/infiltration persona), and blonde for "Radiant" (the combat persona).
-   _What to Say Next_ has Jessica, Willow, and Abby, referred to as "The Popular Bitches" in David's notebook. As far as Kit can tell, their friendship is based mostly on hair color optics.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _8 Simple Rules_: Cate (brown), Bridget (blonde) and Kerry (red). Paul and Cate's children can also count, with Rory being the brunette. In an interesting case, Bridget and Rory are the Dumb Blonde and Dumb Brunette respectively, while Kerry is both a Brainy Redhead and a Fiery Redhead.
-   _Austin & Ally_: Austin's the blond, Ally and Trish split brunette duties, and Dez is the redhead.
-   _The Avengers (1960s)_: John Steed's sidekicks were Cathy Gale (blonde), Emma Peel (auburn-haired) and Tara King (brunette).
-   _Battlestar Galactica_: Cassiopeia (lightest), Athena (darkest), Sheba (somewhere in-between) - Serina served as an in-between role before she is killed off and then replaced by Sheba a few episodes later.
    -   Sheba (again an in-between) is also in a Two Guys and a Girl variation with Starbuck (blond) and Apollo (brunette).
    -   The three women who share visions of the Opera House in the re-imagined show are Roslin (redhead), Athena (brunette), and Caprica (blonde). Also a The Hecate Sisters.
        -   A brief example appears in the season 3 finale to rescue \[\[spoilers: Baltar\]\] but the next season's premier reveals there's no significance to the trio as a group, just three random members of a larger group who happened to be picked for the task.

-   _Bones_: Cam, Brennan, and Angela. It fiddles around with the stereotypes, too: Angela is the cool one, Cam is the reserved one, and Brennan is the nerdy one (granted, they're all nerds, but she takes the cake).
-   _The Borgias_: Lucrezia, Vannozza and Giulia.
-   _The Boys_: The three female members of the Seven (from Season 2 onwards) are Starlight (blonde), Stormfront (brunette), and Queen Maeve (redhead). Interestingly, their super costumes invoke the trope as well: Starlight's second outfit (and the one she wears throughout Season 2) is a pure Ms. Fanservice leotard, making her appear the Dumb Blonde, Stormfront's is a more conservative full-coverage suit that invokes Brainy Brunette, and Queen Maeve's is armored warrior garb invoking Fiery Redhead.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   Enforced with the three female leads. When they were cast, all three had the same brownish auburn hair. Alyson Hannigan claims that Joss Whedon said "one of you is going to have to become a redhead" so Alyson volunteered. Sarah Michelle Gellar had brownish hair in season 1 but her appearance got tweaked to look more like a Valley Girl - thus she became a blonde. Charisma Carpenter says she had blonde highlights in but was convinced to go completely dark to play Cordelia.
    -   If one allows male participants, the most commonly seen Blonde, Brunet, Redhead trio on _Buffy_ is Buffy, Willow and Xander. Rather amusingly, the traditional traits associated with each hair color exist in this trio, but palette-swapped; Buffy is the Fiery Blonde, Willow is the Brainy Redhead and Xander is the Dumb Brunette.
    -   A male counterpart has Angel (brunet), Spike (blond) and Oz (redhead).
-   _Charlie's Angels_:
    -   During the fifth (and last) season of the original 1970s series, the Angels were Cheryl Ladd (blonde), Jaclyn Smith (brunette) and Tanya Roberts (redhead). The producers had wanted to use this trope since the beginning.
    -   The 2011 revamp has blonde, brunette and African-American.
-   _Charmed_:
    -   In the fifth season finale, when the sisters become Greek Goddesses, Phoebe's hair is turned blonde and Paige is a redhead at the time and Piper has brown hair. Phoebe is a blonde and the Goddess of Love, Paige becomes redheaded Goddess of War, while Piper becomes Goddess of Earth and is a brunette.
    -   The trio of wood nymphs in a season 5 episode. The redhead gets killed off and amusingly enough they pick Paige (who is redhead at this point) to be her replacement.
-   _Conan_: Conan (redhead), Andy (blond) and La Bamba (brunette).
-   _Cougar Town_: Laurie, Ellie and Jules. True to form, Laurie's a Dumb Blonde, Ellie's a Fiery Redhead (although she's more of a light brown with reddish highlights) and while Jules isn't exactly brainy, she's smarter and more calm and collected than the other two.
-   _Coupling_: Susan, Jane and Sally. Jane is the Ditzy Brunette, thus avoiding the usual personality trio. Plus, Sally can't exactly be called the fiery one, nor is Susan a dumb blonde.
-   _Criminal Minds_: A good portion of Season 5 gave us JJ the blonde, Prentiss the brunette and Garcia, whose hair was red for approximately half a season before she returned to her traditional blonde (additionally, flashbacks reveal Garcia used to be a very un-perky goth with jet-black hair). This is also the hair color scheme of the UnSub's doll collection and thus her victims in "The Uncanny Valley".
-   CSI-verse: The leading ladies of three shows in the franchise. Catherine (redhead — _Vegas_), Calleigh (blonde — _Miami_), Stella and, later, Jo (brunette — _New York_). The leading men as well: Gil, then D.B. (blond — Vegas), Horatio (redhead — Miami) and Mac (brunet — NY).
    -   On CSI: Las Vegas, from seasons 5 through seven, they had Sofia (blonde), Sara (brunette) and Catherine (redhead). Also in Season 12 we had Morgan as the blonde, with the other two girls still fulfilling their roles.
    -   New York's episode 8.03, "Cavallino Rampante," had a trio of sisters who fit this trope.
        -   Also Mac's love interests, depending on one's personal belief about his late wife, Claire. While he tells Reed in season 3 that she had brown hair, in 'Indelible' & 'Near Death' she's clearly shown to have dyed it red/auburn. Peyton was a brunette and Christine is blonde.
-   _Desperate Housewives_:
    -   The 4-girl version with Lynette (blonde), Susan (brunette), Gabby (the Latina) and Bree (redhead).
    -   Their children sort of do this too, but change the combination: Bree's kids are brunettes, Lynette has redheaded twins, and Susan's daughter is blonde. Maybe they all traded babies?
    -   You also get this with former or secondary women. Edie (blonde, dead), Katherine (redhead, left the country) and either Betty (brunette, left the show) or Mary Alice (brunette, dead).
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The Third Doctor's three female Companions were Liz Shaw (redhead), Jo Grant (blonde), and Sarah Jane Smith (brunette).
    -   Gender inverted in the Fifth Doctor era. During this period, the Doctor was fair-haired and his male companions were the dark-haired Adric and the red-haired Turlough.
    -   For a mixed-gender example, there's the blond Sixth Doctor and his on-screen Companions, Peri (brunette) and Mel (redhead).
    -   The three main companions in the Russell T Davies era: Rose (blonde), Martha (brunette) and Donna (redhead).
    -   Eleventh Doctor (dark brown/black), Rory (dark blond) and Amy (extremely Fiery Red Head), plus River (currently blonde; she was also African-British for a while).
    -   Notice that the New Who females are Colour-Coded for Your Convenience; the Doctor's love interests are blonde (Rose, Astrid, River), his best friends are redheads (Donna, Amy), and the unrequited loves are brunette (Martha, Christina, River — notice she only became his love interest when she became blonde). This pattern was broken with the introduction of brunette Clara, however — she fits under "best friend" and "love interest".
-   _Downton Abbey_: The young ladies at Downton in Series 4 and 5 after Sybil dies in childbirth and the Crawleys take in their cousin Rose when her parents sell their house and move to India. Rose herself is the blonde Genki Girl, Mary is the Aloof Dark-Haired Girl (brunette) and Edith, who's the most ambitious, is the redhead.
-   _Dog with a Blog_: Avery (blonde), Nikki and Lindsay (brunettes), and Chloe (redhead).
-   _Eastwick_: The three witches, which makes sense since the movie it is based on did the exact same thing.
-   _Freddy's Nightmares_: Emily (redhead), Annie (brunette), and Starr (blonde) in the second half-hour of the episode _"Deadline,"_ in the series.
-   _Friends_: Rachel was a kind of reddish honey-blonde, placing her between brunette Monica and blonde Phoebe.
-   _Fuego en el sangre_: This Mexican telenovela about three brothers who fall in love with three sisters they sworn in secret to take revenge on for the murder of their teenage sister. The sisters are Sofia- the redhead, Ximena- the brunette and Sarita- the blond. What is interesting is that the sisters cleverly subvert the otherwise stereotypes associated with their hair colors. Sofia- one would expect her to be a Fiery Redhead, but she is actually the most sensible, calm and mature, playing the role of Team Mom for her younger sisters. Ximena- while not dumb, she is neither the Brainy Brunette, in fact, she is the most care-free, fun loving, sociable and sexually adventurous. And Sarita- the younger one, is the absolute opposite of a Dumb Blonde by being bookish, ingenue and serious, and she is the one with the fiery temper that Sofia the redhead lacks.
-   _Game of Thrones_: Dark-blonde Cersei Lannister's rivals one of them possibly being the "younger and more beautiful queen" she believes will unseat her: brown haired Margaery Tyrell, platinum-blonde Daenerys Margarine, red-head Sansa Stark.

-   _Girlfri3nds_: This UK reality programme covers the search for relationship partners for a 3-pack of women in front of the cameras. Aired on ITV2 during 2012.
-   _Glee_: Shelby Corcoran, Emma Pillsbury and April Rhodes. Shelby is a talented, hard working and methodical show choir instructor and April is an unreliable but well-meaning drunk, but Emma isn't quite that fiery (except for that one time...).

-   _Good Girls Revolt_: Has blonde Jane, brunette Cindy, and red-headed Patti. However, while Cindy is by no means stupid, she’s not the designated smart one. Patti is definitely a Fiery Redhead, but Jane is anything but a Dumb Blonde.

-   _Grimm_: Adalind (blonde), Juliette (redhead), and Rosalee (brunette).
-   _Hang Time_: For the entire series, Julie is the blonde and Mary Beth is the brunette; Sam was the redhead in season one, however there was no redhead in season two (Amy, who joined the show that season was a blonde), Kristy became the redhead in the trio when she was introduced in season three. The trope is also easily applied with Beauty, Brains, and Brawn, with Mary Beth being the beauty, Kristy being the brains and Julie (natch) being the brawn.
-   _Haven_ directly invokes the trope, with Audrey (blonde), Lucy (brunette), and Sarah (red-head). As they are all overlay personalities, it's fitting that Mara, the original personality, has hair that is a combination of all three.
-   _H₂O: Just Add Water_: Has a bleach blonde, strawberry blonde and dark brunette, and in one episode, the strawberry blonde tried to go full-on red but couldn't because of her mermaid powers. Charlotte from Season 2 definitely adds a redhead to the spectrum.
-   _How I Met Your Mother_: Lily fills the role of fiery redhead and Robin is the brunette. The role of the blonde is usually filled by Ted's major relationships, such as Stella, Zoey and Jeanette, although Victoria and Robin, as well as the Mother, don't fit this pattern.
-   _iCarly_: In "iReunite with Missy", there's blonde Sam, brunette Carly and redhead Missy. Wendy, a recurring character, can be considered as the show's resident redhead.
-   _Jessie_: Among the female leads, Emma is blonde, Zuri is a raven-haired Afro American girl, and Jessie has red hair which gets lighter as the seasons go on.
-   _Law & Order: SVU_
    -   The three ADAs. Alexandra Cabot (blonde), Casey Novak (redhead, then blonde, then redhead again) and Kim Graylek (brunette).
    -   The episode "Baggage" features a rather twisted variation by having the perp cycle through his victims this way. He is also strangely insistent that they be the victims' natural hair colors; the one who dyed her hair red wasn't raped before she was murdered.
-   _LazyTown_: The three boys among the younger cast qualify: blond Ziggy, brown-haired Stingy, and orange-haired Pixel. Interestingly, Pixel is the smart one, while Stingy is more fiery than the other two and the also brunette Trixie is even more so.
-   _Legacies_: Lizzie Saltzman (blonde), Josie Saltzman (brunette) and Hope Mikaelson (redhead), despite Hope being played by brunette Danielle Rose Russell.
-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power_: The Dweller has Mystical White Hair, The Nomad has red hair, and the Ascetic is a brunette.
-   _Lost Girl_: Lauren (blonde), Bo (brunette), Kenzi (red wigs on occasion)
-   _Lost in Space_: The 1960’s version has three children. Will, red-haired like their mother. Penny, brunette like their father. Where did blonde-haired Judy come from?
-   _Mama's Family_: Naomi and Iola are blonde and brunette, respectively, while flashbacks have shown that gray-haired Thelma was a redhead in her youth (just like her actress, Vicki Lawrence).
-   _Married... with Children_: The early seasons had the female half of the cast fit this trope. Marcy was a brunette before her hair started to get lighter at Season 3 and just became blonder and blonder from then on. Kelly and Peggy, however, remained blonde and redheaded respectively from beginning to end. Al, Bud, Steve and Jefferson avert this trope, since the male half of the cast all have plain brown hair.
-   _Missing Persons_: Did a racial version. An undercover policeman is posing as a pimp and presents a client with three girls: black, white and Asian. "Pick a color, any color."
-   _The Musketeers_: Due to an unacknowledged hair colour change by one of the lead characters (possibly to evoke this trope) Season 2 has the cunning and resourceful Milady, outspoken and courageous Constance and kind and gentle Queen Anne who’s a sheltered and innocent blonde rather than a Dumb Blonde.
    -   Season 3 replaces Milady with the activist and printer Sylvie as the Brainy Brunette.
-   _MythBusters_: When they tested the myth that gentlemen prefer blondes, they used brunettes and redheads to compare. Then they had the women switch hair color via wigs to eliminate certain variables. Result: Busted. There were no significant differences between blondes, brunettes, and redheads.
-   _North and South (U.S.)_: The three most important women in Orry Main's life are his youngest sister Brett (blonde), his mother Clarissa (brunette) and the love of his life/wife Madeline (redhead). One could say that his (brunette) younger sister Ashton, (an eviler version of Scarlett O'Hara) could be important too, but it is clear throughout the series that Orry recognizes Ashton's cruelty and even disowns her. Twice.
-   _The Office_: Cleverly lampshaded when Dwight asks Jim to help pick a stripper for Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration's bachelor party. When Dwight asks Jim to pick between a brunette and redhead, Jim wisely suggests blonde, to Dwight's obvious approval.
-   _One Tree Hill_: The first season had Peyton the blonde, Brooke the brunette and Haley the redhead. Later, Haley dyed her hair blonde and then brunette, so Season 3 introduced us to the redheaded Rachel.
-   _Pan Am_: Laura (blonde), Maggie and Colette (brunettes) and Kate (redhead). Now that she's returned, Bridget also fulfills the blonde aspect.
-   _The Partridge Family_: Shirley (blonde), Laurie (brunette) and Tracy (redhead). Was also inverted with the boys Keith (brunette), Danny (redhead) and Chris (blonde) during Seasons 2-4.
-   _Petticoat Junction_: Billie Jo (blonde), Bobbie Jo (brunette), and Betty Jo (redhead) Bradley.
-   _Power Rangers_: Has done this one more than one occasion, often replacing red with pink.
    -   _Power Rangers in Space_: Could be argued, since Ashley's hair is so much lighter than Cassie's that it often looks blonde by comparison, and Astronema settled on being a redhead for the latter half of the season.
    -   _Power Rangers Ninja Storm_: Tori (blonde), Marah (brunette) and Kapri who generally has pink hair.
    -   _Power Rangers: Dino Thunder_: Kira (brunette, although she occasionally has blonde highlights), Cassidy (blonde), Hayley (redhead) and Elsa (Token Minority).
    -   _Power Rangers S.P.D._: Has an all male example. Jack (minority), Sky (blond), Bridge (brunet) and Sam (redhead). And if one mixes the teams together, you could add Charlie (a brunette, but with red streaks) to Syd's blonde and Z's brunette.
    -   _Power Rangers Mystic Force_: Madison (brunette) and Clare and Leelee (blonde) and Vida dyed her hair pink in the finale to complete the trio as a fiery redhead. The adults also fall under the co-gendered version with Niella (blonde), Leanbow and Daggeron (brunet) and Udonna (redhead).
-   _Privileged_: Megan (redhead), who is often shown to contrast her relationship with her real sister, Lily, (blonde) and her tutees, the Baker twins (brunette), who she becomes more of a big sister to as the series goes on.
-   _Reba_: Reba and Brock's children: Cheyenne (blonde), Kyra (redhead) and Jake (brunet).
-   _Reboot (2022)_: The three female leads, who all have different roles to play in the script-to-screen process: blonde actress Bree, brunette network exec Elaine, and redheaded showrunner Hannah.
-   _Riverdale_: Betty (blonde), Veronica (brunette), and Cheryl (redhead). In the main trio, Archie has the redhead spot.
-   _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_: Sabrina (blonde), Roxie (brunette) and Morgan (redhead) in Season 5 onwards. Subversions of roles again, as Sabrina is the Brainy Blonde, Morgan the Dumb Redhead and Roxie the Fiery Brunette.
    -   Season 1 had Sabrina as the blonde, Jenny as the redhead and the brunette role filled by either Libby or Harvey (if one allows males).
-   _Saturday Night Live_: The three ladies of the original cast were Jane Curtin (blonde), Gilda Radner (brunette) and Laraine Newman (redhead).
-   _Schitt's Creek_: The three ladies of the younger generation are blond Alexis, brunette Stevie and red-headed Twyla.
-   _Scrubs_: Carla (brunette), Elliot (blonde) and Jordan (occasional redhead). Also The Three Faces of Eve.
-   _Sea Patrol_: Kate (blonde), Nikki (brunette), and Bomber (redhead). Later, Kate, Bird, and Bomber after Nikki left.
-   _Sex and the City_: Carrie's closest friends are Samantha (blonde), Charlotte (brunette) and Miranda (redhead).
    
    **Mr. Big:** _(to Carrie)_ I know your friends just fine. Charlotte is the brunette, Miranda is the redhead and Samantha is trouble.
    
-   _Shake it Up_: When Tinka Hessenheffer is on the side of the protagonists, CeCe (redhead), Rocky (brunette) and Tinka (blonde).
-   _Shameless (US)_: Frank Gallagher's three daughters fit this, with Sammi as the blonde, Fiona as the brunette, and Debbie as the redhead.
-   _Smallville_: The female leads later on in the series. Chloe (blonde), Lois (brunette) and Tess (redhead). The odd thing is, Lana is traditionally a redhead but has black hair in _Smallville_, so it doesn't fit until she left and Tess came in.
-   _Sonny with a Chance_:
    -   Tawni (blonde), Sonny (brunette) and Zora (redhead).
    -   Also, Snowy (blonde), Beauty (brunette), and Cindy (redhead) in the sketch comedy show named "The Real Princesses of New Jersey".
-   _Spartacus: Blood and Sand_: Lucy Lawless completes the trio after playing a brunette and a blonde (her natural hair color, amazingly).
    -   Laura Prepon: Redhead who became blonde (apparently the hair dye versions of a Significant Hair Cut) in _That '70s Show_ and now a brunette in _Orange Is the New Black_.
    -   In _Vengeance_ Lucretia is the redhead (after being forced to wear her red wig by Asher) with Seppia as the brunette and Illythia as the blonde.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   _Star Trek: The Original Series_: First pilot "The Cage". The Talosians, who want Captain Pike to breed them a race of slave workers, offer him blonde fellow captive Vina and, later, his own crewmembers — the coldly intelligent Number One (Brainy Brunette) and his pretty female yeoman (a redhead with "unusually strong female drives").
    -   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_: The first season had Tasha Yar (blonde), Counselor Troi (brunette) and Dr. Crusher (redhead). In kind of an odd subversion, though, Tasha acted more like the Fiery Redhead, Dr. Crusher was more like a Brainy Brunette, and, well, let's just say Troi had attributes more commonly associated with blondes.
    -   _Star Trek: Voyager_ had red-highlighted Captain Janeway, brunette B'Elanna and blonde Kes, who was replaced by fellow blonde Seven of Nine.
-   _Stranger Things_:
    -   The main teenage/child characters in Season 3: Robin is blonde, Eleven and Nancy and Erica are brunettes, and Max is a redhead.
    -   If counting just the older teens: Robin (blonde), Nancy (brunette), Barb (redhead).
    -   In the first part of Season 4, there is Robin (blonde) , Nancy (brunette) and Max (redhead) forming the Hawkins teen group with Steve, Dustin, Lucas and later Eddie.
-   _Supernatural_: In "The Song Remains The Same" Dean is having an Erotic Dream where he's being entertained by a dark-haired stripper in a devil's costume. A blonde stripper in an angel's costume quickly joins her. Then red-headed dreamwalker Anna appears to put a damper on events.
-   _Teen Wolf_:
    -   Season 2: Erica (blonde), Allison (brunette), and Lydia (redhead).
    -   Season 4 and 5: Malia (blonde), Kira (brunette), and Lydia (redhead).
-   _That '70s Show_: The main three female members among the kids qualify: Laurie (blonde), Jackie (brunette) and Donna (redhead). They even did a Charlie's Angels sequence at one point. In a rare case of this trope, Jackie is The Ditz among the three. This cycle was broken when Laurie's character was officially written out and Donna went blonde.
-   _That's So Weird_: Hannah, Alana and Kayla.
-   _Three's Company_: The first three seasons had Chrissy (blonde), Janet (brunette) and Mrs. Roper (redhead).
-   _Too Close for Comfort_: Sarah (blonde), Jackie (brunette) and Muriel (redhead).
-   _The Tudors_: Henry's children, with Mary being a brunette, almost a ravenhead as a child, Elizabeth being a redhead, although her hair looked more blondish in her toddler years, and Edward being a blonde. The six wives almost fall into this with the series banner making Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard's hair look like red hair, despite how, on screen, they were blonde, along with Jane Seymour and Katherine Parr, while Katherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn were brunettes.
-   _The Twilight Zone_: In the "A Nice Place to Visit" episode, even though it's in black and white, you can tell that the three girls hanging around with Valentine are the obligatory tri-color trio.
-   _The Vampire Diaries / The Originals_:
    -   Klaus's known love interests across both television shows form a set of six women. One pair for each hair colour. For the brunettes we have:
        -   Tatia, the first known Petrova doppelganger. Her blood was used first to turn the Mikaelsons into vampires and then to seal away Klaus's werewolf side. Elijah stated that he and Klaus were both enamoured with her when they were human.
        -   And Hayley,the former werewolf, now hybrid, who is the mother of Klaus's child (due to a one-night stand).
    -   For the blondes:
        -   Caroline, the young (as in "newly turned") vampire who is best friends with Elena Gilbert, the newest Petrova doppelganger and protagonist of the _Vampire Diaries_.
        -   And Camille "Cami" O'Connell. The human love interest that Klaus has in the spin off show _The Originals_.
    -   For the redheads
        -   Genevieve, a resurrected New Orleans witch introduced in the first season of _The Originals_. She and Klaus begin a sexual relationship during the first season.
        -   And Aurora de Martel, the eldest female non-Original vampire (she was among the first three vampires ever turned by the Originals) and, depending on how much Klaus truly cared for Tatia when he was human, Aurora may have been his first love.
-   _What I Like About You_: There are Val and Lauren (blondes), Holly (light brunette) and Tina (redhead from mid-Season 2 onwards).
-   _Willow_: The three girls of the party at the start are Dove (blonde), Kit (brunette), and Jade (redhead).

-   _Wizards of Waverly Place_: Involves this trope in the forms of Juliet (blonde), Alex (brunette) and Harper (redhead), featured in a few episodes.

    -   Justin's love interests which last for more than one episode qualify.

-   Often done with the three daughters in _King Lear_. Usually as Goneril and Regan are the two evil sisters, they'll have a similar colour - while Cordelia's will be significantly lighter or darker. The most common combination has the evil sisters as the brunette and redhead, while Cordelia is portrayed with Hair of Gold, Heart of Gold. In the Laurence Olivier version, for example, Regan was dark brown and Goneril auburn, while Cordelia was golden blonde. There have been some notable exceptions, though: in the 2014 National Theatre production, sadistic Regan was the blonde and Cordelia was the redhead.

In the original play, Joanne and Mary were both blonde and Kathy was a brunette. Also, in previous productions of the musical, Joanne was the brunette and Kathy the redhead.
-   In the original cast of _Wicked_ the Witches of Oz were cast with this trope, which fits their characters. Elphaba is the Brainy Brunette, Galinda is a Dumb Blonde (but by the end, she gets better) and Nessarose fits Fiery Redhead, since she's such a Yandere.
-   The trio of Chorus Girls in the 2012 cabaret musical _Modern Luv_: Madison = innocent blonde, Hillary = Brainy Brunette (since she's the dance captain/choreographer) and Kimmie = Fiery Redhead.

    Video Games

-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   _Mario_'s three Distressed Damsels: Peach (blonde), Daisy (redhead) and Pauline (originally a blonde but now a brunette). Rosalina would count as a second blonde.
    -   Peach herself cycled through all three in the earlier years due to hardware limitations. In _Super Mario Bros._ and _Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels_ she had red hair, which carried over to the DIC television series versions, while _Super Mario Bros. 2_ and _Super Mario Bros. 3_ gave her dark brown hair. It wasn't until _Super Mario World_ that color palettes were complex enough to give Peach her considered blonde hair.
    -   All modern-day _Mario_ games follow this pattern with the main trio: Mario (brown), Peach (blonde), and Bowser (redhead).

-   The three heroes of _Shining Force III_: Medion, Synbion and Julian.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   In an odd twist, the various Princess Zeldas throughout the series have filled this trope. The Zeldas of the first two games were redheads; _The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past_, _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_ and _The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker_ all featured blonde Zeldas; and the Zelda from _Twilight Princess_, though sort of a dishwater blonde in the final version, was originally designed to be a brunette and is depicted that way in _Super Smash Bros. Brawl_.
    -   Similarly, Link has also embodied all three parts of this trope. In the first two games, he had reddish-brown hair and morphed over subsequent installments to different shades of blonde, but his hair in _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_ is more brown than anything, although he appears blondish in _Brawl_. If you throw supplemental material into the mix, he was a full-on redhead in the Zelda comics and a definite brunette in the animated series.
    -   The three main female characters of _Twilight Princess_: Ilia (blonde), Zelda (brunette) and Midna (redhead).
        -   Similarly, the three Triforce wielders of _TP_ follow this trope very well: Link (blonde), Zelda (brunette), and Ganondorf (redhead).

-   _Resident Evil_:
    -   In _Resident Evil The Dark Side Chronicles_ Sherry (blonde), Ada (brunette) and Claire (redhead) they’re also The Three Faces of Eve. Note, this only works for the Wii game as Claire is brunette in the original game.
    -   _Resident Evil Village_ features Lady Dimitrescu's three daughters—Bela (blond), Cassandra (brunette), and Daniela (redhead).
-   _Skies of Arcadia_ gives us Fina (blonde), Vyse (brunette) and Aika (redhead).
-   If you could actually see Visas' hair at any point in _Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords_ and you count the Handmaiden as the blonde, your younger female party members count.
-   The Seijyun High team in _Rival Schools_ manages to barely scrape by the requirements of the trope. While Akira and delinquent Zaki clearly fit the brunette and redhead respectively, gothic Musical Assassin Yurika is the blonde only because her beige-esque Ojou Ringlets are noticeably lighter than either Akira or Zaki's hairdos.
-   In _Super Robot Wars Judgment_, the Fury Girls - Melua, Katia, and Tenia - fill this trope out nicely.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   The Love Triangle in _Final Fantasy VII_ has it as Cloud (blonde), Tifa (brunette), and Aerith (redhead).
    -   _Crisis Core_ has Freudian Trio SOLDIER Sephiroth (blonde), Angeal (brunette) and Genesis (redhead).
    -   _Final Fantasy VIII_ has blonde Quistis, brunette Rinoa, and redhead Selphie (though Selphie's hair is more of an auburn color).

-   The trio of Ninja from _Sengoku Basara_ - Kasuga (blonde), Sasuke (brunet) and Fuuma (redhead).
-   The three female fighters in _Killer Instinct 2_ are Maya (blonde), Orchid (brunette) and Kim Wu (redhead).
-   _Kingdom Hearts_:
    -   Kairi (redhead) has two lookalikes, Namine (blonde) and Xion (black-haired).
    -   There are another two combinations: Riku (white), Sora (brunette), and Kairi are the main trio, and Roxas (blonde), Axel (redhead), and Xion are the mirror group. In fact, before Xion, most people added Demyx (brunette) to Roxas' group.
    -   _Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep_ then gave us Terra (brunette), Aqua (blue hair) and Ven (blond). In the same game, we got Vanitas as a black-haired version of Sora, pushing the brown-haired Sora up to the "moderate color" column with Roxas and Ventus as the blond.
-   Slight variation in the _Jak and Daxter_ games, with Tess (blonde), Keira (green hair) and Ashelin (redhead).
-   _The King of Fighters_:
    -   Iori Yagami (redhead), Mature (blonde), and Vice (brunette) fill in this trope whenever they form the Yagami Team.
    -   The Japan Team, our heroes, also somewhat fit the pattern - Kyo Kusanagi (reddish-brown), Benimaru Nikaido (blond), and Goro Daimon (brunette) compose the team.
    -   The same goes for their villainous counterparts, the Orochi Team, consisting of Yashiro Nanakase (white - blonde), Chris (brunette), and Shermie (redhead).
-   _Devil May Cry_:
    -   While not all appearing in the same game, the series has Trish (blonde), Lady (brunette) and Lucia (redhead).
    -   _Devil May Cry 4_ plays it straight with Trish (blonde), Lady (brunette) and Kyrie (redhead).
-   The four female character options in _Darkstone_ are a blonde (the Amazon), two brunettes (brown-haired Thief and black-haired Sorceress) and a redhead (Priestess).
-   The Rival of _Pokémon Red and Blue_ has brown hair, the rival of _Pokémon Gold and Silver_ has red hair and the rival of _Pokémon Diamond and Pearl_ has blonde hair.
-   _Street Fighter IV_ (both vanilla and _Super_) has Cammy (blonde), Chun Li (brunette) and C. Viper (redhead). A male variant of this trope from the series featured with the famous shotoclone trio Ryu(brown), Ken(blond) and Akuma(fiery redhead)
-   In the first _Advance Wars_, there's Nell (blonde), Sonja (brunette) and Sami (redhead).

    -   Before Haru joins the party in _Persona 5_, the female party members include Ann (blonde), Makoto (brunette), and Futaba (redhead).
-   _Punch-Out!!_:
    -   The Minor Circuit in the Wii game have Glass Joe (redhead), Von Kaiser (brunette), and Disco Kid (blonde). As King Hippo is completely hairless, he doesn't count.
        -   Similar to the Princess Peach example above, Glass Joe on his own has been all three over the course of the series; he was originally a brunet in the arcade, became blond in the NES game, and then became a redhead in the Wii game.
    -   The Major Circuit follows this trope a bit less straight; Piston Hondo and Don Flamenco (brunette), Bear Hugger (redhead), and Great Tiger (actually a brunette, but the white turban he constantly wears could fit him in as the blonde).
    -   And the World Circuit also follows this; Aran Ryan have reddish-brown hair, Soda Popinski, Bald Bull and Mr. Sandman all have black hair or mustaches, and Super Macho Man's gray hair is often considered as platinum-blonde.
-   _BlazBlue_ has Noel (blonde), Makoto (brunette) and Tsubaki (redhead). They're all close friends, too. However, all of the common hair color stereotypes are simultaneously played straight and scrambled: blonde Noel is socially awkward yet emotional and easily agitated, brunette Makoto is not too bright (or so you'd think) but cheery and fun-loving, and redhead Tsubaki is the brainy, level-headed Stoic who heats up quick if it helps her friends or Jin.
    -   The Mage Academy Trio of Trinity (Blonde), Celica (Brunette), and Konoe/Nine (if you count Pink as Red), can count as this as well.
-   _Tales of the Abyss_:
    -   Guy (blond), Jade (brunet) and Luke (redhead).
    -   The party's female members also fit in the looser sense of blonde (Natalia), brunette (Anise) and something in-between (Tear, who has light brown hair).
    -   Also of note is that the three party members capable of using the Seventh Fonon, which grants Reality Warper capabilities, are Luke, Tear, and Natalia.
-   _The iDOLM@STER 2_ - Project Jupiter is an odd case where the redhead has green hair here.
-   _Grandia II_ features blonde Elena, blue-haired Tio, and redhead Millenia, as playable characters, and brunette Selene as a major non-playable character.
-   _Galerians_ has Rion (blond), Birdman (brunet) and Rita (redhead). There are also Rainheart (brunet) and Lilia (redhead) as well as Cain (blond). The main character cast basically fulfills the trope quota twice.
-   The Miis used to represent the Mii Fighters in the official artwork and in-game trophies in _Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U_. The Brawler has black hair, the Gunner has red hair, and the Swordfighter has blond hair.
-   _Bad Day on the Midway_'s three ladies: Dixie (blonde), Dagmar (brunette) and Lottie (redhead). It gets confusing when you take into account Lottie's Art Shift sequence...
-   _Far Cry 5_: Joseph Seed's three lieutenants/siblings qualify as this. John has brown hair, Jacob has red hair, and Faith has blonde hair.
-   _Dragon Age_ seems to be fond of this trope.
    -   The three female companions of the Warden in _Dragon Age: Origins_: Morrigan has black hair, Wynne has white hair (implied to have been blonde when she was younger), and Leliana is a redhead. If the Warden is female and blonde, the trope is played even straighter.
    -   The three rogue companions in _Dragon Age II_: Varric is blond, Isabela is brunette, and Sebastian (if his DLC is installed) is a redhead.
    -   The advisors of the Inquisitor in _Dragon Age: Inquisition_: Leliana returns and still has red hair; Josephine has blue-black hair; and Cullen is blond.
-   _The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_ features three key sorceresses - Keira Metz, Yennefer, and Triss Merigold, in that order. In this case, the hair colours are personality markers too (though the characters are rounded and fleshed out enough to not make it jarring): Keira is a sweet Girly Girl with a knack for healing, Triss is a Rebel Leader who likes to Kill It with Fire, and Yennefer is a calculating behind-the-scenes player who does most of the heavy theoretical lifting when it comes to magic.
-   Done in the _Dark Parables_ a few times.
    -   In the eighth installment, the five daughters of the King of Prasino fit the trope. Two are blonde, two are brunette, and one has red hair.
    -   In the ninth installment, there are three Red Riding Hood Sisters aiding the detective with her current investigation. Ruth is blonde, Jessica is brunette, and Brianne's hair is deep red.
-   _Puyo Puyo_ has the main protagonists like this: Amitie is the blonde, Arle is the Brunette and Ringo is the Redhead.
-   _Super Off Road_ has the three trophy ladies at the Speed Shop. Player 1 has a blonde in a blue bikini or evening gown (the game has the option of having the ladies in either conservative evening gowns or skimpy bikinis), player 2 has a brunette in a red bikini/gown, and player 3 has a Significant Green-Eyed Redhead in a green bikini/gown.

-   Elia (blonde), Dores (brunette) and Vandi (redhead) of _What Birds Know_. In a variation of the standard trope, Dores is the fiery one and Vandi is serious.
-   The trio of female monster hunters that usually work together in _Charby the Vampirate_ and _Here There be Monsters_ are the fun loving blonde Ella, fashionable brunette June and fiery redhead Rayna.
-   The three female housemates in _Catena_ almost fit the trope. Patches is blonde and Treiss is brunette, but Belle's hair is actually pink, not red.
-   The three female leads of _Out There_: red-haired Miriam fits the Fiery Redhead trope reasonably well, but also has some Dumb Blonde tendencies; the usually dark-haired Sherry (who sometimes bleaches her hair blonde) can be seen as the Brainy Brunette; and the dark-haired Araceli, despite her occupation (she's an attorney) and hair color, is somewhat of a Shy Blue-Haired Girl.
-   _Eerie Cuties_/_Magick Chicks_: The Hellrune Coven are a witch trio that appears in both comics. Melissa (the blonde) is the Coven's leader, with Jacqui (brunette) and Cerise (redhead) as her subordinates.
-   Currently, _Blip_ has moody brunet K, redhead Cloudcuckoolander Hester, blonde Cyborg Mary and blue-haired Liz.
-   _Questionable Content_: one could say this applies to the ladies working at the Coffee of Doom. Dora has black hair, Raven had a blonde streak and Faye's hair colour could qualify as being between the two. Later, after Raven gets Put on a Bus, Penny shows up to fulfill the blonde requirement, though she defies the trope in personality...
-   _Rain (2010)_ has the trio of Emily (blonde), Debbie (brunette), and Holly (redhead).
-   The three female leads of _LCD_: Julianne McIntyre is the blonde, Raven Svoboda is the brunette and Terry Sligh is the redhead.

-   The major female characters in _Arthur, King of Time and Space_ are Guenevere (redhead), Morgan (brunette) and space/contemporary!Tristam (chestnut). Originally it was Morgan (brunette), Guenevere (redhead) and space/contemporary!Bedivere (blonde), until Bedivere was retconned as male in all the arcs.
-   Geoff (blonde), Drucilla (brunette) and Pibgorn (redhead). Alternately: Pigorn, Drucilla (black hair) and the hair fairy (brown hair).
-   _El Goonish Shive_ hasn't included this trope proper for a while, but the first three female protagonists to be introduced in the comic were Sarah (blonde), Grace (brunette) and Nanase (redhead). The next two girls had dyed dark blue hair<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  (which appeared black) and brunette hair respectively. Nanase's hair became dark as a result of her magic burning out in later arcs and Susan's dyed hair color became permanent as a result of her magic awakening, leaving Sarah as the only blonde in a cast full of dark-haired girls.
-   _Sunstone_ has Anne, Allison and Lisa respectively.
-   In _Pacificators_, from the main cast alone, there are two brunettes (Daryl and Muneca), a blonde (Larima), a redhead (Cinna) and two with black hair (Bismun and Taffe). That's not even counting the supporting and minor characters...

-   _Tripp_ has Coco, Sam, and Proxy, respectively.
-   Although only one of them is a girl, the Love Triangle in _Girl Genius_ has blonde/strawberry blonde Agatha, brunet Gil, and redhead Tarvek. The stereotypical temperaments are all mixed up though - they're all extremely smart, with Agatha arguably being the most skilled, and Tarvek is much better at keeping his temper under control than the other two.
    -   In terms of girls, the main group of Agatha, Violetta and Zeetha has a blonde, a redhead and... a greenhead? It's still three contrasting colours, though.
-   In _Prague Race_ Miko, Leona, and Colin.
-   _Disney High School_ has Rapunzel, Belle and Ariel as three of the main characters, and a group of friends. Belle obviously fits the Brainy Brunette role, though Rapunzel is more awkward than dumb (being a former homeschooled kid), and Ariel is something of a Cloudcuckoolander (here she's fascinated with aliens, not humans).
-   _Riverside Extras_ has blonde Derry Lake, brunette black woman Ophelia Banksly, and redhead Cynthia Brandt as the Sisters, the second highest members of the all-female gang The Roses.
-   Among Aesop, Bri and Lenius in _Aisopos_, Bri is the Blonde, Aesop is the Brunette and Lenius is the Redhead.

    -   Roisin (blonde), Laura and Lindsay (brunette) and Nora (redhead). Sadia is black-haired, adding the fourth colour.
    -   The episode "Party Animals" has the straightest combination - Nora and Roisin are joined by the latter's brunet cousin Marty.
-   From Channel Awesome: Lisa Foiles, The Nostalgia Chick and Obscurus Lupa. This isn't the only combination you can make, however, since the site has many characters.
-   _Rocketboom_ has this with the hosts of its three YouTube channels: blonde Meme Molly on Rocketboom Daily, brunette Ellie Rountree on Rocketboom Tech, and redheaded Ella Morton on Rocketboom New York City.

Pike has white hair (which was originally black before she died and got resurrected), Vex is a brunette and Keyleth a redhead. Their hair colors are actually the same as the actresses' who play them (Ashley Johnson, Laura Bailey and Marisha Ray, respectively).

    Western Animation 

-   _Alvin and the Chipmunks_: The Chipettes; Eleanor (blonde), Brittany (redhead) and Jeanette (brunette). Though it's difficult to determine with Brittany, as her hair seems to change color, depending on the animation, coloring, etc, while her hair does appear red on some occasions, it mostly appears light brown, and in even rare occasions (merchandising) blonde.
    -   In the CGI reboot, the titular Chipmunks themselves are a male example of this trope. Theodore, Simon and Alvin respectively.
-   _American Dragon: Jake Long_: The Witches of Woodstock from the episode "Game On", Annika, Bubonica and Monica.

-   _Doug_: Patti (blonde), Connie (brunette, but more blue-violet) and Beebe (redhead). However, Patti and Connie swapped their hair stereotypes, as Patti is the brainy one and Connie's more naive. Beebe's still a Fiery Redhead. Funnily enough, Connie was blonde in the show's first season.
-   _Duck Dodgers_: In the episode "Villainstruck," the villain is a man with long blond hair who frequently appears flanked by a brunette and a redhead.

-   _The Flintstones Comedy Show_: Pebbles (red), Penny (brunette) and Wiggy (blonde).
-   _Gargoyles_: The Weird Sisters are a variant — identical except that they have black, golden and white hair. They respectively represent fury, grace and fate, according to Word of God, though act much like Single Minded Triplets in order to bring all three forces into fruition.

-   _Scooby-Doo_:
    -   _The Ghost of the Bad Humor Man_: While featured as cloaks, not hair, the antagonists of this 1976 episode were the Vanilla, Chocolate, and Strawberry Phantoms, so the color scheme technically matches up.

-   _Six Teen_: Caitlin (blonde), Nikki (naturally black, dyed purple) and Jen (redhead).
-   _South Park_: The four main boys consist of Stan (black hair), Cartman (brown hair), Kyle (redhead) and Kenny (blond). The stereotypes are Played With a little: Kyle is The Smart Guy, but also a Fiery Redhead, while Stan is more levelheaded. Kenny isn't necessarily dumb, but he's a massive pervert, so "blonds have more fun" applies.
    -   When Kenny died semi-permanently, both of his "replacements" (Butters and Tweak) were blond.
    -   The three most prominent female fourth graders, Bebe (blonde), Wendy (brunette), and Red (redhead), also count. They fit the stereotypes pretty well, though Bebe is implied to be pretty smart despite having the personality of a Lovable Alpha Bitch.

    Real Life 

-   Britain's Prince William (blond), his wife Kate (brunette) and his brother Harry (redhead) have been described as a "power trio" and, prior to Harry's relocation to North America, often appeared together at events (such as being the official ambassadors of the London Olympics).
