♫ You can bawl if you want to, you can shed those tears tonight ♫

_"There you go, let it all slide out. Unhappiness can't stick in a person's soul when it's slick with tears."_

Maybe a person is a Stepford Smiler. Maybe they were raised to think that Men Don't Cry. Or perhaps they're just afraid of showing weakness. For whatever reason, a person just refuses to cry when they clearly want to or calls themself weak for doing so. That's when someone tells them that there's nothing wrong with showing sadness or vulnerability. Cue the waterworks. Often accompanied by a Cooldown Hug. Will often cross over with Cathartic Crying. Expect the character to pull the Sand In My Eyes excuse.

This often comes in conjunction with Repression Never Ends Well, as a character might be told that holding back their tears is unhealthy. A character who feels like they're Unable to Cry may learn that it's healthier for them if they do. A Sad Clown may also be the one learning this moral. It also often accompanies Manly Tears, either from the man's buddies encouraging him to let it out, or the man himself affirming he's secure enough in his masculinity that he doesn't care. This trope is related to the "Anger Is Healthy" Aesop as this is when a character is taught that being angry is nothing to be ashamed of as long as it's not a violent extreme.

Some researchers have argued that crying can actually be beneficial in some cases. In Real Life, repressing emotion and not showing vulnerability when required can be damaging to one's mental health. It is therefore not surprising that a number of stories encourage crying or showing vulnerability as An Aesop.

See also Mistakes Are Not the End of the World, "Anger Is Healthy" Aesop, and Fear Is Normal for other tropes about unpleasant things being normal.

**Because several of these reasons to cry are plot-relevant, unmarked spoilers are abound.**
