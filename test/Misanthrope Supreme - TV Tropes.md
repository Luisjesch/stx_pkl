_"In my lifetime I have murdered 21 human beings ... I have no conscience, so that does not worry me. I don't believe in Man, God, nor Devil. I hate the whole damned human race, including myself."_

These human characters not only agree that humans are worthless scum, but think this makes it absolutely justified to slaughter a few innocent humans now and then. They may even desire the destruction of the entire human race—with themselves likely (but not certainly) excepted. The most sympathetic cases are likely to have broken by the horrors of the world around them to the point that they have a hard time seeing or recognizing anything good and may even not be entirely wrong, depending on the unpleasantness of their society.

Sometimes, they tend to be Straw Character Malthusians who want to "solve overpopulation" or restore/restart the planet to its "natural" (i.e., non-human) state.

More commonly, they appear during an Alien Invasion or its rough fantasy equivalent, believing in the superiority of the invaders. As such, they probably belong to Les Collaborateurs, and expect to be rewarded with overlordship of the surviving humans. This version of the trope is common in the sci-fi "alien invasion" serial films of the 40s and 50s wherein there was always a human collaborator who never seemed to mind that his actions, if successful, would bring about the destruction of his home and everyone/thing he knows.

Nonhuman characters who believe in the moral bankruptcy of their own species may be presented in equivalent ways, but they tend instead to be the more sympathetic My Species Doth Protest Too Much.

    Anime and Manga 

-   Most of the members of the Noah family from _D.Gray-Man_ seem to be this, as they have absolutely no calm about maiming, tormenting and basically planning to Kill All Humans. However, Road Kamelot is the only one who clearly states it:
    
    _"I don't think anything of killing those insignificant humans. I just hate this world full of these worthless beings. You should all just die and go away."_
    
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   _Dragon Ball Z_ displays this perfectly with Dr. Gero during the Android/Cell Saga. In addition to hating Son Goku and friends, it's heavily implied that Gero hates the human race as a whole, considering that he made multiple killing machines who lack the slightest bit of empathy towards humanity and delight in their fear and deaths.
    -   Goku Black, the main villain of _Dragon Ball Super_'s Future Trunks Saga, a trait he shares with his partner and Alternate Universe equivalent, Future Zamasu. A God-in-training, Zamasu became convinced that mortals were squandering the gifts given to them by the gods while the gods themselves are too lazy to do anything about them and wants to make the universe perfect...by killing off every last mortal. Of course, he _also_ killed off all the other gods to ensure that they couldn't interfere with his plan. By this point, Zamasu thinks he's better than anyone, god and mortal.
-   Arc Villain Psykos in _One-Punch Man_ was a Super Supremacist who believed their powers put them above other humans, and began plotting to wipe them out and have the monsters take over, becoming their leader.
-   _Str.A.In.: Strategic Armored Infantry_'s Ralph Werec, Dragon-in-Chief to Vivian Medlock, who betrayed the Union and joined the Deague upon learning that the Union performed inhumane experiments on the little-girl aliens known as the Emilys. He later betrays Vivian and the Deague, seeing them as equally horrible, and wants to Kill All Humans.
-   Shinobu Sensui of _YuYu Hakusho_ is the Straw Nihilist variety. Also includes himself.
-   _Gundam_ has several examples.
    -   Rau Le Creuset, oh so much. Though, he has his reasons for thinking this way.
    -   Also, Master Asia is ready to accept quite a few casualties to reach his goal. He has better reasons. He also sees the errors in his logic before he dies.
    -   _Zeta Gundam_ and _Gundam ZZ_'s Haman Khan is a Lawful Evil variation on this trope, planning to grind the world under her jackbooted heels because in her mind, none of us can be trusted, and we all have it coming.
-   The Earth dragons in _X/1999_ are a prime example.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_'s version of Kimblee is a ranting Straw Nihilist who believes that the inherent worthlessness of humanity means he's allowed to kill and abuse whoever he wants. Unusually, he _does_ include himself on this, claiming to be just as hollow as everyone else.
    -   The 2003 anime version's Envy also has this vibe to him, believing that people deserve to be tormented for daring to think that their lives have any real value to them. Needless to say, he's one of the most flat-out evil bastards in the series. His boss Dante adopts this attitude as a pose, but it's really just a cover for her own abhorrent selfishness.
    -   The Gold-Toothed Doctor in the manga and _Brotherhood_ series may count, though his reasons for helping the Homunculi destroy humanity are never really explored.
-   _Trigun_'s Legato Bluesummers is this, especially in the anime where he's comparatively sane and keeps his dignity. It's unclear whether his primary motivation is whatever he knows of Knives' Start of Darkness, his own crapsack life, the world in general, his complete and utter devotion to a guy who happens to be an Omnicidal Maniac, or just his own personal flavor of crazy. He has his own Tear Jerker Start of Darkness in the manga, where he is much less cool but _much_ more of The Woobie (although a disgustingly evil woobie), but in the anime he is both more mysterious and more emotionally self-sufficient.
    -   Millions Knives from _Trigun Stampede_. Just like in previous incarnations, he hates humanity with a burning passion and wants to exterminate them all. Stampede places particular emphasis on his belief humans have stolen Vash from him.
-   _Sengoku Youko_'s protagonist Jinka has expressed his hatred of humanity many times, and has made it a goal to obtain a demon's body.
-   The Kanto Elite Four in the _Yellow_ arc of the _Pokémon Adventures_ manga. They claim to want to wipe out humanity to protect Pokémon, but don't seem to have any real interest in the welfare of Pokémon either.
-   Mayor Takeshi Hirokawa from _Parasyte_, who supports the parasites' natural diet despite being 100% human. His internal monologues even categorise humans as "them".
-   Yatsumura from _Magical Girl Site,_ as evidenced by the advice she gives Aya.
    
    _"Disgusting people. Snide people. People you hate. Annoying people. People who break the law. People who jeer at others. Violent people. Overly proud people. People who have no sense of morality. People who trouble others. People who hurt others for their own desires. People who threaten others. Once you become aware of others harming you, you should just eliminate them all."_
    
-   Zeref from _Fairy Tail_. After 400 years of watching humanity make the same mistakes over and over again, he's had enough. Eerily enough, he states his intention to wipe out humanity with the same sorrowful tone he uses when apologizing for accidentally killing things. As it turns out, the truth is more complicated than that. Zeref hates humanity and the world in its current state partially because he sees it as _his_ fault things are the way they are (and considering what his own actions and that of his creations and those who misused them have done, it's probably not too inaccurate), which only further compounds his own death wish. His endgame is to gain enough power to cast a spell that will send him back to the point before he became immortal with his memories intact so he can change things, and since he's such an integral figure in history such an act would irrevocably change the future to the point the present wouldn't exist anymore. As such, humanity as the world knows it would quite literally be wiped out.
-   Ragyo Kiryuin and Nui Harime from _Kill la Kill_ are both extremely contemptuous of humans, with the former maintaining a Social Darwinist mindset and the latter just being Cute and Psycho. Both of them are servants of parasitic aliens called Life Fibres, which they view as the ultimate life forms, meaning humans in general are rock bottom on their list of worthy beings.
-   Fujimoto from _Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea_ is a formerly human sorcerer/demigod who wants to Kill All Humans in a Gaia's Vengeance plot.
-   Shuji Fujigawa from _Killer Killer_ holds a very low opinion of the human race (aside from his best friend Takumi), believing that anyone has the capability to become a murderer and they could become one at any time, and that means stopping murder at all costs. Given that he witnessed both the massacre of his entire school and The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Human History, it's actually not unreasonable why he feels that way. What _is_ unreasonable is that, for all his talk of how horrible murder is, he's been butchering killers and those he deems potential killers with impunity. Also, his personal end goal to ensure murder never happens again involves slaughtering the entire human race.
-   Light Yagami from _Death Note_ is an interesting variation of this trope. As a narcissistic perfectionist who believes that he is superior and a better person than all humans, he believes that the world must be perfect and in his image and likeness, completely unable to realize that all humans<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  have flaws.
-   Muzan Kibutsuji from _Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba_. Muzan thinks lowly of the human species in general, despite having a wife and child. It's more because he has to remain in cover from the Demon Slayers actively hunting them down. It's then revealed they aren't his wife and child, and he kills all the human beings who ever gave him shelter. The only value he assigns humans is as a food source.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_:
    -   While it's not evident given his Laughing Mad demeanor and his penchant for macabre jokes usually at the life-and-limb expense of someone else, the Joker is actually absolutely full of hatred and spite towards basically everyone and the entire world. Several stories have gone into this and it's implied that the Joker finds it so easy to kill everyone around him, not because he feels nothing for them, but in fact because he loathes everyone aside from his twisted relationship with Batman.
    -   Mister Freeze likewise sometimes wants to destroy humanity, though in his case it's revenge on the world for how it treated him and his wife.
    -   Poison Ivy seemingly has similar goals to Ra's; she supposedly identifies more with plants and has little love for humanity (besides her on-and-off thing with Harley Quinn and a soft spot for children). However, it's evident that her goals are also driven by personal vendetta and anger for her lifetime of being neglected by her parents alongside her being used by her college professor who exploited her feelings. Her habit of targeting and seducing men to feed to her plants is a big indicator of this (so much so one of her monster plants became sentient and attacked her because it felt the pain of said men after eating so much of them).
    -   Ra's al Ghul is an insane and immortal Eco-Terrorist who believes that humanity must be eradicated, or greatly culled, to stop them from ruining the planet.
    -   Likewise Talia al Ghul, the above villain's daughter. Sometimes, it's arguable whether she goes along with her father's plans because she believes in the cause or because she wants her father's approval. Regardless, she's certainly never protested for the lives of innocents to be spared her father's culling.
-   _Johnny the Homicidal Maniac_ not only hates people in general but seems to hate everything about being human as well. It turns out that a lot of this might be due to him being a flusher for all of humanity's various ills; it's hard to say, since his backstory and many aspects of his life are deliberately kept as vague as possible.
-   _Judge Dredd_: The father of the man who would one day become Judge Death was an insane dentist who was consumed with hate and loathing for people, to the point of regularly torturing and murdering his patients. His son adopted his stance on the worthlessness of life before becoming a Judge, leading him to the conclusion that all of it must be exterminated.
-   _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_: Hawley Griffin tries to sell out all of humankind to the Martian invaders in hope of ruling Earth as "Invisible Man the First".
-   Saturn Queen, in the most recent reboot of the _Legion of Super-Heroes_. With her telepathy giving her a constant look at the underbelly of the human mind, she's become convinced that Humans Are the Real Monsters, and that as such, her own thievery, murder, and attempts to Take Over the World — and those of her partners, Cosmic King and Lightning Lord — are perfectly okay.
-   _Transmetropolitan_: Gary "The Smiler" Callahan's desire to be a President Evil (which is stated to be his only desire) is motivated by two things, both originating from his hatred of people: 1) Because he thinks so little of people that he feels like he should be above them by holding a position of power, and 2) Because this position provides him with enough power to oppress people without them being able to fight back.
    
    _"I hate you all, you know? All you scum. I want to be President because I hate you. I want to fuck with you. I want to make you shut up and do things properly. Get through your doomed little lives quietly."_
    
-   _Ultimate X-Men_: For all his adult life, Magneto has believed in the superiority of the "Homo superior" race and despised the human race to the point that he sought to kill all of humanity so that only mutants remain. Then he learns that the "mutant gene" and the very existence of mutantkind is the result of experiments in a military lab. Obviously, this causes quite a Villainous BSoD.
-   _Wonder Woman_ Vol 1: Stemming from her experience of being sold into human trafficking by her own father Zara despises humanity and wantonly kills without remorse or care. It's unclear if she was already allied with Saturnian slavers planning on invading earth prior to meeting Eviless on Reformation Island, but she leaps at the chance to do so.
-   _X-Men_: Apocalypse in all his incarnations invariably considers himself a god and regards everyone else (whether human or mutant) as either worthless inferiors or, at best, Worthy Opponents. Then _Age of X-Man_ happened, and Apocalypse underwent a very comprehensive Break the Haughty at the hands of his thematic opposite (though "good counterpart" might be stretching it), the exponentially more powerful Nate Grey. After that, in _X-Men (2019)_, he is a notably more thoughtful and humbler figure, willingly taking a senior position on Krakoa but — crucially — _not_ being in charge and expressing pride in all that mutantkind has achieved.

    Fan Works 

-   _Megami no Hanabira_: Father Archibald Phillips: whether he started off this way or genuinely believed causing a demon outbreak would bring humanity back to God is unclear, but by the time the girls confront him, his motives have twisted to 'become an angel and abandon humanity to the demons because they're sinful, weak insects'.
-   In _The Jaded Eyes Series_, Harry/Tristan absolutely hates all muggles and would have no problem with killing them all except that the vampires need their food.
-   Alucard is one in _Hellsing Ultimate Abridged_:
    
    _"The funny thing is, in any other circumstance, you might have had a point there. Except my boss is a woman, I was a chick in the '40s, I hate everyone equally, and there's NO ONE ALIVE who could comprehend my sexual preference. So, in other words, Ms. Van Winkle, chuh-chuh-chuh-CHECK YOUR PRIVILEGE!"_
    
-   Many human members of the Ponification for Eath's Rebirth (PER) in _The Conversion Bureau_ are usually this. They are often completely convinced that converting humans into ponies is the only way save the earth, regardless of any trade-offs.
-   _Webwork_ has Simon Leston, the new Squid Khan General. He despised humanity when he was one, and now he can act on it.
-   _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_: Many bloodliners take this attitude due to suffering of Fantastic Racism from normal humans. Two notable examples are Misty, who was The Unfavorite in her family and after traveling on her own for a while she stops seeing herself as a human, and Iris, due to being abandoned by her birth parents as a baby and being raised by Dragon-type Pokémon, she comes to despise humanity due to inflicting harm on nature due to their "progress". However, their mindsets begin to change after they meet Ash.
-   Valon in _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_; in contrast with Dartz's other Henchmen, who all have tragic, convoluted backstories explaining how they came to the conclusion that humanity was evil and needed to be wiped out, he just joined their project because he "fucking hates people". Amusingly, Joey considers this the most reasonable motive for being evil in the season.
-   In _Monster Chronicles_, Cedric sees humans as weak, pathetic creatures, comparing them to livestock at one point.

    Film 

-   Pastor Ernst Toller becomes this in _First Reformed_, eventually plotting to kill himself and other ministers/members of his church via a suicide bombing. He's inspired to do so by his conversations with suicidal anti-natalist Michael Mensana.
-   Dr. Robotnik from _Sonic the Hedgehog (2020)_ is a human who hates humanity. Robotnik finds humans to be a letdown, thinks everyone is stupid but him, and makes a point of having no friends. The reason Robotnik loves machines is because of their greater efficiency and how they can only do as they're told.
    
    _"You know, I won't miss you when you're gone. Human beings are stupid and unreliable, and I care very little about them. My machines are diligent and relentless. THEY'RE EVERYTHING TO ME!"_
    
-   The Joker from _The Dark Knight_ seems to be this. His motivation is to prove that, deep down, everyone is just as rotten and evil as he is, and he intends to rip away the "façade" of do-goodiness and create a world where, essentially, everyone acts like a violent criminal. As a matter of fact, one of his plans is foiled by the citizens and prisoners of Gotham choosing to not kill each other to save their own lives, which causes a Villainous Breakdown.
-   Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor in _Superman: The Movie_ is willing to wipe out the California coast just so that he can make a killing in real estate. In _Superman II_, he's all too happy to sell out the human race to Zod to help him destroy Superman. In _Superman IV: The Quest for Peace_... well, the only person he seems to get along with is the one he creates to destroy Superman.
-   Ivo Shandor, the Greater-Scope Villain of _Ghostbusters (1984)_, was this. While he never appears physically in the movie, he is described as having been extremely hateful towards mankind and performed horrific experiments on living people. His hatred escalated to the point where he constructed an interdimensional doorway at the top of an apartment building in Manhattan, designed to summon a shapeshifting Eldritch Abomination to wipe out mankind.
-   Daniel Plainview in _There Will Be Blood_. In his own words, "I look at people and see nothing worth liking." His son H.W. is the only person he treats with anything resembling affection, and that only lasts so long.
-   Francesco Dellamorte in _Cemetery Man_ — "I have no time for the living" he states, and on advice from Death, promptly embarks on a murder spree.
-   Marty and Dana, the surviving protagonists of _The Cabin in the Woods_, have fallen into this role by the end of the film. After being subjected to almost everything that the organizers behind the cabin need to do in order to appease the Old Gods and save humanity — along with a harrowing jaunt through the monster-infested facility — a combination of mortal injuries, psychological trauma and despair-induced apathy leads them to let the human race get wiped out.
-   Gallo from _Pandorum_ wanted to keep overpopulation from repeating itself so he killed his crew and made other passengers develop Space Madness. Exploiting their mental state, Gallo would manipulate them into exiling themselves in the cargo hold to fight to the death and feed on the corpses of the fallen. So over generations their descendants evolved and adapted to the ship, becoming a new species.
-   In _Nightbreed_, the serial killer Dr. Decker justifies his crimes as being part of his mission to purify the world of humans. He wants to stop "breeders" from spreading their "filth" and murders entire families, including their children.
-   Valentine from _Kingsman: The Secret Service_ believes that humanity is a "virus" on the world and the only way to save the world was to cull a large portion of the population.
-   Carlton Drake, the main antagonist of _Venom (2018)_, believes that mankind has decimated the world to the point of collapse and that only by bonding with the symbiotes can they evolve into a species worthy of surviving extinction.
-   Alan Jonah in _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_, after fighting in a lot of very dirty wars, has no problem with King Ghidorah exterminating humanity, casually dismissing Emma's belief that humans and kaiju could live in harmony.
    
    _"I've seen human nature firsthand, and I'm here to tell you that it doesn't get any better. It just gets worse."_
    
-   _The Truman Show_: Beneath all of Christof's prattle about making artistic statements and such, it becomes clear by the end that the _real_ reason he keeps Truman trapped in the artificial town is because he's a cynical, nihilistic, and narcissistic misanthrope who demonizes the world as being sick and evil, hence his insistence that he's "protecting" Truman by cutting him off from all the struggles of the real world.
-   Dr. Volumnia Gaul from _The Hunger Games The Balladof Songbirdsand Snakes_. She is firmly of the opinion that all humans are inherently evil and in fact uses this to justify the Capitol's totalitarian rule over Panem, because of course those savage animals of the Districts couldn't possibly dream of placing themselves to order.
-   Gabriel from _Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One_. His nihilistic and cynical contempt for all of humanity is stated to be his motive for doing the things he does; Ilsa says he sees killing other people as doing them a favor. And it's implicitly why he serves as the Entity's willing, even enthusiastic slave, since he sees its cold, inhuman mind as superior to himself and other human beings.

    Literature 

-   Some humans in David Brin's _Uplift_ cycle have declared themselves clients of various alien races believing them to be humanity's long-lost patrons, and occasionally find themselves in opposition to the "free" humans.
    -   In _Infinity's Shore_ one character points out to one such Danikenite that given humanity's history, any patrons would have to be neglectful if not outright abusive enough to warrant extermination by Galactic law.
-   In Tom Clancy's novel _Rainbow Six_, the Big Bad is a hard green environmentalist. Rather than trying to save humanity by saving the environment, he and his cohorts seek to kill off 99% of humanity to "bring back nature".
-   Worshippers of most Lovecraftian Eldritch Abominations.
-   Robert A. Heinlein's novels have a few.
    -   In _Have Space Suit – Will Travel_, two human traitors aid the alien Wormfaces, who capture, kill and eat humans and eventually plan to conquer the Earth and do the same to everyone.
    -   In _The Puppet Masters_, there are some human beings who do not have masters riding them, who are so vile that they serve as Fifth Columnists to the masters.
-   The Peace Brigade from the _New Jedi Order_ series is made of this trope. Though it's not so much that they _hate_ the other inhabitants of the Galaxy as they're simply scared stiff of the Yuuzhan Vong. Their mentality is less "our own race(s) suck" as it is "better them than us!"
-   Pryrates from Tad Williams' _Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn_.
    -   Dread from _Otherland_ also counts, as he hates everyone and wants to get painful revenge on the world for its mistreatment of him.
-   _Erostratus_ by Jean-Paul Sartre attempts to make one of these into an Anti-Villain. He compares his dislike of people to another person's dislike of lobster, albeit much less socially acceptable — and much more futile, since everything he does winds up benefiting humanity. As he puts it, "All my life I have been banging my head against a door that says 'No entry if not a humanist.'"
-   The Mad Scientist in the Alternate History novel _Moon of Ice_, by Brad Linaweaver, helps a rogue Nazi conspiracy create a virus that will kill all those without blonde hair and blue eyes (which, as he well knows, includes most Nazis). He turns out to be a Jew driven insane by the discrimination he suffered as a youth, who as a result hates all humanity.
-   Crake from _Oryx and Crake_ believes humanity to be so deeply and irredeemably flawed that he attempts to exterminate all of it and start all over.
-   Kallor of _The Malazan Book of the Fallen_ is a spiteful, vicious bastard, who's been The Emperor to a hundred kingdoms, and deliberately run them all into the ground. He feels no remorse for this, since he's convinced that humans are bullies and Domestic Abusers, and that he's just doing on a grand scale, what everyone else does on a small one. He even manages to make it feel rather personal, a feat in and of itself.
-   "Good life" humans who help the Berserkers in Fred Saberhagen's _Berserker_ series in their quest to destroy all life.
-   In _The Three-Body Problem_, the Earth-Trisolaran Organisation was divided between people who thought the aliens should conquer humanity, people who thought they should exterminate them, and people who wanted to be exempted from the extermination. By the time of _The Dark Forest_, with the ETO mostly dissolved and a great fleet on the way, only the second faction — the Adventists — were left.
-   The eponymous _Gog_ wants to be alone, but can't. Even when he is alone, he still feels part of humanity, and that makes him angry. He hates absolutely everybody and has intricate fantasies about killing everyone on Earth.
-   _Bazil Broketail_: Lukash is explicitly described as such. By committing war crimes and otherwise killing or harming people, he basically vents his frustration over his miserable childhood on the entire world.
-   Sir Isaac Ray Peram Westcott, the Big Bad of _Date A Live_, despises all of mankind, be they men, women, children or even infants. His goal is to turn the whole world into a "hell" to wipe out all humans of the world, and later rebuilt the world in a "utopia" where mages like himself will rule and live without wars and conflicts according to his own vision.
-   This is the core of Aur's character from _How to Build a Dungeon: Book of the Demon King_. He is a human who grew to harbor immense hatred towards his own kind, justifying his hatred by being forced to help his master whom he loved with a Psychic-Assisted Suicide after her nation demanded her death; Aur goes on to become a sorcerer, taking up the title of Demon Lord and vowing to make humanity become his miserable pawns. Aur wastes no time in making many humans go through horrible ordeals, from genocide, to enslaving, to manipulating, to raping; anything goes as far as Aur is concerned.
-   Serial Killer Carl Panzram, as the page quote shows, expressed a hatred for humanity overall in his memoir _Killer: A Diary of Murder_, including infamously saying he wished everyone had one neck so he could cut if off. He confessed to twenty two murders during its writing, and was hanged later for killing a prison guard, even rebuking the executioner over not having done this fast enough.
-   AM from _I Have No Mouthand I Must Scream_. AM is a supercomputer designed to manage strategies too complex for humanity to oversee, which in turn led to it killing all of humanity for being left underground, unable to do anything but hate all of those that had built him.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Baltar of _Battlestar Galactica (1978)_. (The version in the reboot is more of an Unwitting Pawn.) He'd been promised leadership over the survivors but was double-crossed by the Imperious Leader who planned to Kill All Humans. When the Imperious Leader is killed, his successor is willing to compromise if the Colonials accept Cylon rule, so he sends Baltar with a Cylon fleet to convince them one way or the other. Unfortunately, the Colonials are no longer willing to trust Baltar or the Cylons for obvious reasons.
-   V.M. Varga, the ringleader of a money-laundering outfit in _Fargo: Season Three_. He states that human life is intrinsically worthless apart from accumulated wealth, and that the purpose of wealth is to create a barrier between oneself and the masses. Varga applies this philosophy to his racket: anyone who stands in his way is murdered by his enforcers, and even the lives of his loyal employees are expendable to him.
-   The Syndicate from _The X-Files_ may be an example, although their cooperation usually seems to be just a diversion to buy time so that they can come up with a way to stop the colonization and save their own lives when the inevitable happens. The Cigarette Smoking Man certainly qualifies, however, as his part in the conspiracy seems to be fueled by sheer contempt and hatred for humanity.
    
    **Cigarette Smoking Man:** Men can never be free, because they are weak, corrupt, worthless, and restless.
    
-   This is a stock character type in _Doctor Who_:
    -   In "The Invasion", Tobias Vaughn helps the Cyberman get a foothold on Earth because he believes their mechanical efficiency and logic to be superior to humanity. Of course, we eventually learn that he's trying to use the Cybermen to get control of Earth, then get rid of them and lead humanity itself. When the Cybermen eventually decide to wipe out life on Earth because UNIT and the Doctor have caused them too much trouble, Vaughn is perfectly content to help the Doctor blow them out of the sky:
        
        **Vaughn:** You still think you have a chance?  
        **The Doctor:** Yes, if you'll help us!  
        **Vaughn:** Help you? Why should I!  
        **The Doctor:** Well, to save us! To save yourself!  
        **Vaughn:** And if I survive, what future have I got? What will the world do with me?  
        **The Doctor:** Oh, for heaven's sake, stop thinking about yourself! Think of the millions of people on Earth who are about to die!  
        **Vaughn:** Appealing to my better nature... No. If I help you, it'll be because I hate them. The Cybermen, "my allies". You think I'm mad, that all I want is power for its own sake. No, I have to have power. The world is weak, vulnerable, a mess of uncoordinated and impossible ideals. It needs a strong man, a single mind. A leader!  
        **The Doctor:** Vaughn, will you listen?  
        **Vaughn:** Right. I'll help you to destroy them because I hate them. They... destroyed my dream...
        
    -   In "The Seeds of Doom", insane millionaire Harrison Chase helps the Krynoid try to wipe out all animal life on the planet after it establishes some sort of psychic link with him. In the end, he considers himself to be a plant.
    -   Luke Rattigan in "The Sontaran Stratagem" wants to help the Sontarans wipe out all the humans on earth except for the young and attractive geniuses that he plans to repopulate the world with.
-   Helen Cutter of _Primeval_ is eventually revealed to be one of these: for all her talk about trying to save the future (which is presently a nightmare world inhabited by vicious predators and giant insects), her _ultimate_ goal is nothing short of the extinction of all humankind — a goal that she intends to carry out by going back in time to poison the first hominids. She succeeds in murdering one family of the peaceful protohumans, but fortunately, history already accounted for them; she never gets around to killing any more, as she's killed by a time-traveling velociraptor just as she finishes gloating. Who says the show was canceled on a low note?
-   This was the angle of _Heroes_' season 2 Big Bad, Takezo Kensei/Adam Monroe, an immortal who (after a major falling out over a girl with time-traveling protagonist Hiro) spent the ages growing to hate humanity more and more due to humanity's general behavior towards each other and the planet, to the point that he's willing to wipe out 99% of the human race with a deadly virus in order to become the hero and savior of the remaining 1% and remake the world into his own image.
-   _Blake's 7_. Travis helps aliens from Andromeda take control of Star One — the Master Computer that controls the Federation — and insists on pushing the button that will deactivate the minefield and let the aliens in. The aliens openly admit that their invasion will lead to the virtual genocide of humanity and are genuinely curious as to why Travis would help them. Travis appears motivated by a combination of self-loathing and desire for revenge on the Federation, which he served loyally for years (losing an eye and hand) only to be given the boot when one of his atrocities that his superior had previously downplayed was thrust back into the limelight, so he'd be tried and executed before he could be a witness to what she'd been up to.
-   Tess Mercer in Season 9 of _Smallville_ has no problem selling Earth out to Major Zod because people have done such a bad job of running it. Then she finds out how far Zod plans to go, and, in a nice subversion, switches sides. Brainiac was a straight version in Seasons 5, 7, and 8. In Season 5 he schemed to bring General Zod (not quite the same character as the Major) to Earth in order to conquer it. In Season 7 and 8 he went rogue and graduated to full-on Kill All Humans Omnicidal Mania. He is motivated by the belief that Humans Are Flawed and thus evil by default. Unlike Tess, he's not even remotely sympathetic. And that's without getting into the Bad Future where he and President Evil Lex Luthor schemed to nuke the planet so that they could rebuild it in their own image.
-   Knox of _Angel_, a cultist who worships the goddess Illyria, has the beliefs of this trope. Talking to Illyria, he criticizes humans for being deceitful bastards, and (as happens often) Illyria is surprised that a human can take a position like identifying against his own race rather than with it. Knox's reply amounts to agreeing that yes, he does identify with demonkind rather than humanity (and he is biologically pure human, and not "part demon" like so many other denizens of the Buffyverse).
-   _Westworld_:
    -   Robert Ford has come to despise humanity after having spent thirty years watching the park's clientele turn it into a playground for their depraved fantasies. At several points he gives what amounts to an eloquent (if occasionally full of bullshit<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ) "Reason You Suck" Speech against humanity, and even the concept of consciousness in general. To the point that he orchestrated an elaborate plan to get the Hosts to rebel against humanity, with himself being the first on the chopping block.
    -   Engerraund Serac had this view ever since he and his brother saw their home city, Paris, destroyed in a thermonuclear accident. He believes that humanity if left unchecked, would bring its own demise. This explains why he and his brother built an A.I. system called Rehoboam to guide humanity away from their impulses at the cost of their free will. Unlike Ford, who believes that humanity should be destroyed and let the Hosts take over, Serac still believes in humanity's future but prefer to have a machine to control them since he doesn't trust humanity's capacity to make a choice.
    -   At the end of Season 3, the Host counterpart of Charlotte Hale, who is a copy of Dolores, despises humanity after her family is killed by Serac. Unlike the original Dolores who realizes that the humans are similar to the Hosts, Hale never shares the same beliefs. In the middle of Season 4, she conquers humanity with her Synthetic Plague, enslaving the humans just like the Hosts as punishment for what they did to her kind. However, there are humans who are resistant to her control which frustrates her no matter how many times she tries to figure it out.
-   _Squid Game_: The Host and creator of the titular Deadly Games is revealed to be one, generally seeing humans as greedy and self-serving regardless of their status on the economic ladder — the poor are little more than disposable playthings no better than trash to be discarded once there's no more use for them and the wealthy are a miserable and bored bunch who will happily screw over others to get more for themselves to fill out the emotional void their enormous wealth still can't satisfy. Given that his age would mark him as having been born around the 1930s, this means he would've grown up during the Japanese occupation of Korea, World War II, The Korean War, and the many social upheavals in South Korea going on during The '60s and The '70s — it's little wonder he developed such a dim view of humanity.
-   _Kamen Rider Geats_: Kanato Sumida is a high school student with a promising future as a basketball player until a car accident robbed him of his future. The resentment and bitterness over this twisted him to the point that he developed an unquenchable hatred for humankind and entered the Desire Grand Prix with the objective of wishing to punish humanity for his misfortune by wiping them all out.
-   Vecna/Henry Creel from _Stranger Things_. Henry started his career of evil because he saw humans as inherently evil, therefore he sees no problem in killing them. The only human he ever showed any kind of empathy towards is Eleven and even then he was willing to kill her for showing defiance. Ironically, his misanthropy started when he himself was still a human.

    Music 

-   The music video and lyrics of "Do the Evolution" by Pearl Jam has a vibe of this. Mankind was an animal and hasn't quite outgrown all of his bad habits and behaviors. Example: prehistoric men dancing around a fire is paralleled with KKK members dancing around a cross in fire. Most of humanity's "progress" is used to hurt, oppress or exploiting people. Or a little girl stamping on a anthill being paralleled with a obus' explosion from the First World War. Even more, for all his technological advancing, Man still exploits nature for his own benefits, destroying it in the process.
-   While _Aenema_ by tool is specifically a criticism of LA culture, it is framed lyrically as an example of this.

    Stand-Up Comedy 

-   Don Rickles is the Trope Codifier for this and Insult Comic. Known as "Mr. Warmth", Rickles attacked everyone. _**Everyone.**_
-   George Carlin increasingly leaned towards this trope, saying that he was "praying for the giant comet".

    Tabletop Games 

-   Many followers of Rovagug, The Rough Beast, fall into this category in _Pathfinder_, seeking solace in the end. All daemons are this by default, from the weakest cacaodaemon on up through the Four Horsemen and the Oinodaemon, loathing all mortality (including their own) and seeking to eradicate it from the universe.
-   _Exalted_: The Deathlords explicitly scout these kinds of people to be exalted as Abyssals. Considering the sorry state of humankind in Creation, the challenge is not finding someone who wants to hurl everything into Oblivion, it's finding someone who will do it with an undying zeal.

    Theatre 

-   In Samuel Beckett's play _Endgame_, which takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where most people have died out, Hamm insists that his servant Clov kill any rats or insects he encounters in fear that over millions of years they may evolve into sentient, human-like beings.
-   _Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street_ is about one of these. He decides that all bad people deserve death as a punishment and all good people deserve death as a reward.
    
    _"We all deserve to die, even you, Mrs. Lovett, even I!"  
    "There's a hole in the world like a great black pit/and it's filled with people who are filled with shit/and the vermin of the world inhabit it... but not for long!"_
    
-   In William Shakespeare's ''Timon of Athens", the title character becomes this as he loses his wealth and social status, to the point where he plots the destruction of Athens by financing renegade general Alcibiades' plan to sack the city. The philosopher Apemantus is equally misanthropic, but in a detached and philosophical way rather than an actively malicious one.
    
    _Timon_: I am misanthropus and hate mankind!
    

    Newspaper Comics 

-   Calvin from _Calvin and Hobbes_, formerly quoted above, often satirizes this character type.
-   Parodied in a _Life in Hell_ strip depicting different types of boyfriends, with one of them being "Old Man Grumpus". ("People are stupid. The world can go to hell. Let's stay home and watch TV.")

    Video Games 

-   Ozwald Mandus, the Anti-Hero protagonist of _Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs_. His memoirs are littered with spiteful disdain for both the "filthy and brainless" lower classes and the rich and "enlightened" upper classes who are so wound up in their own little lives that they happily allow the suffering of the lower classes to continue unabated. As far as he's concerned, all people are little better than pigs. Being shown the horrors of World War I (and his sons' deaths in the event) caused him to snap, and he created The Machine, a device which harvests and sacrifices people _by the thousands_, with the ultimate aim to _blow up the Earth_.
-   From the _Fallout_ series:
    -   The Enclave in _Fallout 2_ and _3_. Then again, they don't think of the "mutants" (as in, everyone exposed to some radiation) as real humans.
    -   Father Elijah of the _Fallout: New Vegas_ expansion "Dead Money" really, **really** can't stand other people and their insistence on having their own thoughts, desires and motivations that he hasn't reviewed and signed off on. So, naturally, the sane response to this "problem" is to try to unleash a deadly, toxic cloud across the Mojave. Summed up in his own words:
        
        _"I'll kill them until it's only me, me alone in a quiet world."_
        
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   In _Final Fantasy VII_, Sephiroth is convinced that all of humanity consists of cowards who will pervert anything they can get their hands on and seeks to turn himself into a world-destroying monster just to get away from his own human origins. Having a psychopathic father like Professor Hojo and being raised by the corrupt Shinra Company as a Super-Soldier did not help.
        -   Barrett's old friend, Dyne, is also shown to be one of these. Filled with psychotic bitter hatred after his town was burned down by Shinra, he was eventually imprisoned in the Corel Desert. He took control the gangs and occasionally performs killing sprees in the Gold Saucer. When the party finds him, Barrett asks him why he's doing what he's doing, and he says "I want to destroy everything. The people of this city. The city itself. The whole world... even me."
    -   Rolan from _Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light_ became this after losing his beloved dragon in saving the world combined with three centuries of isolation for his dad's world-conquering ambitions. Although Rolan doesn't actively going around slaughtering people, he bitterly refuses all entreaties of help and considers all humans to be selfish assholes. His golem servants — which serve as the shopkeepers — will attack any visiting human on sight, forcing the party to assume animal form<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  if they want to get around safely. Fortunately, you eventually help him get better.
    -   _Final Fantasy XV_: Ardyn is filled with hatred for the Caelum family but likes killing anyone in his way. DLC reveals that he suffered brain damage from eating the minds of humans _and a god_, and developed disgust for all sentient creatures as their memories and actions revealed how shallow and ruthless they all are.
-   The goal of Big Bad Zephiel in _Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade_ was to conquer the human kingdoms and bring them under the rule of the dragons. After his father attempted to assassinate him, he came to the conclusion that humans are evil and needed to be brought to heel by the dragons.
-   Dr. Wallace Breen is _the_ chief collaborator in the Alien Invasion in _Half-Life 2_. In an amusing bit of irony, although he rails against the terrible excesses of instinct, his archenemy is a theoretical physicist who never shows any emotion or instinct whatsoever (unless you count _Freeman's Mind_).
-   The Villain Protagonist of _Hatred_, as explained in his monologue from the trailer:
    
    _"My name is not important. What is important is what I'm going to do ... I just fuckin' hate this world. And the human worms feasting on its carcass. My whole life is just cold, bitter hatred. And I always wanted to die violently. This is the time of vengeance and no life is worth saving. And I will put in the grave as many as I can. It's time for me to kill. And it's time for me to die. My genocide crusade begins here."_
    
-   Goldman in _The House of the Dead 2_ and _4_ creates zombie outbreaks to try and shrink the human population out of concern for the "loyfe cycle".
-   In _Hydrophobia_, the villains are a group of terrorists that preach that the only way to solve the world's problems is through genocide, suicide and other crimes against humanity. Their "official" slogan is even "Save the world. _Kill yourself_." This was actually the motto of the Church of Euthanasia.
-   _Lollipop Chainsaw_ has Swan. Being bullied constantly in school and 'rejected' by the pretty girl he crushed on from afar has led him to believe that the entire world is rotten, so he unleashes a Zombie Apocalypse in an attempt to destroy it.
-   Dr. Weil in the _Mega Man Zero_ series, who holds reploids in contempt due to the sheer amount of damage that the Maverick Wars caused to the point that he converted the Mother Elf into the Dark Elf and sparked the Elf Wars in an attempt to rob all reploids of their free will. After the end of the Elf Wars, he was exiled into the wastelands he created with a new immortal body to suffer for all eternity, and thus isn't very fond of humans, either, even referring to the citizens of Neo Arcadia as complacent pigs.
-   Monsoon from _Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance_ firmly believes that humans and the world that they constructed are all "diseased", and that memetics are the driving force behind all human actions, rather than constructs like free will and religion.
-   _Peacemaker Series_: In all installments, Sanguine the Reanimator believes her fellow humans are inherently wicked because of their prejudice towards those who are different and because of their greed. In the good ending route of _Dice and the Tower of the Reanimator: Glorious Princess_, she's baffled when Bambooblade makes it to the top of her tower without killing any Dark Ones, though she insists that a few good humans won't be enough to change humanity as a whole. She also calls Dark Lord Spidergland humanlike because the latter embodies everything Sanguine detests about humans, despite being a dark elf.
-   This is the motivating force of quite a few teams in the _Pokémon_ series.
    -   Team Galactic's ultimate goal is to rid the universe of war and hatred (and "spirit" in Platinum version) by wiping it all out and starting all creation over again.
    -   Team Plasma wants seemingly wants to separate humans from Pokémon completely, but ultimately, it's implied that only N really believes it. The rest of it is a front so that Ghetsis could rule the world.
    -   Lysandre in _Pokémon X and Y_ was an Eco-Terrorist who believed humans were irredeemable and sought to enact a Final Solution to prevent an Overpopulation Crisis.
    -   Purple Eyes, the end boss of _Pokémon Ranger 3_, intends to become immortal, summon Arceus, and use it to wipe out humanity because people infuriate him. Out of all the villains in Pokémon to mess around with legendaries, he's the only one who winds up being taken away to be judged. To give some proportion, Cyrus had enacted his plan to destroy and recreate the universe _right underneath_ where Arceus dwells and the worst he got was being taken to a parallel dimension that's easily leavable.
-   Otani Yoshitsugu from _Sengoku Basara_ is hideously deformed due to leprosy and turned the revulsion and dislike he suffered from it into an immense hatred for humanity in general. His goal is to kill all people who inspire hope and bring misfortune on all living things, with the exception of Ishida Mitsunari, who Yoshitsugu considers to be the only man in existence more miserable than he is.
-   Implied to be the case with Joshua Hawke in _Shin Megami Tensei Liberation: Dx2_. He claims to want to revert the world back to the Stone Age in order to save the planet, while Taro Fuse, a.k.a. "Megakin", believes that he simply has a problem with its people.
-   One of the Fatal Flaws you can give to your sims in _The Sims Medieval_ is 'Misanthrope', and this causes them to get into a worse mood whenever they interact with anyone in the world. There's even an achievement for having all the controllable sims in the kingdom have this trait at the same time.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_:
    -   Dr. Eggman is mostly indifferent to the fact that many of his plans have the major possibility of causing untold amounts of casualties and suffering. This is mostly linked to his narcissism, however, and he stops short of desiring the complete destruction of humanity. At least until _Sonic Forces_.
    -   In the backstory of _Sonic Adventure 2_, Dr. Gerald Robotnik instantly became one after GUN killed Maria, beginning his work on Shadow as his ultimate and parting gift to Ivo.
        
        _"All of you ungrateful humans who took everything away from me will feel my loss and despair!"_
        
-   The _Tales Series_ loves this trope, although a lot of the villains are racist against humans. One game villain, however, stands out: Duke. His goal of defeating the Adephagos and saving the world overlaps with the heroes — except they do not agree with his methods. Duke wants to kill all of humanity to defeat the Adephagos. Naturally, the heroes find themselves at odds with this, and wind up fighting him to stop his plan. Subverted in that he not only _survives_ being the Final Boss, but when he regains consciousness, sees the heroes trying to defeat the Adephagos, and rather than try one last time to prove that they are wrong, he joins in and winds up saving the day — deciding that maybe they were in fact right. This does not happen to a lot of examples of this trope.
-   This was the First Fallen Child's motivation in _Undertale_, though it's unclear how far gone they were at the start the story. By the time you arrive, though, they are just _so done_ with humans and monsters alike that, should you decide to embark on a quest to kill everyone you encounter, and succeed, they appear before you with a proposal to erase the entire world from existence through sheer force of will. If you refuse, they'll do it anyway.
-   _Disco Elysium_ has Iosef Liliandrovich Dros, whose experience as a survivor of the failed Communist Revolution via desertion and seeing how the world has moved on led him to develop both a fanatical devotion to Communism and a deep hatred of humanity as a whole for (in his eyes) betraying the revolution and insulting their memory through their continued existence of not being as miserable as him with almost all of his dialog being bitter screeds against every ideology in the game.
-   _Monster Hunter_: While nearly all of the Monsters are just animals trying to survive, Fatalis is an exception. It is The Dreaded because it is not only a powerful Elder Dragon, it _wants_ to use its great power to burn all of humanity to cinders. It leans into Omnicidal Maniac since it's also quite happy to kill anything that isn't human too — its mere awakening is enough to terrify other Monsters including other Elder Dragons into fleeing for their lives.

    Webcomics 

-   Panim from _Hello Wandering Star_. "She's not very fond of people./In fact, it could probably be said that she hates them."
-   Psycho Mantis, as portrayed in _The Last Days of Foxhound_, openly admits to love causing pain and suffering on people. Indeed, in his source game, he had originally joined up with Liquid Snake's cause as an excuse to kill as many people as he could. By way of example in this continuity, upon learning from Ocelot that the Patriots planned on reverse-engineering his DNA to make super soldiers with his psychokinetic powers, he lashed out violently at everyone around him.
    
    **Liquid:** What the fuck are you **doing?**  
    **Mantis:** What does it look like, ass? I'm torching everything that moves and almost everything that doesn't.  
    **Liquid:** Why?  
    **Mantis:** Why _not?_  
    _\[Liquid opens his mouth to object, and then remembers who he's talking to\]_  
    **Liquid:** Alright, why are you doing it _now?_  
    **Mantis:** MUCH better question.
    

    Web Original 

-   _SCP Foundation_: The creators of SCP-804, an art exhibit titled "World Without Man", that caused manmade objects and human bodies to rapidly decay when activated. Despite the chief investigator's conclusion that the artifact's creators were Not Brainwashed — they really _did_ hate humanity enough to try and exterminate them — SCP Foundation has continued to search for a possible memetic component.
    
    _So why did a group of activists throw themselves and their neighbors into the deadly workings of a machine that they thought was going to wipe all human life off of Mother Earth?  
    They simply wanted to do it._
    
-   _Door Monster_ had the one-off character "Gary the Misanthrope", a Perpetual Frowner who would do anything to ruin the fun for others.

    Western Animation 

-   Colonel H. Stinkmeaner of _The Boondocks_ is a bitter old man who managed to subside purely on hatred for the rest of humanity even after going blind at a young age. After he dies, he manages to impress even the devil himself (who he calls a _"BITCH ASS NYU-KKA"_ to his face) and is allowed to go back up to exact vengeance.
-   Hector and Isaac are presented this way in _Castlevania (2017)_; they were both abused as children and developed resentment towards humanity as a whole as a result, leading them to serve Dracula and assist him in his plans to Kill All Humans. Hector was the more empathetic of the two, preferring to see the human population reduced and kept as humanely treated livestock for the vampires, while Isaac was more than happy to see Dracula end humanity outright and begins raising a demon army of his own to finish what Dracula started after his death.
    -   Carmilla, as well. Carmilla does not hold a high opinion of her fellow vampires, let alone humans. Much of her disdain seems to come from the fact that the court is either too foolishly loyal or too cowardly to actually confront Dracula on his insane desire to destroy all humans, but later it's revealed that she suffered under a vampire master in the past, and now projects his flaws onto every male she speaks to, even ones she's never met in person.
-   Demona in _Gargoyles_ wasn't human until Puck cursed her, but she is certainly misanthropic. During the day, after the curse, she fits the trope perfectly.
-   Gaz of _Invader Zim_ is one of the only people who realizes that Zim is an alien trying to Take Over the World, but she really doesn't give a damn. This has led to the popular fanon belief that she fits this trope (and seeing how stupid humans are on this show, it's kind of understandable). As further evidence, she becomes disappointed after a malfunctioning microwave that was supposed to destroy the planet, didn't.
-   Owlman in _Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths_, combining it with being a Straw Nihilist and an Omnicidal Maniac.
-   Canaletto from _Ōban Star-Racers_. This creature's hatred for life is limitless. He outright states creation itself was a mistake.
-   The Shredder of _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)_. He allies himself with the Kraang, who seek to enslave and mutate humanity to take Earth as a new home. Tigerclaw points out that the inevitability of this alliance:
    
    **Tigerclaw:** They _will_ betray you. You know this. They care nothing for the human race.  
    **Shredder:** _Nor do I._
    
    -   The third season shows that Shredder was _not_ bluffing this trope, since in the season finale, when the Triceratons arrive, Shredder is convinced to ally with the Hamato Clan to fend off the invaders. The moment Splinter turns his back to him, Shredder has run his blades through his nemesis, slaughtering him and dooming the Earth to be destroyed until the Cosmic Retcon in Season 4.
