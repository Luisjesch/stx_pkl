_Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed_

It's said that eyes are the windows to the soul, and in fiction, their color is often the first way to hint at a character's true nature. In particular, characters who have gold and yellow-colored eyes tend to have some form of supernatural origin or powers that place them above normal humans.

In the West, this tends to appear on supernatural characters who have feline or lupine traits, so, understandably, they're often accompanied by werewolf-like powers. In Japan, this probably traces back to legends of _kitsune_ (foxes) and their naturally golden eyes. It was said that a human possessed by a fox would gain gold eyes, and that a child born to a fox and a human would possess them as well. Because _kitsune_ were also shapeshifters, this often shows up when characters change their forms, as the first indicator they are shapeshifting.

It is also found around the world in many other contexts: in tales of genies, witches, and other mythological beings, where they cannot hide their golden or two-tone eye colors in animal form.

In the sorting algorithm of "Uh-Oh" Eyes, gold eyes fall one step below Red Eyes, Take Warning, since it's entirely possible for the character to just be a trickster rather than evil. Gold eyes are also harder to distinguish from "normal"-colored eyes, and hence can add more of an element of surprise if The Reveal shows a character to be something other than what they initially appear to be.

A subtrope of Technicolor Eyes and Mark of the Supernatural. Compare Yellow Eyes of Sneakiness. Has less to do with _GoldenEye_ than you'd think.

**It should be noted that this trope is NOT for characters who just have eyes of this color, but rather for when the color actually indicates the character is supernatural in nature. Please do not add characters who just happen to have eyes of this color without the proper reason behind it. If there are only mundane characters who have this eye color in the work (that aren't mistaken for supernatural because of it), the work does not use this trope.**

    Anime & Manga 

-   Morgan Le Fay, the shape shifting fairy from the _Ah! My Goddess_ movie, is shown with golden eyes. In the manga, Hild and Lind can both manifest these as part of their Game Face. It indicates that they are drawing on their full power rather than holding back as they usually do.
-   In _Angelic Layer_, the Angel, Blanche, has yellow eyes, and her operator's partner's Angel, Shirahime, has red eyes. Both are some of the hardest opponents in the series, and two of three Angels to use Hyper Mode (in the manga, only Blanche can use it).
-   _ARIA_: Cait Sith qualifies here, being the King of Cats and all that.
-   The Armored Titan, from _Attack on Titan_, matches this with Glowing Eyes of Doom, for striking effect. Reiner is notably the only character with amber eyes, easily written off as brown eyes since he's the reliable Team Dad. However, it's one of the early hints of his true nature.
-   The Kowloon Children in _Black Blood Brothers_ have gold irises and black scleras, as well as pointy ears and claws, making them seem more feral.
-   _Black Butler_: All shinigami have gold/green eyes, such that it can be used as proof that someone is a current or former "god of death;" all of them are fairly neutral, but are also shown to be very powerful when crossed. Sebastian has caramel-colored eyes, close enough to brown that most characters don't remark on it but just _off_ enough to remind the audience that he's different, and Claude Faustus from the second season of the anime has them as well. However, when Sebastian goes all out, his eyes turn magenta.
-   _Black Clover_:
    -   Yuno has amber eyes and was born blessed with tremendous amounts of mana and powerful magic.
    -   Licht has gold eyes and is a powerful elf mage who wields rare Light Magic.
-   _Bleach_ has a couple of characters that fit the symbolism of golden eyes:
    -   Yoruichi and Komamura have golden eyes, reflecting their animal-connections. Yoruichi spends a lot of time transformed into the form of a black cat and Komamura is an anthropomorphic wolf.
    -   Hollows are human spirits who have lost their hearts and thus are often ruled by their desires and instincts. Hollows and Vizards (Shinigami with Hollow powers) using their masks usually have yellow eyes surrounded by black.
    -   Arrancar aren't supposed to have a second resureccion. Ulquiorra does. Not only is why a mystery, but the form changes the nature of his reiatsu so that it feels different to normal reiatsu. Unsurprisingly, his eyes change from green to gold to reflect the added mystery of this second form.
-   Yukito, Sakura's crush in _Cardcaptor Sakura_, has golden eyes behind his glasses and silver hair. These eyes are the first indication that there is more to him than he appears. Yue, his true form, has silver eyes. The same applies to his counterpart, Ruby Moon.
-   Ceres, the eponymous character of _Ceres, Celestial Legend_ has gold eyes, and is a _Tennyo_, a type of Asian fairy. Whereas Aya, her descendant/alter-ego, does not.
-   _Chainsaw Man_: Makima, as the Control Devil, is incredibly powerful with strange golden eyes.
-   Chrno/Chrono in _Chrono Crusade_ has golden eyes while in his demon form, although, when he's in his more common, human-like form, they're red. He's not evil, but obviously supernatural, and _does_ have a bad temper when provoked.
-   In _Claymore_, the titular "Silver-Eyed Witches" have them change color (and form Hellish Pupils) when they release a certain amount of their power. On occasion, a Claymore who's _really_ pushing it will combine this with iris-only Glowing Eyes of Doom.
    -   Likewise, the demons they hunt (and have been implanted with) always have golden eyes.
-   _Code Geass_:
    -   These appear on C.C., an immortal young woman who can grant a power known as 'geass'.
    -   There's Jeremiah Gottwald, who has _orange_ eyes. Later on when he gets his Hollywood Cyborg upgrade, his Geass-canceler eye is both cybernetic and green.
-   _Darker than Black_: The aptly named Amber. Her remuneration is getting younger, and she has a limited ability to see the future.
-   In _Delicious in Dungeon_, Touden siblings Falin and Laios have gold colored eyes. Both of them are capable of using magic.
-   In _Devilman Lady_, Jun's eyes changing from brown to gold signal her transformation into a Devilman.
-   Guilmon from _Digimon Tamers_ has a right to have yellow eyes, as he's a one-of-a-kind, fan-made Digimon, goes feral when sensing danger, and carries an uber-destructive computer virus inside himself.
-   Krad of _D.N.Angel_ is a case of Curtains Match the Window and is most definitely not human or a good guy.
-   _Dragon Ball Z_:
    -   Zarbon, Frieza's Bishōnen right-hand man, has gold-colored eyes. He's able to shapeshift into a single second form, which resembles a large, wrinkly, reptilian ogre.
    -   GT also features Super Saiyan 4, which is preceeded by a transformation into a Super Oozaru form and has golden eyes once it's completed.
    -   Broly has these in his Wrathful state in _Dragon Ball Super: Broly_.
-   _Excel♡Saga_:
    -   Il Palazzo has yellow cat's eyes and though he's mostly just played as eccentric and crazy throughout most of the anime, in the manga, he's eventually shown to possess the power of teleportation, among other (far stranger) abilities.
    -   In the manga version, Doctor Kabapu has the same eyes, which hints at the fact that they're both from a long-lost ancient civilization.
-   In the anime adaptation of _From the New World_, village leader Shisei Kaburagi has golden Exotic Eye Designs.
-   _Fruits Basket_:
    -   Ayame Sohma has golden eyes, which is justified as he's possessed by the spirit of the Snake from the Eastern Zodiac.
    -   Kisa Sohma, who's possessed by the spirit of the Tiger, also has golden eyes as well as golden hair. Unfortunately for her, being a Japanese girl with such unusual eye and hair colors leads her to be bullied at school.
-   Played with in the manga version of _Fullmetal Alchemist_ and its direct adaptation _Brotherhood_. Van Hohenheim and his sons Edward and Alphonse Elric have golden eyes. This isn't supernatural in and of itself; however, it is an ethnic trait related to their heritage, and considering that this ethnicity has been supposedly extinct for hundreds of years, it serves as a clue to Van Hohenheim's immortality and Ed and Al's true origins.
    -   Downplayed in the loose 2003 anime adaptation. Ed and Al's eyes are still gold, but these are no longer mysterious ethnic traits. They are, however, inherited traits from Hohenheim's current vessel.
-   Tasuki of _Fushigi Yuugi_, who is initially portrayed with more of a wolf motif. The kitsune qualities and shapeshifting are trademarks of his comrade, Chichiri.
-   Yuki Nagato from _Haruhi Suzumiya_ has golden-brown eyes, which lends into her being a Humanoid Data User Interface but more importantly that even when compared to her counterparts (Ryoko Asakura and Emiri Kimidori are Curtains Match the Window with blue and green hair and eyes respectively), she's an incredibly powerful Humanoid Data User Interface.
-   Seine from _Hekikai No Aion_ has greenish-gold eyes and is a 300-year-old immortal girl who controls a black snake, who lives within her body called Aion.
-   Hilda in _Horus: Prince of the Sun_, due to her deal with Grunwald. However, she seems to retain them after Grunwald's defeat.
-   _Inuyasha_: The known dog\-Youkai of the show all have golden eyes: Inuyasha, Sesshoumaru, and Sesshoumaru's mother.
-   In the manga version of _Kamisama Kiss_ Tomoe has these (the anime changed them to purple). Of course, he's a Kitsune so it should come as no surprise he has them.
-   Saralegui from _Kyo Kara Maoh!_. He wears purple-tinted glasses to cover them, because having Gold Eyes means he's part of a very-near extinct race (that was sealed away) with extraordinary powers. His eyes glow blue whenever he's giving someone a 'hint', aka trying to possess them to do his bidding.
-   _Lyrical Nanoha_:
    -   The eyes of the Magitek Type Zero cyborgs turn gold when they're using their cyborg abilities. Including Subaru Nakajima, at one point, just before she goes ballistic. Considering that their creator Jail Scaglietti (who himself is an Artificial Human) also has them, perhaps it's deliberate.
    -   Fabia Crozelg of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid_ is introduced as a True Witch, someone that's explicitly mentioned to use a far rarer form of magic from the standard mages of the setting. In addition to her devil familiars, Flying Broomstick, and Robe and Wizard Hat, colored pages of the manga also show that she has golden eyes. It's also revealed that her ancestor was a Cat Girl.
-   Ruri Hoshino in _Martian Successor Nadesico_ has these as part of her implied kinda-sorta Artificial Human background and general Mysterious Waif\-iness.
-   In _Mao_, Nanoka's eyes turn gold whenever she uses her non-human abilities.
-   Similarly, for Coco of _Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch_, yellow eyes are just a racial trait, as mermaids are Colour-Coded for Your Convenience and those from different countries tend to have themed hair and eye colours. However, a Double Subversion occurs when this is used as a warning with orange-eyed Man Behind the Man Sara: she's a mermaid princess too.
-   In _Mobile Suit Gundam 00_, the eyes of Innovators and their Artificial Human counterparts, the Innovades shine gold and exhibit a moving weblike pattern<small>◊</small> when utilizing their quantum brainwaves. Curiously, the Human Reform League's Super Soldiers don't display this, despite also using quantum brainwaves. However, their eyes are a darker, more mundane gold by default, without the glowing.
-   Both Mikoto and Reito of _My-HiME_ have these, and while it's not too unusual for that world (where the heroine has red hair and _purple_ eyes), later, it turns out that they are a Laser Guided Tyke Bomb and the object of Demonic Possession respectively, as well as serving as an early clue that they're brother and sister.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Naruto himself acquires these later on — when in Sage mode, his eyes turn golden, although they're slitted sideways. However, this has more to do with his affinity for toads, instead of the fox inside him.
    -   Also Orochimaru, true to his snake-like appearance and nature.
-   The Natsume family from _Natsume's Book of Friends_ seem to have this; both main character Takashi and his deceased grandmother Reiko had these (they're both very powerful in the seeing Youkai department). At least one, and possibly both of them, were bullied with the name "Kitsune eyes" due to this.
-   Hawk-Eye Mihawk from _One Piece_ has golden-orange eyes like a raptor's, and while he's not a Devil Fruit user, there's something... off about him and his abilities, as if he's been tainted with death.
-   The adopted Nightray brothers, Gilbert and Vincent, in _PandoraHearts_. Gilbert is a Baskerville, and almost became Glen's next host, while Vincent combines this with Red Eyes, Take Warning due to his heterochromia. Both cause distortions in the world around them, due to having a connection to the power of the Abyss.
-   In _Pet Shop of Horrors_, Count D has one golden eye, and his grandfather has both eyes being golden.
-   Mytho from _Princess Tutu_ has golden eyes. He's not evil, but he _is_ supernatural — he's the Prince from a fairytale.
-   Eiko Magami from _Project A-Ko_ has amber-colored eyes. Her weirdness is evident right off the bat.
-   _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_: Madoka's eyes turn from pink to gold when she ascends to godhood. In this case, it indicates that she's _especially_ supernatural (the other magic-using characters have Curtains Match the Window eye colors).
-   _Rurouni Kenshin_:
    -   Whenever Kenshin goes into "Battousai Mode", his eyes take on a yellowish hue, in contrast to their usual violet color, and at one point, this tells Kaoru what's going on instantly.
    -   His rival, Saito Hajime, however, is always shown with these. The historical, real person of Saito had brown eyes, but in _Rurouni Kenshin_, these are used to tie him to The Shinsengumi, who were commonly referred to as the "Wolves of Mibu".
-   _Sailor Moon_:
    -   Sailor Galaxia (Big Bad) has gold eyes to match her theme as the Golden Queen. Like several of the examples here, she's not evil so much as possessed.
    -   In the opposite direction, Helios (gentle priest) has gold eyes, possibly to represent his position as guardian of the Golden Crystal in the anime version, while Mamoru has it in the manga.
    -   Naoko originally planned Minako's blue eyes to turn golden when transformed.
-   In _Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas_, golden eyes (and hair) are the trademark of Hypnos and his children, the Dream Gods. They're all pretty much supernatural — and evil, with Hypnos serving as one of the primary antagonists of the manga's first half (arguably the Big Bad for good part of it).
-   _Saiyuki_:
    -   In the manga, beings with golden eyes are labelled as heretics and are seen as dangerous enough for the Powers That Be to lock them up or, at the very least, shackle them. Son Goku, War Prince Nataku, and War Prince Homura all have golden eyes, though, in the latter's case, only one of them is golden.
    -   In the manga, Hakkai's youkai form has one golden eye, the other being a false one.
    -   In the manga, the people Hazel brought back from the dead have yellow eyes. They are perfectly normal and nice people post-resurrection unless you happened to be a youkai.
-   Tiara's One-Winged Angel form in _Shamanic Princess_ has golden eyes _with a black circumference in the middle_.
-   Medusa of _Soul Eater_ has these, likely to underline her connection to snakes. Death the Kid's eyes are _not_ this, as in fact it is his hair which indicates his true nature.
-   _Sword Art Online_:
    -   Kirito's eyes will turn from dark grey to bright yellow in moments when his determination is at its peak such as in the moments before felling Heathcliff, breaking through the World Tree's guardians, or landing a decisive blow on Death Gun.
    -   Fanatio Synthesis Two has yellow eyes, as befits someone whose main element is light.
-   _Tenchi Muyo!_:
    -   Ryoko has golden eyes, tying into the demonic/supernatural aspect of her character. Her name is even stated to mean "spirit caller" at one point.
    -   Ryo-Ohki also has yellow eyes, both in her cabbit and humanoid forms.
-   Viral in _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_. Word of God says he's a cat/shark hybrid, so it makes sense.
-   _Texhnolyze_: While anime basically avoids unrealistic hair and eye colours, Ran and Kano have yellow eyes. Ran is a Seer and Kano is a wannabe god.
-   When Bu-ling of _Tokyo Mew Mew_ transforms into Mew Pudding, her eyes turn golden.
-   CLAMP's series _Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-_:
    -   A vampires' eyes go gold and slitted when they use their powers. One Doujinshi has that world's version of Fuuma comment on this by saying that he and his sort-of-love-interest Kamui "match" now, prompting Kamui to throw him across the room. In the series proper, Fai's remaining eye turns from blue to gold when he becomes a vampire.
    -   Fai also goes a little further with this trope when he gives up his remaining magic in Nihon to pay for Kurogane's artificial arm and his remaining eye turns from blue to permanent gold. It's his magic-less eye color and indicates his full transformation into a vampire.
-   Miyu from _Vampire Princess Miyu_ originally had brown eyes, but once she became a vampire, they became gold. She can still use magic to revert hem to their original brown to mix better with the crowd.
-   The heroine of the anime version of _Witchblade_ gets these (with black scleras) when she accesses the eponymous Artifact of Doom's power.
-   The wolves of _Wolf's Rain_ all have amber/golden eyes in human form — except for Kiba, whose human form has pale blue eyes to denote his Chosen One status.
-   Fuuma's eyes in _X/1999_ are gold colored, and it's only after the Wham Episode that we realize what this was hinting at. In the anime series, they're red, because the Spoiler Opening gave away the _wham_ of the Wham Episode right in the first episode.
-   The Seiryuu in _Yona of the Dawn_ who wield the power of the dragon's eyes. The current one Shin-ah usually hides them behind his mask.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_
    -   Judai (Jaden) in _Yu-Gi-Oh! GX_ gets golden eyes when his power as Haou/Supreme King awakens.
    -   Divine and Kiryu from _Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds_. A psychic and Dark Signer, respectively. Divine's also a Manipulative Bastard, while Kiryu's just plain nuts.
    -   In _Yu Gi Oh ARCV_, the Big Bad Zarc has these. They reflect his series-standard ability to talk with Duel spirits. Yuya's eyes also turn this color when he is possessed by Zarc.
-   Yoko Kurama in _YuYu Hakusho_ is a red-haired, green eyed young man in his human form, but as soon as he turns into his white-haired pretty boy alter ego, his eyes change color. Naturally enough, he's a _kitsune_.
    -   Also, you know that Itsuki isn't exactly a human psychic because of this trope and also because of his hair color. He's nowhere near a _kitsune_, though; he's a shadow demon called a _yaminade_.
    -   While possessed by his demon ancestor, Yusuke's eye color changes from their usual brown color to a gold color, at least in the anime.
    -   The creepy Elder Toguro. Though all his eyes represent is his demonic nature.
-   _Zatch Bell!_ himself has wide, saucepan-sized yellow eyes, although, being a demon, it might be excusable. It might be more to indicate his affinity, Lightning, as not all the Demons have Golden Eyes. Then again, it could be something else...

    Comic Books 

-   Lioness in _ATOM_ has yellow eyes thanks to her non-human heritage.
-   _ElfQuest_:
    -   Timmorn Yellow-Eyes has, obviously, yellow eyes, which he got from his father, who was a wolf, his mother being an elfin shapechanger, making him basically a half-elf half-wolf whose form can fluctuate.
    -   Rayek's is one of the few very magical Sun Folk. He possesses paralyzing and levitation powers and later flight.
-   The main character of the indie comic book _Finder_ has yellow eyes. He could be considered something of a trickster, being a nomadic "ninja do-gooder" in a largely city-bound world. (He also has an as-of-yet-unexplained Healing Factor.)
-   _The Flash_:
    -   Superhero Bart Allen (Impulse/Kid Flash II) has naturally golden eyes; this, along with his wild auburn hair, serves as a character marker. He's a bit of a devil-may-care type (hence the codename), but his heart's undoubtedly in the right place.
    -   Probably inherited from his evil ancestor, Professor Zoom, arch-nemesis of the Flash family. The critical difference in depiction is their personalities (physically, they have the _exact same eyes_, which is very unsettling, but that's it). Bart's joyful and friendly demeanour makes them bright like sunshine; Thawne is the exact opposite: his eyes burning like a raging wildfire — to the point where they sometimes turn reddish-orange. Bart's eyes can also turn into that fiery-orange color as well, but only under extreme rage or stress — it's a signifier that he isn't playing around anymore.
    -   His Evil Twin, Inertia. Thad can pull off some _stunning_ impressions of Bart's emotional body language (and that includes the famed Puppy-Dog Eyes as well) when the situation calls for it, but his eyes usually default to a sinister glow, as seen here.
-   _The Incredible Hulk_:
    -   The Guilt Hulk, one of Bruce Banner's many alternate personalities, and a purely malevolent one at that.
    -   The non-Banner Red Hulks as well, partly because it's part of their "demonic" look, and partly because of their association with fire.
-   Lucifer in _Lucifer_ has golden eyes, maybe the most justified case conceivable, as he's about as human as every star in creation put together.
-   The manipulative and often malevolent personification of Desire from _The Sandman (1989)_ is described as having "eyes tawny and sharp as yellow wine."
-   _Spider-Man_ villainess Paper Doll, a Loony Fan of celebrity Bobby Carr, has yellow pupils that are probably there just to make her extra creepy. Her main super-powers are the ability to flatten out her body, blend into her surroundings, "compress" her foes by enveloping them with herself, and administering lethal paper-cuts strong enough to slice through Spidey's webbing.
-   In _Violine_, Francois has these to indicate his mind reading powers. Violine has violet ones in contrast.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   Cheetah is often drawn with gold eyes to reflect the deal that she made for her power.
    -   _Wonder Woman (Rebirth)_: Circe has started opting for eerie bright yellow eyes as a subtle indicator of her immense power.
-   Shapeshifter Mystique of the _X-Men_ series is often shown with yellow eyes. So is her son Nightcrawler. Sabretooth is sometimes drawn with them as well.

    Fan Works 

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_: The newborn Manda has amber-gold eyes. The "supernatural" part becomes more relevant due to the hints that he might be Dr. Serizawa reincarnated.
-   In _The Butcher Bird_, Captain Grigori Vinci acquires these after implanting himself with the King's Heart, a biological augmentation he designed, and which he needed to recover from an Eye Scream delivered by Eustass Kid.
-   Kurosaki Karin gets these in the Bleach fanfic _Chasing The Moon_ whenever she uses her bankai's ultimate technique. The same thing happens with her sister, Kurosaki Yuzu, except with her, it's an example of Red Eyes, Take Warning.
-   In _Child of the Storm_, Harry's eyes start flashing gold when he gets angry and do so with increasing frequency as the story goes on. At first, it appears to be either his Asgardian powers kicking or the Phoenix Force, but eventually resolves into being a sign that he's using his Psychic Powers. Either way, you want to step lightly around him when he does it. Especially as it's occasionally accompanied by 'a dangerous double harmonic' even Harry himself finds rather unnerving, indicating that he doesn't have any conscious control over it (until the sequel, when he learns to use it at will as an intimidation tool).
    -   Once he fully embraces his powers in Chapter 60, they glow gold whenever he's about to do something big with his psychic abilities, though it's indicated that they don't necessarily have to and works as a sort of excess energy. Then, as he gets increasingly powerful in the sequel, they start burning golden-white, which generally means that he's about to try very hard to kill you.
-   Harry inherited those in _Dark Dynasty_, as his father is the Dark One. They slightly glow when he uses magic, too.
-   Creepy Child Aura from _Daughter of the Sun (ShoutFinder)_, who possesses a lot of knowledge and has the ability to see the future, is described as having pale gold eyes.
-   In _The Dragon That Will Pierce the Heavens_, a _One Piece_ and _Fairy Tail_ crossover, protagonist Hikari's eyes turn gold with reptilian slit pupils whenever she's upset or tapping into her Dragon Slayer abilities. This is normally a sign for her crew to either calm her down or get out of the way.
-   In _The Fable of Joyful Wing_, the wolf king and queen both have golden eyes no matter what form they're taking, marking them as spirits instead of ordinary animals or humans.
-   _Fate of the Clans_:
    -   The Servants Tamamo and Okada have amber eyes. Tamamo was also formerly the goddess Amaterasu. Having all nine tails would classify her as a Beast. The Servant Kiyohime's eyes are yellow.
    -   Mikoto is the only King with amber eyes.
    -   When Cú Chulainn goes off the deep end, the Servant's red irises have turned to a dull and lifeless yellow. This makes him look dead.
-   Kainatrol from _Futari Wa Pretty Cure Blue Moon_. She's got the animalistic connection (her Mind Control powers are based upon the concept of an animal tamer), she likes to be on top of things, and, sympathetic backstory or not, she's the most evil of the Quirky Miniboss Squad. Since everyone on Earth (known as the Land of Legends) has their Curtains Match the Window, naturally, Seira has yellow eyes, too, as does Kore by virtue of being Kainatrol's identical twin; neither is evil or even devious, however.
-   The Faux Affably Evil serpent Damballa in the _Horseshoes and Hand Grenades_ sidestory _Month of Sundays_ sports this in his human form. Damballa also shows hints of him being a Reality Warper due to him transforming the Narumi Detective Agency into a large circus tent, transforms _three_ Kamen Riders into evil dolls and summons a "never-ending box of popcorn" to watch the festivities.
-   In _In the Cards_, one of the numerous fan retellings of the story of _Baldur's Gate_ in written form, both the protagonist Zaerini and the antagonist Sarevok have golden eyes. This hints at their being siblings and mortal children of the god Bhaal and appears to be based on Sarevok's glowing yellow/gold eyes in the game (which both characters get here as Glowing Eyes of Doom).
-   In _The Keys Stand Alone: The Soft World_, Paul develops these after being struck by several bolts of lightning. They signify that he can now see magic and power sources. Eventually he learns to turn them on and off at will, which is fine with him because having “power sight” on all the time is incredibly distracting, and fine with the others because they make him look creepy.
-   In _A Knight's Tale as Inquisitor_, it is known that Flemeth and her daughters sport burning, golden-eyes with a dragon's pupil.
    -   After surviving the Mind Rape Nightmare Sequence inflicted on her by the Envy Demon to steal her body, Arturia begins sporting burning, glowing golden eyes with a dragon's pupil in the center. This leads to the Inquisition coming to the conclusion that she's one of Flemeth's daughters.
-   Minato Arisato in _A Necromancer's Wild Card_ has these instead of his regular gray eyes after he's resurrected by Eucliwood Hellscythe. He isn't sure why his eye color changed, though.
-   Ashley McFly of _Pretty Cure Perfume Preppy_ has slightly grayish-yellow eyes, which turn bright yellow with slitted cat-ish pupils when she becomes Leather Ashes.
-   In _Rising of the Sleeping Soldier_, the fact that Alucard's eyes are as blonde as his hair is cited as being unusual once Motoyasu notices them. Alucard immediately starts to worry that this would give away his Dhampyr nature, unsure how Melromarc would react to a vampire in their midst or if they even have them. he quickly covers it up by pointing out that unusual eye-color could be expected due genetics in alternate worlds, citing the King's purple eyes as an example.
-   _Seventh Endmost Vision_: while eyes are a general motif of the series, only one character has _gold_ in their eyes- the Big Bad. Lucrecia has a bizarre, Duality Motif version of this; the eye she stole from Ifalna has white clamping down on the naturally green pupil and the sclera turning gold, while her natural eye has the pupil turning gold while the sclera turns a hard, marble white. She only unveils it when she's ready to fight Barret. Interestingly, because the character has The Big Bad Wolf Animal Motif, the gold also harkens to the lupine descriptions above.
-   Subverted in _A Soul's Songbook: Out of Print_, a fanfic of _Soul Eater_. As mentioned above, the shinigami of Soul Eater have Eyes of Gold, and, well, if you are a naturally amber-eyed human with dark hair, there are Unfortunate Implications involved in that. One of New London's gangsters (who also falls into a completely different spelling of such) is a former sex slave of such coloring, but is completely human.
-   In _Ultimate Re-Imaginings_, Joey's eyes turn amber because of his pyro kinesis activating. Or at least that's what he _thought_. As it is later revealed, he was really born with them and the _brown_ eye color was fake.
-   People with golden eyes are extremely rare in Midgard in _Warriors of the World_ and are highly skilled and talented in anything they choose to do. When activated by the person being in utmost danger, they give the person superhuman reflexes and a Healing Factor at the cost of heavy strain on the human body, which may lead to death by overexertion.

-   As the various news groups gather for a melee in _Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues_, Mac Tannon shows up and turns into a "were-hyena". The first clue he's about to transform is the camera zooming in on his eyes as they turn mostly yellow.
-   _Angel Heart_: At the end when Cypher/Satan is telling the truth to Harry/Johnny, for a brief shot, his eyes change to yellow, at the point when he says that his soul belongs to him. A scene later, a baby is also seen with the same yellow eyes.
-   _The Beaning_: In this short film where the death of baseball player Ray Chapman is cast as a Human Sacrifice, the eyes of the catcher are shown as a demonic yellow as he waits for the fatal pitch.

-   When Regan is possessed by Pazuzu in _The Exorcist_, her eyes become yellow.
-   Godzilla, the massive, radioactive, mutant King of the Monsters, has orange-golden eyes in _Godzilla (2014)_. It also provides some distinct Color Contrast against his charcoal grey hide.
-   Appears in the credits sequence of _GoldenEye_ (but not the film itself; the title Kill Sat is so named because the plaque that turns it on has an amber-like stone).
-   _Let Me In_:
    -   Abby has yellow eyes when she shows her creepy, true vampire face. Depending on the lighting conditions, her eyes can also look bluish-white. Her voice will then also sound much more demonic. This is how Owen realized that his girlfriend is a vampire.
    -   In some scenes Owen looks through a telescope or peeplock, and the light that is reflected back on his eyes makes them look yellow, as yellow as Abby's vampire eyes. This is a possible Foreshadowing that Owen's future fate could be to be turned into a vampire by Abby.
-   _The Hobbit_: Smaug's eyes are changed from the book's Red Eyes, Take Warning to a fiery-looking gold color, reflecting his magical (and pyromaniacal) nature.
-   _Howl (2015)_: The werewolves have these. In the infected Jenny, these seem to manifest around the same time that she loses her human identity and turns deadly feral.
-   Stinger and his daughter from _Jupiter Ascending_ both have these, although they only appear gold for a moment when they do so. They appear to be from their partial bee DNA, apparently.
-   In _The Last Witch Hunter_, when witches perform magic, there's something like a second pupil opening in their normal one and it's gold rather than black.

-   _Star Wars_: Any character deeply immersed in the Dark Side of the Force gains "Sith eyes". The irises become yellow-gold lined with red, the whites bloodshot, and their pupils small and reptilian. Some examples:
    -   Anakin Skywalker develops these in Episode III, coinciding with his descent into evil. He also briefly gained in _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ after getting corrupted into joining the Son in Mortis. In extended works it suggests that even as a cyborg his eyes are this way under his helmet<small>◊</small>.
    -   Palpatine/Darth Sidious is always in control of his emotions, so they don't turn yellow unless he either wants them to or is about to kill you anyway. His eyes are also quite bright compared to his Dark Side-twisted face, so in _Revenge of the Sith_ this has the very creepy effect of making his eyes look bizarrely wide.
    -   Darth Maul was forged to be a weapon of hate and, as such, has sickly yellow eyes all the time.
    -   Dooku/Darth Tyranus is supposed to be a gentlemanly figure, and tends to avoid fully immersing himself in the Dark Side. As such, he is never shown (in the movies) as having "Sith Eyes". In the TV series, however, there are a small handful of occasions where he taps very deeply into the Dark Side, yellow eyes and all.
-   Heimdall, the Asgardian sentry from the live-action _Thor_ film. Justified, seeing as how he's a sufficiently advanced alien and a God.
-   Tintin in the _Thunderbirds_ live-action film has these when she uses her psychic powers. Her evil uncle, who has the same powers, falls under Red Eyes, Take Warning.
-   In _The Wolfman (2010)_, werewolves' eyes turn gold as part of their transformation.
-   In the film _Wolf (Mike Nichols)_, yellow eyes are a sign that a character is turning into a werewolf<small>◊</small>.
-   Mystique and Toad from _X-Men_. Also, Nightcrawler from the sequel and Beast in the prequel when he uses a "cure" made out of Mystique's genes that gives him blue skin/fur and gold eyes. _X-Men: Apocalypse_ has them in Jean Grey once she unleashes the Phoenix Force.

    Literature 

-   In the _Allie Beckstrom_ book _Magic to the Bone_, Zayvion has brown eyes with flecks of gold — until he leaves the magic grid, whereupon they are brown. When he drives back, his eyes turn pure gold with only flecks of brown.
-   In the world of _Black Jewels_, the three long-lived races have gold eyes. Most often described are those of Daemon Sadi, who is described from the start as resembling felines'.
-   Abaddon of _Black Legion_ has gold eyes. He claims that it's because he's been staring in the light of Astronomicon (supernatural navigation beacon) for too long.
-   In _The Blue Sword_ and its prequels, the eyes of people with _kelar_ turn gold when they get angry or use their magic (the two occasions are often related). Also, when they fall in love. And it's dangerous to look in their eyes when they're gold, unless you have the _kelar_ yourself. Kinda awkward for lovers without it.
-   _The Camp Half-Blood Series_:
    -   _Percy Jackson and the Olympians_:
        -   Luke's irises turn gold after his body is possessed by Kronos.

-   In the _Detective Inspector Chen_ series:
    -   Demonic vice cop Zhu Irzh has gold eyes.
    -   Another character has yellow eyes when in natural lighting, but under fluorescent lights they turn gold. (And she wasn't wearing contacts.)
-   Ultimately subverted in _Doctrine of Labyrinths_. Felix starts the story as the only person he or anyone else knows with a yellow eye, and he's such a powerful wizard that most superstitious people are afraid of his eyes (the other being blue of either the creepy or occult variety). Turns out where his mother comes from, people just have yellow eyes.
-   Lizzy of _Domina_ has these. In this book, it's not an impossible eye color, but it is noted as odd, and no one is quite sure if it comes from the toy maker. Although she does have supernatural powers (though it hasn't been revealed exactly _what_ powers), she does subvert the "predatory" aspect.
-   All Undrae and other castrylls in _The Dragon DelaSangre_ have emerald green eyes. It's the only physical trait the shapeshifters can’t conceal.
-   Raistlin Majere from the _Dragonlance_ series has gold eyes with hourglass-shaped pupils. They're a curse applied to him by the Wizards' Conclave because they thought he lacked sympathy; they cause him to see the effects of time on everything and everyone.
-   In _Draw One in the Dark_, the yellow eyes show that the police officer is the same as the shape-shifting lions that aided their escape.
-   In the tie-in books to _Forgotten Realms_, Gromph Baenre, Archmage of the drow city Menzoberranzan, used to have gold eyes himself. It came to help when he identified his first daughter, who had the same eye color. And when I say "used to have," he had to replace them for a new pair.
-   _Fox Demon Cultivation Manual_: The Divine Emperor Yan Song has golden eyes, and so does his nephew Yan Bei.
-   A. J. Crowley from _Good Omens_ has yellow eyes, which he usually hides behind sunglasses. Crowley's eyes are explicitly intended to be snakelike rather than feline or lupine. This is because Crowley was the snake in the Garden of Eden. Yes, _that_ snake.
-   In the _Hamish X_ trilogy, Hamish actually has said eyes because he is a cyborg.
-   _The Hands of the Emperor_: In a world with only natural eye-colors, one of the emperor of Astandalas' many titles is the Lion-Eyed for the golden eyes that run in the family due to their distant deific ancestry. True to form, the last emperor Artorin Damara has inherited the golden eyes and is both venerated as a physical god and also is an extremely powerful mage.

-   Major characters in two of Caitlin R. Kiernan's novels have eyes of gold. Though to be perfectly accurate, they are both described as having _yellow_ eyes and not gold.
    -   Narcissa Snow in _Low Red Moon_, as well as the child she helped to birth (or is she?), Emmie Silvey.
    -   Emmie appears in the related follow-up novel, _Daughter of Hounds_, which also describes the _ghul_ as occasionally possessing this eye colour (which is not unreasonable, as they are fairly canine in appearance).
-   _The Locked Tomb_: Implied with Gideon, whose eyes "like gold coins" are repeatedly remarked on and who is inexplicably, unnaturally durable. As an infant, she was unaffected by a nerve gas attack that killed the other 200 people in the area, which was frightening and inexplicable even to the mages who learned of it.
    -   It's revealed in later books that she has them because she's the daughter of the Emperor of the Nine Houses, whose original eye color was gold. Given that the Emperor is the most powerful necromancer in the Nine Houses and has a plethora of powers even beyond that, it's implied he may have passed some of his abilities down to Gideon.
-   In the _Magic by the Numbers_ book _Master of the Five Magics_, the "sorcerer's eye" is a mysterious magical item in the form of a crystal sphere, in which a single closed eye is seen to float unsupported. When in use, the eye within the sphere opens, revealing its golden iris.
-   In the _Malus Darkblade_ series, among the Dark Elves, gold or brass-coloured eyes are seen as a sign of Khaine's favour. Malus tells T'zarkan to give him a pair so he can enter Har Ganeth without arousing suspicion (since those considered to lack Khaine's favour in that city tend to end up as a sacrifice to him).
-   In _Mercy Thompson_, when a werewolf starts to change from human to wolf, the eyes are one of the first body parts to change. Watching their eyes is one way to tell who's in control in there. Since most wolves have yellow eyes, most of the werewolves' eyes will brighten to gold. One character has blue eyes in wolf form, and her eyes turn from brown to blue when her wolf starts to come out.
-   The alien children in _The Midwich Cuckoos_.
-   Earl Shackleford, the effective head of _Monster Hunter International_, normally has blue eyes, but the emergence of his werewolf form changes them to gold.
-   In _Moonflowers_, Ned Song is cursed into the form of a white wolf. Most humans mistake him for a wolfdog because the Hunter's curse is so powerful, and are constantly unnerved by his yellow eyes. The Lady of Scales, a Chinese spirit who helps Ned out later on, has a face veil that obscures everything but her red face-paint and her golden eyes.
-   Weaker vampires in _Necroscope_ have yellow eyes. Of course, weak vampires are still a real danger to ordinary humans, too. However, this shows that these vampires are not very powerful compared to those who have red eyes.
-   Aidan in _A Net of Dawn and Bones_ has amber eyes, described by Church as "scary, scary eyes", inherited from his Fallen Angel father Aariel. He originally had brown eyes until his Traumatic Superpower Awakening.
-   In _The Neverending Story_, the Childlike Empress has golden eyes and is called by the title Golden-Eyed Commander of Wishes.

-   _Scarlett Undercover_: The Children of Iblis have gold rings around their irises, though it's ambiguous whether or not they're supernatural.
-   Naturally enough, possessed by Gold-Eye from _Shade's Children_. In his case, they only indicate his supernatural ability — precognitive power — rather than any sinister nature.
-   _The Shadowhunter Chronicles_:
    -   Werewolves sometimes have blue eyes when they transform into their wolfish form. However, this is not always the case. Most werewolves in their transformed form have yellow, yellow-green, orange or gold eyes.
    -   Magnus Bane, who is a warlock (they're always half demonic), has yellow-green eyes that look like the eyes of cats.
    -   James Herondale is a shadowhunter who is a quarter demonic. For this reason, he also has special, demonic powers that other shadowhunters do not have. And he has golden eyes.
-   In _The Sharing Knife_, the Lakewalkers have metallic eye colors running the gamut between silver and gold. This is a marker of their magical heritage, their descent from the sorcerer-kings who first loosed malices on the world.
-   _The Silerian Trilogy_: People who have gold eyes (and often, though not always, red hair) are gifted by the goddess Dar, gaining fire magic as Guardians. Mirabar is a main character with them who's also a redhead. We later meet Cheylan, a gold-eyed man too. The waterlords though have been hunting down and murdering them for years to prevent powerful enemies with opposing magic, so few are left. Both Mirabar and Cheylan end up having children who will rule a free Sileria in the future.
-   The Children of the Forest in _A Song of Ice and Fire_ are described having large, golden cat-eyes. Subverted in that this is the most common color; the especially special Children are born with red or green eyes, and possess the greensight.
-   The all-powerful Tyke-Bomb in _Sourcery_ has gold eyes. They even start turning brown when he begins a Heel–Face Turn.
-   In the _Space Wolf_ novel _Wolf's Honour_, having your eyes turn golden is the first physical sign that you are turning into a wolf-like creature, the _wulfen_.
-   _Star Wars Legends_: As with the movies, it's common with Sith characters. Jacen Solo is a notable example, after he became Darth Caedus.
-   _The Swampling King_: The magical Windwalkers who created the Peaks have gold eyes, like an eagle, which are impossible to mistake for anything else. The fact that a _swampling_ has Windwalker eyes is a huge deal that overturns centuries of religious dogma... which is why the church works to cover it up.
-   The _Sword of Truth_ novels featured a creature called a screeling; hideously efficient killing machines, they were all but invincible unless you happened to have very dangerous magic on hand. They had golden eyes, so prominent that there was, in fact, a poem about them.
-   In _Tea with the Black Dragon_, Mayland Long is a dragon in human form. His eyes appear some shade of brown most of the time, with golden highlights or occasionally shining completely golden at key moments.
-   Titania in _Terra Mirum Chronicles_, fitting a queen of the Fae.
-   In "The Terrible Old Man", the titular character is seen to have yellow eyes by a man who makes the fatal mistake of trying to rob him. His exact abilities are left unseen, but he's capable of doing something to three assailants that leaves their corpses looking like they were brutalized by an entire pirate crew, and _might_ have the spirits of such a crew in glass jars on his desk...
-   _The Twilight Saga_:
    -   The Cullens and all vegetarian vampires in the series have gold-colored eyes when they've recently eaten and black when they are hungry. Less finicky vampires don't.

-   Sam in the _Wolves of Mercy Falls Series_ has golden eyes in both human and wolf form. They have absolutely nothing to do with him being a werewolf; he was born a normal boy with golden eyes but was targeted by werewolves because of them.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In the Hallmark miniseries _The 10th Kingdom_, Wolf's eyes change to a feral yellowish-gold when his animalistic side comes out.
-   In Season 2 of _American Gods_, Bast, the Egyptian goddess of cats and protection, has golden eyes both in cat and human form, although her role is so small and her appearance so short that her eye color is essentially a Freeze-Frame Bonus.

-   In the _Death Note_ drama, the Shinigami eyes are portrayed as gold. In the anime, they were red.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "Survival": People under the malign influence of the Cheetah Planet acquired golden, cat-like eyes. This included the Master and Ace. The Master's subsequent incarnation (in the TV Movie) had golden Glowing Eyes of Doom, which may have been related to this, or his being a CGI snake for a while, or something else.
    -   "The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos": The Ux, a pair of powerful Reality Warpers, have their eyes glow golden when they use their powers.
-   _The Fades_ has the Fade Polus and his followers. This signifies both that they have powers beyond those of normal Fades and that the characters have pronounced animalistic sides, as the source of these powers is eating human flesh.
-   _Forever Knight_: The vampires have shining gold eyes in vamp-face.
-   In _Kamen Rider Den-O_, every time Ryotaro is possessed by Kintaros, his eyes become yellow.
-   The titular character of _Merlin (2008)_ has blue eyes, but they glow gold when he does magic, as do those of anyone who uses magic, including Morgana, Morgause, Gaius, Alice and creatures such as the Manticore and the Dragon.
-   When Yuki gives a Revealing Hug to Alex on _MythQuest_, she reveals her identity as the Japanese snow demon Yuki-Onna by showing these.
-   _Once Upon a Time_: Red Riding Hood gains gold eyes when in or transforming into wolf form.
-   In _Penny Dreadful_, Frankenstein's Monster, aka "Caliban" or "John Clare", has golden irises. This is probably an allusion to the original novel's reference to the Creature having yellow eyes, although that was probably implying jaundiced whites instead.
-   In _Sanctuary_, Henry's eyes turning yellow is one of the first indications that his transformation into a werewolf has been triggered and are usually the very last to disappear when he changes back. On one occasion, he manages to tap into his werewolf side and use its strength to escape a holding cell. He remains completely human throughout this, except for a glowing pair of these.
-   In _Smallville_, the super strong and highly bloodthirsty Phantom Zone escapee Aldar has gold eyes.
-   In _Stargate SG-1_ and sequels, gold eyes are a sign of the Goa'uld.
-   _Supernatural_:
    -   The appropriately named Big Bad "Yellow Eyes", otherwise known as Azazel or the Demon. Also notably, in that he is (for a long time) the only demon known to have yellow eyes.
        -   In Season 12, it's revealed that yellow eyes are the mark of a Prince of Hell. The first demons to be created after Lilith, made to act as generals of Hell's armies. Azazel was just one of _four_, and the others are fully alive, if retired.
    -   In certain light, Gabriel's eyes are a light golden/amber color as well. Being that he's an all-powerful Archangel and spent time as the trickster god Loki, Richard Speight Jr..'s natural eye color worked wonderfully.
    -   One of Azazel's "Special Children" Jake's eyes briefly flash yellow when he comes into his power. Given that Azazel fed the children his blood when they were infants, this makes perfect sense.
    -   Kevin Tran, the prophet introduced in Season 7, also has eyes that glow yellow when his prophet abilities kick in.
-   _Teen Wolf_:
    -   The default eye color werewolves have when they change is gold. Eyes that glow blue are a sign that the werewolf possessing them has killed an innocent, except for Alphas, whose eyes are always red whether they have killed or not.

-   _The Wheel of Time (2021)_: Perrin's eyes turn gold when his beastial power wells up.
-   _The Witcher (2019)_: Geralt and some of the other witchers have golden eyes because he they are mutants. Geralt's are the most prominent because he was mutated the most.
-   _Wolfblood_: When any Wolfblood gets close to transforming into a wolf their eyes turn yellow and their veins turn black.
-   _The X-Files_: In "Squeeze" and "Tooms", the liver-eating mutant Eugene Victor Tooms' eyes sometimes turn a bright yellow-green (the color of bile, appropriately).

    Myth and Legend 

-   Shape-shifters in legend, especially Genies, witches, and the like, are frequently tipped off by golden (or two-tone) eyes, which they cannot hide even in animal form. Mythical creatures with Deadly Gaze may have golden eyes as well. Shapeshifter Mystique from _X-Men_ probably got her golden eyes from this variant of the tradition, making this Trope possibly Older Than Print.
-   The Celtic Púca/Pooka stands out as a notable example. A shapeshifting hobgoblin, one of The Fair Folk, Pookas can take on any number of animal forms, but their eyes are always a telltale colour, typically goat-yellow. Far less commonly, they are said to have otherworldly red, green, or blue eyes instead of yellow.
-   In Classical Mythology, Circe and her niece Medea had Golden Eyes. They were the daughter and granddaughter, respectively, of the Greek god of the Sun, Helios. His children were often associated with sorcery, and apparently they all inherited his flashing eyes.If this indeed was an inheritable trait, then one could speculate that Aeetes (Helios' son and Medea's father, of Golden Fleece fame), Pasiphae (Helios' daughter and Medea's aunt, Minotaur's mother) and Ariadne (Pasiphae's daughter) had Golden Eyes as well.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Castle Falkenstein_: Dragons in game are shapeshifters and can take on human form, but when they do, they will still have golden, slit-pupiled eyes.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   3.5 edition, or at least the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, mentions yellow eyes as a sign of celestial (angelic) descent, which usually corresponds to good alignments.
    -   4E extends gold eyes (along with red ones) to the Dragonborn and Tiefling player races, with no indication of their Character Alignment (although Tieflings are generally considered a "dark" race)
-   _Exalted_:
    -   Harmonious Jade picked up a set after taking the Second Breath as a Solar. (Before then, she had some absolutely gorgeous shining blue eyes.)
    -   Also, all Sidereal Exalted Chosen of Journeys get yellow eyes as a sign of their station. With starry sky inside the iris, stars themselves tinted yellow as well.
-   _Magic: The Gathering_: Vampires of Innistrad's Markov line have, in a variation, golden sclera and black everything else.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   As a Space Wolf inches closer to being overtaken by the Curse of the Wulfen and degenerating into a feral monster, his eyes turn a shade of gold.
    -   Abaddon the Despoiler, Warmaster of Chaos, has golden eyes from staring into the Astronomican for too long.

    Video Games 

-   In _Agarest Senki_, Lavinia of the third generation party members sports these, along with being a dark-skinned redHead, to showcase the fact that she's a Non-Human Humanoid Hybrid who takes after her dark elf parent. If the protagonist, Thoma, chooses her to be his wife, then Duran, the protagonist of the fourth generation, inherits them from her.
-   _ANNO: Mutationem_: Amok, a supernatural being of mass destruction that's from Another Dimension possesses golden glowing eyes. Ann also gets these whenever she activates her Super Mode.
-   The Little Sisters in the _BioShock_ games have these as a side effect of the ADAM slug in their bodies. Their eyes return to normal when it's removed.
-   _Borderlands_: Lilith has golden irises which glow when she triggers her Siren powers. It's not clear if the golden eyes are precisely due to being a Siren, though, as Maya, Commandant Steele, and Angel all have blue eyes.
-   _Diablo III_:
    -   The Demon Hunter sports a glowing pair of these when she has a hood on, signifiying someone who has stared into the soul of a demon without going mad.
    -   The mortal Tyrael sports a pair of these, signifying his former angelic status.
    -   Leah also sports a very creepy pair of these after her body is taken over by Diablo as the Prime Evil.
-   In contrast to most other demons in the _Disgaea_ series, Fenrich the werewolf has gold eyes.
-   _Divinity: Original Sin II_: Malady, a unique elf-demon hybrid who acts as an Aloof Ally to the player characters, has gold eyes and powers unlike any other character in the game.
-   In the original _Doom_ games, whenever you pick up an invulnerability sphere or use the god mode cheat, the Marine's eyes turn solid gold.
-   Both Morrigan and her mother, "The Witch of the Wilds", Flemeth have gold eyes in _Dragon Age: Origins_. Morrigan being a powerful mage like her mother and Flemeth heavily implied to not even be human. They also both happen to be shapeshifters with Flemeth able to take the form of a high dragon. Flemeth's other known daughter has the same eyes. _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ introduces another group of people with gold eyes. Abelas and his followers are ancient elves who guard a temple venerating Mythal, the elven goddess of love, motherhood, and justice. They all have the exact same eye color as Flemeth and her daughters. Given later revelations about Flemeth, it appears that gold eyes indicate a person with a direct connection to Mythal.
-   _Elden Ring_: Golden eyes are a sign that one possesses 'grace', a sort of ambiguous divine patronage and guidance under the Golden Order. It's pretty common, given the Golden Order previously dominated the whole continent. The Tarnished are notable in that their grace was revoked long ago, so their eyes are no longer golden (although you can still make them such in the character creator). For some reason, even avowed heretics such as Rykard and the Godskin Cultists still have gold eyes.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_
    -   This is a trait of the Dremora in _Oblivion_, an intelligent race of lesser Daedra who are most commonly found in the service of Mehrunes Dagon as his Legions of Hell. (Other games give them red or black eyes instead.)
    -   Golden Glowing Eyes are a trait of Vampires, as revealed in _Skyrim_'s _Dawnguard_ DLC. It's implied that this is a trait which is Invisible to Normals, and can only be seen by certain other supernatural beings (such as the Dragonborn, who has a draconic Aedric soul).
-   _EXTRAPOWER: Attack of Darkforce_: Kurogane gains these if she accepts Mayard's offer to save her life in exchange for swearing herself to him. With his power now her own, her brown eyes turn golden when she unleashes transcendental attacks.
-   _Fate Series_:
-   _Fear & Hunger: Termina_: O'saa, a Yellow Mage with advanced knowledge of magic and who is in service to the malevolent New God Nas'hrah, has distinct golden eyes.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   Ultimecia in _Final Fantasy VIII_ has gold eyes in addition to her various Power Tattoos and other physical signs of being a Sorceress. Edea, who inherits Ultimecia's powers and is possessed by her, also has gold eyes while in possession of her Sorceress Powers. Does not happen to Rinoa when controlled by Adel or Ultimecia, however.
    -   Chaos in _Dirge of Cerberus_ has yellow/gold eyes. It noticeably picks out the demon from Vincent, and tells the player that a major level up in power terms just happened.
    -   Adelle from _Final Fantasy Tactics A2_ has yellow/golden eyes, and she was part of "The Gifted, a group of people with extraordinary powers such as living for a long time. It is unknown if her yellow eyes have to do with the Gifted or not.
    -   _Final Fantasy XIII-2_: Combines this with Prophet Eyes; whenever Yeul and/or Serah have a vision, their eyes glow gold with the symbol of Etro over the pupil for the duration.
-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   Micaiah from _Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn_ has gold eyes. She is known for her ability to predict future events, and later turns out to be descended from the Heron Tribe and the true Apostle of the Begnion Empire. And the avatar of a goddess of chaos.
    -   In _Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade_, every morph Nergal creates has gold eyes, along with other common unusual — for the series — traits like jet-black hair, which hints at their inhuman nature.
        
        **Leila:** His eyes glow golden... You can't miss them. They seem... inhuman.
        
-   Vampires in _Gaia Online_ have yellow eyes when they're about to do something badass; otherwise, they're pale gray with Hellish Pupils. Psycho for Hire Zhivago apparently has this effect going constantly.
-   Everything from _Gears of War_ when infected by Imulsion. When something is completely black, has golden eyes and explodes after death, you know that something is wrong...
-   In _Genshin Impact_, the Geo Archon Rex Lapis who rules over Liyue is rumored to shapeshift into several forms — a young boy, a woman or a huge dragon, but he always has distinctive amber eyes. Said amber eyes are one of the hints pointing at Zhongli being Rex Lapis assuming a human identity.
-   In a cross of this and Electronic Eyes, the title character of _GoldenEye: Rogue Agent_ has a cybernetic yellow eye.
-   _Golden Sun_:
    -   In _Golden Sun: The Lost Age_, yellow eyes are apparently normal in Lemuria, a city-state of Adepts with extraordinary longevity. One of the NPCs in Madra talks about Piers's eyes during his imprisonment there.
    -   This trope is far more pronounced at the very end of _Golden Sun: Dark Dawn_. Matthew's eyes glow golden while he and Sveta are Sharing a Body, and after the Apollo Lens goes off all of the beastmen in the blast zone have Supernatural Gold _Everything_.
-   The character Slayer from _Guilty Gear XX_ has golden eyes. This makes sense, since he is a vampire.
-   Brandon Heat of _Gungrave_, while, during his mortal life, he had light brown eyes and black hair, after being murdered and later resurrected as the necrolizer called Grave, he has yellow eyes and silver hair.
-   Nageki from _Hatoful Boyfriend_ has bright yellow eyes in his human portrait, unlike his actual form as a dark-eyed mourning dove. He turns out to be a ghost.
-   Mackenzie Hunt in _Havenfall Is for Lovers_ has green eyes which turn bright gold when her true nature as a werewolf is showing.
-   Yuuichi Komura from _Hiiro no Kakera_ has them. Not surprising considering he is descended from a Kitsune.
-   _Honkai Impact 3rd_: Sirin, Honkai cataclysm incarnate, has gold-orange eyes with Exotic Eye Designs. After the events of Chapter 11-EX, Kiana herself gains a right gold-orange eye as a symbol of her Herrscher power, minus Sirin's pupils.
-   Graves from _Hustle Cat_ has heterochromia, with his left eye being gold. He wasn't born with it; his eye changed colour from blue to gold when he first transformed into a facsimile of his cat, who had heterochromia.
-   _Juniper's Knot_: The girl has golden eyes and green hair to signify her nature as a powerful demon, in contrast to the human boy who is rather plain and has hair and eyes found in ordinary humans.
-   _Kingdom Hearts_:
    -   Golden eyes are associated with The Heartless and, by extension, the power of darkness — the only Heartless not to have yellow eyes are the small number that don't have visible faces.
    -   Due to his extensive delving into the darkness, every incarnation of Xehanort has them, as do his Co-Dragons Saïx and Xigbar. In their case, the eyes are a sign that they've been infected with Xehanort's darkness, turning them into yet more hosts. This happens to several others in _Kingdom Hearts III_.
    -   Vanitas has these under his mask due to being Made of Evil, and so does Ventus when Vanitas possesses him.
-   Shamir Shamazzle in _King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow_ has golden eyes, in all of his many forms. This helps the player identify him... just in case the various strangers encouraging the protagonist to do strange/dangerous/crazy things weren't obvious enough.
-   Dark Jedi in the _Knights of the Old Republic_ series, especially Darth Revan, have yellow eyes (see the _Star Wars_ example under Film, above). The player character can have them as well, if she/he goes over to the Dark Side. There's an awesome, but understated, moment where you get a close-up of them while you and Bastilla are tricking the Republic. This was influenced by Emperor Palpatine, who also gained them when his face became corrupted by the Dark Side (in some continuities).
-   _Lands of Lore_ has a scene where the shapeshifting main villain masquerades as one of the player's allies. The only way to detect her (except trial and error) is by her eyes, which stay yellow regardless of form.
-   Ahri the Nine-Tailed Fox from _League of Legends_ has golden eyes and is a Korean-styled gumiho to be precise.
-   _The Legend of Heroes - Trails_:
    -   _Trails in the Sky_: Joshua's eyes are gold, and his combat prowess was in part due to Weissman using him as a guinea pig in his research into Stigmas.
    -   _Trails from Zero_: Tio's eyes weren't gold at birth but turned that way after being experimented on by the D∴G Cult.
    -   _Trails of Cold Steel_: In the final battle of _Cold Steel III_, Rean has these eyes instead of his normal red in his Super Mode. It's a sign that he's completely lost control of his powers.
-   Avalon, the Big Bad of _Legaia II: Duel Saga_, has these. Originally known as simply "Gold Eyes" in his first appearance, you later learn that he is a Star Shaper, a being who can manipulate the Source Forge, the beacon of creation. He is also a Mystic, and wields the Origin Igohl, the Supreme Origin said to be of (nearly) infinite power.
-   Antasma has these in _Mario & Luigi: Dream Team_, as do many of the ghosts in _Luigi's Mansion_. Of course, neither are the kind of character whose eyes need to be used as a way to tell that they're evil, the rest of their appearance makes it blatantly obvious regardless.
-   In the _Mass Effect_ games, one can identify Harbinger, the first, biggest, and most powerful Reaper by the fact that his "eyes" are gold instead of red. In addition, the Collectors he controls erupt with glowing golden eyes, along with taking on a skin texture resembling golden magma, when he possesses them.
-   Several monsters in _Miitopia_ briefly display gold eyes when using their magical attacks. Some examples include the MP-draining ability or the Dark Lord's face-stealing attack.
-   _Pokémon_:
    -   Kyogre, Groudon and Rayquaza, a trio of ancient Olympus Mons with control over the weather <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  debuting in the third generation all have yellow eyes.
    -   _Pokémon Sun and Moon_: Lusamine briefly gains these while fused to a Nihilego.
-   In _Promise of Wizard_, Snow and White's golden eyes indicate the great amount of power the twins have as the oldest wizards in the entire game, literally thousands of years old.
-   In _Quest for Glory IV_, all vampires have pupil-less golden eyes.
-   In the _Resident Evil_ franchise, every seemingly human entity with gold/yellow eyes is revealed to be a high-level mutant that can take on a human disguise.
-   _Shin Megami Tensei_ has a few examples:
    -   In _Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne_, the Demi-Fiend's eyes change from grayish to gold when he's given demonic powers, and they begin to glow (and his body _darken_) when he unleashes powerful physical attacks (most likely, this would happen with spells as well, but they all use the same generic casting animation, so...). His eyes get bumped up a rank to red if the player makes it all the way through the Labyrinth of Amala and has the Old Man in the Wheelchair unlock the full extent of his demonic power at the cost of his human soul.
    -   Nanashi gets these in the Massacre ending of _Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse_. They're the same color as YHVH's faces, signifying that he's replaced him as Creator God.
    -   In _Shin Megami Tensei V_, when the protagonist fuses with Aogami to become a Nahobino, his eyes turn gold to match Aogami's.
    -   In _Digital Devil Saga_, the main playable characters get the glowing version these when in Berserk state aka when they lose control of their Atma demons. However, in the Junkyard golden or at least yellow eyes are fairly common due to all the residents having Technicolor Eyes.
    -   _Persona_:
        -   Velvet Room assistants Elizabeth, Theodore, Margaret, Justine, and Caroline are Ambiguously Human siblings of enigmatic origin who all have golden eyes and immense supernatural power.
        -   In _Persona 2_, Big Bad Nyarlathotep tends to go for gold eyes and a slit pupils when he's in human form. The Shadow Selves avert this by having Red Eyes, Take Warning.
        -   In _Persona 3_, secondary antagonist Takaya Sakaki is a fairly powerful Persona user who's the only human character to have gold eyes.
        -   In _Persona 4_ all Shadow Selves have gold eyes in their human form, as do humans possessed by their Shadows. Additionally, all of the main character's Personas have gold eyes, assuming they're visible.
        -   _Persona 5_: The main characters temporarily get golden eyes when they awaken their Personas. This comes in addition to the Shadow Selves and Personas who play this trope exactly as they did in the previous entry. The sequel, _Persona 5 Strikers_, is the same.
-   Poet from _pop'n music_ has bright yellow eyes (golden orange in her alternate colors). This is rather unusual, as her, ah, supernatural origin would be pretty obvious without it.
-   All the full blooded elves in _Sable's Grimoire_ have golden eyes, with a variety of eye colours being one of the differences between them and the half-elves that appear.
-   _The Sims_:
    -   In _The Sims 2_, werewolves have yellow eyes; interestingly, so do plant-sims.
    -   In _The Sims 3_, werewolves have golden eyes.
-   In the _Soul Series_, Zasalamel's left eye is golden, and this never changes through any of his reincarnations, including his skeletal One-Winged Angel form Abyss. This is because his gold eye contains his soul.
-   Okabe's gold eyes in _Steins;Gate_ seem to have something to do with his "Reading Steiner," the unique ability to retain his original memories when the past gets rewritten. All other strange events in the show are science-based, but this one thing is left unexplained and is apparently magical.
-   It's never directly commented on, but Alvin and Jude are the only two characters in _Tales of Xillia_ with gold eyes. This makes it an inversion of the trope, as both Jude and Alvin are of Elympion descent.
-   The vampire Arcueid in _Tsukihime_ has red eyes, but she's more of a ditzy good girl than anything else. When they turn _gold_, however, it's time to run. When her irises turn gold and the scleras of her eyes turn red, you're already dead. If her eyes returns to being red, but her hair grows out and her attitude becomes cold and haughty, that's a _very_ bad news: her Superpowered Evil Side, Archetype Earth, has taken over, and she possesses the same power Arcueid had before she started losing her strength.
-   Dlanor A. Knox from _Umineko: When They Cry_ has these. She's the High Inquisitor of the Eiserne Jungfrau, the 7th District Repentance Agency of the Great Court of Heaven, whose job it is to hunt down "heretics". She uses two swords, the Red Key and the Blue Key, which allows her to use Red and Blue truths.
-   In the case of the Action Girl, Mandana, from _Unavowed_, they serve as the most immediately obvious sign that she a Half-Human Hybrid, with her father being a Genie, sorry, _Jinn_.
-   _Warcraft_:
    -   The universe features the night elves who normally have completely silver eyes (entirely silver, as they have no visible pupils). Those who had golden eyes were considered to be destined for great things, the most notable being Illidan Stormrage and Queen Azshara. Ironically enough, both of them ended up as villains.
    -   Nonetheless, in _World of Warcraft_, it's divided along gender lines: male Night Elves have golden eyes, female Night Elves have silver eyes, and that's that. The encyclopedia on the website mentions that, in truth, supernatural gold eyes are merely a sign of druidic potential, and as the druids only recently opened their ranks to women, they are more common in males...which really makes no sense when you think about it.
    -   And then there's druids. Malfurion Stormrage, the twin brother of Illidan, was born with silver eyes, but while practicing druidism over many centuries, his eyes turned gold, as seen here.
    -   And despite their potential for it, neither Azshara nor Illidan became druids. Illidan started on that path, but his own impatience and disdain for it (druids at the time were not greatly appreciated in Night Elf society) caused Cenarius to deem him unworthy of personal tutelage. Being ordered to learn from Malfurion, who was also still an apprentice at the time, was the last straw for Illidan.
    -   Paladins were depicted having gold glowing eyes in _Warcraft II_, but this visual motif didn't stick around in the series aside from particular moments of individual ones having the power of The Light in them...which is to say, when they're particularly powerful.
-   Sho Minamimoto from _The World Ends with You_, fitting the bill of the trope as a delightfully power-hungry sociopath who shapeshifts into a lion.
-   In _Xenogears_, Artificial Human Emeralda Kasim has green hair and gold eyes.
-   Gulcasa and Emilia in _Yggdra Union_ and its spinoffs have golden and bright yellow eyes respectively. They're the descendants of a demon god.

    Web Comics 

-   Black Mage of _8-Bit Theater_, like Richard, is a psychotic wizard. His eyes are the only part of his face not obscured by his hat, which is a very good thing.
-   In _The Adventures of Dr. McNinja_, Sparklelord the anthropomorphic magic unicorn has featureless golden eyes, with no irises or pupils. The first time he's shown in this form, they're more "yellow Glowing Eyes", later more like "orbs of gold". When he appears as a regular unicorn in a dream, perhaps his original form before he was "corrupted", he has more normal eyes. In his form as a motorcycle, the headlights get treated rather like glowing gold eyes, too.
-   Vector of _Castoff_ has glowing yellow eyes that inexplicably terrify anyone who looks into them. No one knows what he is, but his appearance and powers indicate he is an Anthropomorphic Personification of fear.
-   The four main characters' of _Cry 'Havoc'_ eyes change to golden when they transform into werewolves. Their eyes also fluctuate between their natural color and yellow when in human form and stressed or excited.
-   Din of _Galebound_ has green eyes, mostly, but his pupils are ringed with gold—a sign of his Magician heritage. When angered (or, occasionally, at will), his eyes will _glow_ gold.
-   In _Inverloch_, Lei'ella, Kayn'dar, and other "Severed" elves have white hair and golden eyes. This is an inversion: instead of being powerful or tricksters, Severed elves are mortal and can't use magic, essentially being Brought Down to Normal.
-   Richard from _Looking for Group_ has yellow/gold eyes and is probably one of the most powerful, destructive, and evil warlocks/beings/forces in the comic's entire world and/or universe. He's also insane. And undead. And hundreds of years old.
-   _Lovely Lovecraft_: Noyes has golden eyes, an unusual trait hinting at his true identity as the Outer God Nyarlathotep.
-   Miho and later Yuki is shown to have them in _MegaTokyo_, so supernatural that they can even occasionally override the fact that MegaTokyo is a black-and-white comic. They indicate Magical Girl status.
-   _Mieruko-chan_: Miko has yellow eyes and has developed the ability to see spirits that are Invisible to Normals.
-   _Neko: The Cat_: We briefly see Michiko from her father's point of view as she attacks him with an axe, showing her with bright golden, catlike eyes even though earlier her eyes were black. This implies that Michiko's actions are more heavily influenced by her stepmother and her cursed cats than she realized.
-   Laurin Shattersmith in _The Order of the Stick_ usually has black eyes, like everyone else in the comic, but they turn bright gold when she uses her Psychic Powers.
-   In _Pandect_, Aces (animals who have been given human bodies and minds) have yellow eyes if their animal species has them. The protagonist, Prince Fleance, is a melanistic leopard and has gold eyes with slit pupils in human form.
-   In _Plume_, guardian spirit Corrick has glowing gold eyes, which flash even brighter when he's using his powers.
-   In _Satan and Me_, Satan's irises are orange and yellow or gold.
-   The Woman in White of _Sleepless Domain_ has an example unusual even for this trope: gold pupils, white irises, and gold edges. She's strongly implied to be The Founder, aka the source of the Magical Girls' powers.
-   _Slightly Damned_:
    -   Rhea has yellow gold colored eyes and is a descendant of the earth guardian Moku the snake and can use extremely powerful magic when she is reconnected to the bloodline. According to her evil dad Moonshade she inherited her eyes from her mother which he refers to as "eyes like the sun".
    -   Some demons have yellow or orange colored eyes and they are all naturally magical beings, in fact yellow seems to be one of the most common demon eye colors next to red.
-   Werewolves in _Sorcery 101_ have yellow eyes. It is also suspected to be the case in _Strange Someone_.
-   _The Sword Interval_: Protagonist Fall Barros was Touched By the Big Bad when she was twelve, and left abnormal in ways not fully understood yet, the most visible sign being her glowing golden eyes. It turns out that she's the latest Harbinger, and was actually born with the golden eyes and superpowers. Her memories were altered so she wouldn't remember she had them before the age of twelve, as was her last family photo. All Harbingers have the golden eyes. Fall's immediate predecessor in the position, Mikhail Ivanov, had eyes gone completely golden and looked like he wasn't quite human anymore by the time he died.
-   In _Tower of God_, some characters may have golden eyes just because there are characters with so many kinds of appearances around, but some of the most significant characters also have golden eyes.
    -   There are two golden-eyed main characters, Twenty-Fifth Bam and Rachel. A certain mystical connotation is there, as both are Irregulars, beings that broke into the Tower from outside, and their preceding Irregulars left a less than positive impression. Bam seems ordinary at first, but much of the story revolves around revealing how special he is, including magical talents that break the normal rules, and a special destiny. Rachel... continues to be ordinary in spite of all this.
    -   King Jahad as well as his apparent illegitimate son Wangnan have golden eyes, and Jahad is, unsurprisingly, an extremely significant and mysterious figure in the Tower.
-   In _Trapped_, vampires’ eyes tend to glow bright yellow when they’re exposed to blood.
-   In _Undead Friend_, when a ghost "reverses" and takes a sold human form, they all have gold eyes no matter what color they were when they were alive, showing they are still dead and not human.
-   In _Wilde Life,_ Clifford (an animal-person with a wolf form) has golden irises, which also glow in the dark. Oscar actually never noticed them until Eliza points them out, noting that many animal-people have "wild eyes" like his.

    Web Original 

-   _The Crew of the Copper-Colored Cupids_: The first thing Pythe notices about Mandragora-257 in his debut in the story _The Resurrection of the Wellsians_ is the strange golden glow of his eyes, presumably a side-effect of Mandragora's alchemical pursuits. The glowing golden eyes remain a tell-tale sign of Mandragora's identity after he starts body-hopping following the destruction of his original body.
-   _Dream SMP_: Karl has bright golden eyes and is able to time travel.
-   _RWBY_:
    -   Cinder naturally possesses golden eyes. However, whenever she uses her power, her eyes begin to glow like golden fire, and it's often a sign she's about to do something extremely evil with her abilities, or intimidate people into doing her bidding. To emphasise this, the camera often zooms in on her eyes just before they begin to glow. Her affinity lies with fire because her Semblance gives her the ability to superheat anything. Her eyes gain this ability after stealing just half of the Fall Maiden's legendary magical power, making it a sign she's using magic. Although Maidens can use all Elemental Powers, they often gravitate to one element in particular; Cinder heavily favours fire magic.
    -   When Oscar grants Ozpin control of his body, his eyes briefly flash gold. During the control period, Oscar eyes periodically flash gold and are consistently gold whenever his reflection is seen, such as when he is staring into his drink. When Hazel, who has a deep grudge against Ozpin, is trying to kill Oscar for being Ozpin's latest host, witnessing Oscar's eyes flash gold immediately informs him that Ozpin has resurfaced in control of Oscar's body.
-   In _Void Domain_, Rex Zagan one of the seventy-two pillars of Hell has golden eyes.

    Western Animation 

-   In _Angel's Friends_, Sulfus and Kabale have these and are notorious trickster devils.
-   In _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ and its Sequel Series _The Legend of Korra_, it is common for anyone of the Fire Nation royal family to have vibrantly golden eyes. Thanks to Superpowerful Genetics, their family tends to produce powerful firebenders; it doesn't hurt that their ancestry includes a previous Avatar.
-   Takanuva, Toa of Light has yellow eyes in _BIONICLE: Mask of Light_, representing his light-based powers. His first toy also came with yellow eyes, though later incarnations changed them to lime green.
-   In the _Gravity Falls_ episode "Sock Opera", Dipper's corneas turn a dull yellow and his normally-circular pupils stretch into slender ovoids when he becomes the victim of a Demonic Possession.
-   _The Legend of Vox Machina_: Doubling with Mind-Control Eyes. Sylas' Red Eyes, Take Warning glow gold when he magically persuades Uriel against sending troops to investigate Whitestone, and when he paralyzes Vax. His targets’ eyes glow the same way.
-   Timber Wolf from the _Legion of Super Heroes_ cartoon series has these eyes (gold sclera, red pupils) as a result of his father's experiments on him that turned him into a werewolf-like being. They turn red when he's using his enhanced senses but start running when they become bloodshot. His eye colour when he was human remains unknown.
-   Sunil Nevla the mongoose from _Littlest Pet Shop (2012)_ has these; he can even hypnotise people with them.
-   _The Owl House_: Eda has them, fitting for a witch. Amity, Edric and Emira also possess these having inherited them from their father, Alador.
-   _Transformers: Prime_,
    -   Almost every Transformer has either blue or red eyes, depending on their faction, though they can change if they're under the influence of a special fuel. The exception seems to Predaking, who has golden eyes. Seeing how he's a miracle of science, a being cloned from the ancient remains of Predacon bones, he may fall under this trope.
    -   There's also Nemesis Prime, another miracle of Science, this one built by humans using a few salvaged Transformer parts and energon.
    -   Breakdown's an interesting case as he's one of the only characters who has golden colored optics yet isn't of any different origin. However when he's salvaged and reworked into CYLAS the trope is played straight with the golden eyes in particular being given a lot more emphasis to show how unnatural and disturbing the beast is, especially with one of the eyes being crude patch job.
-   Stella from _Winx Club_, who has sun-based powers and her color motifs are mostly yellow and orange. She also has gold hair to match.
