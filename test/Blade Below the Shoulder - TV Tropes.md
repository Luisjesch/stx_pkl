_"Phenom is on his feet again, a little wobbly but still game. He's got his hands up, blades extended. Either of those things might take my head off like a dandelion."_

It's common knowledge that blades are cool. But they can also be a hassle to carry around everywhere. The scabbard might be uncomfortable, and the sword won't simply stick to your back. On top of that, once you finally decide to unsheathe your weapon, you are no longer able to hold anything else in one or both of your hands (or make rude gestures to your opponent). This problem is intensified if the weapon user intends to dual-wield.

The solution: attach the blade to your arm, leaving your hands free to do whatever else you may be inclined to do with them. These blades are often long, vaguely triangular, and taper to a point. Variants include:

-   **Removable arm blade**: Attaching the blades to your elbow, wrist, or even the back of your hand.
-   **Permanently-attached blade**: Embedding the blades inside your arms, from where they can be deployed and retracted by thought alone (usually employed by robots, cyborgs, and other non-regular human characters).
-   **Blade replaces hand or arm**: Replacing one or both of your hands or even your arms with large swords.

The last type is Awesome, but Impractical, as the blades prevent their wielders from performing mundane tasks when not in combat. They are also especially prone to Fake Arm Disarms, as they can be destroyed without gravely injuring the characters. Crafty opponents can also maneuver the wielder into getting them stuck in a wall or something else; and because the weapon is attached to the wielder entirely, letting it go isn't exactly an option. While these drawbacks mitigate many of the practical benefits of having swords attached to your body as opposed to carried, few will have the guts to question your coolness or badassery.

Wolverine Claws are a specific variant. May overlap with Swiss-Army Appendage. Can be considered a subtrope of Cool Sword. Compare its counterpart Arm Cannon, as well as Power Fist. Not to be confused with Shapeshifter Weapons, which are not limited to simply being blades. See also Hook Hand. Compare Combat Haircomb. Commonly a weapon for a Predator Pastiche and/or Wolverine Wannabe.

The examples below are divided into three categories: one, where a blade attached to the arm is a weapon of choice, but not a permanent body part; two, where the blade is permanently attached to the arm and may or may not be concealable; and three, where the entire arm _is_ a blade.

## Removable arm blade:

    Anime and Manga

    -   Alita's blades become retractable after she gets the nanite-based Imaginos body.
-   In _D.Gray-Man_, the Inspector keeps a switch-blade sword hidden up his sleeve.
-   The Energy Blade techniques of _Dragon Ball_ (including Vegito's Spirit Sword, Salza's Salza Blade, Zamasu's God Split Cut, and Goku Black's Violent Fierce God Slicer) are performed by a character projecting a blade of _ki_ from their hand.
-   Shooting Star Units from _Black Cat_.

-   In the anime, the Robot Girl Chachamaru from _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ gets a long, thin, retractable sword installed in her forearm, in addition to steel angel wings. In the manga, however, she gets a massive sword that replaces her arm entirely. The other arm turns into an equally huge machine gun.
-   Veronica in _Franken Fran_ appears to be stuffed with spring-loaded weaponry. Given her Artificial Human nature, she may very well be _literally_ full of weapons.
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_ does this with drills: the Gurren Lagann's usual weapon is a pair of drills coming out from above the wrist so in a sense it's also a Power Fist. Justified in that the Gurren Lagann can spawn drills from any part of it's body.
-   Sango from _Inuyasha_ has a hidden retractable blade in her right sleeve that she uses as a last resort.
-   The ninja Hanzo in _Hunter × Hunter_ has a retractable version. He uses it to threaten Gon during their fight in the final Hunter Exam.

        -   Seems like this type of weapon is a trademark of Setsuna F. Seiei's Gundams: Exia's GN Sword I and 00 Gundam/Raiser's GN Sword III (equipped for the Final Battle). The original 00 Qan\[T\]'s GN Sword V is a traditional sword instead, but in _SD Gundam G-Generation Cross Rays_, the ELS Qan\[T\] is equipped again with this type of weapon, and is also capable of using the Raiser Sword like the GN Sword III.
    -   McGillis Fareed from _Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans_ pilots the Grimgerde, which has a pair of swords attached onto the shields, he can take them out from the shields and wield them on its hands or simply retract them and keep them on the shields.

-   _3×3 Eyes_: Yakumo's weapon is a double-edged dagger blade hidden in his right gauntlet, which he's seen using starting from the second part of the story. In the fourth one, Trinetra, he's seemingly upgraded the blade using a blade inscribed with the Triclops's emblem which allows him to access the dimensional gates of Kun Lun. To really drive the point home, when Amara merges with his arm, he takes the form of a large wrist-mounted sword when Yakumo needs to fight.
-   Jack the Ripper from _Black Clover_ has Severing Magic that conjures mana blades on his forearms that he can even launch at enemies. He can change the blades' nature and sharpness to whatever he's trying to cut up, letting him eventually counter any magical defense and cut through anything.
-   In _High School D×D_, when Archangel Michael gifts Issei with the Dragon-slaying sword Ascalon, it attaches to his Boosted Gear gauntlet in this fashion, and he's able to make it appear and disappear at will. He can also separate it to lend it to someone else (usually he does it to Xenovia).
-   In _Red Baron_, the titular robot gains as its Mid-Season Upgrade a pair of bladed gauntlets to increase its damage output.

-   Étienne Cazenac, the protagonist of the French comic _La Croix de Cazenac_, fights with knives (or, in one arc, shards of bone) tied to his wrists.
-   _Azrael_ (Jean-Paul Valley) has a version of this: Two flaming retractable Katar-like blades in his gloves. Said gloves look like giant gold fists, but...
-   Debatable which category this would fit under, exactly, but in the X-Men comics mutant Marrow can and frequently does grow her bones out of her skin, break them off, and use them as blades.

-   _The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_: Azog has throughout the first two films possessed a mace stuck gruesomely in his left arm stump to make up for the arm he lost long ago, but in the final film, he trades the mace for a klingon-like blade when riding out to war.
-   When a side character's arm is _annihilated_ via lawnmower in _Hobo With a Shotgun_, she uses the resulting sharpened forearm to stab her attacker in the gut. It's a grindhouse parody, so it's to be expected.
-   Used most egregiously in _Hook_, when an entire sword (hilt and all) springs out of the Captain's sleeve, and into his hand.
-   The Battle Butler Alfred in _Hudson Hawk_ fights with a pair of retractable blades under his sleeves.

The film illustrates the main drawback of the Blade Below the shoulder when Szell impales himself while tumbling downing the stairs.
-   In _A Nightmare on Elm Street_ Freddy Krueger's blade-fingered glove started out this way, when he was still alive and his glove, merely a homemade murder weapon. In dreams, it evolves into more of a built-in weapon, which alternately appears on his hand whole when he sheds a disguise, or sends its blades springing out from his (or a puppet's, or a possessed boy's, etc) fingertips. In _Wes Craven's New Nightmare_, a scene is filmed in which Freddy amputates his hand and replaces it with a razor-tipped robotic version, but this element doesn't seem to have carried over into the character's subsequent appearances. See also Wolverine Claws.
-   The Predators have retractable wrist blades that extend to a punching, slashing length. In some versions they become very long arm swords.

    Literature 

-   _Architect Of Sleep_: The soldier caste of the raccoon-like sapients wear a 'Fighting Hand', a bracer with a hinged plate that folds down to cover the back of the hand with a palm strap to keep it in place; the hinged plate has four daggerlike blades usable in close combat.
-   _Discworld_: Inigo Skimmer _The Fifth Elephant_ had a blade cleverly concealed along his forearm(s), as well as a sharpened metal edge in his hat, and blades on his boots. He also might be the only character in the series shown to have any competence with wrist knives. In _Night Watch_, Vimes remarks that even most Assassins think they're stupid and ineffective weapons.
-   _Shadows of the Apt_: The Mantis Claw. It's hinged, so there's even more mobility than the standard Blade Below the shoulder.
-   _Hannibal_: Dr. Lecter arms himself with a spring-mounted concealed blade known as a Harpy. Available at any gun and knife show, apparently. It is, in fact, a SpyderCo Harpy. The spring-mounted bit is all Hollywood, though.
-   _The Reynard Cycle_: Reynard acquires one of these during _The Baron of Maleperduys_.
    
    **Reynard**: _"Someone once told me that my body was a weapon. A truer statement in my case than most."_

-   _Chronicles of the Kencyrath_: Scythe-arms are blade pairs attached to the fore-arm, with the longer blade jutting forward and the other back. They are used in pairs, ie one main blade and one spur on each forearm. Training with them easily dissolves into chaos, with inexperienced users not being able to keep track of the spurs. Jame, the protagonist, is an exception, finding in them for the first time a weapon that she feels right with; she subsequently carries them everywhere.
-   _The Legend of Drizzt_: The Gutbuster Brigade wear bladed/spiked armor on which they regularly impale opponents, in addition to carrying massive axes or hammers. Their leader has been known to walk around with an entire hobgoblin impaled on his helmet, and to kill orcs by _running into them chest-first and thrashing violently until the orc stops screaming._
-   _Paradox Trilogy_: Devi has a sword, named Elsie, which works this way. It is embedded in the wrist of her Powered Armor and can extend or retract at will.
-   _Hammerjack_: Avalon is armed with stealthblades that she can extend from the wrists of her sensuit.
-   _The Conquerors Saga_: Lada from _And I Darken_ has two wrist blades she can hide under her sleeves, a gift from Mehmed. They come in pretty handy when she hears something in the dark at his wedding...
-   In _Space Glass_, the Marauder's four arms end in blades.

    Live-Action TV

-   As seen in his self-titled spinoff, Angel has a set of retractable stakes that can pop out of his sleeves. Not blades, but just as effective, as evidenced by the piles of dust that used to be vampires. In the same series, Wesley uses a folding sword that pops out of his sleeve. He appears to hold it like a normal sword once its extended, though. When he loses his memory in one episode the practical problems of the concept are lampshaded, i.e. he nearly kills himself. And at one point, Connor shows up with an axe blade strapped to his arm.
    -   In at least one episode they're using forearm-mounted crossbows!
    -   Angel's retractable stakes became iconic for the series, remaining in the title sequence until the final season, and reappearing one last time (used by Gunn this time) in the Grand Finale.
-   Apophis uses one in _Stargate SG-1_ in an attempt to kill Sokar. Though he failed, it's amazing he even got close enough to try, as said blade was a huge and very obvious device on his arm. He does manage to take out Sokar's First Prime and a Jaffa guard with it, though.
    -   Replicarter, a robotic version of Carter who can basically shapeshift, creates her arm into a long blade in order to kill some System Lords.
-   Jean Renault in _Twin Peaks_. He uses it to kill a random strawberry and Blackie, the madam of One Eyed Jacks.
-   The Stinger Blade wielded by the Blue Stinger Beetleborg is one of these.
-   In _Power Rangers Jungle Fury_, Dominic the White Rhino Ranger's _morpher_ is this, able to be summoned from a bracelet. The blade's handle is gripped in a fist-like fashion similar to a sword; however, the blade is aligned with the user's arm rather than being perpendicular. Known as the Rhino Blade, Dominic's weapon can also loose a powerful Super Slash finishing attack and also houses an alternate laser cannon mode.
-   Merle Dixon on _The Walking Dead_ has an interesting variant of this trope where the bayonet attaches to a prosthetic arm he wears over his right stump.
-   _The Punisher (2017)_: Billy Russo sports a retractable blade on his right arm, which we see him use to kill Colonel Bennett and Sam Stein.
-   Several Ultras from the _Ultra Series_ has the ability to create energy blades from behind their wrists, used for slicing monsters apart, including both Ultraman Gaia and his partner, Agul (in fact, their blades emits a lightsaber-like hum when being used), Ultraman Mebius and Ultraman Hikari, Ultraman Ginga and Ultraman Victory.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   CMLL and New Japan Super Junior Kamaitachi has the appearance of these embedded in his arm bands, but in the name of fairness they are not actually sharpened, just shiny. In the former his Red Baron roughly translates into "The Sickle Weasel".

    Tabletop Games 

-   The Warforged Armblade component in _Eberron_.
    -   In 4th Edition, any sort of one-handed weapon can be attached to a Warforged's arm. However, they function like type three model in that the Warforged can't actually do anything with that hand while the weapon is grafted onto it, although it can be removed voluntarily and fairly quickly.
        -   Actually, light weapons can retract into the Warforged's arm, if made with a specific type of attachment.
        -   Not just fourth edition, they could do it in 3.5 as well. All the rules were a bit byzantine.
        -   Quite the opposite problem, actually. No rules were given on how to make an item as an attached or embedded component, other than "you can."
-   The _Complete Scoundrel_ Splatbook for 3.5 has two arm blade options - sleeve blades like the kind in _Assassin's Creed_, reverse-facing elbow-blades, plus knee-blades, and boot-blades. You can even get blades hidden inside an instrument!
-   Shadowrun gives us Forearm Snap-blades, which functions as an alternative to the more famous Spurs. These are meant for the runner who either doesn't have the cash for or doesn't want to deal with the Essence loss imposed by cyberware.
-   Games Workshop games:
    -   In _Warhammer: Age of Sigmar_, Skaarac the Bloodborn has Brutal Blades chained to his forearms so that the Great Khorgorath of Khorne can hack and gouge at his enemies. This is in contrast to regular Khorgoraths who make do with their natural claws and tentacles to kill their foes.
    -   _Warhammer 40,000_:
        -   Eldar Warp Spider Exarches have access to Power Blades, described as fitting onto the forearm, allowing their wielder to use other weapons in addition to the blades.
        -   Chainfists are a variant of the Power Fist that combines the energy field of the powered gauntlet with the cutting power a chainsaw blade, allowing the wielder to cut through armoured vehicles and bulkheads as if they were paper.
        -   Lightning Claws are weapons consisting of a number of a number of blades wreathed in a power field and attached to an armoured gauntlet. How the blades are attached to the gauntlet differ, with some attached to the back of the hand while other patterns attaching the blades to the knuckles or have them replace the gauntlet’s fingers.
        -   The phase swords used by assassins of the Callidus Temple are worn on a on a bracer attached to the back of the wrist so that the wielder has her hand free to manipulate objects and handle her poisoned blades.
        -   One particular Space Marine Chapter from the Cursed Founding, Black Dragons, just happened to get a hyperactive Ossmodula (implant, responsible for strengthening the bones (and accelerating their growth) of it's recepient). While it meant that Space Marines from this Chapter often were disfigured in some way (and counted as mutants by many Imperials as a result), many Black Dragons also got horns and bone blades in their arms (even retractable ones — when their Apothecaries "perfected" the development of this mutation), which are quite useful in close combat.
        -   Soldiers of the Vraksian Renegade Militia have sharpened pieces of scrap metal strapped to the back of their arms to use as melee weapons during the trench fighting of the Siege of Vraks.

    Video Games 

-   _Advent Rising_: The Aurelians have large, scythe-like blades attached just below the elbow - and pointing backwards. Their fighting style consists primarily of elbow jabs.
-   _Akuji the Heartless_: Akuji's default melee weapons are his bone shives, attached underneath his elbow, which can slice up all kinds of monsters and demons.
-   _Arcana Heart 3_: Weiss can summon blades onto her wrists as her main combat method.
-   _Assassin's Creed_: The signature weapon of the Assassins is the Hidden Blade, an extendable knife attached to an arm-brace used to silently kill enemies. In _Assassin's Creed_, the ring finger of the Assassins' left hands are _cut off_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  in order to make this usable. His sequel successor Ezio, on the other hand, pulls this off (on both hands, even) without the nasty "cutting off fingers" catch.
    -   In game this is justified by Altaïr having modified the design so it's raised further from the wrist, noting that having a severed ring finger is an obvious way for the Templars to pick out Assassins. The first "Codex" page that's decrypted is his design for this blade, This doesn't stop Leonardo da Vinci, from taking a moment to freak Ezio out by pinning his hand and raising a meat cleaver before saying "Just kidding" after repairing his father's broken blade he inherited.
    -   In _Brotherhood_ the Prowler — a Templar attempt at fighting Assassins using their own methods — also has a forearm-mounted switchblade, if a wider and less fine-looking one, whose two blades pivot at the back to form a single blade in front. Ezio had to abandon the second (built by Leonardo, right-handed) of his Hidden Blades at the Siege of Monteriggioni, but had the original left-handed one replaced (or covered with a single-piece metal vambrace) upon his arrival in Rome, and Leonardo later constructed for him another right-handed Hidden Blade that now fit into the wrist of a leather glove.
    -   And in _Revelations_, Ezio loses his right-handed hidden blade _again_ (the intro video shows him losing his left-handed hidden blade, but in gameplay he's missing the right-handed one) and has it replaced with one modified by the Assassins in Constantinople to have a hook on the end of the blade, allowing for more maneuverability when climbing and new abilities in combat.
    -   Each of Ezio's recruits in Rome was issued a Hidden Blade created by Leonardo da Vinci (as revealed in the Facebook game _Project Legacy_). By 2000 it had become "mostly ceremonial," but was still in use by the Assassins, and in fact Desmond Miles fought off a Templar invasion of an Assassin safehouse by wielding one.
    -   _Assassin's Creed III_ presents a further variation. Haytham and Connor continue to wield two hidden blades, but the left blade (the one traditionally used for assassinations) has been modified so that it can be pivoted off the mechanism to be used as a clip point knife.
    -   _Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag_ uses a broad-bladed variation that makes the blade look like a dagger. While subtlety is blown (the blade is worn _over_ the clothes), it is also very useful for open combat. They still use two of them.
    -   _Assassin's Creed: Unity_ goes back to one blade, but now it has a mini crossbow attached to it; the new moniker is "Phantom Blade".
    -   _Assassin's Creed Syndicate_ brings back the dual blades, and now they have a hook attached to propel the user on buildings and make impromptu zip-lines.
-   _BioShock 2_: Big Sisters have a massive hypodermic needle which they use to impale enemies.
-   _BloodRayne_: Rayne wears sword-length blades attached to wrist cuffs; they mechanically rotate and extend in the same direction as her lower arms, with grips that she holds to keep them in place.
-   _Champions Online_: The Nephilim and PSI Mooks wear those. While the former can wear them even on their legs, the laters' are made of energy. Like many other costume pieces, blade bracers are unlockable and, despite being purely decorative, very popular amongst the players.
-   _City of Heroes_: With Weapons Customization, several varieties of arm blades are offered as an option for the Claws powerset.
-   _Cortex Command_: In the Dark Storm mod, the Tengu armor guys use an electro-magnetic charged knife which is attached to their wrists (like the Assassin Blade in one of the above examples)in their melee attack, the knife was once a separate weapon in the mod up until lua's introduction in the game.
-   _Doom Eternal_: The Doom Slayer's new armor now sports a massive extendable blade on his left arm.
-   _Fallout 2_: Frank Horrigan sports a massive extendable knife attached onto his armor on his right forearm. Though the armor itself is permanently grafted onto Horrigan, the blade probably is removable for maintenance purposes, and you actually can loot it from him after killing him (though, only by exploiting engine quirks). It's a pretty powerful melee weapon.
-   _Fighting Force_ has female enemies on the 5th state that have these.
-   _Final Fantasy VIII_: Kiros uses a pair of katar (mistranslated in the English-language version as "katal").
-   The first weapon you can use in _Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance_ is a pair of wicked-looking curved blades strapped to your arms, which you use to butcher enemy gladiators. You're given a sword after arriving in the Elysian fields in stage 2.
-   _Guilty Gear_: Chipp Zanuff has an odd variant. His weapon is a blade that runs parallel to his forearm and is attached to a armband he wears there. In the opening animation, he sometimes clicks it into place
-   _Halo_:
    -   The Elites absolutely _love_ this type of weapon, as exemplified by the appearance of the Energy Sword itself, which is effectively an oversized katar. This is often a One-Hit Kill weapon that can turn invisible with its wielder, and (as of _Halo: Reach_) has its own assassination animations when wielded.
    -   In _Halo: Reach_, Elites also carry retractable Energy Daggers in their gauntlets. These are small blades that only appear in assassinations without the sword.
    -   _Halo Wars_: Arbiter Ripa 'Moramee carries full-length swords _on both arms_ with knuckle guards.
    -   Arbiter Thel 'Vadam eventually gets his own custom Energy Sword with a knuckle guard, called the "Prophet's Bane."
-   _League of Legends_: Talon and Zed's signature weapons. Talon uses an oversized katar-like blade on his right arm (unlike the characters he's based on) while Zed uses a pair of katar-like blades mounted in his gauntlets. Both of them are classified as Assassins.
-   _Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver_: When Raziel acquires the Soul Reaver, it manifests as an energy blade extending from his palm.
-   _The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask_: The Garo have a scimitar strapped to each hand. Although they could be holding it under their ponchos, the attacks they use suggest otherwise.
-   _Mass Effect 3_ brings us Omni-blades, diamond-hard searing hot blades flash-forged by one's omni-tool.
-   _Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance_: Sundowner, a cyborg boss, fights with a pair of machetes, one of which he attaches to a hinged clamp on his forearm while holding the other in his hand, which turns his entire arm into a makeshift scissor with enough strength to decapitate any unfortunate soul in between the blades.
-   In _Monster Hunter_, this weapon type would normally fall under the Dual Blades category.
    -   In _Monster Hunter: Rise_, the Goss Harag is capable of using its icy breath to forge blades of ice on its forelimbs.
-   _Mortal Kombat 11_: Rain uses a katar as a weapon in this game.
-   _Otogi: Myth of Demons_: Tsuna has one of these on his left arm as a secondary weapon.
-   _Overlord_: Green minions will convert weapons they pick up into blades attached to the backs of their hands (starting with two blades on only the right hand with very basic equipment, like farming tools and ending with three blades on each hand with the most powerful equipment).
-   _Paladins_: Talus has some kind of stone knuckle duster on his left hand that has rectangular spikes jutting out of it. With it, his punches are hard enough to send foes reeling back despite his small frame.
-   _Planescape: Torment_: Annah dual-wields punch daggers, which she is very good at concealing. . .though how she could conceal much of anything in that outfit is hard to imagine.
-   _\[PROTOTYPE\]_:
    -   Alex Mercer can change his arm into a giant blade from the shoulder down on command. It is sharp enough to slice through the toughest hides and metals including tanks at the cost of having to kill and consume hundreds of people to stay alive.
    -   James Heller and all the other Evolved that Mercer created in the second game also have this ability, more so with the other Evolved who, unlike Heller, seem to have just one special ability and dual armblades from the shoulder down.
-   _Samurai Shodown_: Gen-An's blade-glove and Kusaregedo's bone-spike arm. Going here because they can be dropped or broken away (In the latter case, as with all weapons, a new one shows up moments after).

-   _Star Wars: Republic Commando_: The Melee weapon is a miniature vibroblade mounted into the back of a clone commando's gauntlet. Crosses over slightly with permenanly attached blade because it is a part of the armor. It's very effective.

-   _Street Fighter EX_'s Doctrine Dark wields a pair of retractable katars on the edges of his forearms that pop out below his wrists. Said blades have various lengths depending on D. Dark's special move/super combo.
-   _Strife_: The punch dagger. The only stealth available available besides poison crossbow bolts, the damage it deals depends on how many stamina upgrades the player has. With enough upgrades one can easily stab Templars and Crusader Tanks to death.

-   _World of Warcraft_ features "Fist Weapons" that can range from things that look like brass knuckles to full-arm sleeves featuring teeth, claws, spinning blades and/or other accessories.

    Web Animation 

-   _RWBY_:

    -   Fox uses weapons that encase his hands and attach at his wrists. The blades are so long they extend backwards from his wrist to end somewhere behind his elbows.

    Webcomics 

-   Coheed of the _The Amory Wars_ has several curved blades along his left forearm.
-   Kor'Maril in _Drowtales_ has these to compensate for his height.
-   Zeetha in _Girl Genius_ uses a pair of swords with horizontal grips, similar to Katar (see below), which effectively extend over the tops of her hands.
-   In _Impure Blood_, the Cyborg has this. Roan tears it off and kills him with it.
-   Arminius Vambrey, a vampire hunter in _Sluggy Freelance_, conceals stakes in his sleeves. "And you thought these elbow pads just made me look tenured!"
-   _Waterworks_ features an entire alien race where each person has four long blades affixed to their legs and arms since birth, useful for all kinds of things. They're a major part of the culture, and losing one's blades or not caring for them properly is grounds for social stigma.
-   Baskerville from _Dogfight_ uses this as his main weapon when he fights.
-   Bun-bun of _Sluggy Freelance_ attaches switchblades to the sides of his front paws on his spacesuit in "The Heavens and the Earth" to fight in zero-g. It doesn't work, because his main opponent holds him at bay by putting a hand against his helmet, and the suit lacks the mobility for him to do anything from there.

    Western Animation

-   In the fourth season of _The Venture Bros._, 21 equipped himself with these, as well as developing some muscles.

    Real Life 

-   The Katar.
    -   As well as its larger cousin, the Pata.
    -   The wielder still has to _**hold**_ both katar and pata. They're not attached to the arm; they're just held with a grip perpendicular rather than axial to the blade. That being said, they are almost certainly the inspiration for this kind of weapon in fiction.
-   In reality, a long blade that is parallel to the forearm <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  would be impractical, both because the wrist joint is so important in the use of a sword and because it would be dangerous to the user. A hard blow to the blade could potentially cause the forearm to break.
    -   You could use it to stab people effectively, as the motion for stabbing would be similar to a punch. This was often how the above-mentioned katars and patas were used historically, but no one in _fiction_ ever seems to do that with solid blades.
-   Strap-on climbing spikes are sometimes used by professional tree trimmers or phone linemen to climb tree trunks and telephone poles. Subverted in that they're strapped to the _legs_, not the arms.
-   In its most popular form, the karambit can be attached to one's hand by means of fitting a finger through a hole in the pommel.
-   Undermining this trope was the original purpose of the handshake: To dislodge any concealed weapons from within one's sleeves, and to assure others that one was not carrying anything to begin with. Suffice to say, it was done much more forcefully back in the middle ages than it is today.
-   Ladies and gentlemen, the Serbcutter. Originally it was just a knife for cutting sheaves on the field, but then...

## Permanently-attached blade:

-   Jeremiah Gottwald from _Code Geass_, after having his body effectively rebuilt for the second time, gains two concealed swords, one in each arm. Oddly, his blades are longer than his forearms and clearly are not telescoping, so it's unclear how this actually works without impair his arms when the blades are retracted.
-   Taopaipai from _Dragon Ball_ is rebuilt as a cyborg with this type of blade. He reveals it in his fight with Tenshinhan, using it to inflict the wounds that later become Tenshinhan's chest scars.

-   Both Kusanagi and the Big Bad in _Blue Seed_ can do this thanks to their mitama. They're retractable, but still apparently part of the body.
-   _Raideen_: **God Breaker! Gorgon Sword!**
-   _Gundam_:
    -   There are a few examples all over The 'Verse such as the GM Sniper Custom that has a box beam saber affixed to its left arm, while the Turn Delta has one on each arm.
    -   The RX-0 Unicorn Gundam from the _Gundam Unicorn_ novels/OVA has two beam sabres mounted in its forearms (on flip-out panels) for use in this fashion, the MSN-06S Sinanju also has a pair.

-   Sasori from _Naruto_. He stuck his sword into Sakura's gut. Sakura planned on keeping him focused on her by holding onto the blade, thinking he wouldn't let go and would worry on just finishing her off first; then he detached his puppet limb to reveal a blade within it, and promptly went to finish off Chiyo. Didn't work out too well, he got stabbed right in the heart capsule by the first two puppets he ever created, the ones made in the likeness of his deceased Mother and Father. Then he died.
-   Ikuro Hashizawa of _Baoh_ fame. When in his "Baoh" form, he can brandish one on each arm, made of his own (albeit parasitic form) flesh. Said blades are known as "Reskiniharden Saber Phenomenon." He can even cut them off and throw them.
-   Kars from _Jojos Bizarre Adventure_ has blades on his fore arms that he can retract into his arms at will. Their sharpness is due to the fact that they double as _chainsaws_. He can also sprout blades from his legs. These are all also apparently a biological part of his body.
-   In _Transformers: Cybertron_ Starscream's Cyber Key-activated weapons are a pair of arm-mounted blades. And in Episode 25, he uses them to great effect when he goes on a Foe-Tossing Charge through the entire Autobot army. One is eventually broken, and later replaced with a cannon.

-   The Predator has a pair of forearm-mounted claws on each arm, which pop out to four times their resting length when in use. In _Predator_ 2, when one of them is captured, it is noted that there's no way to remove them without killing him, implying that they'd rather die than be disarmed.
-   RoboCop has a retractable spike that comes out of his right hand, which he uses to interact with machines - but ends up used as a weapon as well.

-   The titular Shin in _Shin Kamen Rider: Prologue_ has a set of razor-sharp protrusions on his forearms that act like serrations on a knife, allowing him to cut into the flesh of his opponents. They're also key to him performing his Finishing Move, in which he jams the serrations of his forearm into his opponent's neck, then rips their head off, taking the spine with it! While the serrations can be seen falling out, they can instantly regrow, descending out from the flesh of Shin's forearm after the previous ones detach

        -   Sabretooth in the same film has Wolverine Claws, what with him being Wolverine's brother. They grow out of his fingernails and are shorter than Wolverine's, but clearly operate on the same principle.

-   The Hork-Bajir in _Animorphs_ are basically walking Cusinart, born with blades attached to their elbows, wrists, ankles, knees, tail and forehead (the poor mother...).

He now regrets having it put into him, though, and is trying to be strong enough not to ever need it.

-   All the way back in the second episode of _The Transformers_, Optimus Prime was able to retract his fist and replace it with a glowing energy axe.

    Real Life 

-   Mantids (such as the Praying Mantis) actually have two of these facing opposite directions that act as pincers when the arms are extended.
-   Mantis shrimp specialized in hunting fish have raptorial arms designed to stabbing. It's already pretty easy considering the species can already punch with the force of a .22 caliber bullet fired from a rifle. This may not count, as the mantis shrimp's "arms" are actually modified mouthparts.
-   One of the most distinctive features of the dinosaur _Iguanodon_ is a thumb spike, a sharp protuberance on both of the dinosaur's hands in the rough position of a thumb on a human hand. There is some debate as to what the spike actually did, with most paleontologists theorizing that it was used for self-defense, or in combat with other _Iguanodon_, wheras others believe it was used to crack open hard-shelled fruits, seeds or nuts.
-   Spinosaurid dinosaurs like Spinosaurus, Baryonyx, and Suchomimus had a greatly enlarged thumb claw. Scientists aren't completely sure what the claw was for, but suspect that it was for clawing fish like a modern grizzly bear or to hold down large prey while ripping it apart with their jaws.

## Blade replaces hand or arm:

    Anime and Manga 

-   Koku from _B: The Beginning_ can turn his left arm into a extremely sharp blade.
    -   Izanami can turn her left leg into a similar blade, an ability that she passes onto Koku after he kills her.
-   Creed's Phantom Blade Lv.3 in _Black Cat_ replaces his arm with a Tao Blade and sprouts an extra arm.
    -   Eve in the same series usually morphs one of her hands into a blade to use as a Shapeshifter Weapon.
-   Shira in _Blade of the Immortal_, after losing a hand, decides to _sharpen the bones in his arm_ and use that as a blade. Apparently, when he decided this he forgot to consider that it would hurt like hell to hit something with it. Like he'd care anyway...
-   In _My-HiME_, Robot Girl Miyu can replace her lower arm with a sword (among other things).
-   Chachamaru in _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ carries one that replaces her standard arm along with an Arm Cannon. How she goes back to her normal arms has yet to be seen.
-   The _Mazinger_ series:
    -   _Mazinger Z_: Mechanical Beast Brutus-M3 had a scimitar-like blade replacing one of its arms.
    -   _Great Mazinger_: Several Mechanical Beasts had bladed weapons -or even spiked maces- instead of hands or arms. The first examples appeared in the last episode of Mazinger-Z (Gratonios) and in the first episode of the sequel.
-   The true form of Allen Walker's Innocence in _D.Gray-Man_ is a BFS that is _made_ from his arm. Different from the usual "third kind" of this trope in that the sword isn't attached to his body any more- he has to hold it in his remaining hand.
-   Snimon from _Digimon_ is a _virus-hunting praying mantis sniper_ (mind you, all of that besides "praying mantis" is All There in the Manual and never witnessed, but he _is_ pretty badass) who cleaves opponents with its giant blades, and is capable of shooting pink crescent beams from them with its Twin Sickles attack (known as Shadow Sickle in Japanese. There's a better version called Ultimate Twin Sickles, which increases the number of energy blades fired.) He's also one of the rare Mons who can overpower Digimon of higher levels than he.
    -   Omegamon/Omnimon's Transcendent Sword is technically this, since it comes out of his "hand" - which is composed of a WarGreymon skull/helmet instead of an actual hand with fingers. (Unlike Snimon, we don't have to worry about how he picks stuff up. This is a Fusion Dance Super Mode saved for special occasions and only taken on under dire circumstances. In his? Their? default form of Agumon and Gabumon, they've got hands, though Agumon doesn't appear to have thumbs.)
        -   Similarly, there's Duskmon. Like Omni/Omegamon, the blades are extended from his "hands" with are shaped like a pair of draconic skulls. Unlike Omnimon, he spends a great deal of time in this form, making one wonder how he held things other than "biting" them.
    -   Shurimon has giant shurikens for hands and feet, and his limbs are actually coils and are extendable. Again, combat form.
-   _One Piece_': Axe-Hand Morgan... well, has an axe for a hand. A big one. Specifically his right forearm has been replaced with an axe, not even bothering to remove the handle, which can be seen stretching out the skin behind his elbow.
-   _Soul Eater_: The bladed Weapons can do this, with Death Scythes like Spirit and Soul managing more varied transformations.

-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_:
    -   One of the combat automail arms that Buccaneer uses over the course of the series, the "Crocodile", is this combined with a _chainsaw_.
    -   Envy at one point turns its lower arm into a blade when fighting Ling. In the original anime, Envy uses the same trick on Ed, except this time he/she _kills him with it_.
-   _Dororo_: Hyakkimaru, the main character, has swords concealed in his prosthetic arms, which slide off just below the elbow when he needs the blades. After he regains his real arms, he switches to wielding the swords as normal.
-   _Gunsmith Cats_: Gray equips himself with a bladed prosthetic after Rally Vincent blows off his hand. He swaps the blade for a hook for everyday use. He can shoot the blade like a spear using a powerful spring built into the forearm.
-   _Genzo_: The wild girl Otsuru uses a rusty blade as prosthetic right hand. Later the main character Genzo build a better curved blade for her.
-   _Brigadoon: Marin and Melan_: The gun-swordsmen have one arm that ends with a blade instead of a hand, and another that ends with an Arm Cannon.
-   _Blood+_: Solomon Goldsmith shapeshifts one of this hands into a blade as a weapon of choice.
-   Baroqueheat in _Dazzle_ can change his right hand and forearm into a sword when he needs to.
-   _Franken Fran_: Gavrill, unlike her sister Veronica , doesn't have blades inside her body, but is able to transform her body into, among other things, said blades.
-   _Accel World_: Deconstructed. Kuroyukihime's avatar was generated with blades instead of arms due to her desire for power at the expense of human relationships. At one point she expresses regret that this means she can't embrace the Innocently Insensitive Haruyuki.
-   _Blame!_: Maeve has a large blade in the place of one of her hands. The other is replaced by an Arm Cannon.
-   _Blue Ramun_: Zig-Zagged — Rowan's dragon Tisuodo has lost his right arm above the elbow, but is able to summon/ create a dragon-headed prosthesis that he can use like a Whip Sword.
-   _Gamaran Shura_: after being deprived of his right arm, psycho assassin Raio Magami didn't give up fighting and instead crafted himself a katar-like scissor blade he calls "Vajra" and attached it to his right arm as a new weapon alongside his \[\[Whip Sword Urumi). He even developed a technique specifically for Vajra.

    Comic Books 

-   _Shang-Chi_ minor villain Razorfist, as the name implies, has two foot blades replacing each hand. The difficulty of, for example, eating are frequently lampshaded; Razorfist shirks all responsibility onto others to care for him (and they do because oh crap he is a crazy muscular martial artist with freaking swords for hands). This Razorfist is actually the second or third, depending on how you count it - he originally shared the name with his brother, each having only one blade-hand. He's so used to them that, whenever someone decides to replace them for prosthetic hands, he gets completely lost on how to use them.
-   Razorsharp of The DCU team books _Psyba-Rats_ and _Blood Pack_ was a Playful Hacker (with Cracker tendencies) whose superpower was that her arms could morph into swords. In _Psyba-Rats_ she mainly used them to climb walls and break into buildings (in a good cause, usually); in _Blood Pack_ she was reluctantly put in a position where she'd have to use them in combat.
-   _The Avengers_ villain The Grim Reaper has a scythe blade on his right hand. Originally it was a Type One "techno-scythe" supplied by the Tinkerer. Later, his right hand got amputated and replaced by a magical scythe when he was empowered by the demon Lloigoroth.
-   Amokk, from _Hyperkind_, has his hands replaced with foot-long blades. In the second issue, he laments that he'll never play the guitar again, until he and the rest of the team discover that they can shapeshift back to their human forms.
-   _Batman and the Outsiders_: The Outsiders once fought a villain named Nunchuku, who instead of hands, had, well... what do you expect? He was arguably one of the _less_ silly opponents The Outsiders faced.

    Film — Animated 

-   In _Quest for Camelot_ Ruber does this towards the end with Excalibur with a magic potion that combines objects.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   The blind Persian executioner in _300_ has swords instead of arms.
-   In _Child's Play 2_, Chucky's hand is ripped off when a door closes on it. He then uses his remaining hand to stab his knife into the floor and remove the handle from the blade, and then _plunges the blade into his arm stump_.
-   Hyakkimaru from the movie _Dororo_ has a sword in place of each arm, covered by a functional artificial limb (much like Vash's left 'hand-gun'.
-   _Edward Scissorhands_ has, well, blades instead of fingers.
-   _Enter the Dragon_. Han replaces his (false) hand with a torashuko claw in his iconic fight with Bruce Lee's character.

-   All the monsters from _Frankenstein's Army_ have meathooks, saws, or Jaws-of-Life for hands.
-   Azog of _The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies_ has a thin orc blade to replace the arm he lost in a previous battle outside Moria. However in the previous two films he had a simple mock metal forearm and hand, meaning he could also qualify as a Type I<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
-   In the made-for-TV movie adaptation of _Moby-Dick_ (the one that stars Patrick Stewart as Captain Ahab), Ahab and crew meet up with another whaling ship, whose captain lost an arm to the white whale. He had it replaced with a harpoon.
-   Cogliostro from _Spawn (1997)_ can turn his arm into a glowing sword, or at least the movie version can.
-   One ability of the shape-shifting T-1000 in _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_. He gives Todd an arm-blade through the mouth while posing as Janelle when John calls up his (now-dead) foster parents.
-   _Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings_ features an Elite Mook who has had one forearm replaced with a retractable, apparently red-hot-at-the-edges blade; his license plate is RZRFST and his car has a giant, graffiti-tag RAZOR FIST on the side, so he's pretty definitely the MCU version of Razor Fist (See comics, above), albeit one with fewer limb-blades, but more brains.
-   _Wild Wild West_. When Jim West fights several of Mad Scientist Dr. Loveless's altered men inside the giant mechanical spider, one of them has extendable sword blades implanted in his arms instead of hands.
-   In _X-Men: Days of Future Past_, while the Future Sentinel’s Eye Beams are quite powerful, they are slow to charge, and when caught up close they tend to resort to forming their arms into pikes and running targets through.

    Literature 

-   In the third part of Piers Anthony's _Battle Circle Trilogy_, Neq the Sword, the titular character has his hands cut off by bandits. The surgeon who he rescued at the same time agrees to replace his left hand with a simple prosthetic claw, and his right with a sword. Unfortunately, his bad temper, coupled with a sword permanently attached to his arm, wind up causing unnecessary deaths. He remedies this by welding a glockenspiel to the sword so that it would never kill again. !
-   In _The Malazan Book of the Fallen_, the K'Chain Che'Malle (Big intelligent lizard creatures) are bred for specific purposes, so the K'ell Hunters have big blades instead of claws or hands.

-   In _After the Golden Age_, the supervillain Steel uses his power to turn his lower arms into steel blades.
-   Assault Sergeant Tellos from the _Soul Drinkers_ series lost his hands in battle but, due to extensive nerve damage, was unable to have them replaced with bionics. So that he could continue fighting in service of his Chapter, Tellos jammed chainsword blades into the stumps.
-   In the _Saga of Egil One-Hand and Asmund the Berserkerslayer_, the young warrior Egil loses his right hand in combat with a giant, but later he earns the gratitude of a dwarf who heals his wound and then forges a special sword for him which has a socket instead of a hilt so it can be fixed on Egil's arm stump. With this device Egil can fight as before, and in fact becomes a feared swordsman.

    Live-Action TV

-   In the _Torchwood_ episode "Sleeper", the sleeper agents of Cell 114 have arm blades that aren't pleasant to look at.
-   Tons of _Ultra Series_ kaiju fall under this category, but perhaps the most notable one is Dorako from the original _Ultraman_, who looks an awful lot like a non-cyborg version of Gigan above (and keep in mind that Gigan debuted in 1972 while Dorako first appeared in 1966).
    -   Ultraman Max and Ultraman Mebius (plus Ultraman Hikari) have these weapons as part of their movesets; Max can summon a wrist-mounted energy blade called the Max Galaxy, which he uses to fire an incredibly powerful beam, summon forcefields and channel solar energy into his body, while Mebius and Hikari can both summon forearm-mounted energy swords from their braces to slice away at foes.
    -   Ultraman Agul can form a Laser Blade from his hand as a melee weapon. Gaia gains the ability to do the same after receiving Agul's light, and even has a sword duel with Bizorm, a monster who can do the same, in Episode 42.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Games Workshop games:
    -   In _Necromunda_, Pit Slaves are generally modified by their owners so that they can perform their duties more efficiently. Scrap slaves will have their arms and hands replaced with buzz saws, mining slaves will be outfitted with rock drills and fungus harvesting slaves will gain a pair of razor sharp shears. Those slaves who find themselves in the fighting pits of the underhive often have chainswords fitted to their arms in place of their hands with the famous rebel slave Bull Gorg having both his hands replaced with a pair of turbo chainswords.
    -   Skrag the Slaughterer from _Warhammer_ had his hands removed after he angered the Tyrant of his former tribe. To stop the bleeding, Skrag jammed cleavers into the stumps and now uses them to slice 'n' dice his victims.

    -   Rules for replacing a missing hand with a hook, short sword, or hand axe were present in older editions of the game, though they've been absent since 3.0 Edition since starting then rules for having a limb chopped off were taken out of the game.

    Video Games 

-   The Butchers from _Dead Island_ are highly aggressive zombies whose arms end in razor-sharp bony stubs they use as weapons. It's implied their Horror Hunger drove them to chew their own hands off.
-   Three of the Blight Ganons from _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_ make use of this trope.
    -   Waterblight Ganon can project an energy spear from a block at the end of its left arm.

-   _Warcraft_ features Kargath Bladefist, who leads the Shattered Hand clan of orcs. The Shattered Hand clan has its origins in the orcs enslaved in mines by ogres. They were kept from escaping by having one hand chained to a wall while they worked. One day, Kargath decided he'd had enough, so he strangled his overseer with his chain and sliced off his manacled hand, replacing it with a blade. He then encouraged his fellow slaves to follow his example, and they rose up and killed their ogre masters.
-   _StarCraft_:
    -   The Zerg Hydralisk has arms that end in huge scythe-blades that it cannot use in combat (although it does in cutscenes), because somebody was unable to incorporate melee and projectile attacks in one unit. In _StarCraft II_, it's able to finally use those blades, even if the difference between a blade swipe and its regular ranged attack is minor at best.
    -   The Ultralisk which has two giant Kaiser Blades on its head.
-   In _League of Legends_, Urgot, prior to his rework, has one arm replaced with a blade, the other replaced with a CANNON. The skin Dreadnova Gangplank also replaces most of Gangplank's body with cybernetic augmentations, complete with his sword arm becoming a blade from elbow-down.
-   Blade Golems in _Neverwinter Nights 2_ including one controlled by the player.

    -   _Any_ Sword Chip in the _Battle Network_ (and _Mega Man Star Force_) series.
-   The forearms of the _Pokémon_ Kabutops take the form of curved blades.
    -   Scyther as well.
    -   And Gallade.
        -   Gallade has fingers. The blades are on its elbows, like a Guyver.
    -   In the fifth generation, Pawniard and Bisharp have them. (being basically _made of living blades_)
    -   In the ninth generation, Ceruledge has two blades made of fire and ghost energy for arms.

-   Space Pirate grunts in _Metroid Prime 2: Echoes_ seem to have replaced one of their limbs with a blade.
    -   Although considering the Pirates are giant Flying Mantises, how do you distinguish their regular arms from blades?
-   Krauser in _Resident Evil 4_ gains this<small>◊</small> as a mutation when infected with Las Plagas. Appropriately enough, considering he's an amoral knife-wielder.

-   The player characters of _\[PROTOTYPE\]_ and _\[PROTOTYPE 2\]_ are practically in _love_ with this kind of weaponry. Three out of their five offensive powers involve turning their arms into bladed implements. The _Claws_ ability "merely" grows oversized arms that end in foot-long, razor-sharp "fingers", the _Whipfist_ produces an extendable tentacle with a razor end, and their iconic (and aptly named) _Blade_ power turns the entire right arm into a big, honking sword of destruction roughly as big as themselves.
-   _Xenosaga_: This is one of KOS-MOS's many, many abilities.
-   _Mega Man_:
    -   Sword Man has a sword fitted to his right arm in _Mega Man 8_.

-   The March Hare from _Alice: Madness Returns_ sports one of these, but never gets to use it.
-   In _Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance_, the demon Drahmin wields an iron club in place of his right hand and forearm (and it's always on the right).
-   One of them happens in the _Saw II: Flesh & Blood_ video game, with a victim.
-   _The Elder Scrolls_:
    -   In _Daggerfall_, Ebonarm is a god of war worshiped in the Iliac Bay region as the companion and guardian of all warriors. He has an ebony blade permanently fused to his right arm, hence his Meaningful Name. He is also a Black Knight, never seen without his suit of dark ebony armor.
    -   In _Oblivion_, in the _Shivering Isles_ expansion, we have the Gatekeeper, a sizeable Frankenstein-like monster guarding the entrance to the Isles. One of his arms is a giant blade. After killing the monster, we are tasked later on with putting him back together, using various body parts. For his arm, we can choose between the exact same blade and also an axe and a mace. The cut content suggests that there was also a regular fist to be included too...
-   In _Rimworld_ you can replace your pawns' arms, weather they lost the limb or not, with Mechanoid blades. This, predictably, gives the pawn in question a severe penalty to work they do compared to even a regular prosthetic, but it equally predictably gives an excellent modifier to melee attacks. Assuming the pawn is unarmed, anyway, since the game AI will prioritize held weapons even if their arm blades are superior.
-   _Zone of the Enders_: Both Dolores in _Dolores, i_ and Testament in _Fist of Mars_ use Type 3 Morph Weapons, with their entire forearms changing to a blade or Arm Cannon when needed.
-   _Aliens vs. Predator: Extinction_ introduces the Ravager xenomorph. It's main form of attack are two massive blades (called Hullblades) in place of its hands and it's the only type of xenomorph that kills it's prey outright instead taking them alive to use as hosts as it's the hives answer to the human and predator Elite Mooks.
-   In _Dark Devotion_, the twisted little green monsters in the Den of Corrupted Nature have bony scythes in place of hands. They occasionally drop these blades when they die, allowing the player to wield them like a pair of knives.

    Webcomics 

-   Captain Hawkins from _Girl Genius_ has a sword as one of the many prosthetic attachments for her missing right hand.
-   The demon Mosp of _Sluggy Freelance_ has a long curving spike on each arm just below her elbows. They used to be handheld swords when she was human, but she was turned into a demon as punishment for betraying her whole dimension by letting the invading demon force pass through the dungeon she once guarded. Her swords fusing with her body was part of the transformation.
-   _The Order of the Stick_ has a minor character named Captain Axe. He has an axe in place of one of his hands. He seems to be a take on Hook Hand.
-   _Trevor (2020)_: Trevor can form bone-bladed appendages.
-   _Jungle Juice_ has Insect Humans, who are merged with different kinds of insects. One of the more prominent ones are those merged with a Mantis, giving them these.

    Western Animation 

-   _Final Space_:
    -   Gary's prosthetic robot arm can reconfigure into a stabbing blade this.
    -   After merging with a Titan, the Lord Commander can transform his arm into a stabbing blade.
-   _Generator Rex_: one of Rex's favoured weapons, after the dual Power Fist, is to transmute his hand into a BFS.
-   Shiv, a supporting _Static Shock_ villain, could replace his hands with nifty energy blades. If memory serves, this power was relatively versatile, but true to his name, he always came back to this...
-   _Transformers_:
    -   Optimus Prime again, this time in _Transformers: Generation 1_, with an Energon axe in the three-part Series Premiere. Megatron had an Energon Mace. Despite using these weapons only that one time in the entire series, they're considered iconic to the characters, and even referenced by similar weapons in the movie listed above. Both of the characters Masterpiece series toys included plastic versions of the weapons. These were more of a combination of the second and third types, given that they retracted their hands to deploy them.
    -   Yet another Optimus: his _Transformers: Prime_ incarnation has two arm-blades _and_ two arm-cannons. Both of Ratchet's arms can also become short swords ("I recommend dissection.")
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987)_

-   When Villain of the Week Zorax loses his gun, he makes swords appear from his wrist gauntlet. He matches Leonardo blow for blow, then cuts one of Leonardo's swords (a katana) in half.

    Real Life 

-   Not quite a blade, but a man named Aron Ralston who, after getting his arm trapped under a boulder for 5 days whilst mountain climbing, _cut off his own arm to free himself_, then proceeded to replace the amputated limb with an ice pick and climb the crap out of some more mountains.
-   Galvarino, war leader of the Mapuche tribe in the 16th century, was captured by the Spanish and had both his hands cut off to serve as a visual warning to the rest of his tribe. Because he was a total badass, however, he went back to the tribe, got them super-pissed at the Spanish, and then _tied blades to his arms_ to compensate for the fact that he had no hands. He then proceeded to lead an army against the bastards who disfigured him. The Spanish ended up killing him eventually (they wanted to let him go because they felt sorry for him, but he would hear none of it), but it's important to note that the Mapuche tribe was one of the few that never fell under Spanish rule (it joined Chile in the 18th century).
-   Before modern prosthetics, individuals who lost a hand in an accident or in combat could have a hook fitted over the stump.
-   The dinosaur _Mononykus_ had lost two of the fingers on its hands, leaving only a large single claw (hence the name: "One Claw"). It's suspected that it may have used this claw to break into insect nests like a modern anteater.
