A TV Tropes seal of adorableness!

Seals are almost universally beloved for their cute appearance and playful behavior. Their face looks similar to a dog or cat<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , making them the aquatic version of a Precious Puppy or Cute Kitten. This often carries over into fiction, when seals are portrayed as adorable and benevolent characters. One common kind of seal that is depicted are baby harp seals, which have plump bodies in snow white coats, big dark eyes and are entirely helpless on the ice. To make them even cuter, they may be depicted balancing a ball on their head or nose.

Although sea lions are much rarer in fiction than seals are, they can be included here too. Sea lions as well as their close cousins, the fur seals, are different from true seals — they have ear flaps, flippers that allow them to "walk" on land, and more — but the pinnipeds are similar enough that a separate trope for sea lions isn't necessary.

Selkies and Wereseals can also be included.

Compare Warm-Hearted Walrus, Playful Otter, Friendly, Playful Dolphin, and Heroic Dolphin. Contrast Monstrous Seal. Has nothing to do with a certain British R&B singer.

    Real Life 

-   Reddit has a subreddit, r/Seals, for those who prefer the sweeter side of their pinnipeds.
-   Real seals and sea lions zigzag this trope depending on the species and individual. While some larger species like elephant seals, leopard seals, and the larger sea lions are certainly large enough and sport lethal dentition to be dangerous; attacks on humans are extremely rare. Still, any animal is dangerous if it feels threatened, and all seals are large and toothy enough to defend themselves effectively, so it's wise to give any wild pinniped, especially the multi-ton species, their space.
    -   Leopard seals are especially subject to this based off individual basis. Several recorded attacks and at least one fatality have been attributed to the species, but others are completely docile towards humans to the point of offering humans food (in the form of a mauled penguin) thinking they might be hungry.
    -   Elephant seals are typically gentle giants around humans despite their enormous size and the males' tendency to fight each other. Still, again, give them their space as a 4,000-kilogram elephant seal might throw its weight around without meaning to.
-   In September 2022, a Gray Seal found his way into Shoe Pond in the town of Beverly, Massachusetts. The seal was promptly dubbed "Shoebert" and became a local celebrity, as he showed little fear of humans and didn't mind being watched and photographed at all. After a week in Shoe Pond, Shoebert turned himself in at the local police station, and was promptly taken to Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut for rehabilitation and release back into the ocean.
-   This trope is invoked and exploited with Paro, a therapeutic robot in the form of a baby harp seal that responds positively to being petted, and is intended to calm people with anxiety and other emotional problems.
