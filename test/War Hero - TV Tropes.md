A character is specifically mentioned as having served in the military _and_ been decorated for heroism on the battlefield. It can be an important plot point, or simply a mentioned-in-passing part of the character's backstory that has no relevance on the plot or story other than expanding on the person's background. They may still be serving or have been discharged/retired. They may be an Old Soldier, Shell-Shocked Veteran, Blood Knight, or an example of I Did What I Had to Do. They can be a heavily muscled, tattoo-covered biker who will cheerfully treat you to a Scar Survey if you'd like, or a quiet, unassuming type whom you'd dismiss as an accountant or secretary until the shit hits the fan and Let's Get Dangerous! comes out to play. Will often overlap with Dad the Veteran, and will make his Papa Wolf mode all the more serious due to his training and experience. Chest of Medals may also come into play. If the character moves on to costumed crimefighting, they're a Military Superhero.

There is absolutely no reason that they have to be a man. With women taking on more and more roles in the military, particularly roles involving direct combat, the opportunities for women being recognized for courage under fire have greatly increased.

The character can be a police officer but earned their awards while serving in the military. All law enforcement agencies have their own awards for recognizing valor, but these are not considered wartime decorations making one this trope. This does _not_ detract in any way from the dangers police officers face on the job.

The Phony Veteran will often use illegally-obtained awards and falsified documents to pass as one of these.

One of our Military and Warfare Tropes.

**No Real Life Examples, Please!** - Suffice it to say there are countless people and animals who have been recognized for courage during wartime. However, listing real people who are portrayed by actors in films, biopics, etc. is acceptable as long as they are placed in the appropriate folder and not in a Real Life section.

    Comic Book 

-   Captain America: Fought in WWII on every front at some point. Throughout his comic history, it is common occurrence to run into an aged veteran or descendant of such whose life he saved. He's heavily decorated, but since he rarely wears a military uniform and doesn't display his decorations it's difficult to determine exactly what his decorations are.

    Fanfiction 

-   _The Negotiations-verse_: In a rare case of an unnamed character being one, the sniper who killed Shining Armor is highly decorated for it and viewed highly.
-   The Amalgam'Verse: In _The Battle of Mount Erebus_, Mugal is a Simian veteran who was propped up by the government and propaganda offices as such for his spectacular service and it earned him the rank of High Marshall. The concept is brutally deconstructed as the cushy command rank is meant to keep him out of the action he craves, he feels a mountain of guilt for all the youths who enlisted because of his image, and absolutely loathes the reputation it got him because of the blind hero-worship many give him.

    Films — Animation 

-   _The Jungle Book (1967)_: Colonel Hathi mentions having received the Victoria Cross while serving in "the Maharajah's Fifth Pachyderm Brigade" (how it could be given to an elephant is anyone's guess).

He received two Purple Hearts and was the youngest man ever to be decorated by the President. However, Plisskin robbed a Federal Reserve depository and was sentenced to the Manhattan prison. Hauk tells Plisskin "I'm ready to kick your ass out of the world, war hero."
-   _The Godfather:_ In the original novel, Detective Phillips, trying to protect Michael Corleone, specifically says "He's a war hero." Indeed Michael is: his deeds earned him several medals, including the Navy Cross, Silver Star, Purple Heart, and _LIFE_ magazine ran a photo layout story on him.
-   _Heartbreak Ridge_ has Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Highway approaching retirement, and stationed at Cherry Point to whip some punk-ass privates into fighting shape. His charges think the sergeant is just a relic marking time, but he's no slouch at combat, being a decorated veteran of the Korean and Vietnam Wars. Among a _great_ many other awards for valor, he also has the Medal of Honor. His men soon learn that the sergeant is a Jerkass with a Heart of Gold, giving them some Training from Hell, but also playing fair and honest in his comportment.
-   _It's a Wonderful Life_: During World War II, Harry becomes a naval fighter pilot, becoming an ace, and shooting down two kamikaze that were aiming for a transport full of troops, for which he is awarded the Medal of Honor.

-   _To Hell and Back,_ the Biopic of Audie Murphy, ends with his Medal of Honor ceremony. The picture actually underplays the exploits that led to his decoration.
-   _Once Upon a Time in Hollywood_: Cliff Booth in is described in those words by Rick Dalton, and his considerable hand-to-hand skills back the claim up. Which war isn't specified, but the actor's age makes WWII the likeliest.

Interestingly, Sheriff Teasle is also a decorated veteran of the Korean War. While being booked, Rambo sees his citation for having been awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. This saves Teasle's life later. When Rambo ambushes Teasle's men and kills several, Teasle panics and runs away.

-   Belamy from _Skate the Thief_ had a distinguished military career decades before the book starts, picking up the moniker "The Iron Wind" on the battlefield.

-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_: There are several characters who are commended for their prowess in battle:

-   The _NCIS_ episode "Call Of Silence" is about a WWII veteran who earned the Medal of Honor for his actions at the Battle of Iwo Jima trying to turn himself in for murdering a fellow Marine on the battlefield.

Fortunately, Kirk's defense attorney saw right through this ploy and insisted that more of Kirk's list of medals be read into the record.
    
    **Cogley:** I wouldn't want to slow the wheels of progress. But then on the other hand, I wouldn't want those wheels to run over my client in their unbridled haste.

    **Computer:** Awards of Valor, Medal of Honor, Silver Palm with Cluster, Starfleet Citation for Conspicuous Gallantry, Karagite Order of Heroism...
