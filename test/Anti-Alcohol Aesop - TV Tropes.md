_"The words "rum" and "death" should mean the same to you. Understand?"_

It is widely known amongst people that alcohol abuse, especially in the long run, is bad for you. It can lead to lowered inhibitions, impulsive behaviour, poor decision making and even death, to say nothing of the damaging effects (such as loss of brain cells and liver damage) that it can have on the body itself. Naturally, this is something that many works try to teach their viewers about.

The way this Aesop usually goes is that a person is convinced into drinking alcohol, usually after hearing of its benefits, or due to succumbing to peer pressure. It is usually at this point that the negative aspects start to show themselves, and the characters may make a horrific decision which usually convinces them to lay off the drink. A common way in which this is represented is through drunk driving, since that can lead to serious injury or even death. (Best-case scenario, they realize they put their life and others' in serious danger; worst-case scenario, they become a Scare 'Em Straight cautionary tale.) Alternatively, they may become so reliant on alcohol to cope that they begin to neglect their relationships and work, leading to stress and concern among their colleagues and family members.

Usually, the work will end with them getting help, quitting alcohol and becoming a Recovered Addict, although more realistic works may also show the character struggling with cutting alcohol and falling Off the Wagon a couple of times afterward. A more depressing take on the Aesop is if the character downright dies from their alcohol intake, either through a stupid alcohol-inhibited decision or otherwise as a result of the physical damage that alcohol can inflict on the body. The general point of the matter is that alcohol can ruin lives. A more nuanced version of this Aesop is that alcohol is fine as long as it's taken in moderation. As such, if you go overboard with it or use it as a coping mechanism, that's when stuff goes wrong.

Compare A Weighty Aesop, Disease-Prevention Aesop, Missed Meal Aesop, and Sleep Aesop for similar health-related Aesops. Also, see Drugs Are Bad for a general message of drugs being bad for you. See Descent into Addiction for when this comprises an arc. Usually delivered as a Very Special Episode. Can lead to a Special Aesop Victim if someone dies or gets severely injured via alcoholism.

    Literature 

-   _The Shining_ was conceived as a way of discussing the destructive effects of alcoholism, based on Stephen King's own struggles with it. The book emphasizes that Jack Torrance (who King based heavily on himself) is a good man who became corrupted by drinking, with his relapse during the book's events leaving him vulnerable to the Overlook Hotel's influence. Part of King's mixed feelings towards the 1980 film adaptation stem from how much it downplays this aspect, instead depicting Jack as an abusive husband whose alcoholism is just one component of his toxicity.
-   "Old Bugs" by H. P. Lovecraft tells the story of an old alcoholic to tries to prevent a young man from going down the same path that he did. Lovecraft was well-known to be a teetotaler and apparently wrote the story as an intended warning to a friend who didn't hold the same views.

        **Buffy:** I told one lie, I had one drink.  
        **Giles:** Yes, and you were very nearly devoured by a giant demon snake. The words "let that be a lesson" are a tad redundant at this juncture.

He then spends the week driving everyone nuts with his temperance lectures. Until, that is, a very grueling session in the operating room, including trying to put the pin back in a live grenade.

Following this, he gives up alcohol for good in Volume 7 to avoid becoming The Load.
-   _The Walten Files_: The entire series carries a strong anti-drinking message, as Bunnyfarm reveals that the Bunny Smiles tragedies began due to the Plot Triggering Deaths of Jack Walten's kids, Edd and Molly, when Felix Kranken was driving them home from a school party while drunk and ended up crashing the car.

-   _The Simpsons_: Parodied in "A Star is Burns". At a local film festival, Barney Gumble submits an entry entitled "Pukahontas", showing masterful cinematic filmmaking warning of the dangers of alcohol.
