Sometimes they're too young and inexperienced. Sometimes they're too reckless. Sometimes they made the wrong friends and the wrong enemies. Or perhaps they are just the "wrong" sex. But for whatever reason, the potential hero is prohibited from joining the others on their quest to destroy the Big Bad.

Of course, the official heroes are inevitably captured and await their fate, their plans of saving the world dashed to smithereens. Who could possibly save them now? Aha, the Prohibited Hero has decided to snub the authorities (or employ Exact Words) and come along anyway, often becoming The Cavalry. It's a good thing too, because not only does he rescue the regular heroes, he usually manages to simultaneously foil the Big Bad's Evil Plan. If only the authorities had had some faith in him in the first place.

Those prone to Fridge Logic may wonder if the delayed arrival of the Prohibited Hero contributed to her success. It's possible that had she gone with the others, she would have been captured along with them. It may be that part of her success is that she was the Wild Card the Big Bad was not expecting.

Compare Changed My Mind, Kid when it's the Hero who made the decision not to come along, then relents. Also see Rebuff the Amateur.

The students get Bakugo to safety, which allows All Might to fight his arch-enemy All For One without having to worry about anyone getting caught in the crossfire. Afterwards their teacher Eraser Head tells them that the only reason they aren't getting expelled (along with the classmates because they knew about the rescue operation but didn't tell the teachers) was that All Might was forced to retire after the battle and heroes are needed more than ever before.

The hobbits are frequently encouraged to return to the Shire and let others take responsibility for the Ring, especially Pippin, the youngest of the group. All four of them prove to be vital to the quest in different ways. The same goes for Eowyn.

Lois reluctantly calls for help and Jordan comes in, easily taking out the bad guys and freeing his mother and grandfather.

    Video Games

(This could be one of the reasons that led to its disbandment next year.)

    Western Animation

-   In the _The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3_ episode "Super Koopa", the heroes chase King Koopa to Paris to save Luigi, but Princess Toadstool tells Toad to stay behind, who complains, "I always stay behind!"

-   _DuckTales (2017)_: A recurring motif in the season finales.
    -   In season one, Donald forbids the triplets and Webby from joining in on the assault on the Money Bin because Magica De Spell is too dangerous for them to face. They decide to go anyway, and their unique fighting styles serve to bewilder Magica enough to make an impact. Subverted or Invoked, depending on how you look at it. Donald specifically told them to stay behind _knowing_ that they would disobey and find a way to get there right when he needed them.
    -   In season two, Scrooge sends the kids away to find allies, but it's later revealed that he was trying to keep them out of the fight to protect them.

    -   In season three, Scrooge compiles his teams of fighters, which include none of the children. The kids all get together and outright tell the adults (paraphrased) "Even if you leave us, you know we're just going to follow. So are you going to include us or not?" Scrooge concedes and brings them along as reserves.

-   Benedict Arnold was relieved of command by commanding general Horatio Gates in the 18-day interregnum between the first Battle of Saratoga (Freeman's Farm) and the second battle of Saratoga (Bemis Heights).

He proceeded to leave his tent, gather up a bunch of American soldiers—in defiance of orders, and without any authority other than his own personality—and lead the charge that broke the British line.
