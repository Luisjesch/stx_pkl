Is it two-ply? Is it durable? Is it absorbent? _Who cares?_ It's got cute widdle puppies!

_"Throw puppies at a problem and the problem may not disappear, but who cares? There will be puppies!"_

— **_Ōkamiden_ review**, _Official Nintendo Magazine_

A work is not about dogs, but throws them in anyway.

The reason is usually that dogs are cool, and puppies are also cute. You just want to love them, pet them, just cuddle up to them, and let them lick the frown off your face. For this reason, puppies and other forms of dogs are likely to show up in fiction, just because they make everything better. Heck, there's a reason Pet the Dog and Kick the Dog have "dog" in the name, since doing nice or bad things to them sets such a strong tone for the character doing those.

A common schtick for guys to attract girls in fiction on TV: borrow or rent a puppy so the girls will come coo over it and admire the guy for his sensitivity.

Compare Cute Kitten, Sweet Seal, Cunning Like a Fox, Fun Size, Canis Major, Big Friendly Dog, Robot Dog, Canine Companion, and note that one person's precious little pup is another's Mister Muffykins. If the puppies distract from another situation, then a Cuteness Proximity situation has occurred.

-   In _Tales of Symphonia_, one of the little miniquests involves Colette attempting to name every stray dog in the game.
    -   Which only makes her literal Kick the Dog moment when she's brainwashed after the Disc-One Final Dungeon that much more horrifying.
-   In _The Sims 3_, a Sim who uses the "Awwww" interaction on a puppy will receive the +10 moodlet "Puppies!" for one Sim hour. A dog that had just given birth to a litter of puppies will give herself and her family the +80 moodlet "New Puppies" for one Sim day. All the same things work with Cute Kittens, too.
-   Pom from _Them's Fightin' Herds_ is a lamb who has small, adorable puppies to help her in fights.
-   _Tomodachi Life_ has the Rent-A-Dog Coupon level-up gift, which allows the Mii possessing it to play with a puppy, whether by themselves or with friends.

-   The Nostalgia Chick shouts "Puppies!" as a Running Gag. She also has her own puppy who appears in review. In the show its named Mignion, and in real life it's named Kali.
-   The Shiba Inu Puppy Cam
-   The website www.sanger.dk, which is nothing but an endlessly-looping .gif of a pug puppy licking at the screen.
-   On YouTube, there's a video of high school kids performing "Give Us Your Money" from _Avenue Q_. When Nicky tries to think of something that he could get for Rod as a peace offering, he says "I know! I'll get him a puppy!" Guess the PTA wasn't crazy about Rod getting a boyfriend.
-   YouTube personality Tobuscus has a video clip series called "Cute Win Fail". Needless to say, the "Cute" segment (and occasionally "Win") has a disproportionately high number of dogs doing absurdly cute things, with babies and cats as the other favorites.
-   The Spoony One now has a spotted puppy named Oreo. She's energetic and often shows up in vlogs wanting to play.
-   This is why Francis, a grey French Poodle, is the "host" for the YouTube cooking show _Cooking with Dog_.
-   Popular Youtuber, Trevor Martin, got himself a Golden Retriever puppy on February 2015, since then it has frequently featured in his videos.
-   A quick look through Markiplier's channel and Facebook page tells us he is very much a dog person. Multiple vlogs have shown him playing with Chica, a Golden Retriever he adopted, or the dogs his mother and brother have.
-   The _Twitter_ account Can You Pet the Dog?, which is Exactly What It Says on the Tin, exists to catalogue specific examples of this trope in Video Games - are you able to pet a dog that appears in a video game?
-   Horribly, _horribly_ subverted in _Welcome to Night Vale_. In the middle of Year Four, we have the first appearance of (former) Intern Maureen's beagle puppy, who Cecil gushes about when she comes in with him to the station one day. As the puppy continue to appear, it became clear that there was something up with him. And then in _Past Time_, a viewer writes to Cecil saying that they saw the puppy and was unable to stop feeling ill since; even Cecil starts to feel a little sick when he sees the puppy at the end of the episode. The Faceless Old Woman in _The April Monologues_ says that the puppy was something that Chad had summoned, and that she herself is terrified of him. Oh, and he is probably Satan.
-   _Zero Punctuation_: Yahtzee is marginally more favorable to games that prominently feature cute dogs (except, ironically enough, _Nintendogs_). He's even more favorable if the dogs are either helpful to the player, or if you actually get to play as the dog as part of the game mechanics. He's also hinted that he prefers the company of dogs to people, which is probably entirely correct.
-   _It's Alive! with Brad_: Whenever he encounters a dog, Brad will immediately stop what he's doing to fuss over it. Special mention goes to Toby Goofy, a tiny, utterly precious pup Brad met while learning to make chocolate in Ecuador. After that, any time Brad's projects involve chocolate, there will be a flashback to Toby Goofy.
-   BuzzFeed _Celeb_ has a line of videos where celebrities play with cute puppies while answering fan questions for absolutely no reason other than they are adorable and it's fun to watch famous people fawn over them like you would. Here's Jake Gyllenhaal's.
-   _Tucker Budzyn_ naturally features these frequently, including the videos of Tucker himself as a puppy, alongside the ones with Pearl and Flutter.

    Western Animation 

-   _Barbie & Her Sisters in the Great Puppy Adventure_: Puppies factor into the adventure, with Taffy helping to save the day. A lot of other movies in the Barbie franchise feature adorable animals as tag-alongs to the story, though usually Barbie has either a kitten or a puppy.
-   _Bee and Puppycat_: Puppycat, since he's apparently a Cute Kitten _and_ a dog.
-   _Blinky Bill_: Shifty Dingo.
-   _Blue's Clues_: Blue, Magenta, and Green Puppy.
-   _Codename: Kids Next Door_: Valerie has a pink poodle named "Tinkypuppypoodlepepon" which even the allergic-to-affection Numbah 4 can't resist melting over.
-   _Dora the Explorer_: Dora's puppy, Perrito (Spanish for "puppy") makes things so much more precious that Swiper won't swipe a gift once he learns that it's for Perrito.
-   _Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes_: One episode has a brief bit where Johnny brings a dog into the lab. Reed warns Johnny that he won't save the Torch from Sue's wrath. But Sue's only reaction is to squeal and go "Puppy!"
-   _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_: The episode "Who Let the Dogs In?" has Eduardo taking care of an adorable puppy (he names it "Chewy") and ends up finding many more, which Mac and the others (but not Bloo) also find adorable. Turns out the puppies are all imaginary, and each extraordinary in its own way.
-   _The Get Along Gang_: Dotty Dog from the 1984 series is a female spaniel who's one of the show's leading characters and also a cheerleader. _The Get Along Gang Along_ was also created by America Greetings, the same company that brought us _Strawberry Shortcake_ and _Care Bears_
-   _He-Man and the Masters of the Universe_: In the Christmas special, the first sign of Skeletor's reluctant Heel–Face Turn is when he takes along the puppy that the two Earth children he's kidnapped have found.
    
    **Little Girl**: It was nice of you to save Relay, Mr. Skeletor.
    
    **Skeletor**: I am _**not**_ nice! _(puppy licks his face)_ Stop that!
    
    **Little Girl**: You want me to hold him?
    
-   _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls_: While Humanity Ensues for Twilight Sparkle, Spike the baby dragon gets turned into a puppy. Of course, the reaction of the Fluttershy native to the High School AU upon seeing Spike is no different from that of the original Fluttershy when _she_ first saw him.
-   _PAW Patrol_: All the rescue puppies definitely count.
-   _Pip Ahoy!_: The titular Pip is a cute fluffy brown puppy.
-   _Pound Puppies_: While neither the 1980s or the 2010 versions count in themselves, the adopted puppies do. Each presents the puppies as cute and adorable improvements on their in-universe families' lives.
-   _Puppy Dog Pals_: Bingo and Rolly, the titular pals, fit this trope perfectly.
-   _Rosie's Rules_: Everyone considers Benito, Tia Margarita's dog, to be adorable. Well, except Gatita.
-   _Samurai Jack_: Robot assassin X-49 from the episode "The Tale of X-49" adopts a cute pug named Lulu (sweet thing) before retiring from his life of violence.

-   _Sesame Street_: The 2021 animated special exclusive to HBO Max titled _Furry Friends Forever: Elmo Gets a Puppy_ involves Elmo and Grover befriending a female stray puppy named "Tango". Throughout the special, they try taking her to Sesame Street's "Pet Adoption Fair" held at the park. However, Elmo and Grover missed the event which causes Elmo to fully adopt Tango and become his second pet. Tango later debuted on the main show on November 11th, 2021.
-   _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_: In the first episode, Star shows off the powers of her magic wand by summoning a litter of adorable puppies... who randomly fire Eye Beams.
-   _Strawberry Shortcake_: On _Berry Bitty Adventures_, Strawberry has had Pupcake, from the beginning. However, season three gives each of the other six girls a dog. Why? Well, there are two reasons. This is the other one.
    -   More like merchandising failure. None of the puppies apparently made it to toy form. In fact, Hasbro seems to have given up on Strawberry Shortcake and there are rumors that they're already in talks to relinquish their rights to produce the toys to another company. The toy rights were eventually sold to a startup called Bridge Direct.
    -   The 2003 incarnation of _Strawberry Shortcake_ also had Pupcake from the beginning.
-   _Toot & Puddle: I'll Be Home for Christmas_, a dog at the mansion of Toot's grandmother gives birth to a load of adorable puppies. What really makes this weird is that the dog and pups have absolutely no anthropomorphism in a series where pretty much every other animal displays anthropomorphism of some type. It seems they really are just a litter of cute puppies.
-   _Totally Spies!_: In "Arnold the Great", Alex comes across a lost puppy. Sam and Clover instantly swoon over it but remain firm that they should try to find the real owner. Although initially repulsed, Jerry is eventually won over and becomes even more attached to the puppy than the girls.
-   _Woezel & Pip_: This Dutch preschool series stars titular characters who are adorable puppies. Their closest friend is a grey kitten named "Burrpoes", a living tree, and a mole.

    Real Life 

-   Police dogs. Police departments recognized this trope and, instead of training them only to be vicious and apprehend resistive suspects as they did in the past, now train them to do that and roll over for a belly rub at community events and liaisons to help seem less intimidating to children, and to pretty much anyone else.
-   Fire departments used to employ dalmatians to run alongside the firefighters' wagons, keeping the horses that drew the wagons from panicking as well as barking to let civilians know to make way. With the advent of fire trucks, dalmatians now serve primarily as the firefighters' mascots.
-   One of the cover photos for Barack Obama's Facebook page was of him petting his dog at some point.
-   This Cracked article explains it all.
-   A lot of the grammar error examples in the Microsoft Word program tend to be sentences involving dogs. For example, if the user puts a comma before a conjunction, the sentence "The dog went to the park, and learned how to play fetch" is shown as an example of this mistake, and if the user must resolve a disagreement with a noun phrase, the sentence "We already have two sweet puppy" is shown to be the example.
