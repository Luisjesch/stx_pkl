_"When I get taken off a case, right away I figure somebody put the pressure on. Right away I ask myself why."_

If a detective story needs more drama, the writer may decide to spice things up by throwing a spanner in the works. Often this comes in the form of the detective being suspended from work or even laid off for misconduct. Of course, this entails a drastic change in dynamics, so sometimes it may be preferable to simply have the hero be Taken Off the Case instead.

This can happen for various reasons:

-   The detective might have failed to capture the Big Bad one time too many.
-   He went too far and broke too many rules in pursuit of his suspect.
-   There may be a conflict of interest because it's too personal, e.g. the detective got romantically involved with the prime suspect.
-   The case got too big or the suspect was already the subject of a federal investigation and had to be handed to the FBI or by another agency that has a huge stake in it.
-   Higher-ups conspired to remove the agent for getting too close to an inconvenient truth.
-   Da Chief was bought off by or is doing a favor for the local mob by removing the detective from the case.
-   Da Chief forbids the hero from further troubling a suspect with his investigation because he doesn't believe the detective's outlandish theory and is concerned about the suspect's reputation.

Of course, the detective is not amused and most likely continues investigating the case on their own terms although it's gonna be harder to do so now. Being removed from a case could also hint at deeper problems beneath the surface which may cause the opposite effect and make the detective even more intrigued in solving the case.

If an employee is ruled incapable of handling a caseload at all, it progresses to a case of Turn in Your Badge.
