Watch the road, bro.

_"I swear you'll be the first patient in the ER with airbag rash on the back of his head."_

The tendency of characters in TV shows or movies who are driving to spend a dangerously long time looking at the person in the passenger seat, rather than out the windshield (or ever at the rear-view mirror, which is almost always gone).

This trope is nearly ubiquitous, so use this section to list subversions and lampshade hangings. The reason it is so ubiquitous is because almost never is an actor _actually_ driving and acting at the same time. The vehicle is either on a trailer or being towed behind the camera car - or the actors are in a car set in a studio.

Remember that Tropes Are Tools and this one is quite often a deliberate portrayal of bad driving — either establishing that a character Drives Like Crazy, being invoked by the driver to freak out the passengers (like a one-car Game of Chicken), or setting up a Surprise Car Crash as Surprisingly Realistic Outcome with a bang. (Then again, the fact that there are so many things it can signify just makes the trope's unintentional appearances that much more frustrating and anticlimactic...)

In Real Life, taking your focus off the road for even the duration of an extended sneezing fit or to answer a phone call or text or try to control misbehaving children in the backseat is a _major_ cause of serious and fatal (and not-serious as well) accidents, as are other forms of "distracted driving". In fact, distracted driving is even _more_ likely to actually cause an accident than drunk driving below 0.12 with the drunk focused on the road, because to a certain degree of intoxication, a drunk can _actually see_ what is going on around them, if not otherwise distracted, and because distracted driving is far, far more common than drunk driving. If you must do something that will take your full visual focus off the road for more than a few seconds, _**pull over.**_

    Films — Animated 

-   _Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse_: Vanessa Fisk is shown facing her son Richard while driving, as she's trying to comfort him following their walking in on her husband/his father trying to kill Spider-Man.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _The Sugarland Express_, the driver who picks up Lou Jean and Clovis thinks nothing of turning around and having a conversation with them, paying no attention to the road, and driving 25 mph on the open highway.

-   Parodied in _Amélie_: One of the things Amelie does not like are drivers in American films who don't watch the road. Cut to a scene from the American film _Father's Little Dividend_ where the actor drives a desk and looks at his passenger 99% of the time. In the DVD director's commentary, Jean-Pierre Jeunet comments on how difficult it is to find a clip exhibiting this trope when you're specifically looking for one.

-   Lloyd drives a limo in _Dumb and Dumber_ while looking at his passenger (in the back seat) and telling her how dangerous drivers are today.

-   In the 1928 comedy _Speedy_, Harold Lloyd plays a New York City cab driver who picks up none other than Babe Ruth, and is so starstruck that he repeatedly turns around to chat with his hero... while driving through heavy Midtown traffic at a dizzyingly fast speed, much to Ruth's horror.

-   In _The Descent_, in which Sarah's husband holds her gaze for a few seconds too long, drifts into the oncoming lane and crashes into a car coming the other way.

Sure enough, as soon as she closes them, he crashes into another car.
-   In _Mystery Team_, Leroy constantly turns around to yell at the protagonists, and Duncan constantly requests that he focuses on the road. This later turns out to be good advice.

-   In the movie version of _Sleepwalk With Me,_ Mike Birbiglia narrates most of the movie to the camera (which seems to be pointed at him from the passenger side corner of the windshield) while he drives around. He rarely looks at the road.
-   In _First Blood_, Rambo climbs into the passenger seat of a military truck and holds the driver at knifepoint. When the driver stares at him Rambo tells him to look at the road and not at him (and for some reason he feels the need to spell out that not looking at the road causes accidents).

-   In Roald Dahl's autobiography _Boy_, he describes the terrifying childhood car journey that nearly cost him his nose.

The whole time, Karen keeps looking at Kevin, who is bleeding from where Todd punched him.
