I get that parallel parking can be tough, but _perpendicular_?

"_Wow, nice parking job._"

— **Asami Sato** to Korra (after finding her car smashed into a lamppost with a pile of tickets on the windshield), _The Legend of Korra_, "Turning the Tides"

Sometimes, Rockstar Parking is unavailable to a character. Other times, a space is available but they are unable to maneuver their vehicle into it due to poor parking skills or the space being to small, especially if Parallel Parking is involved. Maybe they were about to enter a space, only for some Jerk Jock in a hummer to cut them off and steal the space. In these cases, they'll have to make do with whatever space is available, or park in a less than courteous manner.

Common gags include:

-   Parking next to a fire hydrant (which may need using, causing the firemen to shatter two of the car's windows to lead the hose through)
-   Stealing the Handicapped Spot
-   Parking in a space reserved for a superior
-   Parking in the one available spot that's a long trek away from wherever they wanted to go
-   Parking on the sidewalk or in another place where parking isn't permitted.

Oftentimes, the violation will be treated as a Felony Misdemeanor and the driver will receive a ticket from a Traffic Warden. The car might be towed, or may have a clamp applied to the wheel. Obstructive Bureaucracy may be encountered as the driver attempts to pay their ticket or retrieve their car.

Contrast Improbable Parking Skills. Can lead to Parking Payback.

    Advertising 

-   There's a Mentos commercial where some jerk pulls into an open parking spot right when Our Heroine wants to leave, sandwiching her in. Cue a Mentos, and a Bright Idea: she recruits the help of some beefy construction workers to pick up her car and ease it out.
-   A interstitial short on Cartoon Network had Fred Flintstone, Thundarr, and Chicken car-pooling, while Fred struggles to find a parking space in the over-crowded parking lot at CN Headquarters. After some hijinks (including Space Ghost offering his space before remembering "I flew into work today! Silly me." and trying to beat Speed Racer to a spot), the trio are _still_ looking late at night, and Fred grouses "That does it! I'm gonna start takin' the bus to work."
-   One commercial for Kraft Meltdowns featured a principal losing his temper and screaming over the PA system because somebody parked in his parking space.
-   A "This is SportsCenter" ad from 2006 featured a spot labeled "D. Patrick". A tow truck takes Danica Patrick's race car away, after which then-SportsCenter anchor Dan Patrick (now with NBC Sports) arrives. A confrontation between the two results.

    Comic Books 

-   In one _Archie_ comic, Archie and his friends find that they have been boxed in by an inconsiderate driver and are unable to pull out. Moose arrives and offers to lift the front end of their car up and point it towards the road. Having done so, the gang thanks him... and he gets into the car in front of them and drives off!
    -   In another Archie comic, Moose complains about the parking situation, saying it took an hour to get his compact car out of a certain lot. When told that isn't so bad (seriously?), he says that it ''wasn't'' a compact car when he'd parked it.

    Fan Works 

-   _Guys Being Dudes_: The Team GO Rocket trio end up parking their Creepy Stalker Van at a shopping center next to the park Go Fest takes place at because it's rather large and Sierra refuses to park next to anyone.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Snatch._, Tyrone claims a parking spot is too tight when there's only one other vehicle on the whole block. Naturally, when the others convince him to park there, he crashes into that vehicle, leading to one of the funniest exchanges in the movie:
    
    **Tyrone:** I didn't see it there.
    
    **Vinny:** It's a four-ton truck, Tyrone. It's not as if it's a packet of fucking peanuts, is it?
    
    **Tyrone:** It was a funny angle.
    
    **Vinny:** It's behind you Tyrone. Whenever you reverse, things come from behind you.
    
-   At the beginning of _GoodFellas_, Henry cites being able to double park in front of fire hydrants as one of the cool things about being a gangster.
-   In _Delivery Man_, David Wozniak, a delivery person for his family's butcher shop, has his delivery truck repeatedly ticketed for parking improperly. He uses the truck to pick up the shop's basketball team uniforms to wear during a team photo, which his family doubts he can retrieve and deliver in time for the photo due to his unreliability. David manages to retrieve the jerseys, but the truck is towed with the jerseys inside.
-   _Office Space_ gives a twofer: As part of his interrupted-hypnosis new view on life, Peter nonchalantly parks in the space reserved for his human headache of a boss, Bill Lumbergh. This spawns another Parking Problem gag: Lumbergh arrives later and parks instead in a handicap space, which results in his car getting seriously damaged, then towed.
-   When Mahoney is introduced in the first _Police Academy_, he's working as a parking attendant. An obnoxious customer insists that he find a parking space even though Mahoney points out there are no more spaces. His boss sides with the customer, so he does it anyway... by tilting the car onto its side wheels and parking between two other cars. (Yes, it does look something like the page image.)
-   _The Last Jedi_: Finn and Rose get arrested on Canto Bight for illegally parking their shuttlecraft on the beach, ruining their chance to meet up with the underworld figure they came to meet.
-   In _Ferris Bueller's Day Off_, Rooney parks his car in front of a fire hydrant in front of the Bueller house. His car then gets towed.
-   _Doctor in Distress (1963)_: When Sir Lancelot parks in his reserved space at Hampden Cross Hospital, the two adjacent cars are too close, and he is unable to open his doors. When he tries to reverse out, an ambulance parks behind him and forces him to wait until it is ready to move.
-   In _On the Buses_, Stan parks his bus too close to Vera's in the depot to trap her in the cab:
    
    **Vera**: You _stupid_ nit! I can't get out!
    
    **Stan**: Can'tcha? Try driving the bus sideways.
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Our Miss Brooks_: While Miss Brooks has trouble parking off and on through the series, "Trial by Jury" features a truly Epic Fail.

-   The Doctor from _Doctor Who_ is not exactly an expert when it comes to flying the TARDIS.

    -   In "Fear Her", Ten parks the TARDIS with the door facing a dumpster. He has to take a moment to rotate the TARDIS so that the door actually can open. And technically, he didn't disobey the "No parking in front of gate" sign, because he parked _in_ the gate.

-   _Harrow_: In "Non Sum Qualis Eram" ("I'm not what I used to be"), Harrow "borrows" Fairley's car without asking. When he returns it, he leaves it in a No Standing zone, so when Fairley comes out to find his car, he is immediately handed a parking ticket.
-   _The Defenders (2017)_: Jessica Jones is introduced rescuing Trish Walker's car from getting towed after Trish incidentally parks illegally in a loading zone. Trish tries to protest to the parking enforcement officer that she can move it, but he isn't swayed.

    **Cop:** What?!
    
-   A Running Gag in _Better Call Saul_ is the protagonist clashing with the parking attendant at the courthouse due to failing to collect the required number of parking validation stickers to have his parking fee waived.

    -   In the episode 'Hit and Run', Kim and Jimmy want to damage Howard's reputation by stealing his car, which Jimmy would drive while impersonating Howard, then pushing an unsatisfied prostitute out of his car, all the while Howard's friend/fellow lawyer is witness. In order to do this, they steal Howard's car during his therapist appointment. To prevent someone from parking there before he gets back, Jimmy places a traffic cone in Howard's parking space. When the act is done, Jimmy returns with Howard's car - to see the cone misplaced, and a car taking up the parking space. In his annoyance, Jimmy parks Howard's car in a non-parking spot, then moves the sign "Guests Only" to in front of the car, _just_ in time before Howard's return.
-   When cop-in-training John Nolan makes a traffic stop with his watch commander riding shotgun in _The Rookie_, he fails to park his patrol car far enough from the suspect's vehicle as mandated by department regulations.

-   _Reservation Dogs_: During her driver's test, Elora is told to parallel park in a space too small for her car.

    It was so very quiet and peaceful
    
    There was nobody, not a soul around
