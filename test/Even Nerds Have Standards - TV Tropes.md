_"OK, now you've crossed over into the realm of **supernerds**, whereby even **regular** nerds steal your lunch money and throw rocks at you."_

This is the notion that nerds' interests can be tiered, and that what's on the lower tiers can make other nerds glad they aren't that nerdy.

Sometimes expressed in the form of "You're the kind of nerd that other nerds would beat up and steal your lunch money". Often when Nerds Love Tough Schoolwork, the regular nerds will mock those nerds. This can also stem from the idea that Nerds Are Virgins doesn't apply to moderate or light nerds. The more nerdy you are, the more You Need to Get Laid.

In Real Life, this can lead to Broken Bases accusing the other side of being more nerdy, but we don't need to note that here. Besides, articulation of such arguments tends to be nerdier than either side.

Wakamatsu is another of Nozaki's assistants, who's well known around the school as a basketball player. When they both find out that the other draws manga, Mikoshiba admits he was hiding it because he sees it as an Embarrassing Hobby. Wakamatsu tries to be supportive by admitting his own interest in manga and saying if Mikoshiba is an otaku, then so is he, but Mikoshiba yells at him for daring to call himself an otaku at that level.

    Literature 

-   When Douglas Adams revealed that the question which produced the Ultimate Answer (42) was What do you get if you multiply six by nine?, somebody pointed out that the math actually did add up... if you use base 13. Adams responded, "I may be a sad individual, but I don't make jokes in base 13."
-   Stanley Howler from the Discworld book _Going Postal_ is so obsessed with his pin collection, even the other pin collectors in Ankh-Morpork think he's "a bit weird about pins".

    Live-Action TV 

-   Comedian Jackie Kashian had a bit about this, concerning Civil War re-enactors.
    
    "Do you know how far into the Dork Forest you have to go before you find the Civil War re-enactors? You have to go past the Star Wars fans, the Star Trek fans, the people who collect Beanie Babies. You have to go past _Harry Potter himself_."
    
-   Arnold Rimmer from _Red Dwarf_ is practically a nerd except for the fact that he's in his mid-20s/early 30s, but is the first member of the team to throw out insults comparing his crew members negatively to various nerds. Even getting his negativity drained by an Emohawk and turning him into Ace Rimmer doesn't stop him from proclaiming Dwayne Dibbley (Cat with all his "Coolness" drained out of him) to be "so geeky he couldn't even get into a science fiction convention".
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: When Buffy fails to get on the cheerleading squad early in Season 1, her mother suggests that she join the yearbook staff. Buffy responds, "Have you _seen_ the people that work on the yearbook? _Nerds_ pick on them."

    **Malcolm:** No, Dabney, the _mama's boys_ are getting together and laughing at you. With their mothers!
    
-   From _Two of a Kind_:
    
    **Mary Kate:** Dad, you know those kids who blow their nose and then spend just a little too much time looking at it in the tissue?
    
    **Kevin:** Yeah...
    
    **Mary Kate:** Well, even THEY won't talk to Ethan!
    
-   _The Big Bang Theory_:
    -   When Sheldon and his arch-nemesis Barry Kripke, have to settle a dispute, they go with a basketball match, since sports are the one thing that neither of them have an overwhelming advantage in.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  They are so terrible at it that the guys cannot help but find them pathetic, enough to where they briefly empathize with their schoolboy tormentors.
        
        **Leonard:** You know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?
        
        **Raj:** Yeah?
        
        (Raj nods in agreement)
        
    -   In "The Fetal Kick Catalyst", Leonard is interested in going with Penny to the Van Nuys Comic Con, even though he just called it sad.
        
        **Leonard**: But it's not pathetic; that's where I draw the line.
        
-   _The Flash (2014)_: Cisco Ramon, the Gadgeteer Genius, had no friends in high school as he was apparently such a nerd that 'even the nerds hated \[him\]'. It's no wonder that he was so happy to get a job working for Harrison Wells at STAR Labs, since he was finally in an environment where nerdiness and genius was celebrated.
-   _QI_: In the "Invertebrates" episode, this was the reaction to the panelists learning about the Worm-Charming Festival (which failed to charm any worms):
    
    **Alan Davies**: At least when you go trainspotting there are trains!
    
    **Johnny Vegas**: That's the best thing - The trainspotters are sitting on a hill going "Losers! Get a life!"
    
-   _Party Down_: Roman, an anti-social science fiction nerd, earns the attention of a beautiful woman at a party who is also into science fiction. When he probes her interests, she says she likes dragons, and Roman immediately ditches her because she's actually a fan of _fantasy_, not sci-fi.
-   In one _Saturday Night Live_ skit involving the Spartan Cheerleaders, the eponymous cheerleaders decide to pep up a chess match with their routine. One member of the chess club takes umbrage at this:

-   In the _Frasier_ episode "Frasier's Reunion", Frasier complains that every five years, his high school reunion coincides with his life being a mess, and he ends up sitting with "the most pathetic people there".

    **Frasier**: Worse. The chess club's barbershop quartet!
    
    **Niles**: Oh, the Checkmates.
    
-   _Still Standing_: The episode "Still Flunking" deals with Brian trying to learn to climb a military wall in order to pass gym class, and failing miserably.

    Music 

-   In the "Weird Al" Yankovic song "Genius in France": "And I forgot to mention/I'm not even welcome at the Star Trek Convention."

    Newspaper Comics 

-   _FoxTrot_:
    -   During the summer camp arc, Eugene Wu was the first nerd that Jason and Marcus couldn't stand. This was less because of his interests and more because of his Insufferable Genius behavior.
    -   Jason once tried to pull this on Eileen when she was cosplaying for a _Harry Potter_ film, but that was just Hypocritical Humor since he thought his cosplaying for a _The Lord of the Rings_ film made him cooler. They apparently compromised on the issue since later strips would show them attending movies in cosplay together.

    Radio 

-   In the _John Finnemore's Double Acts_ episode "Here's What We Do", the somewhat pretentious 18 year old Pidge is horrified to discover that while he was at Uni, his friend Gavin has got into _Dungeons & Dragons_. Less because he's got anything against the game itself ("Of course it's _fun_!") as because it cements their nerd status. (Later, when admitting that everything he previously told Gavin about what they're doing is a lie, he confesses to being in the university's _Settlers of Catan_ team, and _not_ the squash team).
    
    **Pidge**: People like us cannot do _Dungeons & Dragons_. If we're going to remain in that crucial third quartile of popularity — not popular, but not bullied — we've _got_ to keep people like the D&D lot below us.
    
-   Zig-zag: a radio sports talk show described fantasy football as Dungeons and Dragons for guys who used to beat up guys who played Dungeons and Dragons.

    Video Games 

-   _Backyard Sports_' Dmitri, a nerd who loves statistics, thinks Reese, who is a nerd who plays _way too many_ video games and collects _way too many_ stamps and action figures, is _way too nerdy_.
-   The Nerd Clique in _Bully_ won't let Petey into their group, claiming that he is too weird.
-   In _Destiny 2_, Ikora Rey is the Warlock Vanguard and, as you'd expect, is far from uneducated, but even she gets exasperated by Asher Mir's overuse of Technobabble, and tells him to get a translator. In a later mission, she also rifles through Asher's theoretical notes and laments how she prefers _applied_ research.

    Webcomics 

-   _DM of the Rings_ had a roleplaying specific version in strip #10.
    
    Even more reviled than a typical roleplayer is a roleplayer who insists on _roleplaying_. When the dorks need to feel superior, _this_ is the guy they denounce as a dork. Honestly. The only person worse than him is the DM himself.
    
-   In one _Ctrl+Alt+Del_ strip, Ethan says that Lucas had "crossed over into the realm of supernerds, whereby even regular nerds steal your lunch money and throw rocks at you" over his excitement on having discovered the _A Song of Ice and Fire_ CCG.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   The hierarchy is referenced in this page of _Weregeek_. Despite this one instance, though, the comic in general averts this, showing all forms of Geek as people out to have harmless fun (who also may or may not be monsters of some kind).
-   _Dork Tower_ has a running joke about furries being the absolute bottom rung of the gaming community.
    -   And then there's...
        
        **Ken**: The geeks beat you up in school when the jocks were finished with you, didn't they...  
        **Matt**: The math club developed a special 'take a number' system just for me!
        
    -   In one strip, Matt imagines strangling and screaming at an overexcited roleplayer who can't stop telling strangers everything about his character, because it makes normal people think all roleplayers are freaks like him.
-   A variation in _Mac Hall_ here. It claims when nerds arrive at a con, each one finds someone even worse than themselves in order to feel better about themselves. 
-   In _Furthia High_, Bruce calls Kale and Campy nerds for chatting online and reciting poetry, respectively, while talking about how his LARPing is much cooler than what they'll be doing. This is intended as Hypocritical Humor.
    -   Another time Bruce made fun of a couple guys playing a TCG in the cafeteria, while wearing his LARP costume.
-   _Penny Arcade_: Gabe, one of the original Two Gamers on a Couch, is not happy about his son LARPing.
-   In _Pixie Trix Comix,_ both Jung and Ramona, who are pretty hardcore geeks if not overly nerdy, are entirely willing to pick on Aaron, whose geeky and _annoying_ behavior does take him into Asshole Victim territory.

    Web Original 

-   In _Berserk Abridged_, Guts, who is a Zack Cosplayer, thinks LARPing is too nerdy for him.

-   The Nostalgia Chick, who portrays herself as an obsessively geeky shut-in, delights in mocking squealing fangirls and people who write bad fanfiction. She also works a few obligatory swipes at LARPers into her _Labyrinth_ review. That said, the Chick (as opposed to Lindsay Ellis) is a Closet Geek in denial about her own nerdiness.
-   _Zero Punctuation_:
    -   Yahtzee describes _EVE Online_ players as "the nerds who are to nerds what nerds are to normal people", with an appropriate series of illustrations.
    -   Another time he mentioned he wasn't as into a franchise as others and said, "This is where the big nerds get to pick on me" with an illustration of a hulking figure with big coke-bottle glasses and nerdy incisors picking him up.
    -   He also accused _Sunset Overdrive_ of trying _way_ too hard to be like this, setting out to be a game that's deliberately silly and weird and wacky while also mocking the "nerds" who would, despite its protestations, probably make up most of its target audience.
        
        **Yahtzee:** As is the sandbox way, _Sunset Overdrive_ introduces a number of NPC factions who give us our missions, and all of them seem to be nerds: engineering students and LARPers and the like. It's another thing that comes across as desperate. "Look at the nerds! We're not nerds, we're cool! Video games are cool and not nerdy!" I didn't say they were ner- "Good, 'cos they're not! Let's all laugh at the nerds and their funny nerdy ways! Fa ha ha ha ha ha!" Except let's _not_ laugh, _Sunset Overdrive._
        
-   The "Geek Hierarchy"<small>◊</small> chart by Lore Sjöberg, originally published at the Brunching Shuttlecocks humor site, analyses the trope.
-   _commodoreHUSTLE_ includes this delightful exchange:
    
    **Graham**: They're LARPers. It's like what Jer does with the dice and the bits of paper, except that the people Jer hangs out with look down on these guys.
    
-   The Cracked series _After Hours_ is entirely about four geeks who sit around a diner discussing pop culture as Serious Business. Nevertheless one of them, Daniel O'Brien, is even geekier than the others and tends to get a lot of looks of mixed confusion/scorn/pity when he says something particularly nerdy. It's Self-Deprecation, of course, Dan is the show's writer.
-   _Potter Puppet Pals_ puts it pretty bluntly.
    
    **Ron**: Even I look down on you, Neville. _Me_.
    
-   The Angry Video Game Nerd thinks this way of sports nerds, as revealed in the Atari Sports episode. Even more so towards the title character of _Lester the Unlikely_.
-   In _Doppelgänger_, nerds form an entire clique. Even they consider Victor too nerdy to join them.
    
    _The nerds won't even tolerate me!_
    
    _Ironic, yes, but still it really hurts._
    
-   Seanbaby once posted an old _Nintendo Power_ letter on his website, in which a group of college students discussed how they spent Spring Break playing Gameboy... and the editor's response was "You know, Gameboys also work _outside_." Seanbaby couldn't let the chance pass:
    
    "When a guy whose hobbies include 'play-by-post games' looks up from his Dungeonmaster's Guide and tells you you're a geek, you know you're finished. You might as well knock your own lunch tray out of your hands and save us all the time."
    
-   Inverted in the _Teen Girl Squad_ episode "4 Gregs": When Dn'D Greg reveals he actually knows the rules to American Football, the other Gregs deride him for being too mainstream.

    Western Animation 

-   _The Simpsons_ visit a Brand X version of Ikea:
    
    **Lisa:** _(picks up a pencil holder)_ Ooh, I want to get the krünk.  
    **Marge:** Mmmm, you don't want something that overshadows the pencils. _(Holds up another pencil caddy)_ How about this pöpli?  
    **Lisa:** Mom, no! Everyone at school picks on the pöpli kids - even I do. _(Under her breath)_ I just hate them so much.
    
    -   And when Bart accidentally revealed that he has a _stamp collection_ in "Homer the Vigilante", even Lisa laughed at him.
        
        **Nelson:** Stamp collection? Ha ha!
        
    -   Lisa also laughed at Bart in "Boy-Scoutz 'n The Hood" when he accidentally joined the Junior Campers during a Squishee bender.
        
        **Lisa:** The few. The proud. The geeky.
        
    -   In the episode "Grade School Confidential," Martin's birthday party comes to an end when the oysters his parents served, instead of cake, gave the other kids food poisoning, except for Bart who gave his to Martin's cat, and Lisa who faked getting food poisoning in order to escape the overtly educational theme of the party.
    -   In "The Last Temptation of Homer," Bart simultaneously undergoes several medical treatments (orthopedic shoes, glasses to correct lazy eye, salve for a dry scalp) that combine to make him look like a stereotypical nerd. When he turns up at school and is duly shamed by the mob, even Martin Prince gets in his two cents.
        
        **Martin Prince:** Your appearance is comical to me!
        
-   On _Phineas and Ferb,_ even Baljeet considers Irving to be a nerd.

-   At the end of the _Danny Phantom_ episode "Lucky in Love", the nerd calls Danny, Tucker, and Sam "losers".
    -   In the early seasons, Tucker himself hates being called a "nerd" and "Techno-Geek". In one episode, he has gotten sick of it, but by the end, he started to like being a "Techno-Geek".
-   In the _Rocko's Modern Life_ episode "Canned", Rocko passes two comic book geeks, one of which is gushing about how he thinks the "elf wenches" in his favorite fantasy comic are way hotter than real women. The other geek responds "Wow... you're an _idiot._"

    -   Cody inverts this— according to his online bio, the reason he thinks of himself as cool is because he hangs out with a bunch of friends even geekier than he is.
    -   Zig Zagged with Beth. Throughout the first two seasons she often seemed annoyed/disturbed by some of Harold's antics. At the end of the second season however she develops a crush on him, and Harold seemed to develop this attitude in regards to her.
    -   Noah also clearly finds Harold annoying whenever the two interact.
    -   _The Ridonculous Race_ puts Owen in a position to meet Leonard. Owen may be jolly and friendly to everyone he meets, but seeing Leonard claim his robe has "cloaking powers" and say he's now invisible causes him to give up rather quickly.
-   In _The Looney Tunes Show_, there's a flashback to everyone's high school days, and we find out that even Pete Puma and Marvin Martian, established losers in this particular continuity, refused to sit with Daffy.
-   This is a common theme in _Codename: Kids Next Door_ where nerds have superhuman powers that set them apart from other kids (like turning into zombies if you steal from them).

-   In _The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy_ episode "Wishbones", when Billy's dad Harold finds the wishing skull he wishes he could live his high school years again because he believed he was one of the popular kids, he approaches the jocks and the cheerleaders who beat him up, he then tries the bullies with the same result, then he attempts to befriend some nerds but even they beat him up and stuff him into the garbage can just like everyone else.
