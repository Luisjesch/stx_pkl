_"I'm not one or the other. Not really a demon, not really human. I'm not either! That's all. There was no place for me, so I had to make one for myself. And then I realized, I had a place. But I was the only one in it. I didn't know any other way to live."_

Being a Half-Human Hybrid is tough. Aside from likely being one of a kind, they also have to deal with Half-Breed Discrimination, struggling balance both sides of their lineage, and generally feeling out of place wherever they go. Naturally, angst will ensue, complete with all sorts of identity issues.

May overlap with Half-Breed Discrimination, which is about how _other_ people treat them. See also Freakiness Shame.
