"_Playing card games is just like making love. You usually do it on a table, and you always feel deep shame when it's finished. Also, the older you get, the less fun it is. So remember, always wear a condom when playing card games._"

Describing a topic is very much like the physical act of love...

A character compares an activity, no matter how unrelated or mundane, to sex. They're likely to go into great detail (often giving a description that has no resemblance to sex whatsoever, or is only about sex and not the other activity). If a character does this _all the time_, it can overlap with Talks Like a Simile. Looks like Freud really WAS right.

Compare: Better than Sex.

Then you start doing it regularly, and it becomes a part of your everyday life... I mean, you look forward to it, and it's good, but it's not the same as when you first started. Then you find you are doing it less and less until one day it's really good because you did something different. Then for a few years you look for the different thing.
