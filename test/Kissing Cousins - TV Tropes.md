"_If you're tired of beating around the bush, why not shake the family tree? A hot cousin might fall out._"

Romantic/sexual relationships between cousins (meaning, generally, _first_ cousins — as in, two people who share a grandparent) are a phenomenon that has been more accepted in some cultures and eras than others. A great many cultures today accept it, including a majority of the industrialized world.

Marrying one's extended relatives (which is technically known as _clan endogamy_) seems to have been common in human evolutionary history, since hominids usually lived in small nomadic bands with few available sexual partners. At the other end of the spectrum, much of the modern U.S.A. considers cousin marriage completely taboo, so much so that Hilarity Ensues at the very mention of it. People from backwoods areas (especially the Appalachian Mountains) are often the preferred butt of many bad jokes as well as occasional bits of Self-Deprecation for the alleged prevalence of Kissing Cousins in their culture.

Despite the taboo, cousin marriages are legal in about half the states in the U.S.A., though not as much in the backwoods areas and more in the modern industrialized states: the opposite of what one might expect from hearing all those jokes.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Legal or not, these marriages are still not very common due to the lingering cultural taboo. All U.S. states permit marriages between second<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and third cousins, but even these are looked at funny. In the UK, first cousin marriage is uncommon and would be regarded as rather odd, but it doesn't carry as much stigma as in the U.S., while second cousin marriages and beyond would be seen as unremarkable. In several other western countries, especially the ones that are majority Catholic, first cousins marriages were common and usually not considered a taboo; although it's starting to become more looked-down-upon in the modern age due to globalization and the importation of U.S. culture, as well as greater awareness of the risk of genetic problems, such marriages are still quite common in rural areas. First cousin marriage is also considered acceptable in Japan, South India (states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka) and the Middle East.

Definitions of exactly what degree of cousin was considered incest actually changed over the centuries. The Romans and early medieval Europe considered first and second cousin marriage to be incest, but third cousin marriage was permissible. After the Germanic migrations Europe had to juggle a couple of different definitions of incest (which were often used as a convenient way to annul political marriages in a time and place where divorce was nigh impossible), until 1215 when a church council officially redefined that anything up to third cousin marriage would be considered incest, but not fourth degree or more. Nonetheless the definition continued to fluctuate over time, until by the 20th century even first cousin marriage wasn't considered incest in much of Europe.

Expect some _strong_ Values Dissonance between the media from the US and other countries, and between certain modern works and works from the nineteenth century and earlier, when the taboo was sometimes non-existent or even inverted. Scholars still vigorously debate the question of why some cultures forbid cousin marriage while others permit or encourage it, but that's beyond the scope of this wiki.

According to both Oxford and Merriam-Webster's Dictionaries, the original definition of _kissing cousins_ was simply a relative known well enough to be given a kiss in greeting, although this meaning has long since fallen by the wayside.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You_, Rentarou's twelfth girlfriend is his junior high schooler cousin Chiyo. Initally he's grossed out (due to both her age and the fact that they're related), but he accepts her after her heartfelt confession.
-   _Angel Densetsu_ subverts this in a Flashback arc that details how Kitano's parents met. Midori is involved with her cousin and childhood friend, Chuji, who has a one-sided rivalry/obsession with Ryuichiro and is most definitely Ax-Crazy. She insists that Chuji isn't evil, and asks Ryuichiro to defeat him in order to open his eyes. That really won't work, since he _is_ evil now, and even considers Midori as just another easy girl. After he tells Ryuichiro this, Ryuichiro angrily lays him out in _one attack_, after being repeatedly struck with bronze knuckles and shrugging them off. Midori overhears and realizes the truth, culminating in the more heartwarming relationship between her and Ryuchiro.
-   _Berserk_: Count Julius tells his son Adonis that when he grows up, he may be expected to marry his cousin Princess Charlotte and become the next King of Midland.
-   In _Black Butler_, Ciel is engaged to his cousin, Elizabeth. They get along quite well; in fact, Elizabeth is one of the few people that Ciel openly cares about.
-   In _Blade of the Immortal_, Kagehisa Anotsu's true love is the swordswoman Makie Otonotachibana. Her grandmother was the younger sister of Anotsu's grandfather, which makes them second cousins.
-   _Bleach_: Pure-blood Quincies are expected to accept endogamous Arranged Marriages to prevent contamination of bloodlines even if it means marrying cousins. The Ishida matriarch engaged her son Ryuuken to his cousin when they were both teenagers. Ryuuken and Masaki cared about each other as family but were reluctant to marry because they knew they were romantically ill-matched. Not only was Ryuuken not Masaki's type, but he was also more attached to Kanae than he was allowed to be.
-   _Cardcaptor Sakura_:
    -   Syaoran's anime-exclusive cousin Meiling has a big crush on him and insists they're engaged because of a Childhood Marriage Promise.
    -   Tomoyo has a crush on Sakura who is revealed to be her second cousin. In a case of Generation Xerox, Tomoyo's mother also had a crush on Sakura's mother and they were first cousins.
    -   When Nelvana Macekred the anime into _Cardcaptors_, they made two of Sakura's classmates who were clearly fond of each other, with a snarky, cute relationship, into cousins. Whereas they removed the fact that Meiling and Syaoran were cousins by changing Meiling's surname to Rae.
-   _Case Closed_:
    -   In one of the earlier cases, the killer's motive for killing his grandfather, etc. was because he fell in love with his cousin, and the older man forbids them from marrying. The killer's parents were also cousins, and the patriarch reluctantly agreed to their marriage.
    -   The series had already hinted that Mary Sera may or may not be Elena Miyano's sister, but Word of God stated during an interview in Singapore that Shuuichi Akai and Akemi Miyano were indeed cousins. Whether they were aware of that fact isn't clear, but they were dating before the latter died.
-   In _Ceres, Celestial Legend_, Kagami claims that there's been a lot of this in the Mikage family line, although it's worth mentioning the context seriously calls his credibility into question: he's trying to provoke Ceres into emerging from his cousin Aya by coming on to her, taunting her with this claim, and attempting (or at least pretending to attempt) to rape her.
-   Hanamori Pink did a short story called _Cherry ♥ Blossom_ where the main couple are cousins. In fact, it's _because_ they're cousins that they're able to save (the love lives of) their entire school by calling on the powers of their ancestors. It was published with other short manga in Japan, but the only official English translation is as an extra in the last volume of _Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch_.
-   It's been mentioned in a _Code Geass_ Sound Episode that Suzaku Kururugi was engaged to his cousin Kaguya Sumeragi when they were children. Kaguya later decides that she is married to Zero, Suzaku's mortal enemy. What makes it particularly funny is that Suzaku eventually _becomes_ Zero, though it's not known if Kaguya knows _that_.
-   _A Cruel God Reigns_: William has a fling with his second cousin, and it is implied that Lilia may have cheated on Greg with her second cousin.
-   In _Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba_, Tengen Uzui the powerful elite ninja and one of the Hashira, is married to three beautiful kunoichi — Hinatsuru, Makio and Suma — later on a databook reveals Makio is actually a relative of Tengen’s, his cousin.
-   _Elfen Lied_ has Yuuka and Kouta, complicated by a Love Triangle with a girl who alternates between homicidal and amnesiac. In the manga, they end up together.
-   In the manga of _The Familiar of Zero_, the Prince of Albion, Wales, and the Princess of Tristian Henrietta are cousins who are in a secret affair (Long distance). Their love is cut short when Wales is killed.
-   Masahiko and Shion from _Family Compo_ are cousins and there's often a sense of attraction between the two. The manga starts with Masahiko saying Shion is cute before he learns she's his cousin. Oddly the series keeps on swaying between Masahiko being Sora's and Yukari's parent figures, and likewise whether Shion and Masahiko are Like Brother and Sister or are attracted to one another.
-   Downplayed in _Fruits Basket_; while the cursed members of the Sohma family occasionally refer to each other as "cousins" or "relatives" and some of them have romantic feelings for each other, it's often implied that they're only very distantly related or not related at all (none of their parents are mentioned as being related). The Sohmas are a clan of 150 members, not simply a large family. The current generation of cursed Sohmas likely only call each other "cousins" out of formality and kinship.
-   By a similar token, much the same happens in the manga _Gakuen Heaven_... except there, the cousin isn't the love interest and doesn't factor into the series' Betty and Veronica equation at all.
-   Makoto and Erio from _Ground Control to Psychoelectric Girl_ have plenty of Ship Tease. It helps that Makoto didn't even know Erio existed until he was sixteen. Makoto also shows attraction to his aunt.
-   In _Hanasakeru Seishounen_ Rumaty and Kajika are unknowingly this. They do not actually get together in the end, but before Kajika and Lee Leng's Relationship Upgrade, the two are the closest out of all of Kajika's Love Interests. Bonus points for being each other's first kisses.
-   The protagonist and his second-cousin in _Hanayashiki no Juunintachi_.
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_: Austria is the cousin of Germany and Prussia, and he gets a _lot_ of Homoerotic Subtext with them, though the Official Couple is Austria/Hungary. He allows Germany to practice sexual activities with him, to prepare Germany for Italy.
-   Downplayed in _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_. In the final arc, Kaguya is betrothed to her cousin Mikado as a backup plan to protect her from her family in the event that Shirogane is unable to do so, though they're very distantly related (second cousins twice removed, or eight degrees of separation).
-   Ayano and Kazuma from _Kaze no Stigma_ are _second_ cousins, with Ayano's father trying to pair them up.
-   _Koi to Utatane_'s plot is pretty much this. The protagonist is a high school guy named Kiichi, who has been in love for a long time with his older female cousin, Hana, who is also a teacher in his school. Due to work circumstances, Kiichi's parents have to move to Hokkaido, while he stays in Tokyo. His parents asked Hana to live with Kiichi while they're gone. Unsurprisingly, living with Hana only strengthens Kiichi's feeling for her. At first, Hana seems too oblivious to this and only look at Kiichi as a younger brother but eventually, Hana also starts developing feelings for him. In the end, Kiichi accidentally revealed his feeling to Hana. While at first shocked at this, Hana eventually returns his feelings. In the epilogue, they are married.
-   Crown Prince Kouen gets some Ship Tease with his first cousin Princess Hakuei in _Magi: Labyrinth of Magic_. Their respective younger siblings seem to be well aware that there's something going on between the two. Although it's not considered unusual, since their culture is based on Ancient China.
-   Shiratori Ryushi and Aoba Kozue, the Official Couple in the romantic-comedy _Mahoraba_, are second cousins.
-   In _My-Otome 0~S.ifr~_, it is revealed that Sifr is the daughter of the King of Windbloom's brother, and it is strongly implied that she eventually marries the King's son, Bruce.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   _Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth_:
        
        -   Neji is implied to have more than just familial affection for Hinata, because there is a scene where he imagines the story of _Romeo and Juliet_, in which he casts himself as Romeo and Hinata as Juliet. In his fantasy, they're called _Nejio and Hinaette_ and look at one another with sparkles in their eyes, before they run towards each other and embrace lovingly. In the same series, he gets so angry when he hears about Hinata trying to date Naruto, that he attacks Hinata in fury, and it's not just the big brother instinct anymore, but plain jealousy. Bear in mind that their fathers were identical twins, meaning that Neji and Hinata share 25% of their genes (meaning they are genetic half-siblings), as opposed to the 12.5% that would normally be the case for first cousins.
        
        **Neji:** Never... you and Naruto... doing things like that… it's... _an infamy_!
        
        -   There is also chapter 20, where Neji gets a severe nosebleed when he hears about Hinata's breasts getting even bigger than they already were.
        -   Lee's comments about how freakishly similar all the Hyugas look to each other, even by family standards, might also be hinting at just how close the Hyugas are.
        -   Neji also acts like a pervert towards the female characters in the alternate universe _Naruto the Movie: Road to Ninja_, including Hinata. He acts like this _especially_ towards _Hinata_.
        -   In Canon, Neji remarked to his father that Hinata was cute when they first met as children.
    -   Karin showed some interest in Naruto at one point. Consider the fact that they're _both_ from the Uzumaki clan. Her attraction to Sasuke is also this to a lesser degree, since the Uzumaki and Uchiha are genetically related, however distantly.
    -   The First Hokage, Hashirama Senju might do this when he married Mito Uzumaki, as the Uzumaki are an offshoot of the Senju. Such practice is not unusual; the two clans tend to trade marriage partners to maintain their ancestral connection. On top of that, the arrangement allowed Hashirama to keep an eye on Kurama, who was sealed within Mito. However, their exact relatedness is not stated.
    -   Then, of course, the final arc reveals that the Hyuga are related to the Senju, Uzumaki, and Uchiha. Naruto ends up marrying Hinata. Though since their (known) most recent common ancestor lived hundreds of years ago, it doesn't pose much of a problem.
-   In _Nerima Daikon Brothers_, Hideki has a crush on his cousin Mako, who in turn is attracted to her cousin (and Hideki's brother) Ichiro.
-   Mori and Honey from _Ouran High School Host Club_ are first cousins, and quite close. It's probably just a case of True Companions, but Mori's bodyguard/protector-like relationship to Honey sure pleases the Yaoi Fangirls both In-Universe and out. Renge tries to encourage them to play it up a few times.
-   Which one of the girls in _Please Twins!_ is related to Maiku? In the manga, _both_ of them. The one who isn't his sister turns out to be his cousin. They still get together, and if being cousins is an issue, they never say so.
-   _Rosario + Vampire_: Tsukune Aono's cousin Kyouko becomes attracted to him when she sees how tough he has become.
-   Amusingly when _Sailor Moon S_ was Macekred in The '90s English dub, Cloverway turned Haruka and Michiru into cousins to try and eliminate the lesbian content. But they didn't remove the subtext successfully, rendering them lesbian kissing cousins.
-   In _Sakura Diaries_, the main character Touma's younger cousin, Urara, is constantly trying to sleep with him and keep him away from other women.
-   In the Yuri Genre series _Sakura Trick_, the Beta Couple Kotone and Shizuku are cousins and have The Big Damn Kiss and one point.
-   _Sand Chronicles_'s Fuji at one point dates his cousin Mariko, who takes care of him after moving to Tokyo. They eventually marry, but it takes a long time to gain his parents' approval.
-   In _Shadow Star_, Shouko Fukuyama has these feelings for her cousin Kyouji. Hell, she has it _bad_ for him; she's about 13 years old and wants to bear his children. She has an It's All Junk hissy fit after being told off by his old crush Jyun. Eventually, Kyouji, who had been comatose for years, dies, and Shouko is all alone… until she sees him after he turned into a... "Virgin Princess" and vows to keep on loving him.
-   In a filler episode of _Shugo Chara!_, Amu admits that her cousin Shuu was her first real crush.
-   In _Super Dimension Fortress Macross_/_Robotech_, Minmay and her cousin (no blood relation) Kaifun.
-   Fumi from _Sweet Blue Flowers_ has an unrequited crush on her cousin Chizu. She notes that, even if Chizu wasn't engaged, it wouldn't work out between them because they're cousins and because Chizu is a girl. It's worth mentioning too that Fumi and Chizu actually had a sexual relationship, with Chizu's engagement to a man signalling their break-up. It's later implied by Chizu to have not been so unrequited after all, as she cries to Fumi about how "We're girls... and cousins... so I can't be _that_ kind of girl."
-   In _Ten Yori Mo, Hoshi Yori Mo_, Tadaomi's father and Mio's dead mother were siblings, so a Tadaomi/Mio match-up would be this. Tadaomi wants it _badly_ to happen, but Mio does not.
-   Katsuhito's first wife in the backstory of _Tenchi Muyo!_ was his first cousin.
-   In _This Ugly Yet Beautiful World_, Takeru Takemoto's cousin, Mari Nishino, is in love with him.
-   In _Tokyo Ghoul :Re_, Kanae von Rosewald is obsessively in love with his cousin, Shuu Tsukiyama. While their family has a long history of Royal Inbreeding, Shuu seems oblivious to Kanae's feelings. This leads to Kanae becoming a Crazy Jealous Guy, repeatedly attempting to murder Kaneki out of jealousy.
-   In _Venus Versus Virus_, Sumire's male cousin, Riku, likes her. He's several years younger than her, so it's unrequited.
-   In _The World is Still Beautiful_, Kitra has feelings for his cousin Nike, but she only seems to him as a good childhood friend.
-   _World's End Harem: Fantasia_: Main protagonist Arc and his original Love Interest Aurelia, whose Arranged Marriage to the prince of The Empire kickstarts the Myth Arc, are initially said to be cousins, in an already closely related group of noble families. Chapter 31 clarifies the Tangled Family Tree: The Patriarch Arges Isteshia, despite being referred to as Arc's grandfather, is in fact his maternal great-uncle (Arc's mother was Arges's niece), and Aurelia is his granddaughter. This makes Arc and Aurelia second cousins.

    Asian Animation 

-   Angelalily, one of the wolves from _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_, is related to both her cousin Wilie's parents. She also has such a massive crush on Wilie that it reaches the point where she sees him through a Crush Filter.

    Comedy 

-   Discussed by Eddie Izzard, in regards to the British royal family:
    
    **Eddie:** She was one of our more frumpy queens. They're all frumpy, aren't they? Because it's a bad idea when cousins marry! \[...\] First rule of genetics: spread the genes apart, you know? But the royals are just obsessed with: "Are you a royal family? Are you a royal member? Well, then you can marry me, 'cause you're the same gene pool and our IQ's will go down the toilet." Fantastic. That's why there's no crazy royals, they're all kind of: _\[drawls\]_ "Hello, hello. What do you do? Oh, you're a plumber. What on _earth_ is that?"
    
-   Among Jeff Foxworthy's indications that "You Might Be a Redneck..."
    
    "If your family tree never forks..."  
    "If you go to family reunions hoping to pick up girls..."
    

    Comic Books 

-   In the _Douwe Dabbert_ story _Florin the Loafer_, count Justus van Bottericke attempts to force his cousin Gwendoline to marry him, because if she does not, he will lose the rights to his title.
-   _The Inhumans_: Black Bolt, the king of Attilan, is married to his cousin Medusa. Sorta justified: due to the limited gene pool of the Inhumans, just about every two-Inhuman marriage involves cousins.
-   MAD
    -   In their parody of _Return of the Jedi_, the characters discover at the end that they're all related to one another, but since Han and Leia are "only" second cousins, they can safely marry.
    -   In one _Monroe_ comic, the eponymous teen was visited by his punky Scottish cousin, and they made out a few times. She decided she didn't want to see him anymore because he was freaky with his "finger-skateboards", but as he said, at least he got to "make oot" that summer.
-   _Old Man Logan_ features a Bad Future where the Hulk and cousin She-Hulk have bred and produced inbred offspring. This is all due to her being the only woman able to "take the pace" of Hulk sexually. Hulk and She-Hulk are both radioactive, too, which probably doesn't help... It's not the first time the romantic/sexuality thing has been brought up between these two, as some of Fixit's dialogue with her implies he's more than game, but there's also some implication that in this case, it may not be consensual.
-   In _Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)_, Knuckles the Echidna and his girlfriend Julie-Su are actually distant cousins, but neither one is aware of it, and it's not directly acknowledged anywhere in the series. They did, however, release a family tree at one point,<small>◊</small> forgetting that their family tree closes back in on itself.
-   _Sub-Mariner_: The ultimate desire of Namora has been shown to be her cousin Namor. Namor's late wife Dorma was also his cousin, and Namorita (daughter/clone of Namora, and therefore cousin of Namor) was in love with Namor at one point, though it was unrequited.
-   _Superman_:
    -   Clark Kent's daughter engages in a literal example<small>◊</small> in a story taking place in an alternate future. (Lucy and Lois are sisters, which makes Lucy and Jimmy's son the cousin of Lois and Clark's daughter. Apparently, that doesn't bother Lola _or_ Jimmy Jr, let alone their parents, happily watching them make out. The issue itself makes no mention of them being cousins, with the main obstacle to their happiness being It's Not You, It's My Enemies. They do live Happily Ever After in the end.
    -   The Man of Steel himself apparently had such feelings for his cousin Kara<small>◊</small> (Supergirl). In _that_ one, Supergirl tries to find Supes a girlfriend. After many failed attempts, we get a scene where it's obvious they are really attracted to each other, which seems to make it perfectly clear that the law is the only thing stopping them from pursuing a relationship. Eventually, Kara fixes Supes up with a girl that is nigh identical to herself, but older, and they hit it off. Unfortunately, it turns out yellow sun is her Kryptonite, and he can't leave Earth unprotected, so they must part.
    -   _The Superdictionary_ has Kara and Clark deserving a rest.<small>◊</small> Maybe it's just hard to make her look unsexy, but... that looks far from innocent, and the repetition, though intended to drill the definition into a kid's mind, _really_ makes it sound like she is saying "We deserve a rest, nudge nudge wink wink," and the big blue boy scout just isn't getting it yet.
    -   In _Action Comics #260_, Clark has Kara disguise herself as a superheroine from another dimension, and she and Supes proceed to have make-outs (in _front_ of Lois), all to fool some dim alien invasion.
    -   And from Bronze Age storyline _Krypton No More_ comes Superman walking out of the shower and finding his cousin waiting for him<small>◊</small>... and the writer seems completely unaware of the tone he is setting.
    -   In _Supergirl: Candor_, Kara is mind-controlled by evil telepath Saturn Queen into getting engaged to Ultraman, an evil Alternate Universe counterpart of Superman, but genetically it makes no difference.
    -   In _Many Happy Returns_, Pre-Crisis Supergirl and Superboy (Kon-El) are immediately smitten with one another, which an irritated Linda Danvers comments on.
-   In the German comic _Wendy_, the titular character dates her foster-cousin for most of the story until her aunt decides that she doesn't want to adopt him and his twin sister after all, as they aren't as rich anymore. After that, he breaks up with Wendy to date his previous foster sister Vanessa instead, while implied to still live in her house.
-   In _X-Wing Rogue Squadron_, Plourr Illo was engaged to her cousin since childhood. In the arc where she returns to her homeworld and takes up the reins, she's shown resisting the idea of marrying him, but since he shows a number of her traits—lots of courage, love of fighting and freedom, disdain for tradition for tradition's sake and even being a fighter pilot like her—she warms up to him. It's never shown whether they actually get married at some point. And their being cousins never seemed to bother Plourr, it was only the "arranged marriage to an aristocrat she hadn't seen in 20 years" part that was a problem.

    Comic Strips 

-   Norman _Drabble_ once ran into his girlfriend at a family wedding. After spending some time having fun with her, he asks why she's there. It turns out they're both related to the bride. A few strips later, it was revealed that they weren't blood relatives, but Norman didn't tell his girlfriend that immediately.

    Fairy Tales 

-   Several of Madame d'Aulnoy's Fairy Tale couples are first cousins — a natural consequence of their both having to have Royal Blood and reflecting the royal families of their day. These include _Princess Belle-Etoile_ and _The Bee and the Orange Tree._ Also, Belle-Etoile and her husband Cheri are double first cousins—their fathers are brothers and their mothers are sisters.
-   Also occasionally featured in the fairy tales of Henriette-Julie de Murat and Charlotte-Rose de Caumont La Force.
    -   In Murat's fairy tale _Perfect Love_, the main couple, Irolite and Parcin Parcinet, are first cousins. The two have another cousin, Azire, who is in love with Parcin Parcinet.
    -   Another Murat fairy tale, _The Palace of Revenge_, features first cousins Imis and Philax in love. Subverted, however, in that the two do not get married at the end.
    -   La Force's _The Good Woman_ features two cousin couples. The main couple, Lirette and Finfin, are first cousins. The Beta Couple, Mirtis (Lirette's older sister) and Finfin's unnamed younger brother, are also first cousins.
-   In the first written version of _Beauty and the Beast_, Beauty and the Beast turn out to be first cousins: his mother and her biological father are siblings.
-   Also featured in the Breton fairy tale _The Groac'h of the Isle of Lok_. The protagonists, Houarn Pogamm and Bellah Postik, are first cousins through their mothers.
-   The French fairy tale _The Little Green Frog_ features a second cousin couple, Prince Saphir and Princess Serpentine. Their fathers are first cousins.
-   _Ourson_ by the Comtesse de Segur: the protagonist Ourson and his love interest Violette are first cousins.
-   _Prince Vivien and the Princess Placida_ has the titular Vivien and Placida, who are first cousins. Placida is the daughter of King Gridelin and Queen Santorina, while Vivien is the king's nephew.
-   _Rosanella_ features a second cousin couple. Rosanella's father and Mirliflor's father are first cousins.
-   In many Arab fairy tales, reflecting common practices, a woman is normally expected to marry her first cousin. (One example of such a couple is found in _The Story of Dschemil and Dschemila,_ which comes from Libya.) This causes serious complications when she falls in love with another man; some tales have men forced to leave a tribe lest it happen. However, some first cousins graciously concede; this is often resolved by the new bridegroom offering the first cousin his own cousin.
-   In the Arabian Nights story _The Story of Prince Ahmed and the Fairy Paribanou,_ the sultan's sons compete for the hand of their first cousin, Princess Nouronnihar. Ali, the middle son, ends up marrying her. Averted with the protagonist Ahmed (the sultan's youngest son) and his wife Paribanou, who are not relatives.
-   The now-forgotten French fairy tale novella _The Tyranny of the Fairies Destroyed_ by Madame d'Auneuil features several couples. The main couple, Philonice and Anaxandre, are first cousins.

    Fan Works 

-   During the Random Slashy Interludes in _Bag Enders_, Merry and Pippin often resort to each other when they can't find anyone else, and sometimes include Frodo.
-   The _Frozen_ fanfic _Becoming Family_ has a romance developing between Elsa's daughter Katja and Anna's son Matteus. In their case, Katja is adopted so they're unrelated by blood.
-   _Ben 10_ has a rather large following for Ben and Gwen since the first series. This can be connected to the Bleached Underpants history of the original draft of the show in which Ben and Gwen were not relatives but rather in the same school class.
-   In _The Berserker's Bride_, Hiccup and Snotlout were originally meant to marry (Snotlout thinking that she was useless while she thought of him as The Bully), only for her to instead marry Dagur to unite their tribes. After she visits Berk with Dagur and reveals that she is pregnant, Snotlout tries coming on to her (thinking that she's now attractive) and even almost tries raping her.
-   _Blind Courage_: Impa was in love with her cousin, Zelda's now-deceased mother Iriana. Nothing came out of that crush because Iriana was married off at age 14.
-   Discussed in _Brontide_, where Harry and Ginny had officially adopted Teddy as their son, and he worries that this would prevent him from pursuing romance with Victoire since she's technically his cousin.
-   _Child of the Storm_ touches on this a couple of times in regards to Harry and Jean Grey, his second cousin on his mother's side, who's about two and a half years older than he is. The author, who's British and therefore less fazed by such a relationship, included her as someone Harry might end up dating in a poll (naturally, he would Take a Third Option).
    -   When they meet, the two are immediately drawn to each other and are revealed to have a psychic connection that is theorised to possibly even date back to the womb. However, on Jean's side, the relationship is entirely platonic (she sees him as the little brother that she never had) while Harry's attitude is a little more complicated. Emotionally, he wants a big sister type figure. However, he's a straight Hormone-Addled Teenager, and Jean is gorgeous. Ultimately, emotions win, though he doesn't suddenly become blind to Jean's good looks, being rather embarrassed when he sees her in a skimpy bikini.
    -   Maddie is another kettle of fish entirely, for all that she's Jean's Separated at Birth twin sister and she has the same mental connection. When he sees her in a thin, skimpy nightie, he pays rather more attention than he did with Jean, trying not to stare. It's later noted in the sequel that a part of him thinks more than just cousinly thoughts about her.
-   _Dancing with My Punchlines_ has Maedhros and Fingon (who are step-cousins but nonetheless), and Finrod and Curufin, and Finrod and Caranthir.
-   _Earth-27_:
    -   Jade Nguyen/Cheshire and Thomas Blake/Catman, are former lovers and (albeit unaware) second cousins due to his paternal grandfather and her maternal grandfather being brothers.
    -   Gomez and Morticia Addams are also second cousins, but very much happily married.
-   In _Fangs & Fins_, first cousins James and Arianna are forced into an arranged marriage.
-   _Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce_: It's briefly mentioned that Amycus and Alecto Carrow's father married his cousin when he was 16. Later in the story, there were government-enforced plans for an Arranged Marriage between a pair of first-cousins-once-removed, but considering the girl in question is 17 while involuntarily betrothed to her mother's cousin, who's more than twice her age, her mother is understandably outraged by this arrangement.
-   It comes up in _Kara of Rokyn_ when the titular character tells her family about her cousin's teenage crush on a girl nicknamed "Supergirl". When asked if he fell for her, Kara dodges the question.
    
    Kara Zor-El said, "Would you believe that Kal once told me that one of the first girls he ever fell for in his life was named Supergirl?"  
    The others at the dinner party reacted with shock, laughter, surprise, disbelief, curiosity, amusement, or a combination of the above.  
    "How's this, Kara?" asked Van-Zee, cautiously. "You don't mean he fell for you, do you?"  
    She smiled an I-know-something-you-don't smile at him.
    
-   The pairing of Little Foot and Ali is surprisingly popular from _The Land Before Time_ series in fanwork. However, Little Foot's grandpa clearly states that Ali's herd are Little Foot's family's cousins.
-   In the _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fanfiction, _Maternal Instinct_, the Changeling royal family, the House of Roachanov, has a reputation for practicing royal intermarriage, much like the European monarchies of old, ironic as the culture is predominantly of Imperial Japan. The Crown Princess, Pupa, is already set to marry her first cousin, Prince Morphin.
-   _Nala: My Father's Madness_ portrays Simba and Nala's relationship as this. Nala is secretly Sarafina and Scar's child, while Scar is Simba's uncle.
-   In _No Longer Alone_ Sirius and his cousin Narcissa had an affair up until _three hours_ before her marriage to Lucius Malfoy.
-   _Not the intended use (Zantetsuken Reverse)_: Downplayed. Julius's parents are _technically_ cousins, but their last common ancestor was over 300 years ago. The person who reveals this says that he figured there wasn't much of a blood relation there, and therefore didn't object to the wedding.
-   The _Phineas and Ferb_ fandom has a fairly large following for a pair of Original Characters named Marie Flynn (daughter of Phineas and Isabella) and Thomas Fletcher (son of Ferb and Vanessa), with the latter having a crush on the former. ("Isn't she your cousin?" "Step-cousin." Of course, even that falls apart in Alternate Universes where Phineas and Vanessa are half-siblings.) All in all though, Thomarie is pretty cute... even if Marie is as oblivious as her father.
-   Defied in _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_. Clair is very close with her cousin Lance, and admits that she could probably fall for him if they weren't related. But given that the clan's elders are pressuring her to get married and have kids, she decides to keep that to herself in case they get weird ideas.
-   In _The Pride That Never Was_, Shani and Kovu are love interests despite being first cousins once removed.
-   _Queens of Mewni_: It wasn't uncommon for the queens in the Butterfly kingdom to marry a cousin of theirs, in fact, Celestialism, the main religion in Mewni, doesn't consider relationships between cousins incestuous.
    -   Cosmica married her cousin Pyxar. Pyxar's mother Nixie objected _strongly_ to the union, but it was less about them being related and more because she still resented Cosmica's mother for 'stealing' Nixie's intended love interest. There were some that did object to Cosmica and Pyxar's marriage, but it was less that they were cousins it itself and more that cousin marriage was practiced among the oppressive Titans the Mewnian people escaped from, and many feared a return to that time.
    -   Helia married her cousin Clovald. Clovald was literally the _only_ person that the demisexual Helia was interested in.
    -   Diana married her cousin Tileford. The notable thing was, of all the royal matches, they were the only one to have a _perfect_ score in compatibility. Granted, some blamed their daughter Sky's diminutive stature on the consanguinity.
    -   While Venus did not _marry_ her cousin Swan (for the obvious reason that they were both women), it's Swan who Venus lost her virginity to, and made her into the hypersexual Ethical Slut Venus became (which is more than we can say for Swan).
    -   Crescenta would have an affair with her cousin Acorn to spite her philandering husband. Some believed her daughter Waxinne to be the result of that affair, though she claims Waxinne is Hawk's.
-   This appears as Surprise Incest in the _Jem_ fanfic _The Ripple Effect_. Jerrica's mother Jacqui grew up in the foster care system after her mother died in childbirth. At the end of the story, Jerrica and her sister Kimber find papers that show who fathered Jacqui. It turns out that they share the same grandfather as Eric Raymond. Jerrica had a crush on him when she was younger and Eric, during his Villainous Breakdown, developed a Villainous Crush on Jerrica and tried to rape her. Kimber and Jerrica are both grossed out by learning about their relationship with their now-deceased cousin.
-   In _The Secret Life of Punzie_, Rapunzel and Anna are cousins but are very much in a sexual relationship. This is often glossed over as not only is cousin-incest considered less risque than between siblings but because they are both women and therefore the stigma is less justified.
-   The _Superman_ story _Superman of 2499: The Great Confrontation_ provides some examples:
    -   Alan and Kath are twenty-second cousins, so no one objects to their relationship.
    -   On the other hand, Adam and Sybilla are first cousins. None of their parents is comfortable with their getting together.
-   In _Their Bond_, Zelda's cousin, Prince Daltus of Lucrum, asks her to marry him. She declines his offers and, either way, she's already engaged to her Guardian, Impa.
-   _There and Back Again_: As the story's AO3 tags and multiple moments of Ship Tease make clear, Jon and Sansa (who are first cousins through her father and his mother being siblings) are the main endgame Official Couple.
-   In the _Smallville_ fanfic _Under the Influence_, exposure to Red Kryptonite leads first cousins Clark and Kara to spend the night together.
-   In _Yule Ball Drama_, Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis are first cousins and in a romantic relationship.
-   In _Sleeping Dogs Lie_, Sirius mentions having kissed Bellatrix in a non-cousinly manner when they were teenagers.

    Films — Animation 

-   In _Bambi_, Faline is referred to as Bambi's cousin in some supplementary material. In the book they are first cousins through their mothers. Disney made sure to not mention this in the film, making it vague if they're related or not.
-   In _Bee Movie_, Referenced and discussed as one of the many adult jokes in the film. This is common for bees. When a hesitant Adam asks Barry if the female bees swooning over them are their cousins too, Barry shrugs it off and tells him they're only _distant_ cousins so it's okay.
-   _The Lion King_:
    -   In _The Lion King_, Fridge Logic dictates that Simba and Nala must be either cousins or half-siblings because Scar and Mufasa are the only adult male lions in the pride. This is later defied in _The Lion Guard_ where it's shown that Nala's dad is a random, unknown lion.
    -   _The Lion King II: Simba's Pride_ defies this by specifically mentioning twice that Scar is _not_ Kovu's father, though fans still speculate. Kovu was meant to be Scar's son but then they noticed that'd make Kiara and Kovu cousins once removed. Of course, this just raises the question of who Kovu's real father is, and why he looks so much like Scar.
-   Referenced in _Quest for Camelot_ by Devon, one half of the two-headed dragon, when the human heroes inquire what exactly they are.
    
    **Devon:** Frankly, we're the reason cousins shouldn't marry.
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The main character in _Barry Lyndon_ courted his cousin, which was a lot more common in that day.
-   Dar and Kin in _The Beastmaster_. It's actually achieved through Fridge Logic; their relationship to each other is never noted at all in the film after the reveal that Dar is the son of Kin's uncle the King, and they don't see any problems in a romantic relationship by the film's end.
-   In _The Blue Lagoon (1980)_, Richard and Emmeline are cousins, traveling with Richard's father to San Francisco, where, presumably, she would have been raised as his sister. (Her parents had died, which is why they were traveling.) After the shipwreck, and the loss of the only adult with them, Paddy the ship's cook, things get a little more personal when puberty sets in and they don't have anyone to explain it to them.
-   _Clerks_: Jay says he'll have sex with anyone — including his own cousin, possibly.
-   In _Cruel Intentions 2_, the girls in the shower claim to be this (even though in real life they were played by real-life identical twins, making the scene an almost-crossover with Twin Threesome Fantasy).
-   _Dames_: Lovers Jimmy and Barbara are members of the same extended family. "It doesn't seem right loving each other the way we do, being related," says Barbara, only for Jimmy to parry that they're "13th cousins."
-   The romantic leads in _The Ghoul_, Betty Harlon and Ralph Morlant, are distant cousins.
-   In _The Godfather Part III_, Michael's daughter Mary and his nephew Vincent are in love. Michael is against their relationship, but Mary's mother Kay is not. However, Michael's objections are apparently not based on consanguinity, but on the danger of Vincent's lifestyle.
-   Brought up humorously by Daisy in _The Great Gatsby (2013)_ when her cousin Nick asks her to visit him to reunite with Gatsby and when she arrives, she discovers his house is full of flowers courtesy of Gatsby. She murmurs he must be in love with her.
-   In the Saoirse Ronan movie _How I Live Now_, protagonist Daisy quickly falls in love with her cousin Edmond (they're first cousins, her dad is the brother of Edmond's mother) and the feeling is mutual... so much so that they eventually move beyond the kissing stage.
-   In _Mean Girls_, Karen talks about what a good kisser her cousin is.
    
    **Karen:** Yeah, but... he's my _first_ cousin. Like, you have your cousins, and then you have your first cousins, and then you have your second cousins...  
    **Gretchen:** No, honey, uh-uh.  
    **Karen:** That's not right, is it?  
    **Gretchen:** That is _so_ not right.
    
-   _My Girl 2_: Vada Sultenfuss and Nick Zsigmond have Belligerent Sexual Tension throughout the movie, but will become cousins soon when her Uncle Phil gets engaged to his mother Rose. That doesn't stop Vada and Nick from having a pretty dramatic First Kiss right before Vada leaves to go home.
-   Averted in _Once Upon a Time in China_ where Wong Fei Hung and his Aunt 13 are _not_ blood relatives, though he calls her aunt even when they are around the same age because their fathers are sworn brothers.
-   In _Romy and Michele's High School Reunion_, Michele lost her virginity to her cousin Barry.
-   _The Secret Garden_:
    -   In the 1993 film, Colin wants to marry his cousin Mary when they grow up so that they can always be together. Mary is amused but uninterested. Colin's response is a jealous loathing of Dickon, the servant boy who helps them in the titular garden, with whom he suspects Mary of falling in love. Their mothers are stated to be identical twins, thus making this even iffier genetically, since the offspring of identical twins are genetic half-siblings (assuming the other parents involved to not also be identical and to be two different people).
    -   In the 1987 Hallmark adaptation adult Colin (portrayed by a very young-looking Colin Firth) proposes to Mary at the end and she accepts. However, in this version, they are not related — Colin's father is an old friend of Mary's parents instead of being Mary's uncle.
-   The romance between Heather Mason and Vincent Cooper in _Silent Hill: Revelation 3D_. In the first _Silent Hill_ film, Heather's biological mother Dahlia was the sister of the villain Christabella. In _Revelation 3D_, Vincent is the son of the villain Claudia, who is Christabella's sister. Therefore, Dahlia and Claudia are also probably sisters and Heather and Vincent are probably cousins. It could be possible, however, that Dahlia and Claudia could be unrelated if one was a maternal half-sibling (uterine) and the other was a paternal half-sibling (agnate/cosanguine). It's likely, however, that the writer of the second film missed the fact that Dahlia and Christabella were sisters in the first film. It's not the only Retcon.
-   In the silent film version of _Snow White (1916)_ starring Marguerite Clark, Snow White and Prince Florimond are cousins.
-   In _Tombstone_, Doc Holliday tells Wyatt Earp that as a teenager, he fell in love with his first cousin; she entered a convent over their affair.
-   In _The Wolf of Wall Street_ to establish what a Cloudcuckoolander Donnie Azoff is, after Jordan Belfort and Azoff form a business partnership Belfort asks him if the rumors that he married his cousin are true. Azoff says they are (as seen on the Quotes page), and when Belfort asks about the risk of their kids having a disability, Azoff says they would drop them off at an institution to deal with kids like that.
-   In the Victorian farce _The Wrong Box_, Michael tries to resist his attraction to his cousin Julia:<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    
    **Michael:** We both know what kissing leads to, and if I may be blunt, our children would be idiots.  
    **Julia:** Why, is there insanity in your family?
    
-   In _The Yards_, Leo, the main character, had a relationship with his cousin Erica when they were younger. There is a romantic subplot between the two throughout the movie.
-   The 2009 film _The Young Victoria_ is about the early life of Queen Victoria and her marriage to Prince Albert, her first cousin.

    Literature 

-   In _½ Prince_, Rose kisses Prince in the game. Eventually, it's revealed that Rose's player is actually her cousin. And by cousin, it's meant that she's her mother's older sister's husband's uncle's third daughter.
-   The _1632_ series has fun with this trope. The locals see nothing wrong with cousin marriage. The transplanted Americans are a lot more sensitive about this sort of thing (being from West Virginia, they've heard ALL the "inbred hillbilly" jokes).

-   In the _Babar_ books, the title character eventually married his cousin, Celeste. The Animated Adaptation changed this particular aspect, making the two unrelated and turning their relationship into Childhood Friend Romance instead. Of course, the books never specify what _degree_ of cousin Celeste is.
-   In Felix Salten's _Bambi_, Bambi and Faline are cousins (their mothers are sisters). They start off as Childhood Friends but come mating season as adults and Bambi becomes deeply attracted to his female cousin. They end up having twin foals together, but by their birth Bambi has already abandoned them.
-   Skinflick in Josh Bazell's _Beat the Reaper_ is a young _mafioso_ in love with his cousin. The narrator is non-judgmental about this.
-   Ultimately subverted in _Blandings Castle:_ The third book has older members of the family pushing cousins Ronnie and Millicent to get married, though they see each other as Like Brother and Sister (the book was released in 1929, and could be seen as a commentary on changing attitudes about the idea). They do briefly form a miserable engagement when their respective relationships suffer Second Act Breakups, but naturally, things work out in the end.
-   In Henry De Vere Stacpoole's _The Blue Lagoon_, first cousins Richard "Dicky" Lestrange, a 10-year-old boy, and Emmeline Lestrange, an 8-year-old girl, are left stranded on an island after a shipwreck. The only adult looking after them dies after a few years and the cousins have to fend for themselves as they grow up together. As a result, they fall in love and have a child together.
-   In _Bright Lines_, Ella is attracted to her female cousin Charu. It's even more complicated because Ella was orphaned as a child and raised as Charu's sister. Charu strictly sees Ella as her older sister, but Ella only sees Charu as a cousin.
-   In _A Brother's Price_, Jerin Whistler and Princess Rennsellaer find, after downgrading his virginity status to technical levels, that they share great-great-grandmothers making them third cousins. Ren declares that it is distant enough for the relation to be fine and, indeed, that's how it's seen. At another point in the story, the adult princesses discuss their first cousin (son of their father's biological sister) Cullen as a potential husband. They collectively agree that while he'd be a good husband on his own merits, the biological relationship is just too close to be acceptable.
-   In the _Bunduki_ novels by J.T. Edson, Bunduki and Dawn are adoptive cousins. They end up married.
-   In Lawrence Block's _The Burglar in the Library_ of the Bernie Rhodenbarr book series, it's revealed that Earlene Cobb is pregnant with her cousin Orris' baby and that she put sugar in the snowblower's gas tank to punish him for showing interest in their cousin Molly.
-   In Dorothy L. Sayers's _Busman's Honeymoon_, Lord Peter Wimsey worries about children because of how his brother's turned out. Harriet points out that his brother married his own cousin; his sister, who married a commoner, has children who are perfectly fine.
-   _The Camp Half-Blood Series_ and its associated spin-off series:
    -   Some couples in the franchise, particularly from the Greco-Roman series, are technically this, as their divine parents are part of a really complicated Tangled Family Tree. For example, the main couple, Percy and Annabeth, are first cousins once removed, since the former's father, Poseidon, is an uncle of the latter's mother, Athena. However, _The Last Olympian_ handwaves this by stating that gods don't have DNA, so it isn't creepy for couples with different divine parents to have a relationship. Couples with the same godly parents, however, _are_ creepy.
    -   Other than gods, the _Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard_ series has Sam being betrothed to Amir, who is explicitly stated to be a relative on the mortal side. They are both descended from the Real Life 10th-century traveler Ahmad ibn Fadlan, but whether there are closer shared ancestors is unknown. Cousin marriage (or at least marriage between close families) is actually a common practice in the Arab world, not only to strengthen alliances (the Arabs being traditionally a clannish society) but also to keep inheritance in-family.
-   _A Certain Magical Index_: In her brief appearance, Touma Kamijou's cousin Otohime Tatsugami tries to hit on him.
-   In _Charmed Life_, by Diana Wynne Jones, Cat and Gwendolen's parents were first cousins. Chrestomanci explains that when they decided to marry, it caused their family to make a great fuss. "It is, you see, rather a bad thing for cousins to marry when there's witchcraft in the family."

-   Played with in _Crescent City:_ the Autumn King arranges a marriage between his daughter, Bryce, and her cousin, Cormac, seemingly just to be a dick to her. Bryce has no intention of going through with it, while Cormac seems to like the idea. He doesn't; it just gives him an excuse to visit the city for his rebel activities.
-   In _The Darkangel Trilogy_ there's a love triangle in which all three participants are cousins. Two of them didn't know they were related at first, but the discovery has no effect at all on their romance either bad or good—it doesn't seem to be relevant to them.
-   Wang Yuyan has a one-sided crush on her cousin Murong Fu in _Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils_.
-   _Deryni_: According to King Kelson getting a dispensation to marry a first cousin once removed isn't a problem, implying that the Church would be reluctant to allow marriage between a couple more closely related.
-   In _The Dinosaur Lords_, lovers Jaume and Melodía are first cousins, and no one bats an eye at their romance, even pushing them towards engagement. Deliberate, as the story takes place in the equivalent of fourteenth-century Europe.
-   In _Eight Cousins_' sequel _Rose in Bloom_, the only people that the heroine Rose even _considers_ marrying are three of her seven male cousins: Archie (who falls for Rose's lady-in-waiting Phebe), Charlie "the Handsome," and Mackenzie, aka Mac. Rose's guardian, Uncle Alec, explicitly says that he does not approve of cousins marrying, but that he can't think of a better possible match for her; meanwhile her aunt Clara, Charlie's mother—overheard and tactlessly quoted by yet another cousin—holds that Rose should marry one of them "to keep the money in the family." After Charlie dies, Rose falls for Mac and marries him, while Archie and Phebe finally overcome the family veto to their relationship. As a bonus, Archie's 12-year-old brother Jamie gives Rose a love declaration at some point, which she rejects not because he's her cousin, but because she sees him as Just a Kid.
-   The corrupt churchman Annias tries to persuade Queen Ehlana to marry her cousin, Prince Lycheas, in the David Eddings _Elenium_ trilogy. She refuses, mostly on the grounds that she can't stand him but also on the grounds that he might actually be her half-brother, given that her father and his mother were a little closer than siblings ought to be. He isn't. Lycheas was actually the son of Annias, which was part of why he was pushing the marriage.
-   _The Elric Saga_: Elric of Melnibone's betrothed is his cousin Cymoril. He damns himself (and ends up killing her) by accepting the demonic blade Stormbringer to rescue her from her brother Yyrkoon.
-   _The Empirium Trilogy_: Double subverted with Audric and Ludivine, who are a pair of engaged cousins at the beginning of the series. The engagement was arranged by their parents as part of a political move, and Audric is in love with Rielle, not Ludivine. That said, Ludivine states in _Kingsbane_ that she'd have no issue having a threesome with Audric and Rielle, something that Audric agrees with.
-   In Tanya Huff's _The Enchantment Emporium_ Gales, a clan of witches usually (though not always) marry their cousins to keep from diluting the magic inherent in their genes and to keep said magic secret. Furthermore, because there are far more female Gales than male the boys usually "make the rounds" of their age group cousins before settling down. This imbalance between the sexes also leads to a lot of "close" relationships between the Gale girls. One of these, between the main character Alysha and her cousin Charlie, is particularly focused on in the book.
-   In _Endo and Kobayashi Live! The Latest on Tsundere Villainess Lieselotte_, Baldur is asked to marry one of distant cousin Lieselotte's sisters as a condition of being Bruno's successor. And his crushing on Fiene can't avert this, since Fiene turns out to be Lieselotte's first cousin by blood and thus is _also_ a cousin of Baldur's.

-   In Isabel Allende's _Eva Luna_, when Rolf Carlé comes to America from post-World War II Austria, he lives with his uncle and aunt and is attracted to both of his cousins, and not only are his affections reciprocated by _both_ girls, but they actually jump him and they "share" the cousin/lover for their teenage years, until Rolf becomes an Intrepid Reporter and the girls marry local guys. The three still remember these escapades as some of their happiest moments ever. Also, it's mentioned that the girls' parents _did_ seriously consider having him marry one of the girls, "sighing because there was only one of him".
-   In _The Fire's Stone_, Aaron's first love, Ruth, was his cousin.
-   In Christopher Moore's _Fool_, Pocket has running on/off affairs with both Goneril and Regan, unaware that they're both his first cousins by way of rape. Probably wouldn't have stopped any of them if they did know, though. He certainly doesn't seem horrified by it when he does find out. In fact he winds up marrying the youngest sister Cordelia. Whether she knows about the family connection or not isn't revealed.
-   In the 1818 version of _Frankenstein_, Victor Frankenstein and his fiancée, Elizabeth Lavenza, are cousins who also happen to have been raised in the same household. In the 1831 version, Elizabeth was adopted rather than being related to Victor, but the two were still raised as siblings.
-   Averted in _The Goblin Emperor_: Maia, the new emperor, does not know much about the noble families, but when his marriage is discussed he draws attention to the fact that some of the potential brides must be related to him, and says that he would rather not marry a cousin. His secretary promptly excludes any woman closer than the third degree of kinship from the list.
-   The Wilkes and Hamilton families in _Gone with the Wind_ have the tradition of cousins marrying each other. The text makes it clear that multi-generational inbreeding is the main reason for Melly's frail health and physique.
-   In John C. Wright's _Green Knight's Squire_, when it comes up that Nerea is Gil's cousin, Ruff is quick to point out that means second cousin once removed.
-   In _Un grito en las tinieblas; la vida de Zárate Arkham_, the titular character sleeps with her cousin, although both of them were possessed by the spirits of their uncle and his female servant respectively—which makes the sex scene a case of double incest.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   It's implied that purebloodism leads to frequent inbreeding. Arthur and Sirius explicitly state that all surviving pureblood wizards are related to some degree. Particularly after the wholesale slaughter of the second Death Eater war, there are simply so few purebloods left that those who still care about blood purity will have no alternative but to marry their cousins. Essentially if a pure or half-blood wizard marries someone who isn't Muggle-born, they're going to be related in some way — however distantly.
    -   Sirius and Regulus Black's parents, Orion and Walburga, were second cousins. Walburga already had the surname Black even before she married.
    -   Teddy Lupin and Victoire Weasley are fourth cousins once removed.
    -   Molly and Arthur Weasley were popularly thought to be this, as a certain Ignatius Prewett married Lucretia Black, who was Arthur's second cousin. However, Lucretia was Molly's aunt by marriage, not her mother.
    -   For a long time, Harry and Ginny were strongly implied to be third cousins through the House of Black, until new information Jossed the theory by making Harry's paternal grandfather unrelated to the Blacks.
    -   After Tonks's Patronus takes a canine form, Harry wonders if she had been in love with Sirius, her cousin once removed since he was an Animagus who turned into a dog. It turned out to be Lupin, a werewolf, however.
    -   The Gaunt family is described as "An ancient, in-bred, pure-blood wizarding family living in slovenly conditions in a shack in Little Hangleton." This is supposedly the main cause of poor Merope's "cross-eyed" appearance, and a streak of mental instability, such as with Morfin Gaunt. Although in this case, it's quite strongly implied that the Gaunts have gone much further than this trope to keep the bloodline "pure".
    -   Interestingly, as a case of Pragmatic Villainy, while the Malfoys are Fantastic Racists, they avoid first-cousin marriage—explicitly because they've seen how this drove several other pureblood families insane. Granted, there are so few pureblood families that they still end up marrying third-degree cousins, etc. at times, but they try not to be stupid about it. Sometimes they'll even marry half-bloods rather than a first cousin.
-   _Heralds of Valdemar_:
    -   _Owlsight_ has a brief relationship between Darian and (adoptive) double first cousin Summerdance.
    -   The _Last Herald-Mage Trilogy_ has Treven and Jisa, grandson and great-granddaughter of Queen Elspeth the Peacemaker, married in secret before inheriting the throne from Jisa's father Randale. They are actually not blood cousins since Randale was infertile and turned to Herald Vanyel instead, but this is _not_ widely known. It caused brief controversy in court before everyone became resigned to it; given that both Elspeth and Randale made serious use of Altar Diplomacy it may be they objected at least as much to the marriage as the relationship itself.
    -   In the _Mage Winds_ books, Firesong boasts of being a descendant of Vanyel on "both sides". Vanyel had sired a pair of twins for the Tayledras. Seven hundred years later, and given what an insular population the Tayledras are, it's not surprising that his bloodline crossed itself a few times.
-   In _Hope Leslie_, there's William and Alice and, years later, Hope and Everell, but in both cases, they are distant cousins.
-   In the young adult book _How I Live Now_ by Meg Rosoff, teenage cousins Daisy and Edmond fall passionately in love. Daisy wonders uneasily for a while "if that's the feeling you're supposed to have when your cousin touches a perfectly innocent part of your anatomy that's even fully clothed". By the middle of the book, she doesn't care. The book treats their romance sympathetically.
-   Played with in _The Hunger Games_. The Capitol does not approve of Katniss's close friendship with Gale, seeing him as a potential rival to Peeta, so they claim the two are cousins. This is plausible since they both have black hair, olive skin, and gray eyes, as typical of people from the Seam. In the third book, President Coin asks Katniss if she wants Gale declared as her new lover, which would make them this trope in the public's eye. Katniss declines.
-   Stephen Colbert's stalking of his ex-girlfriend Charlene (as in the hit song "Charlene (I'm Right Behind You)") had been a Running Gag for quite a while before it was revealed that they were also cousins. In his book, _I Am America (And So Can You!)_, he says that it's okay to marry your cousin because The Bible doesn't say you can't.
    
    **Colbert:** Let's see... Leviticus Chapter 18 Verse 12—_"Thou shall not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister"_ ...blah blah blah... _"thy mother's sister"_ ...yeech... _"of thy father's brother"_ ...man, there were some sick Levites... _"of thy daughter-in-law"_ ...fair enough... _"of thy brother's wife."_ Nope! Nothing about cousins.
    
-   In _I Saved Too Many Girls and Caused the Apocalypse_, one of Rekka's heroines is his relative Hibiki, and her first conversation to Rekka is asking him to marry her. However, it turns out that she wants to marry him, not because she loves him, but because she wants to end both the Namidare and Banjo bloodlines in one fell swoop.
-   In Andre Norton's _Ice Crown_, Nelis asks whether Roane is "ringed" to her first cousin Sandar, which causes Roane to laugh. Though at the end, he explains that he is the queen's first cousin, to show that their connection is not romantic.

-   Zig-Zagged twice in _InCryptid_: Sarah and Artie like each other but Cannot Spit It Out. They're only cousins by marriage, plus she's adopted, _plus_ they're different _species_ (she's not even a mammal), so the main obstacle to them getting together is each one thinking the other doesn't like them that way.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>

-   In _Jude the Obscure_ Jude and his cousin Sue fall in love. It's the reason they resist their attraction in the first place which causes so many problems down the line. The novel attempts to make the argument that the judgments and restrictions of society are worse than the actions of the characters.
-   _The Kharkanas Trilogy_:
    -   Hunn Raal's three cousins Serap, Risp, and Sevegg seem devoted to him, and rumor has it that's because their loyalties are forged beneath the furs. They're second cousins, so it's legal but still raises eyebrows.
    -   Averted with Faror Hend and Spinnock Durav. They're first cousins, and Faror Hend's attraction to Spinnock is so obvious even her commander has to tell her to restrain herself, while Spinnock is completely clueless.
-   _King's Game: Origin_ mentions that cousins Kazunari and Natsuko are in love. In contrast to most examples, they get scorn for their relationship. It's mentioned that cousin incest was legal but socially unacceptable in 1970s Japan.

-   In the _Kushiel's Legacy_ series by Jacqueline Carey, distant royal cousins (his father is her great-grandfather's brother) Imriel and Sidonie fall for each other. Hard. However, their relatives (and the nation at large) aren't so much annoyed at the idea of relatives marrying as they are annoyed that Imriel's mother tried to take over the kingdom (twice, orchestrating an invasion the first time around) and at least some of the populace (mostly the ones still healing the scars from the invasion) thinks Imriel would do the same.

-   In _Mansfield Park_, the main character, Fanny Price, marries her first cousin Edmund Bertram. (The elder Mr. Bertram was concerned about adopting Fanny for this very reason, though his objection was not to incest but to Fanny being of a much lower status than a baronet's son.)
-   In Jorge Isaacs's _María_, the titular María is courted by her second cousin and narrator of the story, Efraín. The family doesn't necessarily approve, but it's less for their blood relation and more because Efraín is about to go study abroad _and_ María is an ill girl who will not live for too long. It ends in tears when Efraín goes to study in London and María dies of her illness when he's still there.

-   _An Observation Log of My Fiancée Who Calls Herself a Villainess_: Joana is the fiancée of Shaun, and formerly Cecil. They're also cousins.
-   A central part of the plot in _One Hundred Years of Solitude_ is the fact that the founders of the Buendía clan were cousins, and therefore they feared the family would sooner or later breed monsters if they ever in-bred from that point on. Despite all efforts, it happens anyway.
-   Anne Elliot in _Persuasion_ is wooed by her cousin (and her older sister wants to marry that same cousin).

-   In _Reborn to Master the Blade_, everyone but Inglis herself (due to being an old man reincarnated into a female body) is all for her marrying her older cousin, Rafael. The most prominent supporter is her younger cousin and Rafael's younger sister, Rafinha, as she wants to stay with Inglis forever and doesn't want anything or anyone tearing them apart. But their fathers are also all for the union, saying that if anyone could get Rafael to consider marriage, it would be Inglis.
-   In the Nero Wolfe novel _The Red Box_, Nero deduces that one of the characters is interested in marrying his cousin. Ultimately, she is revealed as not actually being related.
-   _The Reynard Cycle_: Two of the suggested brides for King Lionel are his cousins by his aunt. No one raises any objections over this.

-   In the King Arthur trilogy that begins with _The Seeing Stone_, the narrator is a medieval teenager (named Arthur) whose family circumstances parallel King Arthur's. He and his first cousin Grace are planning on a betrothal when they find out that Arthur's parents are really his foster parents and that he's actually the son of Grace's father by a peasant woman — so they're half-siblings, not cousins, and any thoughts of marriage have to be dismissed immediately. There's close and then there's _too_ close.
-   In _Sense and Sensibility_, Colonel Brandon's first love was his cousin Eliza Williams. They planned to elope, but his father stopped them and forced Eliza to marry Colonel Brandon's older brother.

-   _Seraphina_: Staying true to the Western European feel of the setting, first cousins Prince Lucian and Princess Glisselda of Goredd are engaged.
-   _The Shadowhunter Chronicles_:
    -   The Lightwoods and Herondales are related through Edmund Herondale, whose daughter Cecily married Gabriel Lightwood. This means that, before meeting Magnus, Alec has been crushing on a distant cousin (Jace), though the latter doesn't reciprocate it.
    -   Kit Herondale's feelings for Ty Blackthorn are also this. Not only do the Blackthorns have the same, unnamed Herondale ancestor that Kit's family is descended from, but one of Kit's ancestors is a woman named Eva Blackthorn, who married Tobias Herondale and started the whole Lost Herondale line.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_:
    -   The most prominent example is Tywin Lannister, who married his cousin Joanna.
    -   Tywin and Joanna's daughter Cersei is also sleeping with her cousin Lancel (her cousin on Tywin's side if you're curious). It becomes a plot point, thanks to how sensitive that information is—though not because he's her cousin, but because she's the king's widow, and how jealous her twincestuous brother is. Yeah, it kinda runs in their family... and has done for centuries: there are two main lines of Lannisters, the ruling family based in Casterly Rock and the cadet, Lannisport branch in charge of the harbour, customs and navy. They crisscross regularly. What? Do you really think the Rock could ever trust another House to run their trade hub?
    -   Ned Stark's parents Rickard and Lyarra were first cousins once removed, Lyarra being the daughter of Rickard's grandfather's brother (her surname was already "Stark" before she was married).
    -   Also found in the Tyrell family: Lord Mace Tyrell's mother is Olenna Redwyne, and Mace's sister Mina Tyrell married Olenna's nephew, Lord Paxter Redwyne—thus Paxter and Mina are first cousins.
    -   Jon Arryn's second wife, Rowena, was a cousin. Like Joanna Lannister and Lyarra Stark, her surname was already "Arryn" before she married.
    -   The Targaryens, due to their obsession with blood purity, would marry their siblings—or cousins if they did not have a sibling to marry. Around the Dance of the Dragons, the Targaryen intermarriages with each other and their relatives the Velaryons make for a very Tangled Family Tree (though maybe less inbred considering Rhaenyra's "Velaryon" children were more likely the result of an affair, though they all died without issue).
        -   Aegon the Conqueror's parents, Aerion Targaryen and Valaena Velaryon were cousins of some variety, as Valaena was herself a Targaryen on her mother's side. This meant that future Targaryen-Velaryon couplings were consanguineous to a degree.
        -   Aenys I, the son of Aegon the Conqueror and his second wife, Rhaenys, married his cousin Alyssa Velaryon due to not having a sister.
        -   Aemon I, the eldest son of King Jaehaerys I, was supposed to marry his older sister, Daenerys, when they came of age, but she died at 7 years old of an illness. While Jaehaerys considered marrying him to Alyssa, another sister, Queen Alysanne pointed out how Alyssa was more interested in her second son Baelon, who was closer to her in age. As such, they had Aemon wed to Jocelyn Baratheon, who was his half-aunt since her mother, the aforementioned Alyssa Velaryon, was also the mother of Jaehaerys and Alysanne. It did help that the two were only a year apart, and fell in love with each other quickly at a feast meant to celebrate Aemon becoming the Prince of Dragonstone (the title given to the heir to the Iron Throne). They married and had one daughter, Rhaenys, who would wed her second cousin Corlys Velaryon and whose bloodline would run through House Velaryon via her granddaughter Baela.
        -   Viserys I married Aemma Arryn, his first cousin. Aemma's mother, Daella, was another one of Jaehaerys I's daughters, and thus a sister of Baelon and Alyssa, Viserys' parents. After Aemma died, he was nearly wed to Laena Velaryon, his cousin Rhaenys' daughter, but balked at her being a little girl at the time, and decided to marry Alicent Hightower instead. After she came of age, Laena married Viserys' brother, Daemon.
        -   Viserys I's daughter Rhaenyra married her second cousin Laenor Velaryon (brother of the aforementioned Laena Velaryon). After Laenor died, she married her uncle Daemon and had three children with him, including Viserys II, from whom the current generation of Targaryens are descended.
        -   Following the Dance, Aegon III was married off to his cousin Jaehaera (daughter of Aegon II and Helaena, his mother Rhaenyra's half-siblings/his father Daemon's nephew and niece) to unite the Black and Green camps, though she died without issue. He then married Daenaera Velaryon, who was his fourth cousin once removed/fifth cousin.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
        -   Baela Targaryen, Daemon and Laena's daughter, married Alyn Velaryon, who was ostensibly her first cousin as the bastard son of Laenor. Since Laenor was gay, however, it's likely that Alyn was actually fathered by Laenor's father, Corlys, making him Baela's uncle. Alyn also had an affair with Elaena Targaryen, Aegon III's daughter with Daenaera Velaryon. Daenaera's great-grandfather was Corlys' brother, making Elaena and Alyn second cousins twice removed or first cousins three times removed, depending on who you ask.
        -   Aegon IV and his first cousin Daena (his father, Viserys II, and her father, Aegon III, were brothers) had an affair and conceived Daemon Waters, later christened Blackfyre, the instigator of the titular Blackfyre Rebellions. One of Daemon's daughters, Calla, later married her uncle Aegor Rivers, Aegon IV's son with Barba Bracken.
        -   Aerys I was betrothed to his cousin Aelinor Penrose, though he showed no interest in her (or anyone else, really), preferring the company of books instead.
        -   Aerion Targaryen, son of Maekar I, married his first cousin Daenora, daughter of Maekar's older brother Rhaegel.
        -   Because the Baratheons are descended from Aegon the Conqueror's bastard half-brother, the bride and groom in any Targaryen-Baratheon marriage will at the very least be distant cousins. Aside from Aemon and Jocelyn, this was the case with King Robert's grandparents Ormund Baratheon and Rhaelle Targaryen, whose betrothal was arranged after Rhaelle's brother Duncan declined to marry the daughter of Lyonel Baratheon.
        -   Rhaegel Targaryen's marriage to Alys Arryn was the third Targaryen-Arryn coupling in history, following Viserys I and Aemma Arryn (Rhaegel's great-great-great-grandparents), and Daella Targaryen and Rodrik Arryn (Aemma's parents).
        -   Rhaegar Targaryen's marriage to Elia Martell was the third such union in history, following the Double In-Law Marriage between Daeron II and Myriah Martell (Rhaegar's ancestors) and Myriah's brother Maron and Daeron's sister Daenerys (Elia's ancestors). Elia's brother Doran later reveals that he planned to wed his daughter, Arianne, to Rhaegar's brother, Viserys, which would be the fourth union, and, when that failed, sent his son Quentyn to woo Rhaegar's and Viserys' sister, Daenerys (which also didn't work).
    -   Lord Wyman Manderly at one point suggests he or his second son Ser Wylis marry his cousin Lady Donella Hornwood, partially hoping to get her lands for sure, but also as an attempt to protect her because taking care of your own is something House Manderly actually cares about. House Bolton is, as a result, directly in their crosshairs thanks to how terribly Ramsay treated Donella when he forced her to marry him — then "let" her die alone.
    -   Implied with Arianne Martell and her cousins, the Sand Snakes. Arianne offers to fight any other woman who is sleeping with her lover unless they are a Sand Snake, for she "loves her cousins well". She and a cousin also tried to "share" their first partner, but it didn't quite pan out.

-   In _Spoonbenders_, Matty has an uncomfortable sexual attraction towards his older cousin Mary Alice, having activated his psychic abilities — Astral Projection — accidentally while spying on her and her friend from the closet. They aren't related by blood, but it's still pretty euwy.
-   _Sword Art Online_ has a complicated case. Suguha Kirigaya wrestled with feelings for her older brother Kazuto, then when he became trapped in a VR game, her mother revealed that he was actually her cousin, adopted as an infant after his own family died in a traffic accident—him discovering that fact on his own led to him distancing himself from his adopted family. Suguha was overjoyed when Kazuto finally came out of his coma, less so when he revealed he'd found a girlfriend while stuck in the video game, since Suguha knew that her feelings for him were unhealthy and unrequited, she tried to find a safer target for her affections, like this "Kirito" guy she met online one night in another VR game. _Then_ Suguha found out Kirito and Kazuto were one and the same, meaning she'd fallen in love with her cousin twice over, which resulted in a brief Heroic BSoD. Most of this aside from the Surprise Incest at the end is omitted from the anime adaptation.
-   In _The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies_ Flopsy Rabbit is married to her cousin Benjamin Bunny.
-   In _A Tangled Web (1931)_ by L. M. Montgomery, the Dark and Penhallow families have intermarried almost exclusively, to the point that during the time period the book takes place, pretty much all the marriages and relationships shown are between cousins.
-   Camille and Thérèse in _Thérèse Raquin_, though their marriage didn't involve much if any, sexual activity.
-   German novel _The Tin Drum_ has Agnes and Jan Bronski. It is left to speculation on whether the main character Oskar is Jan's son or Agnes's husband Alfred. Agnes's second child is definitely from Jan and she kills herself because of realizing that.
-   _Tolkien's Legendarium_:
    -   _The Fall of Gondolin_: The Elf Maeglin was in love with his first cousin Idril Celebrindal, who is squicked by this, for "the Eldar wedded not with kin so near, nor ever before had any desired to do so."
    -   _The Silmarillion_: Ar-Pharazôn, the last King of Númenor, married his first cousin, Tar-Míriel, against her will. It is claimed Numenorean laws prohibited any marriage closer than second cousins.
    -   _The Fall of Númenor_: Queen Ancalimë and her husband Hallacar are distant cousins, sharing a great-great-grandfather (Vardamir, second King of Númenor). Though, their marriage was mostly political, and their relationship was pretty toxic.
    -   _The Lord of the Rings_:
        -   Aragorn and Arwen are first cousins sixty-seven and seventy-four times removed, as Arwen's uncle also happens to be an ancestor of Aragorn's many, many generations up the tree. Here's a family tree to help you keep it all straight.
        -   Galadriel and Celeborn are second cousins — Galadriel's maternal grandfather and Celeborn's paternal grandfather were brothers.
        -   Sam Gamgee and his wife Rosie Cotton are third cousins. Sam's great-grandmother Rowan was the older sister of Rosie's great-grandmother Rose.
    -   Merry Brandybuck's parents Saradoc and Esmeralda are second cousins. Saradoc's grandmother Mirabella and Esmeralda's grandfather Hildigrim were siblings (both children of Gerontius Took and Adamanta Chubb). Merry marries his third cousin Estella Bolger, who is the great-granddaughter of Hildibrand Took, another of Gerontius and Adamanta's many children.
    -   Frodo's parents, Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck, are cousins by marriage, making them both cousins with Bilbo and therefore making Frodo Bilbo's cousin twice over, as old Gaffer Gamgee explains:
        
        **The Gaffer:** Mr. Drogo married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. She was our Mr. Bilbo's first cousin on the mother's side (her mother being the youngest of the Old Took's daughters); and Mr. Drogo was his second cousin. So Mr. Frodo is his first and second cousin, once removed either way, as the saying is, if you follow me.
        
-   Agatha Christie's Tommy and Tuppence book, _The Secret Adversary_, features Julius Hersheimmer, a millionaire looking for his missing cousin Jane Finn. While he's never met her since his father disowned his sister (Julius' aunt and Jane's mother), he has her picture and falls in love with her. By the end of the book, Jane has been rescued and fallen for Julius in turn.
-   _The Villainous Daughter's Butler, I'll Crush the Destruction Flags_: This is Princess Fol's dynamic with her cousin Prince Lancelot in the Expansion Pack of the game Cyril was reincarnated into. In the current reality, Lancelot drives away her suitors because he thinks they’re not good enough for her.
-   _Wagons West_: In one book it is said that Toby and Alexandra are first cousins thrice removed, but considering the known relatives and the age of Alex's father it is likely the author meant third cousins. The only problem anyone has with the relationship is the age difference.
-   _War and Peace_ has this combined with Not Blood Siblings. Sonya is attracted to her cousin Nikolai, who was raised as her brother. Natasha, who is at the time a child, assures her that they can still get married since Nikolai is only her _second_ cousin. As young adults, Sonya and Nikolai get engaged, but Nikolai later breaks it off (with Sonya's consent) after he falls in love with Princess Marya. When they in turn get married, Sonya acts as an Honorary Aunt to their children.
-   In _Warrior Cats_, seeing as they're semi-realistic cats, and they live in Clans that don't allow intermixing, this is kind of inevitable, and there are several such relationships like this:
    -   Squirrelflight and her mate Brambleclaw are second cousins.
    -   Hawkwing and Pebbleshine are cousins.
    -   Lilyheart and Snowbush are cousins.
-   Rand al'Thor is worried about this when he considers courting the Andoran Daughter-Heir Elayne Trakand in _The Wheel of Time_ after he learns that he is descended from Andoran royalty on his mother's side, making them distant cousins. He is reassured after an expert on genealogy informs him that if they were both commoners, they wouldn't be considered related.
-   Even besides the Not Blood Siblings romance in _Wuthering Heights_, there are, not coincidentally, two subsequent cousin-cousin relationships.
-   _The Year I Met You_: Downplayed and ultimately subverted. Jasmine's cousin Kevin, when they are 17 and he's just found out that he's adopted (thus not Jasmine's cousin biologically), tells her he's in love with her and kisses her. He reasons they aren't cousins because they're not genetically related, but Jasmine has known him her entire life as her cousin, and is horrified. But he's still in love with, and pursuing her, 13 years later.
    
    **Matt:** _\[Asking about Kevin\]_ Boyfriend?
    
    **Jasmine:** God, no. \[But\] wants to be.
    
    **Matt:** And you don't.
    
    **Jasmine:** No.
    
    **Matt:** Seems like a nice guy.
    
    **Jasmine:** He's my cousin.
    
    **Matt:** _\[Eyes widening\]_ Jesus.
    
    **Jasmine:** He was adopted.
    
    **Matt:** Oh.
    
    **Jasmine:** Still. It is and will always be disgusting to me.
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   _30 Rock_ has this when Liz Lemon meets a guy that seems perfect for her. At least, until they go back to his place and she notices a picture of her great aunt. They do the math and figure they are third cousins (i.e. sharing a great-great-grandparent). There's a discussion on how closely related they could be without it being creepy. He says fifth cousins. She says _never_.
-   In a _3rd Rock from the Sun_ episode, the aliens went to the family reunion of a family with the last name "Solomon", pretending to be long-lost relatives. Tommy fell in love with his "cousin" and Hilarity Ensued.
-   _Arrested Development_ had a recurring storyline about George-Michael's crush on his cousin Maeby, who are revealed to be first cousins by adoption, then later revealed to be second cousins once removed by blood). Furthermore, when these feelings become mutual, Maeby tries to hide from them by dating a boy from her school, who turns out to _also_ be her cousin. ( Though also first cousins by adoption, then revealed as second cousins once removed by blood.) This was mirrored in two storylines in the final season. The first saw Michael Bluth (played by Jason Bateman) thinking that a prostitute was his long-lost sister and hiring her to work at the company; she thought this was a _Pretty Woman_ situation and started coming on to him. (The prostitute was played by Justine Bateman, who is Jason Bateman's real-life sister.) Then, in the third season finale it was revealed that Lindsay was adopted and was not actually Michael's biological sister. Upon finding out, she decided to act on a crush she had had for years. Then in the fifth season finale it was revealed that Lindsay is Lucille's half-sister. Additionally, Michael ended up going out with a woman who, unbeknownst to him, suffered from mental retardation as a result of her parents being cousins. It was a lot funnier and less creepy than this sounds.
-   In _The Big Bang Theory_, Howard, while high from marijuana use (It Makes Sense in Context), admits he lost his virginity to his cousin Jeannie at his uncle's funeral. This admission ends up coming back to bite him at the end of the episode in the form of a Mundane Ghost Story. Later, he is quick to point out that she was his _second_ cousin.
-   On _Bridezillas_, one 'Zilla of the week was a young woman named Sparkela who was engaged to a man _much_ older than she was. Against her wishes, her maid of honor got a stripper for her bachelorette party (the only male stripper in town), who happened to be Sparkela's cousin. Naturally, she tried to resist, but ended up being Forced to Watch her cousin dance for her in a gold singlet and sneakers.
-   Relatively common in Hispanic Soap Operas. During Venezuelan soap _Carita Pintada_'s pre-premiering the author claimed that the main couple could achieve a happy ending with a white wedding and all because they were _only_ third or second cousins, coincidentally the closest blood relation allowed to marry according to actual laws. For the most (emphasis there) part in Latin America, people consider cousin relationships to be too incestuous only if they are first cousins; second cousins and onward are not subject to this taboo.
-   In _Chouriki Sentai Ohranger_, Kaiser Buldont and Princess Multiwa wed in episode 41 and have a child near the end. It's okay because they're robots.
-   The next to last episode of _Community_ takes place at Garrett's wedding. It isn't until the reception and Jeff's toast that it's discovered Garrett's great-aunt is his bride's grandmother.
    
    **Elroy:** Now, this is a man that knows how to marry his cousin!
    
-   This is not uncommon in Soap Operas in general, given the frequency of "true parentage is revealed" storylines that can make previous non-relatives with crushes on each other into cousins. For example, Cassie DiMera and Shawn Brady on _Days of Our Lives_. Then there are people who skirt the edges of this trope by dating their half-siblings' cousins on the other side...
-   In the _Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23_ season 2 episode "Original Bitch...", Mark tells June that he left a voicemail on her answering machine. June tells him she didn't get the voicemail because Chloe wouldn't give her the code. The conversation afterwards:
    
    **June:** She \[Chloe\] won't tell me anything she cares about!  
    **Mark:** She might just be a private person. I mean, I was like that when we first met.  
    **June:** The first day we worked together, you told me you boned down on your cousin 'cause you didn't want to go to college a virgin.
    
-   _Downton Abbey_: A major plot point is that the Earl of Grantham is without a son. Thanks to Heir Club for Men, his heir must be a distant male-line relative rather than one of his three daughters. The whole family wants Mary—his eldest daughter—to be the heir, but the law doesn't allow it. So if she could marry the heir, it could be an easy solution.
    -   Before the show begins, Mary was betrothed—though it's a very half-hearted engagement—to the heir, Patrick, who's her second cousin. Before they can be married, he dies in the _Titanic_ sinking.
    -   While Mary only agreed to marry Patrick half-heartedly, it's implied Mary's younger sister Edith was actually super into him, and would've married him very happily if given the chance.
    -   After Patrick's death, an even more distant cousin, Matthew, is brought in as the next heir. Mary ends up _actually_ falling in love with _him_, and they marry. They're fourth cousins.
-   In the HBO series _Dream On_, Martin and his cousin (played by Helen Slater) briefly undergo a bout of frustrated desire for each other, which only dies when they notice, when they finally get the time and privacy to indulge themselves, that their feet are too similar.
-   Made mention of at least once in _The Dukes of Hazzard_:
    
    **Bo Duke:** Daisy Duke, if you wasn't my cousin, I'd marry you!  
    **Daisy Duke:** Never stopped anybody in this family before.
    
-   _Dynasty_: Fallon Carrington and Jeff Colby start up a relationship that ends midway through season 1. Near the end of the season, Alexis Carrington reveals that the mother of him and his sister is the daughter of Thomas Carrington (Fallon's grandfather) making them first cousins. A minor Running Gag, at least in season 2, is to bring this up despite neither knew of their connection until months after the relationship ended.
-   The _Frasier_ episode "Beware of Greeks" features a very one-sided version between Niles and Cousin Yvonne, who apparently makes a beeline for him whenever they're at a family gathering.
    
    **Frasier:** A distant cousin who has a slight crush on Niles.  
    **Niles:** "A slight crush?" There are _cannibals_ who are less man-hungry.
    
    -   In another episode Woody from _Cheers_ makes a visit to Seattle to attend a wedding where both bride and groom are his cousins, and by extension cousins to each other.
        
        **Niles:** I assume they're kissing cousins?  
        **Woody:** Oh, they're doing a lot more than that. That's why they have to get married.
        
-   In an episode of _Friends_, Ross and Monica's female cousin comes to visit for the wedding, and ends up staying at Ross' apartment.

-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   In Season 2, while Jaime is captured by the Starks, Cersei ends up sleeping with her cousin Lancel. While cousin relationships are not uncommon in Westeros, the part that's disturbing is that he's a Replacement Goldfish for Jaime, who is her twin and the great love of her life.
    -   Like in the books, Tywin Lannister married his cousin Joanna, who died giving birth to Tyrion. The practical result is that her surname was already "Lannister" even before she married Tywin. In part, this also informs how much of a hypocrite Tywin is. He plans to force all three of his children to marry against their will to secure political alliances, demanding that they put the good of the family above their own personal happiness. Problem is, Tywin _himself_ married for love—and not strategically, since marrying a first cousin meant he _didn't_ secure a marriage alliance with another powerful Great House.
    -   Sansa's maternal aunt, Lysa Arryn tells her right after accusing her of sleeping with Littlefinger, that she can marry her son, Robin.
    -   Daenerys is actually Jon's biological aunt, but the two are the same age so when they get together it's similar to this. Things are further complicated by the fact that neither knew about their blood relationship at the time. When Jon finds out, he's disturbed and conflicted by the fact. He reveals their relationship to Daenerys, but she's less concerned about the incest than the fact that Jon has a better claim to the Iron Throne than her. Jon's father Rhaegar (Daenerys's much older brother) was the heir to the throne, and any of his legitimate children would come before her in the line of succession, thus threatening Daenerys's claim. Understandably, she's a bit suspicious regarding Jon's revelation as a result.
-   After _General Hospital_'s Alexis tries to sabotage her cousin Stefan's relationship with Katherine, Katherine accuses her of being in love with him, citing the history of Royal Inbreeding. This is actually not the case; Alexis is just carrying on the family tradition of interfering in their loved ones relationships because they don't think that their significant other is good enough for them.
-   On _The George Lopez Show_, Max gets a major crush on his attractive cousin Veronica. George made jokes about their mutant offspring (since Max by himself is already dyslexic) to discourage that. Veronica milks him for all he's worth by having him do all her chores.

-   _The Glamorous Imperial Concubine_: Du Wan and Meng Qi Xing are cousins. That doesn't stop Wan wanting to marry Qi Xing, though she doesn't actually love him and only wants to marry him for his title. And when it looks like he'll marry Fu Ya instead, Wan sleeps with him while he's drunk and makes sure his mother walks in on them the next morning to force the marriage.
-   Jonathan and Tammy were a popular couple on _Guiding Light_. However, the first time they slept together Tammy had no idea they were cousins and Jonathan was using her for revenge on his mother. When she did find out, she was angry at him for a long time. (About a couple weeks.)

    **Shirley:** We're cousins!  
    **Coop:** Well, from all the lotions, condoms and devices I saw sitting on your nightstand it's clear you're sleeping with somebody.  
    **Dupree:** ...Well it's not like we're _first_ cousins or anything.
    
-   Wayne and Daryl from _Letterkenny_ try to avert this, though they mention coming close a few times.

-   _Mohawk Girls_: Bailey is initially dating Thunder in the pilot. She stops, freaking out after learning he's her second cousin.
-   _The Nanny_ had an episode titled "Kissing Cousins" where Fran starts to date a Jewish doctor Bob (played by Jon Stewart) who she thinks is perfect for her. They then meet up at a wedding in their temple, where Fran's mom declares, "Oh, let me get a picture of you and your cousin!" This makes them squick and they stop dating; however, it is mentioned again in later episodes.
-   In Season 6 of _New Girl_, Jess begins a relationship with Cece’s one-time boyfriend, Robbie. They date for about half the season, until Episode 14, “The Hike”.

Quickly, this goes awry as they realize they both have stories involving the same family reunion, and they figure out that they’re third cousins. Needless to say, they're both very relieved they never did anything more than kissing.
-   _Night and Day_'s Tom Brake and Della Wells go much further than kissing, without realising at the time that they're biological cousins.
-   _Riverdale_: The big twist in season 1 is that Polly Cooper and Jason Blossom, the Star-Crossed Lovers, are third cousins.

Not only is Vito a closeted gay man, but Adriana is also his first cousin; Richie Aprile is both Vito's and Adriana's uncle. Perhaps a result of the writers simply forgetting who was related to who.
-   _That '70s Show_ had an early episode titled "Eric's Hot Cousin", where said tattle-tale Floridian cousin does not look like the last time she visited. She blatantly flirts, causing conflicted feelings in Eric. It turns out to be a trick to get him in trouble as revenge for the last time they butted heads.
    
    **Red:** Eric, do I really have to tell you to stop staring at your cousin?  
    **Eric:** _\[snapping out of his male gaze\]_ What?  
    **Red:** Stop staring at your cousin!
    
-   In _Three Up Two Down_, Daphne's ex-husband Jeremy is also her cousin.

    **Boy:** She's my cousin, why?  
    **Marc:** She's your cousin!? Are you cousins? I didn't know that! Wow! I have something I want to say but this will put us off the air!
    
-   _The White Queen_: As in Real Life, the marriages of George of Clarence and Isabel Neville, and later Richard of Gloucester and Anne Neville, are of first cousins once removed. Cecily Neville, the mother of George and Richard, is thus both the mother-in-law and paternal great-aunt of Isabel and Anne.

    Music 

-   The second verse of Weird Al's Avril Lavigne parody "A Complicated Song" starts with the protagonist singing about how great his girlfriend is, how their personalities are so similar, and how he was thinking about asking her to marry him. The two of them are passionately making out one night, but then...
    
    Who would have guessed?  
    Her family crest  
    I'd suddenly spy  
    Tattooed on her thigh  
    And son of a gun  
    It's just like the one on me...
    
-   Second cousin, why are you so fine?
-   Elvis Presley's song "Kissing Cousins" from the movie of the same name.
-   "Cousin Dupree" by Steely Dan, where the title character hits on his sexy cousin Janine and promptly receives a thorough dressing-down for being creepy and incestuous... _which doesn't bother him at all._
    
    _Well, we used to play since we were three / How about a kiss for your Cousin Dupree?_
    
-   Corb Lund's "Family Reunion" has a line that goes like this: "Cuz one of them I think I mighta dated back in school/ That's alright, in Alberta that's cool".
-   Moosebutter has a pastiche of "On My Own" from _Les Misérables_ called "Jon Boy Jon" about a redneck who is in love with his first cousin.
-   The eponymous Brenda in "Brenda's Got a Baby" by Tupac Shakur got involved at the age of 12 with her 20-something cousin and conceived a child, and her parents were too wrapped up in themselves and their drug addictions to care. Her boyfriend/cousin leaves her sometime during the pregnancy, and everything goes to (even further) crap from there. Brenda is thrown out of the house by her mother shortly after she gives birth, and Brenda is ultimately driven to prostitution to support herself (now probably about 13 or 14) and her baby, and eventually killed, presumably by one of her clients.

    Poetry 

-   Alfred, Lord Tennyson:
    -   _Locksley Hall_, Amy, who loved and then left the narrator, is his cousin.
    -   An interesting twist is found in _Lady Clare_. The titular earl's daughter is engaged to her cousin, Lord Ronald, much to the delight of her nursemaid… who promptly reveals that Clare is actually her own daughter, whom she substituted for the real Lady Clare, who died in infancy. Ronald, as the next male-line heir, ought to be inheriting everything that Clare's father left to her. Clare, horrified that Ronald would be "kept from his due" and married to a peasant, leaves the castle only to run into a bewildered Ronald. She explains everything, and he shrugs it off and says they'll marry anyway, "and you will still be Lady Clare."

    Religion and Mythology 

-   The Bible:
    -   In The Book of Tobit, it's not clear exactly how closely Tobias and Sarah are related, but their marriage is not only allowed but considered obligatory.
        
        _Eat and drink and be merry tonight, for no man is more entitled to marry my daughter Sarah than you, brother. Besides, not even I have the right to give her to anyone but you, because you are my closest relative._
        
    -   Due to the nomadic, tribal lifestyles of the ancient Israelites, this is true throughout the Bible. Abraham sent a servant to find a wife for his son Isaac _specifically_ from among his kin, rather than from among the Canaanites, and he returned with Abraham's great-niece Rebekah. Then Isaac's son Jacob married TWO of his cousins, the sisters Rachel and Leah, and also fathered children by their handmaidens.
    -   Also, because in the list of relatives and other people an Israelite man is not allowed to have sexual relations with, "cousin" is conspicuously absent.
-   Classical Mythology:
    -   Heracles and Iphicles' mortal parents were cousins. Their father Amphitryon was the son of Perseus and Andromeda's son Alcaeus and their mother Alcmene was the daughter of Perseus and Andromeda's son Electryon.
    -   The sisters Helen and Clytemnestra of Sparta married the brothers Menelaus and Agamemnon of Mycenae. The resulting children were double first cousins, and two of them—Helen and Menelaus's daughter Hermione and Clytemnestra and Agamemnon's son Orestes—were eventually married in turn.
    -   Happens all the time among the gods, because well, there's not all that many gods. They're pretty much all cousins if not even closer relatives, so all of the relationships are incestuous on one level or another.
-   In Islam:
    -   One verse in The Qur'an (4:23) describes in detail which relatives men are forbidden to marry: mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, nieces, foster mothers, foster sisters, mothers-in-law, daughters-in-law, and stepdaughters unless the men haven't had sex with their mothers. Note that cousins are not mentioned, hence why cousin marriage is permissable in Islam.
    -   Muhammad's paternal first cousin Ali was also his son-in-law, because he married Muhammad's daughter Fatimah (i.e. his first cousin once removed).
    -   Muhammad's seventh wife, Zaynab bint Jahsh, was his paternal first cousin.

    Theatre 

-   In _Antigone_, the eponymous character is engaged to her cousin Haemon. Haemon's father Creon and Antigone's mother Jocasta are brother and sister. It's worth mentioning that he is also her first cousin once removed since Antigone's father is a son of Jocasta's. Coming from that family, marrying a cousin must've seemed positively conservative. It's also a reference to the Classical Athens law that dictated that brotherless single female heirs would marry a close relative (usually a cousin or an uncle) in order to keep inheritance within the family.

-   Subverted in _August: Osage County_. Ivy is in a relationship with her cousin Little Charles, which is already considered pretty bad by the others. Then it's revealed that Little Charles is actually the biological son of Beverly, Ivy's father, making the two half-siblings as well.
-   In _Brighton Beach Memoirs_, Eugene has somewhat of a crush on his cousin Nora. However, it's not romantic so much as that he's entering puberty and there's a beautiful girl in the house. His older brother Stanley has a similar attraction to her.
-   In 1879, Cyrano and Roxanne from _Cyrano de Bergerac_ are cousins. Although they don't actually end up together, their familial connection is never presented as squicky or an obstacle in their relationship. Given Catholic rules on consanguinity, this probably means 'cousin' was more a courtesy than genetic relationship.
-   _Elisabeth_: like in Real Life, Franz Joseph is expected to marry his cousin Helene, only to fall in love with Helene's sister Elisabeth. It's mentioned that they're cousins, but that isn't treated as the reason their marriage ended as badly as it did.
-   Monty and Phoebe in _A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder_. They're not too closely related though and they didn't meet until they were adults.
-   At the end of _The Importance of Being Earnest_, The Reveal that frees Jack/Ernest to marry Gwendolen also makes them first cousins. This isn't specifically addressed, but he does start referring to her mother as his aunt, so at least they're aware of it; Gwendolen's mother is rather chagrined to realize that, as Jack is the son of her own beloved sister, she really _can't_ object to the marriage.
-   Tybalt in _Romeo et Juliette: De La Haine a l'Amour_ (though not the play it's based on) _wishes_ this was the case with him and Juliet. In most productions anyway. In Hungary it's less "he wishes his cousin returned his romantic love for her" and more "he's so obsessed with her that he thinks _all_ men, including _himself_, are unworthy of her". There's still some weirdness going on there, though.

    Video Games 

-   Crawford Starrick and Pearl Attaway are cousins as well as business partners and members of the Templar Order in _Assassin's Creed Syndicate_. Dialogue between them indicates they have a long history together; having apparently been childhood sweethearts, Crawford once asked Pearl to marry him and was deeply disappointed when she refused his proposal, as well as being clearly grief-stricken after she is assassinated by Jacob Frye (as one of his minions unfortunately learns).
-   _BlazBlue_: While there are no examples given, the Yayoi family (Tsubaki's family) practices this; they are so obsessed with blood purity that marrying in the family is _the only choice they get_. This has led to the family being Royally Screwed Up; Tsubaki's the only surviving heir to the family.
-   In _Bully_, the Preppies are the kids of a bunch of inbred rich people. When Gary gets them to attack you with his old trick of insulting them and saying you did it, the "inbred" insult is met with indignation and the phrase "And first cousins is legal anyway!"
-   Generally unavoidable in _Crusader Kings_ if you want to keep a marriage alliance alive for more than one generation. The game notably doesn't track any relationship closer than first cousins: relatives any more distant than that are grouped as "kinsmen".
-   _Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls_: One of the characters targeted by the Warriors of Hope is Kanon Nakajima, Leon Kuwata's cousin who had an unhealthy romantic interest in him which went completely unreciprocated.
-   An ill-fated romance between two forms part of the plot of the adventure game _The Dark Eye_.
-   Dorian Pavus and a human Inquisitor in _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ are distantly related. Dorian brings this up at one point, and if a male Inquisitor is engaged in a romance with him he has the option of asking whether it's okay to continue flirting or not. Dorian's fine with it, as it's _very_ distant (three whole Ages, if he's being literal).
-   In _The Elder Scrolls_ series, the Altmer (High Elves) have a very endogamous society, believing that they can trace their ancestry back through the Aldmer, to the Ehlnofey, and through them, even to the et'Ada who created the mortal world. As such, they intermarry and heavily restrict visitors to their homeland to keep their genetics pure, to the point where they even cull children with "undesirable" traits. While their pure bloodline gives them highest natural magical aptitude of any race, it is theorized that the innate _weakness_ to magicka they suffer is a result of this inbreeding.
-   Though nothing ever comes of it, Brother in _Final Fantasy X-2_ has a noticeable (and one-sided) crush on Yuna. Brother's father and Yuna's mother were siblings.
-   As an extension for its love of the sibling version _Fire Emblem_ has plenty of this:
    -   Several preexisting relationships in _Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War_'s 2nd generation take on this form, and by selective pairing of characters in the first generation it is possible to make a vast number of such pairings. Two particularly noteworthy examples in the second generation are the predestined couples of Lana/Faval and Lester/Patty. Because their mothers Aideen and Briggid were identical twins, Intelligent Systems pulled off the impressive feat of doing this and Brother–Sister Incest at the same time.
    -   It is possible to make Roy and Lilina from _Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade_ cousins... by pairing Eliwood with the Pegasus Knight Fiora and Hector with either of Fiora's youngest sisters Florina or Farina in prequel _Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade_. Since _The Blazing Blade_ was not released yet at the time of _The Binding Blade_'s own release (and the pairings involved exist among other possible pairings), the latter never makes any mention of this possibility.
    -   _Fire Emblem: Awakening_ uses a love system very similar to that of _Genealogy of the Holy War_. Either Lucina or a Chrom-fathered Cynthia or Kjelle can potentially marry their paternal cross-cousin Owain while other cousin pairings can be set up with certain combinations of parents. The international release has the status screens of such a pairing Bowdlerised to read "Companion" instead of husband/wife, though. A female Morgan mothered by Lissa or Emmeryn can also marry her cousin Inigo or Brady.
    -   _Fire Emblem Fates_ allows the players to do something similar to _Fire Emblem: Awakening_ if they have the children of siblings marry. There are also two "set" pairs of cousins in the game, one of which can avert this or not, one of which plays it straight.
        -   The first set are Asugi, the son of the Ninja Saizo, and Midori, the daughter of Saizo's younger brother Kaze. _However_, while they can reach an S-support, in the localization it ends with them as Just Friends, making them either an aversion or a straight example depending on the version itself.
        -   The second set are the Male Avatar and his Implied Love Interest Azura—their mothers Mikoto and Arete were sisters. The twist is they _don't know_ they're cousins, and they don't find out until quite late in the Golden Path—a mere 3 chapters from Final Boss which is more than late enough for the player to easily have S-supported Corrin and Azura (and note, _only_ the Golden Path, meaning in the other two they never find out). Even after they learn the truth, though, their S-support is explicitly romantic, making them the straight example. Of course, if _they_ don't marry each other, it's possible for their respective _children_, who would be second cousins, to marry each other. And if the Avatar marries any of Azura's children, he/she'll end up marrying his/her first cousin once removed.
        -   It's also possible to pull off other couples like this depending on how the player pairs up the royal sisters. If Hinoka, Sakura, Camilla, or Elise marry any of the men who have daughters, the player can then hook these second-gen girls up with Shiro or Kiragi (for Hinoka and Sakura), or Siegbert or Forrest (for Camilla and Elise). For example, a Caeldori mothered by Hinoka is still perfectly capable of marrying her cousin Shiro.
-   In _Jade Empire_, it's revealed that Dawn Star is the long-lost daughter of Sun Li, the brother of the Emperor. As a result, if a male protagonist forms a ménage à trois with the Princess Silk Fox and Dawn Star, the two ladies are in this kind of relationship.
-   It's only seen in the background novel _The Masked Empire_, but Grand Duke Gaspard attempted to invoke this trope with his cousin, Empress Celene, as a last-ditch effort to take the throne of Orlais peacefully. When she refused him, he declared war, which is going on at the time of the game. In turn, Celene's immediate predecessor, Florian, was rumored to be romantically involved with his cousin Meghran, which is why the latter was assigned as Ferelden's regent before King Maric overthrew him. Only the part about Florian and Meghran being cousins was considered scandelous; no one cared that they were both men.
-   In _Matches and Matrimony_, this is one of the nine paths which the player character can take, if she accepts (or is too weak-willed to refuse) the proposal of her cousin Mr. Collins.
-   It should be noted that in _The Sims 2_ and _The Sims 3_, the game does not even allow the option for first cousins to be married. (A certain cheat will allow them to have offspring if the player so chooses). However, more distantly related Sims have the ability to seek romantic interactions with one another (probably because the family tree in the game does not recognize first cousins once removed and beyond, or great-grandparents for that matter).
-   _Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous_: One room in Areelu's Laboratory briefly entraps the party members in illusions of their deep desires. Much to Daeran's annoyance, his consists of a sexual fantasy of himself with his cousin Queen Galfrey. He irritatedly explains to the Player Character that it was just a childhood Precocious Crush that he never seriously pursued: as much of a hedonist as he is, as an adult he doesn't particularly like her.
-   At the end of _Persona 4_, The Protagonist's little cousin Nanako tells him that she wants to marry him when she grows up, and apparently won't take "no" for an answer. If the player didn't max the link, her father won't allow it. If it's done, Dojima's gonna hold the Protagonist to it.
-   Bart and Margie of _Xenogears_ are first cousins and engaged for various political/dynastic reasons. Although Bart rescues her from kidnappers at one point and they do have genuine affection for each other, neither one seems to be very enthusiastic about the prospect of marriage.

    Visual Novels 

-   One of the routes in the _Aoi Shiro_ pairs the main character up with her cousin Kaya. Demon Vampire Lesbian Kissing Cousins?

-   Saki from _Snow Sakura_ is a slight deconstruction. She and her cousin Yuugi fall in love but their school's vice-principal decides to butt in because their relationship isn't socially accepted. This causes drama as the two are forced to be apart. It helps that the vice-principal is depicted as a Jerkass strawman while the pairing is supported by an American teacher and their parents.
-   _Sono Hanabira Ni Kuchizuke Wo_: Sara and Kaede; they (at time of writing) supply the Trope Image for Yuri Genre.
-   Miyuki Takamachi of _Triangle Heart 3: Sweet Songs Forever_. Both her status as Kyouya's cousin and potential love interest may or may not still be present in _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha_, as one shot in the first season showed signs of her getting jealous when she heard that Kyouya was going to visit his girlfriend, Shinobu.
-   The entire Nanaya clan from _Tsukihime_, with the exception of Shiki due to his situation. They only breed within the clan to sustain and increase the psychic power within their bloodline.
-   While he's joking for the most part, _Umineko: When They Cry_'s Battler Ushiromiya is not averse to playing grab-ass with his first cousin Jessica. As for more serious cousin-cousin relationships, the second half of the story reveals that Sayo Yasuda (who is implied and later confirmed to be Shannon, Kanon, _and_ Beatrice) is involved with as many as _three_ of his/her cousins. Who are also his/her niece/nephews (since Kinzō is both Sayo's father _and_ grandfather). As it turns out, this is a large part of Sayo's issues, since finding out that s/he's actually related to his/her love interests makes him/her think of him/herself as disgusting and no better than Kinzo.
-   Sayaka from _Yoake Mae Yori Ruriiro Na_, although the protagonist treats her like and refers to her as his sister.

    Webcomics 

-   _Between Failures_ offers a rather touching scene in which Reggie, not generally the most likable character in the cast, tells the story of “his first time” for a club initiation. The occasion proves to be a family wedding, the girl a cousin; his story is discreet to the point of allusion, and he dismisses accusations of “lack of detail” with an aloof put-down.

-   Referred to in _Dead Days_. Brown-hair claimed he knew everything, so Blondie tested him out. Brown then stated Blondie's first kiss was with a cousin at a family reunion. His name was Steve.
-   Tedd of _El Goonish Shive_ averts this trope, being almost allergic to the idea of his "ugly cousin" Nanase as a sexual being _at all_. (Said cousin is, of course, scorchingly hot actually, as Tedd admits much later.)
-   Spoofed in _Hark! A Vagrant_: Edward the Black Prince wishes to marry his cousin, but is unable because he needs to make an advantageous marriage. His father, Edward III, notes that it's natural to want to marry one's cousin but the realm comes first.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    
    **Edward III:** God, the cousins I could have, but no...
    
-   Rudy and Fiona in _Kevin & Kell_ are technically first cousins, but only by marriage (two marriages actually) and through Fiona's stepparents both times, so it's okay.
-   The webcomic _Lines and Stripes_ has a couple like this, but the objection of people isn't so much that they're cousins, but that they're double cousins. The other wiki has an explanation as to why this is a bad idea.
-   _Sandra on the Rocks_: Eloise has a romantic thing for her cousin — perfectly legal in France, where they live, but close enough to make her uncomfortable about declaring it.

-   On _The Angry Beavers_, the episode "Stump's Family Reunion" has Dagget trying to help Stump hook up with his distant cousin Vanity.

-   When Hervé and Nicolas follow the gang to the factory in an episode of _Code Lyoko_, Odd and Aelita pretend to have sneaked out of school on a date, despite the fact that Aelita joined the school under the pretense of being Odd's first cousin. Note that it works as a perfect in-universe Fridge Brilliance: it was Fake-Out Make-Out, but Hervé and Nicolas probably reads it: "They are kissing? But... They are cousins! Oh... No wonder they are hiding." Notably, when Hervé report the fact to Sissi, she obviously doesn't believe him and finds the concept absurd.
