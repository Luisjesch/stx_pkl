The Shady Lady of the Night is a prostitute who is hired by someone not for sex, but something else.

Well, not just for cuddling and talking, but something _else_.

She is hired to do criminal, or... _shady_ activities.

Often they are commissioned to kill or steal from somebody: usually someone important, e.g. a politician or a crime leader. The main idea is that when politicians and crime leaders take the services of a prostitute (that is, the sex part) they allow her to get intimate with them (of course) and are unsuspecting her of any ill will. Especially if this girl is a courtesan, and her clients treat her like their girlfriend, then they are all the less suspective of her, when say, she drops a few spills of something in the food, or brings handcuffs to "have fun" in the bed, or asks a great amount of money for a new bracelet.

In a military setting, this can be possible because of Camp Followers.

Sometimes their target is not at all important: perhaps a woman cheated on by her husband with a prostitute, asks another one to kill her husband, or just do something plainer, like steal his wallet.

Or perhaps, she hires her to spy on him.

A lot of times these prostitutes are asked to be an informant on someone: yes, those politicians and crime leaders, who aren't suspective of her enough, and will talk about their activities with their friends right in front of her.

Many a time she doesn't even need to "spy" on or target anyone: if she is already involved in the criminal world, people (usually an Amateur Sleuth) will just pay her to give out information on those dealings.

This may not be a one-time experience, and she might become a part-time assassin, or informant. Or it could also happen that a brothel is actually a complete information network/assassin ring, in which case that has always been their job besides normal prostitution.

She might be a Dirty Harriet, who goes undercover as a prostitute, but isn't actually one, although if she goes undercover to do shady things, then that would still fit here.

May overlap with Platonic Prostitution, although in this case, sex _is_ usually involved, just not with the original commissioner.

Compare Predatory Prostitute, who is always an evil person, no matter what. A Shady Lady of the Night can have any moral alignment; they _are_ paid to harm someone, but this can range from the least harmful (e.g. giving out sensitive information) to the most (i.e. killing them).

May overlap with the Honey Trap, Femme Fatale, and Out with a Bang.

Not to be confused with Sex for Services, which is where sex is offered as payment for a service.

     Literature

At this, the other prostitutes pull out really big firearms from... somewhere, and start shooting the building up. Ultimately, though, the Saints win the firefight, because however well-armed the prostitutes are, they're still wearing Stripperiffic clothes instead of tactical body armour, which means they can be shot dead as effortlessly as any other enemy. In the aftermath, the DeWynters are read the riot act by their erstwhile allies:
