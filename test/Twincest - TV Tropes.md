_"Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We shared a womb, came in to this world together. We **belong** together."_

Popular culture often expects twins to share everything, including, it seems, their beds. It's a particularly common trope in Slash Fic and Rule 34, though it does occur in mainstream fiction often enough to be a discernible trope.

It's especially common as a way of making Creepy Twins just that much more disturbing, often as a form of Villainous Incest. For Yuri Fans and Yaoi Fans who became fans at least partly because they see a forbidden appeal to such relationships, twincest supercharges that part of the appeal. Though twincest is not necessarily homosexual — heterosexual Half-Identical Twins tend to have the highest rate of twincest.

A common twist in Twincest — and in Brother–Sister Incest in general — is Surprise Incest: for a couple to fall in love, only to find out later that they're related. The fact that Separated at Birth is already a common twin trope reinforces this. How far their relationship goes before they discover this generally depends on whether the plotline is supposed to be humorous or tragic.

In other variations, the twins know perfectly well that they're related, and might like each other all the more for it—if you believe in One True Love, soulmates being born together does make a certain kind of sense. Mindlink Mates and Twin Telepathy definitely have parallels. Ultimately, although this is fairly exploitational, such a rationale is the simplest and most common in modern works where twins enter into romantic or sexual relations deliberately and voluntarily. Commonly, the _twins in question_ believe they're soulmates, but _everyone else_ has a "No. Just… No" Reaction.

An old Japanese myth says that if two star-crossed lovers commit dual suicide, they get reincarnated as twins. This may be one of the factors in the frequency of Twincest stories in anime. In this case, Red String of Fate and, as a whole, esoteric-religious motives such Reincarnation Romance can be used as a justification for obviously taboo relations.

In a broader religious or mythological context, this trope can be regarded as Older Than Dirt, given the many similar myths in different nations where twincest is directly mentioned or implied in the context of couples from Half Identical Twin Divine Incest gods who are portrayed as appointed to become husband and wife, or as the first people in general.

Twincest is **not** the same as Twin Threesome Fantasy. Twincest is all about twins screwing _each other_; in a Twin Threesome Fantasy, the focus is either on the third, non-twin party, or on each other but _for the benefit_ of the third party.

A subtrope of Brother–Sister Incest. If it's just implied, then it overlaps with Incest Subtext. It's also important not to make mistakes with other Brother–Sister Incest couples, since, due to the popularity of this trope and the idea of a spiritual bond of twins, many "ordinary" couples between brother and sister can imitate many twincest cliché elements.

Twincest is often associated with Screw Yourself (when a character has sex with an alternate version of themself). The two don't have any clear link, yet the association suggests that some people view twins as alternate versions of the same person.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Yosuga no Sora_ is practically Trope Codifier of this trope for H-Game and especially anime, gradually and in detail depicting the development of romantic feelings between Half-Identical Twins Sora and Haruka Kasugano and their different approaches in the awareness and acceptance of their feelings for each other.
-   _Aki Sora_ mainly chronicles the secret romance of the titular sister-brother duo, but said brother also has a mentally unstable twin sister who rapes and sexually abuses him.
-   _Angel Sanctuary_: Let's not get started on Rociel/Roshiel's "ambiguous" attitude towards his twin sister Alexiel. But then again, Rociel isn't a paragon of sanity, and brother-sister incest is one of the main _themes_ of the manga.
-   _Black Lagoon_'s Hansel and Gretel. Given their history, this is possibly the _least_ disturbing thing about them.
-   _Bloods: Inraku no Ketsuzoku 2_: The Sagemiya family is cursed in that its members are sexually aroused in the presence of another of the same bloodline. Misaki's twin brother Shun is both disgusted over this and has sworn to resist the curse. However, Shun loses his composure and starts banging their big sister Kagu. After Misaki finds out, she too gives in to the curse and begins an affair with Shun.
-   The Hayasaka twins from _Buso Renkin_, while probably not involved in _actual_ twincest, do act a lot like a married couple, and as kids, used to recite the traditional wedding vows to each other as a game. This was done by their kidnapper, a woman who has had an affair with their biological father that was later broken off. After being spending nearly three years with the woman, they suffered a Parental Abandonment with the "marriage game" being their only happy memory giving them a "us vs the world" codependent mentality similar to the Hitachiin twins. Meeting Kazuki Muto helped them become individuals but are still close.
-   _Candy☆Boy_ is entirely about _yuri_ twincest, in that Yukino does like to tease her sister Kanade quite a bit. There's nothing explicit going on since Kanade decides to keep a cool outer appearance, although she is obviously enamored with her sister. Something explicit _is_ going on by the end. They kiss in the last non-DVD episode. The manga also revolves around their romantic, and sometimes sexual, feelings for each other.
-   _Case Closed_:
    -   This makes up all the drama in one case. Raita Banba, a high school friend of Kogoro's, had a fiancée named Hatsune Kamon. On the eve of their wedding, Hatsune was killed when the car exploded, and Raita was the main suspect due to his Crazy Jealous Guy tendencies. It was later revealed that they were Half-Identical Twins, who were separated when they were babies after a house fire, and the two didn't _know_ that they committed twincest until Hatsune received a call that the DNA results confirms that. Already _very_ stressed from the thought of Raita's and her origins _and_ the fact that she was sick, poor Hatsune soon fell into the Despair Event Horizon and as a result, she committed suicide. The sickness part is important because Hatsune suffered from Turner syndrome which is what happens when one of the sex chromosomes, either the second X or the Y, is missing or structurally altered. Hatsune is in fact Raita's _identical twin_ and would have probably been born male.
-   In _Castle Town Dandelion_, one of Misaki's clones (Shaura) embodying her repressed lust shows strong affection towards her twin brother Haruka, while teasing Misaki that this is what she truly wants; though she denies this, Shaura also states that the reason for Misaki partaking in her country's election are all to gain Haruka's attention, all away from her other sisters.
-   _Ceres, Celestial Legend_ plays this trope quite creepily and mixes it with Rape as Drama. The actual twins, Aya and Aki, care for each other deeply but don't have twincestuous feelings for each other; they are, however, possessed by their ancestors, Shisou and Ceres, who were husband and wife.
-   _Chobits_ has some _extremely_ un-sibling-like touching between Chi and the "Dark Chi" that appears in her mind. This proves to be her sister, Freya, whose mind was downloaded into Chi.
-   _A Cruel God Reigns_: Eric and Valentine. Eric became dangerously dependent on his twin sister after being molested by their piano teacher as a child. Unable to separate comfort from romance, the two had sex and Valentine had a baby at 13 years old.
-   Mukuro in _Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School_ shares an incestuous Masochism Tango with her twin sister Junko, as she had her sisterly affection twisted into unquestioning devotion due to Junko's manipulation. As a result, all she can do is blush and moan with pleasure as Junko beats and insults her.
-   The _Destiny of the Shrine Maiden_ manga ends with Chikane and Himeko reincarnated as twin sisters. This may be a variation on the Japanese myth mentioned above.
-   _Digimon Frontier_: While the newly-reunited twins Kouji and Kouichi are distinctly _not_ an example, it does get used as a joke in episode 41. Kouji saving his brother from Crusadermon ends in an awkwardly dramatic moment<small>◊</small> (possibly enhanced by in-universe Shipping Goggles), which leads the beauty-obsessed Crusadermon to declare, "Ah, brotherly love is _grand!_" The other observing Legendary Warriors are notably disturbed.<small>◊</small>
-   _D.N.Angel_ features some Les Yay between twins Risa and Riku, though mostly in color illustrations. There's a rather eyebrow-raisingly sensual pic of them lying side-by-side on a bed. One shall also note that they get a pinky thread of love together.
-   _.hack//Legend of the Twilight_ hints strongly at incest, or at least lust, between twins Shugo and Rena. This is basically a Flanderization of subtler jokes in the manga, where it was the sister's completely different-looking and skimpily-dressed computer avatar that set off the whole thing. The anime altered the storyline near the end where their relationship is implied to be much stronger.
-   _Durarara!!_'s Mairu and Kururi Orihara have somewhat incestuous feelings towards one another, largely owing to the fact that they're not quite right in the head (they don't actually consider themselves separate individuals, for starters).
-   Though barely present in the main story of _Earthian_, other than a mention now and again by his assistant and close friend Raphael, Lord Michael and his twin sister Lucifel are featured prominently in an extra story, written years following the original publishing, that was included in the reprint. In the story, not only is Lucifel shown to be extra touchy-feely with Michael (not to mention possessive of him, to the point where Raphael considers her his romantic rival), it is strongly implied that not only do they eventually have sex, but Lucifel has a child by him, that child being Kagetsuya, one of the two main characters of the main story. This becomes somewhat less of a shock when you consider the mangaka is Yun Kouga (see _Loveless_).
-   In _Full Metal Panic!: The Second Raid_, the assassins Xia Yu Fan and Xia Yu Lan are twin sisters who take showers together and hold each other at every available opportunity. Also, Yu Lan sees Yu Fan descending naked from the sky toward her when she dies.
-   _Mobile Suit Gundam 00_ plays with this too. Whether Ribbons Almark and his "sister" Healing Care qualify as twins is debatable, both of them being DNA-engineered children with the same sequence, but Healing seems to show a bit more adoration than is platonic towards Ribbons.
-   The relationship between Carossa and Melissa in _GUN×SWORD_ has elements of this, though they are never so pronounced as when the two first appear and Carossa _licks away Melissa's tears_. Van, watching, cannot help but be a little disturbed. They _are_ basically kids. What _was_ there was creepy, particularly Carossa managing to imply "Abusive Relationship" while being all of twelve years old.
-   In _Magical Girl Site_, Aya and Yatsumura fall for each other, but Aya later learns they are Separated at Birth twin sisters. In the ending, they pursue the relationship anyway.
-   Subverted in _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_: Kira and his Separated at Birth twin sister Cagalli meet in the first episode, neither knowing they're related. When they reunite further in the series, Cagalli comforts the emotionally ragged Kira. Cagalli also seems to develop a crush on Kira. This is taken as a threat by Flay, Kira's screwed-up girlfriend (it's not a healthy relationship). Further toyed with when Cagalli displays a Luminescent Blush at overhearing Flay admit to her ex-fiance Sai that she and Kira have slept together, and when Kira's adoptive parents Caridad and Haruma (who are aware of Cagalli's identity, as the mother rescued both twins as babies from the place where their biological parents died) show a bit of alarm when Cagalli hugs Kira goodbye. They're informed of their true relationship before things have a chance to go any further.
-   In _Monster_, there is a one-sided example with Johan Liebert and his twin, Anna. Unfortunately, Johan is also really scary and effectively scares Anna half to death whenever she thinks about him. Although, considering how he treats other people, this may be the only way he's even capable of displaying affection whatsoever. It doesn't seem to be brotherly love, though, when he talks about her as his "other half," and the poetic, romantic emails he anonymously sends at the start of the story are taken to be from a secret admirer. It comes off as a really creepy infatuation, usually.
-   _Myself ; Yourself_ has twins Shuri and Shusuke with a particularly strong relationship in the face of Parental Abandonment, with a later rumor even claiming a more illicit relationship. Under threat of separation, they run away together near the end. The Distant Finale goes on, giving them a strange Maybe Ever After the end, where they attend a concert of main characters, holding hands. The original game at the same time plays with it, giving both twins the other Love Interest, but at the same time having a scene with Shusuke in the route of his sister, where he confesses to one-sided feelings towards her. Nevertheless, despite all the ambiguity, it's still Fanon among fans.
-   The first episode of _Osomatsu-san_ parodies this. The characters try to re-imagine _Osomatsu-kun_ for a modern-day audience as an idol, harem show with a Cast Full of Pretty Boys. This includes Incest Subtext between the brothers (mind you they're _sextuplets_).
-   _Ouran High School Host Club_: This is the main "schtick" of Genre Savvy Hikaru and Kaoru(pictured above): making the club's female clients swoon and sigh over "the forbidden love between brothers!!!" Whether it's a put-on or not is hard to tell, given their trickster personalities. They seem to be _very_ affectionate toward each other even when the fangirls _aren't_ watching—but this, too, could also be a game they play. Nevertheless, on one occasion where Tamaki calls them early on a weekend, we see them waking up in bed… the same bed… cuddling each other. _Naked._ It's also deconstructed, as the twins are revealed to be dangerously codependent. In the manga, this eventually sparks a feud between them, and they eventually learn how to be individuals.
-   Teased with The Demon Sisters in _Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt_, who are a little _too_ nice to one another. They briefly engage in twincest in the second to last episode.
-   Masako and Kanba from _Penguindrum_, sort of: Masako openly chases after Kanba, but though he cares for her, he doesn't reciprocate.
-   _Please Twins!_ features a boy who is not sure which of the two girls in the story is his long-lost twin sister. Both girls show up to his house with the exact same photo, and the image is of a young boy and girl too young to discern which of the two grown women it is. The guy has the same photo, so it's a safe bet that he's the boy in the image, but all three begin living in the same home in hopes to find out. They _both_ fall for him, making one a case of twincest and the other not, and the story uses this fact as all parties are clearly uncomfortable with being in a relationship with a sibling to the point that each girl begins hoping they aren't related to him so that these feelings can be explored.
    -   The manga and anime swap which girl is the sister and which becomes the girlfriend, which muddies the canon sister dynamic. As a result, which girl is the sister and which is the girlfriend isn't only different from each medium, but this ultimately makes certain major plot points and scenes towards the end of the series differ on the medium.
-   In _Revolutionary Girl Utena_, Half-Identical Twins Miki and Kozue have a bizarre relationship which may involve twincest, particularly in the movie.
-   _Saiyuki_: Hakkai's girlfriend Kanan was actually his Separated at Birth twin sister. It's not known when they found out, but it was Hakkai's motive for what he did after she was given up to the demons by the villagers, gang-raped, forcibly impregnated, and then Driven to Suicide. And apparently even after they found out, they didn't actually break up or anything.
-   In _selector infected WIXOSS_ Yuzuki is in love with her twin brother and wishes to become his girlfriend. She ends up actually getting her wish granted, but at the cost of her LRIG, Hanayo, swapping places with her. Still, she doesn't hold much of a grudge against Hanayo, as she did fulfill Yuzuki's wish, and had no malicious intent when she took over her body.
-   _Tayu-Tayu_: In chapter 6, Reiju accidentally overhears someone having sex inside a watermill and decides to see who it is. He's shocked to find that it's a pair of girls and even more so when he sees that it's two of his classmates: Haruka and her twin sister Sayaka. Haruka explains that their relationship started because most of the local boys their age moved away, leaving them with no alternatives for release besides masturbation and each other. Once Haruka and Sayaka started having sex, they soon found it impossible to be in the same room without tearing each other's clothes off. So they scissor each other every chance they get.
-   _Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-_: The Acid Tokyo arc's Kamui and Subaru (also known as the "Vampire Twins") actually manage even more Ho Yay than their counterparts in _X1999_ (where they are not related in any way). Vampirism (and new twincest possibilities) may have something to do with it.

    Audio Plays 

-   Naohiro from _Yandere Heaven_ has feelings for his twin sister. Since they're the only family they have (with the exception of their stepfather), Nahiro has done his best to take care of her. His ending hints that he may have an Entitled to Have You behavior because they're twins and he believes that they should love each other and die together no matter what.
-   A special twist for the third volume of _Yandere no Onna no Ko_ is Alice harboring a one-sided crush on her twin sister. Everything she had done was to make sure that no one took her loved one away from her. Unfortunately, this led to Elise killing herself because her sister refused to let her interact with anyone other else. It's suggested that Alice also kills herself to join her sister in death.

    Comic Books 

-   _Afterlife with Archie_ implies Cheryl and Jason have incestuous affections towards each other. It's suggested not all of it is entirely consensual on Cheryl's part.
-   In _Grendel_, Orion Assante has a three-way incestuous relationship with his twin sisters, until they get murdered to help motivate him.
-   It was heavily implied in a few issues of _Infinity, Inc._ that Obsidian has a crush on his long-lost twin sister Jade. She was blissfully oblivious. It should be noted that in the original _Infinity, Inc._ comic, there's no indication of Obsidian being gay. He, in fact, has a girlfriend in later issues. It wasn't until his and Nuklon's appearances in _Justice League_ that his sexuality is hinted at, but not confirmed at the time. After years in limbo, it was finally made canon in JSA.
-   In _Lazarus_ Jonah and Johannah Carlyle are sleeping together and plotting to usurp the family holdings from their father. However, when one of Jonah's badly underthought plans goes wrong, Johannah plays the Wounded Gazelle Gambit and pretends that Jonah betrayed her as well.
-   _Marvel Comics_: The Fenris twins (Andrea and Andreas Von Strucker) play with this idea—and likely, each other!—fairly frequently. And then it got worse gets worse. Andrea has since died, and since their energy blast powers relied on them touching to function, her brother had her skin made into leather and wrapped his sword hilt with it. On top of that, he is nothing short of fanatically obsessed with finding a way to resurrect her. The whole thing is portrayed just as creepily as it sounds, with even other characters around him being squicked by it. Their Ultimate versions were pretty much the same, save for the bit in spoilers. However, when Andrea is later cloned, her brother tries to deny that their relationship was ever incestuous. He allows her to sleep in a separate bed, and claims that while he knows his teammates think that he's a freak, he has no actual desire to have sex with his sister. Then due to some very complicated developments, Clone Andrea and Andreas both died. But then they were back as usual running a nightclub for supervillains, and it was unclear again.
-   Aleksandr and Aleksandra Ramanov in _Nikolai Dante_ are like this, even taking time out of killing the Raven Corps to make out.
-   _Top 10_'s Spin-Off miniseries _Smax_ has Smax and his sister Rexa admitting to this, although in the world they came from it wasn't the taboo issue it was in his adopted world. When she moves to Jeff's world they pose as unrelated lovers—Robyn alone knows the truth but doesn't have a problem with it.
-   In the _Ultimate Marvel_ universe, there were hints about Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch going down this road from the beginning, until it was confirmed outright in _The Ultimates 3_, immediately before her death.
-   They are clones rather than twins, but the girls in the _XXXenophile_ story "Family Reunion" probably count.
-   _Wonder Woman (2011)_ gave Artemis (goddess not Amazon) a crush on her twin Apollo and plenty of flirting with him which he seemed to like. This was quite the shift from her normal asexuality (though not out of form for the mythological Greek gods) and was retconned to have been false versions of Artemis and Apollo with the end of the New 52 in _Wonder Woman (Rebirth)_.
-   In Alan Moore's _Lost Girls_, Alice's re-telling of her story casts Tweedle-Dum and Tweedle-Dee as lesbians who have sex with young girls (including Alice) as well as each other.

    Fan Works 

-   _Saint Seiya_:
    -   The twins Gemini Saga and Gemini Kanon make one of the most popular and accepted couples among slash and yaoi fans in this series both in the manga and anime because of their dramatic and conflictive relationship as twin brothers who love and hate each other. Fandom, as we can see here finds quite interesting the fact of imagining that both share more than "brotherly love" (a.k.a. twincest) during their lives despite being separated for 13 years.
    -   The same happens in the spin-off _Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas_, with the twins Aspros and Defteros.
    -   And the same goes with Separated at Birth twins Mizar Syd and Alcor Bud from Asgard Saga.
-   America and Canada, the "North American Brothers" of _Hetalia: Axis Powers_, are (assumed to be) twins and pairing with growing popularity in the fandom. It can't match the popularity of the America/England pairing yet, but it has its devotees. Oh, and by that, we mean including having _babies_ with each other - _especially_ the State-tan OCs. Oh God, the State-tan OCs.
    -   It doesn't stop there, either. Southern Italy and Northern Italy, although not actually twins, look a lot alike, and are thus confused as twins. As a result, Itacest has a pretty loyal following.
-   Quite a few fans of Kira×Cagalli from _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_ refuse to follow the canon. Mostly because of all the Ship Tease between the two before The Reveal. Also because of the innocent purepure relationship between Lacus and Kira that does not seem to get any further than hugging or Holding Hands. And the relatively frustrating relationship between Everyone × Athrun × Cagalli that pushes suspension of belief.
-   From _Infinite Stratos_ and its obscure Fandom, there's this (un)holy fic. Rather than picking one of the members of Ichika's Unwanted Harem, the author chooses Ichika's Half-Identical Twins... who's clearly hots for him. The girl in question is The Dragon, M (Orimura Madoka), chosen specifically as O.C. Stand-in in an Alternate Universe Fic. She has a decent reason though. It's Crazy Enough to Work.
-   Yoh and Hao in _Shaman King_ are twins. In the anime, especially the 4Kids dub, Hao kept saying it was Yoh's destiny to unite with him. A lot of yaoi fangirls love Yoh/Hao. They are literally a single soul that got split in two, simultaneously explaining the "unite" Double Entendre and making this closer to Screw Yourself.
-   Dipper and Mabel Pines from _Gravity Falls_, due to the fact that they always hug or hold hands, are one another's Only Friend until the start of the series, and are incredibly affectionate and supportive of one another (to the point where their Grunkle Stan claims that it's "unnatural" for siblings to get along as well as Dipper and Mabel do). What certainly helps is that they have a dynamic similar to a Savvy Guy, Energetic Girl romance and are The Not-Love Interest for each other (frequently sacrificing for/defending one another). In the fan community, the pairing is known as "Pinecest", after their last name. However, it’s considered pretty taboo to a lot of fans, primarily because of the show's creator Alex Hirsch freely admitting to be grossed out by it since Dipper and Mabel are based on Alex and his twin sister Ariel from when they were twelve-year-olds. Notably, the show’s official subreddit has outright banned discussing and/or sharing fanart/fanfic of Pinecest.
    -   There's also a less-popular pairing of Stan and his twin brother Ford, known as "Stancest", since Pinecest was already taken.
-   There are multiple examples of pairing up Netto and Rockman from _Mega Man Battle Network_/_MegaMan NT Warrior_. It's up to the Gentle Reader to decide which turns on or squicks him or her more—the game version, where this trope applies in full, or in the anime, where he's just a computer program.
-   Amiboshi and Suboshi in _Fushigi Yuugi_, though a lot of this is fan speculation. Especially because Suboshi feeds Amiboshi a mind-erase drug _through a kiss_ in episode 40. In an author's note in the manga, Yuu Watase claims that she didn't mean for that particular incident to seem so sexual. Suuure she didn't.
-   The revelation at the end of _Chrono Crusade_ that Chrono and Aion are twins hasn't stopped some fans from shipping them. The fact that Aion really does seem to have a brother complex doesn't help dissuade them.
-   One of the fanon yaoi pairings in _The Prince of Tennis_ involves a set of twins: the Kisarazus, namely Atsushi from Saint Rudolph (short hair, a red bandanna) and Ryou from Rokkaku (long hair, a white hat).
-   There are a few fanfics that pair up opposite gender twins Android 17 and Android 18 from _Dragon Ball Z_ 1 2 (Both of these stories are NSFW.)
-   Many fans pair Vash and Knives from _Trigun_. To be fair, it _is_ strongly implied that Knives has one heck of a brother complex towards Vash. The first big confrontation between Vash and Knives at the very end of the first _Trigun_ manga really looks like a metaphorical rape scene complete with grotesquely obvious phallic symbols. Which wasn't even the most disturbing thing about this scene in the first place.
-   The Kongo brothers pairing in _Eyeshield 21_ fandom has a pretty good following. Agon's a huge narcissist and Unsui is very dedicated to his younger brother. It's not hard to imagine it being a little more than brotherly…
-   Yylfordt Granz and Szayel-Aporro Granz from _Bleach_ are assumed to be twins since they have the same birthday and it's not that hard to come across fan arts and fan fictions featuring this pairing, known as Granzcest in the Western fandom or IruZae in the Japanese fandom.
-   Twincest runs rampant in the _Blue Exorcist_ fandom, with the Rin x Yukio pairing taking up almost 50% of all online romantic Fan Fiction (and normal boy x girl pairings less than 25%). Interestingly, there is no hint of yaoi in the actual series (especially since Yukio and Rin's relationship is… bad and getting worse mostly on Yukio's side). In fact, chapter 74 appears to have Kato half-calling people out on it… she seems to be doing her best to remind the fans that this ship sank long ago (and never was there in the first place), though it's mostly Played for Laughs.
-   Pretty much every _The Boondock Saints_ slashfic.
-   _Harry Potter_:
-   Amane "Hanako" Yugi and his younger brother Tsukasa Yugi in _Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun_, and it's almost always Tsukasa on top.
-   In fanfics based on _The Lord of the Rings_ or _The Silmarillion_, Elladan and Elrohir are often shipped together. To a lesser extent, so are their father Elrond and his twin brother Elros, and Amrod and Amras, the twin sons of Fëanor.
-   _The Suite Life of Zack & Cody_: Zack and Cody together have lots of fans, too.
-   _Devil May Cry_: It doesn't help that Dante and Vergil are ridiculously pretty and there's a lack of female characters (that don't look like their mom.)
-   Raul Gureden of _Super Robot Wars Reversal_ would have fit the more appropriate Screw Yourself, due in fact his female counterpart Fiona Gureden are one and the same character in Reversal. However, upon getting an entry in _Super Robot Wars: Original Generation_, the two became Half-Identical Twins; naturally, fanworks ascended it to this trope, even though continuity says otherwise.
-   Namazuo and Honebami Toushirou of _Touken Ranbu_ are technically twins (though they were forged in the same year as at least seven other swords in their family, including Ichigo Hitofuri), and their ship is the most frequent out of all pairings featuring either of them.
    -   Kousetsu and Souza Samonji get the same treatment, though they were also forged in the same year as their youngest brother Sayo.
-   On learning that Fai of _Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-_ has a deceased twin brother named Fai (hence why the Fai we know and love is named Fai), the fangirls hit the keyboards hard.
-   In _Xenosaga_, Albedo is revealed to have been the conjoined twin of Junior. And let's just say that Albedo… was really obsessed with him, to the point where the thought of being unable to stay with him forever—among other things—drove him mad.
-   A Alternate Timeline fanfic for the PS3 game _inFAMOUS_, in which the twin daughters of the first game's protagonist and Love Interest, Cole MacGrath and Trish Daily, become twincestuous lesbians; due to the nature of the fic.
-   Lucas and Claus from _Mother 3_ have been treated in this way.
-   Mario and Luigi from _Super Mario Bros._ have been given this by fans. Most slash fanworks are of them together.
-   _Mega Man 3_: Gemini Man and his clones. It's one of the classic mainstays of Mega Man slash.
-   _Ask That Guy with the Glasses_ and _The Nostalgia Critic_ are twins in fics most of the time, with Ask That Guy usually torturing Critic, sexually, emotionally, and physically. Fun times for all.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   A lot of fan art and fan fiction involving Aloe Blossom and Lotus Blossom loves to speculate about what goes on in their spa after hours (wink wink, nudge nudge).
    -   Fanon typically has Cloudchaser and Flitter as twins, though in canon it's unknown, but they're commonly shipped together.
-   In _The Two Between_, though it isn't confirmed, Sunset is sure in-universe that the twins have a relationship of that nature.
-   _Edgar & Ellen_ fandom has quite a few of these.
-   _Transformers_: If you see Sideswipe and Sunstreaker in a fanfic together, 90% of the time it's because they're banging each other.
    -   Likewise, Reflector now exists purely to have three-ways. But then three identical robots becoming one camera… really is asking for it.
    -   The jet twins Jetfire and Jetstorm too.
-   Kyle and Lane Carlson, twin male models. And the Brewer twins, Derek and Keith.
-   _Thunder Cats_: Both incarnations of WilyKat and WilyKit have gotten this.
-   _Hivefled_; there's nothing actually going on between the Separated at Birth Gamzee and Feferi, but if they're caught, their Abusive Parents have plans.
-   The Twins from _Superjail!_ have somewhat of a fanbase that interprets them as incestuous based on their narcissism and closeness to each other. Certain lines (such as their "date" joke from an early episode) fueled the shipping, although the vague porn incident that traumatized them has been used by supporters _and_ detractors of the ship to prove or disprove the dynamic being canon.
-   _Resonance Days_ has Arzt Kochen and Nie Bluhen Herzen, two identical witches (aside from differing Red Right Hands) who arrived in the afterlife together and seemingly cannot keep their hands off one another (much to the disgust of their teammates). Though they repeatedly claim that they aren't siblings, nobody believes them, and even they couldn't truthfully tell you otherwise thanks to Ghost Amnesia. It's actually a subversion; in life they were spinoff characters Yuuri Asuka and Airi Anri, the latter of whom wished to be identical in appearance to the former.
-   Len and Rin from _Vocaloid_ are constantly paired together, though Word of God says they're closer to selfcest as they were supposed to be mirror images.
-   Pairing the two Ice Climbers together is common in _Super Smash Bros._ fandom. There's an ambiguity to whether they're siblings or unrelated friends though some shippers present them as lovers and siblings.
-   _The Rabbit and the Puppy_ Fanfic pairs Kagami and her twin Tsukasa. Yuri pairings are somewhat rarer.
-   L and Beyond Birthday from _Death Note_ are frequently portrayed as being twins (though whether or not they actually _are_ twins, or even related to one another, is up for debate) and very often get into this. In most such works, BB coerces or forces L into it… but not always.
-   There's Kinkaku and Ginkaku of _Naruto_. The characters aren't major, but if they were their twincest fandom may be higher. However, there have been fanfics in the past, and some fandom—in forums, and during chapter reviews, who toy with the idea, being that the two of them are constantly together, and they say each other's names in every breath. It's canon that the word Ginkaku has said most in his entire life is his brother's name. And Kinkaku, while normally stoic and composed, manga-wise, flies into a rage whenever his brother is seriously harmed. It also appears they stayed together their entire lives, and neither of them ever got married or had any children. So there's room to toy with the twincest idea, and a few of the fandom has.
-   _Osomatsu-kun_ features a group of sextuplets. A lot of shipping between every pair, and sometimes even all six together, occurs. As mentioned above, the series itself made fun of this phenomenon.
-   Max and Phoebe on _The Thundermans_, often called "Thundercest". Just don't tell it to Kira Kosarin, the actress who plays Phoebe, who is _not_ a fan of the pair.
-   An accidental example occurs in _The Rabbit Returns to ToonTown_ due to childish ignorance. Rhoda once caught her four-year-old twins playing patty-cake, which they learned from black-and-white Toons. It turns out that Toons consider "patty-cake" as a very flirtatious act. This dates back to the 1910s when Toons were drawn without genitalia and resorted to patty-cake as a sex equivalent. Amongst younger Toons, it's not as raunchy, but the act still has a sexually charged element to it. After learning this a few years afterwards, Jack and Rose agreed never to mention that incident again.
-   In the Modern AU _How to Train Your Dragon_ fic _Confusion_, Astrid and her OC twin sister Lillian were involved when they were younger before their parents found out and forced them to separate (blaming Astrid for 'corrupting' her younger sibling). In the course of the fic, the two girls each fall for Hiccup and eventually form a new relationship with him and each other, the trio making arrangements so that they can be together all at once or have just two of the parties involved without the third as 'appropriate'.
-   _An Empire of Ice and Fire_ already has the canonical example between Jaime and Cersei, but the oneshot sequel _Something About Dragonstone_ also reveals that Jon and Daenerys' twin children Rhaegar and Arya have entered into a relationship during the Time Skip. Being Targaryens, everyone just shrugs this off.
-   _Momentary Weakness_: A source of much speculation among the people of the kingdom. Pyra and Mythra are sisters and are part of the royal marriage, so what exactly does that mean for _their_ relationship? Their friends have decided it's best not to ask.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The twist in _Beautiful Kate_ is that Kate not only had sex with her older step-brother but also her actual twin brother, Ned.
-   _Blades of Glory_: The twin brother and sister villain-duo of Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg have shared an unusually close bond since childhood and are constantly touchy-feely. They finally fling themselves at each other for a kiss just as the police are hauling them away. Amusingly enough, the Van Waldenbergs' actors — Will Arnett and Amy Poehler — were actually married in real life at the time of the film.
-   Not-so-subtly<small>◊</small> hinted at in _Brothers of the Head_ with _conjoined_ twin brothers.
-   _Children of Dune_: There are strong incestuous overtones between Leto II and his twin sister Ghanima. It's never outright confirmed but they do share many tender moments together, even kissing on the mouth when reunited in the end.
-   _Cruel Intentions 2_ had a scene where identical twin sisters make out in the shower. This film was originally produced as the pilot episode for a Fox TV series called _Manchester Prep_, but the series was cancelled before broadcast and so the pilot was "spiced up" for video release. One can safely assume this scene wasn't in the TV version. Rather ridiculously, in the scene, the girls claim to only be cousins. This is one of only a handful of sexual scenes involving real-life siblings to appear outside of porn.
-   The 1988 film _Dead Ringers_ features some creepily sexual scenes between Jeremy Irons _and_ Jeremy Irons as twin gynecologists Beverly and Elliot. It's based on the novel _Twins_.
-   In _Dobermann_, Manu sexually desires his twin sister Nat, and attempts to grope her and has to dragged off her by her boyfriend. Nat, for her part, considers this disgusting and wants no part of it.
-   _The Dreamers_: An American student Matthew befriends a Parisian brother and sister Théo and Isabelle. They claim to have been born connected at the shoulder, even though that can't happen with fraternal twins. It becomes more and more apparent that there is something very… odd about the siblings' relationship—heavily implied, though never explicitly confirmed. They claim Isabelle was a virgin until Matthew, downplaying it. Whatever's going on, Matthew doesn't really seem to mind. Everything's fine until someone puts a brick through the window.
-   In _Euro Trip_, Jenny and Jamie get trashed on absinthe and make out (neither realizing who the other is). They are appropriately horrified when they open their eyes the next morning.
    
    **Cooper**: Oh, here it is. Bratislava. Hmm. Capital of Slovakia. Oh, here's a fun fact: You made out with your sister, man!
    
-   _Feed (2017)_: It's strongly implied that Matt wants his twin sister Olivia.
-   Subverted in _Gone Girl_: as the media circus surrounding Amy Dunne's disappearance escalates, the press deliberately starts spreading innuendo that Nick was having an affair with his twin sister Margo. Nick hears this trope invoked by name by a guy watching the news at an airport.
-   Creepy Twins Wendell and Darlene from the horror film _The Hamiltons_.
-   _Hellboy II: The Golden Army_: Okay, the twincest doesn't actually _happen_, but boy, does Prince Nuada want it to. It could be inferred that it had happened in the past. Considering that anything felt by one is felt by both, it's likely any masturbation experienced by one would automatically be shared with the other.
-   In _Hellraiser: Inferno_, the Wire Twins Cenobites creep up on Joseph to have a deliberately disturbing make-out session with him and are seen feeling each other up in a later scene.
-   Boy-girl twins Ryan and Sharpay Evans from _High School Musical_ have twincest subtext… even though Ryan also has conflicting gay subtext. On twincest note, they have a suspiciously close relationship, what with singing love songs to each other and playing romantic leads opposite each other. There's Taylor's bizarre statement that, "If Sharpay could figure out a way to play Romeo and Juliet at the same time, her brother would be out of a job." Plus there's that video of "I Can't Take My Eyes Off of You", a song in which Troy, Gabriella, Ryan, and Sharpay all sing—Troy and Gabriella (established couple) sing to each other and Ryan and Sharpay… also sing to each other. Sample lyrics:
    
    _I can't take my eyes off of you  
    I know you feel the same way too, yeah  
    I can't take my eyes off of you  
    All it took… was one look  
    For a dream come true_
    
-   _The House of Yes_: The twins blatantly admit to their incestuous behavior, much to their younger siblings' disgust.
-   _Incest! The Musical_ is a quirky, upbeat — bordering on Refuge in Audacity — short student film about high-school twins Alex and Katie getting together. Notably, unlike most examples on this page, though, their relationship isn't portrayed as entirely wrong or evil, instead being framed more along the lines of a typical love story. Heck, it even ends with a Surprisingly Happy Ending where no one seems to care about the two twins becoming an Official Couple.
    
    _"Foiled by our genealogy!  
    Maybe we've got chemistryyyyy!"_
    
-   A key theme in _The Lodgers_. The family's ancestors were a pair of twins who fell in love and married. This doomed their children and every generation after to live out a terrible curse: breed and raise the next generation of incestuous twins, then commit suicide by drowning together. Rachel resists this fate while Edward is eager to embrace it. The tension between attraction and repulsion escalates, and the audience begins to wonder how much of the characters' behavior is driven by the curse and how much is driven by forbidden desires.
-   Very heavily implied with the twin socialite sisters ("We share _everything_") in _Species II_.
-   Narrowly averted (at least according to Fanon) in _Star Wars_. The viewers (and the characters themselves) are initially led to expect a love triangle between Luke, Leia, and Han, but then it is revealed in _Return of the Jedi_ that Luke and Leia are actually long-lost twins. The romance between them is vaguely Hand Waved, and the love triangle is instantly resolved.
    -   However, the novel _Splinter of the Mind's Eye_ was written and takes place before their relationship was revealed and so features romantic scenes with the two, as well as a scene in which Luke openly admires Leia's body. Particularly her "seal-curve hips". Apparently _Splinter of the Mind's Eye_ was George Lucas's plan B if Star Wars wasn't a big enough hit to make _The Empire Strikes Back_, and would have been developed into a movie had there been no money to make the trilogy as hoped. At this point, he had not decided whether or not Luke and Leia would be family or a romantic item, but with all sources taken into context, it looks like a pretty clear case of Abandon Shipping.
    -   _Star Wars (Marvel 1977)_, which also started production long before _Return of the Jedi_, also features a great deal of subtext early on. There are many, many instances between _The Empire Strikes Back_ and _Return of the Jedi_ in which either Luke or Leia were trying for a Relationship Upgrade when they were interrupted by something or other. On a meta-level, it was because the writers knew Han would come back and show whether "I know" meant reciprocation, but looking at it today makes it seem like the Force knew these two were twins and contrived to keep them from sleeping together.
    -   _New Jedi Order_ (_Star Wars Legends_): The Yuuzhan Vong pantheon includes Yun-Q'aah and Yun-Txiin, sibling deities whose domain includes "love and hate and all things opposite". Their usual titles are either "The Twins" or "The Lovers". Thought it's possible they either aren't twins or aren't lovers, and the Vong just have really confusing mythological canon—it happens. (For bonus points, a psyop plants a non-humorous meme in the Vong that the Jedi twins Jacen and Jaina are avatars of the twin gods…)
-   In _National Lampoon's Class Reunion_, what turned antagonist Walter Baylor into a crazy ax murderer was a prank where he was set up to have a makeout session with what turned out to be his own twin sister.
-   In the 1969 British comedy _Some Like It Sexy_, a guy gets into a threesome with twins (played by former Playboy playmates Mary and Madeleine Collinson). After a little while, he realizes the girls are paying more attention to each other than him, and when he moves away they don't even notice. He leaves and the girls continue without him.
-   Billy Zane and Gina Gershon's characters in _This World Then the Fireworks_.
-   The deformed cannibal twins in _Wrong Turn 2: Dead End_. In one instance, the girl gets jealous and violent when she discovers her brother masturbating to the sight of a sunbathing woman. She kills the woman, and the two start to have sex afterwards.

    Literature 

-   _The Acts of Caine_: A probably nonconsensual example: Berne is revealed to keep twin sex slaves, one male and one female. This being Berne, if you think he wouldn't order them to have sex with each other, you plainly haven't read the books.
-   The Duet evil twin rulers of the Seven Kingdoms in Morgan Llewellyn and Michael Scott's _Arcana_ series.
-   In the _Arcana Chronicles_ series by Kresley Cole, the Lovers card is represented by brother and sister twins. They explicitly… yeah. Even more Squick when it turns out the twins seen before are idealized copies; the brother is ugly as sin, and the sister never really existed because all there is of her is a third eye in his chest from when he absorbed her in the womb.
-   In _The Bad Place_ by Dean Koontz, Violet and Verbena Pollard are twins and very… close. But it seems this kind of thing is par for the course in the Pollard family.
-   Implied in _The Belgariad_. It's really, _really_ difficult to read the opening few hundred pages of _Polgara the Sorceress_ without reading some seriously odd romantic undertones into the relationship between (technically) non-identical twin sisters Beldaran and Polgara. Not only does Beldaran have her sister completely wrapped around her adorably girly little finger, but they're apparently sharing a bed well into adolescence whenever Polgara hasn't run away to live in a tree, and Pol's _explicitly_ possessive anger when Beldaran gets engaged would be a little freakish in its intensity even coming from an actual romantic rival. (_Technically_ technically, they _are_ identical, making it even more fun. The physical difference or two comes from sorcerous manipulation in the womb.)
-   _Blue Bloods Novels_: Twins Jack and Mimi Force are actually the angels Abaddon and Azrael, respectively, and are vampires who are "immortal twins"; that is to say they are bonded forever. This life cycle just happens to have them as blood relatives, which doesn't really seem to stop them—until Schuyler Van Alen steps in.
-   In _Book of the New Sun_, twins Agia and Agilus are found to have an incestuous relationship when Severian enters Agilus' cell the day before his execution, only to find the brother and sister nude and huddled together. Agilus admits, "Everything you suspect is true," the implication being incest.
-   _Children of Dune_ has some pretty heavy overtones about Leto II and Ghanima's relationship at times. From Leto II's own mouth: "Let us pass puberty living in the same house, and all your taboos will be as a red rag waved in the face of a Sandworm." Perhaps mercifully, he undergoes transformation into a sandworm-like creature prior to puberty, thus removing this pairing from consideration. One of the _reasons_ Leto transforms is to avoid the certainty of being maneuvered into this by the Bene Gesserit, who view this "ship" as the only way to get back control of their Kwisatz Haderach program after Jessica sabotaged it by giving birth to Paul.  
    …of course, this transformation doesn't stop Leto from marrying Ghanima later. But both of them are in complete agreement about the fact that there will be no weirdo hanky-panky going on, and that all her children will be bastards sired by a Corrino survivor, specifically the direct descendant of the emperor Leto's father deposed. (Though _they're_ in love anyway, so, good for them.)
-   _Chronicles of the Kencyrath_ plays with twincest with two very different, but parallel, couples.
    -   It first shows up with Gerridon and Jamethiel, where it looks like Villainous Incest: They were twins, consorts, and the most infamous individuals in the entire history of their people.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  But as the story goes on, the Villainous Incest gets Subverted—their twincest isn't portrayed as wrong or as part of their evilness. It was traditional and culturally sanctioned in their time, and their match was arranged by matriarchs trying to breed the chosen ones.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  But because of their infamy, ever since Gerridon and Jamethiel, their people have _mostly kinda_ stopped inbreeding—although the Ardeth still do. But because of the old tradition, their people now see incest—at worst—as a bad idea, not _creepy_ or _immoral_.
    -   The second case is with the protagonist and deuteragonist, Jame and Torisen—another pair of Half-Identical Twins who are shaping up to be twincestuous too. By the fourth book they have UST, have had a few Erotic Dreams and The Big Damn Kiss. (Word of God says yes, it'll eventually happen.) Few people know they're twins, and Jame once wonders, if people knew, whether they would throw them together to Invoke the trope, or make sure they never met again to Defy it.
        
        In their case, twincest is symbolic of self-acceptance. The story plays with the idea of twins as foils, mirrors, other halves of each other. One of the big things keeping them apart is that Jame is a Differently Powered Individual in a world where that's considered dangerous and untrustworthy—and more importantly, so is _Tori_, but he denies it. She reminds him of this, and that's what _really_ bothers him—much more than how this trait is present in _her_, but how it's present in _himself_. He can't be her lover until he accepts her—until he accepts himself.
        
-   Half-Identical Twins Valraven and Pharinet Palindrake are lovers in _The Chronicles of Magravandias_. Pharinet justifies this by claiming that they are one soul in two bodies and that they are the last of a great heritage. They conceive a child, but Pharinet miscarries. That doesn't stop the relationship from destroying their family and their spouses.
-   In _The Faerie Queene_ (1590) the giantess Argante commits twincest with her brother Ollyphant **before they are born!!** They mingle "in fleshly lust" before in the womb and emerge clasped in the act. Also, they're themselves the product of incest.
-   Implied in Edgar Allan Poe's Gothic horror story "The Fall of the House of Usher".
-   There's a rather bizarre example in _Fifth Quarter_. The soul of Bannon is forced to share the body of his twin sister Vree when another man steals his body. Vree goes after her brother's body, and when they find it, they devise a plan that Vree will distract him by seducing him, and Bannon will "push" the interloper out of his body. Partway through, Vree realizes that Bannon is more interested in seducing himself than in getting his body back, and calls it off.
-   In _Forced Perspectives_ by Tim Powers, two of the members of Conrad Chronic's cult were a married couple who secretly were twins who had left their home state far behind and faked new, unrelated identities for themselves so they could get married, because their Twin Telepathy left them feeling that they couldn't really connect to anyone else.
-   A sister/sister version in the _Gaea Trilogy_. April and August Polo are very much a couple despite being identical twins—which the protagonist comments isn't very surprising given that they (and their seven other sisters) are all clones of their "mother" created after her death and raised in a lab with no outside friends.
-   _Ghoul_: Rika and Saxon Hyde engage in twincest as teens. To amp up the Squick, they're the product of Brother–Sister Incest themselves.
-   _The God of Small Things_: Twins Estha and Rahel deal with their Big, Screwed-Up Family eventually by shutting down, withdrawing from the world, and seeking solace only in each other. They no longer share the bond they once did, and the book ends with them trying to reconnect in the only way they feel able—through sex.
-   Referenced by Nick in _Gone Girl,_ though not to the same extent as in The Film of the Book; it's merely mentioned in passing.
    
    \[I\]n high school, there were always rumors that we secretly screwed. Twincest. We were too tight: our inside jokes, our edge-of-the-party whispers. I'm pretty sure I don't need to say this, but you are not Go, you might misconstrue, so I will: My sister and I have never screwed or even thought of screwing. We just really like each other.
    
-   Shelley and Kipling in Judith Hawke's _Heart of a Witch_ get into a _very_ complicated relationship that was hinted at from the beginning with Shelley's possessiveness of her brother. Even more weirdly, this eventually turns into a _threesome_ with Snow, the leader of the coven that they join.
-   _House of Suns_: A twist on this trope: The two protagonists are among thousands of both-sex clones of one woman. They are genetically programmed to be space-explorers, and all are supposed to meet once every 200,000 years to share information. Their progenitor forbid inter-clone romantic relationships and, while sexual encounters are said to occur occasionally, the protagonists' long-term consorting is strongly rebuked by their fellow "siblings."
-   _In Death_: Rudy and Piper Hoffman from _Holiday In Death_ are fraternal twins and longtime lovers. Rudy has admitted that they have tried not to act on the attraction between them and be with other people, but they were miserable because they're attracted only to each other. Piper even had herself surgically sterilized, with Rudy's encouragement. Eve, herself a victim of incestuous rape by her father, is highly squicked out by this, and there are some indications that the relationship has taken a toll on Piper mentally (though it's not entirely clear how much of this is projection on Eve's part).
-   _The Journeyer_ has a pair of twin lovers, Biliktu and Buyantu. It doesn't end well.
-   _Kire_: Jerkass Ørjan is a Shipper on Deck of Trine/Tore much to their and their friend Erik's annoyance. He constantly prints out lists of where siblings can get married.
-   In Donna Tartt's _The Secret History_, Bunny Corcoran references this trope when he suggests that twins Charles and Camilla Macaulay, who share an apartment, are in it for less innocent reasons than just to save money. This offends her greatly and leads her to comment, "You mustn't think I'm sleeping with my brother just because I won't sleep with you." He's right, though, and it's been going on for years.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_:
    -   An Exaggerated Trope with Queen Cersei and Ser Jaime Lannister. An unusual example of an incestuous relationship in serious fiction, as their affection for each other is depicted as genuine, unforced by either partner, long-term, and stable... at least when the story opens. The events of the plot gradually begin to force them apart. But their relationship dates back to childhood, and their mother's maid saw them doing something sexual shortly before their mother's death when they were _seven_. Their bond carried through to adulthood in a Secret Relationship that's a marriage in all but name, with Jaime revealed to be the true father of Cersei's children.
        
        The most interesting thing about their relationship is the personal mythology they've constructed around it. They see themselves as a single person in two bodies. Jaime is convinced that "If I were a woman, I would be Cersei," and Cersei likewise thinks, "If I were a man, I'd be Jaime." In Cersei's mind the bond goes back to before birth. Their little pseudo-religion even has a prophesy: that they'll die together just as they were born together.
        
        **Cersei:** Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We are one person in two bodies. We shared a womb together. He came into this world holding my foot, our old maester said. When he is in me, I feel… whole.
        
    -   Twins Aelor and Aelora Targaryen were married, which wasn't unusual since their family practised incestuous marriage regularly. However despite the Targaryens' predilection for incest, Aelor and Aelora are the only noted case of twincest. All other sets of twins within the family were girl-girl or had one died before marrying age.

-   _Stalking Tender Prey_ by Storm Constantine has, within the first few chapters, a pair of Half-Identical Twins who, because they are hybrids of human, and a very oversexualised variation on the Nephilim, and the only two in the area, and therefore can only express themselves to each other get into twincest an awful lot. Although—let's be fair—most of the main characters do bedhop with most of the other main characters. In fact, the main antagonist, as **the** fallen angel, effectively Satan pretty much gets to bonk 98% of the main characters. Repeatedly.
-   _The Thirteenth Tale_: Emmeline and Adeline's relationship has very strong incestuous overtones.
-   _Time Enough for Love_: Protagonist Lazarus Long relates a story about a twin brother and sister he encountered who were unrelated to each other through a remarkable feat of genetic engineering (they have the same parents and were born of the same womb, but have no more DNA in common than their parents did), and were induced from childhood to form a sexual bond with one another for breeding purposes. As they are slaves, he buys them, frees them, and sets them on the road towards being independent human beings, but they still end up marrying each other and pumping out babies.
-   Thomas Mann's novella "Wälsungenblut" features Siegmund and Sieglind, twins who seem to go everywhere holding hands, and spend a good chunk of the story attending a performance of Wagner's _Die Walküre_. Everything goes as expected.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Played for Laughs in _Another Period_. Beatrice and her twin brother Fredrick are in love and regularly have sex. One episode has Freud (yes, _that_ Sigmund Freud) trying to cure Fredrick of his supposed homosexuality after being Mistaken for Gay. When Freud sees Fredrick having sex with Beatrice, he feels the treatment worked and is unphased at Fredrick being with his sister.
    
    **Dr. Freud:** Frederick, look at you. You are cured. The masculinity training must have done the trick. I officially declare you a non-homosexual.  
    **Beatrice:** Oh, Frederick, I'm so proud of you.  
    **Frederick:** You're not concerned at all with the fact that I'm having sex with my sister?  
    **Dr. Freud:** Seems perfectly natural to me. Carry on.
    
-   In the final episode of _Arrested Development_ its revealed that Michael's twin sister Lindsay is adopted. Her almost _immediate_ reaction to learning they're not related is to try and convince him to marry her. Later Gob — their other brother — comes on to her when he learns about this. She punches him.
-   _Beastmaster_ had a fraternal twin example in its first season.
    
    **Tao:** It says you were born in the same place… and at the same time.  
    **Gem:** You are the first to understand.  
    **Tao:** This has to be wrong.  
    **Nye:** It's not wrong.  
    **Gem:** We know our own story.  
    **Tao:** But it says you were born of the same mother.  
    _\[crickets\]_
    
-   _Degrassi: The Next Generation_: Twins Declan and Fiona Coyne were introduced in season 9 as being "very close." In _Degrassi Takes Manhattan_ Fiona drunkenly kisses Declan at a party in front of everyone to make Declan's girlfriend jealous.
-   Cersei and Jaime Lannister in _Game of Thrones_, the television show being an adaptation of _A Song of Ice and Fire_ (see Literature above). From the DVD Commentary for "The Kingsroad".
    
    **Lena Headey:** Now this is the scene of a previous crime, double misdemeanour…  
    **Mark Addy:** Yeah, a crime against humanity, really…  
    **Lena Headey:** Twincest… which is a lovely phrase.  
    **Nikolaj Coster-Waldau:** It's a great phrase! Twincest…
    
-   _Glee_: Heavily lampshaded — though subverted — with Mason and Madison McCarthy. Apparently the Cheerios have had to tell them that _Flowers in the Attic_ is not a good example for a relationship, and during the "Home" performance in "Homecoming", Mason sings the line "Boy I love my ma and pa / Not the way that I do love you". Kitty explicitly compares them to Jaime and Cersei Lannister. Madison's Clingy Jealous Girl behavior comes off as very twincestuous until we find out that it's actually because she's always been a Parental Substitute to her brother since their actual parents are always out performing rather than being parents. Madison and Mason work it out, and she backs off.
-   It's impossible to watch Maya and Alejandro Herrera in _Heroes_ without thinking about it. After all, Maya killed everyone but Alejandro and herself during her twin brother's wedding after she learned that his bride-to-be was cheating on him...
-   _Intimate_: Identical twins Emil and Oskar are on a double date that takes a disastrous turn when one of the girls turns out to be a former classmate of theirs they used to bully. Oskar, who works as an actor, is afraid of getting cancelled, so they decide to do anything she wants in exchange for her not telling anyone about their past, which includes undressing in front of each other and eventually Oskar sucking off Emil (off-screen). Since the show is a Cringe Comedy, they quickly get over it; a few episodes later, Emil is recounting the incident as a funny anecdote on another date, pulling a "Just Joking" Justification when the girl turns out to be disturbed rather than amused.
-   _It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia_
    -   There was a pair of fraternal male twins that the main characters used to go to school with that were sexually involved. Turns out the entire McPoyle family is one large, ingrown incestual orgy. It's just about the creepiest thing on television.
    -   In "Who Got Dee Pregnant," the gang (minus Dee) think that Dennis was the one who had sex with Dee at the Halloween party (due to Dennis switching costumes with Charlie and Dee with the girl Dennis was trying to hook up with). Dennis is throwing up when they confront Dee, with them telling her she has to go to Mexico to get an abortion—which she states none of them are the father and although she pulled Dennis into the back room, they didn't have sex.
-   It took twelve seasons, but _Law & Order: Special Victims Unit_ finally went there in the episode "Bombshell": Guest star Rose McGowan played a con artist/swinger who was swindling people with her twin brother — and also sleeping with him because they "share a soul." Elliot even calls the trope by name. It was one of the few things that genuinely managed to shock the seasoned SVU detectives.
    -   The possibility of twincest had been used years earlier as a Red Herring with a fourteen-year-old pair of Half-Identical Twins. It... turned out to be something quite different.
-   In an episode of _Medium_, some characters come across a porno that features this.
-   Twincest is the root cause of dark magic on _Midnight, Texas_. Twin witches Theophilus and Hypatia were getting it on until Theo got beheaded. He got better some 800 years later and they got right back at it.
-   The showrunner of _Riverdale_ also worked on _Afterlife with Archie_, and the idea of twincestuous Cheryl and Jason Blossom carried over, even with Jason being a Posthumous Character. The _aesthetic_ of twincest is played with a lot. In the opening scene (their Establishing Character Moment) Cheryl and Jason are framed like a couple: Wearing coordinated clothes, holding hands, going on what looks like an Old-Fashioned Rowboat Date, all with a love song playing. Cheryl once describes Jason as her "soulmate". They are seen in a flashback Sweetheart Sipping. After losing him, Cheryl is referred to as a "Red Widow". There are also shades of twincest in Cheryl's interest in Archie because Archie resembles Jason so much. In episode 10, it's actually called out by name in-universe by Veronica, who is attempting to turn around Cheryl's attempt to bully her and the rest of the gang. However, those accusations appear to be made up on the spot, out of spite, not based on any actual evidence. And despite this aesthetic, it seems that they weren't actually a couple: Jason was determined to be with his third cousin Polly.
-   Implied with Katie and Emily Fitch from _Skins_. More so Katie than Emily; she states that Emily is "hers" and Naomi—Emily's girlfriend—could never love Emily as much she does. It doesn't help that at one point during the end of the twins' episode in series three, when Emily is confronting Katie, someone in the crowd yells out that Emily should kiss her. And in the book, the Fitch family are on holiday in France, and Katie steals Emily's phone so she and Naomi can't stay in touch.
-   In _Witches of East End_ an episode had villains Ivar and Isis who casually mentioned they were twins after making out in front of Freyr. Freyr even uses the phrase twincest to describe it.
-   Definitely played with by John and Edward in _The X Factor_, such as their routine to "Oops I Did It Again", which involved a full re-enactment of the talky bit between Britney and her love interest from the music video ("but I thought the old lady threw it into the sea at the end of the movie"). For anyone masochistic enough to want to see them in action, here is the aforementioned performance.
-   Implied in a _Without a Trace_ storyline which had the team dealing with a pair of murderous twin brothers. Jack point-blank accuses one of them of lusting after the other and even if there isn't a physical relationship, he's certainly obsessed with him and wants to take over his life.

    Magazines 

Playboy would feature numerous sisters posing together over the decades (Tweeds, Sanchez, Morrells) including many sets of twins (Campbells, Van Breeschootens, Shannons, Tennisons, Barbis, Everetts, Bernaolas, Collisons, Tubinos). In 1993 and 1998 they went one further with the Porto and Dahm triplets. These would prove so popular that they would issue 'Sisters' and 'Twins and Sisters Too' Specials.

    Music 

-   Made explicit in Le Sexoflex's cheerfully NSFW song "Twincest." The music video features male and female twins gettin' it on with their siblings, animated by pornographic embroidery.
-   Implied when The Veronicas, a band consisting of twin sisters Lisa and Jess Origliasso, sing "All About Us", a song that, while written by them, was made famous by t.A.T.u., apparently lesbians. The story goes that the song was originally a demo done by the Veronicas; when they couldn't fit it into their lineup, they handed it over to t.A.T.u. Which is not to say that the Veronicas are not twincestuous as hell—see their propensity for taking ridiculously inappropriate-for-sisters pictures. Seriously. Not to mention their music videos. No… THIS video. Also this is the official video for the first link… and a little more twincest sexy
    -   And at least one of them is rumoured to be a lesbian, which would presumably fuel such speculation.
-   Similarly, when Ryan Dan (another twin band, of the male variety) sing mushy romantic duets to one another. Well, at least one can sing soprano very well.
-   More willfully-interpreted Ho Yay: Bill and Tom Kaulitz,<small>◊</small> of German band Tokio Hotel.(New .gif for your pleasure! More lap-bouncing, less arm-tugging)
-   This seems to be the gist of the relationship between the Kagamine twins of Vocaloid, at least among the fandom. Though they _look_ like twins, Crypton originally presented them as such before making them "mirror images," then finally telling the fans to decide for themselves.

    Myths & Religion 

-   In traditional Bali culture, fraternal twins (known as _kembar buncing_) are assumed to have had sex in the womb. If they were born to a poor family, their entire family would be thrown out of town for 42 days and all religious ceremonies would be called off for that period. If they were born to the royal family, however, they would be betrothed to each other.
-   Classical Mythology: In Ovid's _Metamorphoses_, the story of Byblis and Kaunos is a one-sided case. While Byblis likes him and admits her feelings, he is completely disgusted by her affection.
-   Egyptian Mythology:
    -   Osiris, Isis, Set, and Nephthys were all quadruplets who fell in love while still in the womb together, forming two couples: Osiris/Isis, and Set/Nephthys. From the Middle Kingdom on, Anubis, god of mummification, was changed from being the son of Ra to being the son of Osiris and Nepthys.
    -   In some versions of the myth of the divine genealogy, Horus (called "Horus the Elder" o "Haroeris" to distinguish him) was the fifth of the children of Geb and Nut, and this was a way to try to reconcile older accounts in which Horus was a child of Nut. The interesting part comes with the fragments of the "Pyramid Texts" that mention expressly reciprocal sexual encounters between Horus and Seth, something that influenced later accounts where uncle Seth seduced his nephew Horus the Child (also known as Harsiese or Harpocrates). Evidently, the sexual relationship between Seth and Horus was an acknowledged fact during more than 3,000 years of Egyptian religion, even though its details varied.
-   In the Feri Tradition (one of the Neo-Pagan movements), there is a pair of twin gods who basically share all aspects of themselves with each other (and not just in that way), or so claims The Other Wiki. They also don't have a fixed gender.
-   Mesopotamian Mythology: Inanna's relationship with her twin brother Utu is widely interpreted as being very close, with many considering it borderline if not fully incestuous.
-   Norse Mythology:
    -   In "Lokasenna" of the _Poetic Edda_, Loki accuses Freyr and Freyja, the sibling fertility deities, of sleeping together, though it's unclear whether this is "truth" or not. He also mentions that his father conceived them with his own unnamed sister in Vanaheim, and that this relationship between brother and sister may be normal in Vanaheim, but it's taboo among the Aesir. Given that nobody denies these things, it may be safe to assume Loki was telling the truth.
    -   On the other hand, it is possible that many divine pairs with gender-paired names (Frey and Freyja, literally "lord" and "lady", Njörd and possibly Njörun, Yngvi and Ingun, Ullr/Ullinn and Ullin, Fjörgyn and Fjörgynn, that's right, just one more "n" at the end and it changes the gender) were originally divine pairs whose names denoted some kind of complementarity, without necessarily implying any kind of siblinghood. Only later some sort of siblingship was added to their relationship, and given the similarity in their names, the idea of twinship was probably inevitable.
    -   In the _Völsunga saga_, Sigmund is seduced by his sister Signy in disguise, as she believes only in this way she can conceive a son that is strong and loyal enough to help Sigmund avenge their brothers and father on their killer, Signy's treacherous husband Siggeir.
-   The Sioux say twins are the reincarnation of lovers. Whether Everyone Is Bi or Unto Us a Son and Daughter Are Born is another issue.

    Print Media 

-   In 2003, Shane and Sia Barbi sued _Hustler_ for unauthorized use of photos showing "intimate sexual acts between the twin sisters".

    Roleplay 

-   Whilst nothing explicit has happened (_Yet?_), _Survival of the Fittest V3_ characters Lenny and Elizabeth have a whole lot of Subtext in their relationship, prompting a lot of "speculation" amongst members of the board. It isn't clear precisely what relationship the pair have, but it is implied it goes further than being simply siblings. Recently the handler more-or-less addressed this issue, quoting a Fanfic in this first half of one of his posts.

    Theatre 

-   _Bat Boy: The Musical_: Bat Boy and Shelley... _and_ it's an Interspecies Romance too! ...how can you have a twin who's not the same species as you?
-   The entire plot of the rather strange—and very sexual—British queer play _Over There_, where it's a metaphor for East and West Germany. The two-man cast consists of the identical twins Harry and Luke Treadaway, and I can only say that the two certainly aren't uncomfortable with each other.
-   This trope (along with a helping of Creepy Twins) is the premise of Marina Carr's play _Portia Coughlan_. Portia is haunted by her twin brother Gabriel, who drowned himself as a teenager; the fact that she's still obsessed with him fifteen years later (and that Gabriel is referred to as "unnatural") hints heavily towards this, so it's no surprise when she reveals that their relationship was sexual. It's a bit more surprising when her aunt reveals that Portia's parents, too, are half-brother and sister, though neither of them knows it.
-   Part 2 of Richard Wagner's operatic _Ring of the Nibelung_ cycle, _The Valkyrie_, has Siegmund and Sieglinde: Twins separated at birth, who meet as adults and fall in love with each other. It looks like it's setting up to be Surprise Incest, but then subverted when they realize they're twins, but go ahead anyways. Sadly for them, Fricka — goddess of marriage — is very opposed to twincest and adultery. (Adultery because Sieglinde is married, though it was a forced marriage.) Having a goddess against you is never good news, and Siegmund ends up being killed. But Sieglinde is pregnant and gives birth to the legendary hero Siegfried.
-   This trope (actually done sympathetically) is the centerpiece of John Ford's ever-controversial _'Tis Pity She's a Whore_. Unusual in that the creepiness of the setup comes from a) how similar it is to a regular love tragedy, and b) how its lack of acceptance leads Giovanni to snap and rip out Annabella's heart.

    Video Games 

-   Per usual tradition, _Fire Emblem_ doesn't exempt from this in the case of the eighth series, _The Sacred Stones_. Doesn't go with the usual route (their ending put them in the position of Platonic Life-Partners), but the plot, other characters' reactions, and even symbolism all point to twincest vibe between co-protagonists Ephraim and Eirika. Ephraim even Lampshades this in _Fire Emblem Heroes_.
-   _Resident Evil – Code: Veronica_ implies that Alfred's devotion to Alexia goes some way beyond mere intense admiration.
    -   The novelization pretty much states it outright.
-   _Yosuga no Sora_ is the embodiment of this trope with the male lead Haruka having such a relationship with his very twin sister Sora. Among the both of them, Sora was shown more crazy and obsessed with her brother as she constantly fantasizes having sex with him and gets jealous when Haruka interacts with other females.
-   _Metal Gear Solid_, being chock full of Ho Yay moments, certainly didn't shy from playing with this trope. Liquid Snake strips Solid Snake's shirt off while the latter was unconscious, and there was his desperate need to prove that he was the dominant brother. Naturally, it's kicked up to overdrive in the remake. It also certainly didn't help that Liquid was a Large Ham and his voice actor, Cam Clarke, seemed to have an uncanny ability to make the word "brother" sound very erotically incestuous.
    -   Liquid does blatantly say that part of his motivation is that, "in Nature, family members don't mate with each other, but they help each other to survive." Bad biology aside, it's pretty easy to overthink how that would justify him killing his brother instead of 'helping him to survive'
    -   In _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_, when Snake and Liquid are having their final fight, if Snake can't shake liquid off, Liquid will kiss Snake's cheek. However, at the time, Liquid is possessing the body of Revolver Ocelot so YMMV on the level of twincest. Subverted in the fact it's really just Revolver Ocelot impersonating Liquid. The matter is further complicated considering Ocelot had a crush on Snake's identical clone "father", Big boss, which adds Love Father, Love Son into the whole mix. The whole thing can be rather… confusing. Then again, it wouldn't be Metal Gear Solid if it wasn't.
-   _Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly_, with their whole "becoming one with your other twin". One of the key plot elements of the game is the fact that the village use to perform rituals in which the older twin would strangle the younger one, who would then become one spiritually with the older twin and then they'd get to be togeetheeer foreeveeer. This whole "I want to be with only YOU, \[insert other twin's name here\]!!" thing happens with pretty much all of the Twin Shrine Maidens depicted in the game, including but not restricted to Azumi and Akane Kiryu, the protagonist Mio and her sister Mayu, and the antagonist Sae with her sister Yae. Sae seems to be the one with the most weirded-out obsession with her sister, since she seems to all along have fantasized about the day that she'd get to be strangled by Yae by the end of the game you find a crystal left by her that is pretty much along the lines of "Oh Yae, kill me, KIIILLL MEE" like she's getting turned on by the idea.
    -   Not to mention in the promotional commercials, Mio and Mayu are shown in a number of amusingly suggestive poses together. The strangling pose Mio puts herself in above Mayu at the end of the game in Normal mode is also very suggestive.
-   In _King's Quest III_, after Alexander frees his twin sister Rosella and talks to her, he seems attracted to her in a not-so-platonic way. Of course, they were also Separated at Birth.
    -   The same reason was why a lot of Phoenix Online players were scratching their heads at the opening scene of _The Silver Lining_ (a Fan Sequel to the series). Sure, it makes logistical sense to keep the comatose twins in the same room where their respective spouses can act as a final line of defense… but the _same bed?!_

-   Lucjan and Myaja, a brother-and-sister fighting team in _Dragon Age: Origins_, state that "everything they do, they do together." When the PC asks them if that means _everything_, Myaja asks if they want to find out.
-   _Duke Nukem Forever_ has the "Holsom Twins".
-   In _The Sims 2_, if you turn off the switch that prevents incest relationships, twins fall in love very easily, without intervention from the player. Mechanics-wise, it is probably due to their interests and personality traits being alike, therefore making the "perfect" match as far as the game is concerned.
-   Crossing over with the Screw Yourself trope there's Morrigan and Lilith Aensland from _Darkstalkers_. Lilith is a shard of Morrigan's soul but she has been given a separate body. Being succubi that survive on pleasure sorta justifies their relationship.
-   A rather bizarre example in _Drakengard 3_. One's Disciple (basically a bodyguard and a consort combined) is an Opposite-Sex Clone of herself that she created. The clone is addressed as her "Brother" and while they don't do it in the game, the short stories written for the game confirms that they were intimate. Additionally, it’s stated both earlier and later in the game that every Intoner (except Four, who has her own problems) is sexually active, and every one of them has at least some sexually-adjacent action with their Disciple.
-   The relationship of twin sisters Sako and Yuko Katagi of _Criminal Girls_ has elements of Incest Subtext, particularly in regards to Sako and her constant concern for Yuko's well-being. It turns out that Sako has one-sided romantic feelings for Yuko.
-   Junko Enoshima and Mukuro Ikusaba of _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc_ are an interesting case, as it's not even hinted at in the game they're introduced. Subtext appears in the what-if light novel _Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc IF_. It then becomes much more explicit in _Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School_, with Mukuro being quite submissive and blushing whenever insulted by Junko, before Junko violently pulls it out of subtext and into text by slapping Mukuro on the butt (knocking Mukuro to the ground) and doing un-advertiser friendly things to Mukuro with a boot through Mukuro's skirt. It is not depicted as a healthy relationship at all, as Junko essentially treats Mukuro as a Sex Slave of sorts.
-   In _Super Danganronpa Another 2_, this is revealed to be the case with Kanade Otonokoji. Her intense sexual desire for her twin sister Hibiki led to her killing and maiming over 60 people for getting too close to her, including _their parents and their dog_, all while manipulating and conditioning Hibiki to be totally dependent on her. She even conditioned Hibiki to go into a sort of a blank state when given the right trigger, where she'll obey Kanade's every command. A fact she used to make her murder Setsuka, the one person who acted like a Cool Big Sis to her, and to revel in Hibiki's despair before the two of them are executed. Suffice to say, the rest of the group is absolutely disgusted by this revelation.
-   In _Sisterly Bliss ~Don't Let Mom Find Out~_, both siblings, Ichika and Futaba Sakura are very close and secretly in love with each other. At the end, they get together when they learn about the other's feelings.

    Web Animation 

-   Fanart of _Happy Tree Friends_ Raccoon Twins Lifty and Shifty getting really, _really_ close is unsurprisingly popular, especially Gijinkas. Shifty is the one with the hat.
-   Implied in the machinima _Lilium -Sims 2_, which revolves around a girl who is in love with her brother. Horitio and Isis aren't specifically noted as twins but they're near identical (with only their sexes and eye colours being different) and are the same age.

    Webcomics 

-   Fraternal twins Lucy and Fisk in _Better Days_. Whether it happened more than once is a matter of debate. Lucy at least continues to have more than sisterly feelings for her brother well into college. Given that there are several early Naylor porn-folios centered around Lucy and Fisk, it seems likely that they were at least originally intended to have a long-running relationship (as their counterparts in _Badly Drawn Kitties_ did until his departure) …but then again, those portfolios are stricken from the record as far as Naylor is considered, mostly because the copyright notices affirm that Lucy is not his original creation.
-   Heavily implied of the Subway Masters in _Black Adventures_ (the Subway is not affected by a power outage because "it runs on our _bruderliebe_"), and accidentally the case for Black's crush on White when she's revealed to be his twin. In the latter case, it's used for Ship Sinking rather than titillation.
-   Rick and Kate in _Concession_, though that is not by any means the only way they are messed up. Also Joel's connection to his sister's ghost seems to border on this, though she died too young for anything to really happen.
-   The twin lawyers in _DevilBear_ have a strong vibe of this going. Given that they are infernal servants and Hot as Hell demons, it's not unexpected.
-   Invoked with Jasprosesprite^2 and Davepetasprite^2 in _Homestuck_. The Rose and Dave parts of them are just as squicked by the idea as the "main" Rose and Dave would be, but they acknowledge that cats don't worry about that sort of thing and trolls are born from an "incestuous slurry", so the Jasper and Nepeta parts don't see the problem.
-   Succubus twins Giselle and Alizee in _Leth Hate_, although not voluntary on Giselle's part.
-   Hiroki and Masuji from _Seiyuu CRUSH!_ are hinted to have a more-than-brotherly relationship, and this is confirmed in scene 13.

    Web Original 

-   _Rogues (End Master)_: The main character and his twin sister are often accused of this while living in their home village of Teckleville. In one of the Holgard paths, they actually do unknowingly sleep with one another while at a masquerade.
-   In _Tea, Biscuits and Incest_, Makayla finds out that her ex-boyfriend Jayden is her long-lost twin. Doesn't help that he's also sleeping with their father.
-   A lot of fanart depicts Hacchan and Secchan, the Moe Anthropomorphisms of Windows 98 First Edition and Second Edition respectively, together. This one's safe for work, but most others aren't. And even those that don't depict the 98 twins being mutually attracted to each other often have Secchan acting Yandere for Hacchan.
-   A vast thread on the RPGNet forums, covering creepy gamers, had a poster effectively troll the discussion by promising to elucidate on a story of creepy gamers that involved twincest. The rumored story turned out to be disappointing, though it did get an airing.

    Web Videos 

-   _Critical Role_, Campaign 1: Both entirely averted and parodied with the Half-Identical Twins Vex and Vax. The topic only comes up once in-series, when Vax is discussing his love interest, Keyleth:
    
    **Vex:** _(clearly jealous)_ Yes, yes, Keyleth is so fucking beautiful, I get it.  
    **Vax:** Well so are you, but what the fuck am I gonna do with that? Geez, you're fucking weird!
    

    Western Animation 

-   Andy and Ollie Pesto of _Bob's Burgers_ are prepubescent but definitely headed in this direction.
-   _Robot Chicken_:
    
    -   The show has a long-running gag portraying the Bush twins, Barb and Jenna, as hard-partying _Girls Gone Wild_ types, often ending with the two of them making out.
    -   During the _Star Wars_ special, there was the inevitable skit involving Luke and Leia in bed.
    
    **Leia:** That was so wrong.  
    **Luke:** _\[grins\]_
    
-   _The Simpsons_: In "The D'oh-cial Network", the Winklevoss twins make a brief cameo in which they compete against Patty and Selma at the Olympics. The scene ends with Cameron and Tyler making out.
-   _Tigtone_: The king and queen of Propecia are opposite sex conjoined twins who do have a sex life.
-   Invoked in _Young Justice (2010)_. Superboy and Miss Martian go undercover as two twins. While in their disguise they make out, and it takes a while for the latter to transform back into her normal self. Much to the horror of Icicle Jr.
