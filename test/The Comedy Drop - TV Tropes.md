Drop him like a bad habit, Diana.

**Cindy:** What happened to Sully?  
**Matrix:** I let him go.

Comedy can take on many forms, from humorous anecdotes, pratfalls, and anything in between.

Sometimes physical comedy is used to establish that a character is a Butt-Monkey, The Chew Toy, or The Friend Nobody Likes.

And one of the easiest ways to do that is to drop them.

Now, since dropping someone in real life can often result in injury, this can also show the person doing the dropping to be engaged in Comedic Sociopathy.

Typically, this takes one of three basic forms.

The first is someone carrying another person in a Princess Carry or some other method, and then unceremoniously dumping them on the ground, or, if they're lucky, a bed or sofa. Usually the person doing the dropping either has a look of disgust or weariness on their face, either from physical exertion or from having to deal with a person they consider a figurative burden as well as a literal one.

The second form is that someone has fallen and is already injured, and someone goes to pick them up, only to drop them again while distracted by someone or something more important or attractive.

The third is a person stating that they'll catch someone, and then failing to do so, either from distraction, indifference, or a complete lack of skill at catching. This type often overlaps with Trust-Building Blunder.

As this trope is generally played for comedy, it is rare for serious injury to result from the dropping (though sometimes the dropped character is never seen again, which can lead to What Happened to the Mouse? with a side of Fridge Horror that they may be dead, now).

Related to Unhand Them, Villain!. Compare and contrast Dramatic Drop, where objects are dropped at a moment of shock.

As real-life dropping can result in permanent injury, No Real Life Examples, Please!.
