"The Accolade" by Edmund Blair-Leighton

_"In the name of the Warrior I charge you to be brave. In the name of the Father I charge you to be just. In the name of the Mother I charge you to defend the young and innocent. In the name of the Maid I charge you to protect all women."_

Many medieval and fantasy stories in the European tradition feature a Knight in Shining Armor, who in the name of chivalry sets out on a heroic quest such as slaying a fire-breathing dragon that's been terrorizing the country, or rescuing a princess who’s been kidnapped by an evil sorcerer. But where do knights come from? Unlike ownership of a fief or the title of royal prince, knighthood is not something you receive at birth, or that you can inherit from a previous owner. First you have to earn it, and then the person in charge has to give it to you in a ceremony that follows the appropriate traditions and protocols.

Originally the word knight was a job description with no connotation of high birth or status: it merely meant a warrior who was skilled and wealthy enough to fight on horseback, and owed their service to someone powerful. The English word knight is derived from an Anglo-Saxon word for "servant", while most other European languages use a word meaning "horseman" (e.g. German _Ritter_<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  or French _chevalier_).<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  The word began to take on new meaning in response to social changes at the dawn of The High Middle Ages: the flourishing of merchants and cities gave them new wealth and power to compete with the nobility, while the increasingly independent Catholic Church became more assertive in trying to curb the misbehavior of the warrior class. In order to maintain their distinction from the class of people who worked, and to reconcile the violent nature of war with the ideals of courtesy and piety, the nobility and gentry absorbed the military role of knighthood while turning it into a more exclusive and regulated order.

A noble child would usually start as a page in order to learn discipline and manners, spend their teenage years as an arming squire taking care of a master's horse and equipment, and when they had grown into a fine warrior, they would be recognized as having earned their spurs. Not everyone became a knight through such careful grooming, though. Commoners could be rewarded with knighthood for exceptional service, and rulers facing a shortfall of heavy cavalry would sometimes make laws requiring anyone who possessed a certain amount of property to present themselves to be knighted whether they liked it or not. In any case, being knighted was often the most important day of one's life.

In the early days all that was needed was the dubbing, but the protocol quickly grew more elaborate. Expect a formal ceremony in a Standard Royal Court with masses of witnesses. In Real Life, these were highly religious events that involved the new knight having a night vigil (sleepless time with praying) in the chapel, ritualized bathing for cleansing, wearing certain colours (such as white) and a final blessing from The Church near the end. You'll see little of this because we don't have time for that. The actual event could go on for days, so again this is often shortened for time. But keep in mind that the shortened version also existed: a medieval noble or ruler serving as a field commander would often promote several deserving commoners and squires immediately before a battle, since one would go to great lengths not to fail his lord or sully his reputation in his first combat as a knight. Countries where the tradition of knighting is still kept up in modern times have also generally streamlined the ceremony somewhat.

Knighting is probably most well known in the public mind as the moment when a figure such as the true king, The High Queen or another knight taps the squire on the shoulders with the flat side of the blessed sword. Originally, any knight could make another. This power was slowly moved into the hands of great nobles, and then finally reserved to the Monarch alone. The more formal a court, the fewer people will have the authority. Some women in history were granted knighthood, despite the male-dominated nature of the order. For a long time, however, women were not allowed to perform the knighting ceremony; this only changed when the authority to create knights was restricted to the monarch, which meant that a queen had to be able to do it if she was the sovereign.

The final act in the dubbing usually involves the new knight swearing their loyalty to The Good Kingdom. Oftentimes, when someone is knighted, the superior giving the knighting punches them or strikes some other kind of blow, the last such blow that the new knight is expected to take without some form of retribution. A variant of this may happen during the dubbing, when the person is hit with the flat of the sword _almost_ hard enough to be winded or knocked over. At certain times in history the pivotal moment was when the officiants girded the sword around the initiate's waist and fastened golden spurs to his ankles. Again, you may not see all of these details or variations in a given show. The ceremony is often followed by The Tourney to celebrate the occasion and give the newly created knight a chance to demonstrate their prowess.

The ceremony is likely to appear even in works set in The Low Middle Ages, and the degree of elaboration tends to have only tenuous relationship to the alleged era of a work.

Subtrope of Initiation Ceremony. Related to Awesome Moment of Crowning and Standard Hero Reward. It's tenuously related to white knighting, where a person acts to achieve the glory of being seen as a knight-like figure, not because of any personal chivalry, but because of the personal benefits it will bring.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Code Geass_ Suzaku is knighted four times in total.
    -   The first time, by Princess Euphemia, is a much-hyped event with all due ceremony and such. This is because it is as much a political issue as a personal promotion - he becomes personal guard to a princess, and her choice of him adds to tensions between Britannians and Elevens.
    -   Then by Cornelia, following her battle with Lelouch at the Viceroy's palace at the end of season 1. This is more ad hoc - she uses her fingers instead of a sword, because she didn't have one, and says "this is a little informal". This was more to give Suzaku her blessing and authority to catch Zero. It is also tied to her guilt over fighting with Euphemia over her choice, a fight they never had a chance to get over before Euphemia was killed.
    -   His promotion to Knight of Seven, which he requested it as a reward for a great deed in service to his emperor. This ceremony is not shown, but it can be presumed that there was one.
    -   His promotion to Knight of Zero is less ad hoc, but rather more unconventional because such a position has been created by Lelouch simply to place Suzaku above any other knight in Britannian history - and since the Knights of the Rounds are second only to the Britannian Imperial Family, this makes him practically royalty.
-   Supporting materials and titles of address show that practically all of OZ's combat veteran officers in _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing_ were given some rank of peerage prior the events of the series, though it's most obvious with "Lady" Une and "Lighting Count" Zechs. Presumably they came from the various shadowy royal families that are supposed to make up the Romefeller Foundation.
-   In _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, after he rescued Princess Arika, she informally knighted Nagi while they were preparing for the epic final battle. He kneeled in respect, swore his loyalty and all that jazz. Cool scene considering he rarely ever acted seriously.
    -   Prior to this, every time she had addressed him as "my knight," he'd protested that he was a mage, not a knight. Perhaps she got annoyed and decided this would shut him up...
-   In the third season of _The Familiar of Zero_, Saito, having proven _many_ times how valuable an asset to Tristain he is, is presented with a title of knighthood by Henrietta, formally making him a noble.
-   After an important battle in the Golden Age arc of _Berserk_, Griffith is knighted by the King of Midland. Shortly after that, his knighthood is stripped from him and he's thrown in the dungeon to be slowly tortured to death for deflowering the princess.
-   In the _K_ prequel novel _Lost Small World_ (and subsequent manga and stage play adaptations), Saruhiko Fushimi's installation into the Blue Clan, Scepter 4, is shown, and it takes the form of a knighting. He kneels before the Blue King in front of all the troops, and swears an oath, after which the King taps him on the shoulders with the sword, and presents the sword to him. When he takes the sword, he receives his Blue aura and his new powers with it. During the ceremony, he thinks about how different it is from the Red Clan's installation, which involves taking the Red King's hand while his hand is on fire - you get in if you don't get burnt.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Calvin and Hobbes_: Parodied in one short story arc where Calvin renames himself "Calvin the Bold" and refuses to answer to people who omit the descriptor. His dad quickly puts an end to this nonsense by using his authority to give him a much less endearing title.
    
    **Calvin's Dad:** By the finite patience vested in me, I hereby dub thee "Mud." You may rise.  
    **Calvin:** My name is _MUD?!_
    

    Fan Works 

-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fanfiction:
    -   In _Chrysalis Visits The Hague_, this happens twice — first when Chrysalis makes her lawyer Estermann formally pledge loyalty to her in her jail cell, and later when Princess Luna takes the ICMP investigator Edith Saric (almost literally) under her wing as she is being booted out of the UN mission. The parallels are very apparent, particularly when the to-be-knight is told to kneel and hesitates.
    -   In _The Flash Sentry Chronicles_ After defeating Longhorn, saving Fluttershy, and learning to let go of his anger instead of letting it control him and seek revenge, Iron Core is knighted by the four alicorns as the newest Royal Knight, and is dubbed by his mentor Skybreaker as the Metal Guardian. Later in _The Knight of Friendship_, this finally happens to Flash Sentry, after he passes his final test. He is knighted by the alicorns too and dubbed The Knight of Friendship by his mentor Grand Hoof.
    -   In _Harmony Theory_ Rainbow Dash gets knighted after helping defeat Nightmare Umbra. However this is done not as a reward, but as a political tactic to draw attention away from Star Fall's engagement to the prince. In this universe, knighthood is another form of nobility, and giving the knight an estate to manage is included in the ceremony.
-   In _The Night Unfurls_, Kyril is knighted by The High Queen Celestine for his contribution to putting an end to the Forever War against Olga. As _Sir_ Kyril Sutherland, he would be able to formally serve her kingdom and aid the people of Eostia. This has yet to happen in the remastered version, however.
-   _The Parselmouth of Gryffindor_: In a mock ceremony, Fred and George Weasley knight Hermione, Ron, Harry, Maximilian and Hedwig as "Knights of the Order of the Junior Marauders", with all of Gryffindor House present.
-   In _The Crown Atomic_, John F. Kennedy gained the title of Duke of Vancouver from Edward VIII after the wedding with Princess Elizabeth.
-   _Maria Campbell of the Astral Clocktower_: After she spends a few weeks wandering the countryside righting wrongs, Maria tops it off by dismantling a Sex Slave ring. The princes, exasperated at her constant I Was Just Passing Through excuses, invite her to the capital to "get what she deserves." Maria thinks she's going to be executed right up until the literal second that the king knights her instead. She politely turns down the knighthood three times before accepting it, truly believing she did nothing exceptional.
    
    Some students tried to get her to tell them the truth behind the so-called 'Lady Maria' rumors, but Maria honestly didn't know how those had gotten started at all. She tried to explain what had really happened, but that didn't seem to help quell the stories, only adding her version of events to the cycle. Her judgement quickly became distorted, with her being depicted as some pure, chivalrous figure who had refused the elevation three times or some such nonsense. This told with a straight face by people she knew had actually been there!
    

    Films — Animation 

-   _Cars 2_ has Mater knighted by Queen Elizabeth.
-   _Cinderella_: When the King believes that the Prince has proposed to Cinderella, he grabs a sword so he can knight the Grand Duke as thanks for keeping them together. But when the Duke reveals the truth, that Cinderella had fled the ball, the enraged King tries to execute him with it.
    
    **King:** I hereby dub you Sir... Um, er, by the way, what title _would_ you like?  
    **Duke:** Sire... she got away!  
    **King:** Sir Shegotaway? A peculiar title, but if that's what you... _She WHAT?!_
    
-   In _Shrek the Third_, Shrek knights some unlucky dude with rather messy results (he didn't train the sword-tapping-shoulder part enough).

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Austin Powers in Goldmember_ begins with Austin about to be knighted by the Queen of England. He gets depressed when his father doesn't come to the ceremony.
-   _Avengers: Infinity War_: After two films of Peter Parker trying to convince Tony Stark to let him become an Avenger, Peter tags along when Tony jumps onto a spaceship leaving Earth. Since Tony has no way of sending him home, he rolls his eyes and taps Peter on his shoulders in turn like he's knighting him, saying "Okay kid, now you're an Avenger." It takes Peter a second to realize what happened.
-   _Black Knight_ ends with Martin Lawrence's character being dubbed Sir Jamal "Sky" Walker, the Black Knight... just before the Queen shouts "clear!" and hits him with defibrillator paddles. It was All Just a Dream... or was it?
-   In _Braveheart_, William Wallace gets knighted after the Battle of Stirling.
-   In _The Court Jester_, one of the most famous sequences has the lead character taking part in a grand formal ceremony with elaborate marches and chants. However, the King becomes impatient and orders the participants to speed it up. Suddenly, everyone goes into double time with every detail and Danny Kaye's character can't keep up. His pants don't seem to be able to keep up either.
-   Sir Uryens knights Arthur in _Excalibur_, with Excalibur, because he can't surrender to a mere squire. Arthur later knights Percival, hurriedly, in the same fashion.
-   In the 1937 Armada film _Fire Over England_, Michael Ingolby (Laurence Olivier) is knighted by Elizabeth I (Flora Robson); in _The Sea Hawk_ (1940), Francis-Drake-Expy Geoffrey Thorpe (Errol Flynn) is knighted by the same queen (and the same actress).
-   In _Johnny English_, the titular agent requests to be knighted at the end of the film, having thwarted the plans of the Big Bad.
-   _Kingdom of Heaven_ gives us Balian (Orlando Bloom) being knighted by his dying father Baron Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson, he seems to always die) and receiving a backhand slap to the face. Later in the movie, Balian does the same with every soldier defending Jerusalem (He only slaps the nearest one, else it could have got time consuming).
-   In _King Ralph_, Ralph accidentally cuts the man he is knighting, nearly taking an ear off, because he is distracted. Later, after stepping down as king and being knighted himself, Ralph covers both of his ears while having the sword passed over him.
-   William receives his sword tap at the end of _A Knight's Tale_ by Edward, the Black Prince of Wales, as repayment for William's honorable actions towards him.
    
    **Prince Edward:** If I may repay the kindness you once showed me: (_nods_) Take a knee.
    
-   In _The Last Duel_, Jean de Carrouges gets knighted during a military campaign in Scotland.

-   _National Treasure_: A young Ben Gates, after hearing the story of the Templar Treasure, asks his grandfather if they are knights, to which he replies yes, if he'd like to be. Ben is then knighted by his grandfather, beginning his lifelong search for the Templar Treasure.
-   In _On Guard_ (1997 film adaptation of _Le Bossu_), Lagardère (Daniel Auteuil) isn't a noble by birth unlike the novel and previous adaptations, and he gets knighted by the Duke Philippe de Nevers (Vincent Perez) when accompanying the latter on the way to Caylus.

    Folklore 

-   _Robin Hood_ is knighted by King Richard after the events of many versions of the legend. In the versions where he _isn't_, it's usually because he was already "Sir Robin of Locksley" (or even "Robert, Earl of Huntingdon") before the story started, so he just gets his title _back_.

    Literature 

-   _The Afterward_: The king knights Kalanthe as part of the finale.
-   At the end of _Baptism of Fire_, Geralt is knighted by Queen Meve of Rivia after Geralt's hanse wanders into the middle of the battle at the bridge of the Yaruga river and turns the tide of the battle against Nilfgaard. Fittingly, Geralt is dubbed as Sir Geralt Of Rivia, basically ascending his Appropriated Appellation.
-   _The Black Arrow_: Dick Shelton is knighted by Lord Plantagenet, leader of the House of York, as a token of gratitude for helping him win the Battle of Shoreby.
-   In _A Brother's Price_ Jerin's grandfather Alannon was a prince, so Jerin's grandmothers had to wait until they were knighted (for heroism in war) to marry him, as mere commoners couldn't marry a prince. Apparently, their sense of propriety didn't stop them from keeping their husband a secret from his remaining family ... of course, since _his_ branch of the family was executed for treason by the other branch, he didn't see much of a point in getting in touch with the family, either.
-   In C. S. Lewis's _The Chronicles of Narnia_ books:
    -   In _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_, Aslan knights Peter after he kills the wolf. Peter knights Edmund after the battle.
    -   In _Prince Caspian_, Peter knights Caspian, and Caspian knights several of his followers right after.
-   In _The Dinosaur Lords_, after they distinguish themselves in the battle against the horde and save the day, all commanders of the Fugitive Legion are made peers of the Empire.
-   In the _Discworld_ book _Jingo_, Sam Vimes' status as a knight becomes very important, as it enables him to create his own military unit out of Watch members in a time of crisis. When a noble opposes his status he counters each argument, most notably the claim that a knight must spend the night watching his armor.
    
    **Vimes:** A man who doesn't watch his armor around here he's got none left in the morning.  
    **Rust:** _In prayer._  
    **Vimes:** Oh, yes. Not a night has gone by without me thinking, "Ye gods, I hope I get out of this alive."
    
-   _Don Quixote_: This is parodied; the title character insists that an innkeeper (who he thinks is a castellan) knight him after he has watched his armor in the castle chapel — that is, in the stable of the inn. (See also under _Theatre_.) This shows that Don Quixote may be mad, but he knows exactly how the ceremony must go.
-   In the Dresdenverse, the Knighting of the Winter Knight is... unusual to say the least. Mab screws him on a table in front of all the Fae after he kills the previous Knight in cold blood and drips his blood on said table.
-   In Chivalric Romance _Guy of Warwick_, after his love Felice scorns the notion that she would marry a lowly mewling squire — she would marry a great knight, mind you, without even asking his father's name — Guy is knighted before he sets out on adventures to become a great knight.
-   _Honor Harrington_ has shown two short form knightings on page, once for Honor herself at the end of _Honor of the Queen_ and again for Aivars Terekhov in _Storm From the Shadows_. Interestingly, both Honor and Terekhov had no warning, although it's unlikely either was really surprised in light of their actions at Yeltsin's Star and Monica, respectively.
-   In Debra Doyle and James MacDonald's _Knight's Wyrd_, Will's knighting is one of the opening events of the story.
-   In _Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn_, Simon is knighted atop the Stone of Farewell for his deeds in recovering the magical sword Thorn for Prince Josua. The ceremony is preceded by a night of fasting and vigil, and is used by Josua not merely to promote a young man who has served him, but to inspire hope in his ragtag band of refugees. Not long thereafter, Simon is forced to prove his knighthood directly by leading a troop of soldiers in a desperate battle to defend their home.
-   In Poul Anderson's _A Midsummer Tempest_, when Prince Rupert returns to King Charles, the king immediately knights the soldier who accompanied him. (He first asks him to swear loyalty to the throne — and then explains it's just part of the ceremony and not a doubt of his loyalty.)

-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_ uses a bit of both. After one major battle it's mentioned that so many people were knighted as a result it took ages for the three available knights of the Praetorian Guard to dub them all, and that those knights had stood vigil in roughspun robes at the church the whole night and then walked barefoot to the palace, leaving most if not all with bleeding feet (but they all still stood proudly). However, "any knight can make a knight", and the ritual of anointing a would-be knight with seven oils by a priest is just a formality.
    -   In an introspective mood, Jaime remembers how he was knighted by Ser Arthur Dayne, The Sword of the Morning. Dayne actually used his family's famed greatsword, Dawn to do the deed, and cut right through Jaime's tunic with even the lightest tap. He justified it, saying that 'blood is the seal of our devotion'.
    -   There is also the Brotherhood Without Banners, a band of Just Like Robin Hood types led by Ser Beric Dondarrion, a knight who uses this rule to promote his entire army, though few actually use the honorific of "ser" outside the band.
    -   Officially, the North does not have many knights because most northmen follow the Old Gods, and knighthood in Westeros is very much a product of the Faith of the Seven. Not that this makes them any less worthy of honor on the battlefield (and in practical terms, Northern heavy cavalry fills the battlefield role of the knight just fine).
    -   In the short story _The Hedge Knight_, the squire Raymun Fossoway volunteered to fight for Sir Duncan the Tall in the trial of seven. The problem is, you have to be a knight to do that, so he had to be knighted on the spot by Ser Lyonel Baratheon, just before the start of the trial. (And thus a new side-branch of his house, the Fossoways of New Barrel, was born.) Speaking of Ser Duncan, by the way, there is the strong implication that he was never actually knighted (because the knight he was the squire of passed away before he could do that), which seems to be reason why Dunk was reluctant to knight Raymund _himself_ in the aforementioned scene...
-   The appointment of Dominion Lords in _The Sovereign Stone_ trilogy is largely drawn from this. New elements would probably be the magic armor and the gods descending from heaven personally appoint them.
-   _The Sword Of Saint Ferdinand_ starts with Álvar Pérez de Castro, a nobleman who commanded a part of the Castilian forces, knighting co-protagonist García de Vargas prior to the Battle of Jerez.
-   Occurs in the _Tortall Universe_. There's a vigil and a formal dubbing by the King—in between that, you get to be tested by the Chamber of the Ordeal, a sentient room that's somewhere between Face Your Fears and Psychological Torment Zone. Squires who are mentally unsuitable (or rotten human beings) are broken by it, and even those who pass come away with mental scars. Alanna of _Song of the Lioness_ and Keladry of _Protector of the Small_ both undergo the ceremony.
-   In _The Traitor Son Cycle_, this is a Once per Episode occurence, as the Red Knight has a habit of knighting people before or after major battles as a show of trust or reward. It even involves the traditional "the last punch you'll ever accept" pat on the arm.
-   Stasheff's _A Wizard in Chaos_ has the 'any knight can make another' with Magnus Gallowglass, the son of two noble lines, but without any official title other than the knightly 'sir', granting it to the companion who has traveled with him throughout his last three adventures. Also includes the extra 'final punch' option.
-   _A Wizard in Rhyme_: In Christopher Stasheff's _His Majesty's Wizard_, the protagonist undergoes the full ritual, with vigil, bath, and an examination on the laws of chivalry; finally he receives his sword tap from the Emperor in the Mountain. He does not have to take a punch.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Beverly Hillbillies_: In "War of the Roses", Jethro gets knighted by Jane Hathaway masquerading as Elizabeth I. The honor is given as Jethro had vanquished Colonel Dumbarton of the neighboring castle. At the same ceremony, Granny is assured by "The Queen" that the stain on the family honor will be rectified, and that everyone in England will know that the Clampett Clan _did not_ run out on the "War of the Roses. Jed Clampett also takes the opportunity to return the deed to Canada - having purchased the country from the Queen's minister a few episodes before. Believe it or not, this all Makes Sense In Context.
-   In the _Babylon 5_ episode "A Late Delivery From Avalon", King Arthur<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  knights G'Kar as the first of a new Round Table after the ambassador takes his side against a gang of thugs.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   In the original series story arc "The Crusade", the Doctor's companion Ian Chesterton is knighted as "Sir Ian of Jaffa" (Jaffa being where the knighting took place) by King Richard the Lionheart.
    -   In "Tooth and Claw", the Doctor and Rose are knighted as "Sir Doctor of TARDIS" and "Dame Rose of the Powell Estate" by Queen Victoria... then immediately exiled.
-   _Game of Thrones_: The night before the Battle for Winterfell, Jaime noting that "any knight can make another knight" decides to knight Brienne, finally fulfilling her dream
    
    **Jaime:** In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave. In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just. In the name of the Mother, I charge you to defend the innocent. Arise, Brienne of Tarth. A knight of the seven kingdoms.
    
-   One episode of _Kaamelott_ is centered around it, when King Arthur realizes that Perceval was never officially dubbed and you can't be at the Round Table if you aren't one. Perceval also finds the word "adoubement" (dubbing) cumbersome and wish they would call it "chevalierisation" (knighterization).
-   _The Mandalorian_, "Guns for Hire": After spending some time enjoying Grogu's company, before he leaves, the Duchess of Plazir-15 anoints him as a knight of the Ancient Order of Independent Regencies. Notably, she uses an actual metal longsword to do the classic touch over the shoulders, showing both the gesture and weapon exist in _Star Wars_. (Thankfully, she's careful around Grogu's ears.)
-   _Merlin_:
    -   Uther is seen knighting some men. Then Emilia Fox shows up. The knighting of Lancelot is interesting, to say the least. Lancelot arrives to Camelot to try out for knighthood. He sees Arthur personally sparring with prospective knights, but each is holding back for fear of hurting the prince, much to Arthur's annoyance. Unlike them, Lancelot doesn't hold back and eventually knocks Arthur to the ground. Angry, Arthur gets up, walks towards him, tells Lancelot to get on his knees, grabs a sword in a menacing way... and knights him. Later, Lancelot renounces his knighthood by admitting that he's not of noble blood (a prerequisite).
    -   A very heartwarming example happens in late season 3 when Arthur knights Lancelot, Elyan, Gwaine, and Percival to thank them for remaining loyal to him. Though this knighting is technically unofficial since Uther would never sanction commoners as knights, Arthur ends up taking over shortly thereafter and officially removes the "noble blood" prerequisite.
-   Parodied in a short _Morecambe and Wise_ sketch when Ernie received a knighthood from the Queen and, as she tapped him with the sword, it pulled off his wig.
-   _The Odd Couple_: In "The Princess", Oscar romances the princess of a small European nation. She was allowed to give out x number of knighthoods a year, but they didn't mean anything since she was an in-name-only leader of her country. She used her last one of the year to knight a homeless man.
-   In _Star Trek: The Next Generation_, Worf's reward for helping Gowron at the beginning of the Klingon Civil War to finally have his discommendation revoked in a simple formal ceremony.

    Radio 

-   In the _Adventures in Odyssey_ episode "Isaac the Chivalrous", a knight named Sir William follows Isaac out of the Imagination Station, a machine that's _supposed_ to only be virtual reality. But after Isaac proves himself (surprisingly, by _not_ fighting, and Turning the Other Cheek), Sir William knights him.
    
    **Sir William:** By the sword Rhiannon, I dub thee Isaac the Chivalrous, Knight of Odyssey, Keeper of the Scriptures, Defender of the Faith. Rise, **Sir** Isaac.
    

    Tabletop Games 

-   It's not uncommon for _Dungeons & Dragons_ Player Characters (particularly in the Rules Cyclopedia) to be knighted if the game goes on for long enough. Usually the knighting happens when a PC hits 9th level, which in those days was considered "Name Level".
-   The card Dub from the Domanaria set of _Magic: The Gathering_ depicts this, and also does it to your creatures in game (it's an Enchantment which in addition to boosting the enchanted creature's power and toughness, makes them have the type Knight in addition to other types.)

    Theatre 

-   In _The Bible: The Complete Word of God (abridged)_, God tells Abraham that give him his foreskin will establish a covenant between them: "You will be a knight in my army. I will dub thee Sir Cumcision."
-   In _Camelot_, the first act culminates with Arthur's investing of the Knights of the Round Table, including his favorite Lancelot, under the sword Excalibur. At the very end of the show, when Arthur knows his own battle is lost, he knights a boy as Sir Tom of Warwick and tells him to run off so he can live to tell the tale.
-   Parodied in the song "Knight of the Woeful Countenance" in _Man of La Mancha_. Don Quixote insists that an innkeeper (who he thinks is a king) knight him.

    Video Games 

-   _Bug Fables_: In the end of the game, Queen Elizant II knights Team Snakemouth as her Royal Blades for their great role in finding the Everlasting Sapling (its destruction aside) and defeating the Wasp King.
-   Frog/Glenn gets knighted in the ending cinema of _Chrono Trigger_. And his theme is playing throughout this, making it even more awesome.
-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   Elincia knights Ike in _Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance_.
    -   Pelleas appoints Micaiah as General of the Daein Army in _Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn_, but the ceremony (and the result) is much the same.
    -   Princess Nyna trusting Prince Marth with the Fire Emblem in _Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem_ could be seen as this.
-   In _Kingdom Hearts 3D \[Dream Drop Distance\]_, Sora gets this in Country of the Musketeers from Princess Minnie, being named a Royal Musketeer officially at the conclusion of that world's story. That said, given that it is in the King's past, but nonetheless still in the Sleeping Worlds, whether or not this title was actually given in that time period is uncertain.
-   _Mass Effect_ has the Spectre induction ceremony, complete with rousing music and stirring speeches. Getting reinstated (both times) is much more underwhelming. It's notable because Shepard is the first human to be inducted into the organization, and various diplomats stop what they're doing to watch the ceremony.
-   At the end of _Mitsumete Knight_, the Asian (aka the player character) gets knighted by the King of the country he fought for as a mercenary, in recompense for winning the war. The Knight Title he gets depends of his Level and number of Medals : from highest title to lowest, there's Holy Knight, Silver Knight, White Knight, Black Knight, Red Knight, Purple Knight, Blue Knight, and Semi-Knight.
-   The PC of _Neverwinter Nights 2_ is hastily knighted to avoid being extradited to a Kangaroo Court. Notable in that the vigil is actually shown, though most of the other steps are skipped. A companion shows up and you get attacked by bad guys as well, naturally.
-   _Star Wars: The Old Republic_: The various Force using classes are all knighted by the end of Act One, even though only the Jedi use the term "knight." Sith prefer "Lord."
-   In the beginning of _Star Wars: The Force Unleashed_, Darth Vader knights Starkiller with his lightsaber as he officially acknowledges him as his Sith Apprentice.
-   In the ending of _Dragon Quest III_, The Hero receives the title of Loto/Erdrick, revealing said Hero you've been playing to be the Famous Ancestor of the prior two games' heroes.
-   Symbolically, Leo knights Gawain near the end of _Fate/EXTRA_.
-   _Celestian Tales: Old North_ has its six main characters start out as squires (knights-in-training). The last part of the game features their knighting ceremony.
-   The first story mission in _For Honor_ ends with the player being knighted by Holden Cross and recruited into the Blackstone Legion for winning the Combat by Champion.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks_: While not actually a knighting ceremony, Link receiving his license to become a Royal Engineer is treated the same way, complete with Princess Zelda personally handing him his certificate. Trains are Serious Business in New Hyrule.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_: The first recoverable memory shows Zelda "knighting" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Link as a member of the Champions and as her personal bodyguard in a ceremony on the suggestion of the Goron Champion Daruk. Though she is so somber because of her own insecurities and jealousy of Link's apparent ease in meeting his destiny during the ceremony that Daruk admits that she's "making it sound like we've already lost" against Ganon.
-   In the Fan Remake of _King's Quest II_, you (as Graham) can choose to do this to the protagonist of _King's Quest: Mask of Eternity_. Said Fan Remake also establishes that, should the monarch of Daventry die without heirs, the First Knight (highest-ranking and most trusted Knight) becomes monarch, which is how Graham got the job in the first place.
-   _Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time_: The Zombie King is capable of doing this to nearby Peasant Zombies, turning them into _very durable_ Knight Zombies.
-   In _Sunrider 4: The Captain's Return_, Asaga di Ryuvia invokes an ancient Ryuvian law to make Kayto Shields an honorary count, mainly so her ministers will stop complaining about her choice to hand over her people's most advanced starship to a foreigner.
    
    **Asaga:** Step forward, Kayto Shields. By the laws of the Holy Empire, I, Queen Asaga di Ryuvia, bestow upon you the title of Count. You are granted all the privileges and duties of that title, until the crown has deemed you unfit for service. Rise, Count Shields.

-   _The Little Painter_: Pierre is knighted by King Croissant for getting rid of a bridge troll.

    Webcomics

-   _Mahu_: In "Frozen Flame" Prince Arius personally knights several of his army's horsemen. This knighting however is more bureaucratic, with the prince handing each man and woman a signed paper, a pat in the shoulder and then all the armor and weaponry they need to fight as armored knights.

    Western Animation 

-   A variation in _Adventure Time_ when the Nice King (the Ice King) makes Finn and Jake his "nice knights".
-   Parodied in the _Bugs Bunny_ cartoon _Rabbit Hood_. Bugs has conned the Sheriff of Nottingham into thinking he's the king, and that Bugs is going to knight him.
    
    **Bugs:** Arise, Sir Loin of Beef! _\*strikes Sheriff over the head with his sceptre\*_ Arise, Earl (oil) of Cloves! _\*strike\*_ Arise, Duke of Brittingham! _\*strike\*_ Arise, Baron of Munchausen! _\*strike\*_ Arise, Essence of Myrrh! _\*strike\*_ Milk of Magnesia _\*strike\*_ Quarter of Ten _\*strike\*_  
    **Sheriff:** _(dazed, slurred)_ You're too kind, your majesty.  
    **Bugs:** _(to audience)_ Got lots of stamina!
    
    -   There's an aspect of Accidentally-Correct Writing here, in that the "taps on the head" weren't always just light taps; historically, they were often hard enough to hurt. A noble warrior might not have been surprised to have the knighting taps hurt, any more than it would be surprising to someone in a fraternity hazing. But it doesn't seem as if Bugs Bunny knew any of this.
-   There were two knightings in _Gargoyles_. Princess Katherine used a dagger to dub Tom "Guardian of the Eggs". King Arthur used Excalibur to knight Griff.
-   In the _Hello Kitty's Furry Tale Theater_ episode "Sleeping Kitty" (a spoof of _Sleeping Beauty_), the servant Sam fails to stop Princess Kitty from falling into the enchanted sleep. The King draws his sword and Sam assumes he will be executed for his failure, but the King instead knights him and charges him to protect the realm as he and his Queen choose to join their daughter in the enchanted sleep. Eventually, Sam realizes that in knighthood, he qualifies as a prince, and he breaks the spell by giving Princess Kitty True Love's Kiss.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: Princess Celestia does the typical shoulder-tap to Twilight with her horn before she and her friends run off to retrieve the Elements from Discord in the second season opener.
-   _The Simpsons_: Krusty the Clown was nearly knighted by the Queen of England herself... but then he got a call about the problems with Kamp Krusty.
-   _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_: In "Scent of a Hoodie", King River declares Marco Diaz a Knight of Mewni as thanks for his heroism and gives him a cape. However, in "Lint Catcher", when he tries to pull rank with the other knights, they refuse to acknowledge him. It turns out River was only humoring him and didn't think Marco would take him seriously, and the cape was just an old blanket. If Marco truly wants to be a knight, he must endure months or years of training as a squire. Then, Star gives Marco the equivalent of a knighting ceremony (with a hilariously long oath) to make him her squire.
-   In _Star Wars: Clone Wars_, Anakin was knighted by Yoda and the Jedi Council _with a lightsaber._ It was to sever the "Padawan Braid" that Anakin had, which was delivered (secretly) to Padme, which symbolized the attainment of Jedi Knight rank. This is the same method used for all Jedi Padawans upon ascension to Knight-hood.
-   _Star Wars Rebels_: "Shroud of Darkness" brought the Jedi knighting ceremony described above back into canon, when Kanan is knighted by the Sentinel. It even uses the same wording as _Clone Wars_, sans "Knight of the Republic" because this is after the Republic has fallen.

    Real Life 

-   While the martial aspects of the tradition have been de-emphasised significantly in this day and age, knighthood is still Serious Business in countries where it's still practiced. In Britain, being knighted is comparable to a US citizen being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The same applies to other countries with their own orders of knighthood.
-   Sean Connery showed up for _his_ knighting in full Scottish regalia (i.e., a kilt). Since he's Scottish, it's not surprising but still shows the formal ceremony thing.
-   Stephen Colbert was knighted by the Queen of Jordan ... with Andúril. (Note that knighthood as such is unknown in the traditions of the Arab monarchies; note also that Queen Noor is a half-Swedish, half-Syrian American, and the whole thing is so cool nobody should give a damn.)
-   Terry Pratchett, upon hearing that he would be awarded a knighthood, decided that a knight ought to have a sword, and made his own ... out of meteoric iron.
-   Sir Patrick Stewart mentioned on _The Graham Norton Show_ episode on 27 January 2012 that when he was knighted, he was very scared because Queen Elizabeth II seemed to produce the sword out of nowhere. Add to that, she looks like a frail old woman holding a large, heavy sword right by his neck. He also wrote elsewhere that before the knighting ceremony, he thought to himself, "What would Spider Jerusalem do?" and came up with "Headbutt Prince Charles". As such, he couldn't hear what the prince said to him after the ceremony, as he was using all his willpower not to headbutt him.
-   The French king François Ier was knighted (at his own request) after his victory at the battle of Marignan by one of his knights, Pierre de Bayard, who was apparently the closest we'll ever get to a real-life Knight in Shining Armor.
-   If one doesn't mind it being purely decorative with no actual authority, any man who visits a Medieval Times Dinner And Tournament (and pays the associated fee, of course) can be given a ceremony where he is knighted; women are instead deemed a Lady of the Realm. Often used to celebrate a birthday or other such occasion.
