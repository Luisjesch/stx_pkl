How bad can he possibly be? Well, this answers the question.

_I used to be such a sweet sweet thing 'til they got a hold of me.  
I opened doors for little old ladies. I helped the blind to see.  
I got no friends 'cause they read the papers. They can't be seen  
With me, and I'm gettin' real shot down and I'm feeling mean._

When a character grows into a Jerkass over time (sometimes rather quickly). Can be due to Flanderization, a Faceâ€“Heel Turn, a traumatic incident, or just another regular albeit unfortunate case of Character Development, which depends on who's writing said character(s). While a Jerkass growing into a Jerk with a Heart of Gold is a common phenomenon, especially in dramas, a reversal, resulting in this trope, is also common, especially in comedies.

This can also cause tropes like What the Hell, Hero?, though whether the character changes back to their kind-hearted ways, again, it usually depends on the writer. If the transition is shown as a flashback regarding a known jerk/villain, it may be a Start of Darkness.

When this happens to a character temporarily for the sake of the plot, the Jerkass Ball is present. The Counter Trope to Took a Level in Kindness. Contrast Bitch in Sheep's Clothing, who was always a jerk. A character taking their level in jerkassitude was genuinely nice. When a character takes this route in an adaptation, that's Adaptational Jerkass.
