_"You're supposed to be Santa's wife, not his mistress!"_

A sexy dress designed to make it clear it's to be worn for Christmas time. The outfit is usually red, and trimmed with either fur (real or fake) or with feathers, often topped by a Santa hat. The exact form of the dress can vary:

-   Usually it's a mini dress.
-   Sometimes it's a sexy (often midriff-baring) top and short skirt.
-   Sometimes it's a sexy top and hot pants or booty shorts.
-   Sometimes it will be a skintight leotard.

Since these are either skimpy and/or skintight, these outfits are major Fanservice. Shows will often have a Mall Santa with one or more ladies wearing this, whether or not it happens in Real Life. A variation of this is the girls wearing sexy _elf_ costumes.

Expect someone to make an obligatory joke about the character being Exposed to the Elements.

Side-Story Bonus Art in Anime and Manga often has holiday pics with female characters wearing these dresses.

A Sub-Trope of Pimped-Out Dress, Costume Porn, Sexy Whatever Outfit.

A Sister Trope to Happy Holidays Dress (the one with the longer skirt, and is, therefore, warmer), Minidress of Power.

Compare Fur Bikini, Sexy Sweater Girl, Homemade Sweater from Hell, Exposed to the Elements, An Ice Suit.

**This is about the dress, _not_ just any kind of Christmas fanservice.**
