**Major Monogram:** Oh! Wow! What are the odds?  
**Carl:** Well, it _is_ a cartoon, sir.  
**Major Monogram:** What did I tell you about breaking the fourth wall, Carl?  
**Carl:** Sorry, sir.

Breaking the Fourth Wall for humorous purposes (being defined as a character breaking the fourth wall in a series whose fourth wall seemed relatively hard) is often the work of a single character who shows Medium Awareness for the joke's sake.

Because the medium-aware character is thereby breaking the established rules of the setting, it is frequent for other characters not to share their fellow's insight, and involuntarily add weight to the joke by asking, "Audience? What Audience?" However, perhaps funnier still is another character knowing perfectly well what the wall-breaker is talking about, but immediately shushing him because the characters aren't _supposed_ to know as far as the viewer is concerned. A variation will have the characters complain to the _author_ for writing a fourth-wall-breaking character in the first place.

A humorous, fourth-wall version of The Masquerade. A possible interpretation of such a scenario is that there is really No Fourth Wall but the characters pretend there is one anyway. Almost always Played for Laughs.

    Fan Works

-   Happens several times in the _Harry Potter_ fanfiction _The Many Harry Potters of Little Hangleton_. And the scolders are right, too, because by the time the fic ends, the Fourth Wall _literally_ shatters on screen, and the next chapter, having literally No Fourth Wall, ends up veering into Gainax Ending.
-   _Pokémon_ fanfiction "Child of Mew" has Ash and Mew sometimes breaking the fourth wall. One instance has Ash calling Mew out by saying, "What did we say about breaking the fourth wall?"

    Film — Animated 

-   _The Emperor's New Groove_: At the end of the second act, wrapping up on how Kuzco is a llama and alone and sulking in the thunderstorm, and his narrator self justifies he's still the victim, Kuzco calls him(self?) out that the viewers saw the whole thing and tells him to shove it and leave him alone. Kuzco's narrator self doesn't appear after that.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Mystery Science Theater 3000_

    **Milton:** I'm sorry.
    

    Web Comics 

-   _Checkerboard Nightmare_ broke the fourth wall constantly, but wasn't above mocking the concept as well. In one story arc, Vaporware decides that fourth-wall-breaking is just a crutch for lazy comedy writers, and he completely bricks over the fourth wall so it can never be broken again. (Naturally, a Snap Back undoes this at the end of the arc.)
-   _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_'s title character is prone to fourth-wall-breaking, and his down-to-earth girlfriend Jean always calls him out on it.
    
    **Molly:** Hey, mommy! Daddy's breaking the fourth wall! It's all avant-garde and stuff! Keen, uh?  
    **Jean Poule:** Oh, I hate it when he does that. It's so confusing.
    
-   _The Order of the Stick_: At one point Elan (accidentally) breaks the fourth wall by noticing how characters looked different before a character design update, only for another character to explain (between their teeth) that they were supposed to have _always_ looked like the modern design.
-   An exchange from _Paradox Space_ begins when Karkat uses Dave's terrible webcomic characters in his screenplay. Dave threatens to sue before Karkat says that his "Geromy" is completely distinct from Dave's "Jeromy". Dave points out that it's only a difference of spelling and Karkat screams at him for getting meta. Dave points out he knew the spelling from the script and that Karkat is the one being meta. From there, the argument devolves into cursing.
-   While _El Goonish Shive_ usually has a strong fourth wall, the non-canon side stories break it causally. In this strip, when Rhoda and Catalina acknowledge that they're in a non-canon story, Hanma criticizes their disregard for the fourth wall. This comes with a dose of Hypocritical Humor, as Hanma's first appearance had her arguing with the narration.

    Web Original 

-   In the _SuperMarioLogan_ episode "Bowser Junior's Clown Car", Junior enlists Joseph and Cody's help to get a box that has Bowser's Clown Car in it, since he's too short. Cody points out that he, Junior, and Joseph are controlled by hands, and can go as high as they need to go, leading to this exchange:
    
    **Junior:** Stop breaking the fourth wall, Cody!  
    **Joseph:** Yeah, Cody! Always ruining stuff!  
    **Cody:** Sorry.
    
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_ is no stranger to breaking the fourth wall, but it eventually got to the point where breaking the fourth wall itself was an in-universe plot. One episode has Shadi revealing to Yugi that it's his job to prevent the fourth wall from being broken and if it was, then chaos would ensue.

    Western Animation

-   The _Teen Titans Go!_ episode "The Fourth Wall" uses this as a running gag, where the Titans interact with the audience, much to the chagrin of Control Freak.
-   Parodied in _Family Guy_ when Chris tries warning Meg that she's breaking the fourth wall, despite the fact that they're already being filmed for a reality show.
-   _Danger Mouse_: In "Where There's a Well, There's a Way," DM and Colonel K have a confusing conversation, so Penfold talks to us.
    
    **Penfold:** Um, sorry about all the confusion...it's what they call a breakdown in communication. Just chat amongst yourselves while they get all this sorted out.  
    **DM:** Penfold, who are you talking to?  
    **Penfold:** Um, no one, chief. Well, I hope it's not _no one_, chief, but, um, no one, chief.
