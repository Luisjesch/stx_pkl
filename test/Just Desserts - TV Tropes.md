Guess the snake wasn't interested in eating the lollipop.

**Eda:** Oh no, Tibbles, that's not how entertainment works. The bad guy always gets their just desserts.  
_\[Eda pours caramel crabapples onto Tibbles.\]_  
**Tibbles:** Oh no, not desserts!

A villain ultimately finds their evil deeds come back to bite them. _Literally_ — they end up getting eaten.

This does _not_ include a Heroic Sacrifice. But may be subverted with a minor character being killed and eaten in obvious foreshadowing of what is going to happen to one of the bads at some point. While Mooks may be recipients of the Just Desserts, a true Just Dessert is reserved for those higher up the ladder. If the beast doing the eating was unleashed by the guy who gets eaten, he's been Hoist by His Own Petard, making him a Self-Disposing Villain. Bonus points if he made a practice of feeding people to said beast beforehand.

The trope name is a play on the phrase "just deserts" (which means the consequences that one rightly _deserves_, hence the single 'S'). And as you know, a dessert gets eaten at the end.

Compare Karmic Death, The Dog Bites Back, Devour the Dragon, Laser-Guided Karma. Also, see Exit, Pursued by a Bear where this trope is frequently implied.

## WARNING: This is a Death Trope. Here Be Spoilers.

## Examples:

    Anime & Manga 

-   The Immortals of _Baccano!_ can consume each other and gain each other's experience by laying their hand on the other immortal's forehead. This is how Firo defeats Szilard.
-   _Digimon Adventure_ has chief minion Demidevimon get devoured by his master Venom Myotismon after he decides coming back from the dead has made him hungry.
-   In _Digimon Fusion_, Chuuchuumon, a rat puppet Digimon, grew large after seeing Taiki, Mervamon, Wisemon, and Knightmon who were coming to rescue Yuu. Taiki summoned Bastemon, a cat-like Digimon, who then gained a Slasher Smile after seeing the mouse. This is a rare case where the one who devours is very, very small compared to the "dessert".
-   In _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_, Dante gets eaten by her minion Gluttony at the end of the series. For bonus points, she's the one who rendered him crazed and mindless in the first place, meaning that he was willing to eat her because he could no longer understand her commands, nor remember her.
-   In _The Garden of Sinners_, Cornelius Alba gets eaten alive by one of Touko's creations.
-   Mother Carmel in _One Piece_ is heavily implied to have been eaten by Linlin, one of the orphans she was raising with the intent of selling them off as soldiers. This example wasn't intentional on Linlin's part: she was treated to a feast for her birthday and lost herself in her hunger, eventually regaining consciousness only to find everyone missing.
-   In _Toriko_, has two notable examples: in the Ice Hell arc, near the end, Bishokukai members Barry Gammon and Bogey Woods try to run away from the final confrontation, leaving their superior Tommyrod alone against Toriko and are promptly devoured by the Hellbroth awakened by Teppei though they're later saved by another member of the Bishokukai. Played more straight with Shigematsu, who's sent flying by Toriko's Infinite Spiked Punch and is ultimately tore apart and devoured alive by some monstrous flying birds, though his last thoughts are that he's actually grateful that at least his body could feed the Nature as a way to make amend.
-   This happens to Aki's Evil Mentor Divine in _Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds_. His sadistic career comes to an end when Earthbound God Ccarayhua swallowed him. (Word of God says that he recovered along with the rest of the Earthbound Gods' victim's later, but he was also arrested by Sector Security).

    Comic Books 

-   Wolfsbane had an abusive bigot of a father by the name of Reverend Craig, whose sadistic career came to an end when the brainwashing that _he inflicted upon her_ kicks in, and she mistakes him for the Angel, whom he had ordered her to kill; she lunges at him in her wolf-form, in a bestial state, killing and devouring him. She doesn't remember a thing when she recovers, and her teammates wisely decide to keep it a secret.
-   _Black Moon Chronicles_: After Haazheel Thorn's defeat his soul is devoured by his father Lucifer for failing to deliver the Earth to him. Especially karmic because Haazheel planned to have the rest of humanity harvested by the Legions of Hell so that he could become a god.
-   _The Ultimates (2015):_ Rostdvow, a "thing" serving the Big Bad, is eaten by Galactus so the big guy can learn what it knows. Given Rostdvow had just played party to corrupting Galactus, driving his previous hunger to such levels Galactus was near mindless, it also counts as Laser-Guided Karma.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: Some of the Sangtee Empire slavers on Hope's End get knocked into the scavenger worm's sandpits, where they're devoured by the monsters they've been tossing dead slaves to.
    -   _Wonder Woman (2006)_: Alkyone gets eaten by one of the _Megalodon_ off the coast of Themyscira. In a subversion of the usual outcome of this trope, she actually ends up surviving and cutting her way out of the giant shark to continue to wreak havoc on the Amazons.

    Fairy Tales 

-   In Joseph Jacobs' version of "The Three Little Pigs", the third pig does not stop at boiling the wolf to death, but also eats him ("for supper"). As the wolf wanted to eat the pigs, this is also a Karmic Death.

    Fan Works 

-   Alexia's final fate in _The Return_, devoured by Darkstar.
-   _3 Slytherin Marauders_: This happens to a Death Eater who attacks a dragon that had befriended Harry Potter, though the dragon later claimed that the Death Eater gave her indigestion.

-   In one of the side-stories of _Danse Macabre_, a Lethifold eats Peter Pettigrew.
-   The main antagonist of _Loved and Lost_, Jewelius, is finished off this way by the Changelings he used and double-crossed to steal Equestria's throne. Normally the Changelings feed on love, but Queen Chrysalis decides that since the heart of Jewelius holds no love, everything else will have to do.
-   Andraya, one of the two main villains of _Heart of Ashes_, is swallowed whole by Smaug after the witch crosses the dragon one too many times. As soon as Andraya is sucked into Smaug's stomach, she's incinerated by his natural fire.

    -   In the first film, Lord Farquaad gets eaten by Dragon.

Caesar, being more pragmatic and considerably less obese, is faster on his feet and wisely makes a subdued but hasty exit amid all the commotion.
-   In The Stinger of _Trolls_, Chef and Creek are both eaten by a monster.
-   Subverted in Disney's _Peter Pan_: Captain Hook falls into the crocodile's mouth and gets swallowed, but (unlike in the original play) runs out relatively unharmed, and is last seen swimming away from the predator who's trying to eat him a second time. The sequel explicitly shows him alive.

    Films — Live-Action

    -   _Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull_: The Dragon gets eaten by siafu ants.
-   _Jurassic Park_ is a film series about dinosaurs, so it’s no surprise that this is how they deal with evil characters:
    -   _Jurassic Park_: Sysadmin Dennis Nedry sets off the chain of events that releases the animals, and then is eaten by one. This is actually a bad thing for the protagonists, because he was supposed to return after smuggling the embryos and turn the security system back on, but you can't return from death...
    -   Also in the first movie, they're not truly villains, but the raptors themselves become prey for the T-Rex at the climax.

-   In _Romancing the Stone_ Zolo's hand is bitten off by a crocodile, and then he drops into a pit of them.
-   Madam Yiu, the Dragon Lady villainess of _Shanghai Grand_ who starves her pet boa into making it savage and releasing it to devour her captors, was killed when trying to feed Ding-Lik to the boa, when Ding-Lik shoves an exposed bulb down the boa's throat causing it to twitch violently, breaking free from the chains Yiu is using to control the animal. The boa then lunges at Madam Yiu, to her horror, before swallowing her face.
-   _Shark Attack_

-   The villains of _Shark Night_ feed people to sharks to make internet videos of them to make money, that and they're Ax-Crazy.

-   _Spiders II: Breeding Ground_: Dr. Grbac, the captain, and the rest of the crew who cooperated with Grbac's plans all end up eaten by the giant spiders he created.

One breaks through behind her and she is Swallowed Whole. Monte winds up punched into the mouth of the Meg by Jonas during their fight, and gets crunched up instead. It's hard to say who got it worse, but both deaths were very well-deserved.

    Literature 

-   Short story "Thus I Refute Beelzy". A mentally abusive father is eaten by the title character, his son's Not-So-Imaginary Friend.
-   Famously done in the _Silence Of The Lambs_ books. If they are a Bad, it is a good bet that Hannibal Lecter will eat them.
    -   Or, in _Hannibal_, he (in this case, Mason) gets eaten by the wild boars that he _thought_ would eat Hannibal.
-   In _Sideways Stories from Wayside School_, Mrs. Gorf is tricked into turning herself into an apple. Louis finds the apple and eats it.
    -   This happens to Mrs. Gorf again in a later book. She materializes in a plate of potato salad, and John and Joe quickly eat her before she can turn them into apples.

    -   In the fourth book, _Hurricane Gold_, The Dragon winds up getting paralyzed and eaten alive by a swarm of army ants while he can't do anything but watch.
-   The old couple who killed cats for fun in H. P. Lovecraft's short story "The Cats of Ulthar" ends up, fittingly, eaten by all the town's cats.
-   In _Kitty and the Silver Bullet_ Carl, the abusive leader of the Denver werewolves, is torn apart by his own pack.
-   Captain Hook's hand in _Peter Pan_ had been lost in a duel with Pan and eaten by a giant crocodile which becomes his Animal Nemesis as a result. At the climax, the croc returns to finish the meal.
-   James Bond novel _Live and Let Die_ has the Big Bad get eaten by sharks and barracudas.
-   In _The Last Battle_, Shift gets thrown in the stable of his Scam Religion by King Tiriam and gets eaten by Tash.
-   Subverted — seeing as he survives — with Zorba the Hutt, Jabba's father, who appears in a few _Star Wars Legends_ sources. In _The Glove of Darth Vader_, he seeks revenge on Han and Leia for his son's death, but his plan to deal Leia a Karmic Death by throwing her to the sarlacc ends with him humiliated, not only because _he_ is thrown into it by Trioculus (a would-be successor to Palpatine with a weird crush on Leia — long story), but the beast vomits him out, clearly getting sick trying to eat him. (This is the first of many embarrassments for Zorba, who is clearly a sorry excuse for a Hutt.)
    -   Played straight with Feltipern Trevagg, who is introduced cheating a widow with children out of her home, and proceeds to seduce a space bimbo not realizing that among her people the bride traditionally eats the groom's insides on the wedding night.
-   In _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_, the Oompa-Loompas claim that this will be the gluttonous Augustus Gloop's fate, as the pipe he's stuck in leads to a room where fudge is prepared. In a subversion, he's rescued before that can happen... in most versions. It's strongly implied that he _will_ become a tasty treat in the 2013 stage musical!
-   Wilhelm Busch's picture story _Max and Moritz_ ends with the titular bad boys getting ground up in a mill and eaten by geese.
-   In Michael Crichton's sequel to _Jurassic Park_, _The Lost World_, Big Bad Lewis Dodgson gets devoured by a bunch of baby _T. rexes_ after an adult drops him into the nest and breaks his leg so that he can't escape. It's especially karmic, since not only did he antagonize the group in this book, but he also helped cause the events of the first novel.
-   In the Alex Rider book _Crocodile Tears_, The Dragon falls into, fittingly enough, a pit of crocodiles, which proceed to pull her apart in several different directions and eat her, leaving only a foot with a severed shoe.
-   Malice X from _Fat White Vampire Blues_ meets his end when he falls in bat-form into a pack of angry vampire wolf-dogs.
-   _InCryptid_: Francesco Russo and his gang, the villains of the short story "Sweet Poison Wine", end up getting eaten by the river hags they tried to feed their enemies to, when Frances, Jonathan, and the gorgons leave them tied to chairs surrounded by raw liver, right next to the waterfront.

However the panther had never tasted human blood before until it injured Watson; having taken a liking to it, the panther goes straight for its owner instead.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   In the episode "The Pack", Xander and four gang members are taken over by a hyena spirit. As part of their rampage they kill and eat the school mascot pig, and then — when called into the principal's office for questioning — Principal Flutie. At the end of the episode, the zoo warden who caused the whole thing (he wanted the hyena spirit for himself) gets tossed into a hyena holding pit where he gets eaten.
    -   The episode "Go Fish" has the evil coach who was turning his team into _Creature from the Black Lagoon_\-type monsters fall into a pit of them at the conclusion. "Those boys sure love their coach."
    -   "Graduation Day." Principal Snyder gets eaten by The Mayor, who has just transformed himself into a giant demon snake thingy.
-   In _V: The Final Battle_, Daniel Bernstein is framed for the kidnapping of the Visitor Brian. Daniel is then captured, tortured, and taken away to be served to the aliens
-   The tennis-playing giant alien blancmange in _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ gets eaten by Mr. and Mrs. Brainsample. On the planet they're from, they're used to blancmanges being that size.
-   Being a show about dinosaurs and other creatures that come through time portals, _Primeval_ has this quite often. A prime example would be that of Season 2 Big Bad Oliver Leek, who gets ripped apart, shredded, and eaten by a bunch of Future Predators after Nick Cutter cuts the power to the devices he was using to control them.
-   _Walking with Dinosaurs_:
    -   The _Liopleurodon_ gets eaten by a group of _Eustreptospondylus_ at the end of "Cruel Sea". It wasn't evil, just a predator, but it was nevertheless the episode's "villain".
    -   The _Postosuchus_ is similarly eaten alive by a pack of _Coelophysis_ at the end of "New Blood".
-   _Game of Thrones_: In season 6 Ramsay Bolton is eaten alive by his own hounds after spending many seasons engaging in torture, warfare, and rape. This is especially karmic because he had trained his hounds to eat various people he hunted down or otherwise wanted to dispose of, and even more so due to him starving the hounds in preparation for eating Jon Snow and the others on the Stark side following the Battle of the Bastards, meaning that they're too hungry to recognize their master when Sansa Stark, his final victim, has him thrown into the kennels with them.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Religious art of the Christian Middle Ages, especially in illustrations of the Last Judgement, often depicts the entrance to Hell as the open mouth of a large monster which swallows the damned. Pictures of Hell from the same era also frequently show the damned being swallowed, eaten or gnawed on by devils or demons<small>◊</small>.
-   In Egyptian Mythology to enter the afterlife you had to be weighed against the Feather of Truth after denying you'd done a long list of sins (the "Negative Confession"). If you were lying and therefore committed too many of the sins, you would be fed to Ammut the Devourer, a hippo with a crocodile's head.
-   _Classical Myth_: Inverted towards the end of the Trojan war- the priest Laocoon warned his fellow Trojans about bringing the Greek's wooden horse into the city. A bunch of snakes sprang out of the sea to devour him and his sons. He was right, of course, but because onlookers interpreted it as this trope, they hurried to bring the horse into the city.
-   In the Book of Daniel from The Bible, after having to consign Daniel to a lion's den because of a law that some princes had tricked him into passing because they were jealous of him, King Darius, overjoyed that (as he himself had predicted) the Lord protected Daniel for the night by sending one of His angels to shut the lions' mouths so they could not hurt him, has Daniel taken out of the lions' den. The princes responsible for the law (and their families, in a bit of Disproportionate Retribution) are thrown in instead, where they promptly get eaten by the lions.

    Theatre 

-   The opera _Hansel and Gretel1893_ adds a new element to the familiar tale by the Brothers Grimm: The witch owns a magical oven which bakes children into gingerbread. Of course, the witch ends up getting pushed into it, and not only does this restore all the gingerbread children to life, an impressive piece of witch-shaped gingerbread is brought out at the finale.
-   The fate of Captain Hook in the original _Peter Pan_. Adaptations often spare him, though.
-   Chiron and Demetrius get butchered and baked into a pie for raping and mutilating Lavinia in _Titus Andronicus_.

    Video Games 

-   In _Overlord II_, the villain's dragon, Marius, is praising his boss after a One-Winged Angel turns him into an all-devouring Eldritch Abomination, his praise is interrupted by the devourer eating him.
-   In _Super Mario RPG_, after the Bundt cake is beaten down to its last Raspberry layer, it gets swallowed by Booster in one mighty gulp, though it takes two flunkies just to lift it and throw it into his mouth. Of course, this cake was supposed to be just a dessert in the first place, but instead it came alive and started attacking.
-   This happens _a lot_ in both _\[PROTOTYPE\]_ and _\[PROTOTYPE 2\]_, most notably to Alex Mercer in the sequel. Suffice to say, in both games only six bad guys _escaped_ this fate: Dr. McMullen by suicide, Supreme Hunter by decapitation, three scientists by helicopter crash and Col. Rooks by being more pragmatical than evil and thus _surviving_.
-   In _Drakensang 2: The River of Time_, the corrupted commander Stitus Bloomfold (who often fed his prisoners to wild animals of sorts) tries to feed the party to his pet Newt Kraken, but when the monster is defeated and starts waving his tentacles in pain, he loses balance and fall in the kraken's open maws.
-   In _Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb_, the Big Bad gets eaten by a dragon that was summoned from the underworld.
-   Victor and Moritz in _Crash Twinsanity_ manage to escape their Final Boss fight unscathed and attempt to hide away in a hut. They quickly discover that it's Evil Crash's hut and the monstrous bandicoot's hungry.
-   A possible way to kill targets in a few levels of _Hitman_.
    -   _Blood Money_ has two. The "Till Death Do Us Part" level allows any bodies (alive or dead) that are pushed into the swamp to be eaten by alligators. One of the targets in that level is even a Fat Bastard who likes to feed chum to the reptiles... The other level is "A Dance With the Devil", set in a Las Vegas nightclub with a massive shark tank in the Hell-themed basement area. People can be pushed in to the water from the feeding area, but rigging the pyrotechnics show will fry one of your targets and cause her to jump into the water, where the sharks eat her.
    -   In _Absolution_, this can be done in the "Death Factory" level where a pig-hating scientist can be dropped into a pit full of them. However, unlike _Blood Money_, where the bodies are actually eaten (and can make the sharks quite fat), looking down into said pit will reveal the body lying above where the pigs are milling about as crunching and eating noises are heard, so its best to just listen and leave it to your imagination.
-   In _Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse_, Big Bad Betram gets swallowed by his own Tyrannosaurus rex.
-   In _Jurassic Park: The Game_, Dr. Sorkin gets eaten by the _Mosasaurus_ she freed after turning on the group and becoming essentially an eco-terrorist. Later, Yoder does a Face–Heel Turn and ascends to Big Bad status by betraying the group and leaving them to die. When they later catch up to him and fight him, the Tyrannosaurus rex appears and he gets devoured by it while trying to get the Barbasol container back. If Nima chooses to get the canister back instead of helping Jess, she too will take a trip to the T. rex's stomach.
-   Many villains in _World of Warcraft_:
    -   One Alliance quest you can take involves using a disguise to infiltrate the Blacktooth Hovel and, among other things, eliminate three of their leaders. One of them is Worgmistress Othana, a cruel woman who beats and tortures the worgs she is in charge of. After you strike her with the weapon provided by the quest giver, she's paralyzed, and the abused worgs waste no time closing in to finish her off. (It's rather enjoyable to watch.)
    -   In Isle of the Giants, Dohaman the Beast Lord is a troll "dinomancer" who has altered a giant devilsaur named Oondasta into a gigantic living siege engine. Before the Raid actually starts, he orders Oondasta to crush the Raid members, but Oondasta decides to devour him before doing so.
