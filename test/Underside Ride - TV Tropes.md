A character hitches a ride by clinging to the underside of a vehicle, often a big truck with high ground clearance. This can be done as a means of tailing someone who has their own vehicle when you do not and you cannot risk losing them, or as a means of infiltrating (or exfiltrating) an enemy compound, dropping off the vehicle once you are through the gates. The character may also cling to the bottom of a moving stagecoach, cart or train. In science fiction, it may be done with an aerocar.

Do Not Try This at Home. There are a lot of moving parts underneath a vehicle that can chew up a human body real good. As well, some parts get hot enough to burn you. And when you fall off — not if, _when_ — not only will you hit the road at high speed, you stand a good chance of being run over by the very vehicle you were riding on, or the one coming behind. And if you _somehow_ maintain your grip, you'll be easily dragged to death against the pavement.

Compare Outside Ride. When a vehicle isn't involved, you may have a case of Container Cling.

In the chaos, Kanan and Hera take the opportunity to escape by grabbing on to the underside of the bus. The ensuing ride is both dangerous and muddy because the hoverbus is so old that it can't properly fly anymore and can only hover a few metres above the ground before it starts wobbling wildly, and since Skelly doesn't know that, he keeps trying to take the bus higher than is safe. Eventually, Hera (who got a better handhold) gets on and takes over, sending Skelly to the back to help Kanan in through the broken back window.
-   In _A Tale of Two Cities_, Gaspard, whose son has been killed after being run over by the Marquis St. Evremonde's carriage, hitches a ride underneath the carriage (this is ominously hinted at when the narrator describes the carriage as being heavier than usual) in order to follow the Marquis to his chateau and kill him.

    Real Life 

-   One Darwin Award winner tried this while attempting to diagnose a truck's engine, apparently to watch the engine while it worked. It seemed a fine idea until the moving parts caught his sleeve... Link
-   Jeffery Manchester became the only person to escape from the Brown Creek Correctional Institution by holding on to the bottom of a delivery truck.
-   African and Asian migrants trying to sneak into Great Britain from France via the Chunnel have often been advised by smugglers as to how to do so by secreting themselves in the undercarriage of the trains. It is apparently possible to do this for some people, as long as you stay stock still through the entire ride, during which your head may be inches away from the wheel of a train car traveling at high speed, and you don't mind temperatures getting almost wintry cold around you due to the effects of traveling through the Chunnel's controlled climate (about 60 degrees or so) at those high speeds.
    -   Illegal immigrants of all stripes will often try to sneak across borders by clinging to the undersides of trucks or trains. The hazards are well known, but every year, many try it hoping that border inspectors won't think to look there. It remains unknown precisely how many get killed or injured trying to make it across the borders.
-   Soviet boxcars had blades underside to discourage any underside rides and to guide any riders directly under the wheels. This was because the boxcars were used to haul not only cargo but also imprisoned people and it was to prevent any escape attempts.
-   Some illegal immigrants or thrill-seekers sometimes hide in airliner landing gear wells. Given the fact that the landing gear wells are usually very confined and unpressurized, and there is _awfully_ cold in-flight altitudes, these rides tend to end up badly. Those who aren't crushed by the retracting landing gear often are either frozen to death or suffocated by the thin air.
-   While possibly apocryphal, it is said some enterprising (and daring) Hobos have tried riding on the underside of railroad boxcars, often by tying hammocks, or _themselves_ to the undercarriage. While this was less risky (but still extremely dangerous) back in the early-to-mid 20th century since rolling stock tended to ride higher, today this would be practically suicide due to may railroad cars riding lower to the rails for clearance and stability reasons.
