Let 'er rip!

**Mae:** What if at a key moment in the game my, my uniform bursts open and, uh, oops, my bosoms come flying out? That, that might draw a crowd, right?  
**Doris:** You think there are men in this country who ain't seen your bosoms?

You've heard of Nothing Is Scarier, right? This trope could be called Nothing Is Sexier.

Clothing Damage is when clothes get torn off during combat. This type of Fanservice is more generally when clothing rips or falls off in non-combat related situations.

The Theiss Titillation Theory says that outfits which "merely suggest the imminence of revelation" are teasingly sexy. If it looks like Victoria is one stiff breeze away from having all of her secrets revealed, it will certainly get your attention, if only out of morbid curiosity. But the allure is all in the teasing: it looks like we'll see something, but we never do. When the hinted-at revelation accidentally comes to pass (universally to the embarrassment of the victim and the enjoyment or amusement of everyone else), the tease is over. And you get this trope.

This is common to outfits that are impractical and/or prone to falling off such as swimsuits, stripperiffic clothing, towels, robes, loincloths, dresses, gowns and skirts. When caused by some machine or magic specifically designed to achieve that effect, see The Nudifier, if caused by some form of shapeshifting see Shapeshifting Excludes Clothing. Witnesses and gawkers are usually targets for an Unprovoked Pervert Payback. A Shameless Fanservice Girl might not care about suffering a wardrobe malfunction and an Attention Whore might even _engineer it_ for the attention.

A Super-Trope to All Cloth Unravels (clothes unraveling from a single thread), Open-Fly Gag (leaving the zipper undone), Popping Buttons (when buttons pop away from the clothes), Slippery Swimsuit (losing your swimwear in the water) Splitting Pants (pants or similar garments rip from strenuous movements and/or being too small for the wearer) and Stripping Snag (clothes get snagged off when caught in something). See also Dress Hits Floor if the malfunction causes the clothes to pool at their feet. Compare Defeat by Modesty, Pants-Pulling Prank, Right Out of My Clothes, Shameful Strip, Undressing the Unconscious, and Wardrobe Wound. Contrast Sexy Coat Flashing. May cause a Comedic Underwear Exposure or Naked Freak-Out. A Fan Disservice version might be Plumber's Crack.

Don't mistake with Gravity Is a Harsh Seamstress, when falling through clotheslines gets you dressed in mismatched clothes.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Miria experiences a Wardrobe Malfunction in _Baccano!_ when Jacuzzi trips and tries to grab something to hold onto — which turns out to be the front of Miria's strapless dress, snagging it down and shoving his head against her chest. And Miria doesn't even care.
-   _Blade & Soul_: Both Karen and Dan suffer this in episode 13 as a Running Gag. Karen's Seashell Bra comes undone while she's fighting some hostile fish-men who suddenly start worshipping her as their goddess after witnessing her rather ample bosom. Later, Dan's Sarashi unwraps in front of the Cat Folk she's fighting, and they react in the same manner.
-   When Nel in _Bleach_ goes back to being her adult self, the green gown which covered her entire body as a child doesn't fit as well anymore and the gown gets torn into a skirt and a top, revealing only her midriff and Underboobs.
-   _Boarding School Juliet_:
    -   After her clothes got wet, Juliet had to put on Romio's clothes temporarily. Because of their Huge Guy, Tiny Girl dynamic, Romio's uniform was too big for Juliet and the pants slide back down revealing her legs because she didn't tie the belt to fit her and it results in confetti somehow bursting out of his head. Later, Juliet (in her "Julio" alter-ego) had to put on a Towan bathrobe in a hurry or else she'd be discovered by Romio's adopted sister Shuna. Juliet manages to fool Shuna, but when Romio turns his attention to Juliet, her robe was loose, slightly showing a little of her cleavage. As a Westian, Juliet doesn't know how to put it on properly.
    -   During the Beach Episode when Hasuki was trying to teach Romio how to swim, she suddenly lets him go so that he can swim on his own. Romio starts flailing his arms about, trying to grab the nearest object, which happens to be Hasuki's bikini top. One strong yank, and Hasuki suddenly finds herself topless.
-   _Booty Royale: Never Go Down Without a Fight!_:
    -   After Misora shows up to her first match of the Tournament Arc in a slingshot bikini, Akira and Sara get the idea to one-up that by dressing her for her second match in nothing but elastic bandages. The logical result happens when she finishes off Chompoo Shinlat with a flying kick: the bandages snap and leave her naked in front of the crowd and on live TV. She's mortified and probably would have suffered a Defeat by Modesty if she hadn't kayoed Shinlat already.
    -   The Space Wolf modeling celebrates the establishment of the second generation of Japan KGB with a pay-per-view breast tug-of-war: suction cups attached to the first- and second-generation models' nipples, winner still has hers attached. When trans woman Miya (2nd gen) goes up against Beruko (1st gen), the movement causes enough friction and arousal that she has an erection that escapes her panties. She's mortified, but the other girls reassure her that it's no big deal and declare her penis to just be a really big clit.
-   The central character of the highly obscure manga _Buraburabanban_ (loosely cognate with "brass brass band band" via use of shortened loanwords) suffers one of these when, while conducting a performance of the school band, her motions become so vigorous that her shirt flies up, revealing to the audience that she forgot to wear a bra that day. Much later, in the final pages of the last chapter, a Call-Back strikes during an even bigger and more public concert: her baton catches on the strap of her dress, which completely falls off. And this time she isn't wearing panties either.
-   Chapter 12/ episode 4A of _Castle Town Dandelion_ deals with a bottomless Akane who shows up to school without her skirt. Everyone notices, and assumes she forgot it, but no one has the guts to tell her or is afraid she will have a Defiled Forever reaction if they do, so they try to ignore it. When her sister points it out to her she reveals she ripped her skirt in some bushes and put on some gym shorts and lifts her shirt to show her... but then it turns out she _forgot_ to put on the shorts and she just have her classmates a panty shot. Cue Skyward Scream.
-   _A Certain Magical Index_:
    -   Touma accidentally disrobes Index at the beginning by touching her magically-generated clothes with his Imagine Breaker. Index had actually told him to do it, not believing him when told about his ability, but neither of them expected her clothes would disintegrate. This causes problems later when an enemy who knows Index attacks her and is shocked the attack actually hurt her, not knowing her magic clothes were gone.
    -   Happens again later in the second season to free a nun from magic-restricting clothing. Which then leads to a flashback (from another character) of Touma's hand being used to free other nuns while Touma was unconscious. He still gets in trouble.
-   Takao from _D-Frag!_ once spontaneously fired the zipper on her track shirt at Kenji without as much as a gesture.
-   In the second episode of _Dragonaut: The Resonance_, Jin is knocked unconscious by Sieglinde's Battle Butler and in awakens a bunker room with all of his clothes gone. He wraps a bedsheet around his waist and starts looking around, until Sieglinde enters the room and startles him, causing the sheet to slip down to the floor and giving her a Naked First Impression (He's only seen from the waist up). She promptly nicknames him "little man".
-   Mai Shiranui has many of these during her fight scenes in _Fatal Fury The Motion Picture_, including rather detailed nipple slips, panty shots and camel toes.
-   _Fire Force_: Tamaki is known to get into exceptionally fanservicey situations due to her clumsiness, usually resulting is wardrobe malfunction or Suggestive Collisions. She termed that problem a "Lucky Lewd Syndrome".
-   _Gabriel DropOut_: Raphiel has the largest chest of the girls and is also the most athletic, but she ends up being held back by them in the episode where they take the fitness test since the bra she was wearing that day was too tight and she was afraid to move too much and causing it the hooks to snap, which they eventually do during the running test, causing a lot of bouncing.
-   _Ghost Talker's Daydream_: Kadotake trips and grabs Misaki's dress while falling down, causing it to rip off and reveal her sexy lingerie underwear.

-   _Golden Time_: The bikini top Kouko shows off to Chinami in the latter's apartment during episode 14 falls off while she's complaining about Banri.
-   Invoked in _Haunted Junction_. When the _very_ sexy Cute Ghost Girls Yamiko and Hanako get into a sports competition with lives at the stake that has sexiness as one of the requirements, Yamiko cheats by either intentionally dropping one of her uniform straps to bare her breasts (manga) or by replacing a swimsuit she has to wear for the swimming contest with dissolving Body Paint and performing Sexy Surfacing Shot for sex appeal points (anime).
-   In an episode of _Hell Teacher Nube_, a Ribbon-Cutting Ceremony is being held, and a boy grabs a pair of scissors to cut the ribbon. Instead he accidentally cuts a teacher's skirt belt, causing it to fall off.

    -   A Running Gag is that Hibiki suffers one whenever she's really pumped to do an exercise.
        -   She gets a split swimsuit after warming up with Akemi's dynamic stretches routine, though it certainly didn't help that she'd gotten bigger since the last time she had worn it. The look on her face is priceless.
        -   Hibiki's shorts are torn when she does the leg curl. Ayaka tries to tell her about it, but Hibiki's too pumped to listen.
    -   Satomi and Rumika suffer one when their skirts rip at the same time.
-   _I Couldn't Become a Hero, So I Reluctantly Decided to Get a Job_:
    -   Airi's bikini top falls off shortly after she kicks Raul when he claims She Is Not My Girlfriend in episode 8.
    -   Both times we see Airi in her armor, a translucent catsuit with a few conveniently placed metal bars, the bar across her breasts gets broken.

When the creep takes Love Interest Yuika hostage, Gender Bender Chinami snaps and sends him flying with a mighty kick. Unfortunately, they were at the swimsuit competition phase, and Chinami's string-bikini bottom unties and flutters away as a result. He/She still wins a special prize nonetheless.
-   _Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?_: Bell and Ryuu are rescued from the Dungeon and hospitalized. When Ryuu wakes up, she gets up and tries to find Bell without bothering to change out of her hospital gown. When she finds him, the stress from all her running makes the gown fall apart, leading to a Naked Freak-Out.

-   _KanColle_: In Episode 6, Zuikaku notices that Shoukaku has spilled a drop of curry on her skirt. When she tries to rub it away, she winds up pulling off Shoukaku's skirt with incredible ease. An embarrassed Shoukaku then starts running around in panic, causing them to forget about the curry competition.
-   During a Beach Episode in _Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl_, Hazumu's swimsuit top almost falls off.
-   _Kemeko Deluxe!_ has probably the most unbelievable malfunction that happened in Anime history via Standard Snippet. A pair of glass happens to fall right on Izumi's bikini strings unlacing the knot causing her top fall off right in front of Sanpeita while Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" making the moment verge on Mundane Made Awesome territory. Izumi gets a full-body blush and a Naked Freak-Out before delivering a Unprovoked Pervert Payback via Megaton Punch.
-   At the prefectural swimming tournament in episode 8 of _Kenko Zenrakei Suieibu Umisho_, Momoko gets coerced into making a bet with Nanjou, the other team's captain, that the loser of the 100-meter freestyle has to have a "nip slip" in front of the crowd. Momoko wins, and while she's rubbing it in, the crotch of her swimsuit snaps. While Momoko has a Naked Freak-Out, Nanjou gets jealous and pulls her own swimsuit down to show off, Amuro offers to strip as well, and Captain Ikariya apparently already has, again. In the next chapter/episode, Momoko confiscates the pictures that Takeda took that day... and gives them to the school newspaper.
-   Sheryl Nome in _Macross Frontier_ ends up subverting the Impossibly-Low Neckline of her one-piece tube dress. When the ship she's on is attacked, everyone ends up falling to the ground, with the lights flickering off. When the lights come back on it's revealed her dress _does_ fall off, all the way down to her waist with conveniently placed hair on her chest. It doesn't stop her from slapping Alto for seeing her.
-   _Maria†Holic_: Poor Ayari suffered this... _twice_. Both incidents even happened at the same feast. The first was as a child, when Shizu (then posing as Mariya) stumbled on her and accidentally revealed her panda-print panties. The second was as a teenager, after Mariya saved her from falling off her float by pulling down her School Swimsuit. Cue Ayari's Skyward Big "NO!" and Kanako staining the statue of the Virgin Mary with her epic nosebleed.
-   In _Mazinkaiser_'s Beach Episode, Sayaka starts marching angrily towards the Iron Masks (apparently to give them a piece of her mind) and Kouji tries to stop her by grabbing her shoulder, only to slip and accidentally undo her bikini top. When the Iron Masks get completely distracted on Sayaka's bare breasts, Kouji decides to weaponize it so they can escape and prevents her from covering herself with her arms.
-   Roughly 75% of the jokes from _Miss Machiko_ invoke this trope. Machiko is often the victim of this in alternative to Clothing Damage (in every case she will lose her dress).
-   _My Dress-Up Darling_:
    -   Almost happens to Marin during the first cosplay event. She noticed that Shizuku-tan, the character she wanted to cosplay at, had a bigger bust than hers so she put on _two_ nubras to make her chest bigger. This naturally put a heavy strain on the costume as it was made for her exact size, forcing Gojo to fix it up before it could rip open.
    -   Later, Gojo manages to help Shinju Inui pull off a cosplay as Souma (a male character) by compressing her _huge_ chest with a combination of a sarashi and B-Holder. Unfortunately, they end up giving in to the pressure after a while.
    -   Defied later on when they're making the costume of Arisa, a girl who dresses up like a Playboy Bunny. Marin seems disappointed when the salesman explains that the bustier is designed so that it won't fall off, implying she was expecting this trope to happen.
-   _Mysterious Girlfriend X_: Identical Stranger Mokona, posing as Urabe and wearing her clothes, accidentally gives Tsubaki a free show when she bends down because her breasts are two to three sizes too small for Urabe's bra. When she realises this after he asked her to do it again... boot to the head.
-   _One Piece_: During the Wano Arc, when Hawkins bursts into the spa where Nami and Robin are hiding out looking for them, Nami's Modesty Towel ends up slipping loose and falling off, much to the shock and enjoyment of everyone there (especially Sanji).
-   _Prison School_: Happens to Meiko, on multiple occasions, wears clothes that are way too tight for her curvaceous figure and end up giving out and tearing at the most inopportune moments.
    -   Mari gives her a suffocatingly tight but more modest school uniform. Meiko thinks this is her actual punishment for the incident with Gakuto's action figure but later, when trying to goad Andre to go through the prison's fence, the uniform gives out and tears, which excites Andre enough to charge through the fence just as Mari planned.
    -   The back of the pants of her prison uniform tear as she's trying to quickly complete her task of digging a large hole.
    -   In a flashback chapter, Meiko's Sarashi audibly tears when she stands up too fast in class to answer a teacher's question.
-   A-ko often in _Project A-Ko_. When she is particularly embarrassed, one of her bra straps will slip down her shoulder, often with some of the shirt accompanying it. She also often gets into situations that become an innocent Panty Shot, not that she takes it that way.
-   Happens to Rio at least Once per Episode in _Rio -Rainbow Gate!-_:
    -   Rio's wedding dress gets ripped at the skirt by Mint after the latter trips and grabs it at the end of episode one, much to the delight of Tom Howard. Gets followed by a Scream Discretion Shot by Rio.
    -   Almost happens to Rio during the virtual beach volleyball game in the giant roulette challenge in episode 2, when the top of her bikini gets undone, but somehow it gets fixed shortly after.
    -   One instance borders on Clothing Damage, where Rio and her Childhood Friend Rina are pitted battle of skeet shoot where they shoot coins. A miss by the shooter (when it's her turn) results in her (already skimpy clothing) getting undone piece by piece (in fact the first one results in a Navel-Deep Neckline).
        -   And at the end of that challenge which resulted in a draw, Rio, whose hotpants were undone in the match, ends up absentmindedly dropping them in full view of the spectators, much to her horror.
    -   To date, the only time she never got hit with this trope is at episode 5.
    -   After not being hit with this trope for how many episodes, she gets hit again; in episode 10. This time, though, she actually lampshades it.
-   The DVD versions of _Queen's Blade_ allows any nipple flashes that would naturally happen from those outfits to take place. Most noticeable with Menace's version of the second season-ending, where she exposes her breasts with _every step she takes_.
-   Episode 7a of _Sakura Trick_ promises one in the title, and delivers: Mitsuki's bikini top falls off.
-   Episode seven of _Sands of Destruction_ deals with Morte ripping her skirt because Taupy accidentally pushed Kyrie onto her. She doesn't notice; although everyone else does, they're all too scared to tell her.
-   Downplayed in a skit in episode 3 of _Servant × Service_. The buxom Lucy has all hooks on her bra broken, and the tension was about how her coworkers get to resolve the issue while tiptoeing around the issue itself. Eventually, Yutaka claimed Lucy had a fever because of her blush and should "go back to rest;" the others immediately got the hint. No fanservice was even intended in the skit as she wears conservatively.
-   _Sgt. Frog_: Whenever Natsumi gets hit with the age ray in the manga, she always gets a wardrobe malfunction. Whether reverting back her regular age, and suddenly finding herself topless in front of a crowd of nerdy guys, or losing her ski suit to an explosion, it's pretty much a given.
-   Happens all the time to _Super Sonico_ in the many manga adaptations; about two of every three times she's wearing a bikini, her top will snap at some point. To make things worse for the poor girl, it usually happens at the worst possible moment, such as in the middle of a photo shoot, when she's in a stage giving a concert for millions, or when she's at the beach with everyone staring at her as she rides her savior dolphin back to the coast. Official artworks tend to chronicle her many wardrobe malfunctions as well; one of them even shows her bikini top and bottom snapping _at the same time_. The ultimate example, though, was in an episode of the anime, in which _her whole costume melted in the middle of a concert_. Cue her horrified scream. The last case was also an example of the trope being invoked since the costume was specifically designed to melt and leave its wearer in the buff.
-   Ryoko invokes this towards Ayeka in the fourth episode of _Tenchi Muyo!_. The princess had just realized Tenchi was now in the girls' bath (again, thanks to Ryoko), and is caught in something of a daze by being in the baths with him. Realizing how prim, proper and utterly boring she's being, Ryoko livens things up by undoing the tie on Ayeka's towel, exposing her in front of Tenchi.
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_: Averted during the Hot Springs Episode, when girl's Modesty Towels are unraveling, Kamina eagerly looks, only to find out they were wearing bikinis under the towels. Played Straight at the end where Yoko's bikini top falls off while she is jumping vigorously, prompting the boys to stare and for her to have a Naked Freak-Out as she runs away crying.
-   _Time Bokan_: In episode 2 Mirenjo starts an exhibition during the battle in a Pom-Pom Girl outfit that ends with a Wardrobe Malfunction distracting for a second the heroes mecha.
-   _Tomo-chan Is a Girl!_: Tomo is rather stacked and her bust has to be binded for her role as The Prince in the school play. Apparently it wasn't enough as they end up busting out of said bindings.
-   Chapter 10 of _Usotsuki Paradox_ which has the male lead Youkadou strip the female lead Seiyuu of her bikini top leaving her topless and forcing her to hug Yukadou to avoid getting caught by her friends.
-   In one of the mini-specials of _You're Under Arrest!_, Natsumi and Miyuki pull over a Rich Bitch who uses her daddy's connections to avoid consequences for her reckless driving. To get their revenge, later they pretend to be apologizing, and while Natsumi distracts her (loosening her dress straps), Miyuki pretends to check on her car and adjusts the oil cap. When the car breaks down later, she angrily gets out to check it, and then the dress comes loose, leaving her in bra and panties for everyone to see.

Luckily for her, Ninjette is her best gal-pal who has absolutely no hangups about nudity, while Thugboy is her devoted boyfriend, while the reader doesn't get to see anything.
-   In the _Smallville Season 11_ comic, Diana's first adult encounter with her Childhood Friend Steve Trevor ends up in one, when she ends up showing up at his apartment unannounced while he was showering and he ends up losing his Modesty Towel when he confronts her.

    Fan Works 

-   Discussed in _Amazing Fantasy_. Izuku, being a Genre Savvy Hero Fan Boy, is aware that many early superheroes wore Underwear of Power in case the spandex they were wearing tore.

-   One _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ sketch ("Scott of The Sahara") has the female lead of a movie being filmed run from a monster and get various articles of clothing caught and ripped off by the cacti she passed while fleeing.

-   _Eerie Cuties_: Deliberately invoked by naughty succubus Chloe as bait for Blair. "Oopsie! wardrobe malfunction!"
-   In _El Goonish Shive_, this is a possible result of dynamic morphs, which has happened many times to Tedd.
-   _Ennui GO!_: Darcy uses one to her advantage in "Planned" (NSFW), when a perfectly-timed failure of her costume's top, combined with her faux-embarrassed reaction, helps her win a cosplay contest.

-   Ozzy Man Reviews: In the video "Live TV Fails", a woman attempts twerking on live television in a tight-fitting dress that zips in the back. It rips.
    
    **Ozzy Man:** Look how excited everyone is over an arse. They're all chanting 'We saw ya butt hole! We saw ya butt hole!' \[...\] Crikey, we are a simple species, aren't we?

-   In an episode of _6teen_, Nikki wears a long, purple dress in order to impress a boy (not Jonesy), and stands too close to the going-down escalator. Guess what happens?
-   _Archer_: Malory hires a black Jewish man to fulfill minority hiring requirements, and Archer confronts him in the locker room, with both wearing Modesty Towels. When they end up nearly fighting, both towels fall off.
    
    **Lana:** Wh-what do we even know about him?  
    **Archer:** Only that he's not circumcised.  
    **Lana:** Okay. Glossing over _how_ you know that...  
    **Archer:** We touched penises.  
    **Lana:** No! _Glossing!_
    
-   Doctor Blight in _Captain Planet and the Planeteers_, when she squeezes into a pair of her sister's shorts in an attempt to disguise herself as her sister. As Blight sits down, she splits the shorts.
-   Disney animated shorts saw this happen to Donald Duck on several occasions:
    -   _Bellboy Donald_ (1942): Donald loses his entire bellboy uniform as a troublesome child sticks part of it between an elevator door... and the elevator moves, completing the deed. Hand covers crotch and deep blush immediately follows.
    -   _Tea for Two Hundred_ (1948): Donald digs for food stolen by ants inside their hole. Rather pull the food out, they pull his entire outfit _in_, leaving him above ground completely naked. Moment of embarrassment follows.
    -   _Hook, Lion, and Sinker_ (1950): As Donald is cooking in his kitchen, two lions steal fish stacked on the windowsill, one at a time, bucket-brigade style. Having run out of fish but assuming there is more to steal, the next items blindly grabbed —in order and sequentially — are his chef's hat, matching bib, his entire outfit, Donald _himself_, and the gun he was holding _before_ being tossed out the window. Cartoon logic in this backward order; after the brigade is out of items, Donald, once again fully clothed and armed, greets them on the far end.
-   _Family Guy_: The plot for "PTV" kicks off with David Hyde Pierce's scrotum falling out during the Emmys, in a thinly disguised parody of the Trope Namer. Peter missed the incident because he was forced to see Meg's play. The same episode directly parodied it during a rapid-fire montage at the end of the "Freakin' FCC" song with a clip of Peter flashing his nipple.
-   _Harley Quinn (2019)_: Harley winds up hanging by the seat of her pants from a stalactite, exposing her backside for all to see. Thankfully for her, the only witness is a disinterested Batman.
-   _Kim Possible_: Sidekick Ron Stoppable's falling-pants is a running gag that happens Once per Episode. When it happens in the Amnesia Episode, it triggers Kim's memories of him.
-   _The Loud House_: In an episode where Lincoln films his sisters doing embarrassing things around the house one of the things he captures is punk rocker, Luna jumping up and performing the splits only to split her pants.
-   In _Pet Pals_, Madame's dress gets ripped off after Top Hat accidentally closes the car door on it. She is then subjected to humiliation by being flashed by photographers. This may or may not be an enforced example since part of the scene appears in the trailer and it happens _6 minutes into the movie itself._
-   _Pound Puppies (1980s)_ had one in the episode "A Tail of a Pup" where the Safety pin on Whopper's diaper came undone and it fell off.
-   _Robot Chicken_ has a cloth-ripping incident happening during a chase scene... for the funeral of Benny Hill, fittingly.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   Happens to Homer Simpson's salamander costume at the end of "See Homer Run" where he tries to run for Mayor of Springfield.
    -   Homer also fell victim to this trope in "Treehouse Of Horror III":
        
        **Homer:** Hail Caesar, in all his glory!  
        _\[the hem of his toga snags on a loose nail as he's coming down the basement stairs\]_  
        **Cloth of toga:** RRRIIIIIPPP!
        
    -   In "Trash Of The Titans", U2 is hanging out at Moe's during the musical number "The Garbage Man Can":
        
        **U2:** (_singing in unison_) The sanitation folks are jolly friendly blokes, courteous and easy-going...
        
        **The Edge:** They mop up when you're overflowing...
        
        (_A Garbage Man whispers something to Bono_)
        
        **Bono:** And tell you when your arse is showing.
        
        (_The members of U2 pull up their pants in unison_)
        
-   In the _South Park_ episode "Good Times with Weapons", Cartman walks onto a stage stark naked, believing in his (imaginary) power to turn invisible. When put on the spot about this "scandalous" display, he replies, "I told you, it was a wardrobe malfunction!"
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_: SpongeBob rips his pants accidentally while trying to lift weights; he then does this intentionally because it makes people laugh.
-   _Total Drama_: In "X-Treme Torture", Heather's top gets stuck in a tree branch and comes off while she was trying to cheat by cutting Harold's rope. He still loses the challenge after getting distracted by the view.
