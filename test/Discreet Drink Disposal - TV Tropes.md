Some people's idea of "discreet" is a little looser than others.

Heroes will every once in a while be offered a drink that they'd rather not partake of. Maybe they don't trust the one who gave it to them because they were nervously fiddling with a big ring while they poured the drink. Maybe it's paint stripper-grade rotgut from a local Hillbilly Moonshiner. Maybe they are The Teetotaler, Can't Hold His Liquor, or need to be on the top of their game for an upcoming fight, and can't just say so without giving something away. Whatever the reason, they'll discreetly pour it out or pass it off while no-one's looking.

Often happens because a particular culture or subculture has a ritual that revolves around the drink in question and thus refusing the drink would be very impolite (or even dangerous). This is very much Truth in Television, particularly at very formal events such as weddings, funerals, and star-studded fundraisers, which usually involve a different drink for every course and a lot of toasting. Toasting with a glass that isn't full is generally considered very impolite, but actually drinking all of those drinks would generally be dangerous to one's health.

Can also be used by a snobbish Big Bad to express disdain for the drink (the vintage isn't good enough for their refined palate), the heroes, or both. As such, it can function as a Kick the Dog moment for a villain. Often associated with The Vamp.

Compare Slipping a Mickey if poison is involved. Discreet Dining Disposal is the same thing done with food. Overlaps with That Poor Plant when the high-potency drink is poured on a potted plant.
