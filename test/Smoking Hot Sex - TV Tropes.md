Hopefully only their sex is on fire, not also their bedsheets.

_There are times that you need a cigarette! ...You don't wanna roll off somebody and go "Whoo, that was amazing! Skittles? Would you like some Skittles? How 'bout a Jolly Rancher, baby?"_

— **Dave Attell**

After sex, two lovers share a post-coital cigarette. Frequently, as in the picture, they'll do so sitting up in bed wearing a Modesty Bedsheet.

This trope hit an early peak during The '60s and The '70s, when anti-tobacco campaigns were in their most embryonic form and media as a whole was undergoing a transition to a new sexual frankness. Given changes that have occurred in society since then, it is mostly a Dead Horse Trope at this point, though it often pops up in parody and often happens in real life (the logic being that one satisfying sensation plus another satisfying sensation equals good.) Often used as a metaphor to say sex has taken place without showing it.

One occasionally seen variation is the post-sex pizza (maybe it's easier to get past the Moral Guardians?) Likely to happen right after a Post-Coital Collapse.

    Literature 

-   In the _Doctor Who_ Eighth Doctor Adventures novel _The Gallifrey Chronicles_, Fitz and Trix have an implied intimate moment. Fitz lights a cigarette after and she scolds him, since he's from the 1960s but she's not and doesn't share his belief that it's normal for everyone to smoke everywhere at any time. He complains about how weird it is that people from the future must "all just go straight to sleep", but eventually submits to being kicked out of his own bed to go smoke elsewhere (wearing a dressing gown), where he runs into the Doctor and catches another lecture for smoking. Oddly, despite how suggestive that entire scene was, she later claims to have never had sex with him, in a situation in which she'd have no reason to lie.
-   _The Dresden Files_: Played for Laughs (rather morbid laughs, but still) in _Ghost Story_, after ghost!Harry briefly possesses Molly's (his apprentice who is hopelessly and unrequitedly in love with him) body. When they are separated again, Molly grimly quips something along the lines of, "So you've finally been inside me. I feel like I should offer you a cigarette."
-   Weird variation in the _Johannes Cabal the Necromancer_ story "A Long Spoon". Cabal who is borderline asexual has a Meet Cute with a succubus. While that factor keeps them from having sex as does the fact that she can't have sex without killing her partner and eating their soul, he does agree to watch her shag the villain of the story to death (supposedly for "scientific purposes"), and afterward is smiling and smoking a cigarette.
-   A gay example: _Look Down In Mercy_ has Kent and Anson light up after they have sex for the first time. It creates a faint glow on the mosquito net surrounding their bed. Perhaps it could help them relax from hiding their relationship.
-   Older Than Radio: Rodolphe lights up a cigar after he and Emma have (dubiously-consensual) sex in _Madame Bovary_.
-   In the Sidney Sheldon novel _Master Of The Game_, after having been beaten and sodomized by George Ellis, Eve Blackwell awakens to find him sitting in a chair and smoking, driving home the sickening point that he genuinely took pleasure in brutalizing her so.
-   In the book _Millennium (1983)_ by John Varley, the hero, Louise Baltimore, is from the future. The air has become so polluted that humans have been adapted to it. When she travels back in time to the 20th century, she is constantly smoking cigarettes to help her breathe. Anyway, this is all leading up to when she finishes sex, she immediately lights one causing her partner to comment, "Do you always smoke after sex?". She then looks at her crotch, to make the obvious joke.
-   _The Time Traveler's Wife_ is well aware of this trope's implications, using it to point up just how stereotypically masculine Gomez is. (Henry, a more sophisticated sort, notably does _not_ engage in this.)

-   _Becker_
    -   Referenced in an episode where Becker is trying to quit smoking. He gets frustrated and manages to replace one addiction with another by gaining a sex buddy.

    -   When he crawls down the fire escape to retrieve his last cigarette, which he dropped out the window, and encounters a couple having sex in the apartment below, they are shocked - and then he asks, "I don't suppose you two are going to have a smoke after you're done?"

-   Shows up fairly frequently (as in, five minutes into the pilot and then a lot afterwards) in _Mad Men_ (Duck Phillips does this after doing _ahem_ with Peggy like it's his job), though this might be a reflection of the fact that on that show, Everybody Smokes constantly. It also fits well with the style of the show, as creator Matthew Weiner says he tries to use elements of the "visual vocabulary" of the time in the show.
-   _Married... with Children_:
    -   Marcy was fighting stage fright in front of a group by imagining herself in bed. It got so intense that she had an orgasm right in front of everyone and was seen with a lit cigarette in her hand that just appeared out of nowhere.

-   Brian Kinney of _Queer as Folk (US)_ takes a post-gay sex smoke occasionally.
-   _Red Dwarf_:
    -   The pizza variation appears in an episode; Rimmer recounts the one and only time he made love, which only took twelve minutes, and that includes the time it took to eat the pizza.

-   Parodied, kind of, on _Will & Grace_, when Karen reads Jack's hot gay romance "novel" and apparently enjoys it so much that she has to have a cigarette afterwards (and surprisingly, despite her many addictions, she is not portrayed as a smoker otherwise).

-   Referenced hilariously in _Wings_. Lowell declares that he's going to move out of Joe and Brian's house so that he and reconciled ex Bunny won't feel so "inhibited". Brian's incredulous response? "THAT was inhibited? When you were done, _I_ smoked a cigarette!"
