In various forms of media, main characters are killed off from time to time. This usually happens in the middle of a work, but not always.

Sometimes, to further the story along and make a lasting impact, a main character is killed at the very end. This leaves the consumer emotionally impacted for years to come.

Sub-trope of Grand Finale. Not to be confused with Deadly Distant Finale.

## As this is a Death Trope and an Ending Trope, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.

In order, Killsen was killed by Prince, Durkin and Mabel died exorcizing the demon from Durkin's body while Prince fell on his own knife, and then Vid and Sarah both died in the climax. At the end, most of the deceased characters are shown spending time together, picnicking with Ghost Lady, while the survivors try and recover.

-   _Farscape_'s finale miniseries had Jool be blown up by a Scarran attack, D'Argo is fatally wounded and makes a Last Stand so the others can escape, and Harvey auto-deletes himself after Einstein removes the wormhole knowledge from Crichton's head.

-   _Person of Interest_: As Season 5 draws to a close, it isn't a question of _who_ will be killed off, but who _won't_. In the end, John Reese is the only main character who dies in the series finale. Barely averted with Root, who is killed three episodes before.
-   _The Strain (TV series)_ had no fewer than _four_ deaths in rapid succession. First, Quinlan and The Master (in Palmer's body) engaged in combat which ended with Quinlan mortally wounding The Master. In his dying throes, The Master then savagely beats Quinlan to death and tries to transfer his consciousness to Zach. Eph intervenes and becomes The Master's new host instead, effectively dying as a result. Zach then sets off the nuclear bomb which kills both him and The Master.

    Video Games 

-   John Marston is killed by a firing squad in _Red Dead Redemption_. You play the epilogue as his son, Jack Marston, but you're not given any story missions (only one stranger mission) and you're allowed to just roam around and finish any business you had and 100% complete the game.
    -   The prequel, _Red Dead Redemption II_ does the same thing: Arthur Morgan dies at the end (either gets killed or succumbs to his illness), while you play the epilogue as John Marston, the protagonist from the first game.
