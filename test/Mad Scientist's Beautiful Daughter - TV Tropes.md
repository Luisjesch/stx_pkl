_"He's a mad scientist and I'm his beautiful daughter."_

A Mad Scientist has only one child — a beautiful but innocent girl in her late teens or early twenties, who loves her father dearly, and whom he has kept cloistered away from the world. Sometimes she has some small doubts about his goals or methods. Often overlaps with The Ugly Guy's Hot Daughter.

When the Mad Scientist is a good guy, the Daughter is not nearly so cloistered, although she is still a prime candidate as a love interest. Sometimes she ends up The Heart or The Smart Girl when a team relies on the Scientist for their Phlebotinum. This latter version is more common nowadays.

This trope is Older Than Feudalism, Medea — and many Fairy Tale heroines — being a recognizable form of it, even if it's the mad wizard's beautiful daughter.

May overlap with Daddy's Little Villain. Might also end up being a Perky Female Minion or Dark Action Girl, if she frequently helps her father in his work. Sister trope to Science Hero's Babe Assistant, where she's a love interest to the scientist rather than his daughter.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Bakugan_:
    -   There is a Mad Scientist's Beautiful _Granddaughter_ in Alice, granddaughter of Dr. Michael, The Dragon (not literally, the _literal_ dragon is the Big Bad.) Somewhat subverted in that he's not _exactly_ evil, just heavily affected by the negative energy caused by an experiment. After he is purified, he becomes an ally to the team.
-   _Bleach_: Nemu, the daughter of Mad Scientist Mayuri Kurotsuchi, who is quite calm and nice despite her oddities, unlike her dad. For bonus points, Nemu doesn't have a mother, she was created by Mayuri from his own genetic material, making her his opposite sex clone as well as his daughter.
-   _Boruto_:
    -   It turns out that Mitsuki is the Mad Scientist Orochimaru's Handsome Son. Mitsuki says he respects his parent, but thankfully, doesn't seem to have inherited Oro's twisted personality and madness.
    -   It also turns out that Sumire is the daughter of a Mad Scientist who had been a loyal follower of Danzo, and brainwashed her into being his Tyke Bomb to destroy Konoha in revenge for the destruction of ROOT.
-   _Cyborg 009_:
    -   Dr. Isaac Gilmore is child-less, and he subverts this by gaining the Cyborgs as his adoptive children _after_ he stops being a Mad Scientist. And there's the little detail that he was among the mad scientists who _created the cyborg team_ in the first place.
    -   Also subverted by Cynthia Findor, since her father _is_ doing really crazy experiments but NOT willingly. In fact, Black Ghost kidnapped _her_ to reinforce their intentions to keep Dr. Findor under their thumb.
-   In _D.Gray-Man_, the Action Girl Lenalee Lee is the younger sister of Mad Scientist Komui, who raised her. Being an active fighter of evil, Lenalee isn't exactly sheltered, but her brother's attempts to protect her Innocence is the stuff of legends; i.e., When all other attempts have failed, he is usually woken up by being told that Lenalee is getting married, which causes him to immediately wake up and starts freaking out about it.
-   _Franken Fran_: Made more of in the manga. Madaraki Fran is certainly the beautiful daughter of Dr. Madaraki, for a given value of "beautiful", and for a given value of "daughter". She actually takes after her father and generally (almost) everything that happens in the manga is her fault.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_:
    -   Riza Hawkeye is the Crazy Alchemist's Beautiful Daughter.
    -   Not to mention Nina. Sure, she is just five and anything but a love interest to the heroes, but she is cute, adorable, adores her State Alchemist Dad who shelters her and maybe would have grown into a very cute young woman if her father hadn't used her for chimera experiments that ultimately doomed her.
-   In _GaoGaiGar_, Guy is the mad scientist's handsome son in this case. He is the son of GGG's lead inventor and got his good looks from his deceased mom. When he was near death, his father managed to save his life using classified military technology, transforming 95% of his body into a cyborg.

-   _Gundam_:
    -   Aina Sahalin in _Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team_ is the Mad Scientist's Beautiful Sister, as well as the test pilot for her brother Ghinias's doomsday device. She eventually decides to turn against him when he goes full-on underpants-on-head crazy and starts shooting at her for trying to negotiate a truce.
    -   The original _Mobile Suit Gundam_ inverts this with the aging leader of Zeon Degwin Zabi, who's fairly reasonable for a tyrannical dictator with a shady past, at least compared to his more handsome son Gihren, who's basically a space Nazi. In the end, Degwin attempts to surrender to the Federation, and Gihren wipes him out along with half of the Federation's forces with the Colony Laser.
    -   From the perspective of "everyone not living in Zeon and consequently fearing the entire Zabi family", Degwin's _very pretty looking_ youngest son Garma is this played straight.
    -   Athrun Zala in _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_ is this note-for-note. He tries to deal with the consequences in the sequel.
    -   _Huge_ subversion in _Mobile Fighter G Gundam_. We thought that main character Domon Kasshu was the Mad Scientists's Handsome Son... but he wasn't. Then we thought he was the Magnificent Bastard's Handsome Younger Brother... Guess what. He wasn't. His partner Rain Mikamura, on the other hand...
-   _Kill la Kill_: Subverted with Ryuko, since her father Isshin was a perfectly sane man and the Big Good of the story, despite his eccentric appearance. Double Subverted when it's shown that her mother is Ragyo, who experimented on and threw her away as a child. This also means that Satsuki counts, as well.
-   _Lyrical Nanoha_:
    -   Fate Testarossa fits surprisingly well despite being The Dragon in the first season of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha_. Beautiful but innocent girl? Check. Loves her (equally beautiful) Mad Scientist mother dearly? Check. Cloistered away from world? Check. Betray mother at inopportune time? Check, though she still held out for her mother's redemption after helping in Storming the Castle. Did so because she fell in love with the heroine? Depending on who you ask, small, kinda check or very, very big check.
    -   Jail Scaglietti from _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_ considers his twelve Numbers as daughters, who see him as their father as well. And the whole family have only good looking members. Only five (actually four<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ) of them are Daddy's Little Villains, the other seven pull a Heel–Face Turn after being arrested by the TSAB.
-   _Made in Abyss_ has Prushka, the adoptive daughter of the White Whistle Bondrewd the Novel. Unlike most examples, her awareness of her father's actions is fairly significant. The degree of isolation that she lives in is enough for her to be incapable of seeing anything wrong with it, though, to the extent of seeing the failed Praying Hands as a tragic necessity and being unbothered when she discovers her father's Cartridges.
-   In the continuities where Juuzo Kabuto is crazier, Kouji Kabuto from _Mazinger Z_ fits as the Mad Scientist's Cute Grandson.
    -   Lorelei — a secondary character from _Shin Mazinger_ whom Shiro got a crush on — also fits.
    -   Lisa, on the other hand, subverted it. Her father — Professor Gordon — was completely sane.
-   Played with in _Midori Days_, where Mad Scientist Shiro Makinoha wants to capture Seiji and Midori so he can experiment on them, and his daughter Nao wants to stop Shiro since she is in love with ... Midori.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_:
    -   Ritsuko and Misato, the former of which takes up the mad science herself, but has yet to procreate. Shinji himself may count as the Mad Scientist's Cute-looking Son, depending on your view. One of the few examples to have mad science on _both_ sides of his family.
    -   Asuka. She's beautiful, smart, and a potential love interest for the protagonist. She loves her Mad Scientist mother dearly.
    -   Although Rei is not biologically related to Gendo, she is very much introduced this way in a more archetypical fashion than any of the above (socially inexperienced quiet girl, the only one Gendo shows anything resembling humanity around, protagonist gets interested in her, gradually comes to doubt Gendo's methods and betrays him for the protagonist, etc.)
-   In _Romeo × Juliet_, Romeo Condore Van diMontague is the son of the dictator of Neo Verona, the ruthless Leontes Montague, as well as the love interest of Juliet Fiamatta Errs diCapulet, the long-lost heiress of the Capulets. Actually, there are **two** Mad Dictator's Handsome Sons: one is Romeo and the other is his half-brother Tybalt, who is still Juliet's cousin since his mom was a Capulet. Or **three**, if we count Mercutio... Dude, that's one messed-up family tree.
-   _Sailor Moon_:
    -   Professor Souichi Tomoe, the Mad Scientist of the third season, has a beautiful young daughter named Hotaru. Who actually happens to be a) possessed by Mistress 9, the season's Dragon, and b) unknown even to herself until the end, the heroic Magical Girl Sailor Saturn. (Oh, and she's also about twelve years old. Most of the time. And in the manga, a Cyborg. She becomes fully human later, though.)
    -   Hotaru is a slight subversion as she's only around 12 when she's introduced; her being reborn as an infant and later growing up to around this age, but appearing younger (possibly due to a change in art style in the last season) complicates her real age. However when she's possessed by Mistress 9, her body grows up into a beautiful young woman.
-   Minato Sahashi is a male example, in _Sekirei_. His mother is the head scientist of the Sekirei Plan, and leaves him innocent and oblivious to her work, as well as the identity of his father. It is, of course, Big Bad Minaka. Higa mistakenly believes the younger Sahashi sibling, Yukari, to be this as well. She's not, and sets fire to his penthouse on her way out.
-   _Soul Eater_: Medusa's child Chrona joins the heroes, albeit unwillingly at first. They become affectionate towards Maka, and to a lesser extent the other protagonists, but are kidnapped back and driven (more) insane. They do eventually betray Medusa, but remain an antagonist until the end of the series.
-   _Star Blazers_:
    -   Dubbing created one of these, with Princess Invidia in the second series, rewritten to be Zordar's daughter instead of a lover. Because of the prevalence of this trope, the change was fairly plausible.
    -   The Japanese manga omake "The Eternal Story of Jura", about Desslok's daughter. The pretty daughter part of it is played pretty straight; even though she's past the doubting stage about his methods and knows he's evil, she loves him. The betrayal was also done by Jura's mother, not Jura, but Jura condoned it.
-   Saiko Waitazuki from _Supercar Gattiger_, though her father isn't mad, but serves as the team's lead scientist.
-   _Tenchi Muyo!_:
    -   Ryoko, daughter of Washuu, is anything but cloistered or innocent. The mad scientist in question is her _mother_, and Ryoko generally refuses to even admit they're related (even though the resemblance could hardly be more obvious) — but she still falls for the hero.
    -   As it is, her mad scientist mother falls for the hero as well.
    -   Some adaptations of _Tenchi_ do have Ryoko rather scared of her mother because she likes using her as a guinea pig.
    -   Mihoshi is the mad scientist's great-grandaughter.
-   _Tokyo Ghoul_ has Akira Mado, the stunning daughter of "Quinque Maniac" Kureo Mado. She shares her father's passion for Quinque, and works closely with the Research division in her spare time. She inherited her looks from her late mother, and becomes Amon's new partner and Love Interest after her introduction.

    Ballads 

-   _Young Beichan_ is a rationalized version of the Fairy Tale — Doing In the Wizard was applied — but the heroine still can be recognized as this trope.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_:
    -   Talia Al-Ghul, the daughter of Ra's Al-Ghul. Her loyalty to her father is... complicated. In the comics, it is usually unwavering. When she foils his 'destroy the written word' scheme, a lackey shoots her in the leg; the lackey is soon fed to the lions. In the video game, _Batman: Arkham City_, it's played darkly when he makes a move of threatening Batman with her life if he does not kill him. This results her in leaving him after Batman saves her.
    -   Sofia Branch turned up in _Batman: The Black Mirror_ as the manager of Gotham's fastest growing bank. Who is Sofia Branch? She's the daughter of Tony Zucco, the killer of Dick Grayson's parents.
-   Dr. Zabo/Mr. Hyde doesn't have much in the looks department (and his inside matches is outside), which is probably why he frequented prostitutes. His daughter, Daisy Johnson/Quake is consistently described as gorgeous, and is one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s real lookers, and can't seem to do anything in civilian mode without someone hitting on her.
-   Alicia Masters of the _Fantastic Four_, stepdaughter of the Puppet Master.
-   Since Magneto is also a scientist, the Scarlet Witch and her (on and off, currently on) half-sister Polaris qualify. Wanda looks almost exactly like her mother.
-   Gender-flipped in _The Killers of Krypton_: Znd'r Kol is Empress Gandelo's handsome adoptive son, who inevitably falls for Supergirl, much to his mother's anger.
-   _Metamorpho_: Simon Stagg is a mad scientist and Corrupt Corporate Executive, while his daughter Sapphire is explicitly a _very_ beautiful woman. Part of the fuel for Rex Mason's desire for a cure is because he can't believe a woman as beautiful as her could ever love a man as disfigured as him. She can.
-   _New Gods_: Orion's wife Bekka is the daughter of Himon, the scientist that created the Mother Box and was even forced to work for Darkseid. During the "Death of the New Gods" it's implied that he became a Serial Killer and started murdering New Gods left and right, regardless if they were from Apokolipis or New Genesis. Turns out to be a Red Herring; the actual culprit is Infinity Man.
-   _Shazam!_:
    -   Doctor Sivana, nemesis of Captain Marvel, has a daughter with the painfully obvious name "Beautia"; naturally she sides with the Captain against her father.
    -   In this case Sivana also has a good/handsome son _and_ an evil/ugly daughter and son, who are perfectly happy to help their dad go up against Captain Marvel.
    -   Though in more modern works, his handsome son and daughter are portrayed as self-centered, spoiled brats while his ugly, brilliant children are their mother's un-favorites and running their own experiments just to impress their mostly absent father.
-   _Vampirella_: Ha Ha Ha! See my shoehorning device! The daughter of the mad scientist who sent a giant mecha against Vampirella doesn't fall straightly, but still clearly recognizable under this trope as she is still a child. And crippled. And the mech driver, mostly involuntarily. When Vampirella crashes the mech, opens it and learns she killed a child, you can practically see the steam blowing out of her ears.
-   Linea in _Warlord of Mars_ is a Black Martian noblewoman whose father is a mad priest of Issus that wants to activate a Doomsday Device that will wipe out all life on Mars (since the defeat of their people at the hand of the Red Martians, he would rather destroy the planet than let themselves be ruled by lesser races). It's revealed that her grandmother was Issus herself, and she qualifies as a Mad Goddess' Beautiful Granddaughter too.
-   Sorta done in _Werewolf by Night_. When traveling to an island for a cure for his werewolfism, Jack meets the local mad scientist Miles Blackgar and the beautiful daughter Marlene. Marlene helps Jack at first and doesn't even fear him when he's in wolf form, but after he knocks out her father she turns out to have a Gorgon gaze and turns Jack to stone for grabbing her arm. She also seems to help Jack more out of self preservation, since she mentions that her father ultimately intended to experiment on her, to cure her gaze of stone.
-   _Wonder Woman_ Vol 1: Gerta von Gunther plays with this trope, her mother Paula is definitely a Mad Scientist, and was a villain working for the Nazis when she first appeared but she was only working with the Nazis because they had Gerta and were threatening her life and Gerta is only old enough for her beauty to be evident years later after her mother switches sides out of gratitude when Diana saved Gerta. Gerta also turns out to be a Mad Scientist in her own right, but she's always kinder and more innocent than her mother.
-   Laura "X-23" Kinney . Her creator, Dr. Sarah Kinney, was described as the foremost expert on mutant genetics and was hired by the Facility after her proposal to clone Wolverine. Despite the ethics of the project, Sarah's interest was purely For Science!, directly likening the idea of cloning a _mutant_, when mainstream science had only _just_ cracked cloning sheep and cats, to godhood. All this knowing full well that the child would be raised to be a Living Weapon heading in. Laura herself is frequently described as Sarah's spitting-image (explained by some writers as Sarah using her own DNA to stabilize the sample taken from Wolverine), and it's made quite clear Laura is intended to be a quite beautiful young woman.
-   The Yellow Claw, a Marvel Comics Captain Ersatz for Fu Manchu, had a Beautiful Grandniece, who repeatedly betrayed him due to her love for FBI agent Jimmy Woo. Eventually, he put her in suspended animation until he could fuse her soul with that of a suitably power-mad Egyptian princess. Really.

    Comic Strips 

-   Princess Aura, daughter of Ming The Merciless, in the various versions of _Flash Gordon_.
-   In the _Star Wars Legends_ newspapers comic strip _The Second Kessel Run,_ the Empire forces a benevolent scientist to use his Weather-Control Machine to devastate Rebel Systems. They ensure his cooperation by taking his daughter and assistant (an attractive blonde) hostage. She quickly escapes, but has difficulty in contacting her father to let him know that.

    Fairy Tales 

-   Prunella is helped by the witch's handsome son.
-   _Snow-White-Fire-Red_:
-   _The Troll's Daughter_: The troll has a lovely daughter who he keeps in an undersea castle to keep anyone from taking her away. She has grown tired of it and plots with the hero to gain her freedom.
-   In _The Two Kings' Children_, the daughter advises the prince how to carry out her father's Impossible Task.
-   This is also the premise of tale type ATU 313, "The Magic Flight": the protagonist is promised/delivered to a troll (ogre, devil, witch), goes to the villain's home and is forced to perform difficult tasks for his employer. Fortunately, the villain's daughter meets the hero and falls in love with him, then helps him in the tasks with her magic powers.
-   This is the premise of tale type AaTh 428, "The Wolf" (after 2004, subsumed under new type ATU 425B, "Son of the Witch"): in Catalan and Italian variants, the heroine is helped by the witch's son, who is a normal human like the heroine.

    Fan Works 

-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   In the French fandom, Voldemort was supposed to have a daughter called Ange (false rumors copied on every fan site). She was rumored to enter Hogwarts in book five. Actually it was one of many false rumors that were copied from one French Harry Potter fansite to another.
    -   If fanfiction is anything to go by, Voldemort has about a million daughters. It seems he mostly sends them to Hogwarts to kill Harry only for them to (of course) fall in love with Harry. Expect her to show up openly using "Riddle" as her surname with the author acting as though we won't see The Reveal coming a mile away. If it's explained who her mother is, it will probably be Bellatrix.
    -   For awhile, it was rumored that Snape was Luna Lovegood's father, which would have kind of fit this trope. Too bad the identity of Luna's father was firmly established from the moment of her first appearance. Still J. K. Rowling ended up refuting this on her website.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Beauty and the Beast_ utilizes this with Belle and her father, with alterations in the form of the 'mad scientist' being a good person (more of a Bungling Inventor, really) and the fact that plot starts because the mad scientist's daughter is _loyal_ to him.
-   From _Despicable Me_, we have the cutest daughters: Margo, Edith, and Agnes.
-   _Groove Squad_ has the character, Star, who turns out to be the daughter to evil Mad Scientist, Dr. Nightingale. While he looks like a cartoony villain, Star is an attractive redhead who's more "high school evil" rather than "regular evil". Her mother is never seen, but Star probably got her looks from her.
-   _The Nightmare Before Christmas_:
    -   Dr. Finklestein and his beautiful artificial creation Sally. He's smotheringly overprotective, to the point that she has to poison him repeatedly to get a simple night out. Also, Finklestein is actually on friendly terms with Skellington — really, the person he antagonizes most is Sally.
    -   Interestingly, in an alternative ending, Finklestein being on friendly terms with Jack is subverted with Finklestein being _Oogie Boogie_, in order to teach Sally about choosing Jack over him, making the Finklestein/Sally relationship seem more carnal. This, along with canonically the next person the Doc creates to replace Sally seems to be a wife (who looks exactly like him and even shares half his brain), has quite a few fans calling bullshit on the "beautiful daughter" explanation.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Natalie Connors from _Agent Cody Banks_ fulfills this trope as if the writer had been reading this Wiki.
-   Tara from _Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!_ fits the trope almost perfectly (right down to the betrayal part), except for having been created by her mad-scientist father to be a cook, house-cleaner and sex-slave. You may squick if you wish.
-   Nanelia in _Battle Beyond the Stars_, though her father is senile rather than megalomaniacal. He wants the hero to stay and mate with his daughter instead of running about trying to recruit The Magnificent Seven Samurai to defend his planet. Fortunately Shad convinces Nanelia to escape with him, whereupon they have the requisite romance.
-   In the 1986 Ozploitation thriller _The Big Hurt_, a woman enlists an Intrepid Reporter to prove her research scientist father was murdered by a Government Conspiracy. It turns out that her father is very much alive and part of the conspiracy, to develop a mind-control drug, and she ends up killing him for real. Ironically the daughter has herself spent time in a mental institution, diagnosed as paranoid for insisting her father was murdered.
-   _Blade (1998)_: One of the vampire scions helps bring down her house.
-   _Bullshot_ (1983). Rosemary Fenton, though her father is more of an Absent-Minded Professor who's being forced to work for the villain. She does fall in love with the hero though.
-   Cally in _Doomsday_. Notable mostly because her father's paranoia over her brother's rebellion causes her to fear for her life from him, justifiably as he winds up blaming her for bringing in "impurity". Also notable because the main character is a woman, so Cally winds up a sort of Implied Love Interest for a more minor character.
-   As the song goes, "Anne Francis stars in _Forbidden Planet_", based on _The Tempest_, as Altaira, the Beautiful Daughter of the Mad Scientist, Dr. Morbius.
    -   Actually a semi-aversion, though, since Morbius specifically denies being a mad scientist, and is ultimately proven to be misguided rather than crazy.
-   The two Fu Manchu films to feature the scientist having a daughter:
    -   _The Mask of Fu Manchu_ has the canonical Fah Lo See. Although Fu Manchu refers to her as 'ugly', she's played by classic beauty Myrna Loy.
    -   _Daughter of the Dragon_ likewise has screen beauty Anna May Wong as Princess Ling Moy.
-   Elsa Frankenstein from _The Ghost of Frankenstein_ is Dr. Wolf Frankenstein's beautiful daughter. She has a more prominent role as the titular Mad Scientist in the sequel _Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man_.
-   Occasionally appearing in a _Godzilla_ movie as well, most notable being Katsura from _Terror of Mechagodzilla_, cyborg daughter of Dr. Mafune. Also, it is worth mentioning that Emiko Yamane, heroine of the original _Gojira_ film, was The Professor's daughter.
-   The learned Rabbi of the silent movie _The Golem_ has his beautiful daughter Miriam, who promptly falls in a forbidden love with the Christian Knight Florian. Their romance turns out to be a Red Herring Twist, though.
-   _Goliath Awaits_: Mad scientist might not be the right description for McKenzie but he is a somewhat unstable man who managed to achieve something miraculous with his saving the people on the ship and keeping it intact under water for 40 years. His daughter Lea is a pretty, somewhat sheltered girl who becomes the love interest of the story.
-   Amy Szalinski in _Honey, I Shrunk the Kids_ is an example of the daughter of a good guy mad scientist, Wayne Szalinski. However, she's not an only child, as she has a younger brother, Nick, and the sequels include another younger brother named Adam. She is, however, the only girl.
-   In _The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus_, Valentina is this to the doctor (who's not technically a scientist, but rather a mystic who made a Deal with the Devil).
-   In _The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996)_, they give the title doctor a beautiful cat-woman daughter — who conveniently slides into love interest for the hero Douglas.
    -   _Island of Lost Souls_ started the cat-woman daughter of the mad scientist.
-   _Island of the Fishmen_: Amanda Marvin is the daughter of Professor Ernest Marvin, a scientist who's turning the natives of the island into fish people to create a new dominant species for Earth after humanity has gone extinct.
-   In _The Killer Shrews_, a well-intentioned scientist has created giant shrews on an island in an attempt to cure world hunger. The hero must rescue the scientist's beautiful daughter from the island.
-   Freder Frederson of _Metropolis_ is a Slightly Unhinged Dictator's Handsome Son. Incidentally, the Mad Scientist was in love with Freder's mom.
-   Helen Kokintz in _The Mouse That Roared_, except that her father is not mad, just a bit eccentric.
-   _The Shadow_: Margo Lane is Dr. Reinhardt Lane's daughter. " _This_ is green..._that's_ red!"
-   Dione, the daughter of Melanthius in _Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger_ is an example of the daughter of a good scientist. And he is not really mad, just a little batty.
-   Kyra in _Sinbad of the Seven Seas_ is the daughter of the Cloud Cuckoo Lander inventor and "wizard" Nadir, and ends up as Sinbad's Love Interest.
-   In the cancelled _Spider-Man 4_, Peter was going to end up in a Dating Catwoman relationship with Felicia Hardy, who in this continuity was also the daughter of the Vulture.
-   _Top Secret!_: Nick's primary love interest is Hillary, a beautiful German woman who's associated with La Résistance. Her goal is to free her father Dr. Nicholas Flammond, a scientist who was kidnapped by the East German military and forced to build a doomsday weapon.
-   _Twice-Told Tales_: In "Rappaccini's Daughter" (adapted from the Nathaniel Hawthorne short story described in Literature below), Giacomo Rappaccini (Vincent Price) keeps his daughter Beatrice in a garden. A university student next door, Giovanni, sees her and falls in love. One of Giovanni's professors says that he used to teach with Rappaccini. Many years ago, Rappaccini abruptly quit academia and became a recluse after his wife ran away with a lover. Rappaccini has treated Beatrice with an exotic plant extract that makes her touch deadly; he does this to keep her safe from unwanted suitors, but it makes her a prisoner in her own home.
-   In _Willow_, Sorsha plays the Mad Sorceress's Beautiful Daughter. With some help from a Love Potion and her mother she performs a Heel–Face Turn.
-   _Young Sherlock Holmes_. Professor Waxflatter is more eccentric than mad, but his daughter is quite beautiful.

    Literature 

-   Subverted in Alexander Belayev's _The Air Seller_: while Nora Engelbrecht is certainly that trope, her father turns out to be not really mad. He is forced to serve the Big Bad Bayley, who secretly threatens to murder Nora if Prof. Engelbrecht will not help him with his Doomsday Device. At the end, Nora commits suicide to free her father and save the world.
-   In the _Animorphs_ series, the Andalite Estrid fits this outline fairly well, although she is only a protege of the Mad Scientist character, Arbat. (Ax speculates that Estrid may be Arbat's niece, but she is no relation at all.) Arbat is a kind of alien General Ripper who intends to deploy a biological weapon (which he designed with help from Estrid) that will destroy both the Yeerks that are invading planet Earth—and probably the human race along with them. When Estrid meets the Andalite main character Ax, they hit it off and she becomes Ax's Girl of the Week (not that he'd had any before). Estrid was initially a Well-Intentioned Extremist who agreed with Arbat's goals, but she became convinced it was wrong and helped to defeat Arbat.
-   Ennis of _Baccano!_, creation and "daughter" of the 1930 arc's Big Bad, Szilard. She does twist it slightly in that she betrays him not for The Hero, Firo (who, at that point, she thought was dead), but for the comic Outlaw Couple, Isaac and Miria. There's also the daughter of Mad Scientist and unapologetic Manipulative Bastard Huey Laforet, Chane Laforet, who falls in love with the Anti-Hero and professional assassin, Claire Stanfield. This ends up being subverted in that Chane doesn't betray her father for him - instead, Huey just hires Claire.
-   In _The Bride of the Wind_, the eponymous character's father was a scientist, and she said to be beautiful, if unique-looking.
-   Philip José Farmer gleefully inverted this trope with "The Beautiful Scientist and her Mad Daughter."
-   Subverted in _Die Alchimistin_. Aura Institoris is certainly beautiful, and kept cloistered in her castle and then at the institute at her father's wish, and her father in an alchemist who is most definitely not all there, and she is (in the beginning) his favorite child, but it turns out that he was maintaining their bond and keeping her away from theyo turns out that Aura's mother was her father's daughter as well.
-   The likeliest "tradithion" to spawn the beautiful Igorinas in the Discworld.
-   Miranda Taligent from the Steampunk novel _The Dream of Perpetual Motion_. She eventually goes mad herself.
-   _Durarara!!_ has Shinra as the Mad Doctor's Handsome Son. He's slightly more normal than his father Shingen, but he didn't get away without a screw or two loose.
-   _The First Law_ plays this straight with Bayaz and Tolomei. Then, in a brutal twist, it is revealed that Bayaz was the one who threw her from the tower, not her Mad Scientist father, in order to hold a monopoly over the secrets which she possessed.
-   The above two comic book examples both draw elements from Sax Rohmer's _Fu Manchu_ mythos, including the Beautiful Daughter; however, Fu's own daughter Fah Lo Suee was a full-fledged Femme Fatale (or even Vamp) rather than a cloistered innocent — just as likely to turn against him, but because she wanted to take his job....
-   In the short story "The Girl of My Dreams" by Hilary Ayer (a crossover between the _Torg_ and _Paranoia_ roleplaying universes), this is not just a trope, but a law of nature.
    
    **Professor Thistlebottam:** I was a Scientist, therefore I had to be either Sinister or Mad. I seem to have been cast as Mad, therefore by the laws of the cosm, I had to have a Beautiful Daughter.
    
-   Georgette Cuvelier in _Harry Dickson's Adventures_. The young woman turns out to be the daughter of Pr Flax, a former archenemy of the hero. Played straight in that she has a huge crush on Harry Dickson. Subverted in that she remains evil and would rather avenge her father and die than surrender.
-   _Heralds of Valdemar_:
    -   The _Mage Winds_ trilogy features Nyara, biological daughter and sexual/magical plaything of Big Bad Ma'ar in his latest incarnation. She "attempts escape" several times, but her Heel–Face Turn doesn't actually occur until Skif nearly dies to save her.
    -   Lackey's retelling of _Swan Lake_, _The Black Swan_, makes Odile into one of these. Her father expects her to betray him, which is painfully ironic since she is a textbook example of a Well Done Daughter Girl — the Heel–Face Turn starts because she starts actually spending time with the swans, instead of just looking down on them. The supernatural control, i.e. him using her as "Odette" _without her permission_, is just the last straw that makes her realize his true character. And her turning on him is hardly subtle - _she's_ the one to kill him, after all.
-   Though Sloan from the _Inheritance Cycle_ is more Jerkass than Big Bad (though he does betray his village in Book 2), his daughter Katrina might count.
-   Invoked in Gene Wolfe's "The Last Thrilling Wonder Story": the author is deliberately writing a pulp story, so _of course_ the scientist has a beautiful daughter, and the protagonist knows he will love her before they even meet.
-   Andre Caroff's _Madame Atomos_ was a vengeful scientist with a hard-on for radioactive zombies and madness beams. She created a younger version of herself named Mie as a backup plan, who promptly turned on her after falling for Atomos's nemesis, Smith Beffort of the FBI.
-   Children's author Allan Ahlberg wrote a notably creepy poem called _The Mad Professor's daughter_.
-   Played with in Theodora Goss's short story "The Mad Scientist's Daughter," which also namedrops a who's who of iconic Mad Scientists in fiction.
    -   The short story was later expanded into a series _Extraordinary Adventures Of The Athena Club_
-   More or less gender-inverted in _Mistborn: The Original Trilogy_ by Elend Venture, who is the handsome but innocent son of Evil Overlord Straff Venture. Ends up Defecting for Love.
-   The heroine of Edgar Rice Burroughs's _The Monster Men_ is the daughter of a mad scientist who is producing the title Monster Men — he hopes to marry her off to one. (He gets better, though.)
-   A Lampshade Hanging: in Robert A. Heinlein's novel _The Number of the Beast_, Deety Burroughs introduces her father and herself to her future husband Zeb Carter by declaring, "He's a Mad Scientist, and I'm his Beautiful Daughter." Zeb, in his role as the Narrator, comments immediately on the cliché.
-   In the _Peter Simple_ newspaper columns, "gnarled, apple-cheeked agrotechnologist Seth Roentgen" (a cross between a Mad Scientist and the most rustic of farmers) has a daughter, Hephzibah, who's 18 and a "ravishing sight in a mini-lab coat".
-   Elizabeth Faulkner, the daughter of an irrational Elizabethan steam-engineer, in _Phra the Phonecian_ by Edwin Arnold.
-   In Fyodor Sologub's _The Poisoned Garden_, the Professor's daughter, only called the Beauty, is an example. He uses her to lure young men into his garden and poison them in revenge for his ancestor's death.
-   In _Rappaccini's Daughter_, Beatrice is Giacomo Rappaccini's daughter. She's as beautiful and radiant as he's withered and unsettling. Giacomo Rappaccini's area of expertise are plant-based poisons and he's cultivated several new species just to get new poisons. Even Beatrice is subject of his experiments.
-   In one of the _Schaduw_ (Shadow) detective/policiers by Havank, a Dutch writer, the eponymous main character encounters the most beautiful young woman he's ever seen. As this happens in a remote castle somewhere in Normandy, she can't be anything but a Mad Scientist's daughter. The guy has engineered spiders to be a bit bigger and powerful (the biggest eats a grown pig in a couple of seconds), but he's disappointed their brains have not kept up. But now this human brain has come walking in ... perfect. The kicker: he's named his daughter Aranea (could have qualified as a Meaningful Name, but she herself tries to keep herself away from his shenanigans).
-   The title institution of _The Secrets of Drearcliff Grange School_ is basically a finishing school that turns mad scientist's beautiful daughters into femmes fatales to help them snag a good superhero (or villain) husband. While the viewpoint character _isn't_ this trope, many of the other students have diabolical masterminds as parents.
-   In _A Song of Ice and Fire_ King Aerys managed to beget a ridiculously good offspring (well, if you don't mind Viserys' mental health). Rhaegar was always in the collective imagination (don't mind Robert Baratheon) the Mad King's handsome and noble son, who'd have made a great king some day. Daenerys is also a bright young woman who before hitting 16 is already considered the World's Most Beautiful Woman and tries hard to not make the same mistakes her family did.

-   _The Starchild Trilogy_: In _The Reefs of Space_, Donna Creery is the daughter of the Planner of Earth, chief executive of the computer-controlled dictatorship which rules Earth, but she's sympathetic to Steve Ryeland, the scientist who's been arrested for reasons he doesn't understand. She eventually helps him escape when he ends up facing a death sentence.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The _Angel_ episode "Guise Will Be Guise", plays this straight - with MAGIC! In order to save Cordelia, Wesley is forced to impersonate Angel and ends up playing bodyguard to an evil Warlock's beautiful daughter. Hilarity ensues.
-   _The Comic Strip Presents_. Lampshaded in _Detectives on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown_ when the Genre Savvy Jason King\-expy asks the obligatory mad ex-colonel in a Big Fancy House if he has the obligatory nineteen-year old daughter in a miniskirt and too much makeup. He's disappointed to discover that she's living in Kenya with an African prince.
-   Lampshaded in _Danger: UXB_ when Lieutenant Ash delivers a defused bomb to Dr Gillespie and his daughter Susan, who are building a Heath Robinson Machine in their backyard for steaming explosives out of unexploded German bombs. Ash later reports to his superiors on the phone, deriding the device as completely impractical and describing Gillespie as the proverbial Mad Scientist who even has the requisite beautiful daughter — said daughter has of course just entered the room behind him.
-   Played straight in _Denji Sentai Megaranger_ in which Hinelar had a beautiful daughter named Shizuka. Shibolena is based off of her and was created to look like her.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   In "The Evil of the Daleks", Maxtible and Waterfield have one innocent, beautiful daughter each: Ruth and Victoria, respectively. Victoria even becomes a companion.
    -   In "The Web of Fear", Professor Travers has one, Anne Travers, who is also a Mad Scientist herself. She and Victoria appear to bond somewhat over the similarities between their fathers.
    -   Mad Scientist's Beautiful Granddaughter: Susan Foreman, the first Companion of William Hartnell's Doctor. While she is his granddaughter, they have this exact relationship, and she was obviously intended to fit this trope (until the series began to Growing the Beard and the Doctor became something much, much odder than simply the mad scientist he was conceived as).
    -   The Eighth Doctor Adventures kind of introduce Susan's mother, in the form of a young girl whom the Doctor adopts who seems to be Gallifreyan. She happens to be named Miranda and happens to have that beautiful-but-sheltered\-and-Oblivious to Love thing going on (at first), and the Doctor has a few scenes of doing sciencey laboratory stuff throughout the book.
-   _Fringe_: Male example: The series has a female lead and the son of a Mad Scientist who doesn't exactly approve of his father's activities. By the end of season 2 romance between Peter and Olivia is canon.
-   Her dad isn't really a Mad Scientist (he employs them instead), but Elle from _Heroes_ works too, down to flirting with the protagonist (Peter). Of course, she's pretty damn evil, and her way of flirting is to electrocute him a little bit each day to make him want it, but still....
-   Alex on _Lost_ fits this role, giving information learned from her adoptive father to the crash survivors. Different because it was, perhaps, simply a form of teenage rebellion against him, especially his treatment of her boyfriend.
-   Parodied in an episode of _The Monkees_ where they spend the night in a mad scientist's house. Micky opens a door and finds a woman standing there:
    
    **Micky:** Who are you?  
    **Woman:** I'm the doctor's beautiful daughter.  
    **Micky:** Well, what do you have to do with all this?  
    **Woman:** Nothing, I'm in the sequel.
    
-   Ziva David in _NCIS_ could be considered this, to a point. Her father could be viewed as a Well-Intentioned Extremist but he's more likely just a Jerkass. Gibbs himself points out to Ziva that her father, despite being the director of Mossad, is dirty and sometimes crosses the Moral Event Horizon into pure, selfish evil. Her response? Sometimes she's on his side, sometimes she's on Gibbs... and seems to have crossed permanently into Gibbs' camp by quitting Mossad and terminating all contact with dear old dad.
-   _Spooks_: Ros Myers isn't exactly sweet or innocent, but she _does_ prove to be the weak link in her father's Well-Intentioned Extremist conspiracy.
-   _Star Trek: The Original Series_:
    -   Inverted in "The Conscience of the King", as it is the daughter who is the mad one, trying to protect her accused father (he isn't squeaky clean either, though).
    -   Rayna, Flint's "ward" from "Requiem for Methuselah". He's neither evil nor mad; he just doesn't want his privacy to be disturbed (and for good reason).
-   And then there's Tora Ziyal from _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, the innocent daughter of Gul Dukat who always tried to give her father the benefit of the doubt. It didn't end well for her: she dies a pretty pointless death at the hands of Dukat's Dragon when even she was forced to accept that her father had run out of excuses for the way he behaved and the decisions he took. Always mentally unstable at best, her death was what snapped the last remaining thread of sanity Dukat had ever possessed.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_: In the episode "The Lateness of the Hour", Jana is the pretty daughter of inventor Dr. William Loren, who has created an entire menagerie of robot servants to assist him and his wife, so much so that Jana is worried her parents are becoming overly dependent on the robots. She yearns to see the world outside, but her father is overprotective and won't let her leave the house. Of course, in a true _Twilight Zone_\-style twist, Jana finds out that she is merely another robot creation of her father's, albeit the most humanistic one he has ever made.

    Music 

-   The Seanan McGuire song "Time Travel Girl" combines this with Daddy's Little Villain and Kid from the Future. The singer's daughter steals his time machine and travels back to make sure her parents have her.
    
    She's as pretty as a cyborg with its lasers set to kill,
    
    \[...\]
    
    And I'm fairly certain that she's daddy's little girl.
    
    I'll teach her how to write clean code,
    
    You'll show her how to make alfalfa explode,
    
    And we'll be oh-so-proud when she takes over the world!
    

    Myths & Religion 

-   From Classical Mythology: Medea of "Jason and the Golden Fleece" fame — she is the daughter of King Aeëtes who sets seemingly impossible tasks for The Hero Jason before he can have the fleece. Although Medea herself is evil and out to serve only her own interests; she eventually betrays Jason, too, although not before killing her own brother _and_ her own children. However, she only killed her children intentionally if you rely on the Euripides version of the myth. Earlier versions had it either being an accident, or murder by _other people_. She also only killed her brother to save Jason from her father. In fact, the only people she _didn't_ kill for Jason, according to the earlier myths, were the princess of Corinth, whom Jason abandoned her for, and the King of Corinth, who died trying to save his daughter. Even the version presented by Euripides assigns most of the actual blame for how things worked out to Jason's heroic flaw of ambition, and presents her desire to destroy the legacy that she'd lost everything to create for him (the fact that she did most of the work in her section of the Argonauts story is lampshaded thoroughly) is treated less as the sinister kind of evil and more the righteous rage of a betrayed demigod whose strained patience at being slowly discarded finally snapped.
-   Theseus and Ariadne of Crete. Ariadne betrayed her father and her people for Theseus. Theseus and Ariadne fall in love, but Theseus comes up with an interesting way to break it off — leaving Ariadne stranded on an island (Naxos) in the middle of nowhere because of a dream.
    
    Some myths explain that the dream was sent by a god (more exactly, Dionysius the god of wine, theater and fertility), and basically was a "Hands off my woman" message. It may have included a fairly detailed explanation of why one does not want to play the Romantic False Lead _to a god_. He picked her up after Theseus decided to wisely drop her off; one hopes he told her _why_ instead of just shoving her overboard at the suggested drop site and fleeing.
    
    Also, Theseus soon gets some Laser-Guided Karma for abandoning Ariadne like he did. He had promised to use white sails on his ship to let his beloved father Aegeus know he was alive... he forgot to change his black sails, Aegeus saw that and was Driven to Suicide. And not to mention what happened when he got involved with Ariadne's _sister_ Phaedria, too...
    
-   From Navajo tradition, there's the story of Deer Owner, a powerful sorcerer who hid away all the game animals so that none other than he could use them, and who had a beautiful daughter (who was also his wife and the source of his powers; Navajo sorcerers get Squicky). The hero of the story eventually meets and befriends the young woman, and she helps him in overcoming her father, freeing the game animals for use by anyone.

    Roleplay 

-   _The Mad Scientist Wars_:
    -   This is expanded in the ongoing _Narbonic_ roleplay, where Jane Narbon is the (incredibly beautiful) daughter of Helen Beta and Dave. In addition to being The Vamp, she's also (yup) Mad.
    -   Subverted in the forum roleplay. The concept is reimagined as the "Mad Scientist's Beautiful Daughter ploy", in which the daughter will _always_ pretend to help the hero escape, then drop him into some even nastier bit of trouble. Apparently, it's hard on the heroes and fun for the daughters.

    Theater 

-   Odile from _Swan Lake_. Daughter of the evil sorcerer, he sent her to seduce the hero.
-   Older Than Steam: Miranda, the daughter of the sorcerer Prospero in William Shakespeare's _The Tempest_. She fits the trope, except for the betrayal part. Prospero's actually for the match, he just wants to make sure Ferdinand's love-at-first-sight won't end up as out of sight, out of mind.
-   Though not quite a mad scientist, Caldwell B. Cladwell's daughter (appropriately named Hope) in _Urinetown_ certainly fits. It is often remarked upon how beautiful she is, she has no idea how cruel her father is, and, of course, falls in love with Bobby Strong. Also a good example of a Daddy's Girl.

    Video Games 

-   _Borderlands 2_ has Angel, the daughter of Handsome Jack who communicates to the player through their ECHO devices initially as part of Jack's scheme to take down Sanctuary but later to help the heroes take down her father (who keeps her around as more or less a supercomputer due to her Siren powers).
-   _Chrono Cross_: Kid is Schala's clone/reincarnation/something like that. She's also Lucca's foster daughter.
-   _Chrono Trigger_:
    -   Schala is a Magitek version of this. Her mother, Queen Zeal, ordered the creation of the Mammon Machine and Black Omen which exploits the power of Lavos which in turn is eating the planet from its core. She succeeds, and become an immortal at the cost of Schala and Janus.
    -   Lucca and her dad are a subversion in that both of them are fairly mad (10th century time machine!), but are otherwise decent people and are on your side.
-   Nina Cortex from _Crash of the Titans_, the young niece of longtime series Big Bad, Dr. Neo Cortex. More of a subversion, if anything; She's not exactly 'beautiful', and the reason for betraying Cortex was because she felt he wasn't being evil ENOUGH, and becomes the game's Big Bad. She's still a villain, if somewhat more minor, in her other appearances.
-   Oblio of video game Dance Central, is the son of the evil mad scientist Dr.Tan, but unlike his father, is beautiful.
-   Scarlet Nova is the daughter of the evil emperor of Gravora in the B-Movie inspired game _The Deadly Tower of Monsters._
-   _Devil May Cry_:
    -   Lady in _Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening_ is eventually revealed to be the daughter of Arkham. She chose to use the name Lady to distance herself from him.
    -   _Devil May Cry 5_ introduces Nico, Nero's partner in demon hunting, who is also the daughter of Agnus from _Devil May Cry 4_.
-   _Disgaea 2_ features Rozalin, the Evil Overlord Zenon's Beautiful but Spoiled Daughter who's contractually bound — much to her annoyance — to follow the ridiculously impulsive hero on his quest to kick her father's ass. While she starts out as outright murderous, things do start to change when she starts realizing that daddy doesn't seem to want her back safely so much as he wants her out of the way. Then again, he's not actually her father. Or the real Overlord Zenon, for that matter...
-   In the third installment of the _Dr. Brain_ series, "The Lost Mind of Dr. Brain", we are introduced to his assistant, his niece, Elaina, who provides the player with instructions on each mission, as well as hints, if the need arises.
-   _Fire Emblem_ has several:
    -   _Thracia 776_ has Sara, who is the adorable-looking granddaughter of the mad priest Manfloy.
    -   _Blazing Blade_ has _both_ the Handsome Son (though "younger" than most, in a sense) and the Beautiful Daughter. Ninian and Nils are the children of the Big Bad of the game, the Dark Druid Nergal.
        -   Not to mention another beautiful — okay, _cute_ — daughter in Sonia's (adopted) child, Nino. Sonia is actually one of Nergal's morphs.
    -   In _Fire Emblem: Awakening_, the _Player Character_ is the runaway son/daughter of the very weird-looking Dragon, Validar. Even when using the older builds for the character (especially the 'older male' one), s/he is always said to be good-looking by the other characters.
-   _Half-Life_:
    -   There's also Alyx Vance, daughter of relatively stable physicist and teleporter scientist Eli Vance. Given that he worked in the Lambda complex and was therefore at least partially responsible for the events which brought the Combine to earth, he probably counts as a little bit mad.
    -   Next to Doctor Magnusson, Eli is arguably the most sane among the Black Mesa survivors. Alyx's "uncle" and family-friend Isaac Kliener definitely fits the role of Mad Scientist, however; not only does he dabble in experimental and often dangerous technology (such as teleportation and patchwork rockets), he also keeps a defanged, flesh-eating alien parasite for a pet.
-   _Jade Empire_ has Silk Fox, the insane emperor's beautiful daughter.
-   Keira from _Jak and Daxter_ is the daughter of a mad green eco sage who serves as the main love interest, and serves as the resident Wrench Wench.
-   In _Mad Father_, Aya is one to Dr. Drevis. Of course, this makes her father more eager to make her into a doll, and she becomes a Mad Scientist like her father in the true ending.
-   _Mass Effect_:
    -   Liara is the daughter of Matriach Benezia, and it is possible to romance her whether your character is man or woman. Benezia's "madness" isn't her fault, though. It's somewhere between Brainwashed and More than Mind Control in her case.
    -   In _Mass Effect 2_, we discover Tali's father Rael, who performs some ethically questionable experiments on geth, even if he is not evil _per se_.
    -   Miranda Lawson is a subversion, since her father clearly _intended_ her to be this, having created her in a lab from his own DNA to create the _perfect_ daughter and secure his dynasty. Naturally, Miranda had _other_ ideas.
-   Played with in _Mega Man Legends_ which features sky pirate/mech-builder Tron Bonne, the beautiful _little sister_ of sky pirate/mech-builder Teisel Bonne.
-   _Mortal Kombat_ has plenty of this:
    -   Shang Tsung's creations include Mileena (who starts as a Stripperiffic Butter Face and later switches to Cute Monster Girl), Ermac (Whom are a collection of souls bound into a red ninja) and Skarlet (who is similar to Ermac, but with blood instead of souls) While both Mileena and Skarlet are achingly beautiful (for the most part), Shang Tsung himself bounces between playing straight and subverting this trope as well.
    -   Quan Chi plays this somewhat straight in _X_, where the Revenants that he makes are of the dead fighters from _Mortal Kombat 9_, all of which are better looking than he is.
-   In _Overlord_, either mistress you run into in the game turns out to be a daughter of the Big Bad (or rather, they are daughters of the wizard who became possessed by the Big Bad).
-   From _Pokémon Black and White_: N is a male example. He has a mad dictator for father, is beautiful, his views about the relations between Pokemon and Humans are certainly naive, he loves his father dearly, and is kept cloistered from the rest of the world, to the point where much of Ghetsis' plan revolved around the way this would warp his views. He sometimes has doubts about his methods and certainly starts to question himself after hearing the PC's Pokemon talk. He betrays his father after the latter has revealed himself as a monster.
-   _Resident Evil_ gave us Sherry Birkin. In her first appearance in _Resident Evil 2_, she's a middle schooler whose parents are both scientists developing exotic bioweapons for Umbrella Corp. Her father William decided to betray Umbrella out of greed and jealousy, feeling it would be better for he alone to profit from his life's work rather than his employer, starting a localized zombie apocalypse in the process and becoming a hideously mutated monster for his troubles. Sherry's mother isn't too far off in the moral spectrum, being dangerously amoral and coldhearted in pursuing her goals, though she at least recognizes the dangers of letting their work get out into the world unrestricted. Despite everything, Sherry survives the events of the game albeit as host to a symbiotic monster and would make a return 15 years later in _Resident Evil 6_.
-   _Sonic Frontiers_: Sage is an Artificial Family Member to Doctor Eggman. While Eggman is bald, fat, and has a frizzled moustache; Sage is a semi-Creepy Child who resembles a young girl. She's even referred to as "an adorable program" by Eggman himself, and while he's initially hesitant to treat her as more than a simple AI, in the end he accepts her as his daughter. The Stinger of the Golden Ending even has him rescue Sage in a backup program after the Heroic Sacrifice she initially did to defeat The End.
-   _Super Robot Wars_:
    -   Due to the traits of Lemon Browning, Lamia Loveless fits here, as she is the creation of Lemon that eventually got her own conscience and rebels against her creator. She's not the only daughter, however. Lemon also has another daughter and another son (though they did not directly rebel)
    -   A Mad Dictator's Handsome Son variation exists in _Super Robot Wars Destiny_, the male protagonist Joshua Radcliff. He did respect his father in a way, but in the same time, he dislikes his father for being too workaholic and bordering a Mad Scientist, because he experimented Rim mercilessly to further his research/job, uncaring that she develops a Split Personality afterwards. And guess what, said father got killed and absorbed into the Big Bad Perfectio and Joshua ends up killing his father to amend his wrongdoings.
    -   Lune Zoldark, daughter of the original Big Bad Mad Scientist Bian Zoldark, who eventually joins the good guys because she got a crush on one of the heroes, Masaki Andoh. Her defection from her father and falling in love are backwards, (she meets up with the good guys when she's coming back to fight her father, who she thinks has been corrupted by power, and _after_ they've already defeated him), but she's probably one of the best examples.
-   In _Tactics Ogre_, we have Mad Necromancer Nybeth, who loves experimenting with the dead. He has _three_ beautiful daughters, two of which rebel against him.

-   In _Trauma Team_, we have Rosalia Rossellini, Professor Sartre's adopted daughter.
-   _WarioWare_ has Penny Crygor, Mad Scientist's Beautiful _Grand_daughter. Of course, she's just as crazy and intelligent as her grandfather, and given the males of the series, is probably grateful for the lack of romance.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   Change 'Mad Scientist' to 'Amoral Attorney', and "daughter" to "adopted son", and you get Miles Edgeworth, especially if you take into consideration the strong emotional bond between him and Phoenix.
    -   Franziska von Karma is Manfred von Karma's _actual_ daughter, and while she's picked up on a few of her dad's bad habits, she has some moral fibre he himself lacked. In the third game she becomes an indispensable ally. Edgeworth needs to be a defense lawyer in Wright's place, but apparently he can't technically do that. After they make sure they get a judge who doesn't know Edgeworth, Franziska comes in to serve as prosecutor because she's the only one who won't rat him out.
    -   In _Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney_, take the Mad Artist's pretty daughter, Vera Misham.

    Web Animation 

-   _Dr. Havoc's Diary_: We have Ally Havoc, the daughter of the titular Dr. Darren Havoc.
-   _Red vs. Blue_: While downplayed in the "Mad Scientist" role, Season 10's Finale reveals that The Director, Dr. Leonard Church: who had created the Freelancer Program purely to find a way to bring back his dead wife through fragmenting the "Smart"-Class AI known as Alpha<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  is actually the father of the Freelancer Programs' top agent: Carolina.

    Webcomics 

-   The superhero Falchion from _Does Not Play Well With Others_ is dating the daughter of his arch-nemesis. Actually, she _is_ his arch-nemesis, who wears a suit of Powered Armor with a voice changer to make her look and sound male, and she exploited this trope for all it's worth to save her own ass when Falchion showed up at her evil lair unannounced while she wasn't wearing the suit. The fact that it also helped her get into his pants was a bonus.
-   Tabitha in _Far Out There_ is not only a looker, but followed her Daddy's footsteps into being a Mad Scientist herself.
-   _Girl Genius_: Given the backstory, "Mad Scientists rule the world. Badly", it's not surprising that there are a lot of these, played straight, inverted, bent, folded, spindled, or otherwise mutilated:
    -   Back Story\-only: Lucrezia Mongfish, daughter of evil Mad Scientist Lucifer Mongfish, and a Mad Scientist herself. She denounces her father's evil and marries The Hero Mad Scientist Bill Heterodyne. Since Bill, his brother Barry, and all of their True Companions are immortalized in the "Heterodyne stories," she is regarded as a Codifier for this trope in universe.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  She turns out to be more evil than her father, and is in fact the Big Bad. Her two sisters likely qualify for this as well.
    -   Agatha Heterodyne, Bill and Lucrezia's daughter, the protagonist. Also a Mad Scientist. Agatha's not really innocent, though, being trained as a spark herself. And both her birth and her real parents were firmly good-aligned, so she's not really rebelling. So she's more of a deconstruction of the trope.
    -   Gilgamesh Wulfenbach, Handsome Son of the Mad Scientist and Anti-Villain (not-so) Evil Overlord Klaus Wulfenbach. Also (say it with me) a Mad Scientist.
    -   Tarvek Sturmvoraus, Handsome Son of the current (now deceased)leader of a not-so-Ancient Conspiracy. Potential love interest and also (you knew this was coming) a Mad Scientist. He has a sister, who decidedly does not fit the trope.
    -   The whole thing gets sent up by Othar Tryggvassen, Gentleman Adventurer (and, of course, Mad Scientist): he meets Agatha while imprisoned aboard Klaus's flying airship castle, and assumes she must be his captor's previously-unknown beautiful daughter, there to either taunt him or set him free.
    -   Zola, Lucrezia's niece, is at least a mad scientist's beautiful granddaughter. Though unlike just about every other example in this work she doesn't show any sign of having inherited the Spark, and it is unknown if her mother Demonica (Lucrezia's sister) had it.
    -   If Word of God is to be trusted about Zeetha being Baron Wulfenbach's daughter and Gil's twin, then she is an Action Girl but, like Zola, is not actually a Mad Scientist herself.
    -   Colette, daughter of the Master of Paris, is so far the straightest yet iteration of this trope, being the beautiful daughter of a (take a shot) Mad Scientist, who helps out the heroes - but _not_ in defiance of her father, because the Master of Paris is on the good guys' side, just rather stern. Colette ends up ascending to the role of Master of Paris upon her father's death, while finally breaking through to become a Mad Scientist in her own right.
-   Michelle Flammel from _Monsterful_, her father Lionel Flammel is a handsome Mad Scientist/alchemist/magician known for his mad creations. Michelle loves her father dearly but she also thinks that he can be very stupid at times.
-   Helen Beta Narbon, the main character of _Narbonic_, who is actually a clone of her mother (and comes from a long line of clones) and a mad scientist herself.
    -   Possibly played straighter by her own daughter (with _another_ Mad Scientist), who's quite pretty.
-   Hannelore from _Questionable Content_. Raised on a space station by a Mad Scientist and a Corrupt Corporate Executive. She rebels, but doesn't betray either of them. Also, she was less "cloistered away" and more "neurotic to the point she wouldn't talk to anyone except the station's AI".
-   _Shortpacked!_:
    -   Her name is Conquest (Connie for short), and the phrase Really Gets Around hardly does her justice. She is known for giving out sex "free with purchase", any purchase, at her father Galasso's toy store. Nevertheless, he seems to be under the impression that she is a virgin, even though he has continually forced her to copulate with anyone he considers capable of producing a (male) heir for him. There's even mention of a time he witnessed a heroic horse, and tried to use her to breed centaurs. Despite having a head full of air and a high libido, she is surprisingly canny and eventually rebelled against her tyrannical father, and is now apparently one of his main business rivals. She's still a tramp, though, and considers a tryst with one of Galasso's more attractive male employees a suitable substitute for a briefcase full of cash as a bribe.
    -   She's also a direct parody of Talia Al-Ghul (see above). Galasso decided to name Ethan his successor, and gave him Conquest as part of the deal. He went for it at the time, but later discovered that he is gay and refused to go through with it any more. Galasso didn't even seem to understand the concept, and then ordered Robin to impregnate Connie instead. For the record, Robin is a girl. Yeah, the jury's still out on how someone like Galasso managed to acquire a daughter to begin with.
-   Oasis was one of these to Dr. Steve during her first appearance in _Sluggy Freelance_. Interestingly, Steve actually uses his mind control device to _make_ Oasis fall in love with Torg, much to Torg's displeasure.

    Web Original 

-   An unofficial _Champions_ character named The Scientist has a young, beautiful, virgin daughter. And he always calls her that, much to her chagrin, until her kidnappers (the evil M.A.C.R.O.N.) return her and say "Here you are, your young, beautiful ... daughter." ("It was my idea, daddy. Have you _seen_ what this hunk looks like under his armor?!")
-   Mentioned in _Evil Overlord Tip #105_, if you ever have to hire an evil mad scientist to design your doomsday weapon, make sure they don't have one of these.
-   _Gaia Online_'s Gino Gambino might be a dude, but he otherwise fits this trope.
-   In _Interviewing Trey_, the beautiful (to the point of actual paranormal charisma) Beguile is the daughter of the mad scientist Doctor Guile.
-   Jadis Diabolik of the _Whateley Universe_, in her first (chronological) appearance, even references this trope. It's one of her hot buttons that she's the daughter of the infamous mass murderer Dr. Diabolik, and she has the Exemplar superpower, but she's isn't actually beautiful - she's plain, and elsewhere would be considered moderately attractive, but compared to all the other Exemplars running around, she feels incredibly ugly (plus, it hasn't been stated for certain that she is an Exemplar or if something her father did just mimics the effects). She is particularly sensitive about not having the Most Common Superpower, which is almost universal in female Exemplars (at lest those who don't get a Body Horror result instead). Despite this, she did have a guy vying for her attention after she saved him from a smalltime super villain thug, and two others at Whateley (though one's a creep who imagines himself to a Batman-esque Byronic Hero, and the other just wants favours from her father and the parents of the other Bad Seeds).

    Western Animation 

-   _The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius_: Jimmy Neutron's nemesis, Professor Calamitous, has a daughter who's actually named "Beautiful Gorgeous". Contrary to the trope, she's possibly more evil than her father, and almost certainly more effective at it.
-   Farmer Brown from the _Batman: The Animated Series_ episode "Critters" can count as a Mad Scientist, seeing as he's using microbiology to create monstrous farm animals, and he does indeed have a beautiful daughter named Emmylou. She's also his enforcer and is _much_ stronger than her almost petite frame would appear, being more than a match for Batgirl. (She claims that it's due to beef steroids, clearly another of her dad's experiments.)
-   _Ben 10_ invokes this with Attea, daughter of Emperor Milleous. Her father has her carefully watched, but she manages to betray him, fall for the hero (when he's the same species), and take over daddy's empire over the course of a two-parter.
-   Bonnie Lepton in the _Buzz Lightyear of Star Command_ episode "Eye of the Tempest", the All Grown Up daughter of a former Star Command scientist who became mad after experimenting on himself.
-   Subverted in _Captain Planet and the Planeteers_, as the mad scientist Dr. Blight was an attractive woman, and as a result her beautiful daughter Betsi looks exactly like her.
-   Aelita from _Code Lyoko_, though her father's sanity is more questionable than definitely not present.
-   In _Danny Phantom_, Jazz definitely takes after her mother. Even when she won't admit it _and_ when Jack Fenton is more bumbling than mad.
-   Inverted on _Gargoyles_: Halcyon Renard, while cynical and not without his flaws, is a strongly principled scientist. His beautiful daughter, Fox, is an amoral mercenary who even marries his equally amoral business rival.
-   The second season of _Jonny Quest: The Real Adventures_ not only brought back the Quests' arch-nemesis Dr. Zin, it also gave him two daughters, Anaya and Melana, one whom becomes romantically involved with Hadji.
-   _The Legend of Korra_:
    -   Asami Sato is a case where she didn't _know_ she was the daughter of a mad scientist who hid behind the image of a successful business owner that secretly supplies weapons and Mini-Mecha to the Equalists. Even if her father had a strong Freudian Excuse for doing so, she is not happy to discover this.
    -   The leader of the Equalists, Amon/Noatak, is the Tall, Dark, and Handsome son of a Bloodbending mobster would-be mad dictator Yakone. The same goes for his younger brother, Tarrlok.
-   Julie Kane in _Motorcity_. Abraham Kane's technically not a mad scientist, but she still fits the trope. She also kept it a secret, fearing her friends will think she's just like him.
-   _My Life as a Teenage Robot_:
    -   Melody is a mad scientist's beautiful _robot_ "daughter"... unbeknownst to her love interest Brad as he struggles to escape from her father's captivity.
    -   Jenny herself, though it was her _mother_ who made her. At first, she was only allowed out to save the world.
-   _Phineas and Ferb_:
    -   Vanessa Doofenshmirtz (pictured) plays with this trope in different ways. In early episodes she was outright disdainful towards her father and his experiments, generally playing the role of Deadpan Snarker. She warmed up to him in later episodes, though she remains somewhat annoyed by his exploits and his attempts to make her into a Daddy's Little Villain (though some of her actions hint she may head down that path anyway). She's also notably uncloistered (she only spends alternate weekends with her father anyway) and keeps her relationship with his nemesis friendly but strictly platonic.
    -   Played straighter in later episodes, when she develops an interest in Major Monogram's son, (human) secret agent Monty Monogram. Not only does she never truly become evil, but she also joins the heroes and ultimately convinces her father to give up evil as well.
-   In _Rick and Morty_, Beth Smith (the daughter of Rick and mother of Morty) is older than the typical example, but still qualifies. Much like Rick, she's smart, selfish, and an alcoholic, albeit to a lesser extent. She slips into the typical Daddy's Girl, often giving Rick the benefit of the doubt and putting him ahead of other family members but isn't above calling him out when his antics are particularly egregious.
-   In _Skysurfer Strike Force_, Cerina is the daughter to show Big Bad, Cybron. Unlike most of the examples though, she's clearly evil.
-   Subverted in _Spy Groove_ with Sierra Nevada, the daughter of a mad robotics genius/casino owner. Turned out _she_ was the mad genius; daddy was just a robot she built to draw attention away from her while she played this trope to the hilt to fool do-gooders.
-   Kitten from _Teen Titans (2003)_ may not even truly have been human, seeing as her father was Killer Moth, and her beauty was clearly only skin deep, but given the nature of Killer Moth's schemes, she technically qualifies.

-   _Transformers: Animated_: Isaac Sumdac is a pudgy, elderly roboticist with beady, sunken eyes. Meanwhile, his daughter Sari is an adorable little girl with big eyes. Aside from sharing his skin tone, she looks absolutely nothing like him. One could justify it by saying their lack of resemblance is because Sari isn't human, but it is confirmed within the show that she shares his DNA.
-   Though not necessarily a bad guy, Dr. Orpheus from _The Venture Bros._ is a mad scientist/necromancer with a relatively normal teenage daughter, Triana, whom he loves and cares for, humorously mixing his medieval, renaissance faire-like attitude with the trials of a modern-day single dad.
-   Though a departure from her portrayal in the comics, Lorna Dane a.k.a. Polaris is made into something of a Mad Scientist's beautiful daughter in _Wolverine and the X-Men (2009)_. She, unlike her siblings, is intentionally kept innocent and naive of the reality of the society her father (Magneto) created on Genosha. And in one episode she falls for Gambit who, while his status as a hero may be suspect, is the enemy of her father (in that he plans to steal from him).

    Real Life 

-   Catherine Barton was the _niece_ of Isaac Newton (he never married and had no children), but she did live in his house in London. She was renowned for her beauty and wit. Newton himself was an Alchemist and heavily into the occult and weird.
-   This one is debatable, as, at worst, Max Born - by his own admission - was more "amiably weird" than "Mad". But he could be very forgetful, and absolutely _hated_ to work without a collaborator. He was also a fairly good looking, if a touch square jawed chap. But if we said that his _granddaughter_ was Olivia Newton-John, then you know why he's here. His two daughters, Irene (Olivia's mother) and Gritli were also said to be beautiful and talented.
