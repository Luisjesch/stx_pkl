Nothing like a cute child to make a Happy Ending even happier.

_"A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world."_

Sometimes you have a Happily Ever After situation, but it just isn't heartwarming enough. Maybe the marriage happened earlier in the season; perhaps the couple was already betrothed but weren't able to consummate the union. Perhaps you need some Dénouement to confirm that, yes, really, it really was happy. Maybe the Bittersweet Ending is short on "sweet". Or, maybe, you just want to make things as adorable as possible. The answer? Skip ahead a bit to show the Happily Married couple...and their adorable new baby. Awwwww!

Or, if we cut to the future, show them at home with their growing children. Generally a whole brood, as a mundane equivalent to Fertile Feet, or demonstrating that Mordor has No Ontological Inertia. The older the children, obviously the more years have passed in peace, proving more of the "Ever After" part of the happy ending. Grow Old with Me in an epilogue may feature grandchildren, or even great-grandchildren. (See also Hope Sprouts Eternal.) If the ending is not Cleaning Up Romantic Loose Ends, unmatched friends often appear in the role of Honorary Uncle; conversely, Weddings for Everyone may result in loads of underfoot children. And expect the newborns to be named after dead friends or teammates who had made Heroic Sacrifices during the course of the story, clearing the path for the heroes' victory at the cost of their own lives.

It seems that the Law of Inverse Fertility gets inverted once you get past the climax. Even if one or both were confirmed as sterile — such is The Power of Love. The likelihood of this increases exponentially every time one or both people say they don't want to have a kid, or express reluctance to. (Makes many parents very happy.)

The Bittersweet Ending often shows a Dead Guy Junior in this situation. Her Heart Will Go On may entail the discovery that she is pregnant after the father is dead: he's gone, but he's left her Someone to Remember Him By.

If the couple had a child early in the story, perhaps resulting in a Shotgun Wedding, this may result in a younger brother or sister.

Might involve a Screaming Birth, but this is, of course, optional; the baby itself is what makes this trope run, so the cuter the better.

Sequels to works with these sort of endings often make the kids into major characters.

The rationale for this trope is related to Babies Make Everything Better. Compare Birth-Death Juxtaposition. Not to be confused with Wave of Babies.

**Naturally, this is an Ending Trope, so unmarked spoilers ahoy!**

    Advertising 

-   A Papa Murphy's commercial for heart-shaped "Heartbaker" pizza (seen here) shows a husband and wife dancing, with a closeup of his face and a closeup of her face. The narrator says, "Remember when you were just dating, and Valentine's Day was all about romance and flowers and fancy dinners out? That was just practice for the really good stuff." The view pulls back to show that the husband is dancing with his daughter and the mom is dancing with her son.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Akame ga Kill!_ ends with Mine, who awakens from her coma, and Tatsumi starting a family together since Mine got pregnant with Tatsumi's child before he got transformed into a dragon. It's a nice subversion of the anime's Adaptational Alternate Ending where they died.
-   In _Amagami SS_, the epilogue to Tsukasa's arc. Her Good End in the Visual Novel is what the epilogue was adapted from.
-   In the ending of the manga _Aragami Hime_, Shirou and Kazuki have a son and a daughter.
-   The Ending of _Bannertail: The Adventure of Gray Squirrel_, wherein Banner and Sue have lots of adorable squirrel babies in the final episode.
-   _Berserk_:
    -   Griffith, during his Despair Event Horizon, has a vision of he and Casca sharing a quiet life as a couple with a child that is presumably his. There are several speculations as to the nature of this scene, whether it's a hallucination depicting Griffith's possible unrequited feelings for Casca and living a simple life with her, or if it is a hallucination of the sort of life that Griffith _doesn't_ want, since his grander dream of becoming king of his own empire is seemingly at its end and he never wanted to settle for a "normal" life to begin with. Also, some fans go so far as to speculate that the scene is a What Could Have Been\-esque vision of Griffith's life after Guts' second impending departure from the Hawks which would heavily imply that the child that Griffith and Casca are raising is Casca's son by Guts, not Griffith's. Needless to say, this vision is not followed by anything happy, especially since it was induced after Griffith witnessed Guts and Casca expressing their feelings for one another.
    -   Furthermore, in the manga continuity, this trope is cruelly subverted in the case of Guts and Casca, as Casca was indeed pregnant with Guts' child at the time, but after Griffith crosses the Moral Event Horizon, absolutely nothing ends well for Casca, Guts, or their unborn child.
-   In _Black God_, Keita and Akane had 2 grandchildren, with Keita dying of old age. In the manga version, it only shows Keita and Akane having a son.
-   _Bleach_: The epilogue is set ten years into the future and reveals the fates of the characters. Renji and Rukia are together and have a daughter called Ichika while Ichigo and Orihime have a son the same age as Ichika, whose name is Kazui. The epilogue shows Ichika and Kazui meeting for the first time and trying to upstage each other when announcing to each other that they are both Shinigami.
-   The last three pages of _Boys Empire_ are a cavalcade of babies, the paternity of some of which is unclear. The mothers kind of got around. Hitomi's baby is obviously Makoto's.
-   _Ceres, Celestial Legend_: Subverted, where Aya learns about being pregnant in volume 12 and is in her last month of pregnancy at the end of the series.
    -   A side-story in another one of Yuu Watase's works showed on the last page, that Aya gave birth to a daughter. And Toya, who had stated that due to having given up the Mana that he was made of he was slowly dying and might have a year or few more left, is still alive. Retains a bittersweet note as Toya is _still_ slowly dying.
-   In _Change 123_, the final chapter shows Kosukegawa and Motoko as adults with three daughters, each of them looking very similar to one of Motoko's three personalities that she fused with at the end of the series.
-   Implied in the manga epilogue of _Chrono Crusade_. Azmaria has a grandchild shown in the Distant Finale, and considering his resemblance to Joshua and the fact that they're shown with their hands clasped with a ring on Az's finger, they likely married and had at least one child together.
-   The Epilogue of _Code Geass R2_ shows Kaname Ohgi as Prime Minister of Japan, with his wife Viletta (who is visibly pregnant) watching him on TV...from Tamaki's bar.
-   The last chapter of _Digimon Adventure 02_. It shows a few couples (Yamato and Sora and Ken and Miyako) that got together and ones that didn't, much to the disappointment of some fans, but every single grown up main character, even those whose spouses (if they have one) aren't shown, has at least one child.
-   _Doctor Slump_: In one chapter of the original series, Obotchaman travels to the future with a time machine and discovers that he and Arale will be married with a baby robot built by Dr. Senbei (both Obotchaman and Arale are Ridiculously Human Robots). In the final episode of the remake there is the same scene (with their baby ten years in the future), except that the moment is shown in the epilogue rather than as a result of time travel. Also, the same episode ends with the birth of Turbo, Senbei and Midori's son, and the epilogue shows they will have other children.
-   At the end of _Dragon Ball Z_ there are Gohan and Videl with their daughter Pan, and Bulma and Vegeta with their second child, Bra/Bulla.
    -   During the last arc, Krillin and 18 have a daughter named Marron, showing they got a happy ending. Initially there's not much to her, but the latest series is moving her away from this a little.
    -   And in one Non-Serial Movie, it shows that Goku and Vegeta's lines are still around (and completely identical to their ancestors some seven generations later.
-   _The Electric Tale of Pikachu_, a manga adaption of Ash's Kanto journey, shows James and Jessie engaged and Jessie _pregnant_ at the end.
-   In the manga ending of _Elfen Lied_, Kouta and Yuka had a daughter named Nyu.
-   _Emma: A Victorian Romance_: After going through so much due to their different social class and status, Emma and William are eventually married and have four children.
-   _From the New World_ ends with Saki pregnant with Satoru's child, both now Happily Married.
-   The end of _Fruits Basket_ has Tohru and Kyo's granddaughter looking for them in all their senior lovey-dovey glory. The sequel series _Fruits Basket Another_ further confirms that they had three children.
-   The ending of _Fullmetal Alchemist_ shows both Winry and Ed holding their children.
-   _Fushigi Yuugi_. Awwwww, Boushin, Emperor Hotohori's cuuute son. In the final saga, Miaka gives birth to a baby girl whom she named Hikari Sukunami.
-   In the finale of Future Boy Conan we see that several members of the Barracuda crew have gotten married at High Harbor and had some babies, and Jimmy’s pet pig Tasty has grown up and had a litter of piglets.
-   Among the ending scenes in _Future Diary_ is one with World 2 Minene living a peaceful life with World 3 Nishijima, and having two young children. Two young _floating_ children, as they seem to have inherited some of her god-powers.
-   In the Distant Finale of _Gaiking: Legend of Daiku Maryu_, Shizuka is, as always, pulling the massive lever that powers on the firing mechanism of the Daiku Maryu's head, but this time she's doing it while breastfeeding a little baby. Given that Sakon is also carrying a baby on his back, the two hooked up in the end, surprising precisely nobody.
-   The final chapter of _GE - Good Ending_, true to the manga's namesake, Utsumi and Yuki had a baby boy.
-   In _Gundam Build Fighters_, Reiji and Aila's daughter is the cause of the Island Wars OVA events.
-   _Haibane Renmei_ ends with twin Haibane cocoons starting to sprout. Haibane are born as children so they're not actual babies, however the effect is the same. This happens not soon after Reki takes her Day of Flight.
-   In the final chapter of _Hana to Akuma_, Vivi and Hana have a son and a daughter.
-   In the _Harukanaru Toki no Naka de - Hachiyou Shou_ TV series, towards the end Inori's sister Seri is all but outright stated to be pregnant with Iktidaru's child; the series' epilogue (before it goes for the Multiple Endings) shows Sefuru holding their baby.
-   In an interesting variation of the trope, _HeartCatch Pretty Cure!_'s finale shows that Tsubomi's mother (who had been previously established to be pregnant in episode 43) has given birth to her second child, a baby girl named Futaba, who Tsubomi and Erika are shown interacting with before walking off to school.
-   After the variant in _HeartCatch_, _HuGtto! Pretty Cure_ plays the trope straight, as in the 12-year Time Skip, Hana/Cure Yell gives birth to a baby girl, making her the first Cure to become a mother. This baby girl also happens to be the true form of Hugtan, the mascot of the series, and Hana's successor as Cure Tomorrow.
-   _Hyper Police_ has an example that can only be called extravagant. In the Distant Finale set 3 years after the last manga chapter, Tomy and Po have gotten married and had _nineteen_ kids. Tomy is a dog-boy, so they had litters.
-   _I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying_ ends with Kaoru giving birth to her daughter Sayoko. The first season of anime ends a little bit earlier, with her getting an Unexpected Positive (season 2 is in Anachronic Order and the only ones that take place after this point revolve around her and Hajime dealing with the fact that they're going to be parents).
    -   Spin-Off series _My Girlfriend Without Wasabi_ ends with Kaoru's friend Rino giving birth to triplets. Said triplets are the reincarnations of the supporting cast.

-   Near the end of _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_, Kashiwagi turns out to be pregnant with Tsubasa's baby (with a Flash Forward chapter revealing that they name the kid after Kashiwagi's best friend Maki). A bit of post-series artwork depicting the cast as adults also shows that they have at least one more kid as Kashiwagi is visibly pregnant again.
-   In the final manga chapter of _Kanojo ni Naru Hi_, Miyoshi & the gender-bent Mamiya had a daughter named Nene.
-   In the manga ending of _Karin_, Karin Maaka and Kenta Usui have a daughter named Kanon, who is actually the reincarnation of Sophia Pistis. Which makes it a tad awkward, because she ends up loving her father a little bit TOO much..._and_ her mother too, since Kanon tries to glomp and kiss her as well.
-   The final chapter of _Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple_ shows a picture of Kenichi and Miu's daughter.

-   In _Kurogane Communication_, Haruka and Kitano return to Earth with their daughter — who looks a lot like Haruka herself.
-   The last time we see Amy on-screen (not counting the movies) is in _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's_. _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_ reveals that she married Chrono and gave birth to fraternal twins during the Time Skip (though dialogue implies that it wasn't necessarily in that order).
-   _Maid-Sama!_: a bonus chapter set after the epilogue reveals that Usui and Misaki have a boy and a girl. In addition, Suzuna is also revealed to be pregnant with Hinata's child, Sakura is pregnant with hers and Kuuga's second child, and Igarashi has a son.

    -   The last page of the last chapter features a newborn baby. She's Haruka Godai, the daughter of Yusaku and Kyouko.
    -   Also towards the end, Mitaka and his heavily pregnant wife Asuna are about to play this troupe straight.
-   Toyed with in _Michiko & Hatchin_. The last few minutes show a grown-up Hatchin living modestly but well with her baby son. However, the baby's father left her after only three months, so it's not exactly a perfectly happy outcome.

There's also a chapter dedicated to her friend, Juri, a centaur, who confesses her to her childhood friend "Donkio" who reciprocates her feelings, and at the end of the girls' respective stories, they experience Their First Time with their respective boyfriends. The final chapter of the manga _Otherworldly Maidens: Monster Girls from Another World_, revolves around knight and a dragon getting sent to the modern world where humans and "monsters" live side by side, and where Setsuka and her and Eiji's son as well as Juri, Donkio and their daughter make a cameo apearance.
-   _Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water_. The title character (Nadia, married to Jean), the narrator (Samson of the Terrible Trio, married to a much younger lady, the now grown-up Marie), and the most "complex" character (Electra). Hanson, the other half of the team, has kids but we don't see them (or his wife for that matter). Grandis (the boss of the trio), notably is still single, and loving it.
-   Done in the epilogue of _Naruto_. 15 years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, we see Naruto and Hinata's son and daughter, Sasuke and Sakura's daughter, Sai and Ino's son, Shikamaru and Temari's son, and Chouji and Karui's daughter. Rock Lee is shown with his son. Asuma and Kurenai's grown-up daughter makes an appearance. Even Akamaru has several descendants.
-   _Negima!_:
    -   Both Narutaki twins in the final manga chapter of _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ gave birth to their respective daughters whom are a splitting image of their younger selves.

-   In _One Piece_. Baroque Works agents Mr. 9 and Miss Monday got married and have a kid after two-year timeskip.
-   In the manga _Ore-Tachi No Party Wa Machigatteiru_, Chroma was cursed by the demon king to turn into a woman. In the end, she and the monk had a daughter in the final chapter. It's revealed that Chroma being pregnant causes her genderbend curse to remain unbroken when the demon king dies.
-   Parodied in _Osananajimi wa Onnanoko ni Naare_: The series proper has an open-ended finale, then the last volume has a two-page episode. It shows an older Shiori explaining to her son how she became a women permanently in college after falling in love and marrying Shuichi. This inspires her son to say he wants to grow up to be a girl like his mother did. Then the very last panel shows this was all Sylphie's idea of "the kind of ending we should all strive for". Shuichi was amused, but Shiori and Miyu weren't.
-   _Ouran High School Host Club_: The author's post-series notes reveal that Haruhi and Tamaki have a child shortly after marriage. They are the first of the Host Club members to do so. Hikaru and Kaoru, on the other hand, get a _Sister_ Ever After; their mother gives birth to a girl named Ageha.
-   _Outlanders_ ends with Tetsuya and Kahm having _quintuplets_.
-   Played for drama in _Penguindrum_. Ringo Oginome believes that carrying and giving birth to Tabuki-sensei's child will be the corollary to her dreams of getting her broken family back together; however, the _lengths_ she will reach to be impregnated by him are NOT portrayed as okay, but as a sign of how unstable and desperate the girl is.
-   _Phantom Thief Jeanne_, manga. To make it even _happier_ ever after, the babies in question are the reincarnations of the angels Access Time and Fin Fish, reborn as Shinji and Natsuki. To avoid incest (the two were a couple), Shinji is the son of Miyako, not Marron and Chiaki.
-   _Planetes_ ends with some baby clothes being hung on a clothesline....
-   Professor Burnet is shown slightly pregnant in the final seconds of _Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon_. After she and Kukui took in Ash for so long, it makes sense that they'd be ready for a kid of their own. The child would be born during _Pokémon Journeys: The Series_; a baby boy named Lei.
-   The kitty variation shows up in _Princess Tutu_. The tomcat teacher who is so desperate to marry is shown as a normal cat now, walking with a white cat and a line of kittens following them.
-   _RahXephon_: in the new reality resulting from the world's retuning, Ayato and Haruka are Happily Married, with Quon reincarnated as their baby daughter.
-   _Rave Master_ has an interesting twist on this. A recurring omake deals with the wacky misadventures of a boy named Levin. About halfway through the main series, it is revealed that the omake took place in the future of the main story and that Levin is the future son of Haru and Elie.
-   Nakaba was shown pregnant in the ending of _Dawn of the Arcana_ in the final chapter when she and Caesar were together.

-   In the end of _Sand Chronicles_'s last chapter (of the main story) in Volume 8, Daigo and Ann are shown with their baby boy.
-   _Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei_'s ending shows that Nozomu has married all his love interests (Kinda. It's complicated.) and all of them except the Gay Option have produced children with him. Children that look _eerily_ like Kafuka.
-   In _School Rumble Z_, the very last chapter showed a flash-foward of the future where Harima visits Karasuma's hospital room with Eri who is holding a baby.
-   Kouki and Ayumi have 2 daughters, who are the reincarnations of Jindou and Tenshi in _Sekai ka Kanojo ka Erabenai_.
-   In the last page of the final chapter 49 of _Sekainohate de Aimashou_, its revealed that the heroine Yona Ryouma gave birth to Emillio's son, pretty firmly showing Ryouma would decide to remain female for the rest of her life.
-   _Sekirei_: Seo has four sons (two sets of twins) with Hibiki and Hikari a year after the series ends, all who have the mother's electric powers.
-   _The Seven Deadly Sins_ ends with the three main couples (Meliodas and Elizabeth, Ban and Elaine, King and Diane) all having at least one child. Following the Theme Naming the series takes from the Arthurian Legend, Meliodas' son is Tristan and Ban's son is Lancelot.
-   In the epilogue of _Shaman King_ manga, Yoh and Anna have a son named Hana. Same goes for Tao Ren, who had a son named Tao Men. The mother was implied to be Iron Maiden Jeanne. Hana was conceived because during the series, it was a real possibility that Yoh could die, so the couple decided to have Their First Time.
-   Both the webcomic and manga of _Shishunki Bitter Change_ ends with Yuuta, in Yui's body, becoming a mother, having a son in the webcomic's depressing ending and having a daughter and son in the manga's ending. While the identity of the father remains a mystery in the webcomic, it's obvious that the father in the manga is Yui in Yuuta's body.
-   Morinas and Wapourif have a big family in the Distant Finale of _Simoun_. Wauf and his Ascended Extra wife have a new baby, too. And Paraietta manages a whole orphanage full of kids, with Rodoreamon's financial backing.
-   The Grand Finale of _Soul Eater_ reveals that Stein and Marie are an Official Couple and Marie is pregnant. Though Stein not surprisingly sees this as the start of a Guinea Pig Family.
-   At the end of _Suzuka_, the main couple has a baby. Although it raise a big fuss in their family; at least, it's settled down at the last chapter.
-   In _Tenchi Muyo!_, because it's All There in the Manual, Tenchi will wind up having multiple children by multiple girls of his harem. The fifth OVA ends with Ryoko and Aeka each having a baby daughter with Tenchi and Ryo-ohki being pregnant with triplets.
-   In _The Tibetan Dog_, the titular Heroic Dog dies at the end, but his legacy lives on with his revealed offspring.

-   _UFO Baby_ ends with an episode showing Miyu and Kanata, the protagonists, Happily Married and with a cute little baby of their own (only a normal human one, though).
-   Used at the end of _Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust_. Earlier in the film, D and Leila discuss their fears of Dying Alone, and agree to visit each other's graves. Sixty years later, D arrives at Leila's grave, and her granddaughter runs up to him. He looks up, and her grave is surrounded by people - she didn't die alone after all, but with her family by her side.
-   _Vampire Knight_:
    -   A more trolling version. After a thousand years have passed in the last chapter, Yuuki is seen with two children: it's left ambiguous whether both of them are Zero's, or one is Kaname's. With the release of a bonus chapter however, the girl is confirmed to be Kaname's.
    -   The ending also shows us Yori's grandchildren, who's grandfather is revealed to be Aidou.
-   In the finale of _Violinist of Hameln_, 10 years after the final battle, Flute and Hamel are revealed to have _9 kids_! Since they all seem to be pretty close in age to each other, it means Flute had to be pregnant non-stop or often gave birth to twins or triplets. Her magical royal blood must have contributed a lot for her to be that healthy and youthful even after all that.
    -   In the same chapter, Sizer finally gave birth to her and Raiel's daughter Ocarina after 10 years of trying. It took them that long not because they themselves had trouble conceiving but because Raiel kept dying from blood loss even before the baby-making act happened.
-   The last chapter of _Wolf Girl and Black Prince_ is set years into Erika and Kyoya's marriage. It shows them living with their daughter, Yuina.

-   At the end of _Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL_, we see both Orbital 7 and Lillybot with Kaito...as well as two smaller, Orbital 7/Lillybot hybrid robots between them. The implication is that they are their children, despite them being robots who have to be built.

    Comic Books

It's also a Birth-Death Juxtaposition, since the main theme of the issue deals with the death of a member of the Liberty League.
    -   Another series came out later, but still ultimately plays into the trope, as it is about their pregnancy, and ends with the birth of their son. It also uses time travel to double up on which parts of the trope it fulfills, having one of the heroes who has been covering for Mark while Abby is in labor turn out to be their son from the future in disguise.
-   _Marvel Universe_ _What If?_:
    -   Sue Storm married Namor and half-way through the story was pregnant. At the end, Reed Richards married another woman — a female Latverian spy who had been forced into that role.

-   Exaggerated in a _Code Geass_ Alternate Universe Fic in which the Euphinator incident never happened, resulting in Lelouch not instituting the Zero Requiem and just ending the conflict after becoming Emperor, and as such, everybody lives. The fic opens years later, with Suzaku and Euphemia having married and had _nine_ children together, and Euphemia is pregnant again. Suzaku is rather shocked that Euphie is so fertile, meaning they didn't even plan this! The name of the fic? _Fertility_, appropriately enough.

-   _DC Nation_ has several child characters — both canon (Ceridian, Lian Harper, Offspring) and Original Characters (Sandra Grayson, Luumand'r, Allanah Dibny).

-   Subverted in _Fullmetal Alchemist: Forever_.

It's sequel _Uplifted Intervention_ makes this more clear during the first interlude, showing that Hoch and Hanala with a large and extensive family coming together to celebrate the turn of the new Millennium in 1999.

    -   _The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars_, set just after _To the Rescue_, introduces Rob as a father of a newborn son Robbie.
-   _Chicken Run_ ends with a scene of the chickens in their new home, accompanied by dozens of chicks. Slight subversion as we don't know who the chicks' parents are, they're just chicks, and it's a pretty large colony of birds (though with only two males...)

-   _Lady and the Tramp_ ends with Lady's and the Tramp's litter of puppies. The puppy who takes after his dad - Scamp - was the main character in a series of comics, and later an animated sequel.
-   The ending of _The Lion King (1994)_, with Simba and Nala's cute little cub. In a series of licensed books made not soon after the film came out, the cub is a male named Kopa.

There is much debate on whether they are Jack and Sally's kids and how they could have them, since, you know, one's dead and the other's a rag doll.
-   _Norm of the North_ ends with Norm and Elizabeth having three cubs together.
-   While not explicitly stated, it's an easy assumption to make in the ending of _The Pebble and the Penguin_. Hubie and Marina are shown standing in a group of eight baby penguins. It's unclear whether it's meant to be inferred that all of the offspring are theirs; real Adélie penguins bear only one egg at a time.
-   In _Rio_, Blu and Jewel are seen with three chicks during the end credits. After all, that was the point of them getting together.
-   Discussed in _Robin Hood (1973)_ where Robin proposes to Marian.

    -   And after they get married, Skippy tags along, saying, "Robin Hood's going to have kids. _Somebody_ has to keep their eye on things."

-   _Rover Dangerfield_ ends with Rover discovering that he's a father of six little puppies with Daisy.
-   _Shrek_:
    -   We're shown Donkey is having a healthy and stable relationship with his dragon girlfriend at the end of the second film, as indicated by the appearance of their many donkey-dragon hybrid kids. Donkey is a very involved and devoted father.

-   Pixar's _Up_ ends with many still photos, including one of Dug and another female dog (that looks a lot like him) having many puppies.

    **Ray:** Uh, the next word may be your last, kid.

-   In _Dogma_, the Last Scion becomes the Next to Last Scion after God makes her pregnant in return for successfully saving the world.
-   A funny spin on this in Charlie Chaplin's _A Dog's Life_. Scrappy the wonder pup plays a key role in hooking his master, The Tramp, up with a beautiful nightclub singer.

-   _George of the Jungle_ ends with first a scene of George and Ursula's baby showing he's inherited his dad's clumsiness by walking into a low hanging bar, and then proceeds to parody _The Lion King_.
-   Jerri and Tom in _The Girl Can't Help It_ have five kids.

-   At the end of _The Happening_, the female lead discovers she's pregnant.
-   Subverted in _Hawksong_. The author, Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, originally intended to end with Danica singing to her baby, but then she (the author) realized that she could not just end it that way because there were still too many consequences and ramifications from actions taken in the first book that needed closure. The next book in the series deals with the consequences of the pregnancy. The book went from a single novel, to a trilogy, to a five-part series called the Kiesha'ra.
-   _Headhunters_: The final scene emphasizes Diana's pregnancy as a symbol of their happy relationship.
-   _Hellboy II: The Golden Army_ ends with the title character and Liz looking forward to becoming parents. We never actually see the babies, though.

Señor Del Toro has always said that he has three _Hellboy_ movies in mind, so we may see them eventually.
-   The 1987 movie _Hello Again_ ends with a photo album showing the main character marrying her love interest, her sister marrying her love interest, and then the main character's son and wife with a baby, the sister and love interest with a baby, and the main character and her new husband with twins.

This is also an echo of the opening, where the first Zorro tells his daughter a similar story, down the ending: both men see their wives and observe that they never did anything that stupid again.
-   A rather dark, twisted version occurs in Woody Allen's 2005 film _Match Point_, when married couple Chloe and Chris, who had spent most of the movie trying unsuccessfully for a baby, are finally shown bringing their new-born son home. Only Chloe is unaware that her husband had an affair with another woman, got her pregnant, and then murdered her in cold blood to avoid the potential ramifications.
-   The ending of _Minority Report_ shows Tom Cruise' character and his newly pregnant wife.
-   _Miss Meadows_: In the epilogue, Miss Meadows (or rather Mrs.?) is shown as happily married to Mike, and they have a baby daughter.
-   _The Nativity Story_: A twist. The film ends with Mary and Joseph having their baby, but the birth isn't an afterthought but whole point of telling the story at all, considering who the baby grows up to be.
-   The credits for _Natural Born Killers_ show Mallory (heavily pregnant) and Mickey traveling with a daughter and son, pretending to kill each other with toy weapons.
-   In _No Time to Die_, James Bond himself dies at the end, but his young daughter Mathilde will grow up knowing about her father's exploits.
-   _Notting Hill_ ends with Hugh Grant's and Julia Roberts' characters sitting in a park, Julia very clearly pregnant.
-   Happens in another Tom Cruise film, _Oblivion (2013)_, whereby his character Jack's wife, Julia, gave birth to a daughter in the 3-year time skip.
-   John Woo's _Once a Thief_ spends much of its runtime juggling around the Love Triangle between its three protagonists, Joe, James and Cherie, but eventually ends with James and Cherie having two babies and Joe becoming their Honorary Uncle.
-   _The Opposite of Sex_:
    -   Eternally alone Lucia makes a love connection with Carl. The epilogue shows them with children, and Lucia has become much happier.
    -   Dede's pregnancy is a plot point but she doesn't give birth until the climax, and this trope is fulfilled for her brother Bill. Dede plans to leave the two of them but the film cuts off before we see if she actually does.
-   _The Other Woman (2014)_ subverts it. The main couple don't have the kids. One of the cheater's mistresses and her new paramour who is the brother of the cheated on, do.
-   _Parenthood_ ends with every woman of childbearing age either giving birth, holding a new baby, or pregnant.
-   _Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End_ ends bittersweetly this way in the final scene after the credits, where we discover that Will and Elizabeth's one day before he has to leave for the next decade produced a son, who will now be meeting his father for the first time. So it's a partial subversion.
-   Played for laughs in _Pixels_. The ending skips to one year later and it's shown that human Ludlow and game character/alien Lady Lisa are married with children...who turn out to be a litter of little QBerts. Believe us, It Makes Sense in Context.
-   The end of the horror movie _Planet Terror_ shows the female lead with a baby after the main lead has died.
-   Apparently, the fact that Sandra Bullock's character was pregnant at the end of _Premonition_ was supposed to make us feel better about the grimness of the rest of the film.
-   At the end of _Prudence And The Pill_, everyone has had babies. That's what happens when you replace birth control pills with aspirin!
-   _Python_: Kristin tells Greg that she's pregnant at the end of the movie.
-   At the end of _Raising Arizona_ Hi has a vision of himself and his (apparently barren) wife Ed as grandparents to a large family.

-   _Sex and Death 101_: Rod ends up happily with Gillian, which is introduced when their little son wakes them up.
-   Played with in Buster Keaton's _Sherlock, Jr._ The movie depicts a film projectionist who falls asleep on the job, and dreams of being in the movie he's watching. When he wakes up, his love interest arrives, and he takes the movie within the movie's lead on how to act with her. When the movie within a movie's lead kisses his love interest, Keaton's character kisses his. But then Keaton looks at the movie to see "several years later..."
-   _Somebody I Used Toknow_: The finale shows Sean is happily married to Cassidy, who's pregnant with their baby.
-   _Son of a Gun_: JR escapes with Natasha at the end, gold in tow. He leaves a note telling Lynch this, alongside a photo which shows Natasha is heavily pregnant with their baby. Lynch has to smile at this.
-   _Spring_: Implied, as Louise theorizes that if she loves someone she'll stay pregnant and not change. The ending indicates that she loves Evan, will keep her form and give birth to their child as they remain happily together while Louis now becomes mortal. How happy this is though isn't clear as Vesuvius erupts again at the end in the background.
-   _Terminator_:
    -   _The Terminator_: At the end of the movie, Sarah Connor is pregnant with her son; preventing or ensuring this was the whole point of the plot.
    -   _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_: The alternate ending shows an elderly Sarah Connor watching as an adult John plays with his daughter.
-   At the end of _That Touch of Mink_, with Cary Grant and Doris Day, with the added little twist that a psychologist thinks the baby is the product of two men who married.
-   _Turner and Hooch_. This does not compensate for the Downer Ending which even Tom Hanks has admitted was a mistake.
-   _Twins (1988)_: Julius (Schwarzenegger) and Vincent (DeVito) got married to their twin love interests and each had twins.
-   _What a Way to Go!_ depicts a "cursed" woman who keeps marrying and losing husbands. At the end of the film, this trope indicates she's finally broken the curse with husband #5.

    Literature 

-   The _Acorna Series_ trilogy ends with Acorna finding out she's pregnant. Somewhat sinisterly, we also find out that She _was_ carrying twins, and one of them was stolen by Greymalkin.
-   In the _Age of Fire_ books, the first novel ends with the dragon AuRon settling down with Natasatch, lovingly embracing around a clutch of eggs. In the last novel, set decades later, the novel ends with his now-pregnant sister Wistala and her mate DharSii flying off to their home cave.
-   The epilogue of _The Alice Network_ features Charlie and Finn’s daughter. Justified: The mother in question was pregnant for the entire book, although it took her some time to decide whether to keep the baby.
-   _Anansi Boys_ plays this straight with Charlie and Daisy's son, but subverts it with Spider and Rosie. Rosie's mother is given to making pointed remarks about her lack of grandchildren and casting aspersions on Spider's virility. It's implied the reason he hasn't had any is _because_ she's so damned insistent, although as mentioned in _American Gods_, this may just be because it's very difficult for a god and a human to have a child.
-   If any couple in _The Belgariad_ or _Malloreon_ is married at the end, they'll have children. Relg and Taiba are particularly noteworthy - they marry at the end of the _Belgariad_ and have a small army of offspring by the end of the _Malloreon_ (though it's hinted they're getting divine aid - Taiba was the last Marag, thus her children would be Marags, and Mara wants his people back). Belgarion and Ce'Nedra are noteworthy in another way: at one point in the _Malloreon_, it is heavily implied that they will be getting children for a long, long time.
-   _Ben and Me_: Multiple of Amos' siblings have families of their own by the end of the book.
-   At the end of _The Black Fox of Beckham_, Arabella and Finn become mates and have kits, one of whom is black like Arabella.
-   At the end of _A Brother's Price_, Jerin Whistler's Mother Eldest has had a son, his Sister Eldest is pregnant, and so is his new wife Halley. (All by different men, don't worry.) This is a setting where childbirth is a risky endeavor in part due to the fact that men in this setting tend to have weak sperm, but the Whistlers are always lucky in that regard.
-   In White's _Charlotte's Web_ this is actually part of a Bittersweet Ending (Charlotte dies, but her babies make it).
-   _Codex Alera_ ends with Bernard and Amara expecting a child in addition to the several they've already adopted (Including Rook's daughter Masha), not to mention Tavi and Kitai's newborn son Desiderus. Both sets of children are unexpected. In Amara's case, she was infertile until the magic mushroom with healing properties cleared that up. And Tavi and Kitai are an interspecies couple, and as far as we know are the first of their two species to get together.
-   In _David Copperfield_, David is united with Agnes at the end of the book. Cue time lapse and a heartwarming scene of them living with their young children.
-   _Deltora Quest_'s third series ended with the Official Couple, Lief and Jasmine, married and having children named after their dead parents. Marilen has given birth to a son, Barda and Lindal have _six_ children, all taller than their parents, and Doom has wandered off to investigate a rumor that dragons can lay eggs without a mate if the need arises, which would be a very happy ending indeed considering each dragon has up until now been the last of their kind.
-   _Divergent_: The short story _We Can Be Mended_, which concludes the series, reveals that Zeke and Shauna are expecting a baby. According to Four, he and Christina fight over the right to name it, though they end up not getting it.
-   At the end of _Dracula_, Mina and Jonathan Harker talk of their son Quincy.
-   _Dragoncharm_: Fortune and Gossamer have a hatchling by the end of the book.
-   Regardless of how bleak most of the _Dragons of Requiem_ trilogies end, at least one couple in each trilogy will get married and/or have children during the resolution.
-   Near the end of _Emma_, Mrs. Weston gives birth to a baby girl, Anna.
-   Very common theme in the _Ender's Game_ series. The author explicitly and shamelessly inserting long speeches about how saving humanity is nothing compared to extending your line. Even people completely uninterested in sex (e.g. a man with no interest whatsoever) will settle down and get married, satisfied with adopted children but still hoping for a turkey baster miracle.
    -   In the _Ender's Shadow_ series, Anton the geneticist settles down, marries, and has a child in addition to his new step-children. He's also unashamedly gay, but can overcome his sexual urges in order to fulfill his social need for progeny. So, he's fine with being gay, and all, but...
        -   The protagonist of the same series, Bean, was originally going to subvert this trope, as he was afraid of passing on his genetic condition and his lover, Petra, is fine with this. However, various factors, including the aforementioned Anton, convince him to do his reproductive duty and he and Petra eventually have eight children via in-vitro and the last book of the series has a subplot of them having to retrieve seven of them, which have been implanted in other women by Bean's enemy, Achilles. They manage to find six of them, and the eighth one is eventualy found in _Ender in Exile_. To really drive the trope home, after Bean and the three children with his genetic condition go into space to await a cure, Petra remarries to Peter Wiggin and has six more kids with him.
    -   And in _Ender in Exile_ Graff goes on a long ramble in a letter to Ender telling him to have children, that children are amazing, breed, breed, breed.
        -   And the whole reason he did this is because he himself chose to subvert the trope years ago, choosing to symbolically adopt all mankind as his children and focus on colonizing the former Formic worlds, but now, as a retired, lonely old man, regrets his decision.
    -   _Speaker for the Dead_ and the subsequent book, _Xenocide_, has Ender marry the widowed Novinha and become a father-figure to her children. He also eventually has children of his own via interaction with The Outside.
-   The _Fifty Shades of Grey_ trilogy ends two years later, where Ana and Christian are playing with their son, Teddy. Ana is six months pregnant with a daughter whom they plan to name Phoebe. It is also mentioned that Kate and Elliot are married and had a daughter, Ava.
-   Joe Haldeman's _The Forever War_ ends with the birth announcement of Mandella and Marygay's son from the local paper.
-   The end of the first _Freckleface Strawberry_ book shows an adult Freckleface with two children, neither of whom inherited her freckles.
-   In _The Garden of Sinners_'s final light novel, Shiki and Mikiya have a daughter named Mana in the distant future. Said daughter is a huge Daddy's Girl, and wants to "beat her mother to get her father back." (Though she doesn't _hate_ her mom per se, logically). Personality and appearance-wise, Mana resembles Arima Miyako, the other Shiki's cousin in _Tsukihime_. Oh and she uses her mother's surname since Shiki is quite the Uptown Girl.
-   _Goblin Market_: Both Lizzie and Laura have children in later years, but we aren't told anything about the children's fathers. Sisterhood is depicted as more important than marriage, despite the fact that both characters are now married.
-   _Hard Times_ ends with asking whether various events each character imagines will happen to them in their future, then after each paragraph says "such things were to be". Then a fairly typical example is described in Louisa's imagination.
-   _Harry's Mad_: The book ends with the parrot "Fweddy" (previously thought male) laying an egg and saying "Call me Fwedwika", which Madison/Mad follows up with "Call me Dad".
-   _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_:
    -   Tonks and Lupin give birth to Teddy midway through the book. It's not strictly this trope since it is nowhere near the end and there is a war around them, but this serves as a conclusion to their romantic angst, as Lupin originally did not want to marry Tonks because he was afraid his children would become werewolves like him. As it turns out, Teddy is not.
    -   In the epilogue, it is revealed that Harry and Ginny had three children (James, Albus, and Lily), Ron and Hermione had two children (Rose and Hugo), and Draco had a son (Scorpius). It is also offhandedly mentioned that Teddy is sending off his girlfriend, Victoire Weasley (Bill and Fleur's daughter) as she boards for Hogwarts, along with James, Albus, Rose, and Scorpius.
    -   Word of God further expanded this. Other than the above six, Arthur and Molly Weasley end up with six more grandchildren: Louis and Dominique (Victoire's younger siblings), Fred and Roxanne (George and Angelina's children), and Molly and Lucy (Percy's daughters). Luna marries Rolf, the grandson of Newt Scamander, and has two sons, Lorcan and Lysander.
    -   Rather unsettlingly, _Voldemort_ also joins the fun as he is revealed to have had a daughter with Bellatrix shortly before they died. This daughter, Delphini, is the main antagonist of _Harry Potter and the Cursed Child_.
-   Exaggerated in _High School D×D_. An "EX Novel" set in one possible future of the series shows that Issei had at least one child with _every single one of his haremettes_.
-   In the web novel _Hokuou Kizoku to Moukinzuma no Yukiguni Karigurashi_, Ritzhard & Sieglinde had three sons named Arno, Ulrich & Erenfried, and two daughters named Veronica and Krimhilde, living a happily ever after life together.
-   _The Hunger Games_: The epilogue of _Mockingjay_ shows that Annie had a child with the late Finnick. Also, it took fifteen years, but Peeta persuaded Katniss. They end up having two children: a girl with her black hair and his blue eyes, and a boy with his blond hair and her gray eyes.
-   At the end of _The Ickabog_, the titular creature has two babies and Roderick and Martha have five children.
-   _Jane Eyre_: There's plenty that's dark about the final act, but in the last two pages or so nearly all of that is swept aside in favor of warm feelings. Not only is Jane and Rochester's newborn son one of the last images we get, we also get Rochester miraculously regaining his sight in his one remaining eye so he can see the face of his child.
-   The book, _Jap Herron_ ends with Jap's wife Isabel Granger giving birth to a baby boy she names Jasper William.
-   In Peter S. Beagle's _The Last Unicorn_, a town is afraid to have children because of the prophecy that their prosperity depended on Haggard, and one of their children would bring him down. At the end, when it has been fulfilled, Prince Lir urges this trope on them; it might help.
-   In the Left Behind book _Kingdom Come_, Kenny Williams and Ekaterina Risto become a baby-producing couple for the rest of the Millennium.
-   Sora gave birth to Yuuta's daughter in the after story novel of _Listen to me, girls. I am your father!_.
-   _Little Women_: Although Meg had her twins earlier in the book, the "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue chapter shows Jo now with two young sons (and a school full of surrogate sons) and Amy with a baby daughter. Interestingly, only Meg has any more children in the sequels set after this chapter.
-   _Lolita_. After she finally escapes him, Humbert eventually finds Dolores several years later, married to a man called Schiller and expecting a child. But it's subverted — the introduction of the novel lists Mrs. Schiller as having died in childbirth.
-   In the ending of _The Lovely Bones_, Susie mentions that her younger sister, Lindsey, eventually has a daughter named Abigail Suzanne, named after her and their mother.
-   _The Lord of Bembibre_: The final scene reveals that Millán and Martina had one daughter whom they named after the latter's mistress.
-   J. R. R. Tolkien's _The Lord of the Rings_:
    -   Sam and Rosie end up having thirteen children, which is a large family even for hobbits. Word of God explicitly states that Sam embodies the true happy end and reason for their troubles: being able to live a simple honest life with a good family and good work.
    -   To a lesser extent, Aragorn and Arwen as well. They have one boy (Eldarion) and several girls (who remain unnamed) before his death 120 years after the end of _Return of the King_.
-   _Love You Forever_ ends with the boy, now a man, singing to his infant daughter.
-   In _The Mer_, Mers can't have biological children, but in the epilogue, after Val and Will have become a couple, they adopted an infant who transformed into a Mer after drowning in a boating accident. Mer age so slowly that raising him will be a centuries-long commitment.
-   In Poul Anderson's _A Midsummer Tempest_ Dénouement, Jennifer is looking forward to this.

-   In Philip Reeve's _Mortal Engines_'s _Predator's Gold_, Hester is pregnant at the end.
-   Simona Ahrnstedt has ended two of her novels, _Överenskommelser_ and "De skandalösa", with the story's female protagonist being pregnant. "Överenskommelser" even has an epilogue, that only has been printed in the paper-back version, which really is about the birth of Beatrice's and Seth's baby. The two beta couples already have babies at that point.
-   Subverted in _The Pendragon Adventure_, as even though Bobby gets to relive his life as a normal human, his Traveler heritage makes it impossible for him and Courtney to have children.
-   The original _Petaybee_ trilogy ends with Yana giving birth to twins, who display their father's shapeshifting abilities at birth.

-   _Please Don't Tell My Parents_ Series: The Happily Ever After is only Implied, but in the Prequel _I Did NOT Give That Spider Superhuman Intelligence!_, Robin/Starshine is a young adult. Decades later in _Please Don't Tell My Parents I'm a Giant Monster_, she's seen as the mother of Entropy and the view-point character Mirabelle.
-   In one of the final chapters of _Pride and Prejudice_, it's indicated that Elizabeth's best friend Charlotte is pregnant with her first child.
-   In Anthony Hope's _The Prisoner of Zenda_, despite Rudolf's unhappy ending, this trope is hit on for another character:
    
    _Last time, his pretty wife Helga came, and a lusty crowing baby with her._
    
-   In L. Jagi Lamplighter's _Prospero Regained_, Astreus observes at the end that he and Miranda can both fly — perhaps they should raise a flock. When they are about to marry, he prophesies that they will have this trope and about their descendants.
-   The end of _Redeeming Love_ reveals that Angel, who was supposedly barren, was able to have four children with her husband Michael after they were finally reunited for good.
-   _Red Queen_: The short story collection _Broken Throne_ reveals that, in the future, Mare and Cal are married and have two children, a boy named Shade and a girl named Coriane.
-   Occurs in _The Redemption of Althalus_ to the titular character and Dweia.
-   Will and Eleanor have three daughters in the epilogue to _The Road to Wellville_.
-   The Sally Lockhart mystery _Shadow in the North_ has this ending, with the child going on to be extremely important to the plot in the following book (_Tiger in the Well_).

-   There are plenty of new children in the epilogue of _Seven Years Awesome Luck_, but of particular note is Denneka being pregnant, with the possibility that the baby may inherit cat traits from its father.
-   Occurs multiple times in Juliet Marillier's _The Sevenwaters Trilogy_: at the end of _Daughter of the Forest_, Sorcha is pregnant, and _Child Of The Prophecy_ includes an epilogue in which the hero and heroine have two children. One is even named after her dead mother.
-   _The Shadowhunter Chronicles_:
    -   _The Infernal Devices_ ends with Tessa and Will marrying and having two children, James and Lucie. However, she only stays with the family until Will dies 58 years after they wed. Following that, she goes to a self-imposed exile; as an immortal warlock, she could not bear seeing her children and descendants grow old and die.
    -   _The Last Hours_ ends with the birth of Cordelia's and Alastair's little brother, Zach, who will presumably carry on the Carstairs family name (and therefore become Emma's ancestor) since Alastair has decided not to adopt a baby after coming out as gay. Also, Charlotte and Henry are expecting twins.

-   At the end of _Spice and Wolf_, Holo reveals to Lawrence that she is pregnant after settling down together. The spin-off series _Wolf and Parchment_ focuses on their daughter, Myuri, as one of the main characters.
-   At the end of _The Stand_, Fran gave birth to a child from a former relationship and ends up pregnant with Stu's child. Also, Lucy is revealed to have given birth to Larry's twins.
-   Subverted in _Stardust_, as Tristran and Yvaine are very happy even though they can't have children, since he's mortal and she's a star. Played straight in the film, though.
-   The _Star Trek_ novel _The Fire and the Rose_ ends with Spock and his love interest in the story, Alexandra, having a baby girl after they get married. This book is part of a self-contained trilogy separate from both established canon and the Star Trek Novel Verse, known as the _Crucible_ trilogy<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
-   Not exactly an ending trope, but in Star Wars Legends just about anyone who has gotten married - be they a main from the movies, an Ascended Extra, or an original - has had children at some point. Almost always one boy, or a set of male-female twins. The exception to that would be Wedge and Iella, who had two non-twin daughters. The only Happily Married couple who didn't have kids would be Winter and Tycho—Winter seems to have considered working as the Solo kids' nanny enough of an experience.
-   In Hal Clement's _Still River_, when they plan a return to the planetoid, a woman scientist observes that some of the aliens are coming out of curiosity in her pregnancy.
-   _Stray_ is about a stray cat telling his grandson his life's story. The last few chapters end on his grandson's mother being born and becoming a pet.
-   _The Suicide Shop_ has Marilyn Tuvache pregnant with the child of her lover Ernest near the end of the book.
-   _The Summer King Chronicles_ ends with adorable fluffy gryphon chicks for Kjorn and Thyra, Einarr and Astri, Halvden and Kenna, and most other mated pairs of the Silver Isles pride. The sequel short story collection _The Starward Light_ gives them more characterization and introduces Shard and Brynja's daughter as well.
-   _Taste Of Marrow_ has a variation. Hero and their gay lover Houndstooth decide to retire and open a ranch, so Hero invites recently retired contract killer Adelia to live with them so she can raise her baby as one of their family.
-   In _A Tale of Two Cities_, Sydney Carton's death will be followed Charles and Lucy Darnay having another child, who will be named for him.
    
    _I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy, in that England which I shall see no more. I see Her with a child upon her bosom, who bears my name._
    
-   Of the characters who have their conclusions told in _The Tenant of Wildfell Hall_, the good ones are happily married with large families and the bad ones are either dead or miserably alone.
-   _Tomcat Blue Eyes' Diaries_: The book ends with an adorable pair of Siamese cats, Kiki and Blue Eyes, having four kittens.
-   Exaggerated at the conclusion of the Colleen McCullough novel _The Touch_, where Elizabeth not only introduces her daughter Nell to her new baby brother and sister, her stepfather informs her that she's expecting again.
-   Of particular note is the Tower and the Hive series, where every major story arc ended with the main female protagonist pregnant. In fact, it went in generations in the series proper: The Rowan was pregnant with Child #2 at the end of _The Rowan_, Damia (Child #3) was pregnant with her first at the end of _Damia_ and Laria (the child Damia was carrying in the previous mention) was pregnant at the end of _The Tower And The Hive_ (with the implication that her younger brother Thian's lover was pregnant as well)
-   _Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs_: The Web Serial Novel version has a Bitter Sweet Ending variant, with Leon having kids with his four wives, and The Lancer Marie having kids with her five husbands. Leon is stuck Resigned to the Call as The Adventure Continues and unable to spend time with his family, and Marie, who's The Chew Toy thanks to the Rich in Dollars, Poor in Sense antics of her husbands, has her burdens only increase living on an island with each of them in turn to avoid a Mama's Baby, Papa's Maybe situation to give them each an undisputed heir.
-   _Trapped on Draconica_: In the epilogue, Ben dreams that Daniar is pregnant during her wedding to Kalak.
-   Meyer's _The Twilight Saga_ sort of ends on this. Bella and Edward have Renesmee midway through _Breaking Dawn_ after an Express Delivery and the last half of the book is spent cleaning up all the loose ends caused by her existence. Oh, and Renesmee is also imprinted by Jacob, ergo solving the Edward-Bella-Jacob Love Triangle. Notable for many readers having found it incredibly repulsive rather than heartwarming.
-   Lois McMaster Bujold is an explicit subscriber to this trope; she always intended for Vorkosigan Saga's Aral Vorkosigan and Cordelia Naismith to have a kid, after she came up with them. Of course, given her views on proper Character Development, this is very much _not_ Happily Ever After...
    -   A later book in the series to date ends with Miles attending the birth of his son and daughter; after that, _Cryoburn_ reveals that Miles and Ekaterin have added two more daughters to the count while all of the Koudelka sisters except Kareen have had at least one child with their respective partners. And most importantly (as far as Miles, Mark and Ivan are concerned) is that Gregor and Laisa have gotten around to securing the line of succession for the throne. By _Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen_, Miles and Ekaterin are up to six kids, plus Ivan and Tej (offscreen) have apparently spawned. The kicker, however, would be Cordelia and her late husband Aral's male partner Oliver Jole. Cordelia uses frozen sperm willed to her by Aral to produce six female zygotes, all of which she plans to have brought to term. She also shares some of Aral's sperm, as well as leftover enucleated eggs from her, with Oliver so that he can engage in Homosexual Reproduction and produce sons that will be biologically both his and Aral's. Three of them.
-   _War and Peace_ features the two surviving couples—Pierre and Natasha, Nikolay and Marya—each with several children in the epilogue. Naturally most of them are named after deceased friends of their parents.
-   Happens a few times in _Warrior Cats_:
    -   _Firestar's Quest_ ends with an epilogue three moons after the main story, with Firestar and Sandstorm naming their newborn daughters.
    -   _Bramblestar's Storm_ ends with an epilogue in manga format, where Bramblestar and Squirrelflight realize that Squirrelflight is pregnant with their kits. This is particularly significant as they're the couple with the greatest case of Official Couple Ordeal Syndrome in the series and there was a whole big deal over the last two arcs where Squirrelflight had been led to believe she could never become pregnant, so she'd secretly adopted her sister's forbidden kits and hadn't told Bramblestar the truth, which had led to drama between them.
-   The ending to _We Can't Rewind_, though whether one should consider it heartwarming or creepy under the circumstances is left for the reader to decide.
-   In _The Widow of Desire,_ Natalie Stuart marries Russian businessman Wallace Nevsky, but he is killed due to his uncovering of a conspiracy in the USSR. When caught up in the events herself, she finds out she's pregnant with Wallace's son.
-   Subverted in _The Woman in Black_. Arthur Kipps unravels the Woman in Black's mystery, marries his fiancée, and has a son with her. It seems happily ever after, until The Woman in Black murders his wife and son a year later.
-   In _The Woman in White_, Laura, who has been sick for most of the last quarter of the novel, marries her love interest and they have a son. The birth of Laura's son isn't just happy for general sentimental reasons, but also represents a final victory over the villains who tried to deprive her of her inheritance; the Fairlie estate was entailed to only be inherited by male relatives, which is why her uncle got it after her father, but now on her uncle's death it comes to Laura in trust for her son.
-   _The Yukon Wolf_ ends with Arnaaluk having a litter.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Taken to ridiculous extremes with the original series finale of _7th Heaven_, which revealed that Mary, Lucy, and Matt's wife Sarah were all pregnant... _with twins_. It was ultimately subverted when the show was unexpectedly renewed for another season based on the strength of the intended finale's ratings, with the season premiere revealing that Lucy miscarried her twins. Then it was double subverted when Lucy became pregnant again towards the end of the (actual) final season.
-   During the finale of the TV mini-series _The 10th Kingdom_, Wolf reveals to Virginia that he knows she's "got a little wolf cub growing inside" of her. Wolf also makes the none-too-subtle comment to Tony of "See you soon, grampa!" before stepping into the traveling mirror.
-   Subverted in _Absolutely Fabulous_ with the strong implication that the reason Saffy isn't happy ever after with her two young children, to the point of an absent father, is entirely because her mother now lives next door.
-   The 33rd season of _The Amazing Race_ had to be paused for almost nineteen months (from February 2020 to September 2021) due to the COVID pandemic. This resulted in four of the teams in this season not being able to return due to other things coming up in life. One of said teams, Connie and Sam Greiner, had a baby in December 2021 and could not come back as a result.
-   The Grand Finale of _Amen_ sees Thelma giving birth to hers and the Reverend's son.
-   _Arrow_ has a weird case of this. The final episode shows Diggle and Lyla watching Oliver's dedication on TV with their children, J.J. and Sara. Both have actually been seen previously, but their existence together is a paradox; Sara was their child before the Flashpoint timeline happened, which retconned her out of existence, replacing her with J.J. As it turns out, Oliver has tinkered the timeline so they can have the best of both worlds and allow them to exist together.
-   _Being Human (US)_: Nora and Josh have a vision of their happy future together at the end of the show. In it, they have twin children, a son and a daughter. They name them after Sally and Aidan.
-   The final episode of _The Big Bang Theory_ Penny is revealed to be pregnant (Bernadette and Howard already have two).
-   The series finale of _Big Love_ features the christening of Bill's namesake grandson.
-   The season one finale of _Bridgerton_ flashes forward from the reconciliation of the two main romantic leads, Daphne and Simon, to her giving birth to their first child, Augie. It is extra significant for them because a major issue before was that Simon refused to sire children, while Daphne longed to be a mother. The birth of their son shows Simon finally overcoming this issue and embracing fatherhood.
-   The last scene of _Castle_ shows Castle and Beckett with three children who are presumably theirs.
-   _Charmed (1998)_: The epilogue shows that Phoebe and Paige eventually had children with their love interests - each with three, to continue the theme of the series. Piper - who already had two son in the course of the series - is shown with a daughter to give her three children as well. For an added bonus, the last scene shows her grandchildren playing around her.
-   At the conclusion of the Mini Series _Children Of The Dust_, as the two heroines leave the cemetery where their respective lovers have been buried, one's young son comes running towards her, thus revealing that he left her Someone to Remember Him By.
-   The final minutes of the series finale of _Cold Case_ has Lily Rush rescuing her sister from her abusive boyfriend and discovering that she has an infant daughter.
-   During the series finale of _The Cosby Show_, the family gets a phone call from Denise congratulating her brother Theo on his college graduation. . . and informing them that she's pregnant.
-   At the end of _Coupling_, the main couple Steve and Sue have a baby. It's an ending which tends to divide fans — some are dissatisfied, considering the nature of the show's comedy, and some think it's rather sweet (and are glad that Steve finally grew the hell up).
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   Subverted in "The Family of Blood", when the Doctor has become human temporarily to escape a band of aliens that can follow the TARDIS anywhere. As a human (John Smith), he meets and falls in love with a normal woman, then, due to them both touching a piece of Applied Phlebotinum at the same time, shares a vision with her of them marrying, having children, and of an elderly "John" on his deathbed, secure in the knowledge that his children and grandchildren are happy. Knowing that the Doctor had a wife and at least two children at one point (all dying in as-yet unrevealed circumstances) but has since decided that he can _never_ have "a normal life" means that, while creepy, it seems entirely fitting when the Doctor takes care of the aliens that were responsible, even if indirectly, for him experiencing that life.
    -   Subverted in "Amy's Choice", where the Doctor, Amy and Rory wind up in what initially appears to be a flash-forward in Amy and Rory's lives to a time when they're happily married and settled in an idyllic village, with a baby on the way. However, it soon turns out to be a nightmarish dream-world construction specifically designed to torture Amy into making a choice between her life with the Doctor and her potential life with Rory.
    -   A strange example in "Hide". The Doctor tells the Companions-of-the-Week that they end up getting married, and the time traveller they helped save during the episode is actually their descendant.
-   Variant in _Dollhouse_: the Ensemble Dark Horse couple (Priya/Sierra and Tony/Victor) had a son between "The Hollow Men" and "Epitaph One” but Tony and Priya had a falling-out and split, leaving Priya as a single mom. However, they are reunited eventually, and all three survive to the end of the series.
-   The final episode of _Elementary_ starts with the introduction of Joan's young son Arthur. In season 6, she began thinking of adoption, and she ultimately she did in the three year timeskip.
-   _The Eternal Love_: Played with. Xiao Tan and Lian Cheng have a baby, then are forced to leave him behind when they're sent to the present shortly after his birth.

-   Teased in the penultimate episode of _Firefly_. After the events of The Movie, Wash and Zoe's son becomes Someone to Remember Him By in the comics and appears as a young adult later. Simon and Kaylee are shown with two kids in the same comic.
-   _Flashpoint_: Sam and Jules find out they're expecting a baby midway through the final season, which they announce at their wedding in the series finale. The final scene, which takes place a year after the rest of the finale, includes a brief scene of them with their infant daughter.
-   _Friends_ ended with the birth of Chandler and Monica's adopted twins.
-   From Korean drama _Goong_, it was implied that the main character was pregnant, judging from her and her husband's half-amazed, half-stunned look the two of them shared when another characted suggested it when the main character was feeling sick. A portrait of teddy bears would appear, usually at the end of the episode and highlighting an important scene from the episode. For the last episode, the main character's teddy bear was holding a baby bear.
-   The last scene of _Gossip Girl_ shows Chuck and Blair having a son named Henry.
-   _Heroes_: Played with — in season three this trope is used (via Isaac Mendez-style paintings) to show Matt Parkman that his "happy ever after" future has been irreparably altered, in that such a future for him and his wife has been knocked out by some event in the present.
-   The whole story of _How I Met Your Mother_ will lead to this ending, seeing as the Framing Device is the memoirs of the male character relating the tale to his kids; the real question is, which woman does he really end up with?
-   In _Jack Taylor_, this is played for drama in the episode "The Magdalen Martyrs". The episode is interspliced with flashbacks to diary entries of a young woman named Geraldine who spent six years in a Magdalene laundry in Galway, tormented and terrorized by a particularly sadistic nun whom all the girls called Lucifer. Both she and her best friend, Mary Catherine, eventually left St. Monica's, got married, and had children, but their friendship fell apart because Mary Catherine didn't want to acknowledge any reminder of her time in there. Mary Catherine became such an emotionally abusive mother to her son that in the present time they can't look each other in the eye. Meanwhile, Geraldine's marriage fell apart and she, prone to depression and self-mutilation, eventually took her own life, which affected her own son and daughter greatly. Lucifer even strips this trope down to its bones when she gives a Breaking Speech to Mary Catherine.
    
    _"You think you're getting away, don't you? I know your plan. You'll get married, have a house, have children. And you'll make sure there's nothing ever to remind you of me or of your time in here. But you see, I'll always be with you. Because you. Let me. In here."_ (she taps Mary Catherine's forehead forcefully) _"And that's where I'll stay."_
    
-   _The King of Queens_ ends with Doug and Carrie adjusting to raising their one-year-old adopted daughter, Ming-Mei, and their newborn daughter.
-   The series finale of _Lois & Clark_. They come downstairs to find said baby mysteriously in their living room with no idea of where it came from. Had the promised fifth season gone ahead, Word of God has it that it would have turned out to be one of their descendants, brought to the present by H.G. Wells to avoid it dying in the future.
-   _The Mentalist_:
    -   The happily married Wayne Rigsby and Grace Van Pelt have a baby daughter, Maddie, and a successful consulting business in the sixth-season episode "My Blue Heaven", set two years after the events of earlier in the season. They returned for one plot in season 7 and for a token appearance in the finale, but they're basically ending in the series as happy parents.
    -   In the series finale "White Orchids", Lisbon tells Jane that she is pregnant, to his stunned joy.
-   _Moon Lovers_: Played with. Ha-jin gives birth to Wang So's baby after she marries Wang Jeong. She dies shortly afterwards, leaving Wang Jeong to raise her daughter alone.
-   _The Nanny_ ends with not only Fran and Maxwell having twins, but also C.C. and Niles discovering that C.C.'s pregnant.
-   At the end of _Once and Again_, Lily finds out she's pregnant.
-   _One Tree Hill_ managed to pull this off three times.
    -   Lucas and Peyton find out that they’re expecting their first child during the sixth season, with Peyton giving birth to daughter Sawyer in the opening moments of the season finale. Whilst the show continued for another three seasons, Lucas and Peyton departed the series in this episode.
    -   Brooke and Julian have twin boys in the season eight finale, with the episode condensing the bulk of Brooke’s pregnancy into the season finale. The season as a whole was produced under the impression that it was going to be the final season, but The CW renewed the series for a final ninth season after production had wrapped.
    -   Mouth and Millicent are shown to be expecting their first child in the final moments of the series, which features a Time Skip to show the main characters a few years later.
-   The series finale of _Passions_ takes this to a ridiculous level, with the female half of _every_ couple of childbearing age—and there are many—revealing that she's pregnant. Ironically, only the signature couple of Ethan and Theresa are exempted from this, probably because they already have several children already.
-   _Perfect Strangers_ ends with Larry and Balki's respective wives, Jennifer and Mary Ann, having given birth to their children.
-   At the end of the _Agatha Christie's Poirot_ adaptation of _The Chocolate Box_, it is revealed that Poirot's old friend Jean-Louis Ferraud is married to Virginie Mesnard and they have two sons named Henri and Hercule.
-   _The Red Green Show_: The "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue shows that Harold and Bonnie ended up with fraternal twins.
-   _Scrubs_'s series finale ends this way, although all of what JD sees for this trope are only possibilities and do not actually happen because they are a giant montage video playing in front of him. (If you count the ninth/spinoff season, JD and Elliot did indeed have a baby.)
-   _Sex/Life_: After at last Billie and Brad get together, marrying, she also whispers into his ear that she's pregnant, the last bit of their happy ending.
-   _Spaced_ has an epilogue where Tim and Daisy have a child.
-   The series finale of _Star Trek: Voyager_ ends with the title ship making it back home just as B'Elanna is giving birth.
-   The final episode of _Supernatural_ shows that Sam ends up fathering a son named after Dean.
-   There's a pretty creepy one in the Distant Finale of _Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!_. After an elderly Tim and sex-changed Eric reunite fifty years later, there's a montage featuring their wedding and the absurd amount of babies they have together. (followed by Tim's slow death and Eric finding another man, much to the dismay of Tim's ghost.)
-   _Timeless_: In the Distant Finale, Lucy and Wyatt have had twin girls.
-   _Transparent_: During Maura Pfefferman's funeral in the Finale Movie _Musicale Finale_, Maura's son Josh is introduced by his own son Colton to his grandson Bradley.
-   _Trigonometry_: The series ends with Kieran, Gemma and Ray happy together, while Gemma's gotten pregnant with all three watching the ultrasound.
-   In the series finale of _True Blood_, the Distant Finale makes it clear that a lot of time has been spent in maternity wards during the intervening years.
-   Although it didn't happen in _Ultraman Tiga_, in the Sequel Series _Ultraman Dyna_ (set maybe a decade later), we discover that Daigo Madoka, the main character from Tiga, eventually married Reina and had a daughter with her. A further special edition episode reveals the couple had a son, too, who inherits his father's Ultra-powers.
    -   Similar example to above, _Ultraman Saga_ features the return of Musashi Haruno from _Ultraman Cosmos_ a decade earlier, who by that time had a son with Ayano Morimoto.
-   The Grand Finale of _Walker, Texas Ranger_, "The Final Show/Down", ends with the titular policeman and Alex welcoming their daughter, Angela Walker into the world.
-   _Welcome to Sweden_: The series ends on a high note with the final scene, where after their marriage Bruce and Emma learn she's pregnant.
-   In the finale of _Will & Grace_, both Will and Grace have children with their respective partners. The kids meet in college and a few more years later BAM! they get engaged.
-   _The X-Files_:
    -   At the end of Season 8, Mulder and Scully got together with their normal, healthy, (seemingly) one-hundred percent human baby. The producers eventually ditched the baby in the interest of producing more _X-Files_ stories.
    -   Done _again_ at the end of season 11, after once more getting rid of the first kid, even though this is unlikely for a woman of Scully's age—particularly one who has struggled with infertility in the past. It was only one of many criticisms about the reboot and Chris Carter's understanding of female characters.
-   _You Me Her_: Jack, Emma and Izzy get back together once again in the series finale. After this, a Time Skip takes place, then we see Izzy in the hospital while giving birth to a baby. She also has adopted Leo now, with them all happy together.

    Music 

-   Rod Stewart's _Young Turks_ is about a teen couple, Billy and Patti, who run away from home and start anew. To show that everything turns out great, the last line of the song (before a repeat of the chorus) is, "Patti gave birth to a ten pound baby boy! YEAH!"

    Myths & Religion 

-   Inverted somewhat in some versions of the tragedy _Deirdre of the Sorrows._ Deirdre has just about reached marriageable age in Gaelic Iron-Age Ireland (15 for women, 18 for men) when she falls in love with Naoise and they flee Ulster to Scotland with Naoise's brothers to escape the wrath of King Conchobhar of Ulster, who wants Deirdre all to himself. In some versions of the tale, Deirdre and Naoise have a son, Gaiar, and a daughter, Aebgreine, during their self-imposed exile. They don't exactly have a happy ending, but for several years they are happy with their little family.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Slamm-0 and Netcat of _Shadowrun,_ at some point in between the 4th and 5th editions, got hitched and had a son. Slightly subverted as they continue to interact with other runners online and are even implied to be continuing to run.
-   According to the _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ Master Guide 4, Pirika is the daughter of Reeze and Kamui, which means they have survived the events of the Duel Terminal storyline.

    Theatre 

-   _Come from Away_ has Unga, a pregnant bonobo, who was transferring zoos and ended up stranded along with nearly 7,000 people in Gander, Newfoundland during the attacks of September 11. She is cared for by Bonnie Harris of Gander's SPCA, but the stress causes her to miscarry her baby. When Unga finally arrives at a zoo in Ohio, she goes on to have a baby that the zoo names Gander.
-   During the "Where Are They Now?" Epilogue of _Legally Blonde_, Paulette reveals that she got married to Kyle and has three kids, plus one more on the way, getting up to show her pregnant belly.
-   _A Midsummer Night's Dream_: Oberon sets out to bless the children being conceived on the couples' wedding nights.
    
    **Oberon**. Now, until the break of day,  
    Through this house each fairy stray.  
    To the best bride-bed will we,  
    Which by us shall blessed be;  
    And the issue there create  
    Ever shall be fortunate.  
    So shall all the couples three  
    Ever true in loving be;  
    And the blots of Nature's hand  
    Shall not in their issue stand;  
    Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,  
    Nor mark prodigious, such as are  
    Despised in nativity,  
    Shall upon their children be.
    
-   _Rock of Ages_: Drew and Sherrie leave behind their dreams of rock and roll and motion picture fame to find true happiness together, resulting in them moving to Glendale and having a baby. Cut to Express Delivery in sort of Away in a Manger status in the show's fictional bar, complete with an angel, aka the deceased bar owner.

    Video Games 

-   In _13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim_'s Distant Finale, two of the official couples, Shu with Yuki and Nenji with Tomi, end up with children.
-   In _Agarest Senki_, the true end of Generation 5 has a scene which shows your main love interest with and her (and Rex's) baby. (Including Dyshana).
-   In _Aquaria_, the protagonist ends up having a child with her love interest, that is then set up as the protagonist for the sequel in the secret ending.
-   In the end of _Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal_, Aerie gave birth to CHARNAME's and, later in the epilogue, his daughter. Viconia also give birth to his son in the epilogue and, if you have installed the Ascention mod, so is Jaheira. If you've installed her mod, Saerileth has a LOT of children with CHARNAME, and if you've installed the Ascention mod, a female CHARNAME can have a daughter with Anomen.
-   _Bendy and the Ink Machine_: Happened for Wally Franks at some point, because a letter on Joey's bulletin board reveals that he has grandchildren.
-   _Blaster Master Zero III_'s Golden Ending has Jason and Eve Happily Married with twins named Roddy and Elfie, after ANDREIA's dead MA pilot and support droid from _II_.
-   The best ending of _Castlevania Legends_ ends with Trevor Belmont's birth.
-   Fuuko's ending in _Conception 2: Children Of The Seven Stars_, in which she teaches her child named after Fuuko's deceased friend how to swim.
-   Miko gave birth to Cece, Mimi and Vivi in the true ending of _Cross Edge._
-   _Demon Gaze_ ends with Fran and Oz with a baby girl. There is also a scene that happens before the final dungeon that largely implies that they had sex.
-   _Dragon's Lair II_ begins with numerous children of varying ages, which makes _Dragon's Lair_ qualify.
-   Zoë Castillo's ending in _Dreamfall Chapters_ is this, as we see her pregnant five years after the events of the game. While we're told that she will have a daughter, we're not given any additional context about how the pregnancy came about or how—or with whom, if anyone—she'll be parenting.
-   Happens four times _Duel Savior Destiny_ during different routes, meaning over half of them qualify. However, the first one you'll run across is merely an invocation of the idea. The final route really goes overboard with this.
-   In _The Elder Scrolls_ series' lore, Sai, the Deity of Human Origin God of Luck celebrated in the Iliac Bay region, was tasked after being brought back to life with Walking the Earth to help balance the world by spreading his good luck. He performed this task well but then met and settled down with a Nord woman, with whom he had a daughter. However, as lingering in one place for too long would unbalance the world by giving it too much good luck, he was visited and punished by a procession of other gods which ended with his physical form being taken away. After his physical form faded away entirely, his decedents are said to be able to "feel" his presence once a year.
-   This trope is completely inverted in _F.E.A.R. 2_. The game ends with Alma pregnant with the protagonist's baby because she raped him while he was busy fighting the final boss within his mind. Since this sets up the story for the third game, _this is not a good thing_.
-   Regardless of which ending you get in _Fahrenheit_, Carla is pregnant with Lucas's child. Difference? The Great/Good Ending has Lucas and Carla's child grow up in a peaceful world, the Good/Normal ending has their child grow up in the world prior to the game's premise, while the Bad/Cliffhanger ending has their child grow up to become the next Prophecy Child to change the world back to normal.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   Implied in the end of _Final Fantasy IV_, as the ending cutscene includes the wedding of the Official Couple, and confirmed in the sequel, given who a major character in it is. In fact, as said child's age was given as 17 in the original release of _The After Years_, many thought the scene where Rosa visits Cecil in his personal quarters and there's a Fade to Black was the night their kid was conceived (_TAY_ takes place 17 years after the original game), meaning Rosa was likely in the early stages of her pregnancy throughout the events of _IV_. _The Complete Collection_ would later bump down the child's age to 15, but _\-Interlude-_, a short interquel chapter bundled in with the compilation, has Rosa outright state she's indeed pregnant.
    -   In the ending epilogue of _Final Fantasy V_ shows the eggs of Boko's mate hatched.
    -   In "Mog's House," a game-within-the-game in _Final Fantasy VII_ (can be played at Gold Saucer), if Mog manages to impress the female mog with his flying, the ending shows the ridiculously fruitful bounty of their joining.
    -   _Final Fantasy IX_ has possibly the most touching subversion in the series: The ending sequence is occasionally interrupted by a letter, with an unknown author. It turns out to be written by Vivi, a main character who was revealed to be a puppet with a very limited lifespan. As the ending sequence proceeds, the letter grows more and more depressing, slowly making it clear that the author is dead or dying — but we see Vivi happily walking around the city of Alexandria just like in the opening sequence. It turns out Vivi did die after all, and the boy we see is his "son" — the first of about a _dozen_. Vivi ends his letter with a final goodbye to everyone.
    -   _Final Fantasy X-2_: Lulu, who had been pregnant throughout the game, is seen holding a baby at the end. The baby is born in the chapter _before_ the finale (and a major plot point is Wakka getting over himself enough to name the kid).
-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   This is how _Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade_ ends if some characters are paired up, which also serves to give the protagonists of _Binding Blade_ a cameo role. To note: Eliwood and \[Ninian, Lyn or Fiora\] (Roy), Hector and \[Florina, Farina or Lyn\] (Lilina), Nino and \[Erk or Jaffar\] (Ray and Lugh), Lyn and Rath (Sue), Rebecca and (\[either Lowen, Sain or Wil\] (Wolt).
    -   Some of the paired endings in _Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones_ will mention the married characters's children. These are: Eirika and Saleh (daughter), Innes and Vanessa (not specified), Kyle and Lute (daughter), Lute and Artur (son), Neimi and Colm (daughter _and_ son), Amelia and Franz (daughter), Amelia and Ross (son), Amelia and Ewan (daughter), Kyle and Syrene (daughter).
    -   Played with in _Fire Emblem: Awakening_: Save for Lucina, the time traveling Second Generation charas aren't born _yet_, so they're mentioned to be properly "born" after the end of the game. Notably, as the kids are from a Bad Future that the ending averts, they still hang around in the "present" - one of Cynthia's supports with whoever her father is even has her asking him to still think of her after this timeline's Cynthia is born.
    -   This happens in _Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia_ as well: If both Mae and Boey live, they marry and have _many_ kids, whereas Kliff goes Walking the Earth and later his son returns to Valentia and serves the royalty. It's also fair to assume that Clair and Gray have kids if both of them survive, but a child is only _specifically_ mentioned if they both live yet Gray's best friend Tobin dies, since they name their firstborn child after him.
    -   In _Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn_, if you got a A rank support between Leanne and Naesala, the epilogue shows that they have a raven boy and a heron girl.
-   In the epilogue of _Front Mission 5_ which takes place several years later, the protagonist Walter and Lynn had a daughter who has grown up to a woman and greeted her father Colonel Walter (promoted) in front of Lynn's grave (Never disclose how she died).
-   The main campaign of the final installment of _Gardens Inc_ ends with Jill giving birth, after having been pregnant for the entire game.
-   A very, very twisted use of this trope occurs in _Gingiva_. If you agree to marry any of the many monsters who propose to you, you'll be treated to a dialogue of "many years passing in domestic bliss", as the screen slowly fills with babies. The game will then ask if you want to sue for divorce; saying yes allows you to continue playing, saying no results in a Non-Standard Game Over.
-   The endings of both _Grandia_ and _Grandia III_ show the children of the two lead characters. One kid in the third game, but _five_ in the first, apparently a pair of twins and a set of triplets.
-   In the Playable Epilogue of _Grow Maze_ you can go back in a room where you left two creatures in love and you'll see that they got a baby.
-   In _Growing Up_, You and your high school romance<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  inevitably have a child or adopt one at the end of your journey, and they will be your character in your next run.
-   Generally the goal of most _Harvest Moon_ games: Marry your love interest, and have a baby with them. Since plenty have a Playable Epilogue, the baby usually isn't part of an "ending" per se, but it is in at least one game: _Harvest Moon 3_ on the Game Boy, if you're playing as the female character, will show you and your farming partner under a tree with a baby in the ending.
-   Ending Tu fui ego eris in _Haunting Ground_: Zigzagged in a terrible and creepy way. Followed by Laughing Mad.
-   You and your Love Interest can start a family in _I Was a Teenage Exocolonist_'s many endings, and so does your pet if you have one. Cal and Tammy also have many more children after Echinacea if they formalize their union and settle down.
-   In _Kitty Powers' Matchmaker_, this is the best possible ending for a couple after you've matched them, even for same-gender couples. They'll even name their baby after you.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   One of the final scenes of _Twilight Princess_ shows this happening to Rusl and Uli. Granted they were married with a child for the course of the game and Uli's pregnancy is both visually noticeable and plot-related, the fact that they show the baby at the end makes it count.
    -   _Breath of the Wild_ had three different couples that the player could help bring together (Perda/Wabbin, Rhondson/Hudson, and Finley/Sansan). By time of _Tears of the Kingdom_ several years later, both of the former couples are married and have young daughters.
-   Zoe and Twinsen's baby is born at the end of _Little Big Adventure 2_.
-   One of the endings of _Mana Khemia: Alchemists of Al-Revis_ shows Vayne and Nikki years later as the tired parents of three very active little children, noting that they won't have much time alone until the kids grow up.
-   In the _Lair of the Shadow Broker_ DLC for _Mass Effect 2_, if you romanced Liara in the first game and stayed faithful, you can suggest this as a possibility in the future (presumably after the Reapers are defeated).
    
    **Liara:** So, tell me what you want. If this all ends tomorrow, what happens to us?  
    **Shepard:** I don't know. Marriage, old age, and a lot of little blue children?
    
    -   Similarly, in the finale of _Mass Effect 3_, if Shepard romanced Garrus, one of the things he hopes for if they both survive is to see what a Turian-Human baby would look like. Considering that the two species are biologically incompatible, Shepard notes that they could always adopt.
    -   The Extended Cut shows (if the player cured the genophage) krogan babies.<small>◊</small>
-   The ending of _Mega Man Battle Network 6_ has a dialogue between Lan, Mayl, and their son Patch.
-   After the final battle in _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_, Raiden is recuperating from his injuries when Rose introduces him to their son, who had previously stated she miscarried. Turns out it was all a cover to protect the kid from the Patriots, who would've used them and their mother as leverage against the father.
-   In _Momoko 120%_, the ending cutscene shows a newborn baby hovering over Momoko and her bridegroom as they clasp hands and hearts float up.
-   Several female characters are pregnant or have already given birth by the ending of _Ōkami_. Later becomes Spin-Offspring with _Ōkamiden_.
-   _Pirates: Legend of the Black Buccaneer_ has two endings, the Good Ending which sees your character Francis Blade choosing to escape La Borge's Isle with your new Love Interest, Vanilla. You then made it back to Europe with untold amounts of wealth, and years later you're recounting your adventures to your son at dinnertime.
-   Though not necessarily in relation to the plotline, one of the remaining tasks post-game for _Pokémon_ is breeding competitively.
    -   A variant occurs in a post-game sidequest in _Pokémon Sun and Moon_. If you take your cover legendary (a.k.a. Nebby) back to the Altar of the Sunne/Moone at night/during the day (respectively), you'll discover a portal to an alternate world based on the other version's world. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  If you then take it to the Lake of the Sunne/Moone, there will be a cutscene where the other version's legendary briefly appears and...interacts with Nebby somehow to generate a fresh Cosmog, which will join your party. After everything Nebby went through in the main story, it's kinda heartwarming to not only let it achieve full power, but also have a kid.
-   Several mini-games in _Rhythm Heaven_ involve romance, so the ending screens for getting "Perfects" on them show baby versions of the "characters" from the original game. Up to and including baby Moai.
-   Noh is implied to be pregnant in her ending for _Sengoku Basara 2_, despite the fact that historically she never bore Oda Nobunaga any children.
-   Juno's ending in _Soul Nomad & the World Eaters_ has the Nereids taking advantage of the restored soul cycle to start having kids again, making it a huge baby boom. If the player character is male, Juno will then proposition him.
-   At the end of _Star Control II_, the now elderly player character recounts the tale of his adventure to his grandchildren.
-   One of the Multiple Endings of _Star Fox Command_ shows Fox and Krystal with their son and Slippy and his love interest, Amanda with their children. It's even shown that they eventually take over the command team.
-   One of the paired endings of _Star Ocean: The Second Story_ shows Claude having returned to Earth with Rena, with the latter mentioning that she's expecting a baby in about six months.
-   _Stella Glow_: In Hilda's ending, it's shown that she and Alto are expecting a baby. This ending is mutually exclusive with Lisette's, because Alto chooses _her_ as her wife.

-   Most of the main characters from part 1 of _Ennui GO!_ are starting families in part 2, with the women being visibly pregnant.

When the pregnancy is confirmed, Mari believes she wouldn't make a good mother because her own mother left her to be raised by her grandparents so she didn't learn to be a mother. At the very end, Mari gives birth to a daughter, and she promises that she will always be part of a loving family.
-   The _Lycosa_ storyline of _Nature of Nature's Art_ concludes partly with a human recycling the car from the junkyard where the story takes place, and partly with Lycosa adopting the eggsacs of the spiders she killed in the effort to reclaim her own (resulting in a literal mountain of babies).
-   The final panel of _Schlock Mercenary_ shows Tagon and Murtaugh's re-sleeved Brain Uploads (It Makes Sense in Context) with at least one child and one more on the way.
