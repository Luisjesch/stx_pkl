"Women want me, shirts fear me!"

**LaBarbara:** You can't argue with those luscious pecs!  
**Hermes:** No I can't. But I can ask him to stop wiggling them in my face!  
**Barbados Slim:** I'm not wigglin' them. They do that by themselves.

Where a male character's pectoral muscles jiggle and bounce, except that they flex them to make it happen. However, generally it is used not so much for Fanservice as it is used as an often comedic demonstration of "manliness". Other names for it are the "Pec Bounce", the "Pec Dance" (usually this name is used if people flex their pecs in time to music), and the "Pec Pop". A character with a Bodybuilding background would probably do this while hitting some variation of either a "side chest" or a "most muscular" pose, since those are the ones which most emphasize the pecs.

Another variant is the "Ab Wave", where a character with a well defined six pack will flex their stomach muscles like a wave. Generally, this isn't so much saying "look how strong I am" as it is "aren't I sexy?"

For cases of Pec Flex when the flexer has less-than-impressive pecs, see Flexing Those Non-Biceps.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?_, Naruzo Machio will do this whenever he hears a word that sounds like a muscle or a pose, flexing so hard that his track suit _explodes_ off of his body. His Bishōnen head, however, remains the same, making him look utterly ridiculous.
-   _Pokémon: The Series_:
    -   In "The Superhero Secret", the obese Gligarman's chest shakes in surprise. Homina homina--NO.
    -   _Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon_: In "A Mission of Ultra Urgency", the Ultra Beast Buzzwole shows off by flexing every last one of its muscles, pectorals included.

    -   He befriended Sig Curtis, Izumi's husband, through a flex-off.
        
        _"Valor a hundredfold~! Muscle a thousandfold~!"_
        
    -   Speaking of Curtis, his Pec Flex was so epic his shirt _exploded_.
    -   At one point in the 2003 anime Armstrong attempts to _flex loyal soldiers into joining a coup_. His argument, if it can be called that, is that his faintly ridiculous muscles **pulse with loyalty**.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_: Jack Rakan. At one point, he even uses it to completely shatter a Pocket Dimension.

-   _Bleach_: Ikkaku Madarame gets his shoulder dislocated in a fight. He immediately does a Pec Flex so epic it resets his shoulder.

-   _Mobile Fighter G Gundam_: Just doing this was enough for Colonel Ulube to deflect Chibodee's ultimate technique, the Bursting Machine-Gun Punch.
-   _Ayakashi Triangle_: As a literally inhuman embodiment of muscular strength, Masurao flexing his chest isn't only able to absorb Matsuri's punch, but launch him down the hallway. Like Armstrong, this also destroys Masurao's shirt.

    Fan Works 

-   _Dragon Ball Z Elsewhere_: King Cold challenges Olibu to a showdown, offering to surrender if he wins but enabling the villains trapped in Hell to go free if Cold wins.

All the other heroes and villains just watch in awkward silence except for Frieza, who's mortified when King Cold loses.

Then a comment by Crystal caused Mr. T to giggle for a moment, and as soon as he got a serious face back on, Crystal pointed out that his laugh caused his pecs to wiggle. Mr. T and Hogan lost it at that point.

-   Zangief did it in several iterations of _Street Fighter_, even the chibi-Zangief in Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix (or Pocket Fighter, depending on locale). And in _Street Fighter V_'s story mode, he breaks a _Psycho-powered sword in two_ just by doing this trope.
