A team of characters build something that will pull everyone's bacon out of the fire. A montage is used to show each person exercising their speciality (usually without lines) in the pursuit of this goal.

Named after The '80s series _The A-Team_, which had such montage Once per Episode. The true "A-Team Montage" will often include large quantities of Stock Footage. This can lead to humorous mistakes, such as an obvious set of black hands building the superweapon, even though Mr. T's character had been captured by bad guys.

The A-Team was also famous for the apparent genius-level DIY skills they employed during the montage; in a matter of a few minutes, the A-Team could turn six feet of PVC piping, a golf-cart, and several kilograms of semi-volatile chemicals into a heavily-armored tank. That their captors were routinely stupid enough to lock them in a warehouse _full_ of PVC piping, golf carts and semi-volatile chemicals is not relevant to the trope, though it is an example of extreme Genre Blindness.

Special case of the Hard-Work Montage, and similar to the Lock-and-Load Montage. Commonly used in The Caper or The Con, especially if it's an Impossible Mission.

    Film — Animation 

-   This is used in a way in the animated film _Once Upon a Forest_, when the three furlings come together and use teamwork to build a flying machine using Bamboo Technology.
-   _Big Hero 6_ has a montage showing each of the six team members exercising their new skills.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   In _From Dusk Till Dawn_, the remaining protagonists (Seth Gecko and Jacob, Scott, and Kate Fuller) perform an A-Team Montage when they jury rig a number of weapons against the vampires besieging them as they are hiding in a storage room of a biker bar.
-   The remake of _Dawn of the Dead (2004)_ features one of these as the heroes retrofit some parking shuttles, preparing to break through the zombie army that has besieged their shopping mall.
-   Every one of the new _Ocean's Eleven_ trilogy. Interestingly, we usually end up seeing that what they were building was merely a cover for the real con.
-   _Tremors 3: Back to Perfection_ features one, with characters building weapons off what they find in a junkyard.
-   _Evil Dead_:
    -   Ash has a one-man version in _Evil Dead 2_, single-handedly refitting a chainsaw to replace his severed appendage.
    -   _Army of Darkness_ plays it straight, as the blacksmith and various other medieval screw-heads assist with the construction of a replacement gauntlet/hand and conversion of his beat-up Oldsmobile into a crazy war machine.
-   In _Fair Game_, a montage is used to show Jessica working through the night to booby-trap the farm before the hunters arrive in the morning. We are not shown how the traps work until they are activated, however.
-   _Napoleon Dynamite_ has a Shout-Out montage which uses the actual A-Team theme song while Napoleon and Pedro are putting up flyers for the student election.

    Live-Action TV 

-   A contemporary of _The A-Team,_ _MacGyver (1985)_ also featured a similar montage towards the end of each show.
-   The _CSI_ shows employ this trope frequently, as the various forensic specialists build a case.
    -   _CSI: NY's_ episode 9.04, "Unspoken," does this for the first 20 minutes or so.
-   _Mission: Impossible_ often featured sequences where characters worked on a project without dialogue, but this was never done as montage.
-   Seen often in _Top Gear (UK)_, although the presenters being what they are to each other, it seldom goes smoothly.
    -   Lampshaded in the Vietnam special, where James May actually hums the theme to _The A-Team_ during the A-Team Montage of the presenters modifying their motorbikes into watercraft.
    -   In the Reliant Robin review, Clarkson "cues the music", only for it to stop suddenly when he drives the front wheel straight into the inspection pit of the garage.
    -   Played with when building a car for the elderly. The montage is there as usual, but it gets a much more sedate and classical version of the music to match.
-   _MythBusters_ frequently has these, due to the show being only an hour long and some of the builds taking many man-hours to complete. Occasionally, the A-Team may even be referenced.
-   In the working script for the _Firefly_ episode "Heart of Gold," the scene where Mal and his scrappy crew prepare their _literal_ Army of Thieves and Whores is described with "A-Team-style 'getting shit done' music plays under this."
-   The pilot episode of _The IT Crowd_ uses this - with the A-Team music included as a Brick Joke since Denholm had mentioned the A-Team earlier when telling the IT Department how much he loved teams.

    Video Games 

-   _Mass Effect 2_ features something like this in its finale. First each of the 3 main ship upgrades are shown doing their job in various ways to protect the crew getting to the enemy base, if you missed one then it won't fulfill its role. Then throughout the final mission you're given the chance to pick different people to perform different jobs and treated to a cutscene of them either performing it perfectly or messing up and letting someone die. The best ending is a picture perfect montage interspersed with gameplay, showing each of the chosen teammembers doing what they do best to keep everyone alive.

    Web Animation 

-   _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Summertime Shorts_: "Get the Show on the Road" has some aspects of this trope when the Rainbooms work on the derelict bus, notably each of them using their respective powers to fix it, and numerous close-ups on the reparation, along with Split Screen. And they provide their own song with the montage, too.

    Western Animation 

-   _Looney Tunes_ and _Merrie Melodies_: "Tired and Feathered," a Wile E Coyote And The Roadrunner cartoon from 1965 whose major gag – a phony bird sanctuary with a rigged pay telephone – begins with the Coyote building said structure; a montage of the Coyote at work is shown before cutting to a scene of the Coyote admiring his completed work ... until he hears the phone ring for real! You know what happens next.
-   In _The Tick_ a group of brilliant inventors from different eras (and Mona Lisa), who were all kidnapped and imprisoned by a villain, managed to do this with what they had in their cell, turning it into mobile vehlice armed with several kinds of weapons.
-   The _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ episode "One Bad Apple" features the Cutie Mark Crusaders putting together a parade float as part of a Batman Gambit to deal with a bully. The sequence even features a Suspiciously Similar Song to _The A-Team_ theme.
-   _Drawn Together_ has two, first when they're modifying Foxxy's van for an assault (then they immediately crash it into a tree), then when they're making a completely unnecessary ad-hoc escape vehicle to get out of their van when they're trapped in a parking lot.
-   _Sonic Boom_: In "Closed Door Policy", during a yard sale at Sticks' burrow, Amy accidentally takes a surfboard holding back the entrance to the underground lair of the Froglodytes, a race of frog-like warriors. Although Team Sonic attempt to hold them back, the Frog Men nonetheless kidnap Sticks, prompting the rest of the team to initiate a rescue operation, gathering up the possessions from the yard sale so they can be used as weapons. Said montage is complimented by generic but fitting music.
-   _South Park_: "Night of the Living Homeless" had one of these depicting the boys modifying a bus so they could use it to deal with the homeless epidemic. By singing a song telling them that California is the best state for homeless people, just like what all the other states did.
-   _Centaurworld_: In "My Tummy, Your Hurts" the herd is crushing ice to separate themselves from the coldtaurs, with each character utilizing their strengths - Durpleton is seen hammering ice with his head, and Wammawink uses her knitting needles. The scene is even set to a tune similar to The A-Team theme.
