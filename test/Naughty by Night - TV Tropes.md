Geek in the streets, freak in the sheets.

_"You know her by day  
But you don't know Karen by night."_

Alice is a librarian. During the day, she wears long skirts, a loose blouse done all the way up to her neck, her hair in a bun and sensible shoes.

Get Alice home to her significant other, however, and well — the blouse is going to be on the floor, the skirt in the hall, her hair all over the place... and the rest is too NSFW even to describe. As strait-laced as Alice may be in public, none of that carries over into her private life — and vice versa.

A Sub-Trope of Living a Double Life.

Compare Seemingly-Wholesome '50s Girl and Covert Pervert. Contrast Aggressive Submissive.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In a way Nyamo-sensei of _Azumanga Daioh_. While she's generally straight-laced and down-to-earth in contrast to Yukari, the one who you'd expect to have a wild social life, Yukari makes a comment about her Nyamo "not being alone" in a previous summer, and Relaxo Vision or not, the hilarious incident where she gets drunk and gives The Talk implies she's fairly experienced.
-   _Code Geass_: Nina Einstein and the infamous table scene. Nunnally actually _wheeled in on this_, but fortunately she was blind already and (hopefully) too young to properly..._interpret_ any sounds she might have heard.
-   In the manga _Crimson Spell_ the protagonist Valdrigr is under a curse that causes him to turn into a rampaging demon. The trope kicks in when the Halvir, wizard Vald has recruited to help break the curse, decides that the best method of quelling the demon's rampages is to have sex with him - after the first few instances, it becomes clear that demon-Vald is increasingly less interested in violence and more interested in getting it on with Havi.
-   In the ecchi manga _My Balls_, the main character's primary love interest Minayo is a sweet, kindly young woman who works at a daycare center. When she gets drunk, however, she goes into what the protagonist describes as "full-blown nympho mode". Unfortunately, said protagonist can't have sex for a month or the demon sealed inside his balls (hence the name of the manga) will be released and cause The End of the World as We Know It. Minayo happens to be an alcoholic, and Hilarity Ensues.
-   _Paprika_: Straight-laced Chiba becomes a lot more flirty and extroverted when she turns into Paprika.
-   _Paranoia Agent_ has an episode that plays with this. Harumi Chono is a quiet, conservative, mild-mannered school teacher by day, but at night her other personality takes over—Maria, a popular prostitute. When Harumi gets engaged, she starts trying to desperately get rid of Maria before her wedding day, which causes Maria to fight back.
-   _Sprite: Between Two Worlds_, wherein Manami, a severely repressed and meek college student turns into Nami, an outrageously uninhibited flirt whenever she's put into any situation that is too much for her to handle. The catalyst is her cousin Toru, who convinced Manami to be more confident around him when they were young by convincing her she was really Nami.
-   A Hentai Manga take on this: _WereSlut_ (unfortunate name created from whole cloth by Eros Comix, the US distributor) is about a shy college student named Kimiko who takes a magic beauty pill to make her attractive enough to win her childhood friend (read: she takes off her glasses). It works, but, due to the magic pill being past its expiration date, it keeps kicking in whenever she gets aroused. After the first time, though, it also kills all her inhibitions.

    Comedy 

-   The Firesign Theatre's "Forward Into the Past" sketch, which parodies old-time radio, announces a show called "Captain Equinox". The main character is described this way:
    
    By day, Adolf Tree, a mild-mannered college professor!
    
    By night, Kiki, a mini-skirted habitué of Hollywood's starstruck Sunset Strip!
    
    But twice a year he's...CAPTAIN EQUINOX!
    

    Comic Books 

-   Aurora was like this in _Alpha Flight_'s early years, exaggerated by her Split Personality. One persona was Jeannie-Marie: strict, stuffy schoolmarm teaching at the same girls' school she was raised in. And then there was _Aurora_: sultry, adventure-loving, free-spirited partier.
-   While it never came up in the comics, writer Mark Waid's character notes for the _Fantastic Four_ speculate Susan Storm was like this as a young woman to cope with the stress of having to raise her little brother.
-   In _Quantum and Woody_, Amy Fishbein appears to be a prim and proper white-collar professional, but she starts dropping Anvilicious innuendos and undressing herself as soon as she's alone with Woody.

    Fan Works 

-   More than one _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fanfic has portrayed Fluttershy like this.
-   Celestia, Luna, and Cadance all show this to varying degrees in _Diaries of a Madman_.
-   In _A Pikachu in Love_, Pikachu is worried that this is what Ash and Co. will think if they catch him sneaking off at night to meet Pichi, and doesn't want them drilling him for questions on the matter. That still doesn't stop Misty from finding out, though she doesn't press the matter and keeps it a secret from the others even after the ending.
-   Rapunzel in _The Secret Life of Punzie_ started committing minor acts of rebellion in-secret due to being sick of being the A+ good girl, starting with getting a tattoo. Eventually it culminated in Rapunzel becoming the star dancer in a lesbian strip-club.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   The title character of the Sexploitation film _Angel (1984)_ and its sequels in _The Angel Trilogy_. The tagline for the original movie was "High School Honor Student By Day. Hollywood Hooker By Night".
-   The movie _Belle de Jour_ is about a seemingly average housewife who's a prostitute in secret. But here this trope is inverted: as she is a housewife, she can actually do this job only _by day_ instead of by night. (This is where the name of the film comes from.)
-   Somewhat subverted in the film _Blind Date_ where Walter's sister-in-law tells him not to let the date get drunk as she goes wild. This information is relayed to him via his brother who adds lots of leering to the information. Cue the man getting his date, Nadia, drunk, to find that she goes wild in a drunk-driving, crash-the-car, ruin-the-evening way.
-   This is a source of some confusion in the film _Desperately Seeking Susan_.
-   _Flashdance_: Zigzagged. Alex spends her days visiting a retired ballerina and working as a welder while dancing at a cabaret at night in font of a lusty male audience and the same is implied to be true for her friends. However, the girls seem to focus more on the art of the dancing than the sleazier parts, and it's technically a second aspect of their professional lives.
-   In _Guilty of Romance_, Mitsuko is a professor at a university during the day and a prostitute by night.
-   _Jawbreaker_: The lie Courtney wants to use to explain how Liz was murdered was that she was killed by one of her many lovers, who just got a little too rough one night. Since School Idol Liz's reputation was spotless, Julie says no one is going to believe it. Courtney argues that is precisely the reason why.
    
    **Courtney**: They'll believe it, because it's their worst nightmare. Elizabeth Purr, the very picture of teenage perfection, obliterated by perversion?
    
-   _Looking For Mr Goodbar_ is a very dark example. Diane Keaton plays a teacher of deaf children from a conservative Irish-Catholic upbringing who starts out having an affair with a married college professor, then starts cruising seedy bars for one-night stands that grow progressively more degrading and dangerous, culminating in her getting raped, beaten, and stabbed to death by a troubled Vietnam vet.
-   _Lost Girls and Love Hotels_: Margaret is just an ordinary English teacher during the day. During the night, she's getting drunk or having sex in love hotels with men.
-   _My Super Ex-Girlfriend_: Vaughn thinks Jenny is this on first seeing her, saying that though she looks like a librarian on the outside, inside there's a wild side. He's more right than he knows. As her Super Hero alter ego G-Girl, she's revealed to be a very enthusiastic lover she accidentally injures Matt and destroys his bed with her Super-Strength.
-   In _Sideways_, former soap star Jack woos a fawning, plus-sized waitress while at dinner, who comes across as Adorkable meeting a celebrity crush. It turns out she has a quite freaky side, not only engaging in anal sex with Jack hours after meeting him, she and her husband then have a long, wild sex session over her husband catching her and Jack in the act.
-   _Slumberland_: The scantily-clad salsa dancer Flip dances with is, in the real world, a nun who's having these dreams while she'd fallen asleep while praying inside a church.
-   The red-headed librarian from _Tomcats_ looks like a plain, uptight young lady. She (and her grandma!) are also into S&M.

    Literature 

-   A relatively tame version occurs in _Good Omens_. Sweet little old lady and part-time medium Madame Tracy also offers appointments for "strict discipline and intimate massage every evening except Thursdays", and there are hints that she goes a little further than that on Thursdays.
-   Erika Kohut in _The Piano Teacher_ by Elfriede Jelinek is a very unhappy example. Her oppressive mother has totally managed to suppress her natural sexuality, so she tries to make up for it by secretly and obsessively pursuing weird, unhealthy perversions, though she can still barely feel anything. When she gets into an affair with her student, he soon gets freaked out by her tastes.
-   In _Saving Zoë_, Teresa is a pretty preppy girl who acts and sings. By night, she hangs out with drug dealers and porno producers. The same could be said about Zoe, who seems like a perfect bubbly girl but smokes drugs and has sex when her parents don't know. This tendency leads to Zoe's death.
-   The essence of _The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_. Jekyll is an upstanding citizen by day, but he becomes Mister Hyde by night in order to live out his immoral, sadistic fantasies without being recognized.
-   The _Torchwood_ novel _SkyPoint_ takes this to extremes; a very prim and proper little old lady, who is actually an S&M prostitute.
-   Almost every Cairheinan noblewoman in _The Wheel of Time_ is heavily implied to fit this trope. Though during some festivals they will run around almost nude on the streets, especially during the Feast of Light (during which normal prohibitions against inter-class kissing (and other things) are lifted), leading to a large number of commoners having bragging contests about who made out with the most important noblewoman.
    -   ONLY during the Feast of Lights, after which any such incident is ignored by all parties. With Cairhien being partially based on Versailles France, this roughly corresponds to Mardi Gras.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Angel_ (or rather, his evil side Angelus) hints that cute geek girl Fred is like this.
    
    "Ah, Fred. You look all fresh and sweet, but I hear you at night in your room with Gunn. The things you say. I'm lying there, listening, hands under the covers... I can't help myself. It's so... gripping.
    
-   _The Murders_: Kate is a reserved and professional detective who it turns out often has BDSM sex with Pete when off duty.
-   The Victim of the Week in the _Murdoch Mysteries_ two-parter "Stroll on the Wild Side" is a quiet librarian, but the autopsy reveals she has a rose tattoo on her ankle, which is not something a respectable woman in 1900s Toronto would be expected to have. It turns out she's been picking up men in a seedy tavern, apparently just to add some excitement to her life.
-   _On the Buses_ long-suffering Olive would love to be Naughty By Night, but her miserable husband Arthur would rather sleep. Actually, he'd probably rather do his taxes...
-   Subverted on _Person of Interest_ where a PoI is a dedicated workaholic doctor but seems to spend her nights going to night clubs and picking up men. However, a more detailed investigation reveals that she is actually stalking the man who raped her sister and caused the sister to commit suicide. The doctor is simply building up her resolve to murder the man.
-   _Reno 911!_. Deputy Weigel and her boyfriend Craig both appear to be socially-awkward nerds, but what we see of their sex life is quite... adventurous. Subverted in that Craig turns out to be a serial killer.
-   Sheila from _Shameless (US)_. By day she's a sweet agoraphobic and germaphobic housewife. But at night she is very very into pegging filthy alcoholic Frank.
-   Effy from _Skins_: innocent schoolgirl by day, Fille Fatale by night.
-   _Twin Peaks_ — Laura Palmer is a normal high school girl by day, but a prostitute at night, among other things. Or, as she says in The Movie, "Night time is my time."
-   _The Umbrella Academy_: Sloane's very sweet and slightly shy in public. While with Luther though she has no compunction about having sex with him on the ceiling by use of her gravity powers.

    Music 

-   The Good Charlotte song _Like it's her Birthday_ has this as the main theme — the Protagonist thinks his Girlfriend's cheating on him when she lies about where she's going, so he follows her and...
    
    _"Tonight I kinda get the feeling my girl is up to something  
    Something that is no good  
    She said she only had a meeting but she is dressed for something  
    Something that is no good  
    Now I'm not saying that she's cheating, but seeing is believing.  
    Can't believe it, what I'm seeing when I stepped inside."_
    
-   Halestorm: The song "Mz Hyde" is all about how the singer revels in this trope.
    
    _In the daylight_  
    _I'm your sweetheart_  
    _Your goody-two-shoes prude is a work of art_  
    _But you don't know me_  
    _And soon you won't forget_  
    _Bad as can be, yeah you know I'm not so innocent._
    
-   "Gangnam Style" by PSY describes this as the singer's ideal girl. The translated lyrics:
    
    _A girl who is warm and humanly by day_  
    _A classy girl who knows how to enjoy the freedom of a cup of coffee_  
    _A girl whose heart gets hotter when night comes_  
    _A girl with that kind of twist_
    
-   The viewpoint character of Amy Rigby's "Wait Til I Get You Home" is shy — but she knows what she wants:
    
    _You make me so happy  
    But there's all these people around  
    So wait til I get you home  
    And the walls come down..._
    
-   Usher's song "Yeah!" includes the assertion "We want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed".

    Radio 

-   Variation: after a discussion about horses with traffic reporter Bobbie Prior, BBC Radio 2 DJ Sara Cox (then 45) said "Responsible adult women by day, squealing pony girls by night."

    Theatre 

-   The song "Miss Byrd" from _Closer Than Ever_ is about a secretary exulting in how no one who sees her would think that she's anything but "that dull Miss Byrd," yet she has secret trysts with her superintendent.
-   Fantine in _Les Misérables_ is fired from her factory job when she is discovered to have a child, and her fellow workers claim that she is a prostitute. However, she had only ever had one lover, who had abandoned her, and it is only after she is fired that she has to become a prostitute.
-   The play _Miss Julie_ fits this with regard to personality, but replace "librarian" with "aristocrat".
-   Parodied in _The Music Man_: The town gossips manage to convince the Professor that Marian the Librarian is Naughty By Night primarily because she reads "racy" books by "Chaucer...Rabelais...Balzac" and was kind enough to befriend the town outcast. She's not, but he falls in love with her anyway.

    Video Games 

-   Possibly Litchi from _BlazBlue_. Despite her incredibly skimpy battle clothes, her personality is fairly conservative. However, supplement materials and a couple of gag endings say that when she gets drunk she gets rather...insistent.
-   _Jet Force Gemini_: Running a mine in Rith Essa with his brothers isn't the only job Fishface has, it's only the one he has _publicly_. Later in the game, he can be found working as an emcee in Ichor's exclusive Big Bug Fun Club, where Juno and Vela can talk to him to request a song from a selected list.
-   _Leisure Suit Larry 7: Love for Sail!_ got this one, cranked up to 20, with Hot Librarian Victorian Principles.
-   _You Don't Know Jack_ Movies parodied this one for one of the Question 18 segues:
    
    Question 18: Honor student by day... _stripper by night!_
    
-   Nekoko from _Yume Miru Kusuri_ though this is more of drug effect.

    Visual Novels 

-   Veronica from _Daughter for Dessert_ is a respectable businesswoman by day, but sometimes, she is willing to get sexual in a dark alley with a guy she just met.
-   _Double Homework_:
    -   Ms. Walsh is prim and proper in the classroom, but she is seen dancing sensually at nightclubs, and has cybersex with strangers on the internet.
    -   Lampshaded regarding Johanna and Tamara by Tamara herself:
        
        **Tamara**: You’re a freak. I’m a freak. Johanna’s a freak.
        

    Web Original 

-   CollegeHumor: In "The Six Girls You'll Date in College", there's 'The One Who Goes to Church', who's easily impressed by the Nice Guy Audience Surrogate, and (with her modest attire and seemingly naive nature) seems out of place at the frat party where she meets him, but in the bedroom, she is _not_ the naive virgin she appears to be, and is apparently heavily into bondage.

    Western Animation 

-   In _Futurama_, a prim bureaucrat is utterly turned on after hours by Fry's horrifyingly slobby lifestyle.
