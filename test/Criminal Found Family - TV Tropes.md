_"Accomplices, associates, and family. From now on, that is what we will be."_

Societal outcasts are often drawn to a Family of Choice: rejected by society and likely their own blood family, they have to make a family of their own. And by nature of defying their society's laws, criminals are generally outcasts. So when criminals join together with a common (illegal) purpose?

A found family is born.

The criminal activities underscore the violation of societal expectations universal with a Family of Choice, but also indicate a distaste for society: these are people who don't fit in and no longer try. The more heroic ones often want to change society for the better and find a place in it, but just as many want to burn the whole thing down.

Because of this, Criminal Found Families tend to be villains or antiheroes rather than traditional hero types. They're also more likely to start the narrative already a team. While heroes spend the story building their bonds and becoming Fire-Forged Friends, a shared criminal goal before any Call to Adventure is often just as good.

Many queer-coded villains can be found in one of these since the Family of Choice is often associated with queer culture and criminals with villainy. The popularity of the found family trope, however, is likely to cast them sympathetically or at least in a way that appeals to the audience.

There is a fair amount of Truth in Television here: young teenagers who fall into gangs often do so looking for community support, even though it's likely to negatively affect them in the long run.

A subtrope of Family of Choice.

This trope is not necessarily The Family such as The Mafia or another crime syndicate trope, although it _can_ be. It's more likely to overlap with Even Evil Has Loved Ones, Even Evil Can Be Loved, Ragtag Bunch of Misfits, and Villainous Friendship.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Banana Fish_: Most of the gangs (especially Ash's) fit into found family dynamics of young teenage boys finding comfort and companionship in each other despite their violent, criminal lifestyles (some Truth in Television), which is a homey contrast to the high-class but emotionally cold higher-ups in the Corsican mafia and Yut-Lung's organization.
-   _Bungo Stray Dogs_: When Chuuya finally gets information on his biological family in order to seek them out and meet them, he elects not to and decides the Port Mafia is where his true family is. He loathes anyone who hurts his subordinates.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_: Greed and his gang of chimeras are a tight-knit group who look out for each other and are fully willing to die for each other. In _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_, Marta outright says they're the closest thing she has to a family.
-   _Great Pretender_: While the official motto of the confidence team defies the idea that they're friends or family and they all insist they'd leave each other behind in an instant, this never actually happens. They all go to great lengths to help each other out, not only when they're in danger because of their con, but to deal with their past trauma before they'd even joined the team.
-   _Hunter × Hunter_: The Phantom Troupe was founded in Meteor City, a place where everyone abandons things they don't want—including people. They chose to join up and work together as one piece of a greater group of thieves that is more important than any of the individual members, but that doesn't mean they didn't slip into prioritizing each other fiercely, especially the founding members.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind_: Team Bucciarati consists of several gangsters from the Passione syndicate, an expansive empire with influences all over Italy and the Mediterranean. The members all have consistently Dark And Troubled Pasts where they've been wronged by the people and systems in their lives. This ranges from Narancia being betrayed by his childhood friends to Abbacchio's betrayal by his time in the corrupt and ineffective police force. The gang all have a deep trust and respect for each other, and their ultimate goal is to take over Passione and turn it into a force of good for the people of Italy.
-   _Magical Record Lyrical Nanoha Force_: The Hückebein and the Grendel "families" are tightly-knit groups of otherwise unrelated Eclipse Drivers who banded around a parental figure (Curren Hückebein and Kurt Grendel, respectively) to escape prosecution for their crimes (mostly armed robbery and terrorism).
-   _Michiko & Hatchin_: The title characters find family in each other after Michiko breaks out of prison and technically kidnaps Hatchin from her abusive foster family and they end up on the run trying to find Hatchin's biological father, before finding each other again in an epilogue and coming together as family does.
-   _Moriarty the Patriot_: Moriarty's crew all views each other as family, most of them live together, and they share strong bonds of mutual affection and Undying Loyalty. Except for William and Louis, none of them share any blood ties, but even Albert chose them specifically to adopt into his legal family. They work together under the moniker "The Lord of Crime," hoping to improve society. While they eventually give up their criminal ways and start atoning for their crimes, they stay together and continue to work together even while trying to make up for their sins.
-   _My Hero Academia_:
    -   The League of Villains grows into one after a rough start. They all follow Shigaraki, or at least ally with him, because of shared goals against society, and after a few arcs, they start taking revenge when one of them gets hurt, and Shigaraki, a formerly abandoned kid with a lot of trauma issues, decides they are his True Companions.
    -   Downplayed with La Brava and Gentle. They were both misfits shunned by society who joined forces to commit crimes, but these crimes are often insanely petty and mostly done for the sake of notoriety. They also love each other more than anything, to the point where it allows the activation of La Brava's Quirk...which is quite literally The Power of Love. When Izuku takes down Gentle, La Brava even starts hitting him, crying, and begging him to leave Gentle alone.
-   _One Piece_:
    -   While the Straw Hat Pirates tend not to commit many of the crimes associated with pirates, they _are_ still criminals with a massive collective bounty on their heads. One of the recurring themes of the series is how much they all love each other, how well they work together, and the lengths they would go to for each other.
    -   Whitebeard views all of his men as his adopted sons, and they all look up to him as a father. The bond of family is strong enough that the Whitebeard pirates go to war with the Navy when they plan to execute Ace.
        
        **Whitebeard:** I don't care who your father was. We're all children of the sea!
        
    -   Luffy spent most of his childhood as a foster child of Dadan's mountain bandits, alongside Ace and later Sabo. The three boys, each outcast from society whether by heritage or choice, became brothers by choice and were adored by the bandits.
-   _Pokémon: The Series_: Team Rocket (the Jessie/James/Meowth trio, anyway) are all misfits _even among their syndicate_. Even Giovanni doesn't have much time for any of them. But for all they bicker, they have found true companionship with each other.
-   _Tokyo Revengers_: While Izana defies the idea that the Tenjiku founding members are friends and insists that the only things uniting them are fear and self-interest, they still demonstrate remarkable solidarity and some level of attachment to each other. Several of them are also confirmed or hinted to have a poor home life, and given Izana's initial childhood aspirations for Tenjiku, this likely extends to all of them.
    
    **Izana**: We'll make everyone who has no family our citizens and give them a place to call home.
    

    Fanworks 

-   _The Delinquent Cooper_: In addition to the Cooper Gang, the Neo Cooper Gang also comes into focus, consisting of a universe displaced Duncan, his pet cyborg spider Scruffy, Hunter the Wolf, Maverick the Raven-Griffin and Buck the Weasel.

    Films — Animation 

-   _The Bad Guys (2022)_: The titular gang is a Caper Crew of predatory animals who were cast out of society for being seen as dangerous, and so became the villains people saw them as and bonded with each other through their shared hurt. They're structured like a family unit: Mr. Wolf and Mr. Snake are the parents, Ms. Tarantula is the eldest child, Mr. Shark is the middle child, and Mr. Piranha is the youngest. That said, the movie itself shows how this trope can cause problems: Mr. Wolf wanting to go straight is treated as a rejection by Mr. Snake, and the rest of the family leaves him for it. However, they eventually decide to go straight with him.
-   _Puss in Boots: The Last Wish_: Goldilocks and the Three Bears are depicted in this film as a quartet of London Gangster\-like criminals, Goldi being taken in by the Bears after she broke into their house and growing up to be the brains of the outfit. Although they argue a lot, they turn out to love each other as a family, to the point where Goldi gives up her chance to claim the Wishing Star (which she'd been planning to use to find a human family, due to her initially not feeling comfortable with her status as the Bears' Black Sheep) and rescue Baby Bear instead.

-   _Gotham_:
    -   The young Ivy _tries_ to form one of these with Penguin, Mr. Freeze, and Firefly in late season 3, outright calling them "a family of freaks," but unfortunately, these various characters prove too different and too selfish to ally for long outside of temporary mutual need.
