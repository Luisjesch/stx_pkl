_"If ever you're not satisfied with one of our tires, please feel free to bring it back.  
\[old woman throws tire through window\]  
Thank you."_

A Comedy Trope. There are few visual images that better convey a character's explosive anger with an alarm clock, videogame, phone call or TV set than said character hurling said object through a closed window. Crash!

Said action is most always viewed from the outside, only indirectly showing the violent pitch or punt that launches the object. It's funnier that way, especially if the appliance is illogically heavy. (See Offscreen Crash.)

While it usually applies to household appliances, other objects can also be featured, as long as someone is propelling them through the window.

Doesn't count if the character's main intention was to break the window; the focus of the destruction must be on the object.

Keep in note that throwing broken appliances like TV, video game consoles, laptops, etc out of the window in Real Life may cause injury or death to bystanders and pedestrians or damage vehicles below (along with broken shards of glass that follow); and the thrower of said appliance may be held legally accountable for any injuries and damages because of said thrown appliance. So Don't Try This at Home if you have a broken appliance.

Can be a form of Percussive Therapy and/or Percussive Shutdown in some cases.

Clark pulls the same trick again by throwing an artifact that Phelan touched and got his fingerprints on out the window, then speeding away and leaving him to the guards that were alerted by the commotion.

    -   According to their road manager, Keith was very fond of throwing TV's out the window, and he would bring long extension cords on the road so, when he threw the TV out the window, it would keep playing up until the moment it hit the ground.
    -   Keith Moon probably could have been the Trope Maker for this category. His destruction of hotel rooms was legendary. Supposedly, one hotel the Who was staying in was undergoing renovations, so they put the band in the area to be renovated and told him to do whatever he wanted to.

-   Such an occurence caused an accidental off-screen death (e.g. an old lady happened to be under the window) in _Noob_. Let's just say that Hair-Trigger Temper and incompetent guildmates don't mix well.
-   _Scott The Woz_:
    -   The first episode opens with a Wii U flying out the window.
    -   62 episodes later, in "Nintendo Before Video Games", Scott parted ways with an inflatable gator he bought by similar means, although the gator (or at least the box it came in) is on his desk in all episodes since.
