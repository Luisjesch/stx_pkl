_"You know, when you twirl your gun like that, you kinda look like a dick."_

— _Forum Roleplay, **IC**._

A character spins a gun around their finger by the trigger guard. This breaks pretty much every rule of gun safety at once, but at least it looks cool. A frequent comedy variation is for a gunslinger to do this successfully, and then have some hapless sap try it, only for something to go wrong.

This trope, like several other Guns and Gunplay Tropes, originated in Westerns. It was possible to do this _relatively_ safely with the gun commonly used in the period — the single-action revolver — because it takes _two_ actions to fire it: first cock the hammer, then pull the trigger. Also, it was common for the revolver to be carried with an empty chamber in front of the hammer to reduce the chance of accidental discharge; most "six-shooters" thus held only five bullets. Even so, accidentally dropping the gun while twirling it could result in it landing on the hammer, and if a live round was in position, it would fire.

With double-action revolvers, pulling the trigger first cocks the hammer and then releases it, so twirling a revolver around by the trigger is a great way to fire it in some random direction, such as at yourself, or the person standing next to you. Even if you get lucky and don't hit anything important, the recoil will probably break your finger.

With the earliest revolvers, this actually had a practical purpose: primitive cartridges tended to leave "fouling" (powder residue, pieces of the casing, etc.) in the barrel and firing chamber. Spinning helped shake them loose so they wouldn't accumulate and jam the weapon; but with any gun made after the mid-1800s, this is completely unnecessary.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Justice from _Afro Samurai_ does this before holstering one of his revolvers, which apparently results in a Diagonal Cut Off with His Head! for Afro's father. He used a sword wielded by his hidden third arm, but we don't learn that till later.
-   _Bakuretsu Tenshi_ has a Humongous Mecha doing this with pistol-shaped cannons.
-   Spike Spiegel does this at times in _Cowboy Bebop_.
-   Braham of _One Piece_ seemed fond of doing this whenever he had an excuse to do so.
-   Mami Tomoe of _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_ does this in episode 3 of the anime.
-   _Soul Eater_:
    -   Death the Kid does this in the anime's third ending. He also holds AND fires his twin guns _upside-down_... with his PINKIES.
    -   In the spinoff/prequel _Soul Eater Not!_ we see Liz gun-twirling as well. Like the Kid's tonfa grip, it's probably safe enough when the gun is a sentient being that won't fire when you don't want it to (and whose shots can be "pulled").
-   It's a favorite skill of Vash the Stampede in _Trigun_, despite the monumental size (and possibly weight) of the gun in question.
-   Sumire does this once in an early episode of _Venus Versus Virus_. Naturally, she drops the gun.
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds_: Yusei does this with a revolver-shaped duel disk. It happened during a western-themed filler arc.

    Comic Books 

-   _The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck_:
    -   Scrooge twirls _two guns_ at once, before aiming and shooting on the spot.
    -   When Scrooge happens upon Wyatt Earp in Alaska, the famous gunslinger introduces himself by twirling his gun. Scrooge responds by doing the same thing with his #1 Dime, causing Earp to lose his cool as he realizes just _who_ he tried to impress.
-   _Lucky Luke_:
    -   In one album, one guy tries this — and shoots himself in the hand.
    -   In the album _The Klondike_, Soapy Smith has the habit of doing this. One gag involves Smith trying to shoot a Mountie only for Luke to shoot his gun, causing it to start twirling. This gives an habit for Luke and Waldo to make their enemies twirl their guns at gunpoint. Especially Smith, whose finger eventually swells up to the point of making him unable to shoot.
-   _Vengeance_ features rookie hero and Young Gun the Ultimate Nullifier, who wields dual hip-holstered pistols that temporarily depower anyone hit by their bullets. He likes to spin them when he's bored, when he's trying to make a point, or when he just wants to look cool.

    Fan Works 

-   In _The Dark Knight Trilogy_ fanfiction _The Sword of Damocles,_ The Joker does this after shooting a mob boss for no other reason than to look cool.
-   In _Harry Potter And The Deathly Weapons_, after Hermione shoots and kills Neville Longbottom, she twirls her revolver before holstering it. For a fan edit revolving entirely around firearms in Harry Potter, this is the only instance of someone twirling their gun.

    Film — Animation 

-   Helga actually does this in _Atlantis: The Lost Empire_ just right before the submarine gets attacked by the Leviathan.
-   _An American Tail: Fievel Goes West_: Tiger twirls his slingshot during the Training Montage.
-   _Tangled_: Rapunzel briefly twirls her frying pan at one point, but then smacks herself in the temple with it by mistake.
-   _Wall E_: EVE twirls her Arm Cannon before "holstering" it the first time she fires at poor WALL•E (and never does it again for the rest of the movie).

    Film — Live-Action 

-   Jango Fett does this before holstering his blaster in _Attack of the Clones_. He even mimes blowing smoke away from the barrel. Given that he was wearing a (face-obscuring) helmet at the time, he probably did just to look cool.
-   Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen from _Back to the Future Part III_ enjoys this little bit of showboating before his climatic Showdown at Eight O'Clock with Clint Eastwood, twirling his revolver forward, then twirling it back to smoothly replace it in its holster.
-   Hector, one of Reno Smith's thugs, does this in attempt to intimidate Macreedy in _Bad Day at Black Rock_.
-   In _The Black Hole_, Captain S.T.A.R. twirls his twin laser guns after beating Old B.O.B. at target shooting. However the android has to cheat to win, so it's a sign of boastful bravado rather than competence. V.I.N.CENT. one-ups him by spinning his entire body while still hitting the target, causing S.T.A.R. to blow a fuse.
-   Done by Clint Eastwood at the end of the _Dirty Harry_ film _The Dead Pool_ as an Actor Allusion.
-   _Django Unchained_ has the title character do it a couple of times when he holsters his gun during practice. He never does it while actually drawing it, but since he only fires off one shot at a time (he's practising his quick draw) the gun should still be loaded, making it a pretty bad idea. However, Django is described in-universe as having "a flair for the dramatic", and since the film uses, deconstructs or parodies so many classic Western tropes, this one could hardly _not_ be used at some point.
-   _Dollars Trilogy_: The Man With No Name does this every time he holsters his weapon.
-   Holland gives an impressive display of this to the young boy Moses at the start of _Draw!_. He then immediately undercuts this by telling Moses that it is a completely useless skill that any man with a finger can master. He does it again to holster his gun after the final showdown before collapsing as part of his Faking the Dead act.
-   Starting with _Evil Dead 2_, Ashley Williams adopts a habit of spinning his sawed-off double-barreled shotgun on his finger before holstering it on his back.
-   On occasion in _Gang of Roses_, both Rachel and Zhang Li twirl their pistols as they are returning them to their holsters. They never do it when drawing, however.
-   Played with in _Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai_. Ghost Dog has an... interesting way of putting away his guns. He is actually doing a version of the chiburi, the traditional samurai sword-cleaning twirl, adapted for handguns.
-   Chang-yi does this at several points in _The Good, The Bad, The Weird_; most notably before holstering his gun after killing one of his mooks who suggested that Tae-goo might have bested him a duel.
-   In _Gunless_, The Montana Kid has a habit of doing this whenever he draws or holsters his Peacemaker; seemingly to limber up his gun hand. It is never shown whether he does this in actual gunfights, however. (In one gunfight, he starts with his gun already drawn, and in the second he is trying desperately to avoid drawing.) There is an especially impressive extended sequence of him twirling Jane's gun after he finishes repairing it—presumably testing the balance—with enough long shots to show that it is actor Paul Gross doing the twirling.
-   In _Guns, Girls and Gambling_, the Professional Killer known as The Cowboy, being The Gunslinger, uses a pair of Colt Peacemakers Guns Akimbo. After shooting someone, he always twirls the guns around his fingers before holstering them.
-   In _The Hound of the Baskervilles (1983)_, Dr. Watson does this completely unnecessarily before putting his revolver in his pocket at 221B Baker Street. He's a former soldier who fought in Afghanistan, so should know better.
-   Used as a gag in _House_, when a bat-winged skeletal monster seizes Roger's shotgun and flies off with it. Rather than claw his face off as expected for such a bestial-looking critter, the creature performs a Gun Twirl with it and then Shoots The Rope from which Roger is suspended.
-   In _Kingsman: The Golden Circle_, Agent Tequila spin-cocks a lever-action rifle to hold Eggsy and Merlin at bay in the Statesman rackhouse.
-   In the police comedy _Kopps_, Benny the Cop does this in his daydreams, combined with Juggling Loaded Guns, Guns Akimbo, Bullet Catch, etc. because his everyday life as a rural Swedish officer is not ''that'' exciting.
-   _Lone Hero_: The actors in the cowboy show at the ghost town know how to do this. John does it for real when he holsters his Colt SAA before his Showdown at High Noon with Bart.
-   Kid Blue in _Looper_ twirls his (very heavy in real-life) gun in an attempt to intimidate Joe... and nearly drops it.
    
    "Did you shoot your other foot off?"
    
-   _Lucky Luke_ does it in the Terence Hill Live-Action Adaptation, faster than his own shadow.
-   Subverted in _Man Without A Star_ (1955). Dempsey Rae shows off his fancy pistol twirling and shooting skills for young Jeff Jimson.
    
    **Jeff Jimson:** Aw, Demps, when do I learn THAT?!  
    **Dempsey Rae:** You don't! That's all a lotta hogwash, kid. Look, know this: twirlin' a gun never saved a man's life. There's only one thing you gotta learn. _\[pulls his gun and fires\]_ Get it out fast! And then... put it... away... slow. Get what I mean, kid?
    
-   In _The Mask_, Stanley Ipkiss twirls _several_ handful of weapons in each of his hands.
-   _The Matrix Reloaded_. One of the Humongous Mecha guarding the landing dock at Zion does this, even though its guns are too large to be holstered afterwards.
-   _Mars Attacks!_: After disintegrating a rude gambler, a martian twirls his ray gun and puts it back in his holster only to be killed by Barbara Land.
-   _Maverick_:
    -   Bret Maverick demonstrates this ability in the movie.
    -   Zane Cooper also does this after taking down the bad guys during the climactic card game. The fact that he does it the exact same way as Bret is a clue they're actually father and son.
-   An almost-Throw It In moment in _The Mexican_ has Brad Pitt's character drop his gun when he tries to do it. (He actually _did_ do it by accident on set, but that wasn't the take they used in the film—just the inspiration.)
-   After committing the assassination that opens _Naked Killer_, Princess twirls the silenced pistol she used for the Coup de Grâce. Meanwhile the camera POV also twirls before we Smash Cut to the police at the crime scene.
-   In _The Outlaw Josey Wales_, Josey Wales (Clint Eastwood) uses a trick called the "Road Agent's Spin" or "Border Roll" to gun down two men who have him cornered. He holds out his revolvers butt-first, slipping his index fingers into the trigger guards, then flips/twirls them to get into position and fires. Eastwood had clearly practiced a _lot_ for the trick; on-camera, he did it so fast that his hands and guns are just a blur.
-   In _Planet Terror_, El Wray demonstrates his skills by twirling a pair of revolvers in various ways. Considering that the film is a throwback to 80s Grindhouse action films, it's pretty much justified.
-   _Posse (1975)_: One of the posse does this trick to impress a girl in the town of Desoto. His partner performs the What Have We Ear? trick.
-   _The Quick and the Dead_ features an entire cast of gunfighters who twirl their guns in varying degrees of fanciness.
-   This is a Character Tic of Alex Murphy in _RoboCop (1987)_. Murphy does this as he copies a move from his son's favorite TV show. He explains to his partner Anne Lewis that he does this so he can be a role model. After Murphy is killed by Clarence Boddicker and his gang, Bob Morton and his development team at OCP seize his body and transform Murphy into RoboCop. As part of the process, Murphy's memory is erased. However, certain elements of Murphy's past remain in RoboCop. When his sharpshooting skills are demonstrated by Morton at the police firing range, the other officers including Lewis all eagerly watch him. After he finishes shooting, we see RoboCop twirl his custom gun on his right finger before putting it on a leg holster. Lewis later uses it to identify RoboCop as the late Murphy.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Also applied later as a Tear Jerker when RoboCop/Murphy goes to his old house and has a flashback of his son asking him to perform said trick.
-   In _Seven (1979)_, Cowboy does this when he draws his gun before shooting Butterfly, and when he holsters it again afterwards.
-   _Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2_. Ricky does this while cackling maniacally after the "Garbage Day!" killing.
-   Used in _Silverado_ to establish characters as being skilled with guns.
-   _Solo_. Tobias Beckett can draw and holster with style. Han Solo is impressed and asks him for some pointers, which he flatly refuses.
-   In _Sunset_, Tom Mix is seen doing this in the Film Within a Film. However, when he gets in a real gunfight at the ranch, he just draws and fires.
-   _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_: In an homage to John Wayne, the Terminator uses a shotgun with an identical action. The armorer provided a regular Winchester 1887 and a modified one with an extra large loop on the lever; when Arnold grabbed the wrong one to do some flip-cocking for a scene, he nearly broke three fingers.
-   Whenever The Three Stooges find themselves in the old West, expect them to have... issues with handling their guns this way.
-   _Tombstone_:
    -   Taken to a logical extreme in the scene where Doc Holliday and Johnny Ringo have a competition to see who can do the most elaborate Gun Spin. After Ringo does a flawless and incredibly elaborate session of twirling, Doc parodies him by using a tin cup to mirror all of Johnny's tricks, causing everyone around (even Ringo's friends) to laugh and applaud at the display.
    -   Later in the film there's a scene on the street where a confrontation is brewing between the Cowboys and the Earps. Wyatt Earp is in the middle of arresting the leader of the Cowboys and is in a standoff with Ike Clanton when Ike's younger brother Billy tries to stop Wyatt. While this is going on Doc comes out to back up Wyatt, and Billy mocks Doc, saying he's just The Piano Player and that Doc's probably seeing double because of how much he's had to drink. To add onto things, as Clanton says this he menacingly draws a large knife. Doc responds by pulling a second pistol and spinning them in opposite directions at the same time, (a very difficult trick) accompanied by the awesome one-liner "I have two guns, one for each of ya." Young Billy Clanton decides not to try his luck with the drunken piano player after all. Watch the scene here.
-   The eponymous hero of the _Trinity_ Spaghetti Western movies absolutely loves doing this.
-   Most famously in _True Grit_ and _Rooster Cogburn_, John Wayne used a Winchester lever-action rifle with an enlarged cocking lever, allowing him to recock by spinning the gun one-handed.
-   In _Valdez is Coming_, Tanner performs a 'road agent spin' on one of his customers when he extends a pistol to him for his examination: seemingly for no other reason than he is a dick who enjoys showing off and pointing guns at people.
-   Most of the characters in _Versus_ doing this at least once after pulling a gun or before holstering it, just because it adds to the Rule of Cool.

-   _Batman (1966)_ has one of the villains entertain a kid by teaching how to properly twirl a pistol.
-   This is how Scott, David's best friend in the first two seasons of _Beverly Hills, 90210_, died; he was showing off by twirling his father's gun at his birthday party when he shot himself in the stomach. All in front of David, who was pleading with him to stop. Is it any wonder the poor guy had so many problems in the years following?
-   _Castle_: The owner of a dude ranch demonstrates his skill at this for Rick and Kate in the Cowboy Episode "Once Upon a Time in the West".
-   The (first) Doctor does this in the _Doctor Who_ serial "The Gunfighters". Steven attempts to copy him and drops the gun.
-   _Godless_ has this in the first episode with a nameless extra and in the second with Whitey, who does it in front of a full-length mirror talking to an imaginary opponent Travis Bickle-style, then quick-draws both his revolvers at once, obviously impressed by how cool he looks. (His employer is far less impressed when he comes through the door and Whitey points the guns at him.)
-   _The Heavy Water War_. The Norwegians in the "Grouse" reconnaissance team are enthusiastic but can't hit their targets on the firing range. One of them puts away his Thompson submachine gun, draws his Colt .45 and advances on the target firing, then twirls the weapon with the slide locked back. The female British SOE captain is not impressed, draws her own gun and puts a bullet through each bullseye. She's even less impressed when the same guy shoots himself in the foot while twirling a revolver, leaving the mission short one man.
-   Sylar does this in an episode of _Heroes_... for bonus points, it's after he's just stolen Bob's ability and he turns the gun to gold while he spins it.
-   _Kamen Rider Decade_: Daiki Kaitou loves doing this, in an especially strange example since his gun is the Transformation Trinket that lets him become Kamen Rider Diend.
-   A _M\*A\*S\*H_ episode has Frank Burns attempting this in a very clumsy fashion; he then hands the gun to Radar, who does it expertly.

-   Ronon Dex of _Stargate Atlantis_ is quite fond of this. Given that his pistol is a Death Ray, this is even more of a bad idea than usual.
-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ features Chekhov's Gun Twirling in the episode "A Fistful of Datas": A gunfighter in a Holodeck western is seen twirling his gun several times. Later, just after the accident that leads to a Holodeck Malfunction, Data (who has also been corrupted) picks up a tricorder and imitates the same move with it.
-   _Supernatural_. Dean Winchester does this with a Sawed-Off Shotgun of all things, in a Season 5 episode.

-   _Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger's_ Humongous Mecha, the Dekaranger Robo, does this with its Signal Cannon after its finishing move, followed by holstering it. For bonus points, it's a direct shout-out to the _RoboCop_ example above, including returning it to a holster hidden inside its leg.
-   _The West Wing_: In "We Killed Yamamoto", after some time at the shooting range Simon Donovan (Mark Harmon) twirls his pistol, a .357 magnum, and sticks it down the front of his pants ... and promptly pulls it out again when he feels what the barrel of a pistol feels like after its just been fired.

    And butterfingers Irving gunned himself down!
    
-   TWICE's Chaeyoung does this with her revolver as the cowgirl in the "Cheer Up" video.

    Roleplay 

-   In _Survival of the Fittest_, Harold Fisher tries this before killing Maxwell Lombardi. Naturally, he drops the gun, which Maxwell puts to much better use.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In the Tabletop RPG _Pathfinder_ there is a feat for that. It allows you to trick your opponents so they don't know who will you shoot.

    Video Games 

-   Manosuke Naitou (Horace Knightley in the fan translation) of _Ace Attorney Investigations 2_ is a master of this. If you call him on a lie he catches himself mid-twirl and fires a round near his face. During his breakdown, he tries to twirl his pistol increasingly fast before throwing it and everything in his pockets in the air and it all comes crashing down on his head.
-   In _Advent Rising_, this is how the character reloads his guns. All his guns. Yes, even the _rocket launchers_.
-   This is how The Kid reloads the Dueling Pistols in _Bastion_. Somehow.
-   _Battlefield Hardline_ has gun twirling as part of one of its Easter Egg Unorthodox Reload animations with a ~0.01% chance of occurring. The .410 Jury revolver's easter egg has the user eject the spent casings, then start twirling the gun about their index finger while flicking shells into empty chambers with their other hand, including one shell which is flicked the wrong way and wraps around the screen to enter a chamber backwards.
-   In the _Half-Life_ Fan Remake _Black Mesa_, Gordon does this as the Idle Animation for the Glock.
-   _Incision_ has a special twirling animation available if you're using your revolver or magnum, by hitting reload and fire at the same time. This actually increases your weapon's firepower - twirled bullets somehow deals extra damage to enemies.
-   In _Borderlands_ and _Borderlands 2_, characters wielding pistols will twirl them as they switch to a different weapon. Marshal Friedman spins his own revolver a few times after using it to execute a murderer.
-   _City of Heroes_:
    -   The Malta Group Gunslingers twirl their guns as they prepare to shoot.
    -   The Dual Pistols powerset does this too. Usually when drawing them or switching ammo.
-   Tanya Adam's Idle Animation in _Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2_ has her spinning and juggling her .45 Colt pistols.
-   Johnny Silverhand frequently twirls his pistol in _Cyberpunk 2077_ while reloading.
-   _Devil May Cry 4_ features Dante twirling his dual pistols Ebony & Ivory prior to some rapid-fire action with a move called "Honeycomb." Nero is also shown twirling his massive Blue Rose revolver when putting it away after firing in cutscenes.
    -   Dante also does this as his Idle Animation in the first game.
-   In _DUSK_, where in most FPS you'd find a reload button is a button that twirls your weapon. You can actually kill enemies by twirling a gun right in their faces.
-   Done in the first two _Fallout_ games whenever a character holsters a handgun — or an _SMG_, in some cases.
-   In _Fallout: New Vegas_, you meet Joshua Graham (the "Burned Man") in the _Honest Hearts_ expansion with him doing this while preparing some Colt M1911s. Oddly, his twirling of the guns is done in a very safe way - even if it's ignored that the 1911 has a grip safety which requires constant pressure from the firing hand holding onto the grip in a proper manner to actually fire, he ejects the magazine and locks the slide before giving the gun a half-twirl to check the barrel, then twirls it back and reloads the gun once he's satisfied. Have a look.
-   In _Final Fantasy VII_, Vincent's Victory Pose contains this.
    -   Vincent's attack animation with pistols also contains this. Justified, in that he needs to spin the gun to re-arm the hammer mechanism since his claw-like left hand is too bulky. It works fine for handling the pump action on his shotguns, however.
    -   There's also the final flourish in the synchronized marching mini-game, where Cloud's sword twirl is recreated with a Mook rifle.
-   Balthier from _Final Fantasy XII_ does this, with a predictably suave and gentlemanly manner.
-   Cater of _Final Fantasy Type-0_ spins her Magicite Pistol between shots of her Elementillery attack. It seems to be a way to stop the weapon from overheating, as she only does it between Flame and Voltaic shots.
-   Jagi in _Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage_ will twirl his Sawn-Off Shotgun on a finger as part of his victory/idle animation. As those things are heavy and poorly balanced for spinning, it's anyone's guess how he manages without removing a finger or two.
-   Used in _Gears of War_ on two weapons. The first is the Gnasher shotgun where after a non-active reload animation they spin it by the lever. In the active reload however they forgo the flair entirely to get back to shooting faster. The second one is the Boltok revolver in _Gears 2_ and onward with the weapon-specific execution. The character grabs the gun by the barrel, whacks the victim across the back of the skull, then spins it on their finger to return it to shooting position. More forgivable since executions are intended to be Awesome, but Impractical.
-   _Goldeneye Rogue Agent_ uses this to reload guns, most prominently the Jackal .357 and the Mamba 12g. He only does it when he's dual-wielding.
-   In _Guild Wars 2_, idle characters wielding a pistol in the main hand will do this.
-   In both of the _Gungrave_ games, leaving Beyond the Grave idle for a bit and he'll twirl his dual-handguns as an idle animation. He also does it at the start of each level ("KICK THEIR ASS!") as he draws them.
-   Happy Chaos from _Guilty Gear ~Strive~_ occasionally indulges in this. His cinematic Overdrive has him twirl his Guns Akimbo before unloading bullets on his opponent, and his round win animation has him spin his gun to holster it, with several possible results: He may holster it properly, drop the gun midway, nearly shoot his own foot by accident, or conjure multiple copies of the gun out of nowhere much to his confusion.
-   In _Gunstar Heroes_, Blaster Force is basically a gigantic pistol that twirls itself around.
-   In _Honkai Impact 3rd_, Kiana and Kallen Kaslana both twirl one of their guns as part of their victory poses; the main difference is that Kallen tosses her gun into the air to twirl it.
-   Tetra does this as part of her Victory Pose in _Hyrule Warriors_, twirling her flintlock gun a la Revolver Ocelot.
-   In _Knights of the Old Republic_, and the sequel, pressing the x key (PC default) or Y button (X-Box) outside of combat with a pistol causes the character to do this. Equipped akimbo too, but with a different animation.
-   _Landfall Archives_ have you twirling an AK-47 towards _yourself_ to reload it, Somehow without shooting yourself in the chest.
-   _League of Legends_:
    -   Lucian does this as his dance animation.
    -   Mad Artist Gunslinger Jhin demonstrates the danger of this trope in his joke animation: He twirls his gun, but slips up and drops it, and it proceeds to fire everywhere as Jhin cowers in fear. He takes back the gun only once he's sure it has stopped firing.
-   Elie MacDowell in _The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV_ twirls her gun when she uses her Limit Break "Aura Rain".
-   Nakamura, the second boss of _The Legend Of Tian Ding_, who attacks with **Machine** Guns Akimbo, has an attack where he twirls both weapons while holding on the triggers, which quickly turns the boss arena into a Bullet Hell zone.
-   The Florian sisters of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's Portable: The Gears of Destiny_ does this with their pair of Variant Zappers during one of their special moves. Amita also does it in one of her victory poses and during her Full Drive Burst as she switches them from their gun form to sword form and back.
-   For the sawed-off shotguns in the _Marathon_ series, this is the standard method of reloading. How exactly does that work? "Your primitive mind could never grasp its complex nature."
-   Despite being perfectly able to wield two revolvers with the precision and effectiveness as John Preston, _Max Payne_ does not twirl his weapons.
-   Revolver Ocelot of _Metal Gear_ does this, seeing as how his weapon of choice is a single-action revolver. He does it during his _entire_ introductory speech in _Metal Gear Solid_, and in _Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater_ he's seen twirling his original service pistol, and a _crossbow_ at one point, and then with three pistols at the same time in some crazy variant of Russian roulette. Before his boss battle, he does a complicated series of tricks with a revolver in each hand.
    -   In _The Twin Snakes_ remake, Ocelot twirls his weapon with his off hand after his other hand gets sliced off by the Ninja. However, he ends up dropping the gun — then picking it up quickly and pointing it at Snake.
    -   Solidus Snake gets in on this in _Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty_ where he twirls his P90 by the thumb stock.
    -   In _MGS3_, Ocelot uses his twirling guns for a practical purpose: to protect himself from a swarm of hornets. He spins them as they fly at him and they fall down dead.
    -   Snake can do it also, but only with the Single Action Army revolver, and not to the same impressive extent as Ocelot.
        -   If you do that in first-person view while fighting Ocelot, depending on how well you did it, he will either mock you or be impressed. Either way, he'll start doing it, leaving him open to attack.
-   Arytom in _Metro 2033_ twirls his revolvers as an Idle Animation. Seeing how he's willing to toss around a fully loaded and very shoddily built submachinegun high enough to daze him when it _lands on his head_, this hardly comes as a surprise.
-   Model 1887 shotguns used akimbo in _Modern Warfare 2_ are flip-cocked after each shot.
    -   In an homage to the motorcycle ride in _Terminator 2_, Alex Mason flip-cocks an 1887 Winchester during the escape from Vorkuta. He manages to fire two shots from the single-shot weapon before he has to reload.
-   Before Erron, Stryker's Victory Pose in _Mortal Kombat 3_ involved him firing his gun in the air, then twirling it on his finger before putting it back in his holster and crossing his arms. How this guy became a cop in the first place is anyone's guess.
-   Erron Black in _Mortal Kombat X_, being The Gunslinger, is basically required to have some twirling animations.
-   _Overwatch_ has Tracer who does this when she reloads her Pulse Pistols.
    -   One of McCree's emotes is a showy display of Gun Twirling. He'll also give his revolver a quick twirl when activating his Ultimate.
-   The trailer for the Butcher's Western DLC Pack in _PAYDAY 2_ depicts the Cloaker engaging one of the main characters in a Showdown at High Noon, with the main character handily losing. The Cloaker then begins twirling his revolvers in a tauntingly absurd manner.
-   In _Persona 3_, the Protagonist and Mitsuru spin their Evokers when they draw them. Seeing as how they are planning to shoot themselves in the head with them, gun safety isn't that big an issue.
    -   It also isn't a real gun, so it isn't so dangerous.
-   Princess Eruca can be seen doing this in combat in _Radiant Historia_.
-   The Gunslinger class in _Ragnarok Online_ did this when entering battle pose and each time he/she scores a hit.
-   _Red Dead Redemption_ also features John Marston doing it whenever he shoots up an opponent in a duel. Granted, by that point he has usually fired off every bullet in his gun anyway, so at least he doesn't need to worry about shooting anyone.
-   _Red Dead Redemption II_ The player can do this manually by double tapping the holster button with a pistol or revolver. Arthur will flip the gun back a little, forward about half of a full flip, flip it a full rotation back and into the holster. It does absolutely nothing, but it looks damn good doing it.
    -   In _Red Dead Online_, if you take on the Bounty Hunter Role, it's possible to learn tricks as you twirl your guns, such as reverse spins, spin ups, and twirling _two_ guns at once.
-   The two main characters that use pistols as their default weapons in the western-themed third-person shooter _Red Dead Revolver_ twirl their guns dramatically during the loading screens.
    -   One of these characters is a professional shootist and sharpshooter in a circus and the other is a well-written version of _the_ classic western hero archetype. The characters actually perform complicated gun-twirling routines (the hero with a single, large colt and the shootist with two smaller revolvers) during these loading "screens", and the routines change as you progress through the game. Red Dead Revolver, as a result, had arguably the single best and most entertaining load screens in the history of video games.
-   The Kusagari Kid from the Wii exclusive _Red Steel 2_ twirls his revolver (his first and main firearm) when drawing and holstering it. Considering he's a wide-brimmed hat, duster coat wearing samurai/outlaw/cowboy, this is hardly surprising.
-   _Resident Evil 3: Nemesis_ has a Shout-Out to _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_, from where they drew inspiration from the T-1000 while creating The Nemesis. Jill cocks the Western Custom shotgun by twirling it around like the T-800 did in the same movie, and the Western Custom is the same exact firearm used by him: a customized 1887 Winchester Shotgun.
-   _Resident Evil 5_ has the player fight Albert Wesker on a couple of occasions. He'll sometimes pull out his Samurai Edge handgun to shoot at Chris or Sheva, after which he'll put it away while twirling it.
-   The player character in _Road Redemption_ will flip-cock their sawed-off shotgun whenever reloading (another nod to Terminator 2).
-   Twirling is an idle animation for the protagonist of _Saints Row_, and how he reloads akimbo firearms.
-   Ryōbi and Ryōna from _Senran Kagura_ have a habit of doing this in some of their fighting animations.
-   The main character of _Shogo: Mobile Armor Division_ does this every time he draws his dual pistols, as well as after reloading them.
-   One of Sly Cooper's ancestors, Tennessee "Kid" Cooper, does this in one of the game series' Cutscenes.
-   _Soldier of Fortune_'s John Mullins randomly twirls his Silver Talon .44 semiauto. Mullins being an actual soldier before going merc, you'd think he'd know better.
-   Asagi can occasionally be seen spinning _both_ her guns before holstering them in _Soul Nomad & the World Eaters_.
-   In _Spyro: Year of the Dragon_, certain cowboy-themed enemies spin and flip their weapons... which serves no purpose but to give the player an opportunity to attack.
-   Your player character in _S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat_ does this when pulling out any pistol equipped in the weapon slot. This includes even the Hand Cannon _Desert Eagle_. Although it is uncommon, NPCs _can_ be seen twirling their pistols when idle and provided they do not have a rifle/shotgun/machine gun equipped (often when they get wounded severely in a fight with other NPCs and/or mutants and their main gun is taken away either by you or another NPC, as well as offering to revive them with a medkit).
-   All over the place in _Star Wars: The Old Republic_, entirely done for Rule of Cool. Mainly done by Space Western\-influenced Smugglers in some of their ability animations, but the other pistol-wielding class, Bounty Hunters, get in on the fun occasionally too. And like many other sci-fi examples on this page, many of the blasters lack a trigger guard.
-   In _Super Robot Wars Compact 2_ and _Original Generation_, this is justified with the Weiss Ritter and it's Oxtongue Launcher<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , which must perform this in order to switch firing modes. Of course, Excellen (it's pilot and an _extremely_ cheerful sniper) likes to put a lot more flair into it.
-   Fox McCloud does this when finishing up his B special in _Super Smash Bros. Melee_, whether after one or more shots. Don't most blasters lack even a trigger guard (which might be useful)?
    -   Mewtwo also does it each time he fires using the Ray Gun item in all games he appears in. It's not as unsafe as most of the other examples on this list, however, as he holds it telekinetically so it's just floating in front of him, and it appears to twirl from the recoil rather than anything intentional.
-   In _Tales of Vesperia_, Patty Fleur does this before using her Variable Trigger arte. You can delay the attack by making her twirl her pistol longer, which also makes it stronger.
-   _Team Fortress 2_:
    -   The Heavy Weapons Guy does it with _a shotgun_... although to him a shotgun is practically the size of a handgun. There's also a popular glitch that allows him to twirl his _Gatling gun_. Makes you wonder what they put in that sandvich ...
    -   The Scout does this in reverse when reloading his pistol, pointing the barrel downwards before removing the magazine and then twirling it the rest of the way after he's replaced it.
    -   The Engineer does this in his taunt for the Pistol and the Wrangler, complete with blowing the smoking barrel out. The above-mentioned glitch lets him twirl his own shotgun in the same way... only Engie ISN'T so big his shotgun looks like a handgun in his hands!
-   _Time Commando_: In the Wild West level, the reload animation for the Twin Revolvers weapon (yes, it's a completely separate weapon from the Single Revolver) is to twirl them once. This is the fastest reload speed of any weapon in the game.
-   _Turbo Overkill_ features pistols. When Johnny uses pistol's Charged Attack, he starts twirling one of his pistols.
-   _ULTRAKILL_ has a sharpshooter revolver. Its alternate fire can be charged by twirling the revolver. Twirl multiple sharpshooter revolvers simultaneously and you can get an arilift.
-   One very common enemy (a cowboy-themed semi-Elite Mook) in _Viewtiful Joe_ does this, as does recurring Miniboss the Joker.
-   _Warframe_ has gun twirling as an Idle Animation for most pistols. The Marelok lever-action pistol is pumped by twirling the entire pistol about the lever, like the Terminator's Winchester. The Akstilleto dual pistols are twirled once about the trigger before the guns are slapped down onto new magazines on the user's hips.
-   Rubi Malone in _WET_ does this all the time, often when going into an arena battle.
-   _Wild ARMs 5_: While in battle, Rebecca constantly twirls her gun as her Idle Animation, stopping only to perform commands.
-   Male Draenei in _World of Warcraft_ twirl their rifle sized guns one handed in order to reload while auto-attacking in a clear homage to the John Wayne and Terminator 2: Judgment Day examples above.
-   In _Xenosaga_, Jr./Rubedo does a double gun twirl as he enters a couple of pivotal fights over the course of the three games: the effect is peculiar, bordering on silly, because 1) he performs it with two automatic pistols rather than revolvers, and 2) both times it happens, Rubedo ends up using his Red Dragon Power (his combination Super Mode, Sphere of Destruction, Sphere of Power, and Battle Aura) instead of the guns, meaning it seems to be more a Standard Power Up Pose and/or Ass Kicking Pose than an anything that has to do with the intimidation factor of his gunplay skills themselves.

-   _Whateley Universe_: As usual for Gun Tropes in this series, this is treated seriously: one of the first things Gunny Bardue sees when he is on campus the first time is a JROTC cadet pulling off stunts like this, in front of a bathroom mirror. He proceeds to rip the student a new one over it:
    
    **Gunny Bardue:** Cadet Captain Rogers, what is your malfunction that you are disgracing the uniform of my beloved Marine Corps? Did your mother drop you on that pointed head of yours? Did you not eat enough Ho-hoes before you decided to embarrass the uniform of my Marine Corps by playing with your weapon in, of all places, the head? What excuses do you have for this outrage, knuckle dragger?!

-   _Critical Role_: The first thing Scanlan does when he gets his hands on Dr. Ripley's gun is to twirl it, which promptly results in the rest of the group deciding it's a bad idea to allow him to handle a firearm.

    Western Animation 

-   _Arcane_: While the mentally unstable Jinx doing this is par for course, even Caitlyn, a trained Enforcer, twirls her pistol while thinking.
-   Kevin from _Captain N: The Game Master_ does this frequently. Which is odd, because the Zapper doesn't have a trigger guard.
-   In "My Little Duckaroo," Daffy Duck twirls his gun and ends up shooting himself in the head, showing why this is a bad idea. He makes the same mistake in "Daffy's Inn Trouble."
-   Being a cowboy-themed superhero, Vigilante of the _Justice League_ naturally does this.
-   In the _King of the Hill_ episode "Soldier of Misfortune" Dale talks about a phony story about how he supposedly performed a hit on a man to his gun club. Upon finishing his story he twirls the pistol he had used to tell the story; he ends up dropping the gun and it discharges, hitting a cash register.
-   Quick Draw McGraw has done this a few times.
-   _The Simpsons_: In the episode "The Cartridge Family", Homer acquires a revolver to protect the family, despite Marge's protests. In one scene, he enters the Kwik-E-Mart twirling it and whistling casually, and accidentally scares Apu in the process.
-   Captain Rex from _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_, as well as Sabine Wren, and Fenn Rau from _Star Wars Rebels_ are characters that have done this at least once. Captain Fordo from _Star Wars: Clone Wars_ does this as well as part of a Lock-and-Load Montage with his squad. Maybe it's a Mandalorian thing.
-   Hank in _The Venture Brothers_ twirls a stapler in this fashion while helping Brock put up Christmas decorations.
