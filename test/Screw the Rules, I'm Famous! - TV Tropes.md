**BoJack:** Listen up, everybody, I, famous celebrity BoJack Horseman, have an announcement. I'm gonna have to ask you to drop all charges against my friends on account of me being a celebrity. We gracefully accept the requisite slap on the wrist, and a brief but ultimately pointless trial in the court of public opinion. Good day.  
**Officer Meow-Meow Fuzzyface:** Well, you _are_ famous, so you're all free to go.

Being a celebrity is what most people would love to be. Having adoring fans, being rich beyond your wildest dreams, or to be hailed as a hero in your home town and rub it into your enemies' faces. But then there are moments where celebrities or very popular people start using their status to get away with whatever they want, thinking to themselves that they do not have to worry about those pesky laws that the commoners must abide by. Of course, when they're caught, they can bank on their loyal fans to proclaim their innocence, even when it's obvious they've done it, and cue a celebration when they're acquitted rather than convicted. This can go hand in hand with Villain with Good Publicity if the villain is so revered by the people and the media that they would literally let them get away with murder.

Truth in Television, as there are many famous and popular people are able to get away with what they want. Sometimes, however, there are things that famous people won't get away with doing that others can. For instance, a family-friendly actor attempting to do something that would be considered too adult.

Compare to Screw the Rules, I Have Money! and Screw the Rules, I'm Beautiful!, but the character simply uses their popularity to get away with anything rather than greasing a few palms or looking pretty. Though money and good looks help in this case. Or even Screw the Rules, I Have Connections! if the person in question knows a celebrity or someone they know made them famous.
