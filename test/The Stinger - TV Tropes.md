**Scott Meyer:** Some movies have an extra scene after the credits.  
**Friend:** Mainly superhero movies and dumb comedies.  
**Scott Meyer:** You're right, _**most**_ movies have an extra scene.

A name for any post-credits scene. It's often used as a type of Easter Egg for people who stick around for the credits when most people had left the theater/changed the channel. Sometimes a comedy will include outtakes. Sometimes the outtakes can be better than the movie.

This is often used to provide some kind of Sequel Hook, but may also be there just as a final gift to the audience, such as a comedy giving one final joke and punchline to the audience, or a dramatic work showing that maybe the guy who made a Heroic Sacrifice is Not Quite Dead.

Often done as a form of That's All, Folks!. It can overlap with Creative Closing Credits, if the format of the credits almost constitutes a special production in and of itself.

All There in the Stinger is a sub-trope. Compare Signing-Off Catchphrase. See also The Tag. Not to be confused with a musical Sting (or a wrestling Sting), though a suitably dramatic Stinger will have a Sting. The Teaser works at the _opposite_ end. See On the Next for when there's a preview of the next episode. Also not to be confused with the body part on the back of a bee, scorpion, or wasp. Or a boxing glove wrapped in barbed wire.

## This is an Ending Trope, so beware of unmarked spoilers!

-   The _Big Finish Doctor Who_ audio _The Book of Kells_ has a post credits sequence revealing that the Meddling Monk's companion "Brother Lucianus" is really Lucy Miller.

    Comic Books 

-   Betcha nobody ever expected to see this one in a comic book (Unless you grew up during the Bronze Age), but there it is: Green Lantern crossover event _Sinestro Corps War_ ended with one of the main villains, nearly dead and utterly defeated, thrown into space. Then, with credits appearing between the panels, we see where he lands... and things have suddenly gotten much, much worse for our unknowing heroes. The final page of the book is a teaser for the sequel event, _Blackest Night_.
-   Don Rosa supplied one extra page as an epilogue for the hardcover versions of _The Quest For Sampo_, his Finnish-themed story. In it, the Grim Reaper returns Scrooge McDuck's top hat and offers to allow him to take his fortune to the afterlife in exchange for a hundred dollars.
-   The final page in an issue of _Rising Stars_ is a clairvoyant sitting by himself. When you flip the page, there's a bunch of people drawn very lightly, speaking backwards. If you go back to the previous page and hold it up to the light, you see that the figures on the back page are actually GHOSTS talking to the character in the chair.
-   _Final Crisis_: Bruce Wayne is alive.
-   At the end of a _Punisher Max_ story arc Wilson Fisk has become the Kingpin (at the cost of his son's life and his wife's sanity) and orders everyone away so he can enjoy it. But one person won't leave.
    
    **Receptionist:** You still have one appointment.  
    **Kingpin:** Tell him to go away.  
    **Receptionist:** I did, but he refuses to leave. He says he has a meeting with Don Rigoletto.  
    **Kingpin:** Tell him Rigoletto's dead.  
    **Receptionist:** I told him, sir, but he's very insistent. He says he's Rigoletto's "Miracle Worker". Whatever that means.  
    **Kingpin:** What's his name?  
    **Receptionist:** Well, he wants to be called Bullseye.
    
-   The 16th issue of _The Unbelievable Gwenpool_ ends on a Bittersweet Ending: her brother has successfully prevented her from ever entering the main Marvel Comics universe, but there's the promise that Gwen's life in her own world could improve, and she'll be happy. The page even ends with "The End" at the bottom. The next page is the letters to the editor, which show up at the end of every issue. And the real, FINAL page shows that Gwen notices the little "The End" at the bottom of the page and picks it up. When she drops it, it breaks, and a "To be continued..." shows at the end of the page, letting us know that the original ending wasn't the finale.
-   Following his return from the dead in _Marvel Legacy_ #1<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , Wolverine was featured in one-page stingers that came after the letters page of numerous comics. The issues that featured the stinger included a "Where's Wolverine?" badge with Logan's face in it.

    Literature 

### **General:**

-   Many mass-market paperback versions of novels put a teaser for the sequel (usually its prologue or first chapter) or a separate book by the same author and/or in the same setting in a separate section after the end of the book.

### **By work:**

-   Several novels in the _The Culture_ series end with an epilogue which is generally humorous/uplifting even if the end of the novel proper was bittersweet and/or followed Banks's "trademark". One notable exception to this pattern is _Look to Windward_, whose epilogue depicts a shape-shifting Culture assassin taking horrific revenge on the Chelgrians who had orchestrated the foiled terrorist plot by torturing them to death in terrifyingly sadistic ways. For example, it turns into a swarm of bees to suffocate one of them. It also makes sure that the attacks are recorded, so that the rest of the Chelgrians get the message. Bearing in mind that the plotters are _unarmed monks_, this is quite a departure in tone for a novel that is not generally either scary or action-packed, and which portrays the Culture almost exclusively favourably up to this point.
-   At the end of the first _Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard_ book, there's Perspective Flip which shows us that Magnus's uncle Randolph was working with Loki the whole time, and that the god's the Big Bad.
-   Daniel Silva's _Gabriel Allon_ novels tend to have epilogue's in which Mossad tracks down and assassinates any villain who escaped by the end of the novel proper (e.g. in one case, a character who had planned explosions is himself mailed a bomb which kills him.
-   Early in the book _Remote Man_, a rare python disappears from its habitat in the Northern Territory, and an American tourist who is later exposed as a wildlife smuggler is suspected by the teenage heroes of stealing it. On the last page, the python is back on the rock, calling into question whether it was stolen in the first place.
-   _Rogues to Riches_ has the main characters convince an orc prison guard that they are all characters in a book partway through. They promise him that they will get him a bigger part if he lets them escape. The last page of the book includes a picture of him still sitting at his post and a paragraph stating that he is patiently waiting for them to fulfill the promise.
-   _Orconomics: A Satire_ has one after the Fantasy World Map, the glossary, and the author's thanks.
-   _Words of Radiance_ (second book of _The Stormlight Archive_): The last chapter is narrated by Hoid, the King's Wit, as he waits for someone on a random plain. Then Jasnah teleports in.
-   The official novelization of _Resident Evil: The Final Chapter_ ends with a scene not present in the actual movie, showing that Wesker's remains, buried at the bottom of the destroyed Hive, were shielded from the release of the anti-virus. As such, the T-virus within his cells is intact, awaiting the day it can be released again...
-   The second _Star Trek: Discovery_ novel, _Drastic Measures_, has a scene after the About the Author and acknowledgements suggesting that the real Captain Lorca is still alive in the Mirror Universe.
-   The last chapter of _Angels of Music_ is followed by the author's afterword and acknowledgments, an author bio, a page plugging other books from the same publisher, and _then_ a brief epilogue with a Sequel Hook.
-   _NOS4R2_ ends with a note on the font used... which immediately switches describing a few of Charlie's Children escaping to celebrate Christmas in the real world.
-   _Falling Up_ by Shel Silverstein: The back inside cover has a short handwritten poem telling the reader that they've reached the end and warning them of trying to look for more in the book's binding, lest they vanish within. It is accompanied by an illustration of a pair of legs sticking out of the binding.
    
    _The end of the book—  
    No use to look  
    For any more, my dear,  
    'Cause if you try finding  
    Some more in the binding,  
    You may just...disappear_
    
    _Bye-bye  
    S.S._
    
-   The "Author's Preferred Text" edition of _Neverwhere_ includes an entire short story featuring a secondary character as the Stinger, _How the Marquis Got His Coat Back_, which explains, well, how the Marquis got his coat back.

    Music Videos 

-   In the music video to Disturbed's "Asylum", after the song ends we're treated to a shot of the charred corpse of the protagonist sitting in a morgue who'd just tossed himself into a furnace to escape his pursuers<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  (thinking his was just having a delusion and that he would end up back in his padded cell). The corpse opens its eyes, implying that even this was somehow just a delusion.
-   Nine Inch Nails' unreleased (officially at least) _Broken Movie_ has a Stinger where the severed head of the serial killer, who had just been hanged, suddenly hits the ground. This occurrs about a minute after it seems to end, making it more than a little jarring.

    Podcasts 

-   Each episode of _Welcome to Night Vale_ ends with a proverb, written in the same surreal tone as the rest of the series.
-   The Cordials of Kindness segment of _Were You Raised by Wolves?_ often follows the Signing Off Catchphrase and can easily be missed if the listener tries to skip the Patreon ad at the very end of the episode. This emphasizes Nick's point that Leah insists they do this segment, which goes into the theme that it's additional to a given episode and not a normal segment.
-   _Unwell Podcast_: After the credits of most episodes of the first two seaons have a fact about the town. Several epsisodes after season two have post-credit scenes.

    Puppet Shows 

-   After the Credits for _The Muppet Show_, Statler and Waldorf, two crotchety old Muppets in the balcony seats, would make insulting jokes about the show for a few seconds.
-   _Muppets Tonight_ would often have bloopers at the end. As in, one of the Muppets would point out that another Muppets or the special guest had flubbed a line. Now that's dedication to the illusion.
-   _The Sprout Sharing Show_: A website promo would play after the Goodbye Song and before the start of _The Good Night Show_.

    Radio 

-   _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1978)_: Almost all of the radio episodes followed the Find Out Next Time narration with an announcer delivering either a brief advertisement for some in-universe publication/product or a mock advisory warning. A few episodes also had a main character coming back to say one more thing, e.g. Zaphod noticing the fairy cake in the Total Perspective Vortex and eating it.
-   The Big Finish Doctor Who audio _The Book of Kells_ ends with the revelation that the Meddling Monk's companion Brother Lucianus, is actually the Doctor's ex-companion Lucie Miller.
-   _John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme_ always has a one liner after the credits, sometimes a parody of a continuity announcement ("If you'd like to hear this show again ... aw, thanks!"). The Self-Parody in the final episode of season 7 has "Putting a line after the credits doesn't make you _Hitchhiker's_."

    Roleplay 

-   In _Ruby Quest_, after Ruby, Tom, and Jay have escaped the Metal Glen and are riding away on a tram, the final panel (after one showing the last verse of the poem _The Metal Glen_) shows Daisy (a minor character killed relatively early on) reviving in a locker, mirroring Ruby's position at the beginning of the quest.

    Tabletop Games 

-   If the director rolls double after the ending in _Die Laughing_, the "Post-Credits Scene" list is consulted, with various options ranging from players describing a scene of Hilarious Outtakes, to the first player to be killed during the session coming up with a Sequel Hook.

    Theatre 

-   In _Arsenic and Old Lace_, the curtain call is supposed to include the twelve deceased old men walking out of the cellar and taking their bows.
-   ''Hadestown has the song 'I Raise My Cup to Him' sung after the curtain call.
-   The _Mrs. Hawking_ play series: Part V: _Mrs. Frost_ has a tiny final scene occurs "during the credits" by pausing the curtain call and resuming it after the scene is finished. It sets up the next story.
-   The Screen-to-Stage Adaptation of _The Producers_ has a short musical number during the curtain call, thanking the audience for coming and telling them to get lost. This also appears in the 2005 film version after the credits.
-   Almost a minute after the curtain call of _The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night Time_, Christopher returns to the stage to give a maths appendix (as Siobhan promised him earlier), utilizing all the technology used in the theatre and ending with a big confetti finish.
-   At the end of _Tails of Wasps_, after Frank's seemingly anticlimactic ending soliloquy, the audience exits the hotel room to find that Judith, the hooker who robbed him at knife point, is passed out in the hallway.

    Web Animation 

-   _NCHProductions_ regularly ends his videos with a short stinger offering one last joke.
-   _Red vs. Blue_, Season 3 — at the end of the credits on the DVD Vic appears, saying, "I understand you're enjoying the sweet music and all, but the DVD's over. Go home, dude, live your life."
-   _TP_: After the credits roll, we cut back to the restroom the toilet paper roll escaped from. The toilet goes on another "Piece by piece, ply by ply" rant, only for the plunger to start plunging his mouth and telling him to shut up.
-   Worst... corpse run... _ever_.
-   Most _Flash Tub_ animations have a stinger, usually an outtake from one of the voice actors or an extra scene. Sometimes, there's _two_.
-   _The Red Eclipse_: After the credits, there's a short scene of Origami in her apartment, cooking on the stove. The camera zooms out to show a bunch of dollar bills on her table folded into origami cranes.
-   _RWBY_: Each season is called a 'Volume'. At the end of every volume, there is a post-credits scene that either reveals something previously unknown or unconfirmed or which acts as a hook to set up the next volume.
    -   Volume 1 focusses on the main villain being Roman Torchwick, a petty thief who runs afoul of Ruby Rose when he tries to rob the shop she's in. However, in the pilot episode, he escapes with the help of a mysterious woman with phenomenal power, whose face remains hidden in shadows except for a pair of glowing golden eyes and an affinity for fire. The volume's stinger reveals the woman's face for the first time and introduces her name. While the pilot implied that Roman was this woman's boss, the stinger reveals the opposite: Roman is working for Cinder, and she is The Man Behind the Man for Volume 1 and the Big Bad of Volumes 2-3. The stinger also reveals Cinder's two disciples, Emerald and Mercury.
    -   Volume 2 involves Team RWBY attempting to uncover what the White Fang and Roman Torchwick are up to, given that it's very strange for a Faunus equal-rights terrorist organisation to team up with the highly racist and human Roman. When Team RWBY run across the villainous hideout and attempt to thwart the plot, Yang is rescued from certain death by the intervention of a mysterious masked woman who appears through a portal just long enough to save her life and disappear the way she came without a word to Yang. At the end of the volume finale, Yang comments on being so exhausted that she's looking forward to a good sleep. The stinger reveals Yang walking through the school grounds towards the masked woman in a surreal, dream-like sequence. The woman removes her mask, revealing that she's almost the spitting image of Yang, except for her hair and default eye colour. The stinger ends as the woman informs Yang that they need to talk. In Volume 3, the woman is confirmed to be Yang's mother, Raven Branwen, who abandoned Yang as a newborn baby for what reason, Yang doesn't know.
    -   Volume 3 ends with the climax of Cinder's villainous plans and the reveal that she's just The Heavy for the true Big Bad, Salem, who seems determined to destroy Professor Ozpin. Team RWBY is scattered to the four winds by the destruction of Beacon Academy, leaving Ruby to set out on a long journey to Haven Academy, with a couple of friends from Team JNPR. The stinger reveals that Ruby's uncle, Qrow, is secretly following the group; he is carrying the cane of missing-and-possibly-dead Beacon headmaster, Ozpin, and is revealed to be capable of shapeshifting into a literal crow. This sets up several different strands of Volume 4's multiple plotlines.
    -   Volume 4 introduces the farm boy Oscar Pine, who suddenly finds himself Sharing a Body with Professor Ozpin; Ozpin spends the volume trying to convince Oscar to travel to Haven Academy to meet the school's headmaster, an old friend of Ozpin's. Towards the climax of the volume, Ruby's group finds out that Qrow has been following them and he tells them about Ozpin's Secret War with Salem. When they ask him if there's anything else he's hiding from them, he is evasive but it's implied he's keeping his shapeshifting ability secret. The stinger of the volume consists Qrow sitting in a bar in Mistral. Oscar appears in the bar and asks for his cane back. Qrow instantly gives him Ozpin's cane, and tells Ozpin it's good to see him again. The stinger's reveal is that Qrow knew all along that Ozpin could Body Surf and that they clearly had some kind of pre-arranged agreement to meet in Mistral should something happen to Ozpin, using the cane as a means to identify Ozpin's new host body.
    -   Volume 5 focusses on the various plans to either destroy Haven Academy and steal its mythical Relic of Knowledge or protect both the school and the Relic it guards. Yang confronts her mother, who is revealed to have the ability to create portals to people she has created a 'bond' with. She has three known connections: her daughter, Yang; her brother, Qrow; and her former husband, Taiyang. Yang uses Raven's ability to connect to Qrow to locate her sister, Ruby. During the volume finale, Yang and Raven have a confrontation over the fate of the Relic of Knowledge, and Raven abandons both the Relic and her daughter, escaping from the school by a portal, despite the fact that two of her portal connections (Yang and Qrow) are in the same building as her. The stinger shows an idyllic scene of Taiyang watering his plants at home. When he suddenly hears feathers rustling overhead, however, all Taiyang can do is sigh as he sees a black feather landing near him. The stinger's implication is that Raven used her portal connection to Taiyang to escape from Haven Academy.
    -   Volume 6 deals with the protagonists as they attempt to reach Atlas without aid from Ozpin whom they take to task for the secrets he's been keeping, and also with the villains who are taken to task by Salem for the failures in Volume 5. The volume ends with both the villains and the protagonists descending upon Atlas for their own reasons. The stinger, however, reveals to Emerald and Mercury that Salem is building an army of Grimm made from a new species she is creating. Hazel's explanation of what's happen indicates that she's decided the only one who can properly complete the task she's set is herself.
    -   Volume 7 is the first volume to avert this trope, as it features no stinger whatsoever.
    -   Volume 8 features the heroes try and fail to save the kingdom of Atlas, ultimately falling down while in the Void Between the Worlds, which they were explicitly warned not to do. The stinger features Crescent Rose, Ruby's weapon and the first thing to fall, washed up on an unknown beach, in a setting that looks very much not like Remnant, the world that RWBY takes place in. Volume 9 reveals that this place is the Ever After, a world that Remnant's gods had been a part of before abandoning it and going to Remnant itself. The focus of Volume 9 is on the heroes also arriving in the Ever After and finding a way to escape it and get back to Remnant.
    -   Volume 9 subverts this trope. Its end credits do feature a scene afterwards... but it's just a trailer for the then-upcoming crossover movie with the Justice League.
-   The popular web animation _Draw with Me_ has a particularly infamous one.
-   _Inanimate Insanity II_ has a stinger at the end of every episode. A few contribute to the plot, such as teasing the return of Taco.
-   _The Most Epic Story Ever Told in All of Human History_: The trailer includes an extra scene during the credits where Epic Fail blows up his own toaster by trying to warm up his DVD player in it, and Epic-Man does a Face Palm in response.
-   A few YouTube Poop videos show things at the end, such as subliminal messages/images or a "CUT-OFF PREVENTION" blurb (YouTube is known for frequently cutting off half a second of video, maybe more depending on the length). Steg often shows a clip at the end of his videos showing Big Bird saying, "Coming soon on Sesame Street!" and then cutting to something completely unrelated, while Big Bird finishes off with "Toodle-oo!"
-   In _Battle for Dream Island_, there will probably be one after the voting screen. So far, there are 41 stingers and counting.
-   _Happy Tree Friends_:
    -   After the credits of "Clause For Concern, Cub is seen reaching for a light switch and is soon squashed by the door when a disappointed Pop opens it.
    -   After the credits of "Mirror Mirror", Splendid's group try to wedge him out of the concrete with a giant crowbar, only to have it break.
-   _Minilife TV_:
    -   After the credits of "The Semi-Finals", a familiar-looking construction worker and his workmate are shown repairing the hole left in the wall of the arena from the match in the episode.
    -   During the credits of "The Party (Season Finale)", there's a scene where Genevieve interviews Vince about Chris and Ian's roof collapsing, but Vince is unable to answer.
    -   After the credits of the Minilife Chronicles episode "The Student and The Master", Abel calls Chris about coming to visit Minilife City for the World Martial Arts Tournament, and there's a reanimated scene from "Flashback to Fortune Teller Fankii".
-   _HFIL_ has these in a carryover from its parent series _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_. The ogres even directly mention them in episode 9, pointing out how often people miss them.
-   _The Pink City_: In "Elain the Bounty Hunter", after the credits finish, it shows Dento still stuck in the elevator.

    Webcomics 

-   Occasionally some Reddit Polandball comics will have stingers in the comments section.
-   _Shen Comix_: _Fly to the Heavens_ ends with with two black panels reading "Art by Shen" and "Writing by Shen", followed by one additional strip showing a diminished Life getting up and running after Shen.
    
    Always wait until after the credits.
    
-   _Sluggy Freelance_ 'Displacement' story arc ended on an tidy Epilogue...Or So It Seemed. The next strip showed two castaway villains resigning themselves to an island Paradise, and relaxed in poses matching Torg and Sasha's at the beginning of the story.
-   In _Trevor (2020)_, after the credits are over, the last shot of the comic is of the early dawn sky, through the windows of the doors at the entrance to the medical facility. The only reminder of the carnage that took place earlier that night is Dr. Maddison’s severed hand on the floor.

    Web Original 

-   _DesuDesBrigade_: Professor Otaku has ended every review of his since Street Fighter II with one of these, of varying hilarity levels.
-   Botchamania ends most of his videos with a video clip (not always wrestling related but almost always incorporating one of the series many Running Gags), and usually incorporates the audio/video clip of The Iron Sheik shouting "FUCK!"
-   The vidya gaems awards webpage showed among its categories "fattest developer". At the gala, this award seemed to have been skipped. Except it didn't.
-   "Ayla and the Networks" in the _Whateley Universe_: Chaka's last joke at the end of the story, and its aftermath.
-   _Neopets_: The day after the conclusion of the 2023 Faerie Festival, a comic appeared on the event's main page, revealing the villain behind Malkus Vile and hinting at events to come.

    Web Videos 

-   _The British Railway Stories_:
    -   Episode 14, Silent Night, had a scene after the end credits of Hawk pulling a train back to the Western Region of British Rail. It was then followed by text stating that GWR Class 94xx No. 9400, aka Hawk, is now preserved at the STEAM Museum in the old railway town, his spiritual home in Swindon.
    -   Episode 15, Day Of The Deltic, has Gronk going along the line and entering Leeds Central, where a bunch of steam engines are being cut up for scrapping.
-   _Chrontendo_ has had a few of these, starting from chrontendo episode 32 onwards and finishing with chrontendo episode 38 (with the exception of chrontendo episode 37). It was usually a fragment of a TV Show, Film or Music track that he was talking about in the episode itself.
-   The scene at the end of the credits of the _Star Trek: New Voyages_ episode "To Serve All My Days", which reveals that most of the entire episode was All Just a Dream.
-   _World's Greatest Adventures_ has used infrequent stingers to punctuate jokes from the episode proper. The Season 1 finale ends on a more sinister one, showing that Warlord Cassius is planning something.
-   The plot threads left hanging by the _lonelygirl15_ were arguably a sequel hook to begin with. But then, just when you think it's over, one more video is uploaded. We see the now-penultimate video being taped from a different angle, then at literally the last second, reveal the blogger to be none other than The Dragon...
-   We come back Tuesday
-   A few of the FailBlog videos did this by playing audio from part of the featured video over the credit screen.
-   Most of Ashens' review videos have one.
-   Gamescrap.com's _Action 52_ marathon review had these at the end of a few of their videos:
-   Wheezy Waiter usually has info about other videos he's been in, tours, or just bloopers.
-   LoadingReadyRun Videos often feature this, and EVERY video they've posted since moving to the Escapist has had a stinger, except for "Hot Water at PAX".
-   Before the video ends, Harley Morenstein of Epic Meal Time says, "Next time, we eat _x_".
-   Every episode of _Echo Chamber_ so far has had a stinger. Usually they are outtakes, but Episode 5 has one with actual plot relevance.
-   Played with at the end of some Bad Lip Reading videos. A shot already in the video proper is shown but with different lyrics, presumably from an earlier draft.
-   _Atop the Fourth Wall_
    -   Most episodes will sometimes have one after the credits roll, usually related to the current storyline or an alternate gag that couldn't fit into the review itself.
    -   In _Atop the Fourth Wall: The Movie_ feature two in a row. The first shows Mechakara's remains back on Europa, with mystical energy coming from his hand, hinting that the healing effect of the Plot Hole will eventually restore him back to life. It's soon followed up by returning to Linkara's birthday party, where everyone is staring in silence after the Cinema Snob showed them _Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom_.
-   The people of Channel Awesome always have a funny line from the review play over the Channel Awesome Vanity Plate.
-   In Bennett the Sage's _Devilman_ review, we were treated to a scene at the end where Bennett holds up the infamous, rare and uncut VHS version of _Violence Jack_ in hand, lamenting that many people want him to review it, but it's so rare, there's not even a torrent of it and plans to keep it that way, resulting in him throwing the tape off a bridge and into a river, fading to the credits. But there's still a minute or two left after credits. What do we get? VIOLENCE IS COMING. This might not be the last we seen of _Violence Jack_.
-   Phelous ended his _Jacob's Ladder_ review revealing that every review of his from the past five years has never really happened due to him dying at the end of first review, _Mac and Me_, resulting in him never leading go of his life, forced to keep reviewing shitty movies. He then accepted his death and we were treated to the last image of his death from his first episode before we cut to the credits, which was in complete silence unlike his other reviews. But then you start hearing what appears to be siren sounds in the background slowly increasing in volume before we're treated to a quick scene of Phelous' door and the door knocking.
-   _Noob_:
    -   Many episodes have one starting Season 2, with content that can be anything from an extra gag related to the episode to a small piece of actual story progression.
    -   _Noob: Le Conseil des Trois Factions_ has three seperate ones: Two are extra scenes with characters of the Third Line, Some Waiting plot, while the third has the narcoleptic character that had'nt been seen for the whole movie wake up and hope she didn't miss anything important.
-   In Matt Santoro's web series, when Matt does this, he thanks the viewer for watching the video, tells them to subscribe if they enjoyed the content, and tells them about his other internet accounts.
-   Many recent CinemaSins videos have these, and they enter YouTube Poop territory. They _do_ include footage from the movie that is being sinned, though.
-   Much like CinemaSins, some _Mystery Science Theater F1_ episodes have "musical fun" after the outro, where things that happened or are said by commentators during the race are placed with relevant songs.
-   Some episodes of _Binging with Babish_ include a short, amusing clip from the cooking process at the end, complete with the raw audio.

    -   Episode 3, From Dusk Till Dawn: Clay and Cojack are doing yard work while Dawn's at the works. Cojack isn't happy with it, while Clay suggests working to music. He then starts singing The Locomotion, to which Cojack responds that he never do that again.
    -   Episode 5, Nightmares: Atlas has a nightmare where he's on a turntable, surrounded by the Waterdown engines, who all have static in place of their faces.
