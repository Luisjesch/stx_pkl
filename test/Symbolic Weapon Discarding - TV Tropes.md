**Dalinar:** ...today, you and your men sacrificed to buy me twenty-six hundred priceless lives. And all I had to repay you with was a single priceless sword. I call that a bargain.  
**Kaladin:** You really think it was a good trade, don't you?  
**Dalinar:** For my honor? Unquestionably.

A character can be defined by their weapon(s) and what they do with them as much as by their personality and behavior. Thus, if that character is confronted with a decision that can have a major impact on their life and/or a particularly climactic outcome, they may display their attitude toward the decision by choosing to abandon that weapon, facing the decision and its consequences without that means of support. This is often done by leaving said weapon somewhere and traveling away, giving it to someone else, dramatically tossing it aside (especially during a confrontation), or even breaking it.

This can be symbolic of being Defiant to the End, as the character is willing to stand up and face what's coming with no means of defense. In the face of a decision that could lead the character to corruption, it can also signify their courage in not making that choice or, should they make the wrong choice, a reaction to a My God, What Have I Done? realization. On a more sinister note, it can also indicate a Start of Darkness or full-on Face–Heel Turn if the character gives up a weapon associated with their better aspects in order to acquire a weapon that is cursed or similarly wicked in nature, or is evocative of their dark side.

Compare:

-   Dramatic Drop: A character drops something (such as their weapon) after a shocking development.
-   Let's Fight Like Gentlemen: Characters agree to settle their differences in a mannerly fashion, such as setting aside weapons.
-   Passing the Torch: A hero turns their role over to someone else, which may involve turning over a weapon as well.

See also Sentimental Sacrifice, Symbolically Broken Object, and Throw the Sheath Away (which is narrowly symbolic of fighting to the last breath).

-   _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_: In "Victory and Death", Ahsoka leaves behind one of her lightsabers to make any pursuers think she died in the crash-landing of the ship she was on alongside everyone else.

Leaving behind the lightsaber also symbolically represents her leaving behind the Republic, which has now transformed into The Empire. In her next chronological appearance in _Star Wars Rebels_ she has built her own custom lightsabers and notably remarks that she is "no Jedi".
