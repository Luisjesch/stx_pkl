One way of demonstrating a being's wildness is for them to beat their chest while yelling. This might be combined with a Mighty Roar.

This is most often done by gorillas (killer or otherwise), or occasionally other primates like orangutans, chimpanzees, monkeys or ape-like cryptids. When a character that is not a gorilla does it, it is usually either to show that they feel as strong and mighty as a gorilla, or that they are as brutish and uncultured as an ape. It also may be Played for Laughs, when it is done by a small and/or weak character.

Two Stock Shout Outs often include chest pounding. One is a literal Shout Out to Tarzan, where the character lets out the ape-man's Signature Roar while beating his chest; the other is "King Kong" Climb, where the creature on top of the building (which is often a King Kong Copy) pounds its chest to recreate the iconic scene from _King Kong (1933)_.

In reality, gorillas may pound their chest for different purposes: as a display of dominance, as a release of stress, to warn neighbouring gorilla groups about their presence, and most notably, it is one of the nine phases of the ritualized fight between Silverbacks. Juvenile gorillas also beat their chests playfully. Also, it is usually inaccurately portrayed in media: real gorillas more often do it with open or cupped hands rather than clenched fists (which gorillas can't form, since their fingers are longer than their thumbs), which produces a sound that's less "thumping" and more "popping." Furthermore, they seldom vocalize while beating their chest, and when they do, it's more of a hooting or whinnying sound than a Mighty Roar. Other primates beside gorillas (and occasionally humans) hardly ever show this behaviour.

It might be part of a Victory Pose of a savage, brutish fighter, especially when combined with a Victorious Roar. Compare Stop Hitting Yourself where it's someone else who moved the hands of the victim to hit themself, Macho Masochism, when the character hurts themself in a much more painful way to show off their toughness, and All Drummers Are Animals, where a savage character drums on an instrument rather than their own chest. Contrast Breast Attack, when a character hits _someone else's_ chest in a fight.

-   In this bizarre Perfume Commercial for Kenzo World, directed by Spike Jonze, a woman played by Margaret Qualley ends her three-minute Deranged Dance by fiercely pounding on her chest.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Ape Admin from the TBS version of _Aggretsuko_ does this when she gets upset or excited, as one of the many Furry Reminders the series uses as jokes. Commendably, she explains in one episode that she's using the palms of her hands to do it.
-   _Dragon Ball Z_:
    -   Gohan beats on his chest at the first time he becomes oozaru (giant ape); unlike Vegeta and the other Saiyans raised in their native planet, he never was trained to keep his sentience during the transformation and is dominated by pure instinct.
    -   The final form of Majin Buu, Kid Buu, does this before his final fight with Goku and Vegeta. Humorously, he continues pounding his chest even as Goku kicks him in the face and sends him flying into a cliff. There's no particular reason for him doing this — he's just completely off his rocker.
-   In _Kemono Friends_ Season 2, Western Lowland Gorilla makes her debut appearance pounding her chest to get the attention of her bickering followers. Commendably, she does this with her open hands and palms instead of her fists, and it produces a "popping" sound rather than "thumping".
-   _Pokémon: The Series_:
    -   In the short "Pikachu's Vacation" at one point Ash's Charizard is taking a nap when Pikachu and a Raichu come up running and step on his tail, startling him awake. He pounds on his chest while blowing flames before chasing after them.
    -   In _Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire_, Norman's Slaking does this over the course of his battle against Ash's Grovyle. The giant mechanical Slaking in "Slaking Kong" also does it in his introduction scene.
-   A Running Gag Episode 10 of _Suite Pretty Cure ♪_, notably once by Hibiki to entertain the children she's in charge of.
-   In _Toriko_, this is invoked during the Rainbow Fruit arc: as they reach the Biotope where the fruit grows, the heroes hear a loud banging noise, which Toriko correctly interprets as the local "boss of the Biotope", the Troll Kong, beating his chest to intimidate intruders. Toriko simply causes a bigger noise by thumping his own chest as an answer to the Troll Kong's challenge.
-   In _Zoids: Chaotic Century_, Iron Kong Zoids are sometimes seen pounding their chests before attacking.

    Asian Animation

    -   Fat Doc and Slim Doc pound their chest while morphed into a gorilla in "Shape Shift".
    -   In "Animal X", the gorilla in the cage Fat Doc brings to the lab pounds his chest at one point.
-   Wolffy does one in _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf: Mighty Little Defenders_ episode 27 when he states he would like to stay a wolf rather than be a dog, and howls to punctuate his wolf nature.

    Comic Books 

-   _The Defenders_: In the 2005 mini-series, after Namor beats the living daylights out of Dormammu's goons, Dr. Strange asks if he can release him "before he'll start beating his chest and bellowing like a bull ape", in a critic to Namor excessive aggression and lack of manners. It worths noting that arc was written by Keith Giffen and J. M. De Matteis, the responsibles for the Justice League's sarcastic/humoristic phase in the 80s.
-   The Marsupilami, being a monkey-like critter, sometimes does this. One _Spirou & Fantasio_ story also has the Marsupilami encounter a gorilla, who proceeds to do the typical chest-beating and tree-ripping intimidation display. Subverted in that the gorilla ends up too exhausted to fight back.
-   _Monica's Gang_: In a 70s story, an extra working as a gorilla in a movie gets amnesiac when a heavy bag falls on his head; a poster parodying _King Kong (1976)_ makes him think he is King Kong. He runs from the studio, climbs on Jimmy and Smudge's club, does some chest-beating, then kidnaps Monica, taking her for Dean (Jessica Lange). Despite the attempts of Maggy and the boys to make the "gorilla" step down, the club crashes under his weight and Monica's; the fall returns his memories and he is dragged back to the movie by the director, who is impressed by the extra's feral "performance". Monica and Maggy think that everything ended up well, but Jimmy and Smudge, furious about their destroyed club, run after the girls howling and beating their chests.
-   _Tintin_: In "Tintin: The Black Island", an old man tells Tintin about a monster that "devours" everyone who dares set foot on the Black Island; to prove his story, they hear a distant, drumming sound at night. He eventually finds out that the "monster" is Ranko, a gorilla trained as an Attack Animal by the villains and the strange sound that terrified the villagers was Ranko beating his chest. Quite impressive that they could hear him from so far away.

    Comic Strips 

    Films — Animation 

-   _Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit_: The eponymous beast does this in the forest — while howling like a wolf — which incites all the normal garden bunnies to imitate him.
-   In _Tarzan_, Kerchak does it on two occasions: first when getting enraged about Kala adopting Tarzan, and second when he menaces Jane in the human camp. In a rare case of Shown Their Work, he does it with open hands. Tarzan also does it in the closing shot of the movie (with clenched fists) while letting out his Signature Roar.
-   In _Rio 2_, Tiago, the rambunctious parrot nestling beats his chest in excitement about going to a wild place like the Amazon.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Tarzan is sometimes shown doing this while performing the "Tarzan Yell", as the title character does in _Tarzan, the Ape Man_ (1981), as seen here. This is carried over from the books (see Literature).
-   King Kong, being a giant gorilla, does this from time to time; most iconically after defeating the giant reptile (_Tyrannosaurus rex_ / giant snake / V-rex), and when fighting the planes on top of the building.
-   Multiple characters do it in in _George of the Jungle_, including Ape the ape when he pretends that he's an unintelligent, non-talking animal, George as part of his courtship display to Ursula, and a monkey (named Little Monkey) when fending off a lion. See the last one here.
-   Dian Fossey does this in _Gorillas in the Mist_ when she imitates the gorillas' behavior to blend in with the group. The scene is a bit of a Fridge Logic, considering that chest-beating often means a display of dominance or a challenge to fight — probably not the best idea when you are trying to earn the trust of a 300-pound silverback.
-   Peewee does this (complete with Tarzan Yodel) to celebrate Sex as Rite-of-Passage at the end of _Porky's_.
-   _Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams_: The Spider Monkey pounds its chest like a gorilla at the end of the movie.

-   _The Jack Benny Program_ (the TV version): Benny does a very wimpy, pathetic version in a sketch where he plays Tarzan. Jane (played by Guest Star Carol Burnett) fares much better minus the chest pound - her doing the Tarzan yell later became a Running Gag during the audience Q&A segment of _The Carol Burnett Show_.
-   _Hyakujuu Sentai Gaoranger_ / _Power Rangers Wild Force_: Gao Gorilla / the Green Gorillazord does this when summoned.

    Real Life 

-   The traditional New Zealand dance "haka", traditionally performed by Maori warriors and popularized by the rugby team "All Blacks", includes slapping one's chest and yelling.
-   Truth in Television as gorillas do this in real life as an intimidation display. According to a 2021 study, gorillas can use this to signal their size and strength to each other, as larger gorillas' chest beats will produce lower frequency sounds compared to smaller ones. Never do this in front of a gorilla, though, as they will take it as a challenge and probably kill you. As pointed out in the description, they usually do it with open hands rather than clenched fists.
-   Harbor seals repeatedly slap their belly with their fins as a threat display toward other seals and humans that come too close. It functions the same as a gorilla's chest-beating, but from a human point of view it looks a lot less impressive due to the seals' chubby physique and general lack of mobility on land.
