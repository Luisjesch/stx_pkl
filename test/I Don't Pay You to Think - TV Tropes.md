**Fezzik:** I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.  
**Vizzini:** Am I going mad, or did the word "think" escape your lips? You were _not_ hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass!

A Stock Phrase that indicates that an employee wasn't hired for their brains; they were put on the team to follow the leader's orders without a debate.

Sometimes, it's important to think on your feet or challenge instructions. A mind is a terrible thing to waste and a little brains can take you a long way. But people in authority sometimes fear those with a brain in their head. After all, someone who thinks is someone who may start to question authority, _their_ authority. The basic idea is that someone in a lowly position gets a bright idea, but is told that either they're not paid to think, or that it's not their job to think, or some other form of that. Might be a low-level employee in a company, or it could be a minion or mook to the Big Bad.

To some degree, Truth in Television; many large organizations, such as the military and police depend on everyone sticking to the same plan, adhering to protocol, and and following orders. It isn't rarely feasible to convince or fully explain it to each and every person involved, so acting on individual decision-making instead of instructions can undermine your organization's larger goals. A soldier who questioned procedures and plans too much and doesn't obey orders is considered a liability. It's worth pointing out that despite the listed benefits of groups following the same plan, a good critique or idea shouldn't just be thrown away carelessly.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

In the end, however, bosses who hold to this philosophy only have themselves to blame when they find themselves Surrounded by Idiots. If this is common in your work place, it's one of the sure signs your boss is unfit for the job. Those who adhere to this are Mean, Bad, and/or a Pointy-Haired Boss, The Neidermeyer, and Control Freak (especially them). A Benevolent Boss and A Father to His Men on the other hand will not only defy this, but will encourage their subordinates to speak their mind as they see it as a sign of healthy relationship.

If the boss or Big Bad is seriously annoyed by this thinking behavior, he may demote said employee/minion to an _even lowlier_ position, fire them (sometimes literally), or tell them You, Get Me Coffee.

May occasionally be responded with "You don't pay me at all" by those who work for free.

Note that actual payment, or non-payment as the case may be, need not necessarily be involved - "I don't pay you to think" is in many cases just as much an attitude as it is a phrase actually spoken out loud.

Can overlap with I Warned You if the villain disregards something their henchman was trying to tell them, and it ends up being fatal. If your role is a Yes-Man, then you can simply assume that this is true and shouldn't need to have it said to you.

A subtrope of Blind Obedience. See also, Don't Think, Feel.

Contrast Screw the Rules, I'm Doing What's Right!, which too much of this trope can ultimately lead to, as well as Mistreatment-Induced Betrayal.

After the captain leaves, Roran implements his own strategy, but warns that everyone in his group may be made to take the punishment. All follow him and he ends up killing nearly 200 enemy forces through his own strength, secures the victory, and ends up rescuing the idiot captain and what few soldiers of his own he has remaining. Afterwards, Roran is stripped of his weapon and left for appropriate punishment. Upon return to the Varden, Roran is hailed by a hero, but still ordered that he must take 100 lashes if he wishes to remain with the Varden, the Varden's leader Nasuada explaining that his punishment must be severe and must be public, or else others will believe they too can disobey orders and the chain of command will break down. Afterwards, she promotes him to captain, as he is too valuable to lose, and this way she can be sure that the only orders he can disobey are _hers_, which had better only happen if it's in the process of directly killing Galbatorix.

-   _\[PROTOTYPE\]_: Said word for word by General Randall. Hilariously, he says it _to a scientist_. Then Alex Mercer says this to himself when a scientists questions how he feels about making a deadly virus 10 times more deadly. Pretty much to show how much of an emotionless jerk he is.
    
    **Dr. Mercer**: I wasn't paid to feel.
    
-   _Ratchet & Clank (2002)_: Supreme Executive Chairman Drek gets the gist of the phrase across when berating Captain Qwark for failing to dispose of the titular duo at the end of the first act.

Unfortunately, he is confronted with an automated voice mail system that asks him to say options "1" through "3". He chooses "4", which throws the people at Videlectrix for a loop, resulting in this phrase being mentioned, accidentally revealing that the voice mail system was a fake to screw with Strong Bad.
-   In _God of War Ragnarök_ this basically sums up Odin and Thor's relationship; Odin treats his son like a mindless attack dog. In the climax of the game, when Thor finally stands up for himself, Odin tells him off, calling him broken and saying that he exists to serve his father. Thor manages one more defiant sentence before Odin fatally stabs him through the chest.

However, it turns out that Ms. Walsh was hired to teach this class precisely for her incompetence, because a credible adult authority figure would derail the experiment on the class.

    -   At one point, Tagon tries this line on Ennesby, a small floating Artificial Intelligence who serves as his adjutant. Ennesby immediately shoots back that, by definition, his job as an adjutant _is to think_, "and when you get right down to it, I'm better at it than you are". Technically he doesn't get paid either.
    -   Inverted in this strip, where commander Andreyasn reacts to a thought from Lt. Ventura:

-   From Not Always Right: "When Crazy Requests Reach The Stratosphere" - "You’re not paid to think, so just put a new satellite up." "But ma'am, that would take several months and millions of dollars!" "You and I both know that's not true; I expect it up by tonight, and it better not affect my bill."
-   _Forbes_ placed it at the top of a 2014 article of "10 Things Only Lousy Managers Say."
-   According to Oleg Gordievsky, part of the reason NATO's 1983 Able Archer 83 exercises (simulating a gradual build-up of military readiness then-unprecedented in scale) soiled the Soviet leadership's collective pants so thoroughly was that under Operation RYaN KGB agents stationed in Western Europe were ordered only to report their observations, _not_ their analysis. This meant that the increasingly isolated and paranoid Soviet leadership got the reports of on-the-ground evidence suggesting that NATO was about ready to launch a massive nuclear first strike<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  on the USSR, but not the accompanying skepticism by those best in position to know (i.e., the reporting KGB agents in the West who best understood Western thinking) that NATO was actually about to start World War III. Though born of paranoia rather than pride, several nuclear-capable Warsaw Pact units and possibly Soviet ICBMs were ordered to prepare a "pre-emptive" first strike as a result. (It should be noted that Gordievsky, the highest-ranking KGB agent to ever defect to the West, is the West's main source about this episode - grains of salt should be taken according to taste.)
-   Unfortunately, some parents and teachers are known to do this to their families / students, telling them to just do as they're told (without question), which ultimately teaches nothing, and helps no one. This especially applies to the more abusive ones, but mostly happens with the ones who either don't know any better, don't understand what they're doing, are otherwise not in their right minds, or who otherwise are just that ignorant. This can especially apply to those who (still, even today) think they're always right, because they are "smarter" / have lived longer / have had more experiences / other similar explanations.
-   As explained earlier, this also applies to some senior military and / or law enforcement officers who think that "following orders" is ultimately a soldier / police officer's only purpose in life. Some even try to justify it with the "thinking will only get you killed" / "teamwork" explanations. While there is plenty of merit in being able to follow orders and work as a unit, the ability to think on one's feet can be absolutely crucial to survival in a FUBAR situation where chain of command breaks down.
