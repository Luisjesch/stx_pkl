It's the end of the movie and The Drifter has to be moving on. There are other people in trouble, other wrongs to right, other paths to follow. He saddles up his horse and rides west into the setting sun. The townspeople look on as his figure, silhouetted against the orange disk, disappears into the horizon. The music swells and "The End" appears.

Riding into the sunset is a tried (some would say "tired") and true ending to a show. Primarily a western trope associated with cowboys, but not exclusively so. The setting sun is symbolic of the end of the story.

Sometimes, heroes are known to ride into the _sunrise_ instead — possibly as a symbol of a new beginning or fresh start on life after their adventure is over, or possibly to show that the scriptwriters realize that setting off into the wilderness at sunset is not the brightest idea. (What's he gonna do? Go two miles out of town and then make camp for the night?) Of course, the sunset _is_ somewhat cooler, so a little Artistic License is allowed. In fact, the sunset is so expected that using the more pragmatic sunrise in a Western might be jarring. Besides, riding into the sunset means you're riding West. A common theme in Westerns was the "taming of the West", so there was often an implication that once one town had been "civilized" the hero would then ride farther West to where he was still needed. In stories where the hero has somewhere specific and not too distant to go and rest up, though, leaving at the end of the day makes perfect sense.

A subtrope of Off-into-the-Distance Ending, may utilized "Back to Camera" Pose.

Compare Against the Setting Sun, Partly Cloudy with a Chance of Death (for a darker ending), Watching the Sunset. Contrast Outrun the Fireball. See also Romantic Ride Sharing if it's a couple of lovers riding together into the sunset.

    Asian Animation 

-   _Happy Heroes_: Referenced in Season 2 episode 16. Big and Little M. are walking away from the school and into the sunset when Little M. mentions that he's only seen this happening in movies and that it's rather old-fashioned. Big M. says that it's actually a _sunrise_ and that it's not old-fashioned.

    Comic Books 

-   _Lucky Luke_: Every single adventure ends this way. In the metastory "Where the sunset is" the Dalton brothers try to avoid capture by keeping away from civilization and hiding out in the wilderness. All to no avail as the place they choose to hang out turns out to be Luke's "riding into the sunset" place. Apparently sunset is a place, not a time.
-   _ElfQuest_: The end of issue #7has two Wolfrider elves, appropriately enough, riding wolves into the sunset. It's worth noting that since Wolfriders are generally nocturnal, sunset is an appropriate time for them to set out.
-   At the end of _Preacher_, Jesse reveals he never wanted to be a preacher as a kid. His girlfriend asks him what he wanted to be. "Girl, can't you guess?" he says, as they ride on a horse towards the sunset.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic (IDW)_: The last panel of "The Return of Queen Chrysalis" ends with the main characters setting off into the sunset. Parodied, since the riders are their own mounts.
-   Wolverine's death is done as a variation.

    -   Someone gets dragged back into a saloon all burnt up because "the damn fool tried to ride off into the sunset."
    -   Another has a cowboy is riding off into a cardboard-stand/cutout of a sunset, whilst various people wave. The caption reads 'The embarrassment of riding into a fake sunset'.

    Fan Works 

-   _God Help the Outcasts_: Discussed and invoked at the end. When the monsters start to fly back to the base, Monger steers Butterflyasaurus in the direction of the setting sun. Dr. Cockroach points out that they're going the wrong way, but Monger insists that heroes always go into the sunset, and that they'll change direction when they're out of sight.
-   In the _Outlaw Star_ fanfic _A Fistful of Dragonite_ this is how the Five-Man Band end their story, doubled up on a trio of horses and off to live at least _somewhat_ Happily Ever After.
-   _Tales of the Canterlot Deportation Agency_: From _A Typical Day_: How the tale ends, but with walking, not riding:
    
    "It's a nice sunset — good color palette, some nice cloud touches, very artistic work — let's head towards it for a while."
    
-   In _Everybody's Gotta Leave Sometime_, the _Peanuts_ gang have their final get-together to discuss the end of the comic-strip and say farewell to each other, possibly forever. As the sun is setting, all characters say their goodbyes to Charlie Brown one after another and then leave.
    
    Patty took one step, then another, and others in succession, over the field as the shadows lengthened and the sun's corona was barely visible in the distance.
    
-   _The Ending of the End - Love and Tolerance Edition_ ends on the now more less Reformed But Untamed Legion of Doom walking into the sunset alongside each other.

    Films — Animated 

-   At the end of _Aladdin_, after their Final Love Duet Aladdin and Jasmine fly off on carpet into the horizon against the _moon_ rather than the sun but the effect is visually the same sort of shorthand. Genie then takes over the moon and turns it around laughing revealing his face, lifts up the "The End" cel on the film reel and says "Made you look!" before we get the credits.
-   Done in _An American Tail: Fievel Goes West_ as a bit of a tribute to this trope, when Wylie Burp walks off into the sunset after the final battle and Fievel follows him, and they sit on a rocky outcropping and talk while watching the sunset. It works on a meta-level, too; the scene is Jimmy Stewart's last in his final film role.
-   This has happened in every _Cars_ film so far:
    -   The first film ends with Lightning and Sally racing each other back to Radiator Springs, while Mater flies by in the Dinoco helicopter.
    -   The second film ends with Lightning and Mater speeding off into the distance as Siddley winks at the camera and flies away, before the view irises out.
    -   The third film ends with Lightning and Cruz racing each other around Willy's Butte. In a rare inversion, it is sunset, but they speed away and then come toward the screen before the credits start, making this a case of Riding Away From the Sunset.
-   At the end of _The Good, the Bad, and Huckleberry Hound_, Huck rides into the moon singing "By the Light of the Silvery Moon", only when the narrator reveals he actually starts raising a family at the farm _after_ that. The scene is Daws Butler's last in his final titular role.
-   In _Monsters vs. Aliens_, the monsters fly off into the sunset on their way to their next mission.
-   Lampshaded in _Rango_:
    
    **Priscilla**: It’s the sunset scene.
    
-   _The Road to El Dorado_ ends with Chel, Miguel, and Tulio riding off into the sunset... well, at least Chel rides off, as Miguel and Tulio fell off Altivo just before he started running.
-   In _Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas_, Sinbad, Marina, and his crew are sailing into the sunset in the last shot of the film.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Blazing Saddles_ parodied this by having the heroes get off of their horses and into a car, driving off into the sunset at the end of the film.
-   _Forklift Driver Klaus_: After causing several serious injuries and fatalities (including his own) after a disastrous first day on the job, the now headless Klaus rides out of the factory on his forklift with coworkers Rudi and Paul impaled on the forks. The film ends with the three of them heading off into the sunset, leaving behind a workplace that has experienced several serious injuries and fatalities.
-   _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_ ends with Indy, his father, Sallah, and Marcus riding into the sunset. Spielberg said this was done with the expectation that this would be the last _Indiana Jones_ film.
    
    **Spielberg:** I'm done with the series!<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    
-   Variation in _Legend (1985)_. Jack and Lili walk off together into the sunset in one version of the film. In the director's cut, Jack walks off by himself while Lili goes to her castle.
-   _Wild Wild West_: plays with this at the end. It appears that Jim West and Artemus Gordon are riding off into the sunset on horses... until the camera pulls back to reveal they are riding Loveless' giant mechanical spider. Also, since they were traveling from Utah to Washington D.C. they were actually going east, into the sunrise.
-   In _Slither_ the main characters are seen walking off into the sunrise at the end of the film whilst the credits roll up.
-   _X-Men Origins: Wolverine_ includes this near the end — before a subversion. Logan/Wolverine and Kayla are walking off into the sunset — and a gunshot rings out as Stryker arrives with his adamantium bullets...
-   Played with the sunrise version in Sam Peckinpah's _Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid_ where Garrett rides off - although it was a sunset when they were shooting it, but it's dawn in the movie. It doesn't symbolise a new beginning: Garrett's life is completely ruined, nothing left except remorse and loneliness. It symbolizes the death of the Old West and also the whole genre.
-   The title characters do this at the end of the film _¡Three Amigos!!_.
-   At the end of _Shock Treatment_ (the semi-sequel to _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_), as the good guys are driving off in a car, the narrator remarks "The sun never sets on those who ride into it".
-   The Russian ostern _The Elusive Avengers_. Its authors were fond of this trope. All three movies end with this. There are also a _beginning_, when the title team rides FROM the sunset.
-   The ending of _The Green Berets_ infamously features John Wayne's character walking onto a beach and into the sunset with the adorable little Vietnamese moppet that had accompanied his unit in the latter stages of the film....on a beach on the South China Sea, which faces east, meaning it would actually be impossible to observe a sunset on that beach.
-   Used in _The Men Who Stare at Goats_. The main character's mentor (George Clooney) and his mentor's mentor (Jeff Bridges) fly a helicopter off into the sunset and are never seen again.
-   The ending of _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country_ has the Enterprise sailing towards a star, signifying the end of the _Star Trek_ featuring only the original cast.
-   Parodied in _Hot Shots! Part Deux_, where the helicopter flies into the sunset from the side, then turns and flies _into_ the sun, smoking as it comes out the other end.
-   The ending of _Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl_: "Now, bring me that horizon."
-   Also parodied by Ellen Degeneres in _Mr. Wrong_: She and the main love interest are walking into the sunset before realizing that they're walking west and they have to turn north to get to the US-Mexico border, It's a Long Story. She even comments on how the sunset is a bit blinding.
-   Somewhat surprisingly, The Movie of _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ ends this way as well, with Buffy and Pike roaring off toward the horizon on Pike's motorcycle in a romantic scene as Susanna Hoffs's cover of "We Close Our Eyes" plays. (In this example the sun has already set, but it still fits.)
-   And even the mostly tough and unsentimental gangland melodrama _The Warriors_ ends happily, with the surviving heroes frolicking in the surf on the beach off Coney Island before disappearing over the horizon just as the sun is coming up.
-   _The Warrior's Way_ ends with the hero, Yang, having slain all his enemies in a lengthy showdown and saving the entirety of Lode Town, walking away into the setting sun in slo-mo. Then comes a Time Skip where he somehow goes from a midwestern American desert town into an Arctic wasteland.
-   In _Daybreakers_, they are driving off into the sunrise. Given that the movie is about vampires and one of the characters found a way to turn back into a human, this has additional symbolic value.
-   The 1912 film _The Land Beyond the Sunset_ features a little boy drifting on a boat into the sunset, fleeing an abusive home. Since he's in an open boat with nothing to eat or drink and doesn't even have an oar or a sail, this is either an allegory of rebirth or Driven to Suicide.
-   Both variants are a very common _Godzilla_ trope with many movies ending with Godzilla swimming out to sea after saving the day.
-   At the end of _Furious 7_, Paul Walker's character Brian drives a white Toyota Supra off into the sunset after a final drag race with Dom. It was a poignant send-off for the actor and was a nice way of handling Real Life Writes the Plot.
-   The last shot of _The Book of Eli_ is the female lead character walking off into the sunset.
-   In _She Wore a Yellow Ribbon_ this trope is subverted. After the main conflict of the film is resolved, the film narrator describes Nathan Brittle as going where old men go, west, with a vivid image of him riding towards the Sunset (a John Ford Image), until a soldier catches up with him and he is informed that his career is not over, so the movie does not end with him riding into the sunset.
-   _Star Wars_:
    -   _The Empire Strikes Back_': By the end of the movie, Luke, Leia, C-3PO, and R2-D2 watch the _Millennium Falcon_ fly, not into a sunset (they're in space), but in the direction of a bright protostar, on their way to rescue Han Solo, who had been captured and handed over to Jabba The Hutt.
    -   _The Rise of Skywalker_ ends with a shot of Rey and BB-8 on Tatooine, walking into the distance with their silhouettes visible against the planet's two setting suns.
-   _L: change the WorLd_: More like "walking into the sunset". L does this in the film's final minutes, as he realizes that he wanted to live longer.
-   The _Superman_ movies starring Christopher Reeve and Brandon Routh all end with Superman flying above Earth towards the sunrise.
-   "Goodbye _Mary Poppins_, don't stay away too long," says Bert the chimney sweep as the titular nanny flies away on her umbrella after her work is done with the Banks family.
-   Lampshaded when _Bloodshot (2020)_ ends with the characters driving off into the sunset, and one of them worries that it's too cliched and they might be stuck in another simulation.
-   _Death Race_ appears to end this way, only for the 'sunset' to be a rather tattered billboard in a car wrecking yard where the protagonists are hiding out after escaping from prison.
-   _Top Gun: Maverick_ ends with Maverick flying off with Penny Benjamin in his P-51 Mustang.
-   _Battletruck_ ends with Hunter riding into the sunset on horseback, promising Corlie and the others that he will return in due time.
-   _For a Few Dollars More_: Colonel Mortimer does so in the last scene, although the absolute final shot is Manco driving off in a different direction (north, apparently).

    Literature 

-   The ending narration of _All the Pretty Horses_ plays this trope dead straight:
    
    _The bloodred dust blew down out of the sun. He touched the horse with his heels and rode on. He rode with the sun coppering his face and the red wind blowing out of the west across the evening land and the small desert birds flew chittering among the dry bracken and horse and rider and horse passed on and their long shadows passed in tandem like the shadow of a single being. Passed and paled into the darkening land, the world to come._
    
-   _Amelia Peabody_ Invoked by M. de Morgan in "The Mummy Case." He returns the protagonists' son after a truly minor escapade, and then rides his magnificent horse off into the sunset, despite having dinner plans in the exact opposite direction. The parents in question think that he's being over-dramatic.
-   _Deathlands: Homeward Bound_. Ryan Cawdor turns down the chance to rule the barony from which he was outlawed years before, and his True Companions drive off into the sunset Forbidden Zone in their Sec Wag.
-   _The Dreamside Road_: The Aesir flies into the sunset at the end of the Wintertide Festival. Enoa and Orson are publicly honored and Orson's theme music is performed for the first time, as they leave.
-   Parodied in _Where's Wally? In Hollywood_, which has a rider crashing through a painted backdrop of a setting sun.
-   The end of _Kitty and the Dead Man's Hand_. Which doesn't make a lot of sense since the car's a rental, their luggage is back at the hotel, they're going the wrong way to get home, and it can't be much later than noon. But hey, it's the thought that counts...
-   One of the "Star Trek" novels, in which the plot revolves around colonists' ambitious project to set their tidally-locked planet rotating, ends with Kirk ordering an odd departure course. When questioned, he explains: "Considering all the work we've done to create a sunset, it's only fitting that we fly off into it."
-   At the end of the novelization of _Revenge of the Sith_, Obi-Wan heads off into Tatooine's Binary Sunset, after dropping off the infant Luke Skywalker with the Larses.
-   In _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_ the Weasley twins ride off into "the glorious sunset" when they leave Umbridge sputtering furiously behind at Hogwarts. It's not the end of the book, but it is the end of the chapter and of Fred and George's student life.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ has an episode ''A Fistful of Datas'' with a Western in the holodeck, and at the end, the starship flies off towards a star whose lower half is obscured by the planet.
-   _Red Dwarf_ ended its Western-themed episode, "Gunmen of the Apocalypse", with Starbug doing the same (a star, not a supernova).
-   Subverted in _Supernatural_. At the end of "Hollywood Babylon", Sam and Dean walk away silhouetted against a stunning sunset as Herb Alpert's "Green Peppers" plays. The sunset is then wheeled away and revealed to be a backdrop, with the real sunset behind it.
-   Parodied in _Friends_: Joey gets a gig giving free aftershave samples out when a rival, dressed as a cowboy starts to invade his turf. In the end, we see Joey (who by this stage is selling the same cowboy-branded aftershave) _walking_ with the girl towards a wall-painting of a sunset.
    -   The entire episode is a parody of Western tropes, with Joey as the good cowboy and his rival as the bad cowboy, complete with colour-coded outfits.
    -   The director Kevin Bright also talks about this in the commentary for the Grand Finale, saying he wanted to end with the gang going off into the sunset together. (It's actually a hallway but the sentiment is certainly there).
-   The fourth season of _24_ ended with Jack Bauer walking away into the sunrise with the intent of starting a new life. Of course, he comes back for the next season.
-   In an episode of _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ a customer is talking to a clerk about purchasing an ending to the episode:
    
    **Clerk:** Walking into the sunset?  
    **Customer:** What's that one?  
    **Clerk:** You know, two lone figures silhouetted against the dying rays of the setting sun, the music swells and lovely... (music covers dialog)  
    **Customer:** No.  
    **Clerk:** Pity, I rather like that one.
    
-   Variation in _Battlestar Galactica_: the eponymous ship and the remaining ships of the civilian fleet fly into the sun, while the Original Series' theme music plays.
-   _Only Fools and Horses_: The ending of "Time On Our Hands", which John Sullivan wanted to be the last-ever episode, before it was renewed for another set of Christmas episodes; the idea was that during this sequence, Del, Rodney, and Albert would be replaced by cartoon versions of themselves.
-   Lampshaded in (another show called) _Legend_. The writer-turned-cowboy hero and his inventor buddy are looking at the sunset. The buddy asks "Shouldn't you be riding off into that?" The hero says "Yeah. It's a device of the genre. They have to end that way."
-   _Hollyoaks_ had fun with this trope by giving the couple Jon Paul and Craig a riding off into the sunset ending - by having them kiss in front of a holiday poster bearing a sunset before getting on a train together.
-   _Veronica Mars_ has a symbolic variation. Veronica walks away into the rain, signifying the consequences of the series finale being rather crappy (her Dad's facing charges that could land him serious jail time for protecting her, and their primary opponent for her Dad's old job as Sheriff is a corrupt puppet of the mafia). As the camera pans out, we get the impression that Veronica is upset not only because she inadvertently got her Dad in trouble, but because she knows she'll never change her ways.
-   _The Goodies_ episode spoofing movies has The End words catching on our heroes clothes, carrying them off across a classic movie sunset (and yes, one of the movies genres being spoofed was The Western).
-   Parodied on _General Hospital_. After Ned and Lois reconcile, he has a dream of them doing just this. . .and then tearing through the fake backdrop.
-   In _Power Rangers Wild Force_, Jindrax and Toxica walked off into the sunset after helping the Rangers save the Princess.
-   The series premiere of _Touched by an Angel_ ends with Monica and Tess driving off in a red convertible. The series finale ends with Monica driving off in the same way.
-   Inevitably in _The Mandalorian_ given that it's a Space Western, but the final episode of Season One has a subversion where the title character flies his spacecraft off in the direction of the sunset...then the camera pans over to Moff Gideon's crashed TIE fighter which he cuts his way out, and the final shot is of Moff Gideon standing before the sunset brandishing the Darksaber he used to do so.
-   _Sense8_: In the first season finale Riley and Will narrowly escape the Evil, Inc. that's hunting sensates. The final shot of the episode is them sitting on the deck of Riley's friend's boat, which is carrying them out of Iceland, as it sails towards the setting sun.
-   _The Rising_: In a variation, Neve rides off on her motor bike into the distance right at the end of the series, to the afterlife, with the sun making its ascent.

    Magazines 

-   The very last issue of ZX Spectrum magazine _Your Sinclair_ had this for the back cover. Two cowboys riding off into the sunset, guns aloft, with the Your Sinclair logo at the bottom, and beneath it five small words: "Our work here is done."

    Music 

-   At the end of the video for "Give It Away", the Red Hot Chili Peppers run off into the sunset.
-   Mentioned at the beginning of AC/DC's "T.N.T.": "See me ride into the sunset/On your color TV screen."
-   In the Kansas song "Miracles Out of Nowhere," the lyrics in the pseudo-bridge: "I just play and then I go/ Off into the sunset like the western heroes do."
-   "Micha" by Die Ärzte is a lonesome cowboy parody - sunset riding is mandatory.
-   Parodied in the music video for Thumpasaurus's video for "Struttin'." In the end, after strutting away from the altar, the Strutman simply struts away in the setting sun as the whole town waves goodbye.
-   At the end of the video for Darude's "Sandstorm", the three characters boat into the sunset.

    Pinball 

-   Defeat the evil genie in _Tales of the Arabian Nights_, and the game will show the player and the princess flying into the sunset on a Flying Carpet.

    Radio 

-   In _Cabin Pressure_, the final episode ends with Douglas and Herc being forced to fly into the sun, rising each time it appears to set (in a Call-Back to an earlier episode). Douglas declares "I hate flying into the sunset."
-   _The Brewing Network_ The episode simply titled 'D Day', which was the farewell for Session regular Daniela. She had gotten a job in her native Germany and this meant leaving the show. At times it became a real Tear Jerker.

    Tabletop Games 

-   Hero Rides Away, a freelancer Charm from _Exalted_, allows you to regain power and create gratitude among the villagers you just saved by, well, riding off in some dramatic fashion, like having your horse rear up against the sunset or departing at the height of a thunderstorm. Of course, there's nothing preventing you from using this in the frozen North or verdant East rather than the desiccated South, meaning you can be a cowboy-movie hero _while riding a simhata<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  on a glacier_.

    Theatre 

-   The fourth act of _The Girl of the Golden West_ shows the sun beginning to rise on the Girl and her lover, who are leaving the West behind to start a new life.
-   In _Moonlight And Magnolias_, screenwriter Ben Hecht and director Victor Fleming _want_ to end _Gone with the Wind_ with Rhett and Scarlett riding into the sunset together, rather than stay with Margaret Mitchell's more uncertain finish. David Selznick, the producer, is tempted but vetoes the idea.
-   _Finale_ has an interesting variation. The show ends with the cast walking into the burning sunset, as they walk to their deaths.

    Video Games 

-   _Fallout_ and _Fallout2_ begin their ending cinematics with footage of the player character walking off into the desert.
-   Both the opening and ending of _Sunset Riders_ has the cowboy heroes ride their horses towards the sunset, to the surprise of absolutely nobody.
-   The Bad Ending of _Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards_ is a Warpstar Into The Sky.
-   In _Kirby's Dream Land_, as well as in "Spring Breeze" in _Kirby Super Star_, the credits play as a giant Kirby is floating with King Dedede's castle towards the sunset.
-   Also in _Kirby Super Star/Ultra_, after Kirby escapes from the sinking Halberd on a Wheelie Bike, he is shown riding off into the sunset.
-   A riding into the _sunrise_ variant occurs in the ending of _Metal Gear Solid_ in which Snake and another character (either Meryl or Otacon) ride a snowmobile in the direction of the Alaskan sun.
-   Ben, the protagonist of _Full Throttle_, rumbles off on his bike into a beautiful sunset.
-   The last campaign of _Left 4 Dead_, "Blood Harvest," ends with the survivors getting into a military APC, which then drives off into the sunrise.
-   _Mass Effect_ ends with the Normandy flying away from the camera into the sunrise of an unknown gas giant.
    -   _Mass Effect 2_ ends similarly, though the Normandy is flying towards a gaseous orange nebula this time.
    -   _Mass Effect 3_ drives the point home in the Extended Cut. After the Normandy crashes on an unknown planet, the team repairs it and flies into the sunset.
-   _Max Payne 3_ ends on one of these, with the title character walking off into the sunset of a beach in Bahia, Brazil.
-   _Red Dead Redemption_ despite being a game based on Westerns has a bit of fun with both subverting and playing this trope straight. Since John Marston dies at Ross's hands at the end of the game he doesn't have the tried and true riding off into the sunset happy ending where we know his adventuring days will continue, the game doesn't even get a proper credits scene after this takes place. In fact at John's grave his son Jack is moping around in depressingly sad rain while an achievement/trophy pops up lampshading the traditional ending to a Western called "Into The Sunset." It is eventually played straight when Jack gets revenge for his father's death and kills Ross and then walks off into the setting sun as the Red Dead Redemption logo blares across the screen allowing the credits to roll, conclusively ending the story.
-   The credits cinematic of _Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood_ shows the three McCall brothers riding off into the sunset—not the straightest example, as William is actually dead by the end of the game, so this scene is presumably a flashback Thomas or Ray are having of the time when they still traveled together.
