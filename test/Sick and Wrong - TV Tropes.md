_"That is sick and wrong!"_

After a particularly strange or squicky phenomenon, a character will inevitably say, "That's disturbing", "That's just wrong", "That's wrong on so many levels", or something similar. The next level up has characters requesting the Brain Bleach. May lead into or combine with Screaming at Squick. For extra comedy this may be followed up with "But I can't look away..."

Contrast with ...And That Would Be Wrong, where they may not think so, but they want others to think they do.

-   When Heinz released a line of ketchup in multiple colors in 2000 under the brand "Heinz EZ Squirt".

    -   Later, Asuka refers to the incident as "your sick jerk-off fantasies!"
    -   The concluding line of the film, _kimochi warui_. Given in English as "How disgusting," variously translatable as "I feel sick," "This feels bad," etc.

    Comic Books 

-   _The Transformers: More than Meets the Eye_: Trailbreaker (quite rightly) has this reaction to Ore's corpse.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Power Games_, Hayate has this reaction to the idea of Signum as a mother.
    
    **Hayate:** Eww! No! Signum? Signum can’t be your mum! Signum isn’t anyone’s mum! Signum as a mother is, like... ultra-weird universe-gone-wrong stuff!
    
-   This is what Odd thinks about the Dix-Neuf joke in the first Omake of _Code: Half Demon_. You have to pronounce dix-neuf: dez-nutz to get the joke.

-   Jaune is appalled in _The Entertainer_ when he learns Yang (and possibly others) thought he was romantically interested in the fifteen year old Ruby. He promptly declares I Need a Freaking Drink.
-   Team Miraculous has this reaction in _Miraculous City_ when they find out that Adrien, Kagami, and Felix are all Sentibeings, with the former two's parents able (or once able to in Gabriel's case) to take away their free will with just a command. Pigella struggles not to throw up when Ladybug mentions how Gabriel described Adrien and Kagami as "of the same design" when trying to set them together, implying they were created with the purpose of their parents marrying them together.

    Film 

-   In Norm Macdonald film _Dirty Work_, Norm's character Mitch gets confronted by his best friend's father Pops, who says that he's also Mitch's father. When Mitch asks for proof, Pops pulls out a locket containing a picture of him on one side and Mitch's mother on the other. When Mitch says that doesn't prove anything, Pops pulls out pictures of him and Mitch's mom having sex. Take a guess about how Mitch reacted.
    -   There's also a second usage later, when Mitch's best friend Sam finally learns that the two are half-brothers and they start reminiscing about old times.

-   In _Hotel Artemis_, the assassin Nice has an optic implant that allows her clients to watch her kills, and mentions an extra...activity.
    
    **Nice:** Tonight, I had to look my target in the eye while I slit his throat, so the client can watch it later, while he masturbates.
    
    _\[beat\]_
    
    **Waikiki:** That's fucking gross.
    
-   In _Quick Change_, Loomis exclaims after seeing a strange joust by two poor Hispanics on bicycles with rakes, "It's bad luck just _seeing_ a thing like that!"
-   Used seriously in _The Royal Tenenbaums_. Margot tells Eli, with whom she's having an affair, that she doesn't love him; he replies, "I know, you're in love with Richie. Which is sick and gross." He has a bit of a point, since, adopted or not, Richie is her older brother.
-   In _Turning Red_, Ming _hates_ gyrating/twerking or anything that is done in a sexually provocative manner. Hilariously, her defiant daughter _loves_ it and uses this against her to get a rise out of her during their confrontation at the SkyDome.

    Literature 

-   _Vorkosigan Saga_:
    -   _Cetaganda_ depicts a planet where genetic engineering has become a fine art. When two visitors from a slightly more normal planet happen to walk by a _kitten tree_ in fruit, one remarks, "Now that is just wrong."
    -   This trope was used tactically to end the Vorryuter subplot in _A Civil Campaign_. Richars (cousin of the late count), apparently taking things personally, hired thugs to emasculate Dono (sister-turned-brother of the late count) the night before the Council of Counts decided on who inherited the seat. Ivan Vorpatril, after helping incapacitate said assailants before serious damage was done, hauled them and Dono not to the local guard or hospital but to a meeting of Richars' main supporters. Oddly enough Richars lost most of his votes the next day.
-   In _A Dirty Job_, late in the book Charlie Ascher walks in on one of his employees and one of his former employees (the first is a middle-aged, retired, and paranoid cop, the latter a twenty something goth girl who had worked there since her teens and is almost like a bratty younger sister to him) shagging in the thrift store he owns. This trope is his reaction.
-   In _The Dresden Files_, Molly — Harry's apprentice in her late teens/early 20s — makes a helpful attempt to charm some information out of someone by taking off her bra and going out to sweet-talk the stooge. Harry and the injured warden, Morgan, watch her go, and Morgan makes a comment along the lines of 'nice'. Harry is shocked. Morgan says may be over 100 years old, but he's not dead, and Harry is thoroughly sickened by the mental image. Made all the squickier for Harry by the fact that Molly isn't just his apprentice, she's his friend's daughter, whom he's known since she was ten.
-   _Ciaphas Cain_: In _Traitor's Hand_, Cain and some Imperials Guardsmen infiltrate a temple of Slaanesh and observe the murals inside:
    
    **One of the guardsmen:** Is this even anatomically possible?  
    **Cain:** No, it's not. And even if it were, it'd be against regulations.
    
-   _Nightside_: In _Hell to Pay_, John Taylor gets bored waiting for a tycoon's attention, so uses this trope to clear the room of yes-men, switching the tycoon's Ominous Multiple Screens to the most Sick and Wrong pornographic program he knows of. The contents of the "Celebrity Perversion Hour" are enough to send the crowd of yes-men climbing out the windows to avoid it.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    
    -   "Dopplegangland" has Willow comment, "This can't get any more disturbing," after Vampire!Willow comes on to her. And then it does.
    -   On "Some Assembly Required" - Giles: "Grave robbery? That's new. Interesting". Buffy: "I know you meant to say 'gross and disturbing'".
    -   When Buffy discovers Spike's obsession with her in "Crush", she actually looks physically sick. In the next episode, she's ranting about how disgusted she is over it.
    
    **Buffy**: Spike wants me! How obscene is that?!
    
    -   In "Intervention", when Spike gets himself a robot that looks like Buffy, because he can't get the real one to like him, this is the Scoobies reaction.
        
        **Willow:** _(thinking she's talking to Buffy)_ So just this one time you just did something kinda crazy?  
        **Buffybot:** It wasn't one time. It was lots of times, and lots of different ways. I can make sketches!  
        **Willow:** No!
        
    -   And later:
        
        **Xander:** Spike must have had her built so he could program her t-  
        **Buffy:** _(horrified)_ Oh god.  
        **Willow:** Yikes. Imagine the things-  
        **Buffy:** No! No, no imagining. Any of you.  
        **Xander:** _(raises his hand)_ Already got the visual.
        
    -   When Spike crosses over to _Angel_, his vampire ex-girlfriend Harmony has exactly the same reaction to finding out he had sex with Buffy in "Just Rewards".
    -   In "Him", Xander lasciviously eyes a gyrating nymphet on the dance floor ("Daddy like!"), only for her to turn around and reveal herself as Dawn. Cue facepalm.

-   _CSI: NY_: In "Happily Never After," Flack and Stella visit a street vendor staging area to question a suspect, and observe rotting food and other trash on the ground, rats running around, and a woman sneezing on a head of lettuce... which she continues cutting up for use. Flack is so disgusted, he says,"This is wrong. No New Yorker should ever see this. Ever." Stella tells him he can put in for psych leave. After finding human skin on their suspect's chestnut roaster and arresting the guy, Stella asks Flack if he's okay. He replies, "No, I'm not. I don't think I'm ever going to be the same."
-   _Firefly_
    -   Jayne's reaction on walking in on Mal and Zoe during their deadpan "Take me, sir. Take me hard" scene.

        **Simon**: Son of a _bitch!_
        
    -   Jubal Early's reaction to River's giggling over the intercom while pretending she was the ship: "Well _that's_ somewhat unsettlin'."
-   In _Scrubs_, Elliot once says "That's disturbing in, like, eight different ways."
-   _Dead Like Me_
    -   In one episode the naked ghost of an old man walked through (literally) a group of schoolgirls, causing the observing grim reaper to remark, "Oh, that's so not right for them."
    -   Another episode of _Dead Like Me_ (specifically, Season 1, Episode 11), Dolores is throwing a Mexican-themed going-away party for Millie, complete with margaritas, pinata, and a real live burro. George sees a man leading the burro into a room at the end of a hallway and says, "_That's_ not right."
    -   Because the writers were obviously very fond of this trope, it's also used in the final episode (Season 2, Episode 15). George and Mason are getting candy at various houses on Hallowe'en Night on the way to their reaps, and they stop at a house whose owner is dressed up as a sexy, corseted vampiress. The house turns out to be a whorehouse and the owner its madam; one of the prostitutes steps out for a smoke wearing peach-coloured lingerie, and tousles the hair of a trick-or-treating child, leading George to say, "Oh, that's just not right!"
-   _Frasier_:
    -   In "Voyage of the Damned", Maris puts on a cheesy 1970's salsa-disco song called "Do the Barracuda", causing Frasier to react, "Oh, oh, that's bad. On so many levels."

-   From _Friends_, when Phoebe's 18 year-old brother is going to marry his 44 year-old teacher:
    
    **Phoebe:** I don't want to be all judgmental, you know, but this is sick; it's sick and wrong!
    
-   In a highly self-referential episode of _Supernatural_, the brothers learn about their In-Universe fandom, particularly the massive "Wincest" fandom; Dean's response is "Well, that's just plain wrong." This line drew a _**titanic**_ backlash from the Queen Customers whose reaction was "They OWE us for their success, they shouldn't bite the hand that feeds them!"
-   Many of the more outrageous things House says have this sort of reaction.
    
    **House:** What can I say, chicks with no teeth turn me on.  
    **Wilson:** That's fairly disgusting.
    
-   On _Dollhouse_, Caroline!Wendy says, "The wrongness of this is SO large!"
-   On _The Ellen Show,_ Ellen and Selena Gomez discuss dating Justin Bieber.
    
    **Ellen:** A little brother is not someone you want to date. You don't want to date your little—  
    **Selena:** Well, no.  
    **Ellen:** No. No.  
    **Selena:** That would be— That would be weird and wrong.  
    **Ellen:** No, that would be wrong and weird, in so many ways.
    
-   The _Mythbusters_ did a _Breaking Bad_ special, testing the effect of the show's Hollywood Acid scene. The Mythbusters test it with a headless pig, a raised bathtub, and an extremely potent variant of sulfuric acid. After the smoke cloud clears, the guys have a look at the results.
    
    **Adam:** Augh!  
    **Jamie:** That's just wrong.  
    **Adam:** It smells terrible.  
    **Jamie:** That's one of the ugliest things I've ever seen.  
    **Adam:** It really is. \*looks to the camera\* It's one of the ugliest things _he's_ ever seen. Think about _that_ for a second.
    
-   _Henry Danger_:
    -   In "Tears of the Jolly Beetle", as Kid Danger is introduced at a town awards ceremony, Piper, Henry's nine-year-old sister, screams that she loves Kid Danger and then tells Charlotte that she thinks Kid Danger is hot.
        
        Charlotte: Yeah, you don't wanna be saying that."
        
    -   In "Twin Henrys", Henry becomes extremely disturbed and _disgusted_ watching Gerta, in the form of Henry, and Schwoz talking lovingly toward each other. He demands that she change back to her normal form if they are to continue.
-   _Loki (2021)_: Mobius reacts with shock and disgust when he figures out that Loki has fallen in love with a female variant of himself.
    
    **Mobius** Two Variants of the same being, especially you, forming this kind of sick, twisted romantic relationship. That's pure chaos. That could break reality. It's breaking my reality right now.
    

    Tabletop Games 

-   Most people's reaction to _F.A.T.A.L._. Realis**CLOACATIME**!
-   _Warhammer 40,000_ has plenty of this. Being a grim dark world, there is no shortage of Sick and Wrong things in it. A few examples would be the Forces of Chaos (Slaanesh and Nurgle in particular), the victims of Dark Eldar, The Imperium of Man, who have been described as Nazis in Space!, who are only "good" by comparison of MUCH worse horrors, and many more.

    Video Games 

-   _Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh_: First (?) and most memorable utterance of the phrase 'Sick and Wrong' came from this 1996 puzzle game. It contained quite a few Squick sequences captured in video detail. The character saying the lines was a straitjacketed girl in an asylum (the story writer in a cameo, incidentally) who repeated the phrase in tones that alternated between accusative and exhausted. This was aired throughout the scene while the main character, strapped in his own straight-jacket and doped up in a wheelchair, had to figure out how to escape while witnessing and hearing things that were exactly as the girl described: "Sick and wrong!" As is the game.
-   One of the responses The Engineer will say when doused in Jarate or Mad Milk is appropriately, "That just ain't right!"
-   There is an achievement in _Cookie Clicker_ called "Just Wrong" achieved by selling a Grandma.
    
    _"I thought you loved me"_ — Flavor Text for the Just Wrong achievement
    
    _"News : cookie manufacturer downsizes, sells own grandmother!"_ — "News" feed report when Just Wrong achievement is unlocked.
    
-   At the end of the second _Robopon_ game, the king declares that having rank holders is sick and wrong, given all the trouble they caused.

    Visual Novels 

-   A few times in _Double Homework_:

    -   The protagonist will get this reaction if he asks Lauren, Morgan, Amy, or Rachel to share him with Johanna and Tamara. The chosen girl will end things with him, leaving him to his sisters.
    -   When Morgan catches Tamara jerking the protagonist off, she calls it “messed up” even after she touches his thigh while she watches. She is weirded out, but also turned on.
-   A couple of characters react this way to the protagonist's relationship with the title character of _Melody_:
    -   If the protagonist gets caught dating both Melody and Amy, Amy yells at him for being a “pervert” and tells him not to come near either of them again.
    -   Bethany has this reaction if Melody kisses the protagonist while standing up for him.
-   In _Spirit Hunter: NG_, Seiji reacts this way when he realizes that Akira's gonna search through a well that contains severed animal heads. Akira counters that his life is on the line, and he's already had to search a corpse already, so he's desensitized to how gruesome it is.

    Web Animation 

-   In _Red vs. Blue_ episode "Get Bent", Church, during his time in the Epsilon memory unit, misremembers the Red Team as women. His reaction to seeing his mistake is more or less this trope.

    Webcomics 

-   _Exterminatus Now_: After Blasphemy the Chao transforms from "really cute" to "daemonic abomination, but still kind of cute on some level", it rips apart and devours the daemon it got its abomination-ness from. Even Lothar Hex winced and said "Ooh, that ain't right". This is a character who once sat bolt upright and shouted "You can't prove I ate that baby!"
-   _Inhuman_: Invoked word for word, in reference to the treatment Grey has received.
-   _Polk Out_: It's basically the punchline to 90% of the strips.
-   _Scary Go Round_: The VitRx potion that enlarged the younger Winters girl was first tested on animals:

-   An episode of _Spongebob Squarepants_ had Spongebob and Pat see a hibernating Sandy. Spongebob states that they shouldn't disturb her sleeping. Patrick responds, "That's not disturbing. _This_ is disturbing." Patrick promptly folds his back fat to form a face and says, "Hi. Sponge. Bob. My. Name. Is. Pat. Back." Spongebob replies cheerily, "Ha! That _is_ really disturbing!"
-   There's an episode of Filmation's _Filmation's Ghostbusters_ where Prime Evil is forced to do _one good deed_ in order to gain his powers back. Upon hearing this, he muses, "How disgusting."

    -   He recovers quickly, even becoming a Wholesome Crossdresser singing "Do It To Me One More Time".
