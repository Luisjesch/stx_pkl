_"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves."_

Someone comes along and preaches a message about how they're going to make everyone's lives better. People will flock to them out of hope, or because they see an opportunity to increase their own power by aligning with the prophet. If they don't already have it, this figure will request assistance—physically, monetarily, or in some other way—so that their goals can be achieved. If the universe has a chosen one prophecy, this individual will likely claim they're The Chosen One.

But in one way or another, this figure is deceiving their followers. Their true goals are different from what they preach, and they are inherently selfish goals. Money, power, revenge, lust, a combination of the aforementioned reasons—the False Prophet's true motives could be any of those or something else entirely.

This trope is closely related to the Fake Faith Healer, Greedy Televangelist, Phony Psychic, and Scam Religion. Prone to becoming the leader of a cult. Compare Dark Messiah for another savior figure that uses unethical tactics, but may actually be genuine in their faith and intentions unlike a False Prophet. Compare with Not-So-Well-Intentioned Extremist.

It goes without saying this is No Real Life Examples, Please!.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Berserk_: Griffith, the main antagonist for a majority of the manga's run. After betraying the Band of the Hawk in exchange for power and a position among the Godhand, Griffith re-enters the human realm and poses as a savior for humanity who would "vanquish the shadow that blots out the sun" when he is actually a harbinger of death and destruction. His image as humanity's savior is mostly based on (a) A premonition seen by people throughout Midland and (b) backing from the Holy See, based on the religious organization of the same name.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_: Father Cornello, the prophet of the religion worshiping the Sun God Leto in the village of Lior at the start of the manga and both anime series, turns out to be nothing more than a con-man. His "miracles" are all the result of the power of an incomplete Philosopher's Stone he has, and his sole reason for founding his religion is to establish a powerbase of religious fanatics he can use as foot soldiers.
-   Friend from _20th Century Boys_ frames himself as the messiah to the world through a complex conspiracy while actually being a would-be supervillain who plans to kill most of the human population and rule over what remains as a dark king. For bonus points, he tries to turn the world against the real Messianic Archetype.

    Comic Books 

-   _Daredevil_: Not a deliberate version on the part of the individual in question, but Matt spends most of _Guardian Devil_ trying to establish if a baby really is the second coming of Christ or the Antichrist, eventually turning to Doctor Strange for a definite answer.
-   _Judge Dredd_ arch-villain Judge Death does not usually see himself as any kind of messiah, but he's more than happy to use the various Death Cults to advance his goal, which is more killing. The Mortarian sect in particular elevated him to a God of Evil and happily marched towards slaughter before they realized that it was a sham. As Death eloquently points out:
    
    **Judge Death:** There's no life after death. If there were, what would be the point of killing you morons?!
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _The Dark Knight Rises_: Bane presents himself as a savior that would liberate Gotham's citizens from capitalist chains. His true objective is to destroy Gotham and get revenge on Batman.
-   _Guyana: Crime of the Century_: Johnson states in front of his followers that he will protect them with whatever means necessary, and that they will prevail when Judgement Day comes. His fanatical personality leads him to take extreme measures, and turns him into the kind of enemy he swore to destroy.
-   _Lord of Illusions_: The Big Bad Nix, calling himself "the Puritan", leads a cult that believes he's the new messiah, and worships him through murder. He's really a sadistic dark magician who plans to wipe out mankind, and he embraces his role after his resurrection.
    
    **Nix:** I was not born to show people the error of their ways, I was born to murder the world.
    
-   _Marvel Cinematic Universe_: Thanos claims that he wants to kill half of all life in the universe so that the other half can will be saved from extinction by having more resources to consume. Joe Russo says in the DVD Commentary that the real reason he's committing genocide is to prove to himself that his rejected solution to save his species—killing half of them—would have worked. This is also why Thanos doesn't use benevolent methods to prevent extinction, like creating even more resources, granting immortality, or making a cure for every disease that's ever existed.
-   _Revenge of the Sith_: Palpatine, a Dark Lord of the Sith religious order, lies to Anakin Skywalker about being able to cheat death so the latter will become his apprentice out of desperation to save his wife and unborn child.
-   _Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn_: Jared-Syn tells the Nomads that he'll use his magic powers to help them win back their ancestral lands, causing them to accept him as chief. In fact, he's only using them as muscle while he gains power, and plans to enslave them all once he takes over Lemuria.
-   _Mr. Ricco_: Black militant Frankie Steele may once have had genuine ideals, like black people owning their own neighborhoods, but once he started getting media attention and government funding for his projects, he embezzled most of the money, leaving almost none of it for the people he was supposed to be helping. He strung along local blacks until almost everyone got sick of him, including the media, but he still has a small handful of followers.
-   _The Night of the Hunter_ is all about this, depicting the havoc unleashed on rural West Virginia when an escaped convict named Harry Powell rolls into town disguised as a preacher for his cover identity. Powell makes his actions seem innocuous by framing himself as a kindly man of God, but in truth he's an unrepentant and misogynistic serial murderer who has come to recover treasure left behind in the area by a bank robber years ago. The film actually opens with the exact Bible verse the page quote is taken from being quoted.

    Literature

-   _Left Behind_: Leon Fortunato is identified as this when he calls down lightning to kill three disloyal subpotentates at Nicolae's funeral.

He uses promises of deliverance to convince magic-users who are living in the human world to work against their own best interest and find the Weaveworld for him. As always with Shadwell, caveat emptor is in effect, and the _best_ his marks can hope for is disappointment.
-   The Treatise of the Three Impostors (Latin: De Tribus Impostoribus) was a long-rumored book denying all three Abrahamic religions: Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, with the "impostors" of the title being Jesus, Moses, and Muhammad. Hearsay concerning such a book surfaced by the 13th century and circulated through the 17th century. Authorship of the hoax book was variously ascribed to Jewish and Muslim writers.

    Mythology and Religion 

-   The Bible contains several denouncements of false prophets, especially towards the end of the Old Testament when Israel and Judah turn away from God and ignore the warnings that He's about to send them into exile. <sup> *&nbsp;</sup>  Jesus also warns his followers about false prophets more than once, in one case naming another trope in the process. He gives particular warnings about anyone claiming to be his Second Coming, essentially saying that it'll be blatantly obvious to everyone when it really happens and in the meantime anyone making such claims is a false prophet.

    Video Games 

-   _Apocalypse_ has it's main villain, The Reverend, who on the surface appears to be an all-powerful and benevolent follower of God and The Good Shepherd, but is actually in league with the Horsemen of the Apocalypse after seeing a vision of doomsday, and intends to summon the four horsemen under his control to hasten doomsday and rule over what's left of humanity. Much of the game revolves around the protagonist, Trey Kincaid, attempting to uncover and destroy The Reverend only to fail in the final cutscene after The Reverend took over Kincaid's mind and makes him the Fifth Horsemen. Roll credits!
-   _Baldur's Gate II_: Gaal is the High Priest of the Cult of the Unseeing Eye who preach that all other gods but his own are false and have swayed many to his cause. It turns out that his "god" is a Beholder. A powerful entity, but hardly a god, even in this setting.

Not too far away, you'll find a Gigglegibber who claims to be "Bristlebane's Profit", hoping to find an adventurer dumb enough to not notice the obviously fake altar. The Gigglegibbers are ultimately harmless in comparison to more aggressive goblin tribes, but their lack of intelligence makes them rather amusing.
-   _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_: Archbishop Rhea tells Byleth to sit on a throne in the Holy Tomb to receive a divine revelation from the goddess, Sothis.

With monsters on the rise and apparent curses appearing across the land, the people have turned to him to lead them lit of these dark times. In point of fact, Pope Zera and his subordinates are the one causing the curses and monsters because he knows his god Granas is dead, and he wants to revive, then later become, Valmar because humanity needs a god to serve. What keeps the Church of Granas from being a Scam Religion is that only Zera and his inner circle are aware of the spoiled information.
-   _Halo_: Dasc Gevadim is a cult leader who created the religion Triad, amassing followers and then retreating to a remote planet while his believers claimed he had "ascended".

-   Thaos ix Arkannon from _Pillars of Eternity_ is a complex case. He is legitimately the High Priest of one of the settings' gods, Woedica, however, the gods themselves are exposed at the end of the game as artificial constructs, created by ancient soul-smiths as means of ideological and moral control over the peoples of the world. What's more, said soul-smiths were led by one of Thaos' previous incarnations, whose memories and identity he has inherited. However, because the gods' artificiality is all but forgotten in modern times, the only time someone actually refers to Thaos as a false prophet is in a flashback of when his past incarnation's former disciple Iovara call him out on it.

For both empires. For the Sith Empire, he sabotaged their efforts so they would make effective decoys for Zakuul's forces to roll over. For the Zakuul Empire, he showered them in lavish gifts of robot slaves, and did not tell them how unsustainable their way of life truly was. And for both, he was planning to consume the entire _galaxy_ and achieve godhood, sparing no-one.
-   _Super Paper Mario_: Count Bleck claims that he wants to destroy the multiverse so that he can create a new one without any of the original's flaws. He's telling the truth about destroying the multiverse, but lying about the part where he'll replace it with a new one. And the reason he's doing this? He couldn't find any joy in life after he believed that his lover was dead, so he decided that everyone had to die with him.

-   _Warframe_ has Nef Anyo of the Corpus, a smarmy, sleazy "true prophet of the Void" who claims that the Void will reward people who give him their money, regularly cheating the less-fortunate out of their money (and their freedom).

In truth, Belos was lying and deliberately turning the people of the Boiling Isles away from the Titan's true teachings, as he's actually a human witch hunter determined to destroy the Isles and kill all the witches who inhabit them.
