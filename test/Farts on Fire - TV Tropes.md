_"In China it's considered perfectly good manners to talk with your mouth full and to burp after your meal. Farting seems to vary according to the situation and your current company, so ask ahead of time. Lighting the fart is frowned upon in almost all provinces."_

Flatulence is set aflame.

This _does_ work in Real Life, though not always, and not very impressively. Despite the fact that it _is_ Truth in Television, Don't Try This at Home (for reasons that should be obvious).

Science fact: farts are, essentially, just the body expelling methane. Methane also flees quickly. Timing is required. Rather than the huge flame you see in certain cartoons, it'll be a tiny blink-and-you'll-miss-it flame. Don't ask us how we know. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

Compare Fartillery. Nothing whatever to do with Gaslighting. Can be a Revolting Rescue if it's used to save someone.

-   Happens in Lois McMaster Bujold's _The Vor Game_, where the main character, dubbed the camp idiot for a (rigged) accident with a piece of major equipment, is relieved when the title is taken over by a couple of new recruits who set their tent on fire lighting "fart flares".

-   Kobato Hasegawa from _Haganai_ is mentioned to have done this as a hobby at one point.

    Live-Action TV 

-   A fantasy-version of Rygel the 16th as the Black Knight uses this as a weapon in _Farscape._
-   The _MythBusters_ tried it (in a segment they could not air in the USA but did overseas...and the US execs finally relented for the anniversary "Top 25" special). Although the flatulence was flammable, the flame itself was fairly unimpressive and it didn't remove the smell at all.
-   In _The Young Ones_ episode "Cash", Vyvyan thinks he's pregnant, backed up by his rapidly expanding gut. Turns out it was just gas. Right after it's released, Mike (who had left because he didn't want to watch) comes back into the room, appears not to smell anything, lights a cigar to congratulate Vyv — and blows up the house.
-   Stephen Colbert attempted this to demonstrate how to fix the oil spill in the gulf. It didn't go so well and we instead got some Relax-o-Vision as the stagehands put him out. On the bright side, he doesn't need to worry about that waxing appointment anymore.
-   A segment of a bizarre German game show featured a sort of "word of the day." The clue was as follows: A woman in lingerie bends over, and the camera does a close-up of her butt. A flame is brought near it, and the result is something like a Bunsen burner. (The word of the day was "gas.")
-   Happens in the Halloween episode of _Bottom_. Richie makes "Sprouts Mexicane", a special Halloween snack containing year-old sprouts and other rather nasty and spicy ingredients (including a full jar of curry powder, three whole bottles of Tabasco sauce, and _gunpowder_). The guys all pass out and when they wake up, flatulence ensues.
-   In the _I'm in the Band_ episode "Don't Date the Principal's Daughter", Burger does this on Derek after Ash, who pulls his finger in order to make him burp fire (because he accidentally discovered earlier that pulling the wrong finger will result in a burp when it's Burger), but fails hilariously
-   Happens at least twice in _1000 Ways to Die_ with fatal consequences.
-   Happens in _House_, when the team is operating on a hikikomori with an intestinal blockage. A doctor goes to cauterize a bleed... "Hey, wait! The gas..." \*_FOOSH!_\*

    Music 

-   "Let's Make the Water Turn Black" by Frank Zappa is a parody of the Psychedelic Rock style, which was popular back then. While this genre usually had narco-mystical and "make love, not war" themed lyrics, this song has lyrics about two kids burning eachothers' farts (and some other disgusting stuff)
    
    Whizzing and pasting and pooting through the day...  
    Ronnie helping Kenny helping burn his poots away
    
-   Ass Burners. They got it depicted on one of their albums' covers. It's a grindcore/black metal project.
-   The Genesis song "Supper's Ready" has the lyric "Oooh, can't you feel our souls ignite...". This has inevitably led to the mishearing "can't you feel arseholes ignite".
-   HammerFall's "Hearts on Fire" is commonly mutated into this very trope title. "Burning, burning with desire," indeed.
-   One of the many problems Victoria Wood has with the subject of "Things Would Never Have Worked."
    
    I wanted poems, but you wouldn't write them,  
    My earlobes nibbled, but you wouldn't bite them,  
    You'd only fart, and then you'd try to light them.  
    Things would never have worked.
    
-   "Yob" by TISM:
    
    If it's a party, fight!  
    If it's winnings, skite!  
    If it's politics, right!  
    If it's flatulence, light!

    Video Games 

-   _Mortal Kombat: Deception_: Bo Rai Cho's Fartality.
-   _The Binding of Isaac_:
    -   The Lighter trinket makes all farts explode and leave a small fire on the ground. Trying to use this offensively can (and usually _will_) hurt Isaac, but it also causes enemies who fart to self-destruct.
    -   The Ashpit boss Singe can pull out a match and ignite his farts once his health runs low. It's a lot deadlier than it sounds.
-   _'Splosion Man_ seems to 'splode like this from time to time.
-   Chimchar from _Pokémon Diamond and Pearl_ has a flame coming out of its buttocks whenever it's awake. The flame is fueled by, to quote the Pokédex, "gas made in its belly."
    -   Also, Reshiram actually has the ability to shoot flames out of its tail.
    -   Stunky and Skuntank can learn Flamethrower and Fire Blast. Later games try to cover it up by having them shoot fire from the mouth, but given that they're based on skunks...
-   In _Dragon Age: Origins_, if you try to tell Oghren's ex-girlfriend Felsi that he's more fun than other men she probably knows, she'll say "If by 'more fun' you mean 'more likely to light farts on fire.'" And this isn't even the dumbest of his antics that she recalls...
-   In the intro from the Enhanced Version of _The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings_ the jesters pull this off, to the uproarious amusement of King Demavend and causing the royal advisor to Face Palm.
-   The main gimmick behind _Orc Attack: Flatulent Rebellion_ is to use flatulence as a weapon. The best way to do so is to pass gas around a giant fire, which is essentially as effective as using a grenade.
-   _Tattoo Assassins_ had this as a shared fatality for all characters. This is about as tasteful as it sounds.
-   In _Mario Strikers_, should Wario's Gas Mask special happen to come into contact with Bowser's Flame Storm special, it'll detonate in a huge explosion that'll knock out anyone who happens to be in the vicinity.
-   _Boogerman_ can do this as an attack and to fly, after eating a chili pepper.
-   _Team Fortress 2_: The Gas Blast kill taunt, available when the Pyro has the Thermal Thruster equipped, is implied to be this: the Pyro using a match and the jetpack on his back to light his farts on fire.
-   _Monster Hunter_: The Congalala, introduced in _Monster Hunter 2 (dos)_, changes what kind of..."munitions" it uses depending on if it's eaten a Nitroshroom, Mopeshroom, or Parashroom. When it eats a Nitroshroom, the mushroom's volatility sets its farts _and_ its belches on fire.
-   One scene in _Live A Live_'s Prehistoric chapter has Gori fart next to a fire, which ends up exploding in everyone's faces. Pogo and Beru aren't pleased when that happens.

The captain is hunkered down behind cover and staring intently into the woods when all of a sudden there's a farting sound. He stands up and turns around to see one of his underlings facing away from the fire with a smoking rear.
-   _Camp Camp_: The Grotesque Jermy Fartz does this in his debut episode, not on purpose, but as a consequence of standing to close to a the flame of a bunsen burner.
-   _The Lazer Collection 5_ introduces this with great pomp as "The moment you've been rubbing your rhubarb for." One guy is filming another attempting to fart onto a candle, but the other guy decides it was "a false alarm." As they express their disappointment, the second guy suddenly farts a gigantic lazer that rockets him into the sky and disintegrates him.
-   In _Super Mario Bros. Z_, Waluigi uses a Fire Flower to light one of Wario's farts to a nuclear degree.

-   One episode of _Beavis and Butt-Head_ consists nearly entirely of Beavis in a hospital emergency room, face-down on a gurney, whimpering in agony, with his pants burnt off around his blackened butt. At one point, flames shoot out of his butt, propelling the gurney some twenty feet, with Beavis screaming in pain. It's never adequately explained what led up to this, leaving it to the viewer's imagination.
-   A _Camp Lazlo_ short exaggerated this for a hilariously disastrous fuel-air bomb when Lazlo was invited to a ceremony right after a bean-eating contest. The beans caused gas to build up and overload Lazlo's tummy. The moment the ceremonial torch was lit, he let it all go.
-   _The Canterbury Tales_: In this Animated Adaptation, the famous fart that Nicholas lets fly into Absolon's face bursts into flame when it hits the hot poker Absolon is wielding, leaving Absolon with Ash Face.

-   _Family Guy_:
    -   The second segment of "Family Guy Viewer Mail #1" had the Griffins develop superpowers from toxic waste; when Chris discovers he's pyrokinetic, Peter gets the idea to do this, resulting in a long trail of flame.
    -   In the first segment of "Untitled Griffin Family History", the universe is a result of God lighting one.
-   This is actually one of the many superpowers _Johnny Test_ gained as Johnny X as a result of one of his sisters' giving him mutant powers.
    
    **Johnny X:** Power poots, go!

-   In _Kung Fu Kenobi's Big Adventure_, several cans of beans are used by the titular character to blow up Jabba the Hutt, and his palace with him. And that's the least bizarre part of that particular short.
-   Often when Meg farts in _Mega Babies_ she tends to do so rather explosively (literally).
-   _South Park_: The flaming flatulence was featured in the very first episode, "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe". "Dude, you're farting fire!"

    Real Life 

-   There is a _very_ good reason why this shouldn't be done in Real Life. Namely, the possibility of burns on the anus and genitals, clothing or skin catching fire, and outright permanent scarring and psychological damage.
-   In Real Life, pig farms have to be routinely ventilated, or else they risk exploding.
    -   The ammonia would kill them before the risk of explosion would. At high enough concentrations, ammonia can blind a person and make them suffer severe respiratory consequences.
-   This was given in _The Book of Heroic Failures_, listing an episode in which a vet attending a cow in a barn stuck a tube into "that end which is not capable of facial expression" and struck a light. The resulting jet of flame set fire to the barn.
    -   Which is probably a reference to a James Herriot story above. Or both referencing the same Urban Legend.
-   There is at least one Darwin Awards story with this. It backfired into the guy's rectum. Ouch.
    -   http://www.darwinawards.com/legends/legends2000-06.html is a 2000 Darwin Award given to a total idiot who successfully lit farts of a cow — the cow then exploded as the flame entered the cow's rectum and killed the aforementioned idiot by means of flying cow femur bone shrapnel.
-   A confirmed case of this happened in Germany. Long story short, too many cows, not enough ventilation, and a static buildup. Thankfully, no person or cow was injured.
