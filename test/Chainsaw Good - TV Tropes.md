"Aaah! Chainsaw! The great communicator!"

_"I love this saw! This saw's a part of me, and I'm gonna make it a part of you!"_

Basically, chainsaws are good. Good here having the meaning of "totally unstoppable weapons of mass destruction." Nothing can stand before their roaring, multi-toothed might; only death awaits any who challenge a chainsaw-wielding maniac. Death and Gorn.

Since they're usually used in media where carnage is key, chainsaws are typically a favorite tool of Ax-Crazy lunatics, horror villains, and the Zombie Apocalypse Hero.

Realism isn't usually a priority in media when chainsaws start swinging. In reality, the tools make pretty terrible and hazardous weapons for a wide number of reasons. Even in many works of fiction, chainsaw wielders often get carved up by their own weapon either accidentally or their opponents using it against them.

A common way of playing with this trope is to make a chainsaw part of a Swiss-Army Weapon.

See also Vibroweapon, Deadly Disc, Rule of Cool, Awesome, but Impractical, Saw Blades of Death. Compare Sinister Scythe, another gardening tool commonly used as a weapon in fiction.

While the trope name mainly refers to chainsaws, it has mutated to also include the use of similar power tools such as circular saws/buzzsaws, hedge trimmers and even lawnmowers as well.

Does not have anything to do with Hedge Trimmer, which is about editors who clean out clutter and other dirtiness from This Very Wiki, such as Word Cruft and Conversation in the Main Page.

Note: This is about _actual_ chainsaws (and the like). For weapons with a chainsaw-like grip, see Chainsaw-Grip BFG.

    Advertising 

-   One of Jim Varney's old "Ernest" ABC Warehouse ads ended with him putting a chainsaw to a turkey and cutting the table in half.
    
    **Ernest**: What'll it be Vern, light or dark!?
    
-   This ad for the SNES _Killer Instinct_ has a guy cut an arcade machine in half with a chainsaw, to reveal an SNES with the game in it.

    Anime & Manga

-   Motorball warrior Armblessed in _Battle Angel Alita_ has a chainsawed-out body.
-   Grell the grim reaper of _Black Butler_ uses one that she supposedly customised herself. Some might say that it conflicts with the "Victorian" setting, but _Black Butler_ doesn't really pay attention to that kind of thing.  
    Outside of the French translation, the word 'chainsaw' is never used, and none of the other characters seem to know what it is.
-   _Black Lagoon_ has Sawyer the Cleaner, a chainsaw wielding Elegant Gothic Lolita. To be fair, it's as much a tool of her trade as much as an instrument of mayhem even though she can apparently deflect bullets with it. What's her trade you ask? She 'cleans' up the many bodies that litter Roanapur by making them... More portable. Occasionally when the bodies are still technically alive in order to give the correct impression to the receivers of the bodies in their portable state.
-   In _A Certain Magical Index_ and _A Certain Scientific Railgun_, Mikoto Misaka can use her electrical powers to magnetically form iron sand into _whip_ chainsaws.
-   _Chainsaw Man_:
    -   The title character merged with a devil embodying human fear of chainsaws. Now Denji can pull a cord sticking out of his chest to transform his head into a chainsaw and grow them out of his arms and legs.
    -   Previously, said devil, known by Denji as Pochita, simply turned into the weapon his partner used by hand. He used to be much more powerful, in a humanoid form with blades like what Denji gains, because devils are empowered by fear of their concept, and something as loud and gruesome as a chainsaw fits well with the Rule of Scary.
-   In _Code Geass_, Humongous Mecha with Chainsaw Katanas show up about halfway through season 1. Much asskicking ensues.
    -   Mao also used a normal-sized chainsaw. It was presumably powered by a small sakuradite reactor or something since he manages a Diagonal Cut on _metal_.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
        -   Wouldn't you know that it's even become memetic?!

-   In _Food Wars!_, one of the _Noir_ AKA Midnight Chefs, is a woman in military garb named Sarge, whose main cooking tool is a chainsaw carving knife.
-   Buccaneer in _Fullmetal Alchemist_ has a Chainsaw Arm style of Automail, though his is actually more realistic than most examples here in function. It consists of a chainsaw that is part of a larger pincer, and allows him to dismantle other Automail limbs. Furthermore, the chainsaw motor is used to keep the Automail warm and prevent frostbite, which is important given that he works in the far north. Also is likely to be handy what with the whole zombie army that shows up in the finale.
    -   Which becomes useless when tangled up.
    -   In the manga, when Winry sees that Ed has broken his automail arm _again_ during his fight with Lan Fan, she forgoes her usual Wrench Whack and chases after him with a chainsaw. The end result is censored, though Ed is coated with blood the next time we see him.
-   One of the mecha pilots in _Full Metal Panic!_ uses a chainsaw _sword_ to cut a hasty hole in an airliner to extract a bomb. What, you thought _Warhammer 40,000_ had a monopoly on chainswords?
    -   And in episode 5 of the spin-off, _Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu_, the school janitor uses this against Sosuke and Issei after he's had enough of their fighting.
-   A set of robotic guard dogs in _Ghost in the Shell_ have chainsaw _teeth._

-   In _Highlander: The Search for Vengeance_, Malike, the first Immortal Colin encounters in the film, has a _massive_ chainsaw sword he uses. Colin's katana blocks it just fine, even in a Blade Lock.
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_: America is using a chainsaw for no explained reason, scaring Canada out of complaining about him to his face. He also sported a very Yandere expression with Scary Shiny Glasses. (America didn't mean to threaten him though, he was just being unintentionally scary.)
-   _Is This A Zombie?_ deserves mention due to a bright pink chainsaw named Mysteltainn featuring prominently in the course of the show as part and parcel of the resident Magical Girl's outfit and moveset, including the Finishing Move "Mysteltainn Kick" (which isn't a kick at all).
-   Kars from _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Battle Tendency_ can spring chainsaw-swords from his body.
-   Kichikujima: Kaoru uses a chainsaw not unlike Leatherface with also using a knife and hammer. His father also used the same chainsaw when Kaoru was a child before Kaoru grew up and took it as his own. Ami also used it against her abusive father that tried to rape her.
-   In _Kirby: Right Back at Ya!_, King Dedede cuts down a forest with a _laser chainsaw_. This is only true in the dub to make it less imitable.

-   One of the antagonists of _Priest_ wields a primitive chainsaw. _In the Old West._
-   _Princess Resurrection_'s Hime uses a chainsaw as her signature weapon. She even dualwields two chainsaws to fight off the Pharaoh.
-   Torikabuto is shown to _Dual Wield_ them in one chapter of _Reborn! (2004)_. But considering the fact that the main character fights with a pair of woollen mittens and someone else fights with a _dining fork_, this borders on the mundane.
-   _Rebuild World_: The Don Rogelt prefers using a giant chainsaw sword for his Mini-Mecha.
-   In _Rosario + Vampire_, Routier Miao, aka Ludie, attacks Fong-Fong with a chainsaw.
-   _Saitama Chainsaw Shoujo_ takes this trope up to eleven with Fumio, a teenage Yandere who learned a _Confederate Chainsaw Martial-art_ from her Texan grandfather. She ultimately faces an Evil Twin of herself who wields an identical chainsaw, leading to a _chainsaw duel_.

-   _Soul Eater_:
    -   Giriko's weapon form is a chainsaw, which he describes as "a truly traditional evil weapon."
    -   One suggestion is that the use of chainsaws in horror films is the reasoning behind the 'truly traditional' comment.
    -   He's also one of a few weapons which can wield themselves by turning part way into their weapon form (he usually manifests his chain to act as armour, cut stuff up with his hands and feet or...as treads to move around with).
-   _Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann_: General Cytomander's custom Ganmen, the Shuzack, is fitted with a buzzsaw. It proves largely useless against the favoured weapon of the heroes.
-   _Tokyo Ghoul_ has a chainsaw-shaped Quinque called "Rotten Follow". It's initially wielded by Psycho for Hire Shiki Kijima, and later inherited by his subordinate, Nimura Furuta. The process used to create such weapons only adds to the horror, as it was made from Rio's older brother and uses part of his corpse as the engine.
-   One of the mechs from _Viper's Creed_ has a chainsaw-rifle combo, a villain's mech in the last episode has two mounted on extra arms.
-   An episode of _Wedding Peach_ showed that the red string of fate was so powerful a chainsaw couldn't cut it.
-   Akutabi Gamma of _Zombie Powder_ carries a chainsword as tall as he is, and wields it one-handed. Oddly, he's supposedly one of the greatest swordsmen in the world anyway, which makes you wonder why he needs to carry around an encumbering, gas-guzzling chunk of overkill as well. Outside of the obvious.

    Comic Books 

-   Anti-Hero _Abslom Daak: Dalek Killer_ carried a Chainsword. Quoth the Dalek Killer:

-   _Planetary_ has **chainsaw bullets**.
-   Downplayed in _The Punisher_ issue where he joins the Hand, the Hand wanted to test his worth and so a team ambushes him at his safe house. Among the weapons that Frank pulls out, one was a chainsaw. It was a desperation move that had him overextend himself with a two-handed swing. He only took out one ninja and killing that guy was just because Frank was partially in the shadows, so the ninja didn't see what he was doing. The main reason Frank survived the fight was he had very good torso armor and even then he barely made it.

-   _The Zombie Survival Guide_ deconstructs this, noting all of the above reasons _not_ to use a chainsaw against the undead, and adding that it's incredibly heavy for a weapon that you're probably going to be lugging around for miles, that the very loud noise it generates is certain to attract more zombies and even its marginal usefulness as a weapon ceases completely the instant it runs out of gas or breaks down.
-   Conversely played straight in _How to Survive a Horror Movie_, which mentions that chainsaws are among the best weapons to procure because they're lightweight, easy to use, and highly effective, with the issue of fuel being ignored outright. Then again, the guide is for surviving in a _horror movie_, where the realistic problems with using a chainsaw as a weapon will never come up.

-   One segment of the multi-part _CSI_ episode "Toe Tags" showcased both the damage-dealing potential and the dangerous unwieldiness of the chainsaw as a "weapon": The Killer Was Left-Handed, and accidentally killed his friend and himself trying to cut up some furniture to spite his ex-wife. He'd been using a chainsaw designed for righties at the time.
-   _Danger 5_: The Big Bad is Dual Wielding four fire-sprouting chainsaws during a school massacre.

    -   And when they revisited the question of whether it's better to have an axe or a gun versus a zombie horde (the axe proved marginally more reliable), they threw the chainsaw into the mix and found it far outperformed either of the former, deeming it Confirmed as a viable improvised short-term weapon for Action Survivor vs standard issue Zombie. While drawbacks like the weight, running out of gas/battery charge, and kickback were acknowledged, these were counterbalanced by several factors, the primary one being that a chainsaw does not need to be swung: meaning no delay between takedowns, more precision, and that the user isn't exhausted as quickly. The end result was that where the ax test ended with Adam exhausted and swarmed, and the firearm test ended with Jamie taken down before unloading more than a few guns, the chainsaw allowed Adam to take down the entire horde at a brisk walk.
-   John Woo's TV series _Once a Thief_ (in turn itself a remake of his own movie of the same name) features a 'parody' episode filled to the brim with intentionally absurd situations, one of which involves a lightsaber-style duel involving chainsaws.

-   A few _Robot Wars_ competitors employed chainsaws as weapons as did House Robot Matilda (though this was later replaced with a vertical spinning disc in the 5th wars), but they were quickly proven to be Awesome, but Impractical as they were largely ineffective against robots with metal armour (i.e. the vast majority!) and, in the case of Matilda, proved to be a critical weakpoint to the likes of Razer.
-   The History Channel's show _Sliced_ in which a guy cuts things (pool tables, pinball machines, other chainsaws) open with various saws to see what's in them. Not entirely sure what it has to do with history.
-   A _Saturday Night Live_ skit had a Candid Camera Prank show where someone pranked his neighbor who kept borrowing his tools and not returning... with a chainsaw. ("I can't believe how much prank juice came out of him when I pranked him in half!")
-   _Smallville_:
    -   In the episode "Conspiracy", the villain tries to charge at Clark Kent and the others with a circular saw, but hits some low hanging wires and electrocutes himself to death.
    -   In the episode "Crush", Justin Gaines uses telekinesis to turn on a chainsaw and throw it at Chloe. Clark Kent saves her in time.

-   One edition of _Top Gear_ featured the use of a chainsaw to resolve a Cool Wall argument.
    
    -   During the South America Special, as they hack through the rainforest:
    
    **Jeremy:** I AM THE GOD OF HELLFIRE!
    
-   The penultimate episode of _True Blood_'s second season includes a protagonist attempting to use a chainsaw as a weapon, only to get it hopelessly stuck in a counter-top before it can be of any use.
-   In the _Walker, Texas Ranger_ episode "White Buffalo", the villain attacks Walker with a crowbar, only to be beaten down with a 4x4. Naturally, while Walker deals with one of his accomplices, he decides that the proper response is to rev up a chainsaw. It doesn't really take.

    Music 

-   "Malcolm" by _The Arrogant Worms_ that begins as follows:
    
    _Billy solves his problems by calling up his Ma,  
    Heather solves her problems with drugs and alcohol,  
    Daniel solves his problems with a doctor and the law,  
    But Malcolm has his own way, and it's better than them all...  
    'Cause Malcolm solves his problems with a chainsaw,  
    Malcolm solves his problems with a chainsaw,  
    Malcolm solves his problems with a chainsaw,  
    And he never has the same problem twice!_

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Battlemachines_ chainsaws are one of the satisfyingly destructive weapons that you can arm a mech with. This is taken to new heights with Carman Skiric, whose personal mech has no less than four chainsaws, and if he hits with one of them, the rest will hit automatically.
-   _BattleTech_ and _MechWarrior Dark Age_ allow players to field IndustrialMechs that use civilian gear as weapons. The Forestry and Logger Mechs carry what can only be described as giant Mech-scale chainsaws, which they can use very effectively for cutting down trees or carving up opponents. The saws are the size of the host Mech's leg. Just have a look at the thing.
    -   'Mech-sized saws subvert the trope a bit as their anti-armor damage doesn't really compare that well to even that of a simple hatchet except on 'Mechs so light that they probably don't bother to mount them on account of the _saws_' weight and bulk. However, by the rules a unit equipped with one can reduce even a dense forest hex notionally thirty meters across to mere "rough terrain" with few if any trees left standing in at most _forty seconds_ — half that if a second such unit helps out.
    -   It also does a fine job of tearing down buildings, doing a minimum of 7 damage and up to 12 damage against any kind of building. A single chainsaw-equipped unit can reduce a hardened bunker 30 meters across to so much rubble in as little as 90 seconds and can cut bridge supports inside 30 seconds, enough such that even the toughest bridge would be unable to support heavy units trying to cross it.
    -   The game also has the Dual-Saw, which is a paired set of circular saws that are built to cut _rock_. They're more effective against mech armor than chainsaws (though still not a terribly effective weapon).
-   _Buffy The Vampire Slayer_: They deal great damage, but they are _dangerous_. If you roll a Critical Failure, you'll hit yourself.
-   _Call of Cthulhu_ gives a chainsaw the equivalent of an impale (where a stabbing weapon hits something vital) but in this case it removes a limb.
-   _Cyberpunk 2020_ has the Husqvarna Chainripp - a chainsaw which you can install into your bionic arm.
-   For the D20 system, _1001 Science Fiction Weapons_ contains a whole chapter on powered saw weapons. Usually powered by energy cells like most other EnhancedArchaicWeapons, however they have the option of the clumsy combustion engines. They come in various forms, the exact details of which are left to the GM/players imaginations, but include a normal chainsaw designed as a tool, a single-handed circular saw which can be swung or used a quatar, or similar saws on the ends of staves. The double-ended staff is intended to be marketed to space barbarians and heavy metal bassists.
-   _d20 Modern_ has the Decapitator, which is essentially a Vorpal Chainsaw, and the Chain Saw of the Psycho, which is an enhanced-damage weapon that inflicts negative levels on good-aligned users.
-   There is a Chainsword (a unique magic sword that's a cross between a sword and a chainsaw, described in DRAGON Magazine #132) in AD&D.
-   _Doctor Who Adventures In Time And Space_ has extremely simplistic rules for melee weapon damage which, as the game cheerfully points out, make chainsaws among the most dangerous melee weapons possible... for all the good that does. Given the source material, combat is generally discouraged, and numerous opponents have access to ranged attacks that deal _instant death_ on a good roll, deflectable by spending Story Points.
-   _Dragonmech_, a steampunk take on a d20 fantasy world, has as part of the new "steam tech" chatterswords, which in addition to 2d6 damage can inflict a bit more damage later on as the victim's own movement rips open their wounds. Then there's the terrifying buzzaxe, which does 2d8 damage.
-   Even _Dungeons & Dragons_ has gotten in on this trope. With the second Adventurer's Vault sourcebook, anyone who wields a Heavy Blade, Axe or Polearm can find a Fleshgrinder version, a demon-developed magical weapon that the text and sidebar make clear is a chainsaw-bladed version of the greatsword, battleaxe, scythe, glaive or whatever's appropriate.
-   _Exalted_ characters are well known for their daiklaves. How do you go one better? With a _chainklave_. It's not just a chainsaw sword...it's a _magical_ chainsaw sword about the size of a man. Unsurprising, really, since Exalted actually has a Rule of Cool _game mechanic_.
    -   The Alchemicals have the Gyroscopic Chakram, the signature weapon of the Thousand-Wounds Gear Style. It can only be described as the bastard offspring of Captain America's shield and a table saw.
    -   A canonical form of chainklave, the _autoklave_, appears in the appendix to _Shards of the Exalted Dream_. Apparently they're popular in, surprise surprise, Autochthonia, as well as every Shard except Burn Legend.
-   Games Workshop games:
    -   In _Warhammer 40,000_:
        -   For the Imperium, the chain weapons are a ubiquitous close combat weapon, especially among the Astartes. While the chainsword is the most iconic there are also chainaxes which are fondly used by the more violent or battle-loving chapters, Terminators can be equipped with chainfists<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , the Sisters Repentia of the Adepta Sororitas use huge two-handed chainswords. These weapons' adamantium teeth have monomolecular edges, all the better to cut through enemy armor, especially since power and force weapons<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  are in relatively short supply due to the Imperium's technological limitations. Even their vehicles/walkers aren't safe as sentinels can also have chainsaw attached to them, older models looked similar to a hedge trimmer but newer models have proper chainsaw arms.
        -   Tyberos the Red Wake, a Captain (and possibly Chapter Master) of the Carcharodons wield a pair of weapons called Hunger and Stake. They're essentially a combination of Lightning Claws, Power Fists and Chainfists all into one, with the chainsaws in the palms of the hand like teeth in a shark.
        -   The Deathshroud Terminators of the Death Guard Legion wielded _Chain Scythes_, which they kept millenia after their fall into worship of nurgle. Mortarion, the Primarch of the Death Guards, got an absolutely huge Scythe tipped with a chainsaw right at the end named Silence, which mutated along with him upon his ascension to Daemon Primarch and is now the size of a small _car_.
        -   Chaos forces, especially the Heretic Astartes, use chain weapons for essentially the same reasons, although theirs are usually much nastier in form and function. Khorne Berserkers wield chainaxes almost exclusively, as their frenzied Attack! Attack! Attack! nature makes them extremely vicious and there's nothing quite like a weapon that can bash your opponent's head in _and_ puree him out at the same time, which is why the Space Wolves like them so much also.
        -   The Striking Scorpion Aspect Shrine of the Craftworld Aeldari specializes in melee combat, and those fighters wield chainswords that are very effective against Space Marine armor. While they could wield psychically-charged weapons, those are usually reserved for Warlocks and Seers, who concentrate more on psyker powers in combat. Exaggerated with the Biting Blade, which is reserved for their Exarchs.
        -   For Orks, the thought process for using chain weapons is something like "'Ey, what makes a choppa more killy? Put some spinnin' teef on the edge!" More excessive versions include the 'uge choppas used by Ork Nobz, which if you're using the ones from the Nobz boxed set generally have a chainsaw edge or circular saw of some description at the violent end; the circular saw arms on the Deff Dredd and Killa Kan kits; and the Mek/Meganob-specific killsaw, which is designed to carve open tanks so that the Mek can reuse the parts to build more chainsaws.
        -   Imperial Titans are sometimes armed with a Titan Chainfist, which is basically a giant chainsaw the size of a _small bus_, which they use to punch stuff with. Generally it's used against other titans, but on occasion they are known to punch the poor sap 3 feet from their toes. Khorne Lords of Battle wield massive Great Cleavers, which are massive titan-scaled Chainaxes. Ork Stompas have similarly large chainsaws to Titans, albeit much more crudely designed.
    -   _Necromunda_:
        -   As with the wider _Warhammer 40,00_0 setting, chainswords are a popular weapon but their high cost means that they are often only wielded by gang leaders and their most trusted fighters. In 1st and 2nd Edition chainswords were the most powerful of the Common close combat weapons while in 3rd Edition rules for chainswords weren’t introduced until the second _Necromunda: Gang War_ supplement and the release of the Forge World weapon kits.
        -   The primary weapon of the Spyrer Matriarch is the chainscythe, a weapon that fits with her techno-Grim Reaper visual theme.
        -   Although it had no effect in the rules, the 1st Edition Goliath Leader with meltagun model has replaced his traditional mohawk with a chainsaw blade, something the 3rd Edition models give a Shout-Out to with the inclusion of a similarly designed mohawk as an option on the Goliath plastic sprue.
        -   The background for Pit Slaves makes mention of the legendary pit fighter Harkan Vore, who had a chainsaw replacing his _lower jaw_.
        -   During the 1st and 2nd Editions of the game, Redemptionist Crusades were the only gang who had access to Evisorators, massive two-handed chainsaws popular with religious fanatics throughout the Imperium.
    -   It's not just the grim darkness of the future that loves its chainsaws, the Rending Sword from Warhammer Quest and _Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay_ was a semi-sentient sword with a set of razor-sharp whirling sawteeth on its blade. A great weapon for chewing up a Chaos Warrior's flesh and armour. Speaking of Chaos, one property a Daemon weapon can get is Chainsword, which is an oil-sputtering, armor-piercing engine of destruction
    -   Games Workshop loves their chainsaws as _Blood Bowl_ has the Goblin team's Loonie carrying around a chainsaw as do certain All-Stars. The chainsaw's great for taking down an opponent, but it's an illegal weapon that referees can suspend and there's a chance you could gut yourself on it.
    -   Finally there's _Chainsaw Warrior_, where you are a cyborg super-soldier trying to fight through a New York city tower to stop the Darkness. The Chainsaw Warrior can carry a variety of guns and melee weapons, but his strongest unlimited use weapon is his chainsaw which gives a huge bonus to combat and can cut through certain traps. In the sequel _Chainsaw Warrior: Lords of Night_, the main man can have several varieties of chainsaws, including a diesel-fuelled chainsaw and a stone-cutting industrial saw.
-   In _GURPS_ chainsaws do more damage than any other melee weapon. Unfortunately, they're terribly difficult to use.
-   _Hong Kong Action Theatre_ lists the chainsaw as just one of the Improvised Weapons a character can wield. It does a fixed 100 points of damage rather than being reliant on Muscle like most other melee weapons, but it's also got the biggest Speed penalty out of all the weapons of the game, meaning you're not going to get a lot of Actions with the sucker. But if you want to recreate the final showdown from _Tiger On Beat_, what's stopping you?
-   _Mechanical Dream_ is set on a reality-warping planet almost the size of Jupiter which is undergoing an Industrial Revolution with steampunk technology. As such, quite a few chainsaw-like weapons exist. These include the mechanical saw, the Real Mechanical Saw, the grindsword and its uglier cousin the goresword, which are all powered by a special fruit. Additionally, for the Judicator class, there is the Judicator Blade, which can develop the powers Gnasher and Rend to make the Judicator Blade into chainsaw.
-   _Mekton_ represents this with the Armour Piercing upgrade. The standard Saw item has a low Weapon Accuracy, to represent its clumsiness. However, the weapon construction system in _Mekton Plus_ offers no obstructions beyond price/space considerations to building a chainsword that could be used by a particularly agile Impossibly Graceful Giant for _fencing_.
-   _Munchkin_ has the card called _Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment_. It's Exactly What It Says on the Tin.
-   The kinder and gentler _Mutant Chronicles_ also loves chainsaws in the future. Capitol Sergeants have chain swords. Brotherhood Inquisitors have flamethrowers with chainsaw bayonets. And Legion has guys with chainsaw halberds.
-   _Numenera_ has the artifact Cacophany Blade which is described as well-oiled sword with chain with blades running through it. The weapon is a bit unwieldy so users take a hit in attacking with it but it does significant damage and has some armor-piercing ability. Interestingly this weapon is a markedly superior to the Disruptive Sword, usually in most media the lightsaber-style weapon is better than the far cruder chainsaw/chainsword.
-   In _Paranoia_
    -   The standard peripherals for docbots include surgical chainsaws. Please hold still, citizen.
    -   One bonus book includes stats for a "papercut chainsaw," which has sheets of paper instead of metal teeth.
-   A two-handed _+1 chainsaw_ can be gained as loot during the _Pathfinder_ adventure path "Iron Gods", and is even being wielded by the character on the cover of the second book. In-book art for volumes three to six depicts it being wielded by iconic barbarian Amiri, who has never met a BFS she didn't like.
-   In _Rifts_, Armor-shredding Chainsaws are a favorite weapon of the chemically-augmented Juicer Warriors.
    -   Thanks to the Mega-Damage combat system, those chainsaws CAN slice through a tank. The fact that the preferred model among Juicers has teeth virtually honed to the molecule, and that your average Juicer can bench press a grown bull, may be a factor in this as well. Anti-tank chainsaws wielded by suicidal-steroid-freak-supersoldiers are not among the top _40_ weirdest things in Rifts. Which tells you something of what you need to know...
    -   And while the books note that strictly speaking a chainsaw isn't a very practical weapon even in the hands of a colossal Juicer or Titan Juicer (that is, while stupidly deadly, they're still extremely clumsy in use), they admit that the potent symbolism and intimidation factor is the real reason they see widespread use among Juicers; entire Coalition brigades have run in terror at the sight of a mere handful of chainsaw-wielding Juicer shock troopers.
-   _Shadowrun_ doesn't list chainsaws among its normal weapons, but a note in the Breaking and Entering gear section says that you _can_ use a chainsaw in close combat, and it deals horrific amounts of damage, but it is extremely unwieldy. In the 3rd edition, the Cannon Companion included chainsaws, and, oddly, it was roughly comparable to a katana in terms of general damage output. Looks like katanas really _are_ just better.
    -   The 5th Edition supplement _Run & Gun_ introduces the Ash Arms Combat Chainsaw and a monofiliment version. While the fluff mentions that users are more likely hack off their own limbs, mechanically they're some of the best melee weapons available, with average accuracy, good reach, high damage, and some of the best armor penetration; the drawback being that you can't apply your strength to damage, and as an "exotic" melee weapon, it requires putting skill points directly into it's use.
-   In _Sine Requie_ Templar characters can wield Expiators, which are basically chainswords inscribed with verses from the Bible. They are among the close combat weapons that cause the gravest wounds.
-   In _Unknown Armies_, melee weapons deal +3 damage per quality they have—sharp, heavy, and/or two-handed. Among the examples mentioned, chainsaws give a + 9 damage bonus in melee, the highest in the game. As do katanas.
-   The _Vampire: The Eternal Struggle_ CCG game has "Talbot's Chainsaw," a magical chainsaw that turns the equipped minion into a combat monster. The drawback is that the minion _must_ attack another minion each turn or do damage to himself.
-   Both versions of _The World of Darkness_ grant chainsaws terrible accuracy penalties... but if you _can_ land that hit, they deal great damage.

    Theater 

-   Even Cirque du Soleil's _Mystère_ plays with this trope for laughs. Brian Le Petit tries to get a man out of a locked wooden crate with a chainsaw. The emcee stops him; Brian begins to shoo him away with the threat of a Groin Attack — and then the power runs down...
-   In _The Rocky Horror Show_, Frank chases Eddie into the freezer with a chainsaw or an axe.

    Theme Parks 

-   Halloween Horror Nights at the Universal Studios parks go all out with this trope. HHN Orlando has the long running Chainsaw Drill Team who roam the park grounds scaring guests while HHN Hollywood has the pigmasked lackeys from _Saw_ performing the same function and running visitors out of the park at the end of the night in the "Chainsaw Chaseout". They also appear in the hands of the "scareactors" in their haunted houses.
-   Sideshow Bob wields a sawblade against the protagonists in _The Simpsons Ride_.

    Toys 

-   _Kotobukiya M.S.G._:
    -   As part of their Mobile Support Goods (MSG) model kit lineup, Kotobukiya has a WORKING small chainsaw (Weapon Unit MW26, Dynamic Chainsaw) for their other plamo, like the Frame Arms and the Frame Arms Girls (and is also compatible with Bandai's Gunpla). It has a fully articulated belt made of linked individual teeth, comes with a spring-powered windup motor, and can be outfitted with the battery-powered Gimmick Kit Motor. Of course, the tiny polystrene chainsaw teeth are both too blunt and too soft to really be much of a danger to your fingers (unless you get pinched between the teeth due to carelessness). Video Review link here.
    -   The M.S.G. HW13 Grind Circle is a motorized chainsaw wheel, it can split into a pair of huge curved sawblade swords.
    -   The M.S.G. MW13 Chainsaw, while not motorized, is more compact than the Dynamic Chainsaw. It can also be used as a chainsaw bayonet.
-   _LEGO_:
    -   The Ice Planet theme had ORANGE TRANSPARENT CHAINSAWS. Notably these were available long before standard solid-gray ones were introduced.
    -   Later runs have also had solid-grey buzzsaws.
    -   Later in _BIONICLE_, Onua Nuva had Quake Breakers that were essentially these. They also doubled as all-terrain treads.
-   The _Mobile Suit In Action!!_ figure of _Mobile Fighter G Gundam_'s Lumber Gundam (Grizzly Gundam in North America) came with a chainsaw accessory - even though it never used one in the anime - because why not?

    Webcomics 

-   Starting here, _8-Bit Theater_ has Fighter using the "Glorious Chainsaw Method"; this enhances his swords with "radiant chainsaw auras", which he uses to make short work of some dragons. It's apparently a Shout-Out to _Exalted_.

Needless to say, it made it into the scene, and it turns an otherwise terrifying scene into something to laugh about as you wonder where he could have gotten a chainsaw. Hilariously, one of the Jedi waiting on the elevator (Roron Corobb) while this is going on starts frantically hitting the call button faster when the noise stops.
