"Cheerio, lads."

**TheHelldragon:** Shake your fist in angry, British rage, Tom!  
**NTom64:** You can't see it, but my fist is wearing a monocle!

Start with one cup(pa) tea. Mix in a hearty helping of posh, formal, excessively polite-sounding Received Pronunciation accent, or at least how you think it is pronounced. No one (except those pesky normal Brits) will notice. Add some Stock British Phrases for seasoning, wot, wot. Add an Eton, Cambridge, or Oxford education. Stir in past military service as an officer for the Crown, preferably in a strife-torn colony of the British Empire. Blend in an interest in posh hobbies like equine sports. Throw it all in a top hat and stir with a monocle over low heat for the 1000+ years in the history of The British Empire. Turn it out carefully, give him a Preppy Name like "Sir Nigel Featherstonehaugh-Smythe"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , add a fancy prefix or suffix such as "the (Most) Honourable", "III" or "Esquire", and Bob's your uncle, you have yourself the Britishiest British man to ever "cheerio" his way into the media-viewing-public's home. And no one (except those pesky British people) will be any the wiser that you're mixing dialectal phrases willy-nilly or throwing British slang around like Frisbees.

Such characters are generally English in style, since the defining characteristics are not usually seen as typical of the Scots, Welsh or Northern Irish.

The Quintessential British Gentleman is a Stock Character commonly found in decidedly not-so-British works, who encapsulates everything that non-Brits (most commonly Americans) think of when they think of that funny little island across the pond. Much like the Eaglelander is a Flanderized American, this chap is the Flanderized Brit. Common characteristics include:

-   A top hat or bowler ("derby") and a High-Class Glass.
-   A morning coat and striped trousers, or (if on his country estate) a tweed suit, usually with matching flat cap and possibly with plus-fours instead of slacks.
-   Is a Gentleman and a Scholar who loves intellectual pursuits, often Adventurous Archaeology and joining scholarly societies.
-   Lots of tea, and occasionally crumpets.
-   Being a member of an exclusive men's club with leather armchairs and wood-panelled library, where white-gloved waiters serve fine port.
-   Enjoy posh activities such as equine sports and fox hunting on a country estate.
-   Being either extremely polite, even-tempered and gentlemanly, or so snobbish, pompous and arrogant only the equally snobby can stand him.
-   Using archaic phrases such as "pip pip," "cheerio," and "guv'nor," even though these combine expressions from completely different dialects and from opposite ends of the class spectrum.
-   A Distinguished Gentleman's Pipe, often in the Calabash style (the style that erroneous stereotypes of Sherlock Holmes made famous<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ).
-   A crazy mustache, ideally waxed at the tips. If other facial hair is present, it will be a short and well-trimmed beard.
-   Making lots of references to the Queen (God Save Her!), or the King (God Save Him!), as appropriate (or most comically anachronistic) for the time period.
-   An autoharp, harpsichord or piano playing Classical music in the background.
-   A cane or umbrella, preferably with a fancifully shaped silver (or silvery) head, which will often be held in the crook of an arm. Robbers should watch out; that walking stick may be a Sword Cane, or he may use the heavy metal ball in the handle to dispatch muggers.
-   He is driven around in town in a Rolls-Royce. If he drives himself, its a sporty V12 Jaguar Sovereign. On the country estate, he has a Range Rover with four wheel drive.

He's not always a product of lack of research. Sometimes, just as an Eaglelander is a gentle poking-fun-at of Americans, so too might this fellow be a humorous, good-natured jab at the English (because this stereotype is, more precisely speaking, English rather than British) — and done well, of course, even the Brits find it funny. In fact, many of the works listed were created by Britons, casually playing with their own stereotypes. (Britons, generally speaking, are good at Self-Deprecation.) Some Britons really do act like this, if not in everyday life, then at least recreationally. Because it's funny.

Compare with that Hawaiian-Shirted Tourist from Eagleland, and that bush-hatted fellow from the Land Down Under. By the way, has nothing to do with the Lord British Postulate, but plenty to do with Stiff Upper Lip. The Q.B.G is probably helpless without The Jeeves. See also the Gentleman Snarker, which is what the Quintessential British Gentleman probably was in his wild youth.

Real British Gentlemanly behaviour is more subtle than speech or dress, involving the virtues of hospitality, rationality and temperance, the avoidance of irrational extremes, devotion to 'things held dear', rebellion against corruption, and courageous composure in the face of adversity. (However, some of these - like extreme composure - are sometimes seen in trope form). The fact that old-school British upper-class men were expected to be athletic while young, and highly competitive or even domineering, is usually left out of fictional descriptions of the type. Female examples are likely to be an English Rose.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_: England does act this way _sometimes_, but he also has a short temper, foul mouth, and drinks, although it should be pointed out that being a gentleman doesn't necessarily equal amiability and huge amounts of tolerance — many a gentleman is also a Gentleman Snarker, and not suffering fools gladly goes hand in hand with this trope. Even the most impeccable gentleman will still occasionally pepper his dialogue with a few well-placed "bloody's" and "buggers!". One of his image songs is called "Absolutely Invincible British Gentleman", which is ironically a very modern rock song, complete with Epic Riffs.
-   _Hellsing_: There are composed and polite gentlemen in expensive suits around the table as the enemies close in on them... in the end, Sir Integra proved to be the strongest gentleman of them all.
-   Negi Springfield of _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ is a proto-version of this (at least at first), complete with tea. He seems to be drifting in a different direction. After becoming more of a Shonen hero (though not quite a standard one), however, he will still turn a diplomatic talk into a duel of honor between him and The Dragon over an argument about tea.

    Comic Books 

-   _Asterix_: In _Asterix and the Britons_, every Briton in an Iron Age version of this, complete with rowing skills, manicured lawns, wearing tweed and magnificent mustaches for their Stiff Upper Lips, and of course decrying the fact that their adversaries are decidedly not gentlemen. That's just the original French version; the English translation takes it up a notch by having every sentence end in "wot?" and other Self-Deprecation jokes.

-   _My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic (IDW)_: In "Chaos Theory", Accord's design and personality are largely rooted in this archetype, of which he has the fitted coat, curling mustache, silver-headed cane, even temper, and studiously gentlemanly politeness.

    Fanfic 

-   _God Help the Outcasts_: While he doesn't look like one, Dr. Cockroach is the most polite and cultured of the monsters. At one point, he evens makes a promise to Susan by giving his word "as an English gentleman".

-   _Nobledark Imperium_: Nemesor Zahndrekh behaves like a polite, cultured and posh British noble, largely due to him being crazy. He once asked the Imperium for help because of "A spot of trouble with a group of insectoid life forms", before contact was broken... which for those who read between the lines, means that he was under attack by a Tyranid Hive Fleet.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _A Bridge Too Far_, a German officer walks up to the beleaguered British paratroopers under a flag of truce, and says "Be reasonable, gentlemen. Things cannot carry on like this. We need to discuss surrender terms." A British officer spurns him with contempt. "Absolutely not! We simply do not have the facilities to take you all prisoner!"

-   Sir Henry Vining in _Five Weeks in a Balloon_ (1962) is an upper class twit/snob version.

-   The Beatles encounter one during their train ride in _A Hard Day's Night_. For context, the Beatles are in a cabin on a train when the QBG enters and adjusts the window to his liking without so much as acknowledging them; in the ensuing argument, the gentleman insists he has rights due to frequent usage of the train.
    
    **John:** Knock it off, Paul, you can't win with his sort. After all, it's his train, isn't it, Mister?
    
    **Man:** And don't take that tone with me, young man. I fought the war for your sort.
    
    **Ringo:** I bet you're sorry you won.
    
-   In _Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1973)_, Jekyll's friends are curious about whatever he's up to in his lab but are far too polite to ask, and can only assume it's a good thing.

-   In _Wonder Woman (2017)_ has Sir Patrick Morgan, the Reasonable Authority Figure among the British High Command, with his cane, suit, and flustered politeness. This becomes somewhat dissonant when he's revealed to be Ares but keeps looking like that, including in the flashback to Ancient Greece. Even when he reshapes molten metal into armor so he looks like the classic comic book version of Ares, his huge mustache is still visible beneath the helm.

    Jokes 

-   Sometimes modern American and British forum posters poke fun at the more conservative parts of the Isles by making them exaggeratedly conservative, like in the following joke:
    
    **Things to do after buying yourself a classic Triumph:**
    
    _Grow and wax a mustache._
    
    _Drive the Triumph to a poorly lit, dark-wood-paneled private club in Kensingtonworthshire or North Haddockbrooktonworth._
    
    _At the private club, sit in a deep leather chair and make pithy conversation with the other club members while using some kind of obscure tobacco product and sipping either tea or scotch._
    
    _Hold forth on a variety of topics, including the day's hunt, the newest radical in Parliament, hand-tooled shotguns, the laughably gauche Americans, the state of the Empire, and the relative merits of the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire._
    
-   Or the following:
    
    _Do you want to buy yourself a Rover? It comes with a flat cap, pipe, and a whippet._
    

    Literature 

-   Captain Cameron of _The Alice Network_ is a Scotsman who habitually wears tweed and smokes pipes. Eve even lampshades this, calling him a Quintessential British Gentleman. He's also a gold-star gentleman: He's honorable, kind, and wouldn't take advantage of Eve unless she tried really, really hard...
-   Granted, he's only around college age, but Arthur Deering in _Along The Winding Road_ is even described as "too British for \[his\] own good."
-   Phileas Fogg, the protagonist of Jules Verne's _Around the World in Eighty Days_, of course. His favourite hangout is a gentlemen's club in London.
-   Sir Henry Merrivale, from the Carter Dickson books which spoof Lord Peter Wimsey by creating an aristocrat who is _nothing_ like Lord Peter, except for the 'brilliant detective' part.
-   Sir Leigh Teabing from _The Da Vinci Code_. Not that it stopped him from being evil _Tea_bing? "Teabing" is an anagram of "Baigent." The Authors of _Holy Blood, Holy Grail_, Michael Baigent and Richard Liegh (notice anything?) sued Dan Brown for ripping off a theory presented in the afore-mentioned book by them for use in _The Da Vinci Code._ They lost.
-   Warden Chandler of _The Dresden Files,_ in addition to being a bonafide badass (he single-handedly guards a door usually protected by five people), is an English Sharp-Dressed Man and Deadpan Snarker fond of tea and wields a Classy Cane rather than the usual staff. He once wrote Harry (an American wizard) a letter and randomly capitalized several letters, stating in a postscript, "The language is English. I am English. Therefore, I can do with it what I want, colonial heathen."
-   Karl May lived at a time when wealthy British globetrotters were a common trope, so some characters of this type appear in his works. The most well-known examples are Englishman Sir David Lindsay in the Orient Cycle and Scotsman Lord Castlepool in _Der Schatz im Silbersee_. Lord Castlepool is obsessed with making wagers and travels through the Wild West in search of adventure, paying his guides 50 Dollars per adventure.
-   The be-monocled Ronald (or Rupert) Psmith is a recurring character in the comedies of P. G. Wodehouse. A refined gent of wit and eloquence: an eccentric of the first water. (The 'p' is silent, as in 'pshrimp'.) In fact, just about any of the older male characters in Wodehouse's work fit this trope. Bertie Wooster, while still rather young in the books, is a perfect example.
-   In the _Redwall_ series, some hares fall underneath this classification, especially the _Long Patrol._ The author is British though, so this isn't as Flanderized as some other examples.
-   Lord Peter Wimsey from the Dorothy L. Sayers books about him.
-   Although Sherlock Holmes himself does not really fit this trope, a few of the supporting characters from his stories do, particularly the clients he takes among the upper classes (such as the Duke in "The Adventure of the Priory School").
-   Captain Isambard Smith of the _Space Captain Smith_ series of books by Toby Frost is placed neatly between this trope and Richard Sharpe, with a healthy dose of buffoonery thrown in for good measure.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Adventures of Slim Goodbody_: Inspector Thiamin qualifies: polite, speaking with a British accent—even his haircut screams "British gentleman".
-   Giles and Wesley from _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, and any number of visiting English Watchers. Giles lampshades it right away:
    
    **Giles**: ...I'm a bit fuzzy, however, on the details. It may be that you can wrest some information from that dread machine.
    
    \[Everyone stares at him.\]
    
    **Giles**: That was a bit... British, wasn't it?
    
    **Buffy**: Welcome to the New World.
    
-   John Oliver (himself British) from the _The Daily Show_ finds one in Britain while covering the royal wedding.
    
    **John Oliver:** You are the most English _thing_ I have ever seen.  
    **Gentleman:** What a curious thing to say...
    
-   The Doctor was always noticeably British (or at least Anglophile) in his tastes and attitudes, but it's arguably the Eighth Doctor from the (American-made) Made-for-TV Movie who comes closest to this trope ("He's... British." "Yes, I suppose I am!"). The Third Doctor, especially when his exile was lifted, also reveled in the trope.
    -   Peter Davison described the Doctor as being alien, but also an honorary Englishman, which is one of the reasons he settled on a cricket sweater as part of his attire; what could be more English than cricket?
-   Bernard Fox also did this very well:
    -   Col. Rodney Crittendon on _Hogan's Heroes_
    -   Major Ross in the episode "Tea and Empathy" of _M\*A\*S\*H_
    -   Major Bently Royce on _F Troop_
    -   Sub-Lieutenant Clivedon on _McHale's Navy_
-   Version from the UK itself: John Steed from _The Avengers_, though only after the series was tweaked in an attempt to make it more appealing to American audiences.
-   This was done quite a bit on _The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air_. For example, in one episode where Geoffrey's long-lost comes to visit (who claims that he has plans to attend Butler School) Carlton becomes fascinated to the point where he begins to imitate the British Gentleman stereotype, bowler hat, pip pips, and all.
-   Jonathan Quayle Higgins in _Magnum, P.I._, played by the very _Texan_ John Hillerman.
-   Many sketches from _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ parodied the stuffy British stereotype that their parents' generation more closely embodied.
-   _Our Miss Brooks_: A Quintessential British public school principal visits Madison High in the episode "Hello Mr. Chips." Miss Brooks uses him to make Mr. Boynton jealous.
-   _The Umbrella Academy (2019)_: Sir Reginald Hargreeves looked and sounded the part. He wore a monocle and formal wear, had dignified facial hair, was titled _Sir_, spoke in a posh British accent, and had a Stiff Upper Lip that extended to emotional distance from his children. He was also a wealthy Gentleman Adventurer, inventor, and philanthropist who enjoyed the finer things in life.

    Music 

-   Professor Elemental evokes one of these, with a mix of upper-crust British accent, adventurer's outfit, Sherlock Holmes pipe and raps about tea and mad science experiments. Sometimes he plays the trope straight for humor, but on "I'm British" he both evokes and subverts it in pride of his culture and country.
    -   And mustn't forget his frenemy Mr. B the Gentleman Rhymer, though he dresses in a more 1920's version of the trope. The two used to have a "beef" in the form of a few dis songs ("A Piece of My Mind" and "Fighting Trousers"), but they seem to get along now.
-   The Wayfarers: "Deck the Sheds" is based on the idea that an audience of these is being treated to an Australian version of "Deck the Halls". At first they're enthusiastic about it, with lines like "Spiffing!" After it turns out the song has "Rip a bloody hugey, bonza mate!" instead of the traditional fa-la-la, they're...less wowed.
-   Sting's song "Englishman in New York" is basically this trope: the musical. With lyrics like "I don't drink coffee I take tea my dear", "A walking cane here at my side, I take it everywhere I walk" and "Modesty, propriety can lead to notoriety". (Although the song was based on Quentin Crisp, who in Real Life was a _touch_ more of the British eccentric than this trope usually covers.)

     Professional Wrestling 

-   Lord Steven Regal/William Regal. While in WCW as Lord Steven, he had a manager/valet in 1995-1996 who was even named _Jeeves_.
-   CHIKARA has featured Jervis Cottonbelly, who wears a derby, walks with a cane, and is very polite and elegant. He also has a mustache, though in his case it's drawn on his mask.
-   Averted by, of all people, Chris Adams since, although he _was_ British and _did_ use "Gentleman" as his Red Baron, he did not affect any of the mannerisms associated with this trope.

    Radio 

-   One and Two from _The Men from the Ministry_ fit this trope to a T, with their bowler hats, pinstripe trousers, umbrellas, and love for tea.

    Theatre 

-   _Anything Goes_'s Evelyn Oakleigh. Or _Sir_ Evelyn Oakleigh, in the 1962 version. Or LORD Evelyn Oakleigh in the 1987 version.
-   The _Mrs. Hawking_ play series has Nathaniel, and of course his uncle Reginald upon whom he's modeling himself, though the latter is in many ways a Deconstruction of the trope.

    Video Games 

-   _Arcanum: Of Steamworks & Magick Obscura_ (set in a Fantasy Counterpart Culture to Victorian-era England) has some characters played up as this to various extent. Franklin Payne is a Gentleman Adventurer with a monocle; Perriman Smythe is a young Gentleman Wizard using a bit of Stock British Phrases, and Garfield Thelonius Remington III, a.k.a. Gar the World's Smartest "Orc" is a Cultured Badass. All three have a fondness of the Earl Grey tea.
-   _Borderlands 2_ has Sir Hammerlock, a comically anachronistic Gentleman Adventurer.
-   _Dawn of War 2_ gives us Lord General Castor, an Officer and a Gentleman who hunts Tyranids for sport, wages bloody wars that end in the death of thousands of Guardsmen, and has a mustache that could conquer a subcontinent.
-   _Fossil Fighters: Champions_ has Professor Scatterly, who seems determined to out-British anyone who tries to British his way. (He even sneaks in a few naughty British words.) There's also Rupert, who, while preteen, is on his way to being this.
-   _Jade Empire_: Sir Roderick Ponce von Fontlebottom the Magnificent Bastard is here to educate all of you heathens in the proper manner of wearing trousers, drinking tea, debating, and shooting off overpowered flintlock rifles. His clothing and armor, however, are more Spanish in style.
-   Sidney Nettleson from _Jagged Alliance_. His bio in _Jagged Alliance 2_ reads: "Whether sharing a tea with English bluebloods or putting a .38 slug into an unwanted nuisance, Sidney does everything with poise and dignity. Sidney combines the mannerisms of the upper crust with the lightning quickness of a Wild West gunslinger. Years of avid cricket-playing have also given him a much-feared throwing-arm."
    -   Scope Sterling from the sequel is his Distaff Counterpart. While Scope is less of a walking stereotype, she scatters her speech with Britishisms, speaks with an outrageously plummy RP accent, and displays a relentlessly Stiff Upper Lip.
-   Arlon the Serene from _Kid Icarus: Uprising_, complete with mustache and monocle.
-   _League of Legends_ has the champion Cho'Gath, The Terror of the Void. This horrific monstrosity has a skin that turns him into this. Gentleman Cho'Gath has a top hat, monocle, and a high-class British accent.
-   Major Zero in the _Metal Gear_ series is a slightly less blatant example, only hitting a few of the above traits. Subverted, ironically, when he becomes the leader of the Patriots.
-   _Nosferatu: The Wrath of Malachi_: Uncle Andrew and Grandfather Frank both dress and talk like this.
-   Kolorado, the Adventurer Archaeologist in _Paper Mario._
-   Professor Layton:
    -   Layton is actually fairly tame... but he _is_ very polite and smart, and he _does_ love his tea. He also stresses — frequently — the correct behavior expected of a gentleman.
    -   Luke covers the areas of Britishness that Layton can't as well.
-   _Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure_:
    -   Taken to comical extremes with monocle-wearing, mustache-bearing, tea-guzzling Adventurer Archaeologist protagonist. When he drinks tea, he summons a giant robot to help him as the background briefly changes to an enormous British flag. Yep, this is a Quirky Work, all right... The Speaking Simlish voice natter that accompanies his dialogue is literally _nothing but_ an endless series of 'pip-pip, cheerio'-style sounds. No words, just raw unadulterated Britishness. The rest of the cast encompasses the various variations on this trope; his archnemesis, for instance, is a Steampunk Willy Wonka lookalike who uses a giant mechanical top hat as his vehicle.
    -   Henry's sidekick has three legible words in his voice natter. _The words are "guv'na", "righto" and "jimeney"._ The game doesn't just embrace the trope, it dances a waltz with it.
-   In _Slipstream 5000_, Eddy Royce is (or presents himself) as this. Unlike most of the other drivers, he's supposed to be a firm believer in etiquette and civility (although that isn't the same thing as never attacking anyone — that's just part of the game).
-   The _Street Fighter_ series has two (of its three male British characters in the series; Birdie is more of a stereotypical British punk): Eagle from the original _Street Fighter_, some ports of _Street Fighter Alpha 3_ and _Capcom vs. SNK 2_ is a man wearing a dress shirt and suspenders with a moustache who attacks with two clubs. Dudley from _Street Fighter III_ wears a similar costume except with a bow tie and boxing gloves. He is very much like a mixture of Eagle and Balrog in that he is a gentlemanly Brit, but is also a black boxer. With his curly moustache and neat hair, he is definitely the more stereotypical of the two...and he can also somehow drink tea while wearing boxing gloves.
-   The last boss, Sir Richard Rose, in the 1991 side-scrolling action game _Sunset Riders_. His two lines of dialogue are "Cheerio, old chap!" and "I say, bit of bad luck."
-   _Super Mario Odyssey_ has all of the hat spirits populating the Cap Kingdom, including Cappy, speak like upper-class Britons and use quintessentially British turns of phrase (an NPC in Bonneton remarks that "you've got to keep a stiff upper brim"). Even Cappy's Voice Grunting has an "eh wot?" tone to it, and he sits down with Mario for a cuppa when traveling between worlds. As an added bonus, male hat spirits are shaped like top hats and females are shaped like derbies (except for Cappy's sister Tiara, who's shaped like... well, a tiara).
-   Captain Ash, from the _Timesplitters_ series.

    Webcomics 

    Web Originals 

-   National Cynical Network's "Chap in the Hood" series. A toned-down example, possibly because it was recorded around 4:20.
-   Parodied/deconstructed with _Englishman_, who is in some ways the stereotypical British gentleman as imagined by Americans (he lives in the USA, and fights crime), but the series is written by two Britons. Also, he embodies the darker side of the British upper classes as well, cheerfully trading in slaves, shooting foreigners, and so on.
-   "The Chap" Magazine is dedicated to these people.
-   The Dark Id's Let's Play of _Resident Evil 4_ makes El Gigante (a mindless giant) into one of these, complete with a photoshopped monocle.
    -   Also done with the zombie of Alexander Ashford in the Let's Play of _Resident Evil – Code: Veronica_.
-   "GameChap and Bertie" of YouTube fame play off this trope.
-   NTom64 of Hellfire Commentaries, as described in the page quote above, is basically MADE of this trope.
-   Mr. Green online casino has a series of videos dedicated to this. Here's the first one.
-   Retsupurae's take on ElectricalBeast whose accent is so exaggerated it seems fake. "Even _British_ people are saying 'I can't believe how British this guy sounds'."
-   The personality of Shattered Glass Grimlock is based on this trope; it was originally a one-shot April Fool's joke, but ended up so popular that it was Defictionalized in-universe, wot.
-   The Spiffing Brit invokes this trope often, inviting his viewers to have a nice cup of tea while watching and even mentioning the Empire at several moments.
-   Whateley Universe example: Fey's magic tutor Sir Wallace Westmont, who's virtually a Shout-Out to John Steed, down to the bowler and accent. He even has an Action Girl accompanying him to Whateley Academy.
-   Played with in the bizarre "Leg Peeing" sketch by The Whitest Kids You Know.

    Western Animation 

-   The titular star of _Around the World with Willy Fog_.
    -   Prior to him, there was Phileas Fogg from 1972’s Around the World in Eighty Days.
-   Anti-Cosmo from _The Fairly Oddparents_ speaks in a British Accent, is intellectual, wears a monocle and derby hat, and loves sipping tea. Of course, being an anti-fairy, he's not British. Plus he's doing things For the Evulz.
-   Every non-real-life-celebrity British character on _Family Guy_. Props for also depicting their very real pervy side, though. Notably taken up a notch with _The New Yorker_ employees in "Brian Goes Back To College" through covering pretty much every variety of this trope in a matter of seconds:
    
    **Wellesley Shepherdson:** ...and this is our writer's lounge where you'll meet some of our contributors: Fielding Wellingtonsworth.
    
    **Wellingtonsworth:** _\[sipping tea from teacup and saucer\]_ Hello.
    
    **Shepherdson:** Livingston Winstofford.
    
    **Winstofford:** _\[lights a cigar, wears a monocle, has a large mustache\]_ Yes?
    
    **Shepherdson:** Amelia Bedford-Furthington-Chesterhill.
    
    **Chesterhill:** _\[smoking a cigarette in a long holder, swills brandy in snifter\]_ Good day.
    
    **Shepherdson:** And James William Bottomtooth.
    
    **Bottomtooth:** _\[has comical underbite, terrible teeth, speaks unintelligibly\]_
    
-   Mr. Herriman from _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_ has a top hat, monocle, AND a mustache. However, being imaginary, he's not really British.
-   The Scotland Yard police captain in _The Inspector_ "London Derriere" cartoon:
    
    **Captain**: We'll be delighted to assist you in apprehending your jewel thief, Inspector, but I say, old boy, do put away that gun; we police don't use them here in England. It's against the law and all that, you know!
    
    -   Lampooned ruthlessly by the episode, in which the Captain lets his clothes be shot off by a hail of bullets, but when the Inspector fires his own gun, the Captain strikes him over the head with an umbrella and reminds him "No shooting, please." He even takes a punctual 5 o'clock tea break before breaking down the door.
-   Lord Monty Fisk from _Kim Possible_ fits the trope to a T in his first appearance before his Face–Heel Turn.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: The character Fancypants in the episode "Sweet and Elite". While all of the other upper-class ponies in Canterlot appear to be snobby and elitist, he is revealed to be a very kind, and polite gentleman. He even appreciates Rarity's less-than-fancy friends and the simplistic dress that she made for Twilight Sparkle.
-   Ferb's grandpa on _Phineas and Ferb_, albeit with that show, it's more like a parody of the stereotype than anything else. He has this to say on the trope in the episode "Just Desserts" (while exaggerating his accent):
    
    "Oh yes, and I'm British, so you think I'm supposed to like bird-watching. Ooh, I'm British, so I'll be in the conservatory with a cup of tea and a crumpet! I'm saying that, ironically, but actually, that sounds quite good. So, I'm going to do that. Ta!"
    
-   Lord Chumley in the _Transformers: Generation One_ episode "Prime Target". He even has his own Butler.
    
    "I say, Dinsmore, may I have some tea?"
    

    Real Life 

-   Stephen Fry is often placed in this trope in people's minds, something he admits to willingly going along with:
    
    **Fry:** ...it fits my self-image, or at least that image others have of me that I have rather weak-mindedly allowed to become my self-image.
