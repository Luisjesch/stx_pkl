_"The beast has failed. And when the beast has failed, it’s time to call in beauty."_

So you've got this character, usually female, always sexy. She might be the Dark Mistress, she might be the hero's girlfriend, a Femme Fatale, but who she is in relation to the story isn't really that important. The point is, she's hot. And hot chicks can do one thing really well. Seduce people and ensnare them in a Honey Trap.

When a hero resorts to this kind of tactic, their situation is getting pretty desperate. After all, My Girl Is Not a Slut. Not to mention the fact that having a villain be able to gloat about how they "did your girl" is something with major potential to be obnoxious. Oftentimes the hero doesn't resort to it at all — the Love Interest does, realizing that it would be very helpful in this particular situation but that there's no way he would feel comfortable asking her to do it.

Villains aren't usually bothered by this kind of exploitation. As long as the seduction is for the sake of the greater evil, they can overlook the minor detail that this is technically adultery, because they're evil. In this case it will often backfire and cause his Dark Mistress to feel sympathy (or love!) for the hero when he's supposed to be her enemy. This rarely happens the other way around.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the manga version of _Heat Guy J_, Trinity designs a buxom, scantily-clad robot girl to go seduce and strangle Clair's biggest (and ugliest) rival. (This does not happen in the anime version; Trinity does not exist, and Clair sent a tanker truck full of napalm to that rival instead of a sexy girl, human or otherwise.)
-   In the backstory of _Rurouni Kenshin_, a villain sends a woman to seduce Kenshin and find out his weakness. She goes along with it because Kenshin killed her fiancee. She falls in love with him, and the bad guys kidnap her to lead Kenshin to them. She accidentally dies by his hand, resulting in Kenshin vowing to never kill again once the war is over. Her little brother ends up being the Big Bad of the final arc.
-   Played with, and a major plot-point in the Yellow Scarves arc in _Durarara!!_. Two years prior to the series, Izaya told two of his followers, Saki Mikajima and Nozomi Kotonami, to date the head of the Yellow Scarves; Masaomi Kida, and his second-in-command; Koji Yatabe. Saki dated Masaomi and repetitively suggested he rely on Izaya for information. Masaomi was suspicious but when the Blue Squares became too much of a threat he gave in, eventually leading to Saki being kidnapped, the fall of the Blue Squares and Masaomi being guilt-ridden since then. Though, he and Saki did get back together after the latter finally acted against Izaya. In Nozomi's case, since Izaya's orders were to do whatever they felt like, she briefly dated Koji before dumping him.
-   _Gate_: While not an archnemesis, Bozes (the leader of Princess Pina's Amazon Brigade) is ordered to go sleep with Itami after nearly reigniting the Curb-Stomp Battle between the Empire and Japan (Bozes ran into Itami, and due to the absence of radio didn't know peace had been signed, so she captured him, treating him like a prisoner of war). And when she comes into Itami's bedroom, he's having a tea party with the castle's beastmen maids, so she slaps him. It leads to Princess Pina joining the diplomats to prevent further slipups.

    Comic Books 

-   _Wonder Woman_ Vol 1: Steve Trevor had been acting as a Honey Trap to gain intelligence for the US Army before he ever met Wonder Woman, and on at least two occasions pulled out that skillset to help distract and get information from a villain for her.
-   A rare heroic example is present in _Lumberjanes/Gotham Academy_; since Louise somehow sees Kyle as her long-dead crush Simon, the heroes have him pretend to be Simon so that she gets a happy birthday and the spell on her (and the lodge) can be lifted.

    Fan Works 

    Films — Animated 

-   _Aladdin_: When Aladdin tries to recover the lamp from Jafar, Jasmine sees him and promptly starts acting seductively toward Jafar, who she had only rebuffed a moment ago, as a diversion. She even gives him a "Shut Up" Kiss at a critical moment when the clanging of the lamp alerts Jafar to Aladdin's presence, but this only succeeds in causing Aladdin to stare at her in shock. This is based on the original story but there Aladdin explicitly tells the princess to pretend to be in love with the sorcerer, rather than just letting her know he's in the palace and acting as shocked as everyone else when she seduces his arch nemesis.
-   In _Heavy Metal 2000_, Julie herself actually goes and seduces Tyler to get close enough for the kill. She succeeds in delivering what should have been a mortal blow. Unfortunately, she doesn't know that Tyler has Resurrective Immortality.
-   In _Hercules_, Hades uses Meg to find out Hercules' weakness. She ends up falling in love with him... which gave Hades the leverage he was looking for in the first place.
    
    **Hades:** Perhaps I haven't been throwing the _right_ curves at him.
    
-   In _El Arca_, Panthy is sent by Dagnino to seduce Xiro.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Mission: Impossible II_. A particularly agonizing example. Ethan Hunt recruits Nyah without knowing her true purpose, and promptly beds and falls in love with her, only to find that Anthony Hopkins's ultra-pragmatic mission controller wants Nyah to seduce Ethan's archenemy (and Nyah's ex-boyfriend) Ambrose. Needless to say, Ethan is not happy.
-   _Batman (1989)_. Vicki Vale does this to the Joker while he's forcing her to dance with him. She saw Batman nearby and wanted to distract the Joker and give Batman a chance to attack him. It works (she's played by Kim Basinger, it should).
-   _The Girl, the Gold Watch and Everything_ (1981). Bonnie Lee Beaumont acts seductively toward Wesley Reins to trick him into a situation where he can be interrogated.
-   _Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me_. Happens twice: Ivana Humpalot is sent to seduce Austin, but does a Heel–Face Turn. Later Felicity Shagwell has sex with Fat Bastard in the line of duty.
    
    **Austin:** How could you do it?  
    **Felicity:** I was just doing my job.  
    **Austin:** No, I mean, literally; how could you _do_ it? The man's so fat, the sheer mechanics of it are mind-boggling.
    
-   _Blazing Saddles_: Hedley Lamarr sends Lili von Shtupp to seduce and abandon the Sheriff of Rock Ridge. She does a Heel–Face Turn too.
-   _Undercover Brother_. White She Devil is sent by Mr. Feather to seduce the title hero. It works for a while as she helps brainwash him. But when the good guys rescue and deprogram him, she reveals that she's fallen for him for real and performs a Heel–Face Turn to stay on the same side.
    -   Strangely, she then immediately switches to Smart Brother, likely seeing that Undercover Brother is already taken.
-   Dr. Elsa Schneider in _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_. She seduces both Drs. Jones at the Nazis' orders.
-   Eve in _North By Northwest_ was supposed to seduce Thornhill for the explicit purpose of leading him to his death in a cornfield. It doesn't work.
-   In another Alfred Hitchcock example, Devlin in _Notorious_ orders Alicia Huberman to sleep with the Nazi expatriate Alexander Sebastian. Alicia complies, and he berates her for it. Interestingly, when Devlin's superiors demonstrate the same hypocrisy toward Alicia that he has, Devlin defends her.
-   _The Rocketeer_: Initially Jenny is seduced by Neville, but later (when she realizes he's up to something) pretends to still be more interested in him than she really is.
-   A textbook procedure against James Bond. This usually results in a Sex–Face Turn. You'd think they'd learn.
-   In _Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid_, when the hero is captured, the lady apparently defects to the Big Bad, by saying she could be many things to him, including a word she uses in German. The hero asks him what that was, and the Big Bad says she said she could even be his "Cleaning Woman". This is the good guy's Berserk Button that when he hears it that allows him to defeat the Big Bad.
-   In _The Prestige_, Angier sends Olivia over to seduce Borden and steal his secrets; unfortunately for him she is so angered by this that she really _does_ side with Borden and the two double cross Angier.
-   _Sherlock Holmes (2009)_ (with Robert Downey Jr.) has Irene Adler, a seductive Femme Fatale and old rival to Holmes, who is paid by Professor Moriarty to try to snag, among other things, Holmes' heart. It's arguable whether she succeeds, or indeed whether she's succeeded previously; it's also strongly hinted by Moriarty himself that this is more of a case of Go Seduce My Arch Nemesis Who You're Kind Of In Love With Already, Or I'll Kill Him If You Don't.
-   In _High Plains Drifter_, a character resentful of the protagonist sends his wife to distract him with a romantic dinner and sex, and the plan was that afterward he and his gang would kill the protagonist while he had his guard down.
-   _Den of Thieves_: After a fight with his soon-to-be ex-wife, O'Brien goes to a strip-club and picks up the dancer who is Merrimen's girlfriend and has sex with her at her apartment, intending to both antagonize Merrimen and obtain information from the girl. This trope comes into play when the audience finds out that Merrimen _anticipated this_, let it happen and used her to feed O'Brien misinformation.
-   _Baby Burlesks_: In the short _Polly Tix in Washington_, a corrupt senator hires Polly Tix to seduce his opponent in the upcoming election and tempt him into taking a dive. This backfires when she falls for him for real, causing her to turn against the senator.
-   _Ajnabee_: Sonia's attempts to seduce Raj are actually just a part of her boyfriend's Vicky's Evil Plan to have Raj framed for their crimes, and she's not really attracted to Raj or unhappy with Vicky.

-   In _The City Who Fought_, the titular Space Station is invaded by an army of violent rapists. The inhabitants of the station, unable to fight back openly without being slaughtered, create a Synthetic Plague that must be spread at close range, ideally with direct contact.

The invaders are Stupid Evil caricatures, so they tend to either kill themselves or are killed by others when they show signs of "disabling illness".
-   This occurs a few times in Piers Anthony's _Incarnations of Immortality_ series. When you're the Incarnation of Evil and have hordes of Succubi and Incubi at your command, what do you have to lose by trying this? (Quite a lot, as it turns out.)

Sal asks if Don means he should have just done whatever Garner wanted, and Don doesn't say no. Sal stays fired.

It's happened to both Markiplier and Mangaminx.

    Western Animation 

-   In _The Venture Brothers_, the Monarch sends Doctor Girlfriend to do this against Doctor Venture as part of an elaborate scheme to turn him into some sort of caterpillar. This example explores the "don't you care about her having sex with another man?" angle rather bizarrely- The Monarch _watches_ the seduction with a bug and starts masturbating to it until one of his henchmen walk into the room.
    -   Which didn't stop him from having a Villain BSOD once Dr. Girlfriend began to _sympathize_ with Rusty.
        -   Though it's mentioned in another episode that The Monarch watching Dr. Mrs. The Monarch have sex with other men is a relatively common occurence. Apparently they're into cuckolding.
        -   Even more hilarious, this apparently stopped because where the Monarch originally thought it was hot, he started to feel really _pathetic_.
-   In _Superman: The Animated Series_, Lana Lang decides to take the initiative and attempts this on Lex Luthor despite Superman's protests. It helped Lana was already dating Luthor, allaying his suspicions for a short while.
