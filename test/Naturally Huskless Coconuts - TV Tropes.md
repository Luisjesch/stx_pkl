In Real Life, coconut trees produce coconut fruit all year round. There's a bunch of different cultivars of coconut palm, and the appearance of their fruit varies wildly—anything from smooth and pointy like an almond fruit to fibrous and round like a pecan fruit. Usually, there are a few dozen coconut fruit growing at any given time per tree.

However, often in fiction, only seeds of coconuts can be seen growing on palm trees, with the fruit (also known as the husk) nowhere to be seen. Moreover, in fiction, often only a handful of coconut seeds can be seen hanging from the palm tree.

Why does this trope happen? Because only the seed is eaten, the husk is usually removed before the seed goes to food markets. Therefore, anyone who hasn't personally seen them growing or being harvested is only used to seeing coconuts without the husk, so the classic "cartoon coconut" looks like the seed part with the three dots and fuzz. Some even mistake the coconut shell as the fruit like it is with hazelnuts.

On the other side of the coin, some types of coconut fruit also turn brown and woody as they mature, making them look more like the seed.

It's fairly common for this trope to be implied by showing huskless coconuts falling to the ground (or someone's head) but not showing the top of the tree itself.

This trope is most common in Western media, as coconut trees are absent in many regions of Europe and North America. It's more common in amateur illustrations as well. The first uses of this trope date back at least to the early 20th century.

Meanwhile, coconut trees are more likely to be realistically depicted in media made in countries where coconut trees are common. In East Asian media, green coconut fruits are the most commonly shown.
