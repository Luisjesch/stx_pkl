_"No matter what scars you bear  
Whatever uniform you wear  
You can fight like a krogan  
Run like a leopard  
But you'll never be better than Commander Shepard!"_

Maybe because it sounds really cool, but _Commander_ is a very popular rank in fiction.

In real life navies, "Commander" is the second-most senior field rank, right below the rank of Captain. A commander is usually the first officer (i.e. the Number Two) of a large ship, but can also be the commanding officer (a.k.a. The Captain) of a smaller ship. There is also a "Lieutenant Commander" rank directly below, who will be either an assistant to these officers or the captain of a smaller ship. Some air forces have a "Wing Commander" rank that is equivalent to a naval commander. In an army, the equivalent is either major or lieutenant colonel, depending on the country. When it's not used as a rank, it may still be used in a role title (e.g. "unit commander", "mission commander").

When using Common Ranks, is subordinate to Colonel Badass<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and superior to Majorly Awesome. When used as a General Staff Rank, is usually superior to The Brigadier and subordinate only to the Four-Star Badass. Outside of militaries, some large police forces have a commander rank for officers (e.g. London, Los Angeles and Chicago). This rank sits between the assistants of the chief and the local police station managers.

In science fiction, commanders usually have their traditional position as executive officer. Some works will have commander as the highest senior rank on a starship or a general staff rank, along with the title or rank (or both) of the supreme leader of military forces. A commander who is decidedly uncool may be a Commander Contrarian.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Berserk_, Griffith's trusted female lieutenant Casca is addressed as Commander. As the Band of the Hawk was a mercenary unit, not a lot of attention was paid to ranks in the band.
-   In _Bleach_, we have Captain-Commander Shigekuni Yamamoto-Genryusai.
-   Batou's rank in his military days, long a subject of debate in the GitS fandom, was finally stated in _Ghost in the Shell: Arise_ to be Commander,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  though how it translates into the franchise as a whole is unclear.
-   _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_ & _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny_: Due to it's status as a former militia, most of ZAFT's officers are addressed as "Commander". This includes the very cool Andrew Waldfeld and Rau Le Creuset in the first series, and former Ace Pilot turned ship captain, Yzak Joule in the sequel.
-   In _Naruto_, we have Shikaku Nara, the Jounin Commander of Konoha, who acts as a right-hand man to Tsunade.
-   _Super Dimension Fortress Macross_ has Lt. Commander Roy Focker, the commander of the air wing for the Macross, at least until he falls to the guns of Miria Fallyna.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Comic Books 

-   Cobra Commander in _G.I. Joe_.
-   Commander Dynamic of the book/comic book series _Limekiller at Large_.
-   The Director of SHIELD is referred to as Commander. Nick Fury, however, most often went by his prior Army rank of Colonel. Captain Steve Rogers, a later director, went by Commander.
-   _Star Wars: Kanan_: Commander Grey is a cheerful and highly loyal badass commander to Depa, who is the only known individual to go against Order 66 without having his control chip removed, though he did kill Depa before overcoming the chip. He calmly commits a Heroic Suicide in order to make up for what he did for the Emperor and protect Kanan.

    Fan Works 

-   _Chronicles of the Siren War_: Commander Thorson is the main character of the story and leads the Azur Lane forces. The kansen generally refer to Thorson by whatever variation of the title they use in their respective home nations.
    -   "_Commander (Eagle Union)_"
    -   "_Shikikan (Sakura Empire)_"
    -   "_Knight Commander (Royal Navy)_"
    -   "_Kommandant (Iron Blood)_"
-   _A Diplomatic Visit_:
    -   The changelings' military leaders and hive second-in-commands are referred to as "Commander", with Pharynx being the most prominent one seen in-story.
    -   Princess Luna is Commander in Chief of all branches of the Equestrian Military and out-ranks _everyone_ in them as a result. This also puts her in functional control of the country while they're at war, with everyone (even Celestia) referring to her as "Commander" for the duration, as happens when a declaration of war is made against the Storm King and his armies in chapter 5 of the second story.
-   Rainbow Dash's CO in _Legionnaire_ is not only one cool SoB, but he's also clever enough to keep up with masterminds like Diplomatic Incident and Prophet.

    Film — Animated 

-   Commander Rourke in _Atlantis: The Lost Empire_.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   Commander William Harper in _Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit_. Given how proficient he is in a firefight, it's likely he was a Navy SEAL.
-   Commander James Bond, at your service.
    -   He's addressed as such in _On Her Majesty's Secret Service_, _The Spy Who Loved Me_, while he banters with Xenia Onatopp in _GoldenEye_ and seen in uniform in _You Only Live Twice_, _The Spy Who Loved Me_, and _Tomorrow Never Dies_.
    -   Even more so in the _Casino Royale (2006)_ continuity. In the original, he was a member of the Royal Navy Reserve. Daniel Craig's Bond was a member of the Special Boat Service, which is the British equivalent of the Navy SEALs. Though Bond's service record has him being one of those occasional Royal Navy officers who are deployed as Swimmer Canoeists.
-   The 2015 film adaption of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. mentions that (soon to be Chief of U.N.C.L.E.) Alexander Waverly is a Commander in British Naval Intelligence. This may be a direct Shout-Out to the _James Bond_ movie series, since the original TV series has described been described as "James Bond on television" by its lead actor, Robert Vaughn.
-   In _Morning Departure_, The Captain of the wrecked submarine _HMS Trojan_ is the exceedingly cool under pressure Lieutenant Commander Peter Armstrong.
-   Jack Harper from _Oblivion (2013)_ is this. The real one, in any case. He was commander of the "Odyssey" mission. Beech takes some particular delight in saying "Welcome Back, Commander" when he decides to help them.
-   The _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ films have Riker. He logs plenty of command time while Picard is busy with the main plot. (Spock, a commander in the original TV series, was promoted to the rank of Captain for the movies, though he still acted as Kirk's Number Two.)
-   In _Star Trek Into Darkness_, Kirk is briefly demoted to commander. He spends that time trying to shoot down a jumpship with a phaser rifle, before managing to bring it down by throwing the rifle (with a firehose tied around it) into its air intake.
-   _Star Wars_
    -   This is perhaps the most common rank. By _Return of the Jedi_, all the Imperial officers were commanders (even Admiral Piett) due to a costuming goof. Perhaps the most noteworthy individual one is Commander Jir in _A New Hope_ who acts an Honest Advisor to Vader who apparently respects his opinion. Although there is an argument that 'Commander' is just an honorific applicable to all officers rather than a reference to a specific rank.
    -   In _The Force Awakens_, Poe Dameron is a commander of the Resistance, making him one of the highest ranking officers (after General Leia Organa and the admirals).

    Literature 

-   Lieutenant Jack Aubrey receiving his promotion to the rank of Master and Commander is very almost the first thing that happens in the _Aubrey-Maturin_ series. As the second type of Commander mentioned above, namely one with command of his own ship, he is always referred to as "Captain Aubrey" as with all officers who command naval vessels, but does not receive promotion to full Post-captain until later in the series, making him this trope to begin with.
-   Commander Sam Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch in _Discworld_ - promoted from Captain at the end of _Men at Arms_.
-   Commander Peter Raeder and Lieutenant Commander Sarah James, Commonwealth Space Command, from _The Flight Engineer_.
-   The first _Honor Harrington_ book features Commander Harrington, of the HMS _Fearless_, a heavily-modified Light Cruiser. She would be promoted to Captain by the next book, and would eventually become an Admiral (in multiple navies), with such titles as Commander, Protector's Own Squadron, Commander, Eighth Fleet, and later Commander, Home Fleet.
-   James Bond held the rank of Commander in the Royal Navy before he joined MI6, as also noted in Film above.
    -   In _Win, Lose or Die_ by John Gardner, Bond returns is returned to active service in the Royal Navy as part of an assignment and promoted to Captain: a rank he retains for the rest of Gardner's novels.
-   _The Lost Fleet_ has a number of commanders in command of ships. Most of them are fairly young due to the heavy attrition of the Forever War. In particular, Commander Jaylen Cresida (later promoted to Captain) of The Alliance battlecruiser _Furious_ is a young but brilliant commander whose knowledge of hypernet gates saves not only the fleet but humanity as a whole. She's also a capable ship commander.
-   _The Pentagon War_: In the Human-Centauri Defense Force, Commander is short for "Battle Commander", and is a temporary title bestowed on a spacecraft's C.O. for only as long as a Red Alert situation exists.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_ takes the coolness to the next level with the rank of _Lord_ Commander, which seems to be the highest military rank in Westeros, as evidenced by the Kingsguard, the City Watch, and the Night Watch. (The commander of the Golden Company, widely regarded as the world's best mercenaries, goes by Captain\-General, but part of the point of the Golden Company is that they tend to stay _away_ from Westeros.)
-   _Star Wars Expanded Universe_:
    -   Luke Skywalker ends up a commander in the Rebellion not long after _A New Hope_.
    -   In most of the _X-Wing Series_, Rogue and Wraith Squadrons are headed by Commander Antilles. Then he accepts a promotion to General.
    -   The short story _Blade Squadron_ has Rebel Wing Commander Adon Fox, leader of Blade Squadron.
-   The highest rank in the Children of the Light in _The Wheel of Time_ is "Lord Captain Commander".

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The 100_ _had_ Commander Lexa, military leader and ruler of the twelve clans.
-   _Babylon 5_:
    -   In season one Commander Sinclair is in charge of the station with Lt. Commander Ivanova as his Number Two.
    -   Ivanova is promoted to full Commander at the start of season two when Captain Sheridan takes over. This is probably because Sinclair was never in command of a ship. The most he ever flew was a Starfury during the Battle of the Line. Sheridan actually had his own ship by the time he was re-assigned to B5.
-   Commander William Adama of the Battlestar _Galactica_. Enough said.
-   Commander John Crichton of _Farscape_. "Commander" is apparently the rank he achieved as an astronaut for IASA (international expy of NASA); his crew members continue to use this title for him throughout the show. Even though it's not really a military rank, it sometimes comes in handy during their many, many encounters with hostile military forces.
-   Commander Harmon Rabb, Jr. in _JAG_.
-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power_: Galadriel is the Commander of the Northern Armies. She is often addressed as such by other characters.
-   Commander Anubis Cruger, of _Power Rangers S.P.D._; head of Earth's branch of the Space Police. A later Reunion Show reveals that he eventually gets promoted to _Supreme_ Commander of the entire organization.
-   John Koenig, Commander of Moonbase Alpha in _Space: 1999_. Although, as Alpha is a civilian, scientific installation, it's not a military rank.
-   _Supreme_ Commander Thor, leader of the Asgard in _Stargate SG-1_.
-   In Season 2 of _Stargate Atlantis_, Major John Sheppard is promoted to Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard. He is also the Commanding Military Officer throughout the majority of the series, apart from one episode where he doesn't receive the title until the end of the episode.
-   Comes up all the time in _Star Trek_
    -   Benjamin Sisko of _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ started off as a commander, as he was in charge of a station instead of a starship. He actually got his own ship at the beginning of season 3, but wasn't fully promoted until the end of the season. Lampshaded in-series when several of his crew remark that "it's about damn time", though he plays it cool and points out that the formal promotion doesn't change anything on a day-to-day level (he already had the command post and the ship that he wanted).
    -   Also on DS9, Kira Nerys, who was already a Colonel Badass in Season 7, became a Commander in Starfleet to help anti-Dominion rebels.
    -   The first officers of every other _Star Trek_ series have been of this rank.
    -   Commander Shran of the Andorian Imperial Guard on _Star Trek: Enterprise_.
    -   Also with quite a few of the Lieutenant Commanders, especially Worf and Tuvok.
    -   Many of the villainous alien captains (Romulans, Klingons, Tholians, etc) are given the "Commander" title, presumably to avoid The Good Captain trope while keeping the coolness. One notable aversion would be Koloth from the Original Series, whose rank was Captain.
        -   Commander seems to be the Romulan equivalent to The Captain.
        -   Their equivalent of the Starfleet rank of Commander would be Sub-Commander. This also applies to pre-Federation Vulcans (e.g. Sub-Commander T'pol).
-   Commander Taylor, leader of Terra Nova. Hell, he uses a _crossbow_ as a fishing tool!
-   Commander Straker in _UFO (1970)_. This seems, on the surface, an odd rank for him to have as, although SHADO is actually a military organisation, with Captains, Lieutenants and the like, it does not have a naval structure. The explanation may be that Straker was a Colonel in his Air Force days, but he has at least two Colonels as subordinates and a General, the next rank up, in (nominal) command of him so the title may be a way of emphasising his unique position as the man in absolute charge of Earth's defences.

    Music 

-   Commander of The Protomen.
-   "Commander" by Kelly Rowland.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _BattleTech_, the rank Galaxy Commander is very high rank among the Clans, its should be the equivalent of General in the Inner Sphere, as they command an entire regiment called a galaxy, and they have a big say in the Clans policies and decisions. One of the prerequisites of the rank is to be a real badass mechwarrior.
-   The rank of Lord Commander in _Warhammer 40,000_. None moreso than Lord Commander Dante, Chapter Master of the Blood Angels.
    -   For Space Marine Commanders, one presiding over a battlegroup of several chapters for an engagement is referred to by the even cooler "Force Commander"
    -   Imperial Guard Commanders appear to be junior flag officers, possibly somewhere around brigadier. Lord Commander of the Segmentum is a much higher combined arms rank, the five joint highest in the Imperium answerable directly to the council of High Lords.
    -   Noteworthy for being used inconsistently. Other sources use the title Commander like the actual NATO navies use it, being the second in command of a large warship. There is also a Lord Commander Militant, the leader of the entire Imperial conventional Guard and Stormtroopers, who _is_ a High Lord, and the Lord Commander Solar, who is the Militant Commander's highest-ranking officer and usually also on the Senate of the High Lords. There is also, so long as a Primarch or their successor present to take the role, the Lord Commander of the Imperium, who is usually Primarch Roboute Guilliman, though this rank was disbanded after the coup called The Beheading. Guilliman reinstated it later, and holds it in the 'present time' of the 40K timeline.
    -   A Space Marine "Commander" is simply the highest ranked Space Marine in a force. If a Space Marine battlegroup takes _really_ bad casualties, then the senior Battle-Brother would be "Commander". Force Commanders can also be younger Brothers in line for promotion, given command of a few squads or half-squads for the duration of a surgical strike, to demonstrate leadership skills.

    Video Games 

-   _Call of Duty: Black Ops_: Seal Team Six Commander and son of Alex Mason, David Mason has to apply from what we've seen of him.
-   In the _Command & Conquer_ games, the player is called a "Commander" by subordinates and superiors alike. There are exceptions: in the _Generals_ incarnations, the player holds the title of "General", while in _Red Alert_'s USSR faction, the player is a "Comrade-General".
    -   Throughout the Soviet campaign in _Red Alert 1_, you are referred to as "Commander"... right until the very last sentence spoken, which calls you Comrade Chairman.
    -   The ending of _Red Alert 3_'s Soviet campaign implies that the player character is _literally called 'Commander'_ with the proposal to rename New York in your honor naming the city as 'Kommandersgrad'. How cool is that?!
-   The Space Marine's leader in _Dawn of War_ of the _Warhammer 40,000_ universe is called Force Commander. 'Force Commander' actually refers to the senior Space Marine officer in charge of a campaign, regardless of how many Chapters are present. For example: Davian Thule is the Captain of the 4th Company, but in Dark Crusade, he was the Commander of the strike force, having authority over the other companies and their captains present.
-   Although the three members of _Detectives United_ are all of equal rank and don't have a defined leader, their Alternate Dimension counterpart organization is apparently run by "Commander Brown," according to a document found in the third game.
-   _Dragon Age_
    -   The highest-ranking Grey Warden in a nation is known as the Warden-Commander, with their only superior being the "First Warden", who manages the order from Weisshaupt Fortress in the Anderfels. The first game's Player Character becomes Warden-Commander of Ferelden in the _Awakening_ expansion; they basically inherited the post from Duncan, who recruited them during their origin story, although he was never actually identified by his rank during his time in the game.
    -   Similarly, the highest-ranking Templar at a Circle of Magi is the local Knight-Commander. Kirkwall's Knight-Commander Meredith is one of the major players in _Dragon Age II_. She does not officially order around the lord of the city, but nor does he dare do anything that would go against her wishes, making her the actual most powerful person.
    -   The Dwarf Noble Warden briefly held the title of "Commander of Orzammar's Armies" during their Origin.
    -   Your companion Sten is an Infantry Platoon Commander of the Qunari. Too bad he doesn't have his men with him anymore. Or his sword.
    -   In _Dragon Age: Inquisition_, Cullen's title as head of the Inquisition's military force is simply "Commander." This is probably due at least in part to his previous role as Kirkwall's provisional Knight-Commander after the events of the second game; it made the transition easier on those who knew him there.
-   When Squall in _Final Fantasy VIII_ is summarily put in charge of SeeD, an official title for the position doesn't actually exist, Balamb Garden having operated more as a school than a military organization up to that point. Squall's friends sit down without him and decide on "Commander," presumably on the basis that it sounds appropriately martial and cool.
-   _Galaxy Angel_: Tact Mayers starts out officially with the rank of Captain, but he's referred to as Commander of the Elsior throughout the entire trilogy. Even at the end of Eternal Lovers, when he's given to lead the entire Transbaal Navy, he's named _Supreme_ Commander rather than say, Admiral.
-   _Guild Wars 2_: Partway through the personal story, the player character helps organize the Pact and is given the rank of Commander. The title becomes the default way NPCs refer to/about you, even after stepping down from an active role in the Pact to organize Dragon's Watch''.
-   _Halo_ has several:
    -   On the Spartan side, we have Commander Carter-A259 and Lieutenant Commander Catherine-B320 from _Halo: Reach_.
    -   On the spaceship commander side, we have Commander Miranda Keyes from the original trilogy and Commander Thomas Lasky from _Halo 4_ (though he's a Captain in all subsequent appearances).
    -   The expanded universe also gives us Lieutenant Commander Kurt-051 (he was given the fake last name "Ambrose" as part of the promotion, but Halsey reveals that his real last name is "Trevelyan"), Lieutenant Commander Jameson Locke (before he became a Spartan), and Jacob Keyes (before he became The Captain).
-   _Mass Effect_'s protagonist, Commander Shepard, fits this trope.
    -   In _Mass Effect 2_, during Tali's loyalty mission, the quarians refer to Shepard as "Captain". A dialogue option is available to give Shepard's actual rank, but the quarians (mostly) stick with Captain, as it accurately reflects the cultural role the character is taking by speaking up for Tali, as well as being Commanding Officer of the _Normandy_, meaning Shepard _is_ The Captain in all-but-name.
    -   In the Russian version of the game, Shepard is referred to as "Captain". This has to do with the fact that Russian Navy equivalent of a "Commander" is a "Captain, 2nd Rank", the short form of which is just "Captain" (similar to the short form of "Lt. Commander" being "Commander").
    -   In the third game, assuming she survives the first, Ashley Williams will be promoted to Lieutenant Commander.
-   In _The Sims Medieval_ when your Knight achieves level 10, his or her title is "Commander." And a level 10 Knight, particularly if they've bought or acquired good gear, is quite badass.
-   The Terran's Non-Entity General in all _Starcraft_ games is referred to as Commander by all units (including the Battlecruiser, who is supposed to be a Commodore).
    -   Storywise, in the first game, you start out as a Confederate Magistrate, until you bust Raynor out of his court martial and join La Résistance, at which point you are referred to Commander.
    -   In the _Brood War_ expansion, you are instead The Captain, serving under the two Admirals sent by the United Earth Directorate.
-   _Warhammer: Dark Omen:_ Morgan Bernhardt, leader of the Grudgebringers, insists on "Commander" rather than going by "Captain" like most mercenary company leaders do. A lot of people he meets seem to consider his choice of title rather grandiose, though the Grudgebringers are large and well-equipped enough that not settling for "Captain" may be justified.
-   In _World of Warcraft_' expansion, Warlords of Draenor, this is the title given to the player character when they takes command of their garrison.
-   In _Xenoblade Chronicles 3_ commander is the rank given to the leading officers of each colony.

    Web Comics 

    Western Animation 

-   In _Avatar: The Last Airbender_, Zhao is initially greeted as Captain Zhao by Iroh, but smugly corrects him by pointing out he's been promoted to Commander (presumably promoted; "Captain" usually outranks "Commander" in the Navy, but he was definitely acting like it was a promotion... it's probably because "Commander" sounds cooler, plus that way there's a close equivalence in Fire Navy and Army ranks, with Lieutenants and Captains in both, Colonels and Generals in the Army, and Commanders and Admirals (of which Zhao becomes one of a few appearances later) in the Navy.
-   Commander Nebula in _Buzz Lightyear of Star Command_, who used to masquerade as a bounty hunter to help Zurg's minions escape and even has a laser in his peg leg.
-   Commander Clash, a recurring character in _Captain Planet and the Planeteers_
-   Cobra Commander in _G.I. Joe_.
-   In _The Legend of Korra_, there's Commander Bumi of the United Forces, Tenzin's brother.
-   In _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_, many clone officers including Commander Cody. Jedi Padawans like Ahsoka Tano are also called "Commander" by the clones, while fully-fledged Jedi are called "General".
-   And _Star Wars Rebels_ gives us Commander Jun Sato of the Rebel Alliance.
-   In _Thunder Cats 2011_ Leo, a The Mole and Rebel Leader for La Résistance, is the Lieutenant Commander for an Evil Overlord who holds the rank of Commander himself. Leo and his allies are plotting a revolution to overthrow him.
-   In _Transformers: Animated_, Ultra Magnus is _Supreme_ Commander of the Autobots at large, with the Prime rank closer to The Captain. In _Transformers: Prime_, he's again subordinate to Optimus but still referred to as "Commander".
