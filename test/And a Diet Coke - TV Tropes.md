"I'm watching my weight."

_"I'd like 20 tacos of grilled meat, some pozole with pork legs… oh, and a large diet soda, 'cause I want to lose weight!"_

— "La Dieta", **Mexican group La Fresa**

When a character (usually a Big Eater, scarfing junk food at an alarming rate), pauses to make one tiny concession to health. Bonus points if they act like this counterbalances the calories they've just consumed.

This is a standard comedic effect used in various media to emphasize the overindulgence that came before. In various talk shows that featured exceptionally obese people, they would often show a fast food customer ordering an exceptionally large meal including multiple sandwiches/fries/desserts, and concluding with, "and a Diet Coke."

Despite being a staple joke on obesity and hypocrisy (especially the trusted "Americans are fatasses" routine), it happens in Real Life for various legitimate reasons. Diabetics may not be concerned about their intake of savories but must watch their sugar. Some people might also just _prefer_ the taste of diet sodas. For instance, Diet Coke has its own distinct formula, and many people prefer it over regular Coca-Cola for being less sweet. Finally, even from the much-mocked calorie intake standpoint it actually does make sense — a 1,000-calorie gut bomb with a diet soda may be silly on its face, but it's still relatively better than a 1,200-calorie meal with a regular soft drink! A heavy soda drinker can see a tremendous benefit from cutting those calories, as soft drinks are the biggest source of sucrose and fructose in fast food. Also, unless the comedic effect stems from the juxtaposition of ordering large number of sugary foods and a sugar-free soda, a large meal with 'diet' drink is common among people working on muscle building, who tend to eat a lot of fats and proteins while limiting the intake of carbohydrates.

Variations of the trope may include 1.) having the dieter eat so many of the low-calorie or low-fat foods that it adds up to the same calories or fat as the regular meal would have been, and 2.) having the dieter eat the low-calorie or low-fat entree in addition to, rather than instead of, what they normally eat.

Related to Hypocritical Humor, and also overlaps with Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking. A specific example of the Perfect Solution Fallacy.

    "But please without garlic, because then I will visit my girlfriend."
    

    Literature 

-   In _Bridge of Birds_, there's a morbidly obese merchant who orders an obscene meal, but then passes on dessert because he says he needs to watch his diet.
    
    **Ten Ox:** Master Li, you won't believe this, but that merchant began with four large tureens of pimento and dumpling soup. Then he devoured three bowls of mussel stew, a pound of pickled mallows, two pounds of steamed snails, three servings of soft-shelled crabs, two plates of sweetmeats, ten honey cakes, and a watermelon. The proprietor wondered whether the esteemed guest might care for six or seven quarts of peaches in heavy syrup, but the merchant explained that he was on a diet and would be forced to settle for a gallon of green tea flavored with pine kernels.
    
-   In Chapter 3 of the Dean Koontz novel _Cold Fire_, reporter Holly Thorne goes to a bakery for lunch, orders five different pastries, then asks for a Diet Coke.

When he looks incredulous at the combination, she justifies having diet soda over regular by saying that "I need the endorphins from the chocolate, but there's no sense in adding empty calories."
-   Subverted in one of the _Sweet Valley High_ thrillers; Jessica is waitressing when an obese guy is rude to her while placing an order. She pointedly gives his thin wife the milkshake he ordered and gives him a Diet Coke instead.
-   _Wax and Wayne_: _The Bands of Mourning_ has a variation: Wax, in order to use his powers, needs to drink steel flakes in a non-aqueous solution in order to be effective in combat. He prefers whiskey. His wife, Steris, prefers cod liver oil.
    
    **Steris:** A wife needs to look after her husband's health.
    
-   At one point in _Will Grayson, Will Grayson_, Tiny orders - much to the waiter's bemusement - four hot dogs with buns, three hot dogs without buns, a bowl of chili, and a Diet Coke. Justified as he's trying to build more muscle, so he needs plenty of protein, but has no use for sugar.

Monica tends to worry about her weight a bit because she used to be fat, but, considering the amount of take-away Chinese and pizzas she eats, the Diet Coke isn't much of a calorie saving.
-   _Kenny vs. Spenny_: In the episode "Who Can be Obese the Longest", Kenny puts himself in fat prosthetic makeup as a part of faking an extra 80 pounds of weight. He makes a lot of gags for the audience. He eats bread being fed to pigeons, he hits on an ice-cream vendor, and he orders (at a drive-thru on a moped) a meal of several deluxe burgers...

Oh, and a diet soda. Seeing the looks Jack, Daniel and the waitress are giving her, she protests "I like the taste better!"
-   Defended by Donna on _Suits_:

-   In _Robot Chicken's Star Wars_, two of the space slugs order out for Chinese food, including 5 million tons of Kung Pao chicken, 3 million pot stickers, 5 million tons of fried rice and... one order of scallion pancakes.
-   In an episode of _Rocko's Modern Life_, Rocko and Heffer are behind a rotund pig woman at the movie concession stand, and she orders a substantial amount of snacks... "and a diet soda. After all, I've gotta watch my girlish figure."
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   The joke is taken a step further when, after Homer orders an assortment of fried foods from Krusty Burger and the clerk offers to deep-fry the bag. He accepts the offer, and then asks for "a Diet Coke. Deep-fried."
    -   While at an ice cream parlor, Homer is on his health-kick, so he orders a low-fat vanilla topped with a bunch of bland-named junk food and candy products.
    -   In an early episode Homer goes on a diet, so Marge introduces him to rice cakes. She tells him they're only 35 calories a piece, but he can add a little something for flavour. Homer piles the cake high with toppings and then says "mmm, only 35 calories!"
    -   When Homer first meets the wide pride advocates, they have a table with several fattening foods and cans of Diet Coke.
    -   The beginning of "Homer's Triple Bypass" shows Homer eating full unhealthy meals before bed including a bottle of diet cola.
-   Occurs in not one but two episodes of _Sons of Butcher_. In the first one, Ricky orders most of the greasy spoon diner's menu, deep fried (even the friend chicken!), but adds a diet coke to watch his weight. The other time, he orders a very processed cheese-heavy meal from a fast food restaurant with regular cokes. But when Doug points out the fat contents, Ricky agrees... and switches his cokes to diet.
-   _Spongebob Squarepants_: A variation in “Pickles”: when the hefty customer Bubble Bass steps up to the counter, Squidward sarcastically remarks “Let me guess: a small salad.”
-   In _Teen Titans_, Cyborg does this at an entirely meat based restaurant. He orders multiple _combo meals_ in rapid succession, then stops and asks for a diet soda. But when told they do not have soda (only meat), he simply asks for a cup of meat juice. Being a cyborg as well as in shape makes this lesser than most examples.
-   In the 1987 _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ series, Rocksteady asks the secretary, "Bring me five hundred jelly donuts and a diet soda. I'm trying to watch my weight."
-   An episode of _Tiny Toon Adventures_ has one when Plucky finds a bottle from a wave:
    
    **Hamton:** Gee, Plucky, nice trick! Order me a hamburger, onion rings, and a double shake...  
    _\[Buster and Babs give mean looks at Hamton\]_  
    **Hamton:** ...and a diet cola.
    
-   _Todd McFarlane's Spawn_ during one episode, has this between detectives Twitch and his obese partner Sam. After the two talk about Fat Tony and the mob, Sam sends Twitch out on a doughnut run:
    
    **Twitch**: "Your usual dozen Sir?"
    
    **Sam** "Half that, you know I'm on a diet."
    
-   _The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat_: Roscoe and Felix got a new TV set and Felix bought several snacks for the two of them to eat. Instead of stating how much each snack cost, the cashier shamed Felix by stating how many calories each snack had. When the cashier asked if there was anything else Felix wanted, he showed a diet soda.
-   _Wander over Yonder_: "The Helper" has Lord Hater step into a diner and order 5,075 Frivolity Meals, 689 pies and two diet cokes.
