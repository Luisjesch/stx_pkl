Maybe you ran out of time to fix the killer poison. Maybe you're made of paint or something. Maybe someone froze you and then heated you up really fast. Or, maybe you opened the Ark of the Covenant. Maybe you fell into lava or acid or something else that makes people melt. Point is, you're about to learn how a snowman feels in the spring.

I'm Melting is when a character or other life form, for one reason or another, has a literal meltdown. It might look like:

-   **Collapsing into lumpy goo:**. Probably one of the best and nastiest looking meltdowns one can find, it basically occurs when the subject slowly turns to goo all over, flesh falling and dripping from their body onto the floor. It doesn't usually leave a viscous puddle either, so much as a pile of soggy dough. This method was popularized by _Raiders of the Lost Ark_, and was cause for many a nightmare among kids at the time.
-   **From the ground up**. The most classic example, in which only the part of the subject that touches the ground actually turns to liquid. Of course, this means that, sequentially, every part of the body will touch the ground, often giving the illusion of sinking into a shallow puddle. (The easiest way to stage this effect in live-action settings is to do exactly that, lowering the actor on a hidden trap door, often with their clothing gathering on the ground for added effect. See _The Wizard of Oz_ or any of several _Star Trek_ episodes.) Oddly, the victim will never be considered dead until their head has melted, which will be alive and speaking until the end despite their heart and lungs melting beforehand.
-   **Soda pop**. This one was quite popular with Disney cartoons in the early to mid-'90s. In short, this one is very similar to _From the ground up_, except with the added effect of being very, VERY fizzy. Bubbles tend to actually rise off of the subject and pop in mid-air. Imagine an alka-seltzer sitting in a puddle of water, and you've got the idea here. Sometimes this will leave a nice clean puddle as if the resultant soda went flat, but other times, the subject may completely dissolve into a shrinking pile of fizz, or conveniently evaporate to leave nothing behind.
-   **Bones**. One of the rarest types of meltdown, this is when everything but the skeleton is reduced to a puddle of Pepto-Bismol. Truth in Television, since bones, especially human bones, are very difficult to completely destroy. Cremated remains are mainly bits of bone — everything else evaporates. Another Nightmare Fuel method of melting someone.
-   **Vaporization**. This is regarded as melting, but looks like it didn't just stop with turning the victim to a liquid. In fact, often, the liquid isn't even seen. It's as if they skipped a step, steaming and sublimating from the ground up.

This is a common fate of enemies weak to water, sunlight, salt, certain poisons/acids, and of course, deconstructive nanobots.

Note that this can be a subtrope of No Body Left Behind and Everything Fades, although it can lead to Empty Piles of Clothing in works where Shapeshifting Excludes Clothing. It can also be played for comedic effect, with the victim restored to normal in the next scene. A subtrope of this is Lustful Melt. When the character in question doesn't die and is played for laughs, it's Harmless Liquefaction.

Due to the fact in fiction people often say this when they are melting (often as a Stock Shout-Out to _The Wizard of Oz_), this could be considered an example of Captain Obvious.

## As this is a Death Trope, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.
