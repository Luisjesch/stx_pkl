_"You'll be my slave in Mycenae. A Trojan priestess scrubbing my floors."_

— **Agamemnon** to **Briseis**, _Troy_

The villain is defeated, and the next time they are seen, if they are seen, as a form of Irony, they are performing menial tasks, sometimes (though not always) on their (no longer) own premises, such as where they work or live, often as a janitor or cleaning up animal dung, and almost always with a look of utter humiliation on their faces. Often may come during the end credits.

A Sub-Trope of Cool and Unusual Punishment and Bad Job, Worse Uniform, the latter which the villain may be forced to wear to add insult to injury. Also may be a form of Humiliation Conga, as the laborer may suffer further humiliation of some sort while laboring. See also Prisoner's Work and Working on the Chain Gang, where the hard labor is part of a criminal punishment.

## As this usually happens as an Ending Trope, beware of unmarked spoilers!

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Doraemon: Nobita in the Wan-Nyan Spacetime Odyssey_ has the main villain, Jara the evil cat billionaire, intending to hijack the time machine for himself and abandon the other cat and dog citizens to their doom; but he is ultimately stopped by the combined efforts of Nobita, Doraemon, Hachi and their friends. In the final scene where the population of cats and dogs are in their evacuation vessel escaping their soon-to-be-destroyed planet, Jara and his mooks are shown as janitors mopping the transport's deck.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_:
    -   One of the more corrupt military officials, Yorki, goes from a governor of a mine town he was overtaxing to working as a commoner after Ed's defeats him. Though his fate depends on which version you're watching.
        -   In _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_, he ends up homeless and taken in by Isvahlans until he sees Scar and reports him in the hope he'll regain his position, but is shot dead by the Homunculi to spark discord for the Big Bad's plans.
        -   In the manga and Brotherhood anime, he becomes a reluctant ally to the protagonists despite his wrongdoings, and in the end, ends up working at a circus as a clown.
    -   In the 2003 anime, this also extends to the anime-only character Lyra, who acts as Yorki's enforcer. After Ed defeats her, she's seen again working as a maid under Dante, though legitimately turned over a new leaf. Unfortunately, Dante manipulates and steals her body later on.

    -   Magellan is a more sympathetic example. Unlike most antagonists in the series, he's not evil and took his job as warden of Impel Down very seriously, wanting to make sure the most dangerous criminals of the prison are locked up tight so the outside world can feel safer. That put him at odds against Luffy, who broke in to save his brother Ace. When Luffy causes a jailbreak on his way out, half of the prisoners escaped and Magellan was likewise beaten by the Blackbeard Pirates. He nearly took his life for his failure, though Sengoku, Marine Fleet Admiral at the time, stopped him. A cover story later showed that he was demoted to Vice-Warden presumably for said breakout. But hey, not too bad of a rank down and the one who took his position, the former vice-warden Hannaybal, was someone who Magellan had planned to give the job to in the future anyway.

    Literature 

-   _Artemis Fowl_:
    -   In the first novel, Briar Cudgeon is demoted and made to work as a recycler after sending a troll to kill Artemis and endangering Holly's life.
    -   In _The Opal Deception_, after her plan to start an interspecies war between humans and faeries is stopped, Opal Koboi flees in an escape pod which crashes into a farm. She has just enough magic left to mesmer the farmer into believing that she's her daughter, but not enough to get out of doing chores, which results in several unpleasant weeks spent digging potatoes and feeding pigs until LEPRetrieval track her down and arrest her, by which time she's almost glad to see them.

-   _The Caves of Steel_: In the underground city of New York, every person has a classification that determines their socioeconomic status. The higher your rating, the better your food, lodging, privileges etc. In the Back Story, Lije Bailey's father was a nuclear physicist with a very high rating. He was blamed for a deadly accident at a nuclear power plant and was declassified, so he and his family were forced to live in barracks and eat yeast mush.
-   _Dinotopia_: The third book, _Journey to Chandara_, ends with Lee Crabb being sentenced to work at a monastery of _Acrocanthosaurus_ monks. He is terrified he's going to be dinner, but Emperor Khan clarifies he's going to be making dinner... as long as he doesn't irritate the monks too much.
-   _Lord of the Rings_: In _The Two Towers_ The Rohirrim put their Dunlending captives to work repairing the fortress of Helm's Deep after they lost the battle over it, which amazes them, as Saruman had told them that the Rohirrim would burn their captives alive. Having experienced war firsthand, Tolkien made sure to show his heroes treating POWs with decency.
-   _The Pillars of the Earth_: Waleran Bigod spends the entire novel scheming against the heroes in order to acquire as much power as possible.

-   _The Seventh Tower_: Chosen who misbehave are given "deluminants", marks of dishonor. A Chosen who receives seven deluminants is demoted to a lower caste, and one who gets demoted all the way off the bottom of the caste system becomes an Underfolk servant forever.
-   This is a popular outcome in Soviet children's literature, since labor was one of the chief concepts in Soviet culture and ideology, so such an ending allowed an elegant setup for a villain's Heel–Face Turn.
    -   _Adventures of Dunno_ has a downplayed example, where Niggardfield becomes a simple worker at the spaghetti factory that used to belong to him, but he enjoys it very much because he really is good with spaghetti production.

In a variant, they hide her identity from the rest of their organization, which would probably execute her on the spot if they learned.
    -   In the Aes Sedai Magical Society, the ultimate punishment for a leader who betrays the organization is to be De-Powered and put to menial labour. The reasoning is that an exile or martyr might become an Icon of Rebellion, but the person scrubbing the hallways and changing the bedsheets never would.
    -   Downplayed with the code of the Aiel Proud Warrior Race: warriors who have been defeated or incurred some other debt of honour may be made _gai'shain_, serving their captors peacefully for A Year and a Day. Afterwards, the debt is erased, and it's extraordinarily rude to speak of it further.
-   In _World War Z_, the narrator discovers Grover Carlson, the White House Chief of Staff for the last pre-war administration, collecting dung for a bioconversion plant in Amarillo, Texas. Although not _quite_ a villain, he is a cynical and unrepentant representative of a government that regarded protecting private property and its own re-election prospects as more important than taking a potential global catastrophe seriously. While this is fairly understandable — every government has to prioritise — they also pushed a vaccine they knew was ineffective and continued to ignore the threat even when the evidence became overwhelming. Carlson also appears to be something of an anti-semite.
