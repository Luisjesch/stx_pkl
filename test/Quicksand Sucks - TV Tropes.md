_"What is it that's not exactly water, and it ain't exactly earth?"_

Quicksand is a common and deadly element of swamp, jungle, and desert terrain. Science Fiction stories written before the Moon landings are also liable to describe thick layers of extremely fine lunar dust on the Moon's surface that are treated as functionally equivalent to quicksand. In all cases, its most dangerous feature is its ability to suck people and animals down and drown them in a malevolent blend of sand and water. Although most victims blunder blindly into quicksand, it sometimes seems that the merest touch of an extremity is enough to pull the unwary into its muddy and all-consuming depths like iron filings to a magnet.

Originally a movie serial and B-film device, this trope has been carried over to television by way of programs that mimicked or paid homage to those films, or to pulp fiction in general. Then it also moved to Video Games. This trope is a Discredited Trope nowadays, although the Shifting Sand Land of video games is still allowed to play it straight, as a gameplay challenge if nothing else. In particularly challenging versions, enemies will come out and attempt to drag the player to the depths, making them somewhat similar to Instakill Mooks if sinking in quicksand is an instant-death condition (and it often is). In movies, it is often used to set up a Chekhov's Gun scenario in which the hero stumbles into it and escapes early on, in order to set up for a villain to die that way later in the film.

In truth, quicksand, while real, isn't terribly common; exerts none of its movie counterpart's mythical "sucking" power; and isn't nearly the Sticky Situation the movies made it look like. In fact, real quicksand is so dense that you _can't_ sink in it (with more than half your body). The usual advice for someone who finds themselves caught in deep quicksand is to simply relax and float on their back. Struggling in a panic may actually cause you to drag yourself down instead of up, and survival guides stress the importance of staying still if this starts to happen. While animals and people _do_ sometimes die in quicksand, it's almost never from drowning — it's from exposure, dehydration or predation after exhausting themselves struggling to get out. However, with the right combination/consistency of sand, clay, water, and salt, it is nearly impossible to escape quicksand without help.

See also Sand Is Water, Mucking in the Mud, Swamps Are Evil, and Bubblegloop Swamp. Also compare Unrealistic Black Hole, because both black holes and quicksand are portrayed in media as pulling in anything nearby, whereas in reality both only consume things which have gotten too close in the first place.

This trope is Older Than Feudalism, with descriptions of it existing in fiction, as well as historical accounts for centuries, as the Real Life section demonstrates.

As they're wading in for clues, the kids run into a patch of quicksand that formed in the riverbed recently. Fortunately, Dink remembered to lean back into the water and not struggle in order to not sink in any further and has Josh do the same thing. Even more fortunately, Ruth Rose wasn't far enough into the river at that point to also get stuck in the quicksand, so she was able to get out of the river and run to the nearby fire department to get help. The incident also ends up solving the case because Josh felt a jeep antenna poking at his leg before he was rescued. Once the fire department fishes the jeep out of the quicksand and find the fundraising money stored inside, and the police department runs its registration, the culprit is found and arrested. Officer Fallon speculates that the reason why the culprit didn't get stuck in the quicksand when he ended up accidentally driving the jeep into the river is that he either jumped out of the jeep to the solid riverbed when it got stuck or he just swam from the jeep to the edge and never touched the bottom in the process.

-   _The Vor Game_: During a stint of being Reassigned to Antarctica, Miles Vorkosigan runs across a nasty arctic "Permofrost Inversion Zone"; this appears to be solid ground, but has the potentially lethal property of unexpectedly thawing into a gooey sea of mud.

-   _Wings of Fire_: The RainWings use quicksand as a makeshift prison for Mastermind (they don't have a real prison since they've always punished criminals with exile). They have to pull him out of the quicksand every few hours so he doesn't just die.
-   _Warrior Cats_: _The Fourth Apprentice_ and _Mothwing's Secret_ both take place during droughts and involve cats trying to cross land that would normally be covered by water. While neither results in a death, both are life-threatening events and require the help of others to escape.

The Dynamic Duo escape by using the experimental "heel and toe Bat Rockets" in their boots.
-   In _Bill Nye the Science Guy_, Bill gets stuck in a tidal flat. He takes the opportunity to explain that you won't be buried alive in the sand, or mud in this case: you're more likely to drown or get stranded, especially if no one knows where you are. The trouble is if you're in a place where a high tide comes in; some rescue workers pulled him out safely before it can get that far.

-   _The Coroner_: In "The Drop Zone", Beth gets stuck in quicksand on a secluded beach, but is not actively being sucked down.

-   In _Get Smart_, Max, 99 and the Chief get captured on an artificial island created by KAOS. To kill them, Siegfried forces them on a patch of synthetic sand, which is specifically designed to be a quicksand Death Trap. They escape with the series' usual silliness: they use a small powerful magnet they have on their person to try to interact with a giant horseshoe magnet used to capture shipping so as to use their mutual attraction to pull them out. Unfortunately, their magnet somehow proves more powerful than the giant one and all they accomplish is to force the giant magnet to reorient itself to them without pulling them out. However, this ridiculous situation saves them since the giant magnet pulls a submerged submarine to the island to the point of plowing through the ground and into the synthetic sand pit, thus allowing our heroes to grab on the periscope and ride the sub to solid ground.
-   One episode of _Gilligan's Island_ had Skipper stumble into a pit of quicksand. While Gilligan is preparing a rope to throw him, a vine conveniently dislodges from a treebranch and lands right next to him. He uses it to climb out, and taps Gilligan on the shoulder. Gilligan replies, "Do you mind, I'm trying to save my..." And notices it's Skipper.

-   In _Sea Patrol_ 2Dads sinks into a pit, briefly going under before he's fished out by a team member. It's described as 'swamp', not quicksand, but it works the same way and when he falls in he's immediately buried up to his chest.
-   In an episode of _SeaQuest DSV_, a French leisure submarine was lost and the SeaQuest was sent to investigate. Their findings? Small underwater caverns were filled with fresh water, and they caved in like undersea potholes. Rather than aerated water causing the issue, the freshwater mixed with the sea water and desalinated it through dilution. This made the vessels too heavy to remain buoyant in the brackish zone, and they fell to the bottom of the freshwater pockets, unable to escape as their oxygen dwindled.
-   In one episode of _Small Wonder_, Ted walks into quicksand on a camping trip, and Vicki can't save him due to being ordered not to use her powers for the rest of the trip. It then turns out that the quicksand is only three feet deep.
-   _Tales from the Crypt_: In "'Til Death", Logan loses one of his workers (and his hat) to the quicksand that covers most of the land he just acquired.

A group of hoodlums murder an old man who lives in the eponymous swamp by beating him up and throwing him in a pond. When they turn around, they sink into a quicksand with the laughter of the old man's ghost ringing in their ears. The legend is that on certain nights, you can hear the hoodlums screaming and the old man laughing at them.
-   _Waist Deep in the Big Muddy_ is about sinking in quicksand. Specifically, the singer's experience in 'Nam where the sergeant marched the squad into a swamp and was guzzled up by it, and the Captain ordered an immediate about-face. It turns into political commentary, likening the state of things to a "great fool saying 'Push on! push on!"' while the squad (country) is neck-deep in stupid.

    Video Games 

-   A staple of _Adventure Island_ series are desert levels where Master Higgins can sink into quicksand patches and lose a life. Then again, Higgins is a real fidget who can't stand still without stomping with his legs. _Adventure Island III_ introduces a rideable triceratops who can stand on quicksand without sinking. In _Adventure Island IV_, quicksand is no longer lethal; sinking in it at worst drops Higgins into a hallway leading back to the start of a patch.

-   In the _Armello_ quest "Sinking Caravan", a merchant is late and he was last seen entering a swamp. When you get there, his wagon is stuck in a quicksand and you have the choice to either try to get it unstuck (body test) or to tell him to leave it.
-   _B3313_:
    -   The game takes the quicksand physics from _Super Mario 64_ and uses them at unexpected points to fit with the overall surreal vibe of the game:
    -   The pit in front of the Delicious Cake room has a blood splatter that acts as insta-killing quicksand. The cake itself turns out to be a sinking lie once you figure out how to climb it.
    -   The dark room with spotlights will sink Mario if he steps outside the highlighted spots.
-   In _Banjo-Tooie_, there is quicksand in Mayahem Temple and Terrydactyland, but it doesn't pull you down, the Dragundas living in it do, then spit you back onto solid ground. The wading boots are used to cross the quicksand. The Dragundas are also in Grunty Industries' toxic waste and polluted water.

-   _Clonk_: One of the Trick Arrow types added by the fans turns the ground where it hits into sinking quicksand.

-   _Castle of Illusion_: The Toy Time stage features jelly that can suck Mickey in, though there are some sections where he actually needs to pass all the way through the jellied floors to progress.
-   _Castlevania: Lords of Shadow_ has the Dead Bog stage, which will promptly pull Gabriel down if he fails to get out of there within an alloted amount of time.

-   _Conker's Bad Fur Day_: Traditional quicksand isn't present in the game, because sand as a whole is very rarely present in the game; however, the creek of poo in the Great Mighty Poo's lair has a similar effect: if Conker falls in, he sinks and drowns. The whole creek does allow the aforementioned boss to move around the place easily, allowing him to attack Conker from different positions.
-   _The Curse of Monkey Island_: One puzzle on Plunder Island has Guybrush escaping the belly of a snake, only to get stuck in a pool of quicksand that sucks most of the cool stuff he found in the snake's stomach (i.e. everything he doesn't need to solve further puzzles) out of his pants ("Now _there's_ an odd sensation"). Fortunately, Guybrush only gets sucked in up to his waist, but he still needs to find a way to grab onto a nearby conveniently-placed vine in order to get out and progress.
-   _Day Dreamin' Davey_: There are floors in Hades' Underworld lair (Ancient Greece) and the Medieval Swamp (Medieval Times) that can make you sink down like quicksand and swallow you up if you stay on the floor for too long.
-   _Death In The Caribbean_: One screen is a patch of quicksand within a foggy swamp, which you'll sink into and die if you don't have a length of rope to throw around a tree to help pull yourself back to safety. A hat on said screen implies that an explorer who came before you fell victim to it.
-   In _Donkey Kong 64_, there's quicksand in Angry Aztec that will damage you steadily the longer you stay in it and also slow you down, but you don't sink in it.
-   _Environmental Station Alpha_: There are sections of sand that sink the player in, often revealing rooms underneath.
-   _Fight Knight_: In the sand area, all the upper floor "out of bounds" sand tiles cause you to sink to the lower floor, but the rest of the sand only sinks when you step on specific tiles within two tiles away from the stone faces, which immediately Turn Red and cause you to sink. Being constantly aware of where you can step and where you can't is a vital part of solving what is effectively one big navigation puzzle, and later you need to figure out which tiles to step on to deliberately sink yourself to reach certain blocked-off lower floor areas you can't reach otherwise.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   _Final Fantasy VII_. It doesn't pose a direct hazard to your player characters, but Corel Prison is described as "a natural prison in the middle of the desert... surrounded entirely by quicksand."
    -   _Final Fantasy IX_ has sand whirlpools on the path leading up to Cleyra. If you end up in one, you whirl towards the centre, sinking in. Mashing X repeatedly allows you to jump out, failing to do so will land you in a fight with a sand scorpion. The scorpions are presumably causing the whirlpools in order to trap prey.

-   _Kirby_ series:
    -   _Kirby Mass Attack_: Quicksand appears most frequently in Sandy Canyon, the second world. Kirby will slowly sink when standing on it, and he'll swim in it when commanded to.
    -   _Kirby's Epic Yarn_: _Pyramid Sands_ features a lot of quicksand. The yarn graphics give it a unique approach: the sand is in fact horizontal strands of yellow and orange yarn, and each strand is pulled away rythmically, leaving Kirby fall onto the strand below the previous one, effectively pulling Kirby lower and lower.
-   _Thelast.io_: There are quicksand pools in the desert area, but they simply mire down the player and make it difficult for them to get out. They won't actually kill them on their own, but being a sitting duck for the other players is often dangerous enough regardless.
-   _The Legend of Zelda_:
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening_: You fight a Lanmola in a pit of quicksand. You only get sucked downward (to a cave you must traverse to get back to the surface) if you get put in the center of the pit; the rest of the quicksand simply pulls you toward that center.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_: The Haunted Wasteland has a river of no-escape quicksand that you cross by either using the Longshot or the Hover Boots. Once across, you are still in danger of sinking if you stray off the path.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_: The Arbiter's Grounds has quicksand, including the instant-death type, as a frequent and dangerous obstacle. While some areas can be crossed while sinking slowly, wearing the metal boots is instant death.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass_: Zigzagged. There's only regular sand in both the desert-themed Isle of Gust and its dungeon the sandy Temple of Wind (the actual threat is the wind currents and geysers, sand is harmless otherwise); but in the Goron Temple, **all** sand can suck anyone within and is deadly for Link (luckily, his Bombchus can navigate through them just fine).
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks_: The Sand Realm has quicksand pits in the Sand Temple and parts of the nearby Tower of Spirits. The Sand Wand can create sand bridges by solidifying part of the quicksand's terrain so Link (as well as Phantom Zelda in the Tower of Spirits) can walk over them safely.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword_: Link can keep from getting sucked into the quicksand of Lanayru Desert if he sprints across it. Also, the Timeshift Stones can change it back into the solid, grass-covered ground it once was Before the Dark Times.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds_: There are quicksand pits in the final room of the Desert Palace and the battlefield of Zaganaga in Lorule's Misery Mire. The Sand Wand makes a return since its debut in _Spirit Tracks_ (now under the name of Sand Rod) to allow Link to cross over them safely with the created solid sand tiles.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_: There are bottomless bogs, patches of sucking mud encountered throughout Hyrule. Link will sink steadily the moment he enters them; he can cross them safely if he hurries, but staying in one for more than a few seconds will see him sucked down below the surface. Notably, objects that normally float when dropped in water, such as wooden weapons and monsters parts, will also sink instantly in this substance; however, amphibious enemies such as lizalfos and water octoroks can swim and float in it just fine.
    -   _The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom_: In addition to bringing back the brown mud bogs, the game also features stereotypical desert quicksand in the Gerudo region, which has begun to appear due to the altered geography. It can be distinguished from regular sand because it's moving forward (thus also doubling as Sand Is Water). Various objects float in it, however, so they can be used as safe transportation platforms (there's even a Shrine where Link can build and use a sandboard-styled vehicle to navigate across the present river of quicksand).
-   _The Lost Vikings_: In the Egypt levels, you have to get across by having coconuts drop into the quicksand and landing on the coconuts.
-   _Lucy Got Problems_: Lucy wanders into a mangrove swamp and ends up sinking in it, largely to titilate the sinking fetish. It uses the "Why am I getting shorter?" version as well. She manages to use the mangrove trees roots to pull herself out too.
-   _Max Blaster and Doris de Lightning Against the Parrot Creatures of Venus_: At one point, Max ends up in a quicksand pit, and you need to figure out how to get him out of it.
-   _Mega Man_:
    -   _Mega Man 4_ and _Mega Man 10_: Pharaoh Man's and Commando Man's levels have Mega Man rushing through quicksand pits. Although he can move and shoot normally in them, even completely buried, he needs to jump to exit it, and if he's dragged to the bottom of the screen, he dies as if he had fallen in a bottomless pit.
    -   _Mega Man X: Command Mission_: One character falls into a quicksand trap, which pulls him and his two friends down into it. Which wouldn't make sense in the first place, but made even worse by the fact that all three are _super-strong reploids_ that could have easily pulled themselves out (especially since one was still on firm ground). They even treat it like it's deadly, despite the fact they don't even need to breathe and would, at worst, just be stuck.
    -   _Mega Man: Revenge of the Fallen_: Zig-zagged. In Pharaoh Man's stage, when you reach the bottom of the screen in quicksand, you'll usually die instantly. However there are two instances where sinking in quicksand can be beneficial, even opening up a new alternate route!

-   _Metal Gear_:
    -   _Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty_: There is a pool of quicksand whose dangers are carefully described by Vamp. Seconds later, the boss starts swimming through it with ease (it's justified in-universe because he has superpowers). This has been implicated in the loss of ships at sea, because of a subsidence or other event on the seabed which causes a dramatic release of gas.
    -   _Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater_ features bottomless swamps full of muck early in the game that behave like quicksand. Once you go under, you suffocate and die. It makes for a great way to dispose of enemy bodies, though.
-   _Minecraft_ has patches of powder snow found in mountainous areas. Any player (and other non-adapted mobs) who doesn't tell powder snow apart from normal blocks of snow or snow-covered dirt risks sinking into it, and while one cannot suffocate in it, one can quickly get frostbite injuries. Getting out of it is made harder by powder snow reducing the players' jump height to less than a full block, but players can easily "mine" that snow to get rid of it. Or put on leather shoes and walk on powder snow like on any other blocks.
-   _Mutant Football League_: University of Chimera Stadium, the arid desert home field of the Cardinal Sins, has pools of quicksand as field hazards, the local spin on a concept present in most arenas: pits that take you out of the game with an injury for a short while if you fail to avoid them.
-   _Ori and the Will of the Wisps_: The Silent Woods have pools of a tar-like muck that instantly sucks down and kills Ori if they so much as touch it.
-   _Phantasy Star IV_: Motavia features quicksand areas that block your party from progressing until a certain point in the plot.
-   _Pokémon_: The seventh generation of the games, starting with _Pokémon Sun and Moon_, adds the sand castle-like Pokémon Palossand, who absorbs the life of the prey it catches. In one illustration<small>◊</small>, it is seen swallowing a Pikachu in a very similar way to a quicksand.
-   _Prince of Persia 2_: An early puzzle requires you to jump between a set of stone platforms in a displayed but randomly-selected order. Quicksand comes in because the platforms are suspended in it, and if you miss a jump, or jump onto a platform not in the sequence, you're sucked in.
-   _Ragnarok (Roguelike)_: Quicksand is especially dangerous, as it's impossible to free yourself without a grappling hook, or by using magical means. Otherwise, you'll eventually get pulled downwards and drown.
-   _Ratchet & Clank_ has the planet Aridia, a desert planet with massive LAKES of quicksand. You can hop out, but only three times before you sink, for whatever reason.
-   _Realm of the Mad God_: Quicksand appears all over in the Tomb of the Ancients. It doesn't kill directly, but the slowing effect can be very dangerous regardless.
-   _Robinson's Requiem_: The moment you walk onto patches of dark wavy sand, you'll freeze in place and sink into it \[while Trepliev1 sobs\] like there's a black hole under it. There's absolutely no escape.
-   In _Runaway 2: The Dream of the Turtle_, the main character Brian encounters a quicksand pit, and when he sees the goggles of his pilot Otto in the pit, he worries that Otto was lost in it.
-   _Secret of Evermore_ has patches of quicksand fade in and out of existence in one of the areas. Stumbling into one sends you back to the start of the area.
-   _Shade: Wrath of Angels_: The Shadowland swamp have quicksands, which will start swallowing you if you remain idle on the spot for too long. You can escape by jumping however.
-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_:
    -   _Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)_: Wherever sand appears, expect it to be quicksand. If you fall in, you fall straight through like there's nothing there. It's essentially another Bottomless Pit in disguise, much like water in the same game.
    -   _Sonic 3 & Knuckles_: In Sandopolis Zone (and the 2-player mode Desert Palace level), quicksand will slowly pull the character under but it can be escaped by jumping properly. Marble Garden Zone also features surfaces that act the same way, but look like black water.
    -   _Sonic Adventure 2_: In Tails' Hidden Base and Eggman's Sand Ocean levels, quicksand is usually no problem, but since they're piloting walking mechs, it functions like a Bottomless Pit, meaning they lose a life if they fall in. In Sonic's boss fight with the Egg Golem, he can easily jump out of the sand if the player spams the jump button. Interestingly, in Hidden Base, there's a specific shifting platform that raises and lowers just enough for the player to start sinking in quicksand only to seemingly be pushed back out to safety. However, Tails will still die in mid-air as the programmers likely never expected a player to escape the quicksand in a mech stage.
-   _Spyro: A Hero's Tail_ has Crocovile Swamp and Coastal Remains, both of which have quicksand that will instantly cause Spyro to sink and die if he touches it.

-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   _Super Mario Bros. 2_: Quicksand is frequent in desert levels, and come into two types; the first takes about 7-10 seconds to completely suck you in and is quite easy to jump out of, the second (sand _waterfalls_) takes half as long as the first and renders attempting to jump out a hopeless endeavor, though fortunately the first type is typically near it. There's even a shortcut late in 6-3 that involves going in almost to your cranium.
    -   _Super Mario Bros. 3_ features quicksand with green Piranha Plants underneath, with these enemies popping out only when they're going to shoot fireballs at Mario or Luigi. A secret area beneath a pool of quicksand can be accessed in 8-2.
    -   _Super Mario 64_ has quicksand in the Shifting Sand Land level with three intensities. First, there is light quicksand where you slowly and steadily sink in; you can eventually free yourself by jumping. (This quicksand was used for the most realistic pit, just outside the pyramid, where you go in only halfway, and also for a deadlier pit inside the pyramid, a quicksand bin above the pit, a thorn patch in Tall Tall Mountain, and the domain of the giant Venus Fire Traps in Tiny-Huge Island, the latter two being so shallow that all they do is impede your jumping.) Second one is a middle type that sucks Mario in quickly but not instantly; it's the most common type. Last is dark quicksand that instantly sucks you in, thus counting as a bottomless pit.
    -   In _New Super Mario Bros._ and its sequels, quicksand returns and again appears in desert levels, with some of them leading to secret areas instead of bottomless pits.
    -   _Super Mario Galaxy_ and _Super Mario Galaxy 2_ has sands behave in different ways due to the game's bending gravity mechanic, though classic quicksand (which instantly sinks Mario to his death) is still present — it can be distinguised by having a darker orange color.
    -   _Super Mario 3D World_: The presence of quicksand is very limited, being only present in the level Conkdor Canyon. The rate at which it sinks the characters is low enough for them to not only force their way out, but also reach an upper area by "swimming" across a waterfall made of falling sand.
    -   _Super Mario Odyssey_: A single pool of quicksand appears in Tostarena Ruins within Sand Kingdom. The nearby sinkhole isn't lethal; in fact, entering it is necessary to get a Power Moon.
    -   _Mario Kart_: Some of the desert tracks in the series have quicksand in them, namely Yoshi Desert in _Super Circuit_, Dry Dry Desert in _Double Dash!!_, and Bone-Dry Ruins in _8_. Funnily enough, in the former two tracks the unlucky drivers don't end up _completely_ sinking, as they're instead eaten by a large Piranha Plant lurking beneath.
    -   _Mario Party_: Quicksand is a rare feature in the series, despite the abundance of desert-based minigames, but it still exists:
        -   _Mario Party 2_: The minigame Quicksand Cache revolves around three characters grabbing coins in a large bowl where sand is converging downward to the center (where the fourth player, wearing the Bowser Suit, awaits while manipulating the quicksand's motion at will to grab the remaining coins).
        -   In the boards Spiny Desert (_Mario Party 3_) and Pyramid Park (_Mario Party 7_), there are two quicksand pits connected from the underground and surrounded by Event Spaces. If a player lands into one of those spaces, the quicksand pit will transport them to the other (and, in _7_, vice versa to anyone located in the opposite pit).
    -   _Paper Mario_:
        -   _Super Paper Mario_ has some quicksand in Yold Desert and Yold Ruins. They fill the pits in these areas and if Mario (or other protagonists) sinks through it, he will lose 1 HP.
        -   In _Paper Mario: Sticker Star_ and _Paper Mario: Color Splash_, quicksand appears in Drybake Desert and Mustard Cafe respectively, both desert-themed areas. Besides serving as environmental hazards that will instantly KO Mario if he sinks under it, they also appear _in_ battles, causing Mario, as well as most grounded enemies beside Pokeys to sink when standing on it. In battles involving quicksand, if Mario spends too much time choosing stickers or cards, he will drown in quicksand and lose all HP and receive a Game Over.

-   _Super Metroid_: The many quicksand pools present no danger at all, because Samus wears a sealed space suit and can't drown (it will not, however, prevent damage from spikes that may happen to be placed at the bottom of a pit of quicksand). If you don't feel like jumping out, you can sink all the way in and walk around on the bottom. In a few places this allows access to new areas. These quicksand pools are found exclusively in the aquatic area, Maridia, meaning that these quicksand pools are all underwater.
-   _Super Spy Hunter_: The second level features an open desert section with flowing quicksand pits scattered about. They damage you if you touch the center of them.
-   _Sweet Home (1989)_: Several sand traps are found in the dungeons below the mansion. Anyone who falls in can be rescued with a rope, but pulling off a successful rescue takes timing. Naturally, the Infinity +1 Sword is found at the bottom of one of these pits.
-   _Sydney Hunter and the Sacred Tribe_ has quite a few patches of quicksand around that will slowly pull Sydney down should he step on them. Sydney can repeatedly jump to get out of them.
-   _ToeJam & Earl_: Quicksand makes the protagonists start sinking and move slower. The sand also resembles a desert, complete with cacti.
-   _Tomb Raider III_ has quicksand in several levels. Depending on where you stand, Lara will either sink only up to her waist or be submerged completely, but can still wade through the stuff in either case. If Lara is fully under, she'll quickly start to drown and then die unless you are fast enough to get her to higher ground. One level in particular has you jumping from safe spot to safe spot in a massive pool of quicksand since said safe spots are solid enough to stand on and one misstep will have you killed unless you are fast enough to climb up to the safe spot.
-   _Toontown Online_ also features highly dangerous areas of quicksand.
-   _Turok 2_: The Death Marshes have insta-death quicksand.
-   _Wacky Races (1991)_: In the Licensed Game for the NES, quicksand is present throughout the Desert world. The battle against Sergeant Blast and Private Meekly in the Army Surplus Special at the end of the world takes place entirely over a stretch of quicksand. Strangely, while Muttley is able to sink in the quicksand, the Army Surplus Special can't.
-   _Weird Dreams_: There's a quicksand pit in front of the statue that will take you back to the Hall of Mirrors.

-   _ZanZarah: The Hidden Portal_: In the swamp, taking more than a step or two into the water will cause Amy to sink in and drown.

    Web Animation 

-   In _Dora No More_, Dora sinks in quicksand quickly due to being pushed in by Boots.
-   _FreedomToons_: Seamus criticizes the way government measures unemployment (anyone who has given up on looking for work is not considered "unemployed") by depicting a census taker observing several people drowning in quicksand, then declaring the problem solved when their head goes under.

-   _Ninjai: The Little Ninja_ has the Big Bad leave people to sink in a "swamp" which, despite being explicitly referred to as quicksand, seems to be a very sticky, viscous fluid.

    Web Original 

-   Creepypasta:
    -   _Bog of Whispers_ is about a Genius Loci evil swamp that shares visions of all the final moments of the creatures that died there, including, you guessed it, some poor deer sinking to its death. The protagonist also gets mired in an area of deep mud with grass growing in it.
    -   In _In the Bayou_, we hear a ghost, who manifests as a decaying body in a tree, shrieking in terror. The sole survivor of a witch's curse states that the woman whose ghost it is drowned trying to climb the tree she appears in.

    Web Videos 

-   Several websites specialize in fetish videos involving women either stumbling or being forced into quicksand or mud and struggling (and failing) to get out, or sensually playing in and letting themselves sink into the murk. Since a lot of the "quicksand pits" are artificial mudholes a fair bit of disbelief suspension is required, though natural muddy areas and silty riverbanks are used a bit as well (the models still have to force themselves deeper to give the illusion of being sucked down).
-   Roy and Valerie get stuck in a pit of quicksand while traveling across the Second Dimension in _Journey of the Cartoon Man_.

    Western Animation 

-   _The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius_: In the episode "Sheen's Brain", Sheen traps Jimmy and Carl in quicksand. Jimmy's entire lower half sinks within seconds, but Carl's high body fat causes him to sink less quickly, giving him time to shrink a light post for him and Jimmy to grab on to and escape.
-   Mozenrath's Black Sand in Disney's _Aladdin: The Series_. The heroes didn't even have to step in it, it _reached out_ to suck them in, an act that was, in one episode, disturbingly referred to as _eating_. Of course, it's _not_ normal quicksand, since A Wizard Did It.
-   Catwoman leaves Batman and Robin in a quicksand Death Trap in the Filmation series episode "The Nine Lives of Batman".
-   _Darkwing Duck_:
    -   In the episode "Can't Bayou Love", Jambalaya Jake lures Darkwing into wet cement mixed with _actual_ quicksand as a trap. Darkwing escapes by firing a rocket from his gun to push himself out and into the air.
    -   In "Water Way To Go", Darkwing and Launchpad think they've fallen into quicksand. Instead, it turns out to be a hidden entrance to Steelbeak's lair.

-   _DuckTales (1987)_:
    -   In "Wrongway in Ronguay", Scrooge sinks into a quicksand pit in the middle of the desert. He escapes by swimming out using a box of scuba gear he had brought with him.
    -   In "Sweet Duck of Youth", Launchpad lands the helicopter in quicksand, and the gang has to lighten the load to get it free. Scrooge falls in and starts sinking due to being weighed down by his money belt, but he's able to get free by hooking his cane onto the helicopter as it takes off.
-   In _Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show_, Ed and Eddy at first appear to be sinking in quicksand, and appear to die as Edd attempts to save them. However, as Edd mourns their deaths, it turns out it was just a joke that Ed and Eddy played on him. Naturally, Edd gets pissed off at the two and immediately leaves them to return to the cul-de-sac, preferring to be punished by the kids for the scam that backfired and sent them on the run in to first place rather then continue on the journey with Ed and Eddy.
-   One episode of _The Fairly OddParents!_ has Jorgen turn the floor of a room into "quicksand" that is a black hole in all but name. Rather than sinking in it, the kids in the room get sucked into the centre at hyper fast speeds and then fall into it. Its appearance is also clearly modelled after a black hole (albeit probably an unrealistic one) as well.

-   Duke falls into a pit of quicksand while escaping from Cobra in an episode of _G.I. Joe_ and goes in over his head in a matter of seconds. Fortunately, this convinces his pursuers that he's a goner, allowing him to grab a nearby vine and pull himself free after they leave.
-   _Jellystone!_: Parodied on "Gorilla in Our Midst". While crossing over Grape Ape's body, Doggie Daddy gets trapped in "quickhair", which is "like quicksand, but hair."
-   Heloise throws a bunch of pandas into a quicksand pit on an episode of _Jimmy Two-Shoes_. They only approve of the mudbath.
-   Played for laughs in the _Johnny Bravo_ episode "Buffoon Lagoon"; Johnny is sent to search for food in the jungles on an island and he stumbles into quicksand, thinking it's pudding. Even as he's sinking, it still doesn't click with him that it's quicksand.
-   _Kaeloo_: One episode has Kaeloo, Stumpy, Quack Quack and Pretty try to find the ancient tomb of a pharaoh hidden in a desert. On their journey, Stumpy falls into a pit of quicksand and starts sinking. This being a show like _Kaeloo_, nobody cares. At least until he reminds them that he has their bag of supplies with him.
-   _Kissyfur_: In "The Birds And The Bears", gators Floyd and Jolene cross the line when they steal Gus's paddlecab and lure the poor papa bear into quicksand to drown and die while they use the paddlecab to catch some of the cubs for dinner. Fortunately, fate deals him a winning hand when Kissyfur, Beehonie, Toot, and Miss Emmy Lou manage to free him from the quicksand, giving him the chance to once again put the gators in their place and rescue the cubs and retrieve the stolen paddle cab.

-   _The Little Mermaid (1992)_ has _underwater_ quicksand, known in-universe as _slowsand_. During an episode, Ariel and a merman fall onto it and slowly begin to be absorbed, until Flounder grabs a reef branch to help them escape it (the merman is too heavy, so Ariel grabs his tail (and Flounder grabs hers) to finally rescue him.
-   In season two of _Max Steel_, Max and Berto walk in to quicksand and start sinking, having to use a vine to pull themselves out. In season three, Berto and Kat walk in to quicksand; however, Berto says that the human body is lighter and they manage to swim out of it.

-   In the first episode of _Rainbow Brite_ the villain disguises quick sand as water. Rainbow is suspicious of it however Starlite is covered in dirt and attempts to clean himself. He gets stuck in the quicksand, as does Rainbow Brite, and if it wasn't for Brian they would have died.
-   A _Robot Chicken_ sketch has a giraffe step into quicksand and, because its tall body takes so long to go down, goes through the five stages of grief as it sinks. The giraffe's life is saved when its feet hit bottom, although it's still stuck.
-   In an episode of _Rugrats (1991)_, the babies didn't know the proper term for it, but Chuckie described it as "some kind of sand that I'm sinking into really quick".
-   In _She-Ra and the Princesses of Power (2018)_ the Crimson Waste are filled with quicksand pits. Right after being warned about how dangerous the place is, Glimmer walks right into one of these. Adora dives right in to save her, forgetting about Glimmer's Flashy Teleportation power, who has no problem getting out herself. Only to port back to get Adora back.
-   Averted in the _Skatoony_ episode "Hoo Loves You Baby". When Chudd, Earl, and the Quizblock end up in a pool of quicksand, not only do they sink slowly enough that they can complete a full round of quizzing while doing it, but it's shallow enough that their heads never go above water. It turns out they were in the shallow end of a quicksand swimming pool.
-   In _The Smurfs (1981)_ episode "Handy's Sweetheart", the mean Custodian of the pools of Avalon makes the waters turn into quicksand to trap the three Smurfs who were trying to take his lilyroot without paying him gold in return.

-   _Taz-Mania_: In "A Devil of a Job", Bushwhacker Bob and Mr. Thickley are looking for a Tasmanian Devil to use as an attraction for their hotel. At one point in their search, they wander into a pit of quicksand, and Bob is quick to blame Thickley for leading them there. Thickley has to remind Bob not to move, as the more he moves, the faster he'll sink. Eventually, the both of them sink completely, but are rescued by a van driven by Bugs Bunny. Daffy Duck is his passenger, and tells him "I told you it was a left turn at Albuquerque!"
-   _Total Drama_:
    -   As if Boney Island isn't dangerous enough as it is, Chris sets up quicksand pits in "Up the Creek". Trent walks ahead of the other Screaming Gophers and steps into one. Lindsay tries to save him, but only ends up stuck and sinking too. Cody sees an opportunity to be a hero and swings with a vine above the pit with the intent to grab Trent's hand, but he misses and slams into a tree. The vine, however, swings back and Trent and Lindsay grab it to pull themselves out. They still give Cody full credit for their survival.
    -   While they have their eyes and thoughts focused on tracking down Ezekiel in "African Lying Safari", Duncan and Alejandro fail to realize timely that they've come to a standstill in quicksand. Duncan is taken aback because he expected to meet death in the mud or the gutter, but not in quicksand. Alejandro, being a little closer to the edge, gets his hands on a stick and just as fortunately, Ezekiel drops by. With a little prompting, Alejandro gets Ezekiel to bite the stick and drag the two of them out. Later that day, Duncan gets eliminated and booted off the plane. He lands in another pit of quicksand, right next to a lion that proceeds to maul him.

    **Sylvia:** "Oh Yeah."  
    **Both:** "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!"
    

    Real Life 

-   Water with a great deal of gas bubbling through it behaves suitably, in that a human would sink like a rock in it, and subsequently drown. This isn't encountered very often, however. An example in real life which has taken many lives is Niagara Falls. The massive amount of falling water has the same effect as the aerated water of _Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty_ and has resulted in many people drowning.

-   The effects of _The Princess Bride_'s "lightning sand" can be mimicked by forcing a burst of air through sand (a phenomenon that happens daily in the Fire Swamps, of course). An object placed on top sinks instantly to the bottom. Fortunately the events required to create this dry quicksand are highly unlikely to occur in nature.
-   Large heaps of loose sand can stop a vehicle. In the rare situations this is life or death (when a stranded car in the desert means a stranded driver for instance) and it can be fatal. And in any case, it probably isn't something you wish to explain to your insurance agent.
    
    Sometimes, getting stuck in the sand is the desired effect. Some steep roads have sand or piles of other things to give truckers a chance to stop relatively safely in case their brakes fail. Some airports seem to have something similar at the end of the runway in case the plane doesn't stop for some reason. Locomotives and trams may carry sand for traction help.
    
    That's why gravel traps are so common at racing circuits. No matter if a car that goes screaming off the tarmac is doing it forwards, backwards or sideways, loose sand and gravel stop it up since the vehicle digs into the gravel, pulling itself in and creating resistance. However, since this also tends to ruin the underbody and wheels of a car, another option that's become popular in recent years is to create a large tarmac runoff area so a driver can recover from a loss of control or error in judgment and quickly rejoin the race. On cars with slicks, especially light ones such as Formula One cars, they're so grippy that gravel traps actually cause _more_ slippage in comparison.
    

-   Non-Newtonian fluids are so viscous that if a great deal of force is applied to them, they behave like solids or liquids, but if the same force is applied slower and gentler (shear thickening) or faster and more abrupt (shear thinning) the opposite is true. It can be very difficult to get something out from being trapped in a pool of a non-Newtonian fluid. These same properties also explain such phenomena as being able to walk on the surface of a pool filled with custard, hitting the ketchup bottle to be able to pour out what's inside and being able to hit corn starch with a hammer.
-   This video shows off most of the mechanics behind quicksand and other shear thinning non-Newtonian fluids in action, courtesy of a silt mudflat on the banks of a river. While at first, it's possible to walk on and even jump around on the surface of the mudflat, once a stick is jammed into the ground (which takes some effort), the supersaturated silt and water mix takes on its shear thinning properties, and the ground around the demonstrator and the stick becomes increasingly 'spongy' and elastic, creating the weird imagery where it seems possible to jump off the surface of the quicksand as if it were a trampoline, though standing on it for too long results in the demonstrator's feet sinking into the ground slightly.
-   Soil liquefaction, a rare phenomenon associated with earthquakes, can cause water-saturated sandy ground to temporarily turn so slippery and unstable that it becomes too weak to support buildings' foundations. This can also lead to an interesting inverse in which objects underground may float upward, as seen in several earthquakes where manholes and pipes did just that, breaching pavements and roads damaged in the quake.<small>◊</small>
-   Mont Saint-Michel in France is a tidal island, and the ground exposed during low tide is known for its rampant patches of deep mud and quicksand. For this reason, tourists are advised to either stick to the causeway or travel with a qualified guide (who will know how to both avoid and escape quicksand), as the intensity and unpredictability of the tides creates the drowning hazard mentioned above.
-   Morecambe Bay is notorious for its quicksands and unpredictable tides, just imagine being trapped by quicksand as the tide rushes in to drown you! Many people have drowned in Morecambe Bay, from coaches pulled by horses in the 1700's to poor Chinese cocklers in the early 2000's. In fact, the area is so dangerous that there is a proper, appointed by the King, "Sand Pilot" to be used by travellers across Morecambe Bay to avoid quicksand and tidal drownings. The worst thing about the Morecambe Bay quicksands is that they _move about_ depending on the tides beforehand, meaning that the Sand Pilot has to be a good reader of the sand conditions in front off them.
-   Grain bins are a common artificial source of quicksand-style danger, where one false move can get a worker pulled down in a matter of seconds and suffocated under all the grain.
-   Slurry pits are big drums filled with water, decaying plant matter, manure and just about any other organic material you can think of that is suitable for consumption and decomposition by bacteria into fertiliser for use on the fields. Here, the main risk to one’s life isn’t just drowning (though that certainly happens, as these pits have a very large capacity, and the material inside isn’t nearly as solid), but from inhaling poisonous hydrogen sulfide gas, which is produced in large amounts by the bacteria at work breaking down all the organic material in the pit. It's heavier than air, so it accumulates inside the drum, forming a layer of gas above the material inside. According to this document by the United Kingdom's Health and Safety Executive, A mere 0.0047 parts per million is enough for 50% of humans to be able to smell it. 10-20 parts per million is the lower threshold for eye irritation. At 150 to 250 parts per million, the victim's olfactory nerve is paralysed within a few breaths, preventing them from smelling it at all, while the victim's awareness of the danger they're in often fades by this point. Concentrations of 320 to 530 ppm are enough to cause dangerous fluid build up in the lungs. A concentration of 800ppm kills 50% of humans exposed to it for 5 minutes, and once concentrations of the gas hit 1000 ppm, it can knock someone out with just a single inhalation. If the toxic gas doesn’t kill you by causing respiratory collapse, you’ll fall unconscious through inhalation of the gas or your own fatigue, then drown in the pit’s contents, in a particularly gross way to go.
-   After signing the Magna Carta, King John of England (Robin Hood's enemy) tried to renege on the deal by raising an army to fight against the rebellious barons; his plan was foiled when the packhorse carrying the Royal treasury (i.e all his gold) and the Crown Jewels fell into quicksand while crossing The Wash (a large bay on the English east coast) and sank immediately; realising they would now not get paid, all his knights deserted. The next King, Henry III, had to be "crowned" with a plain gold ring, as the country could not afford to replace the Crown.
-   Sam Steele (a Mountie circa 1894) recounts several instances where he ended up in quicksand. Part of his survival training involved being taught to swim out. He also recounts two instances where a horse sank in a bog. The second time, it had learned that panicking only made the situation worse.
