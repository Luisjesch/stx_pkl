Here boy!

_"When I capture the hero, I will make sure I also get his dog, monkey, ferret, or whatever sickeningly cute little animal capable of untying ropes and filching keys happens to follow him around."_

So, you're in Prison. Or, at least, a jail cell. Or an implausibly oversized birdcage. Your enemies have caught you and, having better things to do than murder you right away, have thrown you behind bars for safe keeping. Or maybe your allies have handcuffed you to a radiator to get you out of the way. But who's not locked up? That animal on the other side of the room... right next to the big ring of keys on the wall.

Now the task is to get the animal to bring the keys (or some other useful escape tool) over to you. If it's your Non-Human Sidekick, this could be as simple as a meaningful wink or special signal. But if it's a critter you're not necessarily on the best of terms with or don't know — or, heavens forbid, one belonging to the enemies who was given the keys for safe-keeping — well, you could be screwed.

A common variation is for the sidekick to have to steal then keys off The Jailer's person.

This often facilitates Cardboard Prison. Sister-trope to Conveniently Placed Sharp Thing and Hooking the Keys. Related to Within Arm's Reach, when an item is conveniently close to the protagonist during a fight scene. Compare Bring Help Back for when there aren't any keys around. See also Jail Bake and Passive Rescue for other ways of getting keys to prisoners, though this is more likely to occur on the spur of the moment than to be a part of a Great Escape. If the imprisoned character is a villain, this is a subtrope of Breaking Out the Boss. May involve a Cool Key or a Dangerous Key Fumble.

For other types of animal rescues, see Heroic Dog, Timmy in a Well, and Saint-Bernard Rescue.

    Films — Animation 

-   Played with in _Aladdin_. Al is shackled in a dungeon for "kidnapping" Princess Jasmine. His monkey Abu comes to pick open the shackle locks, but that doesn't free him from the dungeon — a disguised Jafar does, as part of his plan to get the magic lamp.
-   A variant occurs in _Brave_; after being locked in her room while her father goes out to hunt a bear that's actually his wife (long story), Merida sees her triplet brothers walk up to her door, now also transformed into bears. She simply tells them "Get the key" and they promptly go after the maid who has it.

Tulio promptly moves the goal posts by claiming that technically speaking, Altivo _didn't_ get them a pry bar.

-   A variant in _Hong Kong Godfather_: Wei, the protagonist is a kindhearted Animal Lover whose pets include two dogs, a large Doberman who's in a cage most of the time and a smaller pup. When Wei gets ambushed by a horde of thugs, he lets his smaller dog out of his mansion, where it instead releases the Doberman into helping Wei by mauling several mooks.
-   In _Herbie Goes Bananas_, Herbie (a sentient car who behaves much like an animal sidekick) retrieves the key to Paco's cell by bending his antenna enough to hook the keyring.
-   In _The Mask_, Stanley's dog Milo's ability to fetch his master's keys comes in handy when he has to climb the wall into jail and sneak the keys off the sleeping policeman to break Stanley out — though he at first misunderstands the command, going for the policeman's sandwich.
    
    **Stanley:** Not the _cheese_, the _**keys!**_
    
-   _Pirates of the Caribbean_:
    -   _Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl_: Adapting the scene from the ride, Captain Jack Sparrow mocks the other prisoners for trying to coax the mangy dog into bringing them the keys. A cannon ball opens up part of their cell, allowing them to escape. Once they leave, Sparrow starts whistling for the dog, too, but when the cursed pirates appear, the dog runs away with the keys, leaving him completely trapped.
    -   _Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest_: Another group of prisoners are whistling and hooting to call someone over... but in this case, they're cat-calling Elizabeth, sitting in the next cell after being wrongfully imprisoned. Later, when Governor Swann comes to get her out, he looks around and remarks "Now, where's that dog with the keys?" In a Brick Joke, we later see Pintel and Ragetti in a rowboat having escaped their cell, and then we see the dog (keys still in mouth) is in the boat with them.

    Literature 

-   A technological variation in the fifth _Artemis Fowl_ book. When Holly is imprisoned, her Mission Control remote-activates her _helmet_ in the other room to bounce over and break her out with its laser. She is considerably weirded out to find it bouncing up and down outside her cell like a little animal.
-   Defied by Fred Colon of the _Discworld_ book _Thud!_. He is described as being a particularly good jailor for, among other reasons, keeping the keys to his cells "in a tin box in the bottom drawer of his desk, a long way out of reach of any stick, hand, dog, cunningly thrown belt or trained Klatchian monkey spider." A footnote mentions this makes him possibly unique in the annals of jail history.
-   In _Emperor Mage_, part of _The Immortals_ series, Friend to All Living Things Daine is imprisoned by the corrupt emperor, but rescued by the marmoset Zek, who compares her situation to his previous experience of zoos and brings her the key to her cell.
-   _Joel Suzuki_: In _Secret of the Songshell_, Joel befriends a squirrel-like creature called a silvertail, which he names Sammy. Late in the book, he, Felicity, and Fireflower are all captured, tied up, and given a paralyzing potion. Fireflower tells Sammy to get her wavebow, the instrument that allows her to make Magic Music, which he does. Thanks to a lifetime of training, Fireflower is able to use the wavebow without touching it as long as it's nearby, and she uses its magic to cure the poison, untie their bonds, and retrieve Joel and Felicity's wavebows.
-   Played with in _The Twits_. Muggle-Wump the monkey and his family have been shown to be unable to communicate with the English birds, but when they have a surprise visit from their friend the Roly-Poly bird, with whom they can speak, Muggle-Wump sends him to fetch the key to the monkey cage when the Twits have gone out.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Goodies_: In "Daylight Robbery on the Orient Express", the Goodies escape their bondage by the getting the goat they happen to have with them on the train to eat the ropes tying them up.
-   In the second episode of _The Suite Life on Deck_ the main cast is entrapped in the same cell on Parrot Island. They escape when a feral pig Bailey befriended earlier gets them the keys, and was in the process of getting London a latte.
-   _The Westerner_: Subverted in "School Days": When Dave wakes up and finds himself bound hand and foot, he calls his dog Brown in and tries to get him to undo the ropes. Brown just licks the ropes and then goes to help himself to uneaten food on the table, leaving Dave to figure his own way out of the ropes.

    Music Videos 

-   Gwen Stefani's video, "The Sweet Escape", shows Gwen begging the tranquil lab holding the key to her Luxury Prison Suite to come closer. Her cellmates eventually manage to coax it over with a large gold bone.

    Theme Parks 

-   Before its destruction in a fire in 2018, _Europa-Park_'s "Piraten in Batavia" had the same scene as below, only it was in the Dutch East Indies and the pet was a monkey.
-   _Pirates of the Caribbean_: While the ride is taking you through the attack on Isla Tesoro, you can see and hear several prisoners trying to coax a mangy dog into bringing them the keys to their cell. The dog has the keys in its mouth, but doesn't seem certain about going to the cell door.

    Video Games 

-   Inverted in _Persona 5_. When the protagonist and Ryuji meet Morgana locked up in Kamoshida's Palace, they have to let him out in order for him to help them escape.
-   _Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge_: Guybrush is arrested as soon as he puts his feet on Phatt Island. The guard gives the keys to his beagle Walt, telling the protagonist that the dog will tear Guy to pieces if he tries to escape. However, Guybrush easily convinces Walt to give him the keys by offering him a bone from a skeleton that is in the cell. Obs: the game was released in 1991, a decade before the first movie of _Pirates of the Caribbean_.
-   _Wild ARMs_ does this in Pandemonium. The protagonists are locked in separate parts of the dungeon but there's (conveniently) a hole in the wall in Jack's cell, enabling Hanpan to wander around the vents in order to find a way to undo the magic keeping them locked up.

    Webcomics 

-   Invoked at one point in _Latchkey Kingdom_. With a twist — the dog with the keys is a sentient Hound fully capable of talking and object manipulation. Though, Hounds normally walk on fours and carry objects (like the key ring) in their mouths. For added irony, he's the marshal, the kingdom's one-dog police force, whom the captured teens should've contacted from the start instead of breaking into the mad doctor's mansion.

    Web Original 

-   Common enough to earn an appearance on the Evil Overlord List, where item 42 has the overlord vow to imprison the hero's pet along with the hero, to prevent it fetching the keys for them or otherwise breaking them out.
-   A variation occurs in the _Pirates SMP_ finale on Day 134, where Cruppy, Iris' familiar, is able to place and detonate TNT outside the cage to free Ivy from captivity by the Big Bad when given the chance.
-   In _Worm_, Taylor uses cockroaches to steal a cop's keys and get out of handcuffs.

    Western Animation 

-   In the _Action League NOW!_ episode, "Hey! Who Stole My Face?", a blender accident leaves Bill the Lab Guy to put The Chief and The Mayor back together. Bill does so, but accidentally switches their faces. The Mayor with The Chief's face takes advantage of this, and tricks the police into arresting The Chief with The Mayor's face. Because Justice, The Chief's pet dog is the only one who can tell The Chief and The Mayor apart even with their faces switched, he rescues The Chief with The Mayor's face by bringing him the keys to his jail cell.
-   _Josie And The Pussy Cats_ are trapped in prison capsules on the sea floor. Team Pet Sebastian the cat retrieves the keys from Captain Nemo's submarine, then plunks a Fishbowl Helmet on his head before descending to the sea floor to free them. Thanks to Toon Physics, this actually works.

    Real Life 

-   An orangutan at Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo found a piece of metal on the floor of his cage. He was so smart that he was able to bend the metal piece and use it to pick the lock of his cage. Zoo staff were wondering who was letting the orangutans out, and it took them awhile to discover that it was one of the animals themselves. The orangutan was so smart that he evaded detection for some time by hiding the metal piece in his mouth along the gumline.
