**Bartender:** Excuse me, ma'am, no porn at the bar.  
**Ida:** It's okay, I'm transgender.  
**Bartender:** Oh, I had no idea. Do whatever you want all the time.

Similarly to how Trans Equals Gay is the assumption that transgenderism the "next step up" of homosexuality or crossdressing, Trans Equals Hypersexual is the assumption that trans or gender-nonconforming people are more sexually "out there" than cisgender gay people, and even more so when compared to the general heterosexual population.

In media, this manifests as trans characters having a sex life that is wildly different from any cisgender or otherwise sexually "normal" characters, usually featuring one or more of the following:

-   They have an Extreme Libido, constantly talking about and/or having sex.
-   They're an Extreme Omnisexual who's willing to sleep with anyone and everyone.
-   They avoid monogamy and prefer lots of short-term flings—sometimes multiple at the same time.
-   They have no sexual filters or boundaries, such as dressing provocatively, getting TMI in conversations, or acting sexual and flirtatious in public.
-   They're into weird fetishes.
-   They're sexualizing their own transition, e.g., a trans woman who goes full Plastic Bitch and gets large breast and butt implants.
-   They're willfully involved in The Oldest Profession in some way, such as prostitution or pornography.
-   They willing to seduce people with immoral or underhanded means, such as concealing their trans identity while flirting with someone.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

A Coming-Out Story featuring this trope may depict a character with a seemingly normal sex life who becomes more promiscuous or freaky in bed after they come out or begin transitioning. This can be chock full of Unfortunate Implications, such as implying that they were a closeted pervert all along, that transitioning somehow corrupted their sexuality, or that their transition is itself a sexual kink. Downplayed examples may claim that rather than being linked to trans identity, it's due to libido shifts caused by hormone therapy.

This is often linked closely to stereotypes that All Gays are Promiscuous, where their interests are portrayed as solely lustful and hedonistic, in contrast to moral and romantic heterosexual relationships. And much like how any depictions of gay romance tend to be labeled as gratuitous or over-the-top, depictions of trans/GNC sexuality tend to be labeled as overly sexual or fetishistic under any circumstance. It also may contain other transphobic undertones, such as implying that All Men Are Perverts is true for all trans women too.

There is a degree of Truth in Television in the sense that there are hypersexual trans and queer people, but it's hardly universal; the sexuality and sex drive of people within the queer community ranges from hypersexual to asexual. There are also debates in queer communities as to whether they should try and sanitize their public image as a reaction to this trope: advocates say they should stop reinforcing negative stereotypes, while opponents say it's attempting to pander to a society that will negatively judge them no matter what.

Compare Trans Equals Gay, All Gays are Promiscuous, Third Law Of Genderbending, Trans Relationship Troubles, and But Not Too Gay (or Too Bi). May overlap with Unsettling Gender-Reveal, Creepy Crossdresser, or Fan Disservice. For examples where it's simply about a trans or gender-nonconforming character simply being portrayed as sexually desired or attractive, please see Attractive Bent-Gender or Mr./Ms. Fanservice.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Tiger & Bunny_: Nathan was assigned male at birth and dresses very flamboyantly and sexily (even wearing high heels), and could definitely be seen as being "exotic", uses female Japanese Pronouns,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and self-describes as "one of the girls". Word of God states that Nathan considers themself to be "gender-free". Also, in the 6th Drama CD Nathan files a request to Yuri Petrov for a gender-neutral locker room. They act seductively towards men as well.

    Literature 

-   _Demon Lord, Retry!_: Yukikaze, a "girlish boy", is introduced licking a long popsicle, makes constant sexual innuendos and Double Entendres, and is very forward about the things he wants Kunai to do to his "holes". He is by far the most sexually-charged character in the series. Even the title of an episode frames Yukikaze's sexual advances as an "attack" on Kunai.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Transparent_: Averted during the first season, where Maura was the only character who wasn't engaging in raunchy sexual behavior. Then, it became an Enforced Trope in season 2, after trans writer Our Lady J took the reins and made it her mission to sexualize Maura without objectifying her.

    Webcomics 

-   _Ménage à 3_: Even given how hypersexualized most characters in the series are, the transgender Senna stands out, with most of the features listed above, including a fondness for anally penetrating men (although she has no involvement with prostitution and makes no attempts to conceal her trans status). Her sex scene with Gary involves Questionable Consent, given how drunk he is, and can be read as Black Comedy Rape (though it's him doing the penetrating in that case, and he expresses no regret subsequently).

    Western Animation 

-   _Bob's Burgers_: Downplayed with the transvestites that Bob meets in "Sheesh! Cab Bob?" who are the only recurring trans characters on the show. While they are sex workers and openly willing to do pretty kinky stuff on the job, they're also pretty respectful people. The most recurring trans character, Marshmallow, interacts cordially with the cast without her profession coming up most of the time.
-   _Family Guy_: In "Quagmire's Dad," Glenn's father Dan comes out as transgender and changes her name to Ida. She explicitly talks about what bottom surgery did to her genitals at a family dinner, browses porn on her phone in public, and doesn't disclose to Brian that she's trans before having sex with him.
