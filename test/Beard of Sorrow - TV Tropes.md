_"I'm a lot like my dad, I would have to say  
He's been wearing a beard ever since mom passed away  
She would have hated it"_

One of the easiest ways to show that a male character has fallen into depression is to show him with unkempt stubble or a full beard after a Time Skip. Happens to be Truth in Television: A common symptom of depression is loss of interest in personal appearance, which could mean a clean-shaven man quitting shaving or one with carefully groomed facial hair veering into Mountain Man territory. Often accompanied by the Drowning My Sorrows and Mess of Woe tropes.

Sub-Trope or perhaps Brother Trope to Good Hair, Evil Hair: just as a goatee indicates evil, stubble or an unkempt beard indicates squalor. Sub-Trope of Expository Hairstyle Change. See also Mangst. Contrast Perma-Stubble, which is the mark of a badass, and Wangst, which is telling, while this trope is showing. Also contrast Perma-Shave, where no facial hair grows. If the sorrow drives them to a Face–Heel Turn, it may double as a Beard of Evil. A beard caused by stress rather than distress is a case of Seriously Scruffy.

    He was degenerating visibly, under the eyes of all. He had entirely lost the almost foppish concern for his appearance and was grown careless and slovenly in his dress. He allowed a black beard to grow on cheeks that had ever been so carefully shaven; and the long, thick black hair, once so sedulously curled, hung now in a lank, untidy mane about a face that was changing from its vigorous swarthiness to an unhealthy sallow, whilst the blue eyes, that had been so vivid and compelling, were now dull and lackluster.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _24_
    -   At the beginning of the second season, Jack has one as he is shown missing his wife and daughter and possibly contemplating suicide. It takes the killing and beheading of a pedophile to snap him out of it and reach for the razor.
    -   He notably has stubble in the TV movie _Redemption_, as the events of the previous two seasons saw him being tortured beyond the brink physically and mentally and then by the end saw him giving up any sort of a normal life, so at this point, he's a shell of his former self.
-   Jasper starts season 3 of _The 100_ in a depressed funk with a goatee. This is in stark contrast with the preceding seasons, in which his clean-shaven face emphasized his innocence.
-   In the break between Seasons 1 and 2 of _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._, two of the male leads get Beards of Sorrow:
    -   Ward's doubles as a Beard of Evil, and is grown during his incarceration by SHIELD, after being outed as a HYDRA mole last season. However, he reveals to Skye that he attempted suicide several times when first imprisoned, and claims that he's latterly been pining for her, making it a Beard of Sorrow as well.
    -   In Fitz's case it's more like Stubble of Sorrow, but since he was perfectly clean-shaven throughout Season 1 it's noticeable nonetheless. At first, it seems like a reaction to the brain damage he suffered in the first season finale that, among other things, has left him with limited use of his hands. There's that, of course, but it's Simmons leaving the team after he told her he loved her that's really tipped him over the edge into a full-blown depressive breakdown.
-   In _Alias_, when Sydney is presumed dead in a house fire, Jack (who is correctly convinced that she's actually been kidnapped) ends up arrested by the CIA because his attempts to find her include illegal contact with her mother, a former KGB agent and wanted criminal. He spends months in custody and has a genuinely epic beard of sorrow by the time she comes back.
-   _Angel_: Starting towards the end of Season 3 after he gets his throat cut, Wesley, the formerly clean-shaven, glasses-wearing nerd loses his glasses, his boyish optimism, and his boyishly smooth cheeks. He kept it up for the rest of the series, too- this was The Stubble That Would Not Die. According to the Season 6 comics, not even when its owner did. It was part of Wesley's character development, a visual aid to his newly acquired badassery. Alexis Denisof once commented in one of the episode commentaries how difficult it was to maintain the stubble rather than either keeping clean-shaven or just actually growing a full beard. This was also Lampshaded in the memory-loss ep. "Spin The Bottle", where Wesley, who, along with the rest of the gang has woken up thinking he is in high school after a memory spell goes awry, scratches his chin thoughtfully and remarks "I seem to have grown about three days' worth of beard."
-   In _Band of Brothers_, Don Malarkey has quite a scruffy beard, starting right after two of his best friends get killed, and another has a Heroic BSoD, in episode 7. It's not until episode 10 that he's shown clean-shaven and (seemingly) happier.
-   In _Banshee_, Brock Lotus, in Season Three, mourning Emmett's death.
-   In the third season of _Barry_, Barry's deteriorating mental state is accompanied by him growing a beard.
-   _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_: Happens multiple times over the course of the show, some of them played with:
    -   There's a triple example during the New Caprica story arc. After the Time Skip humanity is doing pretty crappy and both Saul Tigh and Chief Tyrol sport big scruffy beards while Admiral Adama had a case of a _mustache_ of sorrow. They all lose their facial hair around the same time when the status quo is returned and they're able to leave the planet. Starbuck can also be said to have grown Long Hair of Sorrow during the same arc, while Apollo leaves his hair untampered with but has the Weight Gain of Sorrow to show his misery after Starbuck leaves him, marries Anders, and she and Apollo stop being friends, both of which also go away quickly after they're back on Galactica.
    -   Similarly, Gaius Baltar grows a beard during his trial after the events of New Caprica and loses it once he slips away into hiding.
    -   Tyrol again stops shaving after Cally is tossed out of a launch tube by Tory. And then later he goes all Private Pyle on us.
-   _Black Mirror_, "Beyond the Sea": Cleanshaven family man David grows a shaggy beard after the deaths of his family.
-   _Bones_:
    -   Booth grows one while in prison after being framed for murder. Shaving it after he’s out and Bones talks sense into him signals his return to normal.
    -   Hodgins probably counts too in season 11 despite having a beard already. It gets thick and bushy when he’s dealing with post paralysis depression and he goes back to his typical beater style after coming to terms with it.
-   Jesse grows one in the second half of season 5 of _Breaking Bad_. Walt later grows one following his exile to New Hampshire.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: Xander Harris grows one shortly after Renee's death in Season 8.
-   _Burn Notice_: In "Good Soldier", Michael Westen adopts the persona of an alcoholic and stops shaving.
-   On _Charmed_, after Phoebe rejects and divorces Cole, he grows a beard, goes insane, and attempts suicide only to discover that he's Nigh-Invulnerable.
-   The first episode of _Chuck_'s third season sees Chuck grow one of these after he loses both Sarah and his spy job. He shaves it off after making the decision to try winning her back. We actually see it growing in a series of cuts as Chuck's life wastes slowly away.
-   Danny Messer, after being shot in the back on _CSI: NY_. It started with a few-month time skip between seasons and then only lasted a few eps after the season opener, getting shaved off when he found he could walk again.
-   _The Defenders (2017)_: In a lesser case, Matt Murdock's Perma-Stubble has grown out a little bit since Elektra's demise.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "The Wedding of River Song": The Eleventh Doctor grows one of these while held in the Tower of London by the Holy Roman Emperor Winston Churchill. It's a long story.
    -   The War Doctor sports a moustache and goatee in sharp contrast to the other male Doctors, who are generally clean-shaven barring some instances of sideburns and/or Perma-Stubble. He started out clean-shaven, but given that he fought in the Time War, it's no wonder.
-   Constable Fraser talks of this happening with his father, Bob Fraser, after his mother's death in _Due South_. He recalls his dad then suddenly coming out of his depression, shaving, and making breakfast one morning.
-   Dr. Romano in _ER_, after his arm gets cut off by a helicopter blade.
-   _Farscape_: John Crichton has grown these twice in the show's run.
    -   The first was in season one episode "Jeremiah Crichton" after Moya and the crew accidentally leave him behind on an island where technology doesn't work due to sci-fi reasons. As the local residents of the planet are all perfectly groomed with nary a beard or leg hair in sight it's implied that Crichton deliberately let his beard grow, either to set himself apart from them or due to his depression about falling out with his shipmates.
    -   He grows another beard during the break between seasons three and four after getting stranded (again) on a dying Leviathan. When Chiana and Rygel show up to rescue him the first thing he does is shave the beard off. This time around Ben Browder grew a beard for real during the hiatus, but fans often claim it looks _less_ realistic than the fake beard in "Jeremiah Crichton".

Also played with, in that the beard only showed up for less than two minutes of screen time before it was shaved off, in stages, as he kept walking in and out of the bathroom to shave off portions of the beard between taking part in a group conversation in the living room.

-   _Manifest_: The normally well-groomed Ben totally neglects himself in a two-year time skip after his wife is murdered and his daughter kidnapped.

After Jess goes missing for a year due to being caught unawares in a time skip, she returns to find everyone else more or less unchanged except Rudy, who's sporting a Beard of Sorrow of epic proportions, complete with mountain-man shaggy hair and a grubby pajamas/dressing gown combo that he actually wears out to the bar. Though it's an otherwise heartbreaking scene - Rudy literally crumples to the floor and _sobs_ upon learning that Jess is back - his appearance is so over-the-top pathetic it's hard not to find it funny at the same time.
-   _NCIS_: Gibbs, after being blown up, and retires (temporarily). Even if it is just a mustache.

-   _The Shield_: Actor David Rees Snell, who played "Ronnie Gardocki" on "The Shield", upgraded in his trademark moustache to a full-fledged beard in between seasons two and three of the series (largely to sidestep the issue of his character being brutally disfigured in season two by having a beard cover up where his scars were). The character shaved off the beard midway through season six, to please a new girlfriend of his, but after finding out that fellow Strike Team member Shane Vendrell had not only murdered Ronnie's friend Lem, and had exposed Vic and Ronnie's involvement in robbing several million dollars from a local crime syndicate's money laundering ring, the beard came back for revenge as Ronnie sought (unsuccessfully) to save himself from being destroyed by Shane and Vic's war.
