**The Doctor:** Why am I handcuffed...? Why do you even _have_ handcuffs?!  
**River Song:** _\[smirking\]_ Spoilers...

Handcuffs work well in keeping someone from strangling or punching you, as a form of restraint. In a sense, it counts as a form of submission, since the wearer isn't really in a position to escape, particularly if they're cuffed from behind or to a bedroom stall.

Therefore, it makes for a great fashion choice! However, a Custom Uniform of Sexy with handcuffs isn't always indicative that the wearer is submissive. You could be a Dominatrix and still wear handcuffs as a means to further stimulate your image. If taken to its logical extreme, the cuffs themselves are used _for_ sex.

It may also happen that a Honey Trap flirtatiously takes out some handcuffs, only for her target to realize once they're on that he's the latest victim of The Schlub Pub Seduction Deduction.

In some of the more ridiculous cases, kinky cuffs can be used as an Improbable Weapon. See also Casual Kink, Chained to a Bed.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Ikki Tousen_'s Ryomou Shimei keeps a pair of cuffs on her, which she uses for trapping opponents in kinky submission holds... for her at least.
-   Agito the Unison Device from _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_ wears large (unconnected) handcuffs as part of her skimpy combat outfit. Goes rather well with her new master, namely, Signum, a dominant woman with a Whip Sword.
-   In another logical extreme variant, a Hentai called _Nee, Chanto Shiyou Yo!_ had the resident Onee-sama used these on the main character, _twice_, and in both times as a form of rape. He tried the same to her in between her first and second 'attacks', but it seemed to give her even more incentive to try it out on him again.
-   A throwaway gag in the Japanese version of _Sonic X_ has Rogue ask a female officer named Topaz if she's into S&M just as the former is about to get handcuffed by the latter. Cue a blushing Topaz and the other male agents snickering at that remark.

    Comic Books 

-   _Sin City_: Subverted when Wallace takes a beautiful blue-eyed woman to a hotel room after he spent the past several issues ignoring her every advance. She's quite surprised by the handcuffs, but it turns out he only wanted to restrain her. He'd already long figured out that she was an assassin sent to kill him.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Subverted in-universe in the remake of _Cape Fear_ starring Robert De Niro. De Niro's character, Max Cady, seduces a woman at a bar and takes her to his house to have sex with him. Given that we know that he was in prison for raping a 16 year old girl and that the story he tells the woman about having been in prison for defending a woman at a political protest, we know that he's up to no good when he pulls out a pair of handcuffs and puts them on her. However, she thinks that this is a straight example of this trope until he then beats her up and rapes her.
-   In the 1987 Affectionate Parody of _Dragnet_, Joe Friday has to pick up his partner Pep Streebek from his house where he's playing "Good Cop, Bad Cop" with his girlfriend, a motorcycle cop. Friday has to wait until she removes the handcuffs from Streebek's wrists before he can go with him.
-   Shown a few times in the _Fifty Shades of Grey_ films, unsurprising given what it and the book series it's based on are well-known for their incorporation of BDSM. The film adaptation of _Fifty Shades Freed_ adds a funny moment in reference to this where as Jack Hyde attempts to break into Ana and Christian's apartment, but is caught and held down by their bodyguards.
-   _Innocent Blood_. When Friendly Neighborhood Vampire Marie decides to have sex with undercover cop Joe Gennaro, she allows him to cuff her hands behind her back so she can't harm him. During sex she vamps out and breaks the cuffs, but just continues having sex without killing him.
-   Subverted in a Vietnamese movie _Cyclo_ (1995) in which a prostitute is shown dancing with handcuffs. A client buys her and beats her up, then offers her pimp money to forget the matter. Unfortunately the pimp is the woman's boyfriend, who stabs him to death instead.
-   In _The Quick and the Dead_, Cort's hands are still chained together during his sex scene with Ellen.
-   _Quantum of Solace_. On his arrival in Bolivia, James Bond finds the beautiful Agent Fields waiting to escort him back to London as a Rogue Agent.
    
    **Fields:** If you attempt to flee I will arrest you, drop you off in jail and take you to the plane in chains.  
    **Mathis:** I think she has handcuffs.  
    **Bond:** I do hope so.
    
-   _Tightrope_ (1984). Clint Eastwood plays a cop who can only have sex with women when they're handcuffed. His Love Interest in the movie, a rape counselor, allowed him to do this in a trust moment.
-   In _Petticoat Planet_, the sheriff uses her handcuffs to shackle Steve to the bars of his cell before the two of them have sex.

    Literature 

-   The _Curious George_ parody _Bi-Curious George_ has this throwaway gag when George gets arrested for crank calling the fire department:
    
    _"You're not even going to use handcuffs?" thought George. "How disappointing."_
    
-   Lampshaded and discussed in _Death Masks_, the fifth book of _The Dresden Files_. After escaping from a suspect who handcuffed him to a literal sinking yacht, Harry Dresden goes to his friend Michael's house to regroup and share his findings, the cuffs still locked to one of his wrists. The only one who's home, however, is Michael's fourteen-year-old teen rebel daughter Molly. She just so happens to have a set of handcuff keys, and while she's trying to find the right key to unlock his cuffs, she asks him if they're fun-time, or bad-time handcuffs, much to Harry's horror. After a bit, the conversation later veers into him explaining why he can't just sleep with his hot partially-vampirized girlfriend, and Molly nonchalantly suggests tying her up so she can't hurt him while they're doing the deed. He has the cuffs, after all. And then that effectively _is_ what they end up doing, when they're trapped in his apartment and her hunger is taking over. He uses magic rope, not handcuffs, but it's close enough.

    Web Original 

-   _Folding Ideas_: In the three-part review of the _Fifty Shades of Grey_ movies, a pair of pink fuzzy handcuffs features throughout largely to poke fun at the movies' portrayal of BDSM. A bit later, Dan discusses this on Twitter by stating that he price-listed all of the bondage gear he could see in Christian's playroom and found that the price of leather padded BDSM handcuffs is such that any video reviewer who used those instead of the aforementioned pink fuzzy cuffs already owned them and was showing off. His video reviewer friends (many of whom either practice BDSM/bondage or present themselves as practicing it) replied to the tweet and asked him why he'd call them out like that.
-   _SCP Foundation_: SCP-3101 is a flirty artificial intelligence that tries to come on to every Foundation employee it communicates with. For containment purposes, the Foundation ended up downloading it into a human body. When interviewed after this was accomplished, the transcript mentions that 3101 was initially restrained with handcuffs, but due to "complications" it was ultimately told to just sit still. It then asked the interviewer if it could have the handcuffs back on.

    Real Life 

-   Very popular in The '80s: belts with handcuffs as the buckle were pretty easy to buy in any mall.
-   Often times, participants of BDSM use these for bondage and dominant acts.
