"Why, God, why? LET THE OTHERS GROW OLD, NOT ME!"

_As I'm flirting with forty  
There's no time to wait  
And I can't help but feel  
I'm already too late!_

Milestone birthdays are those that society has deemed important (13, 16, 18, 21, the "decade" birthdays, and other years significant to the character or their culture) and are meant to be happy, if retrospective, affairs. Fiction, however, tends to treat them as the year equivalent of the First Gray Hair — a character is approaching 30/40/50 and increasingly dreads it.

What's so special about a milestone birthday compared to a regular birthday, you may ask? Likely, the character dislikes the major reminder of getting older and the connotations of being 'someone in their 30s/40s/50s' that they are not yet prepared for. Someone turning 30 might not be want to leave their wild 20s behind and settle down, someone turning 40 may have unfulfilled career or marriage prospects, someone turning 50 isn't yet ready to start feeling 'old', and so on. Can be played for a quick gag, cause a drastic life decision, spark a full-blown Hollywood Midlife Crisis, or anything in between.

In serial works, this comes up during a Birthday Episode. Usually, there'll be a big party celebrating the milestone birthday that the character is _not_ looking forward to. Sometimes, this will culminate in aesop about accepting your natural aging and learning to live life to the fullest without looking back.

Compare Birthday Hater, who despises all birthdays, not just the milestone ones, and First Gray Hair, another biological marker that makes a character freak out about aging. See also Growing Up Sucks, Dangerous 16th Birthday, Bittersweet 17, My Biological Clock Is Ticking, and Old Maid. Not to be confused with Milestone Celebration, which is when the _work_ does something to celebrate its age/length.

-   _Bob and Margaret_ uses this trope as the Inciting Incident for the series in its 1993 predecessor _Bob's Birthday_, a one-off short-film, when Bob has a _crisis de confidence_ and mid-life crisis over becoming 40 which averts the Hollywood Midlife Crisis trope for a more Slice of Life take on things.
