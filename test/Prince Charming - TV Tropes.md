_The prince went to meet her, took her by the hand and danced with her. He would dance with no other maiden, and never left loose of her hand, and if any one else came to invite her, he said, "This is my partner."_

What comes to mind when we think of a prince?

He's an aristocrat with a magnetic personality, probably dashing, brave, gallant, and kind, a true prince. In Fairy Tales, he often rescues the Damsel in Distress and marries her to live Happily Ever After. If he's saving himself for his true princess he'll be her Celibate Hero but if he's more interested in impressing the ladies with his father's money, he's a Millionaire Playboy.

Except, actually, all the princes in those tales were very seldom named. It was simply a "prince" or "king" or royalty of some sort. And when they did have names, they were commonplace names: John, Ivan, Jean, Hans, etc.

The term Prince Charming actually originates from an 1889 translation of _Le roi Charmant_, the Charming King, and then a year later the phrase "Prince Charming" was used in _The Picture of Dorian Gray_.

The term stuck.

Nowadays, the classic Prince Charming is almost never used, possibly because the Ruritanias which he often hailed from have largely abandoned monarchy, or joined the EU. The trope has been subverted, double subverted, inverted, averted, diverted, converted, and perverted (and ridiculed, but that's nothing to be scared of). Nowadays, he's more likely to be Prince Charmless — rude, smug, or evil — or at least naive, unmotivated, or self-centered.

It's only the rarest of instances where he can be played straight and done right. And under those circumstances he will be given his own name, and not called Prince Charming. (Anyone actually _named_ "Prince Charming" is guaranteed to be a subversion). When he does have charm he can be found practicing Old-School Chivalry. In most instances, he will start out with some flaws and undergo Character Development until he earns the title.

The term can also be used metaphorically for a Princely Young Man: a youth with Old Money bearing and manners. Contrast the bad boy charm of All Girls Want Bad Boys.

The Spear Counterpart to Princess Classic and ground zero for any Princely Tropes.

Compare The Wise Prince, Knight In Shining Armour. Subject to the Ermine Cape Effect.

In terms of the ranks of Authority Tropes, the tropes that are equal are The Evil Prince, Prince Charmless, Warrior Prince, Sheltered Aristocrat, The Wise Prince, and all Princess Tropes. The next steps down are The Good Chancellor, Standard Royal Court and Decadent Court. The next steps up are The Caligula, The Good King, God Save Us from the Queen! and The High Queen.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Candy Candy_, there is the mysterious "Prince from the Hill", a handsome young man dressed in a kilt, who makes Candy smile again when she was sad, and then vanishes in the into thin air, leaving only pendant with a small bell as the only evidence of his existence. In the last episode of the series is finally revealed that the prince was Albert, who was also Candy´s Mysterious Protector "Uncle" William. Anthony (From the same series) also may count. In fact, the first time Candy meets Anthony, she thought that he was her "Prince from the Hill" since both had a similar appearance and personality.
-   In _A Certain Scientific Railgun_, Misaki Shokohou comments that whenever Touma Kamijou saves people, he looks like a gallant prince.
-   _Fruits Basket_, Yuki is called this by schoolmates who are ignorant of his traumatic past and problematic family relationships.
-   Fate's tendency to rescue Nanoha in the nick of time throughout the franchise of _Lyrical Nanoha_ has prompted their voice actresses to joke that Fate is Nanoha's prince. Gender inverted in that Fate is female, but then again, so is Nanoha. _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha INNOCENT_, having kicked the Ship Tease between the two up, has another character flat out state this. Nanoha's response is to blush heavily.

-   In _Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun_, the Drama Club often makes drama featuring characters of this type, usually cross cast by Kashima. Her participation in this kind of role earns her epithet, "the Prince of the School."

-   This is Tamaki's schtick in _Ouran High School Host Club_ - a dashing, flirtatious half-French charmer who girls line up to swoon over.
-   _Pokémon: The Series_: James of Team Rocket has shades of this, with a little Gentleman Thief for good measure. Given that he's from a rich, affluent family, it sort of fits. It's more obvious in the Japanese motto, where he uses the line "Lovely, charming villains" to describe himself and his teammates.
-   _Princess Tutu_'s overall aim in fixing Mytho's broken heart is to turn him back into this.
-   _Revolutionary Girl Utena_:
    -   Utena aspires to be this, though she combines it part-and-parcel with Knight in Shining Armor. She in turn draws inspiration to be this from the enigmatic Prince Dios, who she barely remembers rescuing her from her sorrow after losing her parents. The Student Council (_sans_ Nanami) also exhibit various Prince Charming subtropes, though they all fall short.
    -   While it's not immediately obvious, _Utena_ pokes a _lot_ of holes applying this trope to real life. By the end, the show makes it clear that the Prince archetype should neither be sought nor emulated, as it's almost impossible to achieve and completely unsustainable even then. Case-in-point: Prince Dios was a Physical God with the power to revolutionize the world, and _even he crumbled beneath the strain of embodying male perfection_.

-   In _She's My Knight_, Ichinose _thinks_ he's this trope, but Mogami outshines him at every turn (and he falls for her).

    Comic Books 

-   Bill Willingham's comic book _Fables_ (about characters from fairy tales living in secret in New York) has Prince Charming, who was married three times, to Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella. He's a bit of a Magnificent Bastard and eventually becomes Mayor of Fabletown. Deconstructed as well, in that the effortless charmer is an absolute master at _getting_ what he wants, but actually putting in the hard work to _keep_ it is another matter entirely. He ends up failing horribly as mayor and resigning, and instead leading the Fabletown war effort against the Adversary, where his personal daring, intense focus on goals, and excellent mind for Xanatos Speed Chess over longterm chessmastering make him extremely successful.
-   _Young Avengers_: Loki suggests that Hulkling is really this, having been created by his boyfriend Wiccan's Reality Warper powers to subconsciously fulfill his fantasy of meeting and falling in love with this type of character. He points out the improbability of a gay teenage boy meeting, and perfectly matching, a gay alien prince. Of course, this is coming from Loki, and both Hulkling and Wiccan were listed as part of the Avengers Fail-Safe Program, being descendants of prior members of _The Avengers_. Prodigy dismisses it as "existential nonsense", and eventually Hulkling even acknowledges there's no way Wiccan at that point could've done it.
-   The Mirror Universe counterpart of King Sombra from _My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic (IDW)_ is the trope played very much straight.
-   The Queen of Fables thinks that Superman is Prince Charming and wants to either kill him or marry him. Maybe both.

    Fairy Tales 

-   "Tattercoats": The prince runs into a poor, rag-wearing goose girl walking around barefoot and begs her to marry with him. When Tattercoats tells him to stop mocking her, the prince asks her to go to the court so he can prove his sincerity by presenting her as his bride to everybody.

    Fan Works 

-   _Child of the Storm_ has Harry, who, though a little overwhelmed by his new status as a Prince of Asgard (Thor was James Potter. It Makes Sense in Context), ticks every box. However, he's initially a dorky variant of The Charmer, though he gets _much_ smoother over the first and second book - something hinted to have a lot to do with growing self-confidence and observation of his father, Loki, Tony, and Natasha. He is still a complete dork around Carol, however.
    -   Thor, of course, though a little less polished and urbane than the below-mentioned Loki.
    -   Loki, sort of. Perfectly charming in an urbane fashion and perfectly pleasant after his Heel–Face Turn a couple of years prior... but he's also The Spymaster, a Magnificent Bastard with few equals and capable of letting his inner monster out on special occasions, somewhat subverting this.
-   In _Divided Rainbow_, Rarity's favorite pet name for Lero Michealides is 'my sweet prince.'
-   _Ultra Fast Pony_ subverts this _without_ invoking Prince Charmless. Prince Blueblood is handsome royalty and a perfect gentlestallion. Unfortunately, the heroine Rarity has a mile-wide masochistic streak, so she _wants_ a prince who will boss her around and hurt her. Rarity loses interest in Prince Blueblood because he's too nice.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Charming_: Played with, as the prince's "charm" is part of a curse — as long as it's in effect, no woman can love anyone other than him. The central plot revolves around him trying to get rid of his charm, only to get the real non-magical version in the process.
-   Disney Animated Canon: Even though the movies have never used the name Prince Charming, this trope is still quite common.
    -   The princes in _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_, _Cinderella_, and _Sleeping Beauty_ are often referred to as such. Snow White's prince is simply "the Prince", although she does refer to him as _being_ charming. Sleeping Beauty's prince is the only one given a real name, Prince Phillip. Later merchandise and such identifies "Prince Charming" specifically as Cinderella's prince, though in the film he's only ever referred to as "The Prince" or "The Noble Prince". It should be noted that in _Snow White_ and _Cinderella_ the prince does little more than show up and be royal, while Phillip due to his extended screen time comes the closest to actually portraying this trope.
    -   _The Little Mermaid (1989)_: Eric is one of the last examples of this trope being played straight in Western media. Notably, unlike the Princes from _Sleeping Beauty_ or _Snow White_, he is a well-developed character.
    -   Notably in light of the above, the Princes in subsequent Disney films play with the trope in various ways, and have even come to subvert it quite forcefully. They may refuse their royal duties (Simba), be jerks at first though they later improve (Beast, Kuzco), start off as commoners who rise to the status of prince through marriage (Aladdin, Flynn Rider), appear charming but turn out to be a womanizing Manchild (Naveen), or even the Big Bad (Hans).
-   _Shrek_: Inverted in the sequels, as Prince Charming is vain, selfish, a sissy coward and in _Shrek the Third_, evil.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   There is a _Princess_ Charming In Jerry Lewis’s _Cinderfella_. The movie's plot is partially Cinderella gender-swapped, and the stepmother throws the ball. It being the 1960s, Princess Charming (yes, that's her actual name), plays straight most of the Charming and Classic tropes.
-   Kit, the prince in _Cinderella (2015)_, is a rare example in a modern film played straight. Though there is a slight subversion in that he must learn how to be a competent ruler once his father dies and does end the story as a king.
-   Prince Edward from _Enchanted_ is Prince Charming Played for Laughs. He's good-natured, handsome, and heroic, but he's kind of thick. And it turns out he's not the right man for Giselle—but when he realizes this, he gallantly steps aside for her true prince.
-   _Into the Woods_:
    
    -   Cinderella's prince is an Exact Words version. Specifically he's The Charmer:
    
    "I was raised to be charming, not sincere."
    
    -   His younger brother gets Adaptational Heroism from the stage show, staying faithful to Rapunzel and even searching for her while blind. He's a little more clumsy and dorky than Cinderella's prince though.
-   _Kate & Leopold_ has Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany who writes the best apology letter in the history of mankind.
-   _Maleficent_ features the aforementioned Prince Philip, but the main subversion is that his kiss doesn't wake Aurora up. Nonetheless all other parts of the trope are played straight and the two are implied to end up together.
-   _Mirror, Mirror_ is one of the very few modern movies based on fairy tales which play this trope almost completely straight with Andrew Alcott, a character with most of the usual Prince Charming traits.
-   In the Czech movie _Byl jednou jeden král_ (_Once upon a time there was a king_, an adaptation of the fairy tale _Salt over gold_) there are three princes who came to the kingdom as suitors for the three princesses: Prince Charming <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , Prince Valiant, and Prince Cunning. They are all braggarts and cowards, and eventually they help themselves to the royal treasure - while the three princesses, as well as the king himself, get married to commoners in the end.
-   Played straight in the movie _The Prince & Me_ as Prince Edvard goes from having a girl on each arm to "Eddie" who quotes William Shakespeare like some duke-lord guy.
-   Played straight in _Prince Charming_, a 2001 made-for-television film starring Sean Maguire. It is the story of a prince who gets turned into a frog due to dashingly rescuing a damsel in distress, who starts trying to reward him.
-   _The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement_: Andrew Jacoby is an English duke<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  but fits the part in all other aspects. He's an Oxbridge-educated young man who does volunteer work and photography, has experience as a military pilot, and is apparently a champion swimmer. He's nothing but kind and understanding to Mia and accepts that a Marriage of Convenience with her won't all be smooth sailing.
-   Subverted in _Snow White & the Huntsman_ as the prince has become an Action Survivor due to the queen's tyrannical rule. He also becomes an Unlucky Childhood Friend to Snow White - but is still presented as a good guy.
-   While _Snow White and the Three Stooges_ almost squandered the leads, the prince had a greatly expanded role compared to the actual fairy tale.

    Literature 

-   Played with in _A Brother's Price_: Prince Alannon was a dignified, quiet-spoken man, who was very handsome and liked to take regular baths. Very charming. However, his marriage to the protagonist's grandmothers came about not by him rescuing one of them, but by his being _kidnapped_ by them. He eventually seems to have consented to marry them, which is not such a big surprise considering that the best he could have hoped for would have been an Arranged Marriage, if not imprisonment or death, since his branch of the family was on the losing side of the war. And they _did_ build him a bathhouse.
-   Justified in the contemporary book _Dream Boy_ written by Ann Reit, which stars a charming, but immature teenager who learned it from his father.
-   _Ella Enchanted_ exaggerates this. The prince's name is Charmont, which is sorta like Charming and borders on _charmant_, which is French for "charming" and comes from the Fairy Tale "The Blue Bird" where the hero was called _Le Roi Charmant_ ("the charming king"). He prefers to be called Char, though.
-   _Endo and Kobayashi Live! The Latest on Tsundere Villainess Lieselotte_ is a variation of the "Reborn as Villainess" Story, where the prince fiances of the titular "villainess" often have some glaring personality flaws, ranging from Broken Ace at the most sympathetic to Royal Brat at the least. His initial misunderstanding of Lieselotte's Tsundere behaviour aside, Prince Siegwald is one of the few cases that don't. This is probably due to it having a different Point of View than the formula; whereas the mold place the point of view to the universe the prince is in, _Endo and Kobayashi Live!_ puts the point of view on the _other side_ of the Fourth Wall: two Ordinary High School Students MSTing a Romance Game where Siegwald is one of the romance targets.
-   Deconstructed in _The Folk of the Air._ Prince Dain at first appears this way. He’s a kind, handsome, golden-haired, knight. He is one of the few fae to be kind and respectful towards the main character, and acts as a mentor towards her. In reality, he has worked to create this image in order to gain the favor of the court and his father. Additionally, he uses this image of honor and kindness in order to trick others. The favoritism from his father and the court has only furthered his entitlement to the throne, and he will do anything to ensure he inherits the throne after his father. This includes framing a child for murder and murdering his lover.
-   In _Guns of the Dawn_, Luthrian IV of Lascanne, although a king rather than a prince, fits this archetype — young, handsome, unmarried, and a good dancer — as Emily personally discovers. He's widely hailed by his adoring subjects as The Good King, too — but isn't.
-   _The Hero's Guide To Saving Your Kingdom_ by Chris Healy takes this trope and runs all over the map with it. The princes of four different fairy tales (Cinderella, Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White) get the short end of the stick when their stories are popularized because everyone remembers the princesses' names, but their names (Fredrick, Gustav, Liam and Duncan respectively) are lost and are just called "Charming", even though all four are radically different people. They eventually team up and become a league of Princes Charming.

-   Given how soon it was written after the term originated, _The Picture of Dorian Gray_ is likely one of the first subversions. Dorian is called this by extremely naive actress Sybil who he seduces and abandons, driving her to suicide. Another lover also apparently called him this, and uses the nickname scornfully when he encounters her several years later as a prostitute.
-   Played straight in _The Royal Diaries_
    -   _Elisabeth: The Princess Bride_ where Emperor Franz Joseph I was able to win over Elisabeth because she considered him to be playful, considerate and charming.
    -   In _Isabel: Jewel of Castilla_ where it takes less than two hours for Fernando, Prince of Aragon and King of Sicily, to steal the princess's heart with his humor, authority and imagination.
    -   Interestingly zigzagged in _Marie Antoinette: Princess of Versailles_. At first Antonia is repulsed at fat and ugly Louis Auguste but as time goes on, he reveals that he's shy, sweet and even becomes devoted to her. While she doesn't fall in love with him, Antonia does call him her friend.
-   John Moore's _Slay and Rescue_ has a professional hero who really **is** a prince named Charming, sent by his father's chancellor to rescue fair maidens all over the place (the theory is that it keeps him too busy to try to take over the throne). He deliberately pulls Big Damn Heroes arrivals, is a Master Swordsman, and is very frustrated. Nonetheless, he's also basically decent.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_:
    -   Prince Joffrey Baratheon is Prince Charmless and The Caligula, but Sansa sees him as a Prince Charming… for a while.
    -   His brother Prince Tommen, however, is genuinely kind and sweet-tempered (though he's only eight). Sansa even says she would have preferred to have married Tommen.
    -   Prince Rhaegar Targaryen was a _very_ charming prince until his love for a woman he was not betrothed to incited Robert's Rebellion
    -   Wrong Genre Savvy Prince Quentyn Martell really _wants_ to be a Prince Charming.
-   _The Sunne in Splendour_: Richard of Gloucester is a deconstruction of this. He's an idealist and a moralist, and he certainly aspires to be a Prince Charming. He relishes saving his childhood sweetheart Anne from the schemes of his brother George, becoming her Knight in Shining Armor. However, Richard also has a furious temper, is stubborn and his other brother Edward IV observes that Richard thinks they are living in Camelot and not England. In the end, Richard's life takes a series of dark turns and doesn't prove as adept at managing his enemies as Edward was.
-   Played straight with Prince Jonathan of Tortall in _Song of the Lioness_ who is a lover and a fighter. And oh _boy_ is he a lover - right up until he meets Thayet, anyway, and she steals his heart and his ability to speak in all of ten seconds.
-   In _The Stormlight Archive_, Adolin Kholin displays many traits of Prince Charming: he is genuinely kind, caring, and a gallant warrior to boot, and is one of the only people to hold the full trust of his father until it's revealed that it was Adolin who murdered Highprince Sadeas, that is. In many ways, he is also a subversion of this trope, having great difficulty with forming meaningful relationships with women. Indeed, he is a serial womanizer with a colorful dating history.
-   In Terry Pratchett's _Unseen Academicals_, Glenda objects to Trev as Juliet's love because Juliet is special and all she needed was a prince — and she remembers her own fantasies. Juliet and Trev do end up together, and Glenda ends up with a king to be.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The "Dream Prince" in _Akumuchan_ is a deliberate example of this trope. He is handsome, charming, rides a horse, and seems to exist for the sole purpose of rescuing Ayami from her troubled dreams and wooing her.
-   Imitated/played for laughs so to speak on _Bones_ "The Prince in the Plastic", which had a victim who created a doll called 'Prince Charmington' and a suspect who dressed as the doll for store openings and such.
-   In the first season of _Bridgerton_ this trope is Invoked very explicitly by Queen Charlotte herself when she pressures Prince Friedrich to pursue Daphne, even though he has already concluded from Lady Whistledown's paper, and from observing her, that she is in love with Simon.
    
    **Queen Charlotte:** You are a Prince. Charm her.
    
-   In the musical episode of _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, "Once More With Feeling", Buffy rescues a handsome prince, in an inversion of the traditional rescue scenario. He sings "How can I repay—" but Buffy cuts him off with "Whatever" given that she's in her depressed period.
-   _Charmed_:
    -   "A Knight To Remember" summons a prince from medieval times to San Francisco. Aside from the obvious issues of a medieval knight in 21st century California would face, he's quite charming. Of course some of this is due to him being under a love spell.
    -   Mentioned in the Fairy Tale Motifs episode "Happily Ever After". Paige eats Snow White's poisoned apple and it's said that a prince's kiss will free her. But thankfully once the Wicked Witch that cursed her is defeated, the spell wears off. Nonetheless one of the dwarves suggests she get a prince just in case it happens again. The episode also features a love interest for Phoebe whose last name is Prince - and he serves as the prince in the Cinderella portion of the episode. But with one small difference: he's under the control of the Wicked Witch.
    -   Again alluded to by Phoebe's child self, who loved Cinderella and asked if Cole was her Prince.
-   Simon Tam from _Firefly_ is not a literal prince, but he _is_ a kind, brave, attractive young man from a wealthy, aristocratic family who insists on acting "properly" (in the Old-School Chivalry sense) even in the worst of circumstances, making him a rare modern straight example.
-   _Game of Thrones_: Joffrey intentionally puts on this act for Sansa. It lasts for about half an episode before his true colors are revealed.
-   Justified for Logan from _Gilmore Girls_ who is his father's heir, charismatic, and quite a ladies man.
-   He appears in _GoGo Sentai Boukenger_ to any lady who wore the Glass Slipper. He then traps her in his world with the help of one of Cinderella's Stepsisters. His true form is that of a monster, and he is killed off by the Boukengers.
-   _Gossip Girl_: Nate Archibald is all but explicitly based on this trope. He is described as charming with extreme regularity, and has the tendency to fall passionately in love (with various girls) and deliver romantic speeches (occasionally hilariously out of context) while rescuing them from some emotional or social dragon. He is in the books given the epithet "prince of the upper east side" and it is said that he can "snap his fingers and have any girl he wants." If you gave him fencing lessons, he would basically be the Prince Charming from Fables.
-   Prince Arthur in _Merlin_ (BBC) probably fits this. While he's a bit mean to his servant Merlin sometimes, when it comes to his love interest Gwen - he's this trope incarnate.
-   _Once Upon a Time_
    -   The main Prince James, is sarcastically (at first) nicknamed Prince Charming by his future wife, Snow White, when he captures her in a net. She says that he's so charming if that's the only way he can get someone. Of course she did steal from him.
    -   All the princes in the series fit the trope, including Cinderella's and Sleeping Beauty's Princes. Probably a rare instance in modern television where the trope is played straight for the most part, although James turns out secretly not to be of legit royal blood.
    -   Averted with the actual Prince James. The guy was a dick.
    -   Robin Hood surprisingly ticks all the boxes, despite being an outlaw. But if one remembers that he is technically the Prince of \*Thieves\*, then it fits. He's charming enough to act as the Evil Queen's Second Love.
-   In the season 1 finale of _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_ Sabrina is trapped in a troll's tower (and is legally bound to be there). The only loophole in the law is that a prince can rescue her. Further Loophole Abuse occurs when her aunts realise that Sabrina's boyfriend Harvey's father owns an extermination business and calls himself the Termite King - technically making Harvey the 'Termite Prince'. Hilda and Zelda also conjure up some princely clothes for him to wear.
    
    **Harvey:** I couldn't vanquish the troll wearing pants?
    
    -   Alluded to in a season 7 episode where Sabrina turns into a literal Bridezilla (due to her obsession with having the perfect fairy tale wedding). Salem says that the only way to cure her is for a prince to slay her. In this case it's her fiancée Aaron telling her off for some of her crazy wedding ideas.
-   Prince Charming is a character in _Sesame Street_, using the same puppet as Guy Smiley and Don Music, who can be relied upon to totally mess up any fairy-tale he's involved in (he's not a Prince Charmless, just incompetent and not very bright). He also works as a dance instructor, under the name Prince Cha-Cha-Charming.

-   Played straight in the _Veronica Mars_ episode "Ain't No Magic Mountain High Enough" where Logan meets Hannah who he says is "like the hot daughter of a king he marries off to get like Denmark or something."
-   Used in the finale of _The Worst Witch_ TV series. Mildred discovers that her drawings can come to life - which comes in handy when the other girls summon the Wicked Witch from Sleeping Beauty by accident. Mildred makes her drawing of Prince Percy come to life - and his kiss wakes everyone up from their sleep. Note that this is _individual_ kisses we're talking about; it's implied that he has to kiss the whole school.
    -   The Christmas Episode also featured a pantomime of _Cinderella_. Drusilla was originally cast as the prince - but after some meddling from her and Ethel, they put Charlie in the role. Fitting since Mildred is Cinderella and he's her sometimes love interest.
-   _The White Queen_: Played straight with Richard of Gloucester when he's a young man, who is a royal duke and the brother of a king, plus he's brave, chivalrous, gentle and romantic. He has a Rescue Romance with Anne Neville, a Damsel in Distress whom he saves twice. The first occurs when he fights off soldiers (and plays the part of a Knight in Shining Armor while doing so) who are about to gang-rape her, <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and the second is when he offers her a way to escape George of Clarence's guardianship, as she's a prisoner in the latter's residence. After Richard proposes marriage to Anne in a Garden of Love / Snow Means Love setting, he confesses the love that he has harboured for her since childhood, and they seal their engagement with a True Love's Kiss. They are Happily Married along with Babies Ever After. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

    Music 

-   Adam and the Ants have a song called "Prince Charming" on their album _Prince Charming_ (1981).
-   Megan and Liz’s song “Princess Charming.”

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Magic: The Gathering_ has the card Charming Prince, whose basis on this trope is in the name. He can help players live Happily Ever After (Scry 2, letting them potentially get rid of bad cards on top of their deck so they draw good ones sooner), can heal them with a True Love's Kiss (giving them 3 life), or whisk them off on a magical evening (temporarily exiling a creature, keeping it safe from dangerous effects). His name, however, is also a pun to MTG fans: "Charms" are spells in Magic that let players choose between one of three small effects, and the Charming Prince lets the players choose between three small effects when he's played.

    Theater 

-   _Cinderella (Lloyd Webber)_: Prince Charming is the favored son and heir of the queen, a handsome and strapping young land adored throughout the land. However, he's now vanished and the Spare to the Throne is seen as a lame nerd in comparison.
-   _Into the Woods_ actually has _two_ examples: there are two Prince Charmings, married to Cinderella and Rapunzel, respectively. In the second act, they abandon their wives for Snow White and Sleeping Beauty.
    
    "I was raised to be charming, not sincere." - Cinderella's Prince
    
-   _Tsukino Empire - Unleash your mind -_ has Shun as the second prince of the empire. He certainly is charming, enough to win over Kai to being his knight upon their first meeting. The twins from the fourth fleet are also dazzled by him.

    Video Games 

-   Prince Dimitri of _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_ is an interesting play on this trope. He comes off as a classic example—sincere, sweet, cheerful, and even boyish at times. His looks are also fairly archetypical of a fairy tale prince with blonde hair, big blue doe eyes, and soft features. While he is genuinely good-natured, it's to the point that he's had a thirst for vengeance and violence after childhood trauma, and his pristine character is a mask he wears. After the timeskip of his Blue Lions route, he's allowed himself to become He Who Fights Monsters, and prioritizes his revenge over his kingdom.
-   Despite his infernal mode of dress, Prince Zagreus of _Hades_ is handsome, generous, soft-spoken (if snarky), and friendly enough that it's easy to forget it's _Hell_ he's prince of. Good thing Dark Is Not Evil.
-   Alexander of Daventry pulls this off rather nicely, especially in _King's Quest VI_. It's given a bit of a Deconstruction in _The Kings Quest Companion_, though. Because he spent so long as a slave, he still thinks of himself as "Gwydion." The persona of "Alexander" is like a mask or a cloak to him.
-   _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_ has Prince Sidon of the Zora. A handsome and extroverted Nice Guy, he is famous as a Warrior Prince who once took down a giant Octorok and also helps Link fight Divine Beast Vah Ruta. He's also a Chick Magnet among the Zora women, to the point that one female Zora soldier has even organized a fan club where the ladies can collectively swoon over him.
    
    **Tula:** Ah... Mmm... Prince Sidon... Just thinking of you turns me to mush...
    
-   The game _100 Sleeping Princes and the Kingdom of Dreams_ relies on the lasting appeal of this trope. It's a Bishounen-collecting puzzle game featuring actually well over a hundred princes with varying styles of charm, but all of them are meant, first and foremost, to be attractive.
-   _Psychonauts's_ official Psycho-Pedia has this to say about Lili's view of Raz:

    Visual Novels 

-   Prince Lucas Charming IV from _Ever After Academy_ is a rare example of this being played completely straight, being noble, brave, kind, and a good leader.

    Webcomics 

-   _Girl Genius_:
    -   Gil is a kind of reconstruction. The Prince Charming has often been deconstructed by making him (the heir of) a tyrant or dictator. But Gil is very good at arguing his father is the most enlightened despot in the continent, and he's probably right. Gil is also a handsome warrior who always saves the girl; he just fails for the romantic side.
    -   Another sort of reconstruction is Gil's rival Tarvek Sturmvoraus (though he's a prince of a principality instead of a king's son). He grew up in a Decadent Court and had to be an ambitious schemer to even _survive,_ but his love interest Agatha ended up becoming his romantic Morality Chain, and in turn he gave her the know-how to survive the whole "lost heir" thing.
-   _No Rest for the Wicked_ has Prince Ricardo, aka "Picky Dicky." He's great with heroics, but insists on only marrying the _best_ princess in the world, and has subsequently insulted just about every other in his search. His Establishing Character Moment has him getting through the vines surrounding Sleeping Beauty's castle, which have claimed countless other men, leaning in to kiss her...and then leaving in disgust when it turns out that she wheezes in her sleep.
-   In _Sinfest_, is displeased with Happily Ever After so she declares Prince Charming really cheated on her so she killed him in his sleep.

-   _Adventure Time_: Prince Gumball from the gender-swapped episodes seems to be this (At least for what can be seen in his only two apparitions in the series) There is also Prince Huge from the episode "The Hard Easy"
-   _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_: "Frankie, My Dear" has a Prince Charming imaginary friend. He is indeed handsome, charming, romantic—and smitten with Frankie Foster. Frankie tells him that she outgrew his type years ago, but don't worry, Friends like him get snatched up by little girls in no time.
-   _I Am Weasel_: In "The Fairy Godfather", there is a Princess Charming.

    -   _My Little Pony: Rescue at Midnight Castle_: At the end, Scorpan is revealed to be a charming human prince whom Tirac turned into a monster.
    -   A named-as-such Prince Charming appears in "Through the Door" among the legendary figures released from behind the Golden Door. He serves as the archetypal fairytale love interest and, like all other legendary figures, he's a living archetype effectively limited to living out his narrative role. In his case, this boils down to professing eternal love and devotion to anything that moves.
