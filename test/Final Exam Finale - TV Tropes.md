When a work's finale serves as an encapsulated version of all the events that came before it. They may appear in a different context this time, but somehow or other, every single part of the succession of continuity nods moves the finale's story along in a way that's very much like a Plot Tailored to the Party. This can manifest itself in the form of Gondor Calls for Aid and the Combined Energy Attack during a Grand Finale, but it's not uncommon in shows that have a lower key setting than epic battles.

This one may have originated in Fairy Tales. The equivalent video game tropes are All the Worlds Are a Stage and Final-Exam Boss.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime and Manga 

-   The finale of _High School Girls_ has every element that appeared in past episodes return during the School Festival in some form or another.
-   _Maria†Holic_, through a series of increasingly goofy circumstances, plays this out as Kanako attempts to get to the school pool.
-   _Special A_ makes use of everything the Special A class can do in the finale, one after the other.
-   In _Persona 4: The Animation_, episode 12 (the mid season finale) has the entire team needing to work together, and Yu needs to unleash all the Arcana he's gathered over the past 11 episodes to take down Shadow Mitsuo.
-   In the Grand Finale of _Digimon Adventure 02_, the first part of the final battle takes place in an alternate dimension where wishes come true. The Digidestined used this to manifest _every_ form their partner digimon had gained during the series to fight MaloMyotismon. And it was _very_ impressive.
    -   Before this, in the original _Digimon Adventure_, Apocalymon could use every power that the previous Arc Villains such as Devimon or Etemon could, his design was a mashup of all their forms, and the final fight against him had him summon copies of them to use many of their signature moves.
-   _Holyland_: The fight with King, while not technically the final fight, demands Yuu bring to bear everything he learned throughout the series.
-   Used in the first season finale for _Aldnoah.Zero_, in the form of Count Saazbaum and his Martian Kataphrakt, the Dioscuria. It utilizes the distinct weapons of the three previous Martian Kataphrakts seen in the show, carrying the void barrier of Trillram's Nilokeras, the plasma sword of Vlad's Argyre, and the rocket-propelled fists of Femieanne's Hellas.
-   The second term finals are literally this in _Assassination Classroom_, though they aren't the end of the series. But it's The Final Question that properly fits the definition of the trope for Karma and Gakushuu. Aside from having proper Final Boss cred for being an insanely difficult math problem (when the internet got a hold of a translation of the question, the general consensus was that it was college-level geometry), Karma's solution involves him thinking through much of his Character Development over the course of the series. And for Gakushuu, his approach betrays his lack of growth over the series, and he fails to find the answer in time.

    Fan Works 

-   For the climax of _How Friendship Accidentally Saved Magical Britain_, the main student characters pull out all the stops and throw literally everything they've learned and created over the course of the story at Voldemort, from invented hexes and prototype joke products, to Fred's newly discovered "casting through walls" technique and Tom's love of muggle firearms.

    Film 

-   _Avengers: Endgame_: The survivors of Thanos's decimation reunite five years after the events of _Infinity War_ to travel in time and gather the Infinity Stones in order to undo the disappearance of half the population in the universe. The time travel has them return to events and situations that happened in (or are related to in some other way) several of the previous films across the first three phases of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
-   Although it's a film, rather than a series, _Kung Fu Panda_ uses this for its climax, with Po's fight with Big Bad Tai Lung involving everything he's learned throughout the film — both martial arts, and more... unusual skills for combat.
-   The big closing number of _The Muppet Movie_ recreates Kermit's journey on an obvious movie set. Which then blows up, because this is the Muppets.
-   The big race at the end of _Cars_ has Lightning using everything he has learned (Mater taught him how to drive backwards, Doc taught him how to drift, and The King's crash led him to recall Doc's own fate).

    Literature 

-   Very obvious in _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_, which seems determined to revisit _everything_ that has _ever_ happened in the series continuity.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _FETCH! with Ruff Ruffman_ uses elements from previous challenges in the season finales, leading to a _literal_ Final Exam Finale as the next-to-last challenge.
-   _The Amazing Race_: Several finales have involved a final puzzle that included remembering location and tasks from all the previous legs.
    -   Season 3's finale included a totem pole that contained animal faces. The player had to correctly align up the five animals that had been featured in the different episodes.
    -   Season 5's finale included a task where players needed to search a maze for 4 boxes containing pictures of different locations that they visited. After aligning them in the correct order, the teams could continue.
    -   Season 8 contained an exam for the 2nd and 3rd place teams. They were able to complete a task where they received cards detailing tasks during the race and they had to place them in the correct order on a map for the lesser prize.
    -   Season 9's finale had a Roadblock (a task only one player per team can complete) where he or she had to find 9 specific of 285 flags detailing the countries they visited. After that, the player had to arrange the flags in order by which country they visited. Seen here.
    -   Season 12 had one of the most difficult tasks where the player had to select 10 items from 15 and place them on a stage. There were also two requirements that had to be met:
        -   First, no two items could be from the same Leg (episode). While there were 15 items, there were only eleven Legs and therefore could create difficulty given how there were many different combinations.
        -   Second, the items chosen needed to follow a checklist: Three animals and/or animal by-products, One item being from a U-Turn during the game, Three items located at or brought to the Pit Stops, Two items of transportation requiring wheels (one of these had to have been used at a Detour), and One item of transportation resembling a stick.
    -   Season 13's challenge required players to reveal a sign from each of their 10 Legs (episodes). Each picture, being a Roadblock, Detour, Route Info, or Pit Stop. After knowing what they needed, the player would search 150 boxes for a picture of the related question. Once each picture was entered into the answer slot, a green light would prompt the next question.
    -   Season 14 contained a Challenge near the final moments where the player needed to search 300 surfboards for boards depicting "a task, location, or person" from each of the episodes prior (two boards were from the "Double Leg" which spanned two episodes). Once all 11 boards were placed in order, the players could continue the race.
    -   Season 16 required players to carry a trunk through downtown San Francisco to a bar, then place psychedelic posters of the teams in the order of elimination, including teams that had arrived last on non-elimination legs.
    -   Season 17 required players to face a wall of all of the Race Pit Stop greeters from seasons 1 through 17 and place them in the order in which the racers saw them, identifying them by their hats.
    -   Season 19 required one team member to use a rope while being hoisted in the air to trace the route they had taken. Because many teams in the past took extensive notes throughout the race, a rule was set in place in which the players could not use notes.
    -   Season 21: Teams had to hoist flags in which the words Hello and Goodbye up by the countries' respective flags.
    -   Season 22: Teams had to have one team member jump into a container of balloon globes and find specific globes marked with a country in which they had visited, while the other team member took the globes and placed them in the order in which they were visited.
    -   Season 23: Required teams to assemble totem poles that had the names of the currencies of the countries that were visited and place them in order.
    -   Season 25: One team member was required to navigate a maze of thousands of shipping containers while memorizing numbers in the order of the places they visited, all without taking notes, which wasn't allowed in the instructions.
    -   Season 26: Teams have arrange their selfie pictures in the correct order of the places they've been.
    -   Season 27 contains three memory challenges.
        -   First, team members who performed the fire rescue Roadblock will arrange the firefighter helmets that displays the name of the capital cities of the countries they've been in the correct order. However, two of the firefighter helmets are not capital cities.
        -   Second, teams must attach country flags on the rope in the correct chronological order.
        -   Third, teams must build beach chairs and each chair contains a picture of a significant person, place, or thing that represents the places they've been. But in addition to arranging the chairs in the correct order, the chairs had to be built properly
    -   Season 28: One racer from each team would have to use barrel lids in a winefield with letters on them to spell out hashtags used in their clues throughout the season.
    -   Season 29: Teams would have to post their placements each leg on the scoreboard at Wrigley Stadium then use their placements from 3 legs to spell out the chair number their clue is hidden under.
    -   Season 30: Racers would have to search through an aircraft carrier to find large pieces of a model plane each with 2 pictures of objects on legs. They would then have to assemble the model plane to find the correct combination of 6 pieces so that each leg has a picture on the plane.
    -   Season 33: Teams had to answer questions related to the race before running to the finish line.
    -   Season 34: Teams would play a giant piano whose keys when played displayed a picture, with some being things or places they saw during the race and they had to play the keys in the order they appeared. Appropriately enough, the correct sequence would play the show's theme song.
-   Done quite literally in _The Mole_ — the finale of each season has a quiz on everything that has happened over the course of the season, particularly details from the various challenges that the contestants have faced, with the jackpot going to the player who answers the most questions correctly.

-   _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_ was basically about Ocelot harnessing the power of Continuity Porn to save the world.
-   Used as one of the few genuinely clever design ideas in _Painkiller Overdose_: The movie studio level includes movie sets themed after the previous levels in the game, featuring cardboard cut-out versions of the past levels' enemies.
