Trampolines are usually viewed as fun places to play in the backyard. They're used for recreation, a practice ground for gymnasts, skiers, and cheerleaders, and a guaranteed submission to America's Funniest Home Videos. Sometimes, however, in both Real Life and fiction, trampolines are used for a much more serious purpose. These fall into two main categories: a character is depressed and tries to commit suicide, or a character is in peril and needs to jump to safety.

See also Interrupted Suicide and Heroic Fire Rescue. In a comic setting, can be subverted with The Not Catch.

-   Subverted in a commercial for Glad garbage bags. A piano breaks loose from the rope used to pull it up to a third-story window. Two workers use a Glad bag to make a fireman's trampoline. The piano completely misses, it breaks into a hundred pieces, and the workers use the trash bag to deliver the pieces to the piano's owner.

-   _Kiki's Delivery Service_ has a charming use of this trope at the end of the film. After Kiki saves Tombo, firefighters rush a safety tramp below the kids as they slowly descend, just as a safety precaution considering the weight Kiki had to manage with her flight power.

    Framed in the second-story winder of a burnin' buildin' happeared a 'uman 'ead!  
    "Just jump into this net wot we are 'oldin' and you'll be quite orl right."  
    But 'e didn't jump, and the flames rose 'igher and 'igher and 'igher, gawd!  
    Framed in the third-story winder of a burnin' buildin' happeared a 'uman 'ead!  
    "Just jump into this net wot we are 'oldin' and you'll be quite orl right, honest!"  
    So 'e jumped. And 'e broke 'is bloomin' neck!

-   Used by Screwy Squirrel in one of his cartoons. At the last second he pulls it away, because that's just the way he is.
-   _Mao Mao: Heroes of Pure Heart_: Mao Mao, Badgerclops and Adorabat try to use one to catch Sweety Pie, Slim Pigguns from a burning building that he was too oblivious to realize he was in danger from. Just to make it more frustrating, the trio were currently not on speaking terms and refusing to speak at all and couldn't convey for him to jump into the net. Suffice to say, he lands _next_ to the net.
-   _Phineas and Ferb_, "One Good Scare Ought to Do It!": The Fireside Girls save Phineas in this manner with an improvised trampoline made from their sashes when he falls out of the haunted house being lifted into the air.

    Real Life 

-   Life nets used to be standard equipment for fire rescues with a usual upper jump height limit of six storeys, although eight storey jumps have been noted. However, the life net was phased out by the 1980s since it was too dangerous with a real risk of jumpers landing on the hard rim or a firefighter holding it up or worse, missing the net altogether. Today, aerial apparatus fire trucks are used instead since they enable firefighters to simply reach up to victims to get them down.
