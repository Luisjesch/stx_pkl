Hey, it's better than losing the real one.

_"Your prosthetic arm just saved your life."_

This character has Artificial Limbs, Electronic Eyes or other prostheses, and while they don't have to be a full Cyborg — the rest of them can just be squishy human flesh — what they do have is far stronger, more durable and just plain better than their former body part (if it existed). There's only one problem: it keeps getting wrecked. Enemies shoot like there's a bullseye on it, falling rocks gravitate towards it and it falls off at the drop of a hat like the character is some Steampunk leper. Meanwhile, their natural appendages never suffer more than flesh wounds, despite being made of far less hardy stuff.

Often Fake Arm Disarms are used to temporarily bring a character down to normal in a way that preserves the status quo. Destroying the flesh-and-blood arm of a character would gravely injure them and provoke major Character Development, but a prosthesis can be broken or detached without endangering the character and fixed with relative ease after the fight. It's also a popular means of including some Bloodless Carnage and Amusing Injuries for similar reasons.

On the other hand, the character can also Invoke the trope in order to protect their less replaceable limbs by leaving the prosthesis behind as a decoy while they escape. May also come in handy during a Life-or-Limb Decision.

Frequently Justified, as realistic prostheses are usually weaker than the body parts they replace and detachable, making them easy to lose. Also, the strength of Artificial Limbs could make a character be more reckless with it, as dumber ones might not realize that if they tried lifting something really heavy with said fake arm without reinforcing practically every other part of the body the prosthetic would be ripped out. And a weaponized prosthesis would be an obvious target for enemies.

May follow an I Will Tear Your Arms Off threat. Compare to the bloodier An Arm and a Leg. For a list of tropes that are prone to these, see Artificial Limbs and Anatomy Arsenal.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Berserk_, Guts's iron prosthetic left hand and forearm invert the trope by being far more damage-resistant than the rest of his body, a fact which he often exploits. One example is a Deliberate Injury Gambit during his fight with Rosine's giant moth form, where he crosses his arms in front of him to defend against Rosine's diving attack with her sharp proboscis. He lets the proboscis skewer his flesh-and-blood right forearm while using the iron left forearm directly behind it to divert the point away from his head, so that his impaled right arm drags him with her into the sky. He couldn't land a hit on her before because she kept knocking him off his feet and zooming past before he could hit her back, but stuck to her like this he's able to shoot her with the Arm Cannon built into his prosthetic.
-   _Elfen Lied_: Nana's artificial limbs have a bad habit of popping off. Bando also shatters one of his artificial arms when he fires a 50-caliber bullet one-handed.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_:
    -   Edward's automail arm is destroyed or heavily damaged on five separate occasions. It is destroyed by Scar; it malfunctions while Ed fights Lust and Envy due to a missing screw from Winry's rushed repairs; it is damaged and used as bait during his fight with Lan Fan; it is unable to function in the North due to the cold; and it is destroyed by Father after which he gets his real arm back. It's justified due to his tendency to parry attacks (and only parry attacks) with that arm, since it's so much more durable than his flesh-and-blood one. To say nothing of it being more replaceable, as Ed well knows. Losing his automail arm is an annoying inconvenience, but losing his flesh-and-blood arm would put him out of action for a year or more (as was the case when he lost his other arm and had to get it replaced with a prosthetic before the start of the story).
    -   Also occurs when Scar fights the Silver Alchemist. After trading a few blows, Scar destroys the Silver Alchemist's pegleg with a Clean Cut, Single-Stroke Battle style.
-   Happens _all the time_ in _Ghost in the Shell: Arise_. Pretty much every hand-to-hand fight Motoko gets into will involve at least one of these. For example, during the climactic Car Chase/battle of "Ghost Whispers", VV loses her right arm, Motoko loses her right arm, and Batou loses an arm and a leg.
-   _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_ provides a few examples:
    -   An assassin named Fem is hired by the South Seas Mafia to kill a multi-millionaire recluse. Section 9 stays one step ahead of her. While she monologues about the evils of capitalism, Motoko exploits it and sneaks up behind her. Before Fem can put up a proper defense with the shotgun built into her arm, Motoko twists her arm and breaks it off.
    -   The Russian spy Cruzkowa has been doing her job for so long, that she's Crazy-Prepared for almost any situation. When Togusa grabs her left hand while she was running away, her arm came off. Batou has to tell Togusa to throw the damn thing away before the bomb inside exploded.
    -   Batou enters hand to hand combat with Kuze later on in the 2nd season. The two are pretty evenly matched against each other; Kuze gets the upper hand when Batou tries to swing a metal shaft at him but gets knocked off balance. Kuze shoves the metal shaft into Batou's left shoulder, pinning him to the ground. Batou was ok, but he later remarked that it was annoying trying to get used to his replacement shoulder and arm.
-   Several examples among the Yato in _Gintama_: lampshaded by Abuto during the Shogun Assassination Arc when Momochi's puppet blows up while he's holding it, destroying his prosthetic arm ("What do all of you have against my left arm?!") and Umibozu loses his at the start of his fight with Utsuro during the Battle on Rakuyo Arc.
-   Averted by Private Nikaidou in _Golden Kamuy_, who constantly loses new body parts throughout the series while his prosthetics stay in fairly good shape.
-   Happens a couple times to Joseph Joestar in _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders_. His prosthetic hand gets destroyed in the fight against the Empress stand, then sliced off at the start of the High Priestess fight.
-   Obito of _Naruto_ has a right arm created from cloned Zetsu tissue and capable of regenerating after being destroyed. Said arm is destroyed on three occasions, once by an enemy attack, once by Obito himself after another enemy attack infected the arm with a deadly toxin and once when it was too weak when he punched a boulder.
-   _Touhou Sangetsusei_: This happens to Kasen near the end of _Oriental and Sacred Place_ when she finds one of Reimu's Yin-Yang Orbs and ends up touching it with her bandaged arm. Merely touching its surface destroys her fake arm, revealing there's nothing beneath the bandages but black mist.
-   In the climactic chapter of _Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-_, Kurogane's fake arm gets shattered while he's attempting an attack on the Big Bad. Earlier in the story we actually saw him lose the original by cutting it off himself to save Fay from a closing dimension, and it was not pretty.

    Comic Books

The bodyguard (not aware that Starr has a prosthetic as Starr only recently lost his real leg) contemptuously grabs the "kick" in the air, only for the prosthetic leg to pop off in his hand. He stares at it in shock just long enough for Starr to shoot him.
-   _Robin (1993)_: Johnny replaces his missing hand with a hook, which Tim then targets in their next fight as it makes a dangerous weapon when attached to a Torture Technician.
