I _tried_ squinting. I still only see a vase!

A stock pose seen in cartoon openings, movie posters, video game box art, comics covers, paintings, this is a shot that pits two teams against each other on opposite sides of the screen. It can be a massive group shot, featuring all the series's heroes and villains, or show just two characters— all that matters is that the two sides are facing each other and look ready to strike.

Usually the left and right side are evenly balanced and evenly matched. The characters across from one another tend to be counterparts and are often mimicking the other side's pose, and suggesting Counterpart Combat Coordination.

This trope can be used for thematic reasons, to emphasize how the characters aren't so different and the villain is the dark mirror of the other, but it's just as likely to be a dynamic version of the Team Shot with villainy added for spice.

A variant often seen in fight scenes involves a stationary long shot framing two groups running at each other into combat, often one-on-one as a Counterpart Combat Coordination. Usually they don't start fighting all at once, rather, it starts in the back or front of the line and moves to the other side from there.

Compare Juxtaposed Halves Shot (where half of two characters' sides/faces are juxtaposed to or beside each other), Fearful Symmetry (where both characters involved are usually shown in profile in an ongoing Blade Lock), and Versus Character Splash (where two characters' faces are briefly shown in a Splash Screen as a prelude to a battle in a Fighting Game).

    Anime & Manga 

-   _One Piece_:
    -   The manga does an interesting take on this. The cover for volume 21, "Utopia", has the remainder of the Baroque Works' agents (Mr. 0/Crocodile, Miss All Sunday/Nico Robin, Mr. 1/Daz Bones, Miss Doublefinger, Mr. 2/Bon Clay, Mr. 4, and Miss Merry Christmas) lined up and looking right, and volume 22, "Hope!", has the Straw Hats and allies (Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, Nami, Usopp, Chopper, Vivi, Karoo, and Eyelashes) the same way, looking _left_. When the two covers are combined, (21-22) the result is a Mirrored Confrontation Shot. Later on in the anime, this same shot was used when Ivankov talks about the Alabasta incident to Bon Clay.
    -   The cover art for the DVD version of _Episode 0_ does a more classic version, between Luffy and Shiki.
-   The cover of Volume 15 of _Naruto_ Has Naruto and Gaara both crouching/facing each other while each holding and object to further mirror each other (Sand Gourd for Gaara and the summoning contract for Naruto) Behind them there's also a Juxtaposed Halves Shot of Shukaku (Gaara's side) and Gamabunta (Naruto's side).
-   The latest intro (Season four) of _Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds_ has Jack, Yusei and Crow against the Infinity Trio.
    -   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ LOVES this trope. It can be seen in MANY times throughout various openings and clips in the second anime series, GX, and even 5D's. It's a typical closing frame for any time a duel with the season's Big Bad is about to start.
-   In _Monster_, Johan's "scenery of the end" is a shot of him and Tenma facing off, with the rest of the world literally removed from the picture. That their poses are not mirrored is an obvious thematic choice.
-   _Reborn! (2004)_ uses this trope about twice. First against the Varia, and then the Milliefiore.
-   The opening for _Fresh Pretty Cure!_ had, at one point near the end, one of these<small>◊</small> with the initial three heroines at the right and the initial Labyrinth trio at the left. After Setsuna's Heel–Face Turn, it changes so she is located at the other side with the Cures, with her spot in the original shot filled in by Norza.
-   _Pokémon: The Series_
    -   A recurring occurence during matches, where the scene will cut to a view showing a shot (like this one<small>◊</small>) with both Trainers facing and glaring at each other.
    -   The first opening theme for _Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl_ features Ash and The Rival Paul with their respective teams; before the opening changed to reflect the events of future episodes, it is symmetrical (in a sense): they both have a Flying-type, an Electric-type, and a primate-based Pokémon.
-   _Digimon Xros Wars: The Young Hunters Who Leapt Through Time_ has it in the opening, with Team Xros Heart facing off against their rival team of Hunters.
-   In _Planetes_, the secondary characters are presented like this, first a group on the left side and then another on the right side, their positions expanding outwards in an accordion-like fashion. It's interesting because both groups have friendly, or at least neutral but supportive characters, but those in the first group tend towards a more antagonistic streak —and, due to the nature of the Evolving Credits, some members of this first group will eventually shift into the uniforms belonging to their Heel–Face Turn status.
-   _Black★Rock Shooter_ had this in the show itself between Insane Black★Rock Shooter and Strength.<small>◊</small>
-   _Brave Beats_ features one between Choreo and Flash Beat in the opening sequence.
-   The poster for _Izetta: The Last Witch_ has this between Bergman and Fine<small>◊</small> with the eponymous character Izetta in the middle.
-   _DEVILMAN crybaby_ has this in the opening theme, between Ryo and Akira.
-   Most of the _Record of Ragnarok_ covers are like this, depicting the fighters who face each other in the volume, typically only changing it up if the fight lasts longer than a single volume.

    Asian Animation 

-   _BoBoiBoy_: One of BoBoiBoy's team staring down Fang and Adu Du's team appears in Season 2 episode 4, before their big football game begins.
-   A number of the various _Flower Fairy_ openings feature a shot of the good fairies looking confrontingly at the the evil fairies, the good ones on the left and the evil ones on the right.

    Comic Books 

-   Lots of comics covers (such as this one for _Impulse<small>◊</small>_)
    -   Also the cover of _Teen Titans #52_
-   Happens a few times in Marvel's _Civil War_, like here and here.
-   Several covers for the various Marvel/DC crossovers, such as this one.<small>◊</small>
-   The cover<small>◊</small> for the _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Meet the Conservation Corps_ comic shows a confrontation between the four turtles and four members of the Corps.
-   _The Avengers_ are fond of this. In their first 200 issues, they used it for the cover of #s 15,<small>◊</small> 53,<small>◊</small> 70,<small>◊</small> 130<small>◊</small> and 141.<small>◊</small> In later years, it was usually used as an homage to the early covers, including _X-Statix_ #21,<small>◊</small> which started a Let's You and Him Fight storyline with the Avengers.
    -   In fact, if _any_ comic cover features two teams facing off/charging at each other across an otherwise blank scene, the artist's probably thinking of _Avengers_ #s 130 and 141. That includes the _Marvel/DC_ and _Titans_ covers above
-   Another particularly iconic example is X-Men #100,<small>◊</small> which shows the All-New X-Men facing off against the original X-Men (supposedly).
-   _Thunderbolts_ #172, part of a Time Travel storyline, shows the current 'Bolts confronting the originals. Including Karla "Moonstone" Sofen and Norbert "Fixer" Endersol charging at Karla "Meteorite" Sofen and Norbert "Techno" Endersol, respectively.
    -   #3 features the original Thunderbolts (secretly the Masters of Evil) facing off against the new Masters of Evil.
-   The _Fantastic Four_ once fought the members of the "New" Fantastic Four, a team consisting of Spider-Man, Wolverine, The Incredible Hulk, and Ghost Rider. The issue in question depicted the two teams squaring off in this manner.
-   The cover of the penultimate issue of _Avengers Academy_ shows the Academy kids facing down the Jean Grey School kids. On a football field.
-   _Spectacular Spider-Man_ #226, the infamous issue of _The Clone Saga_ where it was revealed that Ben was supposedly the real deal and Peter Parker was the clone, used this for its cover. It can be seen in the page image for the storyline.
-   The cover to "Sonic Super Special #1" AKA "Battle Royal," shows Sonic and the Freedom Fighters facing off against Knuckles and the Chaotix.
-   _Black Moon Chronicles_: The cover of album 13, _The Prophecy_, shows Wismerhill and Hazheel Thorn staring each other down with (literally) burning eyes.
-   _Ultimate Wolverine_: Jimmy had one with both Wildchild and Quicksilver.

    Fan Works 

-   _Ebott's Wake_ has a textual version at the beginning when Dr. Aster reflexively summons an Aster Blaster as Sans bridges up to the cave:
    
    A part of \[Dr. Aster's\] mind, standing off to the side like am impartial observer or referee, noted that there was an appealing symmetry to the situation; on each side, a skeleton and two blasters.
    

    Films — Animated 

-   An official piece of artwork for _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf: The Super Adventure_ features Weslie and an army of White Kingdom bacteria soldiers staring at Wolffy and an army of Black Kingdom bacteria soldiers, clearly intent on fighting each other.
-   Moses and Pharaoh Rameses during the song "The Plagues" from _The Prince of Egypt_. The sequence is done rather symbolically. During the song, both Moses and Rameses sing about how they saw each other as brothers and how none of them wanted the plagues to happen. Near the end of the song, their faces do a Juxtaposed Halves Shot. Then their faces rotate apart so that they are facing each other, signifying that whatever bond they had is now permanently broken.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The DVD Cover to _Cats & Dogs_.
-   _Anger Management_
-   The poster for<small>◊</small> _Bride Wars_.
-   The poster for<small>◊</small> _Lone Wolf McQuade_, featuring everybody's favorite Chuck Norris.

-   _Harry Potter_
    -   The _Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince_ movie has a poster like this, with Harry and the good guys on one side, and Voldemort and his Death Eaters on the other, charging. Which is especially funny, considering magic can't generally be considered a close-contact type of attack.
    -   Another poster<small>◊</small> for _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2_.
-   The _Deathly Hallows_ poster is parodied by one of the teasers for<small>◊</small> _The Hangover Pt 3_.

-   The poster<small>◊</small> for _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_ shows Batman and Superman standing against each other.

-   The poster<small>◊</small> for _Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising_ parodies _Captain America: Civil War_.
-   A literal example of this occurs in the final showdown between Bond and Blofeld in _Spectre_. To drive this even further, Blofeld even serves as a warped mirror version and Evil Counterpart of 007, showcasing the visual similarities between the two, if anybody looks closer.
-   _Creed II_ has Adonis and Rocky against Viktor and Ivan Drago on its teaser poster.

-   The PSP theme for _Dissidia Final Fantasy_ (and presumably the box-art) uses this, with all the heroes on the right, villains on the left. (Link.<small>◊</small>)
    -   The box-art is a little different: The standard side is all the characters from the Cosmos side facing left. Removing the box-art and flipping it over displays all the characters from the Chaos side facing right. Even the screenshots are mirrored: the Cosmos side shows Cloud preparing to strike, the Chaos side shows Sephiroth preparing to strike.

-   The Japanese and European cover art<small>◊</small> of _Persona 3: FES_ does this with the main characters on the right side, and their corresponding Personas facing them from the left. It's a particularly brilliant shot because at first glance it looks like a bunch of heroic high-schoolers facing off against gruesome, godlike monsters, when in reality it's a _literal_ mirror showing the two sides of the same person.
-   The promotional image of _Shin Megami Tensei IMAGINE_ seen as the header for the main _Shin Megami Tensei_ trope page, with angels and Messians standing on one side, devils and Gaians on the other, and the player caught in the exact middle.

-   _Metroid Prime 2: Echoes_ has it<small>◊</small> twice<small>◊</small> before boss battles with Dark Samus.

    Webcomics 

    Web Original 

-   There is a least one shot of the Nostalgia Critic and the Angry Video Game Nerd doing this, in cartoon form.
-   The Great Showdowns Tumblr blog features cute pictures of heroes and villains from movies facing each other, accompanied by a quote, but not the titles of the movies pictured.
-   The title cards for Atop the Fourth Wall occasionally do this, though not as often as you might think, considering that some of the comics Linkara has reviewed have featured this trope on their covers. Two cases in particular mirror each other, though - the cards for _Youngblood_ #3 and _Doctor Who Classics_ #7 mirror _each other_, being back-to-back storyline episodes, with Linkara and Lord Vyce facing each other with crossed arms, on opposite sides. Shaft and the Fifth Doctor's presence in each is incidental (and basically only to tie the cards in to the content actually being reviewed, of course).
-   In Freshy Kanal's "Bakugo vs. Inosuke" rap battle, the final scene is a series of increasingly closed-up shots of Bakugo on the left and Inosuke on the right facing and jumping towards each other with weapons ready.

    Western Animation

-   _Ninjago_: In "Powerless", the ninja are fighting to get the Dangerous Forbidden Technique scroll at the museum before an evil Snake Woman named Aspheera does. The scroll ends up in the middle of the room and the ensuing shot has each side running to the middle of the room, with each of the ninja fighting Aspheera or one of her giant fire snake creatures.
-   The end of the 90s _X-Men: The Animated Series_ opening shows Professor Xavier and his X-Men on one side, with Magneto and the show's villains on the other.
-   _Xiaolin Showdown_'s intro.
-   The cover for _"Challenge of the Superfriends"_. The opening titles ended with both sides charging into each other, causing an explosion that produced the series title.
-   The final shot of the _Justice League Unlimited_ episode "Grudge Match" has Black Canary and Huntress facing each other before they begin their fight.
    -   "Secret Society" also features a shot, with the Justice League on one side and Gorilla Gordd's Secret Society on the other, right before they come to blows.

-   This promotional artwork for _Transformers: Animated_.
-   _Darkwing Duck_ two-parter "Just us Justice Ducks" eventually leads to a confrontation between the newly-formed Justice Ducks and the Fearsome Five in these exact positions complete with western music playing in the background.
-   _OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes_ has one of these for its opening sequence.
-   _Pibby_: Near the end of the trailer, there's a shot depicting Pibby leading an army of uncorrupted cartoon characters against the Eldritch Abomination antagonist, each at opposite ends of the screen. (Driving the dichotomy home, the heroes have a moon on their side while the antagonist has a sun.)
