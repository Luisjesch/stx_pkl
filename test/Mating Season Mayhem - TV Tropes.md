_"As a young fela I scorned the young males in our tribe—they were overbold and self-satisfied. When I came into my season I made sure to be far away from the clan, so I would not be betrayed by nature into bearing a litter that I did not yet desire. I found that I_ enjoyed _being by myself; enjoyed the solitary way of the hunter."_

Many animals have a mating season or an estrous cycle (referred as "going into heat"). Depending on the animal, this can be very messy, smelly, noisy, or (especially when it comes to males in rut) dangerous.

In fiction, mating seasons and estrous cycles are presented as a hindrance to characters. How this is presented depends on whether the character is the one in season or not.

Usually, this trope occurs for dog or cat owners during heat cycles. It's usually depicted as their female pet having gone into heat. The owner doesn't know how to deal with the mess, smell, and/or noise of an animal in heat. If they have a male pet, they'll have to quarantine them. Even if they _don't_ have a male pet, a common gag is male animals (usually stray or free-roaming cats) hanging around their house. Sometimes this occurs with owners of tomcats, where the joke is instead that their cat is always roaming around and looking for mates.

This trope can also appear for animal or animal-like characters, ranging from Partially Civilized Animals, humanoids with animal characteristics, or aliens/monsters. In this case, heat is depicted as a more annoying version of menstruation. The trouble comes from the character's need to breed, as well as oftentimes heat itself being depicted as uncomfortably hot to experience. Mating season is prime humor potential because even normally mellow or sophisticated characters can't avoid their base instincts.

Another common joke is people in the wilderness during mating season. This usually leads to an animal attack due to the high amount of animals in the area.

-   The Parshendi in _The Stormlight Archive_ are a race of crustacean people who can change between different forms every Highstorm.

Being a Proud Scholar Race, they find the whole experience extremely mortifying, and to make matters worse, _pon farr_ will inevitably occur in the most inconvenient and messy way possible, dragging the afflicted Vulcans (and their friends unlucky enough to find themselves caught in the middle) through an episode's worth of violent chaos.

        -   In the _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ episode "Fascination", Lwaxana suffers from what's basically empathic incontinence — she inadvertently broadcasts her emotions to other people, causing various members of the cast to suddenly experience strong lustful urges toward people they're already attracted to. If they're with someone who has similar feelings for them, the results are merely unprofessional and embarrassing. If they're with someone with someone who _isn't_ attracted to them, things get much worse. Chief O'Brien nearly attacks Quark after the latter sexually harasses Kiko.

    Music 

-   In the Eels song "End Times", the narrator has to deal with this while trying to get over a breakup.

-   Older _Dungeons & Dragons_ monster manuals that go into detail about creature ecology sometimes mention this. For example, the world of Krynn has hatori, giant sand-swimming crocodiles, which are dangerous enough in normal circumstances, but every ten years congregate in the heart of the desert, where the males fight vicious battles over breeding rights. This leads desert nomads to speak of a "time of thunder when mountains die."

    -   _Monster Hunter Generations_: Male Mitzusune have been known to go berserk during the mating season, they typically aren't hunted (and there are laws saying that they normally can't) but during the mating season, hunting requests come in to hunt males that have gone berserk near inhabited areas.

    Webcomics 

    Web Original

    Western Animation 

-   The _Futurama_ episode "Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?" has Zoidberg behaving erratically because it's mating season for his species. He ends up in a duel to the death with Fry over a decapodian woman in a parody of _Star Trek_'s "Amok Time".

-   _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_: Mewman females such as Star go through a process known as "Mewberty." It starts with them shedding little hearts whenever they're around attractive boys and ends with them transforming into a six-armed butterfly monster that captures and cocoons every male it comes across. Unfortunately despite how horrifying the whole event is for everyone involved, there's nothing you can do other than letting it run its course. After Star's Mewberty, she has tiny wings that she can barely use to flutter, and her mother later demonstrates the ability to go into six-armed butterfly mode at will.

    Real Life 

-   Male elephants go into a period called musth when they're ready to mate. The condition can be identified by what look like tear streaks on the head and dribbling urine. They're extremely dangerous and unpredictable during this time due to the pain caused by the swollen glands on their head combined with a massive boost in their testosterone levels, basically turning into Real Life examples of Cruel Elephant.
-   Male deer, elk, moose, and caribou all enter rut during mating season. Their antlers become extremely itchy, causing them to scratch the velvet off them and reveal the sharp bone underneath. They also become extremely aggressive and begin gathering into groups to fight, which can sometimes be to the death if the loser doesn't flee fast enough. They're also known to occasionally attack and sometimes even kill humans in this state.
-   The male antechinus undergoes some drastic hormonal changes during the mating season in order to increase reproductive output. The side-effect of this is that these changes can and often are fatal, which encourages the males to roam as far as they can and mate with as many females as possible, often to the point of foregoing food and water. Between the extreme hormonal changes, starvation, dehydration, and simple exhaustion, it's very rare for males to survive more than one mating season.
