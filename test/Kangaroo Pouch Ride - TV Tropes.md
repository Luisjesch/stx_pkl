Uber's predecessor, Hoppy.

**Bart:** Ewww! It's not like in cartoons!  
**Homer:** Yeah. There's a lot more mucus.

Many works like to feature exotic animals, and nothing is a cooler way to introduce a weird beast than by using it for transportation. One unusual class of mammals with natural potential for transport are marsupials - after all, they come with their own pockets. And every so often, a character gets the bright idea of using that potential, and climbs into the pouch of a fast-moving pouched creature, typically a kangaroo. A few short hops later, character is safely at their destination, ready to resume the plot.

In cartoons, this trope very often overlaps with Pelican Package Pouch as the kangaroo can chauffeur several people around and practically store an entire wardrobe in their pouch, often carrying everything but that one item they need.

Given that a marsupial's pouch is something like an incubator for its embryonic infants much of the time, and is very rarely empty of young, this trope means Artistic License – Biology. Extra discredit if the marsupial is supposed to be male: the pouch is part of the female reproductive suite. In truth, trying to ride in a kangaroo's pouch would get a much... squickier result.

Even if the kangaroo is indeed female and not carrying young, unless the intended passenger is a small Talking Animal itself, there just wouldn't be room to hitch a lift. And, if they _are_ small enough to fit, the rider won't be able to get out unless the kangaroo allows it: mother roos can constrict the pouch's entrance to restrain unruly joeys.

Compare with Boxing Kangaroo and Kangaroos Represent Australia. Compare Horse of a Different Color and Fur Is Clothing. Sister trope to Protection in Mouth, for another way creatures can hide another inside them physically.

    Anime & Manga 

-   While there are no kangaroos in _Pokémon: The Series_ per se, there are Kangaskhan. They are much larger and exclusively female. In an episode of the anime, they adopt and raise a human child who could easily fit inside the pouch. Furthermore, as seen in the end of the episode, the pouch could fit the child, his birth parents, and a baby Kangaskhan, with room to spare. Kangaskhan are officially depicted as 7'03'' in size, but the Kangaskhan leader in this episode was easily 15 to 20 feet tall to pull that feat off.
    -   Pikachu's origin story in _Pokémon Journeys: The Series_ has him being adopted as a Pichu by a loving Kangakhan mom. Unfortunately, he and the baby become too big to occupy the pouch together and end up slowing the Kangaskhan down.
-   Lupin III and his right-hand man, Jigen, use this in at least one episode to make their getaway. Because how else would the world's greatest thief make a grand escape in Australia?

    Comic Books 

-   _The Cartoon History of the Universe_, when talking about the spread of Cro-Magnons throughout the world, shows a map including, in Australia, a woman riding in a kangaroo's pouch. The kangaroo looks a bit puzzled about this.

    Comic Strips 

-   A panel in _The Far Side_ features Hannibal's first attempt at crossing the Alps. It involves his men riding kangaroos along the narrow ledges (with predictable results).
-   _Pearls Before Swine_ had Rat do this in an attempt to conserve energy.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Dot and the Kangaroo_ (and its sequels) has a whole song about it. The mother kangaroo had lost her baby, thus leaving her pouch empty and she is elated to have Dot ride in it because it reminds her of the feeling of having a child.
    
    _The best fun in the world_/ _And I tell you it's true_/ _Is to ride in the pouch of a red kangaroo_.
    
-   _Minions_: In their search of England, the Minion clan makes a short trip in kangaroo pouches when they reach Australia.

-   In an _Encyclopedia Brown_ story, a kid tells a bunch of stories about his travels around the world in order to secure membership in some sort of club only for Encyclopedia to claim he's lying his ass off. The "male kangaroo with marsupial pouch" mistake is one of the _many_ errors in the kid's stories.
-   Sterling Lanier's _The Unforsaken Hiero_: Subverted. Giant kangaroos are used as mounts in D'alwah, but people ride on their _backs_ with highly specialized saddles.
-   In _Winnie-the-Pooh_, Rabbit kidnaps Roo by dropping Piglet into Kanga's button-up pouch when she isn't looking (they're about the same size, so she just thinks Rabbit put Roo in for her). Piglet doesn't enjoy the ride at all.
-   In _Deltora Quest_, Dread Mountain, the heros meet a small number of creatures called the Kin, large, winged, intelligent creatures whom were hunted to near extinction by the Gnomes and Grey guards respectively. After rescuing one of their young three of the largest of the Kin volunteer to fly the characters to the titular mountain in their pouches.
-   In _The Pride of Parahumans_, Aniya is a "rescue-taur" type parahuman with opossum genes and an airtight pouch on her lower body that can fit most humans or parahumans in case one's helmet breaks while on a spacewalk.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Goodies_: When the Goodies start their own pirate postal operation, Graham says he's ordered several hundred kangaroos for parcel post delivery. This is an early indication that he's going loony.

    Music

    Video Games 

-   Played straight in _The Legend of Zelda: Oracle Games_ with Ricky the kangaroo, who appears to be male. Of course, like all anime and Japanese game kangaroos, he wears boxing gloves.

-   Averted in _Bomberman_; in games where Louie is present, Bomberman rides on his back.
-   In _Mega Man X7_, one Maverick Boss, Vanishing Gungaroo, is based on a joey, and he uses a Mother Kangaroo-like Ride Armor, the cockpit being on its pouch.
-   Much like in the anime; when you allow a Kangaskhan to follow you in _Pokémon Let's Go, Pikachu! and Eevee!_, your partner will snuggle in the pouch beside the joey. The player character avoids this by hitching a ride on her shoulder instead.

    Web Animation 

    Webcomics 

    Web Original 

-   In _Orion's Arm_, Siberoos are kangaroo-Siberian tiger splices that were engineered as rescue animals in polar regions. Females can carry passengers and keep them warm at the same time.

    Western Animation 

-   Deconstructed in _The Simpsons_; Bart and Homer try to ride one but soon discover that, unlike cartoons, real kangaroos have mucus in their pouches and can't accommodate anything bigger than their joeys.
-   Also deconstructed in _Family Guy_. Peter climbs into the pouch of a kangaroo, but the poor kangaroo can barely move.
-   _Schoolhouse Rock!,_ "Rufus Xavier Sarsaparilla." The titular character gains a pet kangaroo and rides around this way.
-   In _The Wild Thornberrys_, a kangaroo once allows Eliza to travel this way as a favor. It's a little more realistic since Eliza is shown crammed in the very tiny pouch.
-   _Futurama: Bender's Game_ had orc spear-throwers riding in giant war-kangaroo pouches. A baby kangaroo was hanging around with the orcs in the pouch.
-   Happens with giant-sized kangaroo monsters in an episode of _Courage the Cowardly Dog_.
-   Looney Tunes:
    -   In the cartoon _Daffy Duck Slept Here_, Daffy claims that he has an invisible kangaroo named Hymie. Porky doesn't buy it, so Daffy climbs up on an invisible pouch and his disembodied floating head is seen bouncing all over the room. Even so, Porky still doesn't buy it.
    -   Bugs Bunny gets "adopted" by a kangaroo in one episode who insists he ride in her pouch — which has a zipper on it.
-   On _The Flintstones_, Hoppy frequently gives Bamm-Bamm these.
-   _Johnny Bravo_: After getting stranded in an Australian wildlife park, Johnny gets adopted by a mother kangaroo, who puts him in her pouch when the herd moves, much to his annoyance. He actually fits fine, despite being an adult human who is a good deal more muscular than average, his main problem is that the jumping makes him carsick.
-   _The World of David the Gnome_ does this once. It is either a kangaroo or a wallaby. (Of course, with a six-inch-tall gnome, this makes sense.)

A series of shape changing shenanigans occur between the heroes and Valmont's mooks, until Chan is accidentally transformed into a kangaroo and Jade into a rabbit. After beating up the villains in his kangaroo form, he puts rabbit-Jade in his pouch and tries to make a jumpy getaway. Considering that in a later episode, Jade used it again to transform herself into a maned lion, the talisman presumably alters gender as well.
-   _Laff-A-Lympics_: One episode features a kangaroo race as the last event. Subverted because the only entrant to ride his kangaroo's pouch is Mumbly, who uses a mechanical kangaroo instead of a real one, which isn't against any rules.
-   A 1980s _Gumby_ episode, "Kangaroo Express", had an Australian equivalent to the Pony Express, where kangaroos carry small parcels across Australia in their pouches. Thanks to Gumby's portable Shrink-a-Dink device, Gumby and his friends can ride in one of the kangaroos.
