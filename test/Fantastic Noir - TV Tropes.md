Being a private Dick in this town was hungry work... and he was all out of bananas. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

_"The Butler Did It! With a death curse! From space! Take him away, Troll Patrol!"_

A sister trope of "neo-noir" or cyberpunk, fantastic noir is a relatively small subgenre that blends the setting, characters (it usually stars a Hardboiled Detective who sometimes doubles as an Occult Detective), and plot structure of a Film Noir mystery story with the more colorful elements of fantasy and Science Fiction. The genre seemed to arrive all at once in The '80s and remains strong today, with the publication of such books as _Anonymous Rex_, _Who Censored Roger Rabbit?_, _Sweet Silver Blues_, _Stalking the Unicorn_, and _The Hollow Chocolate Bunnies of the Apocalypse_.

Compare Cyberpunk, Dark Fantasy, Dungeon Punk, Urban Fantasy. Androids and Detectives and Vampire Detective Series are specific variants.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _The Big O_: Roger Smith is a hardboiled private investigator in a futuristic City Noir city. His Sassy Secretary is a robot. He also pilots a Humongous Mecha to fight monsters.
-   Both Ryohgo Narita's works _Baccano!_ and _Durarara!!_ sort of fall under this trope. They both have several Film Noir elements (such as organized crime and private eyes) that are often integrated with supernatural elements (the former has immortal characters and the latter features a Duallahan as one of the main characters).
-   _Darker than Black_ is a gritty detective story about sociopathic superhumans.
-   Both _Devilman Lady_ and _DEVILMAN crybaby_, Psychological Thriller anime adaptations of the _Devilman_ manga franchise, could qualify as such.
-   _Pluto_, an _Astro Boy_ story arc reimagined as a hard-boiled noir tale. The detective is a superpowered robot out to find out why his fellow super robots are being murdered one by one.
-   _The Witch and the Beast_ has witches, magic and other fantastical creatures set in an Art Deco-inspired world with MagiTek. All of the characters wear appropriate period clothing of the 1920s to 1940s and smoking is prevalent everywhere. The plot is also centered on a dark and gloomy mystery with various conspiracies and sub-plots spread throughout the setting. It is Fantastic Noir to the tee.

    Comic Books 

-   _Absalom_ features an alcoholic Defective Detective who is charged to uphold the pact between the British crown and the forces of Hell.
-   Pictured above is DC's _Angel and the Ape_, which is about a beautiful human Hardboiled Detective and a gorilla comic artist in New York City. Given that they're in a universe where all the other DC characters exist, the most "fantastic" aspect is probably that people don't freak out when they see Sam walking down the street (there _are_ other intelligent gorillas in The DCU, but the most famous one is Gorilla Grodd, a supervillain... and Sam's grandfather). This is eventually explained as Sam having a psychic power that causes people to see him as human.
-   _Astro City_ sometimes drifts into this trope, such as in "The Tarnished Angel" storyline, which follows a retired Chrome Champion supervillain as he investigates a string of murders targeting his fellow villains.
-   _Batman_ stories will sometimes contain elements of this, particularly in _Detective Comics_.
-   One _Beast Wars: Uprising_ story is written in the style of hard-boiled noir stories, following a cynical detective as he investigates a strange case. Given that all the characters are robots that turn into cars and vehicles, it qualifies as this.
-   _Black Magick_: Rowan Black is a police detective in Portsmouth, a town in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. She's also a practicing Wiccan, with real magical abilities, though she keeps this fact private from her fellow officers. And somebody has just started hunting witches...
-   _Blacksad_ is a series of noir stories based in the U.S. around the 1950s, but in a World of Funny Animals, with the animal usually being related to the character's profession and/or personality (the chief of police is a German Shephard dog, a hitman seen in the first issue is a snake, etc.). The hardboiled detective protagonist, John Blacksad, is a black cat.
-   _Cyrus Perkins and the Haunted Taxi Cab_ is about a man whose taxi is haunted by the ghost of a boy who recently died in the backseat. Cyrus needs to help him solve the mystery of his murder so he can find peace and move on.
-   _Daredevil_ becomes this during one of the volume 2 storylines involving a drug that grants superpowers to people, which leads to the titular hero stopping the distributor of it.
-   _Fables_ is a Fairy Tale noir series about a werewolf (or more accurately, a wolfwere and The Big Bad Wolf himself) whose job is to keep the peace among his fellow Fables and keep them from killing each other, as well as keeping things in Fabletown from spilling over into the mundane world.
-   _Fatale_ is set in the 1950s, with a bunch of detectives investigating a series of ritualistic murders, with a supernatural Femme Fatale at the center of it who's fighting demonic eldritch forces.
-   _The Goon_ takes a Fantasy Kitchen Sink approach, but the core of the story's aesthetic comes from 1930s crime pulp. The two main characters are a pair of cartoon gangsters taking on zombies, robots, mutants, vampires, and more.
-   _Hellboy_ involves the title character investigating supernatural mysteries and occurrences, and Mike Mignola's artwork helps give it that noir feel.
-   _The Human Target (2021)_ is framed through the lens of a traditional detective noir mystery, but all of the suspects happen to be members of the Justice League of America. The protagonist, Christopher Chance, has no superpowers whatsoever, but his partner and local Femme Fatale, Tora Olafsdotter, is An Ice Person, he gets regularly harassed by Guy Gardner, an abrasive "cop" of the Green Lantern Corps, and the mystery is trying to find out who tried to kill Lex Luthor — a well-known supervillain — and ended up fatally poisoning Chance instead.
-   _Jessica Jones_, particularly in the original MAX run _Alias_, which was dubbed "Comic Book Noir" by Jeph Loeb in the introduction to the first trade paperback.
-   The _Marvel Noir_ line, including _Spider-Man Noir_, has this feel, especially for Spider-Man. _Iron Man Noir_ is a bit misnamed, since it's more of a pulp action story.
-   _Powers_ involves two homicide detectives who investigate cases involving superheroes and supervillains.
-   Jeff Smith's _RASL_ is a science fiction series with significant noir influence. RASL's an art thief on the run from his past, but he's running to Alternate Universes — and that's just the beginning.
-   _Muktuk Wolfsbreath, Hard-Boiled Shaman_ are classic noir stories following a jaded detective solving mysteries. The twist is that the "detective" is a shaman in the Siberian Taiga and his cases involve keeping peace between mortals and the Spirit World.

    Fan Works 

-   The _Bolt_ fanfic "Bolt Noir" by Plonq is a spoof of Film Noir style mystery films and TV shows. After watching episodes of _Peter Gunn_, Bolt imagines himself as a detective with a needy dame for a client (Mittens) and a helpful sidekick (Rhino). There's no murder to contend with, however — just a hankering for cat treats and a point to prove.

    Films — Animation 

-   _The Animatrix_: In the short "A Detective Story", a private detective on a seemingly routine case starts to discover that his entire world is a lie.
-   _Batman: Mask of the Phantasm_ is basically a Whole-Plot Reference to _Out of the Past_, but with Batman instead of Robert Mitchum.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Anon (2018)_: Of the Cyberpunk variety. The world is a place with a corrupt police force, the entire world under surveillance with their own eyes, privacy extinct, and everyone seemingly living drab meaningless lives with the protagonist no exception. Furthermore, there's a serial killer on the loose that the government doesn't care about the murders of due to them being more interested in how they're spoofing the system.
-   Downplayed in _Atlantics_. The setting is mostly Like Reality, Unless Noted, but a major subplot is a police officer's attempts to solve a series of seemingly impossible crimes, which are eventually revealed to be supernatural in nature and involve ghosts possessing people to start fires and extort money.
-   Preeminent on the SF side, _Blade Runner_. In a future City Noir city, a hardboiled detective complete with a Private Eye Monologue tracks down rogue androids.
-   _Cast a Deadly Spell_. Phillip Lovecraft is a detective who doesn't use magic in a world where everyone else does. Also its sequel, _Witch Hunt_.
-   _Cool World_ features an animated/real-life blend with human detective Frank Harris trying to catch doodle (cartoon) Holli Would.
-   _Dark City_ initially seems like a normal Film Noir, but then The Reveal happens and it shoots straight into this trope. Also something of an Invoked Trope, since the Strangers seem to have consciously modeled the fake City Noir that humanity inhabits on the sort of cities you see in old detective movies.
-   _The Exorcist III_ blends some classic murder mystery elements into the Demonic Possession story you would expect from the franchise. George C. Scott's Hardboiled Detective Anti-Nihilist protagonist is a classic Noir hero.
-   _Lord of Illusions_ is an adaptation that Clive Barker did base on his Harry D'Amour stories. Here, Harry is an Occult Detective who has been involved in exorcisms and has to stop an Evil Sorcerer from returning from the grave.
-   _Pokémon Detective Pikachu_ is a Film Noir set in the _Pokémon_ universe, so it applies for this even if you leave out the fact that one of the detectives is a talking Pikachu.
-   _Repeat Performance_ from 1947, probably the Ur-Example. The main character is a woman who murders her husband on New Year's Eve and wishes for a chance to relive the preceding year to avoid making the mistakes that led to that moment.
-   _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_. Eddie Valiant is a private eye in a version of 1940s Los Angeles where living cartoons exist and work alongside humans.
    -   _Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers (2022)_ acts more as a spiritual successor to _Roger Rabbit_ than a direct adaptation of its source material. Set in a similar world of cartoons and humans, the film sees the duo as a pair of Animated Actors on the titular series who must make amends when one of their co-stars is kidnapped.

    Literature 

-   The _Anita Blake_ series starts out as this and still has elements of it in the later works.
-   _Anonymous Rex_. The detective Vincent Rubio is a velociraptor in a world where dinosaurs aren't dead but are in hiding.
-   _Azoth Express_ combines the classic mystery on a train with fantastic elements, starting with the detective himself, who is a wolfman.
-   Tad Williams' _Bobby Dollar_ series is about an angel advocate caught between the forces of Heaven and Hell.
-   _Bone Song_ is a detective/conspiracy novel which takes place in a City Noir where humans live side by side with mages, witches, zombies, wraiths, cat folk, gargoyles, and other fantastic creatures.
-   _Bubbles in Space_: The series is a combination of cyberpunk dystopia and noir detective series with many references to classic Noir detective fiction. Our protagonist, barely-functional private detective Bubbles, has a cybernetic arm and frequently solves cases related to everything from AI to cloning.
-   _City of Devils_ and its sequels _Fifty Feet of Trouble_ and _Wolfman Confidential_, are noir mysteries crossed with a Monster Mash. The cops are all werewolves, the studio heads are crawling eyes, the machinists are gremlins, the blue-collar folks are zombies, the actors are doppelgangers, and so on.
-   _Dan Shamble, Zombie P.I._ adds horror motifs and a hefty dose of humor into the mix.
-   _Dirk Gently_ by Douglas Adams' series is a parody of this genre. Dirk Gently doesn't believe in the supernatural, but he's happy to pretend he does in order to fleece people who do, and then it turns out that the supernatural does believe in Dirk Gently.
-   _Discworld_ stories involving Sam Vimes and the Ankh-Morpork City Watch tend to edge into being these, especially _The Fifth Elephant_.
-   Vlad Taltos in the _Dragaera_ novels is an (ultimately former) human assassin in a fantasy world where elves are in charge and narrates in a hardboiled First-Person Smartass tone. The plots of all of the novels involve mysteries solved through detection, and Vlad has the traditional Sassy Secretary in two nontraditional forms, his Dragaeran (elf) sidekick Kragar and his pet jhereg (more or less a Shoulder-Sized Dragon), Loiosh, a sapient animal that snarkily communicates with Vlad telepathically.
-   Many of _The Dresden Files_ books, especially the earliest ones — Hardboiled Detective monologue running smack up against wizards, faeries and vampires. Results in many tons of awesome.
-   Brian Parker's _Easytown_ take place in 2060s New Orleans where the city has embraced technological vice like sex bots, virtual reality porn, and designer drugs to appeal to the tourists while keeping it segregated in a specific crime-ridden part of the city. Zachary Forest is the one honest cop in the city who later becomes a private detective and treats it as his personal beat.
-   Alex Bledsoe's _Eddie LaCrosse_ books are basically hard-boiled detective novels in a Sword and Sorcery setting.
-   The _Elemental Assassin_ novels are about a magic-wielding Professional Killer who operates out of a Wretched Hive in a version of modern-day earth that includes elementals, vampires, dwarfs, and giants.
-   _Even Though I Knew the End_ is set in 1941 Chicago and the detective, Helen Brandt uses magic spells to investigate crime scenes and track leads to catch the White City Vampire who is killing people and using their blood for Blood Magic and the killer is an angel trying to get back to Heaven.
-   _A Fable of Tonight_ series by Mike Resnick, particularly _Stalking the Unicorn_. Many of the stock noir characters are given a fantasy twist. For example, John's partner, who often acts as The Watson, is a famous semi-retired monster hunter, his "secretary" who also plays the part of the classic Femme Fatale is a Cat Girl, and John's persistent enemy and local crime boss The Grundy is a demon.
-   _Forests of the Night_ by S. Andrew Swann (part of the _Moreau Series_) is a near-future murder mystery tale featuring anthropomorphic animals, genetically-altered humans, and aliens. The hard-boiled detective protagonist is an anthropomorphic tiger.
-   The _Garrett, P.I._ series is practically a Trope Codifier for this one, telling hard-boiled detective stories in a world of classic fantasy races.
-   _Gun, with Occasional Music_ is a hardboiled private eye novel set in a future where Uplifted Animals are common, and the PI's role as the outsider who asks the uncomfortable questions is exaggerated by the circumstance that in this society asking a direct question is a major social taboo, so _all_ questions are uncomfortable; police and detectives have Inquisitor's Licenses permitting them to ask questions in the line of duty, but they tend to make people uneasy all the same.
-   Robert A. Heinlein's works:
    -   The novella "Magic, Inc." directly deals with an investigator's pursuit into the workings of a sinister organization, in a parallel version of the modern urban world where magic is commonplace — including flying carpet taxicabs.
    -   "The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag" surrounds a man-and-wife PI team investigating the titular character, although the magic in that story is more of the divine sort. (Sort of.)
-   _The Hollow Chocolate Bunnies of the Apocalypse_ by Robert Rankin takes place in a Clock Punk world where nursery-rhyme characters are real and toys are alive, but only in Toy City. The protagonist ends up getting recruited by a jaded, hard-drinking private detective who just happens to be a teddy bear to solve a series of murders, including the bear's late partner, Wee Willie Winkie.
-   In _The Imaginary Corpse_, the debut novel from Tyler Hayes, detective Tippy, a stuffed triceratops, is on the trail of a Serial Killer of imaginary friends. It contains many of the noir trappings, but with an extra layer of heart and hope — a hard-boiled detective who hits the (root) beer hard, in the Stillreal, where imaginary friends go when they are no longer needed.
-   _Joyland_ by Stephen King blends this with Magic Realism as it's about a search for a serial killer at a haunted amusement park.
-   The _League of Magi_ novella _Coldheart_, in the collection of the same name, is a noir story that uncovers monsters, mages, and possessed people.
-   _Mr Blank_ and the sequel _Get Blank_ feature aliens, chupacabras, brainwashed super-killers, pretty much every conspiracy under the sun, and a few garden-variety unkillable mobsters.
-   _Nerve Zero_'s Idriel Ramirez spends his time in a noir plot, despite being in the distant future on a false planet with no gravity.
-   Kim Newman:
    -   "The Big Fish" takes an unnamed 1940s gumshoe, heavily implied to be Philip Marlowe, and pits him against the Esoteric Order of Dagon.
    -   In a sequel, "The Trouble with Barrymore" (part of the _Seven Stars_ sequence), the same gumshoe gets involved in the hunt for an Artifact of Doom.
    -   "Castles in the Air" has the _Anno Dracula_ counterpart of the same character on a missing person case connected to a vampire cult.
    -   _Something More Than Night_ is set in 1930s Hollywood and has a private eye (with the assistance of Raymond Chandler himself) investigating a case that involves psychic powers and inadvisably-applied mad science.
-   Simon R. Green's work, particularly his _Nightside_ and _Hawk & Fisher_ novels, has elements of this.
-   _Noir Fatale_ by Baen Books, focusing on stories containing noir aspects and Femme Fatales, with various genres added into the blend from pure fantasy to science fiction.
-   _Nursery Crime_ blends fairy tales with a Police Procedural/'70s-style Cop Show aesthetic. To a degree, _Thursday Next_ qualifies, too.
-   _Obsidian & Blood_ by Aliette de Bodard is a noir mystery trilogy in the Aztec Empire at its height.
-   _The Resurrected Man_ by Sean Williams is a noir detective story set in a futuristic world with teleporters, artificial intelligences, and brain uploading.
-   C.T. Phipps: Several of his series deals in this.
    -   _Agent G_ is the story of a professional assassin and cyborg who works for Murder, Inc.. He finds himself A Lighter Shade of Black than his employers but can't turn to the authorities or anyone else to do better. Femme Fatale characters aplenty.
        -   _The Cyber Dragons Trilogy_ appears to be a science fiction action thriller but the protagonist soon finds themselves wrapped up in conspiracies, detective work, and dark pasts they want to forget.
    -   _The Bright Falls Mysteries_ is inspired by the works of David Lynch despite being set in a town full of werewolves and spirits. Jane Doe is an amateur detective in a town utterly filled with secrets, lies, and real world evils alongside the supernatural ones.
    -   Morgan Detective Agency is a series about a Hardboiled Detective who just so happens to walk the beat of a city filled with supernatural horrors. Ashley Morgan is a Broken Ace and struggles to rebuild herself after her trauma as a vampire's slave.
    -   _Red Room_ is a spy story about a morally ambiguous conspiracy that keeps the world ignorant of the supernatural. Its protagonist is an assassin that is aware the organization may do more evil than good. It also ends with the hero dead and most of the cast.
-   _Shadow Police_: Occult Detectives patrol a horrifying hidden London.
-   _Shadowrun_ has Nigel Findley's Dirk Mongomery, a Private Investigator in over his head in two novels, _2XS_ and _House Of The Sun_. Both are set in a Genre-Busting world of Cyberpunk, Magitek, and Noir.
-   _A Study in Emerald_ has Sherlock Holmes in a world ruled by the Great Old Ones. _Sherlock Holmes_ isn't noir, technically speaking, but this short story is a near-perfect snapshot of this subgenre.
-   Simon Kurt Unsworth's _Thomas Fool_ series follows the titular character, an "Information Man" (essentially a police detective) employed by Hell's bureaucracy.
-   _Undead on Arrival_: Noir with Zombies.
-   The anthology _Weird Detectives_ is all about this.
-   _Who Censored Roger Rabbit?_ has human detective Eddie Valiant solving crimes in a world where cartoon characters are living, breathing people (some of whom happen to work in comic strips, television, and movies) discriminated against by the more numerous humans.
-   _The Witcher_ is a Standard Fantasy Setting with an outcast professional being dragged into doing the dirty work of powerful people while trying to cling to his sense of decency.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Andor_ has this feel, with the first arc following a morally grey Anti-Hero on the run from the private security force of a MegaCorp.
-   _Angel_ is very much this, especially the first four seasons when the eponymous vampire runs his own private detective agency.
-   _Daredevil (2015)_ starts off leaning towards more mundane noir (bar the presence of Matt's super-powered radar-like "vision") and gradually introduces the more fantastic Marvel Cinematic Universe elements like the Japanese gangsters actually being undead ninjas, and a Chinese drug baroness who's _possibly_ from an extradimensional city of mystical kung-fu masters.
-   _The Defenders (2017)_, which is a crossover of the Marvel Netflix shows, is also fantastic noir, as those two syndicates are actually part of the same organization, the Hand.
-   _Fringe_ has a noir-style detective story with definite fantasy elements in the episode "Brown Betty".
-   _True Detective_ may or may not qualify depending on where you fall on the Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane fence. Either it's just a typical detective story, or it's a Cosmic Horror Story about dysfunctional detectives coming into contact with Lovecraftian horrors beyond their understanding.
-   _Twin Peaks_ combines — among other genres — a murder mystery with some Mind Screw supernatural events. Although not much happens in a big city until the third series, there's definitely a noir sensibility right from the start, perhaps most noticeably in the jazzy soundtrack.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _City of Mist_ has all the trappings of Film Noir (the main characters are detectives, play largely revolves around solving cases, and sessions even start with a voiceover monologue by the players), but with the twist that the people involved have magical powers.
-   _Deadlands Noir_ is a spinoff of the original _Deadlands_; as you might guess from the title, it's meant to evoke classic noir. Player character options include "grifter" (think Addiction-Powered wizard) and Mad Scientist, and multiple published adventures involve Voodoo Zombies.
-   _Eberron_ is mostly known as a Dungeon Punk setting, but its basis in New Weird "pulp fantasy" means it can readily support this playstyle as well. Indeed, the setting is often described as "noir-inspired", and there's even an in-universe term for detective analogues: _inquisitives_.
-   There's a noir sourcebook for _Mutants & Masterminds_ 2nd edition which discusses how to mix noir themes with superhero protagonists, although it leans pretty hard on noir "thematic purity" in the process.
-   _New World of Darkness_ is made for this trope. Most of the gamelines are very suited for Gothic Punk noir, with _Hunter: The Vigil_ probably being best for it (due to the Badass Normal nature of the PCs), and _Demon: The Descent_ going straight into cyberpunk territory with an even more noir-influenced style.
    -   There's a historical supplement for _Mage: The Awakening_ called _Mage Noir_, set during the immediate aftermath of World War II, which aims to evoke classic noir and goes into detail on how the war affected both the Sleeeping and Awakened worlds, for good and for ill.
-   The style is workable (albeit spookier) in _Ravenloft_, if one stays in the more urbanized cities.
-   _Shadowrun_ in general lends itself to this style of campaigns, being set in a world that blends Cyberpunk with magic.
-   _Urban Jungle_ by default is just noir in a World of Funny Animals, but the "Occult Horror" and "Astounding Science" supplements allow one to run a Lovecraft Lite or Alien Invasion campaign.
-   _Wretched New Flesh:Postcards From Avalidad_ is an indie OSR RPG described as _future-noir_. Characters are usually investigators of some kind in a fictional, near future Moroccan city-state dominated by various corporations producing biotech implants and psychic power inducing drugs. There is also an element of horror, as most of these advancemets are the result of secret alliances made with supernatural creatures straight out of a Clive Barker novel.

    Video Games 

-   _Alone in the Dark (2023)_ is set up by its previews as a horror mystery game. The player faces a cast of monsters while solving a mystery with a jazz soundtrack.
-   Invoked by one NPC in _Baldur's Gate III_: Malta, a cat in the titular city. Talking to him with the Speak With Animals spell has him narrate your encounter in the style of a Hardboiled Detective.
    
    **Malta:** It was another day in the city of lies. Baldur's Gate - where the people begged for justice...until they starved.
    
-   _BioShock Infinite_ qualifies with its Steampunk flying city that the jaded private-detective protagonist didn't even know existed. The Downloadable Content _Burial At Sea_ (a Stealth Prequel to the original _BioShock_) is even more this, especially in the first chapter, which heavily emphasizes the Hardboiled Detective aspect.
-   _Disco Elysium_: A Defective Detective faces conspiracies, mysticism (maybe), and his own crippling flaws in an eerie Constructed World where various continent-sized isolas, each made up of separate oceans, islands, and nations, are divided by growing regions of pure nonexistence which can only be traversed by specially designed airships.
-   _Discworld Noir_ is a more humorous take on the entry, as you'd expect from the source material.
-   The _Dishonored Series_ is perhaps the definitive video-game embodiment, combining Diesel Punk, Urban Fantasy, and Lovecraft Lite:
    -   _Dishonored_ is set in a dark and gritty setting, and Corvo is on a quest for vengeance against people who betrayed him. He's the "fall-guy" and patsy who's in over his head. The _Daud_ DLC is even more noir-esque, complete with First-Person Smartass narration, a Villain Protagonist uncovering a mystery, and an unexpected and shocking betrayal around the corner, with the villain being a Femme Fatale witch.
    -   _Dishonored: Death of the Outsider_, has a pair of reformed criminals pulling a series of heists to unlock artifacts to Kill the God of their world, the Outsider.
-   _El Paso, Elsewhere_ is a very deliberate homage to the original _Max Payne_, and its story centers around a love story between an Occult Detective and vampire turned sour, as the latter tries to end the world through a ritual and the former tries to stop her.
-   In contrast to the Weird West aesthetic of _Fallout: New Vegas_, _Fallout 4_ has heavy film noir overtones, especially in the Far Harbor expansion. One of your companions is even a Hardboiled Detective, and you can play as one yourself.
-   _Grim Fandango_ is LucasArts' take on the noir genre, as set in a Land of the Dead inspired by Mexican folklore and Aztec Mythology. Especially Year 2, which has Manny doing his best Humphrey Bogart impression while investigating what is effectively a murder mystery.
-   _The Journey Down_ crosses an otherwise typical Hardboiled Detective story with heavy doses of Afro-Caribbean culture and imagery, alongside Steampunk technology and, by the time of Part 3, ancient Magitek.
-   _Katana ZERO_, the tale of a Hitman with a Heart caught up in a Government Conspiracy who just happens to possess time-warping Psychic Powers.
-   The Shared Universe of _Project Moon_'s games (_Lobotomy Corporation_, _Library of Ruina_, and _Limbus Company_) all have this as a unifying quality, blending Cyberpunk, Dungeon Punk, Urban Fantasy and New Weird all in a blender and putting it in a corporate dystopia of intrigue, murder and grit where the secrets runs thicker than the blood, and if the various supernatural horrors don't kill you, the Wings of the World most certainly _will_. Predictably, it's also firmly on the 'cynical' end of the Sliding Scale of Idealism Versus Cynicism, being a Crapsack World where the best you can hope for is a broken arm and Bittersweet Ending.
-   _Mass Effect 2_ has noir influences all over it, right from the introduction of the Illusive Man and Miranda. But it's especially prominent in pretty much everything you do on Omega and Ilium. Both places are corrupt hotbeds of organized crime and gang violence lit up by neon lights. As one character puts it, Ilium is basically "Omega, just with fancy shoes".
-   _Master Detective Archives: Rain Code_ is described by its Introduction video as a “Lucid-Noir” game. The trailers indeed present a cyberpunk setting and an amnesiac young detective-in-training working with a ghost to solve crimes through supernatural methods.
-   _Primordia (2012)_ follows a pair of world-weary friends who’re forced to play detective in a City Noir, and qualifies as this by virtue of being set After the End with a cast made up entirely of robots.
-   Like the pen and paper game it's based on, _Shadowrun Returns_ blends Cyberpunk with High Fantasy concepts like elves and dragons.
-   _The Sinking City_ revolves around a hardboiled and mentally unstable Occult Detective with Psychic Powers investigating a city that has been flooded by perpetual rains and haunted by hideous monsters ever since a cult stirred an oceanic deity of the Cthulhu Mythos.
-   The _Tex Murphy_ series by Access Software stars the titular Hardboiled Detective in a post-apocalyptic San Francisco as he deals with mutants and aliens.
-   The _Thief_ series is a classic example of this and gets quite creative with some of the associated tropes.
-   _The Wolf Among Us_ is a noir tale set in the _Fables_ universe, focusing on Sheriff Bigby Wolf as he tries to solve a series of murders.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Policenauts_ veers a little more towards Buddy Cop Show in some spots, but the central premise is very much a _Miami Vice_ style neo-noir story in space.
-   _Snatcher_, heavily inspired by the above-mentioned _Blade Runner_, follows the story of a hard-boiled detective and his Robot Buddy as they investigate a conspiracy involving cyborg monsters killing and impersonating the citizens of a neon-drenched Mega City.

    Web Animation 

-   _Dimensional Prophecy of Zohar Redux_ features neo-noir lighting mixed with Cyberpunk and horror elements.

    Webcomics 

-   _Problem Sleuth_ mixes this with a World of Chaos and a flavorsome combination of awesome and weirdness.
-   _Walking in the Dark_ fits this perfectly. Ben Westford is a vampiric tabloid reporter/detective in a '30s-style city; he spends his nights solving supernatural mysteries along with his sidekicks, an overenthusiastic Tengu, and a journalism professor-turned-witch.
-   _Girl Genius_ brings in this trope with the side story featuring Ivo Sharktooth, Private Jäger, who is hired by Agatha and Vanamonde to investigate the theft of a trophy.

    Web Original 

-   The Juno Steel storyline of _The Penumbra Podcast_ is a noir story set centuries in the future in Hyperion City, the largest city on Mars. Some cases are more traditional, while others deal with things like mind-reading pills, bionic eyes, and ancient alien superweapons.
-   _Blake Skye Private Eye_ starts as your typical noir story but then takes a turn into cosmic horror, complete with old forbidden tomes, costly spells, and eldritch beings.

    Web Videos 

-   _There Will Be Brawl_ is a mix of _Watchmen_, _The Silence of the Lambs_, and many others all in the Nintendo universe.

    Western Animation 

-   A few episodes of _Codename: Kids Next Door_ use this genre, especially with Numbah Two playing the role of the detective. Given the strange happenings the KND deal with on a normal basis, Hoagie's cases will often include cases such as the murder of a Rainbow Monkey or a series of pink-eye infections caused by the school nurse so their eye crumbs can be used as crust for her desserts.
-   _Gargoyles_ strays into this sometimes, usually if the episode in question features Broadway (who's a fan of Film Noir) or Matt Bluestone.
-   Episode 50 of _Samurai Jack_, "The Tale of X9", distinctly follows this route despite it set in the far future. X9 is a robotic assassin wielding a laser Tommy and driving a hover-Hudson who, by gaining sentience, grew disillusioned with his job and was the first of Aku's robots to quit. The episode begins when Aku forces him out of retirement to fight Jack, X9 knowing he won't make it out alive.
