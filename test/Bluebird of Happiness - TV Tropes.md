A king to marry and bluebirds to herald it.

_"There'll be bluebirds over the white cliffs of Dover tomorrow,  
Just you wait and see  
There'll be love and laughter, and peace ever after, tomorrow,  
When the world is free,  
The shepherd will tend his sheep,  
A valley will bloom again,  
Jimmy will go to sleep in his own little room again  
There'll be bluebirds over the white cliffs of Dover tomorrow,  
Just you wait and see"_

— **(There'll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs of Dover**

Feeling blue? Don't! Look, there's a bluebird perched there!

Perhaps it's because they're a shade of Heavenly Blue, but bluebirds are symbols of happiness — and this indeed, covers several entirely different species of songbirds, as long as they have blue feathers.

A common plot is to go on The Quest for one only to return home empty-handed and find it was already there. Outlining the lesson that home is where you will find happiness is optional. While they have learned to recognize it from the quest, it's usually not It's the Journey That Counts, because it is usually treated as something they should have recognized even before.

Besides this MacGuffin status, they can also be local color, but because of the symbolism, they are seldom the Loyal Animal Companion.

As true bluebirds (actually members of the thrush family) are only native to North America, any instance of them showing up in Europe is Misplaced Wildlife. However, some mentions of "blue birds" in popular fiction and poetry, such as the French play _L'Oiseau Bleu_, predate the discovery of the American bluebird; they are thought to be references to a different bird known as the blue rock-thrush.

Skalabonsky, so he flies away, leaving Pig sad and alone once again.
-   In _Prickly City_, a bluebird came up to and sang to a moping Carmen — she observes: "No anguish goes unchallenged."

-   _Sadko_, in both the original Russian and the English dub, has Sadko/"Sinbad" searching for the Bluebird of Happiness to bring joy to his homeland. He finds a magical bird, but it only brings sleep with its song, not happiness, resulting in the classic "happiness was home all along" ending.
-   _(500) Days of Summer_ homages this during a (rather hilarious) scene where Tom is having a musical-like fantasy of victorious happiness after the first time he has sex with Summer.

    Music 

-   The Vocaloid song "Desert Bluebird" by mothy is about two siblings going to search for a bluebird that can grant any wish in a world After the End, destroyed by (apparently) a nuclear war. As it turns out, they DO find the bluebird but it was in an old nuclear base. The radiation makes the older sister die, and the younger brother wishes to the bird to revive her; it does, and then disappears. The song ends with the sibling saying that they should rebuild the world with their own hands.
-   There was a hit song in 1934 called "The Bluebird of Happiness" which, according to The Other Wiki, is probably the origin of the American phrase (though the concept is much older in Europe).
-   The lyrics of the They Might Be Giants song "Birdhouse in Your Soul" from _Flood_, by John Linnell and about a night light shaped like a blue canary, include the phrase "blue bird of friendliness."
-   "(There'll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs of Dover": World War II song urging hope.
-   The Wings song "Bluebird" uses the bluebird to represent freedom. The singer refers to himself as a bluebird and tells his love that if he kisses her, she'll turn into a bluebird, too, so that they can escape together across the sea.
-   "Big Rock Candy Mountain" chiefly cites the charms directly — lemonade streams and hens that lay soft-boiled eggs, but it does invoke the bluebird as symbolic:
    
    _Where the bluebird sings  
    On the big rock candy mountain_
    
-   The Marina Diamandis song "Handmade Heaven" uses this as one of the bird metaphors.
    
    In this handmade heaven
    
    I come alive  
    Bluebirds forever color the sky
    
-   Subverted with "My Blue Tears" from Dolly Parton's _Coat of Many Colors_, where Dolly tells said bird to fly away as she can't be cheered up.
-   Dave Matthews Band has the song, "Black and Blue Bird".

    Theater 

-   _The Blue Bird_ revolves around the search for one.

    Video Games 

-   There's a level with a "red bird of happiness" in _Super Mario Sunshine_.
-   _Tokimeki Memorial 2_ has, among its numerous Image Songs, one called "Aoi Tori" (Blue Bird). It's a Kaori Yae image song, in which the blue bird is the symbol of the main protagonist, who came into Kaori's wounded heart, telling her she's not alone, and bringing her happiness and love.
-   The _Mother_ theme song "Pollyanna" has the following verse:
    
    _I believe there'll come a day  
    Maybe it will be tomorrow.  
    When the blue bird flies away  
    All we have to do is follow (it).  
    I believe a dream can still come true,  
    Why shouldn't I believe the same in you?_
    
-   Inverted nastily in _Odin Sphere_. While the bluebird Spirit Advisor which gives voice to all of Gwendolyn's self-doubt repeatedly throughout Book 1 is never named, it might as well be called the Bluebird of Unhappiness given how viciously it mocks and berates her. It's actually the spirit of her dead sister Griselda.
    -   Oswald's chapter has a more straightforward example: Hindel, before being struck down by Oswald, advises him to seek out a "blue bird". When he finds himself in the Netherworld, he sees a brief glimpse of a blue bird that gives him the hope and strength needed to fight his way out. He later believes the blue bird to be Gwendolyn, whom he met on the battlefield, with whom he fell in love, and whose hand in marriage he is offered by Odin.
-   Played With in _Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War_, or rather in its Show Within a Show _A Blue Dove for the Princess_: in this case, it's the Blue Dove who goes out on a quest to find a cure for the sick Princess, only to discover that he should have stayed with her all along upon return.
-   _Harvest Moon_:
    -   _Story of Seasons_ games have you propose to your spouse with a blue feather. While many games simply have you buy the feather from the store (apparently the grocer knows _everyone's_ business and knows when he needs to start stocking feathers) or have the Mayor give it to you, some mention the bird by name and at least one makes you climb a mountain in order to find the bird and pick up a feather it's moulted.
    -   In _Harvest Moon: Light of Hope_, you receive the blue feather for free from a bluebird that is the (blue-haired) Harvest Goddess in bird form). It's stated that people literally can't get the feather by force.
-   One of Chihaya Kisaragi's Image Songs in _The Idolmaster_ is "Aoi Tori" (Bluebird in Japanese).
-   _Final Fantasy XIV_ has the bluebird minion that can only be obtained from treasure coffers that are found by digging them up or within the Aquapolis treasure dungeon (though you can buy it from other players if you can afford it). The description states that the bluebird brings good fortune to anyone who already experienced it. Naturally, the minion is a very rare drop.
    -   The _Endwalker_ expansion introduces the character Meteion, a girl with Mercury's Wings on her head, tail feathers down her back and talons for feet as well as blue clothes, blue hair and blue eyes coupled with the ability to transform into an actual blue bird. She's also The Empath and was tasked by her creator with finding out what other people out there in the universe live for, what gives their lives meaning, and what fills their lives with hope and happiness. The realization that the premise of the question is flawed and the vast majority of the universe is in fact "inhabited" by the ruins and remains of civilizations that were unable or outright _unwilling_ to keep living breaks her so badly that her color scheme is replaced with one of gloomy gray and black despair and turns her into a Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds.
-   _World of Warcraft_: In the Valley of the Four Winds in Pandaria you can find blue feathers and turn them to some of the inhabitants to heighten your friendship with them. This comes into full effect when you give them to Old Hillpaw
    
    "...My Son Tai... he used to collect these as a little boy. When his Mother died, I told him they were messages from her, fallen from the heavens." <Old Hillpaw falls into a quiet silence>

-   Zigzagged in _Over the Garden Wall_ with Beatrice. She helps Wirt and Greg find their way to Adelaide and the way home, but is relentlessly sarcastic about nearly everything. She, alongside her family, was also transformed into a bluebird after throwing a rock at one, and is leading the two to the villainous Adelaide in exchange for the reversal of the curse. She eventually warms up to the kids, and defeats Adelaide and later helps Wirt rescue Greg from the Beast. Discussed when a tavern-keeper tries to kick Beatrice out when she sees her as bad luck.
    
    **Beatrice:** Bluebirds are good luck! We bring joy and happiness!  
    **Tavern-Keeper:** _\[hits her with a broom\]_ Good luck, bad luck, I don't need any of it!
    
-   Inverted with _extreme_ prejudice in the _Cybersix_ episode "The Bluebirds of Horror," with bluebirds being prominent among the Feathered Fiends pulling a Whole-Plot Reference to _The Birds_, up to and including the Monster of the Week, which resembles a giant, anthropomorphic, monster bluebird.
