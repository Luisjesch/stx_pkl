_"Even the stutter, certainly genuine but still a bit laid on, had been turned to advantage. It was the master trick, that stutter; for it contrived to make her banalities sound somehow original, and secondly, despite her tallness, her assurance, it served to inspire in male listeners a protective feeling. To illustrate: Berman had to be pounded on the back because she said, 'Who can tell me w-w-where is the j-j-john?'; then, completing the cycle, he offered an arm to guide her himself."_

In romantic relationships, flaws and imperfections often make a person more attractive and serve as an additional "turn on". It could be a Speech Impediment, a limp, a dyslexia that results in a lot of spelling mistakes, a curse that causes the person to speak with a Verbal Tic, the fact that the person is a walking dead creature rather than a living human — basically, whatever that is generally considered an imperfection. The reasons for such a reaction are many and varied: it could be the protective feeling inspired by the handicap, the admiration of a person's courage and tenacity in dealing with it, or just the fact that this flaw makes them unique. On the part of the person who has the imperfection, it's a frequent reason for Keeping the Handicap.
