Werewolves are almost always depicted as savage, bloodthirsty monsters that relentlessly stalk their prey during nights of the full moon and have little in the way of morality. However, "almost" is the key word. Some werewolves are friendly and easy to get along with.

How and why a certain werewolf, or pack of werewolves, acts with kindness varies, although at least some of it may be traced back to mankind's longstanding relationship with dogs. For thousands of years, humans have bred domestic dogs to be friendly, loyal, and obedient. Since werewolves are canine creatures, it's fairly easy to assign them dog-like personality traits (i.e. licking other people's faces, playing fetch, etc.), especially in more comedic works. Another reason for friendly werewolves may just be the recent trend towards portraying traditionally evil or malicious creatures/monsters as benign or even heroic. Yet another reason may be because of wolves being seen in a positive light in recent years, as they became better understood by science.

Can be either Funny Animal or Wolf Man depending on the story.

Compare and related to Chummy Mummy, Delightful Dragon, Friendly Ghost, Friendly Neighborhood Vampire, Friendly Skeleton, Friendly Zombie, and Noble Wolf. Contrast with Savage Wolves. May overlap with Werewolves Are Dogs if the werewolf behaves like a Big Friendly Dog.

    -   Rowan Redfern (herself a Friendly Neighborhood Vampire) states that most werewolves are misunderstood or unfairly branded as savage killers, and that most are noble beings who hunt only to feed and wish to be left in peace. Although this is true of some werewolves, Rowan is perhaps overly optimistic or naive, seeing as a few werewolves in the series are shown to be bloodthirsty murderers (including the murderder of her own great aunt, who later tries to kill her brother), albeit this is due to individual moral failings rather than a species-wide issue.

Whenever he has the chance, he tries to reason with the Monster of the Week rather than attacking them.

-   _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_: Can potentially be enforced by the player after completing the quest "The Silver Hand" of the Companions guild, where the Dovahkiin gets initiated into the Companions' inner circle by becoming a werewolf. Although the city guards will always attack the Dovahkiin in their werewolf form, netting the Dovahkiin a bounty if they fight back and kill any of the guards or are seen transforming, no such penalty incurs when the player is exploring any area where only hostile NPCs spawn.

-   _Love of Magic_: Bella is a werewolf, and only changes if she loses control of her emotions, which she generally keeps a tight rein on.

-   _Sonic Unleashed_: Sonic undergoes lycanthropy for the duration of the game, turning into a werehog at night. Despite the transformation being the result of Sonic accidentally absorbing the energy of Dark Gaia, Sonic's heroic and kind personality is not changed in the slightest when becoming the werehog due to his incredible Heroic Willpower, and he actively makes use of the form's Super-Strength and stretchy arms to fight Dark Gaia Monsters.
-   _Terraria_: The Zoologist, one of the NPCs that may show up to assist the player, is a werefox who's known to undergo full lycanthropy during the full moon or Blood Moon.

    Webcomics 

-   _Adapting to Night_: Derpy's backstory reveals she fell in love with a were-_pony_ who was friendly and didn't want to hurt anyone. In fact, he was part of a colony that were full of these who just wanted to live in peace, having even lived in isolation so as not to frighten anyone. This softened her Van Helsing Hate Crimes attitude and she eventually married him and had Dinky. Sadly, her brother Sky couldn't accept it, having never moved past their parents being killed by a monster. In his zealotry, he committed genocide on the whole colony, Derpy's husband included.
-   _Dominic Deegan_: Milov Danovich. While all of his people (the residents of the Winter Archipelago) can become werewolves, and none of them seem to suffer from the negative traits usually ascribed to "creatures of the night" (they can change at will, it doesn't cause pain, they retain sentience and memories while transformed, they don't have an unnatural bloodlust), some of them (especially the younger members) act like arrogant jocks while many (especially the elder members) tend to look down on humans and other races, so as a whole they don't completely fit the trope. Milov himself, however, is introduced early on in the webcomic as a heroic figure, fighting against necromancers, demons, and other evil magic-users or creatures alongside the beautiful Lady Jayden, the White Magic priestess whom he protects and loves deeply. While he can be suspicious of strangers, has a temper (though only set off by true villains and threats to Jayden, for the most part), and can be vitriolic with some of his friends, by and large he is a warm, compassionate, generous fellow who can always be counted on when the going gets tough. And as a spellwolf (a werewolf who can do magic—most can't—strengthened by the power of the moon), that is incredibly often; even if he does suffer from the Worf Effect a great deal, he's one of the more powerful side characters, is dedicated to his pack and his duty, and remains one of Dominic's True Companions right to the end of the comic.
-   _Grrl Power_: Gregor the were-dire wolf is a powerful being on the Twilight Council who represents theranthropes and protects humans from supernatural threats. Sydney also finds his Wolf Man form to be irresistibly cute, because he is fluffy.
-   _Spinnerette:_ Werewolf of London, Ontario (usually just goes by London) is a werewolf who's an all around Nice Guy who works as a superhero for the Legion of Canadian Superheroes.

    Web Original 

-   _They Are Smol_: The Dorarizins are alien predators who resemble huge wolf-men. Luckily, they think we're adorable. Human body odor is chemically very similar to the pheromones very young Dorarizin pups exude, meaning they catch a whiff of us and every nerve starts screaming "protect the child" at them.

    Web Video 

-   _Acquisitions Incorporated: The "C" Team_: During the "Doomgate Inn" arc, the party befriends a young werewolf named Trevor who is shunned from his cousin's eponymous inn because, being a werewolf, he interferes with the patrons' vampire cosplay party.

    Western Animation 

-   Wilford Wolf of _Animaniacs_ is a generally dorky Funny Animal by day, but when the full moon comes out, he hulks up in a Fabio-esque hunk of a werewolf who possesses a charming disposition, basically giving resident sex symbol Minerva Mink a taste of her own medicine. While he never appears again, it wasn't uncommon for them to be depicted as a couple.

-   _Casper's Scare School_: The young werewolf Wolfie is rather sweet to his friends as long as he's not under a full moon, as he'll become a snarling beast then. His easygoing nature is actually a plot point in "Fleshed Out," where it's revealed that if he goes too long without getting angry, he'll become a human. Sadly, Wolfie Took a Level in Jerkass starting in season two.
-   _Danny Phantom_: Wulf is a pretty friendly, Esperanto-speaking _ghost_ werewolf. Walker offers to release him if he assists in capturing Danny Phantom, but instead Wulf becomes the ghost boy's friend. Makes you wonder what they imprisoned him for in the first place (though, knowing Walker, he could have had any petty excuse).
-   _Drak Pack_: Howler is a heroic descendant of the Wolf Man.
-   _Fangface_: The titular Fangface is a werewolf who helps his human friends catch other monsters. He does, however, occasionally lose control and try to eat them - particularly his best friend Puggsy, who is quite literally his Chew Toy. This is all played for laughs.

-   _OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes_: Enid's werewolf father Bernard is a loving dad and husband.
-   _Sabrina and The Groovie Goolies_: During one episode, Sabrina visits Horrible Hall, home to a collection of movie monsters.

Wolfie and the other Hall residents are mostly harmless and usually glad to have company. They even have their own band, which plays Once an Episode, with Wolfie playing a stringed instrument similar to a horizontal lyre.
-   In the episode “Who's Afraid Of The Big, Bad Wolf?” in Tangled: The Series, Rapunzel discovers that the young girl Catalina/Red is the werewolf that has been stalking the village at night. However it is revealed she meant no harm and only transformed into a werewolf because she felt unheard and had been repressing her frustration. Once her sister Angry/Kiera apologizes and promises to listen to her more she becomes docile and even gives Rapunzel and her friends a ”Wolf-hug”.
