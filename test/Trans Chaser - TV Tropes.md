The Trans Chaser is a cisgender character who has a strong sexual interest in transgender or gender-nonconforming people; however, their attraction has no romantic element, and is often little more than a sexual fetish. The most common portrayal is of an (ostensibly) straight cisgender male who surreptitiously hooks up with transgender women or cross-dressers. If Played for Laughs, it usually involves a subversion of an Unsettling Gender-Reveal, where he reacts a little _too_ positively upon learning that the women he's with is transgender. More serious works may insinuate that the Trans Chaser is a Closet Gay, and that having sex with someone who resembles a cisgender woman is the best way he can rationalize his attraction without having to question his heterosexuality.

The context of this trope has usually changed over the decades. Until the 2000s or so, this depiction was often no more nuanced than Fetishes Are Weird, with it being a point of shame that the chaser is such a sexual deviant. But from the 2010s onward, where public attitudes about transgender rights began to shift, the Trans Chaser is far more likely to be depicted as an Armored Closet Gay—if not an outright Politically Incorrect Villain—who is openly homophobic or transphobic, but hypocritically has no problem having sex with trans people. Of course, the vast majority of works featuring this trope only focus on the chaser—it's very rare to see an work examining the perspective of a trans character being fetishized outside of a specific subset of Queer Media.

Compare Everybody Wants the Hermaphrodite, Bigot with a Crush, Armored Closet Gay, Race Fetish, and Sex Is Evil, and I Am Horny. May overlap with Asian Hooker Stereotype, with countries like Thailand having a stereotype of being a hotbed of Sex Tourism for people looking for "ladyboys."
