_"In a period of industrial development and modernization in urban areas, logging remained a traditional business in which the workers exhibited pride in their craft, their physical strength and masculinity, and guarded their individualism. Their camps were a bastion of the traditional workplace as they defied modern rationalized management, and built a culture around masculinity."_

Lumberjacks are commonly used to represent strength, man's dominance over nature, and the idea that axes are pretty cool. In fiction they tend to be badass, often to the point of Testosterone Poisoning. Either that, or to sell paper towels.

Because people will expect a lumberjack to be manly, they are almost always men. They tend to dress like a stereotypical 19th century Paul Bunyan type with a flannel shirt, rugged outdoorsman look, some Manly Facial Hair, and large muscles developed from years of swinging an axe. The much rarer female lumberjack will either be a Butch Lesbian and Played for Laughs, or look exactly like a normal girl wielding a giant axe, with her lumberjack heritage used to Handwave her insane Super-Strength.

Occasionally seen in a log-rolling contest. Often found roaming the forests of Canada, Eh?.

However, he is the definition of Emotional Bruiser, to the point of crying himself rusted over accidentally crushing a bug. The reason his body is made of tin?

    Now a lot of people would be intimidated in a situation like this...I was not. I am what I am, play my piano, and sing my little songs. I looked him right in the eye and I said, I'm a logger - just up from Coos Bay, Oregon. Been toppin' trees - quite possibly the toughest man in the entire world.
    

    Oral Tradition 

-   Paul Bunyan is the Ur-Example, having originated in Canada in the early 19th century. There are many myths surrounding him, the most famous of which is that the 10,000 Lakes of Minnesota were formed by him and his sidekick, Babe the Blue Ox, as they walked around in a blizzard. It's worth noting that most of the Paul Bunyan myth, including everything about Paul being a giant with a giant pet ox, was actually the invention of a 20th century copywriter who spun Paul Bunyan into a mascot for a logging company.

    Print Media

The character can be seen wrestling a bear representing the Boston Bruins in a series of short films.
-   Averted with the Northern Arizona Lumberjacks football team — despite the name, they don't use the idea of being lumberjacks to scare opponents, they instead use the city's elevation as intimidation tactics (at 7000 feet above sea level, though, altitude sickness is very real and if you're not used to playing intense sports in those conditions it's definitely against you).

    Tabletop Games 

-   Reaper Miniatures produces a "Bill Foster, Lumberjack" model for their Chronoscope line.

    Video Games

-   In _Lumberwhack: Defend the Wild_, almost every single one of your enemies is a lumberjack of some sort that's trying to cut down your forest, several of which wear checkered flannel shirts and sport rugged looks. The "mightiest" ones would be the Giant Choppers, who are larger than the rest, have a good amount of health, hit hard and stun your animals with their dual axes.
-   The first level of _Ninja: Shadow of Darkness_ contains lumberjack enemies, near the end of the forest; as Kurosawa the Ninja tries crossing a forest path, trees start collapsing all around him which he must swiftly dodge, and at the end of the route he's beset by a group of lumberjacks who set up the trap for him. These enemies only show up right here, however, and nowhere else in the entire game.

    **Amy:** He's dressed like a tragic modern men's fashion lumberjack.  
    **Shelley:** Beard wax, muscles and plaid? I'm contrite, but _also into it._
    
-   In _Invincea And The Warriors From Hell_, Torvin, the man who rescues and adopts the infant Invincea, is a rural woodsman and embodies the ultimate lumberjack.
-   _Miss Abbott and the Doctor_: Andreas tries to act and dress this when he runs off to become a hermit after thinking Cati rekindled her love with Kuarahy, her first boyfriend. But his middle-class upbringing means he's not that outdoors-y, unable to fully chop wood with an axe.
