_"They don't build porn stars anymore. Everyone with a camera can be in porn, and most of them are. There are no $100,000+ features made, and they don't build up porn stars. The day of free porn is here, all over the internet, A production company can't invest into a star anymore or a feature movie anymore."_

— **Jeff Stryker**

Not so much a Porn trope, although it's certainly there.

Alice and Bob, deciding to spice up their relationship, film themselves having sex. Or take pictures of each other naked.

In comedies, at some point, hilarity generally will ensue. The tape may unintentionally get broadcast, sent to the wrong person, or seen by people who are shocked.

In horror and thrillers, the movie may be recorded without consent or it may be the prelude to blackmail or other threats. In drama, the unwanted release of such a tape may be a motive for murder. Often done because the person needs the money, and if not actually the basis for murder, at the very least used for blackmail.

This is Truth in Television, and the most infamous cases are when famous people do it.

What the video _actually_ contains is their break-up.

    Webcomics 

-   _Sticky Dilly Buns_: The trope shows up more than once in the variant "collection of stills" version:
    -   Zii collects pictures of past sexual conquests on her phone, including pairs of men she's drawn into threesomes. (Which is indeed the kind of behavior that readers have long since come to expect from her in the predecessor comic, _Ménage à 3_.) The more ethical Ruby finds these very appealing, but immediately comments on the problem of consent.
    -   Despite that moral code, Ruby can't resist photographing Dillon teaching Ray the art of kissing for acting purposes. She later nervously admits to this, and is pleased when everyone just tells her that she has a good eye for such photography — which is typical of most of the cast, and amusing from Ray himself, who would do anything to get on as an actor.
    -   Likewise, Ramona photographs Dillon when he's explaining the art of oral sex and illustrating with a popsicle.
    -   Dillon too has a collection of snaps of attractive men on his phone, though most of them are probably relatively innocent images of clothed men in public — but taken more or less surreptitiously.

-   Not quite _home_, but on _Sealab 2021_, when Stormy asked the ASHDTV to show him porno bloopers, it showed him one featuring Debbie and, based on context clues, Hesh. Debbie was more offended that the guys didn't think her breasts were real.
-   Subverted in _The Simpsons_ — Bart finds a tape marked "Homer and Marge Get Dirty", and plays it for Lisa hoping to traumatize her. It turns out its just footage of the two carving pumpkins for Halloween and getting covered in pumpkin pulp as a result.

-   In _Reconstructing Amelia_, the Magpies, an unauthorized club of girls at the Grace Hall private school, take nude photos of themselves as part of a group activity and put them up online so people can vote on them.

-   As early as 1938, the _Sir Henry Merrivale_ crime novel _The Judas Window_ has a plot point in which a female character is blackmailed using sexual photos of her taken with her consent by an ex-boyfriend.

    Live-Action TV 

-   An especially cruel version on _All My Children_, when Gloria taped her tryst with her lover Craig and threatened to show it to his wife Dixie unless he gave her money. When her boyfriend discovered this, he was so enraged at her infidelity—adding insult to injury, Dixie was his sister—that he raped her and threatened _her_ with revealing the tape should she dare to press charges (this took place at a time when a rape victim's sexual history could be used to discredit her story).
    -   A savvier version from the same show when Arlene blackmailed her son-in-law Alec into an affair and taped their trysts as an insurance policy, warning him that if he killed her, the police would find the tape and know his motive. Sure enough, he tried, assuming she was bluffing. . .and it was found.
-   In _Bones_, Brennan and Booth are the death of a highschool boy on a private school campus, who was the son of the Venezuelan ambassador. They discover a sextape with showing him and another student, and they confront her with it.

However, upon further inspection they realize that, within the film, she looked directly at the camera. Turns out she actually seduced him (and filmed it with another student helping) with the intention of blackmailing him and his father. However, the boy was going to turn them in to the headmaster, so they murdered him.

    -   One episode has a serial killer targeting men. One of the victims made a habit of secretly recording his sexual conquests and circulating the videos among his friends. One friend smugly tells the team that a loophole in the law means that a visual-only video does not require the woman's consent, so since he didn't record the sound, they can't do anything. His tune changes _fast_ when Kate points out that one of the women being a few months shy of her eighteenth birthday would make the whole group guilty of possession of child pornography.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  It's unclear whether the unsub knew about this habit specifically, but she was killing men who failed to live up to her romantic ideal, so it's very possible that finding the camera set her off.
-   In a third-season episode of _Defiance_, Berlin has sex with Tommy while recording the whole thing on a camera (the same camera she uses for her propaganda videos). Tommy is a bit worried, but Berlin points out that there's no risk, since the Internet hasn't been around in decades. When Tommy claims that Berlin's boss (the town mayor) could see it, she brushes him off, explaining that Pottinger only cares out his own looks, not Berlin's naked ass (she is glad that Tommy cares about the latter, though).

-   Shows up several times on _Midsomer Murders_ usually as blackmail material followed by murder.
-   _Mosley_ (about Sir Oswald Mosley). The mistress of the title character takes a photograph of Mosley naked at the beach. When Mosely dumps her after she becomes pregnant she gives the photo to his political opponents, endangering his political career.
-   _The Murders_: Played for Drama when Kate gets sent a recording of her having sex with Pete (audio only), and initially thinks he made this, angrily ending their relationship because he didn't ask permission for that. However, it turns out he didn't do it, and she becomes anxious that she's the victim of a stalker. It turns out to be even worse, as it's a _serial killer_ who recorded them.

The video shows up in the follow-up film, although the footage is different (for rating reasons).
