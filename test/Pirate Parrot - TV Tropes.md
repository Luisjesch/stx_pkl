They'll make you _squawwwwwk_ the plank!

_"He's a mute, sir. Poor devil had his tongue cut out, so he trained the parrot to talk for him...no one's yet figured_ how_."_

Diabolical Masterminds have the Right-Hand Cat. Pirate Captains have the Pirate Parrot. Expect these colorful feathered companions to be chatty and demand crackers. Pirate Parrots usually ride on the shoulder of their pirate owner.

The parrot may or may not:

-   Be named "Polly".
-   Ask for crackers, "Polly wants a cracker, Polly wants a cracker".
-   Say something about "pieces of eight" (a Spanish dollar or piastre — a large silver coin worth eight reals).

In Real Life, it is not known if many pirates actually kept parrots for pets. Parrots are high-maintenance animals that serve no benefit on a ship (unlike, for example, cats, which keep the vermin population down). However, there are records of the occasional (non-pirate) Caribbean sailor keeping parrots and even monkeys as pets, so it's not too unlikely. The whole concept of a pirate and his parrot companion likely started with _Treasure Island_. And parrots in Real Life do naturally prefer to stand on a person's shoulder. It's also worth noting that at a certain point of time pet parrots commanded huge prices in Europe, so it is not inconceivable for a sailor wanting to settle down to trade in several parrots as a retirement benefit of sorts (parrots do tend to have large lifespans, sometimes surpassing even humans), probably leaving one to himself — which is probably where it all started.

Sometimes, the parrots are pirates themselves, much in the same vein as other Animal Occupation Stereotypes such as construction worker beavers, miner moles and gophers, boxer kangaroos, firefighter Dalmatians, martial artist pandas, and sailor ducks, gulls, otters, crabs, penguins, seals, and polar bears.

Expect some amount of Misplaced Wildlife. Cockatoos, for example, come from Australia and Indonesia, and would be far less likely on the shoulder<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  of a Caribbean pirate than a macaw or amazon parrot of Central and South America. Then again, most animated parrots are some strange conglomeration of psittacine characteristics rather than realistic: macaw-shaped and colored, Amazon-sized, with a cockatoo crest. In a Space Pirate setting, expect the "parrot" to be an alien or a robot. For Sky Pirates, it could be either a normal parrot or a steampunk-styled Clockwork Creature.

Related tropes include Dressed to Plunder, Parrot Pet Position, and Feather Boa Constrictor. In a setting with anthropomorphic animals, the pirates can be anthropomorphic parrots themselves, though wouldn't count as a Semiaquatic Species Sailor. See All Witches Have Cats for another animal in a similar position to another popular figure in fictional stories.

    Advertising 

-   This Geico commercial features a pirate captain's parrot, who begins saying less-than-complimentary things about the crew, which puts the captain in hot water with them.
-   An advertisement for a pirate-themed exhibition at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science had a parrot sqwarking away in this trope to a snoozing bloodhound.
    
    "Get me a cracker or I'll dunk you from the yardarm, lazy seadog!"
    

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Captain Harlock_, as a proud Space Pirate, owns not a parrot but a strange alien bird — with black feathers, a long beak and a thread-thin neck — that pretty much cover the same role, up to mimicking human speech and sometimes riding on his shoulder.
-   On _Cowboy Bebop_, Vicious has an exotic bird perched on his right shoulder most of the time. This only heightens his mystique (and overall evil aura). It's a cormorant (a kind of sea bird that has acidic droppings and a nasty temper). This, combined with the fact that he blows it up in one of the final episodes, probably does say something about Vicious. It's inspired by Harlock's bird, noted above.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Doraemon_ shorts, if they're pirate-themed, tends to have parrots flying around at random. And then there's two of the movies:
    -   _Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas_, the first pirate-themed adventure, have the main villain Cash having a parrot minion who tries to thwart the heroes' escape from Cash's lair in the climax. The gang's new friend, Jack the pirate-boy, managed to silence the parrot by tying it's beak with his scarf.
    -   _Doraemon: Nobita's Treasure Island_, the second pirate-themed adventure in the series, have Flock's Robot Buddy Quiz, a robotic parrot who's a gift created by his father, the dreaded pirate captain Silver — long before Silver's Heel–Face Turn. Said parrot is one hell of a gadfly who couldn't stop trolling and dope slaping Doraemon and gang though.
-   _Gundam_: The manga _Mobile Suit Crossbone Gundam_ gives The Captain a robot parrot as part of their fully embracing the "pirate" part of Space Pirate. Said parrot spouts random lines that reference older _Gundam_ works, leading to the theory that it was made from Amuro Ray's Team Pet and _Gundam_ Series Mascot Haro.
-   Amazingly, _One Piece_ has, up to yet, averted this, despite being all about pirates. And considering the series' track record, if one ever does show up, it will most likely be the single most awesome parrot ever seen.
    -   The closest to this trope thus far is Doma's, one of Whitebeard's New World allies, trained gun-using Monkey.
    -   There's also Rob Lucci's pet bird, who speaks entirely for him while he's undercover while Lucci passes himself off as being mute. Lucci isn't a pirate, though he is a criminal after Spandam throws him under the bus, but as a marine assassin he's probably done his share of sailing.
-   In the _Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea_ movie, the pirate villain "The Phantom" had a Chatot (parrot Pokémon) on his shoulder.
-   In episode 40b of _Tamagotchi_, everyone is cast as sea creatures and pirates for a story where Lovelin the mermaid wants to become a human (erm, land Tamagotchi, but the idea is basically the same otherwise) to join Mametchi the pirate captain. Mametchi has a parrot played by Telelin on his shoulder.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_ foe Cap'n Fear had a robotic parrot that randomly recorded and repeated phrases spoken near it.
-   Subverted by Captain Boone of _De Cape et de Crocs_, who has a shoulder chicken (that he insists never talks because it's lost its voice), leading to some awkwardness when he and his crew see some actual parrots and he doesn't know what they are. Later he gets a parrot-shaped mechanical bird that can repeat messages... which are known as chickens (a very old-fashioned term for a love letter, and later any letter, which the clockwork birds have replaced) by the locals.
-   A strip in _The Dandy_ back in the 30s starred a highly intelligent cockatoo who constantly had to drag her idiotic pirates out of trouble. The title was _Cocky-Sue the Cockatoo: She's the Brains of the Pirate Crew_.
-   _Deadpool_ forced Bob to wear a parrot costume and squawk like a parrot during their short stint as pirates.
-   In _Five Ghosts_, there's a brief scene of a sailor discussing his pet parrot. It can't talk, or at least hasn't learned any phrases yet, and he's a little tired of people being so surprised by this. Later another sailor is told by his buddy that he should get a pet parrot, cuz they're good company.
-   _Jonah Hex_: Though not a pirate himself, marauding Bandito El Papagayo ("The Parrot") was so named for his choice of pet.
-   Parodied in a _José Carioca_ cover, where José has gone to a costume party dressed as a pirate, but since he _is_ a parrot, he has a small human pirate on his shoulder instead.
-   In _The Skull of Agarash_, a graphic novel set in the _Lone Wolf_ world, Captain Khadro, pirate ruler of the Lakuri Isles, has a small winged reptile looking like a tiny dragon as Pirate Parrot. It is in fact a Liganim, the shapeshifting Familiar of a Nadziran, the Black Wizard currently possessing Khadro.
-   In _Lullaby_, Jim Hawkins gained a parrot (with an absurdly large beak) sometime before his captain booted him from the ship. Its name is "Crew"; he's got a pegleg and an eyepatch, and carries Jim's flag on his back.
-   The second issue of the _Madballs_ comic book published by Marvel Comics subsidiary Star Comics had the Madballs go back in time and encounter a pirate named Captain Weirdbeard. Weirdbeard had a parrot lackey named McCaw.
-   The Black Terror's heroic identity was, in-universe, inspired by a book on pirates, and he wears a costume modeled after a Jolly Roger flag. The _Project Superheroes_ version of the character has a sidekick called Parrot, who wears a colorful bird costume.
-   Matilda in _Randomveus_ has a large pet parrot — that somehow has a mustache.
-   Ruthless modern pirate Mojo in the story "How Daphne lost her Mojo (and got it back!)" in the graphic novel _Sex Ed 101_ by Enrique Villagran, has a parrot who comments on the action.
-   Sadly Wonder Woman didn't get a parrot that time she became a Space Pirate revolutionary for several months in _Wonder Woman (1987)_, however the human woman who was abducted and joined the revolution alongside her acquired a slightly feathery looking alien lizard.
-   In _Y: The Last Man_, buxom captain Kilina prefers a female Capuchin monkey to a parrot, because birds are too cliché.

    Comic Strips 

-   In _Nodwick_, a ninja-pirate captain has a ninja-parrot on his shoulder (holding a shuriken in its beak).

    Fan Works 

-   In _This Bites!_, Soundbite, the Transponder Snail who ate the Noise-Noise Fruit, is the closest thing possible to this, being a part of the Straw Hat Pirates, as well as a wisecracker who can mimic any sound he hears and usually sits on the Self-Insert's shoulder. This was lampshaded when Cross referred to him as "Polly" while trying to pass him off as a regular Transponder Snail and saying he used ventriloquism.

    Films — Animation 

-   Iago from Disney's _Aladdin_ is worth mentioning, even though his master Jafar is an Evil Sorcerer and not a pirate... Then in _Aladdin and the King of Thieves_ he goes off with Cassim, Aladdin's long-lost father and former leader of a band of thieves who would occasionally use ships.
-   _My Little Pony: The Movie_: Captain Celaeno and her crew are pirates who ARE parrots. Logically, they are specifically Sky Pirates.
-   _The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists_ features Polly, who is really the last dodo.
-   The Captain in _Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure_ has a pet parrot.
-   The villains of _Rio_, though technically not pirates, actually both own a sulphur-crested cockatoo named Nigel.
-   In _Tom and Jerry: The Movie_ there's Captain Kiddie's parrot Squawk, though Kiddie isn't a pirate and Squawk is just a handpuppet (albeit a seemingly sentient one).
-   In _Treasure Planet_, Long John Silver's pet is a small shapeshifting creature called Morph, who could mimic people in more ways than one.
-   Taken to a ridiculous degree in the direct-to-video movie _Tom and Jerry: Shiver Me Whiskers_, where each of the three pirate captains have a parrot that matches their color scheme. The red and blue pirate captains talk only in growls, which their parrots then translate. It's the opposite with the purple pirate, who can speak perfect English, but can't translate his parrot's growling.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Silent film _The Black Pirate_ makes sure to show a pirate with a parrot on his shoulder as part of the scurvy crew. They also wind up capturing a monkey.
-   The following exchange occurs in _Down Periscope_, during the "walk the plank" sequence, which has a large percentage of the Stingray's crew playing pirate:
    
    **Buckman:** Nitro, isn't that one of my chickens? _\[indicating very dead plucked chicken tied to Nitro's shoulder\]_  
    **Nitro Mike:** No, it's a, uh, parrot, uhh, from the Caribbean.  
    **Buckman:** Well don't let it fly away, that's supper.  
    **Nitro Mike:** Arr.
    
-   Captain Hook and his crew of pirates finally get one in the 2003 film _Peter Pan_. (This trope had been averted in previous adaptations.)
-   The _Pirates of the Caribbean_ trilogy:

        **Captain Jack Sparrow:** Mr. Cotton's... parrot. Same question.
        
    -   The parrot's repetition leads to a hilarious scene in the second movie:
        
        **Parrot:** Don't eat me! Don't eat me!  
        **Will:** I'm not going to eat you...  
        **Parrot:** DON'T EAT ME! DON'T EAT ME!

    Gamebooks 

-   In book 4 of the _GrailQuest_ series, _Voyage of Terror_, while lost in Mythological Ancient Greece, you can meet with Long John Silver — or at least a pirate pretending to be him. He naturally has a parrot on his shoulder. However, if you decide to fight him, you'll find out that the parrot is a rare breed that's indeed one of the toughest monsters of the book.
-   _Fighting Fantasy_:
    -   The titular pirate villain of _Bloodbones_ has a pet parrot named Jezebel as his sidekick; in the final battle as you duel against Captain Bloodbones, Jezebel will actively assist her owner by ambushing you and trying to claw your eyes out (causing some unavoidable damage to your STAMINA and reducing your Attack Strength each round).
    -   _Master of Chaos_ begins with you as a galley-slave on a pirate ship, and the captain's parrot will try annoying you repeatedly while you're toiling away at the oars. In a surprising example of Gamebook Cruelty Potential, you're given an option to squash said parrot with your bare hands... and suffer no penalty for your actions.

    Literature 

-   Though pirates are not featured anywhere in the stories, Harold of _Bunnicula_ reads about pirates and wonders whether a "parrot" is an umbrella or a female pirate. Chester puts him straight.
-   Parodied in the _Discworld_ novel _Going Postal_ with the Reacher Gilt's pirate costume ("That was a Look, wasn't it?") including a parrot (well, a cockatoo) that says "twelve and a half percent" (i.e. 1/8).
-   In _Fergus Crane_, Captain Smollet keeps a parrot called Bolivia, who is a Token Good Teammate and gets adopted by Fergus after the pirates' defeat.
-   In _Fortunately, the Milk_, the Queen of the Pirates has a parrot.
-   Comic inversion: In the sequence that gave stand-up comedian Mike Hardin's book _The Fourteen and a Half Pound Budgie_ its title, Hardin describes a parakeet that he's supposed to pet-sit as being "so nasty it had a _pirate_ on its shoulder."
-   Although the Free Traders of Andre Norton's _Solar Queen_ series are not pirates — more of unorthodox merchants — still their captain owns a small alien animal which looks like half-parrot-half-toad. That in addition to more conventional ship-cat.
-   The _Spellsinger_ novels have talking animals. In _Day of the Dissonance_ there's a pirate who _is_ a parrot. In _Time of the Transference_, that character's brother is introduced. He's a pirate parrot accountant.
-   In _Swallows and Amazons_, Nancy and Peggy's uncle, "Captain Flint", owns a parrot. Nancy and Peggy have often tried to teach it to say "Pieces of eight", and are disappointed that all it will say is "Pretty Polly".
-   Older Than Radio: This probably started (as most pirate-related tropes did) with Long John Silver, from _Treasure Island_, who had a parrot named Captain Flint. Also, Captain Flint's most common phrase is "Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!".
-   Inverted in _The Voyage of Alice_ (whose author also did research on actual piracy history and wrote books deconstructing pirate stereotypes). The pirates pointedly hunt down a parrot-like alien species in their Leave No Witnesses plan.
-   The pirate Littlejohn in James Thurber's _The Wonderful O_ has a parrot that annoys the book's Big Bad (by using words containing the letter "O"); notable for repeatedly being on the receiving end of the memorable threat, "I'll squck its thrug till all it can whubble is geep!"
-   Invoked in one of Timothy Zahn's stories, but not with an animal: Marines in Powered Armor wore shoulder-mounted weapons, apparently slaved to aim wherever the wearer's eyes focused, known as "parrot guns".

    Live-Action TV 

-   The _Blackadder_ episode "Potato" guest-stars Tom Baker as Captain Rum. He's not a pirate, but he has a _dead_ parrot lying on his shoulder.
-   In the _Doctor Who_ serial "The Pirate Planet" (written by Douglas Adams), the space pirate captain has a robot parrot with a blaster in its beak (the Polyphase Aviatron). It is destroyed off-screen by K9 (who then returns with the bird in its "mouth". Good dog!) According to Douglas Adams, he submitted that script to the _Doctor Who_ production office, and it was rejected. He later wrote in the robot parrot and re-submitted it, and it was accepted.
-   _Lost in Space_ episode "The Space Pirate". The title character, named Alonzo P. Tucker, has a robot parrot that sits on his shoulder. Tucker calls it an "esper" (E.S.P., "extra-sensory perception"?). Its eyes glow when it talks and it has psionic powers, such as apportation (teleporting an object from place to place).
-   _Monty Python's Flying Circus_ has sketches with pirates and parrots on their shoulders:
-   _RTL Samstag Nacht_ (German equivalent of _Saturday Night Live_) has the pretty wacky character Märchenman playing with this.

And his eyepatch on the mouth, and travels in a man-sized paper ship.
-   _Super Sentai_: Navi the robotic parrot in _Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger_. Also the one responsible for leading the team towards the Greatest Treasure in the Universe through vague clues that only come about after she hits her head on the ceiling.
-   _Ultraman Trigger: New Generation Tiga_ has the Space Pirate villain, Alien Barossa, who has a juvenile Zandrias (the kaiju equivalent to a parrot) perched on its shoulder the whole episode. Until Barossa's death that is, at which point the Zandrias decides to pull a Screw This, I'm Outta Here
-   _World's Dumbest..._ shows that this isn't limited to pirates — one clip features parrots employed by drug cartels to warn them when the police show up. As Wes Denning puts it, "Parrots need to stop hanging out with such shady characters."
-   _The Young Ones_ episode "Flood" had a cutaway scene with a literal pirate DJ (Robbie Coltrane) whose parrot kept making sarcastic remarks. The problem was, he couldn't see where the remarks were coming from because he wore an eyepatch — and he was a cyclops. When his bosun attempts to rightly blame the parrot for an insult, he denies owning one: "I hate the creatures! Horrible, small, furry things, hopping around, breeding and eating carrots!"

    Pinballs 

-   Polly from _Black Rose_, who gives a random Video Mode reward. Interestingly enough, you can kill her by Button Mashing the Fire button, getting 2 million points in the process.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   After _Pirates of the Caribbean_ took off, Rey Bucanero dressed up Zacarias, one of CMLL's Mini-Estrellas, as a parrot.

    Puppet Shows 

-   _The Muppet Show_:
    -   In the John Cleese episode, he was on _Pigs in Space_ as a space pirate and kept bickering with his parrot. He eventually threatened it with, "Quiet! Do you want to be an ex-parrot?"
    -   In the Glenda Jackson episode, the same puppet is used for Eric the Pirate Parrot, who "Captain Black Jackson" smuggles into the theatre disguised as a penguin.

    Theme Parks 

-   Disney Theme Parks: _Pirates of the Caribbean_ features several, including a skeletal one in the pirate caves, a parrot singing "A Parrot's Life for Me" alongside the pirates, a parrot providing the exit safety spiel, a green parrot named Peg Leg Pete (no relation) that once functioned as the mascot of the Florida version, and a parrot interacting with Jack Sparrow in the present version of Florida's finale.
-   The Europa-Park equivalent of _Pirates of the Caribbean_, _Piraten in Batavia_ (set in the Dutch East Indies), had an animatronic parrot with a pirate captain hat atop a street lamp greeting visitors at its entrance before the ride's destruction in a fire in 2018. The rebuilt ride that opened in 2020 has one inside instead.

-   You can find a parrot in _Dubloon_ in Atlan Island dungeon. Her function is to activate switches and collect keys found behind a wall or locked doors.
-   _Fallen London:_ Blue Prophets sometimes take the role for certain pirates, and one of them will certainly take the role for you if you chose the path of the Gaider's Mourn corsair. It bears mentioning that _these_ parrots have a lot more authority than you'd expect, and are often the ones calling targets for the pirates to sink and murder. It is said that Blue Prophets call out the names of those about to die, and this is true because they are _marking them for death_.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   Raz, a minor character from _Final Fantasy XII_, can always be seen with a small parrot over his head.
    -   The early game dungeon Sastasha from _Final Fantasy XIV_ is pirate-themed, so naturally the pirate captain Madison has a squawking companion whenever he shows up in it. Technically it's not a parrot, but a very talkative Colibri — small toucan-like beasts that often live in Eorzea's tropical climates. In the hard mode version of the dungeon, when the entire pirate crew has been turned into hideous beasts, this chatty bird is still loyal to the captain. If you're particularly lucky, though, you can win it as a shoulder-riding minion.

-   _Legend of Legaia_: In _Legaia II: Duel Saga_, Sharon has one, inherited from her late father and former captain of the pirates, Alphis. Completing a sidequest will lead to said parrot revealing the location of Alphis's treasure, including an extremely rare Heaven's Secret.
-   _The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night_: The Sky Pirate captain Skabb carries around two bat-winged parrots, Scratch and Sniff, on his shoulders. In a twist, they're actually far more intelligent than he is and are the real leaders of the pirate fleet.
-   _Little Alchemy_: The recipe for "parrot" is "pirate" + "bird".
-   _MacBat 64: Journey of a Nice Chap_: One of the NPCs you encounter is a parrot wearing a pirate hat.
-   _Monkey Island_: Parrots are seen throughout the series.
    -   _Monkey Island_ mocks this one (then it again, it mocks every Pirate trope possible), in the first game: Meathook keeps a classic parrot locked up because it's "scary". In _Escape from Monkey Island_, when asked what he wanted in a pirate Caricature, Guybrush can choose to say he wants a parrot when he adds the following:
        
        **Guybrush:** Nothing says "I'm a mighty pirate" like animal abuse.
        
    -   And then there is the half-magic parrot made of pyrite in _Tales of Monkey Island_. But what kind of idiot would actually carry that thing around?
        
        **Parrot:** \*Squawk\* It's me, Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate!

-   In the 1993 Edutainment Game _Redhook's Revenge_ one of the player characters **is a parrot** among humans. Poseidon the parrot captains his own ship and crew, competing for booty against some of the most notorious pirates to ever set sail, such as Blackbeard himself.
-   In _RuneScape_, a quest involving pirates allows you to get an "Ex-Ex-Parrot" as a pet.
-   Chosokabe Motochika from _Sengoku Basara_ owns a large yellow parrot that wears a bandana on its head. It's more intelligent than most of his crew and can apparently speak, though the only words it's been heard saying are "Motochika" and "treasure".
-   _Sid Meier's Pirates!_: If the barkeep doesn't have anything useful to say, he'll usually ask the main character "Where's your parrot?" This can get stupidly hilarious when you've actually modded parrots into the game.

-   In _Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves_, the major pirates are both parrots, in reference to this trope.
-   In _Terraria_, parrots are a type of enemy that can show up in the Pirate Invasion in Hardmode. Once you get the Pirate NPC, you can talk to him to buy a Parrot Cracker (the second-most expensive item in the game), which summons a passive version as a pet.
-   _A Very Long Rope to the Top of the Sky_: The Pirate's Clothes Flavor Text references the connection between pirates and parrots:

-   Your explorer can find a rather foul-mouthed one in _The Wager_.

-   Young Blood in his pirate appearance in _Danny Phantom_ has a skeletal one. Spent most of the time correcting pirate lingo and acting cynical. Later on, when he'd adopted a cowboy motif instead, it turned into a skeletal horse — apparently it's a shapeshifter that assumes the form of whatever animal it finds most appropriate for whatever identity its master has assumed. But it's a Servile Snarker in any form.
-   The _Doctor Who_ Animated Adaptation serial "The Infinite Quest" features Baltazhar, who supposedly is some kind of a intergalactic overlord, terror of the spaceways, but is dressed in a red and white stripey shirt, with a futuristic Hook Hand.

-   _The Fairly OddParents!_, "Odd-Pirates". Timmy, Poof, Wanda, and Cosmo encounter a pirate named Dirtybeard who is actually friendly but whose parrot is evil. Additionally, the sports team that Timmy wanted to see in the same episode, known as "The Pirates", have a parrot as a mascot.
-   _Family Guy_, episode "Long John Peter". Peter steals a parrot and starts carrying it around with him. He starts dressing as a pirate, recruits three other pirates and starts terrorizing the town. His parrot is severely injured during the fighting and later dies at the veterinarian's office.
-   An alien Space Pirate from _Futurama_ has three parrots — on three of his four shoulders.
-   _Futz!_: The pirate captain in "High Seas Futz" has a HUGE muscular parrot dressed in pirate garb.
-   Shipwreck from _G.I. Joe_ is a good guy, a dedicated sailor, and Loveable Rogue, with a talking parrot named Polly who never seems to shut up. The latest incarnation of Shipwreck in IDW comics continuity has a Polly of his own — in this case, a small flying drone. It's specifically meant to evoke the image of a pirate's pet parrot (for marketing purposes), but with an actual combat application.
-   _Jake and the Never Land Pirates_: The good pirates have the talkative parrot Skully on their team.
-   Captain Walker D. Plank from _James Bond Jr._. He fits the traditional pirate stereotype to the extent that even his parrot has an eyepatch and a wooden leg.
-   Parodied in the _Johnny Bravo_ episode "Moby Jerk", in which Captain Spleen had a different bird on his shoulder every time he was on camera (including a bucket of fried chicken at one point).
-   _Looney Tunes_: In the 1948 Warner Bros. cartoon "Buccaneer Bunny", "Sea-Goin' Sam" (a pirate version of Yosemite Sam) has a parrot that follows Bugs Bunny around pointing out his hiding places. Bugs asks the parrot "Polly want a cracker?", and when the parrot agrees, gives him a lit _fire_cracker. Bye bye Polly!

-   _The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack_: In "Ben-Boozled", the captain masquerading as a parrot (in paper-thin disquise) becomes the pet of another pirate who thinks he is the most beautiful bird he's ever seen.
-   Captain Hook has one named Short Tom in _Peter Pan & the Pirates_; it doesn't talk, but it got itself (and Hook's crew) into trouble a lot.
-   _The Pirates of Dark Water_:
    -   Niddler, a parrot-monkey thing is one of the main characters. He's kind of The Scrappy, but whatever.
    -   Also, one of the villains keeps a little parrot-like beast on his shoulder. In turn with the depiction of Merians using animals as devices, it is a living dictaphone, known as a "memorrot". What it knows becomes a plot point.
-   _The Real Ghostbusters_ episode "Sea Fright" had the heroes battle a crew of Ghost Pirates, the captain Jack Higgins having an _zombie_ parrot that drove him crazy. Captain Jack Higgins said sarcastically he'd kill it "if it weren't already dead."
-   In the _Rocko's Modern Life_ episode, Mr. Bighead starts sleepwalking, dreaming that he's a pirate. He sees Rocko's house as an enemy ship, and Spunky as a parrot, which he steals in order to extort a treasure map from Rocko.

-   _The Simpsons_:

    -   And of course, Pirate Captains use to write their treasure maps on crackers and give them to their parrots for safe keepin'. That's why there is treasure everywhere... well, according to Bart anyway.
-   On _SpongeBob SquarePants_, Patchy the Pirate has a parrot named Potty who he doesn't get along with at all.
-   _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ features Hondo Ohnaka, usually with a Kowakian Monkey Lizard on his shoulders.

-   Captain Clump, a one-episode character from _The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!_, had a parrot named Patches.
-   _Those Scurvy Rascals_: The pirates have a parrot with a very large beak.
