_"A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later."_

A character trope that typically occurs when someone is sexually assaulted or an attempt is made, but the person is saved or escapes, and then immediately expresses romantic or sexual interest in their savior or another love interest without displaying or having to deal with the expected signs of shock an/or trauma. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

In most cases, the assault is never mentioned again and the victim suffers no impact on their ability to engage in romance or sexuality. If the victim recalls or internalizes anything about the assault, it's only the gallantry of the one who saved them.

If the victim expresses no immediate romantic or sexual interest after the sexual assault but moves on without ever having to address the trauma, see Angst? What Angst?.

This trope is sometimes Played for Laughs. It is most prevalent when writers that are usually men either didn't consider or didn't want to realistically address how the assault would impact the victim, often because All Women Are Lustful or Rule of Sexy. Most commonly, it is employed to:

-   Advance the character's relationship with their love interest for a Relationship Upgrade.
-   "Cleanse" the victim of the Attempted Rape through Sex for Solace or Intimate Healing.
-   Introduce a new romantic interest to the protagonist as a "Meet Cute" combined with a Disposable Woman Stuffed into the Fridge while avoiding the need for pesky character development or romantic buildup.
-   Reward the protagonist's good deed of preventing Attempted Rape with Rescue Sex or Glad-to-Be-Alive Sex, courtesy of the victim they just rescued.

In most cases, the character receiving the assault victim's sexual or romantic interest waits at least one scene or chapter before indulging the victim's desire. If the victim is The Not-Love Interest or they are Just Friends, the receiver may reject the victim's advances altogether. In other cases, the receiver is Oblivious to Love or simply chooses not to appease the victim's desires until later in the story because The Women Are Safe with Us.

Women victims of sexual assault are most likely to be characterized under this trope. Men are less likely to be depicted escaping sexual assault situations but this trope frequently applies when they are as All Men Are Perverts and A Man Is Always Eager.

While Real Life victims can have widely varying responses to rape or sexual assault, generally speaking, they do not tend to be interested in getting it on within minutes of the assault ending. Most victims experience shock and many require immediate medical attention. After an assault, the victim's trauma often impacts their ability to engage in sex or romance and it can take years of therapy or longer to fully address.

    Literature 

-   Male victim in _Between Worlds_: Jason is sexually assaulted in a bar bathroom by a pair of Interior officers, and is rescued by his squadmate Freyxh. He struggles to acknowledge that it even _was_ an Attempted Rape because of his Earth upbringing (unlike humans, female Shil'vati are generally bigger, stronger, and more aggressive than their males) and feels more weirded out by the experience than violated. Jason then spends the evening helping Freyxh wash off the pepper spray they used against the attackers before having sex with her in the tub.
-   _The Demon Princes_: In "The Face", Kirth Gersen rescues Jerdian Chanseth, the girl he has a crush on, from Attempted Rape. They end up spending the night together.
-   _Judge Dee_: In "The Chinese Gold Murders", Mrs. Koo (née Miss Tsao) is kidnapped and raped, then her rapist murdered in front of her. She manages to escape being Buried Alive, then runs into a monk who attempt to rape her as well, but he suffers a heart attack when another man comes along and threatens him. The man hides her on a floating brothel, paying the madam so she doesn't have to take any clients. The madam decides to put her to work anyway, but is scared into bringing Mrs. Koo to the tribunal when she tells her she's a witness to a murder. And _then_ Mrs. Koo's husband and father disown her in public (according to the laws of the time she should have committed suicide due to being Defiled Forever). Small wonder that she declares she's done with anything to do with sex for life, and that's before it's revealed they too are criminals. Fortunately the judge's Top Wife takes her into the household, and several books later Miss Tsao is the judge's Third Wife.

Tigre then requests to take her virginity then and there, which they both recognize as insensitive after what she went through, but Elen agrees to it as Intimate Psychotherapy.
-   _The Mists of Avalon_: After Gwenhwyfar is kidnapped by Meleager she is rescued by Lancelet, but not in time to prevent her rape. Gwenhwyfar begs Lancelet to "take this unclean feeling from" her and he does, practically over Meleager's dead body.
-   _A Song of Ice and Fire_: Tyrion's backstory provides a Double Subversion. When he was a teenager, he and his brother Jaime rescued a girl named Tysha from men who intended to rape her. Tyrion comforted and took care of Tysha, and they quickly developed feelings for each other and made love, even getting married. However, Tyrion was later told that Tysha was a prostitute and the whole scenario had been set up by his brother so Tyrion could lose his virginity. Or at least that's what Tyrion believed for over a decade; Jaime eventually confesses that their father forced him to go along with this story because he didn't approve of Tyrion marrying a common girl. According to Jaime's account, Tysha wasn't a prostitute and really _did_ fall that hard for Tyrion after he rescued her, which infuriates Tyrion.
-   _Twilight_: Bella is cornered by a group of men who verbally harass her before being saved by Edward who indicates they would have assaulted her.

In _New Moon_, she even accepts a motorcycle ride from a man she _thought_ was one of the harassers in the vain hope Edward (who has left her) will swoop in to save her again.

That said, she shows murderous rage when she seemingly encounters the Don again, which doesn't abate even when it turns out to "only" be his servant Leporello in disguise: in the second edition of the score, she even ties Leporello to a chair and threatens to carve him up with a shaving razor.
    -   Averted with Don Giovanni's other near-rape victim, Donna Anna, whose father is also killed when he fights the Don in her defense. She spends the rest of the opera in a traumatized state of grief and rage, and refuses when her fiancé Don Ottavio tries to comfort her by suggesting that they get married the next day. Instead she insists on postponing the wedding for a year, "for my heart to heal."
