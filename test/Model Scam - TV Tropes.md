This is a type of scam with a broad range of utility. Sometimes it can even be pulled off without a camera, but photos are usually involved. It requires approaching the victim of the scam and convincing them that they are the most beautiful person the scam artist has ever met. Or at least in the top 10%, and if they would be willing to take a chance on the artist, the victim can make it big.

At this point, the scam starts to vary. Those who are looking to scam the victim out of their money will require upfront payment (usually expensive) and take photographs of the person, promising to spread the photos and contact information of the victim around the market, getting important people to check them out, typically national model scouts and internationally famous modeling agencies. It's "guaranteed" to work. However, about half the time the camera was just a prop and the victim is out a few hundred or more with nothing to show for it. There's more legitimate versions of this type of scam, where the pictures are real, but the victim is paying the scammer to submit a resume for an embarrassing mascot costume job or something else that the victim could have done for free.

Another version that is less about taking money from the victim and more about exploiting the victim, gets its money from selling pornographic pictures. The scam starts out the same way, and usually has a legitimate photographer who does make money by doing photoshoots, but they see an opportunity to exploit and they take it. The photographer asks for just a slight change in clothing, pulling one sleeve down and showing a _little_ extra skin. Bit by bit, the photographer wears away at the confidence of their victim, snapping pictures the entire time and rewarding them with praise whenever they obey the suggestions. This will go all the way to naked photoshoots if the victim lets it. Then, the photos can be sold to perverts and the negatives used as Blackmail to coerce the victim into more exploitation.

Such sexual exploitation can end up very similar to Casting Couch, where the scam artist is trying to convince the victim to have sex. The difference is that in the Couch trope, the victim gets a job, while in the Scam, the job was never really going to the person in the first place. Shameful Strip is also similar, as the victim may be ashamed/embarrassed to undress, but in this case the victim isn't being tortured (it just feels that way). Situations where the scammer is trying to exploit the victim for money or some other gain with nothing sexual involved are common enough to be Truth in Television. A Sleazy Photoshoot is similar, but is intended as an actual shoot even though the model goes through similar circumstances.

The very darkest of versions has the scam being used as a front for a Human Trafficking operation. Victims unfortunate enough to be lured into this version of the scam can expect even worse than the above sexual exploitation — oftentimes their fate is to be made some variety of Sex Slave.

Overlaps with Revenge Porn Blackmail if the photos are used for blackmail purposes. Contrast Modeling is Glamorous.

    Anime and Manga 

-   Hiroaki Samura's _Bradherley's Coach_ has a very dark variation in which the eponymous Bradherley, a European aristocrat, routinely adopts beautiful girls from various orphanages across the country with the promise of training them as actresses and making them a part of his famous opera troupe. But while some of these girls _do_ get the chance to perform on the stage as promised, most never even make it to the troupe. Instead, they are sent to a prison to be gang-raped by long-term and lifetime prisoners in order to make them "vent" their sexual and violent urges and prevent them from committing an uprising.

-   Subverted in _Great Teacher Onizuka_ - Tomoko _thinks_ this is what's going to happen to her, but ends up getting discovered by a real talent agent.
-   Happens in _Key the Metal Idol_, to the very naive title character. Fortunately, the scumbags ordered delivery, and her friend Tomoko who brought the food figured out what was going on, and saved her.
-   The "Debut Scam" arc from _Kurosagi_ deals with this. A fraudulent entertainment production company goes around picking up girls and offering them model jobs, then trick them into taking loans to buy expensive accessories for gigs that only pay a small fraction of the loan's amount.
-   A variation of this occurs in Season 2 of _Nogizaka: Haruka no Himitsu_. The main heroine, Haruka, is told by some modeling agents that she should participate in a beauty contest as a placeholder contestant. Unknown to her however, the agents really have her in mind to become the actual winner, and turn her into an actual model for their agency. The main protagonist, Yuuto, has to go through a lot to expose them, which at the end of the arc, causes the two agents to be Hoist by Their Own Petard when Haruka's exceedingly wealthy father buys out the agency, then promptly fires the two agents for their charade.

-   In one chapter of _Sgt. Frog_, Tamama tries to discredit Angol Mois by posing as a sleazy camera man (with the help of a robotic exoskeleton) and telling her that she can become more "mature" by doing a photo shoot.
-   In one _Samurai Champloo_ episode, an artist offers to sketch Fuu and it turns out that he's aiding a sex slavery ring — he sketches women and people make "orders" based on the drawings and the models get kidnapped and sold. Fuu is rescued before anything bad can happen but presumably, this trope was played straight for the other women.
-   Happens to Anzu/Tea of _Yu-Gi-Oh!_, who is promised a chance to be a dancer like she's always wanted. In the original, Anzu was blackmailed to come to the gym under threat that the blackmailer would reveal her true age to her workplace and get her fired. The blackmailer was the gym teacher and wanted to videotape her body. In both versions, this leads to a Rescue Romance, as she fell in love with the Pharoah after he saved her from the pervert.

    Comic Books 

-   A _Wonder Woman_/_Batman_ graphic novel, _The Hiketeia_, involves a young woman whose sister was lured to Gotham City under the lure of this trope and quickly dragged into prostitution enforced by (forced) heroin addiction before eventually being murdered. The woman's vengeance against her sister's enslavers/killers leads her to ask for Wonder Woman's protection from _Batman_ (since she had, y'know, _murdered_ her sister's killers).
-   Parodied in _Superman: Metropolis Secret Files & Origins_: Jimmy Olsen, of all people, tries this on Lex Luthor's Amazonian bodyguards when he meets them in the _Planet_'s elevator. The next panel shows them exiting the elevator, leaving a semiconcious Jimmy behind them.
-   Implied Trope in _Sin City: That Yellow Bastard_. When Hartigan meets with Nancy at Kadie's, Agamemnon approaches him and asks Hartigan to put in a good word for him, claiming he's a world-famous photographer. He's definitely full of shit, since Agamemnon is a lazy slob who is established in _Dame to Kill For_ to get by doing "cheating spouse" photo jobs and similar low-rent stuff.
-   _Red Ears_: The current page image shows a sleazy-looking guy approaching a young woman and her boyfriend and promising her a big career in films. What he fails to mention is that he is a porn director, which the woman only realizes when she shows up to the set.

    Fan Works 

-   Photo Finish in _Anchor Foal_ is a cross between this and Sleazy Photoshoot, in that Finish is an actual fashion photographer but she premeditatedly uses a combination of fine print and emotional abuse to get out of paying her victims. Also, she teaches her victims a characteristic Supermodel Strut that Fleur thinks is stupid-looking.
    
    "How did she justify not paying you?"  
    "...I'm sorry," Fluttershy instinctively apologized in a way which was also threatening to become a signature move, "but I don't understand —"  
    "Photo Finish," Fleur spat, and Fluttershy pulled back from the anger. "What did she write into the contract that time? You had to pay for your own cosmetics? All hotel rooms were booked using your salary? It turned out that every time a shoot ran overtime, you covered the extra and 'overtime' started after three minutes? What was it?"  
    A soft fall breeze shifted the grass, carried some of the cottage's odors around them. None of the miasma could put a taste in Fleur's mouth which would have been worse than the name, and even Mr. Flankington would have been hard-pressed to trigger more illness.  
    "...I left before my term was complete," Fluttershy finally said. "She told me there was a — forfeiture fee, and... my friend almost went after her, I just got my teeth around her tail in time, and after that, it was hard to... there were consequences, and..." Her head slowly dipped, bowed by the weight of memory. "It... hurt her. For a while. And I... didn't get anything except a copy of the calendar. From the printer. And she still tried to send me a bill for it."

-   In the film _Human Trafficking_ (2005), the Big Bad has a model agency in East Europe.

The scam ends with all the children being kidnapped, taken back to Colombia and sold into sex slavery.
