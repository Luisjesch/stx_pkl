This is a trope where someone rescues somebody else, usually from a long way away, by teleporting. They don't just teleport to where they're being held and bust them out; they go right to where the person is, grab them, and then teleport out with them. It can also be done other ways, such as the rescuee being teleported from far away, or a rescuer arriving on foot to give the rescuee a Warp Whistle to allow him/her to escape. The exact execution isn't important (it could be technological, magical, or somewhere in the middle; the crucial element is that the teleportation is the direct means of the rescuing.)

This may require removal of Teleport Interdiction. If done poorly, can result in a Tele-Frag. It may use instantaneous teleportation or a portal. It can be initiated by a Warp Zone or Warp Whistle. May involve the use of Flash Step or an Extradimensional Emergency Exit.

A sister trope of Weaponized Teleportation, and can be a Sub-Trope of Teleport Spam. Often the rescuer is a Reality Warper.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Dragon Ball Z_:
    -   After Tien busts Cell's attempt to absorb Android 18, Cell retaliates. Fortunately for Tien, Goku uses his Instant Transmission technique to teleport there, grab Tien (and Piccolo, who was also there) and (since Goku knows he isn't powerful enough to fight Cell yet) quickly teleport to a safe place.
    -   Goku teleports himself, Vegeta, Mr. Satan, and Dende to safety, escaping from from Buu's energy ball. Unfortunately, he couldn't save Gohan, Goten, Trunks, Piccolo, and the others who died when the Earth exploded.
-   _Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai_: When Dai, Hadlar, and Popp are ensnared in Kill-Vearn's deadly fire trap, Hadlar decides to sacrifice his own body to hold back the flames long enough for Popp to blow a temporary hole in the trap with a Medoroa spell, grab Dai, and teleport out with him using the Zoom spell. The spell successfully evacuates Dai, but Popp is left behind after his sympathy over leaving Hadlar to die makes him hesitate to escape.
-   _Sengoku Youko_: Jinka wants to get a leg up in his battle against the nine-tailed Yazen, so he eats the flesh of Taizan the Mountain God for a power boost but ends up absorbing too much spiritual energy. He loses his sense of self and transforms into an out of control, thousand-tailed calamity that not even the powerful Mountain Goddess can suppress. All she can do is teleport herself, Jinka's allies, and her _entire mountain_ out of harm's way before Jinka obliterates the entire area.
-   In _Summer Time Rendering_, Shinpei receives the power to loop back in time to the day he arrived on the island that activates each time he dies. While only his consciousness will return to the past, Shadow Ushio will physically follow him back in time as long as she wasn't killed in the previous loop. In order to escape their captors Shide and Haine in the fourth loop, Shinpei drinks an entire bottle of poison, grabs ahold of Shadow Ushio with his consciousness once he finally succumbs to it, and pulls her into the time warp just in time to avoid an incoming fatal strike from Shide's blade.
-   The Bail-Out Trigger in _World Trigger_ is a safety mechanism that will automatically activate when an agent's Trion body takes lethal damage. It works by teleporting the agent, including their physical body and full Trigger equipments, to central Border’s landing rooms with the agent completely ejected from their Trigger equipments. During the Large Scale Invasion arc, Azuma forces Bail-Out to activate on his panicking squad member Koarai by sniping his head off so that Koarai would be safe from being cubi-fied by the enemy Trion soldier that captured him.

    Comic Books 

-   In the Marvel Universe, this is part of Sidewinder's stock in trade. When he founded the Serpent Society, one of the perks he promised members was that he could free them if they got arrested. He was shown doing this in _Captain America_, teleporting into a jail cell, grabbing the imprisoned member, and teleporting out.
-   Happens to Hal Jordan in _Justice_: after he is teleported by the villains so far outside the known universe that no Green Lantern ring, including his own, would help him get back, The Phantom Stranger eventually locates and teleports him back to Earth, because magic.
-   In _Blue Beetle_ (2006), Jaime has to give up his chance to escape the Reach's station in time to ensure that its self-destruct can't be shut down. Fortunately, Booster Gold _never_ runs out of time—he appears from a portal and pulls Jaime out just as the last second counts down.
-   _Robin (1993)_: Stephan saves Tim from the Eldritch Abomination they've stumbled across by pulling him into his pocket-dimension-like forest.
-   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: Circe rescues Diana from the White Magician's final attack by teleporting the _villains_ away. She doesn't bother with the White Magician himself though, as the first thing she noticed when she arrived was that his own magic was going to kill him within moments.

    Fan Works 

-   The _Dragon Ball Z Abridged_ take on Goku rescuing Tien and Piccolo adds Goku _forgetting that he could teleport_.
    
    **Gohan:** No! We CAN'T just let him die like this! You gotta save him!  
    **Goku:** But I can't get him in time! There's no way I could move fast enough to grab him, get out, and—  
    _\[beat\]_  
    _\[Goku teleports\]_  
    **Gohan:** Did-did he just remember he can do that?  
    **Mr. Popo:** Your father's an idiot.
    
-   _Invader Zim: A Very Tall Problem_: In the series pilot episode, Minimoose performs a Swap Teleportation with the Almighty Tallest just as they are about to be executed by a Resisty firing squad. While Minimoose's actions did save the Tallests' lives, he also teleported them to a desert on Earth, effectively stranding them in the last place they wanted to be.
-   _The Flux of Mortal Things_
    -   Seven of Nine finds himself in a Literal Cliffhanger, holding onto B'Elanna Torres with one hand and an overhead pipe with the other. B'Elanna starts to slip out of her hand, so Seven orders an emergency beam-out and lets go of the pipe, trusting the transporter to catch both of them as they're falling. Seven was the only one who had a commbadge, so B'Elanna couldn't do this herself.
    -   A flashback scene shows B'Elanna and Seven escaping a riot with an emergency transport just as a police armoured car is about to run them down.
-   _The Palaververse_: _The Strangest of These_: Troubleshoes is "hastily" teleported a few inches to prevent his hoof coming down on a bear's tail and preventing a "bear-induced mauling", he assumes.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _X2: X-Men United_, the X-jet is damaged by an Air Force fighter's missile and Rogue falls out of the plane. Nightcrawler teleports out to catch her, then teleports back. He also rescues the children imprisoned at Stryker's base later in the same film (probably more efficient than breaking down the door or blasting the lock).
-   _Spider-Man: No Way Home_ has Doctor Strange teleport Peter Parker and Otto Octavius to the Sanctum Sanctorum just as they're about to be attacked by the Green Goblin on the Alexander Hamilton Bridge.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country_ has a rare instance of the rescue coming at exactly the wrong moment, as the jailer of Rura Penthe is just about to tell Kirk and McCoy who was really responsible for Chancellor Gorkon's assassination:
    -   _Star Trek (2009)_:
        -   Kirk and Sulu are falling from a great height down to the surface of Vulcan. The transporter tech is having trouble getting a lock on them. Chekov then rushes to the transporter room and manages to beam them out moments before the splat.
        -   Later, he tries to do the same to Spock and the Vulcan High Council, as the planet is imploding around them. He manages to get them, except for Spock's mother, who falls into a crevasse moments before.
        -   Finally, at the climax, Scotty manages to perform a simultaneous beam-out from two different locations (Spock from the _Jellyfish_ and Kirk and Pike from the _Narada_).
    -   In _Star Trek Beyond_ this is used twice. First it is used to save Spock and Bones just before they get killed by a few of the drone ships, later it is used to rescue the rest of the crew from Krall's compound.
-   In _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_ Dobby Apparates to his former home of Malfoy Manor after he learns Harry, Ron and Hermione have been imprisoned there and Apparates the trio as well as Luna Lovegood, Garrick Ollivander and Griphook to safety.

    Literature 

-   Ciaphas Cain **(HERO OF THE IMPERIUM!!!)** is saved this way in _The Emperor's Finest_. While being chased by both Orks and Genestealers through a space hulk he and Jurgen stumble upon one of the recon robots that was dispatched earlier and Drumon is able to use the teleport homer inside of it to teleport them both to safety moments before they would have been overrun.
-   _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_: Albus Dumbledore's brother Aberforth had most of Sirius' mirror (Harry had a shard of it and got the occasional glimpse of someone he couldn't quite identify and who looked like the then-deceased Albus Dumbledore). When Harry, Ron and Hermione were caught by the snatchers and taken to Malfoy Manor, Aberforth is able to have Dobby Apparate into the manor and rescue them, as well as Luna Lovegood, Dean Thomas, the goblin Griphook and the wand expert Ollivander.
-   _Interesting Times_: At the beginning of the book, Rincewind is teleported to the Agatean Empire with the wizards teleporting a local object as a counterweight (a long tube with a lit fuse at one end called a Barking Dog). Towards the end of the book, as he's about to be killed by Lord Hong, the wizards teleport him back, sending the Barking Dog back... having relit the fuse, reasoning that it should be sent back as it was found. However, this time Rincewind is not sent to the Unseen University, the spell sent him to Fourecks instead.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In the second season of _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._, Gordon the teleporter rescues several people this way. He does it for Raina at the end of "Aftershocks" when she's surrounded by SHIELD troops, and for Skye at the end of "One Door Closes".
-   Happens in almost every episode of _Blake's 7_, usually Just in Time too. Averted however in "Orbit" when Avon and Vila are in a shuttle struggling to reach escape velocity, and Dayna suggests teleporting over with a couple of teleport bracelets and rescuing them. She's told it's too difficult to teleport between two fast-moving points.
-   _Doctor Who_: Done multiple times, often involving the Doctor summoning the TARDIS to himself. In "Doomsday", Rose and the Doctor are trying to close an interdimensional breach, thereby sucking the warring Daleks and Cybermen off of Earth and into the void. Rose loses her grip and falls into the void, but the Alternate Universe version of her father transports from the alternate universe, catches her, and transports back as the breach closes.
-   An episode of _The Flash (2014)_ starts with Peek-A-Boo busting her boyfriend out of prison with her teleportation abilities. She makes it a point of first turning on the light in the car, since she has to be able to see where she's teleporting.
-   In _Stargate SG-1_ the team is often beamed out of danger at the last second by the Asgard, or by the SGC once they start building their own ships. Lampshaded (along with many other common tropes) in "200", when Teal'c remarks that just beaming somebody out of a hopeless situation seems too convenient.
-   _Star Trek: The Original Series_: Several times, naturally. Either beam the endangered landing party out or beam down a well armed security contingent. Often the issue is complicated either because they don't have access to communicators to signal or can't violate Prime Directive by vanishing into thin air in sight of clueless natives. Or the transporter goes offline at the most inconvenient moment, leaving Kirk to yell at Scotty to fix it ASAP.
    -   In "The Enterprise Incident", the plan involves teleporting Spock out of the Romulan ship he infiltrated before they get round to executing him. Kirk assumes this would be easy as there is only one Vulcan aboard that ship, so it should be easy enough to isolate his life signs. Unfortunately, Romulan and Vulcan physiologies are nearly identical...
-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_: In "The Most Toys", Data has been kidnapped by an absolute scum of a man, but he's managed to free himself and is pointing the man's own illegal gun at him (illegal because it causes an very agonizing death). Oh, and the man he's facing just so happens to have murdered someone with the gun and plans to murder more just to browbeat him, and he's just realized that said illegal gun is the only means he has of stopping this psychopath. As the _Enterprise_ beams him out, they notice that the gun had been discharged during the transport, which Data claims must surely have been some side effect of the transporter beam. So not only did they rescue Data, but unintentionally saved the villain as well.
-   _Star Trek: Voyager_
    -   In "False Profits", Chakotay and Paris convince the primitive local population to strap their "Sages" (actually, Ferengi) to poles and set them ablaze in order for them to ascend, as per their poem. As the Ferengi are about to burn, _Voyager_ beams them out, making it look like they really did ascend.
    -   In "Darkling", Kes and the Doctor fall off a cliff, but Voyager transports them in mid-fall.
-   _Star Trek: Picard_:
    -   In "Absolute Candor", shortly after Elnor decapitates Tenqem and threatens the remaining Romulans with death if they try to harm Picard, a goon starts to unholster his disruptor and points out that Elnor can't dodge that. The goon never gets to test that theory, as Picard urgently orders a pending beam-up to happen immediately.
    -   Later in the same episode, Raffi transports Seven of Nine to _La Sirena_ just before the latter's ship explodes when it hits Vashti's security net.
    -   In "Nepenthe", Narissa beams away a split second before she would've been hit by her own knife that Elnor throws back at her.
    -   In "Broken Pieces", Narissa teleports to safety before she's mauled to death by the xBs.
-   _Supernatural_:
    -   In the season 5 episode "Abandon All Hope...", Sam and Dean are captured by the Devil himself while he's performing a sacrificial ritual to raise the Pale Horseman from his slumber. Their angel friend Castiel (who had been previously captured and escaped) teleports to where they're being held, to teleport them away from the danger zone.
    -   Castiel rescues Dean just as Zachariah is about to do something nasty to him in "The End".
    -   Castiel does it again in season six, whisking Sam and Dean away _just_ as the building they're in explodes. He knew somebody was after them and was apparently keeping tabs.

    Music 

-   _Banned from Argo_ mentions having to beam up the captain as the police close in and the doctor after he's taken to jail.

    Video Games 

-   _Dawn of War II_: Losing a mission due to all heroes being downed at the same time results in a game over screen reading Emergency Extraction, allowing you to keep all the wargear and experience you'd acquired.
-   _EXTRAPOWER: Attack of Darkforce_ Happens at a couple points in the game. When Blackberry and Kurogane escape from a Dark Force spacecraft only to find that the invasion fleet has filled the sky and Mensouma is about to attack them, the demon king sealed in Kurogane teleports them back to the rest of the team.
    -   Later, when Dark Force and his mother ship are trapped in collapsing Yami Space, a shadowy demon zone that interferes with his ship's teleportation technology, he would have been permanently trapped if Space Master Astral Gate did not give him an out and rescue Dark Force back to our dimension. The experience was severe enough for Dark Force to decide to just reduce the Earth into space dust, which works out for Astral Gate's prolonged amusement over the conflict.
-   _StarCraft_: In both games, Protoss Zealots disappear when killed, since their armor contains an emergency teleporter that instantly warps them back to Aiur (or their home base) when destroyed. Other troops like Dragoons and Immortals aren't so lucky (being grievously wounded Zealots in a battlesuit) and suffer Permadeath.
-   A few times in _Mega Man Zero_, when Zero has to rescue someone, he'll go to a stage, run towards them and then gives them a teleport beacon so the Mission Control can teleport them to base.
-   _Golden Sun_: Alex uses his short-range Teleport Spam to rescue Saturos after his first boss fight goes wrong, preventing the heroes from finishing him off (whether they actually would kill him off is discussed by the villains, who escape just after).
-   Tyrael saves Leah this way in _Diablo III_ when she is faced with Azmodan after falling asleep while researching the Black Soulstone.
-   In _Final Fantasy IV_, Rosa saves everyone from a Collapsing Lair by casting the Teleport spell, in a nice bit of Gameplay and Story Integration. (Granted, the cutscene version manages to take them many miles, while the usual one just gets you to the dungeon entrance.)
-   Done in reverse in _Final Fantasy VI_ when Kefka ambushes the heroes at the Magitek Research Facility. Rather than teleporting the party out, Celes uses it on _Kefka_ (as well as herself) so that the others can escape.
-   In _Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War_, Julius did this twice for Ishtar and Arione when the two were defeated at one point in the game.
-   In the Soviet campaign of the original _Command & Conquer: Red Alert_, Soviet troops capture Albert Einstein, and in order to use him a Trick-and-Follow Ploy, they bug Einstein and spread the rumor that they're about to execute him. The Allies extract Einstein directly by teleporting him with the Chronosphere, the bug promptly cluing the Soviet high command on its location.
-   In _Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals,_ Maxim the hero is trapped in the collapsing Ancient Tower after defeating Gades and saving the kingdom of Parcelyte from destruction. He resigns himself to death and collapses, when the mysterious prophet Iris unexpectedly teleports in behind him and warps him back to Parcelyte, although she doesn't rematerialise with him, leaving the reason for his unexpected survival unknown to everyone.
-   Near the beginning of _Tales of Phantasia_, Cress and Mint are saved from recently-released Dhaos curbstomping them by Morrison teleporting them to the past. They later return to that exact same moment, more than ready to defeat Dhaos.
-   In _FTL: Faster Than Light_, you can use your teleporter to save the crew of a spaceship stumbling shieldlessly through an Asteroid Thicket. With an upgraded teleporter you can also infiltrate a friendly slaver ship to rescue any slaves they might hold. Regardless of your success though, the slaver will turn on you if you try that.

    Western Animation 

-   _Avengers Assemble_: Iron Man tries to make a Heroic Sacrifice by using the last of the power in his armor to manually push Ultron into the Sun. Luckily for him, Thor suddenly teleports in to take him back to Earth.
-   _Centurions_ limits the Story-Breaker Power of its "beam chambers" by adding the restriction that living beings can't use them safely without an Exo-Frame or special metal harness. However, the series still uses this trope to save the heroes from time to time.
-   _Monkie Kid_: Macaque does this when Mk is about to be punched by Wukong Possesed by the Lady bone demon by slipping a portal under Mk's feet, sending him far away.
