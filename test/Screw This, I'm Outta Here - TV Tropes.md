_"Screw you guys, I'm going home."_

Sometimes, a character is pushed just a bit too far. They might be thrown into a dangerous situation, where they'll most likely get slaughtered by their enemy. They might be stuck with people that infuriate or annoy them, and be expected to stay with them for the whole story. The situation they find themselves in might have devolved into something so utterly Sick and Wrong or just downright _weird_ that walking out immediately is the only way they feel they preserve what little remains of their dignity and/or sanity. They might even just be bored out of their skull. So, when the situation just goes beyond what they're willing to put up with, deciding to leave can be a powerful statement.

This is about the dramatic _unplanned_ moment when a character abandons their friends/allies/coworkers/etc. Something that may leave the other characters (and audience) feeling betrayed. On the other hand, such a moment can also be comedic or light-hearted, where the character just up and leaves on a whim and doesn't hurt anyone else by doing so. What's less varied is the portrayal of the character. In many cases, they're shown to be immature and selfish at best, rudely leaving everyone else behind just because they felt like it- even if their reasons for leaving are proven to be valid or at least understandable. In cases of danger or abuse, this sort of reaction can be the only way to get out safely or even at all.

In more dramatic examples, this moment can precede a betrayal, where the frustrated character decides that working with their enemies is the best course of action. The character may abandon their allies only to quickly return (or not). The allies who have been abandoned might inform their ex-friend that nobody can leave alive. When the character is playing a game, this moment can overlap with a Rage Quit.

In many cases, the character(s) end up getting killed or (in crime and mystery stories) arrested despite their efforts to abandon the whole mess.

If the upper crust of a given society does this in response to a major crisis, see The Elites Jump Ship.

Compare Dirty Coward, which is when someone abandons their allies when they need them the most, or just aren’t willing to face a tough situation in their lives, so they flee from it. Often overlaps.

In more comedic examples, this moment usually occurs when someone (usually the Only Sane Man) senses that something idiotic and/or ludicrous is about to happen and they don't want any part of it, thus opting to get away from the ensuring chaos as soon as possible, not wanting to get themselves involved.

One of the ways in which a character may choose to Opt Out. May happen as a result of a Not What I Signed on For or Won't Do Your Dirty Work moment. Contrast with Line in the Sand, when all characters on a team are given the option to leave. When this reaction is portrayed as the right idea, or at least reasonable, then it's a case of Know When to Fold 'Em.

Contrast Unable to Retreat, which may as well happen after someone attempts this.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Calvin and Hobbes_:
    -   It's a Running Gag that, right before they hurtle down a giant hill on a sled or wagon at high speeds, Hobbes will jump off at the last second to avoid the inevitable catastrophic crash ending that always results.
    -   One story arc had Calvin asking Hobbes to dig for worms and slugs with him. Hobbes asks him why they would do that, and quickly skedaddles when Calvin says he wants to dare each other to eat them.

    -   One Rosalyn babysitting story had Calvin bust out his Stupendous Man alias to attack her. The moment Calvin pulls the costume out, Hobbes decides to just head straight to bed immediately rather than wait for Rosalyn to inevitably send them to bed early as punishment once Calvin's caught.
        
        **Hobbes:** I'm going to get in bed now and avoid the rush.

    Music 

-   "I Ran Away" by the The Arrogant Worms is a whole song about this trope:
    
    Whenever I was challenged, I'd collapse like a souffle,  
    But I'm still alive to sing this song 'cause I ran away!
    
-   The second verse of Lupe Fiasco's song "Hello, Goodbye" is about a general who deserted a war because he didn't believe in the cause. In the end, "_He stands, to find himself surrounded by thousands of soldiers, who he once trained to never miss their targets._"
-   A more humorous example can be found at the end of Liam Lynch's "Happy Song". The singer, disgusted by the Sickeningly Sweet crap he's been forced to sing about, says, "I'm outta here! Screw you!"
-   _Take This Job and Shove It_, I ain't workin' here no more / Don't you try to stand in my way as I go walkin' out the door! Exactly What It Says on the Tin, and a case of Covered Up (by Johnny Paycheck, it was written and first performed by David Allan Coe. Not to mention another cover by Dead Kennedys.)
-   "Art" by DJ Damien, a song made for a StepMania competition, consists of a heartbeat-like drum beat for one minute with just three steps held for the duration. "A2 (Art 2)" is a more conventional angry rap song about people who misunderstood the message intended in "Art". The trilogy ends with "The legend of ART", where DJ Damien raps over trance instead in an attempt to please StepMania players until three-fourths of the way through, when after a short Daft Punk sample, it goes back to angry rap. The first lyrics of the coda: "Screw this shit, I'm done / Making trance ain't fun."
-   There's a humorous — and vulgar — version of Jingle Bells where Santa's elves quit, citing that "they do all the fucking work/while he stars in the show"
    -   Another humorous song parody, "The Twelve _Pains_ of Christmas" by Bob Rivers, has the guy with the fourth pain, sending Christmas cards, give up and say he's not sending them this year while the guy with the second pain, rigging up the lights, ends up yelling "Fine! You're so smart, YOU rig up the lights!"
-   Billy Joel's "My Life" is basically a song about this. The narrator starts off by telling about an old friend of his who "Said he couldn't go on the American way. Closed his shop, sold the house, bought a ticket to the West Coast." The narrator then goes on to indicate he's done something similar, as he tells off someone who's apparently trying to convince him to return to a home he abandoned.
    -   Another Billy Joel example is "Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)", where he decides he would rather move out than live with his crazy mother.
-   "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" by Elton John is one. Lyricist Bernie Taupin, born in the English countryside mentioned the song was about Bernie having difficulty in relating to upper-crust city life (and in particular, Elton's pre-fame pickle-heiress girlfriend immortalized in "Someone Saved My Life Tonight") and Bernie's desire to revert to the simplicity of small-town life.
    -   The obscure 1973 B-side "Screw You", bowdlerized as "Young Man's Blues" in America, is a more humorous take on the trope.
-   "Fuck This Shit I'm Out", by The Theme Song, centers around this trope, but it leaves the actual _situation_ unspecified, because listeners find the song more applicable that way. One person animated it with The Theme Song's permission, and The Theme Song's own short music video for it shows him mentally checking out after finding one guy in a horsehead mask getting head from another guy in a library aisle. The song's applicability has made it a popular choice for AMVs, and it's also a frequently occurring song in _Supermarioglitchy4's Super Mario 64 Bloopers_.
    
    _I don't know what the fuck just happened  
    But I don't really care, I'mma get the fuck up outta here,  
    Fuck this shit, I'm out._
    
-   Diamond D's "I'm Outta Here", in which the narrator keeps finding himself in dangerous situations he needs to get away from.
    
    _Gotta get away, gotta get away now  
    And I'm outta here_
    
-   In "Rock This Town" by The Stray Cats, the narrator takes his girlfriend on a date and they do just this at their first stop:
    
    _Well, we found a little place that really didn't look half bad  
    I had a whiskey on the rocks, and changed half a dollar for the jukebox  
    Well, I put a quarter right into the can  
    But all they played was disco, man  
    Come on, baby, baby, let's get out of here right away_
    
-   Daniel Amos' "Horrendous Disc" (from the album of the same name) is about a musician whose hidden wrongdoings inexplicably get broadcast for the whole world to see. In the third verse, he jumps in his car and just drives away from the situation. It doesn't work, because he just finds a billboard displaying his misdeeds.
    
    He puts his car in gear  
    Got to get out of here  
    Going somewhere far away  
    But through the headlight beam  
    He sees a billboard scene  
    His fight last night is on display
    
-   "Banned from Argo" by Leslie Fish (the former Trope Namer for Persona Non Grata) has a gang of Klingons arrive on the planet where the crew is enjoying shore leave, and promptly flee horrified from the carnage.
-   The Ramones' last album, titled _We're Outta Here!_, is a live album of their final show. Recorded in Los Angeles in 1996, it was the last time the band played together. By 2014 all of the four original Ramones (Joey, Dee Dee, Johnny, and Tommy) had died.
-   The video for R.E.M.'s "Everybody Hurts" ends with all the people in the traffic jam getting out of their cars and walking off. It ends with a stinger featuring a traffic reporter lamenting helicopter footage of the scene:
    
    **Traffic Reporter:** ...about an hour and a half ago. We've had no official explanation. Police estimate some three or four hundred people. They just...they just got out and walked. God... We've gotten confirmation, we cannot find anyone. I've never seen anything like this.
    
-   Bob Dylan's "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues" ends on this.
    
    _I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff  
    My friends all said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough  
    But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff  
    I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough!_
    
-   Shania Twain's "(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!" ends with her sighing, stomping away, and slamming a door.
-   The Shel Silverstein song "Put Another Log on the Fire" uses this as the punchline. The singer, a Lazy Bum hillbilly, treats his wife terribly: he makes her do all the chores, insults her ("Don't I tell you when you're gettin' fat?"), and is implied to be fooling around with her younger sister. Apparently his wife has had enough and is storming out, as the song repeatedly asks "Tell me why you're leaving me." It was memorably used on _The Muppet Show_ in an episode with Candice Bergen playing the wife in pioneer clothes; the sketch ends with Bergen tearing off her dress to reveal a feminist T-shirt and shooting at the jerk before triumphantly marching out the door.
-   Two songs are virtually identical in their play on this. "Come a Little Bit Closer" (Jay & the Americans) and "Gimme Three Steps" (Lynyrd Skynyrd) have a guy at a club cozying up to a girl, only to run afoul of the girl's insanely jealous boyfriend. Before anything disastrous happens, the guy hightails it out of the club.
    
    Well, the crowd gave way and I began to pray  
    As the water fell to the floor,  
    And I'm tellin' you son that it ain't no fun  
    Looking straight down a forty-four  
    
    He turned and screamed at Linda Lou  
    And that's the break I was looking for,  
    And you could hear me screaming a mile away  
    As I ran right past your door
    
-   In the parody song _Screw the Nether_, the singers are initially enthusiastic about moving to the Nether, but after one of them falls in lava (AGAIN!), they start complaining about the heat and the fire and losing their gear, and they want to go home to the overworld.
-   In the comic folk song "The Errant Apprentice", when the apprentice discovers his true love married a Turk while he was away, he initially challenges the guy (or rather, attacks him from behind), but on seeing his rival's Sinister Scimitar, opts instead to go "screaming down the Strand" and finally jump in the River Foyle, concluding that "there's bugger all worth dyin' for/So I'll stick to the single life".

    Myths & Religion 

-   Some examples from _The Bible_:
    -   In the _Book of Exodus_, God knew that if He led His people into the Promised Land through the way of the Philistine territory, since that was the shortest route there, the Israelites would be afraid and then turn tail and head back to Egypt. So, in order to avert that, God led them by the longer route of the Red Sea and the desert.
    -   In the _Book of Numbers_, the Israelites sent twelve spies into the Promised Land to check it out and they return with a report that, though it is land that is fertile and good for farming, ten of the spies said it is also filled with fortified cities and that the Anakites, the "sons of the giants", lived there. The Israelites, disheartened by the news, decide that they would be better off returning to Egypt instead of relying upon God's help to conquer the land as Caleb and Joshua had suggested. For their cowardice, God decided to punish the Israelites by having them wander around in the wilderness for forty years until the entire generation from twenty years old and upward had all died, except for Caleb and Joshua, and that God will bring their children into the Promised Land through Joshua's leadership after Moses died.
    -   In the _Book of Ezekiel_, the Judaic religious system at the time of Ezekiel's ministry was so corrupt, with the priests worshiping idols even in God's holy Temple, that the glory of God decided to vacate the premises with Ezekiel watching.
    -   _The Four Gospels_: In Jesus' teaching to the disciples, He says that if a town they enter into doesn't receive them or the words that they speak that come from God, then they are to wipe the dust of their feet when they leave town as a sign of judgment upon them, saying that it will be more tolerable for the city of Sodom in the Day of Judgment than for that town.
    -   Jesus in the gospel of Matthew says, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to you, how often I have wanted to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you wouldn't let Me. See, your house is left to you desolate. For I tell you, you shall not see Me again until you say, 'Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.'" (Matthew 23:37-39)
    -   Most of Jesus' apostles resorted to this when Jesus was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane (which wasn't even necessary, because Jesus had insisted that the mob let his followers go). They eventually made up for their disloyalty — and then some — after the Resurrection.
    -   _Acts of the Apostles_: Paul's attitude to the Jews in Macedonia who blasphemed him and Silas in Acts chapter 18 when he was presenting the Gospel to them:
        
        _But when they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his garments and said to them, "Your blood be upon your heads. I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles."_ (Acts 18:6)
        
-   _Some_ (definitely _not_ all) schools of Buddhism has leaving the cycle of reincarnation without turning back as the ultimate goal. Others simply seek to become an enlightened being, free from the sorrows of the world, that helps others reach enlightenment from time to time.

    Podcasts 

-   Taako of _The Adventure Zone_'s Balance Arc does this constantly, so often that the line "Taako's good out here" has become something of a catchphrase for him.
    -   Taako also _causes_ one of these in Leon, being such a nuisance at the Fantasy Gachapon that Leon just eventually leaves.
-   In _Cinematic Titanic's_ viewing of _Santa Claus Conquers the Martians_, Trace makes a break for it when he hears the name of the movie. Joel explains some of them had seen the movie before. Trace is eventually dragged back into the theater.

-   In an episode of _The Ricky Gervais Show_ podcast, Karl is trying to explain his latest bizarre train of thought; that the world is better if you're a midget because there's more of it to see. Halfway through, Ricky leaves to make a cup of tea, asking Stephen to call him when Karl's finished.
-   One episode of _Rooster Teeth_'s Podcasts, and animated in _Rooster Teeth Animated Adventures_, tells the story of how Gus, fed up with Burnie constantly mentioning that Las Vegas was only a short drive away<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , hopped out of the van, headed back to their hotel, packed up, and wrote a note, declaring "See you in Austin, assholes!" Of course he couldn't find a flight that left L.A. that night and he had to get picked up to make it to the airport the next day.
-   In _Anime Slushie_'s RWBY Volume 8 Preview, Cube reacts harshly to the commentary's claim that there are no retcons in the show:
    
    **Cube:** I'm leaving.
    
    **Feen:** Guys,
    
    **Cube:** I'm walking away.
    
-   Occasionally, in The Letters Page (the _Sentinels of the Multiverse_ lore podcast), one of the hosts will make a dreadful pun or overplayed reference, and the other will sigh, put down their notes, and a slamming-door sound effect will play.

    Puppet Shows 

-   In _Muppets Tonight_ episode "The Cameo Show" (The one that starts with Arsenio Hall _dying_) technician Nigel finally cracks from all of the usual craziness.
    
    **Nigel:** All right. That's it, I've had enough. There's nothing on stage, this happens _every week_. I can't _take this anymore! You hear what I'm saying? I can't take it anymore! I mean it this time! I'm quitting! I quit, I quit, I quit! Do you hear me? I said I quit! Good riddance and goodbye, I quit!_ _\[leaves\]_  
    **Zipity:** ...Okay, I'll take over. Get ready to cue the Real World Muppets. And get me a double-chug with a zig-zag.  
    **Nigel:** _\[comes back\]_ Hey, what are you doing, this is my job.
    
-   _Sesame Street_ had this in a Monsterpiece Theater sketch parodying _Waiting for Godot_, where _a tree_ does this:
    
    **Tree:** Okay, that does it. I've been standing out here, waiting for this play to make some sense. I don't get it! It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. I'm outta here! _\[uproots self and starts to exit\]_ Why couldn't they do _Oklahoma!_? I understand _Oklahoma!_ _\[starts singing the main theme of_ Oklahoma!_\]_
    

    Radio

    **Veganin:** Well, then, old Radox, but you and I...  
    **Radox:** Umm... _(horse gallops away)_  
    **Veganin:** So. Farewell, thou cowards. Know you I would scorn to die in your company. To horse unto the King, to raise another force of men who would rejoice to die!
    

    Scripts 

-   In _Watchmen_, the SWAT Captain angrily mutters "I quit" and turns away to leave as the Statue of Liberty explodes.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Ars Magica_: One mage in the Order of Hermes was a notorious gadfly who received many declarations of Wizard's War from offended magi. Each time, he simply went into hiding until the declaration expired.
-   _BattleTech_:
    -   In the backstory, this was essentially General Aleksandr Kerensky's reaction to the Succession Wars starting up: he took his massive fleet and army and flew out into uncharted space, and vanished. The descendants of that fleet reappear hundreds of years later as the Clans, one of the only threats large enough to make the Successor States (who are _still_ fighting each other) team up to fight back.
    -   When Ice Hellion saKhan Connor Rood discovered that their supply lines have been intercepted by Clan Jade Falcon, he knows that his Clan is doomed by the combined wrath of the Falcons and Hell's Horses (which their Clan just ticked off). So he immediately set about saving as much of his Clan as he could and escaped the Inner Sphere. Meanwhile, his Khan continues to lead her forces in a hopeless war against the two Clans.
-   _Dead of Winter_: One random event card gives the player who draws it the option to leave the game entirely if the Colony's morale counter is on the verge of defeat. Their character attempts an extremely difficult die roll to escape the Colony and either perishes in the attempt or wins the game.
-   _Earthdawn_: Bards have a talent called "Graceful Exit". It even gives them a head start!
-   _Fate_ system, as used in _Spirit of the Century_ or _The Dresden Files_, comes with explicit rules support and even some mechanical rewards for conceding a conflict before it gets too far out of hand, which helps encourage both players and Game Masters to remember that enacting this trope instead of always fighting to the bitter end _is_ in fact an option.
-   _Warhammer_:
    -   _Necromunda_: Spyrers fight for fun and glory but should their prey put up too much of a fight they will retreat to find easier game. To represent this, 2nd Edition Spyre hunter teams had to start testing to see if they would retreat from a battle after they lose a single member rather than 25% of their number as with other gangs.
    -   _Warhammer 40,000_:
        -   Certain circumstances such as losing more than 25% of the unit in one phase, losing in close combat, tank shocking or getting hit with some kinds of special weaponry or psychic powers, will cause a unit to have to take a Morale check. If they fail the check, they will pull this trope. Certain units are more vulnerable to Morale hits than others: generally, rank and file grunts such as Conscripts and Gretchen will run away the moment things start going badly, but some units are just so fearless, psychotic and/or fanatical that they will only retreat in the most dire of circumstances... and even then only maybe. Codex-compliant Space Marines Take a Third Option with a special rule (And They Shall Know No Fear) that avoids both total routs and the extra losses fearless units suffer, allowing them to make tactical retreats but then reform regardless of casualties.
        -   As Slaanesh and Khorne tore apart the rest of the Aeldari Pantheon, Cegorach the Laughing God went "oh, screw this!" and fled into the Webway.
        -   Craftworld Lugganath wrote off the material realm as a lost cause a long time ago and retreated fully into the Webway, choosing to shelter in the one area they believed to be safe and leaving the galaxy's sinking ship early.
        -   At the climax of the Horus Heresy, Perturabo was essentially left to run the Siege of the Emperor's Palace by himself while his fellow Traitor Primarchs were occupied either pursuing their own objectives, busy elsewhere or steadily losing their minds and as such not really contributing to the actual objective. When Horus decreed that the Iron Warriors would be spread throughout the occupying force while Mortarion took over their prepared positions, Perturabo's patience - never a long fuse at the best of times - finally ran out and he told Horus where to stick it, gathered his troops, and quit the siege entirely.
-   _The World of Darkness_:
    -   _Vampire: The Requiem_: The opening fiction to _Night Horrors: The Wicked Dead_ has a recurring character rooming with an up-and-coming supermodel, trying to see if she'd be a good candidate for initiation into a cult. She comes home a bit early one night, and finds some hideously bloated _thing_ sucking what looks like the supermodel's life out from her thigh... and the supermodel enjoying it. Her reaction? "Yeah, I'll just... see myself out."
    -   _Werewolf: The Apocalypse_: Uktena (the totem spirit of the Uktena tribe) was once a servant of the original Wyrm of balance. When the Wyrm went insane, Uktena defected to the Wyld.

    Theatre 

-   In the _Franklin_ stage show _Franklin's Class Trip_, Franklin has this reaction when he and his class visit the science museum and are greeted in song by their "highly respected and professional" but nevertheless somewhat eccentric guideperson, Miss Carbunkel.
