The Bridge Bunnies in their natural habitat.

_"Do I LOOK like I believe in equality for women?" roared Zarkendorf, gesturing at his scantily-clad console operators._

Someone other than The Captain needs to actually _run_ the Cool Starship, which is where the Bridge Bunnies come in. They're a few young, attractive twentysomething women (see Office Lady) who practically live on The Bridge, and deal with opening hailing frequencies, giving orders to the pilots of the Humongous Mecha squadrons, reporting that the Readings Are Off the Scale, activating the Applied Phlebotinum, repeating whatever the computer is saying, warning of Negative Space Wedgies, and the like. A staple of Japanese anime shows that feature large capital ships—technically, said shows will usually include male personnel on the bridge, but the bunnies are much more likely to get names (and fans), unless said others are genuine characters and not scenery (as mentioned below).

Off duty, they're frequently romantically paired with minor characters or can be the Girl of the Week. They're invariably female, although a token male junior bridge officer may be sufficiently intimidated by them to serve as Comic Relief. Token males in this position will also likely be swinging their bat the other way unless someone else on the crew fills that role. Depending on the protagonist's role on the ship, Those Two Guys may also work on the bridge with the Bunnies.

Less common in Western shows these days, where bridge personnel are more likely to be competent professional officers of _both_ sexes. Women on the bridge aren't necessarily Bridge Bunnies _per se_, nor are junior officers doing menial jobs... but a bridge _full_ of young, pretty female junior officers, and on which all of the senior officers with real authority are male, is a textbook example of the trope (compare Office Lady). Go back far enough, and most western shows will completely lack any sort of female bridge personnel (their inclusion was considered very radical in the original _Star Trek_) with the understanding of naval warships being an inherently manly profession (look at any major warship on either side of the classic _Star Wars_ films).

A specialized version of Mission Control, with all the twists therein possibly applicable. They occasionally serve as Those Two Girls, commenting on the action and what's going to happen next.

    Comic Books 

-   Jayne's fantasy sequence in the _Serenity_ comic _Better Days_ involves him commanding a ship crewed entirely by Bridge Bunnies.
-   The _Marvel Mangaverse_ version of the Fantastic Four has Alicia Harkness and Agatha Harkness serving as Bridge Bunnies to Reed Richards.
-   The post-_Crisis_, corporate tycoon version of Lex Luthor surrounded himself with attractive young female staffers whose corporate uniforms were low-cut blouses and blazers, very short mini-skirts and high heels.
-   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: All of the bridge crew on the spaceship _Hippolyta_ are young women with figures that are conventionally attractive, however every single member of the crew in the fleet is a female—though many are not attractive by human standards—and the only time men are ever on the _Hippolyta_ is as prisoners or freed slaves being helped somewhere out of the empire's reach.

    Fan Works 

-   _Evangelion 303_: The commanding center in the Distler Base is managed by a bunch of technicians. Maya Ibuki is the most prominent of them, and Makoto and Shigeru seldom show up, but most of them are not given names, distinctive faces or personalities.
-   _HERZ_: After the battle of 2015, NERV's Bridge Bunnies were promoted and replaced with new operators. They are introduced in chapter 1:
    
    _"That big bald fellow with the beard is Col Peter Strasser. Used to be from the Third Branch in Germany. He's our deputy commander and concurrently chief of Section 3, that is, Operations. Those three are our bridge operators. From the right - 2nd Lt Mochida, 1st Lt Igarashi, and 2nd Lt Ito. I used to sit where Ito is working now. The lady in the lab coat is Dr Ibuki Maya. She's our Chief Scientific Officer."_
    
-   A Running Gag in _Plan 7 of 9 from Outer Space_ involves the Space Rangers being Mistaken for Gay due to their campy hero costumes. When Captain Proton cites the large number of glamorous babes working in every alien-fighting organisation, reporter Buster Kincaid says that only proves the men are gay, as otherwise they'd be too Distracted by the Sexy to work.
-   In _Nepeta Quest 2011_, Scoria is placed in a simulation of an Alternian admiral, and notes with glee that she now has these, even calling them "bridge bunnies".
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion: Genocide_ adds Haruna Ieil to the usual rooster of Maya, Hyūga, and Aoba. She is mainly there to function as New Meat, as she reacts with panic and/or horror to situations surrounding Evangelion and Angel combat that the more experienced main trio has gotten rather desensitized to.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Galaxy Quest_ plays this trope snarkily straight. Gwen DeMarco's official capacity is inherited from her character in the Show Within a Show, Tawny Madison. Her job is to repeat everything the ship's computer says, word-for-word and order it to do everything. And they _need_ her to do it, as the computer only obeys her. Lampshaded into a pile of smoking ash about three-quarters of the way through the movie:
    
    **Gwen**: Listen - I have _one_ job to do on this ship, and it's stupid, but I'm gonna do it!
    
-   Likewise in the _Star Trek_ parody _Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning_, where the primary job of the helmswoman is to look darn good and make fun of the Captain/Emperor. The extras at the back of the bridge are also all female (and all in high heels).
-   Despite having been a clear Bridge Bunny in the original TV series (and subsequent movies), Uhura in _Star Trek (2009)_ is portrayed as smart, competent, and an aversion to this trope.
-   In _Arena_, the control room of Logan's illegal gladiator combat broadcast is operated by Kawaii and Kaneko, a pair of attractive young women who spend half their time responding to barked orders by hitting buttons on consoles and the other half of the time being eye candy.
-   Marlene and Charlene from _Spaceballs_. "Chew your gum!"
-   Lampshaded in _Carry On Spying_. The captured heroes are taken to the villain's Elaborate Underground Base, which is full of women in Spy Catsuits bustling about.
-   _Space Mutiny_ had Bridge Bunnies who were downright _Playboy Bunnies._ They were wearing singlets and everything. (Granted, some other bridge staff wore actual uniforms, but still...)

    Literature 

-   Starships in David Weber's _Honor Harrington_ cycle tend to have a high number of females aboard, but the author usually avoids invoking it as this trope. One female character, however, is called out in-story on the disproportionally high number of Pretty Boys in her bridge crews.
-   The Past Doctor Adventures novel _The Indestructible Man_ by Simon Messingham is a deconstruction of Gerry Anderson's work, including _UFO (1970)_. The bridge bunnies of SILHOET (an expy of SHADO) are the daughters of the rich and powerful — women who'd normally be models, actresses or trophy wives, but as much of Earth is a dystopia, SILHOET gives them a secure position in an influential organisation to curry favour with their parents.
-   In _The Dresden Files,_ Molly Carpenter's mindscape is presented as being the bridge of the old _USS Enterprise,_ complete with these. And a Red Shirt Molly whose job is to die at the first sign of trouble, because old habits die hard.

    Webcomics 

    Western Animation 

-   In _Legion of Super Heroes (2006)_, Triplicate Girl serves as a three-person Bridge Bunny team.
-   L'Etranger from _Max Steel_ has his submarine, the Akina, staffed solely by female SIRENS in full-body (yet form-fitting) armor and helmets.
-   In _Phineas and Ferb_, the Fireside Girls sometimes become this when they have to help pilot inventions.
-   In _Wakfu_, the bridge of Prince Adale's submarine is filled with almost identical bridge bunnies, also speaking in unison (except for when they're panicking).

    Real Life 

-   Lafayette Ron Hubbard managed to take this to levels reached in few fictional examples: While living as a self-styled Commodore on the "Royal Scotsman", the flag ship of his fleet, he had a Commodore's Messenger Organization (read: errand kids) tasked with duties like lighting his cigarettes, dressing him and repeating his orders to members of the crew. They were mostly young girls dressed in hot pants and halter tops.
