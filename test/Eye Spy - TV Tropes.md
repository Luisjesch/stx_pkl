The ability to remove one's eye (real or false, magical or mechanical) and use it to view hard-to-see areas during certain situations after placing it somewhere. The eye is not in any way connected to the owner, yet it operates just as well as it was. Apart from the creepiness value, it can also work as a Surveillance Drone.

Compare Detachment Combat, Helping Hands, Losing Your Head.

A Sub-Trope of Faceless Eye. Can be used for Sinister Surveillance. For using eyes not one's own, see Seeing Through Another's Eyes and Animal Eye Spy.

Blofeld's eye later gets taken away and analyzed by Q.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The _Angel_ episode "I Fall to Pieces" features a creepy doctor who can do detach and levitate his eyes, his hands, etc. (pretty much take himself apart and put himself back together again at will). He uses his powers to stalk and eventually try to kill a nice young lady, providing her with some horrific moments (like disembodied hands crawling in her bed, up her legs...).
-   G'Kar picks up this ability on _Babylon 5_: after the deranged Centauri emperor gouges his eye out, it is later replaced with an artificial eye that can function even when removed from his eye socket. Being G'Kar, he exploits the Power Perversion Potential for all it's worth.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   The ocularon is a tentacled Living Gasbag known for plucking out the eyes of enemies and impaling them on the end of its tentacles. The creature can then animate those eyeballs and send them off as morbid surveillance drones, or fling them at enemies as poisonous projectiles.
    -   Hags can create "Hag Eyes", which are enchanted eyeballs that serve as scrying tools and which are cloaked with an illusion of being semi-precious gemstones. In at least some editions of the game, destroying a Hag Eye leads to painful backlash (damage and/or blindness) for its creator.
    -   In _Pathfinder_, hags can also use Hag Eyes to create a unique slime called the Hag Eye Ooze; a Blob Monster with a giant disembodied eyeball floating inside of it that its hag creator can see and channel spells through. They are considered more useful and reliable than just handing out Hag Eyes to humanoid minions. There's also a larger, nastier, multi-eyed version called the Coven Ooze, which is what happens when a Hag Eye Ooze survives the destruction of its creator and feeds on her coven's flesh, absorbing some measure of their intelligence in the process.
-   In _Hc Svnt Dracones_ the Utilit-i ocular implant is primarily used for Augmented Reality but its connection to the owner has a wireless range of 9 feet, and it can be connected to a network so someone can pop their eye out and leave it somewhere that has a public network and still see through it.
-   In _Shadowrun_ you have the option to replace one (or both) of your eyes with a Lone Star iBall. They are like normal cybereyes, until you take it out. Then they act as recon drones, which can roll around on the floor.
-   In _Vampire: The Requiem_, Belial's Brood has an investment called Flesh Spider that lets the detach body parts but still use them. This includes their eyes.

    Video Games 

-   _Blood II: The Chosen_ has an item called "The Eye". When used, Caleb drops it, but it still appears in the inventory; when toggled again, the player's view changes to the Eye itself, allowing them to look around where the Eye landed. Unfortunately, Caleb cannot throw the Eye more than a step in front of him, so in single player it's almost useless.
-   In _Borderlands 2_, a Bullymong steals Claptrap's eye from its socket. The following quest has the player and Claptrap finding said Bullymong, during which the blind robot mentions he can see what his eye is seeing when he's within range, similar to a Bluetooth connection.
-   A cutscene in _Dungeon Keeper 2_ has a skeleton pop its improbably pristine eye out and hold it to peep around a corner. Skeletons can't do this in-game, mind you.
-   _EverQuest_ has the ability with some spells, an item, and a monk disciple to send out an eye to investigate for you.
-   The Eye of Kilrogg spell in _Warcraft 2_ summons a floating eye that works like this.

    Web Animation 

-   _Happy Tree Friends_ certainly features this a lot, though given the nature of the show it's less of a visibility asset and much more of a tool to show exactly what's coming next in perhaps one of the most horrifying ways possible.
-   In _No Evil_ Huey (Huehuecoyotl) is known to juggle his eyes when bored. In one episode he tosses one over a roof to check if the coast is clear.

    Webcomics 

    Western Animation 

-   The whole point of Krumm's character design from _Aaahh!!! Real Monsters_. He doesn't even _have_ eye sockets — he carries his eyeballs around in his hands. They get thrown around or rolled into places where he wants to see quite a bit. Krumm's father looks almost identical, except that he's lost one of his eyes and wears a black glove on that hand to give the appearance of an Eyepatch of Power.
-   One of Gumball and Darwins' classmates in _The Amazing World of Gumball_ is a flying eyeball who acts as the Sadist Teacher's personal snitch.

-   In _Godzilla: The Series_, one of the N.I.G.E.L. robot's eyes is a mobile microcamera.
-   In _The Trap Door_, Berk manages to lose one of the Bad-Tempered Thing's (detachable) eyeballs. After he's spent most of the episode recovering it:
    
    **Berk:** Oh yes, I found it. But it's a good job Him Upstairs didn't see what happened to it.  
    **Thing:** But I did see, Berk. _\[the eyeball rotates.\]_ I saw everything!  
    **Berk:** Oh, globbits. I hates eyeballs.
