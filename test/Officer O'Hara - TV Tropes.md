_"And to his left is your typical drunken, oafish police chief with his hat on crooked, most likely named Barney O’Blarney or Patrick O’Hallorahanfitzmichael or something like that."_

In every police precinct, you'll have several stereotypical types of cops. The most common of these will always be the O'Hara, the cop with the whimsical Irish accent who usually stands on the sidelines, offering recycled stereotypical quips about St. Patrick and the green hills of Oireland.

This sort of officer rarely, if ever, resorts to force when dealing with a perp, but may visibly carry a nightstick. He will often have an impressive mustache.

Historically this was Truth in Television in many places in the English-speaking world. The original British police force was the Royal Irish Constabulary and it formed the basis for departments throughout Britain and the Empire, the first 2 commissioners of London's Metropolitan Police both ex-RIC men. The RIC also began the custom of law enforcement as a family tradition, sons of RIC officers being given preferential treatment in recruitment, allowed an inch off the regulation height (5'08) and a year off the minimum age. Police departments in American cities like New York (around 1900, five-sixths of the NYPD was Irish), Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Baltimore were disproportionately staffed by Irish immigrants.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  (This is the oft-cited reason why a police van was colloquially known as a "Paddy Wagon".<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ) A large wave of Irish immigration during the 19th century coincided with the time when major cities started establishing "professional" police forces, and police work was one of the few jobs open to Irish immigrants at the time. In Real Life, police forces offer many opportunities for recent immigrants, and they sign up, partly to protect their own people. This was exacerbated by the violence surrounding the partition of Ireland between 1916-23 which saw the murder of hundreds of police officers, many resigning and emigrating to join forces abroad, especially in America. Because early police work closely resembled thuggery, it was not a prestigious position, and because poorly-paid police were vulnerable to corruption, the police were widely despised. It did not take long for the urban police and The Irish Mob to become partners.

Mostly a Discredited Trope these days. Of course, Irish-American cops still show up frequently (noticeably in _The Departed_ in which nearly all the cop characters are Boston Irish — and all of the criminals are part of The Irish Mob), but the just-off-the-boat accent and whimsy are long gone — except somewhat in Historical Fiction. In modern works, Irish-American officers might be following in the footsteps of several generations of police families and/or trying to live up to a parent who died in the line of duty. Additionally, in many modern works, cops in big-city police departments on the East Coast are often portrayed as being honorarily Irish even if they are not of actual Irish descent — which, given the extensive adoption of Irish customs within these departments (particularly wakes for fallen officers and fake wakes for retired ones) is more or less Truth in Television (see _The Wire_ for a good example: the Baltimore P.D. is one of those departments; also, many NYCPD-focused shows will have this element show up).<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

The modern version of this trope could be called the "Officer Hernandez", as Hispanic recruits often make up a disproportionate amount of new hires in modern-day American police departments and security guard jobs. In some places, such as Miami-Dade, Hispanic officers even make up a majority of the local police force. The reasons for this are remarkably similar to why the Irish-American policeman of the past came to be, in that police work is difficult and unloved, but offers plenty of opportunities for upwards social mobility that make them appealing to recent immigrants.

Compare Irish Priest, the other stereotypically Irish profession in American fiction. Obviously a case of People Sit on Chairs if the work is actually _set_ in Ireland.

Not to be confused with police officers in the Republic of Ireland, who are called _gardaí_ (singular _garda_) and colloquially known as "guards".

    Advertising 

-   Officer Clancy in this vintage Australian ad for Fanta.
-   Frankenberry met a cop like this in one commercial where he was terrified of the Ghost Marshmallows in his cereal. ("What's with all the childish hankie-pankie, Frankie?" says the officer.)
-   Officer Crumb from the Cookie Crisp commercials is a caricature of the Trope.
-   Anther parody is Officer Big Mac from old '70s McDonald's commercials.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The first American dub of _Rurouni Kenshin_ had the cops sporting Irish accents; fortunately this tested so poorly that it went back for redubbing before the commercial release.
-   _Patlabor_ fell into this trope more or less by accident (there is no evidence they did the research), by giving their (half) Japanese-American New York Cop the very Irish (and noted) name of Clancy, Kanuka Clancy (a Shout-Out to Tom Clancy). It helped a lot of fans with the Fridge Logic of why someone from Hawaii would join the NYPD.
-   In the English dub of _SD Gundam Force_, one of the mobile police officers in Neotopia has a distinctly Irish accent.
-   The Streamline Pictures dub of _The Mystery of Mamo_ gave the police commissioner an Irish accent.

    Board Games 

-   In _Monopoly_, Officer Edgar Mallory is the one who hauls Rich Uncle Pennybags off to jail when a player lands on the "Go to Jail" space, rolls 3 consecutive doubles, or draws a "Go to Jail" card from either the Chance or Community Chest decks.

    Comic Books 

-   Mickey Mouse Comic Universe: Comics where Mickey Mouse is a detective (often Mickey's on-again, off-again freelance job) have a beefy uniformed police chief named O'Hara as Mickey's boss. He originally appeared with an accent, though in the 1960s it was dropped. In a few later cartoons (notably on _House of Mouse_), O'Hara did appear with an accent. And it's back, too, in most new comics produced since the 1990s. It must be noted that with or without the accent, Mickey's O'Hara is a competent, long-suffering cop whose real problem isn't his own weakness — it's that his chief of detectives, Mr. Casey, is an overconfident blunderer (whom Mickey has inadvertently upstaged many times, leading to a friendly rivalry).
-   _Little Lulu_ features Clarence McNabb who is depicted as a truant officer in early installments, and as a regular patrolman in the 1990s animated series.
-   The O'Dare family in _Starman_ is third generation Irish-American and third generation police. Hope, the only daughter, is particularly proud of her heritage, complete with a love of Irish cuisine and Celtic music and a hatred for the English.
-   _X-Men Noir_ is set in 1937, and Chief Eric Magnus is an Eastern European immigrant cop who is bitter over being discriminated against by the Irish-American cops who dominate the NYCPD; he claims he failed the Sergeant's Exam three times just because he doesn't have a shred of Irish heritage. It's never explicitly spelled out, but it's notable that none of the members of his clandestine "Brotherhood" are Irish, either.
-   In the _Spirou & Fantasio_ album _Luna fatale_ (which features a Mafia/Tong war), all NYC policemen have Irish names.
-   In _Batman: Dark Victory_, Clancy O'Hara was Gotham Police Chief at the beginning of the story. He's the first victim of the Hangman murders.

    Comic Strips 

-   Chief O'Reilly from the _Bananaman_ comic book and animated series, who was a parody/homage of Chief O'Hara from _Batman_.

    Films — Animated 

-   _Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse_: Captain Stacy calls himself "an Irish cop" when one of his co-workers asks him if he can speak Italian to a version of The Vulture who speaks the language.
-   _Batman: Gotham by Gaslight_ makes both Comissioner Gordon and Sergeant Bullock Irish.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Prison Guard O'Hara in the case of _The Big House_ and Pop Riker the guard. Pop is the more sympathetic, good-hearted guard, in contrast to the cruel and not-Irish Marlowe.
-   Irish cops aplenty in the movie _Blown Away_, set in present-day Boston. To judge from this movie, it seems that the Boston Police Department recruits solely from those fresh off the potato boat from Ireland.
-   In _Brannigan_, John Wayne portrays Lt. Jim Brannigan, an Irish-American officer with the Chicago police department, who goes to London to extradite a gangster who is being held for ransom. Brannigan experiences a culture clash when meeting the British police, using methods considered unorthodox by British police standards, with a conflict involving Commander Swann regarding Brannigan's use of a .38 Colt Diamondback revolver.
-   Subverted by Officer Jones in _Bridesmaids_ as actor Chris O'Dowd uses his native accent even though he's playing a Wisconsin state trooper, since the production crew liked it too much.
-   Officer Mulroney (the ultra-Irish-looking John C. Reilly) in _Gangs of New York_ is a former Irish gang member who fought with an axe. He now works for Nativist gang leader Bill "The Butcher" of the Natives.
    
    **Mulroney:** _\[as he tries to kill Vallon\]_ Ach, do ye remember yer fadda, lad. Ooh, the toimes we had...
    
-   _Deadly Hero_ (1975) has Don Murray as one of these-an Irish-American-as one of New York City's not-so-finest who fatally shoots a surrendering criminal then tries terrorizing the crook's victim out of testifying against the so called titluar "hero".
-   _Fort Apache, The Bronx_ stars Paul Newman as a third generation New York City police officer who's this (after his father and grandfather before him).
-   _Gentlemen Explorers_: The copper who arrests Riley and the Magician at the brothel has what was probably intended to be an Irish accent, but quickly becomes What the Hell Is That Accent?
-   _The Godfather_: Captain Mark McCluskey, whose father was a police captain as well.
-   _Going My Way_ features Officer McCarthy as the local Irish beat cop, but since there's an Irish Priest in the parish church and seemingly most of the older people in the neighborhood are Irish immigrants, it's natural enough.
-   _The Green Hornet Serials_: Mike Axford was this trope until he retired and became Britt's bodyguard. Several of his buddies on the force fit here as well.
-   _Hoodlum_ provides an example with Captain Foley's character. Crooked type.
-   In _Johnny Dangerously_, Alan Hale Jr.'s character was one of these.
-   In _The Killer That Stalked New York_, a 1950 film Very Loosely Based on the 1947 New York City smallpox outbreak, there's Officer Houlihan, who brings a young woman to Dr. Wood's clinic after she almost fainted out on the streets. Dr. Wood and his nurse discuss this, making it clear by briefly imitating Houlihan's accent that they don't agree with Houlihan's assessment that the patient needed immediate medical attention. What they don't know is that this woman is Sheila Bennet, Patient Zero for the smallpox outbreak.
    
    **Dr. Wood:** Another emergency?  
    **Nurse:** She fainted.
    
-   In _L.A. Confidential_, Captain Dudley Smith is this complete with the off-the-boat accent and stereotypical expressions.
-   Several Irish-American policemen and other civil servants appear in the John Ford film _The Last Hurrah_, most notably at Knocko Minihan's wake, when the Irish-surnamed officer assures Mayor Frank Skeffington that "The whole precinct is behind you".
-   _Little Annie Rooney_: A silent film can't demonstrate Officer Rooney's ethnicity with accents, so the title cards have him say stuff like, "'Tis proud I am."
-   In _A Matter of Life and Death_, the Irish member of the original Jury of the Damned is swapped out for an American when the defence objects. Specifically, he is swapped out for an Irish-American cop played by the same actor.
-   _No God, No Master_: William Flynn, the Irish American main character who's an agent with the Bureau of Investigation at the US Justice Department.
-   _One Good Cop_ has Michael Keaton's titluar character's (Arthur 'Artie' Lewis) commanding officer, 'Lt. Danny Quinn' (Kevin Conway), as one of these, but a more understanding one when he finds out why Lewis committed the robbery on the drug dealers that his squad and a state undercover agent were investigating.
-   Parodied in _The Other Guys_ during the scene in the Irish bar.
-   Played for laughs in the 2005 version of _The Producers_ (which is set in 1958, when this trope had already become irrelevant in Real Life). Two NYCPD cops with very thick stereotypical Irish brogues come to investigate goings-on in Max's apartment and discover Max and Leo Bloom's "cooked books" from their fraud scheme. Also, Max tries to bluff his way past the cops by assuming a ridiculous parody of a brogue in which his voice keeps getting higher and higher.
-   _Q & A_ has Nick Nolte as one of these, a murderous bigoted tool of an ambitious Homicide Bureau chief and who sees himself as a "line" that keeps minorities downtrodden and subordinate.
-   _Somebody Up There Likes Me_: More plot-relevant than this trope usually is. There's ethnic tension between the Irish beat cops and the local residents of New York City's Little Italy. One Irish cop calls Rocky Graziano a "greaseball".
-   In _Superman: The Movie_, the first two Metropolis police officers to encounter the Man of Steel are straight examples of this trope.
-   Subverted in _Super Troopers_; Captain John O'Hagan (played by a Scotsman) of the Vermont State Police is probably the most competent and serious member of his department. In fact, he's probably the most competent and serious officer in the whole movie. He also takes a moment to mock the trope by briefly adopting a brogue and saying the following line when one of his men is trying to pull a fast one on him:
    
    _I'll believe ya when me shit turns purple and smells like rainbow sherbet._
    
    -   This later gets turned around on him, complete with fake Irish accent, leading him to ask if it sounds like that when he does it.
-   Irish-American James Cagney has a _great_ scene in the 1932 Warner Bros. film _Taxi_, in which he launches into an extended conversation in Yiddish in the presence of an Irish cop.
-   Played with in _Two If By Sea_: FBI Agent O'Malley is African-American, and it becomes a Running Gag that everyone is surprised to find out that he's not Irish when they first meet him.
-   Jimmy Malone in _The Untouchables (1987)_, who was completely and utterly invented for the movie. The real Eliot Ness knew what he was doing from the start, and didn't need a wise mentor to show him the ropes but apparently, that wouldn't be dramatic enough. Also, Sean Connery is not Irish, no matter what the other characters say.

    Literature 

-   _A Tree Grows in Brooklyn_ features a cop named Michael McShane.
-   Sgt. Murphy in Richard Scarry's _Busytown_ books.
-   Paddy in _Make Way For Ducklings_.
-   Stephen King featured Irish police officer Aloysius Nell in _It_, down to the Batmanesque "Chief O'Hara" accent. One of Richie's funny voices in the same story is also the Irish Cop.
    -   Officer Nell shows up in other King stories set in that area, too.
-   There's a scene in H. P. Lovecraft's "The Haunter of the Dark" where the protagonist is researching a local desecrated chapel and is told that all the Catholics in the area know the story behind it. So he asks the nearest police officer, "a great wholesome Irishman."
    -   Det. Thomas Malone in "The Horror at Red Hook" is another one, "tall, heavily built, and wholesome-looking," "large, robust, normal-featured, and capable-looking", pragmatic but with a mystical, poetic streak attributed to his Celtic heritage.
-   Deconstructed in Tom Wolfe's _The Bonfire of the Vanities_. Prosecutor Larry Kramer observes that all NYCPD officers eventually adopt the Irish persona regardless of their ethnic background, and how he, too, a Jew, had learned to be "as Irish as they come" when visiting crime scenes.
-   Captain Dudley Smith may seem like this in James Ellroy's _L.A. Quartet_ but is in reality something very different.
-   Roald Dahl wrote a short story in which a wealthy New York City couple, having forgotten their keys, attempt to break into their own house — and are promptly shot dead by a gang of Irish cops.
-   _The Cabinet of Curiosities_ features NYPD officer Patrick "Paddy" O'Shaughnessey, who is described as having "probably the most Irish name in New York." The book then goes on to subvert the trope at every turn, making him a boon to the investigation, a guy with a standard New York City accent, and a lover of opera.
-   Invoked in Tom Clancy's _Patriot Games_ when Jack Ryan tells the Queen that Irish Americans have a tradition of being the forces of order — cops, firefighters, and clergy, especially — and nowadays, the most famous Irish in the world are terrorists, something Jack is certain his father, Officer Ryan, wouldn't have liked at all. "He spent his whole working life taking animals like that off the street and putting them in cages where they belong."
-   Julius Cohan in _Tales from Gavagan's Bar_.
    -   From the _Harold Shea_ series (by the same authors), there's Pete Brodsky, a.k.a. "the synthetic harp". As his last name suggests, he's not Irish at all, but he has deliberately adopted a thick brogue and the stereotypical mannerisms of the Irish cop. As he explains to the main character, the police department he's in is overwhelmingly Irish — including all the higher-ups — and that means if you aren't Irish, you'll stay a beat cop your whole career.
-   _The Betsy_ series by Carolyn Haywood features a friendly red-headed policeman named Mr. Kilpatrick. At one point he talks about his granny in Ireland.
-   Karrin Murphy of _The Dresden Files_ is a Chicago cop, the scion of a large clan of cops and has a very Irish surname. Officers Thomas Malone and Ronald Carmichael are two of her co-workers.
-   The _Past Doctor Adventures_ novel _Illegal Alien_, which transposes a number of American hardboiled detective tropes to Britain, plays with it by having a Northern Irish Chief Inspector in the Met, who says things like "Saints preserve us", but also suspects all Irish-Americans of being IRA sympathisers.
-   Craig Shaw Gardner's Cineverse Cycle has the helpful Officer O'Clanrahan, companion to the astounding Dwight the Wonder Dog. He eventually turns out to be secretly working with Doctor Dread because he's tired of playing sidekick to a dog, but by the end, he's changed his mind and repents his evil ways.
-   Officer Garroway in _The Small Bachelor_ by P. G. Wodehouse, which is set in New York City. When Waddington goes in search of Garroway to attempt to buy back some shares he sold him, he can't remember Garroway's name; only that it was something Irish. As a result, he ends up encountering an endless succession of other policemen with Irish names.
-   _American Gods_: When Mr. Wednesday teaches Shadow about his favorite cons, he mentions one involving him playing a police officer with "a broad, honest Irish face" and a fresh-off-the-boat music-hall accent two miles thick.
-   _That Hideous Strength_: The evil organization N.I.C.E. uses a paramilitary police force to take over Edgestow, England. It is composed of mostly immigrants, including Captain O'Hara from Dublin. He is only seen a few times and doesn't engage in the brutality and torture that the other officers do.

    Live-Action TV 

-   The finale of _9/11_ (a documentary about the September 11th attacks) shows a picture of each of the firemen and policemen who died in the Twin Towers. The musical accompaniment was "Danny Boy," which fit because an enormous amount of them were Irish.
-   Captain Connor in _The Alienist_ is an Irish policemen in late 1800s New York City.
-   _All in the Family_ has occasional episodes of this, ex. Season 4's "The Taxi Caper" (1973)
-   _Batman (1966)_:
    -   Chief O'Hara is probably one of the more famous O'Haras. He also appeared in the comics, first mentioned slightly after the show's debut, but not actually appearing on-panel until well into the 1970s. He has appeared sporadically in later years, though usually not as part of the main Batman continuity.
    -   One episode (_Marsha, Queen of Diamonds_) had seven cops named O'Hara, Douglas, O'Malley, O'Toole, O'Leary, O'Reilly, and Goldberg.
-   _Blue Bloods_: The Reagan family is of Irish descent (with new Mayor Carter Poole even calling Frank a "white Irish cop" in the Season 2 premiere), but the trope is otherwise averted quite handily.
-   _Boardwalk Empire_:
    -   The Thompsons are Irish-Americans, with Nucky serving as Sheriff Lindsay's deputy, and later as Sheriff in the Atlantic City political machine run by the Commodore, before becoming the county treasurer. His brother Eli follows him as Sheriff, which he retains until he's forced out at the end of season 2 for his part in the Commodore's conspiracy to overthrow Nucky.
    -   Season 5 features a fictionalized version of Mike Malone, an Irish-American treasury agent who gets into Al Capone's inner circle by pretending to be an Italian named Mik
-   _Brooklyn Bridge_ (1991-1993) has James Naughton's recurring 'Lt. Patrick Monahan' character as such-one of New York City's finest of its 1950's timeframe.
-   _Brooklyn South_ (1997-1998) have several, both younger officers and veterans, that fit this ethnicity.
-   _Copper_ is justified since it takes place in 1864. The rank-and-file police officers shown are first generation immigrants who were born in Ireland. The police officer protagonists are named Corcoran, Maguire, and O'Brien. Corcoran even Lampshades the fact that their captain is as Irish as they are but the captain's father dropped the 'O' from O'Sullivan when they arrived in America.
-   _Castle_:
    -   Downplayed Trope with Kevin Ryan. He doesn't have the accent and is at least one generation, possibly more, removed from Ireland. Still, references to his Irish heritage crop up now and again, such as being raised Catholic and having gone undercover with an Irish-American gang in his earlier years.
    -   And in "The Blue Butterfly", one of the heavies in the 1940s diary story that set the scene was an Irishman, complete with calling everyone "boy-o"...whom Castle imagines as Ryan.
-   _CSI: NY_ averts it. Mac may be part Irish, and Flack is Irish, but they don't fall into the trope.
    -   Mac is part Welsh on his mother's side, per episode 8.18, "Near Death."
-   _The Electric Company (1971)_: Jim Boyd and Skip Hennant play, as par for the show, ineffectual versions of this.
-   In _The District_, Detective McGregor is an actual Irishman who'd immigrated to the US and became a cop.
-   _Golden Boy_ briefly discusses it in one episode. Walter's sister Agnes asks Detective Deb McKenzie if there's any bigger cliche in New York City than a waitress wanting to make it big:
    
    **Deb:** (_gesturing at herself_) Irish cop?
    
-   _Harry and Paul_ sends it up with Officers O'Malley-Mulligan-Hoolagey and O'Pat-Eddery-Flannery-Hoonigan in "The Cops" sketch:
-   _Hawaii Five-O_ (both versions). Averted with Steve McGarrett.
-   _The Job_: The protagonist is an Irish-American police officer in modern-day New York City. Both he and his fellow officers often mention and light-heartedly make fun of his Irish heritage.
-   _Law & Order_: Detectives Greevey and Logan from season 1 are both Irish-American, as is ADA Stone (and later Jack McCoy, and judging from a crack made about her, ADA Kincaid as well). Inevitably, there's an episode involving The Troubles.
-   _Law & Order: UK_: DS Matt Devlin (Logan's Expy). However, it never becomes an issue, except in one scene where he references his heritage in order to gain the trust of a young prostitute he's questioning, and another where he mentions being hassled about it during his rookie years, "They called me "mick" for the first six months because my family are Irish". Despite the UK setting, this is about as close as a reference to The Troubles as we've gotten.
-   The _Lois & Clark_ episode "Fly Hard" involves an extended How We Got Here Flashback to the Prohibition era with the regulars playing the characters in the flashback. This means the cop in the flashback is Irish, fond of alcohol, and on the take. The cop is being played by Lane Smith, the actor who plays Perry White, and let's just say Smith's genial Southern good-ol'-boy drawl (his normal voice for Perry) is a bit more convincing than his Officer O'Hara-style Irishman.
-   _Murder, She Wrote_
    -   Jessica's Friend on the Force in the episode "Unwilling Witness" is a man named Sean Riley with a strong Irish accent.
    -   One "Jessica's friends" Poorly Disguised Pilot was "O'Malley's Luck", about an NYPD lieutenant so Irish he actually had a map of Ireland on the wall of his office.
-   _Mystery Science Theater 3000_:
    -   Pretty much every time a policeman appears in one episode, Tom Servo says "A'right, show's over folks. Nothin' ta see, here," in a fake Irish accent. Is it worth pointing out Servo was voiced by Kevin Murphy?
    -   Directly addressed in a skit at the end of "The Indestructible Man". After Joel swears to stop making jokes about policemen and their alleged love for doughnuts, Kevin Murphy and Mike Nelson appear as policemen and begin complaining about other stereotypes about the police, including this one:
-   _Ohara_ plays with and averts this trope — "Ohara" (without an apostrophe) is a Japanese name, and the title character, Police Chief Ohara, was played by Pat Morita.
-   _O Hara US Treasury_: It's in the title.
-   _Psych_ averts it. There is a _Detective_ O'Hara, but that's her name, and she is stated to be Scottish in one episode. Her partner, Carlton Lassiter, is Irish, but he doesn't act like this and isn't native to Ireland. It doesn't help that Timothy Omundson, who plays Lassiter, once played an evil leprechaun in a Disney film.
-   _Rescue Me_: The Gavin family is almost absurdly proud of being New York City Irish. The family has a tradition of being both cops and firefighters; one of the main drivers of the plot is firefighter Tommy Gavin's recurring nightmare/possible haunting by the ghost of his cop brother Johnny. His other younger brother Timo is also NYPD.
-   _Revolution_: In "Sex and Drugs", The O'Hallorans, the neighboring family that is burning Drexler's poppy fields, are a long line of such, although the father's primary motivation is personal: Drexel killed his daughter with a heroin overdose.
-   _Single Handed_ is an Irish show about an Irish Garda in Western Ireland.
-   _Space Precinct_, a "Cops in Space" show made by Gerry Anderson, starred Ted Shackelford as veteran former New York City cop Patrick Brogan, but the Irish accent came from Captain Podly, an alien played by an actor with a giant puppet head. Ridiculous stereotypical accent aside, Podly was still a perfectly competent cop and got a few badass moments.
-   _Super Adventure Team_: Chief O'Brien of the NYCPD is a black man with a thick Irish accent.
-   The eleventh season of _Survivor_ had Amy O'Hara, a police sergeant from Boston.
-   _Walt Disney Presents_: In _Michael O'Hara the Fourth_, the O'Haras are a multi-generational family of cops. A flashback shows Michael O'Hara the First to have been a stereotypical turn-of-the-century Irish cop.
-   Deconstructed in _Warrior (2019)_, which is set in 1870s San Francisco, and shows exactly how Irish-Americans immigrants - via police departments or The Irish Mob, which are treated as inextricably linked to the point where they're almost interchangeable - were used as a cudgel against Chinese immigrants by the WASP-y robber barons and elites of the day, mainly to keep labor cheap.
-   In _The Wire_, even though the Baltimore Police Department is racially mixed, with at least half of the officers African-American and another good chunk being Polish, their traditions still have a strongly Irish flavor. For example, they all attend Irish wakes for fallen officers at Kavanaugh's Pub, where Jay Landsman gives a eulogy to the departed and leads everyone in a passionate sing-along to The Pogues' "Body of an American." It's explicitly stated in David Simon's book _Homicide: A Year On The Killing Streets_ — on which the show is partially based, that no matter your origin, when you join the Baltimore PD you become "honorary Irish". More directly, several police characters actually are Irish-American, including ostensible lead Jimmy McNulty and the first-season "humps" Polk and Mahon.
-   Since the NYPD is very prominently a feature of the Netflix Marvel shows, a number of cops with Irish ancestry do show up. The second season of _The Punisher_ features one Officer O'Rourke who tries to collect on a bounty on Frank Castle's head to avenge family of his who were in the Kitchen Irish, while _Daredevil_ gives us Brett Mahoney, Foggy Nelson's longtime Friend on the Force.

    Music 

-   Also regarding The Pogues is their hit Christmas song "Fairytale of New York", whose chorus goes "The boys in the NYPD choir were singing "Galway Bay" // And the bells were ringin' out for Christmas Day."
    -   The Pogues' "Thousands are Sailing", about Irish immigrants to America, asks "Did you work upon the railroad? Did you rid the streets of crime?"
-   Billy Joel's "Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)" namechecks a certain "Sergeant O'Leary," who works a second job as a bartender so he can afford a fancy car.
-   From all the way back in 1896, Percy French's _The Mountains of Mourne_ has a verse in which the singer (an Irishman gone to London to seek work) encounters his old friend Peter O'Loughlin who is now "the head of the force".
-   The ballad "The Streets of New York" by Irish folk band The Wolfe Tones tells the story of an Irishman from Dublin who moves to New York and becomes a policeman, seemingly following the footsteps of his uncle who lives there.
-   Also in Pat White’s “The Same Old Shilleleagh” the singer announces he will join the police “cause it’s the only thing to do”… but instead off nightstick he will carry the same old shilleleagh his father brought from Ireland.
-   Some older New York City salsa music (1940s) uses local slang that includes the word _la jara_ ("the O'Hara," that is, the cops) which is exactly this trope. Examples:
-   Cypress Hill's "I Ain't Goin' Out Like That" includes the line "Gonna put a slug in Captain O'Malley."

    Radio 

-   Officer O'Ryan fits the trope to a T in _Adventures in Odyssey_. In fact, he was the town's only cop until the introduction of Captain Quinn.
-   Invoked in _The Jack Benny Program_ whenever they did a mystery sketch: Jack played "that master super-sleuth, Captain O'Benny", and other characters playing his assistants got O's added to their names too: O'Harris, O'Day, O'Wilson... Although when Dennis Day (well-known for his (intentionally cultivated) Irish accent) tried to ham up the role with said, Jack told him to "cut out the dialect".
-   Frequently invoked in the radio show _Lights Out._ In one episode, "The Author and the Thing," a fictionalized version of the show's lead writer Arch Oboler meets two cops who comment (in Irish accents) that he's "the guy who always makes his cops Irish."

    Theater 

-   In the Screen-to-Stage Adaptation remake of _The Producers_, three stereotypical Irish cops arrest Max and Leo: O'Rourke, O'Riley, and O'Houllihan, the last of these played by a black man. ("I've heard of black Irish, but this is ridiculous!")

-   Lonigan in _Wonderful Town_, who with the other cops launches into a song and jig under the impression that Eileen is Irish, too.
