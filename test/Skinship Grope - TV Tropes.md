At least they're asking nicely.

**Kyou**: Kotomi... are you all right? He didn't do anything weird to you, right? Like suddenly clinging behind you against your will or touching your butt and breasts...  
**Tomoya**: Didn't you do that before?  
**Kyou**: It's fine if it's me, I'm her friend after all.

In a highly hierarchical society, communal bathing is seen as a great equalizing social event, vital in establishing a close, healthy relationship with peers and family.

A Furo Scene with girls will inevitably end up with one character admiring another's physical development, with subsequent teasing and tickling. An added gag is a highly flustered male on the men's side of the bath only being able to hear the discussion and either taking it out of context or trying to get a peek, sometimes both. This is commonly used as fanservice, but pops up in Shōjo as well as Shōnen. This fanservice-oriented trope is much rarer with guys, aside from playful horsing around—with the obvious occasional exception of the Yaoi Genre.

A related trope in the West is the Womens' Locker Room, which in a certain kind of work is synonymous with platonic (or not) Les Yay.

Although baths, hot springs, beaches, and locker rooms are the most likely settings, any scene where a girl decides to get playful with her friend's… assets falls under this trope. Even being close friends isn't a hard rule, though you have to question the motives of someone who gropes people they barely know for fun.

Any protest from the one being groped is likely to be responded to with "Don't be silly! We're both girls, so it's okay." Although this almost always works in anime for the sake of fanservice, suggesting it in Real Life is not a good idea. Kids, Don't Try This at Home, there's an almost certain chance you'll ruin a friendship and get charged for harassment.

Compare and contrast with Thanks for the Mammary, Girl on Girl Is Hot, and Double Standard: Rape, Female on Female. Also contrast Feeling Your Heartbeat, which can be fanservicey but is much less invasive and usually has a more pure intent behind it.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You_: Girlfriend #15, Momiji Momi, has a fetish for groping women's chests and hopes to become a professional masseuse one day.
-   _A Certain Magical Index_: Kuroko thinks 'intimacy' is wonderful. Mikoto disagrees, as she does not enjoy being groped while the groper sounds steadily more and more excited... Yeah, she gets booted through the door.
-   _Ah! My Goddess_
    -   In an early chapter, Urd chases Skuld with the intent of administering, in her own words, the "Big Sister Bust Size Check''.
    -   This also happens in the TV series—but it's Belldandy showing affection to Skuld, so it tiptoes into sweet and heartwarming territory.
-   This is Tina Foster's main schtick in the first season of _Ai Yori Aoshi_ before becoming a more serious character in later episodes/chapters of the manga. It's most certainly _not_ relegated solely to the furo house.
    
    **Suzuki**: Oh, don't mind. That's just Tina's socially awkward way of saying hello.  
    **Tina**: _\[groping Taeko\]_ Man, you got some _serious_ melons!
    
-   In _Akahori Gedou Hour Lovege_ Aimi does this to Kaoruko quite a few times. Sure, it's part of their comic routine, but she loves doing it outside of it as well.
-   In Episode 4 of the _All-Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku_ OAV series, Eimi seemingly plays this trope to the letter with her fellow Robot Girl, Nuku Nuku, admiring her body to the clear enjoyment of the men on the other side of the wall. (Luckily, Nuku Nuku's "brother" Ryuunosuke is just young enough to not completely understand the implications.) The trope is slightly subverted here, though, since Eimi's body is defective and will soon self-destruct, so the real reason she was admiring Nuku Nuku's body was because Eimi intends to deactivate her and take over the more stable chassis.
-   _Bleach_:
    -   Rangiku arrives at Orihime's house and takes a bath. While talking to Orihime she decides to jump out of the tub and hug Orihime, then tickles her. Happens in both the manga and the anime.
    -   Episode 228 beach episode. Rangiku is suspicious when Lieutenant Nanao Ise suddenly has larger breasts than she remembers. She hugs Nanao from behind and gropes her breasts to discover that she's using falsies under her bikini to make her breasts look bigger.
    -   Episode 239. While Rangiku and Momo's zanpakuto spirits (Haineko and Tobiume) are together, Haineko feels up Tobiume's breasts from behind and makes fun of her over their small size.
-   Mahiro does this to Tokiko in the anime version of _Buso Renkin_ (this scene wasn't in the manga).
-   In _Code:Breaker_, the Cloudcuckoolander Nenene likes to grope Sakura's breasts, even nicknames them "hii-tan" and "mii-tan", which obviously comes from the Japanese words _hidari_ for "left" and _migi_ for "right", coupled with the affectionate suffix "-tan".
-   _Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion_
    -   In the show itself, Shirley is a frequent victim of this from Milly.
    -   One of the DVD extra picture dramas features an entire skinship scene featuring naked Kallen, Milly, Nina and Shirley. Kallen was not amused. Fanboys (and more than one fangirl) were.
-   _Crimson Spell_ has a rare male-on-male example. Vald does this _daily_ when he and Mars bathe together while traveling, giving Mars a "towel rub" and calling his chest "magnificent". Unlike most examples, Mars is downright cheerful about it.
-   One episode of _Cyber Team in Akihabara_ featured the main characters, who interestingly enough only got this much dialogue in the particular episode, doing what sounds for the life of them to be a very half-assed recitation of the typical conversation. It ends with an exasperated Lampshade Hanging by one of the other characters that "Yup, we've done every cliche in a hot springs episode…"
-   _The Day of Revolution_: Megumi complains that she feels like a pervert for "…wearing a bra over the breasts I don't have" after discovering she is intersexed and opting to identify as female. Makoto promptly investigates right there in a school hallway and immediately proves otherwise, much to Megumi's embarrassment.
-   _DearS_ has an entire episode devoted to this, with the Running Gag being that everyone keeps asking if it's a mixed bathing house when people start running in the wrong rooms.
-   There were several scenes in _Elfen Lied_. Kouta first did it accidentally to Nyuu, and for a while, she thought this was a socially acceptable practice. Even after she learns to act like a normal human being, she still gets the urge to do so.
-   _Eyeshield 21_ uses the teasing version of this trope. Suzuna is commenting on big Mamori's are, and says hers are still small like a kid's. They were discussing towels. Monta left a _face imprint_ on the other side.
-   _Fairy Tail_
    -   In the "Welcome to Fairy Hills" special chapter, Juvia expresses mortification at being in the public dormitory bath with the rest of the occupants. Bisca reminds her that they're all girls and proceeds to playfully poke and grope her.
    -   While the girls are relaxing in the bath, Cana asks Lucy if it is true that Natsu groped her once. When Lucy reluctantly confirms this, Cana says it is her turn and grabs her boobs.
    -   Erza considers this an essential part of bathing together for women, and is heartbroken that Mavis (an intangible ghost) cannot enjoy it.
-   _Full Metal Panic!_
    -   _Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu_'s "Hot Springs Episode". The boys are listening in as Melissa Mao starts rubbing ointment on clumsy girl Tessa's cute naked butt. When Mao starts moving on to other places and Tessa is heard telling Mao not to "stare at me like that!", cue immediate Nosebleed, even from experienced pervert Kurz Webber.
    -   In the OVA for the Second Raid, when Tessa falls asleep after Mao gives her some hard liquor, Mao takes advantage while she's sleeping to check her breast size.
-   Parodied in the _Genshiken_ manga, where Ohno (a Covert Pervert otaku) refers to this as "standard bath procedure", much to the disgust of non-otaku Saki. When it actually occurs to her, Ohno finds the reality not quite preferable…
-   In the _Getter Robo vs Devilman_ Crossover made by Go Nagai, Michiru Saotome and Miki—their respective series' female leads—play around while they are bathing, touching at each other.
-   This is done to Sayuki in episode six of _Girls Beyond the Wasteland_, when she asks the girls about their thoughts on breast size.
-   _Girls Bravo_ plays this for laughs, during the mudwrestling match between Kosame and Kirie. The moment Kosame pins her on the mat, she drops all pretense of grappling with her and starts groping her instead—going so far as to lay atop Kirie, while slipping her hands under her bra so she could fondle Kirie directly.
    
    **Kosame:** _\[dreamily\]_ Oh, Miss Kirie, ever since I first saw you, I've always wanted to do this. Your skin is sublime.  
    **Kirie:** _\[trying to crawl away\]_ Quit it!  
    **Kosame:** _\[not listening\]_ Uh-uh.  
    **Kirie:** _\[indignantly\]_ _LET GO OF MY BOOBS!!_  
    **Kosame:** _\[suggestively\]_ They're MINE now.
    
-   A Funny Background Event in _Girls und Panzer_; when the girls are getting measured for their new Sensha-do uniforms, flat-chested Mako can be seen fondling Saori in envy, must to the latter's displeasure.
-   In _GTO: Shonan 14 Days_, Urumi feels up Shinomi's breasts while they're both bathing together.
-   _Gunslinger Girl_. After making fourteen year-old cyborg girl Triela look older for a bodyguarding assignment, Sandro jokingly invites her handler Hilshire to cop a feel of Triela's padded breasts. "They're just like the real deal." Hilshire curtly declines, and after the two leave the room Sandro's cyborg Petra is shown carrying out his advice on an embarrassed Triela.
-   _Gunsmith Cats_ Vol. 1 features an opening scene Minnie-May gropes Rally after her regular target practice while commenting on how stiff her nipples were. Rally returns the favor after Minne-May lets one of her custom-made grenades fly and take out Bonnie's car. She even comments on how they feel like "tiny pebbles".
-   _Hanaukyō Maid Team_. During the episode 7 Hot Springs Episode, Ikyo Suzuki comes up behind Mariel and wraps her arms around her chest to feel her breasts.
-   In _Haruhi Suzumiya_, Haruhi is anything but shy about doing this to Mikuru, to her great displeasure<small>◊</small>. To lots of people, though, it crosses the line into Black Comedy Rape.
    -   Perhaps because in the Light Novels, Kyon only barely manages to prevent a clearly aroused Haruhi from going even further on several occasions.
        -   When she first gets Mikuru the maid getup, she still says "Let's all play with Mikuru!". Her Psycho Lesbian tendencies aren't completely expunged.
        -   Though that time it seems that Haruhi was genuinely blind to the implications. Kyon chastised her, mentioning that she's about to break several laws. Haruhi cluelessly asks: "What laws?", thinks for a moment and stops.
-   _Hayate the Combat Butler_
    -   Suprisingly, Risa rubs Hinagiku's breasts from behind.
    -   In a much later chapter, Hina gets her breasts rubbed from behind by Miki. While alone and naked in a bathtub.
    -   Even more surprising, Hayate himself nearly rubs Hinagiku's breats from behind without realizing it's her, and then a second time in an omake stating that Hina _does_ have something there. Both times he gets a Megaton Punch for his trouble.
-   In _Hetalia: Axis Powers_, Korea loves groping China and Japan's breasts. Even though all of them are male. Prussia also does this to Hungary, thinking that the latter's chest area is his weak spot after he complains of chest pains… only to find out that "he" is simply entering puberty.
-   _Hidamari Sketch_, the "Because We're Such Close Friends" strip<small>◊</small> (first half shown above): When Miyako and Yuno show Nori and Nazuna the bathhouse, Nori can't help but admire Miyako's size and asks permission to feel her up. Nazuna joins in; Yuno really wants to, as well, but backs down out of embarrassment, probably due to their experience of Bathtub Bonding.
-   _Highschool of the Dead_: The same scene is featured in both chapter 6 of the manga and the same episode of the anime:
    -   During the bath scene, Rei was so incredulous at the sheer size of Shizuka's breasts, that she absolutely _had to_ see if they were real. So she groped her to find out, though the reader doesn't get to see it happen. Instead, it immediately shifts over to show Saya's reaction, while Shizuka's cries of, "not there! ♥" and "no more! ♥" along with sound effect hiragana<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  are seen from just out of frame.
    -   The anime differs, by not only allowing you to see what Rei's doing, it _looks_ exactly the way Saya described it. Shizuka is shown bent over the side of the bathtub, with Rei fondling her boobs from behind. Though the animation makes it _seem_ like she's doing Shizuka doggy-style, making her breasts appear to bounce instead. When Saya looks over her shoulder and sees it, her eyes go wide in embarrassment, and she quickly turns back around.
    -   Two scenes later, Rei gropes Saeko's too, though Saeko was mindful to squeeze her thighs shut and cup her hands between them. Which mainly served to prevent the audience from seeing her nether region, but also made sense in context, given Shizuka's earlier cries of, "not there".
-   _Higurashi: When They Cry_ manga:
    -   Rika did this, to her (most likely just) best friend Satoko, at least a few times in omakes. They're both 9 year old girls. Though… Satoko is rather developed for her age.
    -   Also, Rika did this to Mion in an anime omake with different intentions.
-   In chapter 53 of _I"s_, several of Ichitaka's classmates are playing a game of "ousama" at Nami's house, where they draw numbered sticks and the "ousama" (king player) orders two random people to follow a certain command. When Kida becomes the ousama, he commands Nami to fondle Iori's breasts for 3 minutes.
-   _Kämpfer_: Considering that all the girls love Natsuru's female form, this should not be a surprise.
-   _Karin_: Karin's boss tries doing this to her to cheer her up. It doesn't work.
-   In _Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl_, Yasuna is all too eager to help Hazumu try on her first bra.
-   A chapter of _Sgt. Frog_ has Natsumi getting groped at the pool by a cadre of her fangirls, with an apology from the author for being unable to help himself.
-   In _K-On!_, a glassesless Sawako-sensei tries to differentiate between Mio and Azusa using their bust sizes and her own two hands. It didn't go over too well. (Someone with more normal eyesight could tell that Azusa was more deeply tanned, and that they have different eyes.)
-   This leads to the first (of many) Naked First Impression of the _Love Hina_ manga: Before encountering anyone, Keitaro notices the hot springs and can't resist taking a dip. Naru comes a few minutes later, and attempts this on the scared Keitaro, mistaking him for Kitsune. Cue Megaton Punch when she notices her error.
    -   Then repeated almost verbatim in the epilogue with Shinobu mistaking potential new resident Ema for Su...
-   Despite the relative lack of Fanservice, the _Love Live!_ series uses this as a Running Gag. Most notoriously Nozomi, whose best-known catchphrase is "washi washi" and involves grabbing the breasts of one of her fellow school idols. Mari does it as well in _Love Live! Sunshine!!_, although she does it a lot less and at one point someone physically retaliates against her for doing so.
-   Shikimori Kazuki in _Maburaho_ angers his male classmates when he enters the men's half of the bath and starts talking, preventing the other guys from hearing the girls talking during a Skinship Grope.
-   According to the Sound Stages, Hayate of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha_ has a tendency to do this to the Wolkenritter. _Including_ the overly serious Signum. _Including_ the Weapon of Mass Destruction Reinforce. She apparently does this to her subordinates when she grows up.
-   In _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_ episode 10, Subaru (whom rainbows are straighter than) tries various means to wake Teana up and finally decides to try to do so by squeezing her breasts. In the supplemental manga, Wendi does this to Deed.
    -   Sein gropes Rio's chest, Corona's butt and seems to grope Teana's crotch in chapter 11 of _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid_. Though in this case, she is called out on it and one character half-jokingly threatens to take her to court in retaliation.
-   _Maken-ki!_:
    -   First seen during the group's hotsprings trip in chapter 4. Kimi was so awed by the sheer size of Ms. Aki's boobs, that she asks if she can touch them. Aki complies out of amusement over Kimi's enthusiasm.
    -   Chacha also has a habit of groping Haruko, such as chapter 26 when she did it to tease Takeru. In chapter 33, she does it in front of Uruchi, while they were bathing outdoors. Uruchi spurts a nosebleed, due to her crush on Haruko, and passes out with a smile on her face.
-   _Mermaid's Forest_ has one of these scenes. In this example, both women involved are semi-immortal from eating mermaid flesh. One of them gropes the other as a way of examining the latter's body, because she's planning to have her own head transplanted onto the latter's body (who, unlike herself, had not been affected by the bad side-effects of the mermaid flesh).
-   _Minami-ke_ has a variation in episode 6, when Haruka tries to help another character buy a bra. Oh, and she's unaware that the person she's groping is a boy.
-   _Miss Machiko_ has a few furo and shower scenes between the eponymous teacher and her female students. This happens from time to time but considering the nature of the show, everyone eventually gets a feel.
-   In _My Bride is a Mermaid_, Mawari Zenigata does this to the other girls in the baths. However, she does not consider herself a lesbian and _does not_ think Girl on Girl Is Hot, or at least not when done in a public setting.
-   Parodied in _Mythical Detective Loki Ragnarok_. The male characters can hear the girls on the other side talking about all wanting to pet something, how incredibly soft it is, etc. and suffer from spontaneous nosebleeds. It is then revealed that the Loki's pet has gotten into the girls side and that they are all playing with it.
-   Gender-inverted primarily for comedic purposes in _Naruto_, in which Sai makes fun of Naruto's... size ("Oh, you have one after all?"), much to the amusement (considering how loud Naruto gets) of the women on the other side, and to Sakura's embarrassment.
-   A chapter of _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ features a girl who does this to total strangers more or less entirely for the pleasure of feeling other girls' breasts. She even rates them on a \[presumably\] 100-point scale, and provides detailed commentary vaguely reminiscent of someone doing a wine-tasting.
    
    "Mmm, full bodied and yet a distinct lack of stiffness… the subtle complexion, reminiscent of sakura in early spring… the tenderness of the skin… the still-ripening springiness practically bursting from the surface… truly a fine article!
    
    -   This almost gets her killed. The girls are _not_ amused or too flustered to react by the time the traumatic incident is over.
    -   Of course, she only gets off because she somehow gets Chamo blamed for it. He's still alive after the fact, so apparently they weren't really going to kill her.
        -   Or that it's just par for the course with Chamo.
    -   The second to last chapter takes this almost to point of Black Comedy Rape.
-   _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ has Misato groping Asuka. However, the whole bit is done entirely with dialogue, and we just see Shinji's reaction.
-   _Ninja Nonsense_ parodies the crap out of this, with Onsokumaru attempting to join Kaede and Shinobu in the bathtub. He (and the gang of ninja) ends up tied to a giant bag of trash. Then there's what actually occurs in the bathroom…
    
    **Shinobu**: Oops! My hand slipped!
    
-   _One Piece_: After the events of Alabasta, the crew is relaxing in the baths. On one side you have the men being dorks, and on the other you have Vivi washing Nami's back, who looks at her playfully, then asks to switch.
-   _PandoraHearts_: In the 9th omake there's a picture of Lotti groping a blushing Ada's breasts.
-   _Pani Poni Dash!_: Himeko, the class moron, sniffs classmate Rei then begins rubbing her face in her breasts. It wasn't sexual, though; Rei works in a chinese restaurant so she had the scent of crab fried rice on her and Himeko absolutely loves crab.
-   In _Paradise Kiss_, when Yukari is in her underwear so Miwako can take her measurements, the latter happily exclaims "_aw, cute bra!_" and proceeds to poke her breasts.
-   _Ranma ½_ has several very odd examples: When Ranma (in girl form) is first introduced to the Tendos Nabiki pokes her breasts twice (much to Ranma's repressed annoyance): once to demonstrate that yes, she is indeed a girl and the second time just to reinforce the point. Later on towards the end of the manga Nabiki gropes Ranma _again_ and confirms that girl-Ranma's breasts have indeed grown _even larger_, in a scene many consider the biggest example of Les Yay in the manga (which is normally rather opposed to homosexuality).
    -   Akane also chastised Ranma twice by attacking her in this manner. The second time (when she thought Ranma wanted to grope the very buxom Miss Hinako) she grabbed and _squeezed_ in a "How do _you_ like it?" manner. The first time (to keep Ranma from picking on P-chan), Akane grabbed girl-Ranma's boob, making her collapse in exasperation.
-   Yuko does it to Mashiro and Nanami in episode 7 of _The Pet Girl of Sakurasou_ while they're bathing together. Then Mashiro does it to them as well.
-   In _Sekirei_, Yukari performs this a few times. At first it seems to be a legitimately friendly joke, but later she starts to show her true, semi-bisexual nature: it doesn't matter if you're a prospective future sister, a dear friend, or a stranger she'd just met under suspicious circumstances. If you've got big boobs, she _will_ tackle and grope you, while laughing and drooling for good measure.
-   In _The Seven Deadly Sins_, while bathing together after a sword training session, Veronica gropes Guila and then teases her for having small boobs.
-   Heavily played with in _Shuukan Shounen Hachi_, when Inohara invites Hachi and Handa to a public bath-house (soon followed by the boys of the class). It turns out Ran is very Genre Savvy and deliberately talks aloud so that the boys can hear their frolicking. Also, in an inversion of the trope, it's the busty Inohara who gropes the petite Handa instead of the other way round. The author further nails the contrast between the boys and the girls by having two panels side by side of one character asking another to pass the soap. One one side, Inohara playfully goes for more groping, while on the other Hachi meekly passes the soap with a gloomy expression, with the girls' voices in the background.
-   Although she doesn't do it in the main anime series, Lina Inverse from _Slayers_ is inordinately fond of grabbing her well-endowed comrade Amelia's breasts in the _Hourglass of Falces_ manga.
-   In an inversion, _Steel Angel Kurumi_ has a scene where the very pneumatic Kurumi disparages her own bust size and enthusiastically admires the much smaller breasts of her "sister" Karinka, to the latter's disgust.
-   In _Strawberry 100%_, a drunk Kurokawa do this once to Satsuki and almost to Aya, two schoolgirls.
-   Francesca Lucchini of _Strike Witches_ is awfully fond of these. Her teammates put up with it, but Surprisingly Realistic Outcome occurs in one of the side manga when she and Shirley are transferred to the African unit and she discovers that groping a superior officer leads to being punished.
-   In the Extra Edition of _Sword Art Online_, when the girls are trying to teach Suguha how to swim, Rika grabs her by the boobs and asks what she ate to make them that big. Meanwhile, Keiko takes a look at her own small chest, and finally Asuna drags Rika away so she will stop molesting Suguha.
-   In _Taboo-Tattoo_ the 2nd episode has this with Izzy groping Touko in a classroom.
-   An interesting variant occurs in Episode 8 of _Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki_, when Tenchi is charged with looking after a baby. He is taking a break in the hot springs, when Mihoshi enters an adjoining bath to take a bath with the baby. Poor Tenchi has to endure Mihoshi's protests to the baby that "there's no use doing that" and "leave them alone!"
-   In _To Love Ru_ Haruna's friend Risa tends to feel her and Lala (and any other girl present) up on occasion.
    -   When Rito's mother meets Lala for the first time, her first reaction is to start feeling her up, though justified because she's a fashion designer and was still in "work mode".
-   _Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs_: Olivia and Angelica engage in some of this when they visit Leon's estate for the first time and bathe in his hot springs.
-   Makio of _Umisho_ is positively obsessed with this trope (believing that enough massage will end her days of being a Pettanko). She's particularly fond of rubbing Shizuoka's breasts. Amuro does this as well, seemingly oblivious as to the implications (which may explain why she lets her younger siblings do it to her).
-   In Episode 1 of the anime adaptation of _YuruYuri_, Akari complains of being bored. Kyoko looks around for something "exciting", and then grabs Yui's breasts from behind.

    Comic Books 

-   While helping Lori into costume in _Lori Lovecraft: Repression_, Thalia Dubois reaches around from behind and 'adjusts' her breasts in a very familiar manner.

    Fan Works 

-   In A.A. Pessimal's _Discworld/The Big Bang Theory_ crossover _The Many Worlds Interpretation_, a visitor from the Discworld has to fend off Amy Farrah-Fowler's fascination with her breasts. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   In _Friendship Is Magical Girls_, Pinkie does this to Applejack and Rarity during the Hot Springs Episode in order to compare breast sizes. Neither of them appreciates it.
-   With an odd reversal of the poles of boldness and shyness in _The Devil's Truth Series_. Willow is applying some ritual paints to Cordelia for a spell, and Cordelia is nude for the purpose. Cordelia thinks nothing of it until she notices that Willow's hand is trembling as she applies the paints to Cordelia's breasts, and she realizes that Willow, being bisexual, is probably attracted to her (after all, who wouldn't be?). She quietly acknowledges Willow's attraction and lets her know it's all right, after which Willow is able to continue much more calmly.
-   In _Touhou Project_ fanworks:
    -   Parsee tends to have problems with breast envy, which she expresses through manhandling.
        -   Similar dynamics with the flatter character wanting the buxom one to "share" include Sakuya and Meiling, Komachi and the underworld judge Eiki, and the NEET Kaguya and her long-suffering servant Reisen.
    -   Additionally, the memetic "Pettan Pettan" video has Tewi and Suika (and later Youmu and Suika) bonding and laughing over their flat chests during the refrain.
-   _Voyages of the Wild Sea Horse_:
    -   After Nabiki Tendo undergoes Breast Expansion as a result of eating a Devil Fruit, Shampoo confirms this by repeatedly poking, rubbing and squeezing them, which causes Ukyo and Kodachi to get in on the action too. Nabiki is uncomfortable, but notes it feels weirdly familiar.
    -   Upon learning about Ranma's Sex Shifter status by seeing him in female form, the _first_ thing that Lilith does is start groping Ranma's breasts, even complimenting him on how nice they are.

    Films 

-   It happens once in _The Sweetest Thing_. Christina Applegate's character catches another woman staring at her boobs in the restroom. She offers the woman a grope to show off her implants, and soon the whole room is joining in. Hilarity ensues when two men walk by while the door is swinging shut.
-   Leslie Mann gives Megan Fox's boobs a good tire-kicking in _This Is 40_ when she asks if they're real or not, and is invited to touch them.

    Literature 

-   Himeko and Misaki, in _Girls Kingdom_ tend to get very touchy-feely in the bathtub as part of their growing bond. At one point, Himeko puts her hands all over Misaki's body, with her excuse being that she's making sure Misaki hasn't gained any weight. Misaki, being quite ticklish, fights, and fails, to get away.

    Video Games 

-   In _Final Fantasy X-2,_ the girls take a break in one of many optional cutscenes.
-   _Tales Series_:
    -   In _Tales of Phantasia_, the hot bath scene in Japoni. Arche compliments Mint on her breasts. In the PSX version, it even gives Mint a new title—"Boing-chan."
    -   _Tales of Symphonia_ has a similar scene which, among other things, gives Lloyd the (undeserved) title "Peeping Tom." The discussions the female characters have, on the other hand, lead to Colette getting the title "Ironing Board," and Sheena getting "Wow!"
    -   _Tales of Symphonia's_ sequel revisits this with Marta taking the honorable (or not) "Ironing Board," Lloyd taking home the "Peeping Tom" title for the 2nd time (again, undeserved), and Emil joining the "Peeping Tom" club, (Marta tricked everyone but him into thinking the bath was closed so she could be alone (and naked) with Emil.) As you'd expect, everyone finds out and blames Emil (even though Marta tries to explain that it was her fault).
    -   _Tales of Hearts_ sees Shing charging into the wrong side of the bath to save the girls of his party, getting the title "Dangerous Pervert".
-   _Persona_:
    -   During the Hot Springs Episode of _Persona 4_, one of the girls in the party is subjected to this by the others. Amusingly, the girl being felt up is _Naoto_, who had up until recently been masquerading as a boy.
    -   _Persona 5 Strikers_: When the Phantom Thieves decide to hit the local bathhouse after a hard day of investigating, the boys wind up overhearing Futaba inspecting the assets of Ann and Haru, much to Ryuji's entertainment.
-   In _Chrono Trigger_, during the Rainbow Shell Side Quest, but only if Ayla is in your party. When Marle grabs a piece of the giant shell for evidence and finds a special letter from her ancestors. After reading the letter aloud, Ayla gropes Marle's breasts, and tells her that she's not ready to "leave the nest" and have her own family..
    -   The DS retranslation has Ayla outright say Marle's "not big enough" for that yet.
    -   Made more entertaining by the fact that Ayla is her great (to the Nth degree) grandmother.
-   In _Rune Factory_ for the Wii, if you take a bath while any of the women are on the other side you'll hear their conversations. A mother and her teenage daughter discuss the softness of their skin, two sisters discuss cup size. Even Selphy does this even though she's on her own, complaining about the size of her breasts and pondering if massaging them will make them shrink. In any of these cases, the main character ends up fainting by staying in the bath too long (fortunately this doesn't affect the actual clock in the game).
-   Happens in several of the optional bath scenes throughout the _Suikoden_ series.
-   In _The Last Story_, Zael can overhear Syrenne getting a bit too friendly with Lisa behind closed doors. Subverted: Syrenne's fondling the stacks of cash Lisa had hidden in her clothes.
-   During Chapter 2 of _Unchained Blades_, the party is all girls. If you find the hot spring hidden in the dungeon, this ensues. All vocal, though, as the only image of the spring shows a more acceptable shot of them bathing.
-   This trope is how Katsuragi of _Senran Kagura_ says "hello" to almost anyone.
-   _THE iDOLM@STER: Cinderella Girls_ has Atsumi, who basically embodies this trope to the point where most official art shows her hands in a groping position.
-   In _Hell Girls_, Lightning Maiden feels up Fire Maiden while they're bathing at a hot spring.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _CLANNAD_, as noted from the top of this page, Kyou gets a little handsy around Kotomi. Kotomi does not really appreciate this. For her part, Kotomi treats it as... well, sexual harassment basically, and denies having a tail.
-   _Little Busters!_: In later playthroughs when Rin reluctantly agrees to bathe with Komari during the sleepover, Riki hears Rin being shocked at where Komari is touching and the latter assuring her that it's okay since they're friends and both girls. In the Mask the Saito OVA, it happens three times: first from Kurugaya to Kud as she tries to tell her that small breasts are cute too (as this is Kurugaya, even Kud isn't innocent enough to not understand that this action isn't quite platonic), from Mio to Haruka after Kurugaya says she can grow her breasts by having them massaged by someone she likes, and then from Rin to Komari in an attempt to copy the former.

    Web Original 

-   The Nostalgia Chick's review of _Matilda_ ends with Nella seeing (adult) Mara Wilson, gushing that she has "an amazing rack!" and reaching forward to grab it, only for the Chick to yell "No!" and try to stop her. In the commentary Lindsay and Mara note that somehow Nella doing this comes off as funny as opposed to creepy or perverted.
-   When Bennett the Sage reviewed _Strange Love_ on _Anime Abandon_, after a scene where the lead character did this to her love interest, Sage asked the audience to tell him in the comments the level of bullshit the trope itself actually is.
