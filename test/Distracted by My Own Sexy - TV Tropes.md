_"Ohh, this is how it all ends. Pond flirting with herself. True love at last."_

Describe Distracted by My Own Sexy her— Oh. Well, hel-lo. Aren't I something?

Ah... Where was I?

Oh, right. Distracted by My Own Sexy is a subtrope of Distracted by the Sexy in which a character is distracted from their objective by their own good looks. This often suggests that the character is exceedingly vain, though there can be other reasons, usually by looking at themselves in the mirror or another reflective surface.

In literature, this is sometimes used as an As You Know to introduce how the character looks to the reader. They often stop to consider themselves and how attractive (or unattractive) they are. Expect any given Lemon to start this way.

While this can often occur in mundane situations, as with the mirror or reflective surface described above, this reaction may be caused by more fantastic reasons (for one thing, said mirror might be cursed to have this effect). A person having undergone some type of transformation may stop to admire their new looks, while Time Travel or cloning might give characters a chance to eye themselves up in person. It's quite common in Gender Bender stories even if the character ends up being completely heterosexual.

A sub-trope to Primp of Contempt. Compare Distracted by the Sexy, where a character's sex appeal distracts others; contrast Rage Against the Reflection, where characters hate to see their own image, and So Beautiful, It's a Curse. See also Man, I Feel Like a Woman, where a man is distracted by his own newly gender-swapped sex appeal; and Showing Off the New Body, when a perpetrator of Grand Theft Me appreciates their new acquisition. Compare Screw Yourself, which is when someone genuinely wants to, or has, somehow entered a sexual relationship with themselves, be it by cloning, time travel, etc.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Asuka from _Asuka Hybrid_ falls victim to this a lot whenever he's doing things in front of the mirror with his gender-bent body.
-   _Bleach_: Although it doesn't happen in the manga, it happens a fair bit in the Anime with Yumichika, leading to one episode where he finds himself having to fight his own clone. After taking a moment to admire himself he firmly requests Ikkaku swap opponents with him precisely because he knows this will be a problem. Ikkaku refuses and, sure enough, Yumichika is defeated having never lifted his sword because he 'can't fight such a beautiful me' whereas his Evil Twin thinks blood is beautiful.
-   Pino gets this in _EDENS ZERO_ when she chooses a humanoid form for a Digital Avatar on Digitalis in contrast to her stubby little android body, noticing her reflection in a window and giving a pleased, innocent smile as an early indicator of her desire to become human.
-   Episode 1 of _Tenchi Muyo!_ has Ryoko get briefly distracted by her own reflection, telling the mirror "You are one beautiful demon," before getting back to the chase.

    Arts 

-   _Venus Kallipygos_ (literally "Venus of the Beautiful Buttocks") is a famous Roman marble statue that depicts an attractive woman (usually assumed to be the goddess Venus) lifting up her dress to expose her bare backside and looking down at herself over her shoulder—apparently admiring her own butt. Notably, the statue's head was missing when it was recovered around the 16th century, and a later artist came up with the distinctive pose when he reconstructed the head. This idea is generally cited as a major reason for the statue's iconic status, as it gave it a distinct erotic aura. Many later copies are a bit less salacious, often opting to cover the statue's buttocks with a dress, but the pose has remained ever since.

    Comic Books 

-   In _Druuna: Clone_, Druuna emerges from a pool when she notices her reflection in a nearby mirror. She stops to admire herself before making out with her own reflection (metaphorically, note—her reflection doesn't jump out or anything).
-   In _Kick-Ass_, Katie thinks Dave is gay, and asks him if he ever gets turned on by looking at his own body in the mirror.

    Fan Works 

-   In _All Your Base are Belong to Her_, Dawn readily admits to being quite vain, and at one point happily lists her favorite things about her appearance: cute face, tiny waist, pale, perfect skin, long sexy hair, and gorgeous blue-green eyes. While stealing armloads of clothes and jewelry from a high-end boutique which is well-equipped with mirrors, she has trouble keeping her eyes off her reflection—though to be fair this was partly because of her fascination with her newly-acquired Glowing Eyes.
-   In the _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ story "My Unsmurfy Valentine", Vanity is so distracted by his own reflection in the hand mirror he carries while walking through the village, that he runs into the other Smurfs _three times_.
-   _Harry Potter and the Boiling Isles_: In Chapter 17, Eda checks her body out after the Body Swap spell. Since she's in Harry's body at the time, it freaks everyone else out.
-   _The Miraculous World of Caline Bustier_: Caline Bustier, Marinette's teacher, ends up borrowing the Ladybug Miraculous when Marinette is sick. She's too distracted to notice at the time, but the next day she sees the pictures online, which show her in a skin-tight costume plus a sexy jacket.
    
    **Caline:** Wow. That... Is a very flattering costume. This is good. This is a good morning.
    
-   In the _RWBY_ fic _CRME_, Cinder does this at one point. She's so narcissistic that she can't help but admire her own naked body in the reflection of a mirror.
-   In the third Chapter of the _Kill la Kill_ fanfic _Maim de Maim_ where Satsuki was greeted by the reflection of her wearing her Kamui which, as we know by now, shows a lot of skin. But unlike Ryuko, Satsuki was basically enthralled by the very sight.
-   A _Touhou Project_ 4koma, in which Suika uses her power to gather mass to give herself large breasts, ends with the memetic line, "Sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of my tits!" (image is SFW, site isn't)
-   When Ryoga Hibiki swaps his Involuntary Shapeshifting curse from "Pig" to "Girl", the first sight of his new exposed cleavage causes him to give a goofy grin, suffer an enormous nosebleed, and then pass out from sheer arousal.

-   In one of Isaac Asimov's _Black Widowers_ stories, the guest is a man whose specialty is job interviews. He keeps a variety of objects on his desk and judges people's character by how they interact with those objects.

-   In _The French Lieutenant's Woman_, Ernestina Freeman has a rather longish session by the mirror when she admires herself as one of the prettiest girls she knows.

-   One of the minor characters in Frank Yerby's Pirate novel _The Golden Hawk_ wore a thick, unkempt beard. When the protagonist, as part of disguising the whole crew, shaved him by force, he was shocked to discover, "I'm right pretty!" (the narration acknowledged that he _was_, indeed, quite a handsome fellow under all that facial hair) and thereafter he was often seen checking himself out in a mirror.
-   Pretty werewolf crossdresser Markus from the _Lonely Werewolf Girl_ series has gotten stuck in front of a mirror admiring himself a couple of times. Especially if there is a blouse or a frock for him to try on at the same time.
-   Eve falls to an innocent version of this in _Paradise Lost_: the first thing she sees after being made is her reflection and is captivated by its beauty, then she sees Adam and decides he is not as good looking as her and tries to go back to looking at her reflection. They end up together.
-   In early scenes of _Restoree_ Sara, our heroine is more interested in her lovely new body than she is in the fact she's on another planet in a decidedly sinister 'clinic'. She gets over it.
-   Subversion: _The Space Trilogy_ includes a scene where the Un-Man, in Weston's body, tries to teach vanity to the Green Lady by dressing her up in a feather-cloak and holding his shaving-mirror to let her see how beautiful she is, but she eventually grows bored with this and abandons the cloak.

    Live-Action TV 

-   John Lithgow's character on _3rd Rock from the Sun_, whose catchphrase was "My God! I'm GORGEOUS!"
-   Dark Action Girl Faith from _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ is wicked-hot and very much knows it. In the episode 'This Year's Girl', after she takes Joyce hostage, she poses and preens in front of a mirror, admiring herself. Discovering some sexy lipstick among Joyce's things, she applies it, studies the result in the mirror, and is so pleased that she leans in and gives her reflection a kiss.
-   In _Castle_, during an investigation, our hero sees himself reflected in a storefront window and remarks "I really am ruggedly handsome." Of course, he is played by Nathan Fillion.
-   The demon who possesses Phoebe in one episode of _Charmed_ falls prey to this. Of course, she specifically chose Phoebe because of her attractiveness, being considered ugly in her true body. She stops to check out her reflection at every chance and changes clothes no fewer than twice, just for the fun of showing off her new body. Piper takes a suspicious amount of time catching on to this behavior. Then again, to be fair, Phoebe is very much a Proud Beauty and Piper likely just thought that Phoebe was just being vainer than usual.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The Doctor is prone to this generally right after a regeneration. "Yes, we're in great danger, but I want to see what I look like now!"
        -   Although their reaction when they _do_ see their new face for the first time is generally _negative_, so it's more of an inversion/a case of "distracted by my own _dissatisfying_ reflection". Exceptions are Ten, who generally gushes and fanboys about everything, and Six, who seems to be the only one who finds his face — or multicoloured wardrobe — all that attractive...
    -   In the Comic Relief special _The Curse of Fatal Death_, the version of the Doctor played by Richard E. Grant is so distracted by his own reflection that he licks the mirror.
    -   Lady Cassandra, the self-proclaimed Last Human, does this _twice_ (okay, almost-sort-of three times) in one episode — once after having hijacked Rose Tyler's body, once after stealing the Doctor's and once, in a weird example involving time travel, to her original body after having borrowed the dying body of her clone-bred body servant.
    -   It turns out that the Doctor is not the only one who has to stop and check themselves out after regenerating — as demonstrated by Melody Pond's regeneration into River Song in the Führer's headquarters. Promptly subverted when it turns out that she was secretly applying poison lipstick.
        
        _"I'm going to wear LOTS of jodhpurs!"_
        
    -   In "The Vampires of Venice", the Doctor can't resist pausing in front of a mirror to make faces and say "Hello, handsome!" It's convenient because it means that when five creepy girls who don't like sunlight pop up, he can also notice that they don't have reflections...
    -   It may not be a mirror, but Amy gets distracted by checking out her future/past self in the Comic Relief short "Time".
    -   Clara similarly finds the sight of a slightly time-displaced version of herself from the back rather enjoyable, which leads to a hilarious exchange when the Doctor, perhaps inspired by a less flattering experience involving the back of his own head, tries to apply some unneeded reassurance among the lines of "It's okay, it's not that bad..."
-   _How I Met Your Mother_:
    -   This sort of thing apparently happens to Marshall whenever he drinks a daiquiri.
    -   In a variation, Lily thinks her stripper doppelgänger is incredibly hot.
    -   Robin reveals she gets turned on by watching herself on TV. She's a news anchor.
-   _Part of Me_: After Mónica starts Sharing a Body with the younger and much more attractive Adriana, one night when getting ready for bed, she catches a view of herself in lingerie in the mirror and can't help but get distracted admiring her (Adriana's) body. This leads to her becoming much more confident, and being tempted to reignite her relationship with Gerardo.
-   _Power Rangers_:
    -   _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_: The Monster of the Week Octophantom had this weakness. To defeat him, they used a mirrored shield, causing him to stop his attack to admire himself. Earlier, a similarly-named monster named Octoplant was distracted by her reflection in a skyscraper, allowing the Rangers to kill her with the Power Sword.
    -   _Power Rangers Time Force_: The Blue Ranger Lucas is quite obsessed with his looks. In one episode he stops looking for the Monster of the Week to check himself out in the mirror. What makes this especially hilarious is that Lucas was doing this while fully decked out in his Ranger suit which covers his face.
-   Happens on _MythQuest_ often. Alex or Cleo are usually distracted by their own reflections because they've just taken the place of a character within a myth. Evidently, mythical heroes are much sexier than kids in their late teens.
-   _Radio Enfer_: While going to the washroom because of a Potty Emergency, Carl is distracted by seeing his reflection in the mirror.
-   The Cat in _Red Dwarf_ would often get distracted when he looked at himself in the mirror, commenting on how sexy and good looking he was. In one episode he claimed to be physically incapable of pulling himself away, and Lister had to drag him.
    
    **Cat**: Thanks, buddy. That was a bad one.
    
    -   In one of the books, we get to know a little more about Cat society, and it turns out one of the Cats' television stations is a _twenty-four-hour mirror channel._ However, that's from the part of the story that turns out to be part of a Lotus-Eater Machine.
-   In an episode of _Sabrina the Teenage Witch_, Sabrina's aunts have a mirror that supposedly makes anyone look attractive. It's hinted that it's not the reflection that changes so much as the viewer's perception. So, anyone looking in the mirror (even the fat, balding principal) gets distracted by their own sexy.
-   _Scrubs_ played it for laughs in an episode where narcissist Dr. Cox constantly falls in love (or at least pretends to) with his own mirror image.
-   In the first _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ Mirror Universe episode, "Crossover", Intendent Kira is definitely distracted by Major Kira. In her episode commentary, Nana Visitor says that she played this attraction as more narcissism than lesbianism; however, later episodes portrayed the Intendant as someone prone to being distracted by _anybody_ of either sex.

    Music 

-   _Bruno Mars_' "Uptown Funk" includes the line "Gotta kiss myself, I'm so pretty".
-   _Hello! Project_ member Matsuura Aya was accused on several occasions of — and has freely admitted to — being distracted by her own reflection in mirrors while someone was trying talk to her or by monitors when she's on camera.

    Mythology and Religion 

-   Japanese Mythology: One story has the sun goddess Amaterasu hide herself in a cave after her older brother Susanoo threw a horse at her, causing the world to fall into total darkness. To restore the light, the other gods throw a party outside the cave, and when Amaterasu peeks out to see what the commotion is about, they hold a mirror in front of her, and Amaterasu is so stunned by her reflection that the gods are able to drag her out of her hiding.
-   Narcissus from Ovid, making this Older Than Feudalism. He's put under a spell that made him fall in love with his own reflection in a pool of water and stared at it until he wasted away into nothing. Other versions say he was just that damn conceited, or that the curse was a punishment for his pre-existing vanity (this would be where we get the word "narcissist" and its kin - they refer to this guy). Yet other versions speed up his death by having him try to kiss himself, only to fall in and drown. He didn't die as such - Echo, the nymph who had sought him, saved him by turning him into a flower. And now you know why that one kind is called a Narcissus. Echo was cursed to only be able to parrot what others had already said. This is (in one version) how Narcissus fell in love with his reflection - upon seeing it, he said "I love you", prompting her to gladly do the same... but he thought it was his image saying it.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Crossed with It's All About Me and The Fighting Narcissist and Played for Laughs with "Exotic" Adrian Street's "I'm In Love with Me":
    
    "I find it very difficult to get me off my mind  
    But that's the price perfection has to pay."
    
-   During his "Dashing" phase, Cody Rhodes would stop and preen himself in the hi-def video display on his way down to the ring. For a bit, he even had an assistant around to have a mirror ready in case he needed some touch-ups, or just because. Then Rey Rey shattered his nose, and he took it slightly worse than Doctor Doom.
-   Lex Luger had a short-lived shtick as The Narcissist where his ring entrance involved a lot of flexing in a full-length mirror in the ring and preventing it from being removed a couple of times for the beginning of the match.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: Dragon magazine #50 had an artifact called Barlithian's Mystical Mirror. Among its other abilities, it can attract intelligent monsters to admire themselves in it. Its writeup also includes a story about a previous owner: one day, he woke up and found several monsters vainly admiring themselves in the Mirror and fainted. When he came to, not only was he amazed to still be alive and in one piece, but his unwanted guests had actually left behind some money and a magic item as payment.
    
    _That day \[he\] sold the mirror and moved._
    
-   In _Dungeons & Dragons_ 5E, medusas combine this with So Beautiful, It's a Curse. See, the 5th Edition version of medusas has their origin in incredibly vain mortals who made a Deal with the Devil for eternal youth and beauty. They got it, but when the price came due they were turned into monsters (but retained their looks). If they ever see their own reflections, they're helplessly enthralled by their own appearance and will continue to stare at it until they turn themselves to stone.
-   Toreador-clan vampires in _Vampire: The Masquerade_. Their clan weakness is that they're easily entranced by anything beautiful, including themselves.
-   In _Warhammer_, there is Sigvald the Magnificent, a champion of Slaanesh. He wears a magic armor of solid gold, and his retinue has mirrored shields so he can watch his reflection during the battle. In game terms, he is subject to Stupidity, a rule usually applied to big stupid monsters— as sometimes he will get distracted in the least appropriate moment. Anyone who might try to use this distraction for attack will quickly discover that Sigvald, vain as he might be, is still a haughty Pretty Boy with a cool sword... which is bad news in most universes.

    Theatre 

-   In _Gypsy_, when Louise first sees herself in the mirror in her elegant dress for her first strip act, she's stopped cold for a moment, then whispers, "Mama... I'm pretty!" It's not so much narcissism as absolute shock, though.
-   When Maria sings "I Feel Pretty" in _West Side Story_, flirting with her reflection, it's connected with her romance with Tony, so it averts narcissism through devotion to the love object.

    Video Games 

-   _Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel!_ has a variant with Handsome Jack and his body double, the Doppelganger. The attraction is decidedly one-sided; the Doppelganger is creeped out by his employer's interest.
    
    **Jack:** Hey, my body double finally arrived! Wow. You sound... really attractive. Distractingly So.
    
    **Jack:** I'd suggest my body double, but he's way too hot to die.

-   _Fate/Grand Order_: Oda Nobunaga - a woman in this universe - tends to be _very_ turned on by her Alternate Selves. When Archer Nobunaga first meets Maou Nobunaga, she comments how incredibly hot she is, and she's incredibly pleased when she transforms into that form herself bragging about her sexiness. Maou Nobunaga also calls her Archer form "lovely" and then asks if there's anything wrong with self-admiration.
-   During the maid cafe scene in _Hatoful Boyfriend_, Ryouta gets a mirror so the birds can check their costumes. Oko San fails to recognize his own reflection, and starts trying to court it.
-   In the ninth chapter of _Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory_, Neptune looks at her HDD Purple Heart self and describes her as a cool, stylish, and beautiful. She also approves that she's hot despite the fact that Ultradimension Rei made a copy of her.
-   In _Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds_, Shuma-Gorath actually seems pleased with his Mirror Match partner's physical appearance.
-   Wear the Raikov mask in front of the actual Raikov and wait a little.
-   At one point in _Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer_, Gannayev stops for a moment to compliment Kaelyn's eyes... Only to point out the reason he likes them so much is that they're highly reflective.
    
    **Gann:** Your eyes are like mirrors, which make them doubly pleasing to me. It allows me to admire my reflection without the aid of a looking glass.
    
-   In _Town of Salem_, the Escort roleblocks people via Distracted by the Sexy. If she's messed with by a Coven Leader/Witch or a Transporter, she can roleblock herself, which grants the _I Look Good_ achievement.
-   In _World of Warcraft_ there are two trash mobs, Vanity and Zeal, found on the path between the second and third bosses of the Siege of Orgrimmar instance that can cause players to become stunned this way. They're spawn of the Sha of Pride, which is lurking about.

She stood enthralled until Insulted Awake… and only the second attempt at that.
    -   Genderbent Sarah also has one of these moments here. Notable for actually being a rare inversion of Man, I Feel Like a Woman.
        
        _"NO! BAD Sarah! Stop thinking of yourself as a sex object!!"_
        
    -   Elliot, trying to get in touch with his feminine side so he can learn to use spells that aren't Gender Benders, tries ogling himself in the mirror as various girls, then gets a tip from Ellen: his superheroine spell has a goth alter-ego.
        
        "The world is cold, but this form is _hot_."

    -   Very squicky, considering that Agatha is Lucrezia's freakin' DAUGHTER.

-   _Misfile_: Ash comments early on that "if it weren't _me_ in the mirror, I'd be pretty turned on about now." when trying on bras. Later she worries that the fact that she's no longer distracted by her own sex appeal is a sign that she's losing masculinity.

(This despite the fact that Doof's in-universe ugliness has been a plot point on several occasions.)
-   Blitz from _Road Rovers_ has been shown kissing himself a number of times on the show.
-   _Star Trek: Lower Decks_: In "Moist Vessel", while in Captain Freeman's ready room, Commander Ransom at one point gets distracted by his own muscular arm and stares at it while flexing his bicep.
-   In the _Tales From The Cryptkeeper_ episode "The Sleeping Beauty", the stereotypical handsome hero Chuck keeps pausing to look in the mirror for "handsome checks"... to the point that he frequently has to be reminded about his mission of waking the beautiful princess by his dorky sidekick/brother Melvin.
-   _Wacky Races_: Dick Dastardly impersonates a western outlaw, Desperate Dick in "The Dopey Dakota Derby." He tries to scare the other racers off by challenging them to draw (pistols, but Dick doesn't specify this). Penelope takes up the challenge and draws a picture of him, which he admires greatly at length allowing the other racers to pass on through. Muttley brings it to his attention:
    
    **Dastardly!Desperate Dick:** Drat! Betrayed by my own good looks!
    
-   _Winx Club_: In her introductory scene in a very early episode in the first season, Darcy demonstrates her ability to be in multiple places at once, and takes a moment after "splitting up" to admire and comment on how good-looking she is.

    Real Life 

-   This can happen to a person after they've lost a significant amount of weight. It's a case of "Wait, that's _me_ in the mirror?" Can also happen to transgender people after transitioning and being on HRT for a significant length of time and/or after receiving surgery to reshape their facial features and chest. And anyone can experience that reaction after receiving a professional makeover.
