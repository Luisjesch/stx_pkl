**Ayano:** Is he having some sort of allergic reaction?  
**Kazuma:** I don't know but I'd be worried if my body did that, seems like you would go through a lot of pants that way.

What happens at the intersection of You Wouldn't Like Me When I'm Angry!, Shapeshifting (often of the involuntary kind) and Unstoppable Rage. Generally, the trope goes like this:

1.  Character X is angered or in pain or some specific trigger is invoked.
2.  X reaches their breaking point and transforms into something at least twice their normal size. Skin color usually changes as well.
3.  Stuff gets broken until there's nothing else to break or X gets talked down from their rage.
4.  Cue change back to X's normal state — unless Magic Pants are involved. This might result in Monster Modesty.

If the subject is female, there's a good chance that they'll become an Amazonian Beauty and/or a Statuesque Stunner.

For some reason, werewolves in modern fiction are often subject to this type of transformation, rather than (just) the full moon. Can involve a Superpowered Evil Side or a Jekyll & Hyde scenario. Berserk Buttons are often involved as well. May result in a Heroic RRoD or One-Winged Angel. Compare The Berserker for cases where the transformation is purely psychological. If this requires _seeing_ yourself as the hulk, that's Self-Perception Shapeshifting.

See also HULK MASH!-Up, One-Winged Angel, Limit Break, Super Mode, Turns Red, Growing Muscles Sequence and Living Mood Ring. Compare and contrast Working Out Their Emotions, where rage (or another similarly negative emotion) drives someone to get stronger the old fashion way. See also Traumatic Superpower Awakening.

    Anime & Manga 

-   A rare female example of hulking out occurs in _Angel Cop_, where the psychic Lucifer enlarges her muscles, going from silky-smooth to rippling in an instant.
-   Never get Stella from _Arakawa Under the Bridge_ in her bad mood, especially talking ill about Sister, you will regret it.
-   In _Attack on Titan_, the Shifters unleash their Titan form by using bodily harm as a catalyst for their intense emotion/willpower. Each transformation involves lightning falling from the sky and bomb shockwave.
-   This happens to Yammy Llargo in _Bleach_, only he Hulks Out when he was already the size of a football stadium.
-   In _Desert Punk_, desert gang leader Makoto has what's described as a case of "Hulk Syndrome". Say his mother has a fat belly button (or just call her a "dirty whore" in the English dub), and he grows huge muscles, goes berserk, and destroys anyone who crosses him. And that's after taking a long string of taunts without batting an eye.
-   _Digimon_:
    -   Mon example from _Digimon Tamers_: when Beelzemon kills Leomon, Takato becomes so furious it causes Guilmon to evolve into the highly unstable and uncontrollable Megidramon.
    -   Earlier in _Digimon Adventure_, Tai became obsessed with getting Agumon to digivolve to the ultimate level. The end result was SkullGreymon.
-   _Dino Girl Gauko_ is about a girl named Naoko who transforms into a fire breathing dinosaur when she gets angry. Normally her dinosaur form is still the size of a child, but she grows larger the angrier she gets and can grow bigger than a building.
-   _Dragon Ball_:
    -   Goku was subject to transforming into a giant ape-like creature with laser breath when gazing at a full moon. In _Dragon Ball Z_, Goku's son, Gohan had the same "issues", and utting off their Saiyan tails reversed the transformation. Vegeta, having had the proper training, was in full control of his Oozaru form.
    -   Going Super Saiyan is even closer to the trope; most Saiyans' first transformations come when they get really, really angry, and they really do get stronger the angrier they get. And when they combine anger with purpose... you're boned.
    -   Broly is probably the best example of this in the series. His transformation into the Legendary Super Saiyan literally has his _skin exploding_.
    -   Gohan as a Super Saiyan 2 in the Cell Saga is this as his rage makes him one of the most sadistic characters in the anime besides Broly and Kid Buu. Even Cell refers to him as a monster. Gohan is also very muscular for an 11-year-old.
        -   Gohan takes it a step further in _Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero_ when his rage triggers yet another transformation, this time into his "Beast" form, his strongest form to date.
    -   _Dragon Ball Super_ has Kale, a Shrinking Violet Saiyan who goes from a normal-looking young girl to the female version of Broly.
-   _Fairy Tail_: such<small>◊</small> is the effect of the Power Perfume in Ichiya's arsenal. Magic Pants are included, of course.
-   Kenshiro from _Fist of the North Star_ is a minor version — pretty much every fight scene starts with him rip his jacket to shreds by tripling the size of his muscles (they're back by the next scene). Several mooks use their special abilities to increase in size, not that it helps any.
-   In _Green Worldz_, the female human hybrid does this by having wood branches surround her body when she starts getting a little serious.
-   Played for laughs in _How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?_ with Machio, who routinely shreds his clothes when he flexes, going from a reasonably fit young man to a hulking mountain of muscle in an instant. It's gotten him into trouble when he does it in public.
-   In Chapter 305 of _Hunter × Hunter_, Kid Hero Gon Hulks Out when Pitou admits that Kite is already dead and beyond any help. He turns into a muscular long-haired adult whose raw power rivals that of the _Chimera Ant King_. Overlaps with Dangerous Forbidden Technique since Gon accomplished this by forcefully aging himself; reducing his lifespan and (maybe) sacrificing the ability to use nen ever again.
-   _Kirby: Right Back at Ya!_: This happens to King Dedede in episode 93, "Frog Wild", when he claims the Demon Frog for himself, turning him into a large, muscular beast after it possesses him.
-   This is basically how the Unicorn of _Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn_ enters its Gundam mode: by reacting to an extreme state of emotion in its pilot and entering "Destroy Mode." This results in its joints opening up, revealing a glowing red psycoframe, increasing its power massively, and splitting its "horn" into the characteristic Gundam V-fin. Learning how to control it (instead of just blasting every enemy to smithereens) is a big problem for Banagher. (Riddhe, by contrast, _embraces_ the idea of going uncontrollably berserk when he hops into its Banshee counterpart.)
-   _My Hero Academia_: Re-Destro's Quirk, "Stress", is effectively this. His Quirk bottles up all of the rage and stress he feels into his body which he then uses to bulk himself up to gigantic proportions in order to release his stress on whoever has incurred his wrath.
-   Naruto's Superpowered Evil Side tends to come out when he's angry.
-   Negi's Magia Erebea form in _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_
-   Tony Tony Chopper from _One Piece_ turns into a giant muscular, shaggy furred, monstrous version of himself dubbed "Monster Point" when he eats three Rumble Balls under less than six hours. In this form, he goes berserk with rage and attacks anyone nearby, so he only uses this as a last resort, and after the transformation is reversed he is left with a lot of strain on his body. By the time of the Fishman Island Arc, he has learned to control himself while in this state (and is the only form he needs a Rumble Ball to turn into), but he can only hold this transformation for three minutes.
-   In _Riki-Oh_ and its anime adaptation, The Warden uses his mastery of Naike Kenpou (The same martial art that gives Riki his abilities) to disguise his true form: A hulking oni-like beast. He hulks out when he releases that control.
-   _Rosario + Vampire_: Though the exact transformation varies, monstrels' bodies change in battle. and a few of them become huge. Importance to the team tends to have something to do with it; weaker monstrels experience Shapeshifter Weapon, whereas the big boss instead goes One-Winged Angel.
-   Zigzagged with Jin'ei Udo from _Rurouni Kenshin_: his ace in the sleeve allows him to go from a scrawny gaunt man to a behemoth ripping with bulging muscles (averting Clothing Damage since he's wearing a full-body suit and just unrobes the upper half of his kimono in advance), but averts the rage part: not only he transforms by hypnotizing himself, but he also becomes calmer and less unhinged when the transformation is active.
-   Parodied with a Running Gag in _Tokyo Ghoul:Re_. This is a fictional version of Urie, drawn by Saiko to mock his strict workout regimen. She even draws a comic where the normal Urie transforms into Hulk Urie to rescue the team. He is... less than amused by her creative presents.
    -   Later, during his fight with Donato, Urie Frames Out. Saiko outright states that this is because he worked out too much while trying to calm him down.
-   In _Ushio and Tora_, Nagare Akiba, during his Duel to the Death with Tora is revealed to have mastered a secret dharmic technique (in addition to the many Holy Hand Grenade attacks) which makes his muscles grow considerably to the point of ripping his shirt and leather jacket to shreds. In this form, he's furious and strong enough to injure Youkai barehanded. He trades the "color-changing skin" thing for a creepy Nightmare Face reeking bloodlust and rage.

    Comic Books 

-   In recent years, Batman villain The Scarecrow has reacted to great rage or pain by involuntarily transforming into the hulking monster Scarebeast<small>◊</small> on some occasions. He does not seem to retain any memory of these interludes.
-   Occurs in _The Boys_ with M.M.'s younger brother. His powers manifested suddenly one day, with one small catch; he was mentally disabled and wore a helmet which he couldn't break out of, crushing his skull and killing him.
-   Walter/Wallop from _ClanDestine_, though he doesn't so much lose intelligence as control. The longer he stays transformed, the bigger, stronger and more out of control he gets.
-   Parodied in _Great Lies To Tell Small Kids_, which claims Banner only half-hulks when he's irritated (such as by being asked to do the dishes).
-   Marvel Comics:
    -   _The Incredible Hulk_: Naturally, the Trope Namer and Codifier is the Hulk, as any time Bruce Banner's anger runs too high, he turns into the Hulk. The writers of the live-action TV series officially called it "Hulking Out."
        -   In 2023, the Hulk was given an even more powerful form called "The Titan". Basically the answer to the question "What would happen if The Hulk hulked out?"
    -   She-Hulk (AKA Jennifer Walters), at first. In fact, she has it worse than her cousin, Bruce. While Bruce can, on occasion, notice his emotions are running too high and get them under control before transforming, Jennifer, by contrast, cannot calm down or stop the transformation. Once her emotions run too high, it is like a ticking time-bomb. All she can do is try to get to an isolated spot to transform. Fortunately for her, she later gains control of her transformations entirely.
    -   _World War Hulks_ and _Hulked Out Heroes_ has several big-name heroes Hulking Out after being exposed to an enemy superweapon to make them go on a rampage. Deadpool, several members of the X-Men, all of the Fantastic Four except Reed Richards, Thor (who seems to be weaker in this form), Spider-Man, and even Doctor Strange are all Hulk-ified. Naturally, they all fall victim to The Worf Effect — and Hulk.
-   Subverted and lampshaded in _Invincible_ when Mark tries to hulk-out over Atom Eve's death and will beat Conquest. Conquest rushes Mark and tells him "child, please. Being enraged at me does not make you stronger. That is not how this works." Then again, Mark _does_ nearly kill Conquest afterward, so...
-   In a story about the Justice League of America told by J'onn J'onnz, the Martian Manhunter himself went through a Hulking Out moment when the Blue Beetle and Booster Gold played a prank on him due to his addiction to Chocos cookies, by hiding a stash of his favorite cookie away from him in a warehouse and having all the nearby stores that sell Chocos be completely empty of their stock.
-   _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_: Dr. Jekyll's body produces the serum that turns him into the much larger Mr. Hyde whenever he's stressed. He spends nearly the entire Martian invasion arc in Hyde form.
-   Loose Cannon, a HULK MASH!-Up in The DCU. The DCU also has Rampage, who is a _female_ Captain Ersatz of the Hulk, complete with being a scientist in her regular identity.
-   Roberta Mendez, first introduced as Captain America 2099 in Marvel's _Secret Wars (2015)_ event and later becoming a canon part of _Spider-Man 2099_, goes from a perfectly normal executive assistant to being built like a female weightlifter when the super-soldier serum in her system gets activated.
-   _Sláine_, being based on Celtic Mythology, borrows Cúchulainn's Warp-Spasm for the titual hero.
-   _Sonic the Comic_ has Sonic transform into Super Sonic when angered or stressed. While Super Sonic was the same size as Sonic, he fits the rest of the description. However, unlike most examples of this trope, Super Sonic could not be controlled and was dangerous for virtually everyone — even Sonic's friends weren't safe.
-   In _Wild CATS Wild Storm_, the team's Genius Bruiser has the power to grow in size and strength at the cost of intelligence. If seriously provoked he sometimes forgets himself and grows past the point where he can tell friend from foe.
-   Barbara 'the Cheetah' Minerva, Arch-Enemy of _Wonder Woman_, is, as her supervillain name suggests, a were-cheetah. While her transformation is usually a little more subdued and controllable than this trope implies, some works featuring her do basically treat her as a furry yellow She-Hulk.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Doonesbury_: When Cloud Cuckoolander Granola Girl Boopsie channels Hunk-Ra, this tends to be what results.

    Fan Works 

-   Conversed in _Calvin & Hobbes: The Series_ when Dr. Brainstorm and Jack witness Socrates' head transmitter going off.
-   _Child of the Storm_:
    -   Bruce Banner plays his usual role as the Hulk, though he's got it under fairly good control these days. Thor also slips into the Warrior's Madness, the equivalent of this in the Asgardian royal family, where even the Hulk can only barely restrain him when he's finally pushed too far in the sequel. Diana, meanwhile, has similar problems and snaps under the strain of being roasted alive in chapter 60.
    -   Another example (minus the physical growth part), is near the end of the first book and in the sequel, is Harry turning into the Phoenix — the first time after being killed, and promptly resurrected and possessed by the Phoenix Force, which goes on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge, the second after figuring out how to use the fragment of the Phoenix within, and finally snapping after a _brutal_ Trauma Conga Line. Since this results in the Dark Phoenix, everyone is very eager for this never to happen ever again.
-   Papa Smurf in the _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ story "Papa's Big Crush" when he inhales the "pheromone cologne" mixed in with his other chemicals, and in this state he goes after Smurfette.
-   _Thousand Shinji_: When Asuka gets mad she transforms into a superpowerful, demonic-looking berserker: her body becomes bigger and incredibly athletic and muscular (while not sacrificing a single drop of feminity), her blue eyes become dark-indigo, her hair's colour becomes brass bronze and her skin's blood-red, and huge ram horns sprout from the sides of her head. When she dons that shape she becomes incredibly strong, fast, agile and nearly invulnerable.
-   In the _Pony POV Series_, Dark World Arc, Angry Pie (the corrupted Pinkie Pie) has the Element of Rage and gets this power from it, making her stronger the angrier she gets. Which is an easy thing to do. She kept the power after her Heel–Face Turn until her death, at which point Rarity absorbs her Element and gains it. According to Loose Canon, a resurrected Gilda is the next Bearer of the Element after Rarity retires, and gains this ability.
-   George does this deliberately in _The Keys Stand Alone: The Soft World_ when he has to get stronger very rapidly while still retaining the ability to speak. He'd started out as a gorilla but couldn't talk, so became himself as buff as he could possibly get. Unfortunately, he didn't count on how much physically larger he would get and is nearly mummified in his clothing before it rips off him. However, he is otherwise normal and changes back to his normal skinny self as soon as possible.
-   _The Beast That I Am_ focuses on Shinobu doing this to get revenge on Keitaro's tormentors.
-   _Unleashing of a Dark Night_: The Werewolves' Rage Form, only acquired through copious amounts of anger. Tomoya the Volt going into Rage Form involves muscle growth to a behemoth double her original size when she gets angry enough. As of Chapter 43, however, she gains a new form double _that_ size in height. The author's note at the end of that chapter reveals that there's an _even larger form double the size of_ _**that**_ _form_ that would come later.
-   HYDRA Agent Volker in _Sixes and Sevens_ has this ability, which Shmitt theorizes was gained from improper experimentation with a heart-shaped herb smuggled from Wakanda.

    Films — Animated 

-   Dexter/Zwelge from the _Tom Poes_ animated adaptation _The Dragon That Wasn't (Or Was He?)_ is an adorable baby dragon who can grow to enormous size when angered.
-   In _Heavy Metal_, Hanover Fiste (with the help of the Loc-Nar) hulks out to disrupt Capt. Sternn's trial and allow him to escape.
-   _The LEGO Movie_:
    -   Unikitty is normally an adorable, bubbly pink kitty. Once she loses control of her anger, she turns red and goes absolutely berserk.
    -   The sequel has Ultrakatty, a huge, red cat that Unikitty can become via getting really mad.
-   In _Turning Red_, a hereditary blessing-turned-inconvenience makes protagonist Mei hulk into a giant red panda whenever she experiences extreme emotions (such as anger or excitement). We find out Mei's mother Ming has it even worse: Her panda is _kaiju-sized._

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Mark Ruffalo's version of The Hulk in _The Avengers (2012)_ shows Banner's control is improved. He Hulks out twice: Once when in great pain, once again during the film's big battle, showing a measure of acceptance and control. In the latter scene, Banner strolls towards a massive Leviathan monster bearing down on the team. When Captain America tells him it is time to get angry and transform, he wryly admits that he's _always_ angry and proceeds to Hulk-out, without breaking stride, before punching out the monster in one blow.
    
    -   Humorously defied in _Avengers: Infinity War_ where despite Bruce pleading the Hulk to come out at the time when he should come, he outright refuses.
    
    **Bruce:** Hulk, I know you like making your entrance at the last second, well, this is it, man. This is the last last second. Hulk! HULK!  
    **Hulk:** NO!  
    **Bruce:** Oh, _screw you_, you big, green asshole! I'll do it myself!
    
-   In _Big Trouble in Little China_, Thunder seems to be doing this when he sees that his elemental brothers; Lightning and Rain; are dead. He starts expanding... then he keeps expanding... and then he blows up.
-   _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_. Dr. Jekyll does this when he turns into Mr. Hyde.
-   _Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky_: The Warden plays this straight, basically turning into an oni (rather than the inverted version of his anime and manga counterparts, who transforms into the smaller normal human).
-   _X-Men: Days of Future Past_: Beast uses a serum that allows him to maintain a balance between his human and mutant appearance. When he's angry or aroused<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  enough, his mutation kicks in, and he returns to human form once he's calmed down.

    Literature 

-   _Egil's Saga_: Watching the burial of his favorite son Bodvar, Egil "swell\[s\] up so much" that his tunic and his leggings tear apart. When he comes home, "no one dare\[s\] to speak to him", suggesting that they are afraid of him 'going berserk'. Egil instead locks himself in his sleeping room and does not come out for three days.
-   In _The Girl from the Miracles District_, when Nikita's adrenaline levels and body temperature are too high, they trigger her change into a berserk: a far taller, far bulkier humanoid with More Teeth than the Osmond Family and overwhelming lust for battle and blood.
-   Werewolves in the _Mercy Thompson_ series can transform involuntarily if they get angry enough. Being turned into a werewolf also has a side effect of giving the person serious anger issues unless they're a rare submissive or Omega. These are two of the primary reasons that newly turned werewolves have a lifespan of fewer than ten years.
-   _Mermaids of Eriana Kwai_: When mermaids are angry, their eyes turn red, their teeth turn razor sharp, their skin turns to the colour of seaweed, and their ears grow pointy and long. The trope doesn't apply to mermen, who spend all their time in that form.
-   In _Twilight:_ New Moon'', Jacob and the other werewolves sometimes change into wolf form because of anger. The pack leader Sam's fiancee has disfiguring scars because Sam "lost control for a split-second."

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._:
    -   Calvin Zabo (Skye's father) has been using a homemade Psycho Serum on himself for decades. Therefore, even when he's not actively using it, he can achieve great feats of strength when angered. His catchphrase is "Let's not lose our heads." His actual serum is even more powerful, resulting in a small but striking physical transformation, and is activated by rage and a shot of adrenaline.
    -   Subverted with Robbie Reyes, a.k.a. Ghost Rider. When he gets angry at widespread looting during a blackout, Daisy warns him to keep calm so he doesn't "go all carrot top again." Robbie laughs, as the Rider has nothing to do with his emotional state. It only comes out when there's evil around, and even then Robbie can usually keep it contained until things get desperate.
-   _The Amazing Extraordinary Friends_: Dr. Dominique Brioche suffers a nuclear genetic accident and transforms into the 50 ft. Atomic Bombshell whenever she gets angry.
-   Yet another werewolf example. In _Big Wolf on Campus_, Tommy would not only transform during a full moon but also during times of extreme emotional stress... or arousal.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   While werewolves usually transform the day before, of, and after the full moon, when Oz learns to control the transformations he is then subject to involuntary shapeshifting when he feels strong emotions (like jealousy over Tara's relationship with Willow).
    -   Also, in the episode "Beauty and the Beasts", Pete's constant use of his formula has made him transform whenever he goes angry.
-   Played for laughs in the _Community_ episode "Contemporary Impressionists". As the gang is working a bar mitzvah as celebrity impressionists, Jeff gets so angry at not winning a "Most Handsome Young Man" contest that the he bursts the seams of his suit and goes on a rampage of destruction. The guest of honor thanks his dad for getting him the Incredible Hulk for his party.
-   Going "full-on zombie mode" in _iZombie_ is usually triggered either by immediate danger or hunger for brains. The zombie's eyes go black, and he or she attacks with inhuman strength and ferocity. Bonus points for one of the zombies calling the state "raging out" (who has learned to enter the mode on demand).
-   One prank in _Just for Laughs: Gags_ had a small boy wearing purple pants have his hat stolen, walk into a nearby portapotty — where he's lifted out through a door in the back by a large man painted green and wearing similar clothes as the boy, then gets in — and then rattles and breaks it open, yells and chases the kids.
-   A prizefighter in the _Lost Girl_ episode "Raging Fae" keeps beating stronger foes because a Fae is secretly dosing him with a Hulk Out-inducing substance.
-   This is how werewolves in _Sanctuary_ work. Henry seems to be the first person to figure out how to control the changes (without drugs).
-   If you torture a Friendly Neighborhood Vampire in _Supernatural_, you can force him to show his fangs and take revenge as Martin finds out in "Citizen Fang" (S08, Ep09).
-   Played for Laughs in _The Young Ones_. After receiving a merciless barrage of abuse from all three of his housemates, Neil does this in the _Summer Holiday_ episode. Turns out it was actually an Indulgent Fantasy Segue, though it's a mystery what happened to his clothes...

    Mythology 

-   Possibly the Ur-Example is Cúchulainn of Celtic Mythology; in battle, he would undergo something called ríastrad or battle frenzy, in which he would transform into something not unlike an Eldritch Abomination in its hideousness and ferocity. This form was only beaten once when he was approached by a group of nude women. He modestly averted his eyes, whereupon the men snuck up on him and dunked him in a barrel of water, which exploded on contact. A second barrel boiled away, and the third became pleasantly warm before Cúchulainn resumed his normal form.
    
    _The first warp-spasm seized Cúchulainn, and made him into a monstrous thing, hideous and shapeless. His shanks and his joints, every knuckle and angle and organ from head to foot, shook like a tree in a flood. His body made a furious twist inside his skin, such that his feet and shins switched to the rear and his heels and calves switched to the front. On his head the temple-sinews stretched to the nape of his neck, each immense and measureless knob as big as the head of a month-old child._
    
-   Kali in Hindu Mythology is the hulked-out form of Durga/Parvati.

    Podcasts 

-   In the _Cool Kids Table_ game _Bloody Mooney_, there's a note in Mooney's crate that warns to never let it see the light of the crescent moon. When it does it becomes a hulking beast, and also gains the ability to shapeshift.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   This was a staple gimmick for Hulk Hogan, crossing it with Meaningful Name. After being beaten down, he'd get his Heroic Second Wind and start No Selling his opponent's attacks, shaking his arms as he got back to his feet before starting in on his Five Moves of Doom Finishing Move.

    Roleplay 

    Tabletop Games 

-   In the Arthaus edition of _Ravenloft_, darklord Alfred Timothy inverts this trope: he's a malicious and willing werewolf, but his darklord curse forces him to revert to his _human_ form if he allows anger, bloodlust, passion, or other strong emotion to overcome him while in his wolfman form.
-   _Werewolf: The Forsaken_:
    -   Death Rage, where a werewolf will automatically transform to his "war form" and go on an unstoppable rampage. It's either triggered through pain or anger (and depending on your Karma Meter, that anger can range from "one of your packmates just got killed" to "someone talked sass to you").
    -   Similarly, vampires have Frenzy, which is triggered by stimuli such as anger, fear or hunger. And unlike in the above example, getting sassed at _is_ a perfectly normal stimulus for Frenzy. There's a reason everyone stays polite at Elysium...
    -   And their predecessors in the _Old World of Darkness_ can also frenzy in many of the same situations. One possible flaw in _Werewolf: the Apocalypse_ can invert it — it designates one of the werewolf's other four forms as the form transformed into. The most severe version of it turns the raging werewolf into their human form — not so bad (comparatively) if you're losing your temper at the bar, but if you're surrounded by fomori and Black Spiral Dancers and need to fight your way out? Good luck.

    Theme Parks 

-   In the queue of _The Incredible Hulk Coaster_ at Universal's Islands of Adventure, government test footage is shown of volunteers successfully being turned into Hulk-like superhumans.

    Video Games 

-   In _Amagon_, the titular player character transforms into the Hulk-like Megagon for Super Mode.
-   Despite rage being a main theme, Asura from _Asura's Wrath_ primarily averts this. He does, however, grow bigger arms that pack at least a thousand times more power in them in his Berserker form, his Mantra form and his Destructor form (Which also has a human-sized form, that basically is Asura mantra form, but with four extra arms and a rainbow aura instead of Asura's plain red Aura).
-   While not shown, Leo Hartwig's in _BioShock 2_ transformation into a Brute Splicer involves this. It is heard in his Audio Diary "Field Trial #1".
-   One of Krieg's endgame abilities in _Borderlands 2_, "Release The Beast", has him mutate into a Badass Psycho when he activates Buzzaxe Rampage at 1/3 of his health. The mutation involves his left arm shriveling into a worthless stump while his torso and right arm grow to ridiculous size, giving him a massive boost in damage resistance as well as melee damage.
-   In _Breath of Fire IV_, Ryu first transforms into his Kaiser form after he witnesses Captain Rosso kill some innocent children and send an invincible monster after him and his friends. Ryu then kills both the monster and Rosso, and it takes a Cooldown Hug from Nina for him to regain his senses. Afterward, he can transform into Kaiser at will, but it cannot be controlled until you finish a certain sidequest.
-   _Darkest Dungeon_: The Abomination, one of the heroes you can hire, has the ability to turn into a hideous monster, which gives him greater damage-dealing ability but stresses out him and the other adventurers in your party.
-   Anders in _Dragon Age II_, whenever he is overtaken by the Spirit of Justice inhabiting him.
    
    **Justice: You will never take another Mage as you took him!**
    
-   In the original _Fatal Fury_, Tung Fu Rue will transform into a larger, more muscular version of himself after taking too much damage (although he will change back after taking more). Future games restricted this to the use of his super moves. More recent games that feature him reveal that he's not actually transforming at all, but that the muscular version of Tung is actually a Battle Aura of sorts.
-   The boss of the Cybercity stage in _Gaia Crusaders_ initially appears as a human punk clad in leather, who fights you with his trusty chain at the start of said stage. Once you defeat him, he flees before coming back at the end, where he suddenly gains muscles and triples in size (ripping his leather jacket to shreds in the process) to attack you. His skin and hair even turns green at that point.
-   _Hakaiou: King of Crusher_ have you turning from a human to an increasingly larger monster after being injected by an alien virus. For your first transformation into a Beast Man, you shed your human form and bursts out of your clothes in a cutscene, with only your Magic Pants remaining.
-   In _Kirby Star Allies_, King Dedede's body grows to muscular proportions in his second phase, including a barrel chest and large burly arms which make him look similar to a gorilla (with his legs still small). The same thing happens to Parallel Dedede in the post-game. And funny enough, it's actually a reference to episode 93 of the anime, "Frog Wild".
-   In _League of Legends_, Gnar's gameplay revolves around this premise. His playstyle is based around his Rage bar (which fills as he deals damage and gets damaged), which will transform him from a cute, prehistoric yordle into a hulking beast known as Mega Gnar (for a small period of time). Mini Gnar is a fragile and nimble ranged champion, while his alter form, Mega Gnar, is bulkier (both in damage and defenses), slower and melee-based. Managing his Rage bar and mastering both forms are required to perform well with him.
-   In addition to the various Hulks, several other characters in _LEGO Marvel Super Heroes_ share the same property, transforming from a minifig into a larger figure with super strength. Most notable are probably Venom and Stan Lee himself when unlocked as a playable figure, possibly in reference to _The Simpsons_ episode mentioned below.
-   _Manafinder_: In the Final Boss fight with King Vikar on Starkas's route, he'll turn into a giant purple muscled humanoid.
-   Bowser only reaches his highest level of power in _Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story_ after being (otherwise fatally) crushed, with a little help from the Mario Bros.
-   _Overwatch_ has Winston, whose Ultimate consists of him temporarily regressing into his primal instincts and becoming an Ax-Crazy muscular brute who trades off his Tesla Cannon for powerful punches, faster Jump Pack cooldown, and doubled HP.
-   Do not piss off Daichi from _Puyo Puyo Gaiden: Puyo Wars_. Not only is he a Puyo-human hybrid who was created to be a bioweapon, he's a Puyo-human hybrid who was created to be a bioweapon whose fury turns him into a purple muscular<small>◊</small> humanoid<small>◊</small> resembling a Titan.
-   In _Senran Kagura_ this happens to Daidōji when she undergoes her shinobi transformation.

-   In _The Sims 3_'s supernatural expansion, werewolves can unexpectedly transform and undergo a feral change if their mood drops too low or if they're suddenly angered. _The Sims 4_ has a similar premise in its own werewolf pack, with werewolves becoming mindless enraged beasts if their fury meter maxes out.
-   In _Transformers: Fall of Cybertron_, Grimlock's alternate mode is somewhere between this and Super Mode. In-game, the transformation isn't involuntary and can't be done at will due to being experimented upon by Shockwave, but it does require Big Grim getting incredibly pissed to gain access to it and he does grow in size upon transforming.
-   In _Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines_, there are several ways of unleashing The Beast, which Smiling Jack describes as a beast wearing you as a suit, in which you go into an uncontrollable frenzy.
-   One _World of Warcraft_ expansion introduces worgen, humans afflicted by a werewolf curse, as a playable race.

    Webcomics 

-   In _1977:The Comic_: When the normally easy-going Bud has had just about enough and transforms either into or out of his alter-ego Budette.
-   Marty Monster from _The Adventures of Dr. McNinja_, "Monster Mart". At the start, he'd been having problems with his transformation to and from his monster form, until he gets stuck halfway. In the end, seeing Dr. McNinja in mortal peril is enough to knock down his psychological barriers and allow him to grow bigger than ever before. He inherited this from his father; the problem with his father (aside from always looking down on him) is the fact that he's a Steven Hawking Expy, and so every time he transforms he falls over and left naked until he shrinks back down.
-   _Archipelago_ has Tuff, a half were-shark who can transform into the animal form, usually triggered by danger to the people he loves. Shark!Tuff being very violently protective, and Tuff in general being a glass-half-empty kind of a guy, he thinks of himself as a monster.
-   _Bear Nuts_: Prozac goes HULK SMASH after a prolonged time off his meds. Cara gets similarly big and smashy when seeing a blood moon. They nearly destroy the zoo when this happens at the same time.

-   Justin of _El Goonish Shive_ does this in this filler strip.
-   Shrinking Violent of _Everyday Heroes_ has her transformation triggered with a blow to the nose. She can be snapped out of it via massive amounts of sugar. Unfortunately she's also a Type 1 Diabetic, which means a couple of days in the hospital after every Hulk Out, at best. Also, she gets _smaller_ when she transforms. Her muscles contract and get denser, so even her strongest teammate can't hold her down.
-   The title character in the Heroes Unite _Fury_ story.
-   _Love Unlimited_: In the finale of the _Ms. Marvel & Red Dagger_ arc, supervillain Curio transforms into a much bigger, angrier form, shredding much of his clothing. His dialogue after that point is mostly brief bursts of shouting - and he acquires enough Super-Strength to knock both heroes off their feet via a Ground Punch.
-   _Mag Isa_ — Kyle turns into this chunk of muscle after injecting himself with green roids.
-   Sweater Puppy and The Incredible Cunt from _The Magnificent Milkmaid_. Both turn into giant, large breasted nymphomaniacs (in SP's case, a nymphomaniac werewolf) upon their triggers (Sweater Puppy from seeing or even thinking about the Moon, Incredible Cunt from being called "a cunt").
-   In _The Order of the Stick_, Thog's barbarian rage is depicted in this way, complete with him turning green(er) and using Hulk Speak. Also his pants turn purple, which he lampshades.
    
    **Thog: Thog smash puny prison!**
    
-   Fug from _Pewfell_ is normally a Gentle Giant... until he gets angry, then he turns into something resembling an Eldritch Abomination with arms.
-   Sarah of _Peter Is the Wolf_. As a new Thrall (a were who's created, rather than born), she tends to transform whenever she gets too excited. Unlike every other were in the comic, she transforms into a wolf form three times her normal size and can only really be calmed down by sexual gratification.
-   In _Sister Claire_, apparently masters of Nun-Fu can do this at will.
-   Demons from _Slightly Damned_ have this as a race ability, in extreme stress, anger, injury or if they know death is certain willingly, they transform into larger more monstrous versions of their normal selves<sup>example&nbsp;</sup>  and get a massive boost to their physical and magical capabilities but lose all self-preservation and will mindlessly slaughter any living thing they see (including friends and family) or mutilate themselves if there is nothing to kill. Their body is also pushed to its absolute limit and they eventually die of exhaustion although it is possible to save them by either rendering them unconscious (easier said than done given how tough they are normally) or by using an angel star pendant with the holy protective spell removed.
-   The Incredible Lioness, a transformation of Rosechu from _Sonichu_.
-   In _Tripp_, Coco does this after aliens put a chip in her head.

Gor expresses reluctance at fighting someone some small and harmless looking, whereupon Spydor angrily asserts that it's "dog-eat-dog" in this business. When Gor protests that he doesn't want to eat a dog, the alien grins a toothy grin... _and then turns himself inside out_, transforming into a hulking monstrosity that vaguely resembles a skinned gorilla with spikes growing out of it.

    -   King Sombra seemingly underwent this during his imprisonment in "The Crystal Empire".
    -   In "Power Ponies", when the cast gets sucked into a comic book, Fluttershy becomes Saddle Rager, who has this as her superpower. She's too bashful and soft-hearted to use it until she sees the Mane-iac swat an innocent bug. Such blatant animal cruelty causes Fluttershy to go berserk and smash up the villain's doomsday device.
    -   Lord Tirek grows bigger and stronger the more he uses his Mana Drain in "Twilight's Kingdom".

    **Stan Lee:**Come on, damnit, change! Mmmmm! Aw, forget it. Mm-mmmm! I really did it once!  
    **Comic Book Guy:** _\[walking Stan Lee in the store\]_ Yes, yes. I just wish you had the power to leave my store.  
    **Stan Lee:** _\[off-screen\]_ Mmmmmh!  
    **Comic Book Guy:** You almost had it there.
    
-   _Sonic Boom_: Subverted in "Don't Make Me Angry". The actual trope appears in a comic book in-universe and Dr. Eggman tries to invoke it. After blasting himself with radioactive waves, when Eggman gets angry he does transform... into a tiny hyperactive purple creature.
-   _South Park_:
    -   Parodied in the episode "It's a Jersey Thing", when Kyle's "Jersey side" comes out. Only the "transformation" is him putting on hair gel and jewelry, ripping off his sleeves and writing a nickname on his shirt.

-   _Star Trek: Lower Decks_: "The Spy Humongous": One of the artifacts that the ensigns are sent to clean up is some kind of cube that exacerbates Tendi's frustration until she's ranting at her friends, before fusing with her and turning her into a rampaging scorpion monster.
