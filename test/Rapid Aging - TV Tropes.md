Short hero, shorter lifespan.

_"Tout, tout, through and about, your callow life in dismay. Rentum, Osculum, Tormentum. A decade twice a day."_

— **The Warlock** placing a hex on his victim, _Warlock (1989)_

A trope used when a character undergoes aging more quickly than normal. It can occur anywhere from a matter of seconds to a matter of weeks.

Sometimes as a result of using evil (or sometimes merely questionable) means to preserve youth, or from an encounter with a dark force that causes immediate aging and deterioration, usually resulting in death soon after. This also isn't unheard of when leaving a Year Outside, Hour Inside setting. Frequently caused by a villain's own mistake or overreaching. Sometimes it happens to the good guys, in which case their comrades must Find the Cure! before it's too late.

If this is used to age a character from infancy or childhood to adulthood, expect that more often than not the work in question will completely ignore the fact that they should have to consume food in order to gain body mass as they grow up or else be stunted; instead, aging will somehow make them grow in size, too, and the extra mass will come out of nowhere in violation of the laws of physics.

If someone was using a Fountain of Youth that was destroyed, expect this to happen as they immediately become whatever age they should be. Not to be confused with Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome, a tragic affliction that affects hundreds of characters in daytime Soap Operas a year, usually so as to avoid the hassle of children in the cast or in the plot. Contrast We Are as Mayflies or Time Abyss. Usually a result of Cast from Lifespan, sometimes a result of Clone Degeneration. See also Plot-Relevant Age-Up. Rapid Hair Growth might ensue.

Note that the effect tends to be hard to justify in a strictly science-fictional setting. Hair, in particular, is essentially dead tissue; the grey or fine white hair that we associate with aging appears as old hairs grow and fall out, and new hairs grow in.

    Anime & Manga 

-   This _appears_ to be what happens to titan shifters in _Attack on Titan_. They seem to be Younger Than They Look (at least in the cases of Uri, Zeke and arguably Reiner) and since they only have a 13-year lifespan, rapid aging could have something to do with that.
-   _Berserk_ features a mundane example of this, with the King of Midland. His actual age is uncertain (a questionably-canon guidebook claims him to be in his early fifties), but for most of the Golden Age arc, he is a fairly handsome man with a full head and beard of black hair and a face that, though lined and clearly on the older side, isn't particularly wrinkled. However, after he finds out that Griffith has slept with his daughter, and the aftermath of it goes horribly sour, it seems as if all the stress of decades of rulership hits him like a truck. Only a year later, he looks less like a man of fifty and more like a man of ninety, with his hair now lank and shock-white, his skin shriveled up, and his strength having completely left him.
-   In _Bleach_ this is the core of Baraggan's power. Even in his unreleased state his touch can age his target enough to make their bones snap like twigs. When he unleashes his full power, anything that fails to get out of the way crumbles to dust in a matter of seconds. And by anything, we mean _anything_: whether it's people, buildings or even Kido, everything ages to non-existence in Baraggan's presence.
-   At the end the _Cowboy Bebop_ episode "Sympathy for the Devil", Spike shoots Wen with a crystal that contains the energy that prevented Wen from aging. This neutralizes the effect, and he quickly becomes his true age. Since said age is hundreds of years old, Wen dies almost immediately after he's been shot.
-   _Darker than Black_:
    -   One female Contractor's power is to assume any human appearance, must as the price of using her power age faster than normal.
    -   Inverted with Amber, who appears to grow younger the more she uses her time-based powers.
-   In _Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba_, that was the addition to Nezuko’s size shifting powers in her arduous fight against Upper-6 Daki, Nezuko desperately made herself stronger to counter the beatdown she was receiving, that resulted in Nezuko’s body actually maturing instead of just turning bigger like in the beginning of the series, however, the first usage of that power made Nezuko revert to a more feral state, visibly taking pleasure in hurting Daki and almost trying to devour humans again; in the Swordsmith Village arc Nezuko seems to have learned how to control it.
-   _Doki Doki! PreCure_: Mari originally found Aguri as a baby. After getting attacked by a Jikochuu, Aguri suddenly ages up to her current age of ten.
-   Ledina, the Vain Sorceress main antagonist from _Doraemon: Nobita's the Legend of the Sun King_ after Nobita and friends botched her immortality ritual, which causes her to age several decades within seconds. Cue Doraemon and the others - and the _entire_ Mayana army - gasping at Ledina's true face.
-   Rem undergoes this in _Dream Hunter Rem_. She promptly gets better when the Victim of the Week revives her.
-   Ultear in _Fairy Tail_ suffers this as a consequence of using a Dangerous Forbidden Technique to turn back time. Made all the more interesting that she spent decades of her life to turn time back for a **single minute**. And, that it actually became _the turning point_ in a critical event.
-   Wrath suffers one of these after he dies in _Fullmetal Alchemist_.
-   Used as a plot twist towards the end of one episode of _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_. Section 9 are on an abandoned oil rig converted to a lawless base for a paramilitary group, pursuing a girl named Eka Tokura—recipient of one of the first cybernetic implants—who had been kidnapped by them years ago (the paramilitary group are Technophobes) and now appears to be their leader. There are several questions surrounding the mission, such as the fact the girl in the picture doesn't seem to have aged in the decade or so since her kidnapping. The Major eventually captures the leader and discovers she's not augmented. The old woman who is with her—apparently her mother—is Eka Tokura. Though not clearly explained, it seems her early implants caused this trope as a side-effect, a result of the lack of knowledge of man-machine interactions at the time.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   _Golden Wind_:
        -   Giorno Giovanna can inflict this onto plants via his Stand infusing them with life energy, as seen when he causes a tree to age and wither away.
        -   The Grateful Dead, Prosciutto's Stand, unleashes a mist that causes those affected to age in mere seconds. In addition, its ability is heat based, meaning it affects men faster than it does women, as men have naturally higher body heats. However, this also means it's useless when used in cold areas, and _ice cubes_ are an effective way of undoing the effects of the ability.
    -   In _Steel Ball Run_, Gyro Zeppeli, through use of the Super Spin, is able to use the Stand, Ball Breaker, which has the ability to rapidly age anything it hits.
-   _My Hero Academia_: One For All causes this to happen to anyone with a Quirk who receives it, with them not living more than 20 years. They realized this as the one wielder who didn't die quickly in battle against All For One, a reclusive hermit named Shinomori Hakage, died of his body essentially reaching an elderly state at the age of 40. Meanwhile, the Quirkless Toshinori Yagi held it for far longer without suffering this side effect. As a result, Izuku Midoriya won't be able to pass One For All on to a 10th successor because it's grown so powerful that it would cause even worse rapid aging in anybody with a Quirk, and even if he can find another person who was born Quirkless like himself and All Might it's also become so powerful that their bodies might be torn apart (Midoriya himself was barely able to withstand the power at first, and One For All is constantly growing in power).
-   This happens in _No. 6_ whenever a bee hatches from the unfortunate victim. They age rapidly and die after looking in horror at their old, wrinkled features.
-   In _One Piece_:
    -   This happens to Hody Jones and his crew after the side effects of using E.S.S. take hold. Vander Decken also attempted to use it in the past on Shirahoshi, who was 8-years-old at the time, to try to age her up to be physically old enough to marry (even if not chronologically so).
    -   Jewelry Bonney ate the Toshi Toshi no Mi, which allows her to accelerate and reverse the ages of herself and anyone within her range at will.
    -   It is revealed that Shinobu's Rot Rot Fruit (which normally makes inanimate matter "mature" until it has rotten away) can work on people, making them grew older. Momonosuke asks her to use this power on him to make him into an adult so that he can help Luffy fight Kaido. After Momonosuke becomes 20 years older, his dragon form ages with him, allowing him to become as big as Kaido.
-   In _Persona 4: The Animation_, Naoto's Shadow has an attack that causes its victims to rapidly age. Yu, Yosuke, and Teddie all fall victim to it before Teddie uses his Persona to restore their vigor and youth.
-   Used in _Princess Mononoke_. Plants rapidly grow and die in the Forest Spirit's footsteps.
-   In _Rave Master_, a Child Mage does this to _himself_ via a Dangerous Forbidden Technique called Lost Ages to increase his magical power to fight against one of the most powerful villains in the series. It works, but he becomes an old man over the course of the battle. When he reappears in the epilogue though he's back to his child form.
-   _The Rising of the Shield Hero_: Demihumans age differently from humans, growing as they become stronger and level up. Raphtalia, who begins the story looking like a ten-year-old girl, becomes a young woman in her early twenties after a few weeks of killing monsters.
-   Happens to an unfortunate boy in an early chapter of _Rosario + Vampire_, after he is bitten by the mermaids and has his life energy sucked out.
-   Played around in _Sailor Moon SuperS_ with Queen Nehenelina. As the backstory reveals, the one thing she feared the most (as revealed by her Magic Mirror) is losing her beauty to age. Her Start of Darkness (and the corruption of her kingdom into what would become the Dead Moon) was her reaction to this. One of the effects of this was the creation of Zirconia: an "externalization" of her nightmares which allowed Nehelenia to maintain her youthful appearance. After Chibi-Moon undoes her magic with the Golden Crystal, Zirconia is forced back into Nehelenia, revealing that Nehenelia's true appearance is exactly like Zirconia's: an old, withered hag.
-   In _The Seven Deadly Sins_, Gray Lord's special ability, Pacifism, makes it so anyone who kills another in her presence rapidly ages until death. As both Ban and Merlin are The Ageless, they are immune.
-   Halcyform, a wizard who made a deal with Seigram for immortality, suffered this in _Slayers_ when Gourry manages to destroy the Pledge Stone that kept Halcyform immortal. Before he could age completely, he blows up himself, his dead lover Rubia, and his mansion to bits.
-   Souji from _Snow White and Seven Dwarfs_, due to a side effect of his powers. Conversely, his older brother, Souichi, is _de_\-aging.
-   _Space☆Dandy_ episode "We're All Fools, So Let's All Dance, Baby". While dancing to the music from an old vinyl record, several characters age rapidly into old age.
-   Happen in _Time Bokan_ series _Zenderman_. After Nyaravolta (the real Big Bad, an immortal cat that in the past has drank the magic elixir gaining a long life) was defeated, the Akudaman trio then took his container away from him and drank the elixir. Shortly afterwards his immortality wore off, and he instantly withered up and died.
-   In _Tokyo Ghoul_, a Half-Human Hybrid born of a Ghoul and a human being a One-eyed Ghoul (essentially a Ghoul with only one kakugan and implied stronger abilities) is actually extremely rare. The more likely outcome is a child who is more or less human that lacks a Ghoul's need to eat human flesh and has greater physical capabilities...and a sharply decreased lifespan due to their genetics. They internally age at a faster rate than normal humans or Ghouls — they apparently have a far lower Hayflick limit. Arima for example suffers conditions associated with the elderly like glaucoma even though he's only about thirty.
-   In the _Trigun_ manga, this is Wolfwood's base state; the experimental treatments that give him a Healing Factor and abnormal strength and reflexes also cause him to age at an accelerated rate, so that when we take him for thirtyish he's actually in his late teens...and given when the treatments were administered, this means he's aged over fifteen years in the last five. Slower than most of these, but _quite_ irreversible.
-   In _Yaiba_, the Barrier Maiden Sayaka Mine survives being given a Kiss of Death by Princess Kaguya, but in exchange she gets drained of her Life Energy and is hit with this, along with many other women. She only recovers when Yaiba slays Kaguya in battle.

    Asian Animation 

-   _Happy Heroes_: The Adelians are a species of Energy Beings that age rapidly if they use excessive amounts of energy in one go, becoming noticeably wrinkled like a senior citizen.
-   _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_: The cast ages rapidly in the first episode of _Joys of Seasons_, where the Earth begins spinning uncontrollably fast when the aliens' spaceship gets caught in its orbit.

    Comic Books 

-   The vast majority of clones in comic books are rapid-aged, usually to match the cloning subject as part of a villain's plot (such as attempting to fool the heroes with a duplicate). It's tied into Clone Angst and Clones Are People, Too since clones are often grown in test tubes, rapidly aged, and imprinted with personalities and memories. Exceptions (such as X-23) do exist, however these are indeed less common than the rapid-aged variety.
-   _Amulet_: After being kept alive for fifty years thanks to his Amulet's Spirit, Max ends up letting himself rapidly age to death after a combination of turning on the Spirit, and being called out by the memory of his deceased best friend.
-   In the EC Comics story "Death Must Come!" (_The Crypt of Terror_ #17), this happens in the end to a man who has been using special transplants to prolong his youth for fifty years.
-   _The Flash_:
    -   Griffen Grey, a Glory Hound superhero and rival of the Flash, found that his powers were causing him to age rapidly. He deliberately created a disaster so he could go out in one last burst of glory. Instead he died after learning his rival hero was his friend Bart Allen, and apologising to him.
    -   In contrast to how the Flash has the ability to steal a person's speed, Eobard Thawne, the Reverse-Flash, has the ability to steal a person's time. Stealing their time equates to him gaining a longer lifespan, while his target loses years of their life and becomes physically older and frailer in seconds.
-   Xerek is a victim of this in _The Incredibles (2009)_.
-   _Impulse_: When Bart was born, his Speed Force connection did this to him. He was physically a teenager when he was chronologically two years old. His grandmother Iris later took him to the present day in order for Wally to "speed-steal" the source of his rapid aging.
-   _Lands of Arran_: Alyana reaches adulthood in the span of a few days after her birth.
-   In the _Legion of Super-Heroes_ storyline _The Great Darkness Saga_, the wizards of the Sorcerers' World summon a mysterious baby to help the Legion fight the Master of Darkness. In a matter of hours the newborn baby becomes a toddler, then a young child, and he doesn't stop growing fast until he has turned into a fully adult, white-haired Highfather.
-   _Lori Lovecraft_: This is what happened to Raoul Reichmann's victims when he drains Life Energy from them in _Into the Past_. If he drains enough, they age to death.
-   _Lucky Luke_: In "The bride of Lucky Luke", Luke is hired to escort a convoy of women to their long-distance husbands. This is explained to him by the organizer, while a decrepit, cackling old man in a rocking chair listens in.
    
    **Luke:** What's so funny, old-timer?  
    **Old man:** (angry) "Don't call me old-timer, I'm only thirty!" (dejected) "But this one time, I escorted a women's convoy..."
    
    -   And he kind of has a point, as Luke has to deal with Women Drivers, mice, an escaped convict masquerading as a woman, tornadoes, and Irish cooking.
-   In _Major Bummer_, entering the time stream without protective equipment can cause this, as the protagonist finds out.
-   _Sandcastle_: Everyone on the beach ages a few years every half hour, condensing an entire lifetime into just 24 hours.
-   In _Sasmira_, Bertille starts aging faster as a result of traveling into the past.
-   _Shazam!_: The 1945 _Marvel Family_ #1 (the first team-up of all the Marvels) features the origin story of Black Adam. He originally gained his powers from the wizard Shazam 5,000 years ago. After he gained his superpowers, he decided to conquer the world, and Shazam sent him into outer space 5,000 light years away. Black Adam spent the next 5,000 years traveling back to Earth at the speed of light, arriving in modern times. The Marvels trick him into saying the word "Shazam", which changes him back into his non-powered form. Unfortunately for him, his accumulated age catches up to him and he ages rapidly, turning into a skeleton.
-   In _Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)_:
    -   Dimitri suffers this when stripped of his Enerjak powers, bringing him back to his true 300+ year age. He had to rely on cybernetics to keep him going, eventually being reduced to a cyborg head in a jar.
    -   In _Sonic Super Special_ #8, Sonic falls victim to this. Snively zaps him with a ray that allows him to run even faster, but at the same time, ages him every time he uses his "Super-super speed". Also qualifies as a variant of Puff of Logic, as he doesn't start rapidly aging until Rotor informs the team of the ray's effects.
-   _Spider-Man_: In _Sins Past_, it's stated that the Goblin serum the Stacy twins inherited from their father caused them to rapidly age to adulthood despite only being a few years old.
-   In _Spirou & Fantasio_, the Count of Champignac has created a serum that makes people or animals injected with it age 70 years in an hour. Two thugs are tricked into taking it and end up as old men. The count tries to age them back, but decides to stop after turning them back into children.
-   _Superman_:
    -   One of Terra-Man's western themed alien gadgets was a chewing tobacco which could age Superman.
    -   _Supergirl (1984)_: Evil sorceress Selena casts a spell to change her former mentor Nigel from a middle-aged man to a decrepit geezer in a matter of seconds.
    -   _New Krypton_: Chris Kent, who was conceived and born within the Phantom Zone, begins aging rapidly outside of it, and requires scientific intervention to avoid dying as a an old man within a few hours.
    -   _The Life Story of Superman_: After getting a sample of Superman's skin, Luthor grows one clone to adulthood within one hour.
        
        **Lex Luthor:** I've also perfected a hyper-accelerated growth-process for my clone! It took a mere handful of minutes for the clone to mature one year...so in the single hour the tour lasted... my clone grew to adulthood — and your exact age now!
        
    -   In one story arc, Superman needs to go into the future, but cannot disrupt the time stream. He uses a "defective" time machine which causes him to age to the physical age he would have been if he'd taken The Slow Path.
-   _Thorgal_: It happens several times — once through No Ontological Inertia, once through Reality Warping by the villain and once when a Timey-Wimey Ball (which allowed the villains to drink the same potion of youth over and over) gets broken. Most of the time the effects are utterly horrifying.
-   _The Warlord (DC)_: Jennifer Morger cuts off the Vain Sorceress Motalla's access to magical energy. With no more power to keep her going, Motalla instantly ages into an old crone.
-   The _West Coast Avengers_ once fought a villain called Halflife, one of three superhumans recruited by Graviton as partners, along with Quantum and Zzzax. who could create an odd variation of it; if she touched a victim, the victim would age halfway to the point where he'd die of old age. Doing it several times in succession could age a victim such that he'd die within minutes. Fortunately, this effect had No Ontological Inertia, and a victim would regain his true age if Halflife was knocked out.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   Vol 1: In the possible future in which Diana and Etta find a way to derive the "L-3 Vitamin" from the spring water of the Amazon's Fountain of Youth which allows everyone who drinks it to regain and retain their physical youth, thus eliminating death from old age, Etta also develops an anti-L-3 formula which causes the effects of L-3 to rapidly reverse until the imbiber is their actual age.
    -   Vol 2: When Trevor Barnes sacrifices himself to defeat the shattered god, he ages to geriatric over the course of a sentence and then crumbles into dust.
-   _Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!_: Extant used his powers to age most of the Justice Society members to their proper physical ages, some even to their deaths.

    Comic Strips 

-   _The Far Side_: "Suddenly, on a national talk show in front of millions of viewers, Dick Clark ages 200 years in 30 seconds."

    Fairy Tales 

-   The witch in "Prince Ivan, the Witch Baby, and the Little Sister of the Sun" grows up very fast and becomes an adult woman only six weeks after being born.
    
    "Little Prince," says he, "today you have a sister, and a bad one at that. She has come because of your father's prayers and your mother's wishes. A witch she is, and she will grow like a seed of corn. In six weeks she'll be a grown witch, and with her iron teeth she will eat up your father, and eat up your mother, and eat up you too, if she gets the chance."
    

    Fan Works 

-   _Codex Equus_: Deities are a positive example. Because deities in the Codexverse get Stronger with Age, there are instances where a deity physically ages _far past_ their designated age/rank as a result of certain factors. Said factors can range from absorbing huge amounts of magic (as what happened to Melody/Queen Aoide Mousikós and Rarity/Princess Arcus), to having their divine natures completely altered (as what happened to Moon Ray Vaughoof/Prince Canticum Lunae Cahaya; only by reaching an epiphany and coming to terms with himself was his condition stabilized), becoming divine Reincarnations (as what happened to Tranquil Harbor with Promes, Princess Magicum Ponyland with Plasmatio Equus, and Princess Twilight/Amicitia Sparkle Equestria, King Blue Suede Heartstrings/Caerulus Melodia Equestria-Corporatum, and Prince Bossa Nova Heartstrings/Rubeus Stella Equestria with Mana Equus) or becoming the divine avatar of a concept that _the entire galaxy_ needs/believes in (as what happened to Diamond Tiara/Queen Elpis).
-   _Dungeon Keeper Ami_: In _An Awkward Talk_, when it's discussed how a "necromantic withering spell" works:
    
    The spell speeds up the organism's metabolism and supercharges its cells, causing them to divide at a vastly accelerated rate, but the influx of nutrients from the environment remains the same." Upon seeing the confused looks her explanation had earned her, she shifted mental gears and put it into words that Usagi would have understood, too. "The spell makes the plant age rapidly, but it doesn't get enough food to fuel its growth, so it dies."
    
-   In the _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ story "Smurfette's Inner Beauty", Smurfette undergoes rapid aging as Hogatha had cast the Spell Of Syphonia on her to transfer Smurfette's youth and beauty unto herself so she can go on a date with the real Harlequin. Near the end of the story, Empath's True Love's Kiss breaks the spell, restoring Smurfette and Hogatha to their normal appearances.
-   A cutaway in _Family Guy Fanon_'s version of "Fast Times at Buddy Cianci Jr. High" reveals that when Peter and Randall Fargus did a Science Expo one year, the two brought a Time Clock (a machine Fargus made to control age) to it. Needless to say, it resulted in a crowd of old people walking out complaining and Peter and Fargus, who are now grotesquely old, walk out holding canes and trembling. With the obvious implications of how it went.
    
    **Old Fargus:** _\[hoarsely\]_ Oh, nelly. I didn't think it would go south that fast.
    
-   In the _Pony POV Series_:
    -   In the Dark World Arc, it's revealed Apple Bloom was inflicted with the Sunny Town Curse by Discord and, while able to do a lot of good with immortality (including redeeming Sunny Town and allowing them to all pass on), eventually asked Applejack to break the curse as she couldn't bear the negative effects of it any longer. Applejack does so and she rapidly ages to dust as her true age catches up with her.
    -   This would happen to any of the Chaos Six in the same arc if they lost their Element of Chaos, as difficult as that _is_ to happen. Twilight begins rapidly aging when Angry Pie takes her Element until Trixie's spirit gives her her own Element as a replacement, and the reformed Pinkie Pie begins aging rapidly, though much slower, after her Element is damaged and eventually dies from it, but not before using her remaining time to help as much as possible.
-   _Vow of Nudity_: In a particularly bizarre case of Utility Magic, Fiora the Forest Witch bypasses a brew's fermentation period by using a water elemental for the solvent and casting _bestow curse_ on it to instantly age it up by two weeks.
-   Justified in _you can only use your own_. Since Chara never fully recovered from the buttercup poisoning, the years hit them _really_ hard.

    Films — Animation 

-   Played for Laughs (albeit dark laughs) in the movie _Epic (2013)_:
    
    **Grub:** What's it like, having such a short life cycle?  
    **Fruit Fly:** _(little kid voice)_ It's great, mister! When I grow up, _(man voice)_ I'm going to _(old man voice)_ wish I had done more with my life, sonny. _(dies)_
    
-   Near the end of Disney's _Hercules_, Hercules jumps into the River Styx to get Meg's soul back, and being a river that only dead people are supposed to be in, it rapidly ages Hercules as he swims through it in a manner that could easily be Nightmare Fuel. However, this selfless act is what causes Hercules to get his godhood back, so he is unable to be killed when the Fates try to cut his thread of life, and he emerges from the River with his body restored to its prime, along with the divine light that gods have.
-   Sophie in _Howl's Moving Castle_, as a result of an encounter with the Witch of the Waste.

-   _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_ has an infamously creepy scene of the evil queen humanshifting herself into a hag as a disguise.
-   In _Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam_, Tawny shows up after Billy and Clark defeat Black Adam and tells him that as punishment for his crimes, he's going to be transported so far from Earth that it will take 10,000 years for him to fly back. Faced with this fate, Black Adam chooses to say "Shazam" and turn back to his powerless form, which instantly ages into a decrepit corpse.
-   This happens in _Tangled_ when Flynn cuts Rapunzel's hair, thus losing its magic power. Since the source for keeping Mother Gothel young is gone, she ages to the point where she becomes a pile of dust in less than a minute. Her fall serves as Gory Discretion Shot.
-   In _Yellow Submarine_, it happens to The Beatles and Admiral Fred in the Sea of Time - more than strictly necessary to overcome that Fountain of Youth effect.
-   Old Age from _Legends of Valhalla: Thor_ gets her namesake because fighting her causes Thor to rapidly age.

    -   After getting some drops of her essence drained before the draining machine gets stopped thanks to the animals jumping at the Skeksis Scientist, Kira appears slightly older than before, being weakened and looking paler. She gets her essence back, but not all the effects are reversed. Her later resurrection by the urSkeks heals her back to normal.
-   At the end of _Doctor Strange (1978)_, the evil entity that Morgan le Fay works her punishes her for her failure to turn Doctor Strange to their side by aging her into an old hag on the spot. However, she’s seen shortly afterwards on Earth, young again and no worse for wear.
-   The Syfy (still Sci-Fi at that time) film _Do Or Die_ featured a world where a percentage of the population had RAD or Rapid Aging Disease. It could be controlled and slowed with the drug Anzinol, and the 'clean' area infiltrators used Anzinol pumps. If a pump was destroyed, though, aging happened in seconds.
-   In _Excalibur_, Morgana uses the magic she stole from Merlin to keep her looking young and beautiful.

-   In _The Hunger_, this is the fate of any human who is turned into a vampire by the immortal Miriam. Upon being turned, their bodies and beauty are unravaged by time so long as they feed once a week and get enough sleep, but once about 300 years have passed, the decay sets in no matter what they do to stave it off — and worse, they can't die. For her current lover John, it takes just two hours for him to age fifty years, and it just goes on from there...
-   Happens to everyone on board in _The Ice Pirates_, as the ship passes through an area of warped time.
-   In _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade_, the knight who guards the Holy Grail warns that "As the true grail will bring you life, a false grail will take it from you." Donovan dramatically illustrates this and dies when he drinks from the wrong Grail.
    -   By dramatically, what is meant is that he starts out looking like Emperor Palpatine, then starts to resemble a badly emaciated Doc Brown, then he goes the full Skeletor look, and at this point Indy puts him out of his misery by throwing him back against a wall and he disintegrates on impact. Even as the flesh on his bones was visibly rotting away and he lost his eyes, he was still aware of what was happening to him and screaming and groaning for someone, anyone, to help him. "Chose poorly", no shit.
-   _The Invitation (2022)_: After Evie stabs him, Deville's aged several decades physically as a result within moments.

-   In the Cannon Films adaption of _Snow White 1987_, the Evil Queen's Magic Mirror starts breaking after she hurls a jar at it in a rage when seeing Snow White's still alive. With every crack in the glass, the Queen's dress falls apart and she gets progressively older. By the time she reaches Snow White and the prince, she's reduced to a toothless hag and laughed out of the wedding. As she leaves, the mirror finally explodes into pieces with the Queen's body shattering and reduced to dust.
-   In _Snow White & the Huntsman_, Queen Ravenna has remained youthful long beyond her natural time, but when her magic power starts slipping, her age starts to catch up to her. She regains youth and magic by draining years from a young woman's life, causing extreme rapid aging to the victim.
-   In _Space Jam: A New Legacy_, Chronos, a member of the Goon Squad who can manipulate time, gets subjected to this when Granny activates his time powers.

-   The clone troopers from _Star Wars: Attack of the Clones_ are engineered to age twice as fast as normal humans. This way, they can be mass-produced as cannon fodder.
-   _Sweet, Sweet Lonely Girl_: Adele quickly ages into decrepitude at the end when Beth takes her youth, while her younger sister Dori starts taking care of her (just as Adele's done with her aunt prior).
-   In _The Thirsty Dead_, anyone who had partaken of the Elixir of Life will start rapidly aging if they move more than a certain distance away from Raoul's head (known as the 'Circle of Age'). Once started, the process is irreversible.
-   _The Time Machine (2002)_ has an alternate means of accomplishing this. When using the titular machine, the occupant(s) are surrounded by a bubble of light which defines the limit if what travels with the machine, but nothing prevents anything from falling outside of it, in which case they become vulnerable to the time stream's influence. This is demonstrated early when Hartigan drops his locket of his fiancee and catches it outside the bubble, which causes it as well as his exposed hand to begin aging separate from the rest of his body. He later weaponizes it against the Uber-Morlock, essentially forcing his enemy to die by aging forward in real time with no way to escape.
-   One of the unfortunate effects of too much time travels in the third _Les Visiteurs_ film, _Bastille Day_. 12th century knight Godefroy (Jean Reno) and his squire Jacquouille (Christian Clavier) age when they're stuck during The French Revolution and tumors grow in Jacquouille's throat and Godefroy's nose. For a more practical behind-the-scenes explanation, _Bastille Day_ came out 18 years after the second film, _The Corridors of Time_, and the actors have aged visibly, hence why this trope is used.
-   The Hong Kong film _Wait Til Youre Older_ starring Andy Lau, featuring a child protagonist who desperately wishes to grow up, and getting his hands on a prototype experimental potion that causes him to grow up overnight into Andy Lau. (Said potion also spilled on a small shrub, which turns into a gigantic tree whose roots spills into the middle of the streets the next morning, much to the surprise of the public).
-   The curse placed on Kassandra by the title villain of _Warlock (1989)_ causes her to age twenty years each night. Since she was about twenty years old already, this gives her and the warlock-hunting hero only three or four days to find and defeat the Warlock before she dies of old age.

    Gamebooks 

-   In the first _Sorcery!_ book _The Shamutanti Hills_, you come across an old man stuck in a tree, who gave you a page from a spell book in return for helping him, saying he got the page from a sorceress.

-   The final battle of _Vault of the Vampire_ against Katarina Heydrich ends with Katarina aging several centuries in _seconds_ upon defeat, where she goes from a drop-dead gorgeous vampire sorceress to a dried-up and plain dead old crone.

    Literature 

-   A man uses the power of a demon to do this to Wesley in the first story of the _Angel_ short story collection "The Longest Night". He was dying of an incurable illness and got desperate to see his son grow up. So, he'd been stealing victims' years for himself at first, so he could stay young, and then when Wes comes to investigate, his years are transferred into the man's son, who rapidly ages, allowing the father to see him briefly as an adult, and then de-ages, returning Wesley to his young state, once Angel arrives and breaks the spell.
-   _Animorphs_: Due to Hork-Bajir biology, Toby Hamee is a few inches short of fully grown in the space of two years, and fully adult just a few years after that. And thanks to her seer genes, she is capable of speaking clearly just a few months after being _born_.

-   In one of the _Captain Future_ books, a gang was selling water from a radioactive spring which made people young. Too long without the water, and the person died from rapid aging. There was actually an attempt to give a scientific explanation; the body no longer has the resources and regeneration of a young person, but continues expending them like one.
-   _The Chronicles of Dorsa_: The woman who's the host of Ty'Tsana the second time almost instantly ages to an ancient crone when she's exorcised. It also happens to other shadow-infected people like her when exorcised too.
-   _Dorothy Must Die_: This happens to Mombi in the Queen of Oz while trying to disguise Ozma.
-   _The Dresden Files_: In _Changes_, The entire Red Court is wiped out by a ritual. Those who were only half Red Court were cured... but time also caught up to them. Most of them aged and died immediately, but some hadn't been infected for long, and survived.
-   It happens to Eppon in _Galaxy of Fear_. He goes from baby to young adult to slavering monster in hours.
-   In _Gelsomino In The Land Of Liars_, Benvenuto ages rapidly every time he sits or lies down. He often sits down to help other people in need and, in the biggest Tear Jerker moment of the book, ends up dying at the age of ten while physically being in his late seventies.
-   _Goosebumps_: After Steve puts on an old man mask in _The Haunted Mask_ sequel, he slowly starts turning into an old man, has a hard time getting around and has cravings for oatmeal.
-   In _Homecoming (Drizzt)_, Yvonnel Baenre II was infused with the memories of the original Matron Mother Yvonnel Baenre. As a result, she was born a self-aware and powerful priestess and mage. Yvonnel II grew weary of her infanthood quickly and used an older version of the Haste spell with the side-effect of aging the caster one year with each use to become a beautiful young woman.
-   Under the unforgiving high background magical field of Fourecks, this happens to young Wizard Ponder Stibbons in _The Last Continent_. He goes from (presumed) middle twenties to over ninety in seconds –- and gets a taster of what it will be like to be one of the old men of the Faculty. He does not like it very much.
-   _The Last Day of Creation_ by Wolfgang Jeschke. On arriving back in the past, the time travellers discover things have Gone Horribly Wrong and their expedition has been scattered across decades.

-   _The Lord of the Rings_:
    -   Bilbo didn't age at all between finding the One Ring at the age of 51 and giving it up at the age of 111. Even after that, Bilbo doesn't begin to age again until the Ring is destroyed; after he's passed it on to Frodo, he remains as he was when he parted with it, and may have stayed that way indefinitely so long as the Ring continued to exist (even Gandalf seems not to know for sure, since Bilbo's situation is unique); after its destruction he becomes, in Galadriel's words, "ancient now, according to his kind".
    -   It is believed that this would happen to all Ring-Bearers after the One Ring is destroyed, but it is never really proven, as apart from the Nazgûl all the Ring-Bearers still living when the One Ring is destroyed are either immortal or haven't held their Ring long enough for it to make a noticeable difference to their apparent age (With Hobbits becoming legal adults at 33, jumping to 52 would not be a significant age gap. The Nazgûl jumping from various ages to 3,000 would explain why they all disappeared with their master).
    -   For Gollum, the implication is far worse. Being a Fish out of Temporal Water by _600 years_, he instinctively knows what will happen to him if the Ring passes. His last plea to Sam is actually for one more drop of life. He will become dust when the ring is gone.
-   It is implied in _Lost Horizon_ that this happens to Lo-Tsen.
-   _Mistborn: The Original Trilogy_: At the end of the first book, this happens to the Lord Ruler after his Immortality Inducers are removed, causing him to age a thousand years in a matter of seconds. The heroine puts him out of his misery. This is due to the method of immortality used and the Anatomy of the Soul in this universe. He survived by compounding his youth infinitely, keeping himself eternally young. But souls have an Identity, and part of that is age. His soul knew how old he was supposed to be, so he had to stretch less and less youth farther and farther. There are ways to manipulate Identity in this magic system, which result in a far more efficient and sustainable form of immortality, but unfortunately he didn't seem to be aware of them.
-   In _No. 6_ this is the fate of the hosts of mutated parasitic wasps.
-   In _Old Man Khottabych_, the heroes release the titular genie's jerkass brother, who states he will kill them, and tells them to choose the manner of their death. One of the boys tries to worm out by saying he wishes to die of old age... guess what spell the genie casts.
-   Double-subverted in _The Picture of Dorian Gray_. At first, Dorian's portrait does all the aging for him, letting him live his life as a gallivanting charmer — but when he can't take the portrait's honesty anymore, he stabs it, which causes him to age _instantaneously_ to his true age: a decrepit, hideous old man. And he dies.

-   In _The Ship Who... Searched_, Moira was born with a form of progeria that rapidly aged her body. Her brain was well developed, making her a candidate for the shellperson program. Her parents held off for a time trying to find a cure, but agreed to have her encapsulated when she was about four.
-   In _Something Wicked This Way Comes_, this happens to Mr. Cooger when Will causes the magical merry-go-round to spin forward so rapidly while he's on it that he can't get off in time to avoid aging to a nearly-dead mummified husk of a two-hundred-year-old man. The other carnival members manage to keep him alive by pumping him full of electricity but he still disintegrates into dust close to the book's climax.
-   Trademaster's bargain for transporting Claire to her son in _Son_ is taking her youth, which rapidly turns her into an old woman. She gets better when he is defeated.
-   In _Stardust_, the witch assigned to pursue and kill a falling star (who are human-looking in this universe) eats the saved-up remnant of the heart of the last star she and her two sisters killed which restores her youth and beauty. However, this remnant gives her only a limited amount of magical power and the more magic she uses, the more her restored youth fades, and she ends up using so much magic that she winds up appearing even older than she was at the start of the book (though she doesn't die).
-   In _The Tale of Lost Time_ by Yevgeny Shvarts, four lazy children age about seventy years overnight after four wizards curse them and steal their life years. When they manage to reverse the curse, the wizards, in turn, turn from kids to decrepit old people in a minute. The Aesop is that you won't notice your own aging if you waste your time pointlessly.
-   Happens to Thursday's former boyfriend, Filbert Snood, in the _Thursday Next_ series. During his work for the Chronoguard, he accidentally got caught outside of time and space and rapidly aged sixty years in only a matter of minutes. Unable to face her, Filbert disappeared from Thursday's life, only for them to end up working on a case together, where he pretends to be his own father.
-   There's an interesting variation in the _Time Police_ novels by Jodi Taylor. Time travel is possible but illegal unless you're a member of said Time Police and the punishment for being caught time travelling is to be imprisoned. Only you're trapped in a different area of time but are returned to your own time almost immediately after you left, meaning that you appear to age however many years in maybe six months or so. This punishment is used on the villain in the second book and she has aged terribly for it.
    
    **Ellis**: Imagine a young man of twenty-five and serving forty years – which is the usual sentence for this type of offence. He’s released. Technically his punishment is over but it’s not. His punishment really begins when he realises he’s now an old man who can’t get his knees to work properly any longer. His hair’s fallen out – because the Time Police won’t have made it an easy forty years for him. He returns to the outside world to find he’s older than his parents. His kids don’t recognise him. His wife and all his friends are still twenty-five and on their way to the pub for a piss-up. Without him. Because he’s in bed. With his Horlicks. His life is drawing to an end but everyone else is just beginning theirs. His youth has gone forever and he’ll never get those years back. He may have been released but he’ll be isolated for the rest of his life. Think about it.

    Live-Action TV

(However, the novelization of this story takes an alternate interpretation of these events, describing how Kerensky was trapped in a faster timestream, spending the entire rest of his life alone there, slowly dying of old age, as the main timestream seemed to move incredibly slowly around him).
    -   In "The Leisure Hive", the Argolins have this as a racial trait — they remain youthful for most of their lives, before suddenly aging to death in a matter of hours. The Doctor is subjected to this too and forcibly aged 500 years (although, being that this is the Doctor and he's pushing 900 at this point, this only causes him to go from looking like a well-kept 40-something into looking like he's in his 80s).
    -   In "Army of Ghosts", the Doctor pretends to the Torchwood Institute that Jackie Tyler, Rose's mother, is Rose after having undergone this. Jackie is not amused.

-   _Earth: Final Conflict_: Liam Kincaid grows from a baby to 30-some man in less than a day. Given that his father (one of them) is an Energy Being, it is possible this was intentional. Liam is also perfectly mature, although certain social facts (such as why women laugh when talking about sex) don't make sense to him.
-   An episode of _Eureka_ had Fargo's grandfather awaken from cryo-freeze and then at the end of the episode underwent Rapid Aging as his body suddenly tried to catch up. It was implied that this would eventually lead to his death if not stopped. They did manage to stop, but not reverse the process.
-   Griffen Grey in _The Flash (2014)_ has accelerated aging as a side effect of his superhuman strength, just like his comics counterpart.
-   _Fringe_: Some years ago, as told in "The Same Old Story", a program was started to create test-tube soldiers. Part of the soldiers' design was rapidly increased growth. Unfortunately, they were unable to _stop_ the aging process once the soldiers got old enough and the program was eventually shut down. Years later, it's discovered that one of the soldiers has been surviving by stealing people's pituitary glands. At one point, he inadvertently impregnates a woman and passes on his condition to the fetus. The child dies of old age within five hours.

-   _Luna Nera_: ntalia's spell to hide Valente causes her to rapidly age, and she becomes Natalia.
-   An organism created by a scientist in _MacGyver (1985)_ causes plants and animals to rapidly age. This isn't so bad for plants, since it just brings them to maturity faster, but isn't so good for animals since they die of old age in a few minutes.
-   _Merlin (2008)_ has a magical version, with Merlin casting a spell on himself that transforms him into his 80-year-old self, known to everyone else as 'Dragoon'.
-   Played with in a scam on _Mission: Impossible_ as the IMF team convinces a man he's found a "fountain of youth". Casey claims to actually be over a century old to the mark and needs to drink from the water every 48 hours. They then give him makeup so he believes he's becoming younger.

-   _Stargate-verse_:
    -   _Stargate SG-1_:
        -   In the episode "Brief Candle", all of the inhabitants of a planet age at over 200 times that of normal humans as they life span is only 100 days. Additionally, Jack O'Neill is rapidly (although artificially, and therefore reversibly) aged by nanobots.
        -   Adria, the Dark Messiah of the Ori born to Vala, aged into an adult within a day, but then her aging resumed to normal after that.
    -   This happens to anyone the Wraith feed on in _Stargate Atlantis_. They can also reverse it, as demonstrated by Todd on Colonel Sheppard.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   _Star Trek: The Original Series_:

The _Enterprise_ encounters starship USS _Lantree_ with a crew that all died from old age, despite most of the crew being in their mid 30s or younger. Traveling to the genetic research station the _Lantree_ just visited, Doctor Pulaski aged rapidly due to an accident that exposed her to a retrovirus that re-wrote not only her DNA but also the DNA of the _Lantree_ crew. After figuring out how to reverse the effects of the retrovirus the _Enterprise_ scuttles the _Lantree_ to keep the retrovirus from spreading.
        -   In "Man of the People", Deanna Troi starts to age rapidly, and grow violently paranoid, when she's unknowingly used by a villain as a psychic receptacle of negative emotion. When the effect is turned back on the villain, he shrivels up and dies within a few seconds.
    -   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_:
        -   This happens to Doctor Bashir in the episode "Distant Voices", although it turns out that the whole aging thing is all in his mind (literally) because he was in a coma.
        -   Jem'Hadar soldiers have a _very_ rapid "childhood", going from birth to combat-ready in three days.
    -   Also recycled in the fan-created _Star Trek: New Voyages_ episode "To Serve All My Days", though most of the episode turned out to be All Just a Dream.
    -   In the _Star Trek: Voyager_ episode "The Thaw", Harry Kim is trapped in a Circus of Fear and a Monster Clown quips that Harry doesn't know what's going on but the two people who'd been his (the clown's) prisoners for a while did, because "you're new and they're old", so he decides to make Harry "old" by literally turning him into an old man. It's only for a few seconds though.
-   _Supernatural_:
    -   "The Curious Case of Dean Winchester" features an affable Irish witch named Patrick, a legendary gambler who plays cards for years. He doesn't always win, but he wins enough to have kept himself young and dapper for centuries, leaving prematurely aged corpses when people bet too high. Bobby Singer tracks him down and plays him in hopes of de-aging enough to fix his spinal injury and get out of the wheelchair but loses twenty-five years. Dean tries to help him and loses _fifty_ <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , whereupon they switched actors and Dean for some reason developed a Great Depression-era accent.
        -   Sam wins it all back, although the syphilis he got for annoying Patrick had to be treated in the normal medical fashion. Notably, Patrick is one of the foes they don't begin to defeat, although in his case it's not because they _couldn't_ contrive to, say shoot him in the face with a little stealth, but because they failed the first few times and any further attempts would feel like bad sportsmanship. Being Affably Evil can be useful.
        -   His girlfriend is apparently only about a hundred and twenty; and gets Patrick to beat her at poker and let her die because she had to watch her daughter reach a great age and die and has decided Who Wants to Live Forever?. Presumably said daughter declined Patrick's years, since he'd clearly have given them quite willingly.

-   In _Das Rheingold_ Wotan has offered the goddess Freia to the giants Fasolt and Fafnir in payment for building Walhall. He Did Not Think This Through very well, as Freia also grows the golden apples that keep the gods young. After she is taken away, they suddenly become much older.

-   The portrait of a young man (believed to be Master Gracey) in the foyer of The Haunted Mansion at Walt Disney World.

    Toys 

-   _BIONICLE_: During a clash with Makuta Teridax, the Shadowed One received a blow that sent him flying at the unconscious body of his already felled underling, Voporak. Said underling was protected by a force field that rapidly aged anything that touched it, thus the Shadowed One grew 3000 years older in a matter of seconds. Longer exposure would have turned him to dust, which is the fate Makuta's distraction army received earlier. Still, it's definitely a case of Time Dissonance...because due to the already enormous lifespans that the characters have, it would be the equivalent to a human aging less than a decade.

    Video Games 

-   In _Ancient Domains of Mystery_, ghosts and their variants have an aging touch attack. If you're an elf or a dwarf with a lifespan of hundreds of years, this isn't too big a deal. If you're something with a short lifespan, like a ratling or a troll, well...
-   In _BioShock Infinite_, it's revealed that the Lutece device, which offers the ability to see into alternate dimensions has caused Zachary Comstock (aka: Booker DeWitt) to look like he's in his late fifties despite being in his late thirties, as well as sterility.
-   In _Blasphemous_, a young woman named Viridiana will show up to offer assistance in certain boss fights. If you accept her help, she'll provide a powerful buff during the battle, but will be aged each time. After three times, she will die of old age. She does not mind the price she pays for helping you, considering it Worth It to be of aid in your quest.
-   In _Brain Dead 13_, Lance definitely dies from this if one of the ghosts possesses him and drains the living soul out of him in one death scene.
-   Some of the titular _Creatures_ can fall victim to this, dying of old age less than an hour into life — the most extreme cases in _Creatures 3_ and _Docking Station_ don't even live a full minute. The root cause varies between different games, depending on how aging is handled and what mutations can affect them: Either the creature in question depletes its Ageing/Life chemicals by converting it into another chemical, or it's born with no Ageing/Life chemical at all and will burn through every lifestage immediately after hatching.
-   In _Dark Devotion_, the player character ages from a young woman to an emaciated crone in seconds after beating the final boss, and she barely has time to take in her withered state before she drops dead.
-   One of the main threats in _Death Stranding_ is the Timefall, a mysterious and supernatural rainstorm that rapidly ages any living creature caught in it. Porter suits are designed to protect people from the effects, but can fail if damaged too badly. The Girl from FRAGILE turns out to have the head of a young girl and the body of an elderly woman, as a result of Higgs stripping her and forcing her to run through the Timefall with nothing but a Porter mask to protect her.
-   As a result of their powers, Sera from _Digital Devil Saga_ has the body of a teenager when she's actually 7 years old.

After Alduin and Orkey turned everyone in Skyrim into children, Wulfharth used the Thu'um to age them all back up. However, he aged himself up too fast and died for the first time.
-   In _Final Fantasy V_, some enemies can inflict a temporary "Old" status ailment, which makes the targeted character white-haired and physically weak.
-   Nasus, from _League of Legends_, can inflict a temporary version of this to slow and weaken an enemy.
-   Old Snake in _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_. This is due to Clone Degeneration, which gave him Werner syndrome by design. Barely a decade after the Shadow Moses incident, where Snake was still young, fit, and handsome, he essentially has the body of a chronically ill 80-year-old.
    -   This is, however, foreshadowed in earlier games, as different characters remark on how age hasn't slowed him down, or how he hasn't aged well. Despite this, a majority of the rapid aging appears to happen in the five year gap between the second and fourth games, which adds even more horror to the situation.
    -   His brother Solidus Snake in _Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty_. Like his brother Solidus also has Clone Degeneration, which gave him Werner syndrome like his brother, by the Patriot's design. Despite being 30-year-old, he essentially had the body of a 60- to 70-year-old.
-   _Metroid II: Return of Samus_: Eight hatched Metroids progress from infant to larval stage in the time it takes Samus to move from one room to another but the final infant stays an infant in the time it takes for Samus to leave the planet and fly to a research station.
-   Miis in _Miitopia_ can be affected with this condition during battles, causing their design to change to wrinkled and with grey hair.

-   In _Mystery Case Files: The Black Veil_, the Scottish town of Dreadmond is plagued by a mysterious force that drain the townpeoples' lives, aging them from approximatively sixty years in a heartbeat.
-   _N_ uses this trope to justify the game's time limit; the ninja's superhuman metabolism grants them incredible running and jumping abilities, but also gives them a natural lifespan of only 90 seconds. It doesn't explain why running out of time causes the ninja to explode, though.
-   In _Romancing SaGa 3_ Black was cursed by the clone of the Devil Lord Forneus and lost his youth, however defeating Forneus' clone with Black in your party reverts him back to his original self.
-   _Singularity_ has the TMD, which can age a living person forward until they turn to dust. Turning the clock backwards, however, has different results...
-   In _Street Fighter_, Balrog's ward and Only Friend Ed is affected with a _bad_ case of this. When he first appears in _Super Street Fighter IV_ he's a pre-teen boy, but when _Street Fighter V_ hits he alrady has the looks of an older teenager, and when he's Promoted to Playable his sprites and model are those of a heavily-muscled adult (though his in-story illustrations are still proper of an older teen). It's a _very_ justified since poor Ed was kidnapped by the S.I.N. division of Shadaloo, and experimented on in order to become a replacement body for Bison.
-   _Tomodachi Life_: One of the items you might recieve from Miis when you do them favors is an Age-O-Matic, a spray that causes kid Miis to quickly become adults. This doesn't have much effect other than them becoming taller and being able to form romantic relationships with other adults and get married. When two kid Miis decide they want to get married, they will ask you to spray them with an Age-O-Matic so they will be able to. The game also has the Fountain of Youth counterpart in the Kid-O-Matic.
-   In _Trauma Center: Under The Knife 2_, this is the fate of villain Reina Mayuzumi, who was using the Alethia strain of GUILT to preserve her youthful looks. The player discovers this right before the final operation, when Mercer decides to inject her with something else in hopes of learning how to cure his wife. It immediately drains Mayuzumi's body into that of an old woman, as well as causing the GUILT to rampage through her body. Notably, the player saves her life...but not her _looks_.
-   _Warcraft_:
    -   Khadgar was the young apprentice of the Guardian Medivh, but when Medivh turned out to be the host of the demonic Sargeras, Khadgar was forced to kill him, and in the ensuing fight, Medivh artificially aged Khadgar.
    -   Garona Halforcen was originally introduced as half-human, half-orc, the result of the protracted war between the two races over the course of the original _Warcraft_. The conflict was _drastically_ shortened in later revisions of the history, so Garona was explained to be the result of forced mating between orcs and _draenei_, magically-aged and brainwashed to serve as an advance scout.
    -   This was actually a prefered method of recruitment in the Old Horde. Gul'dan would have his warlocks use their Life Drain magic to force orc children into early adulthood so they could fight on the front lines that much sooner.

When they refine the process a bit and pull out Vole he ages hundreds of years in a matter of seconds (and later states he's fairly convinced he felt every minute). Luckily the information gained from their experiment with Vole allows them to figure out how to pull people out without the aging side effects.
-   In _Kill Six Billion Demons_, the demiurge Mottom owns ''The'' Tree of Life, whose fruits can restore a withered crone to her pre-teen glory years<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . However, the fruit's main effects only last a few hours, and she rapidly degenerates to a middle-aged woman within the span of hours. Allison destroys the tree to stop the blood sacrifices of virgins powering it, and Mottom ages even faster as she draws upon her powers in a fit of rage.

-   _SCP Foundation_
    -   SCP-119 ("Timecrowave"). SCP-119 is a microwave oven which can speed up the flow of time inside of it. Its power setting can be set in a range of 1-5. The time (in seconds) that the microwave is on is raised to the exponential power of the setting to determine the actual time that passes inside SCP-119. So if the power setting is 5 and SCP-119 runs for 30 seconds then (30 x 30 x 30 x 30 x 30) seconds (or 281.25 days) pass inside it. Anything inside SCP-119 suffers the increased aging that occurs.
    -   SCP-224 ("Grandfather Clock"). When it chimes it causes time to speed up in the surrounding area, sometimes causing people within range of the sound to age up to several years in a short time. In one case a person was affected by 7 chimes, aging them approximately 70 years in a matter of seconds.
    -   SCP-429 ("Clockwork Teleporter"). If someone tries to use it without understanding it they will still teleport, but when they re-appear they will be dead and in a state of advanced decay. Monitoring devices sent with it on one of these jaunts recorded over 8 months passing. The creator of SCP-429 died of old age after using it too often.
    -   SCP-723 ("Aging Staircase"). SCP-723 is a spiral stone staircase. When a person climbs it, after the fourth or fifth step they start aging rapidly, with additional aging occurring for each additional step taken.
    -   SCP-728 ("The Forever Room"). This can occur due to the time-manipulating abilities of SCP-728. During one test only one hour passed on the outside of SCP-728, but when SCP-728 was opened again, the person who had been inside SCP-728 had aged to death.
    -   SCP-896 ("Online Role Playing Game"). A researcher who played the game for less than 10 hours straight leveled up many times but then died. An autopsy showed severe arthritis, Alzheimer’s, a cataract and several tumors, indicating death from old age.
    -   SCP-983 ("The Birthday Monkey"). Each time the Birthday Monkey sings a verse the person who activated it will age 1 year. If it isn't deactivated the victim will be aged to death. The Monkey will continue singing verses until the victim has been reduced to a skeleton.
    -   SCP-1007 ("Mr. Life and Mr. Death"). SCP-1007 ages at a rate of 1 year per minute until it reaches age 75, at which point it dies. Then it comes back to life and goes through the same routine again, and again. If a key is inserted in its back and turned, it will age backwards...
    -   SCP-1066 ("Instant Education"). When a man signs the SCP-1066 diploma he disappears for 4-10 minutes. When he reappears, he's four years older.
    -   SCP-1080 ("The Creche"). When a child less than 13 years old enters the chamber, it closes and locks. When it opens three to five days later, the child is about 20 years old.
    -   SCP-1211 ("King in the Castle"). After inhabiting the castle for three months, a man 35 years old will have become about 80 years old. After an additional month (or more) subjects will experience rotting of the skin and muscle tissue and skeletal degeneration, but don't die.
    -   SCP-1225 ("The Worst Christmas"). When SCP-1225 is activated, anything within 4 meters and inside a container ages at a high rate: one year in the first 24 hours, and a total of ten years after three weeks, after which the aging stops.
    -   SCP-1627 ("Mushroom Wars"). After a person makes skin contact with an example of SCP-1627-A, over the next two weeks the person will age rapidly until they die of old age.
    -   SCP-1657 ("MAN EGG"). After they're hatched, SCP-1657 grow to maturity (the equivalent of human adulthood) in only 13 days, and die of old age in 17 days.
    -   SCP-1716 ("Imperfect Life Extender"). SCP-1716 causes the Life Energy donor to age 10 years for every year the recipient's life is extended.
    -   SCP-1979 ("Relativistic Treadmill"). Time passes faster than normal inside SCP-1979's time acceleration sphere. A person inside the sphere will age at a higher than normal rate, with the rate increasing as the sphere expands. At a radius of 25 meters, a person will age at a rate of 10,404 times normal, or 173 minutes per second. As the sphere expands to 30 meters it will age about 9 years. By the time the sphere reaches 35 meters, they will age another 48 years. By the time the sphere reached 40 meters, they would be long dead.
    -   SCP-2647 ("Premium"). Anyone who signs up for an SCP-2647 life insurance policy will stop aging for as long as the policy continues in effect. If the person cancels the policy they will quickly grow older until they are their true age, which could cause them to die of old age.
-   One Internet meme has people explaining that they aged so rapidly as to turn to dust during a conversation with a younger person, usually in response to a What Are Records? question like "What's a brony?", "What's teabagging mean?", learning _Mass Effect_ is now considered a retro game, etc.

    Western Animation

-   _Codename: Kids Next Door_.
    -   The Kids Next Door frequently come up against technology that can rapidly age them into adults.

-   Episode "Three Men and an Egon" of _The Real Ghostbusters_ deals with both Egon and a ghost magically affected by a cursed clock causing egon to de-age and causing the ghost to the opposite (and in case you find weird a ghost can grow older is because some of the ghosts in the franchise are more like creatures from other dimensions than spirits of the dead).
