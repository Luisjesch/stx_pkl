_"Before she realized his intent, Dally caught her by the arms. His kiss was so sudden and fierce that for a second she thought her front teeth would be knocked down her throat. Then he was gone. She stared after him, incredulous, then pushed the incident to the back of her mind."_

You are getting increasingly frustrated. Your Love Interest is ignoring your affections for them, even though you're making it oh so blatantly obvious. And you love them so much, so much that you can't stand it, that you wish they would stop ignoring you, and stop being so oblivious to your love for them. What do you gotta do?

Why, grab them, pull them close to you and plant a big wet one right on those lips that you've been dying to kiss for so long! And of course, you may not think about what possible consequences that your actions could bring you, since you are just too damn excited at being able to be so close to your love.

Engaging in this trope means that you may be a bit overly confident in your attempts to "woo" someone, you may have no idea how to actually do the whole romance thing, or you just couldn't help yourself, and you simply had to get your feelings across somehow.

Sometimes overlaps with "Shut Up" Kiss, Motivational Kiss and Tsundere. It may also happen to a person who is the victim in a I Have You Now, My Pretty moment. May or may not hint at an Attempted Rape, as a non-consensual kiss in Real Life can be charged as sexual harassment or even assault. See also "Take That!" Kiss.

    Comic Books 

-   _Archie Comics_: In one early comic from when Betty was absolutely obsessed with Archie, Betty went around kissing various girls and running off while dressed in a disguise. This was some roundabout way to force Archie into a kiss.
-   _Batman_: Poison Ivy, passionate Femme Fatale that she is, often pulls her victims in for a smoldering smooch, regardless of consent. Her favorite kissing partner is, of course, Batman. While there's always an ulterior motive behind it, Ivy unambiguously enjoys locking lips with him, paying no mind to his noncompliance as she savors their steamy embrace.
-   In _Convergence_, Flashpoint Aquaman plants a kiss on pre-Flashpoint Mera, who she then slaps him on the mouth. He doesn't actually mind this at all as she is no different from _his_ Mera.
-   _Death of the Family_: Hours after being knocked unconscious by a centrifugal death trap that tears her costume to shreds, Catwoman wakes up to the Joker giving her a non-consensual smooch.
-   _Fables_:
    -   Prince Charming (naturally) gives one to Beauty, and while she does return the kiss and admit she was tempted to cheat on her husband, she very firmly says it will never happen again. She's right; the near-affair with Charming (plus his insistence that one thing he's _never_ wrong about is when a woman is genuinely attracted to him and unhappy with her current marriage,) prompts her to treat her husband much better than she had been, and their relationship is actually strengthened by the near-betrayal.
    -   Prince Ambrose, after ages spent dancing around their obvious mutual attraction, finally gives one to Red Riding Hood, after nearly ending the conversation with a carefully formal good-bye. She returns it, and from then on they are an Official Couple.
    -   A decidedly unwelcome version comes from Prince Brandish to Snow White. He insists that their Childhood Marriage Promise is completely valid and overrides her subsequent marriages, and thus it is his right to kiss and paw at her whenever he wants. When he kidnaps her and locks her in his room, he doesn't actually rape her (though he does break her arm and then make her cook his dinner), but more because he's totally confident that she will come come "panting" for him on her own accord before too long, rather than because he thinks her consent is relevant.
-   _Invincible_: The title character receives one by Anissa, a full blooded Viltrumite known for her temper and view of all non-Viltrumite lifeforms. It's completely out of character for her, but it later suggests that she did it to seduce him to being her mate. When it didn't work, she decided to flat-out rape him.
-   _Robin (1993)_: Darla Aquista forced a kiss on Tim Drake in front of most of the student body of their high school and his girlfriend after she refused to believe him telling her repeatedly that he wasn't interested.
-   In _Day of Vengeance_, Ragman thinks he and Enchantress are having a romantic moment and plants a kiss on her, much to her disgust and anger. She repeatedly mocks him for it afterwards.

-   In _The Sanctuary Tree_, Donald Duck tries to use a love potion to make Daisy fall in love with him again (they break up at the beginning of the story), but whoever ends up drinking the potion accidentally is a fat female guard with whom Donald had a disagreement early in the story. She falls madly in love with Donald and tries to kiss him forcibly, much to his horror, who runs away scared (and to make matters worse, Daisy catches them both and assumes the worst, ending their relationship for good).
-   _Scott Pilgrim vs. The World_: Played with in Volume 6. Being the most emotionally vulnerable he's ever been, Scott kisses Kim in a desperate attempt to reconnect their lost relationship. Kim is clearly surprised by the kiss, but is initially receptive of it... But soon breaks it off. Kim's expression immediately after the fact indicates that she was scared of how effective it was, but the two finally resolve the lack of closure in their relationship soon after.
-   Volume 2 issue 15 of _Spectacular Spider-Man_ introduces a villain called Queen. She easily overpowers Spidey with her mind control powers and sonic scream. After catching the defeated Spider-Man in a hug and telling him not to be ashamed of his defeat, she plants a big wet kiss on his lips while he can't resist her. In the very next issue she flirts with the captured Spidey and forces another kiss on him. He almost accepts the kiss due to her powers, but manages to push her off him. She does not take this well.

    -   Luke Skywalker is subjected to a number of these in _Star Wars (Marvel 1977)_, probably because he's never really willing to make the first move.

When Raphael tried to leave her vehicle she grabbed him by the streams of his bandana, pulled him close and said "Shut up and kiss me, you dumkoff!"

-   In _Corpse Bride_, after coming back to life and chasing her "husband" Victor through the woods and onto a bridge, the titular character Emily gives him one after saying "You may kiss the bride" and before whisking him away to the land of the dead.

Once she finds out he's not really her husband in human form, he simply drops the pretense of wooing her and cuts to the chase.
