_"The curtains close / on a kiss God knows / we can tell the end is near."_

When the Official Couple kiss at or very near the ending of the series or film. If the kiss itself isn't the very last shot, it will probably be followed by their wedding, a dance, Riding into the Sunset, or closing the bedroom door. If the kiss _is_ the very last shot, bonus cheese points may be awarded for ending with an Iris Out centered on it.

Chances are good this will precede any ending narration or title card that says "And they lived Happily Ever After."

Being an Ending Trope, it's a given the examples contain **SPOILERS**. Consider yourself warned.

Sometimes a sub-trope of Last-Minute Hookup, or it might happen at a Wedding Finale. Not to be confused with Last Kiss, A Magic Contract Comes with a Kiss, or Signed with a Kiss.

    Western Animation 

-   _The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius_ managed to do this without anyone planning it. The show was abruptly cancelled after its third season (at least 4 scripts for Season 4 had already been written). Not only that, but the big Villain Team-Up episode that was originally intended to serve as the third season finale was aired almost a year and a half _before_ the season ended. The result? One of the last 3 episodes to air ("Lady Sings the Blues") had a B-plot of Jimmy and Cindy accepting their feelings for each other and ended with them kissing on the lips, which is why half the fandom considers it the series finale.

-   _Batman: The Animated Series_: Although not said with it's usually intended meaning, Poison Ivy directly quotes this in "Pretty Poison" before applying her special lipstick and sharing a deep, passionate kiss with an unwilling Batman. Given what type of person Ivy is her subversion was likely intentional.
-   _Kim Possible_:
    -   _So the Drama_, which was supposed to be the Finale Movie until the series got renewed for another season, closes with Kim and Ron kissing at the school dance.
    -   "Graduation", the finale of the fourth and final season, ends with Kim and Ron kissing as they fly off into the moon-set in their flying car.
