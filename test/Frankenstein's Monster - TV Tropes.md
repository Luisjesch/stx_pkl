RRRRRRRR!

_"It's alive, it's alive, it's alive! It's **alive!** Oh, in the name of God, now I know what it feels like to be God!"_

An iconic product of mad science, this creature has lumbered through scores of films and TV series, monstrous yet also pitiful.

In the original 1818 book by Mary Shelley, Victor Frankenstein creates the monster, then, repulsed by his creation, immediately throws him out. Later, the monster returns and demands that Victor make him a wife. Victor agrees, then reconsiders and destroys the half-completed bride. The monster retaliates by killing Victor's best friend and threatens more death should Victor ever marry. Victor marries his adoptive sister, who is also his cousin, Elizabeth, who is promptly killed while Victor is dutifully staying away from her, thinking the threat was to him. Victor then chases the monster into The Arctic, but dies from the cold. The monster then goes off and kills himself (or at least he says that's what he's going to do).

Few of this book's tropes are original — most are commonplace in Gothic novels of the eighteenth century — but they provide the oldest examples that are still widely read today. In it, the monster is created a blank slate, but is driven to evil by the way society mistreats him. Tropes introduced by the novel include:

-   Flesh Golem
-   Non-Malicious Monster (At least, not initially...)
-   If I Can't Have You…
-   Gone Horribly Wrong
-   Creating Life

The book was first filmed in 1910, but the 1931 Universal Pictures production was the most influential version. This film added several now familiar tropes to the story, including:

-   The Mad Scientist Laboratory
-   Grave Robbing to get the parts for the monster
-   Lightning Can Do Anything (Using lightning to create life.)
-   Torches and Pitchforks (The torch-wielding mob of peasants.)
-   Victor's death at the hands of his creation
-   Hulk Speak
-   The Igor
-   Kill It with Fire
-   The "It's Alive!" quotation above
-   The "standard" appearance of the monster, usually consisting of a square (or just flat-topped) head, greenish skin (despite the classic Universal films all being released in black and white)<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , enormous proportions, a scarred or stitched forehead, and bolts (actually electrodes) on either side of the neck. (To contrast, the most monstrous features of the novel's creature are his proportions and his jaundiced, soulless eyes.) Nowadays this is a Discredited Trope, but can still be seen in spoofs and other comedic interpretations, or in intentional homages to the Universal version.
-   Haunted Castle
-   Überwald (Arguably, the film and its sequels codified the setting.)
-   Mighty Glacier (The novel's version is if anything a Lightning Bruiser)
-   Implacable Man: He might be slow and staggering, but he _is_ coming for you.

In the early films, the monster is evil because a criminal or damaged brain was used. Modern films and TV series often revert to the original idea, depicting the monster as an innocent trapped in a monstrous body, unaware of the damage he can do, rejected by a cruel world. When he starts out as an Evil Minion, he often does a Heel–Face Turn.

The name of the monster is up for debate. Popular opinion and even a couple of the movies just go ahead and refer to him as "Frankenstein" (which does make sense, because he's a twisted sort of "offspring" of the doctor and Frankenstein is a surname). Originally, his name is _Adam,_ at least according to readings given by Shelley during her lifetime.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  In the text of the book, though, he is generally referred to as "the creature" or "the daemon." (Frankenstein didn't care about him enough to give him a name, and since the creature never made any friends, he didn't bother to name himself.) See also Dr. Fakenstein for cases where this naming issue is averted.

Part of the classic Monster Mash with Dracula, Mummy, the Wolf Man and the Swamp Monster. Compare also with the Flesh Golem and Mix-and-Match Man. Examples based specifically on Boris Karloff's portrayal of the monster in the 1931 film and its sequels may overlap with Karloff Kopy.

    Advertising 

-   _Monster Cereals_:
    -   No such inventory is complete without the pastiche commercial Mascot Frankenberry. A far more sensitive iteration of the Monster, Frankenberry takes elements of steampunk in his design, along with being bright pink in color.
    -   Downplayed with Carmella Creeper. While she's technically a zombie, she fills in some gaps of the Bride of Frankenstein, namely her green skin and white stripe through her hair. Fittingly, she's Frankenberry's cousin.
-   Among the products Frankenstein's Monster has promoted:
-   The 2016 Apple iPhone Christmas commercial involves the monster (played by the tall guy from _Everybody Loves Raymond_) recording _There's No Place like Home for the Holidays_ on his smartphone, retrieving a box from his mail, and walking into town. His appearance at the local holiday festivities frightens the townsfolk, and he opens his box to reveal two lights, one red; one green, which he sockets into the electrodes on his neck. He begins singing along with the recording, only for one of the lights to burn out. This gets the locals even more upset, but a little girl beckons him over and fixes the bulb. She starts singing the carol; everyone takes it up. It then pans up to slogan "Open your heart to everyone".
-   The 1995 Halloween ad campaign for McDonald's (as well as the associated Happy Meal Toys) consisted of the McDonaldland gang having Halloween costumes (Grimace going as a ghost, Hamburglar as some kind of bat monster and Birdie the Early Bird wearing a jack-o-lantern costume), with a big part of the marketing strategy based on Ronald McDonald trying to decide what costume he should wear. He eventually encounters a goofy-looking Frankenstein monster, which inspires him to go as Frankenstein's monster and the monster to in turn dress as Ronald.
-   "Frankenbones" from Bones Coffee is a chocolate hazelnut flavored coffee with a skeletal Frankenstein on the cover.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Soreike! Anpanman_ has Frankenrobo, which is a robot form of a Frankenstein's monster.
-   Nobuhiro Watsuki (creator of _Rurouni Kenshin_ and _Buso Renkin_) made a one-shot called _Embalming: Corpse and Bride_. The main character is a monster called John Doe, and other monsters are the bad guys. A modified version with new main characters (but with John lurking in the background) is now running under the title _Embalming: The Another Tale of Frankenstein_. The premise of both is that Frankenstein's notebooks survived his death, and a thriving underground corpse-raising industry has resulted.
    -   Speaking of _Buso Renkin_, that series has a character who has traits of both the good doctor and his creation- not as seen in the movies, but as presented in the original novel. The character _Victor_ is a human alchemist-turned-hommunculus who is unstoppably destructive (against his control), and is a highly intellectual Tragic Monster.
-   In _Soul Eater_ Dr. Franken Stein (First name Franken, last name Stein) is a (barely) good guy who literally has a giant screw loose in his head; he constantly is tightening it. Obsessed with vivisection (he has taken his own body apart and stitched it back together), the very concept of insanity, and the nature of knowledge of man in respect to God; he's an amalgamation of Frankenstein's Monster and Dr. Frankenstein himself. Being clever, the writers eventually give him a partner named Mary (although this reference is debatable, as most translations render the name as "Marie" instead).
    -   Stein has had his own test-subject in his former Weapon, Spirit Albarn (himself descended from people experimented on by the witch Arachne). Franken also frequently expresses desire to cut up/dissect various characters, including child god Death the Kid. Which, given his issues with gods, is something that might be worth keeping an eye on. Maybe.
-   In _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_ attempts to revive the dead with alchemy results in Homunculi, Frankensteinian monsters with special powers. Several of these monsters also feature the same kind of pathologies and relationships with its master as Frankenstein's original monster.
-   From the same creator is _Raiden 18_, a recurring Black Comedy series about a girl who's favorite hobby is creating frankenstein monsters.
-   In the original _Dragon Ball_ manga, Goku befriends the Red Ribbon Army's Android #8, who is an obvious reference to the Monster. Strangely enough, he only plays a bit part in _Dragon Ball Z_, although several other androids in the same line show up and play major roles in the storyline. _Z_'s real Frankenstein's Monster is Cell, who was created from the cells of Goku, Piccolo, Vegeta, Frieza, and King Cold.
-   The Mariages from _StrikerS Sound Stage X_. Also known as Corpse Weapons, these are mass-produced artificial soldiers created from corpses, courtesy of the technology from Ancient Belka.
-   _Franken Fran_ has... well, Fran. She's what would happen if Frankenstein had made a Cute Monster Girl and sent it to medical school. While skipping ethics class.
-   _The Monster of Frankenstein_ (_Kyōfu Densetsu Kaiki! Frankenstein_) is a 1981 TV Asahi anime adaptation of Shelley's original novel, produced by Studio Live and Toei Animation under license from Marvel Comics. The monster never gets beyond inarticulate grunting, there's a poorly executed Christ metaphor, and to cap it all off, the ending is pure Trauma Conga Line as the monster, realizing that he's hurting people, throws himself off a cliff in front of the little girl he befriended. As she's mourning him, her father, one of the people who persecuted the monster, _shoots himself_. Poor little girl. The anime was released in an English dub version in the US and UK in 1984; the best place to find it is the Anime Hell panel of several American conventions.
-   Junji Ito has done a manga adaptation, collected in _Junji Ito Kyoufu Manga Collection_. With his signature artistic style, it's quite creepy and notable for following Shelley's original story very faithfully.

-   _Blood Lad_: Akim Papladon is an artificial demon who is created by Doctor Franken who has screws in his head. Akim steals body parts he likes from other beings and attachs them on his body. His heart can be transplanted into other corpses.
-   _Bleach_:
    -   The Halloween Episode has Ichigo Kurosaki alias Franken Ichigo who was revived by his sisters Karin (the doctor) and Yuzu (the assistant).
    -   Nemu is a more straight example, if only in concept (after all, Victor didn't treat his creature as a guinea pig).
-   _The Empire of Corpses_ features a race against time for Victor Frankenstein's original notes, with a young med student named John Watson being caught up in it when he uses them to resurrect his colleague Friday.
-   _Fate/Apocrypha_ features a female version of Frankenstein's Monster, fully subject to the _Fate Series_' signature Artistic License, summoned as the Berserker of Black. Her backstory involves originally being made by Victor Frankenstein as the first of a pair, but he got cold feet upon seeing how "Eve" turned out and fled, with her chasing him and desiring that he finish the job and a mate like her ala _Bride of Frankenstein_. She wields a powerful mace that doubles as her power source and weapon that shoots lightning bolts, and she really doesn't like it when people call her Frankenstein.
-   _My Hero Academia_ have the Nomus, artificial monsters created by All-For-One and his head doctor that are granted multiple Quirks either by All-For-One or by artificial replication by Dr Garaki. And as an added connection to the novel, many of the Quirks are acquired from dead individuals, such as a deceased classmate of Erasurehead and Present Mic.
-   The interpretation of Mewtwo from _Pokémon: The First Movie_ has many parallels to Shelley's original version of the Creature. Like the Creature, Mewtwo was impressionable yet held a sense of loneliness, grown in a lab as an experiment yet feared by his creators for being a success. Violently escaping from the lab and developing a sense of misanthropy, Mewtwo went on a journey to find out just what his existence means. After falling in with Team Rocket for a while, Mewtwo comes to the conclusion that Humans Are Bastards and decides to find solace in others of his kind, though instead of a romantic mate he instead created an entire legion of cloned Pokémon (who eventually became like family to him).
-   In _Tenrou Sirius the Jaeger_, Klarwein creates a killing machine that looks like a Frankenstein Monster in creation. Also overlaps with Killer Robot as the monster that Klarwein creates is mechanical. It is also shown in the opening scene.
-   _The Death Mage Who Doesn't Want a Fourth Time_:
    -   The protagonist creates one with his death magic using the remnants of the corpses from a long dead adventuring party and compensating the missing parts with monster organs. The end result is named Rapiéçage and she has the body of a mage, the head and muscles of a warrior woman, the limbs of an ogre, the tail of a snake with a bee stinger, the horns of a triceratops and the wings of a pterodactyl.
    -   Another one is Yamata, who wasn't created by Vandalieu but nonetheless fits. She's a huge nine-headed hydra whose heads were replaced with the torsos of beautiful women of different races. Unsurprisingly she Rapiéçage get along like sisters.
-   In _Digimon Adventure 02_, the Digimon Kaiser<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  combined the copied data of Adult<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and Perfect<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  level Digimon to create Chimeramon<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Chimeramon was meant to be the Kaiser's partner, but it went out of control and would have destroyed everything if not for Wormmon's sacrifice giving Mangamon the strength he needed.

    Card Games 

-   _Magic: The Gathering_: Creatures of this sort tend to be classified as zombies in-game, although ones created as stitched-together Flesh Golems rather than simply reanimated corpses.

    Comic Books 

-   Golden Age cartoonist Dick Briefer had a noteworthy run in the 1940's/1950's which went through three distinct changes in style. The first incarnation, beginning in _Prize Comics_ #7 (1940) presented the creature as a Villain Protagonist of high intellect battling first his own creator and later the superheroic Bulldog Denny. (The monster was eventually defeated by a coalition of Prize Comics' co-stars in one of the first superhero crossover stories). The tone shifted to humor in _Frankenstein_ #1 (1945), with stories that could be considered precursors to _The Munsters_ and _The Addams Family_. Finally, in the early 1950's, with EC Comics dominating the market, Briefer returned the monster to his more horrific roots with a memorable re-imagining of the monster as a mute wanderer. Examples of Briefer's work from all three periods can be found at these blogs: Early Horror. Humor. Later Horror.
-   The latter of the two title characters in the comic book miniseries _Doll and Creature_ is essentially a '50s greaser version of Frankenstein's monster from a freaky future world. Doll is a human woman, but she has the classic Bride of Frankenstein two-tone beehive hairdo.
-   Appears as a (titanically badass) hero in Grant Morrison's comic _Seven Soldiers_. The name issue is resolved by stating that he's deliberately taken Dr. Frankenstein's name as his own. The Bride also features, not just with the classic hair-do, but also with an extra pair of arms.
    -   He goes on to get a _Flashpoint_ miniseries and a subsequent ongoing, _Frankenstein: Agent of S.H.A.D.E._ Incidentally, in the former he ends World War II by _killing Hitler_.
        
        _"All in a day's work... for FRANKENSTEIN!"_
        
    -   A teenaged version of this character, Young Frankenstein, was briefly a member of the _Teen Titans_.
-   While Simon Dark is clearly _not_ Frankenstein's creation, given _that_ fellow is running around with the Seven Soldiers, he is unabashedly inspired by him and is a patchwork of twenty-four dead teenagers brought to life with Mad Science and Black Magic.
-   The third issue of the miniseries _Harley & Ivy_ has a part where Poison Ivy has a nightmare where she's thrown to her doom by a Frankenstein monster resembling Harley Quinn from the neck up.
-   The monster also features in _Hellboy_ when he is forced by a Mexican Mad Scientist (who bought him) to fight Hellboy in a wrestling match. He got his own spinoff series in 2015.
-   In a _Howard the Duck_ comic from the '70s, Steve Gerber revived the story with two twists. One, the Dr. Frankenstein figure was a little girl. Two, the monster she created was a seven-foot walking gingerbread man.
-   _Little Gloomy_ has Frank, who is, well, the Monster. He's slightly dim (_slightly_), and parts of him occasionally fall off and need to be restitched. He's actually one of the main characters, with a crush on Gloomy herself (though eventually he gets a "bride", Shelley).
-   The 'actual' Frankenstein's Monster has showed up many times over the years in comic books, but _Swamp Thing_ also has the Patchwork Man, a normal man who was 'repaired' (badly) by Swamp Thing's enemy, the Mad Scientist Anton Arcane. Adding to the tragedy, the unfortunate in question is Anton's brother, and the father of Swamp Thing's human girlfriend.
-   Volume 2 of _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_ includes a "bonus" world almanac of fantastical places, which reveals that after jumping off the ship at the end of the original novel, the creature found his way into Toyland, and married the queen. He later appears in person in the comic's final volume alongside other "Frankensteins" (aka versions of the monster from other works of fiction) that his wife ordered built so that he wouldn't be lonely. He also seems to think of himself as just Frankenstein; when Mina tells him that most people think he should be properly referred to as "Frankenstein's Monster", he bitterly asks if that's supposed to make him feel better, resenting the label of "monster."
-   _Superman_:
    -   Bizarro, in incarnations where he is an imperfect clone of Superman created by Lex Luthor, is pretty much Frankenstein's Monster due to being an artificial being who is usually portrayed as a tragic figure who is shunned for his frightful appearance in spite of meaning no intentional harm.
    -   _Superman himself_ in the Elseworlds title _The Superman Monster_, which retells the tale of Frankenstein, but with Lex as the doctor, Superman as the Monster, and the story changed up a bit. Interestingly enough, the story has the Superman Monster initially appear pale and deformed, making him resemble the aforementioned Bizarro.
    -   In _Action Comics_ #531, Superman battles the Monster and Dracula, though they may not have been the genuine creatures but rather creations of a dead writer's mind. The Phantom Stranger helps.
    -   _Superman & Batman: Generations_ has a scene taking place in 1959 in which Superman transforms into a Super-Giant and goes on a rampage after exposure to Red Kryptonite. Superman has a flat head and green skin in this state, making him resemble a gigantic Frankenstein monster in a Superman costume.
-   In _The Killers of Krypton_, Supergirl faces several malformed, monstrous clones of herself created by Harry Hokum's head geneticist. The clones are depicted as mindless, tragic and pitiable creatures who only attack people because they have been ordered to.
-   Like Dracula, Dell Comics turned Frankenstein's Monster into an honest-to-goodness Superhero.
-   In _Fables_, Frakenstein's Monster was animated by Nazis during World War II. Bigby fought the monster (in a reference to the 1943 film _Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man_) when he and a squad of Allied soldiers stormed the castle where the experiment was being performed. The Monster's still-animated head is kept in the business office in the Woodlands building where Bigby chats with him from time to time. He often has phantom thirst and is given drinks by Bufkin, though the last time this happened, the bottom of his cage rusted out.
-   In the _Batman_ Elseworlds comic _Batman: Castle of the Bat_, set in 1819 Germany, Bruce Wayne's desire to bring back his father leads him to play out the role of Dr. Frankenstein: He constructs a patchwork body from corpses, and places Thomas Wayne's brain inside. Then he injects the reanimated Thomas with "essence of bat" to fix his brain injury, causing Thomas to mutate and gain the head of a bat.
-   _Marvel Universe_ has had several analogues of Frankenstein's Creature walking about, made by in-universe scientists. One was a Hulk analogue (makes sense seeing as Hulk seems like a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde/Frankenstein's creature combo) and one led the Howling Commandos.
    -   In _Dark Reign_, Daken, son of Wolverine, killed Frank Castle, The Punisher, and he was resurrected as Franken-Castle, who led the new Monster Squad, with Morbius the Living Vampire, Werewolf by Night and Man-Thing, into combat.
    -   The one and only Frankenstein's Monster is also part of the Marvel Universe, even getting his own book, and his creator's descendants have created several more.
    -   The monster features as a member of STAKE, a.k.a. the Howling Commandos, SHIELD's team of monstrous operatives.
    -   _Wolverine and the X-Men (Marvel Comics)_ features the alleged original monster, but instead of the usual misunderstood brute, he's bitter and revenge-driven, and has spent the last few decades tracking down Frankensteins to kill, along with the help of a Satanic witch and a Circus of Fear.
-   _Fantastic Four: True Story_, in which Marvel's first family was trying to save the world of fiction from Nightmare, featured the monster from the original book as one of their allies. Later, when the team had been stripped of their powers and attacked by Dracula, Ben was trying to summon him for help.
    
    **Ben Grimm**: Actually, It's not so hard to imagine Frankenstein fighting Dracula.  
    _\[Doctor Frankenstein enters the room\]_  
    **Frankenstein**: Dear God, what are these monstrosities? Probably nothing _I_ can deal with.  
    **Ben**: Oops, my mistake. I mean Frankenstein's **monster** fighting Dracula.
    
-   There is a comparison between the monster and Marv from _Sin City_. Both hulking near indestructible abominations who go to extreme lengths for love, and were 'created' in a sense.
-   Len Wein's _Spawn of Frankenstein_ feature that ran as a back-up feature in _The Phantom Stranger_ starred an interpretation of the Frankenstein monster who was faithful to the monster's depiction in Mary Shelley's original novel and took his creator's name as his own by dubbing himself Victor Frankenstein II.
-   Pvt. Elliot "Lucky" Taylor of the _Creature Commandos_ in The DCU. Lucky barely survived stepping on a mine. He was stitched back together against his will, so he resembles the Frankenstein monster and has damaged vocal cords.
-   In _Jingle Belle: Santa Claus VS. Frankenstein,_ it turns out the monster's plan of lighting a funeral pyre for himself at the North Pole only resulted in _melting the ice_ and getting himself frozen in it. He's later de-thawed by the heroine, and brought to help out at Santa's toy factory. Hijinks ensue.
-   TOPPS Comics came out with _The Frankenstein/Dracula War_ miniseries, which is not so much a "war" as it is a setup for Dracula and the Monster to beat the crap out of each other after the deaths of their respective lady loves. Notable for the Monster having a female companion who is not afraid of him, and who keeps the relationship platonic due to personal trauma rather than the fact that he's ugly.
-   _Zombo_: Zombo, kinda. He was specifically designed as a one-of-his-kind experiment to create a zombie that would obey human commands. He's far friendlier than the regular bunch, since he'll at least ask you if he can eat your brains.
-   _Requiem Vampire Knight_: Deucalion is a Kaiju-sized living weapon created by Dr. Dippel to assassinate King Dracula. It was deliberately designed with Mary Shelley's book in mind, but its later revealed in a Stable Time Loop twist that Shelley saw Deucalion in a future vision granted by drinking black opium and this served as inspiration for the Frankenstein's monster, meaning that Deucalion inadvertently owns his existence to himself.
-   In "The Frontier Frankenstein" in _Tomahawk_ #103, British troops capture Big Anvil and a German scientist subjects him to a treatment involving "rare African herbs" which causes him to transform into a hulking green-skinned Frankenstein monster at night. The narration suggests this event might have been Mary Shelley's inspiration to write the novel _Frankenstein_.
-   In _Monster War_, the Frankenstein's monster is thawed out of ice and joins Mr. Hyde's alliance to unleash Hell on Earth. However, he is the least malevolent of his allies since all he wants is find a way to end his existence. At the end he is the only one to survive and said to have suffered the worst fate of all - he lived.
-   In _Silverblade_, Jonathan played the Frankenstein Monster on screen, and assumes its form during his Shapeshifter Showdown with Blackfeather: using its strength to break the grip of Blackfeather's alligator form, before being driven back by flames when Blackfeather transforms into a firebird.
-   _Dial H for Hero_:
    -   The 162nd issue of _House of Mystery_ had a story where Robby Reed used the superheroes the H-Dial turned him into to combat citizens of Littleville who have transformed into monsters. One of them was a man named Mr. Brody who turned into a Frankenstein monster.
    -   Issue 165 of _House of Mystery_ had a scientist named Dr. Rigoro Mortis try to defeat Robby's superhero forms with a robot he called Super-Hood, who had the appearance of a tall brute with stitching on his forehead.
-   The tenth issue of _Justice League Adventures_ has a villain called Screamthief conjure illusions of everyone's worst fears. One of the illusions she makes after tormenting a boy who's watched one too many horror films has the appearance of Frankenstein's monster.

    Fan Works 

-   In the _Pony POV Series_, Chrysalis is one long shout out, with her Origins Episode even beginning with a quote from the original book. Chrysalis was created when Pandora, the Spirit of Imagination, found the remains of Cadence's original body (her soul having left to live a mortal life after being defeated at the dawn of time by Twilight's Alicorn while attempting to destroy magic in a misguided attempt to help mortals), and proceeded to reanimate it with her own power. Chrysalis' corpse-like appearance is due to having _been_ a corpse. Chrysalis becomes aware of her existence as this trope and loathes both herself and her creator for it.

    Films — Animated 

-   Tim Burton's 1984 short film _Frankenweenie_ (and Frankenweenie the 2012 feature-length remake) is about a young boy who revives his beloved dog.
-   Sally in _The Nightmare Before Christmas_ is a ragdoll version of this trope (she's filled with leaves rather than guts), and can detach and reattach her limbs at will.
-   _Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein_ has a Universal Studios-style theme park hire Dr. Frankenstein to up the scare factor in their horror show, not realizing that he's brought real body parts to decorate. He immediately creates the monster, which breaks loose and runs away. He scares the Chipmunks at first, but then Theodore realizes he wasn't attacking and teaches him to be a good friend. Once they convince everyone else and teach him to talk, he's given a job at the park, and we last see him happily driving a tour trolley.
-   Frank and his wife Eunice in _Hotel Transylvania_ are the Frankenstein monster and his bride interpeted as a bickering married couple. Johnathan, the only human in the hotel, disguises himself as "Johnnystein", Frank's long lost cousin.
-   _Igor_ has the title character create a giant female Frankenstein monster named Eva to terrorize people. Unfortunately for him, she turns out to be a Gentle Giant who wants to be an actress.
-   The Monster makes a cameo in _Yellow Submarine_, inside one of the rooms in the Beatles' mansion. It wakes up, takes a potion and turns into John, who claims to have had the strangest dream.
-   Among the central characters of the classic 1960's Rankin-Bass stop-motion feature _Mad Monster Party?_ are Baron von Frankenstein, his Monster and the Monster's Mate (an interpretation of the Bride modeled after her voice actress Phyllis Diller). The portrayal is very much based on the earlier movie versions. There was also a prequel of sorts titled _Mad, Mad, Mad Monsters_, which centered around the creation of the Monster's bride (looking and sounding different from her depiction in the previous film) and their eventual marriage, the ending showing the couple with a Frankenstein monster baby in a carriage.
-   One of the main characters of _Monster Mash (2000)_ was the Frankenstein monster, who is named Frank.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The first film adaptation was the 1910 silent short-film (16 minutes) Frankenstein (1910)
-   The 1931 original (Number 27 on Bravo's _100 Scariest Movie Moments_) is the Trope Codifier. The monster goes on to appear in a series of franchise sequels, including three films of its own and four featuring other Universal monster properties. Four different actors would portray the monster for Universal.
-   The monster encountered none other than Abbott and Costello in, well, _Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein_ (1948). (It's also a Monster Mash with Dracula, The Wolf Man, and others showing up.)
-   The 1987 Universal homage/pastiche film _The Monster Squad_ features a Gentle Giant version of the monster who is forced into the role of an Evil Minion, befriends a five-year-old girl, and does a Heel–Face Turn. This might be an homage to Paul Wegener's _The Golem_ in which the titular clay being befriends a little girl who, soon afterwards, accidentally kills him by removing the magic star from his chest.
-   _Young Frankenstein_ spoofs the Universal films and the monster has his head attached with zippers instead of bolts. It _also_ pulls a Subverted Trope on the mythos because it's one of the only tellings where Frankenstein...or rather, "Fronk-en-steen" comes to realize he alone needs to take responsibility for his creation, guiding and protecting him. Therefore, it's also one of the only tellings that has a happy ending.
-   _Van Helsing_ featured Frankenstein's creature as a mixture of the 1930s Karloff version (his appearance, except with more mechanical parts) and Shelley's far more eloquent creation. He was also a sympathetic Gentle Giant created as part of Dracula's Evil Plan to resurrect his born-dead vampire children. What's more, he's just called "the monster" or "the creature" except for one moment where Van Helsing directly addresses him by the name Frankenstein.
-   The title character in _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_ is a Charles Atlas-ified version of this.
-   The Kaiju film _Frankenstein Conquers the World_ has the immortal heart of Frankenstein's monster get caught in the bombing of Hiroshima, growing first into a child-like body with the familiar forehead before becoming a massive giant in a caveman-ish outfit that fights the firebreathing dinosaur monster Baragon. Its sequel, _War of the Gargantuas,_ has the title monsters growing from pieces left behind in the forest and in the sea, resulting in the kaiju equivalent of Cain and Abel.
-   _Saturn 3_ transports the whole premise of this into space with Hector, who looks and acts like the creature right down to the mad handler and mute pursuit of the Satellite Love Interest.
-   The title character of the horror film _May_, after getting picked on and rejected one too many times, comes to the conclusion that nobody is perfect — only parts of them are. So she decides to build a "perfect friend" by killing people (mostly her friends and co-workers) and taking the parts of their bodies that she finds to be "perfect." She names her creation Amy, and she really does come to life at the end - unless one interprets it as being all in May's head.
-   Kenneth Branagh directed and starred in _Mary Shelley's Frankenstein_ in 1994, featuring Robert De Niro, of all people, as the monster.
-   _Frankenstein Unbound_ is a 1990 movie directed by Roger Corman - and is pretty decent, in an episode-of- _The Twilight Zone_ -kind of way. The premise is that Shelley's book was an account of real events that took place ... mostly ... but with the added bonus of a weapons scientist from 20 Minutes into the Future appearing in the story, whose story arc parallels that of Frankenstein himself.
-   The killer in the Slasher Movie _The Funhouse_ dresses as The Monster to hide his deformed features.
-   The 1985 movie _The Bride_ is a spinoff starring Sting... yeah the one from The Police... and Jennifer Beals as Charles Frankenstein and a female creature named Eva respectively. Clancy Brown plays the original creature, eventually named Victor. The name shuffle is deliberate and significant.
-   _Carry On Screaming!_ includes a pair of Frankenstein's monster style creatures who do the bidding of the resident Mad Scientist.
-   The horror films _Pieces_ and _Resurrection_ involve characters attempting to imbue life into a mish-mash of body parts they've collected and crudely fused together.
-   _The Curse of Frankenstein_, a 1957 Hammer Horror adaptation, starring Peter Cushing as Frankenstein and Christopher Lee as the monster. Here the monster has only a minor role and the film focuses primarily on the doctor. A sprawling series of sequels emerged, but the original monster appears in none of them (though Frankenstein is always cobbling something together).
-   Frankenstein's Monster is one of the eight wrestlers in _Monster Brawl_.
-   _Flesh for Frankenstein_ is different in that it mostly focuses on Dr. Frankenstein as opposed to the monster. Or in this case, the monsters.
-   _Edward Scissorhands_ is a man-made creation, left lacking hands because his creator died before finishing him, hence the scissorhands of the title.
-   _X-Men: First Class_: Erik Lehnsherr invokes this when a Nazi in hiding asks him What the Hell Are You?
    
    **Erik**: Let's just say I'm Frankenstein's Monster, and I'm looking for my creator.
    
-   _I, Frankenstein_ has an intelligent and cynical Adam caught up in a war between demons and divinely created gargoyles. In the same irony that the Trope Namer of I Am Not Shazam has changed his name to Shazam, Adam takes the name "Frankenstein" in the end via Title Drop.
-   Crosses over with Artificial Zombie in the movie _Frankenstein's Army_. The monsters are undead cyborg super soldiers cooked up by the original Dr. Frankenstein's grandson.
-   In _Frankenstein 1970_, Victor von Frankenstein is attempting to revivify his ancestor's original creature (with a few improvements of his own).
-   In _Lady Frankenstein_, the Baron has been working on his creation for years. It goes mad, kills him, and escapes. Tanya does not create a typical Frankenstein's monster, but instead transplants the brain of her lover into a physically perfect body.
-   Shrike the undead Super-Soldier from _Mortal Engines_. The Stalkers are regarded with abhorrence by Tom as some kind of Mad Science Unseen Evil from the ancient world. Yet like the original monster Shrike has a gentle side that causes him to protect Hester as a little girl. Also he wants to create a companion like himself, though in this case a child, not a bride.
-   In _Frankenstein's Castle of Freaks_, Count Frankenstein reanimates a Neanderthal man (It Makes Just As Much Sense In Context) to serve as his monster. He christens his creation 'Goliath'.
-   The main antagonists of the first half of _Army of Frankensteins_ are a horde of Frankenstein's Monsters from various dimensions, all dropped in the middle of the American Civil War. They're eventually calmed down and turned against the real villains, the Confederacy.
-   _Monster Mash (1995)_, being partially based on the Bobby "Boris" Pickett song of the same name, featured the Frankenstein monster.
-   In _Frankenstein Island_, Dr. Frankenstein's original monster is still alive but has become uncontrollable, so it has been chained to a rock at the bottom of a pool in a cave. At the end of the movie, the spirit of Dr. Frankenstein unleashes it to wreak havoc.
-   The Frankenstein Monster is one of the monsters who infiltrates the costume party and spikes the punch in _House on Bare Mountain_.
-   In _Kiss Me Quick!_, one of Dr. Breedlove's creations started life as Fanny Stein, but due to a mistake in the creation process, is now Frankie Stein and looks exactly like the Frankenstein monster.
-   Invoked in _Saving Private Ryan._ One of the guesses about Cpt. Miller's Multiple-Choice Past is that he was "assembled at OCS outta dead GI's."
-   _The Creeps_: One of the four monsters that Dr. Berber brings to life with his "Archetype Inducer" is a 3-foot-tall Frankenstein's monster.
-   _Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith_ makes Darth Vader into a Frankensteinian analogue. Back when he was still Anakin, Palpatine told him about a Sith Lord whose influence over the Force was strong enough to spontaneously create life. With Anakin's origins being established as an immaculate conception, it's strongly implied he was a result of these experiments. Between the Jedi Order increasingly alienating Anakin and his personal angst, he's gradually driven towards villainy. After being horribly injured and left for dead, the Emperor salvages Darth Vader's body and uses what's implied to be unorthodox medical practises to restore Vader, albeit as an imposing cyborg.
-   _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_ Lex Luthor gets ahold of General Zod's corpse and uses the fertility chamber in the grounded Kryptonian spacecraft to not only reanimate the corpse, but also to enhance it into something stronger, albeit far more monstruous. The ship's A.I. even warns Luthor that using science for such purposes was deemed unethical by Krypton's governing body.

    Gamebooks 

-   One of the _Horror Classic Gamebooks_ has you being either Dr. Frankenstein or the Monster.

    Literature 

-   The Trope Namer and Maker: Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_.
-   David Bischoff's novel _Mandala_ featured similar constructs known as "helter-skelters." They differ in being quite articulate, no bigger than the human average, and in being an odd mix of buffoonery and pathos.
-   Subverted in Dean Koontz's _Frankenstein_ novels, in that both the creature and Dr. Frankenstein have survived to modern times. Both characters have lived all over in the interim and taken new names; the creature calls himself _Deucalion_, while the Doctor is now known as Doctor Helios. In addition, Dr. Helios spent the intervening time figuring out what went 'wrong' with his first creation and has decided to replace all of humanity with his custom-designed 'much-better models'. Deucalion has decided to oppose him, aided by a pair of local police detectives. The only signature feature that Koontz has added to all of the synthetic beings he has made (back to and including the original) is the presence of two hearts.
    -   Deucalion has become The Atoner, while Victor is a monster himself. This reversal of roles is lampshaded.
    -   Note the name; Deucalion was the son of Prometheus (a nod to "Modern Prometheus", the original story's subtitle). Near the end of the series someone recommends he change it to Christopher, after the Gentle Giant St. Christopher.
-   _Constance Verity Saves the World_: Not only is Frankenstein's Monster real, but Connie cried as he died in her arms in her early twenties.
-   Fred Saberhagen's novel _The Frankenstein Papers_ reveals that Frankenstein's monster was actually an alien observer who was curious about the deranged doctor's efforts, and who suffered traumatic amnesia after being shocked by the doctor's equipment while investigating the rotting patchwork Frankenstein had assembled; after destroying the original creation while convulsing, the alien passed out on the workbench and was mistaken for the newly-revived construct by the literally-mad doctor. Having no other memory, the alien accepted Frankenstein's explanation of his origins.
-   In _The Edge Chronicles_ "Curse of the Gloamglozer", the titular monster is revealed to be one: an unfortunately successful attempt at creating life from primal life particles.
-   In _President's Vampire_ the Frankenstein's Monster was Johann Konrad's (based on the real life inspiration for Shelley's work) first attempt at creating what would eventually become _Unmanschensoldaten_ — restless monsters brought back to life by The Dark Arts with a singular purpose given to them by their creator and slaughtering everything that would stand in their way.
-   In _Frankensteins faster_ ("The Aunt of Frankenstein") and its sequel by Allan Rune Pettersson, the aunt of Dr Victor Frankenstein takes up residence in his old castle, determined to get rid of the shame that silly boy has attached to the family name. Her plans end up including resurrecting the Monster, but in a way that won't cause a scandal. This young adult novel is, as you can understand, an Affectionate Parody of old Universal Horror movies, including Monster Mash — both Count Dracula and Larry Talbot play a role.
-   _Discworld_:
    -   Scraps, Igor's "mixed-breed" terrier in _Carpe Jugulum_ is a Frankenstein's Dog.
    -   Also alluded to in _Thief of Time_, when Jeremy Clockson comments that some people really come alive in thunderstorms, and Igor replies "Ah, that wath when I worked for Baron Finklethtein."
-   Adam from _Invisible Werewolf Dracula Meets Vampire Mummy Frankenstein_. Even though the story is a Monster Mash, he takes more after the original novel than from any movie adaptation: moody, biblical, definitely not lumbering.
-   Chopfyt in _The Tin Woodman of Oz_ is arguably a Frankenstein's Monster, being constructed from the detached human bits of both the title character and the Tin Soldier.
-   Camus "Cam" Comprix from _Unwind_ is a "Rewind": the first person in a series about fugitive teenagers being walking transplants to be made entirely out of parts of other teens.
-   _Mister Creecher_ by Chris Priestly takes place while the Creature is following Victor all over England, making sure Victor upholds his promise to create a bride. Along the way he befriends a street urchin, who misinterprets the word "creature" as the titular surname.
-   _Frankenstein's Monster: A Novel_ by Susan Heyboer O'Keefe is but one unofficial sequel to the novel. The story is told through the Creature's POV, with Walton as the main antagonist.
-   _Monster Hunter International_ has Agent Franks, who is _the_ inspiration for the Trope Namer and Trope Maker and actually met Mary Shelley. He disagrees with some of the novel's things though, saying it makes him sound like a whiner and emo. Although technically, he's a Fallen Angel who took over that body for himself when he found it empty, and he pissed off several of his brethren who wanted it for themselves.
-   _Old Man's War_: The Special Forces soldiers are genetically engineered to be soldiers from birth, and are used to handle the missions that the regular Colonial Defense Forces troops can't or won't take on. The Special Forces see themselves as a modern day Frankenstein's Monster, and more than a few of them harbor a hatred of the CDF for creating them as such.
-   _Vic and Frank: Necromancers_: The Reanimated Woman is an example of this as, unlike Vic and Frank's first subject, she is made up of other bodies stitched together. Her memories and consciousness seem to be that of her "head and brain" donor.
-   Takeshi Kovacs' homeworld has a folk tale called the "Patchwork Man" that parents use to scare their kids into obedience. The basics is that a witch killed her three lazy sons and stitched their parts together into one big carcass that she summoned a Tengu into. Eventually the tengu rebelled and killed her, but was left trapped in the patchwork body and started wandering the planet, looking for more stray children to replace the parts that rot off. Kovacs compares some characters who resleeve so frequently that they lose their self-image to the folk tale.
-   In _Twig_, it is heavily implied that, rather than write _Frankenstein_ in 1818, Mary Shelley instead invented an actual Frankenstein's Monster. A century later, reanimated corpses known as "Stitched" are commonly used as laborers, domestic help, and soldiers, and Gordon, one of the protagonists, is a Mix-and-Match Man based on the concept.
-   One of the members of the titular group in the _Extreme Monsters_ book series was a Frankenstein monster named Steiner.
-   In the first _Franny K. Stein_ book, _Lunch Walks Among Us_, Franny sews together a Lunch Meat Creature to combat the Pumpkin-Crab Monster. The Lunch Meat Creature was essentially a Frankenstein monster made of cold cuts.
-   _InCryptid_: Martin Baker is a Friendly Revenant Zombie made up of parts from 4 to 6 human corpses (even he's not sure how many).
-   _Monster: A Novel of Frankenstein_: Friedrich Hoffmann is reconstructed by Victor Frankenstein from the body parts of dead people, with his original brain in a new body.
-   _Monster of the Year_: One of the monsters taking part in the titular contest is a Frankenstein's Monster (and Michael McGraw, one of the lead judges, even discusses the name mentally when he first meets the monster face-to-face and is trying to figure out what to call him), who turns out to be named Sigmund Fred. He was created by "The Doctor", and was eventually taken in by Igor, the Doctor's hunchbacked assistant.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Frangen, a two-faced Frankenstein's Monster-themed Akuma Clan Captain, appears as the villain of an episode of _Akumaizer 3_.
-   _Big Bad Beetleborgs_: One of the monsters living in Hillhurst Mansion is a Frankenstein Captain Ersatz named "Frankenbeans". Like the other monsters in the mansion, he's bloodthirsty, but ultimately an Ineffectual Sympathetic Villain.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   Adam is a human/demon Mix-and-Match Man...and he's also a Cyborg, since he had machine and computer parts.
    -   There was also a one-shot version of this plot in "Some Assembly Required", with two high school students raising their dead friend as a "Monster"-like zombie, and then trying to assemble a partner for him out of female body parts.
-   _The Colbert Report_: Stephen Colbert once suspected that the Vatican was attempting to use the skin and blood of dead Popes to build a "Franken-pope".
-   The _Criminal Minds_ episode "There's No Place Like Home" features a lunatic who's convinced that he can bring his older brother back by making him a new body and exposing it to a tornado (the thing that killed his brother). _Frankenstein_ is brought up by Reid when they finally discern the motive.
-   The 1960s Gothic soap opera _Dark Shadows_ had a storyline in 1968 about a man-made monster named Adam, and was loosely based on _Frankenstein_. He was created by using the lifeforce of Vampire Barnabas Collins.
-   The _Doctor Who_ story "The Brain of Morbius" is a clear Homage. A robot version of the monster also appears in one episode of "The Chase".
-   _Fantasy Island_: Anne Frankenstein appeared in one episode.
-   British series _The Frankenstein Chronicles_ with Sean Bean takes the Frankenstein myth into a police drama: A police inspector is investigating a series of murders apparently made in order to collect human body parts to recreate a creature.
-   There's the unusually-named 1970's made-for-TV movie _Frankenstein: The True Story_, which features a very handsome Creature who is beloved by Victor, only for their relationship to disintegrate as the Creature's good looks begin to decay. As you can expect, contains varying amounts of Ho Yay and camp.
-   The Mountain in _Game of Thrones_ has been compared to this as after almost dying in the duel against the Viper, he is taken by Qyburn (a rogue maester suspected of performing necromancy and black arts) and is experimented upon. Qyburn turns him in some sort of zombie-like, red-eyed, giant, hulking, speechless monster with greenish skin that lumbers about killing people on Cersei's orders and eventually kills its creator. The fandom gives him the nickname Frankenmountain.
-   Both the good doctor and his creation turned up as ghosts in _The Ghost Busters_; there, Dr. Frankenstein tried to make his idiotic monster obedient by giving it "the brain of the world's most gullible fool." And guess what? Ghostbuster Spenser fits the bill quite nicely...
-   In 2004, Hallmark Channel (of all channels) produced a faithful, if dull, miniseries adaptation of the novel, starring Luke Goss as the Creature.
-   The Canadian made children's series _The Hilarious House of Frightenstein_ had the Frankenstein's Monster-like Brucie. Dracula\-Expy, Count Frightenstein took the Dr. Frankenstein role, trying to make Brucie live again so he could return to Transylvania.
-   _Kamen Rider Kiva_ has Dogga/Riki, the Last of His Kind of an entire race of Frankenstein's Monster-like beings with immense strength who feed on human souls. Thanks to a pact with the hero's father, he can loan his power to Kiva, turning Wataru into a Mighty Glacier who grunts rather than speaking, swings a giant hammer, and has a lightning theme (matching up with the method of the Monster's creation).
-   _The Librarians (2014)_: The monster is magically conjured from the original book. Ezekiel attempts to scare him off with fire, before the others explain to him that this version was conjured from the book and the fear of fire was added in the movie. The heroes are able to end his rampage when they inform him that modern plastic surgery could probably make him look perfectly normal.
-   _Li'l Horrors_ has Duncan Stein, based on Frankenstein's monster from the 1931 film _Frankenstein_. Gluttonous yet friendly, and yet also dim-witted and sorely lacking in social skills.
-   _MA Dtv 1995_ has a series of sketches featuring 'Funkenstein' in parodies of Blaxploitation films.
-   _The Munsters_ featured a Gentle Giant version as a Bumbling Dad.
-   The Monster of the Week in the _My Babysitter's a Vampire_ episode "Jockenstein" is an obvious Homage to Frankenstein's Monster.
-   Dr. Frankenstein and his creation have appeared on _Once Upon a Time_.
-   _Penny Dreadful_ features both Dr. Victor Frankenstein and his Creature, who within the series is named by his theatrical employer as "Caliban", and later adopts the name "John Clare" after the poet. Despite differences in the story, the characterisation and physical appearance of Caliban, played by Rory Kinnear, are among the closest of any adaptation to those of the Creature in the original novel. Even the yellow eyes are included, although they are interpreted as golden-yellow irises instead of jaundiced whites.
-   In the _Red Dwarf_ episode "Quarantine", Cat calls Kryten "Frankenstein", which leads the latter to point out the following:
    
    **Kryten:** Frankenstein was the _creator_, not the monster. It's a common misconception held by all truly stupid people.
    
-   _Saturday Night Live_:
    -   Phil Hartman played the monster regularly during his tenure, featuring it in contexts as varying as game shows and Christmas carol sing-a-longs. He generally only communicated with grunts except for the phrase "Fire bad!"
    -   One sketch had Helen Mirren playing Mary Shelley, and Fred Armisen playing her building's superintendent "Frank Stein" who was quite obviously the inspiration for the monster.
    -   In another sketch entitled "Firelight" (that also parodied _The Twilight Saga_), Taylor Swift plays the female protagonist who falls in love with a Frankenstein Monster who's prone to strangling peope to death (accidentally).
-   _Super Sentai_/_Power Rangers_:
    -   The Frankenstein Monster is the Monster of the Week in the first Halloween Episode of _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_. Funnily enough, due to how the source material was adapted (the original 'Monster' was the first form of a monster from the original _Zyuranger_ whose later forms would be adapted into completely different monsters in future episodes), the throwaway reference gives the Rangers and their Zords one of their toughest fights in Season 1. The monster also has the odd distinction of being one of the few Monsters of the Week in either _Power Rangers_ or _Super Sentai_ to be played by a person in makeup rather than a rubber monster suit.
    -   In _Mahou Sentai Magiranger_, the Big Bad employed several Dragons inspired by classic horror monsters throughout the series run. The first one is called Branken and is inspired by Frankenstein's monster. But instead of a lumbering Gentle Giant Tortured Monster, he is a short-tempered demonic cyborg bent on conquering the surface world.
    -   Frankenstein's Monster also appears in _Shuriken Sentai Ninninger_ as one of the "Western Youkai", alongside his fellow classic horror monsters Wolf Man and Dracula.
-   _Supernatural_: The Styne Family from late Season 10 are revealed to be the House of Frankenstein, who are responsible for numerous wars and events throughout history (9/11, for example). They gave shelter to Mary Shelley a couple of centuries before, and she witnessed their use of Black Magic to restore their bodies, giving her the inspiration to write the original novel, and thus forcing them to change their name to "Styne". The American branch of the Styne Family is wiped out easily by Dean Winchester, who goes on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge after they killed Charlie, and is under the influence of the Mark of Cain.
-   In the _Weird Science_ episode, "In Search of Boris Karloff," Lisa takes Wyatt and Gary into the world of Frankenstein. In this version, the Creature (specifically referred to as _not_ Frankenstein himself) lives with his creator. He is portrayed as quite dimwitted and prone to anger (the latter a result of constantly being mistreated), but he is a Gentle Giant to Lisa, as she showed him nothing but kindness.
-   _The X-Files_: The episode "The Post-Modern Prometheus" is a parody right down to its title, which is a reference to the original book's subtitle.

    Music 

-   The definitive Frankensteinian pop song was, is, and will remain, Bobby "Boris" Pickett & the Crypt-Kickers immortal _Monster Mash_, the very premise of the song being a Mad Scientist describing his monster coming to life and creating a dance that proves very popular.
-   Edgar Winter's instrumental classic, "Frankenstein", got its name because it was created by splicing pieces of tapes together from a longer jam session, much like the titular monster was created by stitching parts of multiple bodies together.
-   The Insane Clown Posse song _Mad Professor_ features Violent J creating Shaggy this way because he is lonely.
-   There is a guy made up as Frankenstein's Monster in David Lee Roth's "Just a Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody" video.
-   The musician _Richard Campbell_ made a Rock Opera album titled "Frankenstein" which tells the original story in song form.
-   The Vocaloid characters Big Al and Sweet Ann are based on this trope.
-   Alterbeast's "Mutilated Marvel" is about the creation of one of these.
-   In Super Planet Dolan's dark version of Hickory Dickory Dock, there was a segment depicting Danger Dolan dressed as a mad scientist (presumably as Dr. Frankenstein) using the clock to successfully revive Frankenstein's Monster, although with mismatched body parts.

    Newspaper Comics 

-   Abra Cadaver from _The Wizard of Id_ is a Frankenstein monster created by the titular wizard.
-   _Bizarro_ for October 27, 2012. The monster is trapped by a mob carrying Torches and Pitchforks, but they burst into derisive laughter when they see he's wearing a Hawaiian shirt and shorts.
-   A number of _The Far Side_ cartoons feature the creature, usually alongside a Mad Scientist and The Igor.
    
    -   One strip has the monster get into a heated argument with Igor in the middle of a diner, to the embarrassment of the doctor.
    
    "Oh, yeah! Well, I'd rather be a living corpse made from dismembered body parts than a hunchbacked little grave robber like you!"
    
    -   In another, he literally stands on his head in an attempt to get his creator's attention.
-   _Scary Gary_ features a gay Frankenstein monster couple named Frank and Steve as recurring characters.

    Pinball 

-   Not only is the Monster is the lead keyboard player for the band in _Monster Bash_, but awakening him from the slab is a requisite for getting the band back together.
    
    _"It's ALIVE!"_
    
-   In _Elvira and the Party Monsters ,_ he's one of the guests at Elvira's midnight barbecue.

    Podcast 

-   The Drunk and The Ugly: In _Mrs. Frieda's_, one of the kid's monsters is a Frankenstein's monster with hammers for hands. Aptly named Hammerstein.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   The dying days of the old Los Angeles territory featured a Frankenstein's Monster gimmick called "The Monster."
    -   In Memphis, Eddie Marlin did the gimmick under the name "Frankenstein."
-   The October 26, 1998 issue of _New York Magazine_ contained an article about Vince McMahon and the then-WWF which described The Undertaker as "the WWF's gothic, Frankensteinian wrestler."
-   Killer Khan was managed by Mr. Fuji during his final WWE run, in 1987. During his Squash of Rick Hunter on the May 16 (taped April 23), 1987, _WWF Superstars_, there was an inset promo from his stablemates Don Muraco and "Cowboy" Bob Orton Jr., in which Muraco said, "The evil genius of Mr. Fuji has reincarnated the monster of Frankenstein himself."

    Tabletop Games 

-   White Wolf:
    -   _Exalted_: The Liminal Exalted, or Chernozem, are dead bodies given new life — sometimes patchwork constructs, sometimes intact corpses — through the intercession of a mysterious entity called the Dark Mother. Unlike true undead but like Frankenstein's creation, they're entirely new souls with little memory of or connection to the lives of the corpses that gave them form.
    -   _New World of Darkness_:
        -   "Antagonists" has the imbued. Like the Prometheans, they're artificial lifeforms made from corpses, but they lack a soul or indeed any capacity to become human.
        -   _Werewolf: The Forsaken_: _Tribes of the Moon_ tells the tale of a pack of World War II-era American werewolves who stumbled across a Nazi project to create Frankensteins.
        -   _Promethean: The Created_: Artificial lifeforms (typically made from corpses) are called Prometheans, after the Titan who gave mankind the gift of fire; their goal, and thus the player's, is To Become Human — a possible (but exceedingly hard) task, thanks to the Divine Fire that animates them. One Lineage is called the Frankensteins, and in first edition, the first of their number is explicitly identified as Victor Frankenstein's monster (aka. Adam Frankenstein, aka. the first edition corebook's narrator "Mr. Verney"), which still exists in this world. (_Dark Eras Companion_, written for the second edition games, has Mary Shelley and John Polidori as the first Frankenstein's creators instead.) This is all derived straight from the original novel, to boot — the alternate title to Shelley's classic is _The Modern Prometheus_.
    -   _Old World of Darkness_:
        -   _Mage: The Ascension_: In the original Sons of Ether splatbook, the inspiration for the novel was an Etherite mage called Waldman and his creation (again from the original book, where Waldman inspired Victor Frankenstein). The creation took the name Elias Waldman, and became a mage, joining the Etherites; he apparently lives to this day. He isn't the only one, either; one of the splatbook's character templates is a modern-day construct. In the Revised Storytellers' Handbook, the early 19th century sees quite a few scientific mages create their own humanoid constructs, which become known as Prometheans. While they're playable, they can't become mages, unlike the splatbook.
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_: Flesh Golems are physically patterned after Frankenstein's monster, but are entirely mindless and thus share little else with it or this trope. A closer fit would be the Blasphemes, stitched together undead with full sapience.
    -   In _Ravenloft_ making _any_ golem is a bad idea — but making these is easier and mad scientists do, frequently out of desperation. The monster Adam is a very close copy of the concept, drawing more upon Shelley than movies. However, the monster is here explained as a case of its creator having been punished by the gods for seeking to create life, and as such the creature was Always Chaotic Evil, despite its vigorous claims to the contrary.
    -   _Masque of the Red Death_: The actual monster of Frankenstein is used as one of many villains.
-   Flesh Golems in _Pathfinder_ are usually mindless, like in D&D, but on rare occasions they can become "awakened" to true sentience. One such awakened golem, The Beast of Lepidstadt, is the focus of _Trial of the Beast_, the second adventure in the _Carrion Crown_ adventure path. He has been captured and put on trial for a number of heinous crimes, and the PCs are recruited to investigate his guilt or innocence. He's innocent; the Beast is a benevolent creature being used as a scapegoat by the actual perpetrators. He even pulls a Big Damn Heroes at the end, showing up to help the characters fight a far more monstrous example of this trope.
-   _Don't Rest Your Head_: A throwaway line in the corebook indicates that the original has become one of the Nightmares.
-   In _Halt Evil Doer!_, Frankenstein's Monster serves as a Public Domain Character Captain Ersatz of the Hulk ... with Victor as a sort of evil Bruce Banner.
-   Cryxian Stitch Thralls from the Iron Kingdoms.
-   _Warhammer_:
    -   _Blood Bowl_: Necromantic Horror Undead teams have Flesh Golems. Fulfilling the role of Blocker, Flesh Golems are undead creatures created from the stitched body parts of various corpses and share the traditional Frankenstein’s Monster appearance. The most famous Flesh Golem to have played the game was the Star Player Frank N. Stein, who was unfortunately killed during an incident involving a werewolf and a mob armed with torches and pitchforks.
    -   _Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay_: Necromancers displeased by what can be done with unaltered humans corpses occasionally stitch together and animated immense Frankensteinian monstrosities, referred to as Patchwork Men.
    -   The Exiled Dead warband from _Warhammer Underworlds_ consists primarily of a vampire Mad Scientist and his "Arcwalkers" - zombies animated by a pseudo-electrical force. One of them has a giant arm stitched to his shoulder to give a Frankenstein vibe.

    Theatre 

-   The first Frankenstein stage adaptation was _Presumption, or The Fate Of Frankenstein_ by Richard Brinsley Peake, first performed in 1823, only five years after the novel. Notably, this play began the tradition in adaptations of playing the Creature as mute and of limited intellect, and in Frankenstein's comic servant Fritz produced the first proto-example of The Igor.
-   Frankenstein has been adapted into an Off-Broadway musical.
-   There is a straight play called _After Frankenstein_ that tells of the confrontation between the creator and the monster in the Arctic.
-   "Frankenstein" was presented by The National Theatre, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller, the leads alternating the roles of Frankenstein and "The Creature" nightly. Both versions were presented in live simulcasts to movie theaters.
-   There is also a musical adaptation of _Young Frankenstein_.
-   Kim Newman's one-act play _Frankenstein on Ice_ has a group of morally-questionable modern scientists discovering a Whale-Karloff-style Monster as a Human Popsicle in the Arctic but he turns out to be a Shelley-style Creature engaging in Obfuscating Stupidity.

    Theme Parks 

-   Busch Gardens' Howl-O-Scream event has an annual show called _Fiends_, which features a much raunchier take on Dr. Frankenstein (here called "Dr. Freakenstein") and his attempts to bring his monster to life.
-   Halloween Horror Nights had a house in 2009 that had Dr. Frankenstein making more experiments while also facing the Monster who wants him to make him pay for the pain and suffering he had to endure.

    Toys 

-   Frankie Stein is the daughter of Frankenstein's Monster and his Bride in Mattel's franchise, Monster High.
-   Mundy Drudge from _Teddy Scares_ fits a lot of the usual tropes of the Frankenstein monster. He has green fur, his face is held together with staples and his revised backstory established that he was put together and brought to life by Hester Golem.
-   There was a Playskool toy called Big Frank, a talking Frankenstein monster toy that would bellow to be fixed and whose coat would open to reveal his heart and inner workings while the head would serve as a toolbox.
-   The Frankenstein monster was one of the many iconic monsters that was represented in the _Monster in My Pocket_ line of figurines.

    Video Games 

-   Arisen from _Allods Online_. Corpses reanimated by inserting cyborg implants in them (their arms from slightly above the elbows down to the hands, their legs from slightly above their knees down to the feet and possibly the head too since they use a mask (and there must be a way to carry their soul in a dead corpse, as they have presumably still have the soul of the person the corpse belonged to). These aren't outright evil (apart from the Tep), as they basically have human souls, but on dead + cyborg bodies.
-   In _Arcanum: Of Steamworks & Magick Obscura_, two possible character backgrounds are "Frankenstein's Monster" and "Bride of Frankenstein". With both backgrounds, you can take more damage than normal people, have a dexterity penalty, and talk in Hulk Speak. The difference between the backgrounds is that the male version gives you a bonus to strength and the female version gives you a bonus to beauty.
-   In _Battle Monsters_, Deathmask is the resident Frankenstein's monster (though in-game his monster type is a Golem). Taller than most of the other fighters, he's a Mighty Glacier who's a clumsy brawler with some bar-fight grappler elements and a super move where his kick shoots out an extremely powerful lightning bolt that'll go across the screen and take off about 90% of an opponent's health.
-   _Boogie Wings_ have a giant Frankenstein mech serving as a boss of the Koney Island Amusement Park stage.
-   Frankenstein is a recurring nemesis in the _Castlevania_ series, usually as a boss, but sometimes as a powerful mook. He possesses brute strength, often smashing the room to drop debris on you, and several times he often wields electricity based powers. Early games just call him Frankenstein, though later games consistently refer to him as 'The Creature' instead, to the point that his incarnation based on _Castlevania_ in _Castlevania: Harmony of Despair_ is called "R. The Creature" when every other enemy in the game had reverted to their name from the original game including Dracula being called "R. The Count."
    -   His first appearance in the first _Castlevania_ has no particular attacks, only lumbering back and fourth. The bigger threat is the invincible hunchback Igor (Before the whole mook species was identified as flea men, they were all called Igor.) who hops around and shoots fireballs.
    -   His incarnation from _Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin_ is noteworthy for not just being able to generate lightning, but also having a machine gun and rocket launcher in his arms.
    -   Amusingly, not only do most of the _Castlevania_ games with The Creature take place before the original _Frankenstein_ story took place, many of them predate the time when humans first thought to harness electricity.
-   _City of Heroes_ has an entire _enemy faction_ styled after Dr. Frankenstein and his creation — The Vahzilok, followers of the surgeon turned evil Mad Scientist, complete with butcher-like followers, horrifying technologically reanimated monsters made of corpses (the bigger ones are made with parts from fallen superheroes), and custom model leather-clad intelligent zombies with supernatural powers. And you fight these guys from level one...
-   In _Criminal Case: Supernatural Investigations_, the player encounters Adam Enstrom, the assistant of Case #9 victim Dr Lucrezia Stein, who created him from various body parts as one of the many sick experiments she performed on Blackmoor Asylum. Wanna guess who ended up killing her?
-   The arcade fighter _Daraku Tenshi_ has Taro, who resembles a short, stout Frankenstein's Monster in overalls.
-   Victor von Gerdenheim from _Darkstalkers_ is the monster with a different name and story, as well as the ability to generate electricity. Victor sets out to resurrect his creator's daughter Emily, and in the end does so by sacrificing his own life to "power" her. His name could be considered an inversion of the I Am Not Shazam issue the monster often faces.
-   _Dead Head Fred_: Private-eye Fred Neuman became a version of this, after he was murdered by gangster Ulysses Pitt. On of Pitt's employees, Dr. Friedrich Steiner revives his body and makes Fred into a removable Brain in a Jar that can swap out for new heads with different powers. While preferring to be alive, Fred has developed some serious rage issues over his undead state.
-   _Demon's World_ have Frankenstein's monsters as occasional enemies, among several other classic monsters.

-   _Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus_, full of horror homages, has the haunted house basement with an inanimate Frankenstein's Monster in the basement. You even have to animate it for sake of solving a puzzle, and do it the classic way by summoning a thunderstorm. Upon coming to life, however, the monster just kills you if you don't stop it in time.
-   _Everybody Edits_ has the Frankenstein Smiley added in the Halloween of 2011, along with the Ghost and Vampire.
-   In _Fable II_ the quest "Love Hurts" is an allusion to Victor Frankenstein, as the gravekeeper, Victor, is trying to bring Lady Grey back to life; this is further reinforced by the name of the dungeon in the proximity of the mansion. The name of the dungeon is "Shelley Crypt"; Mary Shelley was the author of Frankenstein.
-   The Super Mutants in the _Fallout_ series. In _Fallout 3_, Three Dog occasionally refers to them as "the Frankensteins". The Big Bad of _Fallout 2_, Frank Horrigan, is a Cyber Super Mutant.
-   _Final Fantasy_:
    -   In _Final Fantasy VII_, Vincent Valentine's second Limit Break Death Gigas transforms him into a form strongly resembling Frankenstein's monster, which fights with strong physical blows and a lightning-based attack.
    -   Three installments ago, _Final Fantasy IV_ had Barnabas, a towering Frankestein-esque creature created by the evil Dr. Lugae.
-   In _Frankenstein: The Monster Returns_, The main villain is the **creature** made by **human** doctor Victor Von Frankenstein, but, as with other pop culture depictions, his creator's name is used interchangeably with the creature.
-   _Frankenstein: Through The Eyes Of The Monster_, a first person adventure game that puts you in the shoes of the monster itself. The monster is established as having the brain of a brilliant doctor whom Frankenstein admired and who was hanged after being wrongfully accused of murdering his daughter. The game has you exploring Castle Frankenstein, learning about the Doctor's sinister activities, attempting to escape the castle, and- ultimately- recreating the doctor's process of creating life to resurrect your daughter, who was kidnapped and then killed by a bomb.
-   The Magician in the _House of the Dead_ series. In the third installment, Curien himself becomes one.
-   _Keith Courage in Alpha Zones_'s second boss, Stitch, is a Frankensteinian Cephalothorax.
-   In the _Kingdom Hearts_ series, whenever he is in Halloween Town, Goofy will take on an appearance similar to Frankenstein's Monster, including a screw coming out of his head. This fits the tune of popular monsters that the trio become, since in this world, Sora is a vampire and Donald is wrapped like a mummy.
-   A Frankenstein's Monster is the boss of the Dungeon level in _MadWorld_. Frank, as he's called, tends to be That One Boss — he's huge, can electrify himself, is a Lightning Bruiser, the ground level is covered in water, you have to manually unscrew five huge bolts in his back to beat him, the timing to pull that off is damn tricky, and he can heal himself repeatedly.
-   _Mega Man 7_: Junk Man might count. His body was constructed as a mishmash of robot parts, to the point where he has differently-coloured eyes.
-   Then there's the Amalgam from _Mega Man Revolution_, which looks like a mishmash of the Robot Masters. He even takes his moveset from the Robot Masters who are being copied by him, and changes his colour to signal his current weapon and weakness.
-   One of the playable characters in the Game Boy Advance game _Monster Force_ was a Frankenstein monster named Frank.
-   The Frankenstein monsters are an enemy in _Monster Hunter (PC)_, and the first enemy variant that needs two hits to kill. Specifically, they can be weakened by a flung torch, at which point they'll crawl back to their spawners to regenerate their health, and the player must damage it a second time before it reaches the spawner.
-   The monster is one of the two protagonists of the _Monster in My Pocket_ Licensed Game.
-   _Monster Sanctuary_ has the Prometheans. According to the Monster Journal, they're reanimated corpses created by a scientist named Victor. Their name is a reference to the alternate title of _Frankenstein_, _The Modern Prometheus_.
-   Two of the bosses in _Muppet Monster Adventure_ are a Frankenstein-ized Kermit ("Ker-Monster") and a Bride-ized Miss Piggy ("The Goulfriend of Ker-Monster").
-   One of the early bosses in _Mystik Belle_, brought to life through lightning and everything!
-   In _Operation Darkness_ one of your squad members, Frank Gaunt, _is_ the creature himself. He's intelligent, well-spoken, and can summon giant fists of lightning to come out of the sky to blow up Panzer tanks. Oh and the Doctor's not left out either, his descendant is helping the Nazis develop an atomic bomb.
-   For the 2016 Halloween event of _Overwatch_, Roadhog was given a 'Junkenstein's Monster' skin, which makes him look like one of these creatures.
-   Kanji's Halloween outfit in _Persona 4_ resembles this trope.
-   Frank Jr., the final boss of _Punch-Out!!_ spinoff _Arm Wrestling_, is a purple Frankenstein monster who can breathe fire on the player if they act too soon.
-   _Savage Halloween_ have Frankenstein's Monsters as minor enemies, though unlike the classic depictions, the ones in this game can actually sprint after you on sight. They're slightly more durable than common foes, shooting them enough will split them from the waist only for their upper torso to continue crawling after you. Appropriately enough, Dr. Frankenstein himself shows up as one of the bosses.
-   Bryan Fury of _Tekken_. A former, corrupt Interpol officer, Bryan was killed by drug dealers he had been involved with and resurrected as a cyborg by Dr Abel. Bryan certainly has the traits of Frankenstein's monster from the early films, being created from a criminal, having pale white skin and an appetite for destruction.
-   The first boss of _Twin Caliber_ is a huge, stitched-up zombie with electrical nodes attached to it's neck, which breaks loose while having various wires connected to it's body as it attacks you.
-   _The Ultimate Haunted House_ has one, also referred to as The Ultimate Monster. You can create him in the monster laboratory in the basement using the right parts. Unusually, this version of the Frankenstein monster speaks in complete sentences. If you create him, he will be friendly, though if Gahan creates him instead, he won't be.
-   The _Warcraft_ universe has undead abominations. They're huge lumbering creatures made from stitched up corpses and reanimated with dark magic. In _World of Warcraft_ there are other similar creatures as well. One particularly noteworthy is Thaddius, a boss in the necropolis Naxxramas, who looks a lot like an enormous Frankenstein's monster and has lightning-based powers (the gimmick of the fight is his ability to "polarise" the raid, giving half of the players a positive charge and the other half a negative charge. Going too close to an opposite charge results in heavy damages to the players). Other types include more techno-chemical monstrosities fond of spewing disease at enemies, and even gigantic undead monster dogs.
-   _Franchise/Wolfenstein_:
    -   _Spear of Destiny_, the sequel to _Wolfenstein 3-D_, has Dr. Schabbs' Uber-Mutant, a four-armed Frankenstein-type monster with a minigun implanted in its chest.

    Visual Novels 

-   Adage's path of _Steam Prison_ features Glissade Roselite, a Mad Doctor in the vein of Victor Frankenstein who is obsessed with creating life. In the past he succeeded in creating a living girl, who he named Priscilla, using the bodies of infants deemed "unnecessary" by the government; however, as she was created and grew up in a sterile laboratory environment, she sickened and died after being exposed to the outside world. He's in the sanctuary district working to revive her by harvesting body parts from the residents of the district, and targets heroine Cyrus because her blood type is ideal for transfusion. Two of Adage's endings, "Recessive" and "Flickering, Fading," see both Cyrus and Adage killed for this goal.
-   Vicky Schmidt, one of the playable characters in _Monster Prom_, is very clearly based on the Bride of Frankenstein, complete with neck bolts, blueish-green skin, a skunk stripe, and stitches all over her body. She's also a dorky cute Genki Girl and, like the other player characters, is a Lovable Sex Maniac who's out to ask her classmates to prom.

    Webcomics 

-   _Girl Genius_ has the entire class of artificial people made by Mad Scientists sometimes from scratch or corpses and sometimes by modifying normal humans and/or other animals, called "constructs", with most of them having at least a passing, and sometimes a very close, resemblance to the original Frankenstein's creation.
    -   The two constructs that raised Agatha were named Adam and Lilith Clay (in reality, Punch and Judy). (In case you don't get it, in some versions of the creation myth, Lilith was the first wife of created-out-of-_clay_ Adam, deposed because she preferred the female superior position. It seems that "Lilith" in this case refers to Lilith being the equal of her husband rather than submissive as Eve was).
    -   Some of the Jägermonsters (a Proud Warrior Race of "modified human" constructs) resemble The Creature closely, with greenish skin and intimidating proportions. Others sport claws, fangs, horns, and varying degrees of hair, and an assortment of skin tones.
    -   Krosp, a talking cat with the brain of a general... or most of it, anyway.
    -   Klaus Wulfenbach himself has a lot of nasty stitches. Implied to have been both brought back by his parents using the salvagable bits of their three messily killed sons and heavily modified (nearly impossible to kill or incapacitate, superhumanly strong).
-   In the Flashback Universe, the monster's "son," Victor, is part of the League of Monsters. And the monster himself ended up becoming Paladin, an Alternate Company Equivalent of Captain America. No, really.
-   _The Order of the Stick_ has a classic setup of this, complete with The Igor, the lightning (provided by Celia), and the "IT'S ALIVE!" quote, with the exception that the Mad Scientist is turning Roy into a bone golem. He also has a standard Frankenstein's Monster. (Which is a golem. Not an undead, honest.)
-   Sociopathic Hero Unity from _Skin Horse_ was a Super-Soldier project built from stitched-together pieces of corpses who went rogue, she replaces multiple body parts with fresh corpse pieces at least one an arc. Her creator eventually reveals that she's actually a black nanomachine goop that can inhabit any body, but living bodies tend to reject her after a few hours.
-   In _Bibliography_, one of the five Main Chapters is mentioned in passing to be the Frankenstein Codex, in charge of surgeries at St. Jerome's hospital.
-   One of the main characters of _Frankie and Stein_ is one of these, created by the other.
-   _Bloody Urban_ brings us Eric Lastname, a parody of this trope, he's a marketing exec/medical Frankenstinian creature with two left hands, Lego teeth, a hunchback and one eye that's a golf ball.
-   In _The Adventures of Dr. McNinja_, in the story "Why a Gorilla?", a young Dr. McNinja acting travels to a jungle village called Gagibuzo to hunt a vampire gorilla. It turns out that the whole village is inhabited by gorillas. It also turns out that the gorilla vampire was destroyed long ago, and the Serial Killer pretending to be him is a gorilla doctor who steals parts of gorilla bodies in an effort to keep his dead wife alive. The result is a creature with all too many body parts that Dr. McNinja refers to as "a Frankenstein"; she's supposedly powered by a car battery, but Dr. McNinja heavily suspects she only lives because of Clap Your Hands If You Believe.
-   _Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal_
-   One of the main characters in _Nightmarish_, also known as Scrap and is a gloomy Only Sane Man as a mildly Lighter and Softer take on their original book counterpart, while ironically looking more animalistic.
-   _xkcd_'s version in this strip offers to settle the question of the monster's name: The doctor brings the monster to life and declares, "To be clear, your name is Frankenstein. Canonically." And that's that, as long as you accept this strip as your canonical version. (However, in this canon, the doctor's name is just The Doctor.)
-   _Ennui GO!_: Dr. Bald creates a female monster that he names "Frankenhooker" (she prefers Frankie), and plans to prostitute her to fund his evil schemes - a plot that fails almost immediately when she decides she doesn't want to do that. She later starts dating a ghost and becomes a history teacher, and is probably one of the sanest characters in the cast.
-   _Poison Ivy Gulch_: One appears in the 6/24/2020 strip as a justice of the peace or, as the mayor describes him, a justice of many pieces.
-   The _The Glass Scientists_ incarnation is actually fairly stoic and hasn't killed his creator (yet?) instead seeming to care about her somewhat.

    Web Original 

-   In _Void Domain_, the necromancer Sawyer is fond of this trope. He stitches together demon parts with human parts in a mass of Body Horror. His own daughter is a patchwork of flesh and organs that don't quite fit together properly, leading one character to liken her to someone that had a fight with a blender.
-   In _Mortasheen_, Victrossus is definitely created with this trope in mind. It deals with the "brain" aspect a bit interestingly, as Victrossus is normally mostly brainless, with a neural "ladder" controlling its basic functions, but it is meant to have a brain put in it and enslaved by said neural "ladder" for their master to control it for their whims.
-   In _Dr. Crafty_, Nurse Worse is depicted as a Frankenstein Monster of the Cute Monster Girl variety. She certainly fits the bill design-wise with stitched green skin and giant bolts on her head and arms, though unlike other depictions of this trope, she's actually quite intellectual, especially when it comes to explaining the ins-and-outs of drawing. Plus, while electricity is usually used for giving life to Frankenstein Monsters, Nurse instead uses it for "medicinal purposes".
-   _Dreamscape_: Boru has got the green skin, blocky build, and low-intelligence of one of these.
-   The _Queer Duck_ episode "Tales of the City Morgue" has Oscar Wildcat create a Frankenstein monster from the anatomy of various gay celebrities (he is shown digging up the graves of Rock Hudson, Tennessee Williams and George Michael's career<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and explicitly states to have made his monster using the hands of Liberace, the brow of Montgomery Clift and the genitals of Roddy McDowall). In the end, Oscar Wildcat is horrified by how stereotypically gay his monster is.
-   _Frankenstein M.D._ has the monster be a Composite Character with Robert Walton, Victoria Frankenstein's friend and cameraman in this modern vlog version who dies in a mountain climbing incident. While Victoria's unethical experiments are able to bring him back to life, she was unable to fix the brain damage caused by the accident, making him an unstable shadow of his former self.

    Western Animation

-   _The Baskervilles_: The Frankensteins are the Baskerville's neighbours in Underworld: Frank, Fran, Young Frank, and Little Monster Annie.
-   _Beast Wars_:
    -   The character of Rampage doesn't fall far from the smarter and more vengeful incarnations of this monster, vengeful against those who cursed him with his freakish existence, against those who caged him like a beast, and driven by a cruel and sadistic nature, he frightens in a very Shelleyan way.
    -   Done more traditionally with the creation of Dinobot II, with Megatron playing the part of the Doctor and Waspinator as his Igor.
        
        From the tempest fury, the spark ignites! To sire new life! Transmetal 2 life!

    -   The alien in question, incidentally, is very true to Shelley's original portrayal, looks aside. He's fast and dexterous in addition to being strong and resilient, and he's extremely intelligent as well, being the chief organizer of the Big Bad's plot.
-   In the _Betty Boop_ cartoon "Betty Boop's Penthouse", Bimbo and Koko the clown work in a potion's lab and one of their concoctions ends up turning into a monster that greatly resembles the Frankenstein monster. Bimbo even yells out, "It's alive!" upon seeing it.
-   A Halloween Episode of _Celebrity Deathmatch_ actually had Frankenstein's monster fight a Wolfman. Bonus points for them ACTUALLY calling it "Frankenstein's _monster_", and not just "_Frankenstein_", like many other people...
-   _Dead End: Paranormal Park_: In the Musical Episode, Norma compares herself to Frankenstein's monster in light of discovering her idol Pauline Phoenix has been lying to and using her fans for years. And is also a ghost possessing her park impersonators to live forever.

    **Leela**: What's that supposed to mean?  
    **Fry**: I don't know. I got nervous, and I started thinking about neck bolts.
    
-   In _Gargoyles_, Demona and Xanatos use a set-up much like the classic Mad Scientist Laboratory where they use both magic and technology to create the cyborg Coldstone out of the parts of three Gargoyles. When it moves, Xanatos screams: "It's alive, ALIVE!" then calmly turns to Demona and says: "I Always Wanted to Say That".
-   In one episode of _Goof Troop_, Goofy inherits a castle from a distant relative called Dr. FrankenGoof, who had a created a monster that bore a striking resemblance to Pete.

Bugs briefly impersonates him in "Hare Tonic".
-   _Mary Shelley's Frankenhole_ has one that's fairly close to the book's version (not the Boris Karloff one though, as many characters point out). He's more like a mopey teenager than a monster though.
-   Probably the first depiction in an animated television series was 1965's _Milton the Monster_, a comedy cartoon about a monster made by a Mad Scientist that is too nice as it had too much tenderness in his formula.
-   _Mina and The Count_: Frankenstein's monster and his bride occasionally appear among vampire Vlad's circle of monster friends. Frank's most prominent role is in the short "Frankenfrog", where the chaos caused by the frog Mina brought back to life ends with the monster making the frog his pet.
