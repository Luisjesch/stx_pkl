_\[three hours into execution ceremony\]_  
**Daniel:** I think we're getting to the end.  
**O'Neill:** How can you tell?  
**Daniel:** Well, the crimes they're listing are starting to sound familiar.

A character is subjected to a Long List of their sins and transgressions, often impossibly long. The list may be presented in person, or written out (perhaps on a "Wanted!" Poster). Alternatively, a character is placed in purgatory or otherwise judged for their crimes, with a convenient long list of crimes at hand, possibly because the Powers That Be have Surveillance as the Plot Demands.

Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking (or Bread, Eggs, Milk, Squick, if you're delving into Black Comedy) is typically invoked, making this a sister trope. This can also invoke a Dissimile if the defense or accuser remarks that the target's record is pretty clean aside from the list. On the other hand, it can be subverted if it becomes Arson, Murder, and Lifesaving. The details on the list may qualify as Noodle Incidents.

Can lead to Longer-Than-Life Sentence.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In one _Black Jack_ story, Black Jack's school friend, Makube, is a criminal. He gets detained by the ICPO.
    
    **Inspector:** So you won't confess your crimes of murder, smuggling, drug-dealing, gambling fraud, forgery, battery, bribery, human trafficking, pimping, and public urination?  
    **Makube:** I'll cop to public urination.
    
-   _Dead Leaves_ start with the main characters, Pandy and Retro, go on a very brief but supremely violent crime spree which ends with them getting captured and sentenced to life imprisonment for "trespassing, theft, violence, assault, illegal possession of firearms, and a really crappy attitude!"
-   _Jo Jos Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders_: Steely Dan forces Jotaro to serve him by holding Joseph hostage with his Stand, The Lovers. Jotaro writes down every instance of abuse and humiliation Dan inflicts on him. Once The Lovers are neutralized and Dan is at Jotaro's mercy, he tries to offer money to be left alone, but Jotaro beats the shit out him, then drops the paper on his body and says, "Your receipt. You can keep the friggin' change."
-   _One Piece_: Before Kozuki Oden is introduced, a servant recounts to Sukiyaki, Oden's father and shogun of Wano Country, the feats Oden did across his lifetime up to this point since he was a baby, such as throwing his wet nurse across the room as an infant, catching two rabbits with his bare hands when he was 2, killing a bear with a thrown boulder when he was 4, visiting the red light district and participating in casinos when he was six, starting to drink booze and pick fights with gamblers when he was 8, waging a war against the Yakuza after they banned him from their casinos when he was nine, and having a harem of women who he kidnapped (who stayed willingly) when he was 15 and then causing the Harem War. Ironically, while narrating these events, the servants gets increasingly excited, showing that Oden is secretly admired for doing things the others wish to do but don't to follow Wano's strict rules. This scene gives a first impression of Oden as a troublesome and incredible person.

    Comic Books 

-   _D.R. & Quinch Go Straight_ begins with Judge Thorkwung reading all the criminal charges of which the two Villain Protagonists are being accused.
    
    **Judge Thorkwung:** Ernest Errol Quinch and Waldo Dobbs, also known as "D.R." or "Diminished Responsibility", you are charged with arson, kidnapping, theft, grievous wounding, possession of unlawful atomic weapons, taking and driving away, conspiracy to overthrow the government, coveting thy neighbour's ox, graverobbing, torture, criminal libel, blackmail, polluting the environment, shoplifting, 714 separate driving offenses, forging sacred relics, transmuting base metal into gold, genocide, spitting, and thirty-two offenses so unusual and horrible they do not have names.
    
-   In _Strangers in Paradise_, when Katchoo is arrested for her revenge on Freddie, her list of crimes reads as follows (creator Terry Moore got the specifics from a lawyer who'd read the previous issue):
    
    **Officer Bob:** Kidnapping! Re: restraining liberty for the purpose of terrorizing! Two counts of felonious assault! One count of illegal entry! $4400 in property damage and one count of aggravated menacing with a dangerous kitchen utensil with intent to...  
    **Freddie:** ...Castrate me! The crazy bitch tried to castrate me!  
    **Katchoo:** Imagine my surprise when I found I didn't have to!
    
-   _Lobo_'s list of crimes.
    
    Wanted for crimes against the Galaxy including: Genocide ... Fratricide ... Patricide ... Matricide ... Impersonating a member of the Intergalactic Church of Truth ... Impersonating a member of the Green Lantern Corps ... Carrying a concealed thermo-nuclear device ... Breaking into the Justice League Satellite ... Fishing without a license ... Jaywalking ... Grand theft plasma rocket ... Disturbance of the peace across three space sectors ... 1,978,643,896 unpaid parking permits ... Illegal bounty hunting ... Wanton destruction of government property ...

Noise infractions level 5.0 ... Illegally poaching Starros ... Bounty Huntering in a restricted zone ... Stepping on the grass ... Defecating in a public garden ... Loitering ... Advocating the overthrow of the heads of state ... Not honoring the bounty hunter code
    
    -   Possibly the most disturbing thing about this list is that it suggests you _can_ get a permit for demolishing a city. (More than likely, the offense didn't mean "non-licensed building demolitions".)
-   In _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures_ #23, a space criminal named Bellybomb is sentenced to a toxic prison planet for seventeen life sentences for extortion, armed robbery, hijacking, kidnapping, torture, murder, man-eating, brain poaching, soul thievery...and impersonating a primitive deity named Bob. After the jailers read off these crimes, Bellybomb points out that they didn't mention his unpaid parking tickets.
-   In IDW's _Megatron: Origins_ miniseries, Starscream is brought before the Senate to give testimony about the Decepticon "fight club"...
    
    **Senator:** Prisoner Starscream, I am required to list your charges as follows...assault, murder, armed robbery, destruction of state property, inciting civil disobedience, extortion, receiving and selling stolen goods, passing counterfeit funds, firing up on a state senator, multiple counts of attacks on state officers and state property, supplying known criminals with illegal weaponry, vehicle theft, and misrepresenting yourself as a state official.  
    **Starscream:** Heh. Nobody's perfect.
    
-   From _Atomic Robo_:
    
    By the authority of the League of Nations, Baron Heinrich von Helsingard is hereby placed under arrest as an enemy of all mankind for the crimes of kidnapping, human experimentation upon unwilling subjects, and... _\[flips through the list\]_ _Wow. Jeez,_ that's a lot of atrocities. Where did Helsingard find the time to sleep? _\[more flipping\]_ I don't even know what this one _means_.
    
-   In the _Detective Comics_ Issue #64 ("The Joker Walks the Last Mile"), as part of his master plan in putting his Joker Immunity to the test for freedom, the Joker rattles off a "seemingly never-ending list of his incredible crimes" to the police, including robbing the National Bank of Denver; this goes on for days until it's more than enough to warrant a death sentence (he gets better a little later).
-   _Nemesis the Warlock_: When Grand Master Torquemada is put on trial after his regime is overthrown, it takes _several days_ to read all the charges against him. Of course, it helps that he left tons of video evidence of all his tortures and genocidal campaigns (so he could have fun watching it later!) for the prosecution to use.
-   _The Transformers: Last Stand of the Wreckers:_ The fate of Violator, a Decepticon captured by Autobots one day. After being captured, he was chained up and subjected to _Prowl_, listing out all of Violator's crimes... and then listing, in full, the laws those crimes broke. At some point during the _third day_ of this, Prowl realized that Violator had willingly shut off his own spark rather than continue listening.
-   _Demon Knights:_ In Hell, Vandal Savage is given a list of all the things he's done over his immortal life. Being Vandal Savage, he's not remotely apologetic about any of them.

    Comic Strips 

-   In _Bloom County_, Bill the Cat, according to a FBI background check presented in a Sunday Strip, "has been either convicted, indicted, jailed, under investigation or pursued by a special prosecutor for influence peddling, racketeering, obstruction of justice, perjury, shredding documents, insider trading or _Wedtech_ shenanigans." The punchline is that this sort of "legal experience" makes him highly qualified to be hired as a Reagan administration official.

    Fan Works 

-   In the _Harry Potter_ AU _Empire_ we have this at the Dursleys arrest:
    
    **Kingsley Shacklebolt:** These are Harry Potter's muggle relatives. I am bringing them in on three thousand six hundred and fifty counts of child abuse—one for every day that poor boy had to spend in their house.
    
-   In the _Pony POV Series_ Dark World, Santa Hooves breaks into Discord's castle and reads his list to him. He does this _every year_.

-   The United Galaxies delivers one to Her Imperious Condescension in the _Golden Age_ series, courtesy of Queen Jane:
    
    **Jane:** _"The Coalition states for the record that it considers Her Imperious Condescension, Empress of Alternia and its conquered territories a Criminal, a Liability to her own people, an immature brat unfit for power, a Crazy Old Bat and an Abuser, and we do hereby charge her with Corruption, Corruption of Minors, Exploitation, Exploitation of Minors, Slavery, Slavery of Minors, Indoctrination, Indoctrination of Minors, Violation of the Prime Directive and Violation of seventy percent of the Chart of Universal Rights for the Sapient Species, and we declare to unanimously hold her in Contempt."_
    
-   _Luna's Cupboard_:
    
    Andromeda forced Snape to write out a confession of all his major crimes using a blood quill. It took up forty feet of parchment, and there was not enough parchment in all of Hogwarts to list his more minor crimes, but there was an extra four feet for the summary of them.
    
-   _Didn't Expect That_: Kanril Eleya arrests Section 31 operative Franklin Drake at the end of the story, charging him with "illegal genetic experimentation<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , misuse of government resources, sending a false distress signal, criminal negligence leading to combat loss of Starfleet assets<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , espionage, conspiracy to commit murder<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> … Oh, and two counts of trespassing."<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   In _Correcting Mistakes_ the list of Dumbledore's crimes takes up 27 feet of parchment.
-   _All For Luz_: When Governor Maxwell is arrested he's charged with enough crimes land him in prison for a life sentence with no parole.
    
    **Dr. Rodriquez**: Governor Rodger Maxwell was arrested by the Military for, and I quote: Human Trafficking, Child Trafficking, Serial Murder, Domestic Terrorism, Endangerment of Children, first-degree manslaughter, Kidnapping, Money Laundering, Embezzlement, Fraud, and the list goes on for a country mile, so to save myself from reading a literal novel worth of crimes, I'll cut it short there.
    

    Films — Animation 

-   _Heavy Metal_. The charges against Captain Sternn. The viewer soon learns that Sternn also ran a "preschoolers prostitute ring" and "sold dope disguised as a nun".
    
    **Prosecutor:** Lincoln Stern, you stand here accused of 12 counts of murder in the first degree, 14 counts of armed theft of Federation property, 22 counts of piracy in high space, 18 counts of fraud, 37 counts of rape...and one moving violation. How do you plead?
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _A Scanner Darkly_: The character Freck, a relentless drug fiend, attempts to commit suicide but miscalculates the amount of alcohol and pills he needs, so instead he starts hallucinating.
    
    **Narrator:** The next thing he knew, a creature from between dimensions was standing beside his bed, looking down at him disapprovingly.  
    **Freck:** You gonna read me my sins? _(the creature nods)_ Eh, it's gonna take a hundred thousand hours.  
    **Creature:** _**Your sins will be read to you ceaselessly, in shifts... throughout eternity. The list will never end.**_  
    **Creature:** _\[begins reading\]_ The Sins of Freck.  
    **Narrator:** Charles Freck wished he could take back the last half hour of his life.  
    **Creature:** "... theft of fingernail clippers..." "... you did knowingly and with malice..." "... punched your baby sister, Evelyn..." "... December, theft of Christmas presents..." "...one billion lies..."  
    **Narrator:** One thousand years later, they had reached the sixth grade, the year he had discovered masturbation.  
    **Creature:** "... November 14, Percodan... Vicodin... Cocaine..."
    
-   _Birds of Prey (2020)_: Every time Harley runs into somebody who seems to be after her, the narration explains their grievance towards her. When she's captured by Roman Sionis, there is an entire list of grievances that moves too quickly to be read
-   _The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_: At each of Tuco's "executions" an official reads off the list of crimes for which he has been convicted. They go on for quite a while. Considering how many of the offenses on the list, even the relatively lower-grade ones, were capital crimes, how he and Blondie cheat the executioner more than once is an exercise best left to Sergio Leone and the viewer, and in-universe, even Blondie realizes that the scam may not work the third time around and leaves Tuco in the desert after the second time, his only stated reason being that he didn't think Tuco would ever be worth more than three grand. The first time we see them pulling this scam, the judge is reading a list of offenses including murder, arson in a state prison, theft of sacred objects, inciting prostitution, armed robbery... but he sounds _really_ indignant as he winds up with "... and, contrary to the laws of this state, the condemned is guilty of using MARKED CARDS AND LOADED DICE!" He also apparently stole money from _both sides of the Civil War_. One judge remarks that Tuco "spontaneously confessed" to many of the crimes, implying that he made at least some of them up to drive up his bounty.
-   In _Brazil_, arrested Sam Lowry is presented with a long and painstakingly accurate list of his transgressions, from high treason to overexpenditure of stationery. Since this is harsh dystopia, the scene is anything but funny.
-   _Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl_ does this before Jack Sparrow, a notorious pirate, is to be executed. Note that the man reading them stated at the beginning that only "the most egregious" of his crimes were to be stated. The list still goes on for a _very_ long time.
-   _Year One_ has Cain reading a list of charges against Zed (Jack Black) and Oh (Michael Cera) when they are about to be stoned in Sodom. Played for Laughs when one of the charges is "Sodomy", much to the crowd's confusion, until it is revealed that the actual charge is "Refusal of Sodomy".
-   Near the end of W. C. Fields' _The Golf Specialist_, we briefly see J. Effingham Bellweather's wanted poster which includes such things as manslaughter and homicide. The next shot is a ten-second pan down a list of his other offenses:
    
    Bigamy,  
    Passing as the Prince of Wales,  
    Eating spaghetti in public,  
    Using hard words in a speakeasy,  
    Trumping partner's ace,  
    Spitting in the Gulf Stream,  
    Jumping board bill in seventeen lunatic asylums,  
    Failure to pay installments on a strait-jacket,  
    Possessing a skunk,  
    Revealing the facts of life to an Indian.
    
-   Subverted in _The Pope Must Die_ when the dying Cardinal Rocco asks for absolution for his sins. When asked what they are he replies that since he doesn't have a lot of time, if you can think of it, he's done it.
-   In _Stargate: Continuum_, SG-1 is asked to be present at the execution of the (supposedly) last Ba'al clone. When Jack finally decides to ask what the last several hours of continuous chanting have been about, he's informed that the Tok'ra were listing all of Ba'al's crimes in the Goa'uld language and they're only now reaching the end of the list — as a Time Abyss Evil Overlord, it's quite extensive.
-   Played with in _The Dark Knight_, where the long list is due to the judge reading the charges in a RICO case that is being brought against the entire mob at once.
    
    **Judge Surillo**: _...712 counts of extortion, 849 counts of racketeering, 246 counts of fraud, 87 counts of conspiracy murder, 527 counts of obstruction of justice. How do the defendants plead?_
    
    _\[torrent of abuse from a courtroom crowded with defendants\]_
    
-   _The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle_ features the states of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio vs. Karen Sympathy, Rocket J. Squirrel, and Bullwinkle J. Moose.
    
    **Judge Cameo:** The defendants are charged with grand theft auto: 1 count; breaking out of jail: 1 count; impugning the character of a prison guard: 1 count; reckless driving: 4 counts; talking to the audience; five counts; criminally bad punning: 18 counts.  
    **Bullwinkle:** And three dukes and seven earls.  
    **Judge Cameo:** Make that 19.
    
-   _Liar Liar_ has a case where the criminal confesses his transgressions:
    
    **Cop:** Do you know why pulled you over?  
    **Fletcher:** Depends on how long you were following me!  
    **Cop:** Let's just take it from the top.  
    **Fletcher:** _\[sigh\]_ Here goes. I sped. I followed too closely. I ran a stop sign. I almost hit a Chevy. I sped some more. I failed to yield at a crosswalk. I changed lanes at the intersection. I changed lanes without signaling while running a red light _and speeding!_  
    **Cop**: Is that all?  
    **Fletcher**: No. I have unpaid parking tickets. _\[Opens the glove compartment and masses of tickets spill out.\]_ Be gentle.
    
-   _Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home_ ends with Admiral Kirk and his crew brought before the Federation Council and read the list of their crimes from the previous film. Subverted, though, in that almost all of the charges are dismissed, and the only legal consequence is Kirk getting demoted to Captain—which makes him very happy.
-   _The Hidden_: When the alien Puppeteer Parasite villain's first onscreen body is near death in the hospital, a doctor takes offense to the police officers' relief, saying that no one deserves to die like that. One of the officers responds thus:
    
    He killed twelve people, wounded twenty three more, stole six cars, most of them Ferraris. Robbed eight banks, six supermarkets, four jewelery stores and a candy shop. Six of the ones he killed he carved up with a butcher knife. Two of them were kids. He did all that in two weeks. If anyone deserves to go that way, it sure in the hell was him!
    
-   At the end of the film version _Hoot_, the villain is arrested for trying to destroy a habitat for endangered owls, driving a bulldozer without a licence, and "many other things".
-   Parodied in _Kingsman: The Secret Service_ with Harry's comment to an attendant of a church that shows high levels of anti-Semitic, racist, homophobic and anti-choice sentiment as he makes to leave:
    
    I'm a Catholic whore currently enjoying congress out of wedlock with my black Jewish boyfriend who works at the military abortion clinic. So hail Satan and have a lovely afternoon, madam.
    
-   _Ghostbusters (1984)_: Walter Peck reads one of these to Janine when she asks for a warrant.
-   In _Thor: Ragnarok_, Thor gives an angry "The Reason You Suck" Speech to Loki listing some of his more recent transgressions- faking his death, stealing the throne from Odin, causing Odin's death by stranding him on Earth and allowing Hela to be unsealed- before noting that he only included the ones from the past _two days._

    Literature 

-   Two from _Discworld_:
    
    -   In _Jingo_. Carrot suggests war is, by definition, a breach of the peace, and Vimes starts adding up the other crimes you can charge an entire army with:
        
        **Vimes:** Conspiracy to cause an affray, going equipped to commit a crime, threatening behaviour, loitering with intent, loitering within tent, hah, travelling for the purpose of committing a crime, malicious lingering and carrying concealed weapons.  
        **Carrot:** I don't think that one —  
        **Vimes:** _I_ can't see 'em.
        
    
    And one count of offensive behavior to the general on his own side.
    
    -   The Elf Queen's lawyers do this to the Nac Mac Feegle in _The Wee Free Men_:
        
        **Lawyer:** — including more than two thousand cases of Making an Affray, Causing a Public Nuisance, Being Found Drunk, Being Found Very Drunk, Using Offensive Language (taking into account 97 instances of Using Language That Was Probably Offensive If Anyone Could Understand It), Committing a Breach of the Peace, Malicious Lingering, Grand Theft, Petty Theft, Burglary, Housebreaking, Loitering with Intent to Commit a Felony —
        
    -   Subverted in _Eric_, where Hell's new punishments include, instead of being forced to push a boulder up a hill, being forced to listen to all the safety regulations for manhandling large objects. Neither the sinner nor the demon are happy about this.
-   Dante's _Inferno_ keeps track of transgressions, with Hell being divided into subsections for specific crimes.
-   Platime, head of a country's criminal underworld in _The Elenium_, delivers his own list of transgressions to his queen — while negotiating a blanket pardon in exchange for his loyal service.
    
    **Platime:** Nothing worth mentioning, your Majesty... There were a few incidental murders, assorted thefts, robberies, extortions, burglaries, arsons, smuggling, highway robbery, cattle rustling, pillaging a couple of monasteries, operating unlicensed brothels—that sort of thing...  
    **Queen Ehlana:** Is there any crime you _haven't_ committed?  
    **Platime:** Barratry, I think... Also, I've never had carnal knowledge of an animal, I've never practiced witchcraft, and I've never committed treason.  
    **Ehlana:** Those are the more really serious ones, I suppose.
    
-   The Neil Gaiman short story "Other People" from _Fragile Things_ is centered on the premise of hell being basically this, only instead of simply being read the list, every single sin is brought forth and purged from the individual via Cold-Blooded Torture.
-   In _A Clockwork Orange_, Alex’s list is so long the policeman in charge of writing it down is completely pale by the time he's finished.
-   In _The Naked Mole-Rat Diariest_ by Mary Amato, Frankie's father lists everything she's done wrong over the past two weeks— refuse to be in the school play, rip up a library book, tell a teacher that her father is having a nervous breakdown... Frankie lampshades it in the narration, saying it's horrible hearing a list of her sins and why isn't her father mentioning the sins of the rest of the family?
-   In _Rally Round the Flag, Boys!_, Opie Dalmrymple, for his part in provoking the Fourth of July melee, is threatened with Court Martial proceedings for violations of "several Articles of War, several local ordinances of Putnam's Landing, and possibly the Kellogg-Briand Pact." However, he gets summarily pardoned before any of these charges are brought to trial.
-   _Star Wars Rebels: Servants of the Empire_
    -   After things go From Bad to Worse in _The Secret Academy_, Merei has a long speech about everything she's done against the Empire in the series to her parents, who are staring with their mouths practically agape.
    -   In the same book, Zare Leonis is sent to a tribunal and is expected to presented with a lengthy review of all of the bad things he's done against the Empire. Instead, his judge, Colonel Julyan, simply reads off the list of the things he's charged with, which are fraudulent enlistment, making false official statements, perjuring his oath as a cadet, refusal to obey lawful orders, conduct unbecoming of a cadet, dereliction of duty, destruction of Imperial property, conspiracy, providing aid and comfort to enemies of the Galactic Empire, espionage, assault on Imperial personnel, attempted murder of Imperial personnel, sedition and treason. He then asks him for his plea.
-   In _The Ring of Solomon_, a prequel book from _The Bartimaeus Trilogy_, Bartimaeus's list of transgressions against Solomon's Jerusalem includes eating guests of Jerusalem, fighting, devouring servants, running in the corridors, cursing, drawing rude stick figures on the harem walls, causing unpleasant smells to permeate the kitchens, and spitting on the upholstery. He explains that these are the things that aren't allowed to be done in Jerusalem because he's been told off personally for doing them. There may be others.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Better Call Saul_: The first episode of season 4, "Smoke," sees Mike decide to conduct a surprise security audit of a Madrigal warehouse. After spending the day going around the office and warehouse, he gives the facility manager a dressing down in front of his subordinates.
    
    **Mike:** I waltz through security with someone else's ID. Nobody gives me a second look. When the rightful owner shows up, there's no facility-wide badge check. I find access doors left unlocked or propped open, passwords written on post-it notes. Warehouse workers are using pen and paper instead of electronic inventory devices, which leaves you wide open to pilfering. You got duplicate routing numbers on cargo, surveillance-camera blind spots on the north and the east side of the floor, inventory documents that are going into the trash instead of being shredded, not to mention loading equipment being driven at unsafe speeds and crews disregarding safety protocols-
    
    **Manager:** Wait. Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Who are you, exactly?  
    **Mike:** Ehrmantraut. Security consultant.  
    **Manager:** Well, all due respect, I don't know anything about a security consultant.  
    **Mike:** Well, you wouldn't, would you? Maybe you'd best call corporate. Try Lydia Rodarte-Quayle.
    
-   _Our Miss Brooks_: In "Spare That Rod!", Mr. Conklin is tricked into believing he's about to be fired for being "flagrantly dictatorial" in his administration of Madison High School. As a result, he requests Miss Brooks, Mr. Boynton, Walter Denton and Stretch Snodgrass provide him with a list of his transgressions:
    
    **Mr. Conklin:** Now, if you will read me your bill of particulars considering my various infamies...  
    **Mr. Boynton:** We're all going to read some of it, Mr. Conklin. Will you begin Miss Brooks?  
    **Miss Brooks:** Thank you, Mr. Boynton. Whereas I, Osgood Conklin, Principal of Madison High School, desiring to improve relations between myself, the faculty, and the student body... your turn, Walter.  
    **Walter Denton:** Ahem. Do promise to keep the following ever before me as a reminder of past sins of which I am heartily ashamed.  
    **Stretch Snodgrass:** Which I ain't never gonna repeat no more.  
    **Mr. Conklin:** Splendid. Splendid. Please continue.  
    **Miss Brooks:** Wait until you hear this! I readily admit on many occasions I have acted like a pompous, puffed up, ill tempered, addlepated blowhard.  
    **Mr. Conklin:** Forgive me, but it seems to me you have omitted maladjusted.  
    **Miss Brooks:** Please don't interrupt, that's in the next paragraph. Now, where was I?  
    **Mr. Conklin:** Addlepated blowhard.  
    **Miss Brooks:** Oh yes. Addlepated blowhard. And on other occasions, I have bellowed like a bull...  
    **Mr. Boynton:** Screamed like an elephant...  
    **Walter Denton:** Hissed like a viper...  
    **Stretch Snodgrass:** Snorted like a buffalo...  
    **Miss Brooks:** And otherwise exhibited the behavior of a maladjusted nincompoop.  
    **Mr. Conklin:** Oh, oh, oh, there it is!
    
-   Happens in _Arrested Development_ in a preliminary to the court case. It makes George Sr. aware, for the first time, just how deep in trouble he is.
-   The health inspector reading the list of violations at _Fawlty Towers_. About halfway through Basil says "Yes... say no more..." but the inspector just ploughs right on until he reaches "... and two dead pigeons in the water tank."
-   From _CSI: NY_:
    
    **Mac:** You're under arrest for the murder of Derek James \[and\] Lauren Salinas, kidnapping and attempted murder of a crime scene investigator, armed robbery, grand theft auto, assault and battery. But most of all, for pissing me off.
    
    -   A later episode has a US Treasury Agent reading a laundry list of charges to a suspect they've been unable to charge with murder.
    -   Downplayed by Adam saying of one suspect, "The penal code is his personal to-do list. Pick a section, he's violated it."
    -   And with Flack saying of another, "This guy should get a gold medal in the felony Olympics. He's got 17 arrests so far this year, and two open drug charges to boot."
-   _Law & Order_:
    -   The same thing with Lennie Briscoe:
        
        **Briscoe:** I'm trying to decide what to arrest you for — obstruction of justice, harboring a fugitive or just being a general pain in the ass!
        
    -   Another episode ends with one; as the crime in question was a subway bombing with multiple victims, the list consists of the jury being asked "on the count of murder in the first degree of \_\_\_\_, how do you find" and answering "guilty" many times.
-   One _Saturday Night Live_ sketch centered on a lawyer representing one of the old cranks that the _Scooby-Doo_ gang caught who was accusing the kids of having a criminal record (Lowe played Scooby-Doo, who advocated the "Reath Renalty" for numerous criminals). By the lawyer's account, prior convictions against the kids included 4 counts of meddling, 12 counts of meddling in the second degree, two counts of vehicular meddling, meddling across state lines, and sodomy. Though the last one, it turns out, was just misread and was actually just "meddling."
-   In _The Brittas Empire_, Gordon Brittas has quite a long list when he turns up in heaven including 115 separate acts of manslaughter, cause of 4 suicides, and 23 people driven clinically insane. They'd been counting up a while before he arrived too, don't worry, even Heaven recognises the Death Equals Redemption trope.
-   This happens in _Stargate SG-1_ when Vala is put on trial by the people of a world Qetesh ruled harshly while using Vala as a host. After she is charged with mass murder and mass torture (the first two of seven charges), Vala and Daniel interject that Qetesh did those things, not Vala. Played for laughs and drama when the modified list of charges (only four now) which only includes crimes Vala perpetrated after she was released from Qetesh starts with "planetary-wide forced labor". She considers it for a second, before deciding it's a fair charge.
-   This is how every episode of _The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret_ begins, with a British judge reading legal charges against the titular character, leading into a How We Got Here plot.
-   An amusing minor joke in And the Trial of the Triangle, where the team stages an intervention for Flynn. Ezekiel starts his section by unrolling a very large roll of paper which contained his list of grievances. He is cut off by the rest of the team before he can get to most of them.
-   _Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger_, and its American counterpart _Power Rangers S.P.D._, go into this whenever "Judgment Time" takes place.
-   The entire premise of _My Name Is Earl_. The titular character learns about the concept of karma and figures that the reason his life sucks and nothing but bad things happen to him is because he is a Jerkass and a crook who does nothing but bad things to other people. He makes a list of every bad thing he remembers doing and sets out to make amends for them one by one.
-   Vogler in _House_ rattles off House's.
    
    **Vogler:** A man is the sum of his actions. Here are a few of Dr. House's. He violated a DNR and was charged with assault. He brought a termite into the OR and spat on a surgeon. He accepted a Corvette from a patient who was a known member of the New Jersey mafia... He is a drug addict who flaunts his addiction and refuses to get treatment. He is a disgrace and an embarrassment to this hospital. I'd go on, but it gets kinda mean.  
    **Board Member:** If you look far enough into any doctor's past—  
    **Vogler:** This is all in the past month!
    
-   Inverted in a _Star Trek: The Original Series_ episode. Kirk takes the stand in a trial, and the computer begins to read his long service record and awards. The prosecuter wants to shut it off, but the defense argues that it's relevant.
-   Captain Sisko does this to himself at the end of the _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ episode "In the Pale Moonlight". It's actually a short list, but the transgressions are real doozies for a Starfleet officer.
    
    **Captain Sisko:** So... I lied. I cheated. I bribed men to cover the crimes of other men. I am an accessory to murder. But the most damning thing of all... I think I can live with it. And if I had to do it all over again... I would.
    
-   _Star Trek: Discovery_:
    -   Michael Burnham gets it twice in "Battle at the Binary Stars" for her actions in the previous episode — first from her captain, and second when she's Court-martialed.
        
        **Captain Georgiou:** Commander Burnham, you have endangered your vessel and your shipmates. You have attacked a superior officer. You violated the chain of command. You are relieved of duty. Security, remand her to the brig.
        
        **Judge:** To the charge of dereliction of duty, to the charge of assaulting a fellow officer, to the charge of mutiny. To all these charges, how do you plead?  
        **Burnham:** _(sotto)_ Guilty.  
        **Judge:** The accused cannot be heard.  
        **Burnham:** Guilty on all counts.
        
    -   In the "Short Treks" episode "The Escape Artist", the audience is treated to a long list of the crimes Harry Mudd is wanted for, culminating in a Call-Back:
        
        **Tevrin Krit:** Harcourt Fenton Mudd, wanted by the Federation on 30 counts of smuggling, 20 counts of attempted homicide, one count of attempted _regicide_...  
        **Harry Mudd:** Pft! "Regicide". He was a duke. Hardly counts as regicide. What are we attempting to murder now? Accuracy?  
        **Tevrin Krit:** Transportation of stolen goods, and one count of... _penetrating a space whale?!_  
        **Harry Mudd:** You kinda had to be there.
        
-   In the episode "Folsom Prison Blues" of _Supernatural_, Agent Reidy lists Dean's criminal charges from at least 5 different states.
-   _Red Dwarf_:
    -   The series kicks off with Rimmer's Establishing Character Moment, which is the list of charges he has filed against Lister, namely: 123 counts of insulting a superior technician, 39 counts of dereliction of duty, 84 counts of general insubordination and one count of mutiny.
        
        **Todhunter:** Mutiny, Lister?  
        **Lister:** I stood on his toe.  
        **Rimmer:** Maliciously and with intent to wound!
        
    -   In the episode "Terrorform", Kryten, in a perfectly earnest manner, spends a minute giving Rimmer a long list of reasons why he'd have so much self-loathing (and only goes through half the list).

    Music 

-   During live shows early in their career, Disturbed would have an Alice Cooper\-like on-stage execution of their "madman" lead singer for concert openings. He struggles like an animal, strapped into an electric chair, while a chilling voice reads out his absurdly long and unreal list of crimes.
    
    Docket 1031373<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  in the case of the United States versus David Michael Draiman.  
    The defendant has been found guilty of the following crimes:  
    38 counts of murder; Forced entry; 24 counts of statutory rape; 13 counts of sodomy; 12 counts of aggravated assault; 10 counts of theft of private property; and one count of treason against the government of the United States of America.  
    Because of the violent and overall disturbing nature of these crimes, the defendant is hereby sentenced to death by electrocution  
    May God have mercy upon your soul.
    
-   Doug Anthony Allstars' _Broad Lic Nic_ is the alleged life story of a fabulist who makes Baron Munchausen look restrained. At one point, he boasts that the list of his transgressions is so long and terrible that hearing it constitutes a punishment in itself:
    
    "I told a pack of filthy lies as a politician; **I heard my own confession as an act of contrition."**
    
-   Big Audio Dynamite's song "Medicine Show" samples the listing of Tuco's offenses from _The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_.
-   The narrator of They Might Be Giants' song "Reprehensible" has this happen every night by a mystery voice.
    
    "Night after night, the voice recites my misdeeds"

-   In the first episode of _Old Harry's Game_, Thomas demands to know why he's been put in Hell. At first, Satan can't find the list and thinks he's made a mistake, but he soon finds Thomas's list - and it's pages long.

    Religion 

-   The Bible mentions in its last book Revelation that there will be a great judgment of the entire human race conducted by God Himself. It states simply that those who have accepted Jesus will enter God's kingdom as their transgressions have been pardoned by Jesus on their behalf, and those who have not accepted Jesus will not receive this pardon and all of their long list of sins will be held against them.
-   _Ecclesiastical History of the English People_, Book 5, Chapter 13 - an example of this trope being Older Than Print. Two beautiful youths gave the king a small white book containing a list of good deeds performed. Then, evil spirits came and gave a large black book containing a list of transgressions. The evil spirits asked the youths why they were here, since he clearly belonged to the spirits of evil.

    Roleplay 

-   In _Open Blue_, the Axifloan Coalition lists various crimes that various Pirate Lords and ladies are wanted for. While some have pretty serious lists throughout, others... not so much. Pirate Lady Lucille Prideux's (from v4) list ends with "Theft in general" while Captain Van Wijk's ends with "Blasphemy" (which is pretty light compared to his other crimes). The real cake takers, however, are Captain Garth (v4), with "Unlicensed operation of a menagerie", and Captain Ingrid (v4), with "Insulting Admiral Flota Vladimir Ilyavich Tokarev, **HERO OF THE TRIBES**".

    Tabletop Games 

-   The Dwarves of _Warhammer_ have a Book of Grudges in which are recorded every slight and every insult made to a dwarf. Appropriate passages from the book are read out during the wars waged to avenge these insults, with the dwarves having difficulty in seeing the link between every such war lengthening the Book and their diminishing population.
-   A priest/lawyer addressing the famous Rogue-Mage Raz in a trial:
    
    **Inquisitor:** You...are the worst of all... Your crimes are the stuff of nightmares to all decent folk and just ways! YOU ARE AN ABOMINATION UPON LIFE AND DECENCY!!! VANDALISM, BANDITRY, SPYING, PIRACY, ABDUCTION, ILLEGAL USE OF MAGICAL ENERGIES, LOITERING, RESISTING ARREST, and worst of all.... tax evasion. WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY FOR YOUR HERESY?
    
-   This is what Lord Soth had to put up with during his time as The Undead on Krynn: a list provided by ghosts. When he went to Ravenloft, his punishment was to listen to them repeated improperly, which is apparently worse.

    Theatre 

-   _Hamilton_: Near the end of the play when Aaron Burr has had enough of Alexander Hamilton and seeks to challenge him to a duel, Hamilton sends Burr an itemized list of thirty years of disagreements, with the side dancers in the play delivering the pages to Burr across the stage one by one. Burr's response is just a "Sweet Jesus."
-   In _Much Ado About Nothing_, Constable Dogberry attempts this against Borachio and Conrade, but it's a Disorganised Outline Speech where he keeps repeating the same transgression in different forms:
    
    **Dogberry**: Marry, sir, they have committed false report; moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.
    

    Video Games 

-   Mentioned in _Portal 2_.
    
    **GLaDOS (to Chell):** Impersonating a Stalemate Associate. I just added that to the list. It's a list I made of all the things you've done. Well, it's a list I AM making, because you're still doing things, even though I'm telling you to stop. _Stop_, by the way.
    
-   In _The Feeble Files_ (aka _Floyd_), the game menu will track your progress by providing a list of crimes committed so far. Since the game setting is a dystopian parody, the list grows long quite quickly.
-   Guybrush in _Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge_ has one of these in a "Wanted!" Poster, which keeps growing in size as the game progresses.
-   _League of Legends_ own little lawbreaker, Jinx, has quite the interesting list of transgressions. As seen on her wanted poster:
    
    Murder, Unprovoked Assault, Disturbing the Peace, Public Indecency, Murder Again, Unauthorized Property Recoloration, Unflattering Impersonation of an Officer, Reckless Hexplosive Detonation, Destruction of the Peace, Really Petty Larceny, Exorbiant Weapon Size, Some More Murders, Inciting Mass Hysteria, Making Fun of the Peace, Aggravated Jaywalking, Forging of Official Wanted Posters.

-   The Joker's rap sheet in _Batman: Arkham VR_, which goes from the horrific, to Mythology Gags, to Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking, to absolutely ridiculous and back again, as it would for him.

-   Humorously inverted in _Tales of Berseria_, in which the lead character Velvet Crowe lays out a list of her own dark deeds...
    
    **Priest:** Come, sinner, and repent your wicked deeds!  
    **Velvet:** Empyreans, hear my confession. When I was in prison, I instigated a riot and used it to break myself out.  
    **Priest:** Huh...?!  
    **Velvet:** Then I set fire to some warehouses in town and stole a ship to make my getaway. Then I teamed up with some pirates to destroy a military fortress. I killed anyone who got in my way.  
    **Priest:** What?!  
    **Velvet:** What do you think, Father? Will the Empyreans will forgive me?  
    **Priest:** I, er... ah... I think you should turn yourself in to the Abbey, and let them help you repent...  
    **Velvet:** That's convenient! I'm already planning on going to the Abbey. You see, I'm going to kill their boss, Artorius.  
    **Priest:** I-I need an exorcist over here, quick! Somebody! Anybody!  
    **Velvet:** That's... about how I figured it'd go.
    
-   Not-so-humorously inverted in _Mass Effect 2_'s "Lair of the Shadow Broker" DLC, where one option for resolving a Hostage Situation is to have Shepard rattle off to the hostage-taker several of their climactic decisions from earlier in the series, which involve sacrifice for the greater good<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and then ask her if she's _really_ willing to bet that Shepard _won't_ Shoot the Hostage.
-   In _Liberal Crime Squad_, you get one of these when one of your Liberals is arrested. If they've been particularly active, it will also be a comically Long List.

    **Shamir**: Inciting a Kingdom noble to rebel. Unlawful entry. The attempted assassination of the archbishop. An attack on the Holy Mausoleum. It is unnecessary to go on, followers of the Western Church.

    -   The _real_ Ginyu _tried_ to reveal this to Yenma, but since he was in the frog's body, Yenma couldn't understand him, and just told his assistant to put him in the soul scrubber while he took his lunch.
-   In episode four of _If the Emperor Had a Text-to-Speech Device_, the Emperor is not fond of the many ways the Inquisition has been operating over the last 10,000 years since he was put on the Golden Throne.
    
    **The Emperor**: _Really, what the fuck have you all become? Labor camps and sterilizations? Murder millions over bare superstition? Excommunication of actually loyal Astartes? Have thousands of imperial planets and its valuable assets destroyed because some guy fapped with barbed wire and accidentally summoned a daemon or two? Be painfully hypocritical and use xenos and daemonic weaponry and aid in order to carry across "my will?" Use techno-monkeys??_

-   One occurs in _Fanboys_. Which is also an Insult Backfire and/or I Take Offense to That Last One... unless all those crimes took place on the same day.
-   _The Adventures of Dr. McNinja_ has this in purgatory, except the list is a menu. The dead must _eat_ all their sins before they can move on to their final rest. It takes a very long time, because there's only one waiter. In the words of Ben Franklin II, the service is "the worst."
-   _Darths & Droids_ in this strip:
    
    **Obi-Wan:** Let's see... You stole the plans for a symbol of peace. You're allied with (a) a known megalomaniacal warlord and (b) a criminal sociopath. You have not one, but two, armies at your disposal. You've captured me — unfairly — and are holding me with no means of escape. And you're monologuing.
    
-   In _Little Dee_, Vachel engages in a hip-hop battle with one of his former Furtovian Library colleagues who, in his rap, lists Vachel's on-the-job misdeeds:

-   In this _Housepets!_ strip, Spirit Dragon asks of both her mortal realm representatives what she had done to harm them.

-   In _Precocious_ at the conclusion of the "Poppinstock Fundraiser" arc the principal rattled off a five-panel Wall of Text detailing the incidents perpetrated by the kids at the fair.

While I lack proof I believe there was a homemade bomb crafting workshop operating under the announcer's booth. And, despite all warnings, some are trying to sue us._
    
-   Captain Tagon, of _Schlock Mercenary_, suffers a Rhetorical Question Blunder because, apparently, the company lawyer kept a list:
    
    **Tagon:** Massey, you've been with us since before Doyt came aboard. During that time have we done anything illegal?  
    **Massey:** Do you want me to sort the list by date, or do you want it grouped into 'felonies' and 'misdemeanors?'  
    **Tagon:** You could have just said "yes" and left it at that.  
    **Massey:** A couple of items may fall under 'high treason' or 'war crimes.' I'll have to check.

-   The Protectors of the Plot Continuum are required to read the list of charges to those they terminate.

Moving violations, kittennapping, littering, chain pulling... you get the idea; The number of silly crimes outstrips the serious ones, and "Drunken {something}" recurs often.
-   _Worm_:
    -   The trope is Played for Drama in Hive 5.4, at the meeting to discuss the bullying of Taylor by Emma, Madison, and Sophia.
        
        **Taylor:** _\[referring to the stack of papers she brought\]_ Six vicious emails, Sophia pushed me down the stairs when I was near the bottom, making me drop my books, tripped and shoved me no less than three times during gym, and threw my clothes at me while I was in the shower after gym class had ended, getting them wet. I had to wear my gym clothes for the rest of the morning. In biology, Madison used every excuse she could to use the pencil sharpener or talk to the teacher, and each time she passed my desk, she pushed everything I had on my desk to the floor. I was watching for it the third time, and covered my stuff when she approached, so on the fourth trip, she emptied the pencil sharpener into one of her hands and dumped the shavings onto my head and desk as she walked by. All three of them cornered me after school had ended and took my backpack from me, throwing it in the garbage.  
        **Principal** \[_making a sympathetic face_\]: I see. Not very pleasant, is it?  
        **Taylor:** That's September eighth. My first day back at school, last semester. September ninth—  
        **Principal:** Excuse me, sorry. How many entries do you have?  
        **Taylor:** One for pretty much every school day starting last semester. Sorry, I only decided to keep track last summer. _September ninth_...

-   The election episode of _The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius_ doubly subverts it.

        **Renslayer:** You stand here accused of tampering with the Sacred Timeline, philosophically opposing predeterminism, crossing over into forbidden areas of Disney+, taking two spots in the Goofy parking lot, being more popular than all the heroes, having a British accent when you're actually supposed to be from Norway, promising to be good then breaking your promise like, uh, a _zillion_ times, making us sit through numerous mid-credits scenes hoping they advance the story, and will you _please_ wash your nasty hair?! Guilty as charged, get outta my face!
        
-   In one _Futurama_ episode, the Robot Devil claims to have a "55-page warrant" with Bender's crimes. He also lists some of them... in song, no less.
    -   In "The Cyber House Rules", Bender is arrested by Child Services on counts of child cruelty, child endangerment, depriving children of food, selling children _as_ food, and misrepresenting the weight of livestock.
-   The Animated _Doctor Who_ special _"The Infinite Quest"_ has a fake prison governor deliver a list of The Doctor's known outstanding crimes to Martha.
    
    **Governor:** Minor traffic violations: 1400 counts. Evading library fine: 250 counts.  
    **Martha:** Come on, that's nothing serious.  
    **Governor:** Planetary demolition...  
    **Martha:** How many counts?  
    **Governor:** Seventeen... no, Eighteen.
    
-   _Archer_:
    -   Subverted in the season five premiere, when Archer is informed by an FBI agent that he is under arrest (after having shot another agent.) When Archer asks for the charges, he is told "In addition to the attempted murder of a federal agent? Well, there's gonna be just a whole bunch of charges, but mostly treason."
    -   Later in the episode, the team decides to rat on each other and the whole testimony is shown in a montage. Each crime is a Call-Back to previous episodes:
        
        **Ray:** I said Ms. Archer had an affair with the head of the KGB for, like, 30 years—  
        **Cheryl:** Yeah, until he got blown up... Which was actually my fault—  
        **Cyril:** Because she was busy having choke-sex with a murderous cyborg, who then became the new head of the KGB until—  
        **Krieger:** I built a sexier one out of illegal Soviet parts. And a corpse.  
        **Pam:** There was _no shortage_ of dead bodies around ISIS—  
        **Ray:** One of which belonged to the prime minister of goddamn Italy—  
        **Cyril:** Oh, Jesus, I forgot about the—  
        **Cheryl:** Giant pot farm in West Virginia—  
        **Pam:** And this whole other thing with the Yakuza—  
        **Ray**: Irish Mob—  
        **Cheryl:** Piracy—  
        **Cyril:** White slavery—  
        **Pam:** No, like, actual piracy, with boats and—  
        **Cheryl:** I wanna sayyyyy... Burt Reynolds?  
        **Cyril:** Poaching alligators—  
        **Ray:** Smuggling Mexicans—  
        **Krieger:** Defiling a corpse—  
        **Cyril:** Defiling a different corpse—  
        **Pam:** Kidnapping the Pope—  
        **Cheryl:** Faking my own kidnapping! Hah! \[Beat\] Arson.  
        **Pam:** Bumfights! You know, like when you pay bums to—  
        **Cyril:** Destroy an oil pipeline in—  
        **Cheryl:** Goddammit, I wanna say Burt Reynolds!  
        **Cyrill:** Turkmenistan?  
        **Krieger:** Odessa. You know, the ratlines—  
        **Cheryl:** Where you make it look like a murder-suicide, but—  
        **Krieger:** Is it murder if they were my own clones? I'm seriously asking.  
        **Ray:** Oh, because, speaking of sexual assault—  
        **Pam:** Which time? Because for one of 'em I got a pretty good excuse.  
        **FBI Agent:** Can I stop you, please?  
        **Pam:** That's what he said! _Ahem..._ Inappropriate.  
        **Cyril:** Geez, when you just list everything ISIS has done, it sounds kind of bad.
        
-   _Gravity Falls_:
    -   Near the end of the episode "The Stanchurian Candidate", Stan gets disqualified from running for mayor of Gravity Falls due to his extensive criminal record.
        
        **Anchorwoman:** Crimes include shoplifting, teaching bears to drive, a new crime he invented called "burglebezzlement", first-degree llamacide...  
        **Stan:** That llama knew too much!
        
    -   The rest of the news broadcast is dedicated to listing the rest of Stan's crimes, including "first-degree thermometer theft, pug trafficking, snacks evasion, pickpocketing, woodpecker baiting, impersonating a dentist, general indecency, golf cart theft, bingo fraud, telling jokes that just go on and on, I mean, I have things to do today, really".
        
        **Stan:** Whew, at least they didn't list any of the _bad_ ones. On an unrelated topic, I have a lot of cheap pugs and I need to move them fast.
        
-   _The Powerpuff Girls (1998)_: In "Twas the Fight Before Christmas", when Princess demand that the Girls prove that she's on Santa's naughty list, they proceed to list every bad thing she's done over the series.
-   _Rick and Morty_: While Rick's exact offenses aren't discernible, the length of the scrolling alien text and the look the guards give each other makes it clear the amount of trouble he's caused. Once Rick's in his cell, he sums it up more succinctly:
-   _Stunt Dawgs_: In one episode, Richard P. Fungus is shown a long parchment which he assumes to be a list of his sins. He's told it's the list's _index_.
-   In "A Trash Truck Christmas" from _Trash Truck_, Hank is trying to find out if his friends are naughty or nice. Trash Truck, Walter and Mona all have some small incidents that are easily excused. Donny asks "Where do I begin?" and declares "I guess we'll start from January last year..." and begins long-winded recitation with several perspective shifts to the various characters and trailing-off sentences before "And lastly, that brings us to this morning, I rolled in something brown. I don't know what it was," and Hank telling him he doesn't think it's all bad so much as "raccoon stuff."

    Real Life 

-   When King Charles I was executed, the list of crimes was boringly detailed: "he, ... hath traitorously and maliciously levied war against the present Parliament, and the people therein represented, particularly upon or about the 30th day of June..."
    -   At his trial, Charles I was found guilty of treason, murder, rapine, burning, spoils, desolation, damage... and mischief. This last one is not really an example of Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking since the common law definition of 'mischief' involves destruction of property, which is known today as vandalism. Such definitions lead to the theoretical common law crime of "Malicious mischief and mayhem".
-   King Louis XVI was executed on 33 charges, the last of which was "You caused the blood of Frenchmen to flow".
-   The Declaration of Independence is mostly devoted to enumerating the Crimes of King George III. (The full list is here.) There's a reason people only remember the first paragraph, which ends: "The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world:..."
    
    _5._ "He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people."  
    _24._ "He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people."  
    _27._ "He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages..."
    
    -   "...and sometimes pretends he doesn't recognize us at parties."
    -   Note that the list was misaimed: George III cared little of the Colonies until _after_ the Declaration, the administration of the Colonies was being done by _the Parliament_, and, in fact, had been instrumental in repealing some of the taxes hated by the colonials. In fact the crisis that ended with the American Revolution started because the Colonials had requested for either sending their own representatives in the Parliament of the Great Britain or their Representative Houses to become local parliaments (whichever the Parliament found more convenient to allow them their constitutional right of not being taxed without representation) only for the Parliament to reply they were already automatically represented by the House of Commons (in which the colonials had _no_ representatives). Had George III been more interested in the Colonies, the Revolution would have not happened. Then again, point 1, 13 and 28 deal exactly with that...
-   There's a Christian inspirational story about a man who dreams he's in a room where every wall is a filing cabinet and every cabinet is full of index cards recording each of his sins.
-   The Cluny abbey foundation charter of 910 threatens anyone who messes with the place with having their name taken out of the Book of Life, getting limbs chewed off by vermin, experiencing the torments of hell while still alive (as a torture-buddy of Judas), etc. Also they've got to pay a hundred pounds of gold.
-   Some religions (Islam being one) believe that two angels/spirits/what-have-you record all a person's good and bad deeds throughout their lives. When someone dies, the lists get read off to whatever deity does the judging.
-   Emile Zola's historic denunciation "_J'accuse_", charges pretty much everyone from the President on down with the antisemitic Dreyfus affair.
    
    But this letter is long, Mr. President, and it is time to conclude.  
    I accuse Major Du Paty de Clam as the diabolic workman of the miscarriage of justice, without knowing, I have wanted to believe it, and of then defending his harmful work, for three years, by the guiltiest and most absurd of machinations.  
    ...  
    I accuse the three handwriting experts, sirs Belhomme, Varinard and Couard, of submitting untrue and fraudulent reports, unless a medical examination declares them to be affected by a disease of sight and judgment.  
    I accuse the offices of the war of carrying out an abominable press campaign, particularly in the Flash and the Echo of Paris, to mislead the public and cover their fault.  
    Finally, I accuse the first council of war of violating the law by condemning a defendant with unrevealed evidence, and I accuse the second council of war of covering up this illegality, by order, by committing in his turn the legal crime of knowingly discharging the culprit.
    
    I have only one passion, that of the light, in the name of humanity which has suffered so and is entitled to happiness. My ignited protest is nothing more than the cry of my heart. That one thus dares to translate for me into court bases and that the investigation takes place at the great day!  
    I am waiting.
    
-   A defrocked priest in Canada was found guilty of raping dozens of children and a sled dog. Because the 31 charges of sexual offenses against children weren't enough, you have to throw in the dog too.
