Nice entrance. Either you’ve never heard of a door or you don't mind pulling glass out of your shorts.

_"Attention mafia types. Stop hanging out in buildings with skylights. They'll only get broken."_

The modern spin on the Sheet of Glass. Simply put, to get to or from the scene in a hurry, they jump through a window; a closed window. The shards of glass flying everywhere make it very dramatic.

Supernatural beings (especially vampires) love doing this. Humans can do it too but usually have the benefit of a motorcycle taking the impact. Ninjas, certain dark superheroes, and Special Forces do it via skylights from the ceiling, the latter normally using rope.

The power of the supernatural, body armor, being Made of Iron or Nigh Invulnerable, or dramatic entrance/exit is required to prevent one's skin from being torn to ribbons by this maneuver. Wrapping a cape or long jacket around yourself in a tumble helps too. In television and film, this visual effect is achieved thanks to using carefully crystallized sugar to stand in for glass. Needless to say, trying this with a real-life window can get you killed, since not only is non-Hollywood window glass tougher than you'd think, there's also all the lacerations you'll get from large shards, no matter what protective clothing you may be wearing - Don't Try This at Home.

Truly cool people never need to use the door. May cause an Impact Silhouette. See also Soft Glass, compare Dangerous Windows. Compare Fast-Roping and Crash in Through the Ceiling. Contrast Destination Defenestration, where someone is thrown through a window against their own will. A sub-trope of No Escape but Down (when used to exit the scene) or Big Entrance (when used to enter it). Not necessarily related to The Window or the Stairs, despite the name.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Otcho in _20th Century Boys_ does a very impressive one, not in the least because he's over 55 years old.
-   In _The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer_, the scene described below in Literature is quite dramatic. During Moff Potter's murder trial, Tom finally confesses to witnessing Injun Joe commit the murder. The villain tries to kill Tom, but is forced to flee by the sheriff and he leaps through the courthouse window, in slow-motion, with nary a scratch. But then, Injun Joe _is_ pretty strong, not to mention _huge_ and therefore invulnerable.
-   In _Angel Beats!_, this happens twice in the first episode. It's more played for laughs since the characters didn't exactly do it on purpose. Or with a secure landing.
-   In the CG-animated _Appleseed_, several cyborgs bust through the stained glass windows of a church to surround Deunan. In the sequel film, Briareos does it. Twice.
-   An immortal leaps out a window in _Baccano!_ to escape the one thing that can truly kill him.
-   _Berserk_'s Skull Knight does this to a _solar eclipse_ when he rides in to save Guts and Casca during the Eclipse.
-   Sebastian and Grell in episode 17 of _Black Butler_, through stained glass, to rescue Ciel.
-   Suzaku does this through stained glass in episode 16 of _Code Geass_ - as per Lelouch's plan, of course, since Suzaku isn't that flashy.
-   In _Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door_, Spike jumps through a train window to get to the villain. He shoots the window first, so it'll shatter easily, and is apparently protected from injury by just being that badass.
-   In a manga chapter in _Doraemon_, the titular character does this at the sight of a mouse.
-   _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_: Batou bursts through the window of a hotel room to rescue Imakurusu from the DEA.
-   _Great Teacher Onizuka_: When rescuing Miyabi and her friends, Onizuka combines this with Dynamic Entry and Fast-Roping _from a freaking blimp_ to crash through the hotel suite window.
-   In _GTO: The Early Years_, Ryuji escapes Saejima and Kamata's No-Holds-Barred Beatdown by jumping through a plate-glass window (with his hands still tied behind his back).
-   In their climatic fight scene in _Gunslinger Girl: Il Teatrino_ Pinocchio throws Triela through a (closed) window, only to have her smash through another window after him just moments later.
-   Mori the Ninja Maid does this in _Haruhi-chan_. _Just_ for this trope, she and her butler partner get out a trampoline so that she can do this on the second floor of the school. "I'm just a passing maid!" Kyon: LIAR! Given her later abilities, she probably didn't need the trampoline.
-   In _Hayate the Combat Butler_, Hayate jumps through (or is thrown through) windows without any protection, as just one of his near-superhuman abilities. Klaus does this later on, as well, but he was spoofing an immortal vampire at the time.
-   America from _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ did this twice in episode 13 of the fifth season. The first time he ended up with a shard of glass stuck in his forehead, although he was uninjured the second time. When a little kid asked him why he went through the window, he claimed it was because he had just gotten back from Hollywood.
-   _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_:
    -   _Stardust Crusaders_: Joseph and Avdol get out of the women's bathroom by jumping out of the bathroom's window, partially because Mariah did the same, and they wanted to get away from the embarrassing position of being thought of as peeping toms.

-   In the first episode of _K_, before the opening, Misaki Yata does this into a gangster's hotel suite, on his skateboard, _from the roof of the building across the street_, establishing early on his views on the idea of practicality vs. _awesome_.
-   _Lupin III_ has many characters doing variations on it. The titular thief has bailed through several windows, open and closed alike, in the course of his career. _Lupin III: Part II_ had Jigen do it just before _shooting down a helicopter with a revolver_ in the first opening sequence.
-   Subaru of _Lyrical Nanoha_ jumps through glass windows at times, but it is eventually justified since she's revealed to be a cyborg.

-   In the _PandoraHearts_ anime, the Baskervilles make their first appearance by jumping through the windows in the church where Oz is having his coming-of-age ceremony. Given the Baskervilles' near-invulnerability to physical injuries, it makes sense that they are not shown to be injured as a result of this.
-   Used totally straight in the _Princess Tutu_ episode "Black Shoes", when Fakir jumps through a window to face the Dark Magical Girl, and then proceeds to pick up a glass shard from the window to use as a weapon. He has no powers that would protect him from the glass, and he's only wearing his school uniform...he's just fond of being very dramatic and badass.
-   B-Ko smashes a window in the palace section of the alien ship in _Project A-Ko_ to get in. She's protected by her special (and skimpy) armour but somehow C-Ko, sitting motionless in the room, is unsliced.
-   The various from _Ranma ½_ would indulge in this from time to time, but there was a subversion early in the story: after being tossed out an open (third-story) window, Ranma bounces back up from a tree branch to get back inside... only to smack solidly on the pane of glass when Akane closes the window on him.
-   Anita does this to rescue Nenene in _R.O.D the TV_, she does, however, cut a little "X" in the glass before impact.
-   In _Saint Seiya_, when Seiya is attacked by Shaina at his hospital room, he jumps through the window to escape from her, though it's somewhat downplayed due to the fact that the window is covered by curtains. Shaina quickly follows him shattering the remaining glass.

Frog_, where Keroro does a Super Window Jump into the bathroom to tell Natsumi she's not cleaning the bathtub properly... only to get knocked back _out_ the window for getting broken glass all over the floor. In one episode, Keroro is watching a movie where a hero jumps through a window into the villains' lair. He actually thought it was open, though.

-   Matsuri busts through a stained-glass window early on in _Sola_, but she's immortal, so whatever.
-   In _Sumomo Mo Momo Mo_, Uma Kamen bursts through a stained glass window in an outfit FAR too small to avoid the death of a thousand razors. None of the debris even reaches the ground to harm the non-martial artists in the wedding ceremony.
-   In _Tokyo Shinobi Squad_, shinobi frequently burst through windows when they're in a hurry, particularly when they're trying to assassinate someone.
-   Abel Nightroad, from _Trinity Blood_ does this twice, and even says something about it. "This is becoming something of a habit for me, it seems.
-   In an early episode of _You Are Being Summoned, Azazel_, a Gonk NEET does this in an attempt to escape Akutabe. It goes as well as you'd expect.
-   Seto Kaiba did this once in the _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ anime; so did Edo Phoenix in _GX_.

    -   In "A Black & White World", one story in the _Batman: Black and White_ anthology series, Batman comes crashing down through a glass ceiling while the Joker is mid-speech.

    -   Like his mentor, Robin usually plays this one straight, but in one of the last issues of his own comic, the Boy Wonder tackles someone through a large window, and the internal monologue mentions, "I'm going to be picking glass out of my hair all night.

    -   Lampshaded by Catwoman in _Knightfall_. Chased and outnumbered by enemy agents, she got into an empty room.

Hidden behind the desk, she thought "Very stupid!"

-   _Edge of Spider-Verse (2023):_ This is how Kraven the Huntsman introduces himself to Princess Petra (a.k.a. Spinstress), dramatically smashing through a stained glass window after having leapt off a giant bird. Petra assumes he's attacking her, and yells that there was a perfectly good door.

-   Lucky Luke expects to have to get out this way when he enters a building, so he always parks his horse under the window. The only time it ever inconvenienced him in any way was when he did it through the _wrong_ window and, instead of a dramatic horseback escape, got a painful stomach landing.
    -   Once, he landed on a horse that wasn't Jolly Jumper. When JJ arrived, he explained to readers that he has his friends stationed under each of the saloon's windows, as he couldn't know which one Luke would escape through.

-   In _Robyn Hood: I Love NY_ #11, Robyn jumps through a closed window as part of her High-Dive Escape to get away from Alina Rose. Robyn is already pretty badly wounded at this point, so it is hard to tell if jumping through the glass cut her up any worse.

    -   Subverted in an issue of _Ultimate Spider-Man_, where Spidey attempts to enter Kingpin's skyline headquarters in this manner, only to discover the hard way that since his previous visit, Kingpin has had shatterproof glass installed. The three panels of Spidey hitting it then sliding down are tremendous.

-   Parodied in one issue of _Tales Designed to Thrizzle_ where two perpetually-frightened kids keep having people barge into their room by jumping through the windows. The third jumper lampshades that there's a three-for-the-price-of-two sale on windows at the store, so by breaking the third window, she was saving money.
-   Characters from _The Trigan Empire_ used to get away with this, despite the bare arms and legs exposed by their pseudo-Roman outfits. Trigo, for example, once escaped a room full of baddies by leaping through a window with his bare arm covering his eyes and his sandaled foot leading and maybe kicking the glass. Not a drop of blood anywhere!
-   Rorschach from _Watchmen_ jumped through a window to escape a building he had set on fire. Of course, it ended up pretty badly for him because he landed in a trash can, preventing escape from his pursuers, but still, he didn't seem to have any injuries from actually jumping through the window.

    Comic Strips 

-   Eduardo Baretto raised _Judge Parker_ above the other soap-comics with his artwork, his rendering of misandrist killer/stripper Dixie Julep diving out a window being an awesome moment.
-   In an old _Mickey Mouse_ comic strip, Mickey is so angry after an argument with Minnie he _walks through a ground-floor window_ without even flinching.

-   The skylight variation is used in _Kyon: Big Damn Hero_ when Kyon interrupts a meeting whilst holding a spy.

-   Averted in _13 Sins_. Elliot actually throws a chair through the window of the police station to smash out the glass before jumping.

-   In _Aliens_, after Hudson puts some holes into the pane to soften it up, Hicks jumps through the glass window (he's wearing body armor that would protect him from cut glass), into the room where Newt and Ripley are trapped and starts wrestling with a facehugger. A very badass moment.

-   Used in the climax of _Black Moon Rising_, when Quint and Nina jump from a skyscraper to another with the eponymous super car.
-   _The Bourne Ultimatum_ is guilty of this, where Jason Bourne leaps across an alleyway, through a closed window, jumps up and immediately starts fighting the assassin sent to kill him.

-   In _Die Hard_, John McClane does this and doesn't hurt himself, even though the rest of the movie realistically depicted him getting his feet horribly mangled due to the broken glass everywhere he had to walk on. The first kick didn't break the window, though, forcing him to shoot the glass.

-   Performed by Storm Shadow in _GI Joe The Rise Of Cobra_ during the last parts of the Paris chase.
-   _The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_ starts off with one. The introduction of Tuco (the ugly) consists of him crashing through a window to get outside after the building he's hiding in gets stormed by his enemies. In this case, he couldn't use the door because said enemies were blocking it.

-   The Western _The Long Riders_ (1980): An outlaw gang are trapped in a town's main street by a posse, so they escape by riding their horses through the windows of a store, then out another set of windows at the back. Why a store would also have large plate glass windows (which would have been very expensive to make and transport) on the side facing _away_ from the main street is not mentioned.
-   _The Magnificent Seven (2016)_: Chisolm rides his horse through the glass doors of a restaurant to ambush one of the fleeing Blackstone operatives. His horse is unharmed.

-   _Marvel Cinematic Universe_:
    -   After Hawkeye runs out of arrows in _The Avengers_, he swings down and crashes right through a massive window. He isn't badly hurt, but his pained body language seems to imply that he got poked by a few pieces of glass.
    -   While Tony Stark runs from Ellen Brandt in _Iron Man 3_, he jumps through a store glass window. His expression afterwards implies that it was painful at least.
    -   _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_:

        -   And earlier, when Cap grabs Natasha and jumps through a window to escape a grenade that's about to explode; in a blink-and-you-miss-it-moment, it's Natasha who breaks the window with a pistol shot just before they crash through it.
    -   _Thor: Ragnarok_: Thor escapes Hulk's room by jumping through the window. Subverted a moment before when he tries to break it with a ball first, and it just bounces back and hits Thor in the face.
-   _The Matrix_:
    -   Deconstructed in _The Matrix_. Trinity jumps through a glass window and gets her face cut for it.

He then makes a daring escape by tackling his way out the penthouse's window, broken glass and all, before landing on the back of a conveniently-parked truck.
-   Played straight in _Minority Report_, though the people coming through the skylight were armored police officers who, impliedly, do this sort of thing on a regular basis. However, they were coming down into someone's bedroom, where they _knew_ two people had just been having sex.
-   Played for dramatic tension rather than Dynamic Entry in _Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol_. Ethan Hunt has to free-climb up the outside of the highest building in the world to get to its well-protected server room. He does so using adhesive gloves, but as he's cutting his way through the glass, one of the gloves malfunctions. Cue Climb, Slip, Hang, Climb sequence, but Ethan's dropped his laser cutter so has to smash his way through the partly-cut window. It won't break, so he has to swing outwards (hanging by his one remaining glove) and kick his way through.

-   In _A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors_, Kristen dives through the closed window of her bedroom to escape Freddy. Justified as it is a dream and she has mad acrobatic skills in her dreams.
-   Subverted in _The Parole Officer_, when a character attempts to escape from a police officer in the bank he has just robbed by swinging out through a window, only to bounce off of it. He picks himself off the floor and sheepishly says "toughened glass" to which the officer replies _"Its a bank!"_.
-   Parodied in _Polar_ when a stoner tries jumping through the window to escape hitmen only to bounce off the glass. After the hit team kill him and leave, the window breaks.
-   Subverted _and_ played straight in the Tony Jaa movie _The Protector_. Tony's character fights a gang of extreme sports enthusiasts in some kind of abandoned industrial facility. They all spend several minutes fighting, chasing, and jumping through windows, and some of the gang are apparently doing it just to be dramatic and intimidating. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Then a guy on a four-wheeler chases Jaa's character down a hallway with large window at the end. Tony _doesn't_ jump through. He _runs vertically up the glass,_ and backflips off as the four-wheeler crashes through.
-   In _Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins_, Remo scratches the window of a gas chamber with a henchman's diamond tooth before diving through the window. However due to Special Effect Failure the "glass" shatters a split-second _before_ he contacts it.
-   _Resident Evil: Apocalypse_, Alice, into the church, with the motorcycle. Slightly justified in that Alice is supposed to have weird uber-kick-ass powers.

-   _Satan's Cheerleaders_: When Patti turns Emmy's spell against her, the two Angry Guard Dogs Lucifer and Diablo leap through closed windows to attack her.
-   Done to humorous effect in _Scott Pilgrim vs. The World_. The scene alone is worth the price of admission.
    
    **Knives**: Is Scott here?
    
    **Wallace**: Uh, you know what? (_Scott is visible in the camera taking a running start and jumping through the window to get outside to avoid meeting Knives_) He just left.
    
    **Knives**: (_oblivious to what just happened_) Really?
    
-   1994's _The Shadow_ does a variation on this. Villain Shiwan Khan jumps out a window, to be sure, but he first breaks the glass telekinetically. Farley Claymore later ends up diving through a window overlooking the lobby (three floors up) while trying to flee from the Shadow, notably after the Shadow used his powers to make him believe that it really was an exit. Well, at least the glass isn't gonna be an issue for long.
-   _Sheitan_: The boys flee the house and pile into Ladj's car. However, while Ladj is trying to start it, the enraged Joseph (who they thought they had left unconscious inside) jumps through one of the ground floor windows—curtains, glass and all—and comes charging towards them.
-   Kane escapes from the Devil's Reaper by jumping through a stained glass window in _Solomon Kane_.
-   The eponymous character in _Spawn (1997)_. Justified with his costume and cape acting as armor and Spawn being undead and thus unharmed even by bullets. That, and the fact that the movie hardly takes itself seriously.
-   Prince Septimus does this during his High-Dive Escape in _Stardust_.
-   _Star Trek Into Darkness_: Harrison crashes through a large glass window while fleeing from Spock, and gives it about as much attention as the air he was running through a moment before. Justified in that his genetic engineering makes him Nigh-Invulnerable.
-   In _Star Wars: Attack of the Clones_, Obi-Wan jumps through the window to grab the killer-bug carrying droid. (Although, as the _Darths & Droids_ annotation points out, you'd expect Anakin to do this instead of him.)
-   _Superman II_, when the three Kryptonian criminals invade the _Daily Planet_: "When are these people ever going to learn to use a doorknob?"
-   In the beginning of _Super Cop 2_, the titular character's Love Interest David jumps off a fifth-storey balconey after realizing there's a Time Bomb behind him. He survives by landing in a tarp.

    Literature 

-   Injun Joe's running away from the Muff Potter's trial in _The Adventures of Tom Sawyer_.
-   "Angel Down, Sussex": After the alien being's human guise is unmasked, she escapes by leaping through a closed window. When one of the characters catches up to her, she appears to be unharmed.
-   _Artemis Fowl_: Butler does something similar when he crashes through a (supposedly) impenetrable glass door.
-   Interestingly, in light of the notes on vampires above, _Dracula_, in the Bram Stoker novel of the same name, only does this once despite his preference for windows above doors. In other instances, he either slides into cracks between the window and frame, or he has something else break the glass for him. In the example of this trope, however, it's daytime and he can't change forms, but is still tough enough to just leap through the pane.
-   The first _Franny K. Stein_ book, _Lunch Walks Among Us_, had the Pumpkin-Crab Monster jump through a window after kidnapping Franny's teacher Ms. Shelly.
-   In _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_, believe it or not: Severus Snape does this. With an Impact Silhouette, no less.
-   _Mistborn: The Original Trilogy_: The Final Battle of the first book takes place at the top of a tower whose exterior wall is made entirely of a single, cylindrical sheet of multicoloured stained glass. Vin, whose Mistborn powers include Not Quite Flight and shooting coins, enters by first piecing the glass with a series of coins, then crashing through the weakened section. The scene is written from the perspective of one of the villains, who first sees a single coin shoot through the glass and roll across the floor, then more coins, then _POW_. Brandon Sanderson knows how to write awesome.
-   In _The Sour Lemon Score_, Parker escapes from George Uhl's ambush by diving through the farmhouse window when Uhl shoots Bernie Weiss. The house is so dilapidated that he takes most of the most of the window frame with him.
-   _Rachel Griffin_: Used in _The Unexpected Enlightenment of Rachel Griffin_: the eponymous Rachel fails to open a window with magic and is forced to crash through it on her Flying Broomstick. The result is not described directly, but Rachel has difficulty persuading the next person she talks to that I Can Still Fight!.
-   _Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Was Not_: In "The Locked Cell Murder", Amelia Van Helsing enters the story by leaping through the skylight of a warehouse to save Holmes from a gang of cultists.
-   Skulduggery Pleasant does this all the time. Museums, private houses, villas, evil lair... no window is safe. His lack of any wounds is justified, as he's a walking skeleton.
-   _The Stainless Steel Rat's Revenge_. The Stainless Steel Rat does this the first time he's captured by the Grey Men. Only to find their leader has posted two guards outside the window.
-   _Star Wars Legends_: _Allegiance_ has Mara Jade performing this trope, though she uses fancy Force-assisted acrobatics to cut a round hole before she actually hits it. She does this to both a stone wall and a window, and notes that the window was much easier.
-   _The Thinking Machine_: Averted in "The Ghost Woman". A cracksman jumps through a closed windows anfd vanishes into the night. However, Van Dusen notes the amount the amount of blood on the broken glass, and states that one cannot crash through a closed window and fall 20 ft. to the ground without sustaining serious lacerations and injuries. He reasons the man would have had to seek medical attention, which is how he locates him.

    Live-Action TV 

-   A _24_ Day 8 episode deconstructed this; a suicide bomber broke out of the window when he was surrounded by Jack Bauer and his crew, but ended up limping as he walks into the oxygen chamber.
-   In _The Adventures of Superman_, George Reeves as the title character wouldn't bother finding a window — he'd just break through a _wall_. (One, he's **Superman**, dammit — and two, foam and papier mache debris was cheaper and safer than stunt glass.)
-   _Agent Carter_ has a tragic variation in the first season. Chief Dooley, trapped into a thermal suit that is building up toward an explosion, jumps out a window to avoid taking anybody else with him. He shoots the window first to weaken it, and injuries from the crash aren't an issue at this point.
-   _Arrow_
    -   Oliver Queen often does this in his Arrow guise as a Big Entrance. This backfires when he bursts in on Thea Queen this way and she responds by throwing a handful of broken glass in his face.
    -   In "Left Behind", a flashback scene shows Oliver's first attempt at this while working for ARGUS in Hong Kong. He fails to break the window even though his partner shoots the glass right before he hits it. After kicking the glass for a bit, he ends up entering.
    -   Combined with Outrun the Fireball in "Canaries" when Oliver and Roy Harper do this to escape from a suicide bomber by leaping through his apartment windows just after he presses the detonator.
    -   Oliver first meets the Black Canary when he's surrounded by a SWAT Team, only for the Canary to smash through an overhead skylight, then break every other sheet of glass in the room using her sonic device so she and Oliver can jump out the window while everyone else is clutching their ears in pain.
    -   In Season 6, Oliver is on trial for being the Arrow, so an Identity Impersonator enters the courtroom by crashing through the overhead skylight to further sell the idea that he's the real Green Arrow.
-   _The A-Team_ does this frequently. Usually by Murdock. One specific example occurs in "Say It With Bullets", where, during the raid on one of the villains' hideout, Hannibal and B.A. jump through the window to go after the bad guys. As usual for television, shards of glass fly everywhere, but they're not hurt at all.
-   Happens in the finale of _Birds of Prey (2002)_ when Barbara and Dinah swing into their villain-occupied headquarters through the gigantic clock tower window. Keep in mind Barbara is _paraplegic_.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ and _Angel_ heroes and villains are fond of this (the original film had an especially good one-take example).
    -   Buffy and Faith actually use this as a weapon in "Bad Girls" when they burst into a vampire nest through a painted-over window in broad daylight, setting one vampire on fire and causing the rest to flee in panic.
    -   In "Homecoming" Buffy and Cordelia are fighting a demon inside an abandoned shack when someone fires a grenade into it. Buffy grabs Cordelia and jumps through one window. The demon jumps through another window...only to bounce off the shutters, falling back onto the grenade.
    -   Spoofed when Angel does this and later complains about being billed for the broken window.

-   _CSI: NY_: During "Exit Strategy," a sniper hits the Crime Lab with a hail of bullets through Mac's office window. Seeing Lindsay cowering in a room across the hallway, he crashes through the glass wall, grabs her and pulls her to safety. Neither of them are cut by the glass... or hit with any of the shots still being fired (A few others are, none fatally, tho.)
-   In _Danger 5_, this is done Once per Episode by no one other than _Hitler_. The Danger 5 team, having fought their way through another slew of improbably freakish bad guys, will confront Hitler only for him to escape through the nearest window. Head first. Sometimes while he's duel-wielding machine guns. And in a Running Gag, it's always Stock Footage from the first time he does this. Our heroes only succeed in killing him (or so they think) when they finally corner Hitler in an undersea base which doesn't have windows. In Season 2 this is replaced by a Running Gag where they keep crashing through the walls of the cheap sets.
-   Happens in one episode of _Doc Martin_ when a young girl decides to jump off a moving car into a store window because she's uncontrollably hyperactived due to her mom having been giving her perscription drugs that were completely inappropriate for a child. The girl is very badly injured from this and Martin has a tough time treating her injuries to keep her alive long enough for an ambulance to arrive and get her to the hospital.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "The Android Invasion": The Fourth Doctor opens the door of a UNIT office to find his Evil Knockoff Robot Me, slams the door shut, and then leaps sideways through the window down onto the carpark storeys below.
    -   "The Seeds of Doom": The Fourth Doctor crashes straight down through a ceiling skylight to ambush the enemies in the room, defeating them all in the confusion with only his bare hands, retrieving someone's gun, pointing it at the room and announcing "I win."
    -   "The Girl in the Fireplace": The Tenth Doctor crashes through a window — on a horse, no less. Technically it was part Time Portal, part mirror, but 100% awesome!
    -   "The End of Time": The Tenth Doctor throws himself through a skylight. Only that time it actually hurt. And was horrible.
    -   "Closing Time": The Doctor comes to rescue Craig from the Cybermat by leaping through a closed glass door.
    -   "Heaven Sent": The Twelfth Doctor jumps out of a window and falls from a great height into the sea. The impact is enough to make him lose consciousness, but he isn't otherwise injured. He'd also thrown a chair out the window beforehand, which in addition to letting him calculate how long he has to fall while in midair, also presumably took enough of the glass with it that he could just dive through.
-   Ray Kowalski on _Due South_ did this on a motorcycle once.
-   In _Father Ted_, Father Jack repeatedly exits the parochial house by jumping through the window, whether it's fleeing in terror from a nun or just because he can't be bothered to use the door. Subverted when they install the Plexiglass. The window remains undamaged as Jack bounces to the floor.

-   Claire Bennett does this on _Heroes_ to get away from the Petrelli clan. And honestly, if Mama Petrelli cornered me in my real father's office, and he were on her side, and I _knew_ I'd regenerate from any wounds I suffered anyway, I'd jump out a 10-story window, too.
-   Done a couple of times in _Highlander: the Series_. It helps when you know you're immortal and will heal within minutes.
    -   Slan Quince both enters _and_ leaves this way when he first introduces himself to Duncan. (Complete with rubber sword blade hilariously boinging around in the slow-mo exit after hitting the window frame.)
    -   Richie Ryan escapes out a second-story warehouse window on a motorcycle.
-   In _The IT Crowd_, Denholm Renholm nonchalantly steps out of a thirtieth-floor window during a board meeting to off himself when some "irregularities in the pension fund" are exposed.
-   In _Jack of All Trades_. During a But Now I Must Go scene the masked hero tosses a coin to a flunky, saying it's for the broken window.
    
    **Flunky:** What broken window?  
    _(Jack gives a boisterous laugh and jumps through the window, shutters and all)_
    
-   A Running Gag in "La Oficina" sketch of the Chilean show _Jappening con Ja_ is having Espina open one of the office building's windows (and the office itself is located in one of the top stores of a rather high building) and throw himself off it whenever his "beloved" boss lectured him, screaming "Me castigo jefe, ME CASTIGO" ("I'm punishing myself, sir, I'm punishing myself!"). Then he would return to the office completely unharmed.
-   _Major Crimes_: In "Hindsight, Part 4", Amy and Coop arrive a motel just as a suspect flees a shootout by diving through a closed window. He gets up still shooting.
-   Col. Flagg tries this in an episode of _M\*A\*S\*H_, after telling the others in the room to look away since he has to leave like the wind, traceless. Crash.
    
    **Hawkeye**: _\[Looks out the shattered window\]_ "The Wind" just broke his leg.
    
-   In the _Miami Vice_ episode "Baby Blues," Crockett and Tubbs dive out of the windows of a building as it explodes behind them.
-   The Title Sequence of _The New Mike Hammer_ had Stacy Keach jumping out of one window, across an air shaft, to smash through a window on the opposite side.
-   _Mission: Impossible_: In "The Princess", the assassin twice escapes by jumping through a closed window. No reason is given why they do not open it first.
-   Gambit was fond of doing this when he was racing to the rescue in _The New Avengers_. He comes crashing through the window of a folly in "Dead Men are Dangerous", and a health farm in "the Deadly Angels".
-   _Poirot_: In _The Veiled Lady_, when both Hercule Poirot and Captain Hastings are cornered by the police for burglary, Poirot distracts them, allowing Hastings more time to run toward the windowed back door exit with the special Chinese fortune box in his hands. But by then the door is locked, so Hastings gets an awesome moment by jumping out through the window, smashing the glass from inside.
-   _Probe_'s "Quit-It": After breaking into one of the houses to steal the "Quit-It" drug, Austin is caught by Abbey, who then tells her parents. In order to escape, Austin leaps through a nearby window.
-   _The Professionals_
    -   The original intro had Cowley running a team of CI5 agents (including Bodie and Doyle) through a battle course, including a scene where they have to simultaneously dive through four free-standing French doors, do an Unnecessary Combat Roll and come up firing. It was replaced by the more familiar 'car smashing through a plate-glass window' sequence.
    -   In "Servant with Two Masters", Cowley turns up at the CI5 training area. We then see Bodie and Doyle sitting on a ledge holding ropes. They then jump off the ledge and swing through a window glass and all, landing on a mattress at Cowley's feet.
    -   In "First Night", CI5 weld a pointed steel Battering Ram on the front of a truck-mounted lift platform—which an Uzi-armed Bodie is riding—to smash through the upstairs window to a room where an Israeli minister is being held hostage.

-   _SCTV_ - hippie tv show host Dr. Braino (John Candy) gets too high and does it - then does it again in the only other skit he's in.
-   In _Sherlock_, one of Anderson's theories about the Reichenbach Fall involves Sherlock crashing through a window after bungee-jumping off the roof.
-   In _Smallville_, Kyla Willowbrook _died_ attempting one of these. Clark does this all the time, but that's justified.
-   _Spaced_ had a brilliant moment with Simon Pegg and a surprise window exit.
-   Daniel Jackson pulls this in an episode of _Stargate SG-1_. He has to shoot the glass ahead of time, but manages to get through without injury (of course, the radiation on the other side was not so accommodating).
-   Sam and Dean in _Supernatural_ do this to escape from the demon Alistair. Unfortunately for them, they aren't made of steel - the following scene has them pulling shards of glass out of their bodies, and Dean even having dislocated his shoulder from the fall. It's logically treated as a Godzilla Threshold sort of thing, with their options being "jump out the window and hopefully survive" or "stay inside with the angry psychopathic demon with skills in torture who just laughed off our magic demon-killing knife."
    -   Played straight, parodied, and lampshaded in "The French Mistake", the one where Sam and Dean end up swapping places with the actors who play them in the TV series _Supernatural_ after being thrown through a window to get there (literally Breaking the Fourth Wall). On the other side, they've ruined the shot of the boys coming through the window, so the director and showrunner decide to fudge it with a freeze-frame (which we see going into commercial).
-   _S.W.A.T. (1975)_. Rod Perry does this in the Title Sequence, rising completely unharmed with his AR-15 in the fire position.
-   John does this in the pilot of _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_. Granted, he's trying to get away from a Terminator.

-   In the second episode of _Third Watch_, Maurice "Bosco" Boscorelli tackles an armed felon and they both go through a _second floor_ window.
-   _Van Helsing (2016)_: In the episode "Save Yourself", when Sam realizes he's losing his fight with Vanessa, he flees by jumping out a window, falling about three or four stories and vanishing by the time Vanessa and Julius reach the ground floor. This is treated as a case of Sam being Made of Iron, as Julius notes that even a vampire shouldn't be able to just walk away from a fall of that height.
-   _Walker, Texas Ranger_:
    -   During the tear-jerking final act of Season 4's "Flashpoint", this happens voluntarily to two IRA Terrorists after their leader (the father of one of the victims) is killed by Walker and Trivette, deciding it's better to die than go to prison.
-   _Wanted: Dead or Alive_: In "The Martin Poster", Andy Martin escapes from Josh by jumping through a closed window and running off with no cuts, abrrasions, bruises or any other damage.
-   Myka, Pete, and Claudia of _Warehouse 13_ all get trapped inside a house stored at the eponymous Warehouse. If they try to leave, the house simply warps space so that they are instead entering the house again. So Pete does the (semi) logical thing to do and jumps through a window instead. ...Which causes him to jump _in_ through the window right next to it.
-   _White Collar_: Neal grabs a banner, cuts one end free, and dramatically swings across a courtyard and straight through the window on the other side.
-   Omar Little did this to escape certain death on _The Wire_. Unusually for the trope he was badly injured by the move, but it was from a fourth-floor window. This was taken from Omar's real-life inspiration, Donnie Andrews, with one difference: Donnie jumped from the _sixth_ floor. The TV show had to turn it down to make it believable, and even then...
    
    **Marlo Stanfield**: That's some Spider-Man shit there.
    
-   _The X-Files_, episode "Colony": One of the clones jumps through a closed window to escape the alien bounty hunter.

    Music Videos 

-   Tori Amos executes a particularly random one a few seconds into the music video for "Pretty Good Year," jumping _into_ a building. The scene replays in reverse at the end. Chalk it up to the 'supernatural creature' category.
-   Billy Idol rides a motorcycle through a stained glass window in the video for "White Wedding".
    -   Harsher in Hindsight: While it didn't involve crashing through windows, he would later be injured in a motorcycle accident several years later.
-   In the "I Would Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That)" video by Meat Loaf, there's a scene where the Beast character drives through a window on a motorcycle and causes a chandelier to crash for good measure.

-   _Assassin's Creed: Revelations_: Altaïr crashes through the big window behind the Mentor's chair during his escape from Masyaf. It's a bit of a Despair Event Horizon since he's forced to leave the castle he called home in the hands of the Big Bad, not to mention the fact that he's leaving his wife's corpse in the garden.
-   Used as one of many possible takedowns in the _Batman: Arkham Series_.
-   _Call of Duty: Black Ops_: Double points here.
    -   Once during the campaign, while zip-lining INTO a window.
    -   In multi-player, diving through a window into a prone position, then offing an opponent within 2 seconds or so will get you a gamerscore achievement.
-   In _Chrono Cross_, Serge in Lynx form and co. smash through another stained glass window to escape a Nigh-Invulnerable robot.
-   Marle in _Chrono Trigger_ does this (in slow motion) to rescue her father on trial. Bonus points, though a _stained glass window_.
-   Doable in _Command & Conquer: Renegade_. Most windows that are big enough to jump through are breakable, which means if you get pinned down in the upper floors of that Hand of Nod you can make a hasty exit through the window.
-   The first _Crash Bandicoot_ pulls one of these off during its minimal backstory. Wherein Crash escaped the lab by running out the window.
-   _Deus Ex Universe_:
    -   Possible in _Deus Ex_, but only with ceiling glass, and unless you have something soft to break your fall or the right augments it will likely result in broken legs.Impossible to do with windows, as they have to be shot or otherwise broken before making the jump.
    -   Also doable in _Deus Ex: Human Revolution_, again only with ceiling glass, and only in one spot while infiltrating the port in Hengsha. You do need augments to avoid killing yourself in the process, but it _can_ be done completely stealthy (by activating your cloak before breaking the glass).
-   _Die Hard_ for the NES allows you to jump through a window, out of a building from thirty stories up. This kills you.
-   _Ensemble Stars!_ has Shu falling in Love at First Sight with Nazuna and jumping from a second-storey window to talk to him.
-   Hilarious example in _Fate/stay night_: in the Heaven's Feel path, Shirou and Kotomine have to quickly escape from a castle. Kotomine jumps out the window, and Shirou, after a moment's hesitation, follows. Problem is: they're on the eighth floor, and Kotomine is a very experienced magus who knows how to soften his landing. Shirou barely avoids crippling physical damage (he notes it's a miracle he didn't break anything), and afterward all his companions are staring in wonder at what a colossal idiot he is.
-   Lampshade hung in _Final Fantasy Legend II_: The main character's father _always_ leaves buildings through windows, leaving the other characters wondering aloud what the point is.
-   _Half-Life_: a scientist does this rather awesomely, only to die moments later. This is commented on in _Freeman's Mind_.
    -   It's entirely possible he'll run toward you, and even if he doesn't, you can save him by killing the zombies before they can hit him.
    -   Averted in the _Black Mesa_ remake, where a zombie behind the scientist throws him through the window.
-   In _Hatoful Boyfriend_, Anghel Higure seems to jump through his school's windows at least once a week.
-   The intro to _Jak X: Combat Racing_ has Jak drive through an aquarium and into a bar in order to rescue Daxter.
-   In _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_, Link, in wolf form, has to break through a window to get into one of the buildings. It's not particularly dramatic, but it _is_ effective without being harmful to Link.
-   _The Matrix: Path of Neo_ has a few examples. Notably, the SWAT teams on the skylight version, and Neo doing a normal window version to try and save somebody, being Made of Iron Neo doesn't take any damage.

-   In _Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater_, Snake can use this as an alternate escape route to escape the Ocelot Unit at Rassvet. However, the shattering glass will alert troops, so a better idea would be to punch out the glass before sunrise. Snake can also somersault though select windows in Granin's lab.
-   Played to the hilt in _Mirror's Edge_, where Faith goes through windows just like she goes through doors: with a hefty kick or shoulder charge and nary a pause. This is a Dystopia with a giant nanny state and a very overworked janitorial staff, so presumably safety glass has been mandated by law ''everywhere''.
-   _Nidhogg_ has the Wilds stage, which features buildings with glass windows that a player can break and/or dive kick out of.
-   In _Octogeddon_, the terrified humans escape the buildings attacked by Octogeddon this way. Amazingly, despite jumping from the highest floors of six- or ten-story buildings, they do not splatter on the ground - they land perfectly safely and run away as his they jumped from the lowest step of a staircase.
-   _Parasite Eve_: On Day 5, after Dr. Klamp spills the beans on his role, Eve combusts all living beings in the museum, Daniel and Maeda narrowly escape by jumping out a second floor window.
-   Averted with _PAYDAY: The Heist_. SWAT will usually use explosives to destroy windows before rappelling inside. You can't jump through a glass window yourself; you have to shoot out the glass first.
-   _Persona 5_: At the end of The Caper that serves as the game's Action Prologue, the protagonist escapes the casino he's robbing by jumping straight through a multi-story window and landing unscathed several stories below. His Mission Control calls him out for showing off and implies the only reason he did it was because it was "a stylish way to end a job." After all, he was _trying_ to be caught.
-   Possible by crouch-jumping through a window in _Postal 2_, though realistically you take a bit of damage. The police also tend to get very perturbed when you do it around them.
-   _Prince of Persia_:
    -   In _Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame_, the Prince begins his escape from the palace by jumping through a window. The gameplay begins at the exact moment he breaks through the glass.
    -   Level 4 of _Prince of Persia_ had a Super _Mirror_ Jump, which is how the Prince's Living Shadow gets away from him.
-   _Professor Layton and the Curious Village_: After Layton reveals that Chelmey is really Don Paolo, he exits Reinhold Manor by smashing through a closed window.
-   The NES game _Rescue: The Embassy Mission_ had your rescue operatives do this, as shown on the cover.
-   _Resident Evil_:
    -   _Resident Evil 3: Nemesis_: When Nicholai has Carlos gunpoint, one of their wounded teammates pulls out a grenade, prompting Nicholai to jump out a window before it went off.
    -   In _Resident Evil – Code: Veronica_, Steve jumps through a window in Bullet Time, a Shout-Out to the opening of _The Matrix_, to save Claire from a Bandersnatch.
    -   In _Resident Evil 4_, Leon is capable of jumping through windows without injury, simply by covering his face, which is good, because he tends to exit buildings this way. He also almost never climbs _down_ a ladder. Leon really takes it to the extreme in this game. Almost any window you can walk up to can be leapt through with no consequence (and thanks to the giant flashing button on the screen, it's encouraged). It's worth noting you can break a window and still jump through it, but it often just has Leon hop over the windowsill instead of diving through it. Hell, even Ada, who's wearing a skin-bearing qipao, can pull it off exactly like Leon, without getting a scratch.
-   _Secret Files_: Defied, in the second game. If you have Bishop Chester Parrey examine the window in the second room, he dismisses it as an escape route, as it's too high to jump.
-   _Shadow Guardian_: The Alexandria mission begins with Jason attacked by an enemy helicopter in his hotel. He escapes by jumping out a third-floor window, landing on an unfortunate mook, before retrieving the mook's machine-gun and starting a shootout with other mooks.
-   _Sly 2: Band of Thieves_: In the opening level, Sly jumps through one of the museum's windows to reach the rooftops. Carmelita follows after him with the same route.
-   _Sonic Adventure_'s Speed Highway has a tall building with a glass structure jutting out the sides; Sonic breaks the glass by standing on it for a second. From there, he runs down the building without being injured by falling shards.
-   The original _Syphon Filter_ has Logan jump through the Expo Center lobby's glass ceiling 50 feet up. He jumps through another window to enter Rhoemer's cathedral stronghold.
-   _Team Fortress 2_: This is Saxton Hale's preferred way of entry. To top it all off, he manages to succeed doing this while _jumping from a plane without a parachute_!
-   In _Timecrest_, the Player can peer pressure Ash into doing this to quickly leave a room before Petora returns. Doing this results in Ash breaking a few bones and locking them into becoming an earth mage.
-   The eternally cheerful and friendly Papyrus in _Undertale_ tries to encourage the protagonist to make friends with his friends, including the Hot-Blooded Hero Antagonist Undyne. His idea of leaving the two of them alone to get acquainted is to blatantly lie about needing to use the bathroom (not only do monsters generally not have that function<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , _Papyrus is a skeleton_) and then _take a flying leap out the window_, leaving glass shards in the house. If you look out of the window, Undyne just mentions that Papyrus usually nails the landing... so not only does Papyrus _regularly_ do this, apparently this time he failed in some unseen but comical manner.
-   Averted in the old click and drag game _Uninvited_, any attempt to break the windows to get out of the haunted house lead to you bleeding to death; no you can't clear the shards with a chair or something; it just doesn't work.
-   _WarioWare Gold_: Besides 5-Volt smashing the window with her fist to look at 9-Volt in _Sneaky Gamer_, one of the things that 5-Volt has that never appeared in _Game & Wario_ was, after a Scare Chord, doing this to enter 9-Volt's room. It's so quick, it can catch the player off guard if they are not prepared for this.
-   _X-COM_:
    -   All units in _XCOM: Enemy Unknown_ can, and will, bash their way through glass windows when they need to get to point B. Justified, as your XCOM soldiers are wearing body armor (and later Power Armor), the aliens are rather callous towards their infantry and most are strong enough anyway, and any surviving civilians during Terror missions are probably desperate/terrified enough that they won't care about the potential injuries.
    -   _XCOM 2_ records every single broken window and kicked-in door _across all games_ and posts the total to the official website. As of June 2017, the total cost of repair stands at nearly _$14 trillion_ for 21 million broken windows, amongst other damages.

    Web Animation

-   _RWBY_: In the Volume 4 Character Short, Ruby could exit the tower through the entrance she was tossed through; instead, she floats up the tower to smash through the huge, round window. Aided by her Semblance and Huntress training, the leap sends her soaring through the air, momentarily silhouetted by the broken moon, towards the Beringel she's fighting. It signifies the come-back part of the fight, where she finally gains the upper hand and defeats the monster.
-   _Team Fortress 2 - Meet The Pyro_: The BLU Sniper leaves a burning building via a second story window.

-   Ellen tries this in _El Goonish Shive_ shortly after her creation and subsequent Clone Angst, with added coolness from making her duplicate (or original?) throw her at the window. The coolness factor is negated when the window lacks any glass. And is a story up. THUMP.
-   Byron in _Guilded Age_ does this early in the story when the group comes to rescue Frigg. In his internal monologue, he mentions it's a good way to shake your opponents and build up your own confidence.

-   _Panthera_ uses this here when the Ovid building is collapsing because of Oosterhuis and they all need to get out _immediately_.
-   In _The Rifters_ it's not very obvious, but this is how Jo gets into Carnby's tower (see here).
-   In _Stand Still, Stay Silent_, Emil decides to set a building on fire upon escaping it along with Sigrun after finding out it's troll-infested, but in the heat of the moment forgets that Lalli may still be in it. Lalli escapes via doing this from a 2nd floor window. Lalli is later seen getting small glass shards out of his clothes.
-   In _Stick Man Stick Man_, a Corrupt Corporate Executive pulls one to escape. The height aspect is Lampshaded.
-   In _xkcd_, this is the logical conclusion to worrying about relationships.
