_"Everybody likes sex. It's a gas. We're just not afraid to admit it. Queer, straight, Black, white... It's all disco. You know why? Because one day, we're gonna be too old to fuck. And life's too short, if you ask me."_

— **Bobby-Lynne**, _X_

Simply put, this is the belief that old people don't have sex.

There is a longstanding idea that growing old stops sexuality dead in its tracks. This could be due to the notion that sex is too tiring for frail elderly bodies and the "equipment" no longer works. Likewise, this idea may be caused by the idea that sex is only for the young, beautiful, and fertile. Or maybe it comes from the wholesome ideal of grandparents or the idea that adults must uphold decorum and propriety past a certain age. It could also be from the stereotype that long-lasting couples eventually suffer from Dead Sparks. Or not realizing that there's no male equivalent to menopause and even very elderly men can still father children. Of course, it could simply come from the fact that many adult writers don't want to think of their parents' generation having sex.

In fiction, this stigma manifests as elderly characters being largely sterile; even December–December Romance works, which focus on elderly _romance_, may skimp on the hot and heavy bits of a relationship. Sexually active elderly characters will be treated as non-existent In-Universe, considered shocking or gross, or the butt of jokes. Elderly characters are more likely to wax poetic about when they were young and sexually attractive, implying that they aren't anymore.

This belief used to be prominent in LGBT+ circles. The focal characters of Queer Media would skew younger and no elderly LGBT people would be shown. This is becoming less prominent since more people of various ages have been coming out and the original population of "younger" LGBT+ characters are getting older.

This is part of why the Dirty Old Man and the Dirty Old Woman are considered off-putting or funny — not only do they unashamedly hit on characters much younger, but they're _old_ while doing so. However, the Cool Old Guy and the Cool Old Lady will often be more liberal and "hip" about sexual attitudes, and will often imply they were sexual in their youth, whether or not they are now. This may also be a reason for Parental Sexuality Squick, once one gets the _parent_ part out of the way.

In Real Life, this notion is becoming more and more discredited, as active sexuality is still considered a normal part of aging.

**In-Universe Examples Only**: Characters must express the idea that old people don't engage in intimate acts, or shock/disgust that they do, regardless of whether or not this is true for the work's elderly characters. Alternatively, an older person may outright say they haven't been having sex past a certain age, or their sex life can be played for laughs or faux horror.

    Fan Works 

-   _The Simpsons: Team L.A.S.H._: In "A Liv of Their Own", one of Mr. Burns' maids overhears him and his husband doing it (which is apparently something that happens often) and says to herself "You'd think with his age, he'd be a lot less… _active_."

    Film — Live-Action 

-   _Badhaai Ho_: Babli and Jeetu conceiving in middle age is a source of shock and shame, because this reminder of intimacy in middle age is highly unusual.
-   In _Gods and Monsters_, James Whale is an elderly, promiscuous gay man, and his gardener, whom he's sexually provoked, says Whale is too old to think about things like sex.
-   _The Object of My Affection_: Rodney is older, gay, and explicitly currently celibate, though it is never explained if this is a personal choice or a physiological problem.
-   Discussed in _X_, when Wayne first reassures the apprehensive Maxine that the elderly Howard's "pecker" probably hasn't gone up since before she was even born and later when Bobby-Lynne remarks that everyone eventually grows too old to screw anymore and life's too short to let that happen.
-   In _The Wicker Man (1973)_, one of the straightlaced Sgt. Howie's first experiences on Summerisle is swinging by the local pub, where the regulars all start singing a Bawdy Song called "The Landlord's Daughter". All the dirtiest lines are sung by the oldest men present. The actual landlord's daughter is much amused, although Howie is not.

    Jokes 

-   A man goes to a brothel but the only girl available is in her 90s. On seeing his expression of disgust, she says "Hey, I work The Oldest Profession there is, show some respect!" And the man replies "Yeah, but I didn't think I'd be dealing with one of the founding members!"

    Literature 

-   _Captain Underpants and the Plight of the Purple Porta-Potty People_: George and Harold are both _horrified_ by their grandparents' Big Damn Kiss.

(Henry, who is Abraham's father despite looking half his age, is more worried about Abraham getting his heart broken; Abraham laughs and says, "At my age, I should be so lucky! Shows it's still working.")
-   In the US version of _Getting On_, the nurses scramble for what to do when they realize that two of the patients in their geriatric extended-care wing have been getting it on, something that has apparently not happened before.

In a later episode, Robin and Barney accidentally catch her grandparents doing the deed.
-   _Metrosexuality_: Discussed. Max states many times that growing old is basically forbidden by queer culture.

-   Headmaster Groff in _Sex Education_ believes this. When his wife attempts to initiate sex after a years-long dry spell, he scoffs and dismisses it with "We're not 23 anymore, Maureen."

-   _Saturday Night Live_: In one of the "Ladies' Man" sketches, a caller talks about the benefits of Viagra. When asked, he reveals that he's 76 and his wife is 80, prompting Leon to have a brief No. Just... No moment.

-   _Sirens (US)_: In one episode, the guys try to get the image of a porn film involving a woman and a horse out of their heads. Then they burst in on two elderly people in the throes of passion, which grosses them out so much that they _nearly_ accept the woman and the horse.
-   _The White Lotus_: Bert's son Dom and grandson Albie express disgust at his tendency to flirt with every pretty young thing he sees in Sicily. Albie asks if he can still get it up.
    
    **Albie:** It just seems like the body would naturally stop getting hоrny once you're past the age of procreation, you know? Like at 50, you would just stop.  
    **Dom:** ...50? 50's not that old.\[...\]  
    **Bert:** I'm still virile, by the way. I could still impregnate a woman.

    Puppet Shows 

-   Jeff Dunham's puppet Walter was pretty shocked to learn that Jeff's grandparents were still sexually active well into their 80s, seeming to be a subscriber to this trope.

    **Walter** (as Jeff's grandparents): "Was it good for you?"

    "Who are you?"
