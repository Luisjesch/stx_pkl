Shame, shame, shame!

Ah, the Walk of Shame. The shameful jaunt with head turned down. Maybe some optional disguises out of your bedroom, hotel room, etc.

There are two types of Walk of Shame.

**After Sex**: Usually after a one-night stand, it is walking out of the bedroom, apartment, or home early in the morning with the same clothes you wore the night before or perhaps wearing no clothes at all. Some college students and average adults consider walking out of your one-night stand something to be more proud of than ashamed of, hence the existence of the "stride of pride". Seeing your roommate return home with messed up hair and wrinkled clothing can incite some interesting interactions. Naked People Trapped Outside usually defaults to this. This is the more **figurative** and/or **colloquial** version of the trope.

**Humiliation Gauntlet**: One was just involved in an embarrassing activity and having to go past a line of people aware of what happened. Unlike the former, there is nothing to be proud of. This could come after an Insignia Rip-Off Ritual or Rejection Ritual. If you are being escorted to the police vehicle in front of a crowd, that is a Perp Walk. This is the more **literal** and/or **traditional** version of the trope.

The aforementioned Perp Walk is a subtrope of this, involving getting arrested for an alleged crime where one is shown on a walk to the police car for a ride to jail.

Both instances are sometimes Truth in Television. Regardless, this is prime fodder for both dramatic and comedic possibilities. See also Sexiled.
