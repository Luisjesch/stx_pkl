Twice the blade for double the blood.

Dual Wielding characters use a weapon in each hand, which is cool. Do you know what's even cooler? Using a single weapon with two ends. It could be a stick with sword-blades on both ends, or maybe a double-bladed<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  sword with both blades coming out of the same end of the hilt (in the former case, the weapon is usually wielded like a bladed staff.) If a Double Weapon is light enough (or the wielder is strong enough), then it can be dual wielded for a total of _four_ blades. Fighting using a Double Weapon often involves a lot of spinning attacks.

In terms of Real Life effectiveness, these weapons could actually be quite effective in combat due to their inherent speed and versatility provided someone had the skill to use one. CARRYING a double bladed sword on the other hand would be a far more difficult affair (how do you sheathe it?), but few are the writers who let such details bother them. If you're really worried about it though, just invest in a Laser Blade.

Not to be confused with Dual Wielding. If the Double Weapon can be split into two single-bladed weapons, it is also a Bifurcated Weapon. If it's a fusion of two quite different weapons, it's a Mix-and-Match Weapon. Tends to be impossibly cool.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Digimon Frontier_: Beowulfmon's BFS called "Trinität" (which is German for "trinity") is made of the two wing blades of Garumumon. However, rather than having a sword with two ends in opposite directions, it has two large and thick blades parallel to each other that point to one direction.
-   _Digimon Data Squad_: ShineGreymon's GeoGrey Sword is an enormous double-bladed sword.
-   _My-HiME_:
    -   Akira's one-handed sword has two curved pointy blades.
    -   Shizuru's Whip Sword in _My-Otome_ has two straight blades in its default form, as does Rad's lance.
-   From the _Gundam_ multiverse:
    -   _Mobile Suit Gundam_: The Gelgoog, Zeon's answer to the Gundam, uses a twin Laser Blade officially called a beam naginata.
    -   _Gundam ZZ_: The Dreissen has a beam lancer, which is made by combining its tomahawk and saber weapons, letting it use either as the polearm version (or both blades at once).
    -   _Victory Gundam_: The Abigor, a one-off Zanscare design, wields a pair of beam scythes that can be combined at the butt end.
    -   _Gundam Wing_: Altron's twin beam trident; notably, in the TV series Wu Fei tends to wield it like a standard spear (only using one end) while in _Endless Waltz_ he takes advantage of both ends. The Master Grade model kit of Sandrock has the unique gimmick of being able to combine its heat shotels, which is exceptionally ludicrous since they're each as tall as Sandrock itself.
    -   _Gundam SEED_ was fairly fond of this, beginning with the Freedom and Justice Gundams' beam sabers and continuing in _Gundam SEED Destiny_ and _Gundam SEED Astray_. They even have a proper name for it: Ambidextrous Halberd Mode.
        -   The Sword Impulse Gundam from _Gundam SEED Destiny_ takes it up level with its anti-ship swords (BFSes with a beam running the length somewhat like a giant cheese slicer), which can be docked to form a truly massive double-ender, which the Impulse swings around with incredible ease.
    -   _Gundam 00_: The 00 Gundam can dock its GN Sword IIs into a single long lance; on at least one occasion, Setsuna throws it like a giant discus.
    -   _Gundam AGE_: The Ghirarga wields two spears that can be combined this way.
    -   This trope is prominent enough in the _Gundam_ franchise that the game _Gundam Breaker 2_ included Twin Blades as an entire class of usable melee weapons, featuring many of the examples listed above. Their advantages are that they hit multiple times very quickly and can Spin to Deflect Stuff.
-   The "Tek-Lancer" wielded by _Tekkaman Blade_, as well as the Lancers of Tekkamen Dagger and Evil.
    -   In _Tekkaman Blade II_, Tekkaman Aki's Lancer as well.
    -   And of course, the original Tekkaman's **SPACE LANCE!**
-   _Code Geass_: Suzaku's Knightmare Frame, the Lancelot double-wields two swords. The mass-production version, the Vincent, not only dual-wields, but the swords combine into a two-way lance.
    -   Not to be outdone, the Ace Custom KMF Tristan piloted by Gino Weinberg uses a foldable end-to-end weapons that look like either a two-way scythe...or anchors...
        -   Or Grendizer's Double Harken.
    -   The Lancelot Club, an original mecha from Visual Novel _Lost Colors_ that acts as the missing link between the Lancelot and Vincent, has the same lance-type swords.
-   Fate of _Lyrical Nanoha_ has Bardiche's Riot Zanber form, which is a pair of energy sabers connected by an energy thread. That's right, Fate endorses sword-chucks. They can also be combined to form an _even larger_ version of the weapon's Zanber form.
    -   Don't forget that the Zanber forms have _energy_ blades, so Riot Zanber is basically a pair of _**lightsaber-chucks**_
    -   _Force_ introduces Riot Blade II<small>◊</small>, where Fate combines the two energy sabers to form a Darth Maul-like double-ended energy saber.
-   _Bleach_: The Filler Villain Kageroza Ibana wields a Zanpakutou named "Raikou" (Thunder Lord) and it takes the form of a large, dual-headed voulge which can control time and space.
-   Hunter Steele gets his own doublesided blade in _Spider Riders_.
-   In _Inuyasha_, Sango's father wielded a spear with a large crescent-shaped blade on the other end. Another demon slayer (likely Sango's uncle or something) has a less plausible one, with a trident blade on one end of the shaft and a huge spiked ball on the other end.
-   Usui Uonuma from _Rurouni Kenshin_ wields a short spear with a blade on one tip and a massive ball on the other end. He's also capable of attacking with both ends in a seemingly endless stream of blows.
-   Tessai from _Ninja Scroll_ wields one with deadly proficiency that he also uses as a boomerang (of sorts). Being a giant, his double-sided blade comes across as dual claymores, rather than swords.
-   The main character of _Azumi_ wields a peculiar sword with a katana blade on one end and a dagger on the other.

    Comic Books 

-   Unusual lightsabers were overall more common before the current era of the Star Wars universe, in both _Legends_ and _Canon_, and most major storylines involved at least one character using a double-bladed saber.
    -   The double-bladed light saber was first seen in the EU Star Wars comic _Tales of the Jedi_, used by the Fallen Hero Exar Kun, apparently based on ancient sith designs (though the sith hadn't developed lightsabers yet at that point in time...). It also has a unique variation in that, while most double-bladed lightsabers has a longer shaft for greater ease of handling (but opening it up to being severed by a precise strike), Kun's saber was the length of a normal lightsaber, simply having an emitter at both ends. This, combined with the fact that it was the first double-bladed saber in recorded history, allowed him a great element of surprise in his duel with his old master, which ultimately won him the duel.
    -   Exar Kun's saber became a Chekhov's Gun in _Knights of the Old Republic_, after Demagol stole it from a covenant warehouse, and gave it to Jarael. During the final battle, Demagol is attacked by his daughter, and tries to grab Zayne's (single-bladed) saber with the force, but grabs Exar Kun's by accident. When igniting it, he impales them both.
    -   Keeve Trennis in _The High Republic 2021_ uses a double-bladed green saber that can be detached to form two sabers.
-   Mariah uses a collapsible, double-bladed weapon in _Sin City_.
-   In DC's old _Advanced Dungeons & Dragons_ comic, the centaur Timoth Eyesbright uses a double sword for a while until one blade breaks off in a fight; he apparently never gets it replaced afterwards. Notable in that the comic predates D&D's third edition (see below) by about a decade.
-   _The Ultimates_: The Colonel wields a double-bladed laser sword that's more than a little reminiscent of Darth Maul's lightsaber in _The Phantom Menace_. This is even given a Shout-Out in the story itself.

    Fan Works 

-   _Son of the Sannin_: During the Fourth Ninja War, Edo Tensei!Fugaku Uchiha's Susanoo wields two swords that can combine together into one, a la Darth Maul (fittingly, said Susanoo is described as being red with black edges).
-   _The Pirate's Soldier_: Shortly after Heero receives his own Master Key, Ryoko also gets one of her own, which can project energy blades from both ends.
-   _Vow of Nudity_: After her dual swords get ruined by rust monsters, Kay’la forges a double-bladed scimitar that becomes her weapon of choice.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The quintessential example is Darth Maul's double-bladed lightsaber<small>◊</small> from _Star Wars: The Phantom Menace._
-   _The Heroic Ones_: Li Chun-Hsiao, the youngest of the Tartan Princes and most capable of the warriors, use a double-sided spear in combat, which he use to take names throughout the movies in multiple large-scale battle scenes. The weapon's effectiveness is proven when Li battles the Bladesman Unit - twenty Elite Mooks who use gigantic halberds - and Li easily kills all of them in three minutes.
-   In _Kick-Ass_, Hitgirl uses a double-bladed polearm (which can also detach into two long-hilted swords) in her first battle.
-   Sentinel Prime has a double-ended broadsword in _Transformers: Dark of the Moon_. It looks an awful lot like the blade from a utility knife, but with the blade on the opposite side.
-   In the climactic showdown in _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990)_, the Shredder uses a two-sided spear.
-   _Shadow Whip_, a kung-fu film, has the whip-swinging heroine (duh) fighting a legion of Elite Mooks, all their members wielding two-sided spears.
-   In _Sinbad of the Seven Seas_, Sinbad's viking crewmember fights using a weapon with a morningstar on one end and a hammer on the other.
-   In _GI Joe The Rise Of Cobra_ and _G.I. Joe: Retaliation_, Storm Shadow dual wields katanas that he can combine at the ends.
-   Thanos wields a Titan-sized, double-bladed lance in the final battle of _Avengers: Endgame_. Presumably it's perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
-   _Rurouni Kenshin: The Final_, the movie adaptations of Otowa Hyoko and Yatsume Mumyoi have such weapons: the former has traded the hidden weapon usage for a pair of double-bladed curved scimitars he uses in an extremely unpredictable and frenetic fighting style, sometimes to attack even with his back turned at the enemy. Mumyoi, aside from his Wolverine Claws, has a curious polearm with a large set of claws on one hand and a smaller scythe blade on the other end, though he mostly uses the former.
-   _The Princess_: Linh has two swords which attach at the hilts to form a single dual-bladed one.

    Literature 

-   The Star Wars Expanded Universe actually makes a point of how dangerously impractical the double-ended lightsaber is, and how it tends to require exceptional skill to wield without injuring oneself. It is generally used by the Jedi for lightsaber training exercises (basically training to swordfight multiple opponents) using scaled-down training sabers (the beam only delivers a severe shock rather than cutting). In fact the double-bladed lightsaber was originally pioneered by another Sith Lord named Exar Kun over three thousand years earlier. Though he only seems to have used it once (to murder his former Jedi Master).
    -   In _Darth Bane: Path of Destruction_, the young Bane's lightsaber instructor teaches him that exotic lighsaber types like the double saber are in most cases inferior to an ordinary single-bladed version...except that your opponent will probably be used to fighting against opponents with an ordinary saber and will be thrown by unusual types. A double-bladed saber doesn't actually give you more options in a fight...but your opponent will think it does, which is just as good.
    -   _The Jedi Path_ makes a point that the most dangerous mistake one can make when fighting someone with a saberstaff is thinking that the blades are separate, which they are not. Unlike dualwielding, knowing the location of one blade on a saberstaff automatically means you know the other too.
-   The otters' javelins in the _Redwall_ series are double-sided, leading to Cludd's death in _Mossflower_. The otters spike several javelins into the ground before Cludd duels with Skipper, who then flings him into the air and causes him to land on the upward points.
-   _Scythe-arms_ in Chronicles of the Kencyrath by PC Hodgell are blade pairs attached to the fore-arm, with the longer blade jutting forward and the other back. They are used in pairs, ie one main blade and one spur on each forearm. Training with them easily dissolves into chaos, with inexperienced users not being able to keep track of the spurs.
-   Angela the Herbalist, from the Inheritance Cycle, uses a _Hûthvír_, a double-bladed weapon sacred to the dwarf of Dûrgrimst Quan, apparently having won it from a priest via gambling and a riddle game.
-   The two-headed light glaive is the weapon of choice for Fess in _Diamond Sword, Wooden Sword_ and sequels. During his tenure as an assassin he uses the double glaive exclusively; when he becomes a necromancer, he picks up also Martial Arts Staff and falchion skills.
-   Roger's spear that is sharpened on both ends (and his willingness to use it) is feared by many of the boys in _Lord of the Flies_.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Beastmaster_: The primary weapon of protagonist Dar is staff with a long blade on one end and a club head on the other. It can also seperate at the middle, forming two shorter weapons.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_: The Scythe had an axe at one end and a wooden stake at the other. All the better for vampire slaying.
-   _Deadliest Warrior_:
    -   _Persian Immortal vs. Celt Warrior_: The spear wielded by the Immortal featured a weighted metal orb on the butt, allowing for both sharp and blunt-force trauma.
-   _Game of Thrones_: Arya Stark wielded a quarterstaff double-bladed with dragonglass (i.e. obsidian) in the climactic battle against the White Walkers.
-   _Get Smart_: "The Day They Raided the Knights" (Season 4, Episode 16) KAOS has a new "Stereophonic Pistol": two revolvers, side-by-side, with a single grip and trigger. Subverted in the end: the "weapon" turns out to be a harmless gun-shaped radio: the manufacturer took "stereophonic pistol" literally.
-   _Kamen Rider_: Every few years someone gets one of these. These weapons are usually referred to in material as a naginata, despite not particularly resembling one.
    -   _Kamen Rider Kuuga_'s Rising forms upgrade his weapons; Rising Dragon form upgrades that form's Martial Arts Staff to a double bladed spear.
    -   _Kamen Rider Agito_'s Burning Form has the Shining Calibur, a double sword which he splits into two separate swords with his next upgrade.
    -   _Kamen Rider Gaim_ can combine his two swords end-to-end.
    -   _Kamen Rider Ghost_ has a double sword as one of the many forms of his Morph Weapon.
    -   _Kamen Rider Zero-One_ gets a new sword halfway through the show that joins at the pommel with his existing sword.
-   _Scrubs_: Knifewrench! — For kids!
-   _Star Trek_ has the Vulcan lirpa, first seen in "Amok Time".
    -   The Klingon bat'leth probably counts as well.
-   _Super Sentai_ / _Power Rangers_:
    -   _Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger_ / _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_: The lance used by Tricera Ranger/the first Blue Power Ranger, which, like many of these, could be split into two shorter weapons.
    -   _Mirai Sentai Timeranger_ / _Power Rangers Time Force_: Each of the core five has a double-ended sword that can be split into two short swords (this season didn't give everyone their own weapon of choice).
    -   _Gogo Sentai Boukenger_ / _Power Rangers Operation Overdrive_: Yaiba/Kamdor carries two swords that can be combined into a double-ended naginata.
    -   _Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger_'s Humongous Mecha Gokaioh normally Dual Wields cutlasses; when the team invokes the Greater Power of the Shinkenger, it docks the swords onto a long handle, turning it into a double-ended naginata.
    -   _Jikuu Senshi Spielban_ can create a double Laser Blade. In _VR Troopers_ it's called the Laser Lance.

    Roleplay 

-   _Destroy the Godmodder_ initially featured TwinBuilder's double-edged lightsaber in the first game. Many more Double Weapons were created in the second game as a result of the Alchemiter, with the most famous being Oblivion's Guardian, an upgraded version of Twin's lightsaber wielded by Build.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_ introduces a whole class of weapons based on the concept in its third edition _Player's Handbook_, which gives the trope its name:
    -   The two-bladed sword, which draws direct inspiration from Darth Maul's lightsaber. If _Neverwinter Nights_ is any indication, its combat advantage comes from how an opponent parrying one blade is bound to get slashed by the other. (Though the lack of reach means it would be inferior to Dual Wielding, and in some ways less effective than even a sword and shield, if it weren't for Exotic Weapon Supremacy.)
    -   The orc double axe, which has double-bitted axe-heads on both ends of the handle.
    -   The dire flail, which has flails on both ends and would look very silly if not for the company it keeps, and should be nearly impossible to use without hurting yourself.
    -   The dwarven urgrosh, with an axehead on one end and a spearhead on the other.
    -   The gnome hooked hammer, with a hammerhead on one end and a hook on the other.
    -   The Arms & Equipment Guide introduces the double scimitar, the double mace, and the gyrspike, a weapon with a sword on one end and a flail on the other.
    -   The double-scimitar returned in _Eberron_ as the trademark weapon of the Valenar Elves. Pointing out the impracticality of it will no doubt result in a first-hand demonstration of what the weapon is capable of, with you as the target.
    -   In 4e, their stupidity is justified by saving money on enhancements. There's also the fact that most double weapons have a different type of damage: most single weapons will give, say, 1d8, while a double weapon would give 2d4. While it doesn't increase the maximum, it DOES increase the minimum; add the "brutal X" enchantment which means you reroll any damage die that lands lower than X, on a class that gives multiple-weapon-damage-roll attacks, and you suddenly have a very high minimum damage range.
    -   And last but not least, the humble quarterstaff, which was upgraded to a double weapon, and the double mace, which is basically just a quarterstaff whose ends are weighted a bit heavier.
    -   5e's Polearm Master feat lets you use the butt of a polearm (halberd, spear, etc.) to make another attack once per turn, though it only deals 1d4.
-   Games Workshop:
    -   _Warhammer_:
        -   The Champions of Nurgle often use a staff with a sword on one end and a flail on the other.
        -   The Eternal Guards, the standard melee infantry of the Wood Elves, wield Asrai Spears that have enchanted, leaf-shaped blades at both ends.
    -   In _Warhammer: Age of Sigmar_, some Blood Warriors of the Bloodbound Warhordes wield a Goreglaive, a brutal polearm with a large and heavy axe blade at each end that is extremely effective at cleaving through armour.
    -   _Warhammer 40,000_:
        -   Drukhari Hellions (sky-surfing gladiators/berserkers) frequently use Hellglaives, long staves with wickedly hooked and barbed blades at either end.
        -   The Tau Ethereal Aun'shi uses an Honour Blade that is a staff with long sword-like blades at either end.
        -   The Kroot Rifle has blades incorporated into the barrel and stock in imitation of the traditional fighting staffs used by ancient Kroot warriors.
        -   The voidblades wielded by Necron nobles and the elite Triarch Praetorians consist of a pair of wide blades set either side of the weapon's hilt that can destabilize the molecular bonds of any material they cut through.
    -   _Gorkamorka_ has the demilune, a two-handed power weapon that is unique to the Mutie raiders who inhabit the most desolate regions that surround the Skid. A demilune consists of central haft with a deadly powered blade at each end, allowing a skilled wielder to fight off multiple opponents with easy sweeping attacks.
    -   In _Necromunda_, the double-bladed knife is a weapon unique to the Ash Waste Nomads. Although it isn’t any more deadly than a regular knife the Nomads use the double-bladed knife as a defensive weapon, and are so skilled in its use that they are able to parry attacks as easily as a warrior armed with regular swords.
-   _GURPS_: Martial Arts managed to dredge up an obscure example of these. The Qian Kun Ri Yue Dao features a sickle blade at each end and hand guards that have _another_ blade attached to each. A double, double weapon that's almost comically dangerous to the wielder. While the text translates it as "Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon _Sword_", it actually uses the Staff skill, but since it's such a complex weapon, it comes with a -1 modifier. For one possible way to think of this thing, look at the description, and compare it with the bat'leth mentioned above ...
-   _The Dark Eye_ has the Twinlilies, a staff with fleur-de-lis-shaped blades at each end. It was created as a form of Loophole Abuse: The citizenry of the city of Grangor was prohibited from carrying 'pole weapons with _one_ sharp blade' by imperial edict, so they created a polearm with _two_. It is acknowledged as a less-than-ideal weapon, but Grangorians still carry it as a point of pride.
-   _The One Ring_: High Elves have access to a unique double-ended great spear, which allows them to spend a Hope point upon scoring a Critical Hit in order to make a bonus attack.

    Video Games 

-   _ANNO: Mutationem_ has Ann's Dual Blades combined into its glaive form with blades on either side of the handle.
-   In _Azurik: Rise of Perathia_, the protagonist's main weapon is a double halberd referred to as the "Axion." subsequent upgrades add spikes to the weapon where the blade meets the staff, and even extra blades fanning out from the original pair.
-   In _Bayonetta 2_, the Masked Lumen/Balder uses the Holy Glaive, a golden staff with large blades on either end. He can split the weapon at will, however, if he wants to Dual Wield the blades as separate swords. One of the demons of Inferno called Hatred used a double-ended Sinister Scythe, which Bayonetta can occasionally steal and use herself (until it runs out of power and disintegrates).
-   _Bloody Spell_ has a pair of lightweight swords you can collect to Dual Wield, or alternatively, combine them from the handle.
-   _Castlevania_
    -   Halfway through his fight in _Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow_, Death converts his Sinister Scythe into a double-bladed version.
    -   The undead knight soul in _Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow_ makes Soma stand in place and twirl one of these around.
    -   In the _Castlevania: Lords of Shadow_ continuity, Gabriel's combat cross (a whip for all intents and purposes) gets a stake added on to the other end to allow him to finish off vampires. In the sequel, Alucard uses it as the pommel of his ever-iconic Alucard sword.
-   _Chain Dive_ have you playing as an assassin armed with a two-sided spear as your default weapon. It looks damn cool in action too.

-   _Dark Souls II_ introduces Twinblades as a class of weapons. Most of them require high Dexterity and some Strength to wield. While you can swing them one-handed, they have a much better moveset when wielded with both hands.
-   In _Dawn of the Dragons_, the Sword of Conquered Kingdoms was originally a pair of magical swords owned by the rulers of two allied kingdoms. When Carnus the War-Walker conquered these kingdoms, he took the swords from his defeated foes and used the blades to craft a single weapon.
-   _Dead Rising 2_: With the simple application of duct tape, Chuck Greene can create the Paddlesaw, a kayak paddle with a chainsaw attached to each end. Since there are two heavy chainsaws attached to the thing, a drawback of the weapon is that it can't be carried in the inventory.
-   _Dread Templar_ gives you dual blades as your first weapon, and you can attach them together by the hilt to create a long, two-sided weapon.
-   Wei Yan from the _Dynasty Warriors_ games has the "Double Voulge", which is really a double-ended sword.
    -   Looks like it really is a doubled headed Voulge to me. Maybe Double Glaive.
    -   More phenomenally, in _Dynasty Warriors 6_, Ultimate Badass of Ancient China, Lu Bu, dual-wields double-ended Naginata, sometimes singularly, sometimes combining them into a Swastika of Doom. It's not actually a very good weapon, but who cares? It is AWESOME! It's later on used by his daughter Lu Lingqi after Lu Bu gets his halberd back.
    -   In _Dynasty Warriors 5_ (And as a result, the _Warriors Orochi_ series), Cao Pi also wields a double-ended sword, which literally looks like two conventional, western broadswords attached end-to-end. During some attacks, he'll also split them up Dual Wielding combos. Sadly, he got downgraded to a boring ol' sword in 6, while his wife switched from an elegant flute to a whip. However, he gains his double sword back in _8_.
    -   Zhang Fei has his signature spear, the "Viper Blade", turned into one of these in _Dynasty Warriors 6_ and _7_.
    -   Jiang Wei in _Strikeforce 2_ and 8.
-   _Eastern Exorcist_ have the second-to-last boss of Lu Yun-chuan's campaign, and the _first_ boss of Xiahou-xue's, using two-sided weapons. The former, Mandrill King, carries a hefty staff with a pointed stip and blades at the bottom, while the latter, Snake Yaksha, carries a dual-sided glaive.
-   _Elden Ring_ brings back the Twinblade weapons from its Dark Souls predecessors. Of course, now you can dual-wield them, allowing you to sling around four blades for massive damage. It's particularly effective when combined with bleeding.
-   Haken Browning's Night Fowler in _Endless Frontier_ is not only an assault rifle with a pile bunker for a bayonet, it also contains a folding blade in the stock.
-   _Evil Genome_ has a Recurring Boss, Joseph, who carried a two-sided laser-powered BFS that he uses to rough you up in all three of his boss encounters.
-   _Final Fantasy_ has a few examples of these, most of which double as Bifurcated Weapons.
    -   Zidane can go from single daggers to double-ended swords (referred to in-game as "thief swords") in _Final Fantasy IX_. In _Dissidia Final Fantasy_, this becomes a Bifurcated Weapon, with two Mage Mashers combining into The Ogre and separating again as needed.
    -   In _Final Fantasy XII_, Judge Magister Gabranth wields a dual-bladed weapon that he can pull apart into its component blades - the larger _Chaos Blade_, and the smaller _Highway Star_. Most of the time, though, he joins them at the hilt into a lance-type weapon.
    -   The Odin of _Final Fantasy XIII_ carries the Gagnrad, a pair of curved blades emerging in opposite directions from the same handle; they're almost as tall as he is when combined. Lightning gains access to similar weapons in _Lightning Returns_, although most of them are smaller; the Final Boss, Bhunivelze, also uses a massive double-bladed _scythe_\-looking thing formed from the gods Pulse and Lindzei.
    -   The Viper job, introduced in _Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail_, uses a pair of swords that can be linked together into a double-sword configuration for increased damage.
-   The Dual Katana, Club, Naginata, and Shuriken from _Fire Emblem Fates_ have this design. They also reverse the game's weapon triangle system and double the strength of its effects.
-   Skorge of _Gears of War 2_ carries a double-ended _chainsaw staff._ It can cut a tank in half in three to four seconds.
    -   And yet it cannot cut through a standard issue COG assault rifle? Sounds like some bad tank construction there.
        -   The reason neither cuts through the other is because the chainsaw bayonet on the Lancer is made from the same thing as Skorge's staff "blades". Why either works after one lock, however...
-   In _Genji_, Kagekiyo normally wields a longsword, but during the opening movie and the second boss battle he combines his swords in a double-bladed spear.
-   Tacos, the second-to-last boss from _Golden Force_ uses a two-sided BFS to rough you up. And it can be thrown as a Precision-Guided Boomerang to home in on you from a distance.
-   In _Grand Chase_, Ryan can merge his Storm Blades to become a Double Weapon.
-   _Hero of Sparta_ has the Lightning Spear, a powerful two-sided weapon where each side can electrocute enemies on contact.
-   One of the enemies in _Kâbus 22_ wields a staff with a blade on each end.
-   In the final battle of _Kingdom Hearts_, Ansem wields a weapon that is basically two copies of Riku's Soul Eater (a sword in the shape of a demonic wing), joined at the pommel.
-   Kirby wields a yellow double lightsaber with the Electric + Blade powers in _Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards_.
-   _Samurai: Way of the Warrior_ have Giant Mook enemy brutes who use two-sided BFS weapons on you, as a rather blatant reference to Tessai from _Ninja Scroll_.
-   Bastila Shan of _Knights of the Old Republic_ wields a dual-bladed lightsaber. In _Star Wars: The Old Republic_ they're wielded by her descendant Satele Shan, the Jedi Shadow and Sith Assassin classes, and various NPCs.
-   In _MadWorld_, the 'Shogun' boss wields what can only be described as a double-ended circular saw. A stick with a huge saw-blade at either end. Or maybe it's more like a chainsaw... either way, you don't want to get hit by it.
-   The mercenary Zach from _MARDEK_ uses a doublesword, although he only ever seems to use one of the blades.
-   In _Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance_, Mistral wields a polearm...made out of interconnected robot arms that also allow it to be used as a whip.
-   _Neopets_ has an item that takes this to an extreme - a four-headed axe.
-   _No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle_: Kimmy Howell has the double lightsaber, partly to differentiate herself from her idol, Travis Touchdown.
-   _Onimusha_ has Shippu and Senpumaru, double naginata which grows thicker (the former) or add blades (the latter) as they're powered up. They also have Wind powers.

-   A whole class of Double Saber weapons exists in the post-Algol _Phantasy Star_ games (_Online, Portable, Universe, Zero_).
-   _R.O.H.A.N. Online_ has the Zhen, a dual-bladed sword wielded by the dragonlike Dekan warriors. One of the Dekan's skills is to split the Zhen in two for Dual Wielding.
-   In _Rise of the Kasai_, each playable character uses one as their medium range melee weapon. Rau uses a taiaha, which has a blunt end for bludgeoning and a bladed tip for slashing. Tati has a batton type weapon with retractable blades on either end that further separate into three blades each. Baumusu uses a staff with spiked mace heads on either end, and Grizz uses a polearms with two long blades on either end.
-   In _Samurai Warriors 4_, Nobuyuki Sanada's weapon of choice is a double-bladed katana. It's default mode is a single large sword, with the second blade being a retractable blade hidden in the hilt.
-   In _Sengoku Basara_, Shibata Katsuie uses a double voulge as his weapon. Most of his moveset involves a lot of Weapon Twirling and a major part of his gameplay is to keep up the momentum of his weapon to maximise damage output and speed.
-   The signature weapon of Chill from _Skylanders: Giants_, a double "javelin" made from ice. Then again, she throws said weapon like a boomerang, rather than using it for close combat, so one could say that the double-bladed weapon gives it proper balance for throwing.
-   _Soulcalibur VI_ newcomer Grøh uses two swords that fuse at the hilt, allowing him to fight with the weapon as a single, two-bladed weapon or split for Dual Wielding. His gameplay makes use of this as a Stance System.
-   The secondary weapon of Cervantes from the _Soul Series_ is a short sword with a pistol built into its hilt.
-   The Dual Squelcher from _Splatoon_ is a very unorthodox type of double-barreled gun, with the second barrel being attached to the _bottom_ of the gun. _Splatoon 2_ onwards splits this weapon into the Dualie Squelchers, a Bifurcated Weapon that uses each of the barrels as its own separate gun.
-   In _Starcraft II_, the Dark Templar trade in their wrist-mounted warp blades for two-headed warp scythes, with blades on opposite sides. One wonders how they avoid stabbing themselves in the back.

-   In _Suikoden Tactics_, the main character Kyril has a double bladed weapon like Serge from _Chrono Cross_.
-   _Super Smash Bros. Brawl_ lets Pit turn his bow into a double-bladed stick that he can rapidly spin and slice targets with.
-   _Tales Series_:
    -   Yuan from _Tales of Symphonia_ has an especially impractical double-ended greatsword when you fight him. Although to be entirely fair, he does have Super-Strength due to being one of the Four Seraphim, and if you look closely you'll see that each blade has an additional grip in the middle, making it wield more like a bladed staff than a sword.
    -   _Tales of Graces_: Hubert's dualblade is two swords, connected at the handle. He can separate them into two one-handed swords, as well as turn it into two pistols.
-   In _Vindictus_, some of Lann's attacks combines his Twin Spears to a Double Weapon. Also, Warlord Black Hammer has a double-sided hammer.
-   _Wallachia: Reign of Dracula_: Barbaros, the first Boss Fight of the game, wields a double-ended blade.
-   _Warcraft_:
    -   Illidan Stormrage uses two double ended weapons, basically double-bladed scimitars in either hand. In fact this is the weapon set most demon hunters use. They also bind a demon into their body that will try to take control of them. And they're all blind (although they do have a magical sight to compensate). It's mentioned that the fatality rate for demon hunters in training is very high, and no wonder.
    -   Pit Lords also favour double ended weapons. They usually wield two-handed warglaives that resemble shortened spears with a huge blade on each end.
    -   In both of the cases, the double bladed weapon could be considered to be symbolic. Demon hunter's power is very much a double-ended sword: they use demonic magic to become very effective at fighting demons, but must risk being consumed by the powers they sought to use. Pit Lords on the other hand don't care whose blood flows, as long as there is battle and somebody dies, be it them or their enemy.
    -   Troll Shadow Hunters also tend to use double swords because, uhm, Voodoo?
        -   Vol'jin especially makes a great use of one in _Vol'jin: Shadows of the Horde_, parrying with one side of the sword and using the momentum to spin the other side past the enemy's defense
    -   The Frozen Throne expansion also gave us the Blood Elf "Spellbreakers", who carried a tower shield in one hand and a dual-bladed sword in the other. It looked kind of like someone took the blade out of a lawnmower and made it 6 feet long with a handle in the middle, then made it fancy in the elvish tradition. It was wielded the same way. Despite that being the only significant appearance of the unit, the weapons apparently were iconic enough that the tall shield and double-bladed sword would be utilized for the appearance of the generic city guards of the Blood Elves in _World of Warcraft_.
-   At least two weapons in _Warriors of Might and Magic_ are this: the Chien's Halbeard, which is a sort of double-naginata like weapon and the "Clapper" a double ''Morning Star''.
-   In _Wynncraft_, Tier III Thunder spears have a blade at each end.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles 3_: Ashera, the leader of Colony 11, uses an appropriately named "Twinsaber" - a double-ended sword. She in an evasion tank character with a strond damage potential, referencing both the deftness, necessary to wield it, and the obvious aggressive nature of such a weapon. The main party can use it through the game's Job System.

    Web Animation 

-   _Homestar Runner_: "I had to swing by Cool Weapons Surplus for a new nunchuck-gun."

    Webcomics 

-   _8-Bit Theater_: "Sword-chucks, yo!" (Throughout the series, Fighter also has a penchant for trying to make chucks out of increasingly improbable weapons.)
-   _The Adventures of Dr. McNinja_: Oh how stupid of me. That was the sound of chainsaw nunchucks.
-   Lampshaded, mocked, and still used straight in _Errant Story_. The leader of the local time-ninja-guild wields a double-ended energy-crystal blade to lethal effect, and the party's recently-recruited time-ninja does the same... however, while dueling her, Sarine takes the time to point out just how impractical a weapon it is, combining the worst traits of sword and spear in one crappy package, and revealing that it was originally created as a show-weapon for fake duels and parades only. She also proves the truth in her statement, but despite all this, Sara continues to kick ass with her double-bladed energy-crystal-stick, against basically anyone who isn't an immortal Action Girl. Mind you, Sara uses time magic to move so fast she can dodge bullets. She'd probably do just as well even if she was armed with a cardboard tube.
-   Rosemary in _The Mansion of E_ has the "Can Opener," which is an open homage to _Star Trek's_ Lirpa, listed above.
-   Feferi Peixes of _Homestuck_ has 2X3DENTKIND as her STRIFE SPECIBUS. Later it's shown that her ancestor The Condesce and said ancestor's Alternate Self Meenah both use the same type of gilded double ended trident in battle.
-   _Legostar Galactica_: Dr. Belinda Reines's weapon of choice is a double-bladed lightsaber that she wields to great effect.

    Web Original 

-   A common weapon type in _Chaos Fighters_. The most common among them are double sword lances, but double spears, double lances, double wands and double axes (on sides rather ends) appears occasionally. A double scythe was also appeared with two variants.
-   The Counter Monkey episode "The Age of Manure" has Bennett the Sage visit with some documents from his friend's old Dungeons & Dragons games. One thing he shows off is some weapons the friend designed, which include the double club, the double spiked club, the double knife, and double serrated sword<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . They actually note that the guy went out of his way to try to make a double-version of almost any weapon, then try to think of the ones he missed (double crossbow, double flintlock...).

    Western Animation 

-   _Teen Titans_:
    -   Parodied when Control Freak (a cosplaying _Star Wars_\-style fanboy) masters the use of the Quad Lightsaber (two lightsabers on either end of a stick) thanks to his excessive TV viewing and a magic remote.
    -   Played straight with Slade and gigantic flaming double poleaxe which he picks from the corpse of the previous owner and applies to Big Bad, saving the day.
-   _Galtar and the Golden Lance_: the title hero wields the eponymous weapon as a pair of sabers, which can join together at the pommel into, of course, a double-bladed lance.
-   The Sword of Plundarr from _ThunderCats (1985)_ and _Thunder Cats 2011_.
-   The Serpent of _Detentionaire_ uses a double bladed Telescoping Staff.
-   The Inquisitors of _Star Wars Rebels_ use these as a standard weapon. These are equipped to spin as well, useful for intimidating inexperienced Jedi.
-   _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_: Bonus points to Jedi general Pong Krell for using 2 of them. Justified because he has 4 arms.
    -   The Jedi temple guards also favor this type of weapon, with rather distinctive yellow blades.
    -   Savage Opress takes after his brother with a red double bladed saber.
    -   Ironically, Darth Maul spends the vast majority of the series with only a single blade. It's the same weapon as the one from Episode I, it's just that he doesn't have a good chance to repair it from when Obi-Wan sliced it in two. At one point, he even opts to dual wield. He finally repairs his original blade in the last arc of the series.

    Real Life 

-   Italian gun manufacturer Arsenal Firearms has developed a Awesome, but Impractical double-barreled 1911 pistol.
-   Truth in Television since most Medieval weapons were actually made so that either end could be used offensively. A poleaxe was a medieval staff weapon with a hammerhead, an axe blade and a spear point on one end (some versions replace either the axe blade or the hammerhead with a sharp metal beak), and another spear point on the other end, making it a _quadruple_ weapon (quintuple if you count the staff itself!). In a swordfight, a sword could be turned around and the pommel (the metal ball on the end of the hilt) used as a bludgeoning weapon. The word to "pummel" someone literally means to hit them with your _pommel_. A sword's cross-guard could be used as a hook to trip your opponent up or to capture his arms or weapon. Medieval combat manuals describe numerous such creative uses of weapons, all of which were probably common practice.
-   Going even farther back, the Greek Hoplite's spears had a big, foot-long bronze spearhead on one end, and a pointy bottom for dispatching wounded enemies as you walked over them, or incase the spearhead broke off, so you'd still have _something_ to shank people with. Hebrew spears in The Bible seem to have had a similar concept. At least at one time King Saul is recorded as planting his spear in the ground like a tent peg. And Saul's warleader Abner is recorded as slaying a pursuing enemy by turning around quickly and impaling him through the abdomen with the butt end. Possibly these were imports or copies of Philistine manufacture, Philistines being suspected by archeologists to have been cousins of Greeks.
-   Jump ahead a few years and the hand guards on Renaissance rapiers and cutlasses could be used for effective grapple counters and when you didn't feel like stabbing someone.
-   And in the modern day, if you're out of ammo, you can always fix bayonets to turn your rifle into a double-ended weapon. One of the standard uses is to hit your opponent in the face with the butt of the rifle to momentarily daze him, so he can't stop you from using the sharp pointy end to open him up.
-   The "shaolin spade" is another example. It's also one of the most effective anti-zombie weapons ever devised.
-   Also from the arsenal of the Shaolin Monks are the "twin hook" swords, made famous by Spike's _Deadliest Warrior_ (where they scored more kills for the monk than a Maori warrior's _entire arsenal put together_'). Aside from the handle, every inch of these weapons is designed to be lethal, and it can even be taken to the logical extreme of the trope: by locking the hooks at the end of two swords together, they become a single weapon capable of delivering death at a bigger distance than most _polearms._
-   The lajatang is a pole weapon with concave, crescent shaped blades at both ends. A number of other Chinese weapons such as the "cicada wing sword" or "heaven and earth, wind and fire sword" are all permutations on a short haft with blades on both ends, and bladed handguards evenly spaced on the haft. The tiger hook sword traditionally has a blade the size of a long knife at the pommel - likewise, many variations like the "nine teeth hook sword" exist. "Sun and moon spear swords," "snake rings" and many others are all variations on a one-handed weapon gripped in the center, with a bladed handguard and slashing or thrusting knives both above and below the hand. These weapons can all be confirmed to have actually existed, but the actual practicality of some may be questionable.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   The Indian madu is a slightly more practical example, consisting of a metal plate to shield the hand in the center with sharp thrusting points extending above and below the grip. It is intended principally as a defensive weapon for the off hand.
-   On the less practical side, there is another Indian weapon (18th century Gujurat, India, specifically) called the "cumberjung." It is a double-ended flail with spinning quoits or chakrams on the weighted ends. Picture wielding the Chinese three-section staff, but with flying buzzsaws in place of the sticks.
-   Japan also provides us with the Kusarigama. A long chain with a sharp sickle on one end and a heavy weight on the other. True masters can get both sides spinning at once, making a nasty whirlwind of death.
-   In a rather unusual example, Rifle stocks are basically flat triangular clubs when the weapon is used in hand-to-hand combat in Modern martial arts implements.
-   The Maori of Aotearoa (aka New Zealand) have the Taiaha, essentially 5 foot spear-like weapon with a club at the other end which, although not used like a spear, reportedly can break spines, and be fearsome in the right hands.
-   And similar to the above, the Russian Tarch.
-   The Haladie is a double bladed dagger, and possibly the earliest known triple edged blade, believed to have originated in India or Syria. It was used by Rajput clan warriors, and is probably the closest historical weapon to Darth Maul's sword staff, minus the difference in size of course.
-   The NERF N-Force Vendetta, which falls into the realm of Dual Wielding when the two blades are detached.
-   Forget double weapons, some people have taken it even further. For example, a man created a seven barreled shotgun using pipes and scrap metal. It delivered a heavy payload but took a while to load and had very powerful recoil. Seen here.
