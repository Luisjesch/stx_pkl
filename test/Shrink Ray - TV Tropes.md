**Amy:** How can we be in here? How do we fit?  
**Rory:** Miniaturisation ray.  
**Amy:** How would you know that?  
**Rory:** Well, there was a ray, and then we were miniaturised.

Examples in various media of a ray (a portable gun or a fixed installation) which can be used to shrink things (or, in some cases, alternately to expand things, probably by reversing the beam polarity). Has been subjected to Science Marches On and is a Discredited Trope; examples that do appear these days are more or less humorous, or else aimed at a target audience of kids.

Most (not necessarily all) such are usually typified by one or more of the following:

1.  The shrunk object doesn't need to be unshrunk; this happens automatically (indeed, it can't be prevented).
2.  The further something is shrunk, the less time it remains shrunk.
3.  The mass of the object changes in proportion to the size change (well, to be pedantic, in proportion to the cube of the size change).
4.  Shrunk objects are more fragile than objects which are naturally of that size; this was handwaved in _Fantastic Voyage_ as being because shrunk objects have loads of miniature atoms crammed into the space normally occupied by one atom.
5.  Shrunk/expanded items, even living creatures, continue to function as normal. (As anyone who's read Haldane's famous essay "On Being the Right Size", about the Square-Cube Law, knows, this is unrealistic; any living creature changed in size by more than a small extent would die in short order, due to being the wrong size for its shape.)

    Advertising 

-   A commercial for _Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters_ shows a bunch of guys using one of these in the woods so that one of them can shrink and sneak into the girls' tent. Unfortunately, they didn't take the owls into consideration...
-   In a commercial for Energizer batteries featuring Boris and Natasha from _Rocky and Bullwinkle_, Boris attempts to shrink the Energizer Bunny with a shrink ray. He accidentally shrinks himself and Natasha instead, nearly getting them squished by the Bunny as a result.

    Anime & Manga 

-   One of the recurring gadgets in _Doraemon_ is a "Small Light". A flashlight-like shrink ray which shrinks any object and person down and does wear out eventually. There's also a "Big Light" which does the opposite. The small light getting stolen in _Doraemon: Nobita's Little Space War_ even forms a plot point for the gang are stranded finger-sized most of the film until they can retrieve it.
-   _Anpanman_:
    -   This, in the form of a pistol, is Arinkokiddo's weapon, along with a growth gun. He's a tiny ant cowboy, so a zap from his shrink gun will bring the victim down to his size, with the growth gun being the only way to reverse the effects. In return, the growth gun can be used first to grow the victim into a colossal size, with the shrink gun returning them. The guns used to be squirt guns that launched out a liquid that changed sizes, but they now blast lasers. Thanks to his already tiny size, Baikinman has a tendency to nab his guns while he's napping, leaving him defenseless.
    -   In her original debut, Dokinchan's spear was also the form of a shrink ray. Like Arinkokiddo it has two color sides; red for shrinking, and blue for enlarging. It was even seen afterwards.
    -   Another episode had Bakinman inventing a mobile shrink ray. He originally intended it to shrink Anpanman, but instead gets shrunk himself. Then he gets bigger later after Horrorman and Dokinchan smashed it.
-   _High School D×D_: Vali Lucifer's Sacred Gear, Divine Dividing, has a technique called Half Dimension, which causes objects and people around him to become half their size.
-   The _Stitch!_ anime has a _living_ example of this, but since said living example first debuted in _Leroy & Stitch_, we'll list said example under the Western Animation folder below to keep it with the other examples from its franchise.
-   _Ulysses 31_: Antipathes' prism in "Temple of the Lestrigones" can shrink anything, from humans to spaceships. The effect can be reversed with the other faces of the prism.

    Asian Animation 

-   _BoBoiBoy_: Adu Du creates one to shrink the titular character so he can be squashed like a fly.
-   _Happy Heroes_: An arc in Season 5 features a similar invention - a spray with two buttons on it, one that makes things shrink when sprayed, and one that makes things grow.

-   _Lamput_: The docs invent a shrink ray in "Shrunk Doc" and use it to shrink Lamput, whom they stick into a vial to prevent him from escaping. Said shrink ray causes trouble for docs moments later when it accidentally fires on their vehicle, which shrinks... with Lamput still inside it.
-   Dr. Jhatka invents a big shrink ray in the _Motu Patlu_ episode "Chote Chote Motu Patlu". Motu and Patlu accidentally set it off, causing them to shrink, and they spend the rest of the episode trying to get people's attention so that they can be unshrunken.
-   _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_: In episode 3, Wolffy invents white pills that shrink those who eat them and black pills that enlarge those who eat them.

    -   In the Silver and Bonze Ages, Superman had one that could be used to allow people to enter the Bottle-City of Kandor (which was originally shrunk by Brainiac using a shrink ray). Notably, Superman's shrink ray worked by exchanging one full-size person for one shrunken Kandorian, making them swap sizes. It was many years before he could find a way to enlarge all of Kandor on its own, and permanently, in _Superman #338: "Let My People Grow!"_.
    -   On the cover of _Superman_ #365, Supergirl shrinks Superman down to tiny size with a Shrink Ray Gun as shown here.

In _Godzilla, King of the Monsters (1977)_, SHIELD contacts Giant Man to provide them with gas that shrinks Godzilla for more manageable size for several issues. This results in Godzilla fighting sewer rats, then growing to human-size and beating up hoodlums in New York. The 'Big' G even gets a snazzy trenchcoat to rip off!
-   In _Power Pack_, the character with the mass powers, usually Jack, has the ability to shrink to miniature size but retains his full mass
-   In _All Fall Down_, the Order of Despots has one on the Moon, and threaten to shrink the Earth with it. It comes up again later as a possible solution to a Colony Drop\-sized asteroid which turns out to be a hoax.
-   1980's British _Starblazer_. The Matter Condensor could shrink a cargo to a fraction of its normal size, enabling a small freighter to carry much more. Upon arrival the process was reversed.
-   In _Sonic the Comic_, Nack the Weasel uses size-altering cartridges which fire a ray that can shrink things or make them larger.

    Films — Animated 

-   _Despicable Me_ has Gru plotting to use a shrink ray to steal the moon. Not only are the effects temporary, but as Dr. Nefario discovers, their duration is inversely proportionate to the subject's original mass (i.e., the bigger the object, the faster it takes before it starts to grow back to normal). Nefario considers naming this principle after himself.
-   _Doug's 1st Movie_: When Roger learns that Doug and Skeeter have became friends with the monster of Lucky Duck Lake, he hires several science kids to build him a 50-foot Killer Robot to defend himself. They build a 6-foot tall robot instead, then whip out a ray gun to shrink Roger down to the appropriate size.
    
    **Roger:** _(High pitched)_ You fools! This is all wrong! Change me back! Change me back _now!_  
    **Nerd:** _(To the others)_ Can we do that? _(The others shrug)_
    
-   In _Felix the Cat: The Movie_, when the Professor and Poindexter encounter a huge Swamp Monster, Poindexter uses a ray to reduce him to a hundredth his originally size, while commenting that the effects were temporary.
-   _Space Chimps 2: Zartog Strikes Back_: After bringing the scientists back, Comet reprograms the vaporizer to shrink Zartog.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Honey, I Shrunk the Kids_ hits two of the above points — the mass of everything that's shrunk is reduced, and living creatures function perfectly normally. On the other hand, everything that's shrunk has to be manually unshrunk by the same machine, and they're no more fragile than at normal size. Note that non-shrunken characters do take care to never touch the shrunken ones.
    -   The sequel inverts this with a beam that makes things grow. More Artistic License – Physics is in play.
-   _Fantastic Voyage_ features a submarine crewed by surgeons which is sent into a scientist's brain to destroy a blood clot from the inside.
-   _Mars Attacks!_: The Martian leader uses a shrink ray gun on General Decker, then squashes the general under his boot.
-   _Attack of the Puppet People_: The puppet people don't actually attack. They've been shrunk by a puppeteer.
-   _Once Upon a Spy_: The Big Bad has a device that can fire a beam that shrinks large objects (like an aircraft carrier) down to the size of toys. He ends up being shrunk by his own device.
-   Not a ray, but _The Devil-Doll_ featured a shrinkage-inducing chemical process that reduced people or animals to the size of toys. Could be the Ur-Example, from 1936.
-   Dr. Thorkel has one in _Dr. Cyclops_. It's basically a big silver ray gun thing he keeps locked inside of a room in his lab. Anything inside the room when it's activated gets shrunk.
-   _Downsizing_ has this as the "miracle cure" for overpopulation and to save the environment as having smaller people means using less resources and having more space.
-   _Ant-Man_. The Big Bad hasn't perfected the technology to successfully shrink a person and survive the process, so he uses a handgun-like prototype to commit murder and dispose of the body, now a small puddle of Ludicrous Gibs which he flushes down the toilet. Ant-Man also has throwing disc devices that can shrink or expand inanimate objects, which he uses as Improvised Weapons.
-   In _Once Upon a Spy_, Big Bad Marcus Valorium's plan for world domination centres around his new invention: a cosmic ray powered molecular condenser. Or, to put it another way, a giant shrink ray.

    Literature 

-   In _Animorphs_, the ant-sized Helmacrons use a shrink ray to shrink the Animorphs down to their size.
-   _Captain Underpants_ has the Shrinky-Pig 2000, invented by Professor Poopypants. He also invented the Goosy-Grow 4000.
-   _The Stainless Steel Rat For President_ has Jim diGriz and his team carry items of miniaturised equipment thanks to a molecular extractor which can remove 99% of their molecules, then restore them to full size by extracting molecules from the surrounding area. Features only the "mass change" item above.
-   _The Size Spies_ by Jan Needle features a shrink ray created by an eccentric inventor, then stolen from its inventor.
-   The _Harry Potter_ books feature the spell "Reducio", which has this effect. Not to be confused with "Reducto" which causes them to explode instead.
-   In _L'Homme Élastique_ by Jacques Spitz, a scientist invents a nearly realistic version: it shows shrunk (or enlarged) beings live just as well as regular ones, but at least it acknowledges the problem and tries to Hand Wave it. Notably, mass is conserved, and the scientist gains the attention of the Army when he shows that miniaturized soldiers are tiny, hyperdense juggernauts.
-   The Television-Chocolate setup in _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_ involves one. Because the image of an object on television is always smaller than the actual object, teleporting an actual object by television requires the object in question to be much larger than it ordinarily would be — the result is that a chocolate bar the size of mattress comes out on the other end as no bigger than a regular chocolate bar. When Mike Teavee decides to try the system on himself, he winds up small enough to fit in the palm of his mother's hand. Since this ray's effects are permanent by design, Mike has to be stretched out to restore him to anything close to his original height (and winds up quite a bit taller than that).
-   The novel _Micro_, by Michael Crichton, involves one, and is a rare modern example of this trope that is neither a comedy nor aimed at children.
-   In _The Magic School Bus_, a shrinking ray is one of the bus' many features. There is also a portable version called, appropriately enough, the "Porta-Shrinker".
-   In _The Last Days of Krypton_, Brainiac uses one to reduce the City of Kandor to convenient portable size. He's done this many times before.
-   _Joel Suzuki_: In _Dance of the Darkeye_, the Shellborn, who don't allow themselves to use violence, defeat invading alien ships by using a shrinking cast to shrink them to the size of toys and then trapping them in a special containment unit.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Seen twice so far in the _Arrowverse_:
    -   In _Legends of Tomorrow_, Ray creates a device that can shrink and expand objects, although the effects are temporary, and the expanding feature was just in case they didn't want to wait for the shrinking to wear off.
    -   An episode of _The Flash (2014)_ has a metahuman who can shrink things, which can only be changed back if they're affected by his powers a second time. Also, he just happens to be the man that the team are looking for some information about in that episode. Guess what happens to Cisco and Ralph after they try to stop him escape a confrontation.
-   _The Avengers (1960s)_: The episode "Mission... Highly Improbable" has a device that sends out a ray that shrinks objects or people down to the size of toys.
-   _Blake's 7_: In "Gambit", Avon and Vila smuggle Orac inside a casino for some gratuitous cheating by using 'molecular reduction'. In this case, no ray is used; the Magical Computer simply does this to himself.
-   _El Chapulín Colorado_ has his _chiquitolina_ pills (chiquito means small, a rough translation will be _smalline pills_) that shrink him down to the size of an insect.
-   A Plutonian worker makes one in _Cybervillage_. Turns out to be useful when the workers aren't getting enough money to eat.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   The Master is armed in many of his appearances with a ray gun called the Tissue Compression Eliminator, which simultaneously kills the target and shrinks the corpse down to a convenient-to-dispose-of size. It kept the rule about shrunk objects having less mass, but mostly averted the one about living creatures surviving the process. The novelizations explicitly state at one point that the death is due to realistic Square-Cube Law effects. The one case where a person miniaturized by the TCE survives is when the Master accidentally miniaturizes himself. Two characters in the _Doctor Who Magazine_ comic strip have survived the Tissue Compression Eliminator, Death's Head presumably because he is a robot and less subject to Square-Cube Law (later sources would suggest that he'd been artificially enlarged, and the TCE merely restored his "natural" size), and Izzy for unknown reasons. The TCE makes its new series debut in "Spyfall".
    -   "The Invisible Enemy" includes a "Fantastic Voyage" Plot (using a shrink ray based on the same technology as lets the TARDIS be bigger on the inside, allowing a bit of handwaving about the issues of shrinking living things).
    -   "The Armageddon Factor", by the same writers, has another shrink ray based on the same technology, built by a Time Lord friend of the Doctor's so the two of them can shrink down and hitch a lift into the villain's base.
    -   "Let's Kill Hitler" lampshades it: The episode features a robot that can shrink people and transport them inside itself. When Amy and Rory are captured, Rory explains that they were hit by a "miniaturisation ray" because "Well, there was a ray, and then we were miniaturized."
    -   "Into the Dalek" also features the "Fantastic Voyage" Plot, except the Doctor and Clara, plus several Red Shirts, are shrunk in order to go inside an apparently good Dalek and try to help it. Inside, they end up triggering the Dalek equivalent of an immune system (floating Attack Drones). Instead of teaching the Dalek to be good, the Doctor accidentally lets the Dalek absorb his deep hatred for the race, causing the Dalek to turn his innate hatred on its own people. The Doctor is horrified by the implications.
-   An episode of _Eureka_ features a ray designed to shrink small inanimate objects by shunting most of their mass to an alternate dimension. Only... it is miscalibrated, and accidentally shrinks _the entire town_. Humans thus shrunk are still capable of functioning normally, other than being unusually hungry.
-   _Farscape_:
    -   In "Bone to Be Wild", the villainous Br'Nee shrinks Zhaan in order to vivisect her.
    -   Depicted in more detail in "I Shrink Therefore I Am". The crew are shrunk by bounty hunters to make them easier to transport and control. Sikozu immediately starts listing all the reasons why this is impossible (their brains should be too simple to function, and they shouldn't be able to breathe normal-sized air molecules) until Rygel tells her to just shut up and accept that the impossible has happened. The episode ends with a fight between Crichton and the Villain of the Week, with each trying to shrink the other and resize themselves. Needless to say, someone ends up getting squashed nastily.
-   Professor Memelovsky in _Odisea Burbujas_ creates the _Mycromacromathic Shower_ to change the size of things, using it to make his group of small animal assistants into human size.
-   Sid and Marty Krofft Productions had an episodic kids' show called _Dr. Shrinker_ in The '70s, in which five or six people were shrunk down to less than six inches.
-   The Dada aliens<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  from _Ultraman_ (and a number of subsequent _Ultra Series_) are famous for using these to capture humans and take them back home to be used as scientific guinea pigs.
    -   Their expies in _Ultraman Cosmos_, the Gigi, used similar technology. In this case, it was to make room for colonists on their overpopulated planet. Another episode showed that the same shrink rays can also be used to enlarge objects when a friendly Gigi scientist helps EYES and Cosmos fight some evil members of her kind by enlarging Musashi's Robot Buddy Clevergon to kaiju size.
    -   The crow-like Raybeaks from _Ultraman Tiga_ used Shrink Rays to kidnap humans and place them in tiny capsules so they transported to their homeworld to become slaves. In the 4Kids dub, they instead intend on turning humanity into collectibles ("You'll be bigger than _Pokémon_!").
-   _The Wild Wild West_ had an episode where Dr. Loveless built one and used it to shrink Jim West and an Indian woman.

    Puppet Shows 

-   Gerry Anderson's lesser-known (and last) Supermarionation series _The Secret Service_ features a shrink ray that Father Unwin uses to shrink secret agent Matthew to two feet tall. This allows Matthew to infiltrate the enemy's hideouts and learn their plans (allowing the 2-foot tall marionette to appear in full-size sets, occasionally hiding from full-size human arms and legs, or pets). It can also be used to literally bring the enemy down to size.

    Radio 

-   _Dimension X_: In "Beyond Infinity", Dr Winsler has built a prototype shrinking/growing machine. Objects put into the cylinder can be shrunk down smaller than an atom. The maximum shrinkage is measured in angstroms.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _GURPS Supers_
    -   The Shrinking power can be given the advantage Affects Others, allowing it to act as this.
    -   The supplement _Supertemps_. The hero Nucleus' nanosuit can generate a shrink field that affects other living beings.
-   _Champions_. When the power Shrinking is given the advantages Ranged and Usable On Others, it works as one of these.
-   _Marvel Super Heroes Adventure Game_ (SAGA System) Adventure 3 _Fantastic Four: Fantastic Voyages_. In the adventure "The Body Perilous", a device is used to shrink the PC heroes to microscopic size so they can be injected into Scott Long's (Ant-Man's) body. Once inside, they must destroy several crystals embedded in his heart.
-   _Carcosa: Weird Science-Fantasy Horror Setting_. Space Alien shrink rays can reduce targets to 1/10th normal size for 24 hours.

    Toys 

-   One type of Kanoka disk in _BIONICLE_ has the ability to shrink the target.

    Video Games 

-   In the ZX Spectrum game _The Incredible Shrinking Fireman_, the titular character, whilst fighting a blaze at a factory, accidentally gets zapped by a shrink ray and must find a way to expand back to full size.
-   _Duke Nukem 3D_ has the Shrinker, an alien weapon that shrinks organic enemies<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  for a short time, rendering them unable to attack or go very far; if you step on them, it's a One-Hit Kill, otherwise they'll return to their original size no worse for wear. There are at least two points in the game involving wall-mounted Shrinker ray shooters which Duke has to use to shrink himself so he can fit through very small passages; similarly, in one level you can shrink yourself by firing the Shrinker at a mirror, giving you access to a secret room. The _Atomic Edition_ introduced the Protector Drone, an alien whose ranged attack is a Shrinker ray, and who can easily stomp Duke flat if he's shrunk. In all cases, Duke can No-Sell Shrinker projectiles and immediately come back from being shrunk by using steroids.
-   The _Call of Duty: Zombies_ map "Shangri-La" has its unique Wonder Weapon, the 31-79 JGb215. Zombies hit by it shrink down to ankle height, and can be killed by walking into them. It is used in the Easter Egg Mission to charge up several crystals which all blast an enormous meteor to shrink it into the Focusing Stone.
-   The Purple Tentacle in _Day of the Tentacle_ invented one of these, and used it on the heroes while chasing them. They finally convince him to take out his anger on Dr. Fred instead, but the ray is reflected on his medical headband onto Purple, and that's how they manage to defeat him.
-   _Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3_: The Allied air unit, the Cryocopter, has as secondary weapon the Strong Homogenous Residual-Interactive Neutron Kinetic beam, shrinking targets for reduced firepower and range, which also makes them vulnerable to being crushed. Other side-effects include increased speed (which the Allies use in one mission, shrinking their own units to run a blockade) and high-pitched voice.
-   The unmodified de-noodlizer in _Parappa The Rapper 2_ can shrink or enlarge characters (including Parappa) when a certain character presses the button on its remote control, even with help from the Guru Ant, of course.
-   You use one to steal the Eiffel Tower in _Evil Genius_. And to subdue a fellow supervillain.
-   _Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters_ has one that Ratchet uses to go inside Clank.
-   In _Taz in Escape from Mars_, the first world has a shrink ray, and the rest of the worlds have them in edible potion form. These will temporarily shrink Taz, allowing him to through small passages, but also hindering his ability to burrow through the ground. Also in the first world, there is a ray that makes Taz grow.
-   _Plants vs. Zombies_:
    -   _Plants vs. Zombies_: The Nintendo DS trailer for the game has Dr. Zomboss use this to shrink his zombies, which explains the Small Zombie Big Trouble minigame. Ironically, you cannot play that minigame on the DS.
    -   _Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time_ has an actual Shrinking Violet that can kill all small zombies and weaken the bigger ones. She does so by making them smaller.
    -   _Plants vs. Zombies: Heroes_: This the Zombie Hero Rustbolt's signature superpower, even called Shrink Ray. Using it causes Rustbolt to fire one of these from his Powered Armor at a Plant Teammate, making them lose three attacking strength and even has the visual effect of actually shrinking them too. The Triassic set also features the return of Shrinking Violet as a trick. Due to the changes in gameplay, she now instead reduces the strength of a zombie and its next door teammates by two unless they are untrickable and if said teammates end up with 0 strength, she kills them. Said trick also causes the zombies to get shrunk.
-   In _Carmen Sandiego: Math Detective_, Carmen has invented the Quantum Crystalizer, which shrinks objects and places them inside a gem, in order to facilitate her customary Monumental Thefts.
-   _Sonic The Hedgehog_:
    -   In _Sonic CD_, shrink rays are present in Metallic Madness Zone. These allow Sonic to get through small spaces, and Sonic retains his regular jump height despite being smaller. There are also grow rays that return him to his normal size.
    -   As _Sonic Mania_ is a love letter to the games from the Genesis era, Metallic Madness Zone and its shrink rays return in that game. The boss of Act 2 is fought when Sonic and/or his friends are tiny.
-   Henry can use this in the third _Henry Stickmin_ game, _Stealing the Diamond_, to make his way into the titular diamond's museum via a small crack, but this leads to a fail where he and a worm get into a fight and Henry loses and gets eaten.
-   _So uh, a spaceship crashed in my yard._: Property of the Mad Scientist. Used to render a statue portable as part of the main quest.
-   _Transistor_: Enemies hit by Void() will shrink, applying a debuff which causes them to take 75% more damage with each hit. Stack it up to three times to make them tiny!
-   A shrinking device consisting of a platform and three laser turrets appears in _Grounded_, although the player character(s) start out shrunken rather than using it to shrink like you'd expect. One of the unusual side effects of shrinking is amnesia, so you don't remember how you got miniaturized, at least at first. Other Artistic License – Physics tropes apply as expected; you function more or less normally, and can move, carry things and eat normally without any consideration for the square-cube law.

    Web Original 

-   _SCP Foundation_:
-   The YouTube Poop "Honey I Shrunk the King of Hyrule" features Link building one of these and then using it on the King when he mocks it. This leads to the shrink ray exploding and Link and Zelda having to fix the shrink ray while the shrunken King gets kidnapped by the cast of Bottle Fairy.

Billy and Pete try to buy it, but their jokes at its expense cause Rusty to refuse the sale. It next appears Magic Versus Science competition between Dr. Venture and Dr. Orpheus to see who could successfully shrink someone. (They both fail.) In another episode, it's used to shrink SPHINX's submarine so it could be used in a "Fantastic Voyage" Plot.

    -   _Lilo & Stitch: The Series_ has Jumba create two different shrink rays that are used for both shrinking and enlarging in separate episodes.
        -   In "Poxy", Jumba uses a "reducer ray" on Lilo and Stitch in the X-Buggy so the human-alien duo can capture a microscopic experiment that causes illness (X-222/Poxy) from within Pleakley.
        -   In "Short Stuff", Stitch uses a "Protoplasmic Growth Ray" so he can become big enough to ride a roller coaster, but accidentally goes too far and becomes too big. It becomes more difficult for him to move in his newfound giant size, and not only that but the episode's experiment (X-297/Shortstuff) also gets mistakenly enlarged and defeats Stitch in battle. Stitch is eventually returned to his normal small size to fight back and stop the experiment, who is then given a "one true place" that is based on one of his abilities and his new large size.

        -   "Shrink" has him shrinking the main characters down to a small size, although not to microscopic levels like in "Poxy" of _The Series_. The episode ends with the characters back to their regular sizes, and him enlarging the alien BooGoo to become bigger than the Earth.
        -   "Experiment-a-palooza" has him enlarging Stitch to become a giant. Not only that, because X-210/Retro's abilities were also used on Stitch, the blue experiment is also reverted to his original programming and goes on a rampage.

-   In one episode of _Timon & Pumbaa_, the pair try to get past a stubborn goat blocking the border into France. One of their attempts is to shrink down and slip underneath it. Unfortunately, the effect wears off too fast and they end up returning to normal size right under the goat.
-   _Noveltoons_: In _Out of This Whirl_ a Martian spends the day with an Earth family.
