**Detective Somerset**: We must divorce ourselves from emotion here. No matter how hard it is, we have to remain focused on the details–  
**Detective Mills**: Hey, man, I feed off my emotions, okay? How's that? _\[Mills promptly gets into a fight with a reporter snooping around the crime scene\]_ Hey, man, I'm sorry. They just...they piss me off, okay?  
**Detective Somerset**: _\[sarcastically\]_ It's okay. It's impressive to see a man feeding off his emotions.

This trope is about two individuals (or occasionally, factions or civilizations) that are significantly linked together somehow (such as through a rivalry, friendship, being siblings, co-workers, competitors, etc.) that have differing personalities and, with it, often different approaches to the world in general, especially whatever they might be competing in/for/over. This, of course, gives them something to butt heads about, since their manner of acting may rub each other the wrong way and each is sure that their way of doing things is right.

By the way, don't get too stuck on the colors in the title. The title refers to a Japanese tradition that gets elaborated a bit later in the article, but it doesn't mean that a character has to dress in or be associated with a particular color in order to fit the role.

Their personalities usually run roughly along the following lines:

-   The **Red Oni** is associated with passion, wildness, and defiance. A Red Oni character is often more brawny than brainy, extroverted, enthusiastic, determined, and filled with a zest for life. They are also much more likely to break conventions and rules than their counterpart. Often an Idiot Hero or, in more mature pieces, a Boisterous Bruiser. If a Red Oni is indeed noticeably intelligent, they will still be much more wild and impetuous than the Blue Oni and/or with less sophisticated thoughts, feelings, or goals. Generally speaking, they're more people-oriented than goal-oriented (although both Oni's can be either). They may or may not shrug off criticism about themselves or their aims and goals, but say or do something nasty to their closest friends and you've just guaranteed yourself a world of pain. When a goal-oriented villain, the Red Oni will often be Ax-Crazy and psychotically willing to sacrifice any innocent lives to achieve their goals. A more Affably Evil Red Oni tends to be a Blood Knight. In terms of character alignment, the Red Oni tends towards the Chaotic alignments, though this isn't always the case.
    -   Freudian and Power Trios: The Id, may be The McCoy (though not guaranteed)
    -   Four-Philosophy Ensemble: Optimist or Apathetic
    -   Four-Temperament Ensemble: Sanguine or Choleric
    -   Five-Man Band: The Leader/The Hero, The Lancer, or The Big Guy
    -   Dere types: Deredere, Tsundere, Yandere
-   The **Blue Oni** is associated with serenity, control and observing authority. A Blue Oni is more intellectual, proud, traditional, introverted, and cultured (sometimes more spiritual, although that's not guaranteed), if a Blue Oni is indeed physically strong, they tend to be Genius Bruisers, with the calm, collected intelligence of a typical Blue Oni character combined with the physical prowess of a typical Red Oni character. Blue Oni personalities are often respected by others, but also likely to puzzle, confound or even intimidate their peers because they are difficult to read and have a mysterious quality to them. Personality subtypes include The Stoic, The Quiet One, Aloof Big Brother and Deadpan Snarker. It's worth noting that while blue types _appear_ tremendously calm and composed, sometimes, this is just the surface, and scratching that façade may show that they are, if anything, wound **far** too tight beneath their calm and unemotional appearance. Villainous Blue Oni tend to be willing to sacrifice anything (and often anyone) for their goals, mostly only when their villainous goals are laden with _true purpose_ (see Knight Templar and Well-Intentioned Extremist). Being more calculating, conniving and thorough (and if The Mole comes into play), Blue Oni tend to be more successful villains long-term than Red Oni. In terms of character alignment, the Blue Oni tends towards the Lawful alignments though this isn't always the case.
    -   Freudian and Power Trios: The Superego or The Ego, may be The Spock or The Kirk (though not guaranteed)
    -   Four-Philosophy Ensemble: Cynic or Realist
    -   Four-Temperament Ensemble: Melancholic or Phlegmatic
    -   Five-Man Band: The Leader, The Lancer (If the leader/hero is a Red Oni), The Heart, or The Smart Guy
    -   Dere types: Kuudere, Dandere, Himedere

While many expressions of this trope play it straight, it is also not uncommon for the Blue Oni and Red Oni to mix traits. The Red Oni, while usually the more passionate and emotion-driven, may be the more easy-going and flexible of the two. Their more simplistic world-view may make them at least partially immune to angst and Wangst. Conversely, the Blue Oni, while usually stoic and thoughtful, may hide a volatile, angsty nature that erupts when pushed too far. In such instances, the two may switch roles, with the Red Oni becoming the reassuring, composed partner and the Blue Oni becoming a Whirling Dervish of Rage! Compare pairings such as Ken and Ryu, with Ken being the red oni — cocky, arrogant, but decidedly easy-going — and Ryu the blue — stoic, disciplined, but brimming with internal conflict. Interestingly, an easy-going Red Oni would become the Blue Oni if paired with a standard Red Oni, and an internally conflicted, emotionally unstable Blue Oni would become the Red Oni if paired with a standard Blue Oni.

If Elemental Powers are present, you can usually expect the red oni to use Playing with Fire or something of a similarly flashy nature, while the blue oni will prefer Making a Splash or possibly be An Ice Person and an Elemental Rivalry is born.

There are a lot of ways to play their interactions, so sometimes the two are both leads on an equal standing, sometimes the blue is more of The Smart Guy or The Lancer to the red's Hot Blooded The Leader or The Big Guy. The relationship can also vary wildly, as they are just as likely to be close friends as they are to be bitter rivals or enemies. One thing that is sure is that regardless of how big a cast is, when these two are in it, they will be magnetically drawn to each other.

Note that many times, this will be a relative, not an absolute, distinction: the Red Oni need not be The Fool and the Blue Oni need not be a Straw Vulcan.

The name comes from traditional Japanese folklore where Oni (think troll/ogre) usually came in two flavors, Red and Blue. Over time, it's gotten popular to ascribe different qualities and personalities to the two colors. (Think the high-strung Type A personality and the easy-going Type B personality.) See also the Marid and Ifrits over at Our Genies Are Different.

In a show where it's relevant, differences in fighting style may be something like Technician Versus Performer. For example, a red may rush headlong into combat without focus or a plan, relying on surprise or intimidation. It may be that their strategy is to close the fight quickly before their opponent can think or adapt. It's also possible that they're going to tank their opponent's defenses in order to focus on beating them down. The blue may use cunning traps, stealth and strategies, or tend to win in elegant Single-Stroke Battle fashion, or rely on hitting a target with magical powers or projectiles from a distance instead of running up to their opponent and punching them in the face. Force and Finesse is a variation where red tends to rely on raw power while blue uses precision strikes. Analysis page has more examples of possible red-blue dynamics.

Male-male oni pairs in Japanese-language works usually have an Expository Pronoun contrast, most often with the red oni calling himself _ore_ and the blue oni favoring _boku_.

Add one person (We'll call them the Purple Oni, who's not as passionate and headstrong as the Red Oni, but also not as rational and calm as the Blue Oni) that bridges between the Red Oni and Blue Oni and you got Freudian Trio, with the Red Oni becomes the Id/The McCoy, the Blue Oni becomes the Superego/The Spock, and the Purple Oni becomes the Ego/The Kirk (or a Blue Oni is the Ego as well, who's either torn between the two, or not involved.). That's the basic formula, but not always. Sometimes as the plot progresses, someone new is added and as they become the trio, this newcomer might be even more emotional than the Red Oni or is even more calm and calculating than the Blue Oni. And whoever keeps the trio together is the ego.

Keep in mind that this trope can apply to anyone and to any pairs of people. They do not have to literally wear red and blue for this trope to work and sometimes, they can even wear opposite colors that contrast their roles as a red or blue Oni. They also do not have to be of the same gender either as this trope can also apply to two people consisting of a boy and a girl.

Energetic and Soft-Spoken Duo is a subtrope. Compare Outside Man, Inside Man, Odd Couple, Cast Calculus (for the evolution of the Red/Blue dynamic through various numbers of ensembles), Tomboy and Girly Girl, Sensitive Guy and Manly Man, Order Versus Chaos, and Elves Versus Dwarves. See also Pink Girl, Blue Boy and Action Duo. If the contrast in personalities between the two actually brings them to blows, you probably have a Tiger Versus Dragon situation. If they are friends it will often be of the Vitriolic Best Buds variety, most commonly where one character is completely oblivious to the vitriol. A Technician/Performer Team-Up often have this breakdown, with the "technician" as blue and the "performer" as red.

Also, despite the name, this trope has nothing to do with _that_ oni.

    Advertising 

-   Sanrio's _Patty & Jimmy_ are well played in this trope: Patty is the red oni, because she excels in sports, but fails in studies. Jimmy is the blue oni, because he is not very athletic, but has A+ grades in such classes as math, and reading. In addition, the two friends wear their respective colors... most of the time.
-   UK Milky Way advertisement: The red car and the blue car had a race...
-   Old Spice has a series of commercials with dueling spokesmen Isaiah Mustafa as the smooth, calm blue to Terry Crews's loud red.
-   CinnaMon and Bad Apple from the Apple Jacks commercials. CinnaMon is an excitable cinnamon stick who frequently shows up his blue-oni counter part, Bad Apple, by using stunts to reach a bowl of their signature cereal first.
-   The former hosts of Nick Jr. can be seen as opposites to each other. Face (host from 1994 to 2004, and the host of _Face's Music Party_) and Piper O'Possum (host from 2004 to 2007) are the excitable, zany red onis, while Moose and Zee (co-hosts of Noggin from 2003 to 2009, Nick Jr. from 2009 to 2012) are the calm, quiet blue onis.
    -   Moose and Zee can be seen as opposites to each other as well, albeit a downplayed example. Moose is the more extroverted and talkative one of the duo, while Zee is more introverted and explicitly stated to be shy in her debut appearance on Noggin.

    Animation 

-   _Feng Ling Yu Xiu_: Where Feng Ling'er can be fairly abrasive and has more of an attitude, Bai Yuxiu is mild-mannered and polite. However, Feng Ling'er has been shown to be more cautious than Bai Yuxiu in dangerous situations.
-   In _Motu Patlu_, Motu is more hot-tempered (red) while Patlu is considerably calmer (blue).

    Arts 

-   _Medici Chapels_: That the Medici brothers are Sibling Yin-Yang of sorts is symbolized by the statues that flank their tombs. "Dusk" and "Dawn" represent the transitions of the day, where the light is tender and invites calm contemplation. They are placed at Lorezon's sides and, like him, are Blue Onis. On the other hand, "Day" and "Night" convey tension —the former is full of energy to tackle his routine while the latter is in a fitful sleep. They are Red Onis whose stark contrast belies Giuliano's prideful disposition.
-   _Oni Embodiments_: The Oni sculptures are literal embodiments of this trope. "Embodiment of 'A'" is red-skinned and a Blood Knight. "Embodiment of 'Um'", by contrast, is blue-skinned and The Stoic.

    Card Games 

-   _Magic: The Gathering_:
    -   Red and Blue magic and characters often have this relationship with one another. Red magic, mages, and creatures are all about passion and defiance. Blue magic tends to be big on thought and planning. Also, fire magic tends to be red, while water magic tends to be blue.
    -   Among planeswalkers, the two typical embodiments of this comparison are Chandra Nalaar's pyromantic, hotheaded and impulsive Red to Jace Beleren's mind\-bending, studious and analytical Blue.
    -   In their childhood, the brothers Mishra and Urza fit this trope perfectly. Mishra is temperamental, emotional, and passionate, whereas Urza is scholarly, logical, and standoffish. This continues throughout the Brothers' War.
    -   In modern sets, djinn and efreets often play this role against each other. Djinn, associated with Blue mana, are passive and thoughtful. Efreets, tied to Red mana, are wild, emotional and impulsive. This is particularly notable through two characters from Strixhaven, a school of magic whose colleges each focus on the dichotomy between two opposing colors — in this case the deans of the Red/Blue college of Prismari, the scholarly djinn Uvilda, who believes that careful scrutiny and planned, deliberate choice are they key to great art, and the flamboyant efreet Nassari, who believes art comes from passion, emotion and unrestrained self-expression. Uvilda's artwork thus consists of small, precisely shaped and extensively worked-on masterpieces, while Nassari's are grand projects designed to be ever bigger, more radical and more emotionally exciting.
    -   In the _Strixhaven_ set, there are five colleges in the titular university, and all of them have different variations of this with each other, which is deliberate as they are all utilize enemy colors so as to simulate a school debate.
        -   Lorehold (Red/White): a history college that produces Indiana Jones-type students, their internal argument with regards to history is simplified to Order Versus Chaos, with White representing Order, while Red represents Chaos.
        -   Prismari (Red/Blue): an art college that deals with art in all its forms, but their argument in the approach to art is nothing short of Harmony Versus Discipline or Technician Versus Performer (Blue being the technician, Red being the Performer).
        -   Quandrix (Green/Blue): a math college that focuses on all things dealing with math, their argument is whether math is all theory (Blue), or if these equations can be brought to life (Green); basically, Mother Nature, Father Science.
        -   Silverquill (White/Black): a college known for its word-based magic; their argument can be boiled down to Warrior vs. Sorcerer, as the debate is about whether words should be used to strike down enemies (Black), or to to help uplift allies (White)
        -   Witherbloom (Green/Black): a college centered around biology. They argue whether Life is more important in the grand scheme of things (Green), or if Death is more important (Black).
-   _Yu-Gi-Oh!_
    -   Defender, the Magical Knight is the defensive counterpart to "Breaker the Magical Warrior." "Breaker's" emphasis is on his ATK and sword; "Defender's" is on his DEF and shield. "Breaker" is DARK Attribute while "Defender" is LIGHT Attribute. Their color schemes are also the opposite of each other, "Breaker's" armor is red while "Defender's" armor is blue. Their effects are also opposites of each other since "Breaker's" effect destroys Spell or Trap Cards, while "Defender's" effect protects Spellcasters (hence the names).
    -   Nikitama and Aratama are references to the duality of god in the Shinto religion, namely Aratama & Nigitama, this card being a "evil" god, while "Nikitama" is a "kind" god, therefore they are counterparts of each other. Aratama supports destruction and anger (this may be represented by its effect that allows the player to search for a strong monster). Nigitama supports birth, growth and regeneration (this may be represented by its swarming effect and the one that allows the player to draw 1 card).
    -   Finally, there's also the straight up examples of Red-Headed Oni and Blue-Blooded Oni.

    Comic Strips 

-   In _Calvin and Hobbes_, Calvin is hyper and imaginative while Hobbes is calm and philosophical.
-   In _Dilbert_, Alice is the hot-tempered, overacting red to Wally's laid-back, calculating blue.
-   _Garfield_ and Odie often fit the Red Oni and Blue Oni, with Garfield being lazy, a Perpetual Frowner and sluggish in activity while Odie is always happy, a Perpetual Smiler and very physically active.
    -   Jon is often the Red Oni himself, being this desperate loser always calling women on the phone asking for a date or simply asking Garfield answers to philosophical questions while Garfield does nothing but slouch on the table and make a harsh comment or insult about Jon like telling him to get a life or "Feed me".
-   _Peanuts_:
    -   Played straight with the bossy, crabby, strong-opinionated Lucy and her calm, younger brother Linus who acts as the strip's philosopher and theologian by reciting quotes from The Bible. Quite a little ironic considering how Lucy's signature color is blue while Linus' is red.
    -   Downplayed with Peppermint Patty and Marcie, which Patty is more of an extrovert while Marcie is more of an introvert.

    Mythology and Folklore 

-   The obvious Japanese mythological reference above, being the Trope Namer, from Momotaro.
    -   The literal Ur-Example (and more likely Trope Namer) comes from the names of two Oni associated with Onmyodo, Zenki (Preceding Oni) and Goki (Following Oni). Zenki is depicted as a large male Oni with red skin who walks in front of the caster and wields a giant axe, implying brutality and impulsiveness. Goki instead is a (usually) female blue Oni, sometimes depicted as smaller than Zenki and walking behind the caster and wields a stone bottle in her hands, implying a more supportive role and thinking.
    -   From the same source, we have the demon brothers Fujin, the dark green-skinned god of Wind, and Raijin, the light red-skinned god of Thunder.
    -   An interesting comparison is the two female temptresses: Jorogumo (Red) use their charms and flirtation to snag their prey, The Yuki-onna (Blue) use innocence and elegance instead. Alternatively, Jorogumo is the calm, smart and seductive Blue to Tsuchigumo's violent, animalistic Red.
    -   Averted with the two Oni guardians of Hell, Gozu and Mezu: while they're often depicted with contrasting colors (Red and Blue respectively) they generally lack opposite personalities or quirks.
-   Areas of Asia that have been heavily influenced by Taoism tend to have "red oni" and "blue oni" analogues. In particular, traditional depictions of _shishi_ (foo-lions or foo-dogs) tend to have "red oni"/"blue oni" symbolism based on Taoist concepts of _yin_ and _yang_.
    -   The notion of "positive" and "negative" signs in Western astrology mirrors this trope as well. Peculiarly, in both cases, the Red Oni is referred to as "masculine" and the Blue Oni as "feminine".
-   Most descriptions of "Hero Twins" stories from Southeastern, Southwestern, and Mesoamerican Native American cultures generally consist of a "red oni" (usually a Wild Boy character coming from a clot of blood, raised in a jar, being part jaguar, etc. depending on the specific culture) and a "blue oni" (usually a "tame boy" character who largely goes along with whatever the Red Oni is plotting, though sometimes he objects).
    -   The earliest recorded version of this are the Mayan stories of Hunhapu (Blue) and Xbalanque (Red) in the _Popol Vuh_ and in Mayan stelas (some dating back to at least 200 CE and potentially even dating back to Olmec iconography), making this trope _at least_ Older Than Feudalism.
-   Norse Mythology has Thor and Loki. Whenever they're teamed up, Thor tends to be the guy who charges in, hammer swinging, while Loki is the one making plans.
    -   Fire giant Loki, willing to pull nasty tricks on someone for momentarily ticking him off, and his sworn brother gray wanderer Odin, who holds his cards so close his chest, he ticks off all the other Aesir (except possibly Baldur).
-   In Greek Mythology: Athena, Apollo, and Hephaestus are blue, Ares, Artemis, and Aphrodite are red. Apollo is so blue that the blue oni personality is sometimes called "Apollonian." The red oni personality is often called "Dionysian."
    -   Hades is the blue to Zeus and Poseidon's red.
-   The Western Zodiac have their contrasts between the same elemental signs. (By descriptions and stereotypes alone)
    -   Air Signs: Gemini (Red) is described as rather playful, intelligently curious and rather unpredictable emotionally. Libra and Aquarius (Blues) are more inquisitive, charming (and in Libra's case) balanced in justice.
    -   Fire Signs: Leo and Sagittarius (Red) are generally more bombastic, chaotic, flirtatious, reckless and arrogant misfits. Aries (Blue) while equally loud and proud as the latter two, Aries however is strong, confident and make good leaders with their determination.
    -   Earth Signs: Capricorn (Red) is the stubborn, workaholic with a natural tendency toward people-pleasing. Taurus and Virgo (Blues) are more low-key, intellectual and traditional. Taurus and Virgo particularly get along, for their mutual respect for beauty and details.
    -   Water Signs: Scorpio (Red) is known to be extremely intense and emotional towards life. Scorpio's passion and power has mistaken it for a Fire Sign at times. Cancer and Pisces (Blues) however are much more nurturing, loving and protective of their loved ones. Cancer is particularly intuitive, while Pisces is greatly sympathetic.

    Podcasts 

-   _Binary Break_ has Kat (Red) and Cate (Blue). Cate is relaxed and can go with the flow, and generally tries to be friendly with everyone. Kat is much more acerbic, sees Cate as more of a rival, and doesn't seem to have many friends beyond Cate.
-   _Find Us Alive_: Love (Red) and Raddagher (Blue), with shades of both Energetic and Soft-Spoken Duo and Ham and Deadpan Duo. Love is loud, brash, impulsive, and prone to violence and Suddenly Shouting; Raddagher is The Quiet One (to the point of becoming nonverbal occasionally), reserved, methodical, and often the first to notice when something seems off. As it turns out, Opposites Attract.
-   While both co-hosts of _Were You Raised by Wolves?_ are passionate about etiquette, Leah often suggests breaking certain rules of etiquette to resolve conflicts and she often expresses what she would _like to do_ even if it would be rude. Nick, on the other hand, finds it difficult to suggest breaking these rules and often — though not always — agrees with what Miss Manners or Emily Post would do.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   The Brothers of Destruction: The Undertaker (Red) and Kane (Blue) in earlier years 97 - 2001. Though it can vary. Kane was ruthless but usually followed the leads of others. Otherwise, he was fairly calm. Undertaker, however, displayed a clear Hair-Trigger Temper and was arguably harder to get under control once he got going. Notable examples are as follows
    
    -   The confrontation with Bearer after their first alliance. When Paul insults their mother, Kane has to hold Taker back. However, once Kane turned his back on Paul, Taker beat him viciously.
    -   After Vince insults them, Kane remains calm while Taker warns him to watch his ass with them or he'll be crippled. When they catch Vince flipping them off, again Taker is the one who unleashes Hell on him while Kane merely keeps help at bay and puts Vince in a position for Taker to finish crippling him.
    -   Called out during Taker's 2000 American Badass days when he was waiting to attack Triple H.
    
    **Kane:** You know, there's other ways of handling this.  
    **Undertaker:** _Since when did you become the voice of reason?! Yeah, there's other ways of handling it. But I'm gonna handle it my way tonight._
    
-   Contrasting the team-up with his brother, Kane has been the Blue in other tag teams. His second most notable tag team with The Big Show tended to have him as the more stoic (if psychotic) of the two while Show ranged anywhere between Hot-Blooded to Big Fun. Another team with Team Hell No, saw him again play the Blue Oni to Daniel Bryan's Red.
-   The Hardy Brothers: Jeff Hardy (impulsive and aerial Red) and Matt Hardy (more calculated and ground-based Blue).
-   Edge (blue) and Christian (red)
    -   Maybe during their initial run, but after going singles, Edge is a much wilder, crazier Red, and since his return, Christian is a calm, relaxed Blue.
-   Former WWE Unified Tag Team Champions Mike "The Miz" Mizanin (angry Red) and John Morrison (mellow Blue).
-   The Rockers (originally AWA's Expies of The Rock 'n' Roll Express from the NWA), Marty Jannetty (Blue) and Shawn Michaels (Red); notable for the fact that the group originally split after they gradually switched roles over the course of their 5-year tag team career.
    -   In the same vein, the most recent iteration of D-Generation X, with Shawn Michaels back in the Red Oni role and partner/best friend Triple H in the Blue Oni role (it can also be noted that Hunter can switch the colors pretty much on demand now as a story needs him to).
-   Classic big-man tag team The Twin Towers, where the Big Bossman (prior to his Heel–Face Turn) was the Red Oni and Akeem "The African Dream" (after switching gimmicks from The One Man Gang) was the Blue Oni.
-   The Outsiders, Kevin Nash (Blue) and Scott Hall (firmly entrenched in Red territory).
-   Even Mick Foley (jokey Red) and Al Snow (serious Blue) meet this trope head-on!
    -   The Rock and Sock Connection: Foley remains the jokey Red while The Rock is the serious blue.
-   During the Attitude Era, the WWF's top two stars were Steve Austin (the surly, boisterous Red Oni) and The Rock (the suave, snarky Blue Oni).
-   TNA's Beer Money, Inc. James Storm (red) and Robert Roode (blue)
-   Even the ANNOUNCERS get in on the action!
    -   The classic team of Jim Ross (Blue) and Jerry Lawler (Red).
    -   Classic ECW's Joey Styles (Red) and Joel Gertner (Blue). OH MY GOD!!
    -   Michael Cole (Red) and Tazz (Blue).
        -   When Tazz went to the ECW Brand, Cole became the Blue to John "Bradshaw" Layfield's hard-Red.
    -   Gorilla Monsoon (Blue) and Jesse Ventura (Red). Gorilla was firmly Red, however, when teamed with Bobby "The Brain" Heenan (cold, calculating Blue).
        -   On that token, "Rowdy" Roddy Piper lived up to his moniker when he served as Monsoon's replacement Red with Brain.
-   The APA was a good example with Bradshaw as the Ranting Red and Faarooq as the Blue of a single word. That word, of course, being "DAMN!".
-   In TNA, you have Mr Anderson (rule-breaking, stubborn asshole Red) and Matt Morgan (higher-minded, honourable Blue), although, in an ironic twist, Anderson's entrance lighting is very blue-themed whereas Morgan's is very red.
-   Raw and Smackdown are this right down to their colors. RAW has more crazy segments and is most of the time aired live while Smackdown is usually geared towards wrestling and was always taped until 2016.
-   In Japan, there is the classic rivalry between New Japan Pro-Wrestling (Red; focuses on high-flying maneuvers and fast-paced martial arts move exchanges) and All Japan Pro Wrestling (Blue; focuses on traditional heavyweight bouts and slow-burning feuds and matches). This in turn extends to their founders, with New Japan founder Antonio Inoki being the brash and self-aggrandizing Red Oni and All Japan founder Giant Baba being the stoic and traditionalist Blue Oni.
-   Legendary All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling tag team the Crush Gals: Chigusa Nagayo (Red) and Lioness Asuka (Blue). Neither fell into the absolute territory but Nagayo was usually the more emotional, passionate one while Asuka was the cooler, calmer one. They even _wore_ red (for Chigusa) and blue (for Asuka).
-   MsChif is the Red Oni of MSEERIE, where her partner is the comparatively quieter and less outlandish of the two and the Blue Oni of Diabolic Khaos where she is the comparatively subtle strategist while her partner runs around wild, hitting people with foreign objects while babbling about random topics.
-   Delirious is also the red oni of Incoherence, not that Hallowicked was particularly subdued, but he is downright stoic compared to Delirious.
-   Curry Man wore yellow and red, but he was the blue oni to the confrontational Shark Boy, who incidentally was a red oni dressed in blue.
-   Los Sicarios del Ring, the two wrestlers El Satanico Dr. No brainwashed in 2005. Mephisto, the brutish red devil and Averno, the cunning manipulative blue devil.
-   Of the main two members of the second Bullet Club incarnation, AJ Styles is the blue oni, being pretty laid back and somewhat content to wrestle cleanly (at one point even asking one of New Japan's referees just what he was and wasn't allowed to do), to Karl Anderson's red, who became the de facto leader after the departure of Fergal Devitt and is responsible for maintaining the group's vicious, evil, reputation.
-   Rocky Romero the red to Roppongi Vice partner Berreta the blue, who is fine with saying little and being cool, whereas Romero was used to a partner he'd always fight and make up with as well as screaming at people.
-   The Funk Brothers: Terry Funk, the "middle-aged and crazy" "Hardcore Legend", is the Red, and Dory is the quieter, more reserved Blue.
-   One of the reasons why Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage could never team together for too long was that they were _both_ Reds. Miss Elizabeth was a Non Action Blue to Savage's Red.
-   While never a full-time team, CHIKARA's Aces Mike Quackenbush and Eddie Kingston were this kind of contrast. Kingston, "The War King", was the Red, a rage and pain-fueled tough guy who preferred beating people up to applying sophisticated holds and would not give up no matter the injury. Quack was the Blue, "The Master of a Thousand Holds", who saw wrestling as a human chess game and preferred to take his opponents down to the mat and defeat them by thinking far ahead of them. That said, Quack could also be a case of Beware the Nice Ones/You Wouldn't Like Me When I'm Angry!, since his Roaring Rampage of Revenge against GEKIDO in 2012 led to the original leader, 17<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and combatANT<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  out of CHIKARA altogether.
-   Kenny Omega is the hyperactive and geeky Red, while Adam Page is the reserved and old-fashioned blue in moments where they teamed up.
-   The Kingdom: Matt Taven (Red) and Mike Bennett (Blue).

    Religion 

-   The Bible has several examples:
    -   Adam & Eve are Blue Oni, Red Oni in straightest terms. Adam was the one who named the animals and was in full charge of Eden, second only to God while Eve was Red due to having being fully loving to Adam. Deconstructed when Eve easily succumbs to the temptation to eat the apple while Adam passively allowed it to happen.
    -   Jesus and the Blessed Virgin Mary are complicated examples, yet remain a perfect Reconstruction. Jesus was outwardly Red Oni due to being active in His duty to God and even got angry when His Church was being misused as a market place and while accosting the Pharisees (There is even a whole chapter in Matthew devoted to a single "Reason You Suck" Speech about them), but was inwardly Blue Oni due to being peaceful in His approach and remained loving even toward his enemies. Mary, on the other hand, was outwardly Blue Oni by remaining peaceful while inwardly Red Oni by not hesitating to risk being (unjustly) stoned to death and being a loving Mother.
    -   David and Goliath is a classic example. As powerful as Goliath was, it was David who won the battle between them. Goliath was a strong and powerful warrior who was said to be far taller than poor David. But armed with a mere slingshot, David skilfully outwitted Goliath thus turned the tables on the brute.
    -   The brothers Jacob and Esau in the Book of Genesis. Esau is the Red Oni, an active hunter who is implied to be impulsive (he sells his birthright to Jacob in exchange for a bowl of stew), and is even described as having red hair on his body. Jacob is the Blue Oni, described as a studious young man who "dwells in tents" and is shown several times to be quite strategic and plotting.
-   Religious traditions often have contrasting denominations that can be boiled down to an emphasis on personal spirituality, devotion and religious expression (Red Oni) versus a focus on tradition, moral codes and religious authority (Blue Oni).
    -   Christianity—Catholicism (Red) and Protestantism (Blue). Orthodox is more on the Red side, but closer to the middle. Whereas the Latter-Day Saints is more Blue. And within Protestantism: Evangelicalism (Red) and Mainline (Blue).
    -   Islam—Sunni (Red) and Shi'a (Blue), though there are clear divisions within those categories as well.
        -   Within Sunni Islam, the Maturidi, Ashari (Blue), and Athari (Red) schools of theology, as well as the Salafi/Wahhabi (Red) movement. And within Shia Islam, there are the Twelvers (Red), Isma'ili and Zaydi (Blue) sects.
    -   Judaism—Somewhat complicated. While Orthodox definitely fits the Blue category, less stringent groups like Conservative and Reform also belong there too, since they champion a rational approach to religion. Hasidism and Chabad, while often thought of as ultra-Orthodox by outsiders, could be considered Red because of their revivalist nature.
    -   Buddhism: Mahayana and Vajrayana (Red) and Theravada (Blue).
    -   Indian subcontinent—Hinduism (Red) and Sikhism (Blue).
    -   Chinese traditions—Taoism (Red) and Confucianism (Blue).
    -   Japanese traditions—Shinto (Red) and Buddhism (Blue).

    Tabletop Games 

-   Siblings Grave and Jaina Stormborne from the _Fantasy Strike_ universe. Dedicated swordsman with wind powers versus hot-tempered archer with fire powers. Unsurprising, as it's a very deliberate _Street Fighter_ Homage and they're the Ryu and Ken analogues. Designer David Sirlin worked on _Street Fighter HD_ and _Puzzle Fighter_, and his games _Yomi_ and _Puzzle Strike_ were inspired by those games. but he ended up creating his own setting and characters rather than getting the license.
-   _Forgotten Realms_:
    -   Among the gods of war in the Faerûnian Pantheon, Tempus (supreme war god to whom virtually every combatant on the planet prays to on the eve of battle) and Garagos (god of bloodlust and destruction) are red, and the Red Knight (goddess of strategy and tactics) is blue.
-   _Traveller_: Vilani and Zhodani are Blue, Aslan and Vargr are Red. Solimani are sort of in between. The Third Imperium is a very Blue empire, but some of its member worlds are more red.
-   Games Workshop:
    -   _Warhammer_ has the High Elven twins Prince Tyrion (red, a Warrior Prince who enjoys combat and action) and Teclis (blue, a scholarly archmage who prefers diplomacy over fighting).
    -   _Warhammer 40,000_ features the loud, bombastic Colour Sergeant Kell serving under his Heterosexual Life-Partner, the calm, calculating Ursakar "Tactical Genius" Creed.
    -   Both settings include the Greenskin gods Gork and Mork. One is a god of cunning brutality who will hit you when you aren't looking, the other is brutally cunning and will hit you _really_ hard even if you are. The argument over which is which provides another excuse for Greenskins to kill time by killing each other.
    -   Played With in regards to Leman Russ, primarch of the viking-esque Space Wolves, and Lion El'Jonson, primarch of the scholarly Dark Angels. Russ gave the impression that he was a brash, brutal and wild barbarian, while in fact he was a very wise and scholarly man. El'Jonson on the other hand cultivated a more dignified and kingly mystique, but it was mostly a facade. When he got mad he was far worse and destructive than Russ, furthermore, he was arguably the most unnerving of all the primarchs, as nobody quite knew what to make of him. They were close friends despite their differences, though their respective chapters tend to forget that and only focus on the differences.
    -   Tzeentch and Khorne - Tzeentch is all about magic and planning stuff; he and all his daemons are primarily blue. Khorne is all about hitting stuff in the face without any planning, and he and all his daemons are primarily red. Same goes for Magnus and Angron and their respective chaos marine followers. (Ironically, Magnus's Thousand Sons sported red when they were loyalists and switch to blue after going to the dark side, while the World Eaters started with white and blue before they decided to stop washing their armor. Magnus himself however, remains red in title and color, despite being a blue oni at heart and serving a daemon god that is also primarily blue.)
    -   Angron and Kharn. Kharn was the equerry of Angron, and tried to calm Angron's fits of anger as much as possible. Kharn also crushed the back of two legions, World Eaters, his own legion and Emperor's Children at Battle of Skalathrax, because they sought safe zones under sub-zero weather that froze power armor, instead of fighting. Swell guy, isn't he? Now, just imagine how terrifying Angron was...

    Theatre 

-   Mozart's _The Abduction from a Seraglio_ has fiery mischievous Blonde (Red) and brooding, melancholy Konstanze (Blue), the lead soprano parts.
-   _A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder_: Sibella and Phoebe to a tee. They even wear giant pink and turquoise dresses, respectively.
-   In _Hamlet_ we have Laertes (Red) and Fortinbras (Red) contrasting with Hamlet (Blue), conforming to the The Zeroth Law of Trope Examples.
-   In _Jasper in Deadland_, Gretchen (red) is a passionate and carefree Antinihilist due to having nothing left to lose, while Jasper (blue) is an introverted and aloof Troubled Teen due to having watched his life fall apart and being unable to prevent it.
-   In the movie version of the musical Jekyll and Hyde (yes, the one with David Hasselhoff), Dr. Jekyll is shown with a red light<small>◊</small> (hard to tell in this picture, sorry) and Hyde is shown with a blue light shining on him<small>◊</small>.
-   In _Julius Caesar_ there is Cassius (red) and Brutus (blue). To a lesser extent, Octavius is also blue to Antony's red.
-   _The Lady from the Sea_ by Henrik Ibsen has the Wangel sisters: Hilde (red), and Bolette (blue).
-   To a degree, Henry Higgins (Red) and Colonel Pickering (Blue) from _Pygmalion_ and _My Fair Lady_, with Eliza Doolittle eventually playing Red Oni to Higgins's Blue.
-   _The Magic Flute_:
    -   The two main male roles, Papageno (red) and Tamino (blue). Papageno is the Plucky Comic Relief of the opera who is often very emotional and something of a Manchild, while Tamino plays the Straight Man to his antics and is more reserved and sensible. This is particularly evident when both are undergoing the trials of Isis — Tamino keeps a cool head and makes it through the trials almost without any effort, while Papageno has much more trouble trying to grasp the restrictions put on him and complains petulantly about them at various points.
    -   We also have Sarastro, the gentle, wise, and benevolent High Priest of Isis (Blue), and the much prouder, fiercer, and more dramatic Queen of the Night (Red).
-   In _Moriarty: A New Sherlock Holmes Adventure_, Irene Adler is the Red to Sherlock Holmes's Blue, although she is as clever as he is and stands on an equal footing with him.
-   French performances, _Moulin Rouge!_ (red) and _The Phantom of the Opera_ (blue) both contrast in their theme of love. Moulin Rouge shows love as lustful, animalistic and a way to control others. Phantom of the Opera shows love as sacred, romantic, and tender over forced. The villains, The Duke and The Phantom arguably show these differing themes best.
-   In _Oklahoma!_, incorrigible flirt Ado Annie is the red to her prim and proper blue best friend Laurey.
-   _Romeo and Juliet_ gives us Romeo (Red) and Benvolio (Blue), Mercutio (Red) and Benvolio (Blue), and even Romeo (Red) and Juliet (Blue).
-   In _Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead_, Rosencrantz is Red and Guildenstern is Blue.
-   Vladimir and Estragon in _Waiting for Godot_.
-   In _Wicked_ Elphaba (the red) has a fiery passion for social justice and is not afraid to publicly go against the grain to accomplish her goals. Glinda (the blue with a blue dress) is not as keen on rash decisions and tends to put on a soft-spoken, demure face for the public. The contrast between the two is best displayed in the song "Defying Gravity".

    Toys 

-   _BIONICLE_ started off featuring easily-angered Toa of Fire Tahu and No Social Skills Toa of Ice Kopaka. However, later teams would invert this; Jaller was a Toa of Fire yet calm and professional as The Captain, while his team's Toa of Ice, Matoro, was quiet but compassionate, determined, and The Chosen One. The Bara Magna setting has another inversion, as the fire tribe warrior Ackar is old and thoughtful, while his best friend, Kiina (with the water tribe), is a brash, sharp-tongued Ladette.
    -   Kopaka also works closely with Boisterous Bruiser Pohatu, with whom he has an Odd Friendship.
-   _Inhumanoids_ brought us the duo of Pyre (Fire spirit) and Crygen (Grey ice spirit), both of which can fuse together into the guardian of the Earth's core, Magnacore!
    -   As with the Earth Corps humans, Herc Armstrong is the fearless Red oni while Liquidator is the more calm and collected Blue oni. Although their file photo shirts are the otherway around, Herc's green exploration suit has more red on it than blue...while Liquidator's yellow suit has it the other way around.
    -   Of course, if you want Herc as the blue oni, contrast him with _bad boy_ Auger's red oni. And Liquidator can only be red oni to the blue oni of Dr. Derek Bright (who himself wears the blue exploration suit).
-   _Robo Force_, the mid 80's collection of action figure robots, played this trope very straight. Blazer, the igniter, is Red oni because he is very impulsive... not to mention that he uses flamethrowers as his weapons. But S.O.T.A. (State Of The Art), the creator, is Blue oni for being an inventive scientist with a calm demeanor. Also, both robots have their torsos in their respective colors.

    Web Animation 

-   In _Homestar Runner_, Strong Bad is the Red Oni to Strong Sad's Blue. Strong Bad is impulsive, brash, and rather violent, while Strong Sad is quiet, calm, and the smartest main character. Strong Bad is even red.

    Web Videos 

-   In _Critical Role_ Caleb and Nott are Platonic Life-Partners; however, Caleb is an introverted, thoughtful, studious human who prefers to live a cautious life, and Nott is an enthusiastic, impulsive young goblin who has a tendency towards Sticky Fingers.
-   _Kittisaurus_ features this via the ten cats. Some of the more noticeable dynamics are
    -   Dodo (loud, food obsessed Red) and Toto (quiet, calm Blue) with a good dose of Sibling Yin-Yang to boot.
    -   Nana (sociable and cheerful Red) and TT (cold and standoffish Blue).
    -   Momo (boisterous Red chairman of Momo Corp) and Coco (observant Blue professor studying the world around him)
    -   Chuchu is pretty much the shy and easygoing Blue to everyone else's Red. Lulu used to be the Red to everyone else's Blue due to him being a trouble making Big Eater, until Dodo showed up and made him look _peaceful_ by comparison.
    -   Claire took in a pair of black kittens for a day and brought them into her home. One of them spent his time meowing, hissing at and generally antagonizing the other cats when they came to have a look, and even squeezed through the baby gate to go exploring (Red). His brother remained in the kitchen and kept his distance from the others (Blue). Claire even remarked the first would turn out to be a troublemaker while the other was more well behaved.
-   Mike and Dave of _Civil Protection_.
