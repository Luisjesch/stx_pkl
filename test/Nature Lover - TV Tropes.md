_"Pretty countryside, ain't it? The grass and the light... there's a lot of ugly in this world, but there sure as hell is a lot of beauty. You'll see it better when you get older. It's tough at your age. Just... land and light, but to me? It's life. I can't explain it."_

This is about those who love the great outdoors and all that dwell therein. They may be a forest dweller themselves, or live in the countryside along with flocks of sheep where they commune with nature. It's also a safe bet that they'll either have a close bond with the local fauna, or at least have extensive knowledge of them. In their view, The World Is Just Awesome, so they want to spend as much time with it as possible and share it with others. Whereas ones who live in the city may often spend time at the park, or just Watching the Sunset. If they aren't satisfied with living in the city and would prefer living in one of the aforementioned locations, they suffer from Big Town Boredom.

Usually a sign of goodness, indicating a wholesome character uncorrupted by secularism. May also be exemplfied by a preference for going barefoot. Mostly a modern trope, found where most members of the audience live in cities and do not have to wrestle with nature's dangers and inconveniences regularly.

Characters of this nature are also fond of outdoor activities such as nature walks and camping, though they may be equally content with tending a flower garden. Hunting is also possible, though not as likely, given their respect for nature. They'll only hunt what they need, never for sport. The Forest Ranger and Nature Hero are prime examples because they live In Harmony with Nature and have an intrinsic understanding of its delicate balance. The Mountain Man who only hunts to survive may qualify.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  In modern settings, they'll usually be the only one to not dislike a camping trip.

Friend to All Living Things is a subtrope having more to do with their altruism, usually in regard to nature. May overlap with Nature Hero, which is another subtrope, about those who fight to protect and preserve the wild. See also Nature-Loving Robot when the character in question is a robot. Often overlaps with Animal Lover because animals are a part of nature. Contrast with the Ecocidal Antagonist, who instead opposes and attempts to pollute and destroy nature, signifying themselves as malicious, destructive, or selfish.

Their Patron God is usually a Nature Spirit or Fertility God. Also see and may overlap with the Outdoorsy Gal. May occur in Science Fiction in the Pastoral Science Fiction subgenre.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You_: Yamame not only cares about plants and animals, she cares about _weeds_.

    **Finland:** _\[suddenly popping out of a bush\]_ Nature is amazing, right?
    
-   Kars from _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_ seems to have a stunning respect for natural life, animals and the beauty of the world, to the point of having skewed priorities when it comes to humans. At one point he knocks a car aside to save a wild dog's life even though it (likely) resulted in the death of the driver, and sustains significantly worse wounds after falling off a cliff by knocking himself off the edges because if he had dead dropped, he would have crushed a patch of flowers. After becoming an Ultimate Life Form, Kars' first show of his new power is to mutate his hand into a squirrel... which then gorily murders and devours another squirrel, showing that he's on such a high from his new godlike power that he doesn't care, because the world's his playground now.
-   _The Secret Garden_: Dickon loves animals and is knowledgable on all sorts of fauna. He teaches Mary how to tend to the titular Neglected Garden and bring it back to life.
-   In the manga version of _Mega Man X4_, Colonel of the Repliforce has this trait. In a heartwarming flashback, he waxes poetic to Zero about how majestic the tree they are standing under is, and how, in his mind, it "embraces the nature of humanity". He says in times of despair and sorrow, as well as in times of happiness, he remembers the beauty of the tree to keep himself going and mentally sound.
    
    **Colonel:** It feels as though humans and nature are reconciled together.

-   In _Three to Triumph_ Luna stated that she was able to talk to trees and sense their needs and that she believed her magic had an affinity with anything green.

    Film — Live-Action

-   Julie Baker in _Flipped_ is very attached to the sycamore tree at her bus stop. Ever since Juli retrieved a kite at the uppermost branches, she has loved the view.

Kong seems to form a particular bond with her, going out of his way to secure her safety during his fight against Ramarak, and she stands up to Packard's insane quest to kill Kong and prove "that man is king".
    -   _Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)_: All three members of the Russell family (Madison, Mark and Emma) have an affinity for nature. Madison enjoys studying insect ecosystems outdoors, and she realizes what the Eco-Terrorists are doing is wrong and takes it upon herself to help stop King Ghidorah. Mark has a lifelong interest in animal communication, and (in a cynical take on this trope) he's isolated himself in the Colorado mountains as a wildlife photographer specifically to _escape_ being faced with his problems, but he also (when he doesn't have his head shoved up his ass from raging grief) recognizes the unbridled power of the Titans (living forces of nature) and is often one step ahead of Monarch at tracking Godzilla's activities. Emma studies Mothra in the Yunnan rainforest, she has a history of environmentalism, and she recognizes how ecologically-essential Titans are to the world's continued survival to the point that she's willing to turn to radical eco-terrorism if she thinks it'll save mankind from engineering their own extinction event.

    _"She had not known before what pleasures she had to lose in passing March and April in a town. She had not known before how much the beginnings and progress of vegetation had delighted her. What animation, both of body and mind, she had derived from watching the advance of that season which cannot, in spite of its capriciousness, be unlovely, and seeing its increasing beauties from the earliest flowers in the warmest divisions of her aunt's garden, to the opening of leaves of her uncle's plantations, and the glory of his woods."_

-   John Muir was definitely this as were Enos Mills and Emily Shore.
