A switching Point of View is closely related to, but distinct from, Rotating Protagonist. Rather than an omniscient third-person narrator showing us Jack, then Sally, then Pauline, as we would with a Rotating Protagonist, we see the story from Jack's perspective, then Sally's, then Pauline's. Can be very useful if the POV is third-person limited or first-person, as this can give us information we otherwise wouldn't have — for instance, we could find out that Pauline's motivations are genuinely good or she really did kill that guy, something neither Jack nor Sally would know.

The most obvious way to do this is to switch from Jack being "I" to Sally being "I," as even if they're both in the scene, it's clear whom the focus is on. A book can also pull this off with third-person limited (you see both as "s/he", but you're only inside one's head at a time). Primarily a literature trope, but a duet or film can also work. You just need narration of some sort.

Switching from first person (I) to second (you) or third (s/he) would also work. Obviously, this is quite useful if one character falls unconscious or ill, or is simply not where the author needs the story to be. This technique is a staple of postmodern literature, illustrating the instability of narratives and possibly truth itself.

Switching point of view frequently is sometimes called "head hopping".

Sister Trope to "Rashomon"-Style, but the accounts do not need to disagree or even overlap, and also Rotating Protagonist, but rather than simply seeing different characters, we get their perspectives. Super-Trope to Scrapbook Story. See also Twisted Echo Cut. When all main characters get their POV represented except one, it's a Non P.O.V. Protagonist. Not to be confused with Camera Perspective Switch, where the camera's point of view changes, or Perspective Reversal, where characters change their beliefs so that each expresses ideas formerly associated with the other.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the light novels of _High School D×D_, after Issei defeats Raiser, the light novels show that Lord Gremory and Lord Phenex discuss how the engagement party ended and that Lord Gremory cannot believe that his daughter was able to get the Welsh Dragon as her servant. In the anime, it shows the same events but from Sirzechs and Grayfia's point of view about why he lent Issei the griffon as a last resort and his thoughts on the Welsh Dragon joining. Grayfia then notes that Sirzechs seems to be enjoying it, probably reminding him of his and Grayfia's circumstances back then. In the main storyline, usually either Kiba or Azazel get to be the focus of the narration whenever Issei isn't around.
-   While there are several moments in _March Comes in Like a Lion_ where focus moves away from the protagonist and narrator Rei in order to listen in on conversations between other characters, Hina and Hayashida both hold the special distinction of momentarily taking over the role of narrator at least once, particularly when their thoughts are focused on Rei's life.
-   _Hakuouki_ did this with their OVA Sekkaroku with a different episode focusing on one character and their POV for the same story.
    -   Okita is the one to suggest Chizuru to be an undercover geisha for the Shinsengumi. But since he is ordered to stay at headquarters due to his coughing, Okita misses a lot of what happened that night and only hears and sees snippets of the story, like seeing Hijikata returning to headquarters with the dressed up Chizuru in the middle of the night.
    -   Saito and Yamazaki offer themselves as bodyguards for Chizuru and are involved in a lot of the fighting at the geisha house, starting with two lecherous men flirting with Chizuru.
    -   Heisuke is worried about Chizuru's safety during the whole time, returns to base to urge Kondou and Hijikata to take Chizuru off the mission. Kondou agrees and Heisuke rushes back to the house, wonders where Chizuru has disappeared to and then joins the fighting with Yamazaki.
    -   Hijikata, ordered by Kondou to check up on Chizuru, arrives at the geisha house in the middle of the fighting. Saito tells Hijikata to take Chizuru to safety. Unfortunately for him, bystanders mistakes him for eloping with a cute geisha girl.
    -   Kazama arrives after Heisuke left the room, attempting to kiss Chizuru. Osen then arrives to rescue Chizuru and allows her to escape and rejoin with Saito and later Hijikata.
-   _Fairy Tail_: Levy replaces Lucy as the narrator in Chapter 274. That's _not_ a good sign.
    -   This is actually because Future Lucy ends up returning to the past.
-   In _Sword Art Online_, most of the story is told from Kirito's first-person POV, but occasionally, the perspective will shift to a third-person POV centered around another character, and Lisbeth has two first-person POV segments- one in her story in Volume 2, and a short scene in Volume 4.
-   In the manga for _Persona 4_, the POV and first person narration occasionally switches around, most often focusing on Soji, but sometimes going to one of his friends.
-   _The Advent of Death's Daughter_ showcases multiple points of view chapters, not just how the main character, Maeda Naoko sees the world, but how other characters she interacts with see her, making their actions more understandable. Sometimes, this makes their actions more sympathetic, sometimes less so.

    Comic Books 

-   _Emmie And Friends_: In all but one book, the chapters alternate between the main narrator seen on the cover and a secondary P.O.V. character.
-   _Firefly: The Sting_: All four Serenity ladies take turns narrating. The part at the spa is told from Inara, then Kaylee, then Zoe's point of view as Saffron approaches them individually. The heist itself is told through different points of view as it progresses — first from Zoe's, then Inara's, then Kaylee's, then finally River's.
-   _Marvel Rising_ (2019): Each issue has a different character narrating. Issue #1 is Ms. Marvel, #2 is Inferno, #3 is Quake, #4 is Morgan, and #5 is Squirrel Girl.
-   _Spider-Man_:
    -   The caption narration of _Kraven's Last Hunt_ alternates between the points of view of Spider-Man (yellow background, with a few exceptions for emphasis), Kraven (orange), Vermin (green) and Mary Jane Watson\-Parker (lilac).
    -   Gerry Conway's graphic novel _Parallel Lives_ is narrated - a lot of the time in parallel - by Spider-Man and his wife Mary Jane.
-   _Vertigo Comics_: _Faker_ has each of its chapters narrated by another member of the core group.

    Fan Works 

-   _By the Sea_: Most of the story is from Obi-Wan's perspective, and a good part of the plot centers around the mismatch between what Obi-Wan believes is between him and Cody, and how Cody sees the situation with his differing cultural context. We don't see anything of Cody's until the second installment, plus a few snippets from the perspective of some other characters, like Ahsoka, Cody's mother, or Cody's POV of some scenes from the first story. These really drive home just how deeply different merfolk and human culture are.
-   _Child of the Storm_ does this frequently, with most of its characters getting scenes from their point of view, including Harry Dresden's signature First-Person Smartass. Early on, this was something of a problem since it tended to shift perspective between paragraphs with little or no warning. Later, scene breaks were added and have been retroactively added to some of the earlier chapters.
-   Most _Dæmorphing_ fics have multiple narrators per chapter.
-   _My Immortal_, although the issue is confused by bad writing. The POV character is usually Ebony, but one chapter starts with a note that this chapter is from "Darko"'s point of view. This rule is followed for a bit, but then one line starts with "Draco, Ebory and I", and after that it's back to Ebony's point of view.
-   _Deserving_, in which you're lucky if any given paragraph ends in the same POV as it began and it often switches mid-sentence, is another bad example.
-   _Entropy: The Fate of the Hero System_: The story switches between its cast of new hero students and its villains, as well as featuring news articles and social media posts where appropriate.
-   _Fuck The Jesus Beam_, beginning in chapter nine.
-   _Kyon: Big Damn Hero_, where the breaks are usually followed by a change of narrator.
-   _Luminosity_'s narrators to date have been Bella, Elspeth, and Addy when Elspeth is asleep/unconscious during an important part.
-   _Love Takes Flight_ changes points of view between Chance Furlong and Jake Clawson during their first sexual encounter. What is unique about this switching is that the sentences at changing points overlap, sharing a word (or group of words).
    -   eg. Chance's POV: _If that wasn't love then...._ Jake's POV: _What was it Chance saw in him?_ In this case Chance's full thought is "If that wasn't love then what was?"
-   _A Dark Knight over Sin City_ alternates between Batman's narration or the POVs of various _Sin City_ characters every chapter.
-   _Winter War_ switches between about thirty POV characters (third person limited throughout). Most chapters stick with one person's POV, but several "ensemble" chapters juggle several. This allows many, _many_ Ascended Extras a chance to shine.
    -   Worth noting that in Hisagi's sections, his narration becomes increasingly vague and Kazeshini's interjections more frequent, which eventually leads to the zanpakuto spirit (briefly) possessing his wielder's body so that both of them can survive. At which point, _Kazeshini_ is the narrator with Shuuhei not heard from for a chapter or so.
-   _Xanatos_ does this a few times, in third person from Light's point of view, and later with L's, and even having Matt narrate a couple of chapters.
-   Used throughout _With Strings Attached_. The four get more or less equal time from their individual viewpoints, but there are also a few sections where other points of view are employed:
    -   The short passage about the Brothers of Doom preparing to be attacked (and then getting attacked—in a totally unexpected way).
        
        It was a pity they'd never heard of the Maginot Line.
        
    -   Several scenes with Bayanis.
    -   A scene from the POV of the two guards confronting George outside the building where John is being kept in magical sleep.
    -   The collective POV of the skahs who have finished off the monsters in Ehndris and are wondering what to do next.
-   The stories in the _Elemental Chess Trilogy_ have this, with the point of view changing in each chapter. The more central characters receive multiple chapters from their perspectives, but many of the supporting cast also each get a chapter.
-   In _Rotten Luck_, the narration is in first-person from the perspective of the protagonist on the odd-numbered chapters while it becomes third-person on the even-numbered ones.
-   Almost every character in _The Movement_ narrates at least one chapter.
-   Every fic in _Lilo & Stitch: The Series_ fanfic series _The Starlight Series_ features this, except for _Alpha and Omega_, which is told from the first-person perspective of Experiment 419.
-   The _Mike, Lu & Og_ fanfic _When Mike Met Mike_ is told from a few different points of view.
-   In _Utopia Unmade_, the focus switches between Tsubomi, Erika, Hibiki, Kanade, Love, and Eas every chapter.
-   In _Diaries of a Madman_, Discord occasionally takes over the narration from Navarone. Rarity also briefly narrates during a "Freaky Friday" Flip.
-   In Pottertalia fic _Snakeskins_ the POV regularly switched between England and Italy, with the odd other POV (e.g. Draco Malfoy or Romano) added in on certain situations.
-   Used every chapter in _Wreckstuck_, where the point of view switches to a different character every chapter.
    -   The same formula is used in _Alternian Nation Series_ and _Cultstuck_ will sometimes shift to another character at a different time.
-   The writer of _Origin Story_ is pretty good about switching the POV of the story without making it seem awkward. Most of the story is told from Alex Harris's point of view, but other characters, including Tony Stark, Happy Hogan, Henry Peter Gyrich, and even Typhoid Mary get a chance to tell the tale from their perspective.
-   _Bad Future Crusaders_ uses a Switching P.O.V. to tell what could probably suffice as three or four different plots as one.
-   _The End of All Things_ occasionally switches between first and third person view to either show two sides to a single event or to show what two characters are doing in two different locations.
-   _Developments_ and _Sisterhood both maintain the same first-person present tense narration as_ Katawa Shoujo'', but switch between various members of the cast narrating each individual chapter, rather than staying with Hisao.
-   The _Worm_ fanfiction _Intrepid_ has the story switches between Taylor, Emma, Madison, and Sophia, with other characters getting interludes. No character has had two chapters told from the P.O.V twice in a row.
-   _Sudden Contact_ alternates between various characters from _Mass Effect_ and _StarCraft_ such as Adrien Victus, James Raynor, Alexei Stukov, Tassadar, Daggoth, and Liara T'soni. _Sudden Supremacy_ adds Zaeed Massani, Tychus Findlay, Garrus Vakarian, Tali'Zorah, David Anderson, Valerian Mengsk, and Selendis.
-   _The Quiet Fox_ (a Naruto story) combines this with flashbacks since almost every other chapter is narrated by a different person. Oddly, Naruto himself doesn't get to narrate a chapter despite being the main character.
-   In _This Bites!_, the entirety of the event with Baron Omatsuri is told through the perspectives of people around the world as they listen to the SBS and the horror in which the Straw Hats have found themselves.
-   The _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ story _All This Sh\*t is Twice as Weird_ does this, with most chapters having different points of view than those which immediately precede or follow them. A few chapters divide the point of view between the two main characters; a few others are presented as letters written by or to various members of the cast.
-   _One Year_ is told by first person narration, a role that various members of the _Persona 4_ cast and OCs take turns playing.
-   _Black Crayons_ rotates through numerous characters in the _Transformers Film Series_.
-   _A Chance Meeting of Two Moons_: The story changes from Artemis to Luna's point of view (signaled by linebreaks) during the first five chapters. From chapter 6 on, there are two parallel versions of each chapter, one told from the POV of Artemis in Luna's world and the other from the POV of Luna in Artemis's world. Some of them even show the same sequence of events from the differing characters' point of view.
-   _The Pieces Lie Where They Fell_: On a regular basis, as the first six chapters are told from the point of view of one of the main characters (Xvital, Night Blade, Page Turner, Wind Breaker, Vix-Lei and Rex, in that order), and then switch up over the course of the rest of the story as the situation calls for it, with occasional P.O.V. segments by various other characters. Incidentally, over the course of chapters 1-48 (and not counting omakes), each of the new Bearers gets exactly eighteen segments each... and all the other characters, put together, _also_ get a total of eighteen segments. (The authors swear this last part was completely unintentional.) It continues in the sequel _Picking Up the Pieces_, though characters outside the new Bearers are getting more segments of their own this time around.
-   _Of State_: So far, the POV has switched between Elsa, Hiccup, Snotlout, Anna, and Kristoff. All of whom are dealing with their own problems. Hiccup is trying to capture Mathantir and defeat the Northern Alliance. Snotlout is occupying Radvo and holding the entire city hostage in an attempt to rescue the Vikings that were kidnapped and Made a Slave there. Elsa is working with her ruling council to try and combat a potential Viking invasion. Finally, Anna and Kristoff are trying to deal with their relationship with each other and the people around them.
-   Each chapter of _What Tomorrow Brings_ is told from the perspective of a different character. At first, it seems like it'll go through the Animorphs in the same order as the books, but then Tom is introduced in chapter 6 and several supporting characters get to narrate from then on.
-   _You'll Get No Answers from the Blue Sea Star_: The vast majority of the story is told by Jo, but Seteth takes over for the brief description of Jeralt's death.
-   A handful of _Law & Order: UK_ stories written by Airborne Girl based around a relationship between Alesha Philips and Matt Devlin are usually told from Alesha's point of view, but will often have a section from Matt's perspective. Sometimes to the point of Perspective Flip—we'll get both Alesha and Matt's version of a confrontation or conversation they had.
-   After the first three chapters (which are strictly from Lilith's POV) of _The Silver Raven_, the POV starts switching back and forth. For example, chapter 4 switches between Lilith's POV and Nero's POV, while chapter 5 switches between Nero's POV and Emira's POV.
-   The POV in _BlazBlue Alternative: Remnant_ shifts around from character-to-character within a chapter. For example, Chapter 20 starts from Glynda's perspective, then shifts to Ragna's, then Noel's, and finally Ozpin's. Some chapters are told entirely from one perspective however, with Chapter 32 being entirely from Ragna's perspective, Chapter 41 being entirely from Ironwood's perspective, and Chapter 45 being entirely from Glynda's perspective.
-   _Forever Captain_: While most of this MCU series is told in third person limited to Steve Rogers, currently the one exception is _The Favor_, limited instead to Tony Stark. It’s clear that this choice is because the whole point of the story requires a particular dramatic irony— that the audience knows the true identity of Uncle Grant, but Tony doesn’t.
-   _The Second Most Important Person in the World_, a _Toy Story_ Sid/Andy fic focused on the human characters, switches between several different perspectives outside of Sid and Andy's throughout, including Molly, Andy's mother, Sid and Andy's adopted daughter, and Woody, in the final chapter.
-   _The Mountain and the Wolf_: Most or all the narration is given from the perspective of the Westeros characters. The major exception is Akkarulf, one of the Wolf's marauders who serves as The Watson for anything Warhammer-related, which is itself a clue that he was better known as Theon Greyjoy.
-   In _What a Strange Little Colt_, Rainbow Dash is the main Point of View, but there are many sections told from other characters’ perspectives.

    Films — Animation 

-   Between the end of _The Incredibles_ and the introductory scene of _Incredibles 2_. Via flashback, the rise of the Underminer is seen not from the Parr family's viewpoint, but from Innocent Bystander Tony Rydinger's. It's a lot more unsettling to have a supervillain bursting through the ground with his giant drill vehicle, and having cars crashing down around when you don't have superpowers.
-   _The Lion King (1994)_: During the gorge scene, we briefly shift to the hyena's POV as they get the signal from Scar to start the wildebeest stampede; after that, it shifts to Simba's POV as he practices his roaring in the gorge, and the wildebeests start charging right for him after he pulls off a loud, impressive roar, making it seem like his roar frightened the wildebeests into the gorge which eventually led to the death of Mufasa.
-   _Turning Red_: Almost the entire film is shown following Mei's point of view occasionally switching to Ming's. Toward the climax it switches to Jin's briefly and for one shot in the epilogue Grandma Wu's.
-   _Zootopia_: Almost the entire film is shown following Judy's point of view. However, during the climax, for a few moments it shifts to Bellwether's perspective. Storywise this is done to shield the audience from the Batman Gambit Nick and Judy have set up so the audience gets the same sense of surprise as Bellwether when she discovers she's been hustled.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Asako I & II_: Asako is the protagonist in the first part, in which she meets Baku. Then as she meets Ryohei, we are shown his point of view as she act in a very strange manner. When she finds out that Baku is around again, the POV is on her again and we no longer know what the men think.
-   _The Bridge Curse_: The film focuses on two storylines, and shifts between them regularly. There's the students in 2016 who are haunted after a bravery test on "The Dead Female Bridge", and the Intrepid Reporter investigating their deaths in 2020.
-   _Exit Through the Gift Shop_ has a very peculiar take on this, largely based in the fact that this film is effectively a Documentary. While its subjects are ultimately of street art and Banksy, the documentary initially follows up-and-coming artist Thierry Guetta/Mr. Brainwash as he learns more of street art and finding Banksy, but halfway through the film, he begins to be framed much more unsympathetically, with focus instead shifting onto Banksy and Shepard Fairey trying to wrangle in the arrogant hack they helped indirectly create. This ended up raising real-world questions on whose project this documentary actually was, with a prevailing theory that it was all a staged bit of performance art by _Banksy_ as his commentary on art culture and deliberately screwing with audiences.

    Literature 

-   _4 Kids in 5E and 1 Crazy Year_: Destiny, Max, Giovanni, and Willie take turns narrating several pages of each chapter.
-   _Dracula_ is composed of a collection of journals and letters that describe the story from the point of view of various characters. It slips up in one case, where Mrs. Harker refers to herself in third person in chapter XXVI (where she is writing a journal but mentions the others made details that she didn't hear.)
-   Victorian mystery novelist Wilkie Collins did this more than once, most notably in his classics _The Moonstone_ and _The Woman in White_. Each novel was divided up into several different first-person narratives, with occasional other sources like "The Narrative of the Tombstone".
-   _The Hardy Boys_ naturally utilizes this, having two main characters who, along with their friends, frequently divide and conquer to cover more ground. As such, the narrative will jump between the two brothers until they regroup. The early _Casefiles_ books are also much more liberal with the narrative, briefly following the thoughts and opinions of several other characters besides the Hardys (including one-shot characters and Mooks).
    -   The reboot _Undercover Brothers_ and _Adventures_ series are told in first-person with Frank and Joe alternating chapters, meaning that the books are constant POV switches between the two of them.
    -   Very similarly, in the first _Nancy Drew_: _Girl Detective_ (Nancy's counterpart series to _Undercover Brothers_) super special, "Where's Nancy?", Bess and George get this in a major Day in the Limelight for them. Usually, the GD series is narrated solely by Nancy in first-person, but since she's missing for most of the book, George and Bess alternate first-person chapters, with the last chapter finally switching back to Nancy.
    -   The _Nancy Drew / Hardy Boys Super Mysteries_ of the _GD/UB_ rotate the first-person p.o.v. between all three of them (Nancy, Frank, and Joe).
-   _Murder for the Modern Girl_: The novel switches between the first-person perspectives of its two protagonists, Ruby Newhouse and Guy Rosewood. The name of the character whose perspective is being followed is written on top of the first page of a chapter. After Guy's true name, Peter Buchanan, is revealed in chapter 21, all chapters told from his perspective have "Peter" written instead.
-   _The Silver Kiss_, by Annette Curtis Klause, switches between Zoë and Simon. The switch is between third-person limited to one or the other, and their respective chapters are named after the proper protagonist.
-   _Oksa Pollock_ does this between the good characters, although the most parts are told by Oksa.
-   Done so well by Pulitzer Prize winner Michael Shaara in his novel _The Killer Angels_ (the basis for the 1993 film _Gettysburg_) that his son Jeff Shaara has copied the technique in every one of his own novels.
-   In _The Migax Cycle_,the story alternates between Summer and Leafsong's point of view, both in third person limited.
-   Each chapter in _The Innkeepers Song_ by Peter S. Beagle is told from a different character's perspective.
-   _Flipped_ by Wendelin Van Draanen switches between romantic leads, and even the back cover takes this. One of them is upside-down, but which is a little bit up to the reader.
-   _The Poisonwood Bible_ switches between the four daughters' points of view, with their mother's point of view appearing at the beginning and in retrospect of each section of the book.
-   Charles Dickens's _Bleak House_ alternates chapters between the first-person perspective of Esther Summerson and the third-person perspective of an omniscient narrator.
-   Jodi Picoult does this in pretty much all her novels, sometimes in first and sometimes third person.
-   _Something Like... Series_: Each book in the series is from the point of view of a different character.
-   _Soon I Will Be Invincible_: Alternates between Dr. Impossible and Fatale.
-   Some William Faulkner novels alternate chapters among the first-person perspective of several narrators, often relating the same events. It switched narrators _within the same sentence_ at least once. His books that follow this include:
    -   _Absalom, Absalom!_
    -   _As I Lay Dying_
    -   _The Sound and the Fury_
-   _The Lover_ (_Ha-Me'ahev_), by Israeli novelist A. B. Yehoshua, which bears the influence of Faulkner's works, switches between the first-person perspectives of members of a Jewish family and an Arab teenager who works for and comes to live with them, each chapter.
-   _Lord of the Rings_ starts to do this in _The Two Towers_. The first half of the book is split between Aragorn's party and the Merry and Pippen hobbit duo. Second half of the book is Frodo, Sam, and Sméagol. _Return of the King_ does a similar mid-way switch, with the two halves of each story taking place concurrently.
-   Kristine Kathryn Rusch's _Fey_ novels, where the viewpoint switches to a new character with each new chapter.
-   _Mrs. Dalloway_ alternates between following the title character and Shell-Shocked Veteran Septimus.
-   _This Is Where It Ends_: The book is told through four different perspectives: Autumn, Sylv, Claire, and Thomás.
-   _Thursday Next_ books usually have someone else narrating the events Thursday wasn't there to witness.
    -   In _The Eyre Affair_, Mycroft's adventure with the Prose Portal is described in third person.
    -   In _Something Rotten_, Landen briefly picks up narration duties when Thursday gets shot.
    -   _First Among Sequels_ is the most confusing example of this, as the narration switches from the real Thursday Next to the _written_ Thursday Next.
-   _Legend of the Galactic Heroes_ switches back and forth between the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance and their two protagonists, Reinhard von Lohengramm and Yang Wenli. Reinhard and his Empire is the more important side, however, making Yang Wenli the deuteragonist.
-   George R.R. Martin's _A Song of Ice and Fire_. The viewpoint character changes every chapter and there have been 31 viewpoint characters through the first five books. This series is one of the more prominent examples due to the multitude of conflicting factions, almost all of which have at least one P.O.V. character representing them and sometimes multiple to represent different mindsets within each faction, fueling the Gray-and-Grey Morality the series is famous for. For example, the Battle of Blackwater is mostly depicted from the P.O.V.s of Tyrion and Davos, two sympathetic characters on opposite sides.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   We follow Harry's point of view throughout 90% of the series, with the exception of the opening chapters of _Philosopher's Stone_, _Goblet of Fire_, _Half-Blood Prince_ (first two chapters), and _Deathly Hallows_, which have important establishing events that Harry's not present for (although in the case of _Goblet of Fire_, he sees them in a dream).
    -   There is one other exception: during Harry's first Quidditch match in _Philosopher's Stone_, we are told what Hermione and Ron are doing and saying, even though Harry is not paying special attention to them and would not be able to hear them.
    -   There is also, somewhat bizarrely, a couple of sentences from Ron's point of view as he knocks out the troll in _Philosopher's Stone_. Overall, point of view seems a little more flexible in book 1 than it is later in the series.
-   The _Everworld_ books rotate among the five main characters the role of the narrator.
-   _Animorphs_, another series by the same author as _Everworld_, does the same thing. They rotate by book in a set order (also Ax and Tobias share the same slot (Getting half as many books as the others) and alternate when their shared slot pops up.) Also the Megamorph side stories alternate by chapter and at least once one of the heroes narrates from beyond the grave._The Hork-Bajir Chronicles_ rotates POV between Aldrea, Dak, and Esplin.
-   The _The Babysitters Club_ books feature rotating first-person protagonists.
-   The _Deep Water Black_ books were each written from the viewpoint of a new character.
-   Emily Rodda's _Teen Power Inc.._ series rotates the role of narrator among the six members of the core cast.
-   Anthony Price's thriller novels all feature the same group of intelligence officers, but each features a different member of the group as the key player and point-of-view character.
-   Terry Pratchett likes to switch to the point-of-view of someone about to meet a tragic end.
-   Emily Brightwell's _Mrs Jeffries_ series has scenes begin from the victim's point of view, with enough detail to be interesting but not enough to act as a spoiler.
-   Terry Goodkind does this a lot in _Sword of Truth_, especially noteworthy though is in the first book where the POV has been on the male main character most of the book (except one small part when he is unconscious) until around half of the book where the POV changes to the female main character. This is done to put more info on her personality and her secret and also to show that she also feels an attraction to him.
-   Several of Kelley Armstrong's books (_Haunted_ and _Personal Demon_, for example) switch between several narrators, with each chapter being told by a different one.
-   _The Wheel of Time_ regularly switches POV between around 10 main characters. The books will also regularly include POV chapters of side characters depending on how Robert Jordan wished to show extra information. Or hide it.
-   _The Rules of Attraction_ by Bret Easton Ellis is narrated by several characters; all of the more important ones narrate at least one chapter.
-   Pretty much everything ever written by Harry Turtledove runs on this trope. Most of his series have a minimum of 5 or 6 POV characters per volume, allowing him to describe various aspects of a large-scale event (like a war on multiple fronts, as seen by generals, soldiers, and civilians).
-   _The Man in the Brown Suit_ by Agatha Christie switches between the protagonist's narration and excerpts from a different character's journal, both in first person.
-   Every book in the _Wicked Lovely_ series switches between (usually three, although Fragile Eternity has four and stopping time has only two) different third person POVs.
-   Irvine Welsh's _Trainspotting_ and its sequel, _Porno_, switch between characters (each with their own personal verbal tics and dialects) in each chapter.
-   _How NOT to Write a Novel_ has several examples of what can go wrong when a Switching P.O.V. is poorly executed or unintentional.
-   The _Knight and Rogue Series_ alternates between Michael and Fisk's perspective with each chapter.
-   Starting from _Warrior Cats: The New Prophecy_, _Warrior Cats_ has multiple protagonists, switching POV between them every few chapters.
-   The chapters in Ibi Kaslik's _The Angel Riots_ switch between a limited third-person narration centred on Rize, the titular rock band's drug-addled trombonist, and first-person narration by Jim, a violinist touring with the Riots.
-   All the books in Jo Walton's Alternate History _Small Change_ trilogy. Each of the novels is structured with alternating chapters from the point of view of Inspector Carmichael (3rd person), and a young woman writing in the 1st person: Lucy Kahn in _Farthing_, Viola Larkin in _Ha'Penny_, and Elvira Royston in _Half a Crown_.
-   Each book in the _Havemercy_ series by Jaida Jones and Danielle Bennett rotates first-person perspective through four protagonists.
-   The books in Rick Riordan's _The Heroes of Olympus_ series switch between the formulaic Two Guys and a Girl in third-person from chapter-to-chapter.
    -   _The Lost Hero_ alternates with Jason, Piper, and Leo.
    -   _The Son of Neptune_ alternates with Percy, Hazel, and Frank.
    -   _The Mark of Athena_ alternates with Annabeth, Leo, Piper, and Percy.
    -   _The House of Hades_ alternates with all seven titular Heroes of Olympus; Percy and Annabeth narrate for their side of the story, while the other five narrate their own side.
    -   _The Blood of Olympus_ alternates with Jason, Piper, and Leo in one story arc, and Nico and Reyna for the other.
-   Seems common for Riordan to do this, as he also does this in _The Kane Chronicles_, switching between Carter and Sadie. As they're both written in first person, they also switch between English dialects - American for Carter, British for Sadie.
-   Each volume of _Dirge for Prester John_ contains three books, and the frame narrative of Hiob, or his assistance Alaric.
-   The two published volumes of Charles Stross' _Halting State_ series do this. The narrative alternates between the perspectives of three people involved in the case (with the occasional interlude), all written in the second person.
-   _Brave New World_ begins with an Intro Dump courtesy of Thomas, the Director, and periodically switches to Bernard a few times before settling on the latter. After John's introduction about halfway through the book, Bernard is phased out in favor of him, at which point Thomas disappears completely after a startling revelation.
-   The story of _The Pillars of the Earth_ is told from the POV of 5 characters, one of them a villain.
-   In _Tunnel in the Sky_, Caroline takes over for Rod as the POV character, via her diary, while he's scouting for a new colony site.
-   _Good Omens_ has point of view switch between many different characters, including, but not limited to, Crowley, Aziraphale, Newt Pulsifer, and Anathema Device.
-   Jim Butcher's _Codex Alera_ series loves this trope. For the first couple of books, our four points of view are Tavi, Amara, Fidelias, and Isana, although other characters will sometimes get sections in the prologue. Fidelias disappears for most of book 3, and Ehren takes his place as a point of view character. Fidelias (as Marcus) comes back for book 4, and the rest of the series mainly rotates POV between the five of them, with occasional diversions.
-   Robert Silverberg's _The Book Of Skulls_ has 4 PoVs, all first person. He's said that he found getting the voices right and distinct quite difficult. And it wasn't like he was new in the field at the time!
-   Robert A. Heinlein does this in _The Number of the Beast_, with narration switching among the four principal characters (Lazarus Long also gets to narrate a chapter). The epilogue is told in the usual third person.
-   Robin Hobb does this both in _The LiveShip Traders_ and _The Rain Wild Chronicles_ series.
-   _Of Fear and Faith_ is a first-person example of this, with all eight of the main characters getting a chance to be the viewpoint character, occasionally all in the same chapter.
-   _The Year of the Flood_ switches point of view between Ren and Toby. The two narrative eventually meet and continue on.
-   In _World War_ pretty much every chapter is a different character from either a different country or from the invading Race itself.
-   _Timeline-191_, by the same author as Worldwar, follows a similar pattern of a different POV each chapter, replacing them when they die with other characters previously introduced as non-POV.
-   In _Star Carrier_, the chapters switch between the Admiral in charge of the fleet, one of the Starhawk pilots, as well as the aliens humanity is at war with.
-   Elisabet Nemert and Simona Ahrnstedt are two Swedish writers, who will use this all the time.
    -   Elisabet Nemert will have a female protagonist, and the novel will be the story of her life. But over the course of the book, we also get to see the perspective of her family members, her friends, her future love interest and even her antagonists.
    -   Simona Ahrnstedt will have two protagonists: A woman and a man, who are the central love couple. But just like Elisabet Nemert, Simona will show us the perspective of different family members, friends and even antagonists.
-   _First Light_: Peter and Thea get alternating chapters.
-   _Young Wizards_: Nita's POV is in every book, but in the third book, Dairine gets to share some POV. Kit gets to share POV starting in book five. In books seven and eight, the three share POVs. In the ninth book, it goes back to just Nita and Kit.
-   _The Demonata_ switches between the three main characters. Grubbs narrates the most books by far though.
-   _Edenborn_ has chapter breaks for Pandora, Haji, Penny, Halloween, and Deuce. The author also uses different writing styles for each.
-   The Disney / Pixar film _Cars_ does this for the first volume of the short-lived _Cars Origins_ series, _Struck by Lightning_. The book's Framing Device where the Radiator Springs gang goes camping is told in a third-person narrative, while the chapters focusing on the flashbacks to Lightning McQueen's early racing days are told in first-person narrative by Lightning himself.
-   _Clocks that Don't Tick_ is written from the alternating perspectives of Gary, Martha, and Charlemagne. Gary's is the most casual and plebeian, featuring an abundance of contractions, and often times merely implying the subject of a sentence rather than writing it out (ie: _Decided to approach him_ rather than _I decided to approach him)._ Martha's perspective is a little better, though she tends to go on tangents, crazily talk to her imaginary friends, and features occasional grammatical mishaps such as _Me and my three friends_ rather than _My three friends and I_. Charlemagne's perspective is written the most intelligently, using few contractions and having minimal grammatical errors.
-   Stephen King's _Christine_. Book I is _Dennis: Teenage Car-Songs_, told from Dennis Guilder's First-Person Perspective. In Book II, _Arnie: Teenage Love-Songs_, King switches to an omniscient narrator, since Dennis is hospitalized at the time and unable to be where the action is to narrate it. Book III, _Christine: Teenage Death-Songs_, switches back to Dennis's first-person P.O.V.
-   _Veniss Underground_ is split into three sections. The first focuses on Nicholas and is written in first person; the second focuses on Nicola and is written in second person; and the third focuses on Shadrach and is written in third person.
-   The book series _The Phoenix Files_ switches between Luke, Peter and Jordan, each of them narrating two of the six books in the series.
-   The official novelization of the Disney / Pixar film _Inside Out_, called _Driven By Emotions_, tells the events of the film from the perspective of all five of the emotions, starting with Joy, then Disgust, next Fear, then Anger and finally Sadness. This means that for certain events in the film, as many as five different takes are presented.
-   _Lorien Legacies_ does this regularly. From the second book (titled _The Rise Of Six_) the writer has been kind to show the switching narrator (between Marina and John) with different type fonts, and in the third book it properly announces which P.O.V it is, but from then the P.O.V still switches without it being shown.
-   _Run_ swaps between Bo's perspective in the present as she and Agnes run away, and Agnes' in the past as the two girls grow into best friends.
-   Occurs in several of Freeman Wills Crofts' detective novels.
    -   In _The Cask_, the first chapter is written from the point of view of the man who finds the body; the next two-thirds of the novel follow the police inspector investigating the crime and arresting the prime suspect; and in the last third, the protagonist is a private detective trying to disprove the police case.
    -   In the first half of _Golden Ashes_, the viewpoint character is Betty Stanton, a young widow (and aspiring novelist) who finds work as a housekeeper. A mystery develops at the house she's looking after, and the second half follows Inspector French as he investigates.
-   Many of David Levithan's collaborations with other writers exhibit this. Typically each writer takes on a character and the chapters alternate between their viewpoints.
    -   _Will Grayson, Will Grayson_: John Green as Will Grayson #1, David Levithan as perpetually-lowercase will grayson #2.
    -   _You Know Me Well_: Nina LaCour as Kate, David Levithan as Mark.
    -   _Naomi and Ely's No Kiss List_: Aside from the two titular characters, it also features multiple side characters' POVs.
-   _The Raven Cycle_, while narrated in third-person, nevertheless focuses on a specific character's experiences and inner thoughts each chapter. A given book may put more weight on a certain character, or less. For example, _The Dream Thieves_ is a Ronan-heavy book while its sequel _Blue Lily, Lily Blue_ is a Blue- (and Adam-)centric book with no Ronan chapters at all.
-   _Fate/Zero_ switches perspective between the seven master-servant pairs. The first three books mostly focuses on Saber and Irisviel, while Kiritsugu barely gets any spotlight at all until the fourth book.
-   In _The Star_, a Short Story by H. G. Wells, the story is in omniscient third-person, describing how events play out from Earth's perspective. For the very last paragraph, however, the perspective shifts to Mars, explaining their perception of the recent events.
-   Done frequently in _Vic and Frank: Necromancers_, as each chapter starts with a different point of view than the last. Some characters only get one chapter, while Vic, Frank, and the Reanimated Woman get multiple chapters.
-   _The Most Beautiful Moment In Life: The Notes_ is written in the form of diary-style entries over the course of several years, with the point of view alternating between each one of the seven boys. Each entry or "note" has the narrating character's name and the date on the title. Since this story deals with the group's separations and reunions (and one character's attempt to save and reunite them), this serves to show each one of the main characters' separate struggles and journey (starting with their childhoods), and to reveal various plot points that are only known by one or more characters.
-   The second _Xandri Corelel_ novel, _Tone of Voice_, alternates between Xandri and Diver's viewpoints.
-   Isaac Asimov:
    -   "C-Chute": Each of the six protagonists takes a turn narrating the events, starting with Colonel Windham, and cycling around until the story ends with Stuart's perspective.
    -   "The Message": The Intro-Only Point of View changes to George, a college student time-travelling for original research on a paper.
    -   "Spell My Name with an S": The story changes perspectives for every scene, but always remains in Third-Person Limited. Dr Zebatinsky/Sebatinsky, The Protagonist, is present for less than half of the narrative.
-   Mary Higgins Clark will have intermittent chapters of her books told from the killers POV while still not identifying him, leaving the reader to continue to speculate as to his identity.
-   _Forbidden_ alternates chapters between Lochan and Maya’s first person POVs.
-   The first eight chapters of _The Grim Reaper's Apprentice_ are told from Jax's POV, but the ninth and final one is from the Grim Reaper's.
-   The Novelization of _Forbidden Planet_ switches between several characters as narrator, including Morbius at one point.
-   In _Witch World: The Crystal Gryphon_ by Andre Norton the odd chapters are told by Kerovan and even — by Joisan, two sides in an Arranged Marriage, which would turn out much better than anybody expected.
-   _One Of These Days Earthquake In Ligon_ by Kir Bulychev has a cast of _ten_ somewhat unreliable narrators with different agendas. Alternating with fictious news articles, telegrams, dossiers, fragments from real and fictious books.
-   _Ungifted_: The P.O.V. switches multiple times over the course of the book, from Donovan's, to the Daniels', to Chloe's, to Dr. Schultz's, to Noah's, etc.
    -   The same with its sequel, _Supergifted_. The P.O.V. switches between Donovan, Noah, The Daniels, and Megan Mercury.
-   In _A Frozen Heart_, the novel based on the Disney film _Frozen_, the narration is almost equally shared between Anna and Hans in third person limited, switching between chapters.
-   _Redeeming Love_ is written in third person limited, switching between Angel, Michael, and sometimes Paul between paragraphs.
-   _Treasure Island_: Most of the story is narrated by main character Jim Hawkins. For practical reasons, Doctor Livesey picks up the narration when important events occur that Jim didn't witness.
-   _Full Disclosure:_ Every 4-10 pages, the story switches to a different character's third-person POV. No character has more than 6 POV scenes, and President Ericson doesn't get one of his own until the last 100 pages.
-   _Star Wars: Honor Among Thieves_ is in third-person limited narration from Han Solo's point of view, except for Chapter 6. As Han searches for Rebel spy Scarlet Hark in the guise of an Imperial officer, every interaction he has with one of the locals is shown from the other's point of view, as they are intimidated, charmed, and/or exasperated by this oddly scruffy lieutenant. Scarlet's own POV is shown when he finally finds her.
-   In _Asperger Sunset_, Russ and Misty take turns narrating in the third person limited.
-   _The Rudest Alien on Earth_: Chapters alternate between Oluu and the human kids' points of view.
-   The first three _Seekers_ books rotate between the third-person limited perspectives of Kallik, Lusa, and Toklo each chapter; Ujurak gets focus chapters starting with the fourth book.
-   _InCryptid_: Sarah takes over narration duties in _Midnight Blue-Light Special_ for a few chapters after Verity is knocked unconscious and taken prisoner by the Covenant. Later on in _Imaginary Numbers_, Artie does the same for Sarah after she's kidnapped by the cuckoo hive. The series as a whole has Rotating Protagonists.
-   _Hani and Ishu's Guide to Fake Dating_: The book's chapters alternate between Hani and Ishu's perspectives, shown from the first person in each case.
-   _The Shadowhunter Chronicles_ does this starting with the second book of _The Mortal Instruments_, _City of Ashes_. The POV don't always change with each chapter, though, and the series keeps its focus on Clary most of the time. The same applies in its spin-off books, where the POV will occasionally drift from the main protagonist to other characters.
-   _Until We Meet Again_: The story tends to switch between the P.O.V.s of Cassandra and Lawrence. At the beginning of each chapter is one of their names to indicate which one's narrating.
-   The main gimmick of _Voices in the Park_, which shows one day in the park told from four different persepctives: a posh woman, her sheltered son, a depressed man, and his feisty daughter.
-   The _Cormoran Strike Novels_ give nearly equal time to Cormoran Strike and his partner Robin Ellacott. _Career of Evil_ also includes a few chapters from the point-of-view of the serial killer who is the subject of their investigation. _The Ink Black Heart_, meanwhile, features several chapters in a Log Fic format depicting the online conversations of the moderators of _Drek's Game_, the MMORPG that is an important component of the book's events.
-   _Star Wars: Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising_ is narrated from the POV of whoever is near Thrawn at the time, and never Thrawn himself.
-   _Strangers on a Train_ alternates between Guy's and Bruno's perspectives (and occasionally others) — mostly on a scene-by-scene or chapter-by-chapter basis, but there are a couple of scenes where the two perspectives keep alternating, unsignposted, within the same scene. The effect is to emphasize the increasing closeness between the two characters and the resulting damage to Guy's sense of self.
-   This was the basic format of _The Bartimaeus Trilogy_, which, not counting the prequel novel, for the most part featured three perspectives, these being the djinni Bartimaeus, the magician Nathaniel / John Mandrake, and the resistance fighter Kitty Jones. Only Bartimaeus's was first-person and he was an Unreliable Narrator, which often made for humor when he would make some grandiose claim which would be put paid when the narration would switch to show more accurately what was _really_ happening.
-   _Of Fire and Stars_: The story is told alternately from the viewpoint of Dennaleia and Mare. Each chapter alternates between them. This gives insight to their perspectives, with different opinions and sometimes misunderstandings the pair have.
-   _Presidential_: The book shows things alternately from Emily and Connie's views.
-   _The Burning Kingdoms_: The books' chapters shift between the different characters' viewpoints, but Malini and Priya have the most.
-   _Mermaids of Eriana Kwai_: _Ice Massacre_ is only from Meela's perspective, but _Ice Crypt_ alternates between her and Lysi, and _Ice Kingdom_ adds another narrator, the Navy SEAL Ben Reeves.
-   _My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!_: has a flipping narritive, which alternates chapters between Katarina's perspective and whoever she happened to be focused on at the time. The manga drops all non-Katarina P.O.Vs, which leaves the other characters less developed than they would have been otherwise, while the anime has them as voiced recaps released online.
-   _How to Fly with Broken Wings_: Some chapters are narrated by Willem, and others by Sasha. Their chapters use different fonts.
-   _The Chronicles of Dorsa_: The books switch between Tasia's and Joslyn's viewpoints after the latter becomes a co-protagonist at first. In the third book, Megs, Linna and Akella join them as POV characters.
-   _Shatter the Sky_: In the first book, protagonist Maren is the only POV character. We start seeing things from Sev's perspective in the second book though, with chapters alternating from her to him.
-   _The Change Room_: The narrative is mostly shown from protagonist Eliza's point of view, but occasionally it's also shown from Andrew or Shar's perspectives.
-   _Both Can Be True_: Ash and Daniel narrate alternate chapters.
-   In _Lily and Dunkin_, both titular protagonists narrate in the first person.
-   _Are You Seeing Me?_: Justine and her brother Perry each narrate several chapters at a time.
-   _Something to Talk About_: The book switches between Jo and Emma's perspectives.
-   _Sweet & Bitter Magic_: The chapters alternately show things from Tamsin and Wren's perspectives.
-   _Tales of Inthya_:
    -   _The Queen of Ieflaria_: Each chapter shows things from either Esofi or Adale's perspective.
    -   _Daughter of the Sun_: The book shows things alternately from Aelia and Orsina's views, though Orsina has more POV segments.
-   _The Mermaid of Black Conch_ switches between an omniscient narrator, Aycayia's narration in free verse, and David's journal entries.
-   _Rubbernecker_: Sam's chapters are in the first person and present tense. Other chapters are in the third person limited and past tense and follow a number of characters, mainly Patrick.
-   _The Vazula Chronicles_: In the first book, Merletta narrates odd-numbered chapters and Heath narrates even-numbered chapters, both in the third person limited. In later books, they both narrate several chapters at once. Rekavidur also becomes a narrator in _A Kingdom Restored_, although he only narrates a handful of chapters.
-   _The Afterward_: The chapters alternate, showing Olsa and Kalanthe's perspectives.
-   In _Dolphin Song_, the main viewpoint characters are the human Melody and the dolphin Shara, but other narrators include Shara's son Speckle and various people in Melody's life. Chapters narrated by dolphins are in italics. All narration is in the third person limited.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _The Affair_: The second season gradually moves away from "Rashomon"-Style to show differents parts of the events with rotating POV characters but without overlap or contradictory accounts.
-   Over a longer period, _Babylon 5_ would do this, with various episodes or story arcs being done primarily from a particular character's point of view, oftentimes nowhere near the titular space station.
-   _Boomtown (2002)_ existed for this trope - we would see a crime happen from the perspectives of a number of different people ranging from police officers to victims, suspects and bystanders.
-   _CSI_: "Rashomama" presents the investigation of the death of the mother of a groom from the point of view of four different investigators in turn: Sarah, Nick, Gil and Greg.
-   The Season 8 premiere of _ER_ was presented as being in "Rashomon"-Style, but was more like this—of the four characters featured, if one of them saw something from one angle, another saw it from another.
-   In the TV series _The Event_, flashbacks are told from various POVs.
-   _Interview with the Vampire (2022)_: In "...The Ruthless Pursuit of Blood with All a Child's Demanding", the Flashback scenes are from Claudia's perspective instead of Louis de Pointe du Lac's because Daniel Molloy reads passages from her diary. For the rest of Season 1, Daniel gets a combination of Louis and Claudia's viewpoints.
-   The _My Name Is Earl_ DVD Bonus Content episode "Bad Karma" (allegedly the first Pilot for the series) starts from Earl's POV, but after Earl dies, it becomes _My name is Randy_.
    -   In one episode of the series proper, there's a sequence telling what happened to some stolen silverware, from the POV of Randy, Joy, Crab Man, and the librarian, each of whom get a "My name is X" line.

    Music 

-   _Hospice_ by The Antlers switches between the perspectives of the hospice worker and the cancer patient, most notably in the song "Thirteen".
-   Disturbed:
    -   Most of "Voices" is narrated by the internal voice driving a person to commit violent acts, and during the bridge, the sane part emerges trying to fight it.
    -   "Prayer." The verses are narrated by Evil God talking to humans about how he enjoys making them suffer for no good reason. In the chorus and the bridge, in response, human dares God to try and break him.
-   Evanescence's "Snow White Queen" is an Obsession Song that switches between the stalker's and the stalkee's point of view.
-   Confusingly, the traditional ballad _Reynardine_ shifts perspective from verse to verse between the title character, a bandit and possible member of The Fair Folk, and an omniscient third-person narrator.
-   _Ice Nine Kills_: "Tess-Timony" is narrated partly by Tess herself, and partly by Angel (or perhaps an omniscient third-person narrator).
-   In the "teenage love triangle" trilogy on Taylor Swift's _Folklore_, every character gets their turn in telling the story: "cardigan" is narrated by Betty, "betty" is James groveling to her, and "august" is James' unnamed mistress reminiscing about their past romance.

    Radio 

-   _X Minus One_: In episode thirty-seven, an adaptation of Isaac Asimov's "C-Chute", this is Averted by simplifying the story into making Stuart the only Character Narrator.

    Roleplay 

-   In _There is no GATE; we did not fight there_, multiple story posts and interludes often make use of the points of view of supporting characters. That isn't to say that Kytheus, the protagonist, doesn't get a lot of screentime, though.
-   This is one of _NoPixel_'s draws. It's possible to watch one character's POV through a livestream or VOD via Twitch or Facebook Gaming, then switch to another character's POV of the same event.

    Video Games 

-   _American Arcadia_ uses this as part of its gameplay when having the player switch between play styles. Trevor's sections all play from a 2½D perspective and his sections tend to have platformer elements. Angela's sections are all in First Person, regardless if she's looking through security cameras or moving around an area, and will have more puzzle elements. There are a few points where the player has to control both characters at the same time, which are usually done from Angela's perspective.
-   The _Call of Duty_ series is big on this trope, with most of the series' campaigns leaping back and forth between two or more (allied) groups. The groups do tend to be involved in separate theaters of war, however.
    -   _Call of Duty: Black Ops_ features Switching POV in order to brief Mason on what happened in his absence. In addition to the switching between Mason and Hudson, there's a flashback mission from Reznov's POV. "Rebirth" is the series' most prominent application of the trope, as we get to see just _how_ different the same event looked from the two main characters' perspectives.
    -   _Call of Duty: Black Ops II_ does much the same Switching POV trickery, this time between father and son - the former in the 1980s witnessing the start of it all, the latter in 2025 resolving the conflict. In addition, there are parts of two levels where Menendez is playable, as well as a mission from Woods' perspective. \*\* The _Modern Warfare_ series is also an example. The first game alternates between the SAS and Force Recon characters until their union in the endgame. Modern Warfare 2 switches between a squad of Rangers defending the US and Task Force 141 after the person in charge of the attacks. 3, aside from a few one-off characters for certain missions, mainly focuses on the remains of Task Force 141 and a team of Delta Force operators in turn.
-   The FPS _DUSK-12_ have you in control of two characters, the Super-Soldier Gorin and Special Forces Operative Lieutenant Andrey. As the former you kick ass exclusively using your bare hands, can trigger your Super-Speed to move in Bullet Time and One-Hit Kill enemies, and have telekinetic abilities allowing you to Psychic Strangle foes for good measure, while as the latter you just shoot enemies like every other FPS ever made.
-   The _Fear Effect_ duology revolves around a mercenary team, and the game would constantly switch around characters, with the first game having players assume the roles of Hana, Glas, and Deke (the latter, an Awesome Aussie being the strongest of the trio, but also having the least amount of sections dedicated towards, since he's not introduced until the second disc and dies at the end of the third). The second game (a Stealth Prequel) throws in Hana's former partner, Rain, with the first disc having only these two ladies as playable characters and only introducing Glas and Deke in the second disc.
-   Another FPS, _Jonathan Kane: The Protector_, allows player control of the titular hero, Jonathan, and his protectee, Jennifer. The game tends to randomly shift POV between the two, where if Jonathan is in play he gets to shoot terrorists left and right like every other FPS in existence, but if the player is in control of Jennifer then most of her stages are Stealth Based Missions instead.
-   _Ninja Combat_ have the players alternating between the available ninja characters at the end of each level. They start off as the heroes Joe and Hayabusa, but can later recruit allies on their side; some of those allies even starts off as bosses (like Princess Kagerou, who attacks the player at the end of one level but her fight turns out to be a Secret Test Of Character) before they're Promoted to Playable after their defeat.
-   _Space Debris_ starts off with the player in control of USAF pilot, Lieutenant James Bryant, in the first three missions, before introducing more partners for James, notably fellow USAF maverick Rip "Starfire" and the freelance mercenary Halo, where the game will give out levels alternating between the trio.
-   _Wild C.A.T.s (1995)_, the NES adaptation of the cartoon, have players alternating between the three heroes, Spartan, Maul and Warblade, each of them taking up a segment of a stage before being switched over. The final stage however _does_ allow the player to choose one of the trio to play as, right up to the Final Boss.

    Visual Novels 

-   Narration (or rather, Blick Winkel's point of view) switches between Takeshi and the Kid in _Ever17_'s prologue, before settling on one of them for the rest of the game. It starts switching again in Coco's route, and in Coco's epilogue it "visits" every character before changing to Blick Winkel's own narration.
-   In _Swan Song_, the main characters take turns providing first-person narration. It's used to both provide different perspectives and focus on different cast constellations.
-   Most of the beta version of _Katawa Shoujo_ takes place from Hisao's POV. At the very end of Act 3 in Shizune's arc it switches to Misha's POV. It ends with Misha getting hit by a car.
-   _Noble Works_ does this rather frequently, though the majority of the story is still told through Takumi's eyes.
-   _Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony_:
    -   Halfway through the first trial, when it becomes obvious that Kaede Akamatsu - the current POV character and protagonist - is the culprit, the player switches POV to Shuichi Saihara. The Class Trial UI changes from purple to blue to represent the switch.
    -   During the final trial, the POV is switched to Keebo, Himiko, and Maki for brief segments. They get white, neon blue and red UI, respectively.
-   Most games in the _Ace Attorney_ series do this at some point, with the only exceptions being _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney_ and _Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth_.
    -   _Justice for All_: Most of the game is shown from Phoenix Wright's perspective, but the POV switches to Maya Fey a few times in case 4 to show what she does while she is kidnapped.
    -   _Trials and Tribulations_: The POV switches between three characters: Phoenix Wright in cases 2, 3, and most of 5, Mia Fey in cases 1 and 4, and Miles Edgeworth in part of case 5.
    -   _Apollo Justice_: Most of the game is shown from Apollo Justice's perspective, but the POV switches to Phoenix Wright for a portion of case 4 to show how he lost his badge, and to a member of the jury at the very end to decide the case.
    -   _Ace Attorney Investigations 2_: Most of the game is shown from Miles Edgeworth's perspective, but the POV switches to Gregory Edgeworth for about half of case 3 to show the case that led to his confrontation with Manfred von Karma.
    -   _Dual Destinies_: The POV switches between three characters: Phoenix Wright in most of cases 1 and 4, all of case 5, and the DLC case, Apollo Justice in case 2 and part of case 4, and Athena Cykes in part of case 1 and all of case 3.
    -   _Spirit of Justice_: The POV switches between three characters: Phoenix Wright in cases 1, 3, part of 5, and the DLC case, Apollo Justice in case 2 and most of case 5, and Athena Cykes in case 4.
-   _Fate/stay night_ told entirely in first person, primarily has Shirou's POV, but has various interludes that are from another character's POV, for events Shirou is not present for or to provide character back-stories. Fate route only has interludes from Saber's POV, while the other two routes have more interludes from the other characters.
-   _Heart of the Woods_ starts with the player assuming the perspective of Madison "Maddie" Raines, the manager for her best friend Tara's Vlog Series _Taranormal_, as she accompanies Tara on a trip to investigate supernatural phenomena in the town of Eysenfeld. Throughout the game, the player switches between Madison, Tara, Morgan(the young woman who invited them to Eysenfeld) and Abigail (a ghost Madison meets).
-   _Highway Blossoms_: The plot of the main game is entirely from Amber's POV, but in _Next Exit_, Marina also gets POV segments, and there are a few times you can choose whether to see events from Amber or Marina's POV. "The Trio," a group of secondary characters, get some POV segments, but theirs have a third-person narrator.
-   In _Kindred Spirits on the Roof_, while Yuna is the main character, the story alternates perspectives between most of the named characters, although Hina Komano and Fujii Ano don't get POV scenes until after the story, likely to avoid spoiling Hina's feelings for Yuna and Ano's ability to see the kindred spirits. On the calendar, scenes are marked with a chibified portrait of the character whose POV it's from, and when the POV switches, there's a brief eyecatcher. One post-game scene, "Charm," is unique in that it has a third-person narrator and shows the thoughts of multiple characters.

    Webcomics 

-   _Gunnerkrigg Court_ is predominately shown from Antimony's perspective, but for one particularly Mind Screwy chapter, it switched to Zimmy's perspective without any warning—just as Zimmy was in the middle of a bout of Identity Amnesia. In other words, Zimmy thought she was someone else, so the comic portrayed her as that other person.
-   In _Sluggy Freelance_, POV switches frequently between characters and Cast Herds, sometimes between dimensions.
-   _Problem Sleuth_ keeps switching between the viewpoints of the three protagonists (and a few minor characters).
-   _Homestuck_ has tons of characters and pretty much all of them become the point of view at some point. Though the reader doesn't get to "be" everyone longer than a few pages - but still a significant portion of them.
-   _NEXT!!! Sound of the Future_: While most of the story is told from Shine's perspective, there are sometimes glimpses into other characters' points of view.
    -   At the end of chapter 4, there is a brief scene showing Tech after she had returned home thinking about a conversation she had with Shine.
    -   In chapter 5, there are some insights into Gumiya's thoughts both during his flashback to his first meeting with Shine and again at the end of the chapter. This is mostly used as a way to show to the audience that he has a crush on her, since Shine is unaware.

    Web Original 

-   _Anathema_ follows the stories of Mascot, Dancer, and Radiant. The narration stays with one of the protagonists for a while (between 5 and eight chapters at a time), until it switches to another. Additionally, some of the interlude chapters are told from the point of view of other characters.
-   And We Slipped Away, which is written from the point of view of a man and his murderer during the few seconds before he dies. The two inner monologues run together mid-sentence to form a continuous narrative.
-   The titular character in _Dragomir's Diary_ usually serves as the narrator, since it's, y'know, _his diary_. But he'll periodically be incapacitated or kidnapped or otherwise distracted from his writing, and someone else will have to take up the quill for a while. Past narrators have included Dragomir's wife, Dragomir's brother, the prince of Dragomir's home, the queen, a rat, a tarantula, and the _diary itself_.
-   _Oktober_: each chapter is presented through each of the 4 characters' journals in turn.
-   At the end of series 2 of _Phaeton_ we switch perspectives to Teliha's, Word of God states we will see this happening more in series 3.
-   In _Unlikely Eden_, the two protagonists take turns at narration.
-   While _Worm_'s main story is told from Taylor's first-person point of view, the interlude chapters/arcs and the epilogue are told from different characters' perspectives in third-person, giving backstory or filling in parts of the main story that Taylor wasn't present for.
-   Season 3 of _The Penumbra Podcast_'s _Juno Steel_ storyline switches point of view to a different member of the Carte Blanche each episode (as opposed to the first two seasons, which were presented entirely from Juno's perspective).
-   _Galactiquest_ follows the crew of the _Celestion-5._ While some stories stick with one member's point of view, most switch between multiple chaacters.
-   _MoniRobo_: Some stories tells the story from one person's POV and then switch the perspective to another person who is involved in the same story.

    Web Videos 

-   _Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog_ focuses on Dr. Horrible/Billy, but "My Eyes" switches between Dr. Horrible narrating how he can't believe how horrible everything is turning, and Penny narrating how everything can get better.
-   Unlike the main series, _TekkitLive_ videos often have the perspective of multiple allied players edited together, swapping between them as needed. For example, Schlatt's videos also feature segments from Connor's streams, and Fitz's videos also feature segments from Kryoz's.

    Western Animation 

-   _Big City Greens_: Most of the episode "Reckoning Ball" is from the perspective of the Big Bad Chip Whistler; however, during the living room scene, it briefly shifts to the Greens' perspective. This was probably done storywise to shield the audience from Chip's plan to use the Greens' kindness and trick them into thinking he changed his ways so he can take over Wholesome Foods, which he reveals in the last scene once his dad is out of the picture.
