They don't call him "Old Stoneface" for nothing.

_"Staying all serious and scowling every minute of the day is impossible! How can anyone look so mad all the time?!"_

A character whose default or most frequent appearance/model is him/her with a serious upside-down smile, even in the most pleasant of situations. Though it can be compared to The Stoic, Perpetual Frowner differs in the simple fact that rather than wearing a face of indifference, the character perpetually expresses the biggest, ugliest frown he or she can make on their face.

Usually comes in three varieties: mopey and listless, angry and angsty, or focused and serious. In many cases, the look of extreme tension continues even when they're asleep. For series where character background and development is allotted, it may later be revealed that the person expresses the demeanor as a result of living or having lived a harsh or tragic life.

Extra points if the character also displays a habit of keeping his arms crossed along with the constant frowning for that extra pouty look.

If the Perpetual Frowner actually _does_ smile, it either signifies that the character has found a reason to be happy and enjoy life again, or it is one of the most potent sources of Nightmare Fuel you will ever come across. The smile may also be forced upon another by someone.

If the expression is not voluntary but the result of damage to nerves or the like, it falls under Frozen Face.

Compare the Aloof Big Brother, the Deadpan Snarker, The Comically Serious, and The Eeyore. Contrast Perpetual Smiler. See also the Death Glare and the Clint Squint.

    Asian Animation 

-   Sarcastic, deadpan Choco from _Bread Barbershop_ rarely ever smiles, to the point that there's an episode ("Choco Smile") based around Bread holding a contest to see who can make her smile after an inspector determines that her frown ruins the workplace joy, which disqualifies Bread Barbershop from receiving government subsidies.
-   _Happy Heroes_: It's not especially often that Careful S. smiles, particularly in the earlier seasons, and when he attempts to smile on command, it looks quite terrifying.
-   Victor from _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf: Dunk for Victories_ has a serious personality and doesn't smile for most of the season, until episode 57.

    Comic Books 

-   Trellis from _Amulet_. He's only ever been seen smiling once - whilst playing a game of Othello in _Escape From Lucien_.

-   Modern depictions of _Batman_, or at least anything after Frank Miller, portray him with a near-constant scowl, complimenting his overall serious demeanor. Whenever he _is_ seen smiling, it's usually more of a smirk. Though it's worth noting that this was how Batman was portrayed originally, being a much darker, gothic figure in his early Golden Age comics, then becoming more lighthearted and cheery (so as not to frighten younger readers) during the Silver Age, only to slowly transition back into the dark, serious, noir-tinged character he was to begin with, starting from the 70s onward.
-   True to his name, _Blacksad_ is always shown with a frown on his face. Which is pretty justifiable, considering all the terrible stuff he has witnessed during his lifetime. He does smile in some rare occasions, such as non-canon artwork made by the official artist of the comic.
-   _Cerebus the Aardvark_: The titular character's standard expression rarely varies from a frown or scowl.
-   _Extinctioners_: Although he shows a variety of other emotions, this expression seems to be Walice Weazels main mood throughout the series (due to him usually irritated by something if he\`s not just feeling bitter).
-   _The Flash_: Zoom is in a constant state of Unstoppable Rage, and his mouth is nearly always twisted into a tooth-baring grimace.
-   Happy Hogan of _Iron Man_ started out like this, simply because _that was how he always looked_. At one point, he informed the reader that he WAS smiling. He got better before The '60s were through.
-   In _Judge Dredd_, the titular character has two facial expressions: "Frowning Angrily" (pictured above) and "Shouting". Made all the stronger because he famously never removes his helmet where the viewer can see it, so a scowling mouth really is his main facial expression.
    -   There was one time when he returned to Mega City 1 from Luna-1 and hadn't been reinstated as a judge yet. He spent a couple of minutes walking around, waving at anyone, and ignoring crimes because he was technically a civilian.
    -   One prog has the extremely tasty and addictive Umpty Candy sweeping the city. The cover shows Dredd with a giant grin while eating.<small>◊</small> It's as disturbing as it sounds.
-   Any comic character drawn by Rob Liefeld will usually have this as a default expression. Slightly angrier characters will have it with teeth exposed. Still angrier characters will have an open, shouting mouth with the upper half of their face pinched into a painful looking grimace.
-   _New Gods_: Darkseid has this expression 24/7, and for billions of years, being quite literally stone faced. When he's not scowling, it's either a Psychotic Smirk or Slasher Smile — there's no in-between.
-   The Saint of Killers from _Preacher_, alive or undead. One character describes his permanent facial expression as someone who's "treadin' through dogshit".
    -   He smiles in a flashback when he holds his newborn daughter. This old, hated Civil War veteran not only has a loving wife but now a beautiful daughter.
-   About the only time The Punisher _doesn't_ wear this expression is in flashbacks with his family. To quote the 2005 _Punisher_ videogame:
    
    (After blasting Bushwacker through a wall) "I don't smile much. Don't smile ever. But if I did, this would be one."
    
-   _Sensation Comics_: Dr. Stanton glowers at everyone constantly when separated from Mona Blue, and when he's together with her he still doesn't seem to know how to smile, though he doesn't glower at her and can sort of stop glowering at patients when she's around.
-   Almost everyone in _Sin City_. If they smile, you should expect it to be a Slasher Smile.
-   _Superman_:
    -   In _Superman: At Earth's End_, Superman's face is locked in a near-permanent scowl.
    -   Batman spends the whole of _The Supergirl from Krypton (2004)_ scowling and frowning. Given that Superman is gushing all over a strange, superpowerful girl who has appeared out of nowhere claiming to be his conveniently amnesic cousin only to be kidnapped by Darkseid shortly after, all of which sounds like a transparent set-up to him, he has little reason to crack a smile.
    -   _Red Daughter of Krypton_: Supergirl spends most of her stint as a Red Lantern displaying angry, sad or moody expressions.
-   Thanos, when he isn't grinning insanely, usually has an angry scowl on his face. Though on rare occasions he's had an easy going smile on his face such as when he's won favour with "his lady", bonding with Gamora when she was little or when he's farming.
-   _Transformers: More than Meets the Eye:_
    -   Ultra Magnus, stern lawman to a fault, is never seen smiling (except twice, the first he regretted ever since, and the second was to save everyone's life). It's been so long since he smiled that the parts of his face responsible for changing his expression have rusted in place.
    -   Ratchet, on account of being increasingly old and grumpy. Just for contrast, a flashback actually shows him smiling, towards _Drift_, of all people.
    -   Helex, of the Decepticon Justice Division, is almost never seen smiling. Usually, he's this or his face is obscured. So much of a perpetual frowner, he doesn't even smile while on the job, except for one time.
-   The main hero of WILQ – Superbohater, which perfectly matches his bad attitude. In rare instances when he actually changes his face expression, it's usually one of shock and disbelief. Or a Psychotic Smirk, when he's about to hurt someone.
-   _X-Men_:
    -   Wolverine typically has a scowl on his face fitting his Anti-Hero nature and other times he has an iconic Slasher Smile and smirk. Averted when Logan is around his friends and very capable of smiles and chuckles when in a good mood.
    -   Logan's Opposite-Sex Clone X23 smiles even less than him, mainly due to her Dark and Troubled Past toughening her up and giving her intimacy issues. Averted with later comics where Laura can be seen with the occasional smile on her face, the X-Men have rubbed off on her.
    -   Cable **hardly ever** smiles and usually doesn't have much reason to. One of the few times Cable has averted this, is when he's around his daughter Hope.
    -   Apocalypse's facial structure means he does this naturally, in fact the few times he does smile he looks creepy.

    Fairy Tales 

-   In The Brothers Grimm's "The Golden Goose", a local princess is unable to smile, and her father the King decreed that, if a man could make the very serious and unemotional Princess laugh, she'd marry him. She begins laughing when she sees The Hero carrying around the titular Golden Goose... plus a bunch of people that were stuck to him because of the Goose's curse.

    Fan Works 

-   A background character from _Mall Rats_, a fanfiction of _The Loud House_, has a "perma-sneer".
-   _The Night Unfurls_:
    -   Downplayed for Sanakan. Her default expression is a scowl, but sometimes grins if she feels like it.
    -   Subverted for Kyril. He's a Consummate Professional who leans towards The Stoic with the emotionless visage, giving the impression of seriousness or mild annoyance all the time, but he does give a thin smile underneath his bandanna more than once.
-   In _Shinobi The RPG_ we have Shimoda Daisuke, who—thanks to his one Charisma—has the emotional range of a statue, the effect of which actively frightens his peers. He's constantly mentioned as frowning.
-   Overlapping with The Quiet One, the ten year old Elesis/Ellie from _Tokimeki PokéLive! and TwinBee_ has one of these of the focused and serious variety on her face when she enters her rarely seen secondary "serious mode" personality. Subverted in that she's usually the smiling, cheerful and talkative type character otherwise.
-   Flowey from _Underfell_ is rarely seen without a frown on his face. This being a classic Mirror Universe, it's in direct contrast to his canon self from _Undertale_ who is a Perpetual Smiler.
-   Ellen Harrison in _Zero Context: Taking Out the Trash_. Regardless of the situation, be it joining a sibling dogpile on a beloved godparent or curbstomping twenty-six trained fighters at once, she never once smiles.

    Film - Animated 

-   _Batman: Mask of the Phantasm_: Chuckie Sol. In the book, it's explained that he deliberately cultivates that image because he believes it'll be taken as a sign of weakness if he ever lets anyone see him smile. The one time he ever smiles in the story is explained in the book by his belief that Phantasm, who's the only character seeing him do it, won't live long enough to tell anybody.
-   _The Book of Life_:
    -   Manolo's grandmother hardly cracks a smile.
    -   The only time Chakal smiled is when he tries to blow himself up to take the town with him.
-   _A Bug's Life_'s main villain Hopper has only been seen smiling a small handful of times throughout the whole movie.
-   Tim Burton's _Corpse Bride_: Nearly all the living people.
-   Reggie from _Free Birds_ due to his depressing personality, being a complete doormat and letting the president's daughter abuse him.
-   Roz from _Monsters, Inc._ is one of the most extreme examples ever, with her signature dull, sour frown being her sole facial expression throughout the entire film. However, she shows during the film's Hilarious Outtakes that she's still able to joke around and have a laugh with the others.
-   _Pocahontas_: Kocoum rarely grins at all — so much so that when Nakoma expresses attraction towards him, Pocahontas sarcastically remarks his best feature is his smile. He doesn't even grin at Pocahontas—_whom he intended to marry._
-   _Ratatouille_:
    -   Django has his reasons, though he does finally seem happier by the movie's end.
    -   Ego spends close to all of the movie frowning, befitting his status as an unpleasable food critic.
-   Miss Sanchez from _Shark Tale_, mainly because she's annoyed by any stupid thing Oscar did to ruin her life.
-   Disney's _Tarzan_: The exceptionally serious alpha gorilla Kerchak almost never smiles in the film (except for a few scenes such as when he bonds with his biological son at the beginning) or in any other Disney media, often presenting an indifferent or angry look on his face.
-   Chuckles the Clown of _Toy Story 3_ is always seen with a frown on his face, as a result of going through exactly what Lotso and Big Baby went through and seeing them corrupted by their experiences. He does crack a smile at the end though.
-   In _Turning Red_, while she doesn't _act_ glum, Priya's facial expression always bears heavy-lidded eyes and a mild frown, projecting a powerful "cool girl" image.

    Film - Live-Action 

-   One of the biggest criticisms of Superman's portrayal in _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_ is that Clark doesn’t wipe his gloomy frown off his face except when he's with Lois or his mother Martha. Yes it's part of Zack Snyder Darker and Grittier aesthetic but seeing the All-Loving Hero Superman have a grim look on his face while saving people was too much for fans. _Justice League (2017)_ corrects this as Supes readily smiles and chuckles just like in the comics.
-   _The Bourne Series_ Jason Bourne is like this, due to constantly being on the run and on his guard. The only time he smiles in the original film is at the very end, when he reunites with Marie. In the sequels, Marie is killed in the first action sequence and he never smiles again.
-   _The Chronicles of Narnia_: Edmund Pevensie seems to do this a lot, even after his Heel–Face Turn.
-   _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_: Karkaroff's caricature-esque grimacing.
-   _How To Blow Up A Pipeline_: Michael never once smiles in the film. He usually frowns, grimaces or otherwise appears dour.
-   _James Bond_:
    -   Oddjob in _Goldfinger_ has constant frown, when he does smile it means 007 is in for a beatdown.
    -   Le Chiffre in a good chunk of his appearances in _Casino Royale (2006)_. Daniel Craig’s Bond himself actually averts this, smiling multiple times throughout the film but after Vesper’s death however he almost _never smiles_ again in the following movies even _when_ he smiles it seems like he's scowling. The only time we see him truly smile again is when he’s with Madeline and his daughter Mathilde.
-   Bagheera from _The Jungle Book (2016)_ doesn't smile a lot, even in lighthearted moments. But the only time he smiles in the movie is when Mowgli hugs him after they had been separated.
-   _Marvel Cinematic Universe_:
    -   Strangely enough Captain America tends to have a frown as his default expression. True his stoicism is somewhat justified given he was bullied frequently as a kid, has been through many wars and has almost everyone he knew from the forties die, but it is a contrast to his idealistic nature.
        -   It's even noted out of universe as Cap's actor Chris Evans is a huge goofball on set, yet when the director calls action his costars notice that he immediately stops smiling and becomes deadly serious.
    -   Nick Fury has this expression 24/7 in later movies, considering the violence, conspiracies, betrayals and corruption he’s seen it’s to be expected. Though it's strange since Fury frequently smiled and laughed in _Iron Man 2_ though this was before his characterization came in.
    -   The Hulk's default expression just like comics is an angry scowl and only smiles once when Cap gives him the “Smash” command. Averted in _Thor: Ragnarok_ as Hulk smiles and laughs like a big overgrown toddler, also Professor Hulk is rarely seen frowning.
    -   Bucky much like Cap rarely feels any indication to curl his lips up and would rather bury his emotion in brooding stoicism. It's a strong contrast to when Bucky was introduced where he had an easy going smile on his face though Coldblooded Torture and being Brainwashed and Crazy for years probably does that to you. Averted in _The Falcon and the Winter Soldier_ where Bucky has managed to somewhat go back to how he was before Hydra captured him, even if he still glares and scowls a fair bit.
    -   Initially played straight with Drax and Gamora who had near permanent frowns on their faces just like the comics, but thanks to Star-Lord they both brighten up immensely. Drax in particular despite his Dark and Troubled Past is capable of fits of laughter.
    -   Thanos is a mixed bag as just like like comic he's capable of a Psychotic Smirk and Slasher Smile, but most other times he has somber frown on his face or a scowl. At the end of _Avengers: Infinity War_ he has peaceful smile after killing half the universe.
    -   Captain Marvel almost never smiles and has near permanent stoic frown on her face. It's even noted In-Universe as a sleazy biker asks Carol to give him a smile and gives him a scowl in return. It’s semi-justified given her part with her difficult childhood and a hard time at the airforce so Carol is probably acting aloof as a defense.
    -   Nebula is the queen of this trope as unlike the previous listed she has distinction of never smiling once, at the most she'll soften her scowl. She finally smiles albeit briefly in _Avengers: Endgame_ while playing games with Tony.
-   MonsterVerse:
    -   _Kong: Skull Island_: The Iwi of Skull Island are constantly stone-faced, and Hank Marlow jokingly quips that they "never smile". Seemingly subverted, as Jia and especially Ato smile aplenty in the Iwi's later MonsterVerse appearances.
    -   _Godzilla: King of the Monsters_: Each of King Ghidorah's three heads have distinct personalities — the head on Ghidorah's right, known as Ni, has a signature grimace, which makes his lips form a crooked shape, in place of the slasher smiles that the other two heads make.
-   _Star Trek (2009)_: Karl Urban's Doctor McCoy took until the third movie to crack a smile. Compared to him, Spock looks downright cheerful.
-   Mace Windu from the _Star Wars_ prequels looks like he never learned how to smile, even before the Clone Wars began. According to the novel _Shatterpoint_, it's been years since anyone's seen him smile; he makes one half-hearted attempt early on, but quickly gives up.

    Literature 

-   _Animorphs_: Tobias' default form is a red-tailed hawk, so when in human morph he tends to not show much expression and look at people with raptorial intensity.
-   Skeeter Traps from _Chronicles Of Magic_ is a ten-year-old version of this.
-   _The Death Gate Cycle_: The fact that Haplo tends to maintain a grim expression even while sleeping is remarked upon by other characters. He does smile occasionally, however.
-   Greg Heffley from _Diary of a Wimpy Kid_ is usually shown frowning.
-   _Discworld_ has Commander Sir Samuel 'Sam' Vimes, a.k.a. 'Old Stoneface'. He does smile, occasionally, usually when his son is involved, but a glare, a snarl, or even a roar of rage is much more likely.
-   _The Dresden Files_:
    -   "I snarled", "I glared", "I scowled"... Harry Dresden is very much this. This is notable, given the fact that he spends most of his time cracking bad jokes—though part of it might be to do with the fact that he puts great store by intimidating the monsters he deals with on a regular basis from the off, so they're less inclined to try and have a go.
    -   Morgan is practically carved out of granite. He smiles maybe once in all of the books.
-   The titular character in the _Eisenhorn_ trilogy, though not by choice. You see, early in the first book, he gets tortured so horribly (an this is set in _Warhammer 40,000_, so feel free to imagine just how) that the muscles in his face are irreparably damaged. He _can't_ smile anymore, even if he wanted to.
-   _Fate/Zero_: Kirei Kotomine smiles very rarely and usually has an emotionless expression on his face. Considering it's a prequel to _Fate/stay night_, people who started with _stay night_ first, learn how he went from a Perpetual Frowner to a Perpetual Smiler. And indeed, every time Kotomine smiles in _Fate/Zero_, it's always a wicked smile.
-   Sagara Sousuke from _Full Metal Panic!_. He is described numerous times to be a very attractive boy... except for the problem that he looks perpetually angry, with his eyebrows slanting down and lips pressed firmly in a grim straight line, giving him a _very_ unapproachable appearance. He's actually pretty well known for never smiling in the story. Here's his attempt at trying to, for the sake of his photo ID.<small>◊</small> Though more unnervingly, one of the few times he's shown to smile naturally can be seen here. Yikes, Sousuke, you Sociopathic Hero, you.
-   _Harry Potter_:
    -   Kreacher the house elf makes emo kids look optimistic and happy from his introduction in the fifth book until the seventh when he finally sees the light and starts to become cheerful.
    -   When he's not smirking, Snape spends his time either scowling, frowning or sneering.
-   _Holmes on the Range_: Old Red is a reserved, often sour person after the deaths of his fiancée, parents and all but one of his siblings in various parts of The Backstory.
-   Aur from _How to Build a Dungeon: Book of the Demon King_ has this as his default look, properly portraying the kind of man he is; although he sometimes makes gentle expressions towards those he has recruited, mostly women, even flat out manipulating his facial structure with magic to give those who meets him for the first time a false impression that he is a benevolent man.
-   In _The Hunger Games_, Gale says that Katniss only smiles when in the woods. During the Games, Peeta tells her that she doesn't scowl as much when she's asleep. Katniss herself admits that her smiles are hard to come by.
-   In _I Funny_, Jamie Grimm's foster family, ironically nicknamed the Smileys by Grimm, are shown frowning mostly.
-   _Johannes Cabal_: The titular Necromancer is a dour people-hater who's driven only by his supernatural research to resurrect his Lost Lenore. His normal modes of social engagement are stoicism and misanthropic rage; his muscles creak from disuse when he forces a smile; and when he has a giggling fit, people around him are stunned with dismay.
-   Gwendal in _Kyo Kara Maoh!_ is an extreme example, even other characters comment on his perpetual frowning.
-   _Monster of the Month Club_: Icicle, the January Selection, who's pretty grouchy most of the time. Whenever he's interacting with Rilla, he almost always has a scowl on his face, though he tends to lighten up when he's caught up in a good book (only to switch back to looking grumpy if he's interrupted) or relaxing in the bathtub. He also tries to smile when he first sees Sweetie Pie and develops an instant crush on her, but this doesn't last long.
-   Tahniya in _The Path to War_ is actually described as having a permanent small frown, which always makes her look like something has irritated or troubled her.
-   In _Please Don't Tell My Parents I'm a Supervillain_, Generic Girl always sounds tired and unhappy, not fitting in with heroes, villains, or middle schoolers.
-   Lord Droon, the villain of Dr. Seuss's early picture book _The King's Stilts_, is described as a "scowler," mutters that "the lines at the corners of the mouth should go down," and loathes smiles, fun, and anything that seems unserious or undignified — so much that he endangers the entire kingdom by stealing the titular stilts, pushing the king toward the Despair Event Horizon.
-   Tywin Lannister from _A Song of Ice and Fire_ has never smiled since he lost his wife. Even before then, there had only been four recorded occasions of him smiling.
    -   Stannis Baratheon is similar to, if not even more so, to Tywin in this regard. It's said, more than once, that he "never learned how to smile." He is constantly scowling, and one of his character tics is, when particularly annoyed by something, he grinds his teeth. A character once said he was so mad about something that "he clenched his teeth so hard I thought they would shatter."
        -   However this ties into the theme that there is more to Stannis then first meets the eye. He smiles and laughs a few times, usually when his most trusted man Davos Seaworth is around.
    -   In the past, King Aegon III was this from seeing the horrific way his mother died. Never smiled, always wore black to mourn his mother.
-   _Star Wars: Kenobi_: Mullen Gault. According to his father Orrin, he was _born_ scowling.
-   Bukama from _The Wheel of Time_ prequel novel is one of these. "The older man brightened. Well, his scowl lessened a little. For him, that was as good as a grin from anyone else."
-   In _The Witchlands_:
    -   Stix always seems to be Clint Squinting at people menacingly, though it's later mentioned that she's actually only doing it because she's near-sighted.
    -   Vaness deliberately doesn't smile as part of her public persona as the (former) Child-Empress, though she's not much given to grinning in private either.
-   Heathcliff in _Wuthering Heights_ starts out like this, at any rate.

    Music 

-   Rivers Cuomo of Weezer is notorious for always looking somewhat dismayed. Which makes his obvious happiness in the music video for "Keep Fishin'" rather heartwarming. (Though, granted, it's hard to work with the Muppets and _not_ cheer up at least briefly.)
-   The Backstreet Boys liked cultivating this image of stoic seriousness in any opportunity they could, mainly on their posters/CD covers as well as going for mainly stoic balladry on their music. In fact, the one way you could tell the difference between them and \*NSYNC was that \*NSYNC adopted the Fun Personified image and smiled while the Backstreet Boys didn't.
-   Kim Wilde ...but that was just part of her image - she didn't want to come over as Dumb Blonde.
-   Terry Hall was well-known for this in The Specials and The Fun Boy Three. The title of his solo album _Laugh_ played on this reputation, and its cover photo of Hall actually laughing stands out as a notable Out-of-Character Moment.
-   "Upside Down Frown" by They Might Be Giants is about a person reassuring another person that he is, in fact, happy about the news they're bringing, despite his expression.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   Raven after he came to ECW, due to a deep depression.
-   Kaiju Big Battel's Big Bad, the evil Dr. Cube, is instantly recognizable because of his unchanging expression (it's actually a helmet, as Cube is _not_ a Kaiju)
-   Jim Ross became one after being afflicted by Bell's Palsy. This was initially mocked with a WCW gimmick known as "Oklahoma" and later by Short Stack when he was "repackaged" as Hornswoggle.
-   Sara Del Rey hasn't been one her entire career but has gone through several stretches of it, enough that a frowning face is a fixture of most of her ring gear. During her (three year+!)JAPW Championship run though, it was speculated she wasn't capable of smiling at the time because of two canker sores.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Warhammer 40,000_'s God-Emperor of Mankind is depicted with a frown and Death Glare in most of the official art, appropriately given some of the stuff he had to deal with. If he ever looks insecure, it's a good sign that something is seriously wrong.
-   _Sentinels of the Multiverse_: Neither Fanatic nor the Argent Adept ever smile in their card art.

    Theater 

-   In _Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol_ Marley is described as prune-faced and perpetually sour like he'd just bit into a lemon and didn't enjoy the taste.

    Visual Novels 

-   From the _Ace Attorney_ series:
    -   Miles Edgeworth sometimes smirks when he believes he has the upper hand in court, but that is as far as he will go to cracking a smile. His seriousness while acting as a prosecutor leads many people to notice how he doesn't seem to let loose. He doesn't even have a proper, genuine smiling sprite until the second game.
    -   Even if Barok van Zieks of _The Great Ace Attorney_ were not far too miserable and cynical to smile of his own volition, an assassination attempt has carved a literal furrow in his brow that gives him a permanent Death Glare even at his most relaxed.
        
        **Ryunosuke:** His face says 'I hate you,' but his words are... almost jovial today.
        
-   Peko Pekoyama from _Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair_ is not only this, but she expresses a desire to _stop_ coming across as so grumpy all the time in her free time events. This is because she wants to ask her crush on a date and wants to make a good impression.
-   While Saber's default expression in _Fate/stay night_ can be described as 'neutral with a dash of stiffness', Saber Alter's scowl practically _bores_ into your soul.
-   Natsuhi from _Umineko: When They Cry_ is a Rare Female Example.
    -   Kanon's a male, albeit effeminate one.

    Web Animation 

-   Flaky from Happy Tree Friends.
-   Mostly, some of the characters from Starshine Carly have these expressions, due to the design of the toys.

    Webcomics 

-   _Ctrl+Alt+Del_ — Scowl 3: The Scowling.
-   Tyler in _Damaged Tape_ hasn't smiled once in the entire run of the comic. He's only had two other expressions: yelling, and a typical Nut Shot reaction face.
-   _Earthsong_'s Gwen.
-   _Girl Genius_: Baron Klaus Wulfenbach looks perpetually unhappy. Then again, given how much he likes his job... A good adventuring fight seems to perk him up a little, though, if this page is anything to go by.
    -   Gil is at one point amazed that his father used to get all the ladies back when he was adventuring with the Heterodyne Boys. "**Klaus** Wulfenbach. His mouth does this all the time."
-   The Suit Guy of _Godslave_ may have several expressions, but they all boil down to "some kind of a frown".
    -   As things progress, it seems that suits and smiles are mutually exclusive. It's _probably_ not an actual function of the clothing, but the Blacksmiths at least are almost always equipped with a big frown, especially when Edith starts handing them their matte metal butts on a regular basis.
-   _Homestuck_:
    -   Karkat is the angriest troll. He is just so angry, you don't even know.
    -   Karkat smiled once. Eridan smiled never.
    -   The Felt, with the possible exception of Clover who doesn't have a mouth but certainly comes off as the Perpetual Smiler type.
    -   Every Agent except for CD is this.
    -   Aradia is an odd example; she certainly starts out as one, only being shown smiling twice (and one of those was in a flashback), but after going God Tier she inverts the trope completely.
-   The fisher from _Legend of Legendary Mighty Knight_ appears to constantly be annoyed, even when the forest folk start holding a celebration in their honor for inadvertently killing the leader of a gang of brigands.
