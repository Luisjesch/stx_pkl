The last scene of the movie is coming to a close. For some reason, something in the scene — perhaps a flying machine, an object, or even a character — decides to start flying, and comes straight at the camera. Just as it's about to "impact", the scene cuts to black and we go to the credits. If they actually "hit" it, that falls under Camera Abuse.

The flying person/object doesn't need to be actually flying, but more often than not, it is.

Most common in special-effects laden movies. After the rise of CGI, this became much more popular, but earlier movies display it as well.

Compare Body Wipe, a similar zoom-in effect happening at the transition between two scenes, and Flyaway Shot, which might be combined with this trope. Contrast Riding into the Sunset where it ends with something moving away from the camera. Often overlaps with Jump Scare, specifically in horror movie endings.

## As this is an Ending Trope, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.

    -   The first movie ends with a VW Beetle flying into the camera just right after we see the minivan couple still lost in the desert they were in.
    -   The Spin-Off movie, _Planes_, ends with Dusty and Skipper flying at the camera. But, given that this is a movie about flying vehicles, it's highly expected.

-   _The Incredibles_ inverts, by finishing with the camera "flying" at Mr. Incredible's Chest Insignia.

-   _Batman Begins_ ends with Batman swinging off a rooftop and into the camera.
-   Played for laughs in _Blades of Glory_, which ends with Jimmy and Chazz soaring out into space for no discernable reason, in a film which is otherwise completely free of anything supernatural.

-   _Justice League (2017)_ has a post-credits sequence with Superman and Flash about to see who is faster with a race. It ends with them blasting off toward the screen, with a moment of them in Bullet Time just before we cut back to normal and they zip past. Naturally, we don't learn who wins.
-   _Kung Fury_ ends with a giant robot eagle ridden by Adolf Hitler flying straight at the camera. It's just that kind of movie.

-   _Resident Evil: Retribution_ ends with a dragon flying at the camera.
-   _Serenity_ has a chunk of the titular ship flying at the camera. And with this, it manages both Riding into the Sunset and fly-at-the-camera at the same time. And Book Ends nicely with the first time we see the ship in the movie... a piece of the ship breaks off, and Mal says, "What was that?"

    -   The first _Spider-Man_ ends with Spidey swinging at the camera.

    -   In "The Fight", after Chakotay frees _Voyager_ from "chaotic space" with some help from the local aliens, he ends up taking some time out for boxing on the holodeck.

-   _Sonic the Hedgehog_: The ending sequences to many 2D games feature Sonic (or Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Cream, etc.) jumping towards the player and posing while suspended in air. _Sonic the Hedgehog 2_'s ending is the most notable: both Tails' plane and Super Sonic fly away from the player only to come back head first.
