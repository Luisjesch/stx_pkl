_"This is the most upbeat song I've ever written. It's about death from cancer."_

— **Robyn Hitchcock**, preceding "The Yip Song", _Storefront Hitchcock_

So, you're listening to this new song. Sounds like it's going to be a fun little ditty. Then **the lyrics** start. You might sing to the melody for a bit, before it starts in: The singer is actually telling a tale about miserable subjects.

And the worst part is, the music, which sounds rather happy, just keeps going. That is Lyrical Dissonance: when the music and lyrics go in opposite directions. Happy upbeat lyrics set to sad music also qualifies. This can also be used for comic effect, either by putting serious, dramatic music to silly lyrics, or by simply treating the subject matter as if it did fit the tune. This trope also applies with lyrics that seem unfitting for reasons other than happiness versus sadness — for instance, a particularly angry or violent-sounding song that has lyrics that are clearly humorous, or sad, or perhaps just thoughtful and introspective; or the reverse, a cheery tune with angry or violent lyrics<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .

A rather old trope. One of the archetypal examples involves an evil chief of police plotting to blackmail a woman into having sex with him in order to save the man she loves, then have the man killed anyway, while all around him parishioners beg for God's mercy, all set to some of the most gorgeously beautiful music the composer ever wrote. That's from Puccini's 1900 opera, _Tosca_. Not the oldest by any means — but one that can easily compete with most of the examples below.

Sub-trope to Mood Dissonance. Compare to Scary Musician, Harmless Music, Soundtrack Dissonance, and The Mel Brooks Number, where the upbeat showtune melody is used for ribald or sarcastic effect. May lead to Isn't It Ironic?, if the song is used in a place where the people who selected it didn't listen to the lyrics very well. As one of the folders in this page shows, it might be related to The Cover Changes the Meaning.

Not to be confused with Lyrical Diss.

    Fan Works 

-   Several _Undertale_\-themed fan covers of "Stronger Than You" from _Steven Universe_ are this. The original song is a triumphant, self-affirming number about how Garnet is quite literally made of love (more specifically, Ruby and Sapphire's). The covers on the other hand:
    -   The Frisk cover is a broken song with a slow melody that is at times happy and at times solemn, with Frisk showing how the genocide path was started by curiosity and how they then found themself trapped in a cycle where they killed their friends and corrupted the first ally they had. They finally meet Sans and explain what L.O.V.E means, slowly dying time and time again because they don't know whether to kill their last and closest friend or try to reset everything to get back that happy ending. Sadly the things they have done are so big that they can't keep going, and they leaving themself open so Sans can kill them, with them being forced to "reset" again and take the same path as before. However, another interpretation is that Frisk after this chooses to take a more merciful path, so there is still a glimmer of hope.
    -   The one from Chara's perspective goes in the opposite direction. Their tone actually is quite triumphant, but far more sinister as Chara sings about how Sans can't possibly fight them forever, but they come back every time they die and get closer and closer to victory every time. The lyrics are filled with bloodlust and boasts of invincibility, outright _daring_ Sans to kill them again, clearly reveling in every moment of the fight.
    -   "Made of L.O.V.E" takes the same darker meaning as the above example, but this time the singer is _boasting_ about being a creature of pure violence.
-   "Bergentrückung" from _Undertale the Musical_ sounds like an epic battle between monster and hero, right? Until one hears Asgore say "I'm sorry" and everything goes downhill from there; the song goes on about how much they would love to stop, but they are forced upon this path.

    Literature 

    Radio 

-   This is more or less the entire purpose of "One Song to the Tune of Another" on the radio comedy show _I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue_. The words don't match the music, either in terms of depth, emotion, or intention. For example:
-   "Capatin Dinosaur" from _John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme_ is a happy, cheerful song with pretty silly, cheerful lyrics to match, until the last verse. (Zero-Context Example; what happens in the last verse?)

    Stand-Up Comedy 

-   In his stand-up show "Dress To Kill", Eddie Izzard points out the difference between American gospel and European hymns:
    
    **Izzard:** There's something phenomenally dreary about Christian singing. The gospel singers are the only ones that go crazy. It's amazing, and it's borne out of kidnapping, imprisonment, slavery, murder, all of that, and this joyous singing. And the Church of England, all the Christian religions, which is mainly Caucasian white people with power and money, enough to make Solomon blush, they're all singing... _\[dirge-like\]_ "O God, our help in ages past/Our hope for years to...?" They're the only people that can sing "Hallelujah" without feeling like it's a hallelujah moment. "Haaallelujah, Haaaalleeelujah/Joyfully we... lark abooouuut..." And... No, it's... It's just not kicking, is it?
    
-   Steve Martin:
    -   In Martin's famous stand-up routine "Excuse Me!", Steve gets angry with "the backstage crew", and then cheers himself up by playing the banjo. Which leads to this lyrical dissonance:
        
        **Martin:** You just can't sing a depressing song when you're playing the banjo. You can't go: _\[grins, plays happily and sings\]_ "Oh, murder and death and grief and sorrow!" _\[continues grinning and playing happily\]_
        
    -   Martin's song that his dad said he used to sing to him effects this. In the beginning it's about being nice to each other ("Be courteous, kind and forgiving"/"Be gentle and peaceful each day"), and then it evolves into being "obsequious, purple and clairvoyant". The rest of the song follows that pattern ("Be tasteless rude and offensive"/"Live in a swamp and be three-dimensional").

    Theme Parks 

-   "The Demon Song", used as a waiting-line theme track for Six Flags Great America's inversion-looping coaster, Demon, after its theming in 1980. A tongue-in-cheek account of the terrible menace allegedly possessing the coaster, that alternated with faux-news reports of "demon sightings" and mayhem ... yet sung with the upbeat, lighthearted choral tones of '70s easy listening.

    Web Animation 

-   In episode 12 of _Twelve (2016)_, Willow appears to be singing something along the lines of a classic playground rhyme or something while going down a flight of stairs. _It gets faster._
    
    _Down we go, down we go, down into the sea  
    Down we go, oh down we go, you're goin' down with me  
    Down we go, down we go, down with the ship  
    Down we go, oh down we go, we're goin' down with it  
    Down we go, down we go, down into the sea  
    Down we go, oh down we go, you're goin' down with me_
    
-   _ASDF Movie_ has "The Muffin Song", which has a cheerful-sounding melody, but is about how the muffin wants to die.
-   _Helluva Boss_: "Two Minutes' Notice" is an uptempo song where Fizzarolli joyously sings about how he's quitting his job due to the abuses placed upon him by his Mean Boss Mammon and has a refrain of "Fuck you!"
-   Kevin Temmer's channel "Kevin Temmer Tunes" features animations with upbeat songs that often have dark, sad or sometimes morbid lyrics. Possibly the most extreme example is "Quirky Bird Murderer", which has a girl cheerfully sing about tearing a bird apart and how happy she is about that.
-   "Off to the Henhouse" from the _Of Weasels And Chickens_ episode "Tough Cluck". It's a song about serial killing with a bouncy, snazzy tune.
-   _RWBY_:
    -   The first opening theme is the epic "This Will Be the Day". While it starts out talking about how badass Ruby Rose is, the second half tells a different story while keeping the same beat:
        
        _Beware that the light is fading  
        Beware as the dark returns  
        This world's unforgiving  
        Even brilliant lights will cease to burn_
        
        _Legends scatter  
        Day and night will sever  
        Hope and peace are lost forever_
        
    -   "Players and Pieces" has an epic fight sequence that is accompanied by an equally epic song entitled "Red Like Roses Part II". The song's lyrics begin with the following:
        
        _I couldn't take it, couldn't stand another minute  
        Couldn't bear another day without you in it  
        All of the joy that I had known for all my life  
        Was stripped away from me the minute that you died_
        
    -   "Die" from "Painting the Town..." is an upbeat, ass-kicking song... about how darkness is coming, ending with the lyrics "Now it's time to die".
    -   "Smile" details Ilia's tragic past and how it drives her to despise humanity. The melody is very upbeat and pleasant all the way through.
        
        _Take what you need  
        Leave them to bleed  
        Let them know bitter  
        While your revenge is sweet_
        

    Webcomics 

-   _Hiimdaisy_: "Your futile exis-tence has no meeea-ning~"
-   _Homestuck_ has the "Squiddle Song" on one of its Leitmotif albums. It's a folk-music song about a children's cartoon... that talks about how "all your friends are dead" and casually references buckets of blood, without losing the folk-music kids'-cartoon tone.
-   Probably intentionally invoked in Richard's de facto theme song, "Slaughter Your World", from the _Looking for Group_ movie. It's all about him being a genocidal maniac, set to the tune of "Part of Your World" from _The Little Mermaid (1989)_. Yes, seriously.
