_Then they were walking along the stream together and he said, "Maria, I love thee and thou art so lovely and so wonderful and so beautiful and it does such things to me to be with thee that I feel as though I wanted to die when I am loving thee."_  
_"Oh," she said. "I die each time. Do you not die?"_  
_"No. Almost. But did thee feel the earth move?"_  
_"Yes. As I died. Put thy arm around me, please."_

Inevitable Stock Phrase used after characters kiss/make out/have sex during an explosion, earthquake, or similar event. The phrase comes from Ernest Hemingway's _For Whom the Bell Tolls,_ when the hero and his lover are describing the intensity of the sexual pleasure they had (though, in that particular case, no literal earth-moving was involved). Naturally, the phrase lent itself to much spoofing.

Wow, there's a Red Sox game on" He gets up, puts his pants on, and tells her "By the way, I never want to see you again" as he's walking out the door. She never even changes her bored expression.

-   Played with in Patrick McManus' short story "The Sensuous Angler" in which he tells the tale of his torrid...er, fishing partnership with a co-worker whose husband Hammer hates fish and fishing. After sneaking over to her apartment for some hot-and-heavy perch-filleting action (and no, that's not a euphemism), Pat asks the question at hand.

-   Referenced but not actually said in _Blake's 7_ episode "Ultraworld": Tarrant and Dayna (an explosives and weaponry expert) are captured by the Ultras, who want them to demonstrate the "human bonding ceremony" so they can catalogue the information on their computer. They decide to humour the Ultras, while using the "ceremony" as cover for Dayna to extract an explosive device she has hidden in her tooth (?!). She blows a hole in the wall, they escape, the nonplussed aliens are left wondering what happened (one says something along the lines of "Was that the human bonding ceremony?")

-   Played for laughs in _The Golden Girls_. Dorothy is on the phone with Stan during the period where they were sneaking around.
    
    **Dorothy**: Did the earth move for you too? \*sees Rose listening in, turns to her\* Big quake in California.
    
-   This developed a visual gag in the older British satirical comedy show, _That Was the Week That Was_ (TW 3). Sometime around 1962, comedian Willie Rushton was seen getting into bed with an impossibly glamorous actress/model type. Amid giggling and sighing, foreplay ensues. The camera then cuts to stock footage of waves crashing against rocks, tall chimneys falling, train going into tunnels, et c. We cut back to Willie Rushton and girl, who are still in bed - but soaked through from the waves, covered in brick dust and rubble from the chimney, and smothered in soot from the steam-train. She is screaming. He is wide-eyed with panic.
    
    _Every bloody time we try something, all that bloody lot happens!_
    
-   Parodied on _NCIS_ when Tony and Ziva are stuck inside the office elevator after an explosion has ripped through the Navy Yard. The scene is very much played for Ship Tease.

    **Tony:** Did we? I thought the earth moved.
    
-   _Doctor Who_. Played straight in "The Power of the Doctor". The Master has come up with an Evil Plan involving Earthquake Machines, and invites the Doctor to "come and feel the Earth move." Then again, given their Foe Romance Subtext maybe he did mean it the other way...
