If you're going out, make it count.

**Picard:** What shall it be, Tomalak?  
**Tomalak:** You will still not survive our assault!  
**Picard:** And _you_ will not survive _ours_. Shall we die together?

You're _really_ in trouble now. You've been defeated, captured or otherwise humiliated by your enemies, and are now at their mercy. But you've got one last ace up your sleeve. The only problem is, this final attack is going to spell death for you as well as your enemies. But hey, you're going to die anyway! Might as well try to take some of them down with you.

Cue Earth-Shattering Kaboom via a Superpower Meltdown by using a Dangerous Forbidden Technique involving a Painful Transformation into a One-Winged Angel, or anything that suits your tastes, really. Don't forget, however, to growl in a menacing tone: "If I'm going to die, I'm Taking You With Me," or perhaps "See You in Hell."

When this trope is invoked, the hero usually survives, and the villain nearly always dies, regardless of who is trying to take whom with them. If it's the villain trying to take the hero, the attempt inevitably fails. If it's the hero trying to take the villain, the attempt inevitably succeeds, and it's likely (but not certain) that the hero will find a way to come out of it alive. (Exception: If the hero is a redeemed bad guy, the attempt inevitably succeeds and kills both of them.)

One form of Taking You with Me is when a villain deliberately sets up a Load-Bearing Boss situation, hoping to collapse his lair on the victorious heroes (over cries of "You'll kill us both\\all!"). Alternatively, the _threat_ of taking an attacker down with you can allow you to achieve a Victory Through Intimidation. If this action is taken by a usually stoic villain, may have been preceded by a Villainous Breakdown. May also occur after crossing the Godzilla Threshold.

-   Better to Die than Be Killed: A character chooses suicide rather than wait for their enemy to finish them off.
-   Dead Man's Switch: May be the purpose of some variants.
-   Do Not Go Gentle: A character's last great act before dying.
-   Double Knockout: A nonlethal cousin of this trope.
-   Game of Chicken: If neither player surrenders, both players will die.
-   Kill Us Both: The hero calls for both themself and the villain to be taken down by a third party.
-   Last Breath Bullet: The villain's dying act is to shoot the hero.
-   Last Stand: A prolonged version of this, involving more characters. It may, in fact, have several Taking You with Me incidents in it.
-   Mexican Standoff: Several players are equally prepared to take the others with them, but nobody wants to go first.
-   Murder-Suicide: When the killer ends their own life _after_ killing their victim.
-   Mutually Assured Destruction: Both sides are prepared to do this, knowing that the result will likely be a truce. (Specifically, on a global scale with nuclear weapons.)
-   Self-Poisoning Gambit: May be doing this if they don't have any means to counteract the poison.
-   Sore Loser: Might resort to this if they're upset enough.
-   Suicide Attack: When it's not the last resort but the plan all along.
-   Suicidal Cosmic Temper Tantrum: If all of the universe/reality is included with "you".

See also Sealed Evil in a Duel, Self-Destructive Charge, Mutual Kill, Suicide Attack, and Heroic Sacrifice. Compare Last Ditch Move for (not necessarily lethal or even offensive) scripted final actions. Contrast Villain's Dying Grace.

Not to be confused with Taking Them Home With Me. It also should not be confused with Backstab Backfire, where the death of the person trying to do a last ditch effort in killing his enemy did not plan the possibility of death when attempting to backstab them after being defeated.

    Card Games 

-   _Doomtown_ has a card called Take Ya With Me. Which was part of a cheesy strategy dubbed "lose to win" (use it with a mook to give your opponent a Pyrrhic Victory, maybe healing the mook afterward to add insult to injury) until it received errata that you can only target someone who's more of a mook than one of your dudes getting killed.
-   In _Duel Masters_, creatures with the "Slayer" ability (exclusive to Dark creatures) are able to destroy other creatures regardless of power level, at the price of destroying themselves in the process.
-   In _Magic: The Gathering_ any spell that deals damage to both you and an opponent such as Earthquake or Pestilence can be used for this.
    -   There are also creatures that can kill themselves to take out other creatures, or which hurl damage or direct creature killing around when they die.
    -   Sums up the _Deathtouch_ keyword quite well. Creatures with this ability<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  will always deal enough damage to kill any creature they battle regardless of how much damage they actually did, provided of course they do not have the _Indestructible_ keyword. And considering that most creatures with this keyword have low power and toughness values, this can very easily result in a Suicide Attack.
-   _Nuclear War_ has the "Retaliatory Strike" rule where a player who has lost the last of his population may immediately launch all of his missiles and warheads at whomever he likes. If one of his targets is eliminated in the process, then that nation may make a retaliatory strike of his own. It's possible to launch the unique 100 Megaton warhead in the hopes of getting a lucky roll and destroying the world in the process.
-   _Poo: the card game_ (a game based around monkeys throwing you-can-guess-what at each other) contains two copies of a card called Blaze of Glory, which allows a player, when eliminated, to fling all the poop he currently has at whoever he chooses. This tends to be hoarded along with all the really good poop, and has been known to produce a game which nobody wins thanks to chain reactions.
-   _We Didn't Playtest This At All_ features one card that reads that everyone loses by the end of the turn.
-   There are several cards that invoke this in the _Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG_. An obvious one is Self Destruct Button, which kills both players if there is a 7000 Life Point difference between players. A couple more would be Ring of Destruction (a card which dealt damage to both players equal to the targeted monster's attack, now amended specifically to prevent this) and Morphing Jar (if a player flips it when both players have less than five cards in their deck.) On a smaller scale, there are some Monster Cards that can either destroy the card that destroyed them or a completely different card depending on their effect; the best example is Man Eater Bug, best-played face-down to trick someone to attack with their own monster and then use the otherwise pathetic Man Eater Bug to destroy their biggest monster and there’s (usually) nothing that the opponent can do about it.

-   From _Infinite Crisis_, Brother Eye, after being attacked and its stabilizing unit sent hurling down to earth, activated its defense systems on the satellite to bring down its creator Batman with it as well.
-   _The Joker_ is often so Axe-Crazy that he's willing to include himself among his victims if that will get his point across. In the _Spider-Man/Batman_ crossover, for example, he couldn't bear the thought of Carnage killing Batman, and threatened to spring a lethal virus that would have likely killed everyone in the city - himself included — unless Carnage backed off. (And neither Batman nor Spider-Man thought for a second that he was bluffing.)
-   In the original _Men in Black_ comics, Agent Jay was set to be disintegrated by the Arbiter Doran. At the last second, Jay pulled Jerkass Agent Kay in with him. They both die, and are subsequently reformed as clones. Kay is led to believe he was talked into willingly dying alongside Jay, and wipes his partner's memory of the event.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic (IDW)_: In issue #20, Princess Celestia _tries_ to kill her mirror-world Evil Counterpart (which, due to synchronization, would have meant _her_ death, as well) after the latter hurts both versions of Luna.

-   _The Punisher_:
    -   In _The Punisher: Suicide Run_ storyline, the Punisher has just finished killing all the heads of the big Mafia families from around the world (again). He is helped by the fact he's carrying a dead man's trigger in his left hand, connected to a huge bomb in the otherwise empty building. But wait... there's one guy left. A jerk-ass nobody who runs some gangs out of New York. The punk points out it's just him and the Punisher and maybe both could walk away. Nope. No deal. BOOM.
    -   In the MAX series arc "Six Hours to Kill", Punisher is poisoned and told to kill someone to get the antidote. Instead, he kills the person who poisoned him and pulls out his list of scumbags, going through the methodically before the poison kills him. He actually runs out of targets before he runs out of time.

This turns into a Stupid Sacrifice when you realize that the energy cannon was being used to _rescue_ the trapped citizens of Echindaopolis on Knuckles' orders.
-   In the _Spider-Man_ storyline, _Ends of the Earth_, the Rhino, unable to live on after the new Rhino murdered his wife, ends up pinning Silver Sable to the floor of a flooding floor, the two seemingly drowning as Spidey makes the tough decision to face down Doctor Octopus. (He may not have been successful, however. The seer Madame Webb later told Spider-Man that Sable survived. She may have been lying — she has deceived Spider-Man to manipulate him before — but if it was the truth and Sable _did_ escape, then it is possible that the Rhino did too.)
    -   Speaking of Doc Ock, this was his plan all along — he plotted to flash fry the Earth with the exception of a VERY small fraction of the human race left alive to rebuild and remember him as the greatest monster to have ever lived. However, Spidey throws a wrench in that when he reveals that, even if those people lived, they'd be brain dead. Ock doesn't take that well.
    -   Another storyline, Morlun's introduction, had Spidey inject himself with radioactive material so that if he died from Morlun's feeding, Morlun would suffer a lethal dose of radiation.
-   _Star Wars: Kanan_: In issue 11 Coburn Sear sets himself on fire attempting to kill Caleb. He fails and Caleb decapitates him.
-   _Supergirl_:
    -   _Red Daughter of Krypton_: After her plan to destroy Worldkiller-1 — a body-snatching, genocidal alien abomination — fails, Supergirl decides that the only way to kill it is killing herself while it is trying to steal her body, so she removes her Red Ring, which usually results in instant death of the bearer.
    -   _Demon Spawn_: Once her plan fails, villain Nightflame's world starts dying. And she is dying together with it. So Nightflame attempts to destroy Supergirl to kill them both.
        
        **Nightflame:** I have failed to gain your powers, my world is at an end! There, I do not wish to live! By destroying you... I destroy myself!
        
    -   At the end of _New Krypton_, Reactron attempts to do this to Supergirl. He fails, but he takes her mother, her race and _her planet_ with him.

    -   _Kryptonite Nevermore_: Before Superman arrests him, a terrorist releases a hydrogen bomb, hoping that the explosive hits a magma pocket and destroys the world.
    -   In _All-Star Superman_, Lex Luthor isn't dying any time soon, but the realization that he's aging normally and his Arch-Enemy isn't is what drives him to finally "get serious about killing Superman."
    -   In _Superman_ #700, Lex Luthor, his crimes exposed to the world and his body dying, triggered explosives throughout Metropolis, vowing to destroy the city he once controlled rather than lose it to Superman.
    -   _The Death of Superman_ ends this way. The entire JLA has thrown everything they have at Doomsday, who has even brushed Superman aside in its attempt to obliterate Metropolis. At the very last, Superman realises that the only way to stop the creature is to plant himself directly in its path and beat it to death with his bare hands, knowing that he's going to take incredible (ultimately, fatal) damage in return.
-   _Superman: Space Age_: Bruce Wayne tries to get the Joker to let the children he's holding hostage go, but the Joker makes the demand that Bruce distract the police snipers wearing a clown mask while he makes a clean getaway wearing a Bruce Wayne mask. Bruce instead decides to make it so that both he and the Joker are shot dead.
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_\-the original Eastman and Laird series is far more brutal than the cartoons or movies made in its name. In its climactic Turtles vs Foot Clan scene, the Foot Clan is slashed to pieces (with blood and severed limbs all about) and Shredder beaten to a gasping pulp. Leonardo offers him a dagger with which to perform seppuku, so he could go out like the samurai he dresses like. Instead, Shredder pulls out a grenade and attempts to perform this trope.
-   In the _Teen Titans_ storyline _The Judas Contract_, when Terra believes she's been betrayed by Deathstroke, she flips out and begins trying to kill everyone — Deathstroke, the Titans, even H.I.V.E. — in her rage and taking them with her. All she ends up doing is killing herself.

-   In _X-Men_, at the end of the Inferno arc, Madelyne Pryor tries to trap _Jean Grey_ in her dying mind and thus take her with her, recreating the incident that awakened Jean's powers in the first place (Jean nearly died inside the mind of her friend Annie, who was run over — Madelyne was given this memory by Sinister). Madelyne would succeed if it weren't for the Phoenix Force offering Jean the opportunity to live if she absorbs both Phoenix and Madelyne's personalities.

    Comic Strips 

-   One _Dilbert_ Sunday strip had Dilbert outline his plan for a project that would end with Dilbert committing suicide via leaping off the building. His hope was to crush his boss when he landed.

After learning that her war was practically lost, she gathered all her remaining forces for one last stand; to wipe out as many Celestia's forces as she could.

-   In _The Second Try_:
    -   Just as in canon, Rei attempts to do this when the 16th Angel is fusing with her... only for Armisael to reveal that he had discovered her intent in Asuka's mind when he briefly tried to unify with her as well and has reacted accordingly by disabling Unit-00's self-destruct mechanism. As a last resort, Rei uses a watered-down version of the forbidden union of Adam and Lilith to merge with her EVA, triggering a mini-Impact which causes as much damage to Tokyo-3 as the original self-destruction.

-   In _The Bridge_, Grand King Ghidorah is mortally wounded by Godzilla Junior impaling him through his core (the organ that serves as both his heart and brain) while Xenilla has him distracted, liberating the countless souls he'd devoured that begin tearing his body apart during their escape. Grand King Ghidorah's response is to attempt this trope by channeling all of his power into a super charged Gravity beam capable of leveling a continent in an attempt to take the brothers and all of Equestria down with him. With some help from Rarity, Harmony, and Godzilla Senior, they manage to win the resulting Beam-O-War and Grand King Ghidorah is the only one that dies.
-   Some examples in the sidestories of _Pokémon Reset Bloodlines_:

    -   Another non-lethal example in the Hiker Interlude. The title character loses half his team to Paul's Torterra, and sacrifices his Golem using Explosion to take him down. Unfortunately, that only leaves him with two Pokémon to face against Paul's four, and ultimately loses the battle.
-   _Aska_: During her freak out Ayra decides this after realising she can't beat Nico without dying herself. Fortunately for her it doesn't come to this.
-   Invoked at the climax of _Hellsister Trilogy_'s second arc, when Supergirl faces up to Darkseid, aware that he will most likely kill her, but determined to try and to take him with her.
    
    Kara struggled to bring herself up, to land a last blow that would take Darkseid’s life. She hated herself for doing it, but if she was to die, she would take the Dark Lord down with her.
    
-   Several examples in _Beast Wars Fan Series_:
    -   Cheetor TRIES to invoke this during his final battle with Spittor; Spittor dies, Cheetor lives.

    -   Galvatron tries to drag Optimus into the time rift with him, but is stopped by the other Maximals pulling Optimus out and Victoria shooting him in the face.
-   In _Pokémon Master_, Brock has his Pokemon self-destruct as attempting to take Ash out. Shortly later, he blows himself and Lance up.
-   In the _Marvel Universe_ fanfiction _FIRE! (DarkMark)_, Red Skull devises a ploy to kill himself and Captain America simultaneously, reasoning that their conflict will only end when both of them are dead.

**Red Skull:** Then let me show you a bit of the world below, my friend. Or, perhaps, only tell you about it. Within this cathedral, at its lowest level, is an incendiary device.  
**Captain America**: A fire bomb!  
**Red Skull:** Do not worry yourself. Less time remains than you would need to reach it. No man remains alive in this structure, other than ourselves. Within seconds, no man will be alive in it at all. I have taken the opportunity to retire us both from battle, Captain. The conflict is ended. Farewell.

The others decide to flee and warn their respective allies rather than fight him, and Drago gleefully escapes in the chaos as the prison collapses.

-   _Darth Vader: Hero of Naboo_: When Sidious realizes he's going to lose his fight with Vader and the Jedi, and that even if he escapes he'll soon lose his Force connection because of Plagueis' poison, he spitefully uses what strength he has left to unleash a Force Storm. While this will inevitably overwhelm and kill him, he's still happy to use it to kill his enemies and destroy as much of Coruscant as possible. Thanks to Vader's sheer hatred of Sidious making him strong enough to power through it, the storm is stopped and Sidious dies alone.
-   Khaos Omega pulls off a very unusual inversion during 'Angels of Fodlan' of the Amethyst Evolution saga: A mortally-wounded Solon fires a vicious curse at Edelgard in an attempt to take her with him, only for the XQ immortality-enforcing failsafe, which she had _only just obtained unknowingly less than an hour prior_, to kick in. To make matters worse for Anise, who had woken up to Edelgard right in her face, the Adrestian heiress' use of an "S-Bond" technique (which until then Anise didn't know she had access to) is upgraded into making her a true member of Anise's subdivision, completing Edelgard's goal of officially joining said subdivision by working her way into Anise's heart regardless of their differing ranks.
-   In _The Awakening of a Magus_, Peter, upon realizing the potion he drank to protect himself from the Veritaserum was actually intended to stop interrogations in a more thorough manner, starts rattling out as many Death Eater names as he can, including Malfoy, who sent the potion.
-   _Vow of Nudity_: When the harpies have the Jackal at their mercy, she taunts them into surrounding her and then detonates a hidden bundle of dynamite to take them with her.
-   _Shadows over Meridian_: As Frost's army is about to breach Cavigor, the Warden, convinced all of his prisoners are as vile as Phobos, orders his men to murder them before they can be freed and join Phobos' army. When Vathek and Drake catch up with the Warden's lieutenant Jax in the prison's third level just as Frost's army enters the prison through the forgotten maintenance tunnel leading to that very level, Jax has a Villainous Breakdown under the belief that none of this would be happening if Phobos, his minions and Kage had all been killed in the first place, and decides to kill Vathek and Drake (whom he sees as responsible due to not sharing his radical beliefs) before going down himself. He gets killed by Frost before he can kill either.
-   _The Weaver Option_: In the Battle of the Death Star, Colonel Larkine is mortally injured by a squad of Eldar led by a High Farseer. Larkine answers by pulling the pin on a grenade.
-   Nonlethal and Played for Laughs example in _Shared Strength_: When Sinon refused to get out of bed one morning, Kazuto, after persuasion failed, resorted to Friendly Tickle Torture to get her out. As Sinon's flailing moved her to the edge, and gravity reared its ugly head, she grabbed Kazuto's hand, resolving that if she was going down, she'd take him with her.
-   In the _Star Wars Rebels_ story _A Sword to Pass_, as the saboteur bleeds out, he decides in his final moments to shoot open a vent unleashing hot gas to try and kill Tristan and Alrich.

    Film — Animated 

-   _Batman: Mask of the Phantasm_: Batman has reached his Despair Event Horizon and grabs on to the Joker's escape jetpack as an abandoned amusement park is exploding.
    
    **Joker**: I'm your only chance to get out of here! Let me go or we'll both die!  
    **Batman**: Whatever it takes!
    
-   In _The Book of Life_, Chakal tries to use his bombs in order to destroy the entire town. Manolo however ends up trapping the both of them inside a bell, containing the explosion to just the two of them. However, Joaquin secretly gave Manolo the Medal of Everlasting Life, which let him survive unscathed.
-   Sitka's method of dispatching the bear that was attacking Kenai (after Kenai went after said bear alone for reasons explained earlier) in _Brother Bear_; they're on top of a glacier, and Sitka drives his spear into the ice, causing a huge block of the glacier to break off and fall into the river below, taking the bear with him. Sitka dies but the bear survives, motivating Kenai to once again track the bear down and slay it in an act of revenge, which in turn invokes the wrath of the Great Spirits and kicks off the rest of the plot.
-   In the _DC: The New Frontier_ DVD, Agent Faraday has just enough strength to grab and unpin two grenades before the monster swallows him. The Martian Manhunter is moved by his Heroic Sacrifice and subsequently goes on a nice little rampage. In the comic the film is based on, the action was done by John Cloud instead. While it was insanely awesome, the subplot had little to do with the plot, so it was cut, and the moment was integrated into Faraday's Heroic Sacrifice.
-   At the end of _Dinosaur_, as the Carnotaurus is about to fall into the ravine, he immediately bites onto Aladar's tail, but the _Iguanodon_ manages to shake him off before climbing back up.
-   Subject of a gag in _The Emperor's New Groove_, after Kuzco saves Pacha from falling:
    
    **Kuzco:** "Oooh, I'm a crumbly canyon wall and I'm taking you with me." Well, not today pal! A-huh! _\[llama strut\]_ A-huh a-huh a-huh!
    
-   In _Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children_, this happens when Loz and Yazoo shoot Cloud through the back whilst he's having a Redemption in the Rain moment, before making a huge explosion. It partly works, killing themselves, but only sending Cloud to The Lifestream for a couple of minutes.
    -   Having been somehow formed almost exclusively by Jenova, they were actively dissolving in the purifying rain — explosion unrelated. Still, the were avenging Sephiroth, Jenova, and Kadaj by killing Cloud even as they went down, so it still counts. Only Cloud had a Get Out of Death Free card for world-saving, apparently.
-   In the climax of _The Great Mouse Detective_, Basil manages to defeat Ratigan by activating the chimes on the Big Ben clock tower; the resulting shockwave sends Ratigan falling from the tower to his doom. In a last-ditch effort to defeat his arch nemesis, he grabs ahold of Basil and takes him with him as he falls, but Basil manages to survive by grabbing a part of the blimp he was hanging onto and using it like a propeller.
-   _Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths_: In the opening scene, the Jester (alternate universe good counterpart to the Joker) is cornered by two of the Crime Syndicate:
    
    **Jester:** Okay! I'm down to my last joke anyway...  
    _(he pulls out and triggers a grenade)_  
    **Jester:** ...but this one'll _kill_ ya!
    
-   _Justice League Dark: Apokolips War_ sees a crapton of this:
    -   Shazam! calls out his namesake word to take out the Paradooms attacking him.
    -   Likewise, the last members of the Suicide Squad and Lois Lane blow up Lexcorp Tower to stop the Paradooms from getting to Superman's team.
    -   Raven _wants_ John Constantine to kill her if she can't control Trigon to ensue Trigon can't escape. However, Constantine simply knocks the gem off and lets Trigon out to take on Darkseid.
    -   Trigon himself grabs Darkseid to ensue both get sucked into the Boom Tube Cyborg opened to suck in Apokolips. Might count for Cyborg himself as he can't leave thanks to Darkseid fusing him to the planet's systems.
-   In _Kung Fu Panda 3_, when Po discovers that the Wuxi Finger Hold won't work on the immortal Kai, Po grabs Kai in a bear hug and uses the hold on himself, taking them both into the Spirit Realm.
-   In _The Land Before Time_, Sharptooth grabs Petrie as they plummet into the pond below, though the flyer survives.
-   In _Legend Of The Guardians The Owls Of Ga Hoole_, Kludd tries to do this with Soren by dragging him down into a fire in the forest. However, while he's holding onto a branch, he lets go of Soren for a bit...grabs onto the branch he was holding to (thanks to a broken wing) and falls into the fire below. Sorry it didn't work out for you, Kludd.
-   The secondary antagonist, Dumbella Richard, pulls this trick in the third _Madeline_ film _My Fair Madeline_ following her defeat. She twists the details of the story when she is confronted and Madeline winds up arrested alongside her and the Big Bad, Maximo Richard. This invokes a Downer Ending for the penultimate act, which in turn causes the final act to have a Downer Beginning. In fact, this could have cause a Downer Ending for the entire film... hadn't Emma atoned for her actions.
-   _The Rugrats Movie_ has Spike dangling from the end of a bridge while fighting a Savage Wolf. Once the wolf is distracted by Angelica blowing a raspberry at it, Spike grabs the wolf's tail and hurls himself and the wolf off of the bridge. Spike lives, the wolf doesn't.
-   In the Made-for-TV Movie _Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost_, when Thorn traps the ghost of Sarah Ravencroft back inside her (Sarah's) own spellbook, she takes her great-great-great-grandson Ben with her.
    
    _"I WON'T GO BACK ALONE!!!"_
    
-   Heavily implied in _Sleeping Beauty_; after Prince Philip has thrown his sword at Maleficent, piercing her heart, she makes one final lunge at him before falling to her death.
-   _Storks_: Hunter tries to pull this as he is falling by using the giant robot claw to grab the ledge that Junior, Tulip, and the baby are standing on, but Junior flies himself and the girls back to safety.
-   In _Tangled_, after being lethally stabbed by Gothel, Eugene decides to cut Rapunzel's hair, the only thing keeping Gothel young, rather than allow Rapunzel to use her hair to heal him — effectively ending Gothel's life.
-   In _Thumbelina (1994)_, Grundel grabs Cornelius as they tumble into the tunnel bridge abyss below.
-   Just before the end of _Toy Story 3_, Lotso, after Big Baby throws him into a dumpster, grabs Woody by the leg and pulls him into said dumpster, just as the garbage truck comes to take them to the dump. Subverted afterward as after Woody and Buzz save Lotso from being shredded to bits, he leaves the other toys to be incinerated rather than push the emergency stop button to save them. They do get saved by the Squeeze Toy Aliens at the last second.

    Music 

-   Rob Dougan's _Left Me For Dead_ features this as the last line before the final refrain.
    
    _I wanted to say  
    To say that your shot proved the death of me  
    'Cause now I've reached a dead end  
    And I can't go back  
    But if I'm going down you'll come with me_
    
-   Sabaton's "Attack of the Dead Men" tells the story of the Russians doing essentially this to the Germans during World War I. After being hit with poisonous chlorine gas and knowing they were dead either way, the Russians charged the Germans who outnumbered them nearly 70:1 to take as many with them as they could.
-   Twista's _Kill Us All_
-   Averted by Emilie Autumn in her song 'Let The Record Show'
    
    "If I'm going down, then I'm going down good"
    
-   Similar in spirit, but lacking an actual enemy, in Voltaire's "The Ship's Going Down". The ship is utterly destroyed, and the captain takes a small bit of solace in the fact that his crew is going down with him and he's not dying alone. Then he spots the guy no one likes trying to make a getaway on a raft; not having that, he lances a fish-gig into Seaman Shaft's eye.
-   The Dixie Chicks song "If I Fall You're Going down with me" is an inversion of this trope since the song is actually about falling in love as opposed to dying.
    
    _We're hanging right on the edge now baby  
    The wind is getting stronger  
    We're hanging on by a thread now honey  
    We can't hold on much longer  
    It's a long way down but it's too late_
    
    _If I fall you're going down with me  
    You're going down with me baby if I fall  
    You can't take back every little chill you give me  
    You're going down with me baby heart and all ooh yeah_
    
-   Five Finger Death Punch's _If I Fall._ Especially the ending.
    
    _If I fall,_  
    _Fuck You All._  
    _I'm taking everybody out._  
    _If I fall I will take everybody down._  
    _If I fall I will._
    
-   The Marilyn Manson song The Minute Of Decay has this refrain:
    
    _I'm on my way down now, I'd like to take you with me..._
    
-   In the full video for The Decemberists' "O Valencia!", Colin Meloy's character meets at a diner with the man who betrayed him and poisons his drink. The man stabs him in the neck just before he dies.
-   Second Chances by d.notive. Basically, the whole album is about a police detective who accidentally travelled 30 years back in time and is going to use the opportunity to hunt down and prevent the maniac from murdering his younger sister this time. And this song clearly states his intentions regarding the man he's after, literally qouting the trope.
    
    _I'm not promised a way back,_  
    _And if I die, I'm taking you with me._
    
-   Trickywi's song "Destiny Bond" is a tribute to the _Pokémon_ move of the same name, so naturally it has this trope as a major theme.
    
    _Make a move on me_  
    _I'll be your last memory_  
    _Take me down, the trick's on you_  
    _Because you're coming with me_
    
-   The opening lines of Iron Maiden's "The Trooper":
    
    _You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too!_  
    _You fire your musket but I'll run you through!_
    
-   From "Halliburton Boardroom Massacre" by David Rovics:
    
    _I thought of Halliburton and the military brass  
    And the things they get away with  
    All for their ruling class  
    But I'm not a pawn and I can't let it be  
    And if I'm gonna die I'm gonna take some of them fuckers with me_
    
-   Eminem's album _Encore_ ends with a skit where Slim Shady screams "you're coming with me!", massacres his audience, then kills himself.
-   According to her backstory, the main character of "Perfectly Sweet", Sarai, died when her bakery was set on fire by its new owner. Seeing the owner trying to get away, Sarai pulled him into the flames with her, killing them both.
-   “No Children” by the Mountain Goats famously has this as its final chorus, detailing a married couple that hates each other. The song’s cathartic nature has made it a staple of their live sets, with the audience often joining in to sing along.
    
    _I am drowning  
    There is no sign of land  
    You are coming down with me  
    Hand in unlovable hand  
    And I hope you die  
    I hope we both die_
    

    Mythology and Religion 

-   Russian _bylina_ tales tell of the Chud people, who, when losing a war, would dig a tunnel system, go there with their women, children and treasure, make a Last Stand and then collapse the tunnels, killing themselves with their enemies. Several such sites have actually been found.
-   In some denominations of Christianity (e.g. Orthodoxy), this is why Satan and his demons continue to fight against God even though as former angels, they already know that God will eventually win and send them to the lake of fire. Satan just wants to bring as many people to Hell as he can before this happens. Talk about Evil Is Petty! (In some other Christian teachings, Satan actually believes he can win and so this trope doesn't apply.)
-   The Bible also tells that this is how Samson died. After he was tempted by Delilah into revealing the secret of his Super-Strength, she, at the behest of his enemies, the Philistees, had him drugged so they could shave his head while he was unconscious. When Samson came to his senses again, he was powerless and captured by the Philistees, who blinded him and made him a slave. After some time of forced labors however, his head's hair grew back, and with it, unknown to the Philistees, his strength returned. Then many of the Philistees had a feast in the temple of their god Dagon to celebrate capturing Samson, so some of them had the great idea to bring Samson into the temple, just to mock and ridicule him. Samson prayed to God one last time and, laying his hands on two of the temple's columns, he brought them down, causing the whole temple to collapse over all who were in it, including Samson himself. The Bible notes that the Philistees who died at the temple's destruction were more numerous than all the ones Samson had fought before being captured.

    **von Schlitz:** Please! Please! I will give you anything you want!  
    **Red Ensign:** _This_ is what I want.
    

    Stand Up Comedy 

-   Denis Leary, in one of his '90s routines, had a bit (here, starting around 3:00) that could _at best_ be described as "offensively sacrilegious". If the audience's net reaction is even _somewhat_ positive, he adds a denouement, the implication that taking them with him will soften the sting a bit:
    
    "—I'm goin' to Hell for that bit. And _you're all comin' with me!_ 'We didn't laugh at that bit Jesus, pleeeaase!' 'Shut up! Get on the bus with Leary and Scorsese; you're goin' right to fuckin' Hell!' "
    
-   George Carlin: On wrathful gods: "If there is a God, IF there is... may he strike this audience dead. See? Nothing happened. Okay, if there is a God, may he strike ME dead. Still nothing." On terrorism: "I think just the concept that a man can blow up a bomb in a crowded market and kill a couple hundred people is exciting and stimulating and I see it as a form of entertainment. I have always been willing to put myself at great personal risk for the sake of entertainment. I'm also willing to put YOU at great personal risk for the same reason."

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Battletech_: At the start of the Clan Invasion, a fighter pilot named Tyra Mirborg suffered terminal damage to her craft. Knowing she was dead, she drove her ship directly into the bridge of a nearby Clan ship. Fate smiled on her; this was the command vessel for the invasion, and her impact caused Smoke Jaguar ilKhan (and commander of the invasion) Leo Showers to be sucked out the broken windows into space. This delayed the Clan invasion for a year as they argued over who should replace Showers, giving the Inner Sphere time to rearm and prepare.
-   _Call of Cthulhu_:
    -   The famous player character _Old Man Henderson_, upon finally being targeted personally by the Hastur cultists with a siege of zombies and shoggoths, holed up with his allies in a skating rink and rigged it with "enough explosives to make Michael Bay blush", taking the cultists, monsters, allies, and _the Yellow King himself_ with him in a literal blaze of glory.
    -   _Arkham Horror_ has an item called a time bomb. You place up to 3 clue tokens on it, and when it detonates, everything in that neighborhood dies, including players. This is why you can put no clue tokens on it and just have it detonate immediately in your hands, killing your character but taking everything nearby out. This can be incredibly taxing on your efforts and a worse idea the further into the game you get, but early-on if you're facing a situation where the Terror Track will rise or some other awful thing will happen, just blow the monsters up.
-   _Chronopia_ allows mages to perform such a manoeuvre. By expending all their remaining Wisdom points (the mana of the game), which is instant death by itself, they get to spend half their maximum Wisdom points _as well_, using it _all_ to power a _single_ spell without the usual skill penalties for using high-level magic. While it's still possible to fumble the skill throw and not all spells are suitable for a suicide casting like this, a spell like _Explosion_ is sure to cause some severe damage to the topography and anyone unlucky enough to be caught within the blast radius...
-   _Dungeons & Dragons_:
    -   The _staves of power_, minor artifacts that are a great boon for any spellcaster wielding one of them. In dire straits, their wielder can also break the staff they have... resulting in a retributive strike, which does vast amounts of damage to almost anything capable of threatening them. There's a possible side-effect of a retributive strike that subverts the trope: A 50% chance of the strike opening a rift and casting you into the astral plane (or a random plane, depending on the edition).
    -   The Draconians in the old _Dragonlance_ setting were evil creatures magically created by evil clerics from the eggs of metallic (good) dragons to fight in the _War of the Lance_. When mortally wounded, depending on the type, they tended to go up in flames, emit poisonous gas, trap the killing weapon by turning to stone, explode, go berserk and _then_ explode...
    -   A Lich is not killed permanently until someone destroys its phylactery, at which point it explodes immediately. A campaign run by Shamus Young had a lich's phylactery cursed and trapped so while it might be _possible_ to destroy it with ordinary means, it would kill everyone within a 100-mile radius.
    -   When a Balor dies, at least in the 3.5 edition, it explodes in a ball of fire that deals 100 points of damage to everyone within 100 feet. Even better, it happens instantaneously, as soon as they drop to "dead" (-10 hit points). So if you don't kill the sucker from afar, you are faced with a Total Party Kill **anyway** (if everybody's still clear of 100 HP after a fight with a Balor, you've probably passed the level at which Balors are meant to be a challenge).
    -   The balor is topped by the nuclear elemental from _d20 Modern_, which exploded for 400 points of untyped damage in a 400 feet radius, and 100 points of untyped damage to those farther than 400 feet away but within a one-mile radius. (Reflex save for half). That, and it also makes a highly radioactive crater.
        -   Barring special rules, the Reflex Save for half allows anyone with Evasion to dodge the blast entirely.
        -   The 3rd edition third party splatbook "The Slayers Guide to Dragons" gives us the new age category "Dracos Invictus". When dying, these dragons have death throes that cause 10D6 crush damage, variable explosive damage from 8D6 (white) to 14D10 (red/gold), **and** can enact a curse so powerful on the PCs that the DM is _encouraged to alter the course of the campaign_ to see that it's fulfilled. There is no save against the curse.
    -   _Forgotten Realms_:
        -   Dragonmagic includes "death matrix". It needs to be cast only once to ensure that the dragon's body will explode upon death unless disintegrated or something similar. As an implanted magic ability, it can't be detected or dispelled like normal enchantments.
        -   The Red Wizards of Thay have the "spell lash". It's a spell that kills the caster and makes their body explode. It was invented during Red Wizards' independence war with the Mulhorand theocracy (the experimental variant "mark of Gur", naturally, was castable on another guy).
        -   Long before this was "blood dragon", a spell castable only by an elf (not even half-elf). The caster cuts down him- or herself, and then the eponymous magical construct rises from the spilled blood and attacks the target. If it as much as touches its victim it dissolves their flesh. They were a rather vengeful bunch, those elves.
    -   3.5 edition's Complete Scoundrel has the "fatal flame" spell which, should its target die before the spell expires, explodes their body in a fireball of power proportional to the target's level. Naturally, it can be used on ally or foe alike.
    -   In 4th Edition, there is the low-level Boneshard Skeleton that has an absolutely brutal blast for its level that goes off either when bloodied _or_ when reduced to 0 hit points. Worse, if you have a group of them, it's possible that their blast can cause chain reactions with other Boneshard Skeletons caught in the area, with one blast triggering possibly all of them.
    -   In almost any edition, it's become a Running Gag for a person's dying words to be "Hastur, Hastur, Hastur". Canonically, Hastur will then pay a quick visit that results in a good-sized crater where the PC, their party, and whatever they were fighting used to be.
-   _Earthdawn_: An optional rule allows players to do a "dying act". The character is allowed to spend all of their karma dice on a single roll, after which he or she is dead beyond the reach of any resurrection magic. If the roll in question is a damage roll, it becomes this trope.
-   _Exalted_: Dragon-Bloods have access to a series of Charms with the Martyr keyword, which becomes significantly more terrifying when they're used by a dying man, many of which are combat effects. The most notorious is the Essence 7 elemental nuke called As In The Beginning, so a dying DB gets to take _entire battlefields_ with him.
-   This is how equal pieces fight in _Game of the Generals_. Unless they're flags, in which case the aggressor wins.
-   _Mafia_: More complex versions of the game (as well as its variations, like _Werewolf_) will often include a "killing role" character, such as Hunter or Rambo. Rules for these characters vary, but their usual role is to take a set number of other players down with them when they're killed.
-   _Mage: The Ascension_: Being a game of supremely high stakes, often high-energy magic, and doomed romanticism, _Mage_ and its spin-offs maybe encourage this sort of mindset. Notably, the Renaissance-period version, _Mage: The Sorcerers Crusade_ featured references to High Artisan Magistrate Roland Hoffmann, whose artillery was crucial to the defeat of Infernal powers at the Battle of Harz. And when the enemy got through to his guns, Hoffmann and his crews detonated their gunpowder stores, taking down everything on that side of the battlefield.
-   _Monopoly_ presents this unlikely, but possible, scenario. Should one player become bankrupt by being unable to afford the rent to an opponent, that opponent takes possession of the bankrupted player's assets. The opponent then must pay 10% interest on all acquired mortgaged properties immediately. The opponent could theoretically get knocked out of the game as well by not being able to pay off the interest. For this to happen, the bankrupted player must have lots of mortgaged properties and little other assets while the opponent must be on the verge of becoming bankrupt.
-   _Nuclear War_: When a player is eliminated, they may immediately launch any missiles and warheads in their arsenal at targets of their choice, most likely the player who just took them out. This can trigger a chain reaction if it eliminates another player, potentially leaving no survivors.
-   _Paranoia_ encourages this, even above and beyond survival (because clones mean Death is Cheap anyway): "What's more important — that you survive, or that your enemy gets his?" Especially if you're on your last clone anyway, and thus (at least personally) have nothing left to lose: "Friend Computer, I wish to make a full confession. All the charges leveled against me are true. And all the _other_ charges that Suck-R knows about and hasn't mentioned yet are true. And all the vidtape footage that Gone-R collected and hid in his locker is accurate..." Of course, there are no such charges and no such footage, but how would the Computer know that? If you're lucky and/or amuse the GM enough, It may even forgive or forget about you as It focuses on these other traitors.
-   _Pathfinder_: If a bastion archon is killed by an evil creature, it explodes in a powerful burst of holy light that consecrates an area of forty feet around it, quite possibly killing whatever entity managed to slay it while simultaneously healing any surviving allies.
-   _Princess: The Hopeful_: Under normal circumstances, a Dethroned cannot be permanently killed, they reincarnate after death just as Princesses do. However, the Court of Storms has a special Charm that lets a Princess of Storms latch onto the Dethroned's soul and drag it with her into the presence of the Queen of Storms, annihilating both souls. Many Furies consider this a worthy sacrifice for taking one of the Darkness's most potent champions out of play.
-   _Warhammer_:
    -   Anyone who kills a Tomb King is attacked by voracious beetles.
    -   Dwarfs have the option to put self-destruct runes on their war machines.
    -   The Doom Diver, an orc and goblins war machine, specifically fires goblins at the enemy. Goblins line up for the chance to go out in a blaze of glory as living ammunition. Night goblins also have fanatics; joining them is almost certainly a death sentence, but nothing is more inspiring and magnificent than a tiny goblin whirling a huge ball and chain around its head.
    -   The Heart of Woe is a magic amulet that explodes when the bearer dies. Orcs are fond of giving these to goblins, whose default reaction is "Dat wuz nice o' da boss ter give me dis shiny fing, but why's 'e sendin' me orf alone on dis wolf?"
    -   Wyverns, monstrous mounts available to orc heroes, have a poisonous tail-stinger attack that is resolved at the end of a round of melee combat. Their entry explicitly states that wyverns can make this final tail attack even if they died in the preceding round of combat — indeed, Skullmuncha, the steed of the legendary orc warlord Azhag the Slaughterer, was nearly decapitated in its final battle, and its tail still reflexively stabbed forward to impale the hero who killed it.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_: Quite a lot of beings tend to follow this trope.
    -   The prime culprit in the tabletop game itself is possibly the Eversor assassin, whose gene-boosted body _explodes_ upon suffering sufficient physical trauma, usually taking with him whatever he was fighting at the time.
    -   The super-heavy units in the mass-combat expansion _Apocalypse_. They'll often take out entire squads if they explode, even if the squad(s) in question wasn't even in close combat with it. Titans have a special rule called "reactor meltdown" which causes them to explode with an even bigger blast that's also strength D (auto wound or penetrating hit on anything in range). An exploding Titan can take every unit on the board with it!
    -   The Brass Scorpion, a Chaos superheavy walker gets +2 on the table that determines the size of the explosion as the daemon controlling it is driven to spill as much blood as possible, even in death.
    -   There's an ability for the Imperial Guard in the _Apocalypse_ books called "Fire on my coordinates!" Any Imperial Guard soldier with a radio can roll for a leadership test. If he succeeds, an orbital bombardment is dropped right on top of his own position — assuredly killing himself (and his squad) along with any nearby enemies in the process.
-   _Werewolf (1997)_ features the Bomb, which kills anyone that aims to kill it at night.
-   _Battlefleet Gothic_: The larger ships have a chance of opening a portal to hell when their reactors blow, sucking everything nearby in along with it. Tyranids are so horrifically terrifying that ships can attempt to do this _on purpose_ if the get boarded by them.
    -   A few Tau leaders are given a bomb that detonates if the Tau leader is removed as a casualty. This is viewed as "the greatest expression of the Greater Good one can make" as (depending on the edition) it allowed their squad to escape close combat (which Tau dread) or might tip the close combat their way (current 7th edition, 2016). The Tau otherwise have no suicide attackers and consider suicidal stands to be foolish, favoring feigned retreats and delaying tactics until they can amass massive fire superiority and punch through.
    -   After losing one of his two hearts, the Space Wolf character Lukas the Trickster had it replaced with a stasis bomb. If he's ever killed in combat, there's a chance his opponent will be trapped in a stasis field with him for eternity. Lukas's stasis bomb can one-shot an Imperator Titan!
    -   This tends to be averted by the Eldar, who see this tactic as an act of barbaric cowardice. They also dislike it because they're already on the verge of extinction themselves, even though they believe that their racial demise will awaken the death god Ynnead, who will destroy Chaos forever and play this trope straight.
    -   The Grey Knight codex has the Brotherhood Champion, an exemplary swordsman of the Chapter capable of going toe to toe with the best fighters of chaos and standing a decent chance of winning. But even when killed, he draws upon all his psychic might and delivers a mutual deathstroke to his foe. This has a fifty-fifty chance of succeeding, and it kills anything, even Eternal Warriors and Physical Gods.
    -   The 9th Vostroyan Firstborn regiment of the Imperial Guard was destroyed during the battle for Karak Prime against a splinter of Hive Fleet Moloch. The regiment had been driven back to a single hive, but the Tyranids were themselves racing against time to consume the planet and move on before its winter season set in, as the falling temperatures would weaken them too much to properly process the world and avoid starvation. The Vostroyans didn't have the manpower and munitions needed to hold out that long, however, and in order to avoid being overrun they resorted to opening the hive doors, waiting for the larger part of the Tyranids to swarm in, and detonating the hive's power plant, incinerating it, themselves, and about 85% of the horde. The remaining Tyranids starved to death over the coming months, killing off the splinter fleet.
    -   As of 9th Edition, several factions have access to stratagems that allow them to automatically detonate vehicles that have been destroyed to allow the player to follow this trope, such as the Chaos Knight strategem "Spiteful Demise".

    Theatre 

-   _Defied_ by the eponymous protagonist of _Hamilton_ at the play's climax. In his final solo, seeing his friend-turned-rival Aaron Burr's gunshot coming towards him and knowing he is about to die, he deliberates over whether his final action should be to shoot his soon-to-be-murderer in retaliation. He chooses to spare his life.
-   In _Hamlet_, the titular character, already dying from poison, stabs King Claudius with the poisoned foil then forces him to drink the equally poisonous goblet, making sure he dies before he passes on.
-   In _Heathers_, Veronica is completely willing to die if it's going to prevent all of the students of Westerberg from being blown to smithereens by JD, but she's taking him down along with her.
    
    "And there's your final bell!"  
    "It's one more dance and then farewell!"  
    "Cheek to cheek in hell with a dead girl walking!"
    
-   _Jekyll & Hyde_: During "Confrontation", Jekyll threatens Hyde with this and follows through at the end of the show.
    
    **Jekyll**: If I die, you die too.
    
-   Directly invoked by Enjolras and the other revolutionaries in _Les Misérables_; when they realize that no one is coming to help them and that they are going to die, they promise to "make them bleed while we can". Given how quickly they go down, they likely weren't too successful.
-   In _Pokémon Live!_, MechaMew2 tries to do this to Giovanni; sadly, the Rocket boss escapes before it blows up.
-   Camille Saint-Saëns' opera _Samson et Dalila_ ends the same way as the Biblical legend, with Samson bringing down the temple on himself and the entire Philistine cast.

    Theme Parks 

-   At the Universal Studios parks:
    -   In _Transformers: The Ride_, when Megatron is about to fall off a building to his doom, he pulls the riders down them with him, though Bumblebee saves them at the last second.
    -   During the climax of _Waterworld: A Live Sea War Spectacular_, after which the Deacon is set on fire, he attempts to knock the Mariner over the edge of the Atoll with him, but hilariously misses and plunges to his doom. Sometimes, he'll even say the trope word-for-word.

    Toys 

-   _BIONICLE_: In "The Kingdom" Alternate Universe, the Teridax of that world absorbs Matoro into himself, but Matoro is able to kill them both before he can kill Takanuva.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Fate/stay night_:
    -   The final choice you make in Unlimited Blade Works route is as follows: After beating the Big Bad up, a sphere of nothingness begins to swallow him up. He throws out a chain and grabs Shirou; the choices are "try and break free" or "take him down with me". Picking the second one leads to a Bad End. This choice is so _obviously_ dumb that once the Tiger Dojo starts up, it begins with Taiga beating a Super-Deformed Shirou. They then use it to hint towards a way to get the Good End of the route, due to them likely assuming that since the right decision is so obvious that the only reasons someone would do the wrong is is curiosity after beating the route.
        -   Just before this moment, there's a subversion when Gilgamesh grabs Shirou with his chain. Shirou _assumes_ that Gilgamesh is trying to pull this trope on him, but Gil is quick to tell him to stay right where he is so that he can pull himself out of the aforementioned sphere of nothingness.
    -   Also in Unlimited Blade Works, Lancer kills Kotomine, stabs Shinji, frees Rin and sets fire to the castle even after being stabbed by Gae Bolg. Justified because one of his abilities is called Battle Continuation; it allows the user to continue fighting even at the verge of death.
    -   Heavens Feel has one too in Shirou's fight with Saber Alter if you don't bring Rider along. Shirou kills himself to stop her, to let Tohsaka proceed without interference. Taiga and Ilya in the Dojo are a bit troubled because they can't really call it a bad end due to beating Saber in a one on one fight, which is pretty damn badass.
    -   And in the manual on The Dead Apostle Ancestors, El Nahat seems to have this as his shtick. Blowing himself up to kill an enemy. The Church has captured him and turned his stomach into a weapon.
-   _Majikoi! Love Me Seriously!_ has Cookie, the robot, who gets ensnared in several ropes against class S in the Kawakami War. As a last-ditch move, he releases his remaining energy to shock the students holding the ropes, then shuts down.
-   The Safe Ending in _Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors_ features Snake taking SIX bullets from Ace while the incinerator they are trapped in is about to burn them all to death. He STILL has enough strength to keep Ace inside while the others get away...
-   In one ending of _War: 13th Day_, the two surviving Valkyrie try to take down as many of the Vi before ultimately meeting their demise. Their deaths inspire the other clans to unite against the tyrants and overthrow them. However, this is revealed to be a false ending by your Unreliable Narrator.

    Web Animation 

-   _Gaming All-Stars_: Andross utters his “If I go down, I’m taking you with me!” line from _Star Fox 64_ in _The Ultimate Crossover_ and _Remastered_ when Mario, Sonic, and Crash prepare their combined Final Smash attacks against him just before the moon explodes.
-   _Power Star_: During the ending, after he is puppeteered by the boos to kill everyone in the Mushroom Kingdom, Mario is given a short amount of time to examine the damage that was done while he was under their possession. Suffice to say, this gives the mustachioed plumber an opportunity to commit suicide, knowing that doing so will deprive the boos of a physical vessel and therefore destroying the demons themselves in the process.
-   This is attempted a couple of times in _DEATH BATTLE!_, where one fighter, knowing they're done for, try to bring down their opponent (or one of their opponents in one instance) with them. So far, none of these have fully worked.
    -   The first real attempt at this is made in Terminator vs. RoboCop, when RoboCop inadvertently ruptures the Terminator's fuel cells, the Terminator attempts to use this to essentially self-destruct to kill RoboCop. However, Murphy straps the Terminator to his jetpack and launches it off, making enough distance between the two combatants so that Murphy does not get caught in the blast.
    -   In Godzilla vs. Gamera, Gamera attempts to self-destruct in an attempt to take Godzilla down. However, Godzilla pushes Gamera skywards with its Red Spiral Breath, which also breaks through Gamera's shell and kills the turtle kaiju.
    -   In the Mega Man Battle Royale, the classic Mega Man attempts to do this to Mega Man X, dragging him into the black hole they and two other combatants made. He does succeed in dragging X into the black hole along with him, though while Classic dies to this, X's core survives and he regenerates, albeit with his Ultimate Armor destroyed.
    -   The latest attempt at this was made in Genos vs. War Machine. As War Machine blasts him through the chest with his Unibeam, Genos attempts to self-destruct to kill War Machine, even saying this trope verbatim. War Machine comes out unscathed, however, and promptly crushes the only thing remaining of Genos- his head.
        
        **Genos**: Not yet! I'm taking you with me!!
        
-   In ModnarYug's "Sylveon use explosion-mist" animation, a female Sylveon uses the titular move against a Gardevoir. This consists of Sylveon swelling up like an overinflated pool toy until she explodes in a cloud of mist. She's left unscathed (albeit exhausted) and the Gardevoir's fainted.

    Webcomics 

-   Played for laughs in _Dubious Company_. Tiren, the heroes' only fighter, is being beaten by Marty. Walter grabs him and jumps off the airship. Tiren and Sue both jump after their respective definitely not boyfriend. Tiren forgot Walter can fly, he grabs her. Sue's sister ends up saving the other two. The rest of the cast are stunned by the stupidity, except Sal.
-   The Crap Golems of _Erfworld_ seem to be designed for this kind of tactic, accompanied by what can only be described as a Moment of Awesome in Unsound Effects.
    -   In this strip, Bogroll succeeds so amazingly that he levels. Twice. Before being killed so hard that even Wanda and an Arkentool can't bring him back.
-   Damien from _El Goonish Shive_ tries to do one of these to Grace when he realizes he might not be a god. It doesn't work though, partly because Grace is fireproof, but mostly due to some good ol' Deus ex Machina.
    -   Later on, Pandora violates immortal law by killing an aberration to save one of her descendants. When an immortal violates immortal law, every other immortal automagically links to the offender and sends energy to force the offender to "reset". Pandora can't prevent that (she's powerful, but not _that_ powerful), but before she is reset she is able to briefly reverse the link and send her own energies down it, forcing every single immortal to manifest on the physical plane and cast a massively powerful aberration-destroying spell. Better than 99% of the planet's aberrations are wiped from the world in a single blast.
-   _The Non-Adventures of Wonderella_: Wonderella is planning to do this to _everyone_, by arranging to have sarin gas pumped into the room where her Video Will is viewed, as seen in this strip. (Fortunately, at least Rita, who records it, now knows not to show up.)
-   Sepulchritude, _Problem Sleuth_'s ultimate attack, which is deployed to take out the Demonhead Mobster Kingpin. Problem Sleuth lives.
    -   A recurring theme for _Ms Paint Adventures_, as in _Homestuck_ beta-timeline Calliope dies destroying the Green Sun and the outer ring. At the same time, Vriska uses the Juju to fight Lord English. She may have survived, but if she didn't, she died fighting the way she always did.
-   _Sleepless Domain_: When Cassidy realizes Goops has distracted her and gotten her killed her last act is to scream and put her last bit of energy into stabbing Goops through the eye, and kill the monster that ultimately killed her. This doesn't actually kill Goops, but she tried.
-   In the "Oceans Unmoving" arc of _Sluggy Freelance_, Bun-bun pulls this against his nemesis Blacksoul (who's trying to capture him for an unknown purpose), detonating a grenade that launches them both into the timeless waters below into what everyone knows means certain doom. "You're not taking me with you, I'm taking you with me."
-   Ren from _Tower of God_ sent the "Bull" after Bam after Yuri has him beaten to death.

    Web Original 

-   The Evil Overlord List advises **against** doing this.
-   _KateModern: Precious Blood_: "If it's the end for me, I hope you realise I'm the kind of vindictive bastard that's gonna take as many people with him as I can."
-   _The Angry Video Game Nerd_ at the end of his "Crazy Castle" review. Woody Woodpecker intends to blow the Nerd up with a bomb, but the Nerd grabs him and holds him in place.
    
    "I don't give a fuck, I'm taking you with me! So you like to play with bombs, huh? Well, BOMBS AWAY, YOU WOODY BUNNY FUCKING PECKER PIECE OF SHIT!"
    
-   Premier Jacade in _Darwin's Soldiers: Card of Ten_ blows up Planet Gaman and everyone on it (including himself) to stop the rebels from taking power from him.
-   Lord Slug tells Goku this in _Lord Slug Abridged_.
-   At the very end of _Dream's_ Minecraft Manhunt grand finale, Sapnap tries to kill Dream as a last-ditch effort by exploding a bed next to him. Sapnap thought blowing up the bed would either blow up the dragon (killing it before Dream could), or kill Dream himself. Both possibilities would result in the hunters winning. What happened instead was that the game gave the "Free the End" achievement to Dream (meaning that no matter what really happened the proof was in Dream's favor), and the bed only blew up Sapnap.
-   _The Fire Never Dies_: This was the White strategy at the Battle of Chesapeake Bay after their fleet was detected by the Reds. With no serious hope of escape or survival, they used suicidal tactics against the Reds, hoping to at least take as many ships with them as they could, succeeding in sinking the battleships _Texas_ and _New York_.
-   The character Riot Breaker in The Guildhall D&D podcast. Notably, he's used this strategy _twice_, somehow managing to survive both attempts. The first time was against a robotic dragon that, if not for his (attempted) Heroic Sacrifice would have killed the party almost definitely. The second time, a dawning realization of just how badly he'd messed up pushed him beyond the Despair Event Horizon, and as a result, he intended to drag the villain into the murky depths with him.
-   Parodied in _Kickassia_, when The Nostalgia Critic makes clear early on that if the others try to overthrow him, he'll blow up Kickassia and everyone in it (including himself) with twenty tons of dynamite, then later on tries to do just that. Pity that The Cinema Snob disconnected the dynamite when he got exiled.
-   In _Look to the West_, Fox does this to Hoche.
-   In Spoony's review of the failed 70s _Captain America_ pilot, he sent a copy to The Nostalgia Critic (who hanged himself) and invited Linkara on the show just to waste his time.
    
    _"If I have to suffer, I'm taking every one of you bastards with me."_
    
-   In the finale of _Red vs. Blue: Revelation_, as the Meta is being dragged to his death by a Warthog jeep over a cliff, he grabs Grif along the way down. Sarge starts delivering a eulogy even after Tucker suggests that maybe Grif caught a branch on the way down. He did... in the form of embedding the Meta's Brute Shot's blade into the side of the cliff and "dangling on the job again I see" as Sarge puts it.
-   _The Ruins of an American Party System_ has a purely unintentional example. When Huey Long votes for the Civil Rights Act as a final political act before killing himself to avoid jail time for corruption, the shock causes his ideological rival Governor Eugene Talmadge to drop dead of a heart attack.
-   Melina Frost from _Survival of the Fittest_ kills Beth Vanallen this way. After the latter stabbed another almost fatally and left her to die in quicksand, the former grabbed hold of her hair in her last act and dragged Beth under with her, killing them both.
-   _Whateley Universe_: This is the reason for the Star Stalker's creation, on a cosmic scale: if the invading Elder Gods couldn't be stopped, the Destroyer's mission was to destroy **everything**, in all dimensions, everywhere. Sara has refrained from explaining this to Billie for the sake of her sanity.

    Western Animation 

-   Used in the _Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers_ episode "Smuggler's Gauntlet." The antagonist of the episode stole some high-end Psycho Serum, and the Rangers are sent out to retrieve it. They break into the antagonist's hideout and are surrounded by mooks. Queue Zachary activating a neuron bomb capable of wiping out _all life_ in a city block's radius and threatening to detonate it unless the antagonist backs down. Goose may have the Cowboy Cop reputation, but push Zach, and he proves to be crazier.
-   _The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius_: In the climax of "The Trouble With Clones" after Jimmy stops Earth from fading into oblivion, Evil Jimmy breaks the Dark Matter Power Chip used to create the Evil Earth which sucks everyone and everything on it into the dark matter dimension, wanting to trap Jimmy with them. Fortunately, Jimmy manages to escape.
-   _Amphibia_: In "Anne-sterminator", the Cloak-bot has only a few seconds winding down on its self-destruct and is about to blow up, which will not only kill Anne, but also her parents and the Plantars. The resulting explosion is so strong that Anne had to tap into her Super Mode and kick the assassin into Earth's orbit so it can blow up safely.
    -   This is also the Core's final gambit after the invasion is thwarted. After ending up trapped in Darcy's helmet, it flies to the moon with the intention of ramming it into Amphibia in a final desperate attempt to get the stones, and if it means destroying itself in the process, so be it. Sasha summarizes this as it being a giant Sore Loser.
-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_:
    -   At least some of the Technical Pacifist Air Nomads fought back against the super-powered firebenders before the genocide was completed. Aang finds the skeleton of his mentor Gyatso next to a _pile_ of enemy corpses.
    -   "The Boiling Rock, Part 2" has the warden telling the guards to cut the gondola our heroes are using to escape, with him still in it. It seems he's really _that_ obsessed with keeping a no-escape record. (On top of that, what's below the gondola? _Boiling_ water. The episode is named after The Alcatraz of the setting, and it got its name by being _in the crater of a volcano,_ dormant but with magma near enough to the surface to make sure the water that surrounds the facility is _boiling._ Which means to be sure he gets the heroes, he is willing to suffer one of the most horrifically agonizing deaths imaginable.)
-   In the _Batman: The Animated Series_ episode "Harlequinade", the Joker plots to level Gotham City with a nuclear bomb. When it's clear that his plan is going to fail due to Batman's interference, he aims the gun turret of the plane he planned to escape with on the bomb, vowing that, "That bomb's going to go off even if I go with it!" Fortunately, he doesn't succeed.
-   This was the main goal of the Highbreed in _Ben 10: Alien Force_, but on a universal scale. They believed themselves to be superior to all other lifeforms, and after they rendered themselves sterile through generations of inbreeding, they couldn't stand the thought of being outlived by "lesser" races and decided that they wouldn't die alone.
-   _Big City Greens_: In the climax of "Chipocalypse Now", when Chip Whistler has been banned from Big City, he furiously tries to kill Cricket and his family (and by extension, everyone who stuck up for them) with his chopper. Also in the same episode, when Gloria is fired from her job at the Wholesome Foods Mega-Store, she drags the bouncer who fired her down the garbage chute with her.
-   A less direct version in _Castlevania_. The Judge of Lindenfeld tricks his killer into falling into a spike pit by telling him that it's an escape route being given as a sort of villain's dying grace.
-   Captain Marcus tries to do this in episode 11 of _Exo Squad_, after his attempt to liberate Earth just results in catastrophic defeat. Subverted in that he fails: the _Resolute_ is destroyed before it can ram Phaeton's flagship.
-   In the straight-to-DVD _Futurama_ movie _Bender's Big Score_, Lars, knowing that he's doomed to die eventually, presses Nudar and himself to the duplicate Bender, which was about to self-destruct. His video will reveals that he was actually a duplicate Fry, and wanted to die doing something useful (neatly wrapping up all the movie's loose ends) instead of causing Leela the pain of dying unexpectedly.
-   _Gargoyles_: Demona and Macbeth had a curse placed on them that made them both immortal. The only way either one can die is through the use of this trope, i.e. one must kill the other, which will result in both of their deaths.
-   _Infinity Train_: After he's sheared in two by a passing train car, Agent Mace realizes he's as good as dead and spends his last moments trying to drag MT with him into a set of train wheels because he's just that obsessed with completing his mission. Unfortunately for him, his injuries make it easy for MT to overpower him and shove him into the wheels alone, shredding him to pieces.
-   _Justice League_:
    -   In "Only a Dream", Copperhead tries to escape by jumping onto Hawkgirl's back and threatening to bite her with his poison fangs unless she gives him a ride. She simply flies a few hundred feet straight up and points out that if he bites her now, they'll both die.
    -   In the Grand Finale "Destroyer", Lex Luthor sacrifices himself to defeat Darkseid by gifting him with the Anti-Life Equation, which traps them both within the Source Wall for eternity.
-   _The Legend of Korra_:
    -   Lin Beifong attempts this in "Turning The Tides" when she orders Tenzin to go on without her as she attacks the airships, leaving her to go down with them. In a Double Subversion, she fails to take down the second one, although she manages to stop their pursuit of Tenzin and his family.
    -   Bumi the 2nd tries this with a dark spirit, hurling both himself and the spirit off a Sky Bison. Bumi lives.
    -   In "Venom of the Red Lotus", Ghazan chooses this over going back to prison — and collapses a cave on himself, Bolin and Mako. They make it out, he doesn't.
    -   In "The Battle of Zaofu", Varrick, of all people, tries to do this to the people holding him captive. He manages to blow up the train, preventing Kuvira from getting the spirit vine technology, and only lives because Bolin saved them both.
-   In _March of the Dinosaurs_, the _Albertosaurus_ tackles the old bull _Edmontosaurus_, biting down on his neck. During their fight, both dinosaurs come towards a cliff, about to fall off to their deaths. Similar to both Sharptooth and the carnotaur, except that while both of the above failed to take their prey (Petrie and Aladar) down with them, the Albertosaurus _SUCCEEDED_.
-   _ReBoot_ played with this trope and subverted it and eventually pretended it never happened. Big Bad Megabyte is trapped in a Room101 by Bob in an early episode (though Bob later becomes retconned into a Technical Pacifist), and so Megs uses the last of his strength to self destruct himself using a panel on his forearm that appears to be a Shout-Out to _Predator_. His chamber of doom is ejected into orbit to keep him from destroying everything. Even though Bob would never do something like this later in the series, and Megabyte turned a sickly black blotch as he prepared to kaboom, the chamber lands on the outskirts of Mainframe and we see Megabyte's fist punch through the chamber door in a Finger-Twitching Revival (well, by his standards).
    -   The supervirus Daemon has this as her entire purpose. She infects the entire Net and once her personal clock runs out she self-destructs and in sixty seconds everything infected by her gets destroyed as well.
-   _Regular Show_ ends with Pops using his recently mastered positive energy powers to suppress the negative powers of his Evil Twin, Anti-Pops, and hurl both of them into a nearby star, killing them both and ending an until-then infinitely recurring cycle of the two destroying the universe with their conflicts.
-   _Sealab 2021_: In "The Policy", Murphy pulled this off when Sparks tried electrocuting him for the insurance money: he got close enough to Sparks to electrocute him as well. There seems to be no hard feelings between the two, as they both sit in hell casually comparing punishments.
-   _Shadow Raiders_: Planets Fire's engines begin to fail, making it unable to outrun the Beast Planet. The Grand Vizier then turns the planet around and crashes it into the Beast Planet, hoping to take out the Beast in a suicide attack. The Beast Planet survives unharmed.
-   _Spider-Man: The Animated Series_: In "The Alien Costume, Part 3," Spider-Man tries to defeat Venom by luring him to the launch site of a NASA rocket. He intends to use the roar of the rocket to force the symbiote off Eddie Brock and then to web the symbiote to the rocket. The plan works perfectly, but Spidey was prepared to go this way if it didn't.
    
    "Hope this launch doesn't fry my molecules, but if I'm gonna go, at least I'll take him with me."
    
-   _Star Trek: Lower Decks_:
    -   "Crisis Point": The holographic Mariner allows Vindicta to beat her up as a distraction until the ship's self-destruct kills them both.
    -   "No Small Parts": When Badgey is uploaded onto the Pakled ship, he activates the self-destruct so he can kill Rutherford too, even at the cost of his own existence.
-   _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_:
    -   "Rookies": A seriously injured rookie clone trooper sets off explosives that destroy himself, the battle droids cornering him _and_ the installation they were on.
        
        **Battle Droid:** Do we take prisoners?  
        **Hevy:** I... don't. _\[detonates explosives\]_
        
    -   "A Test of Strength": A non-lethal example occurs at the end. Just as Ahsoka manages to close off the boarding bridge between the Jedi corvette _Crucible_ and the pirate ship _Acushnet_, a pirate being sucked back into the latter ends up crashing into her and sending her tumbling with him back to his ship, where she is promptly captured by Hondo.
-   _Star Wars Rebels_: In the finale, "Family Reunion and Finale", with no other way to defeat Grand Admiral Thrawn, and having left his lightsaber at ground level with the other rebels, Ezra Bridger, having just broken free aboard Thrawn's _Chimaera_, resorts to cornering him at the _Chimaera_'s bridge and using the Force to summon large purgill to capture the ship and whisk it away into hyperspace, into an unknown, distant region of the galaxy. This ensures that Thrawn's Imperial forces will never threaten Lothal again, but also sacrifices Ezra's chance to live a free life on his home planet or continue his time with the Spectres during their fight against the Empire.
-   _Steven Universe_: In "Jail Break", Jasper tries to convince Lapis Lazuli to fuse with her to destroy the Crystal Gems by reminding her of the way they mistreated her. Lapis goes through with it and they form Malachite, but Lapis, fed up with being a prisoner (first in a mirror, then on Jasper and Peridot's ship), uses her powers to shackle them together and drag them both down to the bottom of the sea.
    
    **Lapis:** I'm done being everyone's prisoner. Now you're **MY** prisoner. And I'm never letting you go! Let's stay on this miserable planet _TOGETHER!_
    
-   An episode of _TaleSpin_ has Rebecca tell Baloo, "I'm going insane! And I'm taking you with me!".
-   _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)_: The turtles' Triceraton ally Zog does this to the Shredder by keeping him immobile inside an exploding ship. While he succeeds in his intention of giving the turtles enough time to escape, the Shredder survives, while he himself...doesn't.
    -   Villainous example: 2K3 Shredder in _Turtles Forever_ made up his mind to end it this way by ending all of existence if only so he could destroy the TMNTs from Turtle Prime/the original Mirage comic.
-   In the _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)_ episode "Metalhead Rewired", Metalhead does this. After holding a portal open in order to allow all the mutants to escape (turtles included), Metalhead lets the Kraang all pile onto him and then self-destructs by exploding. Also earlier in the series, in the episode "The Gauntlet", when the Turtles have Xever and Bradford surrounded, Bradford mentions this trope just before stabbing the Mutagen bomb, spilling mutagen on himself and Xever and washing them off the balcony.
-   _Transformers_:
    
    -   Done interestingly in _Transformers: Armada_. Megatron knows that if he and Optimus Prime both live, the war will restart and Unicron will be revived. He ends their final battle by allowing himself to be sucked into the space vortex, even shiving Optimus' hand when he tries to stop his fall.
    -   He does it _again_ at the end of the next season, _Transformers: Energon._ The fledgling new universe is powered by a 'sun' made of Super Energon and the head of Unicron. Unicron's spark has entered him, but when he realizes he's being used, he enters the Super Energon sun, apparently vaporizing himself, so that Unicron won't return; if Unicron really is alive, there'll be no escaping its gravity. Interestingly, _Megatron_ returns for _Transformers: Cybertron,_ with spiffy new Unicron based armor but _not_ that of Noble Demon-ness that makes him the kind of guy who'd sacrifice himself for the universe.
    -   In _Cybertron,_ Unicron does this in a way. The balance of good and evil is disrupted with Unicron gone, so a giant black hole that could consume The Multiverse has formed. If it's not stopped, Unicron will basically have taken all reality with him.
    -   The two-part premiere of _Transformers: Beast Wars_ had Megatron transforming to robot mode and risking fatal Energon exposure, in order to blow up Optimus Primal. Neither character dies.
