_"Giving a reader a sex scene that is only half right is like giving her half of a kitten. It is not half as cute as a whole kitten; it is a bloody, godawful mess."_

Sometimes sexy things happen in a show. Sometimes they're not entirely intended that way, but end up being made out as such.

Sometimes the setup is there but something kills it. Replacing a love scene's music with _Entry of the Gladiators_ circus music will rapidly turn something appealing into something bizarre, absolutely wrecking any gratification the viewer might get out of it.

The writer might not realize that their knowledge of the reproductive system is limited at best. Or the exotic elements could just be overwhelmed by good ol' fashioned Nightmare Fuel. It's important to remember, however, that there is no such thing as _complete_ Fetish Retardant, because if it exists, somebody will find it arousing in spite of any efforts to make it unappealing.

Subtropes include No Yay, IKEA Erotica, and Mills and Boon Prose.

Fetish Retardant applies only when the unsexiness is entirely unintended, perhaps making something like a sexual Narm moment. If the retarding is something added in _on purpose_ to keep the scene from being sexy, that's Fan Disservice (though this can backfire spectacularly).

Inherently Funny Words and Unusual Euphemisms are major causes of Fetish Retardant in written erotica. Written Sound Effects often combine the two.

Contrast Rule of Sexy (although it can become this when it fails). When this is inverted, it's Think Unsexy Thoughts. Naturally, these are Subjective, so there's no need to keep contesting entries; just bring them over to Fetish Fuel.

_**Any**_ attempt to introduce actual rules for sexual acts in roleplaying games falls under this, chiefly due to the sheer awkwardness of roleplaying sexual encounters with close friends.

This happens to quite a bit of fanfic for various reasons. IKEA Erotica, creepy/weird euphemisms, Anatomically Impossible Sex, spelling mistakes that add fuel to the Narm fire, or just the Fridge Horror that sets in when you realize you're reading porn about a children's cartoon. Especially if the characters being fetishized are children.

In Video Games, most eroge/visual novel translations suffer from severely mood-breaking onomatopoeias. Fellatio simply should NOT make the sound "chap chap chap".

When this happens In-Universe, it's a kind of Moment Killer.

Fetish Retardant is accidental by definition; when it's planned, that's Fan Disservice. If this trope happens right from the get-go, expect an Audience-Alienating Premise. It should be noted that this trope is based _entirely_ on opinion, as what some people regard as a turn-off might end up being a turn-on for others, depending on how they see it.

## Examples:

    Advertisement 

-   A Carl Jr's ad depicting Miss Turkey... wearing a bikini... depicting their burgers... on close-up. Rather tacky, since the little burgers make what she's wearing look like Goofy Print Underwear.
-   The Mature Dating site ads. While it's clear that there is a target audience, for many people seeing a woman their mother's age in sexy poses is pure Squick.
-   A Virgin Airlines ad featured Sassy Black Woman ordering a Mexican wrap. Said wrap appeared as an attractive naked Latin man in a tortilla. Yeah, showing a woman wanting to get down with anthropomorphized burrito is supposed to make us _want_ to ride their airlines.
-   The gay dating... okay, hook-up site Adam4Adam heavily features porn ads to keep it free. Most of the ads are pleasing to the eye (even when the scenarios are silly, at least the models are hot), except for those that promote a pornographic cartoon site. It's fair to assume that most people can happily live their lives without ever seeing their favorite cartoon characters having graphic sex. This is a very common trope on adult sites, both gay and straight, with cartoon porn ads (or extremely extreme real porn ads) being often fetish retardants.
-   The later Confused.com insurance adverts with Cara Confused — an anthropomorphic female version of the company's original logo — make her breasts noticeably more defined and bouncy, and would often have her and her best friend stripping down to bikinis for plugging holiday insurance. Keep in mind that the character had a very cartoony head (complete with wiggly black lines for hair) atop a semi-realistic human body, which made it come off as a lot more weird than attractive.

    Anime and Manga 

-   The _Zetsuai (1989)_ OAVs have an... _odd_ art style, especially for the supposed Bishōnen gay men who end up having spider-leg fingers and chins so pointy they could be used as weapons. Just take a look at the picture shown in this review and decide if you'd find _that_ sexy. ("When you're screaming at the screen for the bishōnen to put his shirt back ON, you know there's something wrong.")
-   _GaoGaiGar FINAL_ really ramped up the Fanservice, but many felt it tried too hard and just felt extremely out of place and weird, especially with everything regarding Pilnus. The fact that the original series never really went that far with its fanservice doesn’t help.
-   Some have this reaction to the Fanservice involving women in _One Piece_, mainly because they feel Eiichiro Oda's very unconventional and oddly proportioned art style causes it to not really work. This is much more prevalent with the anime than the manga, with the former exaggerating the proportions even more and having far more Male Gaze, particularly from the Fishman Island arc and onwards.
-   After a certain point, the bouncing breasts in the anime adaptation of _Umineko: When They Cry_ get so exaggerated and omnipresent that it starts to feel more tasteless then sexy, especially when the plot begins to get darker but the characters’ breasts still bounce around wildly.
-   Yaoi example: _Kizuna_. Enjouji, PLEASE take off your socks before having sex with Ranmaru, okay?
-   Many yaoi fans/readers find the story of _Okane ga Nai_ too brutal/horrifying to be sexy in any way. Not to mention that the Off-Model art makes the uke look about _twelve_ years old (he's supposed to be eighteen) and some panels make his head look smaller than his captive/rapist's hand.
-   Mayu Shinjo's rather...special art style in _Sensual Phrase_, _Haou Airen_, _Love Celeb_ and _Akuma na Eros_. Not only do the sex scenes look waaaaay too rape-like for comfort (whether they are or not), but the Only Six Faces syndrome hits _hard_. And those _chins_, man - you could use the lead males' chins as _knives_... And we're not even mentioning the guys' huge _hands_ that sometimes are bigger than the girls' whole _heads_.
-   The fanservice in _Pokémon RéBURST_ tends to be ruined by having the characters in downright bizarre “sexual” poses that make them look misshapen and deformed. You begin to wonder if the manga is set in an Alternate Universe where humans don’t have bones.
-   _Eiken_ is one of the more infamous examples, with inhumanly large breasts on _underage girls_ and breast bounce so extreme that it's uncanny. The sexual imagery and innuendo are often accused of being so heavy-handed and clumsily executed that it somehow manages to warp into pure Nausea Fuel.
-   A common criticism of _Puella Magi Kazumi Magica_. Its progenitor series knew to keep the fanservice to a relative minimum once the plot started getting Darker and Edgier, which makes the Stripperific outfits, Censor Steam\-laden Transformation Sequences, and the protagonist's unusual tendency to wind up nude feel more awkward than anything when it’s all jammed into a very dark and serious story.
-   _Ro-Kyu-Bu!_ has a lot of lolicon fanservice, that many found more distasteful then appealing, especially with scenes involving Airi (a tall, busty _sixth-grader_ often used for fanservice).
-   _Junjou Romantica_ turned "Yaoi Hands" into a minor meme. Though the character's hands aren't quite as big as some of the derivatives, they're big enough that it becomes very noticeable and very disconcerting.
-   This is a major criticism of _Cage of Eden_: Panty shots and Clothing Damage? Hot. On girls who are dead/dying/in serious danger, all of it played completely seriously? _Creepy_. After a while, the manga starts to get kind of uncomfortable to read.
-   This is considered to be one of the reasons why _I Don’t Like You at All, Big Brother!!_ flopped, as the art style was too cartoonish and unappealing for a fanservice anime.
-   The transgender character, Momoko, from _Shangri-La_ was obviously intended to be a Ms. Fanservice character, but the fact that she’s voiced by Joji Nakata (who is well known for voicing badass and Masculine Anti-Hero characters) makes her come off as slightly creepy instead of sexy.
-   _Food Wars!_ is well-known for its "foodgasms", i.e. characters (mostly female characters) taking a bite of some sort of well-crafted dish and promptly going into orgasmic fits and screams, with imagery that would be not out of place in a hentai series (save for all vital parts remaining strategically covered). Some enjoy it and think it’s funny, others think it gets far too over-the-top and weird.
-   _Sgt. Frog_: The scene where Paul acquires the physical attributes of Aki flies straight into Nightmare Fuel territory.
-   _First Love Monster_ has lots of pretty, sexy Bishōnen... but _they're in elementary school_. And they mostly act their age, too. Unsurprisingly, the anime adaptation was a flop.
-   The way the fanservice is handled in _Fire Force_ has been a regular criticism of the series, especially since much of it tends to happen at inappropriate times and causes severe Mood Whiplash as a result. Tamaki in particular gets the worst of it, as her "Lucky Lecher Lure" constantly puts her in compromising situations regardless of whether or not the scene is meant to be comedic. Many viewers find her "Lucky Lecher Lure" a rather lame in-universe justification for her to constantly lose her clothing or have men faceplant into her chest, to the point that it stops being funny or titillating and just seems downright cruel.
-   In _My Sister, My Writer_, the Fanservice is supposed to be one of the series' main draws, but the anime goes Off-Model so often that any scene that attempts to be titillating usually ends up unintentionally hilarious thanks to how poorly drawn and animated the characters are.
-   _The Island of Giant Insects_ has plenty of young ladies showing off their voluptuous bodies...especially as they're eaten alive by giant bugs.
-   _Abunai Sisters_ has been criticized for its failed attempts at Fanservice. The titular sisters have exaggeratedly huge breasts which are more distracting than sexy, especially when combined with the low-quality 3D models and gratingly high-pitched voice acting. This makes it almost impossible for viewers to enjoy their looks, despite them constantly boasting about how beautiful they are.

    Comic Books 

-   An important health warning to anyone: women drawn by Rob Liefeld will make your genitals retreat into your pelvis and start building protective turrets. Unless, of course, you have a thing for women who use the pouches on their stomachs to digest food.
-   Comic artist Greg Horn, whose reputation is just as maligned as Rob Liefeld's — though his anatomy is better, in part because much of it is traced off of live-action porn. Most of his depictions of women either try too hard to be sexy or are just borderline offensive, like his infamous drawing featured Catwoman on all fours licking milk from a bowl,<small>◊</small> with her torso grotesquely stretched and bent so that her breasts are pushed out while her ass in the air. You know your reputation is bad when other artists in your field start making shots at your work.
-   It's commonly assumed that pretty much the only reason for _Catwoman: Guardian of Gotham_ and its squandered premise is to act as an excuse to draw Catwoman in skimpy outfits and sexy poses. Unfortunately for the comic, Catwoman's costume rivals the infamous 2004 film adaptation in the "trying too hard" department (including graduations leather corset-leotard and prominent boob-socks), and _all_ the female characters so frequently bend over in provocative poses with wonky spines that they end up being bizarrely distracting rather than titillating.
-   Guillem March's work on books like _Gotham City Sirens_ and _Catwoman_ can sometimes fall into this, since while he generally has a decent grasp of anatomy he sometimes really pushes it with the Fanservice. In particular, the end of the relaunch of _Catwoman_ has Batman and Selina going at it on a rooftop while still mostly in costume but the circumstances, including the fact that they no longer know each other's identities thanks to a Retcon, and Bruce's Questionable Consent made most fans of the pairing respond not with "Yes!" but rather "Do Not Want!"
-   _Red Hood and the Outlaws_: Spines don't bend that way!<small>◊</small> To others, Starfire's extreme emotional detachment towards her sexual partners, with the implication that this is meant to be portrayed for titillation rather than drama, is more than a little disturbing. Likewise, Starfire's Monochromatic Eyes, combined with her expressions and apparent disinterest make her look more than a little dead.
-   Silk's original costume was a skimpy little thing made out of her own organic webbing and was derided by most readers for trying too hard to be sexy. Nobody complained when her solo title swapped it out for a much more practical outfit. There's also the whole "pheromones" thing where she and Peter are compelled to have sex with each other, which was used to justify having them hook up, but readers found it to be more gross than arousing.
-   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: Mike Deodato's art of Artemis' beaten and bloody corpse with a suggestively arched back and clothing damage that just barely keeps her nipples covered is rather unsettling.
-   One of the major complaints levelled at _Heroes in Crisis_ is that artist Clay Mann's work, while normally excellent at the opposite trope, is a horrible fit for a grim murder mystery centred around trauma and mental health. The result is that many scenes have the female characters very distractingly sexualized despite taking about serious subjects, most infamously one where Batgirl shows off her old bullet wounds while her ass in full-view.

    Fanfiction 

-   The infamous _My Immortal_ Harry Potter fanfic, when the genitals are referred to as "thingy" and "you-know-what".
-   The notoriously awful _Lord of the Rings_ fanfic _Celebrian_ is _loaded_ with this. Even if you're someone who would actually be turned on by the story's Squicky sexual content, lines like "Oh, thank you, great-king-with-balls-of-fire, king-whose-great-rod-my-mouth-yearns-for." and "Very well, cock-sucker, suck-cock." are likely to cause a completely different reaction.
-   _Surprises of a Wedding Night_, a _Lord of the Rings_ fanfic, is about Aragorn experiencing such a surprise. Could be fanservice or fetish retardant (or just hilarious), and is disturbingly compatible with the Elfeminate trope, as male elves apparently lack certain attributes while female elves, well ... that's the _surprise_.
-   One _Hellsing_ fanfic (title unknown) was pretty good up until the point where Integra started wondering about Alucard's "one-eyed trouser snake". Narm in itself, _and_ completely out of character for Integra. The funny part is that it's a real-life euphemism, but becomes rather freakish when you take into account his powers. And his one-eyed trouser snake is probably a literal one-eyed trouser snake, considering Alucard's eye for Squicky humor.
-   Several Kirk/Spock Slash Fic Lemons mention that Spock's dick is green. Not limited to fanfics. Leonard Nimoy himself was asked if they were green. And yes, "they". Apparently, Vulcans have forked dicks. And not just _forked._ Vulcan green _tentacle_ cock has shown up on more than one occasion.
-   Zim/Dib often has the same issues as Kirk/Spock. And again, the phrase "trouser snake" is _not_ meant to be literal (so please, please don't describe Irken genitalia as being long, green, and writhing).
-   In _Light and Dark The Adventures of Dark Yagami_. "He was as a big as a bus and was wearing leather pants which dint hide his super big man thingy which was the size of a bus and twice as wide."
-   Every single sex scene in _My Inner Life_. Only surpassed by the "Bondage-ritual" scene, which is... Squick to the utmost.
-   _Forbiden Fruit: The Tempation of Edward Cullen_: Most of the fic. Special mention goes to Edward's "throbbing lavender man-fruit thing" and the scene where Jasper Cullen has sex with an apparently non-anthropomorphic panda.
-   Every adult-rated fanfic encountered by the Protectors of the Plot Continuum.
-   _Chocobo Nights_: Even assuming that there are people out there who enjoy the thought of Tifa being impregnated by a Chocobo, the terrible spelling renders it impossible to find this fic anything but either horrifying or funny.
    
    _"It's so furry!_"
    
-   _Rectified Anonymity_, otherwise known as "The Pokémon Story", starts off with a horrifying example of Pokémon rape, and just somehow _keeps getting worse_. You'll need a lot of Brain Bleach by the time you've finished.
-   Countless fanfics that emphasize that Bigger Is Better in Bed, and describe penetration as painful in order to show how "big" the character is. Ouch.
-   _Chibiusa's Seventh Birthday_, which, due to the author's lack of understanding of biology and constant misspellings, would be decidedly unsexy even if it _didn't_ revolve around graphic child sexual abuse.
-   A.A. Pessimal _began_ a story expanding on a one-line reference in Terry Pratchett's _Discworld_ to an undead Zombie stripper. She also engages in a romance with Watch zombie Reg Shoe. How might a zom-rom-com work out in practice? See here. _Stuck On You_ got stuck after two chapters as some details are too potentially horrible even for Pessimal.
-   _The Lion King 2 1/2_ (Also goes by _Everything The Light Touches_) is literally made of this from start to finish. Not only are there so many sex scenes that all of them combined _exceed the word count of a Lord of the Rings book_, but most of them concern... "interesting" scenarios, which includes three-ways, gang bangs, open infidelity, excessive amounts of "liquids", incest, orgies, or even _all of the above at the same time_. All described in truly excruciating detail with hardly anyone spared; every character-on-character combination you could imagine is included at some point or another, and it gets worse once Original Characters come in later on. In one case during a flashback, Simba was described to by graphically raping Vitani. This would be bad on its own, but what really drives it home is that he's doing it _in the middle of the second movie's climax_. The last we hear from any of the canon characters is Nala and Sarabi both getting pregnant from another pride's males, with the latter going to live with said pride to "feel wanted" for the rest of her days. Oddly enough, Kiara is spared from being pregnant, as you'd expect the amount of sex in this story to warrant her and Kovu "breeding" at some point or another. Ironically, the only canon couples in the fic are the ones that get the least amount of action together (whether that's a good thing or not is up to you).

-   Almost all of LiquidPhazon's fic has the main character mind-control other characters so that they would essentially become the main character's sex slave. It's intended to be romantic and sexy, but given the fact that they are forced against their will to be turned into slaves for their master, this ends up adding some implications that make the lemon scenes more creepy than sexy.
-   _The Worst Witch_ fanfic _Something Wicked This Way Comes_ involves non-consensual BDSM that's meant to be seen as attractive but just seems rapey.
-   In _Property of Luan Loud_, covered on _Peeking Through the Fourth Wall_, Leni is meant to be a Sexy Cat Person but instead she just comes across as a psycho who rapes _her own sister_.
-   _Blood Raining Night_'s "sex scenes" are described in bizarre and unappealing manners. Made worse in the fanime, which combines fanservice scenes with shoddy artwork. A great example from one chapter is "Her big fat breasts flooped as she ran into the door.".

    Films — Animated 

-   One of the most disliked elements in _Batman: The Killing Joke_ was the romance and eventual sex scene between Batman and Batgirl. Many found it to simply be a repulsive, out-of-character, and unnecessary Romantic Plot Tumor in a movie that _already_ had far too much filler.
-   _Foodfight!_: Lady X is ridiculously sexualized, but it's hard to be particularly attracted to her when she wears such bizarrely kinky outfits, is coming onto a canine with none too subtle innuendos, and, much like the rest of the cast, appears quite lifeless due to the poor animations.
-   _Ratatoing_: Carol is supposed to be the film's Ms. Fanservice, but the way she moves, the cheap CGI and animation, and the fact that she's a rat makes it fall flat.

    Films — Live-Action 

### **In General:**

-   Expect anything sexy in a movie being riffed on _Mystery Science Theater 3000_ to turn out this way. After all, if they weren't bad movies, they wouldn't be on the show.
    -   In _Space Mutiny_, a female character's prolonged suggestive dancing only nauseates Mike and the Bots ("She's presenting like a mandrill!"). Mostly because the woman looked to be possibly the oldest person in the cast... and the movie kept treating her like a sexy teenager. <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   In _The Screaming Skull,_ the complete lack of appeal in the movie's love scene prompts the line, "Flat, drab passion meanders aimlessly across the screen!"
    -   A movie called _Racket Girls_ had some of the ugliest women ever in it. As Crow said "My loins will never stir again"
    -   _Mitchell_. Baby oil.
    -   In _Hobgoblins_ Kyle obviously has some... unusual tastes in women. Considering the woman that appears in his Hobgoblin-induced fantasy looks old enough to be his mother, and her completely unsubtle come-ons are especially overdone.

### **By Movie:**

-   For many viewers, much of the sexual content in the first half of _365 Days_ comes off as either awkwardly hilarious or disturbing and creepy given that Laura is being held by Massimo against her will and is (initially) _not_ happy with the situation. The scene where Massimo randomly gets oral sex from an air hostess is also regarded as particularly narmy because of the actors' expressions and how out-of-nowhere it is.
-   In the remake of _Attack of the 50-Foot Woman_, Nancy Archer's wayward husband Harry makes a botched attempt on her life, which causes her to grow even larger than she already was, in turn causing the makeshift dress she had created for herself to rip in two and become much more revealing. However, this attempt at making her look sexier ends up being undermined by the film-makers for some reason giving Daryl Hannah some very exaggerated and unflattering '80s Hair at the same time, which just looks more weird and distracting than anything else.
-   _Blue Is the Warmest Color_: Many actual lesbians (including Jul Maroh themselves, the writer of the original comic) found the sex scenes laughably unrealistic, due to a combination of IKEA Erotica and Male Gaze. The general consensus is that, while it was still hot, it was obviously two straight girls doing a sex scene. The actresses have had numerous complaints about the overbearing and hard-to-please director, particularly in regards to said scenes. They've been reshot numerous times until the actresses were literally driven to tears, which certainly didn't bode well for convincing acting.
-   As Todd in the Shadows noted when reviewing _Body of Evidence_, in trying to follow _Basic Instinct_ the Michael Douglas analogue was Willem Dafoe, a not very arousing choice given he lacks similar good looks - Todd highlighted that any time he smiles, it just looks like a Slasher Smile.
-   If there was ever a film that tried so hard to be erotic and botched it up heavily (besides maybe _Showgirls_), it has to be _Caligula_. The movie throws so much outright pornographic content at the audience that it's easy to grow desensitized to it all, which is not helped that it's often juxtaposed with extreme gore and violence. The Porn with Plot elements were criticized as well, with many arguing that the focus on artsy drama killed much of the eroticism.
-   Burt Reynolds and Shirley Maclaine making out in the back seat in _Cannonball Run II_.
-   _Cats_ is one of the most infamous examples in modern history. This is a movie about anthropomorphic singing cats, yet it is also weirdly erotic and sexual _all the time_, and undermines that eroticism by plunging itself **deep** in the Unintentional Uncanny Valley. Gone are the simple but effective costumes/make-up and stylish dancing of the original stage show, replaced with motion capture CGI where the cats are basically human faces grafted onto cat bodies doing sexy poses and gyrating wildly. It's downright nauseating, and made even worse by some of the acting choices; ever wanted to see an eighty-year-old Ian McKellen bent over, drinking milk out of a bowl as if he's being forced to do pet-play BDSM? Unsurprisingly, the movie quickly came to be one of the biggest cinematic fiascos in recent times.
-   _Catwoman (2004)_ puts Halle Berry in a Stripperiffic version of the heroine's comic book outfit. But it's so skimpy it looks more like bondage gear, and thus it's slightly uncomfortable to look at. Additionally, Patience gets a radical makeover that gives her an unflattering hairstyle, too much make-up, and another black leather Spy Catsuit. Yes, the movie decided that Halle Berry needed a makeover.
-   Some feel that the character Holli Would from _Cool World_ is a bit oversexualized, to the point that it's a turn-off.
-   In _Die Another Day_'s opening theme, at one point Madonna moans in a seductive, sexy tone... _"Sigmund Freud"_. Anything else in that tone of voice could've been a fetish, but invoking Sigmund Freud, not so much.
-   _Disco Pigs_ managed to do this with Cillian Murphy, even when some thought that was impossible. We're just accepting Murphy (then 24) as a teenage boy, then he's shirtless. Ooh, drool. And heartbreakingly smitten with his female best friend. But then he goes into a ridiculously long monologue about his best friend, describing how he wants to be with her in rather graphic sexual terms, and she looks so cute and innocent and young and actually 16 in her nightie and he suddenly looks really old... Of course, some girls loved it. However, many people had the same reaction as above - there is even artwork to prove it.
-   _Epic Movie_ does an intentional version of this. In the sex scene with Mystique, while shapeshifting into whatever Peter wants, she at first gets a bigger breast size and bigger ass size. This is a sexy scenario which would be a wonderful sight for any guy. She then gains a monobrow and "big flabby grandma arms/bingo wings". Then it's suddenly not as sexy...
    
    **Peter:** _\[drooling\]_ Now that's what I'm talking about...  
    _\[cut to a fat Mystique flapping her flabby arms\]_  
    **Peter:** ...Come here!  
    _\[It zooms in on her cross-eyed monobrowed face as she wiggles her tongue. Peter pulls her down and they start to get it on\]_
    
-   All of the victims in _Exterminator City_ are nubile young women, most of them portrayed by adult film stars. Unfortunately, many of them have either misshapen or just grotesquely oversized breasts, undoubtedly due to cheap and/or botched cosmetic surgery.
    
    **Ben Platt:** This movie made me actually mad at both big breasts and nudity.
    
-   In the Australian romantic movie _The Heartbreak Kid_ (not to be confused with the 1972 film of the same name or its 2007 remake), when the much-anticipated sex scene comes along the music they choose to play is _Lacrimosa_ from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's _Requiem Mass_. Funeral music? Not so sexy... unless you're an UberGoth, that is.
-   _Howling II: Stirba: Werewolf Bitch_: The werewolf orgy that Stirba initiates and takes part in. If they were all fully human it would just be straight fanservice, and if they were full wolves having sex it would probably be as banal as something out of the Discovery channel. However, because they're partially transformed it looks like some bizarre furry fantasy.
-   _The Jacket_ has a sex scene between Adrien Brody and Keira Knightley. The former is a mental patient and the latter is a functioning alcoholic - so they're both quite thin.
-   _Ken Park_ seemingly goes out of its way to make the sex scenes as gross and unpleasant as possible. Some of this is intentional, but more often than not it's unintentional. Even Shawn and Rhonda's sex scene, the most "normal" in the film (in the sense that it doesn't involve anything abusive or paraphiliac), has a distinctly unsexy vibe to it. It's not at all helped by the fact the majority of them are unsimulated, including Shawn and Rhonda's.
-   _Killer Klowns from Outer Space_: At one point the Terenzi brothers find themselves in a ball pit on the alien ship and are accosted by two female klowns with expanding boobs. However, while poking fun at the Boldly Coming trope (when the brothers return, they are covered in kisses), the female klowns are depicted using the same unsettling human-but-not-quite prosphetics as the male klowns, and of course, clown make-up which distorts their features even further.
-   Many people believe the Neo/Trinity sex scene in _The Matrix Reloaded_ was not sexy _at all_, but instead horrendously out-of-place and a little bit gross, despite being juxtaposed with a borderline orgy scene. The fact that it's actually pretty hard to tell which of them is which may be a factor. The whole cave orgy scene can be Fetish Retardant, too. Even with their future technology, the Zionites are forced to live on bare subsistence level because of the ongoing Robot War, with hygiene somewhere at the bottom of their priorities.
-   In _The Piano_, people were treated to more of Harvey Keitel than they ever wanted to see.
-   The infamous sex scenes in _Quest for Fire_ are more cringe-inducing than sexy. Which, to be fair, is realistic given that the characters are primitive, apelike cavemen. Ron Perlman summed it up pretty well; "There's not a lot of foreplay, it's just (\*_obscene grunting_\*)."
-   Tommy Wiseau's _The Room (2003)_ gave us numerous incredibly long and awkward sex scenes. The less said about Wiseau's bottom, the better. It doesn't help that Johnny appears to be thrusting at Lisa's navel.
-   _Sextette_: Mae West is still being presented as a memetic sex goddess, a good _forty_ years (at least) after her Hollywood prime, complete with obviously false teeth.
-   _Showgirls_ is the film Trope Codifier. For a film that was sold on how sexy it was, it fails on all counts.
    -   No one in the movie can act. Bad acting is much funnier when everyone is naked. Elizabeth Berkley, in particular, plays a psychotic stripper with a Hair-Trigger Temper and is aggressively non-acting the entire film. Her nude scenes — of which there are _many_ — become ridiculous or uncomfortable because of how unbalanced (and badly acted) her character is.
    -   Everyone is naked. The ever-present nudity becomes almost surreal. Naked bad acting moves into the realm of the absurd. The dance numbers, in particular, provide some weird, _weird_ moments like naked cavemen dancing, or BDSM biker rallies, that show why real strippers usually do sensual dances instead of Busby Berkeley Numbers.
    -   Things that should be erotic are hilarious because everyone in the movie is acting in the most Narmful way possible. Berkley having sex with Kyle MacLachlan gives us moments like her attempting to perform super-awkward oral sex in a pool and then having an orgasm that looks more like an epileptic seizure.
    -   Nomi licking a pole during her dance looks titillating, until you think about all the germs on that metal pole.
-   _Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li_ is not a good movie. The completely un-sexy "sexy" club dance between Chun-Li and Cantana didn't help, given the utter lack of any sort of heat between the two women, and the corresponding Fridge Logic that went with it (Just how the hell does Bison's right-hand woman not know who Chun-Li is?).
-   _Sucker Punch_ has a parade of pretty young ladies in sexy outfits. But since it's a brothel and Blue is abusing the girls - the whole thing will make one feel rather uncomfortable. It's likely this is intentional: as the extended cut features a musical number showcasing the T&A of the brothel - and then it immediately cuts to the girls struggling to sleep and Babydoll crying in the bathroom.
-   At the end of _Transformers (2007)_, we briefly see Sam and Mikaela making out on top of Sam's car. The problem is that Sam's car is the Autobot Bumblebee, who as we know is _sentient_.
-   Viper from _The Wolverine_ attempts to be a Ms. Fanservice, but fails. This was due to a bad wardrobe choice, among other things.
-   _Zerophilia_ is about a person dealing with a very rare condition that allows you to change sexes during arousal or orgasm. Sounds cool, until you bring in the Fridge Logic involved with the mechanics of the condition. It's explicitly shown that orgasm is the key to full change. So how does it work when a woman with the condition has an orgasm while having a man inside her?

    Literature 

### **In General:**

-   Absolutely anything and everything nominated for the Bad Sex in Fiction award.
    
    "Now she made a noise like a tortured Moomintroll."
    

### **By Work:**

-   _Anita Blake_ brings us IKEA Erotica, sex with half-turned were-creatures, sex with underaged boys, sex with mentally and emotionally damaged strippers, group sex with no sanitation at all, and some of the most terrifyingly foodlike descriptions of oral sex ever. All in all, some might like it, but yuck.
-   _A Court of Thorns and Roses_:
    -   A scene in _A Court of Wings and Ruin_ features Feyre giving Rhysand oral sex...in a war camp, with a _battle_ raging not far from them. Aside from the middle of a warzone not being the most practical place to stop for sex, the sounds of people fighting and dying (which Feyre mentions she can hear) don't exactly make for a sensual atmosphere.
    -   During Feyre and Rhysand's sex scene in _Frost and Starlight_, Feyre presents him with a vision of their future child...which immediately makes Rhys climax. More than a few readers found this weird and uncomfortable.
    -   At one point Feyre and Rhysand seriously consider having sex in a library that also serves as a refuge for vulnerable women, including many who are survivors of sexual violence. Several readers have commented that they found this not only unsexy but highly inappropriate.
    -   After one sexual encounter Feyre notes that Rhysand's climax was so magically powerful that it made all the trees around them explode into splinters. Many readers found the mental image of "Rhys nutting so hard he makes the trees explode" to be a rather jarring tonal shift and more hilarious than sexy.
    -   Nesta and Cassian's interaction in _Wings and Embers_ appears to be intended as Slap-Slap-Kiss and Belligerent Sexual Tension, but it can be hard to view it that way given the sheer level of hostility between them (culminating in Nesta kneeing him in the crotch when he won't let go of her) and the fact it's simultaneously revealed Nesta was nearly raped by her ex, all of which makes Cassian's dirty talk and domineering behavior less sexy and more uncomfortable for several readers.
-   _Fifty Shades of Grey_:
    -   Whenever Anastasia Steele mentions her "Inner Goddess", the bizarre euphemisms she uses to describe her vagina, Christian Grey's penis, or condoms.
    -   To BDSM fans it's _very_ clear that the author isn't familiar with the subculture and doesn't seem to understand Safe, Sane, and Consensual, which make some scenes go from "sexy" to "actually kind of horrifying".
    -   The way Grey treats Ana, in general, is also a turn-off for all people who need trust and love to find something sexy.
    -   The way Christian speaks of Ana's virginity like an obstacle to be removed.
    -   The infamous tampon scene. Christian is about to have sex with Ana, who is currently having her period. He then proceeds to kneel down and slowly pulls the tampon out of her privates, before throwing it into the toilet. Supposedly, this scene was intended to be rather sexy, given Ana's word-choice during this event, but most readers were quite squicked by it. This scene was apparently so loathed by people that the film-makers _refused_ to shoot this scene.
    -   Ana's comparison of multiple orgasms to "a washing machine reaching the end of its spin cycle" was widely mocked by the UK media, cementing its reputation as being porn for repressed, middle-aged housewives.
    -   Some readers were really turned off when Christian reveals in _Fifty Shades Darker_ that he thinks he likes beating, dominating and having rough sex with women who physically resemble his biological mother, whom he resents for neglecting him and dying of an overdose; intentionally or not, it adds very disturbing, incestuous undertones to Ana and Christian's entire relationship and seems more like something out of a psychological thriller than an erotic romance.
-   In the first _Kitty Norville_ book, the image of a bunch of naked werewolves huddling together for warmth and closeness in a cave could be interpreted as Rule of Sexy, or possibly a kind of Ugly Cute. But see the book's entry in Fridge Horror and then take another look. Earlier, the sex scene between Kitty and Carl is kinda hot, if you can dig the dom/sub aspect, but Carl ends it by saying "I'll take care of you, and you don't ever have to grow up."
-   _Knight Moves_ in its entirety. We have, among other things:
    -   The male lead meeting the female lead in the restroom, while he's taking a piss.
    -   A sex scene involving spinning; fun if you like penis injuries and being kicked in the head, not so much otherwise.
    -   The Written Sound Effect "queeb" in reference to withdrawal, making this perhaps the only book to describe sex in terms of 8-bit video game sound effects.
    -   Unusual Euphemisms such as "lady softness", "volcanic crotch", "ladyfingers" (!!), and "codpiece" (to describe the penis itself, not what it's kept in).
    -   IKEA Erotica
-   _The Satyricon_ is a 1st Century AD work of Menippean satire about the bizarre and often pornographic exploits of a young Roman, his even younger slave and catamite, and the various 'colourful' characters they encounter. When the sex isn't intentional Fan Disservice, rape (which is treated as a serious crime but is distressingly common), or drug-induced, it's full of Values Dissonance to anyone who isn't a 1st Century AD Roman, with the chaotic Lover and Beloved relationship between Encolpius, a grown man and his sixteen-year-old slave-boy Giton being one of the tamer immoral and—nowadays—illegal things in the book.
-   Dr. Seuss's one foray into "adult" literature was the illustrated novel _The Seven Lady Godivas_. It was intended to be racy, as all the main characters are nude women. The problem, as Seuss himself admitted later, was that all the characters were nude women _as drawn by Dr. Seuss._ As you'd expect, nobody at all found it sexy and the book was a complete flop.
    
    "I attempted to draw the sexiest babes I could, but they came out looking absurd".
    
-   _Twilight_. If the Purple Prose and ridiculous, Harlequin romance-style descriptions of Edward don't make you laugh, the revelation that _he sparkles in the sunlight_ certainly will. And then when it comes to the actual sex, if you aren't turned off by the incredibly violent injuries Bella sustains, it turns out that Edward is a pillow biter. Not to mention the fact that he's always described as being ice cold to the touch, even in the love scenes. Sounds about as pleasant as using a popsicle. Or getting a pelvic exam with a cold speculum.
-   _Vurt_ by Jeff Noon manages to avoid IKEA Erotica, but falls into a trap with the same effect, in its longest sex scene. An extended, rather literal metaphor is made, with the girl's vagina as a garden that ultimately gets "filled with sap."
-   _The White Abacus_ by Damien Broderick falls into this category from apparent Author Appeal. It would seem Broderick thinks a woman with a rose growing out of her shoulder is fetish-appeal rather than Body Horror.

    Live-Action TV 

-   On _Boston Legal_, scenes of Alan circling Denise have a decidedly creepy vibe to them, especially after her fiancé just died, _especially_ especially the fact that there seems to be no reason for his hitting on her (other than the fact that she's an attractive woman, of course) as he has had no previous indication of an attraction to Denise beforehand, which seems to suggest that he might be on the verge of some compulsively self-destructive psychotic break. Mostly just takes the form of being Fetish Retardant due to the fact that these overtly sexual remarks are not coming from season 1 Alan, but rather season 3 Alan, making this Belligerent Sexual Tension a little off. Unless, of course, you were into that sort of thing.
-   The various Cute Monster Girl outfits the sisters wore in _Charmed_ were okay at first but started getting more and more Stripperiffic from the fifth season onward, as did the sisters' general clothing. Eventually, it stopped being fun fanservice and began to get kind of uncomfortable, as the girls seemed to be physically incapable of not dressing or moving like strippers, no matter how serious and not-sexy the current situation was. The quality of the outfits also steadily degraded, looking more tacky and clownish by the episode. The actresses hated it just as much as the fans, with Kayley Cuoco reportedly bursting into tears when she saw one especially bad outfit she would be wearing.
-   Used in-universe in the _Community_ Christmas Episode "Regional Holiday Music"; at one point, Annie attempts to seduce Jeff into joining the Glee club by wearing a sexy Santa outfit and singing a provocative song. Since Annie is a rather attractive young woman, all would seemingly be good — except that Annie, normally a quite intelligent person, intentionally dumbs herself down until she eventually ends up crawling around squeakily singing babyish gibberish. Jeff is visibly just as discomforted and squicked-out, if not more, as he is turned on by the whole thing. He's probably not the only one.
    
    **Jeff:** Look, eventually you hit a point of diminishing returns on the sexiness.  
    **Annie:** What's a diminunbumbluh?
    
-   In-universe example in _How I Met Your Mother_ with Robin, who's shown to have a few sexual kinks that are turnoffs for her partners. Her invitation for a famous hockey player to give her an obscure sex act called the Old King Clancy had him instantly lose interest in her and one of her boyfriends broke up with her for a bedroom thing that made him uncomfortable. Ted and Barney quickly recognize it and admit it's a valid reason to break up with her, despite Barney being a few symptoms short of a sex addiction.
-   _Stargate SG-1_:
    -   In the pilot episode the extremely attractive Vaitiare Bandera has a fun frontal nude scene. Great... up until a Goa'uld symbiont burrows its way into her skull through the back of her neck.
    -   In season 6 we're treated to gorgeous Jacqueline Samuda as Nirrti, with the resonant, sexy voice of a female Goa'uld and a couple of very alluring (and uplifting) outfits. Unfortunately, she's also surrounded by a number of grossly misshapen individuals who she made that way.
-   One of the criticisms of _Star Trek: Enterprise_ was that the attempts at fanservice were so obvious they moved away from sexy and into tacky and off-putting. The decontamination chambers where they were stripped to underwear and covered with gel were the most obvious, and the final nail was the especially titillating "A Night in Sickbay" (in which Archer has an Erotic Dream about T'Pol, who he never usually expresses romantic interest in): there was a slight bump in ratings, but after that, they dropped and never recovered.
-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_: The Human Aliens in "Justice" are meant to be attractive, but they just look silly due to their pink or white, skimpy, matching outfits— the men who play the harp even look like they're wearing diapers.
-   In _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_, _that_ scene with Cameron in the last episode. Authoritative commands, removal of clothing, flick knife, wait what was that last one? Ooookay.
-   In _Tipping the Velvet_ the heroine ends up the plaything of a dominatrix/sexual adventuress, with a first encounter involving a strap-on dildo. Some readers found the equivalent scene in the book very erotic. In the TV version ridiculous, impossible-to-describe music is playing throughout. It's more like the soundtrack to a sporting event. Any sexiness is shattered.
-   Ianto and Jack's implicit...something (naked hide and seek, anyone?) in the _Torchwood_ episode "Adrift". Gareth David-Lloyd is cute. John Barrowman isn't exactly bad-looking either. But put them together, subtract the clothes and add some implicit wild lust and you get the most hilarious pseudo-sex scene in _Torchwood_ history. It's possible that some hardcore fans of the pairing were titillated but more from the idea than the presentation.
-   _True Blood_:
    -   The show has a great many sex scenes, and a great many scenes involving blood. These scenes tend to coincide. Often. Then there's the corkscrew sex in season three.
    -   And then there's the neck-snapping sex in season two, and (in season one) Sookie and Bill have sex immediately after he digs himself out of the mud he's been sleeping in all night.

    Music 

-   The video for Alanis Morissette's _Thank U_ provides a similar example: Morissette's hair neatly draped to hide her breasts is one thing but the way her genital area is blurred out actually has a fair bit of horror potential. If the blur effect had just been made a tiny bit more conspicuous, the entire un-sexy effect could've been avoided altogether.
-   Alice Cooper's song _Cold Ethyl_ is a love ballad to necrophilia. Any normal person would feel a certain lack of being turned on.
-   "Romeo & Cinderella" by doriko has an eyecatch of Hatsune Miku in nightwear in bed, laying stomach down with her head on a pillow and an apple in her hand, with the arm of an offscreen person pressing down next to her. It's clearly meant to be sensual imagery, with the implication being that her partner is about to have sex with or cuddle her, but there isn't a body associated with that arm visible, the arm extends all the way from the top of the illustration, and there's a fair amount of empty space between Miku's body and the top. Whoever that is, the way the arm is positioned and the lack of a second arm visible implies that whichever offscreen person that arm belongs to is doing a _handstand_ rather than mounting her.
-   "I'm Horny" by GionnyScandal feat. Maite. Maite's Gratuitous English gives us wonderful lines like "Tonight I'm feeling to make you enjoy with a blowjob" and somehow makes "I'm horny, horny" sound like "I'm Ernie, Ernie". GionnyScandal's Italian lines aren't much sexier:
    
    _I'm not a baker but I got a lot of cream here_
    
-   Madonna's "Where Life Begins" from _Erotica_ is supposed to be an ode to cunnilingus, but its lyrics sound more like an advert for KFC, complete with the tagline "finger-licking good".
-   Katy Perry's "Bon Appétit" uses food innuendo that just ends up being gross. The music video about cooking Katy Perry doesn't help.
    
    _Appetite for seduction  
    Fresh out the oven  
    Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'  
    Bon app, bon appétit, baby (wooh)_
    
-   Robin Thicke's "Blurred Lines" has two versions of its music video: one in which ladies parade around in Stripperiffic outfits, and an unrated version where they're full-on topless. As Todd in the Shadows explains in his review, the unrated edition is significantly _less_ sexy than the other one: if the girls are dressed in revealing clothes, the viewer can imagine them taking it off, and that leading to sex; however, if they're already naked and sex still isn't happening... and that's on top of the song's lyrics, which are meant to be of the Intercourse with You variety, but are very easy to interpret as condoning sexual harassment or rape.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   The World Wrestling Federation putting Chyna and Nicole Bass in bikini contests, based on crowd responses (or lack thereof). Chyna getting plastic surgery also, though people eventually got used to it.
-   The pornographic elements tacked onto the ECW knockoff XPW shows tended to annoy people more than anything, as many only attended to see the fights and garbage wrestling.
-   Some who would have otherwise been happy to see the cute, slim "Sick" Nick Mondo were utterly disgusted by his over the top, blood bath garbage matches.
-   Early TNA's attempts to live up to its initialism tended to fall flat, with the X Division and AJ Styles instead becoming what everyone talked about while memories of cage dancers and trashcan sex they try to suppress (too bad TV Tropes will keep them alive). Later TNA's attempts to live up to its initialism _also_ tend to fall flat, such as The Beautiful People's time with all three knockout titles being considered an Audience-Alienating Era for that division.
-   WWE's "diva searches", which started as a harmless contest people were content to forget about in 2003, became a massive anti-sexy plot tumor in 2004 that derailed interest in their women's division, which till then was (slowly) moving away from sexual fan service. Wrestling taking sexy women and making straight men want nothing to do with them became a running gag on Wrestlecrap in its wake...and there were still three more diva searches to go!
-   Carmen Electra's Naked Women's Wrestling League featured clothed matches on their first show, then switched to nude matches after intermission. Many audience members preferred the clothes half. Some swore they returned only because they liked a wrestler and followed some of them long after it folded and they were back to competing in clothing. April Hunter, Annie Social and Melissa Coates in particular, Josianne the Pussycat to a lesser extent.
-   Some felt this way about Ashley Massaro around the time she was released from WWE. She had lost 30 pounds during her time on _Survivor China_ and she had trouble gaining the weight back, leaving her near emaciated and her breast implants looked oversized and disproportionate to the rest of her body. Her trashy outfits didn't help much.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_ has the utterly notorious unofficial third-party sourcebook, _The Book Of Erotic Fantasy_. Cringing turns to laughter as soon as you look at the pictures, half of which are photos of the same few people (presumably cut-rate models), the other half of which look like terrible Photoshop efforts. It didn't help it is lesbian-heavy in a way that borders on creepy, and that the only male/male flavor text involves a child-sized halfling.
    -   It wants so badly to be considered serious and mature, yet is chock-full of suspension-breaking items, feats, and spells that blatantly only exist for "sexiness", not because they have any real practical use (though the book certainly tries to pretend otherwise).
    -   To say nothing of much of the _official_ artwork. _Dark Sun_'s art featured primarily humans and human variants (Giants, dwarves, elves, muls, whatever) in Stripperific armour, perhaps in an effort to communicate that this was the "sexier" AD&D setting. Unfortunately, a lot of artwork in the manuals, though moody and striking, looks... quite weird<small>◊</small>, with many misshapen heads, strangely bulky people, warriors looking like they're in bondage gear, and some unintentionally funny choices of armour.<small>◊</small> This isn't even getting into the fact people would actually not want to dress like this in a desert.
-   Due to constant aversion of Conservation of Detail, _F.A.T.A.L._ has plenty of this. As the famous RPGNet review pointed out, this is a game where players may actually be called upon to solve quadratic math equations to roleplay sex acts. And that is without even touching upon the setting, which displays a level of misogyny that makes _Cerebus the Aardvark_ look like Feminist Fantasy by comparison.
-   _Bliss Stage_ intentionally thrives on this. The rulebook actually suggests naming your support characters after past crushes, to help method act how awkward (and potentially fucked-up) teenagers in those sorts of relationships would be under the circumstances.
-   _Warhammer_ has Slaanesh, the Chaos God of desire. While one may consider a god of desire sexy, the Chaos Gods are the stuff of Nightmare Fuel, which is generally sufficient to negate whatever sex appeal Slaanesh might have. And if that doesn't do it for you, seeing what Slaanesh's particular daemons are up to and what his/her followers really enjoy usually will; you'd get five minutes of something alluring, followed by an eternity of things that can only be described as "incomprehensibly fucked up" forced on you. This is less of a problem with the game itself and more with fan works that didn't get (or care for) the memo.

    Video Games 

-   In _Sudeki_, the character Ailish is made of the "Sexual Narm" version of this trope. There's just something really off about everything she does that's intended to seem sexual. Easily the main example is her Stripperiffic robe/dress/scraps-of-silk-and-some-gold outfit (she's a _princess_, so one would expect of her to dress more modestly), and how flirtatious and unreserved she is. She does undergo Character Development, starts behaving more properly, and dresses up more, but that takes a good while.
-   To some people, _Bayonetta_ has a similar problem; her design smashes together numerous odd fetishes, which a lot of players think end up canceling each other out. Most off-putting are her ridiculously long, spidery limbs and form-fitting costume made from her own _hair_, which is just as likely to come off as gross as it was intended to be sexy. On the other hand,for a lot of people, all of that is exactly **WHY** they find her sexually appealing.
-   _Miss World '96 Nude_ was probably supposed to be arousing, but it didn't work. As Seanbaby put it in his NON-WORK SAFE review: "Growling demon heads grow smaller demon heads out of their faces and unleash an onslaught of terror that will cease any self-gratification you might have been starting on. The maggot-dripping vision of terror does eventually turn back into a topless girl, but by then the point is moot. It doesn't matter if a lump of dead bodies burning in a fiery pit of hell turns into the most beautiful girl you've ever seen— you're still done thinking about sex for a while."
    -   The gameplay is based on _Qix_. It's supposed to be an incentive to play well and finish the level quickly; in the original game, your score started going down if you took too long. Unfortunately, as the reviewer above pointed out, it defeats the purpose of including sexy pictures in your game to begin with.
    -   Chances are it's less about being sexy though and more about deceiving the player.
    -   The chicks in the game look rather off, too. Some of the models' breasts are Photoshopped to a comical degree, burgeoning on Nausea Fuel once again.
-   _Nasuverse_:
    -   Red Saber's transparent-skirted, panties-showing outfit in _Fate/EXTRA_ is turning out this way. Most of the fanbase doesn't find it hot; it's too out of place and hilarious. That the dress serves as part of the Establishing Character Moment of its wearer coming out as an egotistical narcissist doesn't exactly add to the sexiness.
    -   Many of the female servant designs in _Fate/Grand Order_ have gotten this reaction for taking the Fanservice to extreme levels, especially since many of the guest character designers aren't nearly as restrained about it as Takashi Takeuchi from the original _Fate/stay night_. Minamoto no Raikou, in particular, has been called out for how her boobs go straight over the line from titillating to grotesque.
-   Marian, the Damsel in Distress in most of the _Double Dragon_ games, who is usually a good-looking woman (as seen in the original arcade game and the second NES game), got whacked with the ugly stick in the Sega Genesis port by Accolade. The panty shots were still kept for the Genesis version, but they end up being more disturbing than sexy because of the way she looks. (See here.)
-   In _Dragon Age: Origins_, the scene you get when you consummate one of the romance options fails on many levels. The music is bad, the visuals are bad, those involved are still wearing their underwear, and it goes on far too long. _Mass Effect_ showed that less is definitely more.
    -   A picture of a bored-looking dwarf involved in such a scene is its own mini-meme.
    -   Not to mention that glitch that can cause the player-character to still be fully clothed/armored during the scene.<small>◊</small>
    -   Morrigan keeps her eyes open when she makes out with you. "So, that's what it looks like!"
    -   In her sex scenes, Morrigan is wearing a bra, while it's evident from her normal costume that she usually doesn't burden herself with such things. This is more narm than Fetish Retardant, but still, did she take the time to put a bra on just for the sex scene?
-   _The Sims 2_ has the ability to "Woo-Hoo", or have sex. However, it's too cartoonish in noise and appearance to be arousing; it's even worse if you look under the sheets through hacking. The next game in the series cools down the comedy and adds actual moaning, but it's still not much. Making out, on the other hand...
-   In _Final Fantasy IV_, the player can have Cecil pay ten thousand gil (in a game where new weapons are both vital and highly expensive, and at a point in the game where this is not easy money) to receive a lapdance from a small army of pixellated go-go dancers gyrating to a samba version of the Chocobo music. Between the soundtrack, graphics, and ripoff price, it's pretty impossible to find anything exciting about it - after which you're even criticised by the doorman for being in the club when you have more wholesome things to pursue as if you were enjoying it. _Final Fantasy V_ and _VII_ got around this problem by having lapdances and jaunts in brothels that were absurd and silly rather than sexy.
-   Curiously, the general reaction among fans to the hot springs scene in _Final Fantasy X-2_ tends to be of annoyance rather than titillation. Go figure.
    -   The scene a bit later, when Yuna gives LeBlanc a back massage. LeBlanc's moans and sighs of pleasure feel _very_ out of place and are quite unpleasant to listen to. The fact that this scene, unlike the hot springs mentioned above, is _mandatory_ to proceed in the story and can easily end up needing to be done twice due to the way the massage mini-game is done, makes this scene feel anything but sexy.
-   During the Atari 2600 era, a company called Mystique thought it would be a good idea to make erotic video games for the system. That's right: porn on a system that can't even make dragons<small>◊</small> not look like blocky, green ducks, let alone represent a sex scene. It doesn't help that the games feature scenarios that range from absurd to decidedly unsexy:
    -   _Bachelor Party_ is a bizarre _Breakout_ clone in which the ball is replaced with a nude man, and the "bricks" are replaced with inexplicably nude women.
    -   In _Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em_, you control two nude women who move back and forth across the bottom of a building to catch semen from a masturbating man on the rooftop.
    -   _Philly Flasher_ is like _Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em_, except that you control two men with their genitals exposed trying to catch breast milk from a witch — an old one, not a Hot Witch. Once the breast milk is caught, the men will masturbate for some reason.
    -   In _Custer's Revenge_, your goal is to make Custer, depicted as a man wearing nothing but a cavalry hat, boots, and a bandanna while sporting a visible erection, dodge falling arrows and randomly appearing cacti in order to reach the other side of the screen and _rape a naked, well-endowed Native American woman, who is bound to a post_ (though the game's designer insists it's consensual). If that weren’t bad enough, it’s an Atari 2600 game and the graphics look about as good as you’d expect. The _Angry Video Game Nerd_ said it the best when he had to review these, the poor bastard:
        
        **Nerd:** It stirred up a lot of outrage when it came out in 1982, Native Americans were offended, women activists were offended, parents were offended if their kids got a hold of this, and _I_ am offended, because this game's a fuckin' piece of shit!
        
-   At one point in _Heavy Rain_, there's an optional sex scene between Ethan and Madison because awkward, pointless sex is Quantic Dream's favorite thing. There's a technicolor rainbow of reasons it's more repulsive than erotic, but for starters: he's been brutally injured, he's worried sick for his son who he knows has a limited amount of time left to live, he's suffering from a burgeoning case of Sanity Slippage and readily admits he could be a serial killer, she's either only sleeping with him to get the story on him if he _is_ the serial killer he thinks he is, or she's fallen in love with him after being around him for a grand total of four hours or so, and on top of all that, it's an awkwardly-framed quick-time event that casts the player as Ethan, so you get to undress Madison in the most uncomfortable way possible.
-   Likewise, _Fahrenheit_, also known as _Indigo Prophecy_, features an 'interesting' sex scene. The pair are in a freezing boxcar yet strip to the skin, for one, and also one member is a recently revived cyborgized corpse who is explicitly stated to feel stone cold. It also comes completely out of nowhere, between a man and woman who have been pursuing/evading each other for the course of the game (and not in a Mind Game Ship sort of way,) and had no time at all to get to know each other.
    -   Even the ordinary sex scene before is weird and off-putting, since the devs had the bright idea to have the player participate by _emulating every thrust with a controller_.
-   _The Secret World_
    -   The game has a mandatory cutscene where Dragon player characters receive oral sex between being doused in fatalist philosophy. Not only does the bizarre topic distract and the sex cause a flashback to a Filth attack on Tokyo, the Dragon philosophy isn't exactly asking for consent at this point and the woman performing the deed may well be a Kumiho - and may be coerced just as much as you. Plus the game doesn't bother asking your sexual preferences: it will be a woman. Even if that's what you like, we also get a full-body shot of a half-demon bodyguard wearing nothing but tattoos and underwear beforehand to distract.
    -   Cassie (the Morninglight groupie) is a bit less severe, but the same lack of care for your orientation and obvious ulterior motives make her approach more than a little disconcerting.
-   In-Universe: In _The Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures_, the "Beat It and Eat It" level is a long tribute to Atari porn games, which the Nerd does not find arousing at all.
-   A major criticism of _Diabolik Lovers_ is that it's too disturbing or scary to be sexy. Some even feel that the game would've worked better as a straight-up horror story and not an otome game. Even some people who _are_ into dubcon/noncon kinks have rejected it.
-   Most people would assume that the murder victims that Hopkins, FBI "investigates" were intended as Fan Disservice; however, the way they're presented and how Hopkins barely reacts to the violent fates these poor women suffer (such as the helicopter pilot, whose body was desecrated afterwards) seems to indicate that _disservice_ was not what the game was aiming for. The results are as repulsive as you'd think.
-   The stripper minigame in the second level of the original _Dead to Rights_ game was generally received by fans as being more of an annoyance than sexy. It follows a boring rhythm game mechanic, the stripper's performance is very boring and repetitive, and the stripper herself is both poorly rendered and designed. The fact that the main character found his father murdered less than an hour before this scene in-universe (and just a couple minutes earlier in real time) also kind of kills any real sexuality of the scene.
-   _Metal Gear_:
    -   _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_ mostly plays the BB Corps as intentional Fan Disservice, but enough straightforward fanservice remains in their portrayal to make it feel weird for unintentional reasons. This is a particular problem with the humourous photoshoot Easter Egg, which causes the Beauties to start striking model poses or dancing to pop music - something that wouldn't be so jarring if it had been part of a bonus game mode, but that instead can be accidentally accessed in the middle of legitimately disturbing horror scenes.
    -   _Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain_: Some felt that Quiet’s Stripperiffic design was trying way too hard to be sexy and crosses into Narm territory. Not helped by many people finding the attempted justification for her lack of clothing (parasites that drink and breathe through her skin are what keep her alive because her internal organs have been completely burned) to be silly. Then it turns out to be deliberate when Quiet drops her illusion and reveals that beneath that “sexy” design she has horrific third-degree burns on every part of her body, complete with uncomfortable camera focus on her assets that feels like Kojima is shoving your face into her cleavage and asking if you feel guilty about lusting after her yet.
-   _Ride to Hell: Retribution_ has quite a few "sex scenes" dotted around in the gameplay. Note the quote marks. There are a variety of reasons for it, but the most glaringly obvious is the fact that both participants are always fully clothed. Other reasons include the blank expressions on the character's faces, the circumstances in which the sex occurs, and the lifeless-looking animations.
-   _Shantae and the Pirate's Curse_: There is a scene where after the pool is filled, the two ladies camping nearby strip down to revealing bikinis and start splashing around. Any aspect of fanservice gets cancelled out when you realize that the girls are wading around in monster drool.
-   The game _Haydee_ was mocked heavily by reviewers and Twitter pundits who found the main character's design (a white, humanoid robot with a geometric head and giant, extremely human, bouncing breasts and ass) really goofy-looking rather than sexy, especially considering the non-sexual tone of everything else you do in the game. Then again, said negative reviews did end up giving the game enough attention to warrant a sequel and to be fair a **LOT** of people still find Haydee _incredibly_ attractive.
-   _Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3_:
    -   The game, in its attempt to bring more fanservice to the table than its predecessors, crossed into cheesecake overload instead. Nothing wrong with some titillation, but when EVERY single female character in the game is dressed like a model wearing a sexy Halloween costume in even the darkest situations, it starts to become funny rather than arousing, especially when you consider that they're supposed to be professional soldiers.
    -   If you get Yuriko-Omega near water, a bug during the beta release would cause Yuriko's voice to revert to that of the default, laser katana-wielding infantryman if she hovered over water. Emphasis on _man_.
-   The _beatmania IIDX_ song "INJECTION OF LOVE" tries to be steamy, but it's hard to take seriously when the singer somehow makes the Gratuitous English line "stroke me" sound like "truck me".
-   _Super Robot Wars_ is no stranger to Fanservice when some of their female Original Generation character designs are provocative, especially when combined with bouncing during a Super Move Portrait Attack. However, because of an emphasis on showing cleavage and Shaking the Rump, coupled with the girls having exaggerated body proportions, in _Super Robot Wars X-Ω_, this comes off as distasteful and egregious. Adding to this, at least one female character in _X-Ω_ is designed with an explicit BDSM motif in mind.
-   Quite a lot of people found the over-the-top fanservice in _Code Vein_ off-putting rather than tittilating. There's a truly absurd amount of Character Customization options available to let you make your character look like whatever kind of hottie you like, a lot of barely-dressed and genuinely gorgeous girls like Io, Coco, Murasame and Eva in the cast, and your home base even has an in-built hot spring that you can get in with all the other characters- but the game is a bleak, post-apocalyptic and typically murderous Souls-like RPG, where almost every character is a reanimated vampire called a Revenant who is granted their powers and immortality by the parasite lodged in their heart, which threatens to take over their bodies and turn them into mindless Lost if they can't feed it enough blood. Basically what we're saying is it's an extremely grimdark game to be filling with anime titty girls, and that's before we get into how half the bosses look like giant mutated pole dancers, like Shadow Rise if she _wasn't_ played for Fan Disservice.
-   The Great Fairies in _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_ and _Majora's Mask_ are _supposed_ to be gorgeous Statuesque Stunners wearing nothing but make-up and a collection of leaves. But due to the primative Nintendo 64 graphics, the make-up on that blocky face looks almost monstrous, and the leaves can easily be mistaken for _rotting skin_. Combine this with that _screaming_ laughter as she appears, and what was supposed to be a calming encounter became shockingly creepy. It's not much better even with the improved graphics of the Nintendo 3DS remakes.
-   A common criticism towards the _Trails Series_ following its jump to 3D is that the female characters' models have chests so big that, on top of not always matching the 2D illustrations, look more off-putting than titillating. Rixia from the Crossbell duology gets this the most, especially in her appearance in _The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak_.
-   _Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus_: Anya, who's in a late-term pregnancy, has a few "fanservice" scenes, including one where's she portrayed as violently gunning down Nazis while nude. However most players tend to agree that sexualizing a pregnant woman comes off as squicky, especially since it involves her putting herself in dangerous situation.

    Webcomics 

-   Furry Fandom:
    -   It offers many opportunities for interesting couples, but it does not always work as intended. A rather infamous example comes from a kangaroo in the Rare Breed (porn) comic: "Ah yes! Squeeze my pouch-teats!"
    -   The "furspeak" that some writers/cartoonists insist on using can also turn a story meant to be sexy (or for that matter, deep and meaningful) into hilarity in very short order. From anatomical terms like "tailhole" to overuse of gender-neutral pronouns (that aren't commonly used by non-binary people, at least) to the terms "Yiff" and "murr".
    -   Some of the comic writers don't quite get grammar yet. Kind of hard to concentrate on sex scenes when the characters are talking like they're brainless every other line. Or worse (or better sometimes), when the writer doesn't completely get _English_ yet. Some of the most hilariously broken English you can find comes from drawn pornography.
-   _xkcd_: "If there's any possibility of sex, do _NOT_ leave your music library on "Shuffle All." The comic shows intercourse (in a _mostly_ SFW way thanks to being a Stick-Figure Comic) being interrupted by the _Power Rangers_ theme song.
-   _Penny Arcade_: In The Love Nest of Har'akki, where the contrasting reactions of Gabe and Tycho demonstrates the reason this is a YMMV trope:
    
    **Tycho:** Where are the _bipedal crustaceans_ in this calculation? The swirling, aroused gasses? The lonely, sentient space station whose hermetic bulkheads hold secret clusters of erotic delights, provided your character has both the skills and equipment? Carpe astrum, you Goddamned backwater clowns. There must be a universe of thrilling, dangerous, sometimes _razor sharp_ genitalia that slavers beyond the Horsehead Nebula.
    
    "Let me paint you a picture: imagine a Chik'thar hive maiden scuttling out of her mottled carapace. Her inviting translucent thorax heaving with ripe larvae. She retracts her guard plates, where forty alien breasts bristle with nipples! Yes, yes - a thousand times yes."
    
-   _Shredded Moose_: everyone's favorite Gorn-filled misogynist Webcomic whose artist can't draw breasts is full of this.
-   _El Goonish Shive_ uses it in-universe, with the main characters experiencing it:
-   _Sonichu #8_ begins with a poorly-drawn sex scene between the anthropomorphic hedgehogs Sonichu and Rosechu that's far more disturbing than sexy. It doesn't help that the comic stops to explain how their sex organs work.
-   _Kit 'N Kay Boodle_: A Furry Comic in which everybody Yiffs around all the time. It might just be tolerable, if not for the fact that the characters are drawn in a cutesy Care Bears\-esque cartoon style, clashing bizarrely with the rampant fucking.
-   _US Angel Corps_... well, uh... let's just say that "frequent, realistic, and graphically-depicted gore" and "an author who consistently and without question panders to the creepy misogynistic views of his target audience" do not a good combination make.
-   _Nerf NOW!!_ (intentionally) shows us that two sexy things don't equal double the sex appeal. Samus in the Zero Suit: Hot. Samus in see-through nightwear: Hot. Wearing both together: ludicrous.
-   This is the reason why Palcomix, a website known for pornographic webcomics that are either original or based on existing media such as cartoons and video games, has a divisive reputation in certain internet circles. While the artwork itself is generally agreed to be pretty good, certain readers of their comics tend to get turned off due to the grammar errors, nonsensical plotlines, the way the characters are drawn, dialog that doesn't really fit the characters, or the porn just being flat-out unappealing.
-   Some of Jay Naylor's works can occasionally fall under this category, whether it'd be the weird plotlines of his comics or the way the genitalia on his male characters tends to be drawn.
-   _Better Late Than Never_, a well-known pornographic fan comic based on _Kung Fu Panda_, has gotten this reaction from quite a number of readers. While the artwork is generally agreed to be phenomenal, the comic is infamous for its frustratingly long and over-the-top Kudzu Plot that occasionally diverges from its source material, which a lot of readers feel ruin the atmosphere. Scenes of gory violence, Attempted Rape, and gratuitous sex have only added to the criticism.
-   The artwork of infamous Swedish YouTuber and artist Shaddai "Shadman" Prejean is... polarizing, to put it very mildly. A lot of it stems from the fact that Shadman seems to have no limits on what he will draw in his works, including bondage, futanari, cross-dressing, pedophilia, scatophilia, rape... you get the picture. It also stems from how a majority of the characters he draws are underage, as well as his general art style which has a tendency to dip into the Unintentional Uncanny Valley at times.
-   _I Will Survive_ is a _Zootopia_ fan-comic where Nick and Judy discuss what to do after Judy ends up unexpectedly pregnant. It's meant to be serious however Judy spends the entire comic in her pajamas (which consists of an undershirt and boxers) while Nick is dressed as normal. The comic also features a lot of Male Gaze despite the fact they're arguing on whether to abort the fetus. The fanservice doesn't mesh with the mess at all.

-   If you ever browse _DeviantArt_ without the mature filter, chances are you'll come across very, very many "erotic" pictures drawn by people whose artistic skills appear to have not improved since grade school. Or they _have_ improved somewhat since grade school, but nowhere near enough to actually be competent artists, but the “artist” just doesn’t care and never improves their style.
-   A long-running Livejournal blog, Weeping Cock, catalogued examples of these in writing for over 15 years. Actual quotes dug up include "butt-oink," "disappointed queeb sound," and, of course, the titular "weeping cock."

    Western Animation 

-   _King Star King_: Those huge breasts that every female character has might look... passable, if not for the horrendous and disturbingly trippy art style the show went with.
-   Similar to _King Star King_, _Mr. Pickles_ also has lots of hypersexualized female characters and sex scenes, which would had been bearable if it wasn't for it crappy, low-budget Flash animation and absolutely hideous character designs.
-   _Ren & Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon"_: The downright overbearing amount of hypersexual fanservice, combined with John Kricfalusi's art style, in "Naked Beach Frenzy" have been known to be a huge turn _off_ for viewers. Knowledge of his history of statutory rape make it downright unwatchable, especially the scene of Ren fondling an Ink-Suit Actor of Katie Rice, one of his actual victims.

    Other 

-   Helmut Newton's "erotic" photographs.
-   The infamous _ahegao_ expression has reactions of this. Originated in Hentai, but is becoming more prominent in western works written by anime or manga fans. What it's supposed to evoke is a woman (or less commonly, a man) driven so insane with orgiastic lust/ecstasy that her eyes go wild and her tongue falls out of her mouth, but to some people it just looks like someone who's either having a stroke, or has just taken a giant mallet to the head from Bugs Bunny.

## Carol the "sexy" rat

Danny expresses disgust with Carol's sexualization in Ratatoing. She's designed and animated in a way that's fanservicey, but the movement, cheap CG, and her being a rat make it fall flat.
