_"Tonight, 10 PM, at the Pit, Everyone Gets Laid."_

— **Moles Mullaney**, _Part of Moles_ radio commercial for the Pit Party, _PCU_

For fictional people past puberty, any wild party with all genders, teen or otherwise, is all about one thing: getting it on. This can be a good or bad thing, depending on many factors. Although one absolute in fiction is that if it's a teenage girl going, and you're her guardian, it's always a bad thing.

Part of the reason for this is simply that All Men Are Perverts and All Women Are Lustful.

**If it's planned and advertised as an orgy, it doesn't count.**

-   Spoofed in _Not Another Teen Movie_.
-   In a mid-credits scene at the end if _Old School_, Heidi invites the recently-divorced Frank to "a little get-together" the next evening. Given the events at the beginning of the film, an assumption could be made that the event Frank was invited to was an orgy.
-   The page quote comes from _PCU,_ but the film actually inverts the trope: The Pit's house band decides to name themselves "Everybody Gets Laid," so that they can capitalize on people coming in thinking an orgy is going to happen.

-   In _Smokin' Aces_, Buddy Israel's penthouse apartment is obviously showing signs that the party held the night before the action of the movie starts was one of these.

-   _Superbad_ has the two main characters inadvertently get tangled up in one of these as they head to the party they are supposed to attend. It doesn't go very well for either of them.
-   One segment in _Sweden: Heaven and Hell_ involves a pleasure cruise travelling the islands near Stockholm as a group of horny young people drink, have sex, and exchange partners during the trip. The narrator claims these so-called "boat excursions" serve as little more than an excuse for teenage girls to lose their virginity.
-   In _Train_, the 'party' that causes the team to miss their train is more like a rave: full of drugs, topless women, and offers of casual sex.

-   _The Wedding March_: Nicki's and Cecelia's fathers seal their children's Arranged Marriage during a party at a fancy whorehouse that devolves into an orgy. This scene, with half-naked prostitutes rolling around on the floor, is typical of how director Erich von Stroheim pushed the boundaries of censorship.
-   In the biopic _Yves Saint Laurent_, sex and drugs fuel many of the party scenes. In one scene, Yves consumes some magic brownies and then proceeds to seduce his long time boyfriend Pierre, while Pierre's hookup sleeps at their side.

The party's pivot into an orgy kills nearly a hundred people, Perry included, when the sprinkler system mistakenly dumps acid onto the naked partygoers.
-   Inverted in _It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia_: Frank invites Dennis to an _Eyes Wide Shut_\-style cloaks and masks orgy, but it turns out to be just a buffet for overweight middle-aged people.
    
    **Dennis:** What did you bring me to?  
    **Frank:** This is a buffet!  
    **Dennis:** I can _see_ it is a buffet, but _why_ is there a buffet at a goddamn orgy, Frank?!  
    **Frank:** _(grabs a plate)_ Well, you don't wanna bang on an empty stomach, do ya?  
    **Dennis:** I don't wanna bang _any_ of these people any way, they're all paunchy, weird and old!  
    **Frank:** You can't tell under the mask.  
    **Dennis:** I can _absolutely_ tell! And why are our costumes so much elaborate than anyone else's? Like, they didn't put any effort into it. _(guesturing to a fat guy sitting on a couch)_ Aw, _Jesus Christ!_ That guy is not even wearing a mask!  
    **Frank:** Now, he's got the right idea. _(lift up his mask)_ This beak is interfering with my nosh.  
    **Dennis:** What are you doing?! Don't take it off! _Aw, Jesus!_ What are we doing here, man? How is this even an orgy? Nobody's having sex! What did you bring me to? You brought me to— What _is_ this? It-it's like a _half-nude buffet party!_

-   Inevitably riffed on in MST3k; during a screening of _Laserblast_. The protagonist is at a birthday party looking through the house for his girlfriend. To be fair to the trope, he has already wandered past one couple who were making out. He opens a door and pokes his head in:

-   _Smallville_: In "Spell", Clark's birthday party for Chloe in the Kent family barn is getting a little wild, worrying him. He hadn't seen nothing yet: Lana, Chloe, and Lois, having been possessed by a trio of witches from the 1600s, cast a spell that turns it into a bonafide orgy—the Kents are still finding misplaced underwear in the barn days later (fortunately for Clark, they're so used to bizarre events by now that his explanation that A Wizard Did It barely rates a raised eyebrow).

-   On _That '70s Show_, Kitty and Red, along with Bob and Midge, are invited to a swinger party.

-   Bob Seger's "Horizontal Bop" tells about someone trying to get one of these started:
    
    _Somebody bring the records  
    Somebody bring the brew  
    Someone get a house  
    Buddy, we'll know what to do  
    Someone tell the ladies  
    Someone make a deal  
    If we can't find a house  
    Then someone find a field  
    Grass is good as carpet  
    Anyplace is fine  
    It's time to get rockin'  
    Babe it's time to shine  
    Tell 'em we'll be dancin'  
    Dancin' til we drop  
    It's time to get down and do the horizontal bop_

-   Inverted in _Moon over June_, when a prior hookup bumps into Summer and invites her to a "group thing" she is part of that is getting together for a session that night. Cue Sex Addicts Anonymous meeting. Being _Moon over June_, it turns into exactly this kind of party anyway.
-   In Volume 9 of _Outsiders_, Ebony Larsson is kept awake by the noise of her colleagues partying in the hotel room next to hers, but when she goes to complain she finds the party is, in fact, an orgy; with toppled furniture, scattered clothes and Jefferson Airplane playing on the TV. She promptly shuts the door and comments that it's like a real-life scene from the movie _Caligula_.
-   In one _Sandra and Woo_ arc, in order to celebrate the success of professional climber Butterfly, the raccoon goddess declares "early mating season" for all those present.

    **Benson:** ...it's not that kind of party, Muscle Man.  
    **Muscle Man:** Aww... Don't turn on the lights.
