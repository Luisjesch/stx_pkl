The original Scrappy in his native environment.  
We would say "Accept no substitutes", but asking you to accept him is perhaps asking too much.

_"The more astute readers among you may have noticed that I haven't yet gone so far as to give anything an actual 'F'. That's not out of any kind-heartedness on my part, it's just that every time I got ready to give one out, I would ask myself, 'Is it really that bad, compared to the verminous, soul-tainting badness of Scrappy-Doo?'"_

There are popular characters that have fandoms. But sometimes, there is a character who instead has a _hatedom_. We call this guy The Scrappy: a character that the audience hates to see.

It's not enough that the character be hated, however. For any character to truly solidify themselves as a Scrappy in the eyes of the audience, _all_ of the following criteria have to be met.

## A Scrappy has to be:

-   **Unintentionally hated by the audience**: If this character is supposed to be hated due to being a villain or Jerkass, and their cruel actions are treated as such by the narrative, that's a Hate Sink. They can be well-received by adding to the enjoyability of the work, if only for the satisfaction of them getting karma.<sup>Examples&nbsp;</sup>  While such characters can overlap with The Scrappy, they have to be hated for different reasons than intended that detract from the work's enjoyability.<sup>Example&nbsp;</sup>  A character's story should be concluded, seeing if they were supposed to be hated or get due karma, before judging them as a Scrappy or not.
-   **Hated by the majority of the audience**: If they have about as many fans as detractors, even if the latter are more obvious, that's a Base-Breaking Character. Examples of Americans Hate Tingle and Germans Love David Hasselhoff similarly don't count, as they have fans somewhere. <sup>Example&nbsp;</sup>  Someone not personally liking a character is not this (unless it's a Show Within a Show example). For a character to truly be considered a Scrappy, even the Silent Majority has to dislike this character.
-   **A single hated character**: The Scrappy, as an Audience Reaction, only applies to individual characters. Hated works, products, or real people do not count. Groups don't count either as they are not characters, and each character could vary in individual popularity (unless said group is small enough that all of its members can feasibly be judged Scrappies on their own). <sup>Example&nbsp;</sup>  Things like vehicles, weapons, or locations aren't characters either, so they cannot be Scrappies unless they're portrayed as sentient and have some characterization.
-   **Hated for narrative reasons**: They're hated for the perception of being poorly written or detracting from the narrative. If the character is hated for gameplay reasons as opposed to narrative or character writing, that's a High-Tier Scrappy or Low-Tier Letdown (if they're a playable character), That One Boss or Goddamned Boss (if they're an enemy), or other Audience Reactions such as Scrappy Mechanic or That One Sidequest. <sup>Example&nbsp;</sup>  However, if the character is hated for story _and_ gameplay reasons, then they’re still fair game.<sup>Example&nbsp;</sup>  If the character is hated because people hate the actor portraying the character, that's X-Pac Heat.
-   **Hated by the fans of the work**: They have to be hated by people who unironically enjoy the work otherwise. Characters hated by those who dislike the work to begin with, or whom the work wasn't meant to appeal to don't count.<sup>Examples&nbsp;</sup> 
-   **Consistently hated**: If an otherwise well-received character does something objectionable that's temporary or minor compared to their liked portrayals, or is likable depending on who's writing them, they normally have enough fans not to count as Scrappies. <sup>Example&nbsp;</sup> 

Not all Scrappies are doomed to their status. If the writers notice what's happening, they may change the character in order to make sure they are no longer hated, give them a tragic death scene, simply send them away, turn them into a villain in a reboot or adaptation and have the more popular characters beat them up, or at the very least show that the other characters are as annoyed by them as the fans are. In a few rare cases, a Scrappy will be replaced with a Replacement Scrappy; in this case, fans may be so irritated by the new character that they will retroactively find virtues to the old Scrappy.

This is an Audience Reaction, more based on the fandom than the character itself. The visceral response to The Scrappy can baffle other fans who don't take the character as seriously, or even sympathize with him or her.

As a result, dear reader, tread carefully: fans aren't necessarily always right. The catharsis from violently cutting into a character with a grating voice or an irritating tic may be cathartic for some, and extremely disturbing for others. This is a place to document a phenomenon, not to argue a character's merits, lack thereof, or vent.

Please only post examples of the fandom hating a character; posting Personal Scrappies could get messy, especially if the Scrappy is in at the center of a Fandom Rivalry. Die for Our Ship entries should also be placed on that page only, though someone could be a Scrappy because of that reason.

If the majority of the characters are scrappies (especially the main characters) then expect the audience to utter the Eight Deadly Words.

Contrast Ensemble Dark Horse (an unexpectedly popular (usually minor or secondary) character) and Unpopular Popular Character (a character hated or disliked In-Universe but loved by the fandom), compare Creator's Pet (a character loved In-Universe but hated or disliked by the fandom), and compare and contrast Base-Breaking Character (where one part of the fandom thinks a character is the Scrappy but at least a sizable chunk like them). A protagonist who becomes unpopular despite the author's intentions is Ron the Death Eater, which is an example of Misaimed Fandom. If the Scrappy dies or suffers in some painful way where the audience actually starts to sympathize with the character, then it becomes Alas, Poor Scrappy. Not to be confused with Cute Bruiser which is the original meaning of the word scrappy.

No Real Life Examples, Please! The real world isn’t a story with characters that could potentially make it worse. We also ask that you wait 6 months after a character is introduced or becomes hated before adding a character as an entry, to cut down on kneejerk reactions.

_Although this applies to individual characters, as a YMMV item, it should not be listed on character pages. This seems counterintuitive, but character pages are meant to list tropes audience members can see in the work in question, not fan opinion expressed outside of the work._

    Comic Strips 

-   Barry from _Curtis_. The author clearly intended his antics to just be normal kid-brother grade asshattery, but they're usually incredibly mean-spirited and deliberately designed to provoke Curtis, so that Barry can then sob to his mother that big mean ol' Curtis is trying to hit him for no reason at all, whereupon she will give Curtis chores to do for trying to hit his sweet, innocent brother, and Barry ice cream for being a Manipulative Bastard. Diane lacks the pattern recognition to notice that Curtis always has a very detailed description of the transgressions she doesn't believe Barry committed.
-   _For Better or for Worse_: Anthony back together with Elizabeth after years of him mooning after her while married to another woman and his outrageously inappropriate behavior during the Going After, and then ending the strip with their wedding. Words cannot describe how much these things (among other aspects of his character) made the comic's readerbase despise him even more than they did before then. How bad is the hate for Anthony, you might ask: Eric blatantly cheated on Elizabeth multiple times while they were living together and was completely smarmy and unapologetic after they broke up; when she went to pick up the last of her things from his place, he acted like _he_ should be forgiving _her_ for the failed relationship. And even still, it seems most of the fans would have rather seen her get back with Eric than with Anthony.
-   Most _Foxtrot_ readers tend to point towards Andrea when asked who their least favorite character in the strip is. Most of this is due to how overbearing she often is towards her kids (going into Moral Guardian freak mode over the slightest things), her being very hypocritical at times and falling into the same pitfalls she criticizes everyone else for, and seldom acknowledging her own personal flaws, which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that she is almost always treated as though she is right about everything (even when she is clearly not) and always getting the last word/laugh.

    Fan Works 

-   BC from _Eiga Sentai Scanranger_, for being painfully unfunny and making multiple bad situations much worse.
-   _Iced Engagement_: The story's take on Ami/Mercury is strongly disliked by readers, for being overpowered and a Spotlight-Stealing Squad to the Galaxy Rangers
-   _New Hope University: Major In Murder_: JP Laettner, the Ultimate Fraternity Brother, received several dislikes and no likes in a poll conducted in Chapter 5. Possible reasons for this include having a weak motive for murder as the culprit of the second case, since his desire to have sex with Juliet ended up resulting in her luring him in and manipulating him into committing murder for her, as well as the fact that his victim was Emily.
-   _Turtles_: The student council, especially Kawashima. Most reviewers who express an opinion on them dislike them and virtually no one is defending them, despite the author pointing out that they aren't meant to be hated. Part of the reason is that as of this writing, the fic is at the point in the story in which the student council is almost completely unlikeable(i.e. before the semifinals match with Pravda roughly two thirds of the way through). It doesn't help that the fic going into more detail about the effort needed to get the tankery team up and running again makes the student council, which started up the tankery team without much of a plan in mind, come off as less competent than in canon. Kawashima gets the worst of it, as while her terrible aim was regarded as an amusing Running Gag in the anime, people are hoping Koume will replace her with a gunner who can actually hit what she's shooting at.
-   The Hell's Kitchen RP, much like the show, has had several.
    -   Season 1 had Lifedollars, for his Sore Loser attitude and being an Elimination Houdini, Daisy for attempting to make an all-woman alliance, and Civ for his demeaning attitude towards Jake.
    -   Season 2 had Chris for his Smug Snake attitude, attempt to sabotage Ewan in the Cook For Your Life challenge, and his weird crush on Mehgan. Shorter lived ones were Marcy for her Ax-Crazy and Never My Fault attitude, and Smelly for his arrogant and disrespectful attitude. Of the staff replacements, Sous Chef Kazuki was the most hated, as many disliked his Ax-Crazy tendencies, which many felt were overexaggerated and not fitting of a Sous Chef. It's telling that when he was silently removed from the position, almost no one missed him.
    -   Season 3 had Abby for being an Elimination Houdini and Hugh for being a massive Jerkass. However they could not compare to Terrence, who is widely considered the most hated chef to compete due to his Dirty Old Man personality. It's telling even the other people who work on the RP _hate_ talking about him.
    -   Season 4 (All-Stars) had initial Base-Breaker Jangue come back with far less skill and more attitude, Carol for her annoying personality, Lydia for lacking passion, and Bobby for his Never My Fault attitude and attempting to nominate Ewan out of spite. Dee initially got hatred for his attitude, but eventually got better, but ended up returning to it when he tried to throw Kelly under the bus during his elimination night.
    -   Season 5 (Rookies Vs. Veterans) had Quandale for his unpleasant behavior and attempting to fight Gordon Ramsay, Betsy for her crass attitude, and S for his arrogant attitude.
    -   Season 6 (Rough Road To Victory) has quite a few. Bob for his Never My Fault tendencies, Abigail for having No Indoor Voice, Jared for his obnoxious behavior, Ashley for being an Insufferable Imbecile, and Mac for being a Jerkass Elimination Houdini.
-   The Spinoff is no exception as well.
    -   Season 1 had Nobert for his sexist attitude, Billy for his incompetence and borderline racist behavior, and Olivia for her Jerkass behavior towards the red team, as well as her attempt to sabotage Heather in the finale.

    Music 

-   Person Man in They Might Be Giants' song "Particle Man" is clearly intended to be the Scrappy of the comic book the song is about.

    Radio 

-   Ralph Cirella on _The Howard Stern Show_. Howard once responded that Ralph gets more hate mail than a Ku Klux Klansman who is a frequent caller to the show.

    Software 

-   Clippy, the Microsoft Office Assistant animated paperclip assistant, has become the Scrappy of business software history. In some versions of Office, as soon as you wrote the word "Dear", he would pop up and ask if you needed help writing a letter, complete with tapping sound effects. And if you actually did ask him for help, you found out that he was nothing more than a glorified search function.

    Sports 

-   Izzy of the 1996 Olympic Games is considered one of the least popular Olympics mascots ever. His design is obnoxious and baffling; most people simply passed him off as a "giant blue sperm with legs." His video game wasn't even any good and played like a bad Sonic clone. Not enough? The character was unpopular enough that _Izzy's Quest for Olympic Gold_, a 30-minute-long animated special that stars Izzy as the main character and aired on TNT, was never rerun after its initial airing and was lost until a VHS copy transfer resurfaced online December 2020. That's right, nobody liked him enough to bother preserving the special until then!
-   Digger, the mascot for NASCAR on Fox coverage from 2008 to 2012. He was greatly criticized for the ways in which he was used. Though it was at one time commonplace for networks to create mascots for sports coverage to incorporate an educational and entertaining element into their coverage, which was the case with Peter Puck, Digger was created purely to add entertainment to the NASCAR on Fox broadcast and reach out to a younger audience. Some NASCAR fans accused Fox of dumbing down and fluffing its coverage in order to gain revenue from Digger merchandise sales. Despite continuous outrage from the NASCAR fan community, as well as talk from the NASCAR community that the Fan Council was not pleased with the situation, Fox did not announce any plans to drop the usage of the characters, and even had posted pictures of holiday-themed versions of the Digger die-cast in 2009 and 2010. In response to the comments, in 2010, the Digger cartoon was not shown during pre-race shows and Digger appeared less often at the bottom of the screen. Throughout the 2011 season as well as the 2012 Budweiser Shootout and Daytona 500, Digger appeared very sparingly, usually only during commercial bumpers. Starting with the 2012 Subway Fresh Fit 500 all appearances and references to Digger were removed from the broadcast completely. However, nods to it occasionally came up (for example, at the Talladega race in 2014, when a track-level camera had a car drive over it, Darrell Waltrip commented that he hoped that nothing had happened to Digger, to which Mike Joy responded, "Digger's retired").

    Tabletop Games 

-   In the _Exalted_ fandom, the Scarlet Empress is often viewed as somebody who is given too many victories for too little effort, and who makes other characters look stupid for having failed to get rid of or otherwise deal with her (alternatively, there are those who view her as portrayed as having displayed too many incompetencies and having too many failures for her extended centrality to make sense).
-   Jace Beleran in _Magic: The Gathering_, in part because in the flavor text of cards he comes off as condescending and arrogant, in part because he is printed on many different cards (many of which are powerful, and a couple of which have been Game Breakers) over and above other blue planeswalkers who are arguably more interesting (he is the only mono-blue planeswalker to regularly get depicted in cards), and because of a perceived story bias.
    -   This despite attempts to rehabilitate the character which were actually working...until a new creative team came in, tossed out his new characterization, and torpedoed a generally well-received ship, among various other highly disliked changes and overall atrocious writing occuring around the same time.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:

-   The Ultramarines Second Company Captain, Cato Sicarus, is disliked as the most shilled member of the faction already contentious for being shilled as greatest Space Marines in the entire galaxy. In the codex, he had no characterization whatsoever outside of being The Best Captain Evarrr, with him being described defeating technologically-equal armies that outnumbered his own a hundred (or even a thousand) to one. Fanon turned him into a conceited, smug glory-hound with a likely-fabricated list of victories. He's so disliked that, while Games Workshop has made a deliberate effort to Rescue Ultramarines like Marneus Calgar and Roboute Guilliman, when Sicarus started making proper appearances, they bordered on Ascended Fanon.
-   The Grey Knights Supreme Grand Master Kaldor Draigo, in particular during and after 5th edition. The Grey Knights were already divisive because of their Holier Than Thou attitude, vast arsenal of rare and exotic weapons, and psychic powers. But Draigo was so full of Incorruptible Pure Pureness that he could waltz around the Warp for _centuries_ without being subjected to Mind Rape and single-handedly beat down Daemon Primarchs (in previous fluff, one Primarch required an entire crusade and one hundred Grey Knights to stop, and he killed them all to a man before falling).

-   Samuel Haight from _Old World of Darkness_. His original concept (kinfolk who wanted to kill werewolves to become one himself) wasn't too bad, but then more adventures were written with him and he ended up getting powers from _all_ the major gamelines (Vampire, Werewolf, Mage, Changeling) with Paradox immunity and the ability to Villain: Exit, Stage Left. GMs were _encouraged_ to always let him escape at the end. Eventually, the writers caught on and he was killed by a Paradox blast, and his soul was forged into an ashtray in the Underworld.

    Theater 

-   Hope Harcourt from _Anything Goes_ has often been criticized as a major wet blanket. In a show where every other main character gets to indulge in quite a bit of comedic hijinks, Hope's role is almost entirely devoid of humor, barely even qualifying as The Straight Man. Making matters that, Hope is a huge source of Wangst. Even worse, her whining is horribly indecisive, with her frequently alternating between crying about how she wants to marry Billy and crying about how she doesn't want to see Billy again.
-   While not the case in other versions of _Les Misérables_, Cosette is not very liked in the musical. This is due to many perceiving her as underdeveloped despite her pivotal role, as most of her original characterization is cut out of the stage adaptation. Making matters worse is the musical made her romantic rival Eponine far more popular than she ever was before, thus causing many of Eponine's fans to say that Cosette doesn't deserve Marius.
-   Productions of _The Merchant of Venice_ have to be very careful when it comes to how they present Portia due to the Values Dissonance making a lot of her actions age horribly. Modern interpretations view her as something of an Alpha Bitch - especially with her unfortunate line about not wanting to marry the Prince of Morocco because of his skin colour. And once she does marry Bassanio, she tricks him into giving up his ring and tries to paint it as him being unfaithful.
-   Opera has quite a few of these; _BBC Music_ recently did an article about it, in fact. They tend to be one-dimensional stock villains, especially ones who are ethnic stereotypes (such as Monostatos from _The Magic Flute_ or Mime from _Der Ring des Nibelungen_) or Purity Sues/Stus (for example, Don Ottavio from _Don Giovanni_).

    Toys 

-   _BIONICLE (2015)_:
    -   The Skull Scorpio is generally regarded as the weakest sets of the toyline due to its big and clunky, gimmick-based tail clashing strongly with its otherwise sleek and slender design, as well as for its legs being immobile. As well, it shares many of the frowned-upon aspects of its entire wave, such as a reused mask and somewhat garish colors.
    -   Ketar from the series' second year for his awkward build and function, as well as his mess of a color scheme. However, in some fans' eyes, he has been Rescued from the Scrappy Heap by the Animated Adaptation, and because many feel that uniting him with that year's Pohatu, another figure with a shaky reputation, improves both toys.
-   Fans of _Monster High_ _despise_ Hoo-Dude for his annoying personality (basically a male Plucky Comic Relief version of Frankie Stein without any of her charm or likability), irritating voice, and stupid, bizarre character concept (even for a franchise that _thrives_ on them). The fact that _Frights Camera Action!_ gave him a _very_ forced prominent role (mostly consisting of him doing stupid Jar Jar\-esque things and shouting the obvious) did not help and only deepened the hate. It's even believed that his first official doll was bundled with a limited edition of Ensemble Dark Horse Scarah because nobody would want to buy him on his own.
-   Kennedy from _My Scene_ gets a lot of negative reception from fans for being made as an obvious replacement for Barbie. The fact that both characters were paired up with River as well as sharing similar personality traits only adds fuel to the fire.
-   The vast majority of the _Transformers_ fanbase seems to loathe Bumblebee for his Spotlight-Stealing Squad tendencies in the toyline. It's more likely these days for a line to have at least two Bumblebees than to have any kind of Megatron, and they're often shipped as the majority of a case assortment. At first this was acceptable because he was popular enough among the kids that 'Bee toys vanished from shelves quickly, but sometime around 2010, Bumblebees became so saturated that every kid who wanted one owned one, leaving countless Bumblebees sitting on shelves and leaving no space for later waves that might carry more interesting figures. Of the bunch, the movieverse Bumblebee gets the most hate. He's the mascot of the base-breaking films, he's a pretty Flat Character, he receives nearly as many toys as the venerable G1 Optimus, and most of those toys just 'Bee with a slightly different pattern of yellow and black paint. Worst of all, he also pretty much forever locked in Bumblebee's design as "yellow and black muscle car" and ensured that Bumblebee toys from _other lines_ now have to look the same as the dozens of Movie 'Bee toys already out there. Even the Masterpiece release of G1 Bumblebee got some scoffs.
    -   Hasbro appears to have eventually noticed this, and the _Generations_ toyline, which is aimed mostly at adult fans of G1, has been entirely devoid of Bumblebee figures for years.

    Web Original 

-   While many of the NPC characters from _Gaia Online_ will always have Scrappy status among some users because of Ship-to-Ship Combat, one of the universally loathed characters is Diedrich, a sapient, talking grunny. Apart from his rather annoying and Sickeningly Sweet personality, he's disliked for being a Creator's Pet and Spotlight-Stealing Squad that appears far too frequently in big roles during events. Many haters agree he would be a likable enough character if he came in smaller doses, though.
-   Gamespot uses an "Annoying Characters" stamp in their video game reviews to mark the presence of these characters in their opinions.
-   The "Decommissioned" objects of the _SCP Foundation_, most of which were blatant Self Inserts and Wish-Fulfillment fantasies right out of a bad Fan Fic. They were so reviled by Foundation staff that most of them had their own Decommissioning log, where they were destroyed in the most over-the-top way just to rub it in. Sadly replaced by the Deletion thread in the forum, which isn't nearly so funny; some writers started deliberately aiming for bottom-tier trash SCP objects for the Trolling value and get more Decomissioning stories, defeating the entire point of quality control.
