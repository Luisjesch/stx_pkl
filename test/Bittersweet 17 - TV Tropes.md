_"When I think about you,  
I think about seventeen,  
I think about my old Jeep,  
I think about the stars in the sky."_

In their late teen years, at least in the US, kids become _no longer kids_... but not quite adults.

A character age as device, being explicitly 17 — especially if it's qualified as almost 18 — is used to show when these young adults are in their Coming of Age. They may be aware that they're entering their final throngs of true childhood, thus becoming nostalgic. Of course, being seventeen also offers a semantic sense of not too young nor too old. It's like you can only enjoy this feeling of total freedom — to be given a pass to run wild, and the ability to actually go: like Free-Range Children on steroids — aged seventeen.

It's suggested that seventeen is the age at which people are inherently dichotomous: both a child and an adult, also neither a child nor an adult; being idealistic yet also postulating on mortality (see: The Anti-Nihilist); it's strongly when personal identity solidifies and they find who they are, but also when they feel most lost and searching. In Real Life and in media, expect (all of the above, but in particular) being lost in 'such a vast world' feeling (especially in the more stylistic and thought-provoking age of The New '10s) to actually be part of the person's identity.

Trust this to be the age that people sigh dreamily back at when they turn on their Nostalgia Filter or sing their Ode to Youth. It may also be an important age in the relationship of High-School Sweethearts or someone facing Senior Year Struggles, considering that most teens go off to college around the age of eighteen. Characters that are presently this age, if fitting the trope, will likely be self-reflective about their life and experience some horrific Age-Appropriate Angst. It may be the best but also most regretful age.

This trope to some extent relies upon an equating of physical with emotional maturity. Relevant plot tropes are the Coming of Age Story and both Took a Level in Idealism and Cynicism. See also Nostalgic Narrator, Milestone Birthday Angst (if they dread turning 18).

You might be looking for the unrelated _Sweet Sixteen_, or the related Bittersweet Ending.

    Fan Works 

-   In _From Bajor to the Black_, viewpoint character Kanril Eleya is seventeen when the main narrative begins. In short order she breaks up with her high school boyfriend over him wanting them to go to a religious college together and her intent to enlist in the Bajoran Militia; her father thinks her grown-up, her mother still tells her she's "still just a seventeen-year-old girl" as she boards her flight to boot camp.

-   _The Devil's Arithmetic_'s film adaptation ages Hannah up from twelve to seventeen, allowing for a more significant Break the Haughty when she's sent back in time to the Holocaust and imprisoned in a concentration camp.

-   In the _Harry Potter_ books, wizards become adults at 17 (compared to 18 for the real/muggle UK) — this is shown in _The Goblet of Fire_ when the goblet in question will only allow for those 17 or older to come near it. Sure enough, life goes downhill for the Trio after they turn seventeen.

-   The protagonists of _The End of the F\*\*\*ing World_ are both seventeen, and run off together, facing the cruel, cynical adult world with some of their childlike innocence and foolishness intact.

    Music 

-   ABBA's "Dancing Queen". The lyrics suggest how that being 17 is the key to being free in dance, and yet can also be interpreted as retrospectively wishing the singer could be 17, despite how peppy it is:

    Young and sweet, only seventeen.  
    You can dance, you can jive,  
    Having the time of your life!"_

-   Kid Rock's "All Summer Long":
    
    _"It was 1989 my thoughts were short my hair was long

    She was seventeen and she was far from in-between  
    It was summertime in Northern Michigan."_

    Theater 

-   Both _The Fantasticks_ and _The Sound of Music_ use age 16 as a dichotomous borderline, allowing the characters of Luisa and Liesl to function as both children and adults in different contexts. The latter also has the song "Sixteen Going on Seventeen," which specifically revolves around this trope.
-   _Heathers_ has a song titled "Seventeen", in which Veronica begs J.D., "Can't we be seventeen?" ask suggests typical teen activities for them to do, such as bowling, eating chili fries, and watching bad movies. Interestingly, seventeen is being used to represent childishness and innocence, in contrast to all the murder they've been doing AT seventeen.
-   Played for Drama in _Jasper in Deadland_. Jasper is 17, so he's young enough that he has trouble coping when his parents get divorced, but also old enough that everyone acts like it's his own fault for not being able to handle it.

-   _World of Warcraft_: Anduin Wrynn is 17 in _Legion_, when his father is killed and he becomes King of Stormwind. Word of God actually said they thought 17 was a good age for him to become King — Young enough to still have the "Boy King" aspect of the character, but old enough to understand his duties and have agency in his decisions rather than being a Puppet King who's Kingdom is effectively run by his advisers.
-   The song "Maritime Memory" from _Splatoon_ is a bittersweet ballad that is only supposed to be sung by seventeen year olds. This implies that the otherwise vaguely aged Idol Singers Callie and Marie were seventeen in the first game.
-   The retrievable memories and the diaries of Princess Zelda and King Rhoam in _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_ show that Zelda went up Mount Lanayru to pray at the Spring of Wisdom on her seventeenth birthday in a last-ditch effort to awaken the Royalty Super Power needed to defeat Calamity Ganon. She couldn't go up there before because people under seventeen are forbidden from doing so. And when she comes back down still unable to awaken that power, Calamity Ganon reemerges from his seal to devastate Hyrule.
-   Cecilia Adlehyde from _Wild ARMs_ leaves Curan Abbey, a magic school, on her seventeenth birthday to begin her royal duties as the princess of Adlehyde. She's less than happy about it as being the princess causes her to question whether people truly care about her as a person or as a symbol. It only gets worse from there. Not only is she The Chosen One who can speak with the Guardians, they warn her that the demons who invaded Filgaia a thousand years ago are getting ready to strike again. Sure enough, they attack her kingdom to get the Tear Drop from her, killing her father in the process.

    -   In "Party Down", she only allows Leni, Luna and Luan to come to her sophisticated party. She tries to make it an elegant affair, eschewing what she thinks of as childish. The party flops and everyone leaves until Leni posts a photo of fun with the younger sibs. Lori's teen friends weren't ready for a sophisticated adult soiree.
    -   In "Driving Miss Hazy", Lori has been lording being eldest and the only licensed driver over the other kids so they band together to help ditzy Leni get her license. Lori becomes insecure that the kids won't need her anymore and sabotages Leni.

    -   In "Change of Heart", Lori is caught between hating Clyde's obsessive crush, and wanting the attention because it boosts her self-esteem.

    Real Life 

-   In the UK, 17 is the first birthday one celebrates after reaching the age of majority, which is set at 16. It's also the minimum age for you to be eligible for a provisional driving license, and thus be able to begin learning to drive a motor vehicle.
-   In the USA, 17 is the age at which one may rent/buy M-rated video games and R-rated movies.
    -   This is probably invoked by the teenage magazine simply called _seventeen_.
-   One _Frisky_ article, written by a procrastinating 21-year-old looking back at life after her last significant birthday, asserts that "Seventeen is the media world's go-to age of bittersweet reminiscence."
-   Another 21-year-old writes about her faith in the phenomenon from Notre Dame University as an academic think-study:
    
    _"According to the myriad references to being 17, the age isn't just one year in a life, but a symbol for growing up and all that comes with it. To be 17 is to be innocent but experienced, bold but afraid, naive but jaded or beautiful but lonely. The age, in the American psyche, is much more than the number of candles on a cake or a three-syllable word that's catchy to sing — it's the ultimate time of transition and change. Age 17 is the lynchpin in a lifespan, holding together all of the opposites and contradictions exposed or created with age.  
    Or maybe it's none of these things, and being 17 isn't so special at all. One thing is for certain: an age has never sounded so good."_
