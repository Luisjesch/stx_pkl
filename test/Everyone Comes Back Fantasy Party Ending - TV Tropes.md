A fantasy sequence at the end of a film, where everyone who'd appeared previously in the film comes back for a party, including characters who were merely imaginary or died in the course of the story. Everyone has a good time, old recriminations are forgotten, and everyone gets a Happy Ending. Often this is a Tear Jerker or a Heartwarming Moment.

Closely related to Ghost Reunion Ending, Dance Party Ending, Sudden Musical Ending, and Climactic Battle Resurrection. May overlap with Died Happily Ever After. For more metaphorical fantasy party sequences, see Loved Ones Montage.

## As this is an Ending Trope, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The end of the _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ series has all the cast applauding Shinji for breaking out of his Heroic BSoD.
-   Less somber than so many others, _Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)_ had a chibi-party OVA to advertise the movie set in that continuity.
-   The special epilogue for the manga _Outlanders_ had heroine and hero Kahm, Tetsuya, and their brood throwing a holiday party for their friends... all of who died during the actual series. There's no explanation until the end — on the planet they're on, once a year the dead return to visit their loved ones.
-   Although not exactly the final episode (though often mistaken for it), episode 46 of _Magical Princess Minky Momo_ ends in a dream sequence where everyone from Earth and Fenarinarsa join together for a party and _then_ break out into a song-and-dance number of the opening theme.
-   The finale of _Fushigi Yuugi_ has both their families and the Suzaku Seven attending Miaka and Tamahome's wedding in the real world as a supernatural Imagine Spot aided by the souls of the dead, among whom can at that point be counted Tamahome's entire family and most of the Suzaku Seven, to save Miaka from the despair Suzaku is using to consume her as a sacrifice.
-   The end of the Hot Springs OVA for _Ikki Tousen: Dragon Destiny_ had all the female Fighters, living and dead, relaxing around a hot spring.
-   _Darker than Black_ has a sequence highly reminiscent of _Evangelion_'s in the final episode with all the cast applauding Hei. It wasn't the last scene in the series, however.
-   The cover of the final chapter of _Elfen Lied_ has nearly all the named characters (Living and dead) standing together, as if waiting to have their photo taken, even The Unknown man, who is carrying the... capusle, that housed Number 28, ''who herself is cheerfully sticking her head out and smiling!''

    Films — Animated 

-   The end of _Shrek_ has everyone in the film come back to the swamp for Shrek and Fiona's wedding. Cue karaoke and a great party. Though it happens for real in-universe and most of the attendees are not unexpected (and see Shrek as a hero), Lord Farquaad joins in the karaoke from Dragon's stomach. Similarly, the Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming are both at the end party in _Shrek 2_, despite being the main antagonists. And the dance party ending of _Shrek Forever After_ includes a bunch of characters that only appear in the alternate timeline.
-   Similarly, _Minions_ feature a Dance Party Ending scene after the credits, featuring all the characters from the movie, including all the previous Minions masters, all of whom had died on-screen, centuries, and in some cases, millions of years ago.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _Big Fish_: During the last story as Albert Finney is being carried to the river. And then subverted with the "real" funeral.
-   _Longtime Companion_: Everyone who died of AIDS in the movie appears to the three surviving friends on the beach.
-   _Open Your Eyes_: It takes place inside a man who's in a sleeping virtual reality simulation, so it's not surprising his best friend and girlfriend appear once again. Since 150 years have passed while the man is in stasis, they're long dead and won't be around when he's awakened.
-   _Labyrinth_: Sarah has visions of her friends in the mirror, then it turns out they're actually in her room.
-   _Scrooged_: The spirits are seen at the final party.
-   Woody Allen's _Deconstructing Harry_: Characters from Harry's books and real people from his life all mingle, with music provided by the Star Wars Barmitzvah band from one of his stories, playing "I Could Write a Book.
-   Fellini's _8½_ has everyone dancing in a circle after the Author Avatar protagonist is Driven to Suicide by his own angst.
-   The original ending for _Heathers_, which had JD successfully blow up the school, whereupon all the students are shown getting along together at a prom in the afterlife. This was changed for being a bit too macabre, and in the final ending JD kills only himself.
-   The final scene of _Titanic (1997)_, where Rose passes away and is reunited on a restored RMS _Titanic_ with all those who died in the sinking. (And Cal).
-   _Return of the Jedi_: Anakin's shade is standing, smiling — albeit reticently — with Obi-Wan and Yoda.
-   Mocked at the end of _Kiss Kiss Bang Bang_, when the narrator points out how corny it is that Perry, who got shot in the chest, is now "magically alive, on crutches; I mean fuck, why not bring 'em all back?". In the background all the dead characters from earlier in the film walk into the room, followed by Abraham Lincoln and Elvis Presley, until a nurse shoves them back out.
-   Naturally, _Places in the Heart_ ends with the group meeting in a church. Rather bluntly metaphorical, since some characters are clearly alive and one has been dead since near the beginning of the movie.
-   Happens in a particularly metaphorical way in the film of _V for Vendetta_. A crowd of people all costumed as V remove their masks. Some of the people who reveal themselves died during the story, including not only the girl, but also: "Valerie" and her lover (appearing as they did before getting sent to Larkhill), the other homosexual couple blackbagged by Creedy's men, Eve's parents, and Dietrich, whom V says is dead.
-   At the end of _Wolves Of Kromer_ all the characters who died dance together over the credits to "Spirit in the Sky."
-   _The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension_ features all the _good_ characters dance-marching off to their next adventure during the end credits, despite some of them being extremely living-disabled.
-   As the credits roll for _The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou_, our heroes jog back to the Belafonte. Among them is Ned, holding the boom mic, despite dying in the chopper crash.
-   _Les Misérables (2012)_ has the entire cast come back at the end to sing "Do You Hear The People Sing?", even the ones who have died which is most of them, if not all.
-   _Casshern_ has the entire cast - including the villains - come back for a dance party/picnic which is oddly appropriate since it is implied that not only are they all dead and in heaven, but that they are reincarnated souls that have just finished another tour.
-   _The Voices_: As the credits roll, everyone who died in the film joins Jesus for a colorful dance number in order to let Jerry into the afterlife.
-   _Wild Mountain Thyme_ ends with Anthony and Rosemary, now married, singing the titular song at a bar with all of the other characters in attendance, including their deceased parents.
-   _Underground_: The tragicomic allegorical story ends with the whole cast dead and presumably in the afterlife. We see everyone at a picturesque lakeside picnic. Everyone reconciles, and Ivan provides the concluding ode to the old Soviet Yugoslavia. "Once upon a time, there was a country." The ground beneath the party cracks off (balkanizes) and carries everyone away on the lake.

    Literature 

-   Anyone in _Bridge of Birds_ who wasn't a villain shows up under the titular bridge of birds. The ghosts of everyone appear including Miser Shen, his family, Henpecked Ho, his concubine, her lover and the three handmaidens. In a bizarrely heartwarming moment the living Doctor Death is suddenly killed by a giant bird, only to be reunited with his late wife.
-   _The Chronicles of Narnia_ ends with almost every character from the previous books meeting each other in Aslan's Country.
-   _Under a Velvet Cloak_ ends with this exact type of scene with all of the Incarnations as well as quite a few other significant characters, even those from the other timeline. Interestingly, it is Justified since the special scene is created by the new Incarnation of Dreams.
-   One of the academics quoted in _House of Leaves_ spoofs the trope as a cliche of classical Hollywood, picturing a scene at the end of _The Navidson Record_ where Delial, Holloway and all the other characters would be waiting at the heart of the labyrinth and end with a dance number.

    Live-Action TV 

-   An interesting variation in the _Star Trek: The Next Generation_ episode "The Inner Light," in which all of Kamin's friends return to life just at the end of what is revealed to be an implanted memory. So, it's a fantasy within a fantasy.
-   The final scene of _Lost_ is all of the major characters, having realized they are dead, reuniting in a church to "move on" together. The last few minutes is everybody hugging each other.
-   Parodied in _Scrubs_. JD imagines how his last day at Sacred Heart should end, envisioning nearly every character who appeared in more than one episode, even those who have died, lined up down the hallway to the door to say goodbye. As JD reaches the door, he realizes how childish it is to expect everyone to make a big deal of it and walks out the door alone.
-   Some... example from _Deep Space Nine_ as well. Dead characters don't come back, but the actors who played recurring characters are there without makeup, creating a fourth wall straddling version.
-   The last episode of _Anna und die Liebe_ ends with the two current leads kissing and the whole cast (and some of the crew members apparently) walking through the scene in their Real Life clothes while the camera goes back revealing the studios set with the lights slowly going out.
-   Happens Once per Episode on _Danger5_. Everyone shows up at the party when the credits roll, even Hitler and the characters who died in that episode.

    Music 

-   Seems to happen during the closing track of _Ogden's Nutgone Flake_ by The Small Faces.

    Theatre 

-   In _Mack And Mabel_, Mack Sennett narrates in the last scene that Mabel Normand died on September 23, 1930, but the show doesn't end there (at least with the Revised Ending first used in the 1976 national tour). Rather than a true-to-life Downer Ending, he presents an ending worthy of a Mack Sennett film, bringing back all his friends for a big slapstick wedding ceremony where, with a squirting flower in his lapel, he puts a ring on Mabel's finger and the preacher gets a Pie in the Face.
-   _Les Misérables_ ends with the entire company, including the deceased characters, reprising "Do You Hear The People Sing?".
    -   Though most productions omit the villainous Thenardiers, and Inspector Javert.
-   Zigzagged in Gilbert and Sullivan's "Ruddigore". The dead baronets participate as a chorus throughout, but in the original ending, which is also used in some modern productions, they return to life when the curse that caused their deaths is lifted.

    Video Games 

-   The parades in _Super Mario RPG_ and _Paper Mario_ are much like this.
-   The "Confused" ending of _the white chamber_.
-   The very end of _Mario Kart DS_ if you beat all tracks and unlock all karts on all circuit classes.
-   The end of the _.hack_ series, where everyone from the four-part PS2 series is having a party. Sora, realizing how much of a jerk he's been, is sitting off to the side and crying, because he knows full well that no one would want him around, and rightfully so. But someone invites him in anyway, and good times are had by all.
-   The end of _Limbo of the Lost_ features this, as well as a huge song moment.
-   _Sacrifice_'s credit sequence.
-   The rather glorious ending of _The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past_ shows all the different non-villain characters restored to their proper places. The King returns, Link's uncle is brought back to life, the flute-playing boy is reunited with his father, etc., etc. And it is awesome.
-   Appears as a hidden easter egg ending in the final level of _Deus Ex: Invisible War_.
-   A very elaborate one happens in The Stinger of _Call of Duty: Black Ops II_: Menendez and Woods provide, respectively, guitar and drums for Avenged Sevenfold as they play their song "Carry On" to the crowd of characters headbanging in Club Solar. It's about as awesome and hilarious as you'd expect.
-   One appears as an after-ending easter egg in _Saints Row IV_.
-   _KISS: Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child_ ends with one of these, with the band playing out to an audience of the game's monsters and the 4 bosses. The musical ending is fitting for a KISS game, and the presence of the bosses is touching given that they were the Rogue Protagonist heroes from the comic series that you had to blast into chunky gibs.
-   The ending of _Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag_. As the ship carrying his daughter pulls into Great Inagua, Edward looks at one of the tables where his whole crew is having a good drink and imagines seeing Blackbeard, Benjamin Hornigold, Calico Jack, & Mary Read among them.
-   The credits sequences of _Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver_ feature sprites of the player as well as every notable character in that half of the game.
-   The _Mass Effect 3_ DLC _Citadel_ ends in one of these, with all living party members capable of being invited to a big party thrown by Commander Shepard. Characters killed in the course of _Mass Effect 3_ are also included in the DLC posthumously, since as _Mass Effect 3_'s final piece of content, it's considered the series' farewell.
-   _The Sexy Brutale_ has this as its Earn Your Bad Ending; unlike most examples, it's not heartwarming at all, since it represents the protagonist succumbing to hedonism and fantasy rather than confronting the truth.

    Visual Novels 

-   Every story in the _Higurashi: When They Cry_ Visual Novels ended with a Tea Party, with the various characters sitting around discussing the plot and their horrible deaths, and speculating on what was really going on.
    -   _Umineko: When They Cry_'s first Tea Party was basically a parody of this, as it's NOT a 'meta thing', it's part of the main plot; It starts as a cheerful conversation between several characters (some of whom supposedly died during the episode) where they wonder who killed everyone and how with a cup of tea. But as it goes on the mood becomes increasingly heavy and serious, until the Golden Witch Beatrice appears and kills the victims all over again, claiming that she committed the murders with magic. From that point on, the hero Battler (and the reader) will have to prove her wrong.
        -   The end of that series is a particularly sad case of this where Battler, who survived the Rokkenjima incident but lost his memory, is finally reunited with his Beatrice and his family in the golden land. The implication and meaning of this heavily depends on what side of the mystery/fantasy debate you sit on.

    Webcomics 

-   In _The Order of the Stick_, after getting trapped by some epic-illusion casting runes, Elan, Haley, and Roy experience this in a shared illusion in which all the plot threads of the comic are quickly wrapped up in a big happy ending, culminating in the remarriage of Elan's mother and father. Elan, of all people, is the one to figure out how illogical it all is (at the very least, his evil brother should be trying to kill him over being chosen as best man by their father) and snaps them all out of it. Belkar had his own separate illusionary world that also invoked this trope (it was just him, his Morality Pet, and his dead Trickster Mentor living a simple life together).

    Western Animation 

-   The last episode of _Batman: The Brave and the Bold_, in which various characters show up as Animated Actors attending a wrap party for the series. Considering the entire episode is a 22-minute Fourth Wall break, it's fitting.
