That's what you get for not listening to your mother.

_"Father O'Flanagan he was there  
And in the corner sat  
Amusing himself by abusing himself  
And catching it in his hat."_

— _Ball of Kirriemuir_, traditional

Masturbation portrayed as being bad for you, possibly making you go blind,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  go deaf, or grow hair on your palms.

Another supposed result of masturbation was that it would make you go mad, though there was at least some reason for thinking this; asylum doctors would notice that many mentally disturbed people masturbated a lot, and reasonably (though incorrectly), concluded that madness was caused by masturbation.

Mostly a Discredited Trope. While certain Jewish and Christian groups still do frown on male masturbation because of the story of Onan in the Old Testament, <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  the idea that masturbation could cause actual, physical harm came from Victorian Britain and the Second Great Awakening in the US. These were the days of Moral Guardians like U.S. postmaster Anthony Comstock and Boy Scouts founder Lord Baden-Powell, who believed that children indulging in "Secret Practices" would waste away their youth and vigor, and scores of ministers whose most lasting innovations in hygiene turned out to be Graham crackers and Kellogg's Corn Flakes.

All those old wives' tales and warnings have been turned on their ear in recent years. In fact, it has gone the other way to a certain degree. For men, medical studies suggest masturbation could lower risk for testicular cancer and help keep the prostate from becoming engorged; for women, masturbation can relieve premenstrual pain, strengthen muscles used in childbirth and treat vaginismus (a condition where the pelvic floor becomes tense, making sexual intercourse painful). Many countries' sexual education systems now recommend masturbation for young people in particular - statistics have shown that teenagers who masturbate are more likely to wait for the age of consent before they start to have sex, and also report better experiences once they do. However, masturbating too often or too much at once can cause genital pain, fatigue, and even penile fracture, so as with most things, it should be done in moderation.

One of the reasons pornography has such a bad stigma connected to it is because it "incenses the mind to masturbate". Ergo, this trope often overlaps with Corrupting Pornography.

Not to be confused with Self-Harm, which is about deliberately harming yourself in many ways (including this kind of masturbation).

    Anime & Manga 

-   It may have been unintentional, but Nina Einstein's storyline from _Code Geass_ has echoes of this trope. Early in the first season, she's shown masturbating to a picture of Princess Euphemia using the edge of a table. Then Euphemia dies, starting Nina on a downward spiral in which she threatens to blow up her school, pushes away her old friends, is manipulated into creating a Fantastic Nuke that kills 40 million people, and makes some truly grotesque facial expressions. While Nina's masturbation isn't stated to have caused her Sanity Slippage, it helped characterize her as a Psycho Lesbian, as well as one of CG's many Scrappies.
-   _The End of Evangelion_ (in)famously opens up with Shinji masturbating over a comatose Asuka in her hospital room as an indicator of how low he's sunk after Kaworu's death in Episode 24 of the TV series. His own immediate response to it<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  is what _really_ cements this incident under this trope. Even more, that moment's association with this trope is used as a plot point during Instrumentality.
-   _Tokyo Ghoul_: Torso's psychotic nature is further emphasized when he reveals in his diary to have masturbated while thinking about the scarred torso of Mutsuki. He gets off to the idea of cutting off Mutsuki's limbs and keeping him as a lover.

    Fan Works 

-   From _Plan 7 of 9 from Outer Space_.

-   In the Parody Fic _Hardcore Entertainment presents "Seven Does Voyager"_, Seven of Nine records the sex between B'Elanna Torres and Tom Paris and broadcasts it to stunt the growth of potential enemies of _Voyager_. This also explains why Captain Janeway is shorter than other starship captains.
-   Bakura in _Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series_ gets afflicted with "the deadliest of all British diseases": Wanker's Cramp. In the closing credits of that episode, we get the sage advice "Avoid Wanker's Cramp! Know your limits!"

    **Moody:** You been playing with your balls again junior?  
    **Harry:** Every day.  
    **Moody:** They say that'll make you go blind.  
    **Harry:** Must be why I need glasses. Well if it gets any worse, I can always get one of those crazy eyes like you.

    He's rama-lama-slamming on his ding-dong!_
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment_, the disgruntled prankster recruit Mahoney swaps the overbearing man in charge of recruit training's shampoo with fast-curing helmet repair epoxy. This has the desired effect of Supergluing the victim's hands to his head. When he finally manages to get his hands free, they are naturally covered with hair. When he asks a group of recruits if anyone can explain how this happened, Mahoney replies, "I can, sir. And if you don't stop, you'll go blind."

-   In the 1980 sci-fi comedy _Galaxina_, The Captain of the space cruiser on which the eponymous Robot Girl serves strongly discourages having sex with a robot because you could go blind.

    (as a priest) "No, my child! You must repent!"  
    (as himself) "I'll apologize all you want, but... I'm doing it again!"

    Literature 

-   Doctor Crombie, the eponymous character in Graham Greene (Author)'s short story, expounds that cancer is a result of masturbation... More accurately, he claims it is a cause of "playing with oneself", the euphemism giving rise to humour. The central theme of the story is to demonstrate the folly of conflating correlation and causation: "Almost one hundred per cent of those who died of cancer had practised sex".
-   This is discussed in the memoirs of the real-life Casanova when he makes friends with a Turkish Muslim and they compare attitudes toward sex in their respective religions/cultures. Casanova subscribes to the view that too much masturbation will make you sickly and weak (of course, his solution is to deal with horniness by sleeping with everything that moves and relying on the sacrament of confession to keep you out of hell) while Yusuf says that obviously "too much" of anything is bad by definition, but there's nothing wrong with masturbation per se, and that anyway it's a completely unenforceable rule. They also talk about male vs. female masturbation, with Casanova saying that girls don't run the same risk as boys because they're not losing a bodily fluid every time they do it.
-   Used sarcastically in _Auntie Mame_ when Patrick's roommate gets suspicious (what he's really doing at night is sneaking out to help Mame with a Zany Scheme she's suckered him into):
    
    "...Say, what's the matter with you lately, anyways? You're always tired and I never see you at gym and you've got terrible circles under your eyes. You're not _doing_ anything at night are you?"  
    I gulped. "Well, gosh, Junior..." Then I saw what he meant. "Yeah, sure I am, Junior. Six or seven times a night. It'll drive me crazy and no nice girl will marry me and all my kids will be idiots. Be sure to tell your old man that for me next time you write." I snatched up my towel and stalked off to the showers.
    
-   Discussed in Neal Stephenson's _Cryptonomicon_. Avi's of the opinion that masturbation takes the passion out of life.
-   Unhappily married Samad in _White Teeth_ tries to cherry-pick the ambiguities in Islamic writings as to whether masturbation is okay or not. The imam tells him that he knows the answer — to 'stay away from his right hand!' That's fine with Samad: his right hand is paralysed anyway.
-   The early-Victorian Boarding School novel _Eric, or Little by Little_, has a notorious passage warning boys in hysterical terms against masturbation, referred to obscurely as "Kibroth-Hattaavah", a place from the Book of Numbers in the Bible which translates from Hebrew as "grave of lust" (although the "lust" punished by God in the biblical story was actually lust for food, or gluttony, rather than sexual lust).
-   In _Christian Nation_, the male rebels who were captured by the theocratic American government and put into a re-education camp are given special monitor bands that would prevent them from engaging in masturbation.
-   Downplayed in _Black Heart 1983_ by Eric Van Lustbader. One character used to indulge in masturbation every night (while perving on his sister, no less). As an adult he's seduced by a beautiful woman, but finds he's just not experiencing as much pleasure as she is until the moment of orgasm.
-   _Our Dumb Century_ includes an advertisement for an "anti-masturbation harness and genital pouch" not only designed to securely lock the naughty bits away to prevent this, but contains a blade to prevent arousal.
-   In _More Than Human_, the tyrannical, sex-hating Mr. Kew doesn't want his daughters to even look at their bodies, let alone masturbate, and shows Alicia pictures of people with cataracts to show what will happen to her if she takes baths with the lights on.
-   _Portnoy's Complaint_ by Philip Roth is framed as the ramblings of the titular Portnoy to his psychoanalyst, detailing his own neuroses around masturbation and sexuality that he feels he needs to escalate over time.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Played With in an episode of _Supernatural_. Sam and Dean wind up in a town where all the old wives tales — like "your face will stick that way" — actually come true, and Dean realizes it's affecting them when he ends up with hairy palms. Sam is not amused.
-   In a surprisingly mundane example, there is an episode in the first season of _American Horror Story_ where Ben cries while masturbating to the memory of young Moira touching herself.

    **Tim:** _\[laughing\]_ He probably can't hear you.  
    **Graeme:** ...Pardon?  
    **Tim:** ...Oh, I'm so sorry.
    
-   In _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_, Ferengi ears are a source of Fantastic Arousal when touched (and thus, grabbing them when pissed is analogous to a Groin Attack). There's a form of ear massage called "oomox." Naturally, there's a reference to an old wives tale giving yourself oomox too much making you go deaf.
-   In _Father Ted_, the abominable Father Jack Hackett really _does_ have hair on the palms of his hands. Quite a lot of it.
-   This trope is discussed (in so many words) in _Alien Nation_, George and Susan (Newcomers) talk about the human hangups regarding male masturbation. In Tenctonese society, it's considered to be a healthy and normal activity for a male. However, when a teacher made a suggestion to teach proper techniques in sex ed, referencing Newcomer practices, he was immediately fired, resulting in a scandal. George, for his part, has absolutely no trouble having The Talk with his son regarding this.
-   Parodied on _Seinfeld_ in "The Puffy Shirt"; George, an aspiring hand model, learns that one of the most famous models in the industry ruined his career with his masturbation habit; his hands became gnarled into _claws_!
-   On _Adam Ruins Everything_, Adam explains that this idea that masturbation is evil is what popularized the practice of (non-medical and non-religious) circumcision, mostly in the US. This was popularized back in the Victorian era by doctors and non-doctors, including the inventor of corn flakes: it was thought that by paring away the foreskin, it would reduce a boy's sex drive and urge to masturbate, or at the very least make it unpleasant. Oh, and it wasn't just done to _boys_, either. Many girls were also given clitoridectomies or had their clitorises _deliberately_ burned with acid for the same reason. (Sometimes under the guise of treatment for or prevention of hysteria.)
-   In _Louie_, Louie appears in a news show to argue with Christians Against Masturbation leader Ellen Farber, who thinks that masturbation is a sin in the eyes of God.
-   _Bottom_: Briefly hinted at in "Contest" when Richie pretends to be his aunt. Eddie then says "I warn you, that if your nephew reads any more art magazines, he may very well go blind."
-   A sketch on _Saturday Night Live_ ("The Bad News Bees," from 12/2/1978, with Walter Matthau as the coach) has the killer bee costumes recycled for a youth baseball team. And the whole sketch revolves around bee-porn and "buzzing off."

    Music 

-   "I'm a Wanker" by Ivor Biggun:
    
    "Oh Mrs. Palm and your five lovely daughters  
    thank you for having me and being oh so kind!  
    I've got pains in my arms and my dong is getting shorter  
    my knees have turned to water and I think I'm going blind."
    
-   Scottish comedy duo Hale&Pace have the "Wanker Song" (technically, "The Folk Singers").
-   From Cyndi Lauper's "She Bop", which is a song about masturbation:
    
    _They say that a stitch in time saves nine._
    
    _They say I'd better stop, or I'll go blind._
    
-   "The Big 'M'" by Christian comedy-punk rockers Lust Control is this trope and then some.
-   Occurs in "Shuckin' da Cob" by Da Yoopers. The male narrator says that his dad told him that he'd go blind and catches him with a porno mag. This leads to the son calling out the Parental Hypocrisy of said magazines coming from dad's dresser drawer, and finally claiming that masturbation is what "made \[him\] a man".
-   Slim Shady, in "My Name Is":
    
    All my life I was fairly deprived  
    I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
    
-   "I Cut Myself" by Talkshow Boy includes lines about both masturbation ("Oh, my little pretty one, I touch myself, I touch myself", "You fuck yourself way too hard", "In my bathroom and in my bed, With Hustler magazine, I Read It for the Articles") and literal Self-Harm ("I think I'm all together, But I tear myself apart; Because I cut myself (x4)").

    Myths & Religion 

-   In The Bible, Onan (in Genesis 38) was told to—in accordance with the duty of levirate marriage—have a child with Tamar, the wife of his dead brother Er. He didn't want to give her a child that would not be considered truly his, so he practiced coitus interruptus (apparently without telling Tamar what he was planning). God was displeased and struck Onan down. While ostensibly only about Onan's refusal to get Tamar pregnant, traditionally this story has been interpreted about coitus interruptus in general and masturbation by extension (the idea that it's abhorrent to ejaculate anywhere but into your wife's body — or, as the popular not-actually-in-the-Bible verse goes, it's "better to have your seed in the belly of a whore than to spill it on the ground").
    -   For what it's worth, one Jewish tradition, cited by Rashi, attributes Er's death to punishment for coitus interruptus as well (in this case, because he didn't want Tamar to get pregnant and lose her beauty).
-   The Roman Catholic Church officially considers masturbation to be a grave sin. It's explicitly written in the Catechism (the big book of doctrine) that "deliberate stimulation of the genitals for sexual pleasure" is a grave matter that is capable of sending one directly to hell.
-   Sylvester Graham (Presbyterian) and John Harvey Kellogg (Seventh-Day Adventist) both developed health foods - graham crackers and cornflakes respectively - that they believed suppressed 'carnal urges'. They also advocated male circumcision not to adhere to religious traditions but instead to, well, you know. And they even suggested _chemically mutilating a woman's clitoris to achieve the same effect in women_. Thankfully, only the comparatively less destructive act of secular male circumcision survived their era, but now it's something fathers have continually had done to their newborn sons just because it's been done for generations and no one seems to remember why. And no, obviously it does nothing to stop masturbation.
-   Unlike Christianity, Islam is somewhat divided on masturbation. Some scholars consider it disliked by God but not considered a sin. If someone avoids a disliked action they would be rewarded by God. The more fundamentalist scholars see it as forbidden. There is a middle ground that states you can masturbate without porn to avoid immoral sexual desires and adultery. It's been shown that the Prophet's companions had masturbated while traveling, and during wars when their wives weren't present to give them much-needed gratification.

    Radio 

-   In England, a common rumor is that it causes deafness. In a Christmas episode of _Hello Cheeky_, it's mentioned that Denis King and his trio spend the winter hibernating under the couch with a copy of _Playboy_. Thus:
    
    **Denis:** What is it? I was — don't do that, Don, you'll go deaf!  
    **John:** He can't hear you, Denis.  
    **Denis:** ...What?  
    **John:** ...Right.
    
-   _Alien Worlds_ alluded to this misconception in part one of "Adventure of the Egyptian Necklace". Maura Cassidy scolds Buddy Griff for watching a lot of television, asking him if his mother never told him that watching too much television would make his face break out and cause him to go blind. Jon Graydon informs Maura that she's confusing what she said with something else. Maura asks Jon what he's talking about and Jon answers that he'll explain it to her later.

    Theater 

-   In _The Bible: The Complete Word of God (abridged)_, an Angel of the Lord is auctioning off God's favors to the greatest sufferer. The first bidder says, "I will suffer self-abuse and spill my seed on the ground." "Onan, that's not suffering," the angel tells him. "Well, it made me go blind," Onan says.
-   Referenced in not one but two songs from _Spring Awakening_:
    
    **The Bitch of Living:** Give me that hand please/ And the itch you can't control/ \[...\] Love may make you blind kid/ But I wouldn't mind at all.  
    **My Junk:** They say you go blind/ But what can I do?/ We've all got our junk/ And my junk is you!
    
-   Referenced by name in _The History Boys_:
    
    **Timms:** You've got crap handwriting, sir!  
    **Irwin:** It's your eyesight that's bad, and we know what that's caused by.  
    **Timms:** Sir! Is that a coded reference to the mythical dangers of self-abuse?
    
-   _Be More Chill_: Jeremy's SQUIP electrocutes him for planning to masturbate, believing it to be an obstacle in Jeremy's path to being cool.

    Video Games 

-   _Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete_ for the PS1 had a part where the lights go out and leave the party blind. Kyle says "I can't see! I'm blind! But I thought that was only a myth!" to which Nall replies "What do you mean? The cave went dark!" Jessica says "Trust me, Nall, you DON'T want to know what he's talking about."
-   _Leisure Suit Larry 6: Shape Up or Slip Out!_: Larry's attempt at beating off is this, as he possesses no self-control and goes blind from it, naturally resulting in a game over.
-   _Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War_: During the mission “Fracture Jaw”, Adler sees Sims, casually sitting on the passenger side of his team’s helicopter, and he catches him reading a dirty magazine...and lo and behold, they have a colourful exchange.
    
    **Adler**: Hey Sims! You know reading that shit’s gonna make you go blind.
    
    **Sims**: Yup! That’s why I want it all up here. _(Points into his head)_
    
-   In _Disco Elysium_, the fascist Measurehead recommends "semen retention" to the protagonist during the Fascist vision quest. Of course, it _is_ a deranged literal fascist recommending this worldview.
-   The Evil Mentor in _Dungeon Keeper 2_ accused the player of this if they spend too long looking at a Mistress in the Torture Chamber, snarking "You'll go blind, y'know".

    Webcomics 

-   The "Mike's Left Hand" strips of _Sexy Losers_ are based on a Running Gag about a guy who's addicted to masturbation to the point of a Fetish — he apparently can't get off any other way. He does it in all kinds of inappropriate situations and even passes up opportunities for actual sex in favour of it. A Yet Another Christmas Carol parody strip has him warned that his death will be masturbation-related... somehow.
-   _Questionable Content_: Claire claims that her brother Clinton lost his hand (which was subsequently replaced with a robotic prosthesis) by masturbating so much it withered into a claw and fell off.
    
    **Marigold:** That doesn't make any sense. Wouldn't that make it _stronger?_  
    **Momo:** At worst, it might lead to some kind of repetitive motion injury. I don't see how—  
    **Clinton:** _\[indignant\]_ _It was a fireworks accident!_

-   Inverted in an episode of _Mission Hill_, where Kevin gets caught masturbating and tries to destroy the evidence, resulting in the store burning down and the kids who caught him being charged with arson. At the last minute, Kevin comes forward and, when everyone else is mocking and taunting him, Andy steps forward and calls them all down for it because not only do they all do it too, but Kevin actually had the courage to come forward and admit it in front of an entire courtroom.
-   _Drawn Together_: A blind boy with hairy palms is used by Princess Clara in her crusade against masturbation, only for said blindness and hairy palms to be instantly cured by Wooldor's ejaculate.

He ends up impregnating the entire neighborhood with a pastry bag filled with his sperm.
