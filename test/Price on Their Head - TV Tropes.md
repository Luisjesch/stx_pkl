_"I'm going to put a price on your head that's so big, when you look in the mirror your reflection's gonna want to shoot you in the face."_

This person is badly wanted by somebody. Wanted badly enough that they are willing to pay a large sum of money to whoever brings in this person. They often don't care if this person arrives dead or alive. The bounty is usually offered by either The Law or a criminal. Or both.

This person (and the price) will often feature on a "Wanted!" Poster. The price will usually attract Bounty Hunters. If said bounty hunters end up with a bounty on their own head, see Contract on the Hitman and The Hunter Becomes the Hunted.

Compare Demanding Their Head when someone _literally_ puts a bounty on a severed head, or Bringing Back Proof for requiring other evidence of death.

     Anime and Manga 

-   _Black Lagoon_:
    -   When Roberta first arrives at Roanapur, it doesn't take long for the cartel she's at loggerheads with to realise her true identity. Rather than run a mile, they continue coming after her, attracted by the _numerous_ bounties that have been placed on her head. Needless to say, they do not claim those bounties.
    -   During the Hansel and Gretel arc, the titular twins' spree of carnage earns them an $80,000 bounty that has half the city coming after them. When Gretel learns of this from Eta, she simply offers Eta nearly double that to walk away and pretend she never saw her. Unfortunately, Eta's with Revy, who suggests just killing Gretel and taking her money along with the bounty, and Gretel escapes in the ensuing struggle. Ultimately, the twins are killed not for the bounty, but because they royally pissed off Balalaika.
-   _Cowboy Bebop_: Every one of the fugitives that Jet and Spike are chasing has this as an incentive for the heroes to catch them. It rarely works out. Note that unlike most examples of this trope, the bounties are established as only being paid if a fugitive is delivered alive and unharmed. For the Bebop crew, this means that a lot of bounties end up either dying or the police find ways to weasel out of paying (like when a bounty turned out to be an AI- the cops claimed that the bounty was not valid due to not being human).
-   Bounties are a regular feature of the Leijiverse. The title characters of both _Captain Harlock_ and _Queen Emeraldas_ have large bounties on their heads, along with their companion Tochiro. Random side characters with bounties also appear from time to time. In an interesting variation, the price is often given as a one-year supply of energy capsules instead of cash.
-   _One Piece_: Within the setting, a pirate's prestige is tied to the size of the bounty the World Government has placed on their head. Likewise, a pirate crew's prestige is indicated by the sum of bounties on all of its current members. The Straw Hat Pirates, for instance, started off with zero bounties, and eventually racked up a total of over three billion berries. Main character Luffy, all by himself, received a bounty of 1.5 billion berries after all of his antics of being a Chaotic Good hero. In general, pirates' bounties are treated similarly to Power Levels, with a pirate's bounty being roughly correlated to how strong they are in a fight, although there are many exceptions.
    -   It's noted that in the East Blue, regarded as the weakest of the four Blues, the average bounty is 3 million; a bounty of 10 million or more would be noteworthy. In the first half of the Grand Line, one hundred million or higher is considered exceptional; in the second half, that same number is considered common or weak, and it's hard to surpass three hundred million. It's also noted that any bounty that goes to one billion or over is considered monstrous, even in the New World.
    -   As of the Vivre Card datebook releases in September 2021, aside from Luffy, only eleven other people are known to have ever had bounties of one billion or higher — in order, the top six are the late Pirate King Gol D. Roger (5,564,800,000, the highest known to have ever been given), Edward "Whitebeard" Newgate (5,046,000,000 before his death and the second highest ever issued), Kaido "of the Beasts" (4,611,100,000), "Big Mom" Charlotte Linlin (4,388,000,000), "Red-Haired" Shanks (4,048,900,000), and "Blackbeard" Marshall D. Teach (2,247,600,000; later 3,996,000,000 as of chapter 1059), while the five below Luffy are all followers of three of the original Four Emperors — King "The Conflagration" (top-ranked of Kaido's three "Lead Performers"; 1,390,000,000), Marco "The Phoenix" (former First Division Commander of the Whitebeard Pirates; 1,374,000,000), Queen "The Plague" (second-ranked of Kaido's three "Lead Performers"; 1,320,000,000), Charlotte Katakuri (son of Big Mom; 1,057,000,000) and Jack "The Drought" (lowest of Kaido's three "Lead Performers"; 1,000,000,000).
    -   As of chapter 1053, there are now _fourteen_ pirates known to have or have had bounties of one billion or higher. Kaido and Linlin's bounties have apparently been marked as "Inactive" following their defeats, and the bounties of those who defeated them — Luffy, who defeated Kaido, and the duo of Eustass "Captain" Kid and "Surgeon of Death" Trafalgar D. Water Law, who worked together to defeat Linlin — have increased to three billion each. As a consequence, Shanks is now the pirate with the highest known bounty, and the only one higher than Luffy, Kid, and Law.
    -   Chapter 1058 reveals that six more people have had their bounties raised to 1 billion or higher — Zoro (1,111,000,000), Jimbei (1,100,000,000), Sanji (1,032,000,000), Buggy (3,189,000,000), Crocodile (1,965,000,000) and Mihawk (3,590,000,000). Chapter 1059 then reveals that Boa Hancock's bounty has increased to 1,659,000,000, more than twenty times its previous amount.
-   _Rebuild World_: After Akira goes on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge against the MegaCorp executive Chloe for stealing from one of his close friends, after Chloe gets to the safety of the city, she puts a 50 billion aurum bounty on his head. What follows is Akira hiding in the wilderness with Carol in her camper/APC hybrid, a massive battle where tank formations and artillery encircle Akira and his team in an ambush (since Akira is a One-Man Army at that point), all culminating in The Siege of his Hunter Gang's Home Base in the slums. This was all part of The Conspiracy to show off that corporation's power by Alice to help it recruit someone, and they pay Akira and the city off.
-   _Trigun_: Vash has $$60,000,000,000 on his head for the destruction of a city. This paradoxically causes even more damage due to the hordes of reckless bounty hunters that are constantly chasing him. Eventually the Bernadelli Insurance Corporation declares him a "human act of God" to avoid paying claims on the damage he causes, incidentally cancelling the bounty.

     Comic Books 

-   In the first issue of _Batman: Gotham Adventures_, a wealthy philanthropist's son is murdered by the Joker. Grief-stricken, he announces a fifty-million dollar reward to the first person who puts the clown in the ground, once and for all. The whole city goes crazy trying to collect on the bounty, so Batman eventually decides to put the man and the Joker together in one room, telling him that if wants the Joker dead, he'll have to do it with his own hands. The philanthropist's humanitarian nature overcomes his vengeful urges, and he rescinds the bounty, just as Batman predicted he would.
-   _Justice Society of America_: One arc sees the entire team getting individual bounties placed on their heads, with the sole exception of Stargirl.
-   _Lucky Luke_ villains are sometimes shown progressing in crime by their growing bounties (Averell Dalton's is always lower than his brothers', when he even has one).
-   In _Maus_ the Nazis have put up posters informing the population each delivered Jew would be worth one kilo of sugar.
-   _Superman_ storyline _The Super-Revenge of Lex Luthor_ reveals that the criminal underworld has placed a $1,000,000 bounty on Superman's head.

     Fan Works 

-   _Dungeon Keeper Ami_: As said in "Getting More Nurses", Mukrezar has a bounty that's over two _million_ gold pieces.
-   _The Infinite Loops_:
    -   Some loopers, such as Pikachu and Anakin Skywalker, are known to put out rewards for non-loopers to find and capture MLEs during loops.
    -   Edmond Dantes gets a record breaking bounty on his head in the _One Piece_ universe because everyone assumes that he's a Devil Fruit user who can _swim_ (in reality his supernatural abilities have nothing to do with Devil Fruit). The local loopers are actually stumped at the number.
-   _This Bites!_: As in canon, the Straw Hat Pirates (save for some of their animal members) and many more have earned bounties. After Enies Lobby, Cross and Soundbite alone are 1.5 billion, narrowly higher than the entire rest of the crew put together (all _their_ bounties equal 1,480,100,000).
-   _Ultimate Video Rumble_: After Demitri Maximoff's actions in the second Rumble, Heihachi Mishima puts a sizable bounty on the vampire's head in the third. (As there are a lot of guns-for-hire in the Rumble, and many of them have no qualms with shooting the competition, the hunt rapidly degenerates into a free-for-all.)
-   _The Will of the Empire_: Part of Vader's scheme involves having massive bounties placed on _everyone_ he feels would be a major threat to Luke's claim on the throne, and all the significantly corrupt officers and moffs, to be paid out of his considerable fortune. This being _The Empire_, the result is important Imperials dropping by the thousands in a matter of weeks, and leaving Luke a clean(er) slate to build off of.
-   In a reboot of _Sonic Underground_ that also remakes the show and fixes many of its flaws, a bounty is placed on Queen Aleena, King Jules and their then-infant triplet children after they are deposed by Robotnik's takeover of Mobius in the first episode, "Beginnings".

     Films — Live-Action 

-   _Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia_: El Jefe puts a contract out on Alfredo Garcia's actual head because he knocked up El Jefe's daughter. The protagonist finds out that Garcia is already dead and buried, so he decides to dig him up and remove his head to return for the reward.
-   _The Dark Knight_: After the Joker angers the mob lord Gambol one too many times, Gambol declares that he'll pay $500,000 for the Joker brought to him dead, and $1,000,000 alive so Gambol can get revenge on Joker himself. However, the Joker uses this to his advantage by secretly hiring some of Gambol's goons and pretending to be dead while they bring him to Gambol, allowing him to get close enough to assassinate the mobster.

-   _I Shot Jesse James_: Everybody in the James clan has one, though Jesse's is the highest at $3,000.
-   _John Wick_ features an underground world of killers and people in need of killing, so this gets passed around a lot:
    -   In the first film, Viggo puts a $2,000,000 bounty on John to try and prevent him from killing his son, being prepared to take it to twice that if an assassin is willing to breach the rules of The Continental and kill him on-premises.
    -   In _John Wick: Chapter 2_, after John honours Santino D'Antonio's marker, Santino promptly puts a price on his head, and eventually doubles it as John cuts a bloody swathe through everyone who tries to collect. The consequences of this continue into Chapter Three and beyond.
        
        **The Bowery King:** He's offered seven million dollars for your life. Seven million dollars is a lot of money, Mr. Wick.  
        **John Wick:** So I guess you have a choice. You want a war? Or do you wanna just give me a gun?  
        **The Bowery King:** Somebody, please! Get this man a gun!
        
    -   Played with further in the fourth film, where one lone tracker simply calling himself "Nobody" attempts to extract a bigger bounty on John's head than what's posted in order to cross his retirement threshold. To help his bargaining power, he kills other assassins trying to get John first and even directly spares him until he can properly negotiate his terms with the High Table. When The Marquis attempts to shortchange Nobody by increasing the bounty to above their agreement, Nobody screws him back by helping Wick survive.
-   _Maleficent_: The dying king promises the throne to the one who kills Maleficent.
-   _Mortal Engines_: Hester is about to be auctioned off to a sausage maker when the notorious Anti-Tractionist Anna Fang appears and bids 50 on her.

Fang quickly demonstrates that he should have taken the 50.
-   _Once Upon a Time in the West_: The bandit Cheyenne has a $5,000 bounty on his head. Harmonica uses it to bid for Jill's land.
-   _Ransom_: Millionaire Tom Cullen receives a demand for $2,000,000 for the safe return of his son.

Anyone, no questions asked, no charges pressed.
-   In _Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves_, the Sheriff of Nottingham is constantly raising the bounty on Robin Hood's head. First it's 100 gold pieces. Then 500. The 25,000 crowns. It does nothing to sway people's loyalty to him.
-   _Star Wars_: In _A New Hope_, Jabba the Hutt had put a bounty on Han Solo's head. Sources outside of the film indicate that Luke Skywalker initially had a bounty of 60,000 credits for destroying the Death Star, which irritated Solo at the time, as it was higher than his own bounty. Jabba eventually raised Solo's to 224,190 credits, though this was _nothing_ compared to the 10,000,000 that the Galactic Empire placed on Princess Leia's head.
-   _The Three Musketeers (1993)_: The Cardinal offers a bounty for each of the Musketeers after they free D'Artagnan.

-   Frederick Forsyth's _The Day of the Jackal_ has disgruntled French Foreign Legionnaires, angry that President De Gaulle chose to accede Algeria to the insurrectionists, hire a British sniper to assassinate the French president. The sniper has a badass reputation as The Kingslayer, and commands a $500,000 fee.

This is considered exceptional because "no higher price than three marks had ever been put on a man's head before." Later again, after Grettir has already resisted several attempts to kill him, Thorir raises the offered bounty by another three marks. When, years later, Thorbjorn Hook finally succeeds in killing Grettir, he cuts off his head and brings it to Thorir preserved in salt to collect the reward; however, Thorir has heard that Thorbjorn could only defeat Grettir by use of abominable sorcery and refuses to pay out the reward.
-   _Safehold_: Late in _Through Fiery Trials_, the Grand Duke of Spring Flower announces to his soldiers that he will pay 5000 marks to the one who brings an opposing commander in alive, but only 1000 marks if said opponent is brought in dead.

-   _Tolkien's Legendarium_:
    -   _Beren and Lúthien_: After becoming an outlaw, Beren does such a good job at harassing the Morgoth's forces overrunning his homeland that the Dark Lord sets a price upon his head no less than the price upon the head of the High King of the Noldor.

    -   _The Fall of Gondolin_: Tuor becomes an outlaw after escaping Lorgan, starting a one-man-army guerrilla war. The Easterlings set a great price upon his head, but they did not dare to approach his hideout because they were afraid of the Elves and places formerly inhabited by Elves.

-   _Firefly_: Simon and River Tam have prices on their heads as a result of him rescuing her from the Academy.

This causes no end of trouble for the rest of the crew.
-   _Galavant_: Madalena puts a price of 6 gold coins on Sid's head after he runs away. When cornered by peasants who have reason to be hostile to Queen Madalena, Sid tries to convince them to let him go and says 6 gold coins isn't much money anyway.

Later, after the killer is arrested, it is all but stated that the wealthy man pays another man whose daughter was also murdered by the same serial killer (and who was an expert sniper during the Vietnam War) to murder him. The assassin confesses and is willing to pay the penalty but refuses to implicate the wealthy man, who is now paying for the murderer's wife's dialysis at a private clinic.

-   _EVE Online_: Any player can put up a bounty on a character's head, which is visible to other players if they view his or her profile.
-   _Evolve_: All Basilisk Soldiers, such as Slim, have a 10,000 key bounty on their heads due to their role in the attempted rebellion. According to Abe, the bounty is so high because the only people in any position to take advantage of it would have been rooting for the rebels.
-   _Fallen London:_ The department of Menace Eradication offers prices on the head of just about any beast out there, intelligent or otherwise, and a few humans to boot. Capture above death in the latter case, since people are known to come back with some ease down in the Neath. The highest bounty of all belongs to the Vake, at four _million_ Echoes, an absurdly high amount of money... and one of the Ambitions is all about claiming this prize. In the end, it turns out the Vake, AKA Mr. Veils, put that prize on his _own_ head because he wanted someone to hunt, and other hunters seemed like the most fun. And it turns out not even the entirety of the Bazaar and its institutions have _that_ much money lying around, so if you turn the head in they have to take out the Tragedy Procedures, and narrowly avoid having to liquidate the entire city by just giving you everything Veils had (and since every Master is rich beyond measure that is a lot of property), plus a few extras to sweeten the deal.
-   This is played literally straight in _Fallout: New Vegas_ when NCR Major Dhatri puts out bounties on the heads of three notorious Fiends - Violet, Cook Cook, and Driver Nephi. He needs their heads to verify their deaths, and the heads must not be mangled so bad their identity cannot be confirmed. To claim the bounty, you must not use energy weapons ( which turn entire bodies into ash or goo), explosive weapons (which mangle the entire body), or headshots that mangle the head. And it is best not to bring ED-E (who uses energy weapons) or Boon (who gets a lot of headshot kills).
-   _A Hat in Time_: During the Nyakuza Metro's finale, when Hat Kid steals the Time Pieces from Empress, rather than attacking Hat Kid right then and there, Empress instead calls out to the whole Metro that Hat Kid now has a bounty while deliberately letting Hat Kid flee from the shop, and then chases her as Hat Kid desperately runs for her life from a gang of cats and the enraged Empress who is hauling a rocket launcher.
-   _Live A Live_: The Wild West chapter's protagonist, the Sundown Kid, has a bounty of $5,000 on his head, dead or alive, which serves as a source of his rivalry with the Bounty Hunter Mad Dog, who wants to claim the bounty and the glory for getting his head. The chapter's ending reveals that, in truth, Sundown anonymously placed the bounty on his own head out of shame over losing his hometown, to give the bounty hunters an incentive to kill him; once he saved the town of Success from the Crazy Bunch, he outgrows such mindset and chooses to continue Walking the Earth and saving people in need.
-   _Mercenaries: Playground Of Destruction_: The main characters go into the warzone of North Korea because the UN Peacekeeping force has put a bounty of $100,000,000 on the head of Colonel Song (if captured alive, he's only worth half that dead). They also put out a "Deck of 52" of bounties on a range of his minions.
-   In _Paladins_, Lex has an ability called "Retribution" that puts a bounty on an opposing Champion that increases when they gain a kill streak. If he lands the killing blow on his mark, he can potentially earn a lot of credits at once.
-   _Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus_: At one point Neftin Prog offers a bonus for whoever can kill Ratchet: 10,000 bolts (which isn't really a lot, honestly). Ratchet then says that it'd be nice to go a day without getting a price put on his head. Earlier in the same area Neftin says that he wants Ratchet's head on a stake and his robot turned to scrap.
-   Bounties appear in two forms in _Rebel Galaxy_:

-   _Warframe_: On the Invasions Tab, the Grineer and Corpus will often be battling one another, and offering up rewards to Tenno that side with them. After clearing 5 invasion missions for one side, the other will put out a hit on your Tenno, represented as a Death Mark similar to the one the Stalker can give upon killing a boss; the Grineer will enlist the Grustrag Three, while the Corpus have Alad V sic his Zanuka pet upon you, and each one only spawns inside their faction-controlled mission nodes (meaning no Zanuka in a Grineer-controlled node, for example). In addition to these, whichever Syndicates you have negative standing with will occasionally send out Eximus Squads to attack you.

-   _The Owl House_: Eda has a rather high price on her head, for refusing to join a coven. Eda, being Eda, naturally takes this in stride. Luz, Lilith, and even Hooty later end up with additional bounties as well, as The Day of Unity approaches, and pressures at joining a coven intensify.
