_"That's the Florence Nightingale Effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid!"_

Maybe it's that they're so cute when they're helpless. Maybe it's that we really want to feel loved and protected when we're vulnerable. First aid is intimate. You have to lean in to pat a cut eyebrow with Dettol-soaked cotton wool gently. Narrowly escaping a life-threatening situation gives the scene extra zing. And the addition of loopiness from pain meds doesn't hurt.

Whatever the case, patients can and do fall in love with those who give them medical care, and vice versa.

When the caregiver is a professional, such as a nurse or doctor, it would be considered extremely unprofessional for a doctor or nurse to act on those feelings. Doctors are advised against getting infatuated with their patients or to clearly rebuff the patients' advances, and having sex (or any sort of overt romantic liaison for that matter) with a current patient, or any of their family members, is considered a punishable breach of medical ethics (there is a line in the Hippocratic Oath specifically forbidding that) to prevent the doctor from abusing his or her position of authority to coerce sex from patients. But in fiction, this will usually be portrayed as sweet and romantic.

When the care is given by an amateur, there is an added element of romance because the medical treatment is entirely voluntary. This isn't their job, it's a genuine expression of caring for the well-being of another person. Typically, the "civilian" version comes in two flavors:

1.  Previously aloof tough character gets injured, lets the love interest treat their injuries, and reveals a newfound trust and intimacy. This might or might not involve the tough person making that hissing sound when the love interest touches their injured face, but not quite pulling away...
2.  The love interest gets injured, and the tough character treats them and suddenly reveals a tender side.

The After-Action Patch-Up often has touches of this, but since it's only one scene does not often have the full-blown effect.

Named for the famous nurse Florence Nightingale, although she herself never fell victim to this and if anything, would have been shocked by such an abuse of patient rights. Psychologists just couldn't think of a better doctor or nurse, thus proving once and for all that tropers aren't the only ones who choose Trope Namers that aren't examples of the trope.

See Unequal Pairing if a professional has a relationship with their patient.

See also The Woobie, which is what the patient may be to the audience and to the nurse. Also compare Weakness Turns Her On. If the character giving the first aid is not actually good at it, it's Nurse with Good Intentions. Possibly contrast Lima Syndrome (though it might overlap if the captor tends to the captive's wounds).

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the second episode of _Afro Samurai_ the titular character is nursed back to health by a girl who finds him after he's injured at the end of the first episode, the entire episode has Ninja Ninja telling him to hit that and he does. Subverted in that it turns out that she's his childhood friend, is working for the bad guys (not that you can blame her)... at first and gets killed by them at the end. At least he gets a Pocket Protector out of the ordeal.
-   In _Attack on Titan_, this turns out to be how Eren's parents became a couple. An epidemic had swept through the village, and among the victims of the disease were Carla and her parents. Grisha was the village doctor that cared for them and saved the village by developing a treatment. The couple ended up falling in love and married soon after.
-   _City Hunter_:
    -   This was one of the central themes of a story arc where Ryo had to prevent a nurse's assassination. He broke his left leg so he was admitted to the hospital, and during his stay, Yoshimi Iwai -the nurse in question- fell for Ryo as she took care of him.
    -   This is also how Kazue and Mick become a couple late in the series' run, as the former, in the process of caring for and helping the latter to recover, develops romantic feelings as a result.
-   In _Cowboy Bebop_, Spike and Julia fell in love when she nursed him back to health after he was critically injured and collapsed outside her apartment.
-   A cruelly exploited trope happens in _D.Gray-Man_. It is first invoked by a doctor in a local hospital where he encouraged his nurses to romance with the ill patients they are attending. Meanwhile, he secretly poisons the patient through their so-called medicine. When it's too late, the doctor prepares arrangements with the heartbroken nurses to revive the patients. That's where the Akuma spawns are as well as the hospital's fundings came from.
-   In _Dragon Ball Z_, despite the majority of their Relationship Upgrade happening during a Time Skip, this is implied to be the reasoning behind Vegeta and Bulma's eventual hookup. She nurses him back to health after he overexerts himself during training.
-   In _The Familiar of Zero_, Kirche fell in love with Mr. Colbert while nursing him back to health. He, on the other hand, finds her affection embarrassing and disturbing.
-   In _Haou Airen_, an Ordinary Highschool Student named Kurumi Akino finds a handsome guy seriously injured on her way home. She tends to his wounds out of kindness... and few afterwards she finds herself kidnapped and shuttled to Hong Kong since her "patient" Hakuron just _happened_ to be a high-class member of The Triads and the Tongs and now he wants to "repay" her by making her his concubine.
-   Subverted in _His and Her Circumstances_. Tsubasa's dad married a cute nurse, BUT she actually took care of _Tsubasa_ in the hospital, not him. Tsubasa is displeased.
-   _Inuyasha_ includes a darker take on the trope: Kikyou nursed the bandit Onigumo after he was burned and severely injured to the point that he could no longer move. Onigumo developed a serious case of If I Can't Have You… lust for her which led him to trade himself to a pack of demons in order to obtain a demon-hybrid body capable of movement, becoming Naraku in the process.
-   Downplayed in _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_: There were already signs that Joseph and Suzie Q were interested in each other: he flirts with her, and she says he's actually kind of handsome<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , and when he leaves to fight the Pillar Men he promises to come back. However, it isn't until after Joseph spends two months with Suzie taking care of the injuries he sustained in the Final Battle that they get married.
-   There was kind of a plot point in _Kimikiss Pure Rouge_ about this, there was tons of Unresolved Sexual Tension before that, but when the male lead got sick things started progressing a bit more.
-   _Knight Hunters_: In _Weiß Kreuz Glühen_, an amnesiac Youji's ultimate fate is to marry his nurse and take her last name.
-   In _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (2016)_, Anika actually manages to get through Link's actual recovery without developing any feelings towards him other than antipathy and frustration, and even screams at him to leave the moment she sees that he's well enough to walk (and holding a weapon). Then Link patiently comforts her through the resultant breakdown and tells her how she's inspired him to become a Hope Bringer, and that's when the Crush Blush begins...
-   _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing_: During the second half of Heero's "Episode Zero" manga chapters, an injured Treize meets and is taken care of by Leia Barton, a very pretty nurse who's also Dekim Barton's daughter. Mariemeia from _Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz_ is the result of the relationship that develops. Other sources imply that she's just a brainwashed Street Urchin, however.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Implied with Yahiko and Konan, albeit in a flashback, with Konan tending to Yahiko's injuries while Nagato waits outside, and it is indicated that Konan was in love with Yahiko.
    -   This is the main reason why Sakura's childish infatuation with Sasuke turned into something more genuine.
    -   Subverted when Sakura (politely) turns down a love confession from one of her patients (because she still loves Sasuke) during the Fourth Ninja World War.
-   In _No. 6_, Shion and Nezumi meet when Nezumi breaks into Shion's house with a gunshot wound when they're both 12 years old. Shion patches up his wound and gives him food and shelter despite Nezumi being a wanted criminal. Shion immediately develops a crush on Nezumi that eventually becomes love when they meet again.
-   A _very_ messed-up variation in _Overlord (2012)_. Part of Princess Renner's plan to take back the capital from Jaldabaoth involves sending Climb to rescue civilians, knowing that he will likely be injured and die, which gives her the chance to use resurrection magic on Climb. But with the penalties that resurrection magic provides, someone will need to take care of him when he comes back, and who better than the girl who tragically sent him out on that suicide mission in the first place? Fortunately, Climb makes it through the mission alive.
-   _Ranma ½_: Almost every time Ranma's been hurt after a fight, Akane's the one to bandage him up and stay by his side. One of their first romantic moments together was when she tended to his wounds in the ice skating competition arc.
-   A variation occurs in _Red River (1995)_. Whenever Yuri takes the time to care for the sick or injured (who, more often than not, are also poor enough that nobody bothers to care for them normally), it causes her patients to feel great love in a non-romantic sense for her. In one chapter, when she was looking after plague victims in a town where nobody knew that she was Prince Kail's concubine, it gets to the point where someone thinks that a girl such as her is the sort of woman Prince Kail should be romantically involved with.
-   In _Rurouni Kenshin_, Shougo Muto aka Amakusa rescued a Japanese boy from some bullies who hated him for being a Christian. The boy joined their Christian community and took up the name Shouzo... and pledged himself completely to Shougo's sister Sayo Magdaria, who nursed him back to health.
-   Happened in the backstory of _The Seven Deadly Sins_ between King and Diane. The young giantess found the amnesiac fairy boy collapsed near a river. She then took care of him until he got his memory back and they fell in love.
-   Subverted in _Shamanic Princess_ with Tiara tending to Graham's wounds. He goes in for the kiss, but is ultimately denied.
-   _Sword Art Online_:
    -   In the Alicization arc, this ends up happening to Alice Synthesis Thirty when Kirito is put in a catatonic state after defeating the Administrator and suffering severe brain damage due to Glowgen Defense Systems' assault on the Ocean Turtle. Spending six months taking care of a completely invalid patient led to her developing intense feelings for him. It is so strong that when Kirito's in-game wife/real-life girlfriend Asuna enters the Underworld simulation, she has an immediate hostile reaction to Alice when the subject of him comes up. It should be noted that although Kirito has lots of female admirers, Alice is the _only_ one Asuna had such a strong reaction to.
    -   In the same arc, a boy named Takashi dives into the Underworld along with the other Japanese VRMMORPG players to help fight, and encounters an Underworldian girl named Frenica, who is acting as a healer for the Human Guardian Army. She heals him, and he is instantly infatuated with her, and the two express a mutual desire to see each other again after the war.

    Fan Works 

-   This is the crux of Obi-Wan and Cody's romance in the _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ fanfic _By the Sea_. Obi-Wan finds Cody injured, and as he nurses Cody back to health, neither one can help but notice just how attractive the other one is. What gives this extra dimensions are Obi-Wan's internalized homophobia and insistence that Cody could not possibly enjoy his company, let alone return his feelings, Cody learning to trust Obi-Wan and eventually latching onto this human who so defies all of his people's preconceptions of humans, and the cultural dissonance between the two inadvertently pushing them along.
-   In the _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ Dark Fic _Cages_, this is what happens between Korea and Taiwan. When Imperial Japan colonizes their lands and brings a wounded Korea into his household, he tasks Taiwan with nursing him back to health. Then they begin to bond over their pasts and current situations...

-   In A.A. Pessimal's _Discworld_ themed _Gap Year Adventures_, three graduates of the Assassins' Guild School meet while trekking across Howondaland. There were only supposed to be two but they reluctantly pick up a third, who was badly hurt while traveling alone. The two girls realise they have to nurse him back to some sort of health while in a remote mission hospital in the middle of the jungle. Unresolved Sexual Tension happens and the gooseberry grins, leaves them to it, and wonders how long it will take the penny to drop for her friend who is nursing the casualty. Check out more **here.**
-   Rainbow Dash tries to deliberately set up this scenario in _How Every Shipfic Would Actually Happen_, by deliberately breaking her wing with an anvil and begging Twilight to heal it with her love. Twilight is having none of it and just drags her off to the hospital instead.
-   Happens in a _Warhammer 40,000_ Fanfic titled _The Lure of Chaos_. Especially notable, since it happens between an Inquisitor and a chaos worshipper
-   In _Making a Moment_ (a _Gravity Falls_ fanfic) Dipper tries to invoke this trope with Mabel, but it ends up getting deconstructed pretty hard. Quite simply, being sick is not attractive.
    
    _Yeah, no. He had no idea why he thought being sick would put him on the fast track to romance-ville. It was nice that Mabel was taking care of him but the interaction was pretty one-sided, and even if it wasn't he felt more disgusting than alluring. Even if he could open his eyes to stare longingly into hers, he doubted the crust in the corners of them, the sweat on his face, or the vomit on his breath really got her engines going._
    
-   In the fanfic _Maybe Sprout Wings_, Castiel rescues a traumatized and physically broken Dean not from literal Hell but rather from slavery. The two fall in love as Castiel nurses him back to health with the intention of granting him freedom.
-   In _A New Reflection_ Charlus Potter states that he fell in love with Dorea when she patched him up during the war against Grindelwald.
-   Having a patient/doctor relationship in this version, Jesse's attraction to Emily in _Ordinary Girl_ comes across in this.
-   In the _Person of Interest_ fanfic series Chaos, Will Ingram's fiance, who he meets while he's away, turns out to be a government agent assigned to protect him. Once they're safely back in the States, she tells him the truth, whereupon he says he doesn't want to see him. Problem is, he's not safe yet, and she's still got feelings for him. She ends up saving his life, as herself, and Finch suggests that to avoid this trope they don't communicate for several months. Several months later, they're still interested. Despite the fact that he initially knows almost nothing about her and she knows almost everything about him, it still works out.
-   Recognized by Keys (Jacob) in _The Piano Man: Act II_ as the reason why Twilight feels attracted to him.
-   Comes up in the _Pony POV Series_ in Shining Armor's side story. Private Garnet Chambers treats Private Running Gag for a concussion, during which he develops a crush on her; a later chapter shows that she apparently now returns his feelings. By the end of the fic, they're engaged to be married.
-   In _Sonic the Hedgehog_ _Prison Island Break_ it is very obvious that this has happened with serial rapist Shadow the Hedgehog, who is obsessed with Doctor Amy, and she is fond of him in return. It's rather creepy, especially when he threatens to rape her, and then begs her to leave because she's not safe from him, and then begs her _not_ to leave. He's highly protective of her, in a rather rapey way.
    -   Sonic and Amy as well, with them having graphic sex while he's handcuffed to an infirmary bed. Ironically unlike Shadow, Sonic _is_ taking advantage of Amy's vulnerable emotional state by showing sympathy, albeit not maliciously.
-   It happens at the beginning of _Revelations_. Túrante (the female vampire) is the only one who can save the life of Legolas (the male elf). She does so, by fixing his poisoned wound. The romance comes because of a Psychic Link between Túrante and Legolas; but this "connection" is also why Túrante chose to reveal herself and save his life.
-   Karin and Neji's relationship started off this way in _Son of the Sannin_. She offered to help heal him after he's badly injured by her teammate in a match and he bought her lunch as thanks a couple days later. Within two months they were dating.
-   _A Student Out of Time_: Nagito is treated by Kanata Inori for his lymphoma and it leads to the duo falling in love to the point where they want to get married after they both graduate Hope's Peak.
-   In _Suzumiya Haruhi No Index_, after Touma Kamijou defeats Teitoku Kakine in a fight and knocks him into a river, Kuyo Suo pulls him out and nurses him back to health. They start dating.
-   _Unbreakable Red Silken Thread_: Mentioned word-by-word by Emma, referring to Kitty's tendency for falling for helpless, needful boys when she gets an instant liking for Cameron.

    Films — Animation 

-   Implied in _Encanto,_ and confirmed by Word of God. Mirabel has an accident-prone father and a mother with healing powers; apparently they fell in love due to the many times that he had to go to her for help.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In an _An American Werewolf in London_, David falls in love with Nurse Price when she nurses him after a werewolf attack.
-   A brief version in _Atonement_. While working as a nurse, Briony has to tend to a French soldier near death. He's delirious and thinks she's an English girl he met in his childhood. Briony plays along with this. Just before he dies, he asks if she loves him and she says yes. The book and the film make it clear that she did, if only for a few moments.
-   _Back to the Future_ sees Doc Brown pointing out the trope. Marty is hit by a car and nursed by the teenage version of his mother Lorraine. This results in her developing a crush on him. In the original version of the timeline, that was how Lorraine fell in love with his father George, and Marty must Set Right What Once Went Wrong, or else he'll be erased from existence. The film offers a deconstruction of the concept, since in the original timeline (where this trope was the _only_ reason George and Lorraine got together), their marriage is shown to be rather rocky. Marty's work to repair the timeline includes building George's self-confidence and assertiveness, and he unintentionally encourages Lorraine to be honest with herself instead of repressing everything. As a result, when Marty returns to 1985, George and Lorraine are shown to be Happily Married since their relationship has a much more solid foundation.
-   In _Bedtime Story (1964)_, Freddy pretends to be psychosomatically disabled in order to con Janet out of $25,000. Freddy thinks Janet is in love with him, but Lawrence says her feelings for him are nothing more than pity. Although they do get married in the end.
    
    **Janet**: A person like Freddy just naturally attracts kindness, and gentleness, and affection.
    
-   _Body of Lies_ had Leonardo DiCaprio's character dating a Jordanian nurse.
-   _Brotherhood of the Wolf_. Jean-François developed an incestuous obsession towards his sister Marianne after she nursed him back to health. It doesn't end well for her.
-   Sidney Bliss in _Carry On Loving_ tries to invoke this trope by claiming that his unrequited love for Esme Crowfoot led him to try to drown in the canal. He tries to convince her even further by drenching himself in water from a fire bucket, but she still doesn't fall for it (she even asks him the name of the canal he threw himself into). Regardless, she lets him into her flat anyway.
-   Probably the world's only example of "Slap/Slap/Gauze/Gauze/Slap/Slap/Gauze/Gauze/Slap/Slap/Kiss": Jen and Lo of _Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_. They fight, Lo treats Jen for dehydration, Jen knocks him on the head with a rock, Lo treats her for dehydration _again_, and while he is treating her bloodied feet, she tries to regular assault him before she sexually assaults him (with his cooperation). Bonus points because Jen even makes the hissing noise as he picks a splinter out of her foot, but does not quite pull away.

-   _Faust: Love of the Damned_: Jade falls in love with John after acting as his psychiatrist for a brief period. Overlaps with Rescue Romance, since he also saved her from the bad guys before they fall into each other's arms.

-   Shows up in the film version of _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_. While Harry and Sirius have a talk, Hermione has a look at Ron's injured leg which he milks for good effect in the background.
    
    **Hermione:** It looks bad.
    
    **Ron:** So painful. Might have to chop it off.
    
    **Hermione:** I'm sure Madam Pomfrey can fix it.
    
    **Ron:** It's too late, it's useless. They'll have to chop it off.
    
-   In _Holiday on the Buses_, Blakey falls for Joan, the Red Cross Nurse at Pontins, after she treats his broken big toe.
-   Marion Ravenwood treating Indiana Jones' injuries on the ship in _Raiders of the Lost Ark_. They start to get flirty, then Indiana falls asleep.
-   Implied between the couple Doris and Harry in _Jönssonligan får guldfeber_. While Doris never has to treat him on-screen, she works as a nurse and does say that she knows all about "broken bones and explosion injuries" while looking lovingly at Harry, who just happens to be an injury-prone explosives expert.
-   _Just Like Heaven_: Played for Laughs during the opening montage establishing Elizabeth's hectic work day at the hopsital. An elderly patient proposes to her every time she checks on him, and every time she graciously accepts to humor him.
    
    **Elizabeth:** (_on the phone to her sister_) I'll have you know, I've already had two marriage proposals today.  
    **Mr. Clarke:** Marry me!  
    **Elizabeth:** Yes, Mr. Clarke. Yes, of course. (_to her sister_) Make that _three_!
    
-   Lampshaded furiously in _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_, in the Tale of Sir Galahad.
    
    **Galahad:** _They're_ doctors?!
    
    **Zoot:** Uh, they've had a basic medical training, yes.
    
-   _The Notebook_'s Allie meets Lon (technically her Second Love) while nursing him back to health after he's injured in World War 2.
-   The German movie _The Princess and the Warrior_ has the female protagonist, a nurse at a psychiatric hospital, masturbating one of her patients during the night shift. The scene is rather squick-inducing when you discover the patient is her father.

-   In _The Revengers_, Benedict and Elizabeth develop feelings for each other during the months she spends nursing him back to health following a near-fatal gunshot wound. She is not happy when he leaves her to continue his mission of vengeance. When he abandons his quest for vengeance at the end of the film, it is implied he is riding back to her.
-   Occurs in the _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_. Janet begins to bandage Rocky's wounds by ripping strips from the slip that she's wearing. Of course, more than just kissing occurs afterward.

-   _Skyscraper_: Sarah was a Navy doctor who treated FBI Agent Will for his injuries after the hostage situation went bad. Ten years later, they're married with kids.
-   _Suicide Squad (2016)_:
    -   Doctor Harleen Quinzel fell for the Joker while she was treating him at Arkham. She helped him escape, and he repaid her with electroshock therapy. Once her brain was broken, she cheerfully jumped into a bath of chemicals in order to receive the same transformation he did.
    -   After Doctor June Moon was possessed by the ancient witch known as the Enchantress, she fell into ARGUS custody. Amanda Waller put Rick Flag in charge of keeping her safe, knowing that the relationship would become romantic. This gave her control of Rick, June, and most importantly, the Enchantress. The Enchantress eventually slipped the leash and became the Big Bad of the movie.
-   Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese in _The Terminator_. Reese gets shot in the preceding scene and Sarah notices it after what must have been an hour or so seeing as how they drove until they ran out of gas. Cue Major Injury Underreaction from Reese. Sarah flips out, of course, and proceeds to bandage up his arm, apparently oblivious to the obvious Male Gaze she's getting. It's a pretty important scene for their relationship, as Sarah finds out Reese's First Name. Bonus points for a hissing sound.
-   _Tom Jones_, which gets extra points because Tom broke his arm while saving the girl from a mad horse.
-   _Tristan and Isolde_: Isolde treats Tristan's wounds. And also his hypothermia, by getting naked and cuddling him.
-   _Tucker & Dale vs. Evil_: After she hits her head while swimming, Dale takes Allison back to his and Tucker's cabin so she can recover.

Their romance blooms as he serves her breakfast, plays board games with her, and encourages her to follow her dreams.

-   In _Witness_ (1985) Detective John Book suffers a serious gunshot wound and is then nursed back to health by a young Amish woman. He falls for her.

    Literature 

-   A brief version in _Atonement_. While working as a nurse, Briony has to tend to a French soldier near death. He's delirious and thinks she's an English girl he met in his childhood. Briony plays along with this. Just before he dies, he asks if she loves him and she says yes. The book and the film make it clear that she did, if only for a few moments.
-   In _A Brother's Price_, Princess Odelia is injured by thugs and carried to safety and nursed by Jerin Whistler, who she notes is very beautiful. She decides to feign being more hurt than she is—though she _is_ hurt—in the hopes of seeing him some more and maybe getting a chance to steal a kiss. It doesn't work, but hey, First Girl Wins, more or less.
-   In _Castle Hangnail_, it's mentioned in passing towards the end that one of the Evil Sorceress's henchmen, after being taken to hospital to treat his injuries, fell in love with his nurse and became a completely reformed character.
-   In Lord Dunsany's _The Charwoman's Shadow_, the hero's sister gets a Love Potion and uses it on the duke. The duke falls _deathly_ ill. Terrified, she nurses him back to health, during which he falls in love with her.
-   S. Y. Agnon's short story _The Doctor And His Divorcee_ subverts this: all the patients are very, very fond of the beautiful nurse, but it’s the doctor who marries her.
-   Anne McCaffrey's _Dragonriders of Pern_:
    -   In _Dragonflight_, Lessa bandages up the wound F'lar received while dueling in her defense. Despite the fact that she does not like or trust him, she can't help but notice his rippling muscles, etc. Sexual tension ensues.
    -   Jaxom fell in love with and later married the nurse who treated him after he fell ill in _The White Dragon_.
-   _The Drowned Cities_: Toyed with in just about every way with Mahlia and Ocho, who meet when Sayle forces her to patch Ocho up at gunpoint. There's an instant connection, and each one develops some respect for the other—respect that manifests as Ocho wanting to burn her into the unit, and Mahlia deciding to save Ocho when she uses coywolv musk to lose an entire pack on his comrades. This later develops into a strange, Worthy Opponent vibe, and they ultimately ally at the end of the book.
-   The _Earth's Children_ series by Jean M Auel provides two examples in _The Valley of Horses_. Both brothers, Thonolan and Jondalar, endure catastrophic injuries from animal attacks (Thonolan from a woolly rhino, Jondalar from a cave lion) and end up married to the women who nurse them back to health. It's combined with Rescue Romance in Jondalar's case, as Ayla prevents the lion that attacked him from finishing him off (she had raised the lion from a cub) and carries him to safety with only her horse to assist her.
-   In Book III of _The Faerie Queene_, the lovely Belphoebe heals Squire Timias' arrow wound, only for the squire to develop a new wound from Cupid's arrow. He keeps his love to himself, though, knowing Belphoebe's celibacy and his own low station would make it impossible for them to be together.
-   This happened in _A Farewell to Arms_ (and this aspect of the story was based on Hemingway's own life).

-   In the autobiographical _Going Solo_, Roald Dahl recounts falling in love with a nurse who assisted him through a period of blindness after a plane crash in the North African desert during World War II. His infatuation ended once the bandages came off and he found that she was not quite as beautiful as he had imagined her to be.
-   Cited in _Gone with the Wind_, where Scarlett notices that even the plainest girls have no trouble getting engaged due to this trope.
-   Invoked by Chase in _The Half-Life of Planets_. When he's in the hospital to get his knee scoped, he plays up his weakness and anxiety over the future so the student nurse Patti will be attracted to him. It works well enough for them to briefly date before messily breaking up.
-   In _Heart of Steel_, ER doctor Julia has gotten romantically involved with two of her patients. In the case of Jim, she started dating him after he hounded her for an unknown period of time (she thought it was charming at the time), while in the case of Alistair she started warming up to him after he gets the shit beaten out of him trying to protect her.
-   Kerowyn and Eldan in _Heralds of Valdemar_'s _By the Sword_ by Mercedes Lackey more or less begin their romance by patching one another up, and Kero hangs a lampshade in the process.

    -   Ultimately subverted in _Catching Fire_. Katniss takes care of Gale after he's been whipped and appears to be making the choice to be with him... only to have her first thought when she goes to bed be that she wants Peeta to be in bed with her.
-   A variation in the Dick Francis novel _In The Frame_ where the protagonist meets a former nurse, who had cared for an older man's terminally ill wife, then after her death had married and cared for him until his death. Her home had been burgled in a manner suspiciously similar to the protagonist's cousin, which sets the mystery going.
-   _Lensman_ ("Galactic Patrol"). When Lensman Kimball Kinnison is severely wounded, his admiral orders that the most attractive nurses in the Patrol attend to him, figuring he'll inevitably fall in love with one, so she might as well be a looker. The doctor criticises this popular belief, pointing out that while patients fall for their nurses, the reverse seldom happens because the nurses aren't seeing the patient at their best. Nevertheless the stunning Clarissa MacDougall attends to the handsome hero, and sure enough, the two proceed to ... annoy the hell out of each other. It's not until considerably later that they start to develop a respect for each other and then fall in love.
    -   In this case, it later turns out to be a bit more complex, since Kimball and Clarissa's marriage has been planned as part of the Arisian plan to produce humans psychically powerful enough to become Third Stage Lensmen. The number of people—or rather, entities—who had an interest in getting them together is rather high...
    -   It also goes deeper than the skin. Surgeon-Marshal Lacey isn't picking his nurses on the basis of their looks, but on their skeletal structure—he has a theory that the skeleton tells all, and that a more "perfect" skeleton indicates greater human potential. In a way, it's a twist on phrenology but it's justified in-universe (unknown to him) because of the fact that the Arisian breeding program has created the acme of both physical AND psionic/mental perfection in its penultimates, so of course the best skeletons will "match".
-   In _Living Dead in Dallas_, the second of The Sookie Stackhouse Mysteries books, Eric pulls bits of glass out of Sookie's arm and bandages her up.
-   Lampshaded/deconstructed in _Me Before You_; Louisa's sister accuses her of this almost verbatim. Later, Lou realizes that she is in fact in love with Will, but it seems to be a genuine, healthy sort of love borne out of their personal, emotional connection rather than any sort of desire to 'mother' him. Things still don't turn out as hoped, however.
-   Gender flipped in _The Nightingale (Kristin Hannah)_, between Gaëton and Isabelle. He patches her up after getting shot, and they get it on. Finally.
-   _On the Spectrum_: Clara's dad was a surgeon who treated her mom and then fell in love with her. It caused a scandal because her mom was eighteen and his patient, and he lost his medical license. After their marriage fell apart when Clara was a toddler, her dad moved to Europe to start a new life as an academic, and she barely saw him after that.
-   In the Miss Marple novel _A Pocket Full of Rye_, Percival Fortescue met his wife Jennifer when she nursed him through pneumonia. Played with in that Jennifer didn't fall in love with him, but took advantage of his feelings as his father had caused hers to go bankrupt and she believed she could take revenge by marrying him and inheriting his father's money.

-   _Underground_ Zig Zags the relationship as Andrew and Robyn's dynamic is unconventional. Technically Robyn is not Andrew's patient, yet he is treating her off the books and he does see her as his patient. Andrew even fights with himself over his feelings being wrong, yet they do fall in love.

He proposed to her the next day and devoted himself to caring for her throughout her treatment, with her family even nicknaming him "Saint Jeffrey". They began wedding planning in earnest once Amanda was declared cancer-free. It ends up being deconstructed, as Amanda was noted by a few people close to her as having "changed" after recovering from her life-threatening illness, becoming tougher, more focused on her own happiness and less certain about the direction her life was taking. Even Jeff eventually admits that once Amanda was less frail and no longer dependent on him for support, he started to question if they were truly right for each other; it's implied Amanda was having similar thoughts, such as confiding in her sister Charlotte that she worried Jeff only proposed _because_ she got sick.
-   In the _Warrior Cats_ book _River of Fire_, a kittypet named Velvet comes to the ThunderClan camp looking for help after she was burned when her house caught fire. She and the medicine cat Alderheart start to develop feelings for each other, but ultimately both of them accept that it wouldn't work out due to their different lifestyles, and Alderheart's calling as a medicine cat means too much to him to break his vow and take a mate.
-   In _Wraith Squadron_ from the _X-Wing Series_, the Wraiths speculate when one of their own, Falynn, verbally defends another behind his back. One says she's sweet on him. Another says she is merely responding to his pain, like to a hurt animal, and she wants to nurse him back to health. They lay down bets. A third says she thinks it's a little from Column A, a little from Column B, and some women see a man who is a mess, feel the urge to repair his problems, and then fall in love with him while they're working on him.
    
    "Emotional distress as an attractant. Say, Tyria, I have a sharp pain in my childhood memories."
    
    "What a terrible line. I wish I'd thought of it."
    

    Live-Action TV

-   Subverted in "The Nurse Who Loved Me", by Failure and A Perfect Circle. The speaker is a man in a hospital who imagines that he and his nurse share a romance because she brings him drugs.

    -   A light version of this could be interpreted to happen in _Avatar: The Last Airbender_: the first thing Aang sees after waking up in the iceberg is Katara’s face as she helps him up and makes sure he’s okay; this scenario is repeated after he is exhausted from entering the Avatar State and after he is nearly killed by Azula’s lightning and Katara uses her vial of spirit water to heal him; Aang dutifully spends the series falling head-over-heels for her.
    -   _The Legend of Korra_ has a belated version revealed in _Turf Wars_ where Korra admits she fell in love with Asami, who took care of her when she was physically and emotionally broken at the end of Book 3.
-   This is pretty much how Jay Sherman of _The Critic_ met his first wife, who fell for him while he was in a full body cast and unable to speak. Her love faded away as soon as the bandages came off, though.
-   _The Fairly OddParents!_: At the end of Tootie's first appearance, she tries to invoke this. Unfortunately, she tries to feed Timmy the food that made him sick in the first place.
-   _Harley Quinn (2019)_: Inevitably for a show based around Harley Quinn, this comes up quite a bit.
    -   As standard for the character, Harley first met the Joker when he was assigned as her patient in Arkham Asylum. He told her sob stories to buy her sympathy and make her think only she could help and love him, which let him take advantage of Harley's own wish of being needed by someone.
    -   It happens again to an amnesiac Joker who falls in love with the nurse Bethany who found him in the rubble of Joker tower. Their relationship is such picture-perfect suburbia happiness that it disgusts people reading his mind. When Joker regains his memories, he breaks it off at first but realizes how happy he was together with Bethany and goes back to ask her to take him back.
    -   Retroactively and double-sided example between Harley and Ivy. In this version, Ivy was Dr. Harleen's patient when she still worked at Arkham Asylum and she was the one who helped Ivy work through her misanthropy. Years later, Ivy takes care of Harley after she's an emotional mess after breaking up with Joker. When they have a temporary falling out, Harley even rashly accuses Ivy of preferring her when Harley needed to rely on her. Eventually, the two realize they love each other more than platonically.
-   On _King of the Hill,_ the only woman Cotton ever really loved was a Japanese nurse who took care of him after the war. Years later he returns to Japan to find her again and discovers that they had a son after he was forced to leave. Worth noting that his second wife was also his nurse decades later in the VA hospital.

    Real Life 

-   There have been a number of documentaries made about a group of badly disfigured British WW2 veterans who married their nurses. The long time the soldiers spent in recovery let the nurses get to know them and see past the scars. In this case, too, the nurses were explicitly told that crossing the nurse/patient barrier was acceptable under the circumstances if they wished to — the men had been so horrifically disfigured that it was thought that no other woman would marry them. Pretty much any war up to the 1991 Gulf War (nursing stopped being viewed as a female-dominated field around that time if not earlier) has had a movie or five built around this trope.
-   The patient falling in love with the doctor variation occurs quite often for psychiatrists, due to the fact that a therapist-patient relationship can last years and that the patient is spilling out his soul for most of that relationship. For this reason, therapists are forbidden to have relationships with their patients even _years_ (in some places, up to a decade) after the patient stops being their patient.
-   Nightingale herself took a _very_ dim view of this, nurses who did it, and hospitals that tolerated it.
    -   She was herself, however, a popular muse of the age, and the mythology of her life implies her patients fell in love with her (though the reality was probably vastly exaggerated).
-   In an attempt to avert this trope, when Clara Barton formed a nursing service during the American Civil War (which eventually became the American Red Cross), she specified that all the women who applied as nurses be "at least 30 and plain-looking."
-   Red Pollard, Seabiscuit's most famous jockey, was crushed in a fall while riding another horse and spent months in the hospital trying to re-grow a rib cage. He later married his nurse.
-   There is one religious institution on US federal grounds: a convent by a civil war hospital. The union was having trouble with nurses who would marry sick/dying patients in order to inherit their money. Eventually to stop the lawsuits from family members (among other things) nuns were brought in as nurses to keep the fraud and Florence Nightingale effect from continuing.
