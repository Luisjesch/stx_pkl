Just sign on the dotted line, Mr. President.

**Michael:** My father made him an offer he couldn't refuse.  
**Kay:** What was that?  
**Michael:** Luca Brasi held a gun to his head, and my father assured him that either his brains or his signature would be on the contract.

Sometimes a bad guy wants something done, something they can't do themself; none of their own men can do it either, for any of a number of possible reasons. So what's a bad guy to do? Why, get in touch with someone who _can_ do it and make them an Offer They Can't Refuse.

There are a number of reasons this would work:

-   Something dearly important to the Hero is held at stake:
    -   If the Big Bad has a loved one held hostage, or threatens to do something nasty to them if the hero refuses.
    -   If it's the Hero's own life that's on the line.
    -   If it's implied that something bad will happen to the Hero's cherished family house or business legacy if they refuse.
    -   An all-time Soap Opera favorite is the treatment or cure for the Delicate and Sickly loved one.
    -   I Will Punish Your Friend for Your Failure.
-   If the Big Bad is blackmailing the hero in some way, using some past actual or perceived fault or failure of the hero as leverage against them in order to make them do the job for them.
-   If the Hero and Big Bad are fighting a common threat for a change.
    -   Sometimes it's this new threat who has taken the Hero's loved ones hostage, or otherwise done enough to justify a Roaring Rampage of Revenge.
    -   If it's the _Big Bad's_ loved ones who are held hostage.

Either way, it's clear That Wasn't a Request. It usually turns out that by taking up the offer, the person on the short end of the bargain has been advancing some form of Evil Plan orchestrated by the Big Bad, and there's at least a fifty-fifty chance that the bad guy will double-cross the hero at some point along the way, usually in a You Have Outlived Your Usefulness moment. If it's the hero who was "persuaded" to accept the offer, this often leads to an all-guns-blazing assault on the bad guy, either to get revenge on them, rescue the loved one, or both. This "offer" is also not likely to work so well on Sociopathic Heroes or The Unfettered, who rarely care about any collateral damage incurred while exterminating their foes.

The trope name comes from the movie _The Godfather_ where Don Vito Corleone is always making people offers (such as letting one of his favorites star in a movie or signing a business over to him) with dire consequences attached if they are refused (like, say, a bullet in the head, getting put in the hospital, or having the head of the person's prized horse being delivered to his bed).<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 

Compare Enemy Mine, in which the bad guy accompanies the hero, and Appeal to Force, where one party's having more power to inflict violence on another decides one's bargaining position rather than questions of justice and logic. The Face of the villain's team is likely the one who'll be appointed to make the formal offer. Also see My Way or the Highway, You Owe Me and Leonine Contract.

In real life, particularly in Hispanic countries, this is known as "Plata o Plomo?", literally "Silver or Lead?"; i.e. your choice is between taking a bribe or taking a bullet between the eyes.

Wikipedia states that political philosophy calls situations like this a "throffer", a threat mixed with an offer such as, "Kill this man for cash or I'll kill you."

For an offer that you _literally_ cannot refuse, see But Thou Must!.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Bleach_: Inoue Orihime is forced to work for the Big Bad after he holds her friends hostage, without them even knowing about it.
-   This is essentially the basis of Alucard's role as a Sociopathic Hero in _Hellsing_. Although the audience isn't given all the details, it's revealed in a crucial flashback that much of the story of _Dracula_ really did happen, right up until Van Helsing had Dracula defeated and at his mercy. From here, it seems the heroes made Dracula an offer he couldn't refuse, and so the Hellsing organization's ultimate weapon was born.
-   This is essentially how the contracts are made in _My-HiME_. Set up a situation where the HiME-to be faces a lethal threat from an Orphan, then offer her the power to fight it along with a vaguely defined price to be paid in future. None of them refuse.
-   _Can't Defy the Lonely Girl_: Egawa ensnares Sakurai in a deal by promising to send a letter of recommendation for her in return for getting Honda to come to school.When Honda learns this, she in turn tasks Sayaka with doing favors for her in return for her attendance.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_:
    -   Dr Marcoh is forced into cooperating with a plan to destroy the whole country because the homunculi promise to wipe out his whole village if he doesn't.
    -   Edward, in episode 29, is forced to remain a state alchemist even after he announces his resignation due to the homunculi threatening to harm Winry if he doesn't. This is used in a similar fashion against Mustang, who has the well-being of his whole team (Hawkeye most of all) resting on his willingness to comply, although he never threatens resignation. (They both find their own ways around it.)
    -   Due to above, Ed is forced to cooperate with Kimblee's attempts to hunt down Scar and Marcoh, using Winry as a leverage point. Kimblee even offers Ed a philosopher's stone in exchange for committing mass murder on the Briggs frontier, though Kimblee is unaware at the time that Ed and Al have already vowed to never use a philosopher's stone due to its grisly nature. This actually leads to Edward escaping his contract; Winry is able to fake her own kidnapping and get away to safety, and a few episodes/chapters later, Ed (unintentionally) fakes his own death, letting both disappear off the map for a couple months.
-   Averted during Part 4 of _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_. When Highway Star orders Rohan to call Josuke in order to lure him into the Stand's trap or else it'll suck him empty of his nutrients, he replies:
    
    **I refuse**. What I like to do the most is saying NO to people who consider themselves extremely good.
    
-   This happens a lot in _Yu-Gi-Oh!_:
    -   Implied by Kaiba's goons when Yugi's grandpa asks what would happen if he should refuse Kaiba's offer to duel.
    -   Pegasus does it twice; once by stealing Grandpa's soul, forcing Yugi to enter the Duelist Kingdom tournament, and again by stealing Mokuba's soul in order to get to Kaiba.
    -   In Battle City, Marik takes control of Tea and Joey so he can force Yugi into a duel for the Millennium Puzzle and his Slifer the Sky Dragon Card. Before that, he, via Bandit Keith, steals the puzzle and chains it to a duel arena, where Yugi can get it back if he wins.
    -   During the KC Grand Championship arc, Kaiba gets a bad feeling about one of the competitors, Siegfried Lloyd, and starts gathering intel on him. When one of Siegfried's friends refuses to cooperate, Kaiba sends his goons to make said friend an offer that he can't refuse.
-   This is fairly common in _Puella Magi Madoka Magica_— something bad happens and Kyubey offers them a wish at the cost of becoming a Magical Girl. Although the circumstances there typically aren't deliberately arranged. Kyubey simply takes advantage of an opportunity when it is presented. Unlike when he deliberately manipulated Kyoko into trying to save Sayaka so that she would die and Homura would face Walpurgisnacht alone, forcing Madoka to make a contact.
-   In the _Ouran High School Host Club_ anime, Eclaire gives one to Tamaki: "If you accept to marry me, I will gladly give you the chance to reunite with your Missing Mom"
-   _Natsume's Book of Friends_: Multiple:
    -   Matoba threatens Natsume to expose his Psychic Powers to his foster parents unless he complies to help him find an enemy exorcist.
    -   Matoba tries to threaten Natsume into joining his clan but is interrupted by a disturbance outside.
-   An inverted heroic example occurs in _Outbreak Company_. In episode 12, Japan attempts to kill Shinichi after he attempts to stop their attempts at cultural warfare with Eldant. Both of their attempts fail, and after the second one Petralka threatens to cut off all diplomatic ties if the Japanese government attempted to kill him again, or hindered his work at introducing otaku culture to them. It seems to work, as Matoba later says that what Shinichi is doing may benefit them more in the long run, and for now at least, allows him to continue working without threatening his safety.
-   Many asked themselves why Viole from _Tower of God_ worked for FUG, and many believed it was because he identified with their ideology of revolution. However, it turns out that the rings Yu Hansung gave to Bam's old team were tracking devices so that FUG could blackmail Bam/Viole into working for FUG by threatening his friends lives.
-   In the first season of _Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds_, Rex Godwin's goal was to identify the suspected Signers using the Fortune Cup. However, after one likely suspect - Yusei - proved his incredible distrust in Godwin's generosity by turning down an offer of parole from prison, he realized convincing him would be hard. After _several_ prisoners were pardoned due to abuse by the corrupt warden, Yusei stole his D-Wheel from the impound lot - as Godwin expected, and Godwin ordered his friends in Satellite kidnapped, later having his henchman Jeagar telling Yusei that their safety would depend on his participation in the Fortune Cup. (Godwin was later convinced to release them early by his star and Yusei's rival Jack Atlas - who the winner of the tournament would duel in an exhibition match - who was getting _very_ suspicious of Rex's motives, and wanted to duel Yusei without any coercion being involved.)
-   _Variable Geo_: Soon after The Jahana Group becomes aware of the immensity of Satomi's spirit energy, they cause her brother's medical condition to relapse, to pressure her into entering the VG tournament. Then offers to cover the costs of the procedure needed to treat her brother, in exchange for her "cooperation".
-   In _Charlotte_, Yu is told to transfer to Hoshinoumi Academy, or else his cheating would be exposed.
-   In _One Piece_, invitations to Big Mom's tea parties are such offers. Should one dare refuse, the head of someone they've been involved with (friend, family member, etc) will be mailed to them a few days later, until they accept. This is why Sanji had no choice but to accept going to his Arranged Marriage with one of Big Mom's daughters.
-   _ViVid Strike!_: Einhart and Nove offer Fuka a job at the Nakajima gym and perks as free food and lodging as part of their recruitment after her initial refusal to join. They use the fact that Fuka needs the money to help support the orphanage and Fuka's recent loss of job as leverage in order for her to accept. This is a non-malicious example as Einhart sees potential in Fuka and genuinely wants to take her in as an apprentice.
    -   Another benevolent example again courtesy of Einhart. Upon learning that Rinne intends to quit being a martial artist, Einhart offers her a shot at her U-15 championship title, on the condition that she win against Fuka. This is so that not only would she uphold the promise of fighting Fuka, but to make a talented fighter such as her continue, and possibly find joy, in practicing martial arts.
-   _Psycho-Pass_: After Akane discovers that the Psycho-Pass System has puppeteers controlling the AI, they declare that if she assassinated them, the key members of the entire juridical (and effectively ruling) system in Japan, it would result in the total collapse of society. As an alternative, they offer her and her squad full pardons (for some, not all) if she'll just leave. Knowing that she can't open fire without becoming a mass-murderer of citizens, she takes it.
-   _Torture Princess: Fremd Torturchen_: In the first chapter, Elisabeth Le Fanu reincarnates Kaito Sena in a golem body and informs him he is to become her manservant—which is met with "Hard pass." After an intervening monster attack, during which Elisabeth's abilities as the eponymous Torture Princess are put on full display, she makes the offer again, this time clarifying that if he insists on returning to death, "then it will be by way of my methods."
    
    **Elisabeth:** What will it be? Make your choice. Butler? Or meat?  
    **Kaito:** Butler, please.
    
-   In _Death Note_, Rod Ross, a mob boss who's allied with Mello, wants his subordinate Jack to get the Shinigami Eyes, thereby halving his lifespan and allowing him to see anyone's real name. When Jack balks at it, Ross says that if Jack agrees, Rod will make him his right-hand man, and if Jack refuses, Rod will kill him right then and there.

-   A downplayed example in _Revival_: Ibrahim is forced to relay information to the CIA to protect his imprisoned brother, but this never affects the overall plot much.
-   _Rough Riders_: It's heavily implied in _Nation_ that many of the future members of the Rough Rider cells did not so much volunteer for the team out of a sense of patriotism or moral obligation, but because they were blackmailed by the government.
-   _Wonder Woman_ Vol 1: When Paula von Gunther first refused to work for the Nazis they tortured her husband to death, then they took her toddler aged daughter hostage and requested they work for them again with the implicit threat that they'd do the same to Gerta as they had to Gottfried.

    Comic Strips 

-   Lucy makes a non-lethal - but _very_ unsubtle version of this towards Linus in a _Peanuts_ comic strip while both are watching television:
    
    **Lucy:** Why don't you be a good little brother and go make me a jelly bread sandwich? If you don't I'm going to leap on you and pound you right through the floor! So why don't you make me that jelly bread sandwich? Huh? Please, dear brother?  
    _\[Linus gets up to get it\]_  
    **Linus:** When someone asks you that nicely, how can you refuse?

-   _Zootopia_: As part of its parody of The Godfather, Duke Weaselton claims he was made an offer he couldn't refuse. Money.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _12 Monkeys_. James Cole, a habitual criminal in the future, is 'volunteered' by the scientists to go back to the past to investigate the virus that now forces what's left of humanity to live underground.
    
    **Scientist:** For a man in your position, an opportunity not to volunteer would be a mistake...
    
-   The film _30 Minutes or Less_ is about two idiots who want to rob a bank getting a very unlucky pizza delivery boy to do it for them, by strapping a bomb to his chest (effectively giving him a time limit as well).
-   In _Bad Boys II_, big bad Tapia convinces his business associate to sign over his business to him by having his bodyguard brought back to him chopped up in pieces in a drumcan, with the implied threat that he can either sign the paper or be next.
-   This trope is subverted by _Commando_, in which the villains attempt to coerce John Matrix into assassinating someone by holding his daughter ransom... And Schwarzenegger's character just ignores the mission and kills them all to rescue her.
-   _Deep Cover_: Before Russell testifies at the House Judiciary Committee, Agent Carver threatens to charge Betty with money laundering unless Russell gives glowing praise of the DEA and its investigation. Russell complies with these demands, but manages to screw them over another way.
-   Weaponized for laughs in _Doctor Strange_ where the title character essentially snares Dormammu in a Time Loop Trap until he gives up.
    
    **Doctor Strange:** Dormammu, I've come to bargain.
    
-   _Escape from New York_:
    -   The government injects something into Snake Pliskin's neck and tell him he can either go in and rescue the President in a set amount of time, or else have his carotid arteries explode.
    -   They do this to Snake again in _Escape from L.A._. They inject him with a virus that will supposedly kill him in 12 hours unless he brings the President's Rebellious Spirit teenage daughter back. Ultimately subverted as the virus is just a fast-acting version of the common flu.

-   In _From Russia with Love_, Rosa Klebb gives Tatiana two options: Either participate in a plot to sexually entrap James Bond, or get shot.
-   _The Godfather_ is the trope namer. When Woltz fails to accept such an offer, his prize horse's head is severed and is placed in bed with him. Don Vito's preferred approach had three stages: First, make a fair or even generous offer. Second, if the first offer is refused, _lower_ your initial offer, or even offer nothing. Third, if the person still doesn't take the hint, threaten the person with violence, possibly harming something that matters to him to make the point.
    -   The initial offer is often just "You'll have my friendship, and I'll owe you a favor." If you know Don Vito, you know that that's worth a lot more than haggling for a specific price.
    -   The novel implies that Vito uses a different approach for someone with "real balls", someone who would be willing to lose everything over a matter of honor. Judging from the way Vito and Michael interact with other important mafiosi, the approach seems to be to simply make an offer; if the offer is refused, decide whether to accept the refusal, or go to war. But don't bargain (which would be seen as weakness) or threaten (which would be an intolerable insult).
    -   The trope is subverted in this film when Michael assures Fredo that he'll make Moe Greene "an offer he can't refuse". In fact, Michael makes the offer in a confrontational and condescending way, almost _forcing_ Greene to refuse it—which he does. Apparently, Michael wanted Greene to turn him down, giving him an excuse to arrange his assassination for the movie's climax.
        -   In the novel, it's stated that Moe had occasionally publicly humiliated Fredo Corleone, and that Tom Hagen realized when the offer was made that Moe was a dead man, because the Corleone family DID NOT WISH to convince him. Michael is intent on avenging the family dishonor.

-   In _Jupiter Ascending_, Balem subjects Jupiter to this: he promises her that if she abdicates the throne, he'll wait to harvest Earth until after she's dead and he'll let her family live. Subverted when she realizes that even if he does kill her and her family, he can't harvest Earth if she doesn't abdicate, whereas if she does, then they're _all_ animals for the slaughter. She thus decides that, if the choice is between her and her family being murdered or being harvested with the rest of the Earth, she'll pick the option that _hurts_ Balem.
-   _Margin Call_: Tuld gets his fixer Carmello to blackmail Eric Dale to keep him quiet after his firing the day before, threatening to have his severance taken away. Eric begrudgingly does what they ask because of the insane reward on offer if he plays ball.

They make him regret refusing their offer.
-   In _The Princess Bride_ they demand the key to the main gate from a man who says he has no such key. Wesley turns to Andre the Giant and tells him to tear his arms off. The gatekeeper pulls out the key. "Oh you mean THIS key."
-   _Rapture-Palooza_: The Beast propositions Lindsey, which she turns down immediately. He says that's fine, but he'll now kill everyone she knows, so Lindsey agrees to sleep with him. Rather than go through with it though she plots with her boyfriend to kill him.
-   In _Silver Lode_, McCarty tells Ballard that he wants all Ballard's assets, or he'll kill him. Ballard suspects he'll kill him regardless.
-   In _Sin City_, Marv and John Hartigan are both made to plead guilty for the villains' crimes, using threats against loved ones.
-   _Star Wars_: In _The Empire Strikes Back_, Lando Calrissian is forced to betray his friends in exchange for the safety of Cloud City. Unfortunately, the offer was given by _Darth Vader,_ so naturally Lando gets double-crossed — Vader alters the deal, and warns "pray I don't alter it further".
-   _Theresa & Allison_: Some humans have become vampires' blood slaves as the other option was them being killed in one "meal".

The man grabs a pen, airily comments that the criminal's extortion methods are flawed, jots down something on the contract and hands the paper back to the crook. When the mafia man looks at the document he realizes that, rather that signing with his name, the man has signed the contract with the words "I'm suicidal. Fuck off."

    Literature 

-   At the beginning of _The Dresden Files_ novel _Dead Beat_, Black Court vampire Mavra strong-arms Harry Dresden into finding a book of black magic for her, by threatening his friend Karrin Murphy. He takes the job, but at the end of the book makes a point of listing off all of the unsavory alternatives at his disposal which he _could_ have made use of if he were less moral, and informing her that if she ever tries something like this again, he will chuck his principles out the window and use every last one of those alternatives to come after her.
    -   Mavra has not appeared since. In addition, it wasn't an empty threat: in the book _Changes_, a different vampire did something similar, and Harry did indeed go to great lengths and compromise his principles to fix it.
-   In the Dale Brown novel _Warrior Class_, Big Bad Pavel Kazakov plans to ask Balkan nations to let him build an oil pipeline through their territory or get bombed by his stealth aircraft. He pulls this on a Russian Army Captain later, advising the man's silence lest his girlfriend and child come to harm.
-   Early in the Belisarius Series, we see the wife of the titular general fleeing assassins through the streets of Constantinople and ducking into a small eatery. She confronts the owners and slams a heavy purse on the table (her husband is quite wealthy) offering it insistently as rent for the shop, then pulls out a dagger (she grew up on the streets of Alexandria) and tells them "or take the knife, _in your fucking guts!_"
-   In _The Guardians_, this is a tactic demons commonly take to entice humans into a Deal with the Devil. They'll take a vulnerable loved one hostage or hire another human to kill them if they refuse.
-   A favoured tactic of the Daemon in recruiting its human agents. As just one example, it springs a prisoner from jail by cleaning his record, then, as he starts getting cold feet, reminds him that if it can jigger the records to clear him, it can also jigger them to put him back — as a child molester.
-   In _A Series of Unfortunate Events_ Count Olaf makes various offers like this to the Baudelaires. The most notable being in the first book when Violet has to marry Olaf or Sunny dies. She finds a third option.
-   In the Simon Scarrow novel _The Eagle's Prophecy_ (one book in a series) the Imperial Secretary, Narcissus, gives the centurions Macro and Cato a job retrieving three ancient prophecy scrolls from pirates, not even bothering to phrase it as an offer, saying, "I won't insult your intelligence by offering you the job. You will do it, or you will die." Narcissus says that he doesn't need a reason to have them killed, but in the previous book, Cato's cohort was sentenced to decimation (1/10 of the men, picked randomly, are killed; Cato was one of the ones selected to be killed), but the men that were chosen escaped, and Macro was implicated in the death of his cohort's commander.
-   In the first _Jack Blank_ book, Jazen Knight implies that the reason Jonas Smart exerts so much economic control over Machina's businesses is that he gives veiled threats that anyone who refuses would be accused of being a conspirator to the enemy Rüstov and subsequently treated as such.
-   In one _Callahans Cross Time Saloon_ story, narrator Jake Stonebender recalls the time a well-dressed fellow (he refuses to say more, 'lest certain ethnicities be offended) tried to make Callahan an 'offer he can't refuse''...so Callahan didn't bother refusing. And apparently, the gentleman's arms recovered in time.
-   In the sequel to _Those That Wake_, Arielle Kliest makes such an offer to Mal: Get the Old Man what he wants, or else.
-   In the _An Ember in the Ashes_, there are several. The Resistance offers to free Laia's brother if she spies for them at the military academy. Cain offers Elias "freedom of body and soul" if he participates in the Trials. The augurs offer to save Elias' life if Helene pledges herself to anyone who becomes the next Emperor.
-   _Warbreaker:_ The magic in this setting is powered by Biochromatic Breath, which can be transferred between people only by willful, intentional Command. The necessity of Intent means that you can't trick someone into giving up their Breath or take it by force, but there's nothing (except laws and ethics) stopping you from torturing someone until they are willing to give up their Breath just to make it _end_.
-   _The Reluctant King_: Fifth Plane demons are compelled to serve wizards by threatening to hold them inside a magic circle until sunlight enters it, killing them.
-   _Discworld_'s Lord Vetinari has a variant - An Appointment You Can't Miss. Whenever he feels there is a need to talk to someone, a secretary will helpfully swing by the fellow's residence and _remind_ them they have an appointment with His Lordship, no rush. However, as time passes, instead of a kind secretary, it will be Dark Clerks and Palace security who pass by, so while Lord Vetinari might not feel the need to rush, said fellow most certainly will.
-   _All The Skills - A Deckbuilding LitRPG_: Arthur is given a choice between keeping a Legendary-rank spell card away from the Baron, or having a red dragon hunt down and kill him and everyone he cares about.

-   _The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi_: Salima offers Amina a vast fortune to rescue her kidnapped granddaughter... and threatens to have her entire family killed if she doesn't accept.
-   _Worm_: This is one of Coil's modus operandi when it comes to "recruiting" people. Tattletale, for example, was cornered into an alley and threatened with getting her head blown to bits if she didn't accept his "job offer".
-   _Hive Mind (2016)_: Keith threatens to use the secrets of everyone on Amber's team against them if she doesn't cooperate with his plan to reclaim Olivia, up to and including telling Amber's nosy-hating parents that she is really a telepath.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _American Gods (2017)_: Variant. Mister World (representing the New Gods), offers Mister Wednesday (representing the Old Gods) a deal: In exchange for giving Wednesday a large amount of worshipers in North Korea, Wednesday will stop his plan to gain power in America. When Wednesday refuses the deal, the New Gods agree to leave peacefully, with the unspoken implication that they will then begin to prepare for war in earnest. Technical Boy demands to know why they don't just kill Wednesday now, while he's in their power. Mister World insists that Wednesday is old enough and has enough knowledge and wisdom that he deserves the respect of an honest deal instead of a Leonine contract.
-   In Season 3 of _Arrow_, Ra's al Ghul offers Oliver Queen the position of his heir of the League of Assassins. When Oliver asks what will happen if he refuses, Ra's tells him he's free to go, and even returns his captured friends as a gesture of goodwill. Unsurprisingly it's not that easy, and by the end of the episode when Oliver still hasn't reconsidered his offer, Ra's starts putting pressure on Oliver by dressing up as the Arrow and murdering people to turn the city against him. And that's just for starters.
-   _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_:
    -   In the "New Caprica" arc, President Baltar is forced to cooperate with the Cylon occupation authorities to give their presence an umbrella of legitimacy. After the human rebels start engaging in terrorist attacks against the Cylons and Les Collaborateurs, the Cylons force Baltar to sign an order for summary executions in reprisal. When he objects, they shoot Caprica Six for agreeing with Baltar, then threaten to kill him next (she can resurrect; Baltar can't). He signs it, which comes back to haunt him when he's later tried for war crimes and points out that he had no real choice but to comply.
    -   In "Blood on the Scales", Felix Gaeta and Tom Zarek organize a military coup against Adama and Roslin, capturing the former while the latter continues to coordinate the resistance against them. Gaeta insists that Adama be tried for his "crimes", and has Romo Lampkin dragged in to serve as Adama's defense counsel, a job he had previously fulfilled during Baltar's trial. Lampkin immediately recognizes what's up by suggesting that if he refuses, the two marines standing to the side will presumably use him for target practice.
-   _Better Call Saul_:
    -   As a job for Nacho, Mike has Tuco sent to prison by framing him for an armed robbery and assault. Tuco's uncle Hector wants Mike to reduce Tuco's sentence by admitting to the police that the gun Tuco had was actually Mike's. First Hector makes an offer of $5,000, then he sends armed thugs to Mike's house to strong-arm him into agreeing, and then he sends the Cousins in to threaten the lives of Mike's family, at which point Mike realizes he has no choice. When Mike has another meeting with Hector, Hector rescinds his initial monetary offer and says the deal is Mike agrees to recant his testimony to get Tuco's sentence reduced, and he gets to leave the building alive, although Mike is able to impress Hector enough to shake a $50,000 payment out of him.
    -   Early in season 4, Gus finds out that Nacho induced Hector's heart attack by swapping his medication with placebos. The Salamancas are extremely sadistic against those they consider their enemies, so Gus murders Arturo (another one of Hector's goons) in front of Nacho and threatens to let word of Nacho's treachery slip to them if he doesn't agree to be Gus's double-agent against them. Later on, Gus threatens the life of Nacho's father to keep him in line. Gus agreeing to leave Nacho's father in peace is what gets Nacho to agree to be executed.
-   _Breaking Bad_: During Season 4, the cartel starts strong-arming Gus into complete control of his meth operation. Gus refuses, but is forced to agree once they start killing his men and sabotaging his shipment trucks until he gives in. Of course, this is All According to Plan for Gus.
-   _Burn Notice_: Carla pulls this with Michael, he also manipulates some of the villains into doing this to his cover ID at the time. Indeed, it happens pretty much all the time in the series. Michael is often given this when he is to help the bad guy, or does this himself when he gets the bad guy to do what he wants.
-   _Crisis (2014)_ centers around these. The villains kidnap a bus full of children, then force their wealthy and powerful parents to perform dangerous and illegal missions in order to get their kids back.
-   Inverted in the _Doctor Who_ episode "Journey's End", where two groups of heroes attempt to keep the Daleks from carrying out their plan by threatening the destruction of Earth and the Crucible, respectively.

-   _Gotham Knights (2023)_: Lincoln thinks he has one when Stephanie's father gets arrested for illegal possession of prescription drugs (to give her addict mother), saying he will get the charges dropped if she won't give testimony on the Court of Owls. Stephanie however realizes this would mean her friends dying. After agonizing briefly over it, Stephanie refuses the offer, realizing she can't save her parents from themselves anyway.
-   _The Handmaid's Tale_: In "Testimony" when Fred's defense lawyer tried to defend him by saying June signed up for Handmaid "duty", she fires back that her only other "choice" was being sent to the Colonies, a slow death sentence. Of course, even without that, it would be irrevocable "consent" (e.g., selling herself into slavery).
-   _Lost_: Ben gets Jack to do his spinal surgery by also kidnapping Kate and Sawyer (Kate to control Jack, and Sawyer to control Kate, apparently).
-   _My Name Is Earl_:
    -   Referenced as Joy steals a wrestling costume from her half-sister's neighbor, in order to infiltrate the match and defeat Liberty. She steals the costume by shoving the owner of said costume into the trunk of her car.
    -   Played straight later, with Billie. She gets mad at Earl for focusing on the List instead of sex with her, so she steals the List and starts to undo the items Earl has already completed. Then she calls him, threatening to keep hurting people on the List if Earl doesn't choose her. Earl has no choice but to meet up with Billie.
-   In _Power Rangers Lost Galaxy_, a group of villains are auctioning off the Pink Ranger's quasar saber. Astronema (actually, Karone) interrupts by making a Whammy Bid, which she immediately raises to "all of you get to live".
-   _Prison Break_: The plot of the entire third season has the villainous Company kidnapping Michael Scofield's girlfriend and Lincoln Burrows' son, and threatening to kill them unless the brothers break an inmate out of a Panamanian prison.

The second season has Anna receive one too, but from Voss's partner in the cartel he ran the cocaine for. We earlier see one Mexican police officer refusing a similar offer, and dying for it.
-   Parodied in _The Red Green Show_, a Canadian sketch show. In one episode's Possum Lodge Word Game, Red tries to get demolition enthusiast Edgar K.B. Montrose to guess the word "fuse". He successfully says the word as part of this phrase...
    
    **Red:** If you forcibly join two things together, that's called...  
    **Edgar:** A Shotgun Wedding! _\[Red looks confused\]_ Well, it's kinda like an offer you can re**fuse**!
    
-   Parodied in an _SCTV_ spoof of _The Godfather_: Guy Caballero says he will make another character an offer that will "be to his liking."
-   In the ninth season of _Spooks_, Lucas North is blackmailed by a man who threatens to reveal that he isn't really Lucas North — he stole another man's identity to escape justice after being involved in an embassy bombing.
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_:
    -   In "The Circle", Odo deputizes petty crook and gambler Quark because he needs the Ferengi's underworld contacts to gather information on who's supplying weapons for a coming Civil War. Quark finds this Actually Pretty Funny until Odo points out the alternative — he locks up Quark for obstruction at a time when Quark might need to get off the space station in a hurry.
    -   In "Civil Defense", the crew accidentally trips an old security program which will destroy the station, killing thousands, if it's not shut down in time, and which can only be deactivated by the station's former commander Gul Dukat. In this case, Dukat didn't create the situation, but he's more than happy to use it to his advantage, refusing to help unless they allow him to reestablish a "permanent Cardassian presence" on the station. It ends up backfiring on Dukat rather spectacularly, however, when he tries to beam out to give them "time to think about it" and the program perceives him as trying to abandon the station in a crisis and reacts by trapping _him_ on the station and locking out his access codes, forcing him to work with the others on disabling the program in order to save his own life.
-   The pilot episode of _Tales from the Darkside_ centers on Gideon Hackles, owner of the only store in a small farming town. His store only runs on credit, and thus he has the whole town under his heels. He establishes that his only other love besides his money is Halloween; specifically, because he turns his home into a haunted mansion of ghoulish animatronics and sounds. He does this as a little game with the town's children, as anyone who steps through has the chance to find their parent's I.O.Us and free themselves of their debts. Of course, what usually happens is the kids bolting out of the house screaming in terror. What qualifies it for this trope is that Hackles doesn't even offer this as something the parents could do as a chance to free themselves of their debts. He _orders_ them to bring the children, because he'll take their farms if they don't play ball.
-   _Treadstone_: An indigenous Columbian chieftain is offered money by mercenaries from a mining company to buy his people's traditional land. He refuses, and they beat him up for it. The mining company also has hired Treadstone to assassinate him if he rejected this offer.
-   _The Wheel of Time (2021)_: The Seanchan demand people whom they have conquered publicly swear oaths of fealty. Any who refuse are immediately killed in a brutal fashion, so as you would expect few reject the demand.

    Music 

-   "Stop Talking About Comic Books or I'll Kill You", by Ookla The Mok.
-   The Jon and Vangelis song/salute to the golden age of movies, "Friends of Mr. Cairo" has a mock scene from _The Maltese Falcon_ that has the Peter Lorre imitator ask Sam Spade, "You going to make us an offer we can't refuse?" It actually works.
-   In his version of "Mack the Knife," Frank Sinatra says that Ol' Blue Eyes plus Quincy Jones equals this trope:
    
    But with Quincy's big band, right behind me  
    Swinging hard, Jack, I know I can't lose  
    When I tell you, all about Mack the Knife babe  
    It's an offer, you can never refuse  
    

    Myths & Religion 

-   In _The Bible_, Judges 14, when some Philistines find that they are unable to answer a riddle Samson has asked them, they threaten his wife in order to get the answer.
-   _The Book of Mormon_ has multiple _heroic_ examples:
    -   Ammon is attacked by the king of the Lamanites, who was angry about Ammon's preaching and influence over his son. It ends with Ammon standing over him and the king offering whatever he wants in exchange for mercy; Ammon demands the release of his fellow missionaries from prison.
    -   Captain Moroni outmaneouvres, overpowers, and surrounds an invading Lamanite army, then demands that they surrender their weapons and vow never to attack again.
        
        **Moroni:** Now as ye are in our hands we will spill your blood upon the ground, or ye shall submit to the conditions which I have proposed.
        
-   One criticism of Christianity, as voiced by Christopher Hitchens, says that the offer of redemption (through accepting Christ's sacrifice on your behalf) amounts to this, since if refused, the person goes to Hell.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Former WWE Superstar Charles Wright used this when he was using his "The Godfather" persona. However, instead of being a mafioso, he was a pimp, and his "offer you can't refuse" was to either step in the ring with him for their match, or the opponent could take their pick of any of the fine hos he always brought to the ring with him. Needless to say, it was very rare that the offer was refused.

    Roleplay 

-   One _Embers in the Dusk_ sidestory has a captured Jotunheim rebel who only joined the rebellion because the old Governor's regime sent his wife to a concentration camp, and the new one didn't return her home. The Avernite questioning him explains that his wife died in the camp, but gave birth to the rebel's daughter a month before that. While the rebel will be shot in any case, it is up to him to determine whether the child will be growing up in the overcrowded and understaffed (thanks to the rebellion) facilities of Jotunheim, or the comparable paradise of an Avernus orphanage.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _BattleTech_ has a rare example used for humor: several Solaris stables consider trying to use organized crime families to threaten Kai Allard-Liao after his policies proved unpopular because he paid his crews higher wages and provided safer employment contracts, which cut into their profits. Someone eventually realize that they cannot even _hope_ to think of threatening him because:
    -   Kai is close friends with the Prince of the Federated Commonwealth, the largest nation in Inner Sphere.
    -   He is also friends with the heir-designate to the Coordinator of the Draconis Combine, the second-largest and most militaristic nation.
    -   Kai hiself is the _actual_ heir to the St. Ives Compact, a small but soverign nation (and he has a viable claim to the throne of the Capellan Confederation on top of that).
    -   Besides that, Kai is also the two-time Champion of Solaris.
    -   He's the nephew of the commander of the Kell Hounds, one of the most elite mercenary units around.
    -   He is the single greatest Mechwarrior ever tested on a Wolf's Dragoons proving ground, and is personlly known and respected by the elite mercenary unit's commanders.
    -   Finally, he is one of a _vanishingly_ small number of people who has the unflinching respect of Clan Jade Falcon (after killing well over fifty of them, but that just made them respect him more because their culture values talented warriors).
        
        A rough tally of the number of Mechwarriors willing to bring 'Mechs to help Kai if he asked is approximately _five regiments_ (540-ish Battlemechs) plus at least another fifty to seventy five Power Armor\-wearing Super Soldiers. The odds stacked against the criminals are so hilariously one-sided that the stable masters sheepishly drop the idea.
        
-   _Magic: The Gathering_:
    -   In the Amonkhet block, the Big Bad Nicol Bolas gives Liliana Vess the option of abandoning the Gatewatch to work under him in exchange of knowing how to control the Chain Veil. Her other option is death. Naturally, she begrudgingly chooses the former.
    -   Literally the name of the Brokers Villain Song, in which they promise safety with none-to-subtle threats if one does refuse.
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   This is standard operating procedure for the Tau: "Join us or die". They still have the moral high ground, however, since every other major faction leaves off the "join us or" part.
    -   This trope happens every time an Inquisitor makes a "request". Unless you are _very_ highly placed or connected, death is the best thing that's going to happen if you refuse.

    Video Games 

-   In _A Hat in Time_, upon crash-landing in the Subcon Forest, local malevolent spirit the Snatcher immediately traps the protagonist and makes her a deal: she can sign away her soul to the Snatcher, getting it back once she's done some errands for him, or die on the spot. You can refuse, whereupon the Snatcher will reiterate that it's sign or die: refuse enough times and he'll kill you on the spot.
-   In _Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood_, Leonardo da Vinci's Real Life cooperation with the Borgia, given his good leanings and the villainy of the Borgia, is explained away as his being forced to work for them.
-   Midway through the first _Baldur's Gate_, you're given the option of joining the titular city's thieves guild. If you decide not to (whether because you're a good guy or just not interested), the guildmaster makes it perfectly clear that he runs on a "join or die" policy. Cue boss fight.
-   On contrary to what some say, in _BlazBlue_, Litchi's turn to NOL was based on something she can't refuse rather than utter selfishness. Terumi threatens to harm Arakune before he has a chance to be cured, and went so far to have Relius detain him. While Litchi doesn't know that directly, Terumi makes implications about that scenario and what would happen to him if Litchi doesn't cooperate: he either kills Arakune for being a 'nuisance' monster, or he'll eventually wither and die anyway, and no one was willing to help Litchi in her efforts to cure Arakune's condition. To make things worse, her life is on the line as well, not getting the cure means she will succumb to the same corruption afflicting Arakune and die, leaving everyone else she loves in despair. Not to mention, throughout the offering, Terumi constantly pressed on Litchi's kind-hearted nature and desire to help everyone she knows (only she hasn't given up on Arakune), exploiting nearly everyone else's ignorance of her plight or their dismissal of her as 'a crazy woman trying to cure her blob-boyfriend who is already a lost cause and better off dead'. Yes, there's a lot more in line than mere obsession here.
-   _Chest_: Zong didn't want to fight the Demon Lord, but he had no choice because Prime Minister Andre threatened to ban toilets if he refused.
-   _Conker's Bad Fur Day_: Don Weaso applies this to Conker twice. The first time occurs when Conker stole his money, he sends him on a suicide mission to repay him. If Conker lives, he could go free as long as he was out of Weaso's territory. If he dies, then meh, no biggie. Conker manages to survive, but just as he's about to head home after the War Chapter, he runs into Weaso again who strongarms him into doing a bank heist. This second time has the added twist that Weaso is doing it as a ploy to bring Conker to the Panther King.
-   At the beginning of _Dragon Age: Origins_, Duncan demands you join the Grey Wardens. Of the six potential player characters, only the Human Noble and a Circle Mage who reported Jowan's plan to Irving don't face guaranteed immediate death as a consequence for refusal. The Dalish Elf stands to die of a Darkspawn taint, while the City Elf, Dwarven Noble, Dwarven Commoner, and Circle Mage who didn't report Jowan all face execution for various crimes (or in the Mage's case, Tranquility, which really isn't much better).
-   _Dyztopia: Post-Human RPG_: At the end of Chapter 2, President Zazz states that Zeta won't help rebuild Vulcanite's power grid until Akira is captured, essentially coercing the citizens into turning on Akira whether or not they believe they blew the power plant up.
-   _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_: The plot of the _Dragonborn_ DLC turns out to be Hermaeus Mora orchestrating one for the Skaal; His help is required to stop Miraak (because reaching Miraak requires the full Bend Will Shout, which only Mora knows), so the Skaal can either accede to his demands to give up their secrets in exchange for the Shout, or Miraak will enslave them all, along with quite probably the rest of the world.
-   _Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War_:
    -   Ayra's nephew Shannan is used to coerce her to fight Sigurd's army.
    -   One of the bosses in the battle with Thracia strong-arms General Hannibal into fighting Seliph's army by taking his adoptive son Coirpre/Charlot hostage.
    -   Turns out, Arvis got this too. He's basically coerced to accept Manfroy's help, otherwise his Loptous heritage would be revealed and there's only one fate for those with that bloodline: Getting burnt on a stake publicly.
-   _Galaxy Angel II_: In the second game of the trilogy, Mugen Kairou no Kagi, the reason why Three Marquis of the Arms Alliance start a war against Seldar and the Luxiole was because they were approached by the Will, a race of aliens from a different dimension, with the chance to gain access to their technology if they proved themselves worthy. Genievres' words after his final defeat and before he is annihilated are to urge the Rune Angel Wing and the Luxiole to agree to whatever offer Parfait is about to make them now that they have the Will's attention. It's heavily implied he felt overwhelmed by the Will's power and was trying to keep them safe by way of playing the Will along enough to escape unharmed.
-   The G-Man makes one of these to Gordon Freeman at the end of the original _Half-Life_. Canon establishes that Gordon accepted the offer to work for him - refusing the G-Man results in Freeman being dumped into a horde of hostile alien monsters without a single weapon, which would make the odds of _Half-Life 2_ ever happening pretty much nil.
    -   In Marc Laidlaw's non-canon Episode 3 ideas, the G-Man makes one with Alyx Vance as his new employee while Gordon is allowed to spent his retirement well away from anything else, alone, "in infinite finality". _Half-Life: Alyx_ reused the idea in the form of the G-Man helping Alyx prevent Eli's death in the future and _then_ revealing that she has to replace Gordon as his new employee in exchange, dismissing her objection with a simple _"I'm afraid you misunderstand the situation"_ before detaining her anyway.
    -   It's implied that G-Man makes these deals for his own employers to various characters such as Dr. Wallace Breen and Eli Vance.
-   Most of the plot in the video game _Kane & Lynch_. The main protagonist, Kane, is tracked down by his old mercenary partners and is forced to recover their lost fortune. In order to motivate Kane, the mercenaries take his wife and daughter hostage.
-   _The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel_:
    -   This trope happens to Rean Schwarzer in the second game. Duke Cayenne offers him to join the Noble Alliance so that he could see his sister again. Thankfully, he is talked out of this by nearly everyone else in the ship, mainly because they have an agenda of their own that requires Crow fighting Rean.
    -   Happens again in the third Cold Steel game, or more specifically, the Northern War that happens in the Time Skip between the second and third games, which is referenced in flashbacks. Chancellor Osborne has Aurelia Le Guin and Wallace Bardias, two leaders of the provincial armies, lead the attack on North Ambria, which leads to its annexation into Erebonia. By leading the invasion, the provincial armies were allowed to stay in power. Considering the nobles lost the civil war, it was either this, or the provincial armies would've been dissolved as punishment for supporting the nobles during the war.
-   This is the backstory of _The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess_. The Big Bad's representative invades Hyrule and slaughters anybody who gets in his way en route to Princess Zelda. When he finally reaches her, he gives her an ultimatum she can't possibly fight — surrender the kingdom or watch your people be massacred. She's already seen that her people can't stand up to the power he's brought with him, and drops her rapier in a gesture of submission.
-   In the CDI Zelda games, Ganon says "Join me, Link, and I will make your face the greatest in Koridai! Or else you will die."
-   A surprising number of Renegade dialogue options in _Mass Effect_ consist of variations on the phrase "do \[thing I want\] or I will hurt/kill you".
    -   The ending of _Mass Effect 3_ has the Catalyst make three such offers to Shepard. The choices are wipe out all synthetic life including an entire species that might have become friendly to the player, become the new controlling intelligence that commands the Reapers, or forcibly cyborgify every life in the galaxy. You can refuse, but doing so means that all advanced life in the galaxy gets ground up into mulch.
-   Vladimir Lem from _Max Payne_ makes Max one of these offers. Being a cop, Max isn't really inclined to deal with mob guys to start with, but since Max is on the run from the law for a crime he didn't commit and waging a one-man war on Punchinello's syndicate, Max accepts his offer to go after Boris Dime, a former Vladimir lieutenant who has joined Punchinello, in exchange for enough guns to go after Punchinello.
    -   Technically, Max is under absolutely no obligation to accept Lem's deal: there's no implicit or explicit mention of a penalty for refusing. The reason Max goes along with the deal is three-fold: to get his hands on powerful weaponry, to piss off Punchinello, and to gain a potential ally.
        -   In fact, Vlad says this specifically for fun saying he always wanted to say that line.
    -   Vlad lives up to the trope in _Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne_, using the good will he earned in the first game to advance his plans for a while longer before revealing himself as the true Big Bad.
-   In _Mega Man X4_, Sigma gives one to the Magma Dragoon. To get the chance to fight X or Zero, he had to work for Repliforce and crash the Sky Lagoon. Being obsessed with defeating X and Zero, Dragoon couldn't refuse it.
-   In _Pokémon Red and Blue_ and its remakes, a Rocket grunt threatens you with this when you refuse to join Team Rocket. Considering how easy it is to defeat his team even after being worn down by 5 or 6 previous battles beforehand, the threat is pretty empty.
-   Happens to Leon between the events of _Resident Evil 3: Nemesis_ and _Resident Evil 4_. After escaping Raccoon City with a then 12 year old Sherry Birkin, Leon and Sherry were detained by the U.S. government and Leon was given a choice; become a special agent for the government so his expertise on the zombie outbreak can help the government or let said government perform experiments on Sherry since she has the dormant G-Virus inside her body. Leon reluctantly agreed.
-   This comes up at least twice in _Shin Megami Tensei_:
    -   In _Apocalypse_, Nanashi encounters Dagda in Yomotsu Hirasaka after getting killed by Adramelech. This leaves Nanashi with one of two options: become Dagda's puppet and personal attack dog or accept death and leave Asahi for dead. Nanashi chooses the former.
    -   In _V_, Aogami offers the protagonist his strength after saving him from the demons of Da'at. The protagonist is hesitant, but he accepts. It's more voluntary than most other examples, but the trope is still very much in effect.
-   _Splatterhouse_: As Rick was mortally wounded, he had no real motivation to decline the Terror Mask's request to become its new bearer even if it meant becoming its slave. In the 2010 remake, the Terror Mask outright points out to Rick that "without me... you're fucked."
-   This goes all over the place in _Stellaris_.
    -   At the top of the food chain for most of each game will be the Fallen Empires, ancient civilizations that have been traveling the stars since before yours was in diapers; they are the most powerful factions for the entire game until regular empires (usually yours) eventually overtake them. Most of them request things of the younger empires, or even give them gifts if they like them for one reason or another. When they make demands while they dislike you, however, it's usually because you've done something that they don't like, and they want you to stop. Fail to obey, and there will be suffering.
    -   Next ones down are the Marauder Clans. They usually leave normal empires alone, although they will demand tribute on a regular basis. If a regular empire refuses to pay said tribute, however, they will immediately send a raiding fleet to one of that empire's systems. Their raid fleets tend to be considerably stronger than an empire's earlygame fleets, but usually come out weaker than midgame fleets.
    -   And finally, the regular empires themselves, of which the player is one. Depending on relative power, this can be invoked by most empires on eachother thanks to wargoals, which can force opposing empires to cede to demands if they lose depending on the valid goal (known as a casus belli) selected. There are exceptions, however; certain options aren't available between certain types of empires. For example, there is no way an organic empire of any sort is going to subjugate a Determined Exterminator empire, and the only wars available between any other empire and a Devouring Swarm are ones that entail total destruction of at least one side of the conflict; even if the side opposite of the Devouring Swarm is yet another Devouring Swarm.
-   Mr. Wong from John Woo's _Stranglehold_ makes Tequila one of these offers as well. This time, the offer is to rescue his daughter Billie and her daughter Teko from the Golden Kane and the Zakarovs. Given Tequila's relationship with Billie and the fact that Teko is his daughter as well, this is an offer Tequila can't afford to pass up. Unfortunately, Wong proves to be a ruthless son of a bitch and has Billie murdered the minute the Zakarovs are history, both to prevent her from testifying against him and out of pure spite against Tequila, who he absolutely despises, setting off Tequila's Roaring Rampage of Revenge.
-   In _Strike Commander_, you go from initially picking your contracts as you see fit to accepting them because there's no other choice. Whether because they're going broke, or because some powerful organization is extorting them (especially the Internal Revenue Service), the Wildcats increasingly become pawns forced to go against everything they believe in. Breaking the cycle and teaching these organizations that you're not to be trifled with is a key element in the plot.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Rose Guns Days_ taking place in a mafia-heavy setting, this is bound to happen. However, those who accept Caleb's "help" aren't much better off than those who refuse in the end.
-   _Ace Attorney_:
    -   In _Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Trials and Tribulations_, Loan Shark Furio Tigre finds himself in a situation like this when he gets in a traffic accident with a young woman named Viola Cadaverini, who happens to be a Mafia Princess. Her grandfather being The Don and a Papa Wolf, Tigre is forced to pay for her medical bills and then some by the end of the year, or else...
    -   In _Justice for All_, assassin Shelly de Killer does this to Phoenix himself: either get Matt Engarde acquitted of murder, or Phoenix's assistant and best friend Maya Fey dies. This seems like an easy choice considering that Phoenix has spent the entirety of two games helping his clients be acquitted, but it takes a nasty turn once it becomes obvious that Engarde is guilty as sin.

-   _RWBY_:
    -   Cinder amasses all of her followers this way, starting with threatening to call the cops on a young thief and ending with threatening to wipe out a terrorist group if they don't agree to be her muscle while always pointing out the benefits of working with her. Roman Torchwick implies this is the case for him as well, though his recruitment in the Whole Episode Flashback is limited only to an audio of him meeting Cinder.
    -   Volume 5 shows that this is a terrible way of building loyalty, and only works if the subject is truly intimidated. When Cinder cajoles Raven's Bandit Tribe for help with the theft of the Haven Relic, Raven only agrees after showing how unimpressed she is by Cinder's threats. She later confides with her subordinate that they are going to double-cross Cinder the first chance they get.
-   _DarkMatter2525_: "Would You Vote For God?" uses the analogy of a human dictator offering his people a "choice" between choosing him or torture as the analogy to how fundamentalist Christians argue God acts, i.e. with the "option" to worship him vs. going to Hell. He notes that very few people would consider that a "free choice" if a person did it, but rather the worst form of oppressive coercion.

-   In _Teen Titans (2003)_, Slade once threatened to kill Starfire, Cyborg, Beast Boy and Raven if Robin didn't become his apprentice. Robin managed to turn it around on him by injecting himself with the same nanites that were in the other Titans, and made an offer of his own: Either Slade didn't kill any of them, or he killed all of them, thus losing his apprentice.
-   In _The Legend of Korra_, Kuvira beats a group of bandits and binds them to the railroad tracks. She tells them that they could join her or hope that someone finds them in the middle of nowhere and rescues them before another train comes. They join her.
-   _Batman: The Animated Series_:
    -   Two-Face's whole origin started with something like this, and it was a case where the offer is not only refused, but the man making the offer would _greatly_ regret it. Mobster Rupert Thorne got ahold of Harvey Dent's records, which detail his anger management issues which at times made him seem like a different person. (Often called "Big Bad Harv" by doctors.) Thorne threatens to expose them to the public unless he gets a few "favors" from the DA's office. Dent's response however isn't what he expected:
    -   After that, a violent fight broke out, and despite Batman's attempts to stop it, Dent is caught in an explosion that mars half of his face, causing his Split Personality to be given life as Two-Face, and his Start of Darkness completes. His first criminal acts as the villain are, naturally, aimed at Thorne.

-   _A Thousand and One... Americas_: Near the end of the twelfth episode, when the priest of Tiahanaco learns that Chris knows the secret behind the making of bronze, he tells him that he'll have to spend the rest of his life in the city to prevent the secret from becoming widespread (this is because the making of bronze was a secret during the era of the pre-Columbian civilizations in Real Life), but he'll be treated like a prince and become a priest once he grows up. Chris appreciates the offer, but refuses and tries to escape alongside his pet dog Lon. He wakes up afterwards.
-   _Yankee Doodle Cricket_: This 70s Chuck Jones cartoon has Chester the cricket and his friends teach the song "Yankee Doodle" to the local wildlife. One animal happens to be a frog, uninterested in Chester playing the song and eating him. A nearby bald eagle sees this, grabs the frog, and threatens it into letting the cricket go.
    
    **Eagle**: Now then, friend frog, that is an American citizen you are holding in your mouth-bone. The way I see it, you have a choice in the matter. You can either restore this cricket's civil liberties, or you can be opened up without anesthesia.
    

    Real Life 

-   Pablo Escobar's infamous offer: _"plata o plomo"_, "silver or lead".
-   Duress is a legal defense for most crimes in many jurisdictions (usually with the exception of murder), which usually means threats of violence toward oneself or another (e.g. being forced to rob a bank by people holding your loved ones hostage).
-   In 1945, the Rockefeller Foundation were deeply afraid that the discovery of nuclear power would threaten the lucrative oil business that had built the family fortune. To head off this threat, they approached geneticist Hermann Muller to scaremonger about radiation for them: he was in no position to refuse as he was 56 years old, had no pension or savings (due to frequent job-changes often forced on him as a result of his socialist beliefs), and had a young wife and a 2-year-old daughter with health problems who would likely require expensive treatments.
