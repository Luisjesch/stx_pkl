_"I love every living creature."_

Some people hate animals (to the point some may go out of their way to harm them). Some people are apathetic about them. Some only like a particular group of animals, usually the cute ones. Others like _all_ animals, or maybe all of them with a few exceptions, and this is the page for these characters.

Sometimes, the Animal Lover is an expert on animals and the go-to person for when someone has a problem or a question regarding their pet or has to deal with a wild animal that's dangerous/a nuisance. They could also have a job focusing on animals, such as a zookeeper, vet, or animal shelter worker.

Other times, despite _liking_ animals, the character doesn't really _know_ an awful lot about them, which could backfire on them (especially if they try to keep a wild one) or annoy the animals, sometimes even killing or hurting them. If the ignorant animal lover is a child, especially a girl, they might be seen putting their pet in clothes. Such characters are quite often children, while the more knowledgeable animal lovers are often teens or adults, though occasionally they might be a very intelligent/knowledgeable child.

A lot of fictional animal lovers are reserved and described as "liking animals more than people", but there are plenty of sociable animal lovers in fiction too. Liking animals is also a common way of establishing a character as a Nice Guy or girl, letting the audience know they're a good guy, demonstrate a morally-ambiguous character turning fully good, or revealing that a seemingly mean character isn't so bad. However, not all Animal Lovers are pure and an Animal Wrongs Group is what happens when a whole group of them are nice to animals, but go overboard and end up being mean to humans in the process.

An Animal Lover may also be used to deliver An Aesop about environmentalism or animal cruelty. If a character seems to attract animals, can tame dangerous animals, or can talk to animals, it's a good bet they're also an Animal Lover.

Animal Lovers are commonly depicted as owning many pets of different species, but some may only have one or a few pets and others may really _want_ one or more pets but don't have them due to being too busy, too poor, or their landlord/parents/etc said no.

Expect the Animal Lover to be seen saving animals (see Cat Up a Tree and Free the Frogs), looking after their pets, crying over movies/news/etc where an animal dies or is hurt, making Baby Talk to an animal due to Cuteness Proximity (even if they're normally stoic), Training the Pet, and looking at animal memes on the Internet. They may also be a vegetarian and/or a Nature Lover in general.

Compare (and can overlap with) All Girls Like Ponies, Heroes Love Dogs, Homeless Pigeon Person, Kindhearted Cat Lover, Crazy Cat Lady, The Beastmaster, Nature Hero, Friend to Bugs or Caring Gardener. Contrast Bad People Abuse Animals and Cruella to Animals. Naïve Animal Lover is a subtrope. Do _not_ under any circumstances confuse this with Bestiality Is Depraved. Compare _and_ contrast Men Like Dogs, Women Like Cats.

He is in general an animal lover, but this went further in Grant Morrison's run, in which he witnesses various cases of animal abuse which make him sick to the point of becoming a vegetarian and adopting various animals in his house, a love for the animals inherited by his children.
-   The Golden Age _Aquaman_ was intensely protective of marine life and would grow furious if it was endangered wantonly.

-   _Batman_:
    -   Batman looks after the bats in the Batcave and lets them whirl around him (or hangs upside down with them). It's not just his themed animal that Batman bonds with, either — he likes dogs (especially Ace the Bat-Hound), horses (which he uses in _Batman: The Dark Knight Returns_) and even cows, as he and Robin saved one (Bat-Cow) from the slaughterhouse. Batman likes cats, too, mainly thanks to Catwoman.
    -   Of Batman's many Robins, none love animals more than his biological son Damian. Despite initially being introduced as an Anti-Hero who struggles to avoid maiming and killing his foes, Damian has been shown to have an incredible soft spot for animals of all shapes and sizes, becoming a vegetarian and adopting a cat, dog, cow, dragon-bat, and a full-size Japanese dragon over time. He also goes on tirades against people who kill animals for profit and once beat up a king and his entire guard for trying to kidnap his dragon-bat, Goliath.
    -   Harley Quinn has gone so far as to volunteer at pet shelters during the Christmas issue of her own comic (while getting the police to help her — whether they like it or not).

She also adores her pet Hyenas and is horrified when she has to kill them when they go rabid in Death of the Family.
-   _Superman_:
    -   Naturally, since he was raised on a farm, Clark loves a lot of animals: dogs like Hank (the Kents' dog) and Krypto the Superdog, and he even keeps alien creatures in containers inside the Fortress of Solitude since his no-killing code usually keeps from harming anything, even if they invade Earth.
    -   Supergirl loves animals, especially cats, adopting one tabby cat and naming him Streaky in "Supergirls Super Pet", and being known to frolick with lions. She also semi-adopts a horse in "The Super-Steed of Steel". And in Action Comics #259: "The Cave-Girl of Steel"), Kara travels to the prehistoric age specifically to see dinosaurs.

-   In _X-Men: The Early Years_, Cyclops is definitely an animal lover. He buys a goat because he'll not put up with her owner abusing her, refuses to blast a tiger, and is the only one to get along with his ride. The only animals he can't stand are Beast's unholy lab pets.

Many of her viewpoint books have conflict involving animals, and she's usually the one most cut up about having to hurt them (she once killed a termite queen to break free of their Hive Mind and was the only one to angst about it).

Cassie is disagreeably surprised to find out her friends think she would actually put an animal's life over theirs.

After he heard Christopher accidentally suffocated Adrianna's dog, he was outright furious, saying to Christopher, "I oughta suffocate you, you little prick!"
-   _Star Trek: Enterprise_:
    -   Phlox has many animals he keeps around, and while a few of them are because he needs their hair/drool/etc for his medicines, he's shown to care about them deeply as pets, too.

    Tabletop Games

    -   In the first game, which is called _Cute Knight_: All to do with Prince Kirelan. The former Royal Nursemaid says this about Prince Kirelan, which is heard after doing a good job reading to kids at the library a certain amount of times:
        -   After three times talking to the nursemaid:

        -   After four times talking to the nursemaid and choosing to hear about Kirelan:

        -   If the protagonist meets Prince Kirelan at the stables about 3 times, he says this about her, if she chooses to be Just Friends when the choice for a Relationship Upgrade of being "more than friends" is available:
            
            **Kirelan:** It's always nice to meet a fellow animal lover.
            
-   _Darkstalkers_:
    -   B.B. Hood is a funny case—plants sprout around her, and butterflies and moles like her far more than is normal, but she does _not_ get along with wolves. (It should be noted that she has a lot of "cute" traits and a less-than-cute personality.)
    -   Played even more bizarrely with Huitzil/Phobos, the local killer robot who shows to be quite fond of birds, squirrels and kids.

-   _Disgaea 3_ has Animal King Goro, one of the feared Diez Gentlemen. While he loves the monster-type units, they don't return the sentiments, and in one skit they try to eat him alive!
    -   On another axis there is the Beast Tamer line of generic units, whose love and dedication to raising the best monster-types has earned them the admiration and cooperation from those aforementioned monster-class units.
-   _Fire Emblem_:
    -   In _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_, Marianne gets along much better with animals than with people, to the point where hardly anyone in her class knows what she sounds like but she talks to birds and squirrels regularly. She has proficiency in riding and flying, and her personal skill "Animal Lover" heals her for a portion of her HP when she's adjacent to a cavalry, pegasus knight or wyvern-riding ally.
    -   _Fire Emblem Engage_ introduces Merrin, who has this as her defining character trait.

-   _Max: An Autistic Journey_: All but outright stated with Max. His best (imaginary) friend is a dinosaur toy (although he has plenty other dino toys he plays with as well), he spouts animal facts every so often, he's very excited to do his report on emperor penguins, and he is reluctant to help Jimmy kill a spider in his room. It's implied that, due to being autistic, Max connects more with animals than he does with people he doesn't know.
-   _Moshi Monsters_:
    -   Poppet loves "Moshlings" (what monsters keep as pets) and even has a whole song called "I Heart Moshlings".

-   Nakoruru from _Samurai Shodown_ series is a Nature Heroine who loves all animals and in general the nature, being their defender. Also, she has two mascots who were her Animal Companions, the hawk Mamahaha and the wolf Shikuru (mostly seen with her Superpowered Alter Ego Rera).
-   In _The Sims_, Sims can be given a personality trait known as "Animal lover" in version three and "Animal affection" in version four. It causes the Sim to build relationships with animals faster than other Sims.
-   In _Sticky Business_, Bernd S. likes animal stickers and orders them from you to help him cope with his burnout from work. He then quits his job to work at the animal shelter at Patrick K.'s suggestion, and Bernd feels happier about himself.
-   Morgan LeFlay in _Tales of Monkey Island_. Not only does she like monkeys, but she also loves cute parrots, especially one that is made of pyrite, which she says she'll keep as a souvenir once she's done with Guybrush.

    Webcomics 

-   _Archipelago_ has two of these, Simon and Kor:
    
    -   Simon's constantly accompanied by his dog, June, and later manages to turn shadomandyrs into dog-like critters by the sheer strenght of his personality. He's also unable to leave an injured animal without help which is how he got into the whole shadomandyr situation in the first place.
    -   Kor is the caretaker and amateur veterinarian for a large flock of birds and a _jabberwock_ (sort of a bear, except with six paws and owl face, and normally really dangerous) named Charlie, that steals trinkets. He's reluctant to leave for a world-saving quest until a trusted friend offers to take care of his pets.
    
    **Kor**: Bad Charlie! That necklace doesn't belong to you! And besides, it'll give you a tummy-ache!
    
    -   Come sequel we learn Vamuro is also one of these, fussing over kirin, feeding magical dogs gefiti and bringing in strays. Even he draws a line at adopting an Eldritch Abomination, though.
-   In _Champions of Far'aus_, Catharine is quite knowledgable about “monsters”, but gets really excited over the animalistic ones. The Galemore Sky Force setting up a Wyvern petting zoo is the main reason she went to Dorawn for the N.E.U.U festival, she’s more than happy to tell Daryl all about the differences between dragons and wyverns, and is over the moon with joy when Daryl tells her about the ice dragon hatchling they have back at the Hyperia pantheon house. The only time she (reluctantly) fights a dragon is because it was terrorizing a town, and didn’t want it to kill people.

-   When Nikki in _Pixie Trix Comix_ moves into an apartment with two other characters, she shows up with a whole string of pets (two rats, a rabbit, a fish, a bird...); challenged about this (frankly rather presumptuous) behavior, she says that “Animals... are my life”.

-   In _Yokoka's Quest_, Azha is shown to have the "Animal Lover" ability on his bio page. Misha is his cat familiar, and Chirpy is her pet bird - aside from those he hasn't had an opportunity to show a particular interest in other animals yet.

-   _DSBT InsaniT_: Autumn is nice to everyone, from kids to animals to creatures.
-   _Echo Rose_ is an empath, meaning that she cares a lot about the people around her, but also adores animals of all kinds. She owns a cat, felt physically sick when exposed to an animal skull, and generally cares about nature to the point of it being a defining character trait.
-   _Impractical Magic_: Yam is an animal lover obsessed with getting many many familiars. He loves all animals. Particularly monsters. Particularly dangerous monsters. Particularly horrifying, disgusting, dangerous monsters that he doesn't actually know how to make friends with. Those he wants to steal and raise as his own by default.
-   _Less is Morgue_ has Evelyn, who adores animals, though particularly dogs - even going on a huge monologue about it in Episode Two.
    
    **Evelyn:** Did you know there are whole twitter accounts that just have pictures of dogs? I hadn't seen a dog in sixteen years, then boom, dogs everywhere! Dogs driving cars - can you believe that? Can you believe that there's a dog out there that can drive? I mean, how did the dogs learn how to drive? Is there a doggy driving school? I bet every dog that goes to driving school just aces it, because dogs are good at everything. I used to have a dog - she was a rescue and her name was Peppermint. She was a Pomeranian-Cross-Alaskan-Malamute, and—

    Western Animation 

-   _Anytime Tales_: Jessie from "I Want a Cat" wants a cat and later a dog, and she's jealous of her friends who all have pets.
-   _Archer_: One of Sterling Archer's many eccentricities is that he _really_ loves animals (except alligators, which he's scared of). Any animal in his presence gets his _immediate_, undivided attention, and he admits at one point that he'd probably have become a veterinarian if he had done better in school.
-   _Arthur_:
    -   D.W. likes animals (with the exceptions of octopi and mice, both of which she's scared of) and she even cries upon seeing a dead fish in "D.W.'s Deer Friend". She also mourns her parakeet Spanky when he died.
    -   Sue Ellen became a vegetarian because she befriended some animals on a farm.
    -   Kate can speak to animals and she seems to like most animals (even the fleas who sometimes bite Pal). While Nemo the cat sometimes antagonises her, she likes him better than Pal does.
-   Lydia in the _Beetlejuice_ cartoon is shown to be this; a number of episodes show her being exceptionally kind to animals, including insects and other "icky" creatures. Of course, she's also a friend to a great many _non_\-living things.
-   _Bob's Burgers_ normally Enfant Terrible Louise Belcher adores animals, and more easily shows kindness to them than to other people. A surefire way to distract her is to show her a puppy or other animal.

    -   Gaia, being the anthropomorphic personification of Earth, naturally loves its creatures, even ones that aren't especially appealing.

    -   Kwame hates seeing animals harmed, though he has a special soft spot for elephants, given an incident in his pre-recruitment days in which a herd led him to an increasingly-scarce stash of wood.
    -   Ma-Ti, and not necessarily an extension of his Heart Power; in his introduction sequence he calmly faces a jaguar about to eat his future pet monkey Suchi and manages to save the latter without throwing an attack against the former. When he sees the oil spill that Greedly caused in his first appearance, his first reaction is to exclaim that they have to help "the poor animals."
    -   The girls of the Five-Man Band are a bit like this as well. In her first appearance the Tsundere Linka is seen playing music for a bunch of birdies, who then bring her the Wind Ring; during hers, Team Mom Gi is wind-surfing and playing with a dolphin as she gets the Water Ring. They also work hard to help other types of animals.
-   Cole from _Central Park_ **really** loves animals. Bitsy's dog Champagne is a prime example.
-   _The Cramp Twins_: Lucien Cramp is a vegetarian eco-nerd who loves all kinds of animals (except moths, because they eat clothes). He's firmly against all kinds of maltratation against them, from minor things like dog biscuits (as he thinks the artificial ingredients are bad for them) to major ones like experimenting cleaning products on them.
-   The titular Dan of _Dan Vs._ has time and time again proven to be _much_ nicer to animals than other people, as he freed the animals from the animal shelter before blowing it (and the employee inside) up and is so repulsed by the idea of a restaurant boiling lobsters alive that he jeopardizes his revenge plan to free them. He's even disgusted by the idea of killing a _werewolf_ and balks at Chris for suggesting they should kill it because it's evil, as his intended revenge for it clawing his car was to find the werewolf's car and key it.
-   _Dora the Explorer_:
    -   Most of Dora's friends are talking animals, and she's pretty good with non-talking ones too.
    -   Diego, Dora's cousin, and his friend Alicia, devote their lives to helping (sometimes rescuing, sometimes more along the lines of assisting) animals.

-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_: Fluttershy loves animals and one of her, well, _pet_ peeves is someone being mean to animals. It helps that she can speak to them as her special talent. Notably, she is shown to be entirely indiscriminate in her love of animals — while by default she's seen with a straightforward assortment of Woodland Creatures, she's also often shown interacting with fantasy monsters such as manticores and with traditionally "gross" or "creepy" animals such as spiders, snakes, bats and the like, which she treats with the exact same unconditional gushing and affection that she has for squirrels, birds and bunnies.
-   _Phineas and Ferb_: Both the titular characters have a way with animals, particularly their pet platypus Perry. In one episode, "Interview With a Platypus", they make an animal-translator device so they can understand what Perry's chatter means, only to use it to help other animals instead. This extends to their friends as well. The only reason Buford became the neighborhood bully is because he was saving his goldfish Biff from the previous one.

    -   Kimi Finster likes animals, and one time she threw away some plastic animals to play with her dog Fifi, saying that she likes "real aminals better than pretend ones".

-   In _Sofia the First_, the titular character, Sofia, have the power of talk with animals thanks to her magical amulet, and it helps her in her adventures since she befriends animals very easy, between them her entourage of animal friends,Clover the bunny, her mounts Minimus and Skye, the squirrel Wattnaught and the birds Mia and Robin, and ocasionally crackle the Dragon.
-   _Skull Island (2023)_: Cap is amazed and fascinated by Kaiju, but beyond that, in Episode 4, he feels compassion for a dying Venus Fly Trap Creature (one that got mortally wounded because it was trying to eat one of his comrades, no less), and he tries to comfort it as it passes
-   In _Spongebob Squarepants_, the titular character seems very fond of most of the little sea critters, even the more aggressive ones such as Larry the snail.
-   _Stanley_: The main character, Stanley himself plays this trope STRAIGHT. Really straight that in one episode, "Save the Bluebird!", revolves around Stanley trying to save every animal from being endangered, especially bluebirds.
-   _Total Drama_:
    -   Bridgette is a vegetarian who firmly believes animals are friends and not food, and is shown to be quite good with them (like tending to an injured bear in _World Tour_). She also vehemently opposes hunting; in the episode "Paintball Deer Hunter", she has to be convinced by Harold that pretend hunting using paintballs on other contestants dressed as deer is perfectly fine.
    -   DJ too. He is shown to be very gentle with animals (such as rabbits), and will sometimes keep any he finds as pets. _World Tour_ proved to be a nightmare for him when he believed he had been cursed by an Egyptian mummy to accidentally harm any creature that got too close to him.

-   _Winx Club_:
    -   Roxy, the fairy of animals, loves all sorts of creatures. She's always empathized more deeply with animals because she can understand them and, if she does the right spell, even give them the ability to talk back. Things like poaching or animal abuse enrage her. Once, she found a white tiger and decided to adopt it. It's very well-behaved.
    -   Flora, who shows a lot of care and concern for various plants and animals. Her Establishing Character Moment has her display a vast collection of plants (some sentient). She knows how to care for every last one of them and asks the other girls to make accommodations for them. Flora is always deeply saddened whenever an ecological catastrophe occurs.

-   Queen Elizabeth II was known to have a soft spot for a lot of animals, especially horses, dogs, and even cows. Heck, all her estates have land dedicated to them (even if it's just a large garden in the middle of busy London)!
-   Another good example from Animal Planet's heyday is Jeff Corwin, who gushed and raved about every animal he came across on his show. Well, except for monkeys, but Jeff still liked them and just preferred to keep his distance so they wouldn't maul him. Due to him being a herpetologist, Jeff was especially fond of snakes and lizards, and always tried to give them a kind word and better reputation whenever he could.
-   Jainist monks in India don't wear clothes (so they can't crush insects in them), sweep the ground they're walking on (so they can't tread on bugs), and sometimes even wear a cloth before the mouth, so they can't suck in flies.
-   While less extremely ascetic, some Buddhist monks are also very careful to avoid harming even the smallest creature, carrying bells to warn insects and the like of their approach.
