_"The spirit was willing but the testicles were weak."_

When a character about to have sex cannot get it up. The cause is often a sexual version of Performance Anxiety, but may also sometimes be related to Unresolved Sexual Tension — for someone other than the person they're with at the moment. The "guy can't get hard for girl(s)" variation is the most common — the phrase, "It's okay, this sort of thing happens to lots of guys," is closely associated with this trope.

Usually a comedy trope, since the situation is usually temporary, and playing it for drama lasts longer. Double points if something like, "I'm sorry, I swear this has never happened to me before…" or the above-mentioned, "It's okay…" phrase shows up in the dialog.

Can be Truth in Television (and there are usually other ways to get the job done). One of the leading causes is the classic panic attack, which causes an adrenaline rush and in turn diverts blood flow away from the genitals — quite a lot of blood heads downward to facilitate sexual activity, yet much more blood is diverted back upwards when adrenaline is involved, mostly so that your essential organs can function at their best. Other common causes of erectile dysfunction include age (it's four times more common among men in their 60s than those in their 40s), poor cardiovascular health, stress, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption ("whiskey dick").

The Distaff Counterpart to this trope (in which a female character is incapable of getting properly lubricated and/or sufficiently "relaxed") is not unheard of but, as the above description suggests, the male version is infinitely more common in fiction. There's an additional Double Standard in that male examples are almost invariably played for comedy with the man being the butt of the joke: female examples either tend to attribute the character's lack of lubrication to her partner's sexual inadequacy or unattractiveness, or to deep-seated psychological issues or traumatic sexual experiences.

Named as a pun for a song <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  that has _absolutely nothing_ to do with impotence, but the Double Entendre is too good to pass up.

Contrast Anorgasmia, Raging Stiffie, Speed Sex (for when the guy goes off too quickly rather than not at all), Something Else Also Rises. Parodies of the latter are occasionally used as a visual gag — e.g. a skyscraper collapsing. Think Unsexy Thoughts is an inversion of this.

May be a result of a Paralyzing Fear of Sexuality, Incompatible Orientation, Sex Is Evil, and I Am Horny, or Big Prick, Big Problems.

    Advertising 

-   The Truth Initiative's "Twinkle Twinkle Little Dick" ad that suggests that cigarette smoking causes impotence, and possibly makes men go out with other men.

    Anime & Manga 

-   The hermaphrodite protagonist of _Boku no Futatsu no Tsubasa_ once tries to have sex with a boy she likes. He can't get it up. She then does it with the local Casanova, who is apparently indifferent to her... peculiarities, but in the end, decides that she likes girls better, anyway.
-   In the yaoi manga _Brother_, Asuka has been completely unable to get it up by masturbating ever since his stepbrother Yui caught him in the act and expressed his contemptuous disapproval. He's been trying to fix it ever since, but it isn't until Yui confesses to him that _he_ hasn't been able to get it up either after Asuka unknowingly made him jizz in his pants and then initiates sex with him (mainly because he believes they're going to die soon) that Asuka's impotence is cured.
-   In _Cells at Work! CODE BLACK_, the first host suffers from erectile dysfunction, having to take Sildenafil/Viagra to achieve an erection and ejaculate. Since this manga shows it from the perspective of the host's cells, it's a straight-up Existential Horror, as it means the host can't fulfill the ultimate goal of any life form — that is, reproduce.
-   Happened three times in _City Hunter_. The first time Ryo had been stung by a killer bee, and the initial antidote to the poison had this side effect (other versions of the antidote had rather interesting side effects). The second time a Phantom Thief hypnotizes Ryo into impotence to neutralize his "Mokkori Power" (aka his will to fight and win), giving Ryo a really hard time until he got horny enough to break out of the block. The third time it happened to the Phantom Thief: he had tried to hypnotize Ryo into eternal impotence, but Ryo was carrying a mirror, and the idiot hypnotized himself.
-   _Girl Friends (2006)_: Akko's night with some random drunk guy after a party, where they didn't go all the way because he couldn't get an erection. She omits this detail when she tells the story because he begged her to keep it a secret, which results in everyone including Mari not realizing that Akko is actually still a virgin.
-   Tomoe from _Kamisama Kiss_ heads to the Red Light District after Nanami heads to a summit. However, it is implied that he does this because he is lonely while she is gone. So he merely gets drunk and falls asleep without having sex with any of the girls.
-   _Maison Ikkoku_: Godai and Kyoko's encounter in a Love Hotel, after Kyoko says she's thinking of Soichiro (meaning the dog, but Godai interprets it as her late husband).
-   In _So, I Can't Play H!_, Lisara has to periodically drain Ryousuke's energy to stay in the human world. He learns that every time this happens, he has to wait a while before he can get it up. This is what upsets him the most, not the pain or potentially dying.

    Art 

-   One interpretation of the Viscount's broken sword in _Marriage A-la-Mode_ is as a symbol of sexual impotence; while the lace nightcap being sniffed by one of the family dogs indicates that he has just returned from a brothel, it appears he was unable to perform, probably as a result of his case of syphilis. (The damp patch on the front of his wife's skirt and her contented expression suggest that her own extramarital tryst had a more satisfactory ending.)

    Comic Books 

-   At the end of their mini-series in _Convergence_, Stephanie Brown and seeming perma-virgin Tim Drake very nearly consummate their relationship with some Glad-to-Be-Alive Sex... only to find both are too tired and sore from their earlier battle with Gorilla Grodd to go through with it. They settle for just falling asleep cuddling instead.
-   Marvyn from _Donjon_ angrily lists all the reasons he doesn't want the power of Immortality. One of them is that he "didn't have an erection since the planet stopped spinning."
-   One two-parter in _Justice Society of America Classified_ opens with Rex Tyler, the Golden-Age Hourman, experiencing some trouble _keeping up_ with his wife. She suggests that maybe instead of Miraclo, he should try some "little blue pills".

-   Happens in _The Rise of Arsenal #3_ when Roy Harper, who's strung out on drugs and grieving for his daughter, can't get it up to have hate sex with Cheshire. He then goes out to beat up some druggies with a dead cat. At least one fan has since gone on to coin the nickname _The Inability To Rise Of Arsenal_ for the series in the wake of this incident.
-   Roark Junior, the truly vile title character of the _Sin City_ story "That Yellow Bastard", loves to hear his young victims scream. It's the only way he can get aroused, and the only way he can even get it up.
-   The _Spider-Man_ villain Overdrive becomes impotent for a while after using his powers. On the flip side, if he has sex, he has to wait a while before he can use his powers.
-   In _Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do_, one of the things that drives Francis Klum into villainy is the fact that the sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of his older brother has left him with persistent impotence.
-   Dan Dreiberg aka Nite Owl of _Watchmen_ suffers from this as he's trying to romance Laurie/Silk Spectre. He overcomes this after some back-into-superhero-costume experience.
-   In a What If? dual-issue where Spider-Man marries Black Cat instead of Mary Jane Watson, _Felicia_ suffers from this on their wedding night, the implication being that she doesn't find Peter sexually attractive at all. It isn't until they return to New York City and start fighting crime again that her libido returns, leaving Peter torn about his decision to wed her in the first place. She finally accepts Peter for who he is _while dying_, having murdered Vulture for him in misguided revenge (Toomes had discovered Spider-Man's secret identity and immediately launched an attack on Aunt May's house).

    Fan Works 

-   _The Bolt Chronicles_: Bolt is unable to perform sexually in “The Wind” after eating uncooked bread dough, which releases copious amounts of alcohol into his stomach.

-   In "Confessions of the Master" by amalcolm1, Watson's war wound starts to act up more as he gets into his twilight years, and he finds that staying in the same position for any amount of time tends to cause pain.

While shagging it up with an enemy spy named Ivana Humpalot, Austin's mojo (literally his libido/sex drive) is drained out of his body back in 1969, causing him to immediately go limp in 1999. In order to save himself from perpetual erectile dysfunction, he, therefore, has to boogie on back to the Swingin' Sixties. While there, he gains a new encouragement to retrieve his mojo when he meets sexy CIA agent Felicity Shagwell. The groovy hippie chick's desire to compete in the bedroom Olympics with the International Man of Mystery only increases his desire to cure his impotence and retrieve his precious mojo from Dr. Evil so he can finally take Felicity to bed.
-   In the film adaptation of Stephen King's _Autopsy Room Four_, a man finds himself on an autopsy table after being paralysed by a snake bite and presumed dead but is saved from being cut open when the doctors notice he has a Raging Stiffie. A flashback shows the protagonist feeling down because he can't perform his wife due to a war injury. When they embrace at the end of the movie, she's quite impressed with his 'response'.
-   _The Avengers (2012)_: When Loki tries to mind control Tony Stark with his staff, it fails because of the metal generator in his chest. Tony puts on a look of mock-sympathy and starts talking about "performance issues" in a way clearly meant to refer to erectile dysfunction.

Mike also shows reluctance towards Sam's attraction to him at first and states this as the reason.
-   Clyde in _Bonnie and Clyde_, which might be Truth in Television.
-   _Boy Eats Girl_: Justified. Nathan's gradual zombification cuts off the flow of blood to his penis, preventing him from having an erection. When Cheryl tries to seduce him, she notices this as she's about to pull down his pants.
    
    **Cheryl:** Show me how much you want me... Don't you like girls?
    
    **Nathan:** What?
    
    **Cheryl**: Well usually guys are standing at attention about now.

-   In the 1982 remake of _Cat People_, Paul picks up a blonde in a cemetery and experiences this problem. He's seen crying that he was always afraid "it" would happen again; she comforts him that she knows how to take care of guys like him. And then "it" turns out to be something that happens when he _does_ get it up (namely, turning into a black leopard and eating the nearest human).
-   A really horrific example happens in _Citizen X_, where the Serial Killer Andrei Chikatilo is impotent unless he's inflicting extreme violence on someone. He eventually kills over fifty people.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   In _Death Becomes Her_ Madeline accuses Ernest of this. He doesn't deny it, just tells her to shut up. Since he's a middle-aged alcoholic and she's turned into a shallow hateful woman he no longer loves, this is pretty well justified.
-   Plays as a key point in _The Departed_ as Colin's girlfriend, "Little Miss Freud," gives him the above speech, more or less. That doesn't stop her from getting some much-deserved lovin' and a bun in the oven from Billy.
-   The clear implication of _Dr. Strangelove_ is that General Ripper's descent into madness began when he became impotent, which he blamed on Communists contaminating his precious bodily fluids by putting fluoride in our water.

-   Happens in _Forgetting Sarah Marshall_, although with a justification:
    
    **Peter**: Maybe the problem is that you broke my heart into a million pieces and so my cock doesn't want to be around you anymore! Okay? EVER!
    
-   Dr. Herbert Bock, George C. Scott's character in _The Hospital_, claims he's been "impotent for years," then goes into a rant where he declares, "Impotence is beautiful, baby!" The impotence Bock speaks of, however, goes beyond the physical. He goes on:
    
    "When I say impotent, I don't mean merely limp. Disagreeable as it may be for a woman, a man may lust for other things, something less transient than an erection, some sense of permanent worth. That's what medicine was to me, my reason for being. When I was 34, Miss Drummond, I presented a paper before the annual convention of the Society of Clinical Investigation that pioneered the whole goddamn field of immunology. A breakthrough! I'm in all the textbooks. I happen to be an eminent man, Miss Drummond. You know something else? I don't give a goddamn. When I say impotent I mean I've lost even my desire to work. That's a hell of a lot more primal passion than sex. I've lost my reason for being. My purpose. The only thing I ever truly loved. It is all rubbish, isn't it? Transplants, antibodies, we manufacture genes, we can produce birth ectogenetically, we can practically clone people like carrots, and half the kids in this ghetto haven't even been inoculated for polio! We have established the most enormous medical entity ever conceived and people are sicker than ever! We cure nothing! We heal nothing! The whole goddamn wretched world is strangulating in front of our eyes. That's what I mean when I say impotent."

    **Night Bitch:** _I guess evil dick feels limp._
    
-   This is a major plot point in _Love & Other Drugs_, which is about a Viagra salesman.

-   In the original movie of _M\*A\*S\*H_, camp dentist Painless Pole Waldowski (known to all as the "best-equipped man" in the Army Medical Corps) becomes suicidal after he finds himself unable to rise to the occasion. He comes to Hawkeye asking for some pill that will make it quick and painless (the suicide), but instead is given a weak sleeping pill and provided with a friendly nurse who is shipping home the next day. He's back to himself by morning and the nurse is seen smiling uncontrollably as her chopper departs.

-   Tonny in _Pusher 2_ hires two prostitutes for a celebratory orgy after getting out of prison, but is completely unable to perform. This is just one of an entire film's worth of indignities that he suffers.
-   In _The Real Blonde_, a soap opera star cannot perform after seducing a coveted "real blonde." After she humiliates him, and he gets his revenge, he goes back to a fake blonde.
-   _Red Sparrow_: Invoked. After fighting off a rape attempt, Dominika is told to service her would-be rapist in front of her SVR class, with the Arc Words "find out what he needs and give it to him". She instead strips off in a sexually _dominant_ fashion and acts as if she expects _him_ to service _her_, and as a consequence, he can't get it up. Dominika then tells the class that what he needs is to feel power over her.
-   In _Revenge of the Nerds_, Jerk Jock Stan is shown at least twice having "problems" (even when getting a handjob from his girlfriend Betty); this eventually leads to Betty's Heel–Face Turn when the nerdy Lewis rapes her while disguised as Stan.

    "Goddammit doc, them pills of yours are a total crock! I got back home, showed it to the wife, and nothing! I tried with one hand, then two, my wife used both hands and her mouth, my wife's sister did the same, we tried working it over from both ends with pipe wrenches for half an hour, stuck it in a door, a clamp, and keyhole, whacked it with a cleaver, the neighbor's boy tried pouring battery acid on it, even got the dog to bite down on it so we could try twisting it around, and nothing doing! We tried EVERYTHING, and we STILL!"
    
    (The farmer slams the object of his discontent on the pharmacist's counter.)
    
    "Can't get this damn bottle open!"
    

    Literature 

-   In _Apt Pupil_, where Todd Bowden has a girlfriend, because he wants to look normal. However, by this time, he is a misogynistic, hateful monster, and he's only able to perform when he's thinking of rape and abuse; eventually not even then.
-   Done without a trace of comedy in _Biting the Sun_, to the point of the impotent character committing (temporary) suicide over it.
-   In _Blood Rites_, novice porno actor Bobby reacts badly to Harry's joke about being hired as a stuntman for Arturo's latest skin flick. Jake explains that it's because "stunt man" in the porn industry means an understudy _penis_, used in cases when this trope strikes the intended actor.
-   In _Cetaganda_, Barrayan noble Ivan Vorpatril gets himself into a threesome with two Cetagandan ghem-ladies during a diplomatic mission, and finds out that his host had slipped him an anti-aphrodisiac in his drink earlier, resulting in great personal embarrassment until he finds a way around his little problem, involving the aforementioned "other ways to get the job done" and some bluffing about Barrayan sexual mores worthy of his craftier cousin Miles. His performance is so impressive that he ends up becoming a Sex God among the ghem-ladies in spite of his drug-induced setback.
-   _The Frog King_: Harry Driscoll occasionally has performance anxiety when he's cheating on his girlfriend with his mistress.
-   In one of Isaac Asimov's _George and Azazel_ stories, "Galatea", Azazel brought a statue of a man to life, but apparently, George didn't explain the concept of erection to him.
-   _The Girl With The Louding Voice_: Absolutely _not_ Played for Laughs. Adunni's new husband Morofu can only perform in bed when he drinks something called "Fire Cracker". Adunni has no idea what "sleeping manhood" even means...because she's _fourteen._
-   This turns out to be a plot point in _Harrys Game_ by Gerald Seymour. The protagonist realises an IRA suspect was involved in the assassination he's investigating because Harry hears he couldn't 'perform' with his girlfriend the night before, implying he was nervous about what was going to happen tomorrow.
-   Happens to the protagonist of the Hard boiled Wonderland section of Haruki Murakami's novel _Hardboiled Wonderland And The End Of The World_, when he attempts to have sex with a librarian who lent him some books about unicorns.
-   "Incubust", a Drabble by Terry Pratchett, has this happen to an incubus, apparently because its summoner also has this problem, and cannot summon anything with powers beyond his own.
-   Played for Drama in _Judge Dee_, where one particularly depraved murderer was obsessed by his impotence. He was known to have eight wives, and the judge wishes he could forget what they told him about their lives with him.
-   In _Kanokon_, Kota Oyamada had this problem at one time. His girlfriend(s?) were worked up trying to fix this. Apparently, it was a problem with pent-up youki that didn't come out from... the pipe and was instead released as sort of an aura outside. The ironic part? That aura downright **seduced** every female around him.
-   Not _entirely_ a comedy trope. In the oft-banned novel _Lady Chatterley's Lover_, one of Lady Chatterley's reasons for her affair with the gardener is because her husband is impotent due to an injury from World War I. The marriage is also lacking adequate emotional intimacy, which is at least as important. The book is a cross between straight drama and an erotic romance novel—few laughs to be had at all.
-   In _The Lies of Locke Lamora_, Locke suffers this when his friends tell him You Need to Get Laid and he tries to hire a prostitute because he's still pining over Sabetha to the point that no other woman will do.
-   Taken seriously in _The Merlin Trilogy_, where Uther's self-image and self-confidence are almost fatally undermined by his erectile failure.
-   _Miracle Creek_: While Matt and Janine are trying to conceive, sex becomes such a scheduled, goal-oriented activity that one night Matt finds that he can't get it up anymore.
-   In _Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation_, Rudeus has a more extreme version of this after Eris leaves after sleeping with him. His "illness" not only means he can't perform with two separate women but also that he didn't have an erection at all for three _years_. He only overcomes it thanks to Sylphy, booze, and generous use of an aphrodisiac. This is not played for comedy, as it originates from an emotionally traumatic event and only compounds his feelings of inadequacy.
-   _My Dark Vanessa_: The last time Vanessa and Strane tried to have sex, she was 27. He kept going soft because she was too old for him. Since then, all their interactions have been over the phone.
-   _Naked Came the Stranger_: Ansel Varth is a prolific writer of bizarre pornography, much of it involving bestiality, but he finds that he can't get it up in the presence of an actual woman. Gillian solves the problem by making believe that she's a chimpanzee and he's a camel.
-   In _Last Watch_ from _Night Watch (Series)_, an Uzbek Other named Afandi (who is over 300 years old but a very weak mage) curses Edgar to have this happen to him the next 77 times he lies with a woman. Anton notes that this is a very Eastern thing to do.
-   _One of Us is Lying_: In the sequel, _One of Us is Next_, this is the secret that is revealed about Knox when Maeve ignores her Truth or Dare text, resulting in Knox being humiliated and not speaking to Maeve for a while. When it happened, they simply took it as proof they were Better as Friends. At the end, he and Phoebe kiss, resulting in an embarrassing situation that at least lets him point out that all systems are go this time.
-   The eunuch Bagoas in Mary Renault's _The Persian Boy_ reflects on how his former lover/owner King Darius reacted to this trope as opposed to how his present lover, Alexander the Great, takes occasional impotence. Darius would become upset and send for a sexual expert like Bagoas to 'make things right'. Alexander just takes it as a sign he needs a good night's sleep.
-   Perhaps not coincidentally, King once confessed in a _Playboy_ interview to suffering periodically from this in Real Life.
-   In _Pratt Of The Argus_, the second Henry Pratt novel, the protagonist's date with Anna Matheson ends with her naked in his bed and him afflicted by this trope.

His informal magical advisor Seyonne is privately amused, but can't tell him he's just overexerted himself, so recommends a bogus "purification ritual" that will give him enough time to regain his stamina.
-   _The Reluctant King_: In the second book, Jorian has this inconvenience when he joins the High Priestess he's supposed to have sex with in bed. Fortunately, he recovers later.

    For the first time in their relationship—in _any_ relationship—Chaz had heard that most hollow and dreaded of consolations: "Don't worry, it happens to everybody."... Even digitally remastered, "Bad to the Bone" could not rally Chaz's bone to its usual badness.

-   _All in the Family_: Mike is studying for major college exams and is also having problems getting it up in bed with his wife Gloria. She suspects it's just because he is worrying over whether he will pass his exams but he isn't so sure. Mike's Father-in-law Archie, without telling Mike, goes to a black neighbor, Henry Jefferson, for advice on the problem as he's heard that Black Is Bigger in Bed.

Fortunately for Mike, he does pass his exams, causing his performance in bed to return to normal and proving Gloria right.

-   Bill Henrickson struggles with this throughout _Big Love_, in particular at the beginning of the series, due to both the considerable mental and physical stress that he's constantly under (running two stores and preparing to open a third, running and maintaining three separate households, trying to be a good husband to all three of his wives, financial troubles, etc)
-   From the _Blackadder II_ episode "Chains":
    
    **Prince Ludwig the Indestructible:** Oh, on the contrary. We have met many times, although you knew me by another name. Do you recall a mysterious black marketeer and smuggler called Otto with whom you used to dine and plot and play the biscuit game at the Old Pizzle in Dover?
    
    **Edmund Blackadder:** My God!
    
    **Ludwig:** Yes! _I_ was... the waitress!
    
    **Blackadder:** I don't believe it! _You_? Big Sally?
    
    **Ludwig:** (falsetto) 'Will you have another piece of pie, My Lord?'
    
    **Blackadder:** ...but I went to bed with you, didn't I?
    
    **Ludwig:** For my country, I am willing to make any sacrifice.
    
    **Blackadder:** Yes, but I'm not! I must have been paralytic!
    
    **Ludwig:** Indeed you were, Mr. Floppy...
    
    **Blackadder:** Yes, alright, alright. Now, would you mind—
    
    **Ludwig:** (falsetto) 'Such a disappointment for a girl...'
    
    **Blackadder:** Yes, alright, you've had your little joke.
    
    **Ludwig:** (falsetto) 'It really doesn't matter — we'll try again in a few minutes. Have a look through these naughty parchments.'
    
-   A chronic problem with Charlie "Lucky" Luciano in _Boardwalk Empire_ (probably because of syphilis). He gets better with Gillian, however.
-   Done metaphorically with Spike's inhibitor chip in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_. He tries and fails to bite Willow, and the conversation they have afterward could _word for word_ be about impotence (well, except "bite," obviously). Until she realises "What the hell, I'm talking to a guy who just tried to murder me" and knocks him out. Sure enough, in Season 6 when Spike discovers his inhibitor chip doesn't work on Buffy, his reaction is not to bite Buffy but to spend the entire night having house-crashingly rough sex with her.
-   There was an episode of _Charmed_ where this happens to Piper whenever she wants to have sex with Leo. This happened because she was afraid of the elders watching.

-   Parodied on a _Conan O'Brien_ sketch, when a man is lamenting this. He gets the "it happens to every guy" speech—from the _three_ women he's in bed with, pointing out that it was inevitable after an _entire day_ of lovemaking.
-   _Coupling_: Patrick has this happen to him when Sally decides it's time they became more than friends, leading to much discussion about "the Melty Man," who is actually the Anthropomorphic Personification of this trope. That night the Melty Man visits Patrick, and the following exchange as a Darth Vader parody.
    
    You! You killed my erection!
    
-   Takes a much, much grimmer turn on _Criminal Minds_, where one serial killer was an ex-swinger who'd become impotent due to complications from prostate surgery. Quite a lot of Killers Of The Week are implied to have similar problems.

-   On _Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman_, as Horace and Myra prepare to consummate their marriage, only to be disrupted by the shivaree (an 1870s custom common in the West that consisted of family and friends noisily serenading the newlyweds). The next morning, an irritated Horace snaps at Loren, Jake, and the Reverend, telling them "thanks to you, I lost the mood."

-   _Drop the Dead Donkey_. Elderly hedonist anchorman Henry confesses to Dave (in confidence) that this happened the night before. Naturally this spreads over the office like wildfire, and when his despised co-anchor Sally quips in response to Henry's computer going down "Maybe it's your floppy" Henry bursts out with "YES, ALL RIGHT, I'M IMPOTENT!" right in front of a television crew who've come to do a This-Is-Your-Life style interview with him.
-   Inverted on "The Puppy Episode" of _Ellen_, where after the titular character literally jumps on the guy she's dating in an attempt to seduce him, the scene fades back in to find _her_ apologizing and claiming, "This has never happened to me before". (Her lack of response is because despite genuinely liking him, she's not sexually attracted to him—she's just beginning to realize that she's a lesbian).
-   _ER_: Mark Greene has a bout of this after being beaten up.
-   _The Family (2016)_: Hank is unable to perform when he brings a woman home and she starts to give him fellatio, because of the chemical castration meds he takes.

-   Happens to Chandler in _Friends_ ("In high school, I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me."). When he goes to Joey for advice, Joey confides that it happened to him once. "What did you do?" asks Chandler. "We did it anyway." Chandler is also involved in another conversation about this phenomenon:
    
    **Rachel (to Ross):** It's _not_ that common, it _doesn't_ happen to every guy, and it _is_ a big deal!  
    **Chandler**: **I KNEW IT!**
    
    -   In the first episode Monica's date claims he hasn't been able to "perform sexually" since his ex-wife left him for another man two years ago.

-   _Herman's Head_ used this with Herman somehow hooking up with a supermodel, but couldn't perform because he was intimidated by her status (he gets over it).
-   _House of the Dragon_ has a zigzagging example in Daemon. It's implied he struggles with Anorgasmia (or delayed ejaculation), but in its social framing, it's more this trope than that one. It's not that Daemon can _never_ perform, but that his body is connected to his emotional state, particularly his Inferiority Superiority Complex. Daemon's sexuality is deeply rooted to his emotions, and if he's feeling bad or worrying about something else, he can't do it. He has to feel good about himself before he can perform.
-   Happens to Simon in _The Inbetweeners_ when he attempts to have sex with Tara. However, this was down to taking Jay's rather poor advice of having a "tactical wank" very shortly beforehand.

-   A whole episode of _Mama's Family_ centers around Vint's temporary inability to get it up, which his wife Naomi calls in to talk to Joyce Brothers about when she's featured on a local talk show. Naturally, everyone in town sees it, and hilarity ensues. According to Dorothy Lyman, the episode was supposed to include a scene that didn't make it past the censors, wherein a limp piece of asparagus reminds Naomi of her and Vint's problem, causing her to cry.
-   In the _M\*A\*S\*H_ episode "Some 38th Parallels," Hawkeye experiences "The Big Couldn't" with a nurse:
    
    **Hawkeye:** She looks a little like my mother. Maybe Oedipus wrecked it for me.
    
    **BJ:** Look, it's perfectly understandable. You've been going full tilt since you got here, and your nerves are brittle enough to use for kindling.
    
    **Hawkeye:** Tension.
    
    **BJ:** The war.
    
    **Hawkeye:** Happens to everyone.
    
    **BJ:** Right.
    
    **Hawkeye:** Ever happen to you?
    
    **BJ:** Never.
    
    **Hawkeye:** Fink.
    
    -   A more dramatic example happens in "U.N., the Night and the Music" when Margaret falls for a UN observer from Sweden who was wounded _down there_.
-   A few instances show up on _Masters of Sex_, which is fitting given the subject matter. One instance is Played for Laughs when Austin (who regularly Really Gets Around) can't rise to the occasion during one study.

    -   It gets Played for Drama in season 2 when it happens to Bill.
-   _Night Court_ had The Casanova Dan Fielding dosed with saltpeter right before a "big date," and a discussion about his inability to perform:

    **Dan**: Did it ever happen to you?
    
    **Harry**: **Hell no!**
    
    (Later repeated with Bull, then Mac, instead of Harry.)
    
-   _Ozark_: This happens to Ben with Ruth as a result of his medication.
-   In _Peep Show_, Jeremy has fallen on hard times and has resorted to sperm donation for income. However, he just can't get it up in the cold, clinical public toilets they provide for him, and he is forced to try and get it up over an image of the Queen from a fiver in his wallet.
-   In the nineties Fox sitcom _Roc_ this happens to the title character in one episode. His wife Eleanor tries to comfort him, but her ebonics accent makes it come out wrong.
    
    **Eleanor**: "Now honey, what happened last night is not that impo'tant _(Roc storms out of the room)_ I mean imPORtant! IMPORTANT!"
    
-   A _Saturday Night Live_ skit had a commercial actor being subjected to relentless verbal abuse regarding this while filming an ad for an erectile dysfunction medication. Adding to his humiliation, his girlfriend is brought to the set to complain about it too. The poor guy finally breaks down in tears after the fed-up woman leaves, at which point, it's revealed that the commercial he's filming is for...Tootsie Rolls?
    
    **Announcer**: "When life's screwed up like this, reach for a Tootsie Roll!"
    
-   _Scrubs_ has the episode "My Monster," in which J.D. finds out on a date with The Gift Shop Girl that his "peep was on the fritz." Another episode subverts this trope. It opens with Turk and Carla about to get it on, then the camera moves to the side...then back, to see them both laying in bed looking distraught, and Turk says, "That's never happened to me before." Later, as each is talking about what went wrong to their friends, it's revealed that Turk was fine; it's _Carla_ who couldn't have an orgasm.
-   The _Seinfeld_ episode "The Mango" has mango fruit be the cure for George and Jerry.
-   Used as an ongoing plot point with Charlotte's first husband Trey in _Sex and the City_, one of the few cases where it is an ongoing issue rather than a one-episode gag. Also when Samantha has sex with a party guest when she sees that her boyfriend Richard won't commit to monogamy, he goes soft inside her and while he's blabbering that this has never happened before, this is the first time that she actually doesn't care that it happened.
-   One of Naomi's former partners in _Skins_ had this problem. Seventeen times.
    
    **Naomi:** I was getting tennis elbow!
    
    -   Of course, that may be because Naomi's heart wasn't really in it — she was trying to convince herself that she wasn't in love with Emily...

-   Burt has this long-term at the start of _Soap_ because he feels guilty over murdering his wife's first husband. They eventually see a psychiatrist to help him and he confesses to the murder; the doctor says that, given the circumstances, it was actually self-defensive. This relieves Burt of his guilt and he's cured.
-   In episode 5 of _Spartacus: Blood and Sand_, Lucretia orders Crixus to have sex with her (i.e. raping him), which she has done regularly for years. However, this time he can't get it up. He says it's because he's nervous about his big gladiator match the next day, but the real reason is that he's in love with Naevia, and is therefore having trouble dissociating from his experience with Lucretia. A few minutes later, he has sex with Naevia.
-   In _Spin City_, Mike has a brief "hydraulics problem" after Manhattan Magazine names him "the sexiest man in Manhattan" and the Mayor tells him that "once you're in the public spotlight, you can't get out".
-   _That '70s Show_: In one episode, Kelso, having broken up with Jackie, is trying to get it on with Pam Macy. Unfortunately, in his words, "the buffer wouldn't buff". He tells this to Hyde, Eric, and Fez, but they simply mock him for his impotency. It turns out that he simply is subconsciously still pining for Jackie and can't get turned on by girls who aren't her.
-   _Titans (2018)_. Vigilante couple Hawk and Dove try to have sex after she saves his life, but Hawk can't perform which he puts down to stress (but is likely his many injuries catching up with him). His mood is not improved when Robin (Dove's ex-boyfriend) happens to turn up.
-   _True Blood_: Jason runs into this when he has the chance for a threesome with two beautiful women; the only problem is he's still traumatized from killing someone a few days ago.
-   Gaz has problems for a few episodes in _Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps_.

    **Gaz:** That's it, rub it in!

Hilarity Ensues with a dream sequence where he's being grilled by the Director (played by G.W. Bailey of _Police Academy_ fame) on his poor "performance".
-   _Veronica Mars_ did this with Mac and Beaver. At the time, it was a Woobie moment for Beaver, since the scene strongly suggested that Beaver was subconsciously cockblocked by his brother, Dick (who lived up to the pun). Let's just say when we find out the real reason, it's significantly less Woobie-ish.
-   In _Wings_, Brian starts dating one of his old teachers. Yet she was a grade school teacher (or junior high), so Brian had trouble seeing her as more than a crush, and when they were about to have sex, he had what he called, "an incomplete." In another episode, Joe and Helen go on their first date in years, but between Brian's putting a subliminal "stuttering" suggestion in Joe's head and Helen's inability to see Joe as anything other than a childhood pal, the loins sleep.

-   On _The Young and the Restless_, when Olivia's husband Nathan couldn't perform (which needless to say, put a crimp into their plans to have another baby), he blamed it on stress from work, and then eventually, cruelly blamed it on her nagging and pressuring him. It turned out he was cheating on her and therefore too exhausted from having serviced his mistress all afternoon to come home and make love to his wife.

    Music 

-   Mindless Self Indulgence (who'da thunk it?) have a song about this, named appropriately "Get It Up." In the middle is a short section of dialogue:
    
    "Uh, Jesus... eh, I-I never had this problem before, it's just a... hold on a second, give it a minute, alright, just give it a minute. Uh... do something sexy! I don't care, do something sexy, just... whatever you do _don't talk about your fucking boyfriend while we're having sex, how 'bout that?_"

    And I fumble with your buttons

    A man has censored, was in a bad mood  
    Didn't sleep well because he didn't get up
    
-   _Put Down That Stubbie_ by Austen Tayshus is a parody of Australian band Midnight Oil's hit _Put Down That Weapon_, with the singer warning that Aussies will go extinct if they keep boozing, thanks to the amber fluid's notorious effect on the sex drive.
