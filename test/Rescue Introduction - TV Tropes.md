_"Hooray! Thank you for rescuing me. My name is Yoshi. On my way to rescue my friends, Bowser trapped me in that egg."_

A new character is met when the protagonists rescue them from a tricky situation, or when they rescue the protagonists. Often creates a strong emotional bond with a new character, as said rescue adds instant dramatic tension to any first impression. Depending on attitude and reaction of the character, it can act as an Establishing Character Moment.

Will sometimes result in a Rescue Romance or Recruitment by Rescue. Compare to Come with Me If You Want to Live, which has a similar introduction dynamic. The rescuer can act as The Cavalry, or Big Damn Heroes depending on the situation.

While this meeting may often overlap with introducing the character to the audience as well, it does not necessarily have to — this is an in-universe trope about how the protagonist(s) meet the character.

-   Richard is rescued by Seigi when he is introduced in _The Case Files of Jeweler Richard_.
-   _Cesare - Il Creatore che ha distrutto_ — in an inversion, the titular Cesare Borgia first appears when he saves The Watson Angelo from a runaway horse. The musical plays it straight, with Cesare singing his "I Want" Song before, and the rescue as Angelo's first appearance.
