_"Every last one of them... They have the gall to take pity on me... and they don't even know... how much they're hurtin' me by doin' it."_

An injured or suffering character is approached by another, eager to help, but the injured party is offended. This reaction of humiliation and resentment may be spoken, acted upon, or merely felt, but it is some variation on "I don't want your pity," or "Don't you dare pity me". This may be used as actual Stock Phrases, but the reaction does not have to be verbalized.

The more serious the problem, the more likely this is to cause conflict. Temporary situations can invoke it for a time, as when Manly Tears or worse Sand In My Eyes causes another to try to comfort the weeping character.

This is most likely to come from a character who does not deal well with sympathy, even in the best of times. The Broken Bird, Troubled, but Cute, The Tsundere, the Jerk with a Heart of Gold, and the Ice Queen are particularly likely to react this way. Indeed, it may develop that their touchy character stems from this and can be resolved if it is. Someone wearing a Tough Leader Façade doubly so, since anything for which they can be pitied is a weakness and danger. The Stoic Woobie is often this trope embodied. Getting them to fess up about it, much less confront it, can be a difficult prospect.

There is a range of possible interactions:  
At one extreme, an injured character tries to avoid insensitive or demonstrative "sympathy" that rubs salt in the wound. They might accuse others of having Come to Gawk. They might fear that any response to their problem will break them down when they cannot afford to break down. The pity may be effusive for a trivial problem, or something that the character does not consider as such. In other examples, the character cannot tell their remorse is sincere; the Handicapped Badass is managing just fine, thank you.

At the other extreme, the sufferer rejects sorely needed and selflessly offered help and suffers all the more for it. They might inflict suffering on others in the process.

Genuine pity is often portrayed as an affront to the dignity of the pitied, as the pity-er is at least implicitly signaling their advantage over and superiority to the pitied, though there is also the popular Aesop that too much Pride is foolish and shallow. The injured character may hide from others to preempt pity. For any such character, mentioning his problem may hit a Berserk Button. The character can wallow in self-pity, but that is different.

The effect is more dramatic if the characters knew each other before the injury or if the problem is invisible. The pitying character may change after The Reveal. If the other person is in any way responsible for the injury, things can get very ugly indeed.

A hero sympathising with a villain's backstory may also incite this response, but be careful, this trope can be done badly. A character frequently angrily rejecting any form of comfort may come across as an Ungrateful Bastard or Unintentionally Unsympathetic when that may not even be the case. Alternatively, this can be presented as a genuine character flaw.

Compare Think Nothing of It, for when a character wants to avoid praise for admirable behavior, Leave Me Alone!, a common phrase also said by characters of this type, and Past Experience Nightmare, where the character tries to hide his pain but it still comes out in his unguarded moments. Also compare Declaration of Personal Independence.

    I am an evil man
    
-   City and Colour's "The Grand Optimist" exhibits a mild form of this:

    For God's sake go away!"_
    

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Ric Flair went into WWE's _Wrestlemania XXIV_ about 10 years past his prime, rapidly decaying in the ring and laboring under a decree from Vince McMahon that meant that the next match he lost would be his last. Knowing this, he challenged "Mr. _Wrestlemania_" Shawn Michaels to a match at the show. And when Michaels showed pity for his opponent in a promo a couple of weeks before the show and hinted that he might not bring his A-game, Flair called him out on it, demanding that Shawn give him everything he has, because, win or lose, he wanted to come out of the show with his honor and integrity intact.
    -   This carried over into the match; Flair was obviously unable to put up an actual fight, but he refused to simply lay down and be beaten. Shawn felt he didn't want to retire Flair (apparently legitimate) as Flair stood there, wobbling, fists barely up and yelling at him to "pull the trigger". Shawn's response? "I'm sorry. I love you." Superkick.
    -   The whole situation was then given an Ironic Echo treatment two years later, when Shawn was trying to end The Undertaker's undefeated-at-Wrestlemania streak because, as he said, "If I can't do this, I don't _have_ a career anymore." At one point, Shawn was pulling himself up to his knees, using Taker as the ladder, and you could hear him yell "Stay! Down!" Shawn played this trope to the hilt by mocking Taker with his own signature throat-slit taunt and then slapping him in the face. The match ended very quickly after that.
-   Triple H seemed to have this attitude a few times after crushing defeats.
    -   When Brock Lesnar almost re-breaks his arm at Summerslam, the refs & EMTs come to help him get up, but he shoves them away & leaves the arena on his own.
    -   After a brutal beatdown by Umaga, he has to be helped from the ring but shoves everyone away after getting his feet to the grown. Unlike Summerslam, he's legitimately injured and has no choice but to accept the help when he collapses after a few steps.
    -   His beatdown from Kevin Nash yields the same response. Hunter is being helped to the back but rasps for them to get off & pushes everyone away. The EMT\] & doctor tell Hunter to let them help, but he insists he's okay. Like in the previous example, he collapses after a few steps & is told again to let them help him.

    Radio 

-   In one episode of _Just a Minute_, the panelists started challenging new player Linda Smith and, when asked what the challenge was, saying "I just think she should get another bonus point" (which you get if you're incorrectly challenged).

    Tabletop Games 

-   Winged elves in _Dungeons & Dragons_ are a rarely-seen subrace of elves with large, beautiful eagle's wings. They take great pride in their wings, and a winged elf who loses his or her wings in a battle or accident is pitied by the other members of the community. However, elves do not accept pity from _anyone_, so such an elf usually leaves his community and becomes a loner.

    I bang my own drum  
    Some think it's noise. I think it's pretty.
    
-   Aldonza's "I Am" Song in _Man of La Mancha_
    
    Don't you see what your gentle insanities do to me?

    Tenderness I can not bear.

-   In _Wicked_, Nessarose asks Boq if he took her to the dance only because he feels sorry for her: "It's because I'm in this chair, and you felt sorry for me...." It's not the actual reason — Glinda asked him to do this, and she specifically cited the chair as the reason she'd find it attractive, so, close enough.

However, after being blackmailed by Cardin after he overheard everything, he finally grows a bit of a backbone, swallows his pride, and asks Pyrrha for help.
    -   In Volume 6, Blake promises to protect Yang from Adam. Yang is offended; she doesn't explicitly say why, but since she's a badass Action Girl with abandonment issues, it seems like she doesn't like the implication that Blake is just there out of guilt.

-   A _Cracked_ article called 5 Insane Things I Learned as a Foreign Aid Worker mentions that the citizens of the developing world dislike being pitted and will react negatively towards dramatics (such as crying when you just met). It later goes on to justify this reaction to pity by talking about the whole "heroic savior" mentality actually causes even more problems.
-   The Nostalgia Chick has a big breakdown in Spooning With Spoony after being raped by the titular character. The next episode later, she's dragging Nella everywhere to dance and shooting laser beams at her with delight.

-   _Sherwood Forest_: Will tries to comfort Shaima when they first meet, and she tells him "I don't want your pity."

-   Richard Turner, regarded as being one of the greatest card mechanics ever to have lived, refuses to let other people pity him or go easy on him due to his blindness. When his karate instructor offered to award him an honorary black belt, he refused and insisted he be tested just like any student, resulting in his going ten rounds of full-force brawling with a fresh opponent each round (and getting his arm broken in the process).
-   In 1968, Swedish soprano Birgit Nilsson underwent an operation (officially for "gallstones"), and four months later, she was back on stage, singing Brunnhilde at the Vienna State Opera. Only many years later, in 1995, did she reveal the real reason for her operation: she had been stricken with cancer. She had never talked about it before because she, in her own words, "couldn't bear being pitied."
-   The disputed tale of Alexander the Great and Diogenes the Cynic has elements of this. In the story, Alexander approached Diogenes with his entourage and offered to grant him any wish he desired because he respected him as a philosopher. Despite standing in front of a man who had conquered 6 countries and was halfway through his conquest of Persia, Diogenes simply and rudely asked Alexander to step aside because he was standing in front of the sun. While Alexander's entourage found the interaction hilarious, Alexander stated “If I were not Alexander, I would want to be Diogenes.” causing Diogenes to allegedly reply "If I were not Diogenes, I too would wish to be Diogenes." The tale of Diogenes and Alexander is commonly perceived as a lesson on who is happier; the man who has everything but has so many social conventions to abide by and so many expectations to live up to, or the man who has nothing but is free from societal expectations and conventions. While enlightening, the more likely explanation is that Diogenes was fully aware that Alexander the Great was just using him as a charity case and chose to mock him instead of feeding his ego. Alexander the Great was an egotistical man who named 70 cities after himself and wanted to use Diogenes to further show off his wealth and power.
