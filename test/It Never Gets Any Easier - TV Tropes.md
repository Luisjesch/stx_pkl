_"Every time I operate I always question myself. Have I made a mistake? Can I pull this off? Will there be any unforeseen complications? I'm always nervous. The patient's life is in my hands...In my hands. How the hell do you expect me to stay calm?!"_

Medical professionals and others who work with human life and death day in and day out always seem notably emotional, sometimes to the point of breakdown.

Often, in reality, although people might have some problems the first few times, they quickly grow used to what is, after all, part of their profession. For any given person or family, the sudden death of a loved one can be a traumatic and tragic event, but for the people who see it on a regular basis, it doesn't have the same impact. Get a bunch of paramedics, firefighters or other first responders together in a room relaxing and inevitably you'll eventually get morbid jokes, pitch-black humor, and stories of "good runs" where "good" would be defined by the average civilian as "scene from a horror movie".

Even if the characters are normally professional (such as in police procedurals, where someone dies horribly in every episode), you can expect to see tears and barely controlled rage if children are involved. (Though, even for the real ones, there's that occasional deader that really rips them up, and this is often a child. Especially if the real worker has children of their own.)

Typically, only The Coroner is allowed to face such things like gruesome death dispassionately as a professional who has seen the most hideous things done to a human body before and is long past being bothered by it.

The trope is named for the phrase that will be uttered to the Naïve Newcomer who is experiencing this kind of sorrow for the first time. It can be Truth in Television, as even the most jaded of these people probably have a story of a time when they'd been at the job for a while and something about a scene they were called to hit them incredibly hard. Nine times out of ten, it involves children or infants.

It's also worth pointing out that Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder exists in every job where workers are asked to internalize what are, after all, natural emotions; if the viewer became as inured to violence and death as real workers become on repeat viewing, they would lose emotional connection, decide it wasn't exciting enough and stop watching. Which, of course, never happens.

Contrast with the more cynical It Gets Easier and Gaining the Will to Kill.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Mobile Suit Gundam SEED_:
    -   Subverted when Andrew Waltfeld admits that he was sick after the first time he killed in battle, but that eventually he got used to it. Granted, although Waltfeld is by this point a protagonist, the series does not present it as a positive thing.
    -   Also subverted by Mu La Flaga, who displays a thick-skinned attitude towards combat. At one point, after a town is razed for supporting La Résistance, he tells its newly-homeless citizens (correctly, but without sensitivity) that the enemy commander (Waltfeld) was very kind to give them the chance to evacuate first and that they are being let off lightly.
    -   On the other end of the scale, Kira Yamato spends a good portion of the first series in various stages of Heroic BSoD trying to _avoid_ this trope, because he knows he's the Only One who can protect the Archangel.
-   Dr. Tenma from _Monster_ appears to be physically incapable of letting anyone die on his watch. Even when the patient in question has handcuffed him and is currently _threatening to shoot him_ if he so much as takes another step closer.
-   _Black Jack_ does not handle the death of his patients well. And by "not well", we mean that someone might get sucker-punched.
-   In _StrikerS Sound Stage X_, this was a discussion that Subaru had with her Special Rescue Team Commander after she had watched a person she was trying to save commit suicide (or more specifically, was mind-controlled to suicide) right in front of her. They talk about how hard it is to see someone die and how they could still see the people they failed to save in their dreams. Then Subaru's superior breaks the tension by saying how idiots such as them shouldn't be having introspective conversations like these and the two share a slight chuckle. It Gets Easier and It Never Gets Any Easier are both present in The 'Verse: everybody normally uses magical guns set to non-lethal - even if the blast had to go through half a warship to hit its target, it will still be a Non-Lethal K.O., thus ensuring that fighting someone _is_ psychologically easy right from the start, but reaction to seeing anyone actually die for any reason is no different from non-combatants' reaction.
-   In _Day Break Illusion_ this is said word for word, regarding the fact that the heroes have to kill the victims of possession.

    Comic Books 

-   In Chapter 1 of All Fall Down, at a hospital for superheroes, Dr. Young finds himself overwhelmed by the sheer number of injured coming in at once.

    Fan Works 

-   _Infinity Train: Seeker of Crocus_: Paul London — who is depicted in his _Lucha Underground_ gimmick — has been on the Infinity Train for 3 years at most, running away after realizing he has just murdered people for nothing (his fellow Rabbit Tribe members offered up to a god and he bludgeoned the messenger that took him to see the White Rabbit), and that's not _counting_ his Mercy Kill of Specter's denizen partner, which left the two of them broken wrecks. By the time he's confronting Grace and Simon who are the opposite of this trope, he's admitted that it never gets better to constantly murder others for no good reason.
-   "The Only Way to Go": While attending Sobaru Lanstar's funeral, Kanril Eleya remarks that after the number of funerals she's been to "you'd think I'd know what to say by now."
-   In the _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_ story "To Everything There Is A Season", which is an adaptation of the cartoon show episode "Squeaky", when Smurfette has a peaceful talk with Tapper after the death of her pet mouse, Smurfette asks Tapper if it gets easier to deal with losing even her best friends to death, and Tapper responds with this, although as a Christian he does tell her that there's a better world waiting for them where there is no more death.
-   _The Parliament of Heroes_: Slade forced his daughter to kill from an early age, intent on making her grow to enjoy it like him. Instead, it only left her traumatized and disgusted with herself to the point where, by the time she arrives in Gravity Falls, she's trying her best to adhere to a Thou Shalt Not Kill policy.
-   _Team 8_: Naruto asks Jiraiya if losing people close to you eventually becomes easier.
    
    **Jiraiya**: Not even a little. And if it ever does, then I don’t want to know you.
    
-   This fan comic for Fate/Grand Order has the MC asks The Old Man of the Mountain after destroying another Lostbelt, effectively Genocide of an entire world to save human history, if it ever gets any easier. His reponse?
    
    _Pray it never does_
    

    Films — Animated 

-   Parodied in _South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut_, when the doctor (voiced by George Clooney) fails to resuscitate Kenny<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and cries, verbatim, "It never! Gets! Any! Easier!" He immediately begins whistling and walks away.
-   _The Brave Little Toaster_: In "Worthless", the hearse going to meet its death in the crusher sings:
    
    _I took a man to a graveyard_  
    _I beg your pardon, it's quite hard enough_  
    _Just living with the stuff I have learned._
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Krzysztof Kieślowski's _A Short Film About Killing_ from his _Dekalog_, or series on the Ten Commandments. A young advocate in Poland is representing a murderer, whom the audience has seen an on-camera murder a taxi driver. The lawyer sees his client hang (the death penalty remained in force in Poland until the end of the communist era), with the last shot showing his anguished face and his senior partner remarking that "today, you have become a man".
-   _X-Men_ has a rare physical version:
    
    **Rogue**: When they \[the claws\] come out... does it hurt?  
    **Wolverine**: Every time.
    
-   _The Professional_ features a Little Miss Badass who trains to become a killer to avenge her family.
    
    **Mathilda:** Is life always this hard, or is it just when you're a kid?  
    **Leon:** Always like this.
    
-   In _Peppermint_, when investigating the murder of the protagonist's family it's mentioned that Detective Carmichael finds it difficult to do his job when the victim is a child.
-   In the James Bond film _Spectre_ , MI6 Director Malory becomes the _first_ hero in the film series to openly address the moral-responsibility associated with taking a human life. When a young agent casually quips how The Status of Double-O is awarded to those who are willing to pull the trigger, Malory chastises him with weary sadness that The License to Kill is a _responsibility_ and **burden,** not awarded to cold blooded killers, but only those who know when _not_ to pull the trigger.

    Literature 

-   When an officer dies under Wedge's command in the _Star Wars_ Expanded Universe novel _Wraith Squadron_, he finds it hard to write the letter informing next of kin. (That the next of kin is in this case his supreme commander probably makes it a bit more difficult.) However, while it takes him all night to word it properly, and he doesn't have much time for sleep, he's _able_ to sleep for the hour or so, and is faintly proud that it _isn't_ any easier than it was the first time he had to do it. It's also come up that since he half expects new pilots to die soon, he doesn't let himself get to know most of them, even keeping to a Last-Name Basis.
    
    -   The trope is discussed in the first Stackpole novel, at a funeral for a pilot killed in her sleep by Imperial commandoes:
    
    "It never gets any easier, does it?"  
    "No, and it never should. Because if it ever does, we've become the enemy."
    
-   In _The Saga of Darren Shan_ the fact that it _does_ get easier is included as a plot point. The first time Darren kills a vampaneze in combat, he is horrified to see him slowly die in front of him and cries over his body. After several years of bloody war against the vampaneze, he finds that he barely feels anything when he needs to fight and kill. Evanna later cites this as a reason Darren will eventually become "The Lord of the Shadows" and destroy the world.
-   Steven Brust and Emma Bull's _Freedom & Necessity_: James Cobham's letter of 27 October, and then Susan Voight's journal entries of 30 November and 1 December. (It would take far too long to explain the combination of "you get used to it", "you never get used to it", and "I am used to it but _you_ are not allowed to get used to it".)
-   Happens in _Squire_ by Tamora Pierce, after Kel is Squicked out by the executions she had to witness. Probably a way of further establishing the main characters as heroic, because Pierce has a tendency of giving her villains a complete and utter disregard for human life.
-   Mary Russell and Holmes discuss this after the end of her first case in _The Beekeeper's Apprentice_. Holmes admits that this is the source of his addiction to cocaine.
-   Although James Bond in the movies follows the It Gets Easier path, in Ian Fleming's original novels, there are numerous occasions in which Bond makes it clear that killing people, even in self-defence, never gets easier for him. In the original _Goldfinger_ novel, for one example, he mopes over having to kill a thug. In _The Living Daylights_, he takes a shot of whiskey while acting as a sniper, and when his spotter protests he counters by arguing that said spotter isn't the one who's going to be killing someone before the day is out. And in _Diamonds Are Forever_, Bond momentarily imagines the corpse of a man he just killed confronting Bond with the permanence of his actions.
-   In the _Warcraft Expanded Universe_ novel, _Tides of War_, Jaina tells her apprentice Kinnidy, distraught after seeing war for the first time, that war is always difficult to bear, but after a while, it becomes more familiar and you learn to move on. She's consumed by grief and rage after Theramore's destruction, and loses sight of this for a while, but comes to her senses.
    
    _"It hurts, every time. But the... unfamiliarity of it goes away, and you learn that you can go on. That those you've lost would_ want _you to go on. You'll remember how to laugh and be thankful and enjoy life. But you won't ever forget."_
    
-   _The Way of Kings (2010)_: Kaladin. A combination of this and Samaritan Syndrome nearly drive him over the Despair Event Horizon.
-   This trope is regularly invoked in the pulp novel series _Rogue Angel_. Annja Creed, the Lara Croft-like heroine, regularly kills enemies, sometimes in cold blood, yet the books often include moments where she ruminates about having to kill and she often expresses regret, even with the occasional Big Bad she has had to end.
-   Dr. Bernard Rieux from the Albert Camus novel _The Plague_, though as he's a Stoic Woobie it rarely comes across.
-   In _Arc of a Scythe_, Scythe Faraday continually hopes his job of killing people permanently remains this way for him and tells Citra and Rowan that it should always be a hard choice.
-   _2666_: Most of the police officers have gotten used to see dead women. Juan de Dios Martinez eventually starts showing signs of a mental breakdown.

    Live-Action TV 

-   Seen on _House_.
    -   For instance, very sensitive Doctor Allison Cameron had to tell parents that their baby died. It was the first patient of House's team that died in the series. She literally couldn't do it and broke down.
    -   Dr. Foreman considers quitting his job and eventually does because a patient died because the team misdiagnosed her. House is disappointed but felt he and the team did the right thing. Foreman felt that it was House's methods that killed the patient and eventually quit because he "didn't want to be like House".
    -   The cynical and amoral House repeats over and over that doctors will see a patient die every now and then and they just have to live with it - to the point that he even uses it as a reason to fire Dr. Amber "Cutthroat Bitch" Volakis, because House doesn't see Amber as an individual who could accept losing. He isn't _completely_ immune, too, given his obsession with saving patients ("Control"), getting upset when he seems to be failing ("Autopsy"), brooding years later over hard cases ("All In")... In these instances, it fits his "obsessive-must-be-proven-right" character.
        -   One particular instance is noteworthy. In "Help Me", a patient dies after an amputation. House doesn't take it well. When Foreman tries to make him feel better, saying he did nothing wrong, he says that he knows he did everything right and that it makes him feel even worse.
-   The downright worst perpetrator seems to be _Grey's Anatomy_. In one episode, an experienced doctor ordered one of the newbies to watch a premature baby in an incubator overnight. The exhausted doctor fell asleep, the baby died, and her supervisor explained she knew the baby would die and assigned her to watch it specifically so she could get used to patients dying.
-   _Joe Pickett_: Discussed in the penultimate episode of season 2. The poker chip killer admits to having run home crying after killing Dan Garrett and says that the revulsion actually got worse with each subsequent killing (although she is seen gloating a bit before killing her fifth victim), but insists it was necessary to keep killing due to Garrett and the others' misdeeds.
-   From _Mercy_, a short-lived Medical Drama: It's a nurse's first day on the job, and her first assignment is to unplug a guy on life support. Striking is the cavalierness of which her supervising nurses treat the assignment.
-   _Scrubs_:
    -   Mentioned often as half the stories have An Aesop that sometimes patients just die, and if you go into depression every time, you'll never get anything done.
    -   The only character who actually _acts_ on this Aesop, though, is Dr. Kelso, but that's just because he has to keep himself together in order to effectively run the hospital. However, J.D. has stated that he doesn't _want_ to be one of the doctors that just doesn't care anymore. One of the reasons he respects Dr. Cox so much is because when he loses a patient, it still hits him hard (granted Dr. Cox was responsible for the deaths of three patients all in one day. That kind of thing can take a toll on your psyche.)
    -   Kelso isn't immune either. The purpose of the episode "My Jiggly Ball" seems to have been to deconstruct the 'heartless administrator' stock character by showing that he isn't obsessed with money because he wants to be, he's obsessed because he _has_ to be.
-   Subverted in the first episode of _Cardiac Arrest_ (a series written by an actual ex-doctor) in which a junior doctor, after telling a patient's family that he has passed away, is told by his boss "Soon you'll be worried about how _little_ this affects you".
-   Subverted on _Without a Trace_, a show about an FBI unit looking for missing people; when asked if it gets any easier, Jack Malone answers, "Unfortunately, yes."
-   _Law & Order: Special Victims Unit_ has this trope in an awkward position, as children get horribly abused and, sometimes, killed in every episode. Bouts of angsty rage are quite common, though; Stabler on occasion wonders whether he can keep doing his job. Considering that it's mentioned _in the show_ that the average time in the department for an SVU detective is two years, and the detectives in the show have been on the job for as much as _eight_, it's no surprise that they're breaking down rather spectacularly at times. In fact, the show can be a lesson in why detectives rotate out of that position after two years: if they don't, they start to go native.
    
    -   From "Uncle", Season 8 ep. 4:
    
    **Stabler:** Just so you know, everybody loses it, their first kid case
    
    **Beck:** I'll get used to it
    
    **Stabler:** When that happens, transfer out.
    
-   _Third Watch_:
    -   Once the senior paramedic Doc eventually has a mental breakdown.
    -   Subverted with Carlos. After his first day on the job, Doc assumes he's having trouble dealing with everything they went through and tells him that all the pain and suffering "gets to you". Carlos says that it didn't get to him at all and that he felt no emotional connection to their patients. Carlos is a bit of a Jerkass, but Doc eventually realizes that this makes him an excellent paramedic since he can look at a situation objectively.
-   _NCIS_:
    -   It features Ducky, a gentlemanly coroner who is positively delighted with his trade and Abby, a Perky Goth Lab Rat who isn't squeamish, either. Ducky does play this trope straight with one specific type of victim: colleagues. He invokes this trope to his assistant Mr. Palmer, who's normally as unfazed by the gruesome nature of their work as he is, the first time he has to autopsy an NCIS agent actually Director Shepard and the boy is visibly shaken. Ducky seems to be deliberately trying to avert this trope in himself - he talks to the corpses, making sure to give them their dignity instead of dehumanizing them so that he can examine the absolutely staggering number of corpses the MCU seems to deal with and not suffer a nervous breakdown.
    -   McGee's shocked reaction to a body in a suitcase... Not because it's a dead guy thrown in a dumpster, but because he just bought that exact model of suitcase, and the seam on this one is ripped. After another agent points out what he just said, McGee wonders if maybe he's been doing this job for too long.
    -   Ziva is a walking aversion of the trope. In the season 3 episode "Jeopardy," when a perp drops dead while in her custody, Ziva is unbothered by his death and confident that her actions didn't cause it, and simply wants to know when she can get back to work. Ziva was trained from birth to kill, but not to question. Years later when she kills a serial killer who nearly killed her, she breaks down; she had come literally within a millimeter of death, and started doubting herself for the first time. And then, a year or so after that, she resigns herself to death, only to be rescued by the last person she expected; afterward, she changes loyalties (from an external perspective), and her co-workers comment on how relatively subdued she has become.
-   Parodied on _That Mitchell and Webb Look_, where (in a ridiculously simplified parody of medical programmes) a doctor pulls off a plaster and says 'That Never Gets Any Easier'.
-   Parodied and referenced in the _Monk_ episode "Mr. Monk Stays in Bed" when Randy tells Natalie that one gets used to seeing murder victims while working on the police force, especially if one is his rank (a lieutenant). He then adds that "getting used to it" is the worst part of the job, the part he never gets used to.
-   A variant is used in _M\*A\*S\*H_ when Father Mulcahy insists on going to the front for an errand. When there, the battalion aid station is shelled and Mulcahy asks a soldier how does one get used to it. The soldier wryly responds, "You get used to never getting used to it."
    -   Another version shows up in an episode where a young officer asks Colonel Potter for advice on writing a letter to the family of a soldier killed under his command. Potter notes that he's written too many such letters himself and it never gets any easier.
-   Reversed the first time Sam Beckett killed a man on _Quantum Leap_. The man in question is a former French Resistance fighter who is said to have killed _his own mother_ during the Second World War. After a scuffle, Sam backs away holding a bloodied knife as the man smiles up at him knowingly, whispers 'The next time, it will be easier' and dies.
-   The show bible for _Star Trek: The Original Series_ describes Dr. "Bones" McCoy as this type of character, even though he is fully aware that most of his patients may be inevitably doomed, sooner or later, to the fate of all Red Shirts.
-   Averted in _CSI_ where Grissom always cracks a grim joke at a crime scene. And many viewers think he's cool for it. Very occasionally played straight in his case; as the trope description notes, it's usually something to do with kids...or when it affects his own team.
    
    **Grissom**: There's three things I got a real problem with: Guys that hit their wives, sexual assault on children, and the scum that deal death to kids.
    
-   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_:
    -   In "The Bonding", Picard has to tell a boy that his mother was killed on an away mission, and Wesley asks how one gets used to doing that. Riker replies that you hope you never do.
    -   This exchange occurs in "Code Of Honor", where Dr. Crusher deals with planet stricken by an epidemic:
        
        **Crusher**: Damn. Where are the calluses we doctors are supposed to grow over our feelings?  
        **Picard**: Perhaps the good ones never get them.
        
    -   In "Contagion", having witnessed the _Yamato_ go up in a ball of anti-matter-induced explosion, Wesley confides in Picard that he can't stop thinking about the ship and its people and wonders how he, Riker and Geordi can handle it. Picard tells him that they can't, but they're trained to push forward.
    -   In "Reunion", when Worf and his son Alexander see K'Ehleyr die, Worf performs the Klingon death roar, then says this to Alexander:
        
        **Worf:** You have never seen death? Then look. And always remember.
        
-   An example from the re-imagined _Battlestar Galactica_ series: in episode 2.09 "Final Cut", Dualla is asked whether it ever gets any easier. She replies that, in fact, "It gets harder." "It" in this case being protecting what's left of humanity from genocidal robots.
-   In the _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ episode "Lie to Me," Buffy is forced to stake a former friend who willingly became a vampire because he was dying from brain cancer. The episode ends with this exchange:
    
    **Buffy:** Does it ever get easy?
    
    **Giles:** You mean life?
    
    **Buffy:** Yeah? Does it get easy?
    
    **Giles:** What do you want me to say?
    
    **Giles:** Yes, it's terribly simple. The good guys are always stalwart and true, the bad guys are easily distinguished by their pointy horns or black hats, and we always defeat them and save the day. No one ever dies, and everybody lives happily ever after.
    
    **Buffy:** Liar.
    
-   In _The Closer_, Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson is going to tell a family that their child has died, and requests that Sgt Gabriel deliver the actual news, as part of his training (they are effectively a homicide squad, so he will be doing this a lot). As they pull up to the house, Johnson says to Gabriel, "Prepare to be the central character in the worst day of these people's lives".
-   Not actually said on _Criminal Minds_, but seems to be present to an extent: all the team have had cases that bothered them more than usual, because the cases somehow directly connected to them, involved someone who reminds them of themselves or were just that horrible.
-   Averted in _Homicide: Life on the Street_. The detectives are so used to dead bodies that seeing corpses has practically no effect on them and they're prone to gallows humour. This makes the cases that do stand out all the more powerful such as Adena Watson, or the shopkeeper murdered by Luther Mahoney. The more difficult aspects come from shooting people on the job or working cases where children are the victims.
-   Parodied on _Strangers with Candy_ when Jerri's father dies.
-   _Highlander_ has a variation, with Richie asking Duncan if it ever gets any easier for an immortal, referring to losing a loved one. Duncan replies that it doesn't.
-   In the _Burn Notice_ episode "Dead or Alive", Michael soberly narrates over a scene of Sam telling an old friend's wife that the man is dead:
    
    **Michael**: You can work in the field your entire life, but telling people their loved ones are dead never gets easier. There's no training that makes it better, no technique that makes it smoother. You just get through it, however you can.
    
-   Parodied on _30 Rock_. When Dr. Spaceman says, "This is hard to say," he means, "This is hard to pronounce."
    
    "You have... _\[squints at paper\]_ ...dee-AY-buh-tees?"
    
-   _Doctor Who_: The Doctor never gets over the loss of the people that he's charged himself with protecting. He just buries it in his memories and goes on, presenting a cheerful face to the universe. Sometimes, after a particularly wrenching loss, he withdraws into himself and decides that he will travel alone. This never lasts for long, because _without_ a companion, he becomes truly fearsome.
    -   Several times during Series 9, the Twelfth Doctor addresses "it never gets easier" with regards to losing people, to the point where, in "The Girl Who Died" and the finale, he makes reckless, universe-threatening decisions.
-   Played with in the first episode of _Threshold_. After the group's first battle with an alien, Arthur retreats to a bar where Sean finds him. The academic civilian Arthur asks the seasoned government agent Sean if it gets easier to face those kinds of situations. Sean replies "Unfortunately, it does get easier."
-   Carol says this word-for-word on _ER_ when sealing a rape evidence kit. A fellow nurse responds, "I'd get worried if it _did_"
-   Agent May of _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._ tells this to Skye when the latter is preparing for a mission in which she may have to kill someone:
    
    **May:** For the record, crossing someone off? It never gets easier.
    
-   _Flashpoint_, a series about an elite tactical (i.e. SWAT) police team, has this at the core of its DNA. Although the team often has to kill people to save others, it is never depicted as an "it gets easier" moment (in fact it's usually treated as a failure on the team's part if anyone gets hurt) and one story arc sees the team's veteran sniper Ed Lane experience full-blown PTSD about all the people he's had to shoot.

    Tabletop Games 

-   In _Princess: The Hopeful_, thanks to Sensitivity, it's nearly if not outright impossible for a Princess to shield themselves from suffering they witness.

    Video Games 

-   Flemeth paraphrases the trope in _Dragon Age II_, in regards to Hawke's upcoming trials and tribulations. And she's right.
-   While a variation of this trope may seem to be played straight in the game _Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway_, it can be excused on account That Other Wiki claims the Operation Market Garden that the game takes place in seems to be a rather big failure as there are around 18000 casualties or losses by the Allies' forces that you play versus the 8000 casualties by the Germans. (see the proof here!) Operation Market Garden was, strategically speaking, a colossal failure, committing resources to a risky attack that failed within _days_ and had to be defended for _weeks_, requiring even more resources.
-   Averted in _Metal Gear_ as one of the major themes of the series. As Snake points out killing does get a lot easier the more you do it, but in his opinion that is one of the worst things about his job. It's also the reason he works alone and keeps doing the job he hates, so nobody else has to do it.
-   In _Trauma Center_, the (player) doctor plays this trope dead straight. Despite working under difficult conditions, against pathogens that would make Ebola seem a walk in the park if a single patient dies, it's game over because the doctor resigns.
-   Part of Luke's Character Development in _Tales of the Abyss_ comes from him slowly accepting the realities of- and getting used to- killing people in warfare. Though he's fine with killing monsters, when he first kills a human (accidentally, and in self-defence) he suffers a Heroic BSoD. Both Tear and Jade lecture him on how they don't enjoy killing humans, but as soldiers, they _have_ to kill for a greater cause: in this case, stopping a war that would kill millions. Even so, an extra scene with Jade near the end of the game reveals that Luke still "lay\[s\] awake, shaking" all night whenever he kills bandits or Oracle soldiers. He also deconstructs this as he's _only seven_ and it's very clear there is absolutely **no** getting better for him with that in mind.
-   _Mega Man X_:
    -   Mostly because he is at heart a pacifist. While Zero has learned to deal with death over his career, X always feels grief and doubt about those who die in the Maverick Wars, even his own enemies. It's even be argued that he _deliberately_ does this so he always has sympathy for the enemy because becoming callous is not the way to finding real peace. When he realized it _was_ getting easier during the time period between the _X_ and _Zero_ series after Zero sealed himself away and left him to fight alone, he chose to retire and become the living seal on the Dark Elf to prevent himself from completely slipping off the slope and _maybe_ use it as time to reorient his perspective. Unfortunately, things got much, _much_ worse...
    -   Zero doesn't let it bother him. He's not totally heartless though - he just sees it from a different perspective. When a twin dies along with his Big Bad brother (because they shared a CPU), he told the upset X that he knew the consequences and he should honor his sacrifice instead of bemoaning it. However, when his love interest Iris dies in a cruel and pointless war, he didn't take it well.
-   _MadWorld_. In the ending theme "Soul", the song takes place from Jack's point of view and deals with his conflicted self. The song suggests that he hates killing but he has to keep doing it for a greater cause.
-   In _Virtue's Last Reward_, Sigma states to the player a number of times that walking into a room and finding a dead body never has any less of an impact or ever becomes any easier to cope with, despite how often it happens.
    
    **Sigma:** \[Even after all that's happened, a room full of dead bodies has a significant impact.\]
    
-   In _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_ Hadvar, an Imperial soldier discusses this trope with the player
    
    **Hadvar:** (Paraphrased) Do... Do you ever feel for the people you kill?  
    **Dovahkiin:** Only a monster kills without feeling  
    **Hadvar:** I guess so. Some of the men say it gets easier, I'm not sure if that's good or bad.
    
-   _Fire Emblem_ has this happen a lot:
    
    -   In a DLC conversation in _Fire Emblem: Awakening_, Owain tells Inigo that it was a huge struggle for him to start killing humans instead of Risen.
    -   Sophie in _Fire Emblem Fates_ has a line after defeating an enemy that says she never managed to get used to killing.
    
    **Sophie:** When does it get easy?
    
    -   In _Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia_, this is Old Soldier Mycen's reaction should a playable character be killed in battle.
    
    **Mycen:** Neither age nor experience dulls the pain of loss.
    
    -   In _Fire Emblem: Three Houses_, Linhardt has one of the most horrified reactions to his first kill. Throughout Part 1 and even into Part 2, he continues to express reluctance to fight and gets ill at the sight of blood.
-   In _BioShock Infinite_, Booker and Elizabeth have a conversation about this once the latter kills Daisy Fitzroy to protect an innocent child, saying that the initial shock of the terrible violence _is_ something that gets easier, the lingering feelings of guilt and trauma will never go away. He had previously tried to brush off her shock over his apparent callousness toward killing people, so this scene serves to show how the two are becoming Fire-Forged Friends.
-   A German sniper in the _Sniper Elite 4_ DLC _Deathstorm_ notes this in his log, mentioning how he still gets physically sick after 34 confirmed kills.
-   In _Spider-Man: Miles Morales_'s ending, after a series of events that sees Miles accidentally causing a bridge to be destroyed and the Tinkerer sacrificing her life to get Miles to safety after he saves Harlem from Roxxon Plaza's deadly reactor, Miles asks Peter if it ever gets any easier. Peter confides in him that it does, but every life he saves helps ease that pain.

    Webcomics 

-   _Misfile_ contains a slightly less serious example of a subversion. Rarely dealing with life and death, _Misfile_ instead deals with the nigh-constant identity crisis of a boy turned into a girl. Ash initially spent each morning hoping that it was All Just a Dream, but has gradually moved to dealing with the realities of his situation. He's no longer shocked to wake up with boobs. What currently tops his list of worries, though, is that she may be getting too used to being a girl to ever really go back to being a guy.

    Western Animation 

-   Parodied on _The Simpsons_ when Granpa Abe Simpson tells a Bowdlerised war story.
    
    _"They say the more teddy bears you tickle, the easier it gets. Well, sir, it doesn't."_
    

    Real Life 

-   US police departments encourage this way of thinking. Lethal force is always the absolute last resort and after having to use it most officers are taken off active duty for a period of time and receive counselling.
-   If you've gone through multiple losses of close family members and friends, you realize that it can appear to get easier to deal with losing yet another close family member/friend, but it doesn't get any easier coping with the loss, particularly if it pertains to a parent, child, spouse, or sibling. You'll be able to manage living a normal life again after the original grieving process is over, but you'll never really be able to "get over it".
-   Outside of PR events, animals used in testing or observed in the field are _never_ referred to with names... because then It's Personal if they die. Contrary to what PETA tells people, it still feels terrible anyway.
