_"Eat. You'll feel better."_

A difficult problem has been set before a character. Some of their attempts to solve the problem proved ineffective. How do they find the solution to this problem then? By eating, of course. Whether they are eating something they think would help them fix the problem or eating the problem itself, eating is the solution they come to.

A Big Eater might come to this conclusion right away, but there are plenty of other people who also resort to this tactic. In any case, their solution to a problem is either to eat it, or fill up their belly to provide a solution.

See also Eating the Enemy, Cast from Calories, Eat the Evidence, Just Eat Gilligan. May also involve Power-Up Food. Compare Heartbreak and Ice Cream and Post-Stress Overeating, where eating is a response to emotional distress.

Reasoning that her mutation includes saliva glands that produce a toxin which her studies have shown will be lethal to Angels, she promptly eats Adam. Deconstructed in that a) this is stated to be a move born of desperation and she thinks it's crazy even as she does it, and b) she deeply regrets it afterwards due to suffering terrible gaseous indigestion. She spends the next day visibly queasy and belching constantly, to the point she has to make up a story about getting a minor case of food poisoning from a greasy spoon diner, and even several days later is _still_ suffering the occasional stomachache, to her own incredulity. It also comes back to bite her as it turns out that enough of Adam remains in her system afterwards that the other Angels start trying to track her down instead.
