Little old ladies love cats. Cats like climbing trees. Cats don't really like climbing down from those trees. Now that's some serious emergency situation.

This trope is often used to give an opportunity for an Anti-Hero to Pet the Dog, especially if the character is a Kindhearted Cat Lover, but it can also be a sign of Chronic Hero Syndrome.

Other times it is used to illustrate that the story takes place in such a peaceful lovely town where this kind of thing is the biggest emergency anyone can think of. In this latter case usually firemen come to help the old lady.

Common variation of this trope is that the cat really dislikes whoever's coming to rescue it and goes all Tasmanian Devil on the rescuer in a whirl of claws and enraged meow-shrieking.

This is Truth in Television, if not as common as media would have you think. While cats are typically ground-dwellers, they have some rather impressive arboreal tendencies, and will regularly climb up tall objects to get a better vantage point — indoors or outdoors — and trees are no exception to the things they'll climb. The main issue cats face getting down from trees are that they can't climb down headfirst (in contrast to other arboreal creatures like squirrels or monkeys), and the stress from having to climb down without being able to see where they're going (i.e. _tail_first) tends to scare them into staying put.

By the way, if your cat does go up a tree (or on a roof), call a tree service or your local animal control department/shelter/what have you. The fire department has better things to do. Like, you know, putting out fires. If you do call these agencies, and the cat is not in any danger or a danger to others, they'll tell you to leave it — it got up there, and it will find its way down when it gets hungry. A very common question asked by responders to these situations is: _"How many times have you seen a cat skeleton in a tree?"_ Of course, if the tree _IS_ on fire, then that's a different story.

-   Invoked in the chapter name of Hinagiku's first appearance in _Hayate the Combat Butler_, though that time she's returning a baby bird to it's nest, she later does rescue cats from trees.

He wants to distract them: His partner Boyle is supposed to tell them that his kid's cat is stuck up in a tree. Boyle has no kids, but _loves_ undercover work with Jake. It's also meant as a quip about their usefulness because the firemen make fun of them and bring up the cops-love-donuts stereotype all the time.
    
    **Jake:** These firemen are not moving. We gotta distract 'em. Tell 'em your little boy's cat got stuck up in a tree.

-   In an episode of _Reno 911!_, the sheriff's department was the subject of a local children's show, Reading Ron. However, all of the footage was vastly inappropriate for kids, so they decided to take one of Wiegel's cats, put it on the roof of someone's house and stage it to look like a rescue. Unfortunately, the cat was difficult to work with and clawed Junior as he tried to "save" it causing him to drop it, and it landed in the AC unit below... it wasn't pretty.
-   An episode of _Rescue 911_ involved a racoon stuck up a tree. The trope with lampshaded with the usual advice being to let the cat come down on its own, as "When was the last time you saw a cat skeleton up a tree?"

    You know,_ The Cosby Show_,_ Ozzie and Harriet_  
    You know, where cops come and got your cat outta the tree  
    All your friends die of old age

    Video Games 

-   _911 Operator_: You can get calls about this "emergency" alongside a few more false positives for each emergency service (i.e. someone suffering from indigestion believing it's something way worse and that they need a medic) to provide contrast with the genuinely serious reports. its sequel, _112 Operator_ adds a level to them.

    Real Life 

-   Rescuing cats from trees (or tops of telephone poles, chimneys, etc) is pretty standard fare on Animal Planet's various animal-rescue reality shows. Acknowledged as a genuine life-and-death emergency rather than a gag, particularly when power lines are in close proximity.
    -   One of these involved the cat being stuck up a extremely tall palm tree and requiring a trained tree surgeon to climb the tree with his equipment and grab the cat.
    -   There was at least one case in Romania when a stray cat somehow got into a distribution transformer — the firemen laughed when called, but the electrical company immediately sent people to release the poor animal, since they knew exactly what damage to expect if the transformer got shorted out.
    -   Kitten must be rescued from the outside ledge of a 12 story building in Singapore.
-   Fire departments have been known to refer to non-emergency calls as C.I.T. (for "Cat In Tree") reports.
-   A reverse case, which doubles as a Moment of Awesome for the cat, can be found here.
-   The Zoo Neuwied once had a _cheetah_ stuck in a tree. For cats they are not terribly good climbers due to having blunt, non-retractable claws like dogs. Rescue involved hay bales as emergency cushion if it fell, a hydraulic platform from tree services, and sedative. The lower branches of all trees in the cheetah enclosure were removed to avoid repeats.
-   Cats aren't the only things that get stuck in trees. Exotic birds (such as parrots), and large lizards (iguanas for example) have actually been stuck in sufficiently tall trees. The rule is the same, though: call your local tree service or animal control to have them come deal with it.
    -   In Florida, where the non-native green iguana is gaining a foothold in the state, it's becoming increasingly common in winter to see them falling out of trees in a stunned state, as the low temperatures force them to go into torpor, then presumably lose their grip.
-   During a particularly bad drought in South Africa, a wildlife filmmaker caught a lioness climbing a tree (highly unusual, as their weight makes climbing difficult for lions) in pursuit of the antelope that a leopard had stashed in it. She succeeded in knocking the carcass to the ground, where the other lions in her pride quickly ate it, but then got stuck herself. Tragically, when she tried to get down from the tree she lost her balance and fell, breaking her back on a limb of the tree and dying as a result. When her body finally fell out of the tree, her pride-mates were so hungry they ate her as well.
-   A koala once snuck into an Australian family's home, climbed their artificial Christmas tree, and got tangled up in the lights. The family called a koala rescue organization to free her.
