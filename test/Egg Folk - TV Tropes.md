This guy looks like he won't crack so easily.

When some animals give birth, they do so in the form of laying eggs. However, these eggs start out essentially lifeless. It takes some time before the living being that is inside will come out of them.

In media though, there are characters that are living eggs with a face and possibly legs. These eggs aren't necessarily likely to hatch into anything else, but most of them are still just as fragile as a regular egg, and they know this for a fact. As such, they often take as many precautions to make sure they don't accidentally shatter.

There may or may not be some crossover with Eggshell Clothing, in which the egg itself isn't alive, but the character "wears" it so they look like a walking egg.

The version with limbs may resemble a Cephalothorax.

Subtrope to Anthropomorphic Food. Not to be confused with the main antagonist of the _Sonic the Hedgehog_ franchise, Dr. Eggman, the walrus, nor closeted Transgender folk.

    Advertising 

-   Gudetama, a Sanrio mascot, is a depressed, slumping egg yolk surrounded by his broken shell, who's been inexplicably successful as a mascot despite (or because of) the Black Comedy surrounding the character.
-   One Kinder Surprise commercial starred a version of Humpty Dumpty with a human-like face and skin, and speaking in some sort of strange gibberish.
    
    Kinder. Yebol shakey. Me unscrubbly. Chocadoobie! Dumbi chocadoobie, bob swobble. Ho ho ho! Toy!
    

    Asian Animation 

-   There's a Taiwanese _Doraemon_ knockoff, titled "IQ Egg" (IQ蛋) where Doraemon was changed from a robot cat to a giant, human-sized sentient egg with pockets for retrieving gadgets. **No, not making this up**. Apparently the magazine's publishers ran into licensing issues for Doraemon, so they created a Captain Ersatz by literally _drawing over_ existing Doraemon artwork.
-   _Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf_:
    -   Jollie and his brother Darton, both introduced in the first season's _Great War in the Bizarre World_ Story Arc, are anthropomorphic eggs with arms and legs.
    -   _Joys of Seasons_ features a race of limbless blue egg aliens that visit Earth several times. Differently-colored versions of these aliens appear earlier in the show, in Season 1.

    Comic Books 

-   Invoked with Condorito's friend "Huevo Duro" (lit. "Hard-boiled Egg"), a guy who has a bald egg-shaped head and white skin and he's one of Condorito's best friends along with Don Chuma, Ungenio y Garganta de Lata.
-   _The Multiversity_: Intellectron, one of the Gentry, is a black, one-eyed egg with bat wings.
-   The Silver Age _Wonder Woman_ villain Egg-Fu is a Red Chinese giant egg with a prehensile moustache. A revamped version of the character named Chang Tzu later appeared in _52_, where he was redesigned to tone down the racist aspects of the character.
-   Edgar "Eggsy" Fullerton Young from _Harley Quinn_ is possibly the post-_Flashpoint_ version of Egg-Fu, although the characters have little in common. Eggsy is a benevolent small-time American Mad Scientist who happens, for never-explained reasons, to be a sentient egg in Power Armor, and becomes one of Harley's little gang of weirdos in Coney Island.

    Comic Strips 

-   _U.S. Acres_ as well the animated version in _Garfield and Friends_ has Sheldon, a little chicken who hasn't completely hatched from his egg (but doesn't want to do it), being basically a talking egg with legs and a most extreme case of Eggshell Clothing.

    Fairy Tales 

-   The titular character from the Nursery Rhyme "Humpty Dumpty" is an egg that fell from sitting on a wall and shattered to pieces. All the king's horses and men were unable to put him back together again. (Actually, it's not entirely clear that the poem was originally about an egg, since it never says so explicitly; if it was, it may have originated as a riddle, with the riddle part being lost when the answer became universally known.)

    Films — Animation 

-   Just as the Nursery Rhyme, Humpty Dumpty from _Puss in Boots (2011)_ is a talking egg with clothes who has a life of his own. Different from the story, he's one of Puss's friends before meeting Shrek and he's a Manipulative Bastard who uses Puss for his own ulterior motives. When his shell is broken, it turns out that he's a golden egg laid by the goose from another nursery rhyme; it Makes Just as Much Sense in Context.
-   _Una película de huevos_ and its sequels, like _Huevocartoon TV_ feature walking, talking eggs, but feature them in the human world with the Animal Talk trope in play. Also, most unhatched eggs have some attributes which help identify their true animal species. Reptilian eggs, for example, are usually green in coloration, have slit pupils, sharp teeth, and, in Serp's case, fully developed tails signaling the impending emergence of the hatchling inside.

    Literature 

-   _The Big Over Easy_ is about the investigation of the suspicious death of Humpty Dumpty <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , who, like in the nursery rhyme, is a large (about 4.5 ft tall), anthropomorphic egg with a love of sitting on walls. The fact that Humpty is an egg factors into his characterization, as he has a crippling fear of mongooses and egg timers, and also into his death, since it's eventually revealed _he hatched_.
-   One of the stories in _My Great-Grandfather, the Heroes and I_ by James Krüss takes place in an entire town of living eggs, where the mayor, a rotten egg called Adolf, spreads hatred of hard-boiled eggs among the townsfolk.
-   A literal expy of Humpty Dumpty from the nursery rhyme appears in the _Thursday Next_ book _The Well of Lost Plots_, as the leader of a union of characters from the oral tradition demanding better treatment and their own home in the Bookverse. Like in the nursery rhyme, he's a large, anthropomorphic egg.
-   In _Through the Looking Glass_, Alice encounters Humpty Dumpty, the nursery rhyme character, a very argumentative fellow. Like in the rhyme, he's a large, anthropomorphic egg who loves sitting on walls. He wears a suit with what is either a cravat or a cummerbund (unclear as he doesn't have a neck).

    Live-Action TV 

-   Both the British and Australian incarnations of the children's program, _Play School_ features the character of Humpty Dumpty imagined as an anthropomorphic egg. Humpty is a plush doll in-show, but the presenters speak for him in skits.

    Music 

-   The video to "Coming Around" by Travis features an egg with arms and legs (but no eyes, ears or mouth... yet people in-universe can apparently hear him talking) who is invited to a concert by a human woman and spends the video trying to get there. Unfortunately he gets attacked by a gang of youths and ends up falling off a wall, Humpty Dumpty-style... and _hatches_, revealing singer Fran Healy inside.

    Toys 

-   Frug from the _Gogo's Crazy Bones_ series _Power_ is an anthropomorphic egg with arms. According to his official bio, he comes first _and_ last at everything at the same time, a trait that's confusing even to him (this might be a reference to the "which came first, the chicken or the egg?" question). Frug's Wanted variation is decorated like an Easter egg.
-   Rotten Egg from _The Grossery Gang_ is an expired egg that was mutated from the gross conditions of the Yucky Mart, bringing him to life. A crack on his shell makes up his mouth, and he has various spots where his yolk is leaking from him as well. His animated counterpart, Egghead, has added limbs as well. A few variants of him in special Easter packages gave him various colors to make him look like a rotten Easter egg instead.
-   _Tamagotchi_: The Gotchi King is a Tamagotchi resembling a giant golden egg with limbs or facial features.

    _\[... if the shop menu is entered and exited, even if nothing was bought\]_

    -   Zigzagged with the Pokémon Exeggcute. It consists of six sentient eggs, of which some have visible cracks. However, certain Pokédex entries specify them more as being seeds, while still referring to them as the egg Pokémon. Other entries call them eggs, leaving it up to ambiguous as to whether or not they actually are eggs.
    -   Downplayed with Chansey, who is classified as the "Egg Pokémon", being egg-shaped and having one in her pouch. Although besides those indicators, it is unclear whether or not she is supposed to literally be an egg or any other sort of creature.
    -   Togepi skirts on the edge of this trope— it resembles a walking cracked egg, with its yellow body as the "yolk", but its evolutions make it clear that it's simply a creature that wears Eggshell Clothing.
