One of the characters may get their finger hurt (most likely when preparing food). Another character will then come in and suck on the wound in order for the finger to heal better. Expect the person having their finger sucked to blush and act embarassed by this physical intimacy.

This trope is often a form of Ship Tease and/or Intimate Healing. Compare Kiss of the Vampire for a supernatural variant or Suck Out the Poison for a toxic variant. Sometimes not entirely unrelated to Erotic Eating. Contrast Romance-Inducing Smudge.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You_: Nano performs this on Rentarou after he accidentally cuts himself. She only realizes this was a questionable idea after she gets home that day.
-   In the _All-New Tenchi Muyo!_ manga series, a robotic Tenchi devised by Washu does this with Ayeka when she cuts her finger. Both Ayeka and Sasami (who just returned with the first-aid kit) both blush at the action.
-   In _Basilisk_, the female ninja Hotarubi sucks the wounded finger of her lover (who was bitten by her pet snake, crossing this trope over with Suck Out the Poison). Her "_pissed but devoted_" face is striking.
-   In _Ceres, Celestial Legend_, Yuuhi does this to Aya without thinking. Granted, no one should have given her a knife since this was soon after Touya lost all his memories of her, and she stirs from her stupor to freak out a bit.
-   _Choujin Sensen_: FEE suckled and licked Tomobiki's bleeding finger to draw away the pain.
-   Happens in _El Cazador de la Bruja_ with Nadie sucking on Ellis's hurt finger.
-   In a similar anime, _Gakuen Heaven_, Keita gets thrown and locked into a shed by two bullies, injuring his elbow. Another student frees him, and as they're walking in a wooded area notices Keita holding his elbow. He then grabs Keita, pulls his sleeve down, and licks the wound several times, claiming to have been disinfecting it, which Keita seems to believe...but really, saliva doesn't do a very good job as a disinfectant.
-   In _Hellsing_ (manga and OVA version), in order to goad Seras into drinking live human blood (something she's been avoiding in order to hold on to her humanity), Integra cuts her finger with a knife and _orders Seras to lick it_. (The ensuing scene plays out the Les Yay for all it's worth: Seras is on her knees and has a Luminescent Blush, a smirking Integra reminds Seras not to bite down, and the whole scene is framed like a porn film.)
-   In _High School D×D_, Issei has to have the magic sucked out of his left arm routinely to stop it mutating back into a dragon limb in public. He usually gets the team's magic expert, Akeno, to do it. She usually does it kneeling in front of him with his hand near his crotch. She's fully aware of what she's doing, too.
-   _Inuyasha the Movie: Affections Touching Across Time_: Inu-Yasha does this to Kagome in the first movie when she accidentally cuts her finger, causing her to blush.
-   In one episode of _Junjou Romantica_ Usagi gets Misaki to suck his injured finger. It's just as awkward as it sounds.
-   _Macross Frontier_:
    -   Alto attempts this on Sheryl, but she slaps him away because she has a fatal V-Type infection, which can be spread by blood.
    -   Played straight in the first movie. During a date scene, Alto sucks the blood from Sheryl's finger when she cuts them after falling off a scooter. All the while overlooking a breathtaking meadow and lakeside landscape.
-   Rei does this for Kira in the first volume of _Mars (1996)_.
-   _Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch_: One of Kaito and Lucia's more memorable scenes occurs when Lucia pricks her finger, Kaito sucks on it, and Lucia completely ruins the mood by accidentally stepping on the remote control for the stereo system, surprising the both of them with blaring music.
-   Despite all the injuries Kouta was suffering from at the time, Seiji of _Midori Days_ does this to him.
-   _My Little Sister Stole My Fiance_: Greed sucks on Eliana's finger in order to remove a splinter, much to her embarrassment.
-   _Mysterious Girlfriend X_: Inverted (by switching the healer/healed roles), where Akira sucks Mikoto's drool off her finger every day, because he's addicted to it.
-   _Naruto_: Gaara does this to his uncle Yashamaru.
-   _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_: Used for laughs and Ship Tease when Konoka does it to Setsuna. Knowing Konoka, she's totally aware of the flirtatiousness of the action.
-   _Ninja Nonsense_: Kaede's mother sucks Shinobu's finger this way after a cooking accident.
-   In episode 5 of _Nyaruko: Crawling with Love! Second Season_, Cuuko starts sucking on Mahiro's finger after he accidentally cuts it. She explains that her body temperature would sterilize the wound, due of her being, you know, Cthugha, the Burning One.
-   _Ouran High School Host Club_: The twins do this for their fangirls.
-   Mizutama does this to Miharu in _Pump Up_ when she pokes herself with a sewing needle.
-   Done in _Sailor Moon_, when Haruka gets her hand injured with a glass shard from Nehelenia's Magic Mirror. Michiru then sucks on her injury to try getting the shard out and succeeds, then spits it out on her handkerchief. Then Haruka notices dark energy coming from the shard and knocks it away from Michiru; it transforms into a glass monster, and they have to fight it alongside others.
-   In _Saint Beast_, Judas can actually heal wounds by placing his lips on them, making it a pretty effective strategy actually.
-   Done by Karasuma to Tenma in _School Rumble_.
-   Ren attempts this in _Skip Beat!_ to his co-star, during a test run on how to act his own character of the series out. Before any lip contact can happen, though, the co-star freaks out and pulls her hand away.
-   _Str.A.In.: Strategic Armored Infantry_ has Lavinia plant an invisible tack on a control pad so that Sara will injure her finger in order for Lavinia to play out this trope with her. It doesn't work, as someone else gets to Sara first.
-   _Strawberry Shake Sweet_: Ran does it to Julia in chapter 4, for instant Nosebleed.
-   _Tsukihime_: In one just for fun doujinshi short by Crazy Clover Club, Shiki does this for Arcueid the vampire; suddenly realizing that by licking her blood, he's probably doomed himself to becoming a vampire.
    -   Another 4Koma reverses it - Shiki gets injured, Arcueid sucks his finger, and the romantic moment is ruined by her bloodlust flaring up at that exact moment.
        -   Both of which are likely references to the finger-sucking scene in the original game, as told below (which became Memetic Mutation for Hisui).
-   In one chapter of _Whispered Words_, Sumika and Miyako have a contest to see who can prepare a better meal. Sumika imagines cutting her finger while chopping vegetables, followed by Ushio sucking on the finger in question.
-   Subverted in _The World God Only Knows_. Keima rants about how ditzy demon Elsee can't really be his little sister, since they don't have the same blood in their bodies. Elsee promptly bites his outstretched finger and swallows the blood in an attempt to prove she _can_ be his little sister. Keima doesn't take this well.

    Audio Plays 

-   Hajime from the third volume _Yandere Heaven_ does this to his stepdaughter, the protagonist when she cuts herself.

    Comic Books 

-   Weaponized by The Joker in _Batman Versus The Incredible Hulk_, where he tosses a rose to one of his henchmen, who pricks his fingers on its thorns. Said henchman instinctively sucks on the affected finger — absorbing the poison on the thorns, and dying with a rictus grin.

    Films — Animation 

-   _Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea_. Interesting because Ponyo's still a goldfish and the main character's cut actually heals instantly. The fact that she drank his blood is actually a significant plot point.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In many versions of _Dracula_ (particularly _Nosferatu_), the first sign something is wrong with the Count is when Harker nicks himself with a bread knife and his host insists on sucking the wound.
-   In _My Super Ex-Girlfriend_, Hannah sucks on Matt's finger to remove a splinter.
-   In _Casino Royale_, Bond sucks on Vesper Lynd's fingers when she is going into shock after the brutal fight against Obanno where both of them almost got killed (she's never seen someone being killed in front of herself before).
-   Done in _Interview with the Vampire_ by Claudia to a seamstress who pricked her finger, before she killed her.
-   In _Jennifer's Body_, Needy sucked on Jennifer's finger when they were small children.
-   Harry sucks his finger after an owl bites him in _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_
-   This happens in _Little Shop of Horrors_ during "Grow For Me". After Seymour pricks his finger on a rose's thorns, he start sucking on it. When he saw Audrey II making kissing sounds, he assumes it wants to do the same. It doesn't.
-   In _How I Live Now_, Eddie does this for Daisy when she cuts her finger on a fence, which begins a romance between them. At the end of the film, she does the same for him when he cuts his while gardening.
-   Played for Laughs in _Hot Shots! Part Deux_. After a fight, Ramada tears off some of her clothing to bandage Topper's wound. Her other (male) comrades start claiming injuries, too, with one saying he's got "a real gusher". Then he sticks his finger in his mouth.

    Literature 

-   _Sleeping Beauty_, in at least one version, is raped and carries twins to term while sleeping (because you can, without any way of providing nutrients for them). This trope comes into play when one of the twins accidentally sucks the poisoned splinter out while attempting to nurse.
-   Callum does this to Sephy's cut finger in _Noughts & Crosses_.
-   In _Artemis Fowl_, Mulch does this to his thumbs after burning them while deflecting a fire-based attack from an angry goblin. Justified by the fact that dwarf saliva has a mild healing balm property.

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Doctor Who_: In "Orphan 55", the final stage of recovery from a hopper virus is to suck your thumb until the hallucinations of bats stop. Ryan meets Bella when they're both sitting on the floor doing this.
-   In _Due South_, Fraser tells of how he met Victoria, the former lover/criminal/all around crazy woman he was tracking. They get stranded in a blizzard in Canada, and in order to prevent frostbite he puts her fingers in his mouth. It somehow manages to be erotic, sweet, and heartbreaking all at once.

    Video Games 

-   The introductory cinematic for _Rule of Rose_ shows Meg cut her finger on a rose thorn, with Diana (who she is in love with) sucks the wound. She doesn't love her back. This scene reaffirms Meg's devotion to Diana, but also Diana's status as a Manipulative Bitch. The fact that she was the one who made Meg cut herself (by squeezing her hands onto the rose stalk) makes it even more evident.

    Visual Novels 

-   _Aoi Shiro_ has Nami do this to Syouko. It works a little better than most because of Nami's healing powers.
-   In Yuri's route in _Doki Doki Literature Club!_ during Chapter 1, the protagonist gets a cut from one of Yuri's collection of fancy knives, and Yuri sucks on the tip of his finger to stop the bleeding. Once she realizes what she's doing, she immediately goes into Shrinking Violet mode, complete with a Crush Blush. Word of God explains<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  this is a Parodied Trope while being Played Straight, because it's just done the usual way but it's likely ridiculous to the people actually playing this.
-   In _Remember11_, Yomogi does this to Kokoro after she accidentally cuts herself on a knife. Hilarity Ensues when there's a personality transfer in the middle of it, and Satoru-in-Kokoro's-body flips out, not knowing what's going on.
-   Maki of _Shojokyuu Kurige no Shiofuki Shoujotachi_ does Finger Suck Healing on Class Representative Tomoe to flirt with her after the latter suffers a paper cut.
-   In _Sono Hanabira Ni Kuchizuke Wo_, Mai does this to Reo when Mai is teaching Reo to cook.
-   _Tsukihime_: Shiki does this to Hisui in one route. What he doesn't know is that she's a Synchronizer, and that her blood (and other bodily fluids) can be used to transfer mana, so he ends up enjoying it more than he'd anticipated.
    -   Receives a Call-Back during their route's sex scene, with Hisui sucking on Shiki's finger. Subverted as it's not because he's injured, but because Hisui is caught up in the moment and reenacting their first "intimate" physical contact.
