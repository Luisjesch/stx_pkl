How does she NOSE that?

_"You can't fool THIS nose!"_

A common superpower, especially among characters with animal themes: super-powerful smell abilities.

They Have the Scent! may come into play.

The werewolf is likely to have them, along with other canine or lupine characters.

They are a particular danger to those with a Secret Identity.

May be a form of Charles Atlas Superpower. Often used to handwave the Scarily Competent Tracker and sometimes Kung-Fu Clairvoyance as well. Detecting blood may make them the Violence Detector. If food is involved, see Follow Your Nose. Nose Tapping may be used to indicate that they do know. If this ability is inherent in one's species, it's a case of Bizarre Alien Senses. See Visible Odor when the smell trace is made visible to the audience.

-   Toucan Sam, the mascot of Froot Loops, has the ability to smell out his cereal from up to several miles away. This probably counts, as most toucans probably don't have nearly so well honed a sense of smell.
-   There was a pair of commercials for Saranwrap that demonstrated the ability of their product using an animal's keen senses. One commercial had a caged tiger, the other a bear. The unseen testers wrapped one piece of meat with Saranwrap and another with the rival brand. Then the cage door opened. In both cases, the animal went for the one not wrapped in Saranwrap; because neither animal will eat what they can't smell, this shows Saranwrap is a better "barrier" to substances that would cause odor (and spoilage).
-   Raid featured commercials for its Ant & Roach spray where the cartoon roach couldn't smell the Raid, either because it came in a Country Fresh scent, because it had no lingering chemical odor, or because it was made with natural plant oils. Either way, by the time the bugs figured it out, it was too late. RAAAIIIDDD!!!

    Anime & Manga 

-   Mike Zacharius from _Attack on Titan_ is said to have a nose so sensitive that it can track Titans further than human sight. He can even smell how many Titans will appear.
-   The Baoh parasite has an extremely capable sense of smell, able to detect Killing Intent via scent, among other abilities. There's a catch, though: when the parasite is in control of the host, it is completely blind, so disabling its sense of smell renders the host utterly unable to detect their surroundings.
-   Multiple characters in _Beastars_, most often Legoshi (a wolf) uses scent to track down recurring Damsel in Distress Haru, he can even tell if somebody has touched her and if they've hurt her. While romantic rival Juno uses scent to stalk Legoshi, and one time verifies that Legoshi and Haru didn't have sex after they spent a night away from school by sniffing her.
-   _Black Butler_: Devil in Disguise Sebastian has a keen sense of smell as good as or better than a dog's, and can detect people, corpses, and blood from a distance. It's so acute, he can even detect a needle prick.
-   _Bleach_:
    -   On one occasion early in the story, Orihime can tell where Ichigo is because she can smell him. This may be a deliberate clue to the reader that she's developing spiritual powers because shinigami tend to describe detecting spiritual power as "catching the scent" of a being's spiritual presence. It's very common to see shinigami commenting on the fact they can "smell" hollows nearby as a result of this.
    -   Yumichika sensed the coming of Grimmjow's group by catching the unusually strange hollow scent they gave off. When he alerted Ikkaku, he was told to ignore it, but he continued to privately think it strange. When Hitsugaya's team is finally attacked, Yumichika is the only one who is not surprised. Later on, he claims to have uncovered the secret that Giselle is a man because she smells of semen. It drives Giselle into a fury and, for the rest of their fight, Yumichika continues to bait her with the subject. Amusingly, the zombified Charlotte Chuhlhourne makes a similar accusation through the same method, further driving Giselle into a rage.
-   Diva and Saya from _Blood+_ are both vampires. They can smell good, and when Diva says to someone that he smells delicious, it's time to flee.
-   Fuuko in _CLANNAD_. Good God, when she said that she'd memorized Ushio's scent, she wasn't kidding. She tracked her down by scent even in an alternate timeline.
-   Clare from _Claymore_ once said that she smelled the smell of a yoma on Raki, so she knew she had to follow him to find the yoma. She also constantly smells blood on her body because the process of transformation has so messed her up. Later, an Awakened Being says that Raki smells delicious, and she wants to eat him that way.
-   Tanjiro from _Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba_ has a practically supernatural sense of smell that can detect not only the locations of demons from their distinct odor, but also someone's _personality_: according to him, fellow slayers Zenitsu and Inosuke give off kind and honest scents.
-   Son Goku from _Dragon Ball_ has a strong sense of smell that allowed him to find a rock thrown off of a cliff by Kame-Sennin ("Master Roshi") and know Bulma is approaching from a great distances only by sniffing her scent. It also cause poor Goku to collapse on the floor when he met Bacterian, since the stench was so horrible that Goku's very sensitive nose couldn't stand it.
-   _Fairy Tail_:
    -   The Dragon Slayers all have a very good sense of smell due to their brand of magic giving them the senses of dragons. Dragons of course also have keen senses of smell, or at least the ones that actually have noses.
    -   Ichiya has a good sense of smell as well, probably because of his perfume magic, but his extends all the way to being able to Detect Evil by scent alone.
-   _Fate/Apocrypha_:
    -   When Mordred and Semiramis meet for the first time, although they were on opposite sides of the room, Mordred is able to tell from her scent that Semiramis is similar to her mother, Morgan Le Fay. She's right as Semiramis and Morgan are both black witches known for treachery.
    -   Jack the Ripper is able to tell if someone is male or female by sniffing them (for example, Mordred who disguises her identity and gender with her armor). This is significant because one of Jack's abilities only works on women.
-   Kasumi Kenshiro of _Fist of the Blue Sky_ invokes this trope. He is said to have a sense of smell equal to a dog, and it is an important plot element in several episodes, as Kenshiro uses his sense of smell to detect poisons, bomb chemicals, and track people across an entire city. Apparently, this is just him, as none of the other Hokuto style practitioners display this ability.
    -   Kenshiro of _Fist of the North Star_ also has this ability, but he rarely uses it in the series.
-   _Franken Fran_'s Gavrill has a sense of smell so developed that she can deduce the perpetrators of a crime as well as exactly what happened just by smelling the crime scene.
-   _Fullmetal Alchemist_:
    -   Dolcetto is a human chimera who had his genetic material combined with that of a dog, giving him a very heightened sense of smell.
    -   We later see two other chimera who can fight by smell. Ed counters it by finding some old dynamite and overwhelming them with the smell of the ammonia he converts the ammonium nitrate into. They also use this to fight Gluttony and Pride when the lights need to be turned out to make it easier to fight Pride.
    -   Gluttony himself has a very good nose. Pride eats him to get his nasal sense, so he's less in disadvantage.
-   Reipin from _Fushigi Yuugi: Byakko Ibun_ has such a good sense of smell that she can find her newfound friend Nirusha solely by his scent. It's one of the first hints to her identity as the daughter of a Shapeshifter.
-   In _Kemono Jihen_, Kemono give off a distinctively bad smell that distinguishes them from humans. In Kabane's case, he was relentlessly teased for it and was sent to work in the rice fields as a result, getting compared to an earthbound spirit covered in manure, a Dorotabo. To address this, Kemono have developed a special cologne that masks their smell.
-   This was Apollo's special 'psychic power' in _Genesis of Aquarion_. While it might seem like a rather poor ability when compared to those of his comrades, (like Pyrokinesis, Telekinesis, Super-Strength and Teleportation) it proves to be one of the most useful powers on the course of series, being capable of smelling things like microscopic organism (from several feet away, when inside a cockpit!) and immaterial beings.
    -   This ability is also present in Kagura from _Aquarion Evol_, which shouldn't be surprising given that he's reincarnated from the above, though his _actual_ power is much more... abusable. This series also explains that their heightened sense of smell is not so much an Element power as much because Apollo is the reincarnation of a dog.
-   In _Guardian Fairy Michel_, Lady Salome can smell out treasure.
-   _Heterogenia Linguistico_: Much of werewolf communication is based on smell rather than sound or body language. Hakaba, having a human's limited sense of smell, finds it tough to keep up.
-   _Inuyasha_:
    -   Inuyasha has a keen scene of smell, occasionally having him track enemies by scent and be able to tell that there's trouble in a nearby village because he can smell human blood. It's also caused Sensory Overload a few times, but no enemy has deliberately attempted to exploit it.
    -   Sesshoumaru's sense of smell is even better than Inuyasha's. He once caught the scent of something that was many miles away and produced only by a tiny sliver of flesh. He can also smell spirits that are in the area but haven't even manifested. Unlike Inuyasha, Sesshoumaru has never been put in a position where the sensitivity of his nose can be used against him except in situations where the Big Bad has deliberately set up a scent trail for him to follow in an effort to lead him into a trap.
    -   Koga also has a good sense of smell. It is implied that it is the case with many youkai.
-   Yuya Fungami from _JoJo's Bizarre Adventure_ Part 4. He has a strong sense of smell which he acquired from siphoning energy from others. He could tell if a peach has gone bad from across the room, and track down a person with scent.
-   _Kirakira Pre Cure A La Mode_: Cure Chocolat has an extra-strong sense of smell as part of her dog motif.
-   Morgiana from _Magi: Labyrinth of Magic_ can smell good enough to find humans around her that way. She can also hear well.
-   _Medaka Box_: Zenkichi is able to detect Medaka's former holding location in the South Pole through scent alone.
-   _Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid_:
    -   Tohru is able to track down Kanna and Saikawa when they get lost in _Kanna's Daily Life_ by following Kobayashi's scent on Kanna's backpack charm.
    -   In the main series, Ilulu does this at Kobayashi's suggestion in order to find the owner of a lost doll. However, the rain washes away the scent before she can find them.
-   _Naruto_: This is one of Kiba's special abilities (eventually said to grow to the point that it's _better_ than the dogs he would fight with), though it blows up in his face spectacularly (pun intended) during the Tournament Arc battle against Naruto.
    -   Him and his clan are really only the most outstanding example, as both the Third Hokage and Kakashi have shown to have rather acute sense of smell, the latter of which became critical to finding Akatsuki member Sasori.
-   In what can only be described an... odd variation, _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ has Chamo and Jack Rakan locating an enemy in an enormous barrier dimension... by tracing the scent of her panties which Rakan stole earlier. With alarming precision.
-   Sanji from _One Piece_ is able to discern the ingredients and even recipe of any food simply through its fragrance, such as that of Struesen's secret wedding cake.
-   In _Pokémon Adventures_, Sapphire, among her various Super-Senses, has such an enhanced sense of smell to the point that she can somewhat navigate even when blinded. Marlon also has a good sense of smell, though specifically to water. He can tell where a water-based Pokémon originally came from.
    -   In _Pokémon: The Series_, when Ash's Pokémon were lost in a huge pile of Pokéballs, Pikachu was successfully able to sniff them out.
-   Several youkai in _Rosario + Vampire_ can do that too, because they say several times that Tsukune, posing as a youkai, smells like a human being.
-   _Saki_ has the Tsuruga Mahjong Club's president, Kanbara, who was revealed in the bonus chapter of Volume 7 to be capable of detecting people by scent. This even bypasses Momo's stealth mode, which works by making people ignore her presence.
-   For a guy whose head is just a helmet Kikuchiyo from _Samurai 7_ has damn good sense of smell. The Emperor found out the hard way.
-   In one episode of _Sasami: Magical Girls Club_, Sasami and the others are lost in an underground labyrinth, until Amitav arrives. He tells Sasami that he recognized her scent, causing the other girls to wonder if he has a really good sense of smell or if Sasami just stinks.
-   In _Sands of Destruction_, Wolfmen are shown to be Scarily Competent Trackers thanks to a canine's sense of smell, and Rhi'a tracks down the World Destruction Committee thanks to Kyrie's scent lingering on Morte.
-   Goku from _Saiyuki_ has an enhanced sense of smell. Mostly he uses it for finding food, but he manages to search for other things as well, such as when he tracks down Gonou/Hakkai by the scent of blood after his wound reopened. At one point he also comments on the arc's villain Chin Yisou "not smelling alive", giving Hakkai a clue about the villain's nature.
-   _Shimoneta_:
    -   Anna's so crazy for Tanukichi, that she can track him by his scent, especially in regard to his underwear. Despite his hygiene, she can still detect the scent of his boxers from halfway across campus. Which is why, during episode 11, he has to repeatedly scrub himself with soap and water to keep Anna from seeing through his disguise.
    -   Likewise, White Peak has such a fetish for women's underwear that his nose can literally detect the scent of freshly worn panties from over _a mile_ away! Ayame uses it to SOX's advantage in episode 11, by using _her own_ panties as bait to lure White Peak to them.
-   Tsujido, Suitengu's right hand man from _Speed Grapher_ has a super sense of smell as his euphoric power.
-   In _Sweat And Soap_, Kotaro Natori's highly developed sense of smell has made him a celebrity at his soap-making company. It also allows him to track his girlfriend as well as tell if she's happy or sad.
-   In _Tokyo Ghoul_, Ghouls inherently have better senses than a human, allowing them to identify each other by scent. But some individuals are noted to have an exceptional sense of smell, often serving as trackers and lookouts when members of a gang. Nico and Hinami are both noted for their abilities, allowing them to effectively track the faintest scent for miles. In the sequel, Urie's keen sense of smell gives him an edge in hunting Ghouls, while Takizawa's nose is so keen that Kurona jokes that he might have some dog mixed in there.
-   _Toriko_: At one point, Toriko picks up the tracks of someone who had been there **years** earlier, through the vast amount of other creatures that had been there since.
-   In _Wolf Children_, Souhei is somehow able to smell dog-like scent coming from the half-wolf Yuki when he first meets her, prompting him to ask her if she owns a dog. This leads Yuki to become self-conscious about herself and try and distance herself from him.
-   In _Yu-Gi-Oh!_, Joey's nose is apparently so good he can smell the perfume Mai uses to tag her cards from the opposite side of a dueling arena. Good thing he'd managed to get over that cold he'd caught at the beginning of the episode.
    -   Mai's ability to identify 60 or so cards apart by different perfumes is pretty impressive itself. It's Truth in Television — Veteran perfume-makers are often capable of recognizing hundreds of different scents.
-   Nozomi from _Yes! Pretty Cure 5_ has a so good nose that she smells a crépe's smell on a little part of a flyer.

    Asian Animation 

-   _Noonbory and the Super 7_: Fitting with the Super-Senses theme, Pongdybory's power is an enhanced sense of smell, which he uses to locate people and items. Unfortunately, he also has really bad allergies.

    Comic Books 

The DCU

-   _Justice Society of America_: Dr. Mid-Nite II has an enhanced sense of smell. In _JSA Classified_ when a villain took the goggles which allow him to use infrared vision he was able to use his sense of smell to detect a flameable gas in the room that the two villains couldn't detect.
-   Sensor Girl of the Legion of Super-Heroes, who is actually Princess Projectra.
    -   Timber Wolf too, seeing he's the Legion's resident feral.
-   Part of the reason Lobo is one of the greatest bounty hunters in the DC Universe is that he can track people by smell across _interstellar distances_. Once he has your scent, there is nowhere in the universe you can hide from him.
    -   In _Injustice: Gods Among Us_ he can track Harley Quinn by her scent, and he even can smell "craziness".
-   Superman has a super-sense of smell as well; it's just that with his other super-senses, he rarely needs to use it. (Probably the only sense of his that _isn't_ enhanced is his sense of touch, as it conflicts with his invulnerability.)
    -   He may have been hallucinating, but at least once Superman claimed to smell brownies in North Dakota from aboard the JLA's Watchtower satellite.
-   Krypto the Super-Dog has a keen sense of smell, being a dog. He's saved the day tracking Poison Ivy's scent, or that of other villains, many times.

Marvel Universe

-   _Black Panther_: T'Challa's powers include a preternaturally accurate sense of smell.
    -   During one altercation, he defeats a foe while blinded by using his superior sense of smell to track the villain's location.
    -   _Avengers: Back to Basics_: In the second story arc, T'Challa realizes that Carol isn't a Skrull imposter like they'd been led to believe because she still carries her own scent, and there's no trickery in the universe that can fool his nose.
-   Blade's sense of smell is slightly superhuman and he's especially good at sniffing out vampires.
-   Daredevil. Matt's sense of smell is sometimes exaggerated beyond all credibility, especially when they're downplaying the radar sense. His sense of smell is so acute that he can distinguish between identical twins at twenty feet by minute differences in smell. He can detect odors of an atmospheric concentration of thirty parts per million <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> . Further, his ability to remember smells enables him to identify any person he has spent at least five minutes with by smell alone, no matter how he or she might try to camouflage his or her natural odor. His powers of concentration are such that he can focus upon a single person's smell and follow it through a crowd of people at a distance of fifty feet.
-   Fantastic Four villain the Mole Man has this, along with excellent hearing, both to make up for his poor eyesight.
-   Puma in the _Spider-Man_ comics. He easily determined Spider-Man's secret identity. As did Wolverine.
-   Wolfsbane, a werewolf in the original New Mutants, has this.
    -   As does Catseye, a were-giant purple cat in the original Hellions.
-   In _Werewolf by Night_, Jack Russell's werewolf curse grants him an enhanced sense of smell even in human form, which also enables him to smell emotions. Once he uses it to sniff out a pedophile simply by the scent he gives off around children, seeing right through the man's feigned disinterest.
-   Wolverine and Sabretooth have this as a major ability. Wolverine's makes him the go-to person for identifying impersonators; it seems that even if you can change everything from your voice, hair color, and the shape and color of your body, you can't change how you smell.
    -   He's even used a _lack_ of smell to identify that something's fishy, likening it to a big dark spot in the middle of an otherwise well-lit room.
    -   His daughter/Opposite-Sex Clone X-23's senses may be even _better_. Laura's been able to smell a man lying when even Logan couldn't, was able to isolate the scent of her cousin and her kidnapper even after the room had been contaminated with other searchers, _and_ rapidly locate them in the middle of _San Francisco_. Since Logan and Laura's enhanced senses are a side effect of their Healing Factor, this may be because Laura's is much stronger since hers isn't constantly fighting adamantium poisoning.
    -   Daken demonstrates this, as well

Other

-   _Angel Catbird_: The cat-people have a heightened sense of smell.
-   _Doctor Who Magazine_: In the comic strip "The Love Invasion", the Doctor is able to work out that the Lend-a-Hand girls aren't human because they smell odd. Rose even refers to his sense of smell as "the infallible space nose".

-   Bigby from _Fables_, being the Big Bad Wolf, has a very strong sense of smell. According to him, the reason he's such a heavy smoker is that cigarettes help deaden his sense of smell so that he can cope with the information overload of smells that come from living in a city.
-   Zato-Ino, "The Blind Swordspig" from _Usagi Yojimbo_, can "see" things thanks to his sense of smell, even after he lost his nose in a duel against Usagi and replaced it with a wooden prosthesis.

He also once managed to track a missing earring entirely with his sense of smell.
-   In _Calvin and Hobbes_, Hobbes has a good sense of smell, and has unique words for different smells, such as "snippid" for burning leaves. (When Calvin asks what the word for _his_ smell is, Hobbes says "terrible", causing Calvin to chase after him.)
-   _Peanuts_
    -   In a very early strip, Snoopy is able to smell someone who is just _thinking_ about food! In a later strip, catching a whiff of his favorite food — pizza — enables him to make a fast dash out of his doghouse before a huge icicle crashes down on it.

    Fan Works 

-   _Abraxas (Hrodvitnon)_:
-   In _The Beast Of Gusu_, a shifter’s superior sense of smell allows them to discover other shifters, read other’s emotions, track certain scents and gives them a good sense of who’s trustworthy. The exception (at least initially) is Lan Wangji, whom Wei Wuxian notes he can’t read.
-   Feral in _Bird_ has a powerful sense of smell (in addition to nightvision and several other minor powers). Her sense of smell is specifically described as much stronger than a bloodhound's, and is powerful enough to serve as a mild empath sense and lie detector. It's enough to count as a minor Thinker power by itself.
-   In _Code: Half Demon_, Inuyasha's nose is used for tracking. He track's Odd's scent at one point, which was mainly Odd's _feet_... The authoress hit two or three birds with one stone there. Inuyasha was surprised that the stench of Odd's smelly feet didn't knock him out considering those feet knock out almost everyone,and said everyone were all _HUMAN_.

-   In _Farce Contact_, a _Star Trek: Enterprise_ Parody Fic, T'Pol's dislike over how humans smell is due to its similarity to the scent a rutting Vulcan male emits every seven years. It can be smelt for vast distances by the sensitive nose of a female Vulcan, and is therefore known as the _pong farr_.
-   _I'm Nobody_: According to Axel, he, Zexion, and Riku are able to sense magic via smell - as in, magic registers as a scent to them. He compares it to being able to smell smoke from a campfire from a very long distance.
-   In 'Nexus' This is how Jack was able to realize he was about to get attacked by Scarecrows. He also deduces that while in the Demon World, that if he could smell the demons, they could smell him. More specifically they could smell his Sparda blood.
-   _Queen of All Oni_: At some point after her encounter with Lung, Jade develops a heightened, animalistic sense of smell.
-   _The Rigel Black Chronicles_: Harry and Archie get concerned when Remus announces that he's becoming a teacher at Hogwarts, because as a werewolf, he'll be able to tell them apart by scent, especially near the full moon, and realise that Harry is at Hogwarts instead of Archie. They eventually settle on Harry making a perfume from _Archie's sweat_ to use before Defence class.
-   Whatever Cangse Sanren is is _Skin A Cat_, she has a very strong sense of smell. She uses it in-story to smell both period blood and even a pregnancy.
-   _That Weird Feeling_: In this Fanfic based on the classic Universal Monsters, and specially focused on Dracula's Daughter Marya Zaleska and The Bride of Frankenstein as protagonists, Countess Marya Zaleska have a great sense of smell, by being a vampire. She can detect individual scents from anything, as she smelled The Bride of Frankenstein's scent which is described as sweet, musky, and healthy, but with a bit of death and electrical burns. Also, Marya can detect the scents from foods as bread and tell if they are able to eat (for mortals).
-   In the _Worm_ x _Bloodborne_ crossover _Hunter_, Sophia manages to smell a number of scents off of Taylor... including one that shouldn't exist.
    
    A sweet, coppery smell, not quite hiding a more musky odor, like she'd been rolling around with dogs. And under that... Sophia took a sharp breath as something in her brain pulsed, twisting like the start of a migraine. It was the faint scent of the color of moonlight, so completely impossible to think of because _it didn't exist_.
    
-   When George becomes an animal in _With Strings Attached_, he gains that animal's sense of smell, though he only had need of it a few times (mostly to track Ringo when he disappeared into the forest).
    -   George finds more use for a sense of smell in _The Keys Stand Alone: The Soft World_, mostly when he's a centaur, and he also becomes a bloodhound to track the missing Kyran Datoro.
        -   Also, the Svenjaya know that the disguised George and Ringo really are outworlders because Ringo smells like one. (George doesn't, because he'd turned into a G'heddi'onian, but as Sima points out, they just assumed his disguise was better because they'd never met a G'heddi'onian who vacationed with a disguised outworlder before.)
-   _The Red Dragon's Saber_: Koneko, a Cat Girl, smells dragon when around Artoria Pendragon, though she mistakes Artoria for a dragon that has taken human form instead of someone with Dragon Ancestry.
-   _The Loud House_ fanfiction _The Nightmare House_, Lily's nightmare involves a monster smelling her before seeing her.
-   In _The Changeling of the Guard_, thestrals turn out to be able to detect changelings in disguise because changelings give off a very distinct scent. A scent that thestrals really, _really_ appreciate. Played with in that this ability to detect changelings is revealed long before the Canterlot invasion happens, meaning that none of the thestrals in the Guard have any idea why it is that Idol, a disguised changeling exile, smells so unique.
-   _OSMU: Fanfiction Friction_: Similar to how he's presented in canon, Todd can identify people by smell. With this ability, he is able to pin scents on the Mobile Unit agents based on their hygiene habits — bubblegum for Opal (as she wears bubblegum-scented perfume), powder for Oswald (since he powders himself), handmade soap for Orla (which she makes herself), and Axe body spray for Omar.
-   In _Toonatopia: The Animation Initiation_, Clam manages to figure out Gordon, Mr. Blik and Waffle are Nicktoons just by smelling them.

When Eightball later gets close to her in his blood-splattered shirt, she can barely restrain herself.
-   _Bones and All:_ Eaters are born with an innate compulsion to eat human flesh and aee aided by a superhuman sense of smell, though it needs to be trained.

A little encouragement from Sully helps the young Eater Maren to improve her ability.
-   The Childcatcher of _Chitty Chitty Bang Bang_, whose powerful (and rather large) nose lets him enforce the Child Hater regime of Vulgaria.

It's portrayed as less of a superpower and more of an ability which can fail him — when he tries tracking he gets nowhere since his sense of smell was blunted by too much exposure to strong smells.
-   Sergeant Angua of Terry Pratchett's _Discworld_ has this even in human form, which proves to be very helpful in several cases, notably the investigation in the dwarf mines during _Thud!_

    -   They can't detect the One Ring by scent, but according to Aragorn they do have a keen sense of smell.
    
    **Aragorn:** And at all times they smell the blood of living things, desiring and hating it.
    
    -   Played straight with Gollum in _The Hobbit_, however, given that he lived in a cave most of his life; when Bilbo escaped from him, he nearly realized he was there due to his keen hearing and sense of smell, _despite_ Bilbo being invisible. The savage wargs had this too; the narration specifically said that they didn't have to _see_ Bilbo to find him. The dragon Smaug could also detect Bilbo by scent when he turned invisible.
-   In _The Lunar Chronicles,_ the hybrid wolf soldiers, unsurprisingly, have this.

-   In E.W. Hildick's _The McGurk Organization_ juvenile mystery series, Willy the Nose is one of the kid detectives, with a super-sensitive sense of smell that his leader puts great store by. The narrator is a little dubious about this, but it does seem to come in handy more times than not.

He can track undeads as zombies, but also humans as Caroline Cooke.

Some of the characters are noted to have a particularly strong sense of smell, but special mention goes to Dovewing, who has Super-Senses and can smell cats across the lake.
-   This takes two different forms in _The Wheel of Time_ series. Wolfbrothers are characters with an unnatural affinity for wolves. Among several other abilities, their sense of smell is enhanced so much that they can tell the emotional state of people around them even without any visual cues. They can even detect such things as deception and madness, which is immensely handy. Perrin is one. In case you're wondering, such an ability is biologically impossible, but since this trait is believed to be caused by magic, that's all right. Also, there are "sniffers", a kind of people with an inborn ability to sense violence as a smell on people or places. Sniffers are rare and maybe even nonexistent south of the Borderlands, but still more common — or at least, more socially accepted — than Wolfbrothers.
-   In the _Women of the Otherworld_ series by Kelley Armstrong, a werewolf's sense of smell is incredibly strong to the point where werewolves find it necessary to use specifically _non_\-scented hygiene products if they want their sense of smell to work at full capacity. Elena, a female werewolf, can't even stand to use scented hand soap, as it severely interferes with her ability to smell anything else. She herself has the best nose of her Pack, and once she catches a scent, she'll be able to remember and hunt the person down by it even years later. It's shown in _Bitten_ that newly-bitten and inexperienced werewolves will likely still use scented products if they did so as a human, having not yet learned to rely on their nose just as much as their eyes and ears, which puts them at a distinct disadvantage against other werewolves.
    -   This is similarly shown in _Darkest Powers_, Armstrong's YA trilogy. Werewolves have enhanced senses in general, but those senses aren't very strong until they Change into wolf form for the first time (usually around eighteen). Derek, a sixteen-year-old werewolf, has an incredibly enhanced sense of smell even though he hasn't actually begun to Change into wolf form yet. In a small house that is _completely_ and consistently overlaid by the scents of about eight different people, he is still capable of pinning down the scent of the person he wants to find, determining the most recent trail despite her having just walked _all through the house_, and track her down into the basement and into a cellar where she was locked inside and physically incapable of doing _anything_ to make anyone aware of her location. Of course, considering she has no idea that he's anything other than human, this causes some awkwardness when he has to explain how he managed to find her.
-   In Andre Norton's _The Zero Stone_, the natives of Hungry Jungle hunt mostly by smell.

Angel takes a good whiff, and informs Wes that he had sex with a bottle blonde the night before.
        
        **Wesley:** Good Lord! How did you—  
        **Cordelia:** That's unbelievable. I didn't think you ever had sex.

Spike responds that he also used his "enhanced vampire eyeballs to watch you kissing him." Busted!

-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   Poked fun at when a character in "The Empty Child" wants to know how the Doctor managed to follow her. Note: this was when the Doctor was being played by Christopher Eccleston, who has a fairly prominent nose and ears.
        
        **The Doctor:** I'm good at following, me. Got the nose for it.  
        **Nancy:** People can't usually follow me if I don't want 'em to.  
        **The Doctor:** My nose has special powers.  
        **Nancy:** Really? Is that why it's so... Do your ears have special powers too?

-   Heightened sense of smell is a species-wide trait of Luxans on _Farscape_.

-   _M\*A\*S\*H_:
    -   When Hawkeye gives up drinking in one episode, he develops a very strong ability to smell to the point that he becomes utterly insufferable during chowtime. Oddly, Klinger, whose nose is so big the Army gave it its own serial number, never seems to use it for this purpose.

-   _Dungeons & Dragons_ has quite a few monsters that are known for an excellent sense of smell. Sometimes this is represented by a bonus on Perception checks to notice things by smell, in other rulesets there is a Scent special ability that allows creatures to detect things they couldn't see or hear.
    -   Dragons have exceptional senses of smell. In the 2nd Edition Forgotten Realms AD&D supplement _Cult of the Dragon_, a dragon said it could smell the fear of human beings.
    -   Grimlocks lacking eyes altogether and live in dark caves, and thus use their excellent senses of smell and hearing to hunt for prey.
    -   One often-overlooked tidbit is that gnomes have better senses of smell than other _Player Handbook_ races. It's not enough to let them detect enemies like the Scent ability, but a gnome alchemist can track the progress of a chemical reaction by the subtle odors it gives off. The kobolds have exploited this by devising the spell _gnome blight_, which conjures a cloud of arcane pollen to debilitate victims - targets with sensitive noses, like the kobolds' mortal foes, take a penalty on their saving throw against the spell.

Lampshaded by Hibiki, a professional assassin who can teleport at will, who admits in his win quote that he is impressed Taokaka managed to locate him purely by his scent.
-   In _Cereal Soup_, while playing as meerkat, canine or feline characters, players can use their nose to find and dig up treasure hidden throughout the world. But more interestingly, they can also use their nose to sniff other players and learn their "scent", which is a trait that's created in the Character Customization menu. Meaning, players can smell like whatever they want, ranging from pretty smells like lavender flowers to something nonsensical and unusual like "existential crisis".
-   _Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening_: Beowulf tracks down Dante because his scent is so similar to that of Sparda's. After being blinded, he retreats, only to follow the scent's trail again... leading him right to Vergil.

While fending her off, Altera, Mash, and the others figure out what Brynhild smelled was Siegfried, a being very similar to Sigurd since their legends are nearly identical. And the reason why Altera smells like Siegfried is because Altera had married Siegfried's wife Kriemhild after his death. Given these events happened centuries ago and these characters are Heroic Spirits and thus copies of the original, Brynhild's sense of smell is powerful indeed.

    -   Penthesilea can sniff out Achilles and anybody else with Greek blood.

-   _Helluva Boss_: Loona, being a hellhound, has an incredibly keen sense of smell. In "Spring Broken", it's demonstrated to be so powerful that to track down several targets to kill, all she has to do is sniff a _list of names_, and the targets appear glow red in her vision. However, it has its limitations; in "Seeing Stars", when Octavia goes missing in Los Angeles, Loona can't trace her scent over the city's strong stench.
-   _RWBY_: The Hound Grimm lacks eyes, but can smell good enough to track a specific person in a megapolis across miles of tundra. The lack of eyesight and overreliance on smell do prove disadvantageous, though, as the Hound repeatedly loses track of its last target, Penny, and goes after Ruby, Weiss and Whitley who all got Penny's Machine Blood on them after tending to her, and who are able to stall, injure and eventually kill the beast.
-   _Shrapnel_: The Commandah realizes he and Reznya are being spied on when he detects the scent of an enemy robloxian hiding nearby.

-   Umber from _Flipside_ is stated as having a sense of smell as keen as a dog's.
-   Florence of _Freefall_: (569) (1600) (1946). May be arbitrarily overridden by the Rule of Funny (or the French ninjas would never work (or maybe the French ninjas were just that good)).
    
    -   Or she was concentrating on the conversation and ignored her nose. Also, the fact that there were robots behind the screen meant that humans wouldn't have to be involved.
    
    **Niomi**: How good is that nose of yours?
    
    **Florence**: Ever hear about people trying to train dogs to detect the onset of epileptic seizures?
    
    **Niomi**: You can smell my **brain**?
    
    **Florence**: Well, it's not like you guys wash it regularly.

-   _Homestuck_: Terezi is completely blind, but can taste and smell color. To the point that she is entirely capable of using a computer simply by smelling or licking the screen. It also lets her figure out Karkat's real blood color, long before it was even revealed to the audience.

-   _Kill Six Billion Demons_: The primary sense for goblins is smell, not sight, leading to some friction when they try to interact with everyone else.

-   _The Order of the Stick_: Belkar can use his nose to not only immediately recognize Gender-Changed Roy, but to distinguish between Elan and Nale. (Granted, Nale wasn't exactly making it difficult, but it was only the scent that clued Belkar in). It's not foolproof, though, as he can't tell that he was smelling a room full of dead humans, because the desert air had turned them into natural mummies, meaning that they smelled different from rotting corpses. He could also smell Malack and the newly vampirized Durkon coming from through a closed door across a large room, thanks in part to both of them being full of his own blood.

-   In _Schlock Mercenary_, carbosilicate amorphs possess an unparalleled sense of smell-taste (to them, those two are the same) due to their every cell on their surface acting as a perceptor (the same principle also applies to their hearing) and them basically being living, thinking chemical nano-factories. The titular Sergeant Schlock, an amorph, has demostrated the ability to find a target in a crowd or overpopulated city, reconstruct a crime scene by scent alone, or tell that a person has recently had an eye surgery because they smell of surgical gel and corneas.
-   In _Slightly Damned_, Rhea actually says the name of this trope when she reveals that she can detect people by scent. She also correctly guesses that Buwaro may also have a good sense of smell due to him having a snout.
-   _Unsounded_: Sette's sense of smell borders on supernatural. She can track pretty much anything and can even smell magic. Unfortunately, magic smells like concentrated farts.
-   In _Widdershins_, the dog can smell a magical item.

    Web Original

-   Played for laughs in _Adventure Time_. Jake is a magic dog, but his strong sense of smell tends to be useless because of things like his short attention span, his inability to recognize scents he's never smelled before, and the similarities between certain smells. His nose even ruins a stakeout because he's not willing to hide with Finn in Ice King's dirty laundry basket, even though he likes the smell of a lot of gross things, including poop.
    
    **Jake:** Hey, there's a lot of interesting smells in poop.
    
-   Subversion: A few episodes of _The Alvin Show_ (predecessor to _Alvin and the Chipmunks_) feature "Sam Valiant, Private Nose". He thinks his enormous schnoz solves mysteries, but he's always way off.
-   The Aardvark from _The Ant and the Aardvark_ has a nose with his mouth at the end that he uses as a vacuum cleaner in trying to catch the Ant. He's never successful at it, and in one cartoon lampshades its dubious aesthetics:

-   June of _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ has Nyla, a star-nosed mole/wolf/giant anteater creature that she rides around on that can follow anyone's scent and can smell their location from hundreds of miles away. If Nyla can't find someone based on their smell, that means they're on a seperate plane of existence.

    **Nelson:** Your old man has an awesome nose.  
    **Bart:** That's nothing. He can _hear_ pudding.

-   Various characters in _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)_ have a heightened sense of smell. Two characters shown to use it frequently are Dogpound/Rhazar (a mutant dog) and Tigerclaw (a mutant tiger).

    **Bebop:** This nose is better than a bloodhound's.
    
-   _A Thousand and One... Americas_: Even for a dog, Lon has an exceptional sense of smell, as exemplified in the tenth episode when he can trace the distant whererabouts of a priest's missing son by smellling his stray clothes (the search begins in a sacred temple and ends in a cistern within Chavín de Huántar at the other end of the village). The previously-skeptical priest acknowledges the dog's skills, but has no time to congratulate him because the _place_ where the missing son turns out to be is a very dangerous one.

    Real Life 

-   Some sources about Native Americans claim that there had indeed been rare individuals amongst them who could smell as well or better as dogs.
    -   Humans in general, if they hone their sense of smell and live outside of the olfactory kaleidoscope of cities, can learn to track and identify individuals by smell alone.
    -   According to this Cracked article, you can detect fear, sexual arousal, and even whether someone is more dominant or submissive from smelling their sweat. Yeah. Wonder why that's not better known.
-   Women generally have better senses of smell than men, but during menstruation some women have a heightened sense of smell due to all the hormones flooding their system. (It's not as awesome when you consider smelling all the blood that's been seeping out of you for a week.) Pregnancy can also drastically increase one's sense of smell, and possibly hearing.
    -   Like morning sickness, this is possibly an adaptation to help expectant mothers avoid foods which could be toxic to a fetus.
    -   In fact, the phrase "a mother always knows" is more accurate than one may think. Tests have shown that a mother, if blindfolded, can correctly identify her own newborn child simply by scent far easier than the child's father can.
-   Autistic people tend to have more sensitive senses of smell, as part of the general "hypersensitivity" symptom.
-   Spraying a small amount of water vapor up one's nostrils is an effective way to heighten one's sense of smell, as it liquifies the mucus layer over the olfactory epithelium and allows odorants to penetrate more easily. This method is extensively used by wine-tasters, coffee-ground testers, people who check fish for freshness, etc.
-   Animals with keen senses of smell (commonly dogs, but sometimes others such as pigs or rats) are routinely trained for tracking and detection work. In fact, contrary to what you see in movies, someone who tries to wade through a stream to fool a bloodhound who's tracking him won't throw the animal off at all. Nor will spraying yourself with a strong-smelling substance fool a dog, as their brains are very efficient at picking out individual components of scents: it's said that a dog doesn't actually smell "pizza", it smells tomato sauce, cheese, crust, mushrooms, oregano, pepperoni, the cardboard delivery box...
    -   Although, if you can get right underwater for a bit there'd be nothing left to smell.
    -   Exploited Trope for dogs and pigs being used by humans to find truffles by smell. Also, for dogs trained to smell when a human is about to have an epileptic fit and make a gesture to warn them.
    -   The MythBusters have tested most of the techniques above — and several more — for throwing off bloodhounds and sniffer dogs. None of them were completely effective, and attempting to mask one scent with another was never proven effective. The only things that worked _at all_ to throw off the bloodhounds were inner-city tracking (due to the overwhelming kaleidoscope of scents distracting the bloodhound; additionally, this particular bloodhound was not trained for urban environments) and literal Red Herring (though that was as much due to Delicious Distraction as masking the scent).
-   People who work in emergency medicine develop this after a while and can tell by smell alone if a patient is having a G.I. bleed. Many also claim they can smell methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff), two highly infectious diseases that are unfortunately quite common in hospitals and other healthcare settings like nursing homes.
-   Dogs have been known to smell cancer in a human even without being specifically trained for it, and the hostile reaction one dog showed to an apparently innocuous spot on its owner's skin allowed her to get the tumour checked and dealt with before it became dangerous, as well as suggesting that the dog could not only identify the cancer but instinctively know it was harmful. The smell of cancer is so distinctive that it's been shown that dogs are able to smell blood samples from humans and identify cancerous ones, which is now being used as a way to improve cancer screening.
    -   While this remains a rare trait, cats have been known to do this too. It's theorized that these animals smell the decay of cells caused by cancer.
-   There are dubious reports that certain humans can smell cancer in other humans.
