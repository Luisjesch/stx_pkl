Please don't list this on a work's page as a trope.

Gotta get a load of that anime's Unlimited Booty Works.

_"_Catwoman _is a movie about Halle Berry's beauty, sex appeal, figure, eyes, lips and costume design. It gets those right. Everything else is secondary, except for the plot, which is tertiary."_

It could have had great humor, brilliant action sequences, diabolical villains or even philosophical ideas that could make you think. What everyone remembers, however, is the female lead's striptease in the Sweeps one year. Or, in an even more extreme case, a penis when it pops up on-screen. This trope refers to the actions of characters rather than characterization.

This is the common tendency for fanservice to overshadow everything else about a work, regardless of the amount that actually occurs in it (sometimes the most remembered bit of fanservice actually comes from promotional materials, which don't accurately depict what actually happens in the show). This can be so powerful and effective in Hollywood that the Hollywood Hype Machine will go into overdrive and make an actress who bared all (or most) of herself an instant, overnight household name. Don't laugh—Shannon Elizabeth and Denise Richards got _years_ of movie roles because of this trope thanks to _American Pie_ and _Wild Things_ respectively. At times this effect can become self-perpetuating: the mainstream audience first discovers a work due to its fanservice, and when word starts to spread about it, the fanservice is what newcomers hear about first as well. Ultimately, large portions of the public may end up knowing nothing else about the work.

Of course, one person's fanservice is another's Fetish Retardant. This is particularly prominent ("for some reason") any time there's a dude on full display in a work with any meaningful proportion of straight men in the audience. But hey, remembered positively or negatively, it's all the same in the end—hype is hype. Such inversions go below all the same.

For the more romantic equivalent, see Most Fanfic Writers Are Girls. When viewers watch a show specifically for fanservice, they're Just Here for Godzilla. See also Fanservice Extra and Dancing Bear. One-Scene Wonder is a similar phenomenon, but mostly unrelated. If the fanservice is controversial, the work may be Overshadowed by Controversy. Can result in Audience-Alienating Premise if it's more than just one or a few scenes. See also Signature Scene, which is often this. A subtrope of Never Live It Down.

Jiggle Shows rely on this trope for their success since they heavily rely on Fanservice.

Crosses over into Truth in Television, as there are many, many films, TV series and literary works that are known primarily for sex scenes or other suggestiveness and not for their plot, acting, etc. And this often extends to the actors and writers, not all of whom are pleased to be associated forever with a particular scene. Some admittedly don't care or take an I did it for the art approach (these folks are more likely to vehemently defend the decision in interviews even years later); others express regret and treat it as an Old Shame (see also Never Live It Down), especially if their career has evolved in the direction of more prestigious or family-friendly productions or if they have found themselves typecast into a certain type of role as a result. The tendency of the media and Internet communities to fixate on fanservice aspects of a production have led a number of text books and manuals for aspiring screenwriters and filmmakers to outright recommend _against_ overdoing sexual content in order to avoid this trope from coming into effect. (Hint: if the most prominent media coverage you see for a TV series or film is devoted to its sexual content, then you've come across an example of this trope.)

For when the "fanservice" is a scene where the audience gets their (safe for work) wish, see Just Here for Godzilla.

    Advertising 

-   The German materials wholesale chain Hornbach once had a TV commercial that tried to sell wooden ceiling panels with a couple having hot sex in a bed. The German comedian Michael Mittermeier pointed out the flaw of this concept: Nobody remembers the name of the company because nobody has ever been interested in their logo once it pops up, interrupting the sex scene.
    
    "Fuck that company, I wanna see those two shaggers again!"
    
-   The T-Mobile cellphone company had a series of ads in the late 1990s/early 2000s featuring well-known-for-hotness actress Catherine Zeta-Jones. Surveys showed viewers remembered the ads quite well, but typically couldn't recall the nature of the product, let alone which company she was shilling. Notable is the fact that Zeta-Jones wasn't naked or being seductive - just a famous and pretty woman talking about...something.
-   Commercials for Fiat automobiles have become notorious for this, with absurd pinup situations like "a scorpion snips off a girl's bikini top with its claw" or "several impossibly gorgeous women do their laundry in a village in colonial America - right after taking it off their own bodies."
-   _GoDaddy_, the web hosting company, is mostly known for running ads featuring female NASCAR driver Danica Patrick, playing up her sex appeal. Some don't even know what the company does! This trope crosses over to Danica herself arguably since much of her fame comes from her simply being an attractive female NASCAR driver.
-   The insurance company _Esurance_ is mostly well known for its series of animated ads in the mid-2000's that featured their mascot, Erin Esurance, an attractive pink-haired spy girl inspired by Sydney Bristow to appeal to the young male demographic. This lead to lots of lewd fanart of Erin, which was the reason why she was dropped in 2010 as their mascot before the company was acquired by Allstate and started promoting more family-friendly ads for the company.
-   The British commercials for Cadbury Caramel Chocolate (called Carmello in the United States) had the Cadbury Caramel Bunny, an attractive anthropomorphic bunny who starred in several animated commercials where she offers the aforementioned candy to other animals who find themselves enamored toward her. And apparently alot of humans found her attractive too, since a Scottish newspaper called Edinburgh Evening News voted her the 3rd sexiest cartoon character of all time. To put this in perspective, Betty Boop was placed second while Jessica Rabbit was voted in first place.
-   While _Super Mario All-Stars_ is a generally well-known Compilation Rerelease of the NES _Mario_ games, its Japanese commercial is similarly famous for featuring Princess Peach in a Jessica Rabbit-esque dress posing for the paparazzi.

    Arts 

-   Any famous nude statue or painting. If someone mentions Michelangelo Buonarroti's _David_, the first thing that comes to mind for many people is _not_ the fact that it portrays him before the battle with Goliath. The statue itself is supposed to be meaningful both in its grasp of human determination to fight oppression and in its portrayal of human anatomy, but all anybody remembers is "naked". _There are postcards of his genitals available in Florence's shops_, that's how much focus there is on it. His relative lack of... um... endowment is also often brought up, as well as the fact that he is not circumcised, as would have been the Jewish practice.
-   Sandro Botticelli's most famous painting is _The Birth of Venus_, which depicts the goddess Venus emerging from a clamshell fully naked, with hands half-heartedly covering things.
-   Édouard Manet's most famous paintings are _The Luncheon on the Grass_ and _Olympia_. Both caused scandals for their risque content. At the time, nudity in art was only acceptable when it came to fantasy creatures like nymphs, angels, mermaids, fairies, etc. The former showed an everyday woman sitting in public, completely naked alongside two (clothed) gentlemen. The latter featured what was either a prostitute or a mistress lying naked on her bed.
-   _DeviantArt_ is well known on other websites for a large collection of fetish art, but the vast majority of the artwork on there is not sexual at all, and the majority of its users do not draw erotic art at all. The website is intended to be a catch-all for everything art and thus has both hobbyists and professionals and any subject matter, so its bad reputation is not really justified.

    Comic Books 

-   Many readers know the _Archie Comics_ only for the beautiful girls drawn by Dan DeCarlo, especially Betty and Veronica. There is a reason why they appear so often in bikinis and other skimpy outfits...
-   _Batman: Damned_ is best known for showing an outline of Bruce Wayne's penis. This is all anyone talks about when it comes to the comic and is the reason that it's so hard to find and goes for such high prices. This also notably extends to the entire imprint it is a part of, Black Label, as it was the first original work to come out of the mature imprint and the proceeding uproar, ironically, led to _everything_ coming out of the imprint being scrutinized much more heavily by editors.
-   _Battle Chasers_ is remembered for three things, and two of them were on Red Monika's chest. (The other, even more unfortunately, was the book's chronic lateness.)
-   Carol Danvers' long-time black uniform (which she had to discard when she went from Ms. Marvel to Captain Marvel) is one of the most beloved fanservice costumes out there.
-   Long before she briefly married Captain Atom, Plastique made her debut in _Firestorm_ issue 7 as a Quebec separatist terrorist with an explosive-laden catsuit. Most memorably, of course, was the way Firestorm defeated her by disintegrating her costume, carrying off her bombs to detonate safely, and undermining her attempted martyrdom and political statement by leaving the hapless villainess standing naked in front of live TV cameras while having a Naked Freak-Out and desperately trying to cover herself.
-   _Gen¹³_:
    -   Everyone remembers Cat Fairchild for her muscular figure, super legs and tendency to get her clothes destroyed much to chagrim. One bootleg story is remembered for her being knocked out by the villain who undresses her and put's her into a Go-Go Enslavement outfit she wears for the rest of the story.
    -   Sarah Rainmaker is remembered for her Shameless Fanservice Girl antics, with issue #1 having a scene with her Skinny Dipping and doing a Sexy Surfacing Shot right in front of the boys, covered only by Scenery Censor. She also known for often struts around the house in the buff or in her underwear and for being into girls.
-   In-Universe, Jade lampshaded this in _Green Lantern_ when she laments that _everyone_ saw her spread in _Bikini Magazine_. (Of course, it's kinda hard to forget a green-skinned babe in a bikini, but that's beside the point.)
-   _Hack/Slash_ by Tim Seeley was very aware of how much Raven Hair, Ivory Skin Goth Girl Cassie Hack was fetish fuel for its fans. At least one arc was designed around a fanservice filled bathing beauties cult and another with a crossover using the Suicide Girls. Tim has also done many pin-ups built around his creation including calendars as well as coloring books.
-   Lady Death is best known to casual comic book readers for being a pale Statuesque Stunner in leather fetish gear. Of course, the comic itself uses this as a selling point.
-   _Spider-Man_: Mary Jane Watson and Felicia Hardy/Black Cat both provide Fanservice in the majority of their appearances in the franchise. This is due to their professions as a fashion model/actress and Felicia's choice of clothing as well as being a sexy cat thief and a seductress, it's not surprising.
    -   Gwen Stacy is also notable, as the only reason that the Mexican Spider-Man comics from the 1970s are discussed by English speakers is due to the size of her posterior in those comics.
-   _Novas Aventuras De Megaman_ had rampant nakedness. However, that only started with issue 12 of 16. The comic is now mostly known for this.
-   What does everyone remember about Power Girl? Is it her Kryptonian heritage? No? The fact that she's a refugee from a destroyed parallel universe? The fact that she can go toe-to-toe with Superman on a good day? How about her role in _Crisis on Infinite Earths_, where she was one of the few natives of Earth 2 to survive the Anti-Monitor's attack? No, no, and no. She's best known for her large breasts, and the Cleavage Window in her costume that shows them off. To this day, seemingly no comic book fansite can bring her up without mentioning her chest. In fact, a time when artists tried to downplay her fanservicey features is considered a Dork Age at best by most fans.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   _Purgatori_ is a comic that survived a great deal on Girl on Girl Is Hot, Hot as Hell, and its beautiful Most Common Superpower Villain Protagonist as much as the fact she was a character with a surprisingly deep backstory as well as unique personality.
-   _Secret Six_:
    -   What does everyone remember about Nightwing's appearance in the series? That there is a blatant shot of his ass in his _very_ tight uniform. The artist even wrote "Hot" when she signed it!
    -   Similarly, people who aren't familiar with pre-Secret Six Catman mostly know him because of an extended flashback sequence where he's living among lions in the wild without a stitch of clothing on. And once he gets back to civilization he will usually only put on a token pair of pants when not on the job.
-   _Valkyries_, a _2000 AD_ strip was this in spades. In fact, fans complained that it was nothing but Fanservice. _Droid Life_ parodied this with _Valkyries: From The Neck Up_.
-   All know Vampirella for her iconic Stripperiffic red sling suit and that she's a vampire, but very few know anything about the setting or her backstory. (Or how selfsame costume stays put - a frequent cosplay problem...)
-   _The Sensational She-Hulk_ series helped cement She-Hulk as one of Marvel's most notorious Ms. Fanservice characters by featuring her in several instances of undress. As a result, quite a number of people remember it for its fanservice just as much, if moreso, as they do its humor. Special mention goes to her jumping rope in a swimsuit in the first pages of issue #40 and her nipples being partially exposed in<small>◊</small> _Marvel Graphic Novel Issue #18: She-Hulk_.
-   _Wonder Woman_:
    -   Wonder Woman's outfit in general, particularly when the coulottes were removed, making her outfit effectively a one-piece swimsuit. Taken further during a period when the bottom of the outfit was given a French cut, making it into a butt-exposing (and partial crotch-exposing) thong. This is particularly notorious since readership went up during this time.
    -   For many fans, the BDSM-influenced scenes of women being tied up is what is most memorable about the original comics by William Marston.
    -   _Wonder Woman (1987)_: Mike Deodato's art during the William Messner-Loebs run was infamous for featuring female characters in frequently sexualized poses and Stripperiffic costumes. Diana's "biker chick" outfit is emblematic of what the art during that period of the comic was like.
    -   _Wonder Woman (2011)_ became famous for showing Diana while she Sleeps in the Nude, with only a Modesty Bedsheet preserving her modesty. A sheet she later discards when she awakens, giving a shot of her Toplessness from the Back.
-   _X-Men_:
    -   Psylocke. Remember those years she spent as the team's primary telepath? How about those two times she took on Sabretooth with nothing but her psychic powers? Nothing? Okay, how about when she got turned into a scantily-clad Asian babe and spent years doing nothing but pose in a leotard?
    -   Rogue is a overlapping example with the _X-Men: The Animated Series_ as the general populace knows her best for flying around in Sensual Spandex (especially one particularly famous moment in said cartoon where she’s lying on the ground in front of Apocalypse butt to camera). That time she wore a Fur Bikini in Savage Land is talked more about than her character development.
    -   Storm going around in Stripperiffic attire and outright Godiva Hair is what often she’s best known in comics alongside her Weather Manipulation.
    -   Emma Frost and her preference for as-skimpy-as-can-be costumes without getting herself arrested.
    -   _Astonishing X-Men_ is generally remembered for the bit where Kitty Pryde falls naked out of the ceiling while having sex with Colossus upstairs.

    Films — Animation 

-   _The Chipmunk Adventure_. The movie is often remembered for the Chipettes. More specifically for their several Panty Shot scenes and when Brittany and Jeanette, in Belly Dancer outfits, have to get past a swarm of snakes charming them singing a song named "Getting Lucky".
-   _DC Showcase: Catwoman_ is most likely remembered for when Catwoman is a stripper.
-   _El Arca_ is mostly remembered for the bottom-heavy lioness Kairel and, to a greater extent, the top-heavy pantheress Panty. Not to mention Panthy's dance scene. Wasn't it also based on Noah's Ark?
-   _Fire and Ice (1983)_: Princess Tigra. She wore absolutely nothing but a _skimpy bikini_ throughout the entire film. 'Nuff said.
-   Disney's _The Great Mouse Detective_ is often remembered for the Big-Lipped Alligator Moment in the Bad Guy Bar with the lady mouse singer who then fling off her modest dress and cape to reveal a blue leotard<small>◊</small> with a feather showgirl skirt.
-   _The Haunted World of El Superbeasto_ is known for topless scenes featuring Suzi-X and Velvet Von Black.
-   _The Hunchback of Notre Dame_ is remembered for a scene where Esmeralda does a makeshift pole dance while performing at the Feast of Fools. It's quite brief but it's surely a memorable part of the film.
-   Gloria from _Madagascar_ is best known as the hippo with the big butt<sup>*&nbsp;</sup> , which she is often swinging around.
-   _Marcianos vs. Mexicanos_ is an obscure Mexican adult animated film centered around a family being chosen to go to Mars and stop a potential martian invasion. Panned by critics and was a Box Office Bomb, the only thing people seem to know about the film is the character La Zafiro.
-   If Disney fans remember the animated short film "Pecos Bill" at all, it's often as _"The one with the gorgeous redheaded cowgirl with the big butt"_. It probably doesn't help that it was in the relatively obscure 1948 anthology film _Melody Time_, which is otherwise considered to be one of Disney's more forgettable early films.
-   While _The Rescuers_ is a beloved Disney movie, if it's brought up then people are guaranteed to mention that the original print had two frames where a picture of a topless woman was snuck in during the post-production process. Newer versions have edited this out.
-   _Regue Chicken_ is a poorly received film, but the main character, Violeta is known for her attractive appearance.
-   _The Road to El Dorado_: Chel's tube top and form-fitting skirt were quite risqué for an early 2000s animated film. She is fondly remembered for this reason.
-   Most people talk about _The Suicide Shop_ because of the scene where Marilyn Tuvache dances in the nude while her younger brother Alain and his friends watch outside her window.
-   The DC animated movie _Batman and Harley Quinn_ tends to be remembered most for the scene in which Harley Quinn ties Nightwing to a bed, strips down to her underwear, and seduces him. However, that scene in particular is also remembered for some controversial implications.
-   _Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay_ is quite well-known for the scene where Knockout emerges from a bath with her breasts (nipples and all) in full view.
-   The Danish animated film _Sunshine Barry & the Disco Worms_ is rather obscure, and most people who know about it know it as "that movie with the earthworms with big boobs".

    Literature 

-   For a lot of non-fans, the first thing that comes to mind when the _A Court of Thorns and Roses_ books are mentioned is "faerie porn". While the books _do_ have a lot of explicit sex scenes involving faeries, there is actually more to the plot, although the sexy stuff is also a draw for some readers.
-   Discussed in _Dave Barry Slept Here_, where Annette Funicello is cited as the cultural contributions made by _The Mickey Mouse Club_:
    
    Annette had a _major_ impact on many us male Baby Boomers, especially the part where she came marching out wearing a T-shirt with her name printed on it, and some of the letters were considerably closer to the camera than others. If you get our drift.
    
-   Terry Pratchett's _Discworld_ novels tend to avoid or skirt over sex or erotica. However, _Thud!_ has a scene which smacks of genuine contrivance, maybe as a Take That! to fanfic writers who insist on pairing off the most unlikely characters in contrived scenes where they inevitably get off with each other. Sally and Angua end up knee-deep in mud, naked, and squaring off for what could either end up as a Cat Fight or something else; Sally subverts either result with a joke about how people might so much want to see this that they'd pay good money for it. In-universe it's occasionally noted that most men come to the Ankh-Morpork Royal Art Museum only to see the painting _Three Large Pink Women and One Piece of Gauze_ and nothing else. The women come to see the statue _Man With Large Fig Leaf_.
-   Jean Auel's _Earth's Children_ series is a massive exploration of early human civilization, culture clash, survival, and romance. There's also a lot of explicit sex. To its detractors, it's just Ayla and "Dongalar" screwing their way across prehistoric Europe. The unabashed and often explicit sexual content has also resulted in the books being banned in a few places over the years. Some readers who only knew the books from this are surprised to find that while there _is_ abundant sexual content, there's also a great deal more to the story. A few readers can especially get a nasty surprise if they read the first book expecting erotica, only to discover the only prominent sexual content in this one is a harrowing rape scene.
-   _Flowers in the Attic_ by V. C. Andrews is, to hear both its fans and critics tell it, a story all about a really romantic or incredibly creepy sex scene involving underage Brother–Sister Incest; a rather awkward one that lasts for all of about half a page in a 400+ page paperback. It's a _horror novel_, people.
-   _Guinness World Records_: Heather Holliday (see here), holder of the records for "longest neon tube swallowed" and "largest curve in a sword swallowed while seated", because of her extremely revealing performance outfit and the resemblance between sword-swallowing and fellatio.
-   _High School D×D_ is infamous for its gratuitous Fanservice (particularly in the anime adaptation) and a perverted hero who constantly talks about breasts. However, said hero is an Affectionate Parody of Shōnen\-style protagonists who is genuinely heroic and respectful towards women, and the characters and setting are surprisingly well-developed.
-   _Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere_ is a sprawling high fantasy world with the benefit of a veteran writer with several series under his belt, each sharing common themes and concepts throughout their shared universe. Every trope is examined, played with, and ultimately justified. The "Holy Shit!" Quotient is high, the soundtrack is orgasmic, and the world-building is matched only by the sheer amount of characterization. On the other hand, balloon tits.
-   _How NOT to Write a Novel_ offers three examples for the 'list of ingredients' method of descriptions gone wrong: the living room, the zoo, and the porn studio. Which one does everyone remember? The porn studio.
-   Stephen King's _It_ has an infamous sequence where Beverly has sex with each of the other boys. It Makes Sense in Context but because they're only about twelve, it gets a lot of press. For obvious reasons, the TV miniseries and film left it out. Unfortunately, Beverly's inner monologue during this scene comes the closest to explaining just what Pennywise/It is, so that explanation is missing from all adaptations.
-   Vatsayana's _Kama Sutra_ is an important Hindu philosophical text that includes detailed discussions about the spiritual components of pleasure and beauty, the challenges of balancing pleasurable living with virtuous behavior, and the elements of healthy human relationships. It also includes several rather graphic discussions of sex. Guess which part most Westerners are aware of? <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   D.H. Lawrence is widely known for _Lady Chatterley's Lover_, and that book is remembered for one specific scene. It could even be argued that the _entire book_ is this trope; it's hardly the author's best work, but it's still the most recognized Lawrence title. Why? The entire book is about sex. In the UK, it's arguably for the fact that it being about sex resulted in an obscenity trial. The jury found the experience to be rather stimulating.
-   _The Pet Girl of Sakurasou_ is almost entirely character drama, Tear Jerker moments, and realistic struggles with life and romance. But most non-fans are only aware of the heavily advertised couple of scenes where a spaced-out girl gets naked. And the title makes the whole thing look like a Harem Series.
-   The Song of Songs is often known as "that part of The Bible that gets borderline pornographic at times". However it's rather tame by modern standards and has plenty more content.
-   _The Satyricon_ is one of the first novels ever written. It's a funny story, has clever, biting satire of tasteless artists and tacky _nouveau-riche_ folk, as well as being a primary source for how 1st Century AD Romans lived and a record of lost poems and memes of the day through their parodies in the work. However, if you have read it (or heard of it) and you're not a historian, it was probably for the near-constant, incredibly depraved sex in the book.
-   Ever since _Game of Thrones_ became known as "that show that's like _The Lord of the Rings_ but with Porn and Politics" (which it isn't), _A Song of Ice and Fire_ has become known as an "Adult" "Grim Dark" or "X-rated" fantasy series. It does contain sex scenes, but most of them are PG-13 at worst, and many of them are implied rather than shown. However, judging how some people talk about them, you'd think it's all skin, all humping, all the time. The TV series (which likewise isn't as sexual as people make it out to be) is, for the most part, more explicit.
-   When the female lead of _Spice and Wolf_ first appears, she is stark naked. She's not human, but that can lead people to the wrong conclusions easily enough, and seeing her illustrations (or images from the anime or manga adaptations) without context can lead one to assume that she goes around naked frequently, when in fact she prefers to wear clothes in her human form because she gets cold without her fur. Ironically, despite her reputation, she dresses much more conservatively than most anime women (usually a full-length dress and at least one layer with long sleeves, often with a hooded cape over it), largely to hide her tail and ears.
-   In the _Sword of Truth_, there are a few examples that stand out above all the others, though there's enough material that most of them don't even stand out.
    -   The "spirit house" becomes a Running Gag between Richard and Kahlan—and so do apples, to a lesser extent.
    -   Kahlan, leading a group of teenaged Galean soldiers against the Order, wearing only bodypaint.
    -   Nicci, riding out against an army with her dress pulled down so nobody would notice her face.
    -   Nicci, abusing the Maternity spell she cast on Kahlan.
    -   Denna. But we wish we could forget.
-   The only thing people know about _That's Me, Eddykins_ by Eduard Limonov is the scene where the protagonist bottoms to a black guy.
-   _We Can Remember It For You Wholesale_ has the blonde and buxom receptionist Shirley who works at Rekall while topless with bobbing breasts.

    Music 

-   Pretty much the entire point of Hair Metal was supposed to be this.
-   Early '80s UK pop group Bow Wow Wow mixed up punkish energy, surf music, and African-inspired beats and had a couple of hits, notably "I Want Candy", but they're still chiefly remembered for the UK cover of their first album _See Jungle! See Jungle! Go Join Your Gang Yeah, City All Over! Go Ape Crazy!_, which features the group recreating Edouard Manet's 1863 painting _Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe_. The original painting features two guys and a girl having a picnic in the forest, except that the guys are fully clothed and the girl is completely naked. On Bow Wow Wow's album cover, the band is having a picnic in the forest, and all the guys in the band are fully clothed except Burmese/English singer Annabella Lwin, who's as naked as the girl in the painting. What makes this arguably Fan Disservice is that she was _fourteen_ when the album came out.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   All anyone remembers about house music producer and DJ L'il Louis? That track with the woman having a "Lady Chatterley crisis" over it.
-   All anyone remembers about "The Lunacy of Duke Venomania" in the _Evillious Chronicles_ is the attractiveness of the \[\[{Pretty Boy titular character\]\] and how he magically brainwashes a harem full of woman he kidnapped into being his sex slaves. And sometimes the cameo from Josephine. In fact, it's quite possibly the best-known song in the series behind the beloved Daughter of Evil and Servant of Evil for this reason. You'll find few people who know the backstory or emotional themes behind the whole ordeal, even though they are hinted at in the song.
-   R&B group H-Town is mostly known for being that trio who danced like raunchy shirtless male strippers and sung "Knockin the Boots".

-   Before Momsen, the main thing punk-metal band The Plasmatics is remembered for is lead singer Wendy O Williams being the original inventor of the duct-tape pastie.
-   The Pretty Reckless has a pretty decent following for their music, but Taylor Momsen's risqué on-stage antics are arguably their biggest claim to fame. In the band's early days, one of Momsen's trademarks was that she frequently performed topless, using black electrical tape to cover her nipples.
-   MTV Brazil has stated that in their country before Dave Grohl recorded an album with Queens of the Stone Age, they were just the band of that guy who played naked during Rock in Rio.
-   Shakira's most famous lyric is surely the one about having "small and humble" breasts. Oh yeah, and her Hips Don't Lie either.
-   While Tiffany (last name Darwish) is still best known as one of the most popular mall singers of the 1980s (she's the redhead, the blonde was Debbie Gibson), she has been singing and recording albums ever since. She released an album in 2000 called "The Color of Silence", which was highly praised and considered one of the best pop albums of the year. However, it wasn't until she did a Contractual Purity\-shattering photoshoot for _Playboy_ that she got any mainstream attention to let people know the damn thing existed.
-   In This Moment is "that one metal band where the singer is a blonde Ms. Fanservice who dresses up constantly" for many people.
-   Melissa Donovan is noted for being one of the most attractive women in the Boston area. Helps that she resembles both Megan Fox and Jennifer Connelly.
-   Irish hip hop performer Dubal C got a lot of traction in 2020 for the fact that he frequently freestyles while shirtless. One of his tracks lampshades this - "they think I'm a sham because I haven't got a top on".
-   "Automatic" by the Brothers Conti is known entirely for being the song that features in _House of Wax (2005)_ as Paris Hilton does a striptease.
-   In their early years, The Dandy Warhols gained notoriety from keyboardist Zia McCabe often performing topless.
-   Taylor Swift's "Vigilante Shit," from her tenth album _Midnights_ is about an Anti-Hero narrator systemically destroying the life of a scumbag, helping his wife divorce him and take all his money while he rots in jail for his crimes. What people _remember_ about it, however, is the fact that on _The Eras Tour_, Taylor gave a _lapdance_ as choreography, while wearing a short, sparkly dress and a matching garter.

    Music Videos 

-   Atomic Kitten:
    -   "If You Come to Me" is remembered for the music video showing the girls nude with animations of clouds and butterflies on their body. As they were quite modest for a Girl Group, this is one of their only blatant Fanservice videos.
    -   The other close remembered video is "It's OK", a Beach Episode which opens with the Kittens doing a Sexy Surfacing Shot.
-   Benny Benassi's videos. "Satisfaction", for example, was a mocked-up commercial video of women in bikinis using power tools.
-   Christina Millian had quite a few music videos early in her career. But the only video people seem to remember is "Dip It Low".
-   The Dandy Warhols gained a lot of notoriety for keyboardist Zia McCabe playing topless at times. She gave up when a large number of guys started showing up to gigs just for that and acting like assholes. And their most famous song? "Bohemian Like You," due to the video with a few seconds each of full-frontal nudity from a Wrench Wench and a waiter.
-   David Lee Roth once did a cover of The Beach Boys classic "California Girls". The only reason anybody still remembers Roth's version is because the music video featured more girls in bikinis than Cancun during Spring Break.
-   "Call on Me" by Eric Prydz is a rather bland, repetitive song that would have been tossed into the pile of forgotten early-2000's techno... were it not for some genius deciding that the video should consist of women in thong-cut leotards humping the floor... er, doing aerobics.
-   Inverted in Lady Gaga's "Telephone". The video is so full of fanservice and Fetish Fuel that it's Best Known for the Sandwich. For poorly explained reasons, Gaga and Beyonce go into a roadside cafe, make poisoned sandwiches that kill everyone, and seem pretty pleased with their work.
-   Lit: While the band did have a #1 song for a record-breaking 12 weeks, what most people remember about them is "Miserable", where they are Eaten Alive by a giant, bikini-and-high-heel-clad Pamela Anderson after she gets tired of them climbing all over her.
-   "Wrecking Ball"? Oh, you mean the music video where Miley Cyrus rides a styrofoam wrecking ball like a tire swing naked? You might also remember her licking the sledgehammer. Or the vaguely horrifying parody by Ron Jeremy. Good luck Brain Bleach\-ing that one away.
-   Not quite fanservice, but the video clip for Latin band Miranda's song "Ritmo & Decepción" is only remembered by some due to the brief Restart cameo.
-   Rapper Petey Pablo has a video called "Freek-A-Leek". But the only thing people remember from it is the model Esther Baxter a.k.a. "Ms. Freek-A-Leek".

-   Nine Inch Nails? They're the "fuck you like an animal" guys, right? And the guys who made that video where that one guy got naked and then gets tortured by a machine?
-   The music video of "First It Giveth" by Queens of the Stone Age famously features then-bassist Nick Oliveri parading completely naked on-stage during snippets of the video showing them playing at Glastonbury and on the US Tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Of course, it is mostly seen as Fan Disservice to most viewers while simultaneously regarded as hilarious.
-   Some of the more positive YouTube/Failblog comments regarding the music video for "Dying Naked" by Skelteria were about the Reaper Girl.
-   Everybody remembers the music video for "Here I Go Again" by Whitesnake because it features 1980s hottie Tawny Kitaen writhing around sensuously on the hood of a car. The video became even _more_ famous when viewers discovered that there's a nipple slip that the censors missed (the video was quickly edited to remove the split-second of nudity). This has unfortunately fed the prejudice that Whitesnake's music is automatically stupid, even though they stand as one of the most ambitious and sophisticated pop-metal bands in the history of the genre.

    Pinballs 

-   Stern Electronics' _Viper_, the game that everyone remembers for the naked chrome Fembot on the backglass.

    Podcasts 

-   _Kakos Industries_ is a show placed in an interesting alternate, and much sexier, setting of the real world where being Evil is the norm of society. The characters are interesting, the music is catchy, and the writing is full of humor and fast wit... But who cares when the main narrator's voice sounds like smooth, delicious honey glazing over your virgin ear canals.

    Print Media 

-   _The Daily Sport_ is a discontinued British magazine that is now rather infamous for counting down the days until a model could pose topless on her sixteenth birthday.
-   _Playboy_ was once credible enough to interview people like Jimmy Carter and Martin Luther King Jr. But the pictures of naked women were what it was best known for, thus spawning an entire trope.
-   One of _The Sun_'s most famous (and infamous) features is its 'Page 3' girls - models who pose fully nude. Plenty of these models go on to become celebrities in their own right because of this.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   It's usually the raison d'etre of most attractive female wrestlers to avoid this trope in the modern era, especially since, during the late 90s and Turn of the Millennium, a large portion of women hired by WWE were models with no wrestling background, and failed to make any lasting impact other than being attractive. Trish Stratus turned down offers to pose for Playboy, knowing that would be the only thing she'd be remembered for. Lita likewise turned down the magazine due to a combination of this and the fact that she was known as an icon for young girls of the time, with many of the new generation of women wrestlers citing her and/or Trish as their idols. Cameron likewise decided against getting breast implants for this reason.
-   Outside of Japan, Mr. Gannosuke is best known for two things. One is his Signature Move, the Gannosuke Clutch. The other is taking part in a pornographic video while wearing Hayabusa's mask in order to give legitimacy to an FMW angle their feud was just a small part of.
-   Stacy Keibler, who voluntarily turned down a title run for admitted lack of wrestling skills and is best known for her 42" legs.
-   Torrie Wilson. She never held a title though she would have been the inaugural Diva's Champion had she not retired or did anything too important in the ring other than walking around in belly shirts and thong bikinis, something that she seems to regret. Her most memorable storyline is the one with Dawn Marie - that involved a gratuitous kissing scene (that most of the roster crowded around to watch).
-   While Brian Kendrick would eventually out live it, thanks largely to his Tag Team with Paul London, until they teamed up it was hard to talk about anything else Kendrick had ever done without mentioning that time he went streaking on live television. Not even Josh Matthews could resist while interviewing him.
-   Remember when Joey Ryan was a serious wrestler? No, not even his run as Pro Wrestling Guerilla Champion? Fine, remember when Joey Ryan dressed up as a rooster? Uh, what about when Ryan slurped on a sucker and then wrapped it in his chest/pubic hair? Of course you do!
-   Melina plays with this. She debuted as a Ms. Fanservice valet to MNM and many fans assumed she was yet another Diva Search girl - not realizing she'd actually trained to wrestle on the indies. She eventually broke out on her own and became a 3-time Women's Champion - and is beloved for her wrestling by many fans. But the one thing everyone remembers about her is that she does the splits on the ring apron for her entrance, _especially_ the ones she did early on as a valet, as she did those while wearling a skirt, resulting in giving the audience a look up her skirt (she wore long pants as a wrestler).
-   It's often forgotten that Maryse is actually a two-time Divas' Champion, and was, in fact, the longest reigning champ before A.J. Lee surpassed it (she was later surpassed by Nikki Bella). Maryse's most memorable traits are the hair flip, sexy ring attire and suggestive pin attempts.
-   Ashley Massaro either is remembered for her terrible wrestling (as WWE never trained her properly) or for her Playboy cover - specifically the segment where she unveiled it, removing her top to show Playboy bunnies over her nipples.
-   "Queen" Sharmell Sullivan is an especially notable subversion in that she neither wrestled _nor_ served up any fanservice (apart from her stint as a Nitro Girl in WCW), but simply worked as a valet for her husband Booker T, got menaced by the male heels and screamed a lot. This was because she was injured early in her career. The infamous match with Jenna Morasca, who had a slutty Stripperiffic attire and was one of, if not, the worst celebrities ever to try their hand in wrestling did not help matters with Sharmell.
-   Kelly Kelly was still remembered for her initial 'Kelly's Expose' gimmick where she did a striptease on ECW. The gimmick didn't last that long and Kelly spent far more time as a Damsel in Distress than Ms. Fanservice. She was portrayed as more of a Girl Next Door from the PG switch onwards, but the stripteasing is what she was remembered for.
-   Brooke Adams is not particularly bad in the ring, but most people only like her because she's hot and has a fantastic ass. She seems to be well aware of this and incorporates her ass into many of her moves in the ring.
-   Fully Loaded 1998 is the PPV that has the infamous bikini contest between Jacqueline and Sable where Sable revealed her bare chest with hand print pasties on. It's one of the most remembered moments of the Attitude Era, and one of the most memorable of Sable's career. Sable is remembered mainly for the sexual moments in her career. In her time, when she actually got into the ring she rarely provided Fanservice and was presented as a legitimate wrestler (though she had limited training). The women's division was in fact resurrected to give Sable a role in the company beyond being a valet or ring girl. Even in her 2003 return — when the division had actual wrestling — they ignored that Sable was a former Women's Champion and presented her as a seductress who would have the occasional Cat Fight (ironically getting far more physical in the ring than her previous run).
-   Armageddon 1999 is remembered for two things: the first is Stephanie McMahon turning heel to become a power couple with Triple H. The second is Miss Kitty dropping her top after winning the Women's Championship - the first time there had ever been full intentional nudity on the company's national TV.
-   This was invoked back when TNA was an NWA Member and Gail Kim posed nude for a cell phone company sometime around _NWA Korea Attack_, it didn't help that during said event Kim had a chance to wrestle _Mayumi Ozaki_ but the booker opted to spare Kim a gruesome loss, given this was before her Star-Making Role. Then Kim beat Sirelda, underwent a Heel–Face Turn that saw her feud with Jacqueline and _then_ came Kim's star making role, feuding with Amazing/Awesome Kong over the newly created TNA Knockouts Title belt. Kim's "most beautiful woman in pro wrestling" gimmick was all but forgotten in favor of "Highest iMPACT ratings! Now they're wrestling in the show's main event!"
-   The Beautiful People in TNA were primarily remembered for their Les Yay ring entrance - by shaking their asses as they entered the ring and eventually teasing a kiss. Angelina Love, Madison Rayne, and Velvet Sky are all multiple time Knockouts Champions, but the entrance is usually the first thing that comes to mind.
-   Despite Candice Michelle being the only female to be named "Most Improved Wrestler of the Year" by Pro Wrestling Illustrated, her wrestling career ended shortly after several injuries derailed her momentum, so most fans tend to overlook her in-ring work and focus solely on her more fanservice-y moments. The fact that she was also a softcore porn actress, Playboy model, and the former Go Daddy girl doesn't help.
-   While Mickie James is known for far more than fanservice <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and her feud with Trish Stratus was enjoyed and respected by fans, it was filled to the brim with Les Yay moments. Expect fans to always mention either the crotch lick<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  from their match at WrestleMania 22 or the famous kiss under the mistletoe.
-   Terri Runnels wasn't much of a wrestler and served primarily as a manager/valet who walked around in tiny bikinis and shirts that exposed her Underboobs. However, she turned down _Playboy_ because she didn't want to embarrass her daughter.
-   Similar to her contemporaries Sable and Terri mentioned beforehand, the first thing that comes to mind when mentioning Debra Marshall are her sexy business suits that showcased how buxom she was, sometimes just dropping the subtlety altogether and appearing in a bikini covered with a blazer.
-   Madusa (or Alundra Blayze if you prefer) posed for _Playboy_ in her early career because she needed the money, but she refused to have the photos released in order to avoid being this trope. For a while, she suffered from a close cousin to this trope, Overshadowed by Controversy, when she dropped the WWF Women's Championship in the trash can on live TV in WCW.
-   SHIMMER had a performer called Rayna Von Tosh who only wrestled on four volumes, yet is still remembered to this day. Mainly because her gimmick was that of a burlesque pin-up girl who seductively peeled off her High-Class Gloves in her entrance.
-   Manager/Wrestler Jade Chung, as a former Miss Vietnam competitor/import model, is mainly remembered for her outfits (skimpy custom made Chinese dresses when managing, and a tight pink skirt/top combo when wrestling) and less so for her promo and wrestling ability. Jade has made a concentrated effort to improve on this in recent years, however.
-   Legacy never accomplished much while they were together, but they're remembered for the metric ton of Ho Yay in all their promos, and the fact that they never seemed to wear pants backstage. Randy Orton used to be best known for taking his shirt off at every opportunity but has since overcome this.
-   When it comes to Rusev and Lana, a lot of people tend to forget that Lana is quite a good talker and manager - because they're too busy drooling over the shorts skirts and Blonde Republican Sex Kitten image. This is especially ironic because, apart from the skirts and the fact that she used to tend to do a turn seemingly to show off her body at times, there was nothing particularly sexual about her character until she resurfaced on _WWE SmackDown_.
-   After the 2019 _Royal Rumble_, _The Sun_ newspaper was criticised by many fans for focusing on Becky Lynch having a minor Wardrobe Malfunction during her match - and no one saw anything due to WWE darkening the feed - rather than the quality of the wrestling.
-   Inverted for Asuka - who is so beloved for her wrestling (even getting a massive undefeated streak in her WWE run) - that many are shocked to find out that she used to portray a Ms. Fanservice in her early days in Japan.
-   For a while, Dolph Ziggler was known for either getting pushes started and stopped or else wrestling in tight silver trunks as a Mr. Fanservice.

    Sports 

-   Paraguay's representative at women's javelin throw during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Leryn Franco, is best known for her attractiveness, to the point that she actually became a small Internet phenomenon and not for any accomplishments at her particular sports event. It says something that after her personal bests started to decline, she announced her retirement in favor of full-time modeling work.
-   The Russian women's curling team at the 2014 Winter Olympics became best known for how most of its members participated in lingerie photoshoots days before the event, in particular Anna Sidorova, Alexandra Saitova, and Ekaterina Galkina, especially when their performance that year ended up not even allowing them to reach the medal table (made all the worst as that year the games were held in Sochi, Russia, meaning that they were the home team).
-   Beach volleyball. Pretty much _every single professional player_ of this sport is bound to be a source of Fanservice for the opposing sex. Well shaped and fit men and curvy and lithe women are the rule rather than the exception, bikinis and speedos are a must unless your religion prescribes chastity (like Islam) and the cameras on live broadcasts know to focus on _both_ forms of gaze.
    -   While the Olympics doesn't actually require women beach volleyvall players to wear the two piece bikini bottom and sports bra, it is generally the default uniform. Some countries DO require female players to wear that outfit in some sports: In 2021 the European Handball Federation fined the women's Norwegian Handball team for not wearing the outfit.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Magic: The Gathering_:
-   _Warhammer 40,000_:
    -   What most fans only seem to remember about the Sisters of Battle is that they're an Amazon Brigade in a _very_ male-dominated setting, and that one of their troop options literally wear nothing but three scraps of paper (and a Chainsaw Sword). They are hit by this particularly bad, since the Repentia (the aforementioned chainsaw-sword wielding girls dressed in paper scraps) have to do so because they committed a sin and thus forfeit their right to wielding Powered Armor and Bolters or Flamers. The other Battle Sisters positively dress in one of the most concealing examples of female armour of any fictional setting, more often than not with a helmet.
    -   The reputation of the Dark Eldar and Slaaneshi are Sense Freaks and Combat Sadomasochists who tend to be know for raping everything to death (which is ironic since they're arch enemies).

    Theater 

-   The 1866 Broadway musical _The Black Crook_ is cited as the first book musical. Upon release, it received a lot of criticism for its scantily-clad ballerinas. However, these same ballerinas were why everyone saw the play. To quote one retrospective:
    
    "_The New York Herald published an op-ed piece "condemning" the play for the indecency of the costumes and dancing, suggesting that there may have been "in Sodom and Gomorrah ... such a theatre and spectacle on the Broadway of those doomed cities," and urging those "determined to gaze on the indecent and dazzling brilliancy of the Black Crook" to "provide themselves with a piece of smoked glass."_"
    
-   _The Blue Room_ is that play where Nicole Kidman (or Sigrid Thornton, if you saw it in Australia) appears nude on stage.
-   Historically, the cancan dance, performed in places such as the Moulin Rouge and the Folies Bergère. The dance was considered a scandal of the time not because of their legs, but because of the open drawers that exposes their hoohas when they do their high kick.
-   _Equus_: That play where Harry Potter is naked. Prior to the 2007 revival with Daniel Radcliffe, shorthand was it had something to do with naked teenagers and a horse.
-   _Frankenstein_: That play where, depending on the night, Benedict Cumberbatch or Jonny Lee Miller would open the show naked.
-   _The Full Monty_: That other musical based on a film where some guys get naked. Which, to be fair, is what it is mostly about anyway...
-   The stage adaptation of _The Graduate_: Mrs. Robinson gets naked on stage (actresses in that role have included Anne Archer, Amanda Donahoe, and Linda Gray).
-   _Hair_: That musical where everyone gets naked. Oh, and some profound stuff about hippie counterculture and sexual revolution of the 1960s, and some rock music too, but mostly that scene. Even though the nudity is optional for that scene and some directors omit it. (Also _Oh! Calcutta!_.)
-   _Orpheus in the Underworld_ by Jacques Offenbach is best known for Act 2, Scene 2 where the lovely ladies in showgirl skirts dance the can-can across the stage. It helps that the tune they dance to not only is the best-known of the entire operetta and is also the one that for most people immediately springs to mind whenever they hear the word "can-can".
-   The Irish play _The Playboy of the Western World_ caused a scandal and indeed riots over the content. The main source was that the titular character's suspected murder of his father was Played for Laughs. The second was that one character has a line about "a drift of females standing in their shifts".
-   _The Puppetry of the Penis_ — "The ancient Australian art of genital origami".
-   Richard Wagner was no stranger to this.
    -   _Tannhäuser_ opens inside the _Venusberg_.
    -   _Das Rheingold_ opens with the Rhine Maidens frolicking underwater in a scene that scandalized many in the 1870s. One critic referred to it as _das Hurenaquarium_ ("the whores' aquarium"), which angered the husband of one of the singers who had been in that scene so much that he took the critic to court.
    -   Act 1 of _Die Walküre_ closes with long-separated twins Siegmund and Sieglinde about to have sex, just when (in the words of Wagner's stage instructions) "the curtain falls quickly". Compared to that, even the much-loved "Wotan's farewell and fire magic" at the end of act three faces tough competition.
-   _Salome_: Richard Strauss's opera in particular is best known for the "Dance of the Seven Veils" (as in, the title character takes them off).
-   _Spring Awakening_: Naturally, by virtue of its subject matter. In particular the scene at the end of Act I where we often get a peek of Wendla's breasts and Melchior's butt.
-   _Tea & Sympathy_ was remembered for the scandal it caused over two plot elements (both of which were removed in the film adaptation.)
    -   A teenage boy being caught sunbathing with his gay teacher.
    -   The female lead (a 30-something coach's wife) unbuttoning her cardigan as she plants The Big Damn Kiss on the aforementioned boy.

    Visual Novels 

-   Danganronpa is a series of visual novels featuring a majority of attractive female characters in the overall cast, who cause most female followers of the series to become Les Yay in regards to them. Appealing character designs are including but not limited to Sayaka Maizono, Aoi Asahina, Celestia Ludenberg, Junko Enoshima, Ibuki Mioda, Chiaki Nanami, Mahiru Koizumi, and Komaru Naegi. These characters have either large thighs or a large bust to compensate for if they don't have a physically attractive face.

    Web Animation 

-   _My Little Pony: Equestria Girls Digital Series_: You'll find plenty of teenage viewers who find the beach shorts one of the most memorable things about this series, especially "Unsolved Selfie Mysteries".
-   The most infamous sketch in the _NiN10Doh!_ trilogy of parody videos, even to those who haven't watched them, is _Pokémon Snap XXX_ in _$00pah NiN10Doh!_. While all three of the videos have some fanservice in them, _Pokémon Snap XXX_ takes it into overdrive where Todd takes pictures of anthropomorphic female Pokémon in really skimpy bikinis, some of them even going topless (albeit censored). This caused all video copies on YouTube to be either restricted to adults or the sketch itself removed. _To the 64th Power_ greatly toned down the fanservice, likely in response to the sketch and the reputation it gave the series.

    Webcomics 

-   The eighth issue of _Sonichu_, the most sexually explicit one, is also the most infamous.

    Web Videos 

-   _Aaron_ is a pretty good Irish Short Film about a troubled relationship between two brothers. What got the most comments when the trailer was released? Chris appearing shirtless for a brief scene. Seen here, about six minutes in for those who are curious.
-   _The Lizzie Bennet Diaries_:
    -   Parodied at the end of one episode, Lydia leans in for a kiss and says to Lizzie "don't you want more views?"
    -   Straight example in Episode 45, which is known for Wickham's Shirtless Scene.
-   _The Nutters_ got a good portion of its viewers from the fact that the lead character takes his top off to go to bed and doesn't put it back on for a good five minutes (of a twenty-five minute Short Film). The Christmas Special likewise has an equally remembered moment where Jake is video called while about to take a shower and is mistakenly thought to be fully naked.
-   A YouTube video on a channel known as _Vlogvetica_ featured a naked guy walking in the background, for maybe one second, and was never pointed out in the actual video. Guess what every single comment was about.
-   For that matter, there are entire YouTube channels out there (seriously, countless numbers of them) _dedicated_ to Fanservice. If they don't feature titillating scenarios created by the site owner, they'll include all manner of Fanservicey scenes from films and television — in some cases, from movies and shows that are terrible or extremely obscure and worth watching _only_ for the fanservice.
-   _Youth & Consequences_: The first episode has a fanservicey Shower Scene involving Farrah and Colin, who both get awkwardly get into the shower together so they can share their secrets knowing neither party is recording anything.
-   Parodied in _Demolition D's_ Super Serious Spring Anime Season First Impressions 2015 video has its most iconic joke being "Yuri Undertones", which has him getting angry at being told there was lots of yuri in _Show by Rock!!_ only to get Yuri Undertones instead, all to exaggerated comedic effect.

_"Hello, yes? I'm here for the yuri. I was told there'd be yuri. No? It's more just undertones and Ecchi hello kitty sequences? This isn't what I was promised! No, I'm sorry, I have to go, no, you, NO, YOU SAID, NO, UNDERTONES ARE NOT YURI, OKAY? YOU GO ALL THE WAY OR YOU GO HOME, I'M NOT DEALING WITH THIS! IT'S YOUR ONE JOB, MY COFFEE MAKER HAS ONE JOB, TO MAKE COFFEE AND IT MANAGES TO DO THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY! I'M NOT ON THE RECEIVING END OF "COFFEE UNDERTONES"! THEY'RE GIRLS, IF THEY'RE NOT DOING GAY THINGS TO EACH OTHER THEN WHAT ARE THEY GOOD FOR???"_

-   RebelTaxi is an animation critic known for his crude sense of humor. His most viewed video is his "Top 10 Failed Animated Pilots," which is best remembered for the fact he slipped hentai into the video.
-   _SMG4_ features an array of different characters, including original ones, but some of the more well known original characters are the Animesque girls, specifically Melony.

    Real Life 

-   Ironic considering the trope name, but Fanservice itself generally refers to anything put into a work specifically to please its fans (a scene between two fan-favourite characters for instance) - but it's most commonly associated with titillation or sexy stuff.
    -   The term "doujinshi" (in most cases, the shortened "doujin") also became heavily associated with hentai in later years, despite its original term having nothing to do with "parody" porn, even with fan-made derivative work at all. It's originally a term for self-published works like _Haibane Renmei_, as the term itself implies: "同人誌" literally means "published by the same person (who wrote it)".
-   The Furry Fandom has a case near-exact to the Brony fandom listed in Western Animation above, due to the _**large**_ abundance of yiff artwork on the internet, especially from well-known furry artists like Kazecat, Jay Naylor, and Eric w. Schwartz. However, this has also caused furries to develop a bad reputation among certain people outside the fandom who often stereotype them as depraved sex addicts.
-   Katrina Darrell was in the auditions of Season 8 of _American Idol_. This is the infamous "Bikini Girl".
-   That _American's Greatest Inventor_ show? The one with the Naughty Knot Lingerie.
-   And practically every girl/girl group act who was talentless but _hawt_ on shows like _America's Got Talent_ and the like, where their looks swayed the male judges but not the female one(s). In the first season of _America's Got Talent_, the first presentation of stripper Michelle L'Amour was especially memorable: judges David Hasselhoff and Piers Morgan had to physically struggle against judge Brandy Norwood not to have their buzzers pressed.
-   Bill Clinton was the President of the United States for eight years (1993-2001). The only thing that many people remember about him was his many sex scandals (Paula Jones, Gennifer Flowers, and, most infamous of all, Monica Lewinsky). Parodied on _Mock the Week_ when the panel suggested that then British Prime Minister Gordon Brown should have a sex scandal so that no one would remember his actual policies.
-   When Brandi Chastain ripped off her soccer jersey and displayed her (not particularly immodest) sports bra.
    -   Now name the event, year, and opponent. Winning the 1999 Women's World Cup against the Chinese team.
    -   Thanks to a combination of this and Small Reference Pools, quite a few people don't remember it was Chastain that actually did this and instead attribute this to Mia Hamm, since she's the only female soccer player a lot of people can name. They don't even remember the person, just the bra.
-   Scarlett Johansson, one of the most attractive actresses in Hollywood, is best known for this in her films and in some photoshoots in real life.
-   Pointed out by _MAD_ in their "50 Worst Things About Sports" issue, listing this and "Anna Kournikova panty shots" as the only things that will ever be remembered about female athletes.
    -   And now we can add the Venus and Serena Williams in tennis; they're either known as those two Amazonian Beauty tennis sisters, or the ones that mainstreamed loud, aggressive, yet unexpectedly _passionate sounding_ grunts and shouts to the sport. Nevermind that for the better part of a decade they were indisputably the #1 and #2 female tennis players in the world, only trading the spot back and forth between each other, and almost unbeatable as a doubles team.
    -   Another example is Michelle Jenneke's pre-race dancing. People remember that who couldn't tell you her name, nationality, the event she was racing in, and the outcome of the race. (Jenneke's Australian and she was racing in the 100 meter hurdles race at the 2012 World Junior Championships in Athletics in Barcelona, Spain. She finished in fifth place and American Morgan Snow won the event.)
-   Any and all "sex tapes" scandals. Whether or not the person is at all notable is irrelevant, as is the fact that it is indistinguishable from amateur porn, famous people having sex is _clearly_ interesting.
    -   Most notably, Paris Hilton basically built _an entire career_ using this trope.
    -   Kim Kardashian, whilst she built the majority of her career on a sex tape with singer Ray J, is basically the epitome of Ms. Fanservice. Does anyone actually have any idea what she does?
-   The Los Angeles debuts of _Four Weddings and a Funeral_ was going to be Hugh Grant's big debut in America. However, his girlfriend, unknown actress Elizabeth Hurley, showed up wearing a Stripperiffic Versace dress held together with giant safety pins. Hurley was on the cover of every fashion and celebrity publication, which both launched her career and made Versace a household name.
-   Channing Tatum seems to be heading down this road. While a good actor in his own right, once news leaked that he worked as a male stripper for a year before finding success as an actor, it's all anyone wants to talk about, and although he's capitalizing on it with the movie _Magic Mike,_ it tends to bleed over into his promotion of other movies, like _The Vow._ Not even the episode of _Saturday Night Live_ he hosted was immune to exploiting this: he admitted it in the monologue, was shirtless in a couple of sketches, and even played a male stripper in the final sketch of the night.
-   Similarly screenwriter Diablo Cody has penned many scripts such as _Juno_, _Jennifer's Body_ and _Ricki and the Flash_. But one thing everyone remembers about her is that she used to work as a stripper.
-   Joe Manganiello has been hit with this so hard there's cultural commentary about it (article contains some potentially-NSFW _Magic Mike_ screenshots.) Between his Walking Shirtless Scene on _True Blood_ and his run as "Big Dick Richie" in _Magic Mike,_ some female bloggers have noticed that almost every appearance he does is less about asking about him or his movie roles and more about the female presenters pawing at him, getting him to take off his shirt, and asking questions like what kind of underwear he wears. They've started to notice (some amused, some a little more worried) that women have been objectifying him the same way they complain about men objectifying women. For what it's worth, Manganiello himself seemed to get a little frustrated with it after a while, but seems to be a good sport about it, apparently saying at one point he's done all the serious classical theater already and is just having fun at this point.
-   In the first 2012 Mexican presidential candidate debate, everyone remembered the former Playboy model that served as an aide in the debate.
-   In spite of the number of channels it runs, the variety of movies it shows, and its attempts both past and present to make more mainstream original programming, Cinemax is still mainly remembered for soft-core porn and plenty of it - to the point where it's still frequently referred to as "Skinemax", even though it doesn't actually have this programming any more.
-   Even though they sell a wide variety of different gifts, collectibles, fandom merch, and novelties, for many, Spencer's will forever be known as "that store in the mall that sells sex toys".
-   Do you remember Dennis Kucinich or anything about his politics when he ran for the 2008 Democratic nomination for the presidency of the United States? How about the six-foot-tall redhead 30 years his junior that was his wife?
-   Averted by Sylvester Stallone. Most people are not aware that he started his career in a softcore pornography movie — and that's just the way he likes it.
-   At the APEC 2015 Summit, held in Manila, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto got the attention of the Philippine media and netizens for being the only two handsome men among a bunch of middle-aged and older world leaders. They were even dubbed "APEC hotties" by the media, nearly overshadowing the issues being discussed at the summit and those the militant activist groups were protesting outside. Canadians were unsurprised at the attention Trudeau received, but Mexicans were disgusted of the Filipinos fawning over Peña Nieto for his looks, mainly because of Peña Nieto's record-low approval ratings in his native country. As an illustrative comment puts it: "It's like corruption is the new sexy".
-   Margot Robbie became a sex symbol almost overnight with her memorable role in _The Wolf of Wall Street_. People often forget that she's actually quite a gifted actress in addition to her beauty. She parodied this with her cameo in _The Big Short_ - where she appears As Herself to explain complex financial terms... entirely from a bubble bath.
-   As noted under the many examples listing her films, Jennifer Connelly was known in the 90s and early 2000s as a Ms. Fanservice - despite getting critical acclaim for most of her roles (critics often said she was too good for her Ms. Fanservice moments). With _Requiem for a Dream_ and _A Beautiful Mind_, she transcended this trope and earned respect as a serious actress (although, that said, _Requiem for a Dream_ is still most widely remembered for its explicit sex show sequence involving Connelly's character and a sex toy which is almost always circulated out of context).
-   The Pre-Code Era is mainly remembered for all the lewd content in films. Pre-code sex films have their own page on Wikipedia, and each film listed on this wiki's page for that era includes any Fanservice or sexual content.
-   Pamela Anderson is the lady with the big boobs. She got a reduction in an attempt to be taken seriously - then quickly realised that wasn't working and got her implants back in.
-   Marilyn Monroe seems to be more remembered as a sex symbol than an actress. The most famous example featuring her is listed under _The Seven Year Itch_'s entry. It's often forgotten that she was still quite a gifted actress, and made sure she studied drama. This dogged her during her life and one of the reasons she married playwright Arthur Miller was in the hopes that she'd be taken seriously.
-   A tragic example was actress Carole Landis. A beautiful blonde who became famous for _One Million B.C._ but was best known for her looks. Nicknamed 'The Chest' and 'The Ping Girl' because of her curvy figure, she longed to be taken seriously. She was known for dating lots of men who viewed her as a sex toy and, after being spurned by Rex Harrison (who she was deeply in love with), she committed suicide. It's speculated that she feared her looks fading as she approached thirty, and her career would be over. Jacqueline Susann based Jennifer North in _Valley of the Dolls_ off her.
-   Sharon Tate, who played Jennifer in _Valley of the Dolls_, was often ignored when it came to her acting talents and people just focused on her sex appeal (since she was happy to do nudity). She was very disdainful of the film _Don't Make Waves_ - which heavily marketed itself around her spending most of the runtime in a bikini. After her tragic death, Roman Polański said that people always talked about her beauty but never about how _good_ she was.
-   Jessica Alba is best known for her Ms. Fanservice roles in _Fantastic Four Duology_, _Sin City_ and especially _Into the Blue_. She despised the latter - as many scenes were shot behind her back with a body double in a bikini, which led to her spending most of it not wearing very much.
-   The cabarets in Paris. Everyone expects to see showgirls there, from scantily clad and/or bare-breasted (the Lido or Le Moulin Rouge for instance) to wearing nothing at all (at the Crazy Horse).
-   As told in this _Defunctland_ video, not every dark ride in boats is a Tunnel of Love, but a few earn this reputation anyway - including the subject of discussion, which is actually the oldest one still active in the US, and with the video research discovering some news reports downright saying it frequently had tenants who "exchange pleasantries".

**Waldorf:** You know, it's funny, but I don't remember any fanservice in this show.  
**Statler:** At our age, we can barely remember the show at all!  
**Waldorf:** Well thank goodness for that!  
**Both:** Dohohohohohohoh!

## Yuri Undertones - Demolition D

Parodied hard. Demolition D gets angry at there only being Yuri Undertones rather than actual Yuri, with his rage being overly exaggerated to comedic effect.
