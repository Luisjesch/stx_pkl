_I'm the most sensitive man on God's green earth!  
Here's a rose bouquet...  
I also baked you some fresh Crème Brûlée..._

When people think of baking, they often think of their mother's fresh chocolate chip cookies, warm loaves of bread, and sugary cakes. It's linked to sweets, motherhood, childhood nostalgia, and hard, passionate work. So, it's no wonder that the characters who like to bake are often portrayed to be just as sweet as the food they're making.

Female bakers will be cute and caring; male bakers may be less obviously soft, but will still be kindhearted Nice Guys, and perhaps also strong from all the hard work, but remember that in this case, Real Men Cook and Real Men Wear Pink. Regardless of gender, they're often portrayed as idealistic, friendly, and passionate about their craft. They're also typically more feminine in nature than they are masculine; after all, Feminine Women Can Cook, so it stands to reason that good bakers are also feminine and may even like to bake _because_ they're feminine.

Often prone to saying things like "the secret ingredient is love", and may also cook with Grandma's Recipe — if they aren't the Granny Classic themselves. They're also typically a Supreme Chef in the field of baking, not just someone with a general interest.

Contrast Angry Chef and Evil Chef. Compare and Contrast with The Blacksmith, who shares this trope's positive connotation and hard work ethic, but in a more masculine field. See also Through His Stomach.

-   Miu Iruma from _Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony_ shows shades of this, all while mixed with Black Comedy. In her final Free Time Event with Shuichi Saihara, Miu has come to terms with being in love with him and decides to bake him some sweets, like a pie, some cookies, and chocolates. The thing is...

-   _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_: Queen Comet the Chef, Moon's mother and Star's grandmother, was famed for her culinary skills. She especially loved to bake and often did so with her daughter as Moon was growing up. She was also a genuine example of the The High Queen (as opposed to many of Mewini's other queens who publicised the image to reassure their citizens but had personal failings and rarely lived up to it) as well as the one who tried to end conflicts with the Monsters going against centuries of prejudice and hate, and almost brought about a new world that would benefit all. Unfortunately her kind-hearted and trusting nature led to her underestimating how hate-filled Toffee of the Septarians was, enabling him to murder her.
-   _Tuca & Bertie_: Bertie, although her attempts to join the industry show us some decidedly non-sweet bakers. Nonetheless, she's kind enough that Speckle started seeing her after a brief interaction at a party. Helps that Speckle's into that sort of thing.
