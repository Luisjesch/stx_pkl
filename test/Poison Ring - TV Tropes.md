Many combat-oriented characters will have some concealed weapons on them. The Gun Nut will have holdout pistols, the Blade Enthusiast will build sheaths into all his clothes, and so on.

But how does a Master Poisoner keep his "supplies" on him? Often, it's with a Poison Ring — an elaborate ring with a hidden compartment just big enough for a stash of high-powered poison.

Most often, a Poison Ring holds a pellet or some powder that can be dumped into the victim's dinner. A subset of these rings overlaps with Poisoned Weapons, and inject the toxin by some means. A Poison Ring could also be used for cases where the victim is to be drugged instead of killed.

While rings are the most commonly used poison holder, any item of personal adornment can go here.

No connection at all to Rings of Death. Compare Cyanide Pill, where the poison is intended as a means of suicide to avoid being taken alive.

-   Georgi Markov was a Bulgarian defector who, after finding shelter in London, became a fierce critic of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. Then, in 1978, after feeling a stinging pain on his way to work, he fell mysteriously ill and died days later. An investigation and autopsy later confirmed that he was assassinated by order of the Bulgarian government, with aid from the KGB, by getting shot with a small pellet containing ricin, a powerful poison that kills with minute doses. Although the "gun" used to administer the pellet was never found, an account from Markov before he died had forensic researchers suspecting the weapon was an advanced shooting device hidden _inside an umbrella_ (with the _barrel_ shooting out of the umbrella's tip), of all places. A similar attack on _another_ Bulgarian defector was recorded in Paris days earlier. This one also used a ricin pellet, but it failed. After surviving, the victim claimed that the suspect was not carrying an umbrella, which begs the question as to _what exactly was the assassin's weapon disguised as_. It was almost certainly though, an example of this trope.
-   In 2018, a ring like this was found in the fortress of Caliacra, the former capital of a medieval Bulgarian feudal state.
