_"I'm fairly sure if they took porn off the Internet, there'd only be one website left, and it'd be called 'Bring Back the Porn!'"_

Let's face it. The Internet — and a lot of people's computers — are full of Pornography. Sometimes deliberately, or maybe you've just got a bug on your computer that fills it with filth; it's _totally_ your little brother's fault for clicking an unsafe link. Whether you're portraying modern days, the VR-laden future, or another universe entirely, any computer network of a sufficient size will have a place where one can indulge in the pleasures of the flesh. Porn constitutes about 30% of all internet traffic, according to one study. Some even suggest a porn search engine! (Making the image to the right even funnier...)

In fact, many of the internet's innovations — particularly in e-commerce, encryption, and streaming video — originated with porn and the desire to consume it safely and efficiently. Even YouTube was founded partly in response to Janet Jackson's Wardrobe Malfunction at the 2004 Super Bowl,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  and Google Images was developed in response to the tidal wave of search queries for pictures of Jennifer Lopez's infamous green dress with a Navel-Deep Neckline from the 2000 Grammys. Never undervalue the human desire to see scandalized naked flesh.

Partly a result of The Rule of First Adopters. Ubiquitous enough to result in Rule 34. For some, the Internet has become such a convenient Porn Stash that it is single-handedly breaking the trope Poor Man's Porn, and increasing the mainstream acceptability of "adult entertainment". Corrupting Pornography will usually be found in portrayals which suggest New Media Are Evil.

As noted in this article by Tim Alberta for _Politico_, cracking down on and eventually banning pornography was a key aim of Moral Guardians in the United States as late as the early 2000s, but today, thanks to the internet revolution, even the most diehard anti-porn activists have largely given up on restricting it by legal means, instead favoring PR campaigns designed to dissuade people from watching it and financial services from supporting it.

Even those with censored Internet of any form (which usually includes pornography in its blacklists) are usually able to find it with a little effort: the vast majority of Internet censorship-circumventing practices is for porn rather than political purposes. Any such censoring will have cracks, and porn is among the first things to fall through. The only people who have to resort to porn substitutes are ones without the Internet.

Seriously, what are you doing on _this_ website? (Probably Addiction Displacement.) Unfortunate Search Results are often a result of there being so _much_ porn on the Internet it's hard to find anything that _isn't_ pornography. Contrast The Internet Is for Cats for the _literal_ kind of pussy that you're likely to find online (unless you're looking for stuff about cat mating).

    Anime & Manga 

-   In _Bloody Monday_, the main character tells his younger sister he's looking at porn, but that's only to keep her from peeking in on his hacking activities. Sick, but effective.
-   In chapter 0 of _A Centaur's Life_, centaur Himeno has worried that her private parts looked abnormal ever since a boy had taunted her with a cow's rear end on an elementary school field trip. Her friend Nozomi's first idea for settling her anxiety is to go search the internet for porn, but Himeno's family doesn't have a computer.
-   _Chobits_: The main character wanted a persocom specifically to "surf the porn sites". To add to that, the computers here are humanoid, attractive, and naturally affectionate, it raises questions about just what the porn sites here _are_...
-   The first Omake of _Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA 3rei_ had the following exchange after Kuro displayed a surprising amount of knowledge about Yaoi.
    
    **Illya:** Just how are you so well-informed about this, Kuro!?  
    **Kuro:** I saw it on the Internet.  
    **Illya:** This is all because of the net generation!
    
-   The only time the Internet was used in _Girl Friends (2006)_ involved a scene where Akko was surfing porn as research on how to have sex with Mari.
-   Downplayed in episode 4 of _Kiniro Mosaic_. Aya thinks that Isami doesn't allow Shinobu to use the former's computer (with a lame excuse) was due to the latter's non-sexual blonde fetish. Aya's Imagine Spot of what Shinobu would do if she finds pictures of blondes online makes Shinobu's response look similar to a horny guy's response to pornography.
-   The whole reason Riko and Ako in _kiss×sis_ get a computer is for porn since it's free and uncensored. Of course, their plan fails.
-   In _Midori Days_, Seiji and Midori go into a library at one point to find information. Seiji, not having had much experience with the Internet, is quite impressed with the search engine, and is halfway through typing "big tits" when Midori interrupts him.
-   In _Oreimo_, a mad Kirino confronts her brother Kyousuke about this after finding out that he used her laptop to surf for porn in episode 7; but she gave him the laptop so he could play one of her numerous eroges, so it's not clear what she's offended about...
-   _Paranoia Agent_: A sleazy reporter investigating the "Lil' Slugger" case "borrows" a library computer used by two adolescent boys. When he gives it back to the boys, they promptly return to the site they were originally looking at, which is - you guessed it - a Japanese soft-core porn site.
-   In _Poor Poor Lips_, Nako's first attempt to use the Internet lands her in a porn site.
-   In _Real Drive_, it is explained that this is the prime reason most of the population supported the development of the Meta-Real Network. Which given how much porn is attributed to the spread of video tapes, video cameras, HD-TV, broadband internet, and even printing, seems very plausible.
-   _Space☆Dandy_: A Chameleonian, an alien race whose true identity has not been seen by man, sneaks onto the Aloha Oe and messes with the gang by using Dandy's toothbrush, eating Meow's octopus flavored Popsicle, and visiting porn sites on QT's phone.
-   The alien data beings encountered in _Trans Venus_ are stated to be obsessed with human sex because of internet porn. The implications for any such being evolving on Earth are... disturbing.

    Comic Books 

-   In a "footnote" in Larry Gonick's _Cartoon History of the Modern World: Volume II_, the narrator mentions that the birth control pill was the greatest invention of the 20th century, prompting two characters in bed to say:
    
    **Woman:** Greater than the Internet?  
    **Man:** Sex can make me forget about the Internet, but the Internet can't make me forget about sex!
    
-   After Spider-Man reveals his secret identity during _Civil War (2006)_, so many people google "Peter Parker" that it crashes the entire Internet. Including the porn sites.
-   _Micronauts (IDW)_ at one point has Biotron connect to the Internet to find out information on Earth, leading to him commenting on the abundance of cat videos and pictures of nude women there.
-   _Rick and Morty (Oni)_: In issue 37, after Morty locks himself in his room for a week, Rick and Beth start panicking that he’s gotten past the parental controls.

    Comic Strips 

-   _Dilbert_:
    -   Wally is setting out his long-range project goals at an annual staff meeting:
        
        **Wally:** My proposed work plan for the year is to stress-test our product under severe network conditions. I will accomplish this by downloading large image files from the busiest servers on the net.  
        **Wally:** _\[after his proposal is rejected\]_ I was _this close_ to making it my job to download naughty pictures.  
        **Dilbert:** Just as well; I'd have had to kill you.
        
    -   Dilbert decides at one point to apply his coding skills to inventing a filter to prevent kids from seeing dirty pictures on the Internet. Dogbert tries to warn him that "pitting your intelligence against the collective sex drive of all the teenagers who own computers" is a fool's errand, but Dilbert overconfidently presses on and gets a teenage boy to test his invention. Judging by the expression on the boy's face, it evidently fails.
-   _FoxTrot_ has referenced the trope a few times over the years:
    -   Back in the '90s, a strip had Paige complaining about how no matter what she searched for, all she got were porn sites. Peter then points out that the "White House photos" results probably _were_ legit.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
    -   One of the first strips where the Foxes got internet had Andy remarking on all the things Jason could learn with it. Cut to...
        
        **Jason:** Miss October sure has big hooters.  
        **Marcus:** I wonder if that affects the download speed...
        

    Fan Works 

-   _The Bolt Chronicles_:
    -   In "The Cameo," Penny and her friend read and make fun of smut fanfiction featuring the former TV star and her dog.
    -   In "The Autobiography," Mittens inadvertently opens a porn website on Penny’s desktop computer. It immediately begins littering the screen with pop-ups and downloading a likely malicious file. Penny’s mom also may or may not be looking at porn on her personal laptop.
-   Used in _Calvin & Hobbes: The Series_, as Socrates warns Calvin of "all those dirty websites and whatnot."
-   In _Distortions (Symphogear)_, Qiao Cai mentions that there has been a lot of artwork of the Adaptors on the internet after their identities were leaked. When Shirabe shows interest, Tsubasa and Maria quickly warn the others that they will wind likely end up stumbling across a lot of porn of themselves if they try to search.
-   In _Empath: The Luckiest Smurf_, as with the _Star Trek_ holodecks, the Imaginarium is also being used to satisfy a Smurf's desire to be alone with a Smurfette, as seen on more than a few occasions.
-   _Hardcore Entertainment presents "Seven Does Voyager"_: When a sex scene happens on _Voyager_, Harry Kim downloads the camera images onto the InterstellerNet so every alien in light years is too busy jerking off to attack them. Seven of Nine does the same, hoping that all that jerking off will stunt their growth.
-   In _Hawk-Eyed Charlie_ Sirius is banned from the internet after watching Hentai five hours a day for a month.
-   Due to being a Jedi her whole life, when Shaak-Ti enters a relationship with Ranma in _A Horse for the Force_, she looks to the hypernet<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  to understand how their courtship should go. She's amazed and appalled by the sheer amount of human/togrutan porn she finds.
-   In _In Flight_, Shirou was under the impression the Internet was nothing else, much to Matsu's ire. She then proceeded to accidentally prove him right when she used a wide and extremely... inventive collection of porn as part of his computer training.
-   Invoked in _Lovehammer_ by _The God-Emperor of Mankind_, speaking to the Mechanicus.
    
    **The Emperor:** No, it is perfectly normal for global network throughput to spontaneously consist of over forty percent pornography. Slaanesh has nothing to do with it.
    
-   Any and all _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ fan fictions or artworks that involve the ponies discovering the internet is _guaranteed_ to have them discover the veritable buttload of porn of them that exists and react with utter shock and horror.
-   _Niflheim Academy_ mentions in passing the time Dudley's computer crashed due to the then _ten-year-old_ downloading too much porn.
-   A scene from a _Codename: Kids Next Door_ fanfiction titled "Operation: M.O.V.I.E.S." involves Sector V hacking into a computer, attempting to find out what the adults are "hiding from them". Unfortunately, the first thing Sector V comes across when they successfully hack the computer is a porn website, and they all react with pure horror (expect for Kuki, as her teammates were wise enough to immediately shield her eyes).
-   _Potter's Protector_:
    
    **Harry:** \[Tonks\] is a definite "Nymph". She seems obsessed with sex. And she isn't ashamed about it... I walked into their rooms to find her looking for porn... she said she was looking for more ways to experiment with Dad and Fleur... I DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW THAT!
    
-   In the _Kim Possible_ fic _Trio_, Shego convinces Kim of the benefits of Polyamory, and then they spring it on Ron:
    
    **Kim**: I think we broke his mind?  
    **Shego**: Ron? It's called a threesome.  
    **Ron**: Shego, I am a normal healthy male teenager with a computer with internet access. I know what a threesome is. I'm just shocked you both want me in one.  
    **Shego**: Why Ronald, are you saying you have looked at internet porn?  
    **Ron**: It's the internet. Kind of hard to avoid the porn.
    

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _American Reunion_, Michelle's attempt to type in the first four letters of "amazon.com" reveals that her husband Jim had used the computer to visit "amazingcollegesluts.com".
-   The film adaptation of _Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant_ used this as a joke. After Darren is transformed and nearly kills his little sister for blood, he returns to his room where he finds Mr. Crepsley sitting in the corner flipping through a magazine, and Crepsley casually comments "Interesting... I thought they had this on the Internet now."
-   In _C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America_, slavery is still legal, and online slave trading auctions have pumped millions into the economy... and pornography is _still_ the top-selling item on the 'net.
-   The Lifetime Original Movie _Cyber Seduction: His Secret Life_ is a So Bad, It's Good story about a teenager who becomes addicted to internet porn and his life is destroyed because of it. It's like a nondenominational live-action Chick Tract about how New Media Are Evil. Just to make it confusing he's only found out because he inexplicably makes hard copies and hides them poorly (suggesting the writer was unclear on the concept or hastily adapted a script about dirty magazines), and depending on the scene it renders him either obsessed or utterly disinterested with real-life sex.
-   In _Ex Machina_, Caleb's taste in internet porn surprisingly becomes plot relevant. At one point he asks Nathan whether he used this data to design Ava to match his preference. Nathan confirms this.
-   In _Fireproof_, Kirk Cameron's character Caleb Holt becomes so addicted to internet porn that when he takes on The Love Dare to get back his wife, one of the things he does is take his computer outside and trash it with a baseball bat.
-   In _The Innkeepers_, when Claire goes through Luke's internet history to find his paranormal site, she finds that he had been using the work computer to surf for porn.
-   In _Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back_, when trying to explain what the internet is to Jay, it is described thusly:
    
    **Holden:** The Internet is a communication tool used the world over where people can come together to bitch about movies and share pornography with one another.
    
    -   Hilariously enough, _Roger Ebert_, of all people, found this to be a more realistic assessment of the internet than many other movies at the time had.
-   In the 1997 informative video _The Kids Guide to the Internet_, this issue is skirted around and not mentioned by name. The Internet was already a major purveyor of porn and creepy people by 1997, so there is a part at the end of the video about watching your kids' Internet habits.
    -   The explanation of the .com and .gov tags is actually a very subtle but important point. At the time and now, the White House (which they visit) was www.whitehouse.**gov**; however, www.whitehouse.**com** was an adult website that the actual White House wrestled legally with because kids didn't know the difference.
-   A somewhat example with _Little Children_, where Sarah's husband becomes addicted to a specific porn persona on the internet, going to such an extreme that he is caught by Sarah masturbating to the porn girl with her online bought panties over his face.
    -   In the book, it goes even further: her husband ends up skipping town to become a full-time groupie for "Slutty Kay" (the internet porn icon he obsesses over), which presumably is similar to the way that Deadheads followed the Grateful Dead around the country.
-   Referenced in _My Super Ex-Girlfriend_, in a scene where Matt doesn't recognize Professor Bedlam. Annoyed, the villain asks, "Don't you watch TV? Read the newspaper? Use the Internet for anything other than porn?"
-   Near the end of the movie, _Sex Ed,_ Cole, who had been fired for teaching sex-ed convinces several parents, including the father of one of his students, a church minster who had the school district ban sex-ed on the ground that students should not learn that in the classroom. Specifically, Cole told the minister, and several parents attending his AA meeting that if they don't have The Talk with their kids, and if sex-ed is not taught in school, then they will go to the internet, where boys will learn that its perfectly ok to treat girls like objects, and girls will learn that its perfectly okay to be treated as an object.
-   _Snuff Movie_: After Wendy calls Andy to tell him she got the job, he congratulates her and then sits down at his computer and starts browsing porn.
-   _Steel_: How is the villain going to sell his weapons?
    
    The internet?
    
    Damn right. We could pick up all kinds of good crap. Not just porno.
    

    Literature 

-   _America (The Book)_ referred to the Internet as a source of communication, information, and "a staggering array of human sexual fetish".
-   _Angels Flight_: Detective Harry Bosch's investigation leads him to a dominatrix's fetish site. He further discovers that the dominatrix's web site has been hacked and hijacked to lead to a far darker example of this trope: a child pornography ring.
-   Actual pornography is implied once or twice in _Animorphs_, but this being a kids' book, we get a more toned-down version: Marco uses the internet almost exclusively to look up scantily clad girls.
-   _Dave Barry in Cyberspace_ frequently returns to the theme of computers being an excellent medium for sexual content. He even devotes a chapter of the book to his visit to "AdultDex", a trade convention for pornographic computer games.
-   Bob the Skull in _The Dresden Files_ is a spirit of intellect. His desire to read raunchy sex novels comes from Harry first meeting him when Harry was a sexually frustrated sixteen-year-old and Bob mirrors his owner's personality upon meeting. This has continued even nearly two decades later. When he comes into the care of one of Harry's friends, still the sex-fiend as that is how the friend first met Bob, Bob discovers the internet.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Upon gaining access to the internet, he is positively _gleeful_ because, "It's, like, ninety percent porn!"
-   _The Enchantment Emporium_: Charlie is known to visit at least one porn website (GirlsWithGuitars.com), and it's implied that Jack does too.
    
    **Charlie:** \[O\]n this side of the gate, Gale boys don't eat anyone they can have a conversation with unless... OW! Allie!  
    **Allie:** He's fourteen.  
    **Jack:** And not stupid. I have an internet connection.
    
-   Hivemind from the _H.I.V.E. Series: The Overlord Protocol_ alludes to this trope with this quote: "I was granted instantaneous and total access to the entire Internet, Mr. Malpense. To be honest, I feel... dirty."
-   In _Into the Looking Glass_ humans make contact with an alien species called the Adar. One of the Adar describes their data net as "announcements of tcheer, and much announcements of herbal remedies to prevent loss of youngness." Tcheer is the age when the Adar reach sexual maturity so basically the cultural equivalent of "barely legal teens" pornography.
-   An impressively early prediction of this trope occurs in the 1946 Murray Leinster short story "A Logic Named Joe."
-   The world of 2033 in _MARZENA_ has the HoloLens and the Mind Merging Bremen Chip which, according to the narrator, were invented for the sole purpose of freeing humans' sexuality and creating brain supernovae.
-   In Jenna Black's _Replica_, most young women in the Executive class are _expected_ to be pure, innocent, and virginal to the point where they know nothing about sex. The internet, however, makes this pretty difficult.
-   _Secret Santa 2004_: Erik uses his expense account to watch lots of pay-per-view porn.
-   One of the jokes in Al Franken's _The Truth (With Jokes)_ asserts that former U.S. Representative Tom DeLay believes this.
-   This trope is actually the premise of the _Unwoven Literary Universe_. From _Beginnings_ onward, each of the main protagonists have to fight an onslaught of digital humanoid beings heavily implied to be data from porn sites. Though the influence from this starts to die off by _Legacy_ and fades entirely by the time the spinoff _Monarch One_ happens.
-   _Welcome to the NHK_:
    -   At one point Satou secludes himself from the outside world (even more) to fill his hard drive with porn. When he runs out of disk space, he starts deleting other stuff. Like his operating system files. _Whoops_.
    -   In the manga adaptation, his porn obsession eventually leads him to build a massive customized rig just for pornography, complete with cavernous hard-drive, several monitors, high-fidelity headphones and a leather massage chair. _In his parents' spare bedroom_. Needless to say, it does not end well.
-   _WWW Trilogy_: Caitlin is frustrated about never having seen a dick resp "peeeniz" (she would love her boyfriend's penis to be the first that she sees. When they actually have Their First Time, she takes her eyePod off, though), so she uses Google Images, after gaining her sight.

    Live-Action TV 

### **In General:**

-   A UFO documentary in the '90s made a claim that UFOs and aliens were the second most popular topic on the Internet. No points for guessing the most popular topic.

### **By Series:**

-   _30 Rock_:
    -   During their staff's temporary stay in Boston Pete informs them that they won't have internet access, and advises the guys to make arrangements "porn-wise".
    -   Also when Liz put Frank in charge during her absence his first directive was to take down the office firewall "so we can browse porn again."
-   As a meta-example, _Andi Mack_'s Working Title had to be changed because there's a porn site by the name they were planning to use.
-   _Battlestar Galactica_: When _Pegasus_ and _Galactica_ meet and the former transmits supplies and computer updates to the latter, Felix Gaeta asks if there's any porn on the computer operating system update disks that _Pegasus_ has sent.
-   In the very first episode of _Chuck_, a bomb is disarmed via a porn site that scrambles the computer of anyone using it. Last episode, too, in a nice callback.
-   Referenced in _The Closer_, when Brenda becomes the "most downloaded fully-clothed woman on the internet", thanks to a video of her getting beaten by a Bridezilla.
    -   And later in _Major Crimes_, the team is going over the site of a murder, who was killed while he was in his office after midnight. Female detective Amy Sykes wonders aloud "What would a man be doing at 2 in the morning all alone on his computer?", prompting every male detective in the room to look at her in amazement, such that she then says "Oh".
-   _Cobra Kai_: Johnny is something of a Luddite, ignorant about any sort of technology newer than The '80s. He finally breaks down and gets a computer; after struggling with the wi-fi for a while he eventually gets connected to the Internet. The very first thing he types in the search engine? "Hot babes"
-   From _The Colbert Report_: "30% of Internet traffic is porn, according to the European Foundation for Underestimating Things!"
-   In _Coupling_ the men debate the merits of drugs used in pregnancy, by the statement that there is no such thing as a natural, painless pregnancy, and that the Internet is a "research tool".
-   On _Crownies_, Tracey unwisely clicks on a link Tatum sends her. She ends up opening a porn site that she can't close down and which reappears every time she starts up her computer. She ends up smashing her computer so she can get a new one.
-   Inverted in _Dexter_: when the show's protagonist (and serial-killer) is interrupted while tampering with the police database, he promptly alt-tabs to a porn site, because that's what you _do_ alone in an office with the blinds pulled down, isn't it? Doakes doesn't buy it for a second, though.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "The Stolen Earth": Rose can only watch Harriet's video conference with the other companions since Wilf isn't allowed to have a webcam — his daughter says they're naughty.
    -   "The Eleventh Hour": The Doctor walks in on Jeff and grabs at his computer, which Jeff desperately tries to hide, to no avail.
        
        **The Doctor:** ...Blimey, get a girlfriend, Jeff!  
        _\[later...\]_  
        **The Doctor:** Oh, and delete your Internet history.
        
    -   It's a minor Running Gag that the Twelfth Doctor doesn't want anyone to see his browser history. Exactly _what_ he's been looking at is left to the viewer's imagination.
        
        **Osgood:** _Whoa._  
        **The Doctor:** Yeah, I said don't...
        
-   Simon and River's father doesn't want a Cortex extension in the house because he thinks this on _Firefly_ but Simon's mom already got the extension so he loses the fight.
-   _The Good Place_: In "Chidi Sees the Time Knife", Judge Gen's first sign that being a mortal is more complicated than she thought is when she did a Google search on "big, juicy, natural tomatoes", and stumbled upon a website for sunburn fetishists.
-   In one episode of _Horrible Histories,_ a victorian man starts surfing the internet. He looks up word games, and the very first link he clicks infects his computer with a virus that keeps sending him, much to his distress, popups of porn sites entirely based around girls with skirts above floor length, no gloves, swimming in the ocean, etc. Especially funny if you're aware of the vast ammounts of smut the Victorians produced. In fact, watch the clip once you reach the bottom of the page.
-   _House_:
    -   When the title character is trying to get out of doing something: "There's a lot of porn piling up on the internet... doesn't download itself!"
        
        **House:** Sorry — up late. Internet porn.  
        **Dr. Chase:** How come you're not in your office?  
        **House:** Because there is a computer in my office. If I log on, romance will ensue. My wrist might fall off.
        
    -   Also:
        
        **House:** Infectious or environmental... all we have to do is check out parasites, viruses, bacteria, fungi, prions, radiation, toxins, chemicals, or it's internet porn–related. I'll check the internet, you guys get the rest of the stuff.
        
    -   ALSO:
        
        **House:** _\[to a Fellow\]_ What's the matter? Got a problem with the naked female form?  
        **Fellow:** N-no...  
        **Thirteen:** Maybe because she's never seen it spooning with the naked _dolphin_ form.
        
    -   ALSO Also:
        
        **House:** She's like the internet with breasts! Wait, no. The internet already has breasts.
        
-   _The Inbetweeners_
    
    **Jay:** He's probably on the internet looking up the answers to the exam questions.  
    **Neil:** And then having a wank.  
    **Simon:** What?  
    **Neil:** Well, it's impossible, innit? I don't think I've ever been on the internet and not ended up having a wank.
    
-   In _Joan of Arcadia_, Joan's younger brother was shown to have an addiction to Internet porn.
    -   However, he blamed it on his less geeky best friend, who did indeed routinely use that computer. It was never made quite clear who stored the porn on his computer.
-   One episode of _Law & Order_ featured a case involving an investment banker who had become so obsessed with an online "live video chat" sex worker, to the point that she (and the gangsters she was working for) was using him to get insider information to make illegal stock trades.
    -   Similarly, another episode from the late 1990s had a TEENAGER becoming so obsessed with a madame he met online that he borrowed friends' computers and maxed out his parents' credit cards to feed his addiction. His father decided to solve the problem by shooting said madame.
-   On _Love That Girl_ this trope is the reason Tiana's father still does work with a typewriter. It works and a full functioning computer is just a step away from porn in the workplace.
-   On the _Modern Family_ episode "Not In My House", Phil fails to clear his browser history, causing Claire to think that Luke has been looking at porn on the internet. Hilarity Ensues.
-   _Odyssey 5_: Given that the Sentients increase their artificial intelligence by absorbing code off the internet, they naturally pick up a lot of porn, so the synthetic human the group encounter in "The Trouble With Harry" is more than eager to explore this aspect with a couple of Kurt Mendel's good-time girls.
-   Referenced in _QI_, when Stephen Fry asked what makes up more than 70% of the internet and got the expected response (cue klaxon), before revealing that a study shows that less than 1% of the internet is porn. The term Jimmy Carr used was: "Gentlemen's special interest literature". (For the curious, what actually does account for 70+% of Internet traffic according to that study is spam.)
-   In _Queer as Folk (US)_, Ted was frequently shown, and eventually got fired for, browsing porn sites while at work. Immediately prior to him getting fired, it was shown that several of his co-workers were also viewing porn on the internet while they were supposed to be working. Keep in mind Ted was an accountant.
-   In one episode of _The Red Green Show_, Harold mentions that some people only use the internet for porn. He and Red then both look right at Dalton, who does his best to look casual (and fails miserably).
-   On _Running Wilde_, Fa'ad credited Bill Gates for the invention of the "electronic porno machine".
-   _Scrubs_: According to Dr. Cox, the internet is for porn, as evidenced by the page quote.
    -   Somewhat relatedly, at one point Elliot says she created a chatroom called "I hate Cox", then adds the only people who go there are "Me, two interns, and 14,000 lesbians."
-   _Seinfeld_: George uses porn as part of his computer sales pitch in The Serenity Now.
-   _Sense8_: Shortly before Kala's wedding to Rajan one of her aunties pulls her aside and says Kala can come to her to ask about what happens on a girl's wedding night. Kala sheepishly tells the auntie she already knows all about that because she has access to the internet.
    
    **Auntie:** Oh! I knew that thing was good for something.
    
-   _Sherlock_: Used in "A Scandal in Belgravia":
-   _The Sopranos_: When Tony's daughter realises they're likely to be raided by the FBI soon, she advises her brother to erase all that porn he downloaded off his hard drive.
-   The holodeck in _Star Trek_ seems to be treated an awful lot like the more cerebral version of this. Considering that at least two characters have had full-on romances on the holodeck...
    -   And don't forget Lt. Barclay's "programs"...
        
        **I am the goddess of empathy! Cast off your inhibitions, and embrace life, truth, love!**
        
    -   After being out-flirted in "The Perfect Mate" and being clearly quite... affected, Riker gave one of the best one-liners in the show "If you need me, I'll be in holodeck four."
    -   Quark in _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ explicitly rents out his holosuites for this purpose. "Vulcan Love Slave" seems to be one of the more popular choices.
        -   And why not? The Vulcans are made of fetish fuel.
        -   The first time Odo saw Jake Sisko leaving one of Quark's holosuites he was ready to bring him up on whatever charge relates to exposing a minor to that sort of thing until Quark began gushing about the commercial possibilities of "family entertainment".
        -   Another episode centered around Quark trying to get Major Kira's holoimage so he could make an explicitly pornographic holosuite program of her for a shady client. Kira gets one over on him so the resulting program has Kira's body and Quark's head (and voice). She'd assumed the program was for his personal use, not for a client, but the effect was still... dramatic.
    -   _Voyager_ gets in on it too. When a Vulcan crewman begins to experience _pon farr_ and has trouble finding a willing partner, the Doctor creates a "treatment" program for him on the holodeck.
    -   This is actually confirmed directly in _Star Trek: Lower Decks_. When the command crew is trying to give Mariner the worst jobs on the ship, she is forced to clean out the filters on the Holodeck.
        
        **Ransom**: I've got her emptying \[bleep\] out of the holodeck's \[bleep\] filter!  
        **Freeman**: ...Ugh. People really use it for _that_?  
        **Ranson**: Oh, yeah. It's _mostly_ that.
        
-   On _Supernatural_, each Winchester brother apparently enjoys watching porn when the other isn't looking. Running Gags include bustyasianbeauties.com and Casa Erotica.
    -   Though not on the net, the brothers were once told one of the most important lessons in the series via a porn video. Though the teacher was Gabriel/The Trickster, so it's slightly expected.
    -   In a fourth wall breaking episode, the brothers also learn there is graphic slash fiction of them....
        -   Dean: "Slash?" Sam: "As in Dean/Sam". Dean: "That's sick! Don't they know we're brothers?" Sam: "I don't think they care."
-   On _That '90s Show_, Kitty catches Red looking at provocative images of Raquel Welch on their new computer. Rather than being mad, Kitty is thrilled that Red is embracing technology, and asks him to find her an image of Kirk Douglas.
-   _Top Gear_ running joke:
    
    **Clarkson:** This week I went on the internet, and **I found _this_!**
    
-   An episode of _Touched by an Angel_ entitled "Pandora's Box" revolved around this subject, opening up on a young girl attempting to research Hawaii for a school project and encountering a porn site. The mother is horrified that pornography is now able to enter her house so quickly, while the father slowly becomes sucked into a world of online porn, eventually getting fired from his job for viewing it at work. However, the ultimate message of the episode was that the computer was a gift from God that could be used for good or evil.
-   Laptop-holding Brandon Dicamillo opts out of one of Bam's "Viva La Bam" misadventures because he wants to "stay home and look up porn. And smut. \*pause\* Ew, it's a dog."
-   _The West Wing_: During Leo's I Want My Jet Pack rant in "The Warfare of Genghis Khan", Josh points out that technological advances have brought the Internet, to which Leo summarily dismisses as "a more efficient means of delivering pornography."
-   From _Will & Grace_:
    
    **Grace:** Hey, what are you doing?  
    **Will:** All my plants died. I told Jack to water them while I was away. But I can see how he might hear that as "fill up my hard drive with Internet porn."
    

    Music 

    Podcasts 

-   _You're Dead To Me_: In the episode on the Medieval Papacy, comedian Alison Spittle asks for clarification when Greg refers to the pornocracy (due to a combination of Greg's accent and the utter outrageousness of the term); Greg confirms that it's not "pawn" as in the chess piece, but "porn", as in, "the stuff you find on the internet"

    Radio 

-   On _The Now Show_, during a discussion of how a whole generation were told in maths class "When you grow up, you won't be carrying a calculator in your pocket."
    
    **Steve**: No, we actually have a hand-held computer in our pockets, so advanced you don't even need to type "5318008" and turn it upside down to make it show you boobies.  
    **Hugh**: No, you can just Google "types of seabird" and a whole host of boobies will appear.
    

    Theatre 

-   The Trope Namer is _Avenue Q_, which contains a song appropriately titled The Internet Is For Porn. Kate Monster is extolling the virtues of the Internet, while Trekkie is constantly interrupting about how it's really all about the porn. Kate eventually has a few people back up what she says, until Trekkie asks "Oh, but Kate, what you think he do after?!" which they also gleefully confirm, which causes Kate to react with horror. The Bowdlerised version for school performances naturally rewrites the song (and Trekkie's character) to be about social media addiction instead.

    Video Games 

-   In _The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel III_, Randy is disappointed by the Erebonian Empire's orbal network. It's so boring - if he were in Crossbell, he "could bring up some swimsuit babes just like that."
-   A lot of the porn on the extranet in _Mass Effect_ involves asari. Some of it also involves hanar (who have tentacles).
    -   Between _2_ and _3_, Cerberus attempted to remotely shut EDI down. She responded by flooding their computers with **seven zettabytes** of porn (most of it was Joker's<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> ). For comparison, the _sum of all human knowledge_ around 2011 was estimated to be a quarter of a zettabyte of data.
-   In _Persona 2: Innocent Sin_, you can occasionally be asked by a demon, in your contacts, what the Internet is for. OBVIOUSLY, one of the options, no matter what character is being asked, is to say that it's for porn. It's always funny.
-   In _Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles_, heroine Claire is searching for a computer in a wrecked prison. She asks prisoner Steve if there's one to be found; he responds that he knows of three - "The guards mainly use them for games. Oh, and porn."

-   In _Super Robot Wars OG Saga: Endless Frontier_, this exchange occurs:
    
    **Reiji**: It's funny what you can learn when you spend all day wasting time on the Internet, isn't it?
    
    **KOS-MOS**: Strange... In my time, the Internet is for—-
    
    -   This is even funnier when you remember that in _Xenosaga_, their version of the internet makes use of an extradimensional space that is actually Humanity's Collective Unconscious. Goes to show what's _really_ on everybody's minds...
-   In _The Universim_, the description for electricity jokes that Nuggets will end up using it to share pictures of their genitals.

-   In _Sunrider_, one of Claude's battle quotes states that she "accidentally" downloaded porn from the enemy's network. Not that she seems to mind...

In a later strip, while he browses his hard drive, he comes across his Porn Stash and gets distracted from his task. And in yet another strip Marten has to take him to be repaired by Marigold, who remarks on the amount of porn in Pintsize (then copies the hentai folder).
    -   Pintsize's hard drive has been described as a 'private universe of porn', and his Twitter account is nothing but hentai and Rule 34. Which Marigold then rates the artwork of.

        **Narrator:** As Torg and Riff journey through space on the Confederation starship, they take advantage of the ship's information database to find a way home. As Riff puts it, "It's like the Internet."  
        **Torg:** Hey, there's nothing in here but pornography and fan sites for some show called "The Bleck-Files!" This is nothing like our Internet!
        
    -   "The Storm Breaker Saga", "Last Call":
        
        **Riff:** What? These aren't owls! They're breasts! Torg, get this smut off the screen and go back to "The Wings of America."

    Web Original 

-   OnlyFans once had an advertising campaign on Facebook inviting fitness instructors, cooking show hosts, and other non-pornographic content creators to host their videos on the site. In theory, anyone can make use of OF, and the company has never marketed themselves as a host for adult entertainment. But the reality is that OF and sites like it have a reputation for one specific use, as the snarky comments left on the Facebook ads pointed out. It all came to a head in 2021 when OF announced that they would be banning pornographic content from the platform altogether. Since porn constitutes the vast majority of its business, the backlash was as swift as it was predictable, and within a week of the announcement (the ban hadn't even gone into effect yet), OF changed course and announced that porn performers could stay after all. By contrast, OF's biggest competitor JustForFans has _always_ been proud of its status as a porn site and announced that they would happily take any performers ditched by OF.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   The SCP Foundation has SCP-335, which is the entire contents of the internet stored on 150 3.5″ floppy disks. Disks 1–12 contain nothing but porn. To give some perspective, Wikipedia only takes up one disk. (Wikipedia is mostly text, text is much smaller than images or video.)
-   At least one story on Not Always Right highlights a person who steadfastly believes that the Internet contains _only_ porn and pedophiles... and nothing else.
-   In this _Texts from Superheroes_ exchange, Vision says that he's picked Christmas gifts for his fellow Avengers by accessing their browser histories. Captain America gets a box set of the 1942 World Series; the rest get "sex stuff."
-   This Very Wiki's Family Friendly policy notes that "Readers who are wondering what a naked person might look like can just check out the rest of the Internet."
-   In _Three Worlds Collide_, porn is for the Internet.

    Web Videos 

-   _Atop the Fourth Wall_: Linkara has mentioned this trope a few times, notably as a joke reason why he wouldn't want to pay the overpriced online prices and shipping fees for a hardcover of Alan Moore's _Lost Girls_, and why he feels Frank Miller's "News in the Nude" and its real-life equivalent, _Naked News_, hold no appeal.
-   _Bad Creepypasta_: the riffers mocked the protagonist of _I HATE YOU_ for using newly acquired computer to pirate pornography, and suggested the protagonist of _A Chao's Demise_ to watch internet porn for eagerly waiting for his friend to give him a bootleg copy of _Sonic Adventure 2: Battle_.
-   CollegeHumor parodied this in Porn Site Strip Club, showing some of the pitfalls of online porn. Among other things, age verification being a joke in actually preventing access to teenagers, "free" previews being anything but, and annoying pop-up ads.
-   In Cracked.com's series _Agents of Cracked_, there was an entire episode about Michael Swaim discovering the internet. Upon his first Google Search, he invoked this trope.
    
    **Swaim:** I typed in **'porn**' — and porn came up! I typed in **'breakfast**' — and porn came up!
    
-   _Jonathan Pie_ describes mobile internet as filling the air around us with invisible tits and balls
-   During Noah Antwiler's commentary for his review of _The Clones of Bruce Lee_, he notes that the film is not really worth the viewer's time (he notes he cut the film down to the funny bits in his review) and after Lampshading the possibility that his fans would be "lured by \[his\] promise of titties", he then points out that there are easier methods of finding Asian porn than locating a bootleg copy of the film.
-   Projekt Melody is a Virtual Youtuber whose _very existence_ is the result of this trope. Being infected with a "sexy porn virus" back when she was a simple mail-sorting AI. Considering all of this and her "other job", she also unsurprisingly subscribes to this belief, claiming "The internet is amazing!".
-   _Suburban Knights_: The enthusiastic support for this premise by the entirety of Team 1 bites them in the butt when they need to get their information off someone who a) has a strong belief in the importance of purity of heart, and b) has been trapped in a book since the days of DARPANet.
-   Deepdata 1's #7 answer in _Ten Words of Wisdom_ was "The ancient humans needed a place to hide their porn, too."
-   Joel of Vinesauce fame has a story about when he was lured by software claiming to be a "desktop stripper". ("Oh my God, there's boobs! _Boobs!_") It turns out that the software was, in Joel's words, "a two-frame, 24x24 pixel GIF of a woman having a seizure." And it seemed to be malware too, because he was unable to uninstall it, forcing him to get his dad to fix the problem. Being a child at the time, Joel got a pretty good scolding out of it:
    
    **Joel's dad:** "Joel? Joel?? Did you download boobs again, Joel?"  
    **Joel:** "N-No Dad, no no—"  
    **Joel's dad:** "Joel? JOEL??!"

-   In the documentary made to celebrate 15 Years of Rooster Teeth, Burnie Burns shows he knows the trope pretty well:

    Western Animation 

-   In _The Amazing World of Gumball_ episode "The Shell", Gumball accidentally bursts into Banana Joe's room and sees him watching a video of an orange getting peeled. Considering that Banana Joe is, well, a banana, it should be pretty obvious what that video was meant to represent. The fact that he also has a box of tissues next to him doesn't really help.
-   _American Dad!_: Steve tries to do research on fossils, but expects to run into porn in the process.
    
    **Steve:** "Tyrannosaurus Rex; real. Babe-osaurus Rex; porn. A symposium on the Pangea theory of the Permian Extin — WOW, THAT IS SOME NASTY PORN!!!"
    
-   In the _Animaniacs (2020)_ segment "Of Mice and Memes", Pinky seems to believe this. When Brain asks Pinky whether he knows what most humans use the internet for, Pinky replies that he does but doesn't think he can say it. Brain then clarifies that "surprisingly", its primary use _isn't_ what Pinky was thinking of, but for funny pictures and viral videos of animals.

-   _Futurama_:
    -   Roughly the first three minutes of "A Bicyclops Built for Two" is devoted to the subject, with porn sites and dirty chat rooms galore in a Metaverse version of the Internet. Zoidberg is unimpressed... until he sees "Hot Sardine on Mackerel Action".
        
        **Fry:** I didn't think it was possible, but thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?
        
    -   In the episode "A Big Piece of Garbage", the crew watches a documentary about pollution:
        
        **Fry:** You got that on the Internet? In my day the Internet was only used for pornography.  
        **Professor Farnsworth:** Actually, that's still true.  
        **Woman in video:** Now that the, uh, garbage is in space, doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions.  
        **Man in video:** With gusto.
        
    -   And in _Bender's Big Score_, Bender receives a spam email claiming that he could make money from downloading porn. When he clicks on it, he's infected with a total obedience virus. (Of course, he's lucky he only got hit with a total obedience virus.)
-   In the _Gravity Falls_ episode "Into the Bunker", Mabel makes a joke about Dipper's web history, implying this. Bill's reddit AMA mentions that whatever Dipper was looking at involves "a lot of redheads", further implying that Dipper was specifically looking up girls who resembled his crush Wendy. "You're not over her at all" indeed...
    
    **Soos:** Yeah, this room is way creepy.
    
    **Mabel:** Not as creepy as Dipper's internet history! Hey-o!
    
-   In _The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy_ Grim once misspelled the URL on a website meant to summon an ancient snake god by one letter, resulting in an accidental visit to a site which started making animalistic yowling noises while Grim tried to block the kids from seeing it.

-   An early episode of _King of the Hill_ had Boomhauer talking about dang ol' internet:
    
    **Boomhauer:** Yeah man, I tell ya what, man. That dang ol' internet, man. You just go on there and point and click. Talk about W-W-dot-W-com. An' lotsa nekkid chicks on there, man. Click. Click. Click. Click. Click. It's real easy, man.

-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   In "I Am Furious Yellow", Bart has created a No Celebrities Were Harmed cartoon about Homer, which is highly popular, but not anywhere near as popular as certain other content:
        
        **Carl:** You're the Internet's number one non-porno site.  
        **Lenny:** Which means you're ten trillionth overall.
        
    -   From "Faith Off":
        
        **Geek:** I invented a program that downloads porn off the internet one million times faster.  
        **Marge:** Does anyone need that much porn?  
        **Homer:** _\[drooling\]_ One million times...
        
    -   In "The Great Wife Hope":

Just as it gets revealing, a popup for Homer's internet service appears, leading Comic Book Guy to remark: "Hmm... the Internet King. I wonder if he can provide faster nudity." and then goes to Homer's house to upgrade his connection.
-   _South Park_ had an episode where everyone's Internet went down, plunging the nation into chaos (conditions literally got as desperate as the 1930s Dust Bowl, and everything shifted to black and white). In the men's case (particularly Randy Marsh), the other problems were compounded by porn withdrawal (After internet porn, they couldn't go back to _Playboy_). One group created an "Internet Porn Simulator" by lowering hastily drawn stick figure pictures into an empty monitor casing. Further expanded on in The Movie, when Stan innocently (no, really) asks Kyle to look up "clitoris", without knowing it's a sex organ, and they get 8 billion hits. Including one of Cartman's mom, of course.
-   _Superjail!_: In "Superfail!", Jared takes charge of Superjail after accidentally knocking out the warden and implements his previously-rejected plan for a computer lab. He intended for it to be used for educational purposes, but to his disappointment (and to the surprise of what should be no one in the audience), the inmates are only interested in porn. Even Alice and Jailbot get in on the action. One would think that Jared would know of filtering software.
