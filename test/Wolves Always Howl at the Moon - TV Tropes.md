_"Listen in awe and you'll hear him..._  
_Bark at the moon."_

In almost any work of fiction that features wolves, werewolves, or coyotes, the canine beasts will almost always be showing howling to the moon at night. On occasion this trope is applied to domestic dogs as well as their wild counterparts.

The howl at the moon is often used to show the power and mystery of the wolves. It also strays into a case of not doing the research because one, wolves howl to communicate, and two, wolves howl just as much during the day as at night.

This trope is often combined with Clifftop Caterwauling to provide atmosphere to a scene. Bonus points if the wolf is silhouetted against the moon.

If the howler is a werewolf, this usually occurs right after they transform.

Spooky Animal Sounds, which are used to add to a creepy atmosphere, may involve howling wolves. Other creatures are occasionally shown howling at the moon, but wolves and werewolves are by far the most common.

See also Howl of Sorrow, for when a howl is used emotionally.

-   Subverted in _Safe Havens_. Dogs aren't howling at the moon. They're howling at _Mars_. Eons ago, the Genius Loci Mars and Theia were close to each other in the emotional sense, so much so that Theia tried to jump out of Earth's orbit and into Mars's, but miscalculated and crashed into Earth. Some of Theia's sentience still exists on Earth, along with its desire to join Mars, and when dogs got domesticated they were able to hear the Earth begging for spaceflight.
