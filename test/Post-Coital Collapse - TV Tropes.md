_"My God, I haven't been fucked like that since grade school."_

A scene begins, focusing on bed or surface when suddenly one or more characters collapse into it, being exhausted, panting for air, drenched in sweat, and with their hair in disarray, clearly implying they had just finished having sex. This is done to tastefully show two characters have just been intimate without actually having to show the act, and the scene will move on to the characters having some kind of pillow talk, such as wondering Did the Earth Move for You, Too?, proclaiming That Didn't Happen or gushing about how amazing their partner just is or how fast it was.

Sometimes this is preceded by an Establishing Shot of the outside building, where we hear the grunts and moans of the couple, before the camera cuts inside. A common, more risque variation is to briefly show one character on top of another before they roll off and collapse into bed. A woman can do a backward Hair Flip while arching her spine before rolling off her lover, as a tasteful way to insinuate she has reached her climax.

Since this is commonly done in an effort to make a suggestive situation tamer, camera tricks are often used as to hide any actual nudity, with the collapsing characters being shown only from the shoulders up or under a Modesty Bedsheet. If they collapse on their stomach, Toplessness from the Back may also apply. Sometimes the characters may also simply be more dressed than expected for the act.

This is the inverse of a Sexy Discretion Shot where a scene ends with characters starting to get intimate, although it can sometimes _follow_ a Sexy Discretion Shot. It can also be what follows after an Instant Seduction. See Destructo-Nookie for when the coupling causes objects _around_ the couple to collapse.
