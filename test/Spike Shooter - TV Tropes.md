He's got a powerful point to make.

Spikes of Doom are always painful, especially if mobile. If one were able to use those spikes as weapons, they would be extremely deadly.

This is the Spike Shooter, someone capable of having spikes come out of his body, and sometimes able to fire them. The character also needs to have some Required Secondary Powers, one of them being the spikes not tearing his skin in the process. Or a Healing Factor to fix up the damage, alternately.

An Ice Person or someone who is Dishing Out Dirt can mimic this ability, with icicles or stalagmites.

This includes other small body parts that can be fired at opponents to do damage, such as spines, quills, needles, stingers, thorns and so on. The Cactus Person will often have the ability to launch its thorns in this manner. Porcupines may also be depicted as shooting out their quills, despite the fact that porcupines cannot actually do this in real life.

If the spikes in question are nails, that's Nail 'Em. Feather Flechettes and Flechette Storm are closely related tropes. Not to be confused with the Pile Bunker, in which the spike is shot out but as a piston instead of a projectile.

    Real Life 

-   Cone snails shoot modified radular teeth to inject venom in their prey. Then a cone pulls on the ejected tooth via a ligament to reel in the paralyzed prey.
-   Averted with the porcupine. It was believed that it could project its quills, but is incapable of doing so. It is, however, capable of lashing out with its tail and leaving quills embedded in an enemy's skin, which makes it _look_ like it is doing this at close-range.
-   When threatened, tarantulas rub their hind legs over their abdomen, sending up a cloud of urticating hairs covered in microscopic barbs that irritate predators' skin and respiratory tracts; they regenerate such shed hair (along with any sustained external injuries) the next time they moult. Elderly tarantulas often have bald abdomens because they've used up their hairs in this way, and old age causes their moulting process to be increasingly infrequent.
-   To other humans unfamiliar with the technology, the very first Stone Age people to make use of javelins, bows, or blowguns for hunting probably _seemed_ like this trope.
