This trope is when a character has relations with his boss's lover. If a man in an office setting ain't sleeping with the Sexy Secretary, then he's probably sleeping with the Boss's Wife. Contrary to Sleeping with the Boss him/herself, which is usually performed by those intent on Sleeping Their Way to the Top, an underling betrays his boss's trust with infidelity. Sometimes, it is brought upon by the guy hating his boss and doing it out of spite, or being seduced by the Femme Fatale wife.

In most cases, it ends with a fatal love triangle between the three, either resulting in the boss's or the employee's death (sometimes, albeit more rarely, the wife's). If the underling is lucky, he will merely be Reassigned to Antarctica or fired, but if the boss is an outright villain, expect a prompt serving of You Have Failed Me if he finds out. If the boss is not quite so overt, an Uriah Gambit is also likely. However, if the boss ends up meeting an unfortunate end, the underling instead might take his job position along with his wife.
