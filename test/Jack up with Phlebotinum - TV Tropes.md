Bob is someone with certain... lusts in life. It may be something as simple as loving to eat a lot, or something as self-destructive as heroin. The point is, he's jonesing, and he's jonesing bad. And suddenly, he finds a stash of what appears to be the good stuff! Jackpot! Bob then consumes or shoots up the stuff...

...Only to suddenly mutate into a hideous monster, melt into a pile of goo or keel over dead!

Poor Bob: instead of the good stuff, the stuff he consumed was actually some sort of harmful substance or Applied Phlebotinum, and he has now become either a casualty of some bizarre effect or something less than human. Either way, Bob himself has now become an integral part of the plot somehow. Perhaps his demise sets events in motion that drive the plot, or perhaps he becomes some sort of monster and is now the antagonist. Bottom line is he _really_ shouldn't have done the stuff.

This trope involves the poor fellow imbibing the nasty stuff by accident. If it was deliberately caused by someone else, it's Tampering with Food and Drink or Slipping a Mickey. It also differs because those usually involve more mundane substances, while this trope involves taking some VERY bad shit.

Fantastical or exaggerated subtrope of Drugs Are Bad. Compare Mushroom Samba, where the character accidentally imbibes something that blows his brain instead of his body.

-   In _Lucifer_, demonic succubus Lady Lys gets a hold of Christopher Rudd, one of Hell's damned, as her personal plaything. Rudd, at first relieved he's being spared the suffering he's endured for centuries, comes to resent the situation, since he believes himself damned worse for consorting with demons than for paying penance. Lys, like many of Hell's denizens, is addicted to Pain(capital P), which is the distilled essence of the souls suffering in Hell. Rudd, however, distills ACTUAL Pain, pain as humans feel it, and gives it to Lys. When Lys imbibes it, she feels the actual pain of the souls she's tortured and played with, making her feel remorse and shame for her past actions. The experience turns her from a hedonistic slut into a broken, emotional wreck.

    Real Life 

-   Cats perceive antifreeze as sweet and tasty; it quickly kills them via liver damage in very low doses.
    -   Ethylene glycol, the main ingredient in some brands of antifreeze, also tastes sweet to humans and a number of other species and is no less poisonous than it is for cats. There have been cases of children, pets, livestock, and wild animals drinking antifreeze unwittingly, as well as it being used to deliberately poison people. To cut down on the accidental deaths and homicides, many manufacturers add a bittering agent to ethylene-glycol-based antifreeze, which eight US states require by law.

-   Often happens with methanol. This substance looks like ethanol, smells like ethanol, tastes like ethanol and even produces a buzz like ethanol. But if you're lucky, it'll burn your eyes from inside for good, and if you're unlucky, it'll kill you.
    -   Russians have devised a folk way to tell methanol from ethanol. You make a small spiral out of copper wire, heat it with a cigarette lighter and drench in the suspicious alcohol. If you smell "morgue" (formaldehyde gas, a very characteristic "stinging" smell), it's the deadly stuff.
-   The story goes that a soldier at an isolated Russian army base had the good fortune to discover two barrels of white powder, and before long the entire base was snorting lines of the stuff, sprinkling on their food, smoking it, etc. Before long, the effects of _thallium poisoning_ showed up.
