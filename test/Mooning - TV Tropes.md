You call me a cheeky monkey.

**Woman:** What are you doing?!  
**Principal Lewis:** Showing you my butt. ...What? You thought those were ding-dong prices?! _\[laughs\]_ Na-ah, nah, nah.

Ah, yes, the time-honored tradition of pulling down one's pants and displaying one's buttocks. While the term "mooning" has been in the English language for over 400 years, it wasn't until the late 1960s that it gained its modern slang usage.

Mooning is typically done for sheer, pointless defiance, to taunt an enemy, or simply for laughs. The general idea is to do it within full view of people who don't expect or want to see a pair of bare buttocks. Cheek Copy is a cousin of this trope that's less direct and can have the perpetrator be a safe distance from the victim with the same net result.

While this is often a male-oriented behavior, it's not unheard of for a woman to do the same. Of course, when a woman does this, it's often more for titillation than shock or offense.

Performing the act from the window of a moving car is perhaps the most common form in modern America. This solves the problem of a quick getaway while one's pants are undone. A popular variant is the "pressed ham", wherein the mooner shoves his bare cheeks up against the glass of a closed window.

In more unfortunate situations, the act of mooning may be followed by an Ass Shove.

While in fiction this is usually portrayed as harmless with no serious consequences (probably except for embarrassment), in Real Life, many jurisdictions will consider this actually illegal if done in public, with charges of public indecency or even second degree sexual assault.

        -   While fighting members of the Interregnum during their final showdown, he would moon them in retaliation for driving his Kitsune mother to fake her death in order to protect herself and her hybrid son from persecution.
        -   He also does this to arrogant, traditionalist deities who try molding him into a 'proper' deity. Whenever they tried to convince him to wear divine regalia or barding instead of going around naked, his response was to moon them. He would moon a deity who tried making a visiting Prince Caerulus Melodia drop his southern accent, and would suggest using this method to deal with those who try making him act 'proper', something Caerulus would take to heart once he went back to Equestria.
            
            **Azamuku:** Your Highness, sometimes you'll meet gods who think they know how you should act, and tell you things you don't want to hear. So when things get too much and they won't stop no matter what you say, just turn around and show them your rear!
            
    -   Prince Caerulus Melodia himself mooned someone in one incident; he grew annoyed with a traditionalist deity who tried making him drop his southern Ponyland accent so he could speak in a proper and refined way befitting of a divine sovereign. When said deity wouldn't stop bothering him, Caerulus proceeded to retaliate by mooning them, something Azamuku taught him after befriending the divine Alicorn-Kitsune hybrid in Neighpon. This caused his twin brother Bossa Nova/Prince Rubeus and other friends who were nearby when it happened to collapse into laughter.

He's not trying to insult anyone though—the castor oil lubricant used in the airplane engine is giving him the runs. Unfortunately, this means the dastardly Hun literally catches him with his pants down.
    
    "Well now's not the time to take a SHIT!" yelled Belsworth, as a blue Fokker D.VII swooped out of the sun like a deadly hawk.
    
-   _Plan 7 of 9 from Outer Space_. Our introduction to our bold space hero Captain Proton has him admiring the radiant surface of the moon, which turns out to be a Sex Bot giving him a panty shot.
-   During chapter 6 of _Sugar Rush: Rival Racing_, Petty Capop-Rock moons Swizzle and Minty as a distraction when they race against him and his brother.

-   During the 82nd Hunger Games of _Tales of the Hunger Games_, Linnet and her district partner moons the entire crowd during the tribute parade.

-   One scene in _The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists_ has the Pirate Captain's crew briefly showing off tattoos of their captain, with the Surprisingly Curvaceous Pirate revealing her tattoo by baring her ass.

Her long skirt gets disarrayed in the process, causing her to walk away toward the horizon with one ass cheek showing. Later in the movie, a security camera catches her sleepwalking nude.

    Literature 

-   In the _Belisarius Series_, the Axumites do this to mock Venandakatra during the celebration of Shakuntala's wedding. They rotate through the platform facing Venandakatra three times, because the crowd loves the sight of four hundred bare black asses hanging over the battlements to taunt Malwa.
-   _The Canterbury Tales_: Alison moons her unsuccessful suitor Absolon through a window in the dark in "The Miller's Tale"... while leading him to believe she's sticking her face out the window for a kiss.

-   In Graham Oakley's children's book _The Church Mice and the Moon_ a small camera-carrying rocket to the moon goes astray and ends up in the church instead. At the press conference a politician announces pompously, "Ladies and Gentleman, the moon!" not realising the rocket's camera is actually showing a member of the church choir bending over while taking off their robe.
-   An odd example occurs in L. Frank Baum's _Wizard of Oz_ books, although this is not the fault of author Baum, but of illustrator John R. Neill. This artist had an apparent fetish for including bizarre non sequiturial images in the drawings he made to accompany Baum's stories. In _The Scarecrow of Oz_, whose first act follows a boat trip gone wrong a la _Gilligan's Island_, Neill chose to pepper the adventure with gratuitous scenes of an attractive, well-built, not-quite-human lady in the water, with fins on her arms (a la Aquaman) and on the sides of her head (like Flash wings or Catwoman ears). No such character is ever mentioned in Baum's text. In the full-page illustration preceding chapter one, this mermaid/nereid/selkie/whatever-she-is is riding a whitewater wave which strategically covers her lower body, except for a "window" which gives us an unobstructed view of her bare buttocks.
-   _Dave Barry's Guide to Guys_:
    -   According to him, one of the immature activities which constitute the "business meetings" of the Arcola Broom Corn Festival involves
        
        a man climbing up a ladder and, using props, presenting a dramatic rendition of a song while the Rangers attempt to guess the title, which is not difficult because the song always involves the word "moon"
        
    -   In the same book, he also states that mooning is one of the two things invented by guys, the other being Pez.
-   According to the _Discworld Fools' Guild Diary_, the battle clowns of Uberwald used to wear armour everywhere except their backside. The practice of displaying their scars was named after the town they were based in: Müning.
-   In the _National Lampoon's High School Yearbook Parody_, there is a picture with the caption "Thanks to parents for lending their cars to transport prom balloons." Except it's not balloons we see pressed against the window of the car.
    -   The cover of the same book has three cheerleaders performing a synchronized routine, with their skirts flipping up in motion. While two of the girls are wearing modest bathing suits/leotards, the third lady is commando. While we have a view of her butt, the characters on the audience benches react in open mouth shock to the implied sight of her reproductive region. Whether the woman is exposing herself deliberately or merely forgot to put on her undies that morning is open to interpretation, as this standalone image does not illustrate any of the stories inside. (Some reprint editions strategically place a title bar over the lady's butt on the cover, yet provide the unobstructed view within the book's interior.)
-   Bobby is forced to do this as part of his hazing by Rumson and his gang in _One Fat Summer_. Needless to say, Bobby doesn't find it fun at all.
    
    "Lookit that can!"  
    "There's two moons tonight!"

-   In the "Take Me to the Ball Game" episode of _Good Luck Charlie_, Uncle Mel moons the baseball players and is shown on the Jumbo screen. Of course, Teddy and Ivy cover him up with foam fingers, but don't forget this is a Disney Channel show! Later:

-   On _Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide_, Ned moons Cookie in "Vampires, Werewolves, Ghouls and Ghosts" to transform him into a werewolf.
-   _Night Court_ had a rare female version where Billie pulled her skirt up and mooned out the window of Harry's chamber. The episode ended with quite a few people in the building across from Harry's office mooning back.
    
    **Bull:** There are eight million stories in the naked city. _(the others glare at him)_ Somebody had to say it!

-   Penny Marshall had a cameo in the _Taxi_ episode "Louie Moves Uptown", where she tries to get a nice apartment.

    Music 

-   A popular children's song is the Gold Rush era folk-song "Sweet Betsy From Pike," which tells the story of the a woman and her boyfriend/husband Ike traveling to California. They survive numerous hardships, almost starve, fend off hostile Indians, and successfully arrive to dig for their fortune. Oh, yes, and along the way: "Out on the prairie one bright starry night/They broke the whiskey and Betsy got tight./She sang and she shouted and danced o'er the plain/And showed her bare arse to the whole wagon train." How this affected Betsy's relations with her wagon train neighbors, whom she would presumably have to see every day, knowing that all of them had witnessed her public partial nudity when she was in a drunken foolish state, and whether she ever lived it down, are anyone's guess. The song never mentions the incident again, and the verse can be excised without changing anything else. One famous version, recorded by Burl Ives, changes the final line to the nebulous "and made a great show for the whole wagon train."
