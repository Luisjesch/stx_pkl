He shouldn't have watched a scary movie before bedtime.

Dreams are weird. If a person can imagine it, they can dream it, no matter how surreal, out-of-character, or frightening it may be. With the endless possibilities that exist, occasionally a creator would want to take full advantage of it, and have an entire episode dedicated to exploring the dreams of one or more characters.

While All Just a Dream sets this as a surprise, these episodes play no tricks- the audience knows they're in for a story about a dream, and so the story can be as surreal and strange as can be without breaking the suspension of disbelief or tipping off the audience to any twists. A character may in fact be aware that they're dreaming, while still victim to the oddities of dreamworld. The dream could also be a nightmare, most likely leading to An Aesop about facing one's fears, or even a particularly odd day-dream or hallucination. Sometimes, these dreams may manifest as a Shared Dream between all the characters.

To qualify, this part of a work must be devoted to or heavily reliant on the dream aspect; otherwise, it's just a Dream Sequence.

Similar to All Just a Dream and the typical Dream Sequence, this could possibly end in the character asking, Or Was It a Dream? This is not to be confused with an episode the fanbase had been dreaming of for a while, a la And the Fandom Rejoiced. Finally, see also Fever Dream Episode, which is this trope meets Sick Episode, and Adventures In Coma Land. Due to the bizarre nature of dreams it shouldn't be much of a surprise that this often overlaps with Bizarro Episode.
