**Helen:** It's just that sometimes you judge people's behavior by a pretty rigid set of standards. Not everyone can live up to them.  
**Daria:** That's what's wrong with the world.  
**Helen:** Not even _you_ live up to them all the time.

This character has a world-weary disdain for _everyone_, themselves included. They might see themselves as the Only Sane Man, but only in the sense that they're _maybe one_ full notch above everyone else while still falling miles short of where they believe everyone should be. They typically suffer from a healthy dose of Intelligence Equals Isolation, and are the type to stand aside at parties and quietly drink beer while making biting quips about the idiocy that surrounds them. They also often wear black, though this isn't a prerequisite.

Their peers often regard them as a mild Jerkass; their sympathizers see their withdrawal from society as a quiet personal stand against idiocy. The Alpha Bitch and Jerk Jock are often their mortal enemies, but occasionally they enter the circle of the Big Man on Campus, usually as the resident "cool guy" who reminds him not to be a self-satisfied twit (while he teaches them to be less haughty and just enjoy life).

The key difference between this trope and a Deadpan Snarker, Smug Snake, or a plain old jerkass is that the Snark Knight holds _themselves_ to their own impossibly high standards. This means that they will criticize themselves as often as they roll their eyes at others, and with just as much vitriol. And because of these high standards, you can bet they won't be Easily Impressed.

Sometimes the Snark Knight ends up as a Sidekick or one-third of a Power Trio with the main protagonist, providing the role of the cynical commentator and Meta Guy. Expect less personal Angst and more Plucky Comic Relief in these cases. An older and more experienced Snark Knight often steps into the Mentor in Sour Armor role.

Contrast Loners Are Freaks. Often the opposite of the Stepford Smiler. If their sarcasm is revealed to be a similar mask, they're a Stepford Snarker. See also Knight in Sour Armor.

## Examples:

    open/close all folders 

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Black Clover_ gives us Zora. Whether you're an ally or enemy, start any level of conversation with him and he'll definitely have a nice serving of sharply worded insults and/or critique ready for you. Given his disillusionment with the Magic Knights and how many of them operate, he has a very dreary and realistic outlook on the world despite being a Magic Knight himself and quips at anything he can. He particularly loves doing this to his opponents after he's beaten them. He'll give them a potent "Reason You Suck" Speech in regards to why they lost or why they should have done better. And he does not exempt _himself_ from the snark. After criticizing everyone else at the end of a Royal Knights match, he then criticizes himself for not having more faith in his comrades.

-   Chisame of _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_, though her snarks don't tend to have as much power over the other characters as those of some other Snark Knights on this list.

-   _Haruhi Suzumiya_: Kyon is this trope in spades. Most of his dialogue revolves around him snarking about how the world literally revolves around Haruhi's whims.

-   Haruko Hasegawa of _Moyashimon_ is a dedicated microbiology postgrad with an acid tongue. She delivers a lecture on the validity of "sterilising" products when she sees Oikawa's compulsive disinfecting. Sawaki's supernatural ability to see and interact with (to him) cute microbes triggers a minor meltdown.
-   In _...Virgin Love_, Kaoru's default mode is disdain, which includes a disdain for himself whenever he fails to live up to his own standards.
-   _Bleach_: Ryuuken Ishida appears to be a bitterly sarcastic individual who is hypercritical of his son's desire and ability to be a Quincy, causing the pair to dissolve into Snark-to-Snark Combat whenever they're in the same room together. Isshin Kurosaki, who knows Ryuuken's secret, implies that Ryuuken is trying to help his son in some very specific way. Flashbacks revealing the beginning of Ryuuken's problems with Quincies show no one in the world is a harsher critic of Ryuuken than Ryuuken himself. He's clearly a Stepford Snarker, but the link between the start of his problems and his current situation has yet to be fully revealed.
-   Sesshomaru from _Inuyasha_ really comes across as this, with his condescending yet brutally honest attitude.

    Comic Books 

-   Enid Coleslaw (and possibly Rebecca Doppelmeyer) from _Ghost World_.
-   Kim Pine ruthlessly snarks about everything in both the comic and film version of _Scott Pilgrim_. Julie as well, before being Flanderized into a Jerkass.
-   Wolverine is this in spades often. Wolvie, for the longest time, rivaled the Hulk for "angriest character" in Marvel; he would make snarky or snide remarks to just about everyone, though he does have a soft spot for kids, and generally got angry at the drop of the hat. But the person he hates the most is himself. It's been suggested that one of the biggest reasons he hates Sabretooth so deeply is because he sees too much of himself in Victor - what Wolverine himself could become if he lost all his morals and let "The Animal" take over.
-   Batman is this, Depending on the Writer. He's generally shown being a jerk to other heroes, but he allows himself few joys in life and does his best to keep everyone at arm's length. It's implied that one reason he's so proud of Dick Grayson aside from Dick being his oldest "child" is that Dick has surpassed both himself and Superman as a hero.
-   Far more often, Batman's butler Alfred is the Snark Knight when interacting with the Dark Knight.

    Comic Strips 

-   Huey from _The Boondocks_, whose high standards for everything cause him tons of stress.
-   Garfield is perhaps the most well-known example. In fact, "fat", lazy", and "cynical" are the three adjectives that are usually tossed about when people discuss him.
-   _Dilbert_ portrays a World of Snark where Dogbert is the greatest snarker of them all.
-   In _Pretending You Care: The Retail Employee Handbook_, one of the co-worker archetypes you can expect to work with fits this to a T and then some, known as "The Curmudgeon". They're described as an employee who has worked there for so long and dealt with the crap that comes with retail like idiotic bosses, awful customers, and the overall inanity of it so much that they've basically become a mouthy, miserable, snarky jackass to everyone. The book cautions against spending time around them as they are _always_ jerks even to the customers and coworkers they are dealing with don't deserve it but acknowledges that they generally are _very_ competent at the ins and outs of the job (specifically at _avoiding_ the lousier aspects of the job) and thus are good to study from afar.

    Fan Works 

-   In _Have Faith_, a series of crossover fanfics by Mediancat, Faith of _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ is one, because _she really is Daria Morgendorffer_. This is a rare crossover by way of Multiple Personality Disorder.
-   Green Shield/Tara Strong of _DC Nation_; her genius-level IQ, photographic memory and dedication to her medical studies fulfill the genius requirement and the ridiculously high standards. She's also quicker with the snark than she is with her bow.
-   The _Reading Rainbowverse_ has Carrot Top, recovering alcoholic and general cynic.
-   Ever since he regenerates from a mild-mannered, slightly eccentric old man into a steely-eyed adventurer, the Doctor from _The Road to Shalka_ snarks at stupid humans, including his companions, incessantly. He is, however, quite quick to admit his own mistakes. This is probably best showcased in _Children of the Sanctum_, where he's companionless, but putting the moves on Angela - the Doctor is visibly disappointed in her when the prospective companion doesn't own up to something she's done, but just as visibly proud when she saves the day. His Brutal Honesty is part of why Angela finally decides to ditch her job and leave with the Doctor - he treats her as an equal.
-   _Mega Man Recut_ has Proto Man, who's more this than he is in the cartoon.

    Films — Animation 

-   Megara from Disney's _Hercules_. She later becomes a Defrosting Ice Queen. She's also voiced by the same actress who voices Rin in the English dub of _Spirited Away_. Coincidence? We think not.
    -   Hades is an interesting example, as his armour of snark goes hand in hand with his Hair-Trigger Temper.
-   Hiccup in _How to Train Your Dragon_ takes advantage of his position at the bottom of the pecking order to dish out some beautiful snark.
    
    **Hiccup:** Thank you for nothing, you useless reptile.
    
-   _Zootopia_: Chief Bogo is short-tempered, highly critical, and understands that the world is broken. At the same time, he clearly holds himself to very high standards, and anyone meeting those standards in turn will earn his deepest respect because he believes the world needs good cops.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   Randal Graves from _The View Askewniverse_, summed up by this line.
    
    **Randal:** That guy's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
    
-   Kat Stratford from _10 Things I Hate About You_. Or in her words...
    
    "I'm not hostile, I'm annoyed."
    
-   Juno, who seems to get snarkier as her pregnancy goes along.

-   Veronica Sawyer in _Heathers_, to a certain degree. It seems the uncool kids, like Betty Finn and Martha Dumptruck, manage to get the nicer ends of her Sugar-and-Ice Personality act. Everyone else is fair game.
-   Janis Ian from _Mean Girls_. No one is safe from her razor-sharp snark, except maybe her BFF Damien.

-   Kim Pine from _Scott Pilgrim vs. The World_. Almost everything she says is an insult, mostly to Scott. Even her _facial expressions_ are snarky.

-   Alfred Pennyworth in _Batman Returns_ - making him a Snark Knight to the Dark Knight!
-   _Spider-Man Trilogy_: While not making as many jokes as other versions of the character, he does make a few in each movie at his opponents' expense.
-   Obi-Wan Kenobi from _Star Wars_ is a Jedi Snark-Knight, especially when he was younger.
    
    **Obi-Wan:** I was beginning to wonder whether you'd got my message.  
    **Anakin:** We transmitted the message to Coruscant like you requested. Then we decided to come and rescue you.  
    **Obi-Wan:** _\[looking at the chains around their wrists while awaiting their public execution\]_ Good job.
    
-   Suki in _The Scribbler_ has suffered from Split Personality syndrome her entire life. As a result, when she's in "normal" mode, she pretty much runs on non-stop sarcasm. This does not endear her to the detective and police psychiatrist grilling her about a series of suspicious deaths at her high-rise halfway house.
-   Joy Gresham in _Shadowlands_ is this, although she softens a little over the course of the film.
    
    **Douglas:** _\[reading CS Lewis's inscription in his book\]_ "The magic never ends."  
    **Joy:** Well, if it does, sue him.
    
-   Kathryn Merteuil of _Cruel Intentions_ is a _very_ rare combination of this trope and Alpha Bitch. It definitely shatters the stereotype that all mean girls are stupid.
-   _Die Hard_: John McClane is a very good snarker, and many of his quips are at his own expense. For example, in _Die Hard with a Vengeance_, one character says he's two steps away from being an alcoholic, and John corrects him by holding up a finger and mouthing, "One step."

    Literature 

-   The detective from _Put the Sepia On_ lives off of this. A couple of his supporting cast members do, too.

-   Valkyrie Cain in _Skulduggery Pleasant_. Overlaps with Little Miss Snarker.
-   Lily in _The Princess Diaries_ (not as much so in the movies).
-   _Discworld_
    -   Susan Sto Helit in the novel _Soul Music_. In her later appearances, she's Taken a Level in Badass and become the Knight in Sour Armor.
    -   Adora Belle Dearhart.
        
        **Moist:** You think he's cynical?  
        **Adora:** Yes. As you suspect, that’s practically a professional opinion.
        

-   Bastille from _Alcatraz and the Evil Librarians_ is, in fact, a knight. With snark.
-   Greg Heffley from the _Diary of a Wimpy Kid_ series would qualify as a male Snark Knight, if not for the fact that he usually doesn't hold himself to his own standards. Heck, he even says that his only New Year's resolution is to come up with resolutions for other people, since he's the best person he knows.
-   Takeshi Kovacs often adopts a Snark Knight-like act when feeling particularly cynical; deep down, though, he's a Knight in Sour Armor.
-   Bernice Summerfield in the Doctor Who Expanded Universe:
    
    **Doctor:** You're a cynic.  
    **Benny:** No, I'm an idealist who's been wrong one too many times.
    
-   Christina Light in Henry James's first novel _Roderick Hudson_. Speaking to Rowland Mallet, she says:
    
    "I am a strange girl. To begin with, I am frightfully egotistical. Don't flatter yourself you have said anything very clever if you ever take it into your head to tell me so... I am tired to death of myself; I would give all I possess to get out of myself; but somehow, at the end, I find myself so vastly more interesting than nine-tenths of the people I meet."
    
-   Dominil finds herself firmly in Snark Knight territory in _Curse of the Wolfgirl_. Daniel _likes_ to think of himself as one, but he is too firmly mired in the chaos to be one.
-   The unnamed author in _"Sideshow", and Other Stories_ by Thomas Ligotti.
-   'Pilsner' in the Redfern Barrett sci-fi _Forget Yourself_ fits the bill, and as a result is strongly disliked by the central character.
-   Marvin the Paranoid Android of _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_.

-   _Pride and Prejudice_ has Mr. Bennet and his favorite daughter Elizabeth. Mr. Bennet deals with his ill-matched marriage by constantly Trolling his wife and laughing at his younger daughters, but when he realizes that this form of Parental Neglect contributed to Lydia's near-disgrace and Shotgun Wedding with Wickham, he admits and mocks his own folly. Elizabeth as well; she's bitterly amused by the irony of regretting the loss of Darcy when a few months ago she would have rejoiced to have him gone from her life.
-   _The Supervillainy Saga_ stars Gary Karkofsky, who is the titular and seemingly light-hearted supervillain. Then you realize he's carrying an immense amount of Bruce Wayne-meets-Peter Parker-sized baggage. His brother was killed by a '90s Anti-Hero, he was brainwashed by his superhero girlfriend to forget her, and he also killed his first man at age 14.
-   Jessica Darling is deeply unimpressed with most other people, while at the same time feeling like the world's biggest loser herself most of the time. Her commentary on herself and others is about equally scathing.
-   In the dark near-future military thriller _Victoria_, protagonist John Rumford is acerbic in his treatment of _everyone_, including those few exemplars who actually meet with his overall approval. He will usually make his one exception where his fellow revolutionist and sometime mentor Colonel Kraft is concerned, but even he is not totally immune.
-   _Carry On_: Baz gives out a good snark to everyone, and is a bit of a dark, intelligent character.
-   Daylen in _Shadow of the Conqueror_ has a viciously barbed tongue, but doesn't spare himself from his own judgment, either.

-   Sir Alanna of _Song of the Lioness_, first female knight of Tortall in 200 years, is infamously sharp-tongued and includes herself, her legend, and the king in her list of acceptable targets. Pretty much the only one she doesn't snark at is Kel as a girl, because she sees that she has enough on her plate, and she immediately rescinds that when Kel comes of age.
    
    **Alanna:** If I killed everyone who was stupid, I wouldn't have time to sleep.
    

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Game of Thrones_: Sandor Clegane has a fatalistic view of the world, expressed through either complaints or snarky zings.
-   _One Foot in the Grave_ gives us Victor Meldrew, the king of this trope.

-   In _Babylon 5_, Londo's first wife Timov falls into this. Even though she's constantly (and justifiably) berating him, he chooses to keep her over all his other wives. He's suspicious of all flattery, but he knows her contempt is genuine. What he doesn't know is that Timov is secretly charmed by that respect for her honesty.
-   _The Office_: Pam Beasley, as she says things that offend her and sometimes towards Michael.
-   _Parks and Recreation_
    -   April Ludgate the college intern is another prime example. Season 2 has April starting to get over it, though, beginning to distance herself from her irony-loving friends and getting more involved in the department. She still provides a healthy dose of snark, particularly towards Jerry, the office Butt-Monkey.
    -   April's sister Natalie.
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_:
    -   Odo started this way.
    -   Major (later Colonel, then eventually Commander) Kira Nerys was the heavy-handed embodiment of this trope, just like Ro Laren before her. Almost to a "Can't Argue With Bajorans" extent. The role was originally written to be Ro Laren, as was the character B'Elanna Torres in Star Trek: Voyager.
-   _Supernatural_ has Dean Winchester, who has endured a Trauma Conga Line, since he was four years old. Yet, he frequently manages to snark on the various monsters and demons he faces, even when he is clearly terrified. On the rare occasions when he's too scared to snark, you know the situation is deadly serious.

-   _DawsonsCreek_: Dru Valentine, a typical Jerkass Snark Knight with ties to the rich, has disdain for nearly everyone (particularly the rich people he's connected to) and is never without a scathing, observant quip to anyone in his general vicinity.
-   _Veronica Mars_:
    -   Veronica takes this role but unlike most, only after she's been pushed into it by her ostracization for standing by her father. Note her moral principles fall into a sense of justice and not letting the wealthy get away with crimes but she's loose on using deception to get her way. Such is the way of most Private Detective characters.
    -   Troubled, but Cute Logan also falls under this trope, especially after he and Veronica get back together on season 2.
-   _3rd Rock from the Sun_:
    -   August Leffler, Tommy's ex. August either went through character decay (or development; as a teenager, such a change in personality isn't unrealistic), becoming rather hypocritical and just liking to look down at everyone. Her initial appearance portrayed her as a more well-adjusted and pleasant person (At least, as well-adjusted as The Snark Knight can get).
    -   Tommy himself could be considered a male Snark Knight, although to a much lesser degree than August. Of course, if you were a veteran Information Officer assigned the cover identity of a teenager, you might be a bit snarky as well.
-   Kerry from _8 Simple Rules_ usually fits, though it can depend on the episode.
-   Naomi from the second generation of _Skins_ characters; arguably Jal has flashes of this in the first two seasons too.
-   The season 3 _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ episode "Earshot" has a character like this named Freddy Iverson.
-   _House_. If House weren't a genius diagnostician, he'd fall into Loners Are Freaks territory.
-   Kat Warbler from the short-lived sitcom _The Class (2006)_.
    
    "I'd rather have a bitter cake."  
    "You ARE a bitter cake."
    
-   In _Torchwood_, Owen is a textbook example.
-   _Degrassi_ rotates this trope around through the years. Ellie is the first notable example during her goth years, Jimmy gains this along with Disabled Snarker title, Clare being the latest holder of this title.
-   Toby Ziegler from _The West Wing_ — he's accurately described as "prickly" and "sad, angry and not warm," and he has a uniquely tense relationship with the president due to his constant frustration and disappointment at Bartlet's failure to fully live up to his genius, and his willingness to voice them.

-   _Doctor Who_: The Doctor has a very dark and twisted version of this in the Dream Lord, from _Amy's Choice_. Even as he traps the heroes in a dream and toys with them, he snipes at all of their character flaws, with particular venom reserved for the Doctor. He's actually an extension of the Doctor's psyche, particularly his darkness and self-loathing, which qualifies him for this trope.
    -   The Doctor identifies him because "No one in the universe hates me as much as you."
-   Dan from _Nathan Barley_ is a Deconstruction of the trope, penned by Charlie Brooker (himself arguably a Real Life example). He's a caustic depressive who writes withering articles about "the idiots" (who themselves respect him as "the Preacher Man"), growing more and more cutting and vicious as he falls in with them. However, when he's offered a job for a more reputable magazine, he realises he cannot write anything _but_ cheap sarcasm, and it's hinted that his self-deprecation forms a self-destructive cycle; the show offers him plenty of get-outs, but he never ends up taking them.
-   DS Barbara Havers of _The Inspector Lynley Mysteries_. That poor, dear girl.
-   _Stargate SG-1_: Daniel Jackson, especially in later seasons. If you had a backstory like his, you would be too.
-   Malcolm from _Malcolm in the Middle_ takes the cake. Always, _always_ snidely fuming at everyone and everything. A couple episodes try to tackle this directly (with him trying to suppress his desire to grumble and condescend for various reasons) but end up blowing up in his face (he gave himself an ulcer once by swallowing down too much snark).
-   Ryan King (played by Matthew Perry on _Go On_) is definitely a big example. He also is something of a Stepford Snarker.

-   Athos from the BBC's version of _The Musketeers_ is another potential poster boy for this trope.
    
    **Athos:** If you'd told us what you were doing, we might have been able to plan this properly.  
    **Aramis:** Yes, sorry.  
    **Athos:** No, no, by all means, let's keep things suicidal.
    
-   Maya from _Girl Meets World_ combines this with thanks to Parental Abandonment by her father. This makes her one of the darker characters you're likely to find on the Disney Channel and occasionally a walking example of Tear Jerker.
-   _Night and Day_'s Ryan Harper, to the very core. There is literally nobody who escapes his sneering and vitriol. He even delivers people's names in a sarcastic way, emphasising every consonant with dripping disdain to reflect the utter contempt in which he holds them.
-   Greg Serrano from _Crazy Ex-Girlfriend_, to a tee.
-   The title hero of _Jessica Jones (2015)_ has always been this, even before Kilgrave. It's the reason she was unable to hold down any one of the series of menial office jobs she cycled through before becoming a private investigator. This trait is even more apparent in _The Defenders (2017)_.
-   The title character of _Fleabag_ is the black sheep of her family and has difficulty holding down jobs or forming relationships so she's got the outsider part down pat and in addition to this, she narrates her life in the most beautifully snarky manner you can imagine. No one, least of all she, is safe from her barbed wit.
-   Ingrid Dracula in _Young Dracula_, though definitely without the self-loathing.
-   The snarks of Edmund Blackadder could fill an encyclopedia. In "Potato," he tries to one-up Sir Walter Raleigh, announcing his own sailing trip around the world.
    
    **Walter:** You'd never make it. The rain beats down so hard it would make your head bleed.  
    **Blackadder:** (_smugly_) I suppose some sort of hat is in order, then.
    

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Chris Jericho was this following his Face–Heel Turn in 2008, constantly expressing his disdain for fans with sarcastic comments.

-   Zeb Coulter, the manager for Jack Swagger and Antonio Cesaro, the Real Americans.
-   Damien Sandow, especially in his Outside the Ring videos.
-   John "Bradshaw" Layfield, when he's doing color commentary as a tweener character. Expect him to snark at _all_ the faces (except for the Divas, whom he just leers at) and sometimes also at the heels (except for the Divas, whom he...well, you know).

    Theater 

-   _Brand_ by Henrik Ibsen, whose title character _is_ this trope.
-   The title character of _Hamlet_ in every respect, from the outsider status, the virulent self-contempt, and of course the bitterly sardonic wit.

    Video Games 

-   Squall Leonhart of _Final Fantasy VIII_. He's aloof, unfriendly, and periodically quite snarky, and if anything holds _more_ disdain for himself than he does for others, mostly expressed via Inner Monologue.
-   Although there is never exactly one interpretation of a _Touhou Project_ character, Patchouli Knowledge is usually portrayed as a Snark Knight. The games show her as completely deadpan and cynical (especially in her lines regarding Sakuya in Subterranean Animism or Immaterial and Missing Power), but nevertheless a good and caring friend of Remilia and fanon often shows her as having a crush on Marisa.
-   Jacqli of _Ar tonelico II: Melody of Metafalica_ at first appears to be a Jerkass willing to betray anyone to accomplish her mysterious goals, and bitingly sarcastic towards everyone, especially the protagonist (also a Deadpan Snarker) but over time, as she comes to trust the heroes, she reveals her goals truly are noble that are simply hidden behind a hostile exterior because she is embarrassed to be working towards such goals and distrustful of others.
-   Shadow the Hedgehog from the _Sonic The Hedgehog_ series. He's got goals, generally involving being the best (just like Sonic, which is why they clash so often). And he mostly prefers to fulfill these goals on his lonesome. His only real friends are the robot E-123 Omega and sassy gem thief Rouge.
-   _Bully_'s Jimmy Hopkins serves as a slight subversion of this trope. He understands how crooked the school system can be with the various cliques and corrupted officials. He starts off the game as simply wanting to be left alone but eventually transforms more into a Knight in Sour Armor.
-   This is an option in the _Mystery Case Files_ PC game _Dire Grove._ On the main menu, you can toggle whether you want the Player Character's internal monologues to be Normal, Motivational, or Snarky. This is also an option in the next game in the series, _13th Skull_.
-   Kendall Flowers from _don't take it personally babe, it just ain't your story_, which provides a sharp contrast to Charlotte, who is as intelligent as her girlfriend, but actually cares about school/people in general.
-   Mahk in _I Miss the Sunrise_. He is an Insufferable Genius who practically radiates an aura of disdain for everything around him.
-   Jade Curtiss from _Tales of the Abyss_ fits this trope, mixed with Stepford Snarker. He snarks at everyone, especially himself, in part to help him cope with his Lack of Empathy and his guilt over his youthful indiscretions.
-   Another _Tales_ example, Yuri Lowell seems to have a sarcastic quip for just about any situation.
-   Ange Ushiromiya in _Umineko: When They Cry_ can do nothing but snark, as throughout the story she's stuck in the role of observer/investigator. Most of this is a defense mechanism against a world that has hurt her, and she expects to hurt her more. Even as a child she had a bit of a smart mouth (though not to the extent of a Little Miss Snarker.) In the 'Trick' ending, she embraces her cynicism along with everything she's learned from Rokkenjima to take on the 'Knight' aspect.
-   _Fleuret Blanc_ has Amara, who strives for perfection with every action and belittles those who don't live up to her standards. She disdains the gossipy Kant and Roland, and also disliked the Hot-Blooded Anastasia. However, she can grow to respect you if you complete her scavenger hunt.
-   _League of Legends_
    
    -   Aurelion Sol, who is the closest the game has to a god, he likes to make fun of everyone he comes in contact with. There's also the fact that some space spartans enslaved him so he's rather bitter about humanity in general.
    -   Xayah is a snarky, sarcastic rebel who seems to not take much seriously. But in a moment with her lover Rakan, she lets slip how tiring all the fighting is and how much pressure being the savior of her kind is putting on her.
    
    **Xayah:** I'm so tired...  
    **Rakan:** You gotta rest, honey.  
    **Xayah:** Everyone is depending on me.  
    **Rakan:** _Everyone_ can wait.
    
-   _Guild Wars 2_ Canach, his comments are the highlight of every episode he is taking part in.

    Web Animation 

-   _Red vs. Blue_: This _is_ Church. He even crosses into outright (attempts at) heroism sometimes, but never ceases pointing out how stupid everyone around him is, especially Caboose. He also has a strange sort of enduring optimism, in that he can be compelled to genuinely try to help people he likes. Washington from _Reconstruction_ almost fits too, but...
-   _RWBY_: Qrow's entire character revolves around this with his cynical yet laid-back attitude, always favors a drink and actually fights WHILE drunk, and angrily calls out his "partners" for idiotic decisions, though he takes a more playful attitude towards his nieces Ruby and Yang.
-   _DSBT InsaniT_: Killdra usually has a (rather dark) quip to anything, but she is prone to Self-Deprecation too.

    Web Comics 

-   Aggie of _Penny and Aggie_ starts off this way. Early storylines see her standing on the sidelines and aiming sarcastic comments and the occasional prank at popular girl Penny for her apparent superficiality and snobbery, in contrast to Aggie's espoused (though not always upheld) progressive values. She's also initially something of a loner with only one friend, the bookwormish Duane. Eventually, she develops a wider circle of friends, including Penny herself.
-   Faye from _Questionable Content_, big time.
-   Beth from _Better Days_ is portrayed this way, not in the comic itself, but in the first couple pages of the pornfolio "Beth's Night In".
-   Half the cast of _Something\*Positive_, Davan especially.
-   Susan/Tiffany Pompoms from _El Goonish Shive_ starts out like this, due to a combination of catching her father with another woman, her mother's followed bitterness over the matter (and men in general), and being tricked as a child into hunting and killing a not-vampire on her own. She later shed that aspect of her character, due to her friends' influence.
-   Tristan of _Angel Moxie_. A pretty cynical youth — especially of anything she perceives as "girly", thanks to her extreme tomboyishness. Her mother is utterly desperate for Tristan to display even average teenage behavior.
-   Haley Starshine of _The Order of the Stick_ certainly isn't one... but, on the other hand, her brain is hosting "Mistress Shadowgale", a.k.a the imaginary personification of her self-loathing, which certainly has several levels of Snark Knight.
    
    **Haley:** You look like I did as a teenager.  
    **Mistress Shadowgale:** How else would you expect your self-loathing to look?  
    **Haley:** Good point.
    
-   The main idea behind this is explained in a comic of _Rock Paper Cynic_.
-   _Homestuck_
    -   Karkat hates everyone, including himself. (At one point he thought he was his own hate-soulmate. It's a troll thing.) He insults everyone mercilessly, again including himself. His ability to rag on himself is aided by the time travel tomfoolery that all the trolls are up to their bulge in; he constantly gets into arguments with his past/future self. He also happens to be the Knight of Blood. Despite his bluster, it's worth listening to him, as Karkat has a good measure of people and can point out their flaws accurately.
    -   Rose. Pretty much 90%+ of everything she says is sarcastic, either playfully so or biting. Part of this comes from a childhood of passive-aggressive antagonism with her mother — except even that may have been one-sided and an illusion caused by Rose viewing her attempts to bond through Jade-Colored Glasses.
    -   To a lesser extent, Dave. He holds up a cool facade to pretty much everything, mocking everything and everyone he comes across, but when push comes to shove he's actually pretty insecure about his own abilities, especially compared with people he considers heroes like his Bro or John.

-   Sarna in _Errant Story_ follows this trope all the way to her death.
-   In _Schlock Mercenary_ Major Murtaugh from Sanctum Adroit is like this, as well as her boss (No Name Given).
-   Corrick of _Plume_ has a habit of keeping out of everyone else's emotional rollercoasters, and his method of choice for dealing with his protectees is to snark. A _lot_.

    Web Original 

-   The Nostalgia Chick. She's even _more_ cynical than her Spear Counterpart (which is a pretty huge achievement) and can make Daria look fun-loving at times, but she's also a Broken Bird prone to Self-Deprecation.
    -   Most imitating The Nostalgia Critic or the The Angry Video Game Nerd and taken up the mantle of internet reviewer invoke this trope. Ironically, The Nostalgia Critic himself has become more of a pitiful Chew Toy. This is especially true of any reviewers that have posted a "worst mistakes" video and called themselves out for errors they made in previous reviews.
    -   Todd in the Shadows has evident disdain for his fellow reviewers, roommates, typical mocking targets like Chris Brown, and himself. This makes the few times he does genuinely like something more unusual.
-   Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw of _Zero Punctuation_ avoids hypocrisy this way.
-   The host of _The Music Video Show_ has been this since the beginning but it's been a lot more noticeable since season four.
-   Sword Art Online Abridged: Holy hell, Kirito.
-   _YouTube_ personality Shoe0n Head. Even after having taken a level in kindness recently, she's still very sarcastic and sharp-tongued.

    Web Videos 

-   Pwnage: Kyle Addams acts world-weary and throws plenty of his biting and bitter wit. His snark is near-constant in their videos, not to mention, he won't exempt himself from his own disdainful comments. This quote shows one of his quotes where he insults himself, Damian, and the game they're playing.
    
    **Kyle:** This will be like a mystery- like anthropologists will somehow find this shitty video and just be like: Oh! Well appears to be some loud-mouthed white trash degenerate and some simpleton gap-toothed autistic kid who wandered around playing, uhh, what appears to be some simulation built to make people want to end their own lives!
    
-   On _Game Grumps_, Danny is often this to Arin's more "colorful" outbursts to doing badly at games. Like quipping "Yeah, that's what bullets are" to Arin after he complains about the One Hit Kills in _Mad Dog Mccree_, or saying "What did you _think_ would happen?" when Arin jumped to his death on _The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword_, or the scolding mother tone he uses when he says "..._Arin_" after Arin realizes the mistake he's been making that's been making him struggle at the game they've been playing. In fact, there is _specifically_ a "Dan Says 'Arin' Like a Disappointed Mother" compilation on Youtube that is a half-hour long. A _very_ common interaction between these two is for Arin to mess up at a game, Dan to drop some snark, a Beat, and Arin bursts out laughing.

    Western Animation 

-   _Big Hero 6: The Series_ has Hangry Panda, who was introduced in Season 3 as the first of Noodle Burger Boy's new sisters. She could easily give Gogo a challenge in terms of who's the snarkiest of them.
-   _Daria_: Daria Morgendorffer. Formerly a minor character on _Beavis and Butt-Head_, her derisive comments on the stupidity of the title characters made her popular enough with the fans' own sense of teenage world-weariness that she got her own show. She used to be the Trope Namer.
-   _Gravity Falls_:
    -   Dipper is frequently snarky, though during the times when he's outright catty, he makes it count. He'll frequently make remarks about his own lack of hygiene, once mentions not wanting to ever get Grenda mad at him, snarkily laments getting turned into a sock puppet, etc. Even _Gravity Falls: Journal 3_ has him provide some more compact, but equally sarcastic Snark Knight lines: Dipper mentions that Soos suggested that if the Zodiac circle prophecy was completed, they'd all gain "radness powers", to which the former dismissed in-journal as being out of the ancients' minds, before drawing a detailed picture of a muscled Soos with question marks all over his body, flowing sandy hair and cargo pants, capping it off with the caption "unlikely".
    -   Shandra Jimenez of Gravity Falls' Channel 6 News has her moments, usually in relation to never getting any real news or how she's a Workaholic who feels a compulsive need to continue her job even during Weirdmageddon.
-   _The Simpsons_. Lisa Simpson alternates between this and Soapbox Sadie, depending on the episode.
-   Sam(antha) from _Danny Phantom_. Also alternates between this and Soapbox Sadie.
-   Raven from _Teen Titans (2003)_ (not so much in the comic).
    
    **Raven:** This party is pointless.
    

-   _South Park_:
    -   With Craig, snarking makes up the majority of his dialogue, especially in "Pandemic".
        
        **Craig:** This is fun. Let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle. It just keeps getting better and better.
        
    -   Stan himself is also a great example. He transitions from a regular Deadpan Snarker around the 18th season, when he has to put up with the town's idiocy getting worse over the episodic plots, and 5 seasons later, his dad's shady criminal behavior over gaining a monopoly on his weed business. This trope reaches its head in the latter season, where he _makes a biopic_ filled with this kind of snark with some of his friends, on top of simultaneously having to submit to Chinese censors, including one _hovering directly over him and making him change any part of the script offensive to Chinese sensibilities_:
        
        **Stan**: Now I know how all the writers in Hollywood feel.
        
    -   Kyle's character largely went the opposite direction in terms of snark, though he still has some great Self-Deprecation lines, particularly in the _South Park: The Fractured but Whole_ and Season 26.
-   Nikki from _6teen_ is her group's version of the Snark Knight.
-   June from _KaBlam!_ sometimes fell into this trope.
-   _SpongeBob SquarePants_: Squidward makes a snarky remark almost every time he's on screen. This attitude seems to largely come from his belief that the citizens of Bikini Bottom are all well below him culturally and intellectually, which they are for the most part, especially SpongeBob and Patrick. He's also prone to making deadpan comments about his own misfortunes. Ex: after nearly getting impaled to death in "Band Geeks", he makes the following comment as though he were disappointed: "Too bad that didn't kill me."
-   _Total Drama_:
    -   Noah definitely falls into this category, since that was his only distinctive trait in season one, with Duncan coming in at a close second. Now that it's been 3 seasons, Noah's fleshed out more but is still definitely a snarker when he wants to be.
    -   Gwen also qualifies, especially in the first season.
-   Brendon Small of _Home Movies_ comes close. His ruthless self-criticism applies only to filmmaking, not any other aspect of his... uh, does Brendon _have_ a life?
-   Mai of _Avatar: The Last Airbender_, without question. She derides everyone and everything, declaring that even Victory Is Boring. Though she defrosts somewhat around Zuko.
-   If anything, the animated version of Obi-Wan Kenobi from _Star Wars: The Clone Wars_ is even snarkier.
-   In _SpacePOP_, being a snarky, sassy wise-cracker is Rhea's main character trait.
