Another Tuesday, another brokenhearted kid.

**Kids:** Give us our ball back! Give us our ball back!  
**Biff Tannen:** Oh, you mean this ball? Is this your ball? You want it back?  
**Kids:** Yeah!  
_\[Biff throws the ball up onto a neighbor's roof, inaccessible to the kids\]_  
**Biff Tannen:** _Go get it!!_ Hahahaha!

In essence, this is about destroying property just because you can... even though there is _nothing_ to gain from it. Being an asshole for the sake of being an asshole.

A Jerkass is walking down a sidewalk when he sees a group of little kids playing with a ball, or a remote-controlled plane. He goes up to them all casual-like and feigns interest as they rave about their new favorite toy. Next thing you know though, The Bully either borrows the toy or takes it by force and then either breaks it, throws it on top of a roof or into a body of water, takes it for his own... whatever's the cruelest way he can think of to deprive the kids of their fun. After he does this, he walks away laughing at what he's done while the poor little kids cry or shout angrily at him, hopelessly unable to do anything to fix or retrieve their toy.

Of course, this can be the moment that the local badass sees this happening and makes the Jerkass regret it by beating him up to the delight of the kids and/or making him retrieve the item or compensate for the loss.

This doesn't necessarily have to be exactly like that situation though; this trope applies to all types of jerkassery committed to all kinds of helpless people regarding their items. For example, when the Jerkass's co-worker just finished his project on a computer or whatever and is about to save it, the guy goes out of his way to pull the plug of his co-worker's computer, making the co-worker lose all his hard work.

A Sub-Trope of Kick the Dog. See Keep Away for a less drastic bully tactic. Sister Trope to For the Evulz and Evil Is Petty.

    Jokes 

-   There is a Dutch group of jokes that revolves around the throwing of bikes on roofs. For example:
    -   Humour: throwing a bike on the roof.
    -   Baby humour: throwing a kid's bike on the roof.
    -   Racist humour: throwing black and brown bikes on the roof.

-   In his introduction story in Louis Sachar's _Wayside School_ series, Terrence keeps kicking all the balls over the fence while saying things like "Shut up, Dixie cup." Eventually he complains that there's nothing left to kick, at which point Louis the yard teacher kicks _him_ over the fence.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In the _Are You Afraid of the Dark?_ episode "The Tale of the Dark Music", a bully takes the protagonist's bike and throws it onto the street where it gets run over by a passing bus. After the protagonist feeds the bully to the monster behind the music-activated door, he finds a shiny new bike in front of said door.
-   _Billy Webb's Amazing Story_ inverted this: the bike put the bully up there.
-   One scene in _Grange Hill_ spinoff _Tucker's Luck_ shows thug Passmore putting his bovver boot through the protagonists' ghetto blaster as a mindlessly destructive alternative to simply switching it off.
-   _M\*A\*S\*H_: BJ and Hawkeye were feuding with Charles - he was playing his French horn, annoying them, so they refused to shower until he stopped. Eventually the rest of the camp ganged up on BJ and Hawk and hosed them down. Charles watched this with delight... until someone took away his French horn, laid it on the ground, and ran over it with a jeep. This is a rare example of Charles being the victim rather than the snob.
-   _Mystery Science Theater 3000_ makes this a trait of Tom Servo and Crow, who never saw something they wouldn't smash for fun (including the satellite's _escape pods_ that no one even knew they had). Joel in one episode almost gets the better of them by claiming that he made a toothpick sculpture of Monticello specifically for them to destroy. The bots wander off because destroying something they are _supposed to_ is no fun... then immediately rush back in and do it anyway.
    -   Mike had a little more luck in a later episode, when Crow sees a character in the movie they're watching pour beer on someone's motorcycle out of spite. He declares that he will pour (or rather have Mike pour, as he lacks working hands) beer on Mike's most precious possession... which turns out to be a beer stein. Mike then says that Crow is precious to him too, and Crow dutifully demands that beer be poured on his own head. As Mike happily leaves with a stein full of beer, Crow admits this didn't go exactly as planned.
-   _Sharpe_ has both a hero and a villain destroying each other's stuff.
    -   _Sharpe's Enemy_: Richard Sharpe gets heartbroken because his spouse was killed by his mortal enemy and in utter frustration, he destroys a French spy's glasses. He came to demand that the British surrender. It might have been partly Percussive Therapy, but the spy was a jerk ass and had it coming. Nothing to gain from it, except it was a good way of showing the French Jerk who the alpha dog is.
    -   In _Sharpe's Honour_, the jerkass spy plans an elaborate revenge because Sharpe's chosen men and the British army defeated the French in a battle that he thought was an easy French victory. After series of misfortunes, Sharpe ends up caught by the French. The spy smashes Sharpe's telescope that he received from Wellington himself. Nice try doing your revenge and trying to break Sharpe, jerk spy, but it was a bad idea. Sharpe used one broken piece as a weapon and it helped him to escape.
-   _The Young Ones_: This trope could almost be called "The Vyvyan", because he has this as his MO. He routinely destroys not only his housemates' possessions, and those of anyone he comes into contact with, but also _his own._ All just for the fun of it. Of course, if your parents had saddled you with a name like "Vyvyan"...

    Music 

-   The music video to PSY's "Gentleman" has him, among other douchebag acts, play soccer with kids for a little bit before punting the ball as far as he can and celebrating while the kids cry.

    Mythology and Religion 

-   In some tales of Greek Mythology, the hero Perseus (who is normally a Nice Guy) steals the single eye that the three Graeae sisters must share to Blackmail them into getting information. When the Graeae sisters oblige him, he throws their eye into a lake.

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Ted DiBiase pulled this in his "Million Dollar Man" gimmick, telling a young boy that if he could dribble a ball fifteen times in a row without messing up, he'd give him $500 - on the 14th bounce, DiBiase stuck his foot out to screw the kid over, telling him that "You've got to learn a hard, cruel fact of life: when you don't do the job right, you don't get paid."
-   This was the basis for Raven's feud with Tommy Dreamer. Dreamer bullied Raven as a child, so Raven was going to destroy Dreamer's life as an adult. Beulah McGillicutty also bore a grudge against Dreamer for childhood bullying, but came to realize he was different as a man than as a boy and moved on.
-   During their feud with Daffney's All-Star Squad, Malia Hosaka of Legendary attempted this by stealing and trampling on one Kimberly's Thing dolls. During their feud with the Lucha Sisters, Legendary also killed Mia Yim's tree.
-   Yoshi Tatsu's feud with Tyson Kid on WWE Nx T was started by the later breaking one of his action figures.
-   During NWA Vendetta Pro Wrestling's Zombie Walk, Eric Watts popped Ricardo Rodriguez's skeleton blowup doll Boner, mocking Rodriguez as he tried in vain to blow it back up.
-   During LuFisto's reign as WSU World Champion, the new company owner DJ Hyde destroyed her manager Peegaboo.

    Video Games 

## In General:

-   This is the essence of being a Troll or Griefer in online games, particularly in games with persistant worlds and permanent progress loss, such as _EVE Online_ or _Rust_.

## By Series:

-   _Fable_: In the prologue, which has you play the Hero as a young boy and introduces the Karma Meter, you find a girl's favourite teddy bear and can either return it or give it to her Big Brother Bully for destruction.
    
    **Bully:** Now, Rosie, what game shall we play? "Teddy No-Legs?" What about "Burning Fur?"
    
-   _Fallout_:
    -   In _Fallout 2_, you can break a kid's toy in a small sidequest. You even get Experience Points for teaching him that "life is cruel and unfair".
    -   Much later, _Fallout: New Vegas_ lets you rescue a little slave girl's teddy bear and hand it to her. Or tear it in half in front of her, because... _because_.
-   As this video points out, in _Paper Mario 64_, if you're insane enough to max out the number of key items you have so that they overflow into your inventory, you can consume them like most other items in the field (they do nothing). Of course, this means that you can take Goombaria's dolly, _refuse to give it to her_, and then _eat it in front of her face_.
-   Done somewhat literally in _Tony Hawk's Underground_ where on the first mission, the main character has to grab the pieces of Eric's skateboard thrown on the roof of a house by the Elm Street drug dealers.

    Visual Novels 

-   In Yuuko's chapter of _ef - a fairy tale of the two._, bullies do this with Yuuko's indoor shoes, hiding them on top of the lockers, which causes her to have to go around all day in her socks. Eventually subverted — Yuuko hid them up there herself to create the illusion that she was being bullied, so that she could better manipulate Yuu.

    Western Animation 

-   _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_. Whenever Meatwad gets something, anything, Shake destroys it. Eventually, Shake is reduced to burning holes in Meatwad's carpet, the only thing he has left.
    -   This backfires on him in "Video Ouija". Shake commits suicide just so he can haunt Meatwad through the titular Video Ouija game, but by this time Meatwad has grown bored of it, leaving Shake stuck as a ghost caring for a perpetually crying ghost baby.
    -   In "Reedickyoulus" Shake microwaved Meatwad's kitten and then, forgetting he already killed Meatwad's kitten, microwaved his own kitten mistaking it for Meatwad's.
-   In the episode of _Ben 10: Alien Force_ _In Charm’s Way_, Kevin is depressed over the recent accident that left him covered in an amalgam of stone. While on the beach, some kids drop their volleyball near him, and he squishes it until it pops rather than give it back. The kids are upset, but after Kevin and the rest of the Power Trio defeat an attacking alien, one Genre Savvy kid sympathetically points out that monstrous looking heroes like him are always sad and angry.
-   In _Dora the Explorer_, whenever Swiper actually manages to steal something, he doesn't even try to keep it for himself, but throws it as far as he can.
-   In the _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ episode, "One Bad Apple" has a variant of this when Applebloom's cousin, Babs Seed, defensively joins in Diamond Tiara and Silverspoon's taunt of the CMC and tries to up the ante by kicking their float. In doing so, she inadvertently destroys it and Babs, although surprised, then feels that she has to play along and rub it in to keep her facade up.
-   Invoked by Buford in _Phineas and Ferb_ First, he inadvertently destroys the bounce house at the meatloaf festival because he was too big to jump on it and doing so caused it to pop. After the titular duo build a new and better one, he presents it to the children to atone for what he did only to produce a needle seconds afterwards and pop it on purpose.
-   Several episodes of _The Rabbit with the Checkered Ears_ in which Mozdony plays the role of The Bully involve him taking other characters' possessions simply because he can, and the title character intervening to restore them to their rightful owners.
    -   "The Borrowed Stroller" involves Kriszta borrowing a doll's stroller from a friend in exchange for letting her walk her dog. Mozdony is in the same park as Kriszta, and decides to help himself to the stroller while her back is turned and use it as a go-kart.
    -   At the beginning of "Whose House is This?", Kriszta and Kistöfi make a Wendy-house out of a giant cardboard box in Kriszta's front garden. Mozdony happens to walk past the front gate and decides to climb in the house himself; his sheer size means there is no room inside for the other two, and he rebuffs their attempts to get him out again.
-   In the _Ren and Stimpy_ short "Sven Hoek", Stimpy and Ren's equally moronic cousin, Sven, are seen playing their favourite board game, Don't Whiz on the Electric Fence, which indeed has an actual electric fence. When Ren comes home from work, he finds they've also, in their idiocy, destroyed his most precious belongings. In the midst of a psychotic rant outlining the terrible things he has planned for them, Ren discovers the board game, and asks tauntingly, "Do you like this game? Do you really, _really_ like this game?" and proceeds to... well, take a whiz on it. The resulting short generates an explosion that literally blows them all straight to Hell, where the Devil cheerfully admonishes them with "So, you whizzed on the electric fence, didn't ya?"
-   _Rugrats_: Angelica has kicked several of Tommy's balls into the other side of the yard with the bull dog in it.
    -   In "The Trial", Angelica broke Tommy's clown lamp because she thought it was ugly.
-   _The Simpsons_:
    -   Bart and Nelson are with Millhouse in the park, watching him play with his remote control plane and are thoroughly bored.
        
        **Bart:** Milhouse, this is boring. Make it crash or something.  
        **Milhouse:** Perfectly level flying is the supreme challenge of the scale model pilot.  
        _(Nelson takes the remote and gives a more spectacular stunt... it finally ends its trip crashing on the roof of a mysterious old house)_
        
    -   Another, though this time subverted, example from the show is when Mr. Burns does this simply out of curiosity, but he's so old and decrepit that "taking candy from a baby" is not as easy as he had thought.
-   In episode 5 of _Total Drama Island_, Heather deliberately tanks her performance in a talent show challenge by foregoing her planned dance act in favor of reading Gwen's diary on national television. Not only was this such a pointlessly nasty action that it even shocked Chris, but this led to her team losing the challenge, which they would have definitely won if she had put forth an actual performance due to the huge lead in points they had built up after the first two rounds. The only thing that kept Heather from being voted off that night was Plot Armor.
