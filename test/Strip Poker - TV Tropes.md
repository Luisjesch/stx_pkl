A game that involves the loss of one's clothing. The traditional, trope-naming game is Poker, although any game may be played. Mahjong is a popular game for this in Japan, which is why several arcade games where you play strip mahjong were made in The '90s. The loss of clothing is usually little by little, to prolong the suspense, although this is not always the case.

Most setups will usually involve one or more attractive women, and the male character(s) (to say nothing of the male _audience_) eagerly looking forward to making at least one lose her shirt... among other garments. More often than not, however, the scene switches to the almost fully clothed woman at the table displaying her Royal Flush to a group of guys in varying states of undress— but with at least one in his Goofy Print Underwear.

A common variant involves a regular game of poker where one player is losing so badly that he eventually resorts to betting any stuff he happens to have with him when attempting to win his money back, eventually literally losing the shirt off his back (and the other clothes, as well).

May result in a Shameful Strip if the loser is not eager to disrobe. Expect a savvy participant to use Loophole Abuse to delay this outcome, e.g. by taking off _a single earring_ rather than an actual garment.

This game, more often discussed than actually played, has been the basis for several computer games, as well as two game shows: _Strip Poker_ on USA Network and _Räsypokka_ on Finland's SubTV.

Subtrope of Humiliating Wager. See You Can Leave Your Hat On for stripping without the poker pretext.

    Advertising 

-   An old vodka (Smirnoff?) advertisement has a woman who is "1 part card shark, 1 part cheat, 1 part exhibitionist", where in a mixed-gender game of Strip Poker she _deliberately_ loses, despite palming a card, and has to take off her bra.
-   Another vodka advert has _strip chess_. The woman wins.
-   Inversion: The regional furniture chain Oak Express had a bunch of ads showing "unnatural" scenarios to contrast with the store's wares. One such scenario has a bunch of nudists playing "Dress Poker".
    
    **Woman 1:** He's gotta be hiding cards somewhere...  
    **Woman 2:** Eew.
    
-   This (banned) commercial for Centrum Silver. (Probably a good idea the scene shifted when it did.)
-   A lingerie commercial (Under Brazil) entitled Strip. The film shows a variety of well healed men and women playing strip poker in a nightclub. Two of the women end up topless.

    Anime & Manga 

-   At one point in _Ah! My Goddess_, Chihiro reminisces about how she once forced her then suitors (her immediate successors as head of the NIT Motor Club) to play strip janken until they were both completely naked.
-   The Fujiyama Gangsta Paradise arc of _Black Lagoon_ combines this with a Shameful Strip for a villainous version. After Yukio is captured, her captors play strip bowling. For every strike they remove a piece of clothing from her. By the time we see her she has lost her shoes, socks, skirt and bra, but for some reason she can still cover herself with her (unbuttoned) shirt.
-   In the _Cat Planet Cuties_ OVA, the Female Catia cast play strip mahjong and strip poker, and there is strip chess with Jens losing to Muttley as well as strip rock-paper-scissors with Kio and some of the female cast, and Kio is winning (he was blindfolded, and they kept using scissors to his rock).
-   Faye and Jet from _Cowboy Bebop_. She cheats. It's plain ordinary gambling (with dice, in this case). Jet just has lost everything in his possession he's willing to bet, so he only has his clothes to put on the line.
-   In _D.Gray-Man_, Allen plays this with Tyki Mikk and his human friends, leaving them without their clothes. One volume of the manga also has a joke inner cover, where it's Tyki and Lavi Allen stripped to their underwear.
-   Davis starts to suggest a game of this in the dub version of _Digimon_'s Christmas Episode. Yes, the _dubbed version_. While the girls (more specifically, his crush Kari) are in the room. My, my... To be fair it is cut off after "Strip", and is really more of a Parental Bonus.
-   In a filler arc of _Dragon Ball Z_, Krillin's girlfriend Maron plays this with Korin and Yajirobe. Naturally she ends up winning Yajirobe's clothing and Korin's items.
-   _Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA_: Done in one of the OVAs where Irisviel and the two housekeepers Sella and Leysritt play a spiced up version of _The Game of Life_ where they players take the opponents' clothes instead of money. Iri wins without losing any of her clothes, while Leyritt loses her top and Sella loses all of her clothes (she still has her panties on, which technically also loses).
-   In _Futari Escape_, Senpai and Kouhai play Strip Hanafuda for New Years, which results in both of them in the buff by the time Kouhai's editor arrives to join them. Both girls' nipples are covered by Kouhai's Godiva Hair and Senpai's cards.
-   In _Gamble Fish_, there is a strange variation of Strip Dice: dice are rolled and the two girls playing must come up with a prime number by combining the dice numbers in some fashion. It must be a higher number than the previous turn. If you give a prime number, the opponent loses an article of clothing. If the number you give isn't prime, you lose an article. Later, there is a high-stakes poker match in which Tomu's harem has to take off clothing in his stead.
    -   And finally, it is revealed that Mizuhara plays online Strip Poker in his spare time under the alias Kaizer Mizuhara, so much so that his poker skills are on par with professional gamblers. He's infamous on the internet as the "Stripping Emperor".
-   _Gintama_ parodies the trope (not surprisingly) by adding in deadly stakes and a Shout-Out to the eponymous gambler protagonist of _Akagi_. The final round boils down to him, Gintoki, Madao, and the episode's exclusive character all naked around a Mahjong table, ending when the former's cheat backfires and gives the win to, oddly, Madao.
-   _Gravion Zwei_ begins with the Gran Knights having to do chores after Eiji loses big against the Maids in a game that left him down to his boxers. Rather than lose those (much to the maids' disappointment), he bet the team's services.
-   A one-off chapter of _Hayate the Combat Butler_ has Miki reveal that she had her father's company make a deck of cards where half of them were transparent, creating some interesting new strategies since your opponent could see at least some of your cards and vice versa. Hinagiku shows up after a demonstration and wants to play, with Miki _instantly_ declaring that Hina has to strip if she loses...and making Izumi strip instead of herself if Hina wins. After some obvious goading to her competitive nature, Hina agrees. Miki realized how screwed she was when Hina got an all-transparent royal flush. For Fanservice, Izumi did actually strip after each hand despite her complaints.
-   In _Miyuki-chan in Wonderland_, Miyuki plays a chess game against her cold, lesbian reflection, and the loser is forced to strip herself naked. Somehow, Miyuki manages to win the game despite of not being able to bring down a single enemy piece and she has only two pieces left. However, since her opponent is her _reflection_, the punishment has the same effect as if the real Miyuki have lost.
-   Variation in _Negima! Magister Negi Magi_ One of the girls in Negi's class asks if the students can play Baseball Janken, a quiz game to help review for the big test. Negi approves. Unfortunately, (or fortunately, as the case may be) he's too innocent/uninformed to know that the game's primary rule appears to be "answer a question wrong, lose an article of clothing." The Baka Rangers get stripped to their underwear within four minutes.
-   In _No Game No Life_, you can wager anything in the games, including clothing. Since poor Stephanie loses almost every game she tries, she gets stripped a lot.
-   In _Ranma ½_, in order to defeat the infamous Gambling King, Ranma "trains" with Ukyō and Akane by playing Old Maid. By morning, he's down to his underwear and the girls own not only his clothes, but many, many IOUs for his services.
-   _Rio -Rainbow Gate!-_: Orlin Dunhill sends thugs after a little girl named Mint. Rio fights them off and then challenges Orlin to a game of poker, saying if she wins, he'll have to explain himself and then leave. He says he'll only agree to those terms if she wagers something important, so Mint says if Rio loses, she'll take off her clothes. Rio reluctantly agrees and a film crew is brought in to record the game. Rio wins and Orlin keeps his word, but then Mint trips and accidentally pulls Rio's skirt down.
-   In _Rurouni Kenshin_, shortly before they meet Megumi, Kenshin and Sanosuke go gambling. While waiting for them to come back, Yahiko says he bets they'll lose it all and come home in their underwear (it doesn't happen). At the game, Sanosuke boasts that he will send all his opponents home in their underwear before they get interrupted.
-   In _So, I Can't Play H!_, they play strip poker in episode 10, to prevent Ryosuke from finding out the truth about the situation. It ends with all girls in just their underwear, and Ryosuke gets a Royal Straight Flush. Then they find out he was cheating.

Basically **not** at all Exactly What It Says on the Tin; the contestants wore four layers of underwear and no thanks to USA's standards and advertisers, never got below that last layer.

If you manage to eliminate Cora, Kristin, or Trixie from the game, they wind up stripped down to their panties and will _stay_ that way for the rest of the game. On the other hand, this is true for the male players too, Chuck himself included, although Chuck can just find more clothes and get dressed again.
-   A famous cutscene in _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ (triggered by talking to Varric with high enough approval) features the Inquisitor, companions and advisors playing a game of Wicked Grace.

-   Implied in the second _Knights of the Old Republic_ with the mention of "Nar Shadaa rules" for Pazaak.

    **Atton**: (to the female exile) No, our clothes stay on./(to the male exile) No, our blasters stay in their sheaths.

-   In _Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth_, Nosuri complains of being bored out in the country where there isn't much of a gambling scene. Haku makes a set of hanafuda cards and teaches her how to play koi-koi... but Nosuri is terrible at the game, swiftly loses all her money, and starts betting her clothes too, to Haku's exasperation (he tries to subtly let her win at this point, but she's so terrible she keeps losing anyway).
