The Demonic Head Shake is a staple of horror movies of recent history, made famous by the 1990 movie _Jacob's Ladder_. The effect is achieved by filming somebody (or something) waving their head at a very low frame rate and later play the footage back at normal speed which creates an unsettling motion blur effect. Characteristically, the shoulders and the rest of their body remain completely still while the head goes all jittery.

This effect can be used during a Transformation Sequence or alongside a Marionette Motion where awkward body motions are filmed in Adrenaline Time creating the illusion of a broken doll. Compare Exorcist Head when someone spins their head around 360 degrees.

    Anime & Manga 

-   In the anime adaptation of _The Garden of Sinners_, the Big Bad Araya Souren does this while regenerating from a wound on his neck where he was stabbed by Shiki earlier. Enjo Tomoe is freaked out by the sight to such an extent that he runs away shrieking.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   In _Avengers: Infinity War_, Doctor Strange is doing this as he's having spams from seeing millions of possible futures through the Eye of Agamotto.
-   The Austrian psychological thriller _Goodnight Mommy_ has a Nightmare Sequence wherein Elias' mother strips down in the woods and starts spasming uncontrollably.
-   _A Haunting at Silver Falls_: After leading Jordan down to a convenience store with a TV, Holly begins to shriek, point, and move her head around rapidly. Jordan then discovers that the TV is talking about Wyatt Dahl, who is being put to death that night for murdering the twins.
-   In _House on Haunted Hill (1999)_, one of the characters experiences a rather freaky nightmare while trapped in a sensory deprivation chamber. This starts with a ghost nurse "diagnosing" him, before asking the ghost of Dr. Vanacut for his "opinion". The Doctor responds by shaking his head in a blurry fashion.
-   _Innerspace_ combines this with Shapeshifter Swan Song when Jack (disguised as the Cowboy) loses control over his shapeshifting ability and undergoes an eerie facial deformation process wherein his head shakes uncontrollably.
-   The Trope Maker is most likely _Jacob's Ladder_, which has The Vietnam Vet Jacob encounter several of those "twitcher" characters, signifying his mind slipping into madness. The most famous scene is of a hooded, legless man doing the head shake. They filmed the actor waving his head around at 4fps, resulting in an incredibly fast and deeply disturbing motion when played back at the normal frame-rate of 24fps. The imagery was inspired by Witkin's 1976 photograph "Man With No Legs<small>◊</small>".
-   Happens quite a bit in _Tetsuo: The Iron Man_ alongside some truly psychotic stop-motion sequences.
-   An example that's Played for Laughs in _Ultraman Zearth_, when Katsuto — Zearth's human form — needs to transform, by brushing his teeth non-stop for 10 seconds. The results are as hilarious as it sounds.
-   In _What We Do in the Shadows_, Nick does this in his bed as part of his transformation into a vampire.

-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   In the TV movie, the Master attempts to steal the Doctor's body. As part of the process, his head shakes and blurs.
    -   "The End of Time": The Master uses the Immortality Gate to unleash a World-Wrecking Wave that transforms every human being into a copy of him, which causes their heads to shake at blurring speed while they're being converted.
-   In the _Farscape_ episode "Thanks For Sharing", the shapeshifting Corlata mercenary does this as it changes back into its Shapeshifter Default Form.
-   Happens in _Hannibal_ episode "Tome-wan". During his Mushroom Samba sequence, Mason Verger envisions Hannibal shaking his head this way for a few seconds until it changes into a boar head. Watch the sequence here.

-   In _Dead Space_, Twitchers sometimes have this effect thanks to their Super-Speed.

-   A non-demonic example is seen _Metal Gear Solid_. Gray Fox's exoskeleton and medicine, while enhancing his potential, leads him to have very painful spasms, complete with violently uncontrollable headshakes.
    -   Even scarier on the original Play Station version as the head is shaking too fast for the framerate that the red glow emitted from the central eye can't even follow properly.
-   _Overwatch_: In "Sigma Origin Story", Sigma's head vibrates from side to side as his personality fractures due to a close encounter with a black hole. It never comes up in-game due to his mastery of his new gravity powers, but he hasn't managed to eliminate the twitching entirely.
-   A positive example in the first _PAGUI_, where the Temple Keeper's head in the final cutscene shakes in this fashion after praying to the gods. Thankfully, it's a sign that his prayers are answered, when three War Gods of Taoist culture then descends from heavens.
-   _SIGNALIS:_ Per the game's classic horror inspirations, the heads of corrupted Aras and Kolibris constantly jitter in homage to this trope.
-   The _Silent Hill_ franchise, heavily influenced by _Jacob's Ladder_, is the Trope Codifier, providing examples of head twitching as well as Marionette Motion all throughout the game series in random scenes and encounters:
