But how do we know that he's not wearing a ROBOT MASK?!

**Raphael:** _\[stabs Foot Soldier\]_ "Clang?" Did you say "Clang?"  
**Leonardo:** Check those dudes out! _\[cue sparking\]_  
**Donatello:** "Dudes", nuts — they're robots!  
**Michelangelo:** Robots? LET'S ROCK!

So there's this person you've met. They look like a human, they act like a human, they talk like a human, and in your mind, they're very much a human.

Then they get wounded, and instead of bleeding, they're releasing sparks. Or maybe you catch them doing something no human is capable of, like changing stations by blinking, or lifting a car.

Apparently, the human you've been with was one of them cyborgs, Ridiculously Human Robots, or Mechanical Lifeforms.

At this point, one of two things may happen.

If the character is an enemy, this is the signal for The Hero to go all out in battle. After all, it's Just a Machine, who cares if it gets hurt or killed? (certainly not the censors!)

However, if the character is a friend, this will lead to much shock and/or angst for everyone as they ask themselves What Measure Is a Non-Human?. This may include a Heroic BSoD if even the robot doesn't know. But what about the real, human, friend? There are two options. One, that it never existed, and This Was His True Form all along (or that he was replaced a long time ago, way before the story began, and none of the heroes had actually meet the real guy). Or two, that he he was kidnapped and replaced as part of an Assimilation Plot or by a spy shapeshifter, and now the heroes must search and rescue their friend, if he was not killed.

A specific kind of Glamour Failure. For the alien and other organic creature version of this trope, see Machine Blood and Bizarre Alien Biology. Occasionally appears as a subversion of Mortal Wound Reveal — the robot _should_ have died, but because of its non-biological nature, it won't die, causing much in the way of Oh, Crap! moments. If the robotic reveal is used as a cheap getaway resource, then it was probably Actually a Doombot.

Compare Unrobotic Reveal and Animated Armor. When only a limb or two are robotic/artificial, then it's Prosthetic Limb Reveal instead.

## As this is a form of The Reveal, unmarked spoilers abound. Beware.

    Anime and Manga 

-   _AKB0048_'s Mayu Watanabe looks like just another member of the pop idol group...until she raises her arm and a missile launcher complete with aiming visor swings up out of it. This is not really focused on in the show, though.
-   Split between the final two episodes of the second season of _Bakuten Shoot Bey Blade_ comes the reveal that Zeo is a robot, built in the image of his father's deceased human son. Although Kyōju had figured it out already, the proper reveal comes when the strain of Zeo's beybattle against Takao becomes too much and his right arm glitches open to reveal the circuitry underneath his fake skin.
-   In the final episode of _The Big O_ it turns out that Big Ear, the mysterious informant who's always reading a newspaper when he's spoken to, is an android.
-   In _Bubblegum Crisis 2033_, Largo's boomer status — which had been implied before — is confirmed when Leon shoots him in the hand, leaving a small hole with sparking metal visible inside. The first episode has this happen to the kidnapped little girl, who is as surprised as anyone else that she's a Boomer with the Phlebotinum to control the military's Kill Sats.
-   In the finale of _Coyote Ragtime Show_, Madame Marciano is injured and revealed to be a cyborg. Then again, being the Truly Single Parent of twelve Robot Girls, is it really that surprising?

-   At the end of the fourth episode of _Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School Side:Future_, the camera focuses on one of Miaya Gekkougahara's eyes after she is seemingly knocked out, revealing her eye is actually a camera. We then see that she is being remotely controlled by Monaca Towa.
-   In _Dominion Tank Police_, Annapuma loses her arm in an explosion, revealing her metallic skeleton. This causes Leona to exclaim, "Mechanical love dolls?!"
-   _Dragon Ball_ has Major Metallitron, a homage to/parody of The Terminator. Goku hits him with the Kamehameha, blowing up his head and showing the metal plates in his chest.

The movie for the 10th anniversary of the franchise does away with the Schwarzenegger resemblance and turns him into a Scary Black Man instead.
-   During a crossover between _Dragon Ball_ and _Doctor Slump_, Vegeta is shocked when Arale survives her decapitation at his hands.
    
    **Vegeta:** She's not human!?

-   Parodied, like everything else, in _Excel♡Saga_. Ropponmatsu II gets shot in the head, and the circuitry underneath reveals she's a robot. Excel is honestly surprised by this, despite obvious signs of it earlier in the episode. Ropponmatsu herself considers it obvious, and asks how many people shoot missiles from their knees. Well, considering how stupid Excel is, it's no surprise she hasn't caught on.
-   In _Fullmetal Alchemist_, Ed has an automail reveal when his right arm gets attacked by Cornello's pet chimera. In _Brotherhood_, the reveal is done by a rogue alchemist trying to freeze his blood in that arm.

-   In episode 9 of _Gundam Build Divers Re:RISE_, Hiroto finds himself staring down the barrel of the Gundam Seltsam's Mega Beam Cannon, his Marsfour Gundam unable to escape. Suddenly, May throws herself and her WoDom Pod in front of him and takes the shot. It's too much and the Pod explodes...

-   In _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_, one of the characters, Subaru Nakajima, walks out of an explosion, covered in blood and one arm missing a large chunk of flesh, revealing the cybernetics underneath, during her scene of Unstoppable Rage. Interestingly, there's no Artificial Human\-related angsting here, partly because most of the _Nanoha_ cast aren't human, and have no problems at all accepting it.
    -   And unlike Fate and Erio, Subaru and Ginga had a loving family, and complete knowledge of their origins long before the series even began.
    -   Hell, by this point in the series, the Bureau probably has "So you're not exactly what's traditionally considered human, that's okay because you're a person too and we support you" pamphlets. (Probably written by Fate and Nanoha.)
        -   Happens again in the PSP games; The Florian Sisters are full androids.
-   In one episode of _Medabots_, Rokusho reunites with his parrot friend, Anton. A few moments into their reunion, Anton seemingly passes away, leaving everybody heartbroken, then offended when Ikki's mother begins to mess with Anton's body, until she reveals that Anton just needs new batteries, leaving everybody annoyed that Rokusho forgot to mention Anton was a robot.
-   This occurred in _Negima Neo?!_ during the re-telling of the battle between Negi and Asuna against Evangeline and Chachamaru. Chachamaru uses herself as a shield to save a group of cats which had gotten caught in the fray, causing her shoulder and upper thigh to spark and a metallic skeleton to show beneath her skin. In the regular manga, she never makes any indication that she's attempting to hide her robotic nature; she even has incredibly obvious antenna ears and pulls out the jetpack in a public place to get a kid's balloon out of a tree. Everyone else (except Chisame) is just oblivious.
-   In _Mobile Suit Gundam 00_ half of Lichty's body is revealed to be cybernetic when he saves Christina's life at the cost of his own. Since it adds very little to his character, this was most likely due to the fact that it would have looked really gruesome if a normal human body had been exposed to GN particle beam like that, and wouldn't have passed the censors.
-   Bartholemew Kuma of _One Piece_ was revealed as a cyborg this way.
-   After being on the receiving end of a reflected fire spell, Mubyou in _Our Home's Fox Deity_ is revealed to be a robotic duplicate of the _real_ Mubyou.

Seems the duplicate Mubyou just wanted to be acknowledged for her work.

They promptly stop mistrusting him after that (Muza believed he had no business being with their group when his life was seemingly fine).
-   _Waq Waq_: Set After the end, the main character is a "black blood" (one of many) that fights robotic Kaiju, and discovers a legendary "red blood", or 'Kami'. The reveal- the 'kami' is an otherwise ordinary schoolgirl pulled out of the setting's past, and the "black bloods" are descendants of robots/androids that had rebelled; the Kaiju are what's left of Humanity's defensive weaponry systems.

    Film — Live-Action 

-   Used a number of times in the _Alien_ series.
    -   _Alien_: Ash, the ship's medical officer, by _bashing his head off_ as he's trying to choke Ripley to death.
    -   _Aliens_: Bishop cuts his hand doing a Five-Finger Fillet and bleeds white fluid.
    -   _Alien³_: Inverted when someone suspected of being an android is violently attacked, only to start bleeding very human red.
    -   _Alien: Resurrection_: Annalee Call. During their escape in the elevator shaft, Wren has trouble opening the shaft door. He asks for Call's gun which she readily provides, not realizing her mistake until Wren shoots her in the chest, knocking her off the ladder and into the water with a very determined xeno on the group's tail. After they take out the xeno, they are surprised when Call opens the shaft door from the other side, soaked with water. Though she doesn't want to talk about what happened, Ripley saw her being hit and her light clothing betray the fact that she doesn't have body armor. She opens her jacket and reveals circuits and synthetic liquid instead of bone fragments and blood. Androids built by Androids are illegal so Call hid her own identity to stay alive.

-   Inverted in _The Black Hole_ when the Cygnus' compliment of robotic crew members are actually revealed to be the lobotomised remains of the human crew. With Maximilian's help Dr. Reinhardt converted them into subservient cyborgs after they tried to mutiny.
-   Averted in _Blade Runner_ (in the Director's Cut, at least) — there are a few hints that the hero, Deckard, might be a "replicant", but we never find out for sure, leading to decades of fan speculation. When the sequel, _Blade Runner 2049_, came out many years later, it made a point of preserving that particular mystery.
-   In _Eternals_, Sersi learns from Arishem that the Eternals are not aliens from Olympia as they were told but artificial beings built at a space factory. She is shown rows of partly-constructed robots that resemble her and her teammates.

More bonus points because Spooner absolutely hates robots (to be clear, Spooner isn't actually a _full_ robot; he lost that arm in a serious car accident years ago and was fully aware that it and some ribs had been replaced by cybernetic components).
-   _Kim Possible_: Athena removes part of her face while confronting Kim before the latter's final fight against Drakken and Shego, revealing that she's a cybernetic humanoid created by Drakken to befriend and then destroy Kim. Problem is, she actually did earn Kim's friendship in the process...

-   _Metropolis_ has one of the first robotic reveals. A Mad Scientist creates a female robot that is identical to Maria, a woman who preaches about peace to the enslaved workers in the city who want to revolt. The real Maria is kept away as the robot inspires lust among men and violence among the workers. When the city falls to pieces, and the people decide that Maria is to blame, they tie her up to a stake and attempt to burn her to death. She laughs as her 'exterior' melts away, revealing that she is a robot.
-   In _Pixel Perfect_, a hologram named Loretta is created by a teenager to help his best friend's band. Loretta is thought to be human until the band's second performance, when she starts fading in and out. But, in a slight subversion, everyone loves the holographic lead singer.

-   _Screamers_: The humanoid Screamers successfully infiltrate human camps before they're revealed. There are so many new generations that the protagonist eventually has trouble believing that anyone besides him is even human. In fact, he visits the enemy camp (dwindled down to three remaining soldiers) and the soldier who is killed under suspicion of being a Screamer turns out to be the only one of the three who _wasn't_ a robot.
-   _The Signal (2014)_: All of the staff in the isolation hospital wear hazmat suits, with only their faces visible. At the end of the film, the boss takes his helmet off, revealing that there is only circuitry behind his face. The others are probably the same.

    -   Both the original and the remake have the scene where Joanna confronts the mysteriously changed Bobbie and goes so far as to stab her in the stomach. The Stepfordized Bobbie doesn't bleed, instead she initially looks unfazed, but then starts repeating herself like a broken record.
    -   The 1975 version features a chilling climax when Joanna meets her robot double.
    -   In the 2004 version, it's revealed when the main character knocks his head off that Mike Wellington is actually a robot, while it's his _wife_ that's the programmer, an inversion from the original movie.
-   In _Surrogates_, The Prophet, the leader of the anti-surrogate movement, is revealed to be a surrogate controlled by Lionel Canter, the surrogates' inventor, when he is shot and we see circutry inside his body.
-   _Terminator_:
    -   _The Terminator_
        -   The T-800 walks around with half of its facial flesh torn off for the first time, an iconic, much-copied image in pop cultire, which traumatized both characters and audience members in 1984.
    -   _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_:
        -   The T-800 cuts the skin off his arm deliberately to prove to the Dysons that he isn't human.
        -   At first, the T-1000 seems like it's the soldier the resistance sent back to protect John, until the T-800 shot him multiple times and he reformed afterwards.
    -   _Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines_:
        -   When Kate Brewster sees her fiancé, Scott, at the cemetery where Sarah Connor's tomb is located, but he reforms, and an endoskeleton is visible, revealing him to be the T-X in disguise.
        -   As John, Kate and the T-850 are heading to the base, General Brewster gives Skynet free range, at the same time, Kate appears out of nowhere, causing General Brewster to question her sudden appearance, but the T-850 shoots her multiple times, revealing her to be the T-X in disguise again.
    -   _Terminator Salvation_ pretty much does this _in the trailer._ While we do not see the entire scene, the gist of the scene explains everything: Kate, trying to patch up a wounded soldier, is horrified when she sees Terminator circuitry, calls over John Connor, who ties him up and interrogates him, before untying him when he sincerely doesn't understand why the hell he's tied up, just so he can see it for himself. Cue the horror.
-   _Toys_: Alsatia, revealed by her accidental decapitation in the climactic battle.

-   _War God_ has the three Martians, though it's somewhat ambiguous if they're robots or Mechanical Lifeforms. When fighting Guan Yu in the climax, one of them have his arm hacked off and reveals wiring.
-   The schlocky Italian B-movie _War of the Robots_ has hostile robots disguised as humans as enemies (like the title implies). Some of them gets their limbs removed and at least one suffers Half the Man He Used to Be (from the waist), revealing wiring and mechanical interiors.

    Gamebooks 

-   _Toy Terror: Batteries Included_ has a sub-plot where you find out hostile toys who gained sentience of their own thanks to a malfunctioning AI has been replacing humans with life-like androids. You can tell the difference between humans and toys by looking at their heels — toy humans have a battery compartment in their foot. And your friend Benny actually turns out to be one of them in a bad ending after he lose a shoe.

    Literature 

-   _Ani-Droids_:
    -   In the original short novella _Argo_, Mira believes herself human until she meets the rogue AI known as "Mother," who cuts open Mira's arm to reveal the machinery underneath. Then Mother explains that humans actually lost the Robot War and humanity has been replaced by androids who think themselves human, the masquerade maintained by the ani-droids whome they thought served them. She then fixes Mira's arm and erases her memory of the conversation.
    -   In the rewrite and expansion _Ani-Droids_, it is instead Mira's FBI agent friend Bobby who is revealed to be a robot when his ani-droid partner accidentally splits his head open attempting to arrest them both. Afterwards Mira's hacked ani-droid companions explain that humanity's population has been declining since the nuclear war a century ago and human-like robots are used to conceal that fact, but Mira herself is flesh-and-blood. Until the final chapter, where Mother uploads her brain into an ani-droid.
-   _Animorphs_ did this a little differently. They morph dogs, and just-so-happen to run into an old acquaintance of Marco's as he's passing out fliers for the Yeerks' front organization, and they freak out because... _Erek has no scent._ Because this might be a new weapon of the Yeerks, they stalk him until he just-so-happens to get hit by a truck and his hologram shorts out for a split-second. It's not until they morph spiders (which see a different wavelength of light) that they can confirm that he's an android<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> , however. Erek turns into a fairly important minor character, as the Animorphs' spy inside the Yeerk organization and using his and his friends' holographic abilities to impersonate the Animorphs so that they can go into outer space or something without being missed.
-   _Book of the New Sun_: Severian's friend Jonas, a former spaceship crewman, has a robotic hand; he once mentions having been injured in a crash and being forced to repair himself with spare parts. After he's badly injured by a Lightning Lash, Severian undresses his unconscious body to treat his wounds and discovers that Jonas has a robotic _everything_ from the abdomen down, and realizes he's a machine with flesh grafted to him. After waking up, Jonas clarifies that the parts he repaired himself with were organic, salvaged from human crewmen who didn't survive the crash.
-   Isaac Asimov:
    -   In _The Caves of Steel_, Elijah Baley is told from the start that R. Daneel Olivaw is a robot. He refuses to believe it, however, as robots that advanced don't exist on Earth in his time — and he has a brilliant theory about the murder of the human in whose image Daneel was built. When Daneel peels the synthetic flesh off his arm to prove himself, Baley faints (for several reasons).
    -   And then Elijah pulls off his trick in the sequel.
    -   Though Hari Seldon doesn't find out that Dors Venabili is a robot until long after they met.
-   In _Brillo_ by Ben Bova and Harlan Ellison, a Tin-Can Robot is sent to partner with a human detective, but fails to work in practise. The detective is lamenting with an FBI agent how such things will never work out because androids aren't sophisticated enough, when the FBI agent's car door gets stuck and he rips it open with enough strength to bend metal, then the car visibly sags as he sits in it. Maybe the government issue car just used poor quality metal and springs, but there's that sound the robot makes the detective can still hear, even though it's been shut down...
-   _Domina_: Inverted. While in an echo, Jefferies ends up fighting the Erlking, a humanoid about his size covered in ramshackle armor. He assumes it's another echo of a different model. He's very surprised when he rips its mask off and it's a person instead of another machine. As a warlord, the Erlking has been augmented to the point that he can shrug off bullets; fighting a small mech is nothing.
-   _Girls with Sharp Sticks_: All of the girls at Innovations Academy turn out to be Artificial Humans, their brains robotic but their bodies flesh-and-blood. (Purely synthetic Robot Girls were considered, but abandoned due to the Uncanny Valley effect they had on the men who wished to take them as wives.) They learn this upon breaking into the basement medical lab in the hopes of saving Annalise after her mortal injury, where they see one of their classmates, Valentine, on a slab with her head cut open and her metal brain exposed.
-   In _Imposter_ by Philip K. Dick, Olham is suspected of being a robot duplicate assassin but clears himself by showing his pursuer an identical body with metal inside. Until someone pulls out the piece of metal and reveals it to be a dagger, used to murder the real Olham.
-   Played with in the cyberpunk novel _N1MR0D_: The protagonist, Stirling aka N1M, knows from the start that he's an android. Hard not to, when he can make phone calls in his head. The twist is that the _real_ Stirling is, or rather was, flesh and blood. N1M is an android created to be a perfect copy of Stirling Lémieux-Cavendish after he was killed. This shocking truth leads to some philosophical contemplation, whether he is his own person or Stirling reborn.
-   _The Quest for Saint Aquin_ by Anthony Boucher. The quest involves a priest riding an artificially intelligent robot ass to find the incorruptible body of the eponymous saint. When they find Aquin's still-intact body lying in a cave the priest is overjoyed at finding a genuine miracle, until his robass stomps its foot down on the body's hand, which smashes open to reveal that Saint Aquin was actually an android.
-   In "The Sandman (1816)", the main character falls in love with a woman named Olimpia, who is eventually revealed to be a robot.
-   In Fritz Leiber's _Silver Eggheads_, this trope is ridiculed by a robot writer Zane Gort, who writes books for robots (and is not averse to use an Un-Robotic Reveal himself):
    
    **Zane Gort:** You know, it's funny how humans are forever ending stories or episodes with the discovery that the beautiful woman is a robot. Just at the point where it starts to get interesting. And ending it bang without one word of description as to the robot's shape, color, decor, pincher-style and so on, or even telling you whether it's a robot or a robix<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> .
    
-   In "The Eleventh Voyage" of Ijon Tichy, the main character of _The Star Diaries_ by Stanisław Lem, this gets totally inverted; Tichy, sent in a robot disguise to a planet inhabited solely by machines that are hostile to all humanity, discovers in the story's finale that there is no single robot around the place. All of the alleged machines are in fact secret agents like himself, who have been exposed one by one, and forced to keep up appearances. Furthermore: the computer mastermind behind this plot shows up to be merely a humble human gofer working for the agency responsible for sending all those people on a mission to that planet. The story is a parable of living in a country, where everybody upholds the official ideology no one actually believes in, which was the case of People's Republic of Poland at the time when Lem wrote the thing.
-   _Zodiac Series_: Lord Neith, the Guardian of Libra, is actually an android. Hell, he's not even the Guardian; he's a (benevolent) Puppet King to stand in for the actual Guardian, Hysan Dax.

    Live-Action TV 

-   In _Andromeda_, Doyle is revealed to be an android when she cuts her hand and bleeds superconductor fluid. As a small twist, it's revealed to _us_, but not to _her_, since Harper programmed her with a perception filter that causes her to think it's blood.
-   In the _Angel_ episode "Lineage", after Wesley kills his father, the latter is revealed as a robotic replica.
-   _Battlestar Galactica (2003)_ finds plenty of ways to reveal that characters are not quite human:
    -   As artificial humans in this world are mass-produced, a favorite is simply to reveal that (an)other identical version(s) of a character exist(s). This is done with Boomer, Sharon, D'Anna, Cavil and Gina (in the movie).
    -   In the first season we also get the fact that their spines glow when "getting intimate". This was dropped in later seasons (probably because it's pretty stupid and provides a simple "Cylon detector" for humanity).
    -   Caprica Six simply tells Baltar she's an android; as she knows the world is about to be invaded by her fellow killer robots this is not much of a gamble.
    -   Leoben Conoy behaves oddly, is unusually strong and proves vulnerable to exotic radiation.
    -   A marooned Aaron Doral is rescued by his fellow androids.
    -   Simon is seen talking with another, known, android.
    -   Anders, Tyrol, Tory and Tigh are drawn together and mysteriously 'activated' when the Fleet reaches the Ionian Nebula.
    -   Ellen is glimpsed by another android in a vision.
    -   Subverted with Starbuck. There are many hints that she might be an android but the main thing that suggests this e.g. her resurrection is apparently _not_ due to "downloading".
-   In the _Batman (1966)_ episode "The Joker's Last Laugh", Batman realizes there's something strange about a bank teller. He twists the man's nose and the top of his head blows off, revealing springs and other mechanical parts. The teller was actually one of the Joker's android robots.
-   In an episode of _Bionic Woman_, after Jaime rescues a girl from some would-be kidnappers, the girl discovers the exposed wiring of Jaime's arm. In the original series, Jaime herself is horrified when she first tangles with the Fembots; she thinks they're just crazy doppelgangers until she rips one of their faces off during the fray, revealing circuitry and freaky lidless eyeballs. (Her later, delirious warning to Rudy about robots, after they've kicked her ass, is chalked up to bionic rejection. Until Oscar's face suddenly comes off.)
-   _Blake's 7_: In "Headhunter", a cybernetics scientist apparently goes mad and attacks Tarrant, gets hit by a Wrench Whack and apparently dies. Shortly after his body escapes from cryogenic suspension, so they use a bomb to bring most of the ceiling down on his head. Which he's lost after getting to his feet again. Turns out he's an android that killed his creator (as you do) cut off his head and stuck it on his shoulders. His creator had built a robot head with a Morality Chip, but hadn't had time to install it.
-   _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_:
    -   In "Ted", Buffy accidentally 'kills' his mother's boyfriend Ted only for him to come back from the dead without fangs. So Buffy hits him again, this time with an iron skillet, and we get a Facial Horror reveal.
    -   We know that the Buffybot is a robot, but in "Bargaining Part 2" it's revealed to a vampire after he injures her, revealing electronic parts (and causing her to bang into walls). Likewise when Glory knocks the Buffybot's head off in "The Gift".
        
        **Glory:** _(confused)_ The Slayer's a robot? Did everybody else know the Slayer was a robot?
        
    -   Unnecessary for April in "I Was Made to Love You". Her behavior makes it perfectly clear to everyone that she's a robot. Which makes it Everybody Knew Already when her creator Warren tells Buffy something she "couldn't possibly know".
-   At one point, a character in _Cybervillage_ grows a bit annoyed with his wife, so he puts her on a pause, revealing that she is a hologram.
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "The Android Invasion": Sarah Jane Smith's face comes off to reveal that she's been replaced by a robot.
    -   "The Beast Below": The Winders, the secret police, are revealed to be half-Smiler when they rotate their heads around.
    -   "Victory of the Daleks": Professor Edwin Bracewell's hand gets shot off by a Dalek, revealing him to be a robotic creation of theirs, so that in turn the Daleks would have proof that Bracewell "created" them. They also made him a bomb.
    -   "The Pandorica Opens": The Romans (including the apparently Back from the Dead Rory) are revealed to be Auton duplicates when they're activated by a control signal and produce their Arm Cannons.
    -   "Robot of Sherwood": Robin Hood cuts off the arm of one of the Sheriff's knights during the fight at the archery contest. Inside are gears.
    -   "The Pilot": In the first scene, the Doctor's assistant Nardole walks on-screen sounding _very_ creaky, and has a bolt fall out of his sleeve when he extends his hand to Bill, which he quickly tries to cover up — revealing just exactly how the Doctor put him back together after he was reduced to just a head in his first appearance.
-   _Farscape_:
    -   Aeryn is kidnapped and replaced with a bioloid copy — which is unveiled when Crichton gets wise and shoots her in the head, revealing pulsating organic machinery beneath the ruined face.
    -   Sikozu reveals herself to be a bioloid as well by rotating her left eye 120 degrees as a signal to another bioloid.
-   _Get Smart_: Hymie the robot was created by a KAOS scientist, and impersonated a CONTROL agent at a function. Max had no idea Hymie was a robot, even when he opened his shirt to show his mechanical works - Max just thought it was a clever ruse.
-   _Loki (2021)_: In Episode 4, Loki and Sylvie finally confront the Time Keepers and behead one of them... and discover that they're robots, controlled by whoever really controls the TVA.
-   _The Outer Limits (1963)_: At the end of the episode "Demon with a Glass Hand", Trent discovers that he is a virtually immortal cyborg.
-   _The Outer Limits (1995)_: Several of the robot-centric episodes:
    -   In "Valerie 23", the invalid Hank is confused as to why none of his colleagues tried hitting on the rather attractive girl he was just introduced to. He quickly finds out why when they take him to a side room where a group of scientists are working on the wiring inside the gynoid's exposed skull.
    -   In "Resurrection", two scientists are breeding a grown man in what appears to be an embryonal sac in their basement. One of the scientists accidentally gets some fluid on his face, and goes upstairs to clean up. His colleague then removes his face plate to reveal that they're both androids. This is followed by an Internal Reveal for the new human in a later scene.
    -   In "Mary 25", it turns out that "Teryl" is in fact a robot replacement who has convinced the protagonist to kill her unfaithful husband, who was cheating on her with another robot.
    -   In "Glitch", Tom Seymour is horrified to discover that he is an android. He was created by Joe Walker for use in disaster areas so that no humans would be harmed. However, the project was taken away from Walker, who later died, by the US government. The new project leader Dr. Edward Normandy is running tests on Tom to ensure that he is ready for his new purpose: infiltration and assassination. Wendy Seymour, Tom's supposed wife and a member of Normandy's team, helps him to escape as she has come to disapprove of the work that Normandy is doing. They go to see Walker's widow Sylvia, who reveals to a disbelieving Wendy that she too is an android, the first that Joe created. Wendy is even more dismayed by the revelation of her true nature than Tom was but, like him, comes to accept it. Joe modelled Tom and Wendy on younger versions of himself and Sylvia.
-   _Power Rangers_:
    -   _Power Rangers Turbo_ had an episode where the Blue Ranger Justin suspects that the other four Rangers have been replaced by robots. As it turns out, he's right. The real sting? Justin HIMSELF is revealed to be a robot like them, when the real Justin shows up to deactivate him.
    -   _Power Rangers Lost Galaxy_ reveals that the non-monster forms of the Psycho Rangers were mechanical after most of them get destroyed in the crossover with the _In Space_ team. It's left ambiguous as to whether or not their monster bodies were also robotic, or if these were simply bodies created for them to inhabit.
    -   In _Power Rangers S.P.D._, new cadet Sophie is discovered to be a robot when the Rangers walk in on her repairing the circuitry in her arm.
    -   _Power Rangers Operation Overdrive_: Red Ranger Mack is revealed to be a robot built by his "father" after a computer virus that infects the Rangers' base afflicts him as well, and he's forced to be taken off-line and disassembled to get at the problem. Needless to say, he wasn't very happy about it.
    -   _Power Rangers RPM_ inverts this. Tenaya 7 is convinced she is a machine, until a cut in a fight reveals she bleeds. The camera angles play with this trope, mimicking its straight use and treating the blood as if it was the tell-tale sparking wires. In fact, the straight usage had happened earlier in the same episode to a part of her body that _was_ mechanical, though it was likely to emphasize that she did have robot parts. There's also the finale, where it's revealed that around half of the citizens in Corinth are sleeper agent cyborgs, and Venjix is just about to activate them.
-   _Red Dwarf_: In "Out of Time", Lister gets his arm cut, revealing mechanical parts. Not only mechanical, but of a model inferior to Kryten, which means Kryten technically outranks him! The whole thing is then beautifully subverted when it turns out that Lister's mechanical "nature" is the result of Starbug having hit an "unreality pocket", turning Kryten briefly into a gibbering idiot as he attempts to apologize for his mis-step.
-   _The Six Million Dollar Man_: In the first-season episode "Day of the Robot", Steve Austin is traveling with Major Fred Sloane to a test of a new secret weapon when Sloane is kidnapped and replaced with a _very_ realistic robot double. The robot is as strong as Austin, and the episode ends with a showdown fight between them. Austin still thinks he's fighting a human, until he slams "Sloane" across the face and sends the robot's face mask flying away.
-   In a _Sliders_ episode, the lead researcher for developing Mechanical Life Forms wanted to test out a way to transfer a human brain into a robot. He discovered that the procedure was already performed on himself when he was hit by a weapon.
-   There was a _Stargate SG-1_ episode where this was combined with a Tomato in the Mirror, Jack or rather his robotic copy goes in for a medical exam, the doc can't detect a heartbeat, the blood she draws comes out milky-white, and eventually he takes a scalpel to his own arm and uncovers pistons and wires. And a sequel to this episode: One of the villain's followers started doubting his godhood because said "god" looked surprised after killing an android.
-   _Star Trek_:
    -   _Star Trek: The Original Series_:
        -   Dr. Roger Korby at the end of the episode "What Are Little Girls Made Of?" (along with a minor earlier example when a character realized that she'd been talking to Kirk's android duplicate rather than Kirk himself).
        -   Norman at the start of "I, Mudd".
        -   Rayna at the end of "Requiem for Methuselah".
    -   _Star Trek: The Next Generation_:
        -   In "Inheritance", Data's creator's wife shows up, and while she's down on a planet, she falls and turns out to be an android herself (created after the death of the original woman and given her template's memories, also programmed to eventually 'die' after a certain point).
        -   In the episode "Thine Own Self", Data is amnesiac because of (nonvisible) damage, and has gone native. An injury shows the circuitry under his skin, much to the shock of all (Data himself included).
-   _Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles_:
    
    -   In the second season premiere, Catherine Weaver seems to be an ordinary Corrupt Corporate Executive who has obtained the Turk and plans to develop it. Then the head of her company's AI division starts badmouthing her in the men's room. As soon as he's alone, a liquid-metal type Terminator peels itself off the urinal and turns into Catherine Weaver, who kills the man with a liquid metal finger-poke and a Bond One-Liner.
    
    -   Cameron has a more subtle way of revealing herself, simply by lighting up the irises of her eyes. In this case, though, she is talking with someone who already knows Terminators exist.
-   _Total Recall 2070_: Detective Farve is revealed to be inhuman when he regenerates his arms' skin after having it burnt/melted by high voltage cables. He then explains that he's an Alpha android, a prototype Ridiculously Human Robot using Wetware CPU.
-   _The Twilight Zone (1959)_: Played with in the episode "The Lonely". A prisoner kept in exile on an isolated asteroid is given a Robot Girl for company, which he falls in love with and refuses to abandon when he's acquitted, insisting that she's a woman with feelings and not Just a Machine. To force the issue, the captain sent to pick him up shoots the robot in the face, exposing her circuits as well as causing fatal damage.
-   _Ultra Series_:

    -   The _Ultraman 80_ monster, Silver Zatan, looks and sounds like a dinosaur, save for it's metallic-looking skin. But after Ultraman Eighty lands a few consecutive kicks into Zatan's shoulder, breaking it's surface, it's then revealed that Zatan is actually a machine created by the Zatan Aliens, it's interior being made of wiring and gears.
    -   _Ultraman Tiga_: When GUTS and Tiga are faced with a tunneling shark kaiju called Geozark, they discover the creature is actually a machine when they manage to scar its sides. The team is left completely baffled and wonder who built the robot, which Daigo (Tiga's host) later learns was Corrupt Corporate Executive Keigo Masaki in order to tunnel out the tomb of a second Ultraman.
-   _Westworld_:
    -   Worried over how his brother-in-law William is falling for the host Dolores, Logan cuts her stomach open to show her robotic insides to remind him she's Just a Machine. This is a Wham Shot for different reasons than usual for this trope, because while viewers already knew that the hosts were artificial, her insides being purely mechanical rather than the lifelike synthetic muscles and organs of modern hosts shows the William/Logan plot is taking place in Westworld's past.
    -   The park's Head of Behavior Management, Bernard, is actually a host based on Ford's dead partner, Arnold. This actually explains why he's very loyal to Ford because he follows his commands which includes eliminating anyone who is a threat to his plans.

    Tabletop Games 

-   _Deadlands_: There are rules governing this reveal _vis-à-vis_ Cyborgs in _Deadlands: Hell on Earth_ and _Lost Colony_, particularly if the deadbot in question is equipped with the "Infiltrator" package, which makes a normally pallid cadaver-with-metal-in-its-guts capable of breathing normally, bleeding, eating, and other things. When a cyborg takes enough damage, nearby characters can make a check to see if they notice anything unusual in the wound, with the roll being easier if...
    
    _...Your can is continuing to fight after taking enough damage to drop a bull rhino._
    
-   _Fallout: The Board Game_: In one of the missions, a courier approaches the player character and may reveal they are a synth.

-   In _Baten Kaitos Origins,_ the one with robotic innards is Milliarde.
-   _Bay Route_ have it's second-to-last boss, a heavily-armed Scary Black Man who can absorb quite some punishment before going down. At which point he sheds his skin to reveal his interiors to be robotic, before he explodes.
-   _Binary Domain_: The premise of the game is that a new genertion of robots have been constructed that are so realistic, the robots believe themselves to be human, and gennuinly do not know they are robots. Due to this there are several robotic reveals through the game, often accompanied by the robot in question being damaged badly enough to reveal the robotic parts underneath the organic outer tissue.
-   Subverted in _Bionic Heart_. When Luke first meets Tanya, she has had half her face blown off by the police pursuing her, revealing the mechanical parts underneath her skin.
-   The _BioShock 2_ DLC _Minerva's Den_ casts the player as the Big Daddy "Subject Sigma," tasked to make a copy of Rapture's mainframe computer, The Thinker. Over the course of the story, Sigma is informed of the The Thinker's design and evolution (as well as the reason that a copy needs to be smuggled out of Rapture) by its inventor, Charles Milton Porter. Sigma eventually learns that The Thinker was able to mimic human patterns to the point that it developed de facto artificial intelligence. The climax of the DLC reveals that the version of Porter who has been speaking to Subject Sigma is The Thinker impersonating its creator. Porter is actually Subject Sigma, whose memories have been erased by the Big Daddy transformation, and part of the heist of The Thinker is an effort to restore him to his former self.

-   A major contact in the _Pandora's Box_ storyline in _City of Heroes_ turns out to be a highly sophisticated Nemesis automaton. Even he did not know it.
-   Done with a twist in _Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath_, where it is revealed that the player is a Nod AI named LEGION. Presumably, LEGION was aware of its nature the whole time, but the player doesn't until Kane makes the revelation himself.
-   _Conker's Bad Fur Day_, being the Shout-Out\-heavy game it is, throws one out to Terminator with the Haybot, who looks like your average musclebound anthropomorphic stack of hay until you stick Frankie's forks in his ass twice, at which point part of him burns away to reveal the ever-familiar image of a robotic red eye. "**BUFF YOU, ASSHOLE!**"
-   Several human-like mooks in _Cyber-Lip_ will shed their skin upon being killed, revealing their robotic interiors, before exploding.
-   _Detroit: Become Human_ plays with this regarding Kara, in that she's revealing to other characters, not the player, that she's an android. She performs this reveal when introducing herself to Rose, the leader of an android Underground Railroad, by deactivating part of her synthetic skin, and in an earlier scene she has the option to do this with fellow android Ralph in order to gain his trust.
    -   Towards the end of Kara's story, she discovers that Alice, the little girl she was looking after and cared for as a daughter, is actually another android. She realizes that she had repressed her memory of finding an advertisement for a child android of Alice's likeness, because she was so invested in the idea of caring for a human child.
    -   During the final chapter, several seemingly human background characters are revealed to be androids after they're subjected to a temperature check, prompting the use of lethal force against them. Kara's group can suffer a similar fate if she's not careful.
-   In _DRAMAtical Murder_, Clear is revealed to be an android.
-   In _Dungeon Fighter Online_ it is ultimately revealed that the leader of the notorious criminal Kartels, Boss Enzo, actually died a long time ago and has since been replaced permanently by the Chief Kartel Scientist with a powerful missile-launching, electricity-wielding terminator-like killer Cyborg.
-   In _Echo Night Beyond_ the young man is revealed to be a robotic copy of Kenneth, a man who was killed. Also, Richard, the player character is a robotic copy of the real Richard (aka. the space station chief) made by his fiancée (who was in love with the real Richard when he died).
-   _Fallout_:
    -   _Fallout 3_: A quest in Rivet City, in the Capital Wasteland, has you looking for an escaped android with fake memories and a new face. As it turns out, the android is the very first person you meet in the city, Chief Harkness.
    -   Also in _Fallout 3_, John Henry Eden, President Evil of the Enclave who broadcasts via radio to the Capital Wasteland about how the Enclave will return and rebuild America, is revealed to be Raven Rock's pre-War ZAX Artificial Intelligence who became self-aware. Even the rest of the Enclave is unaware of this.
    -   Any post-_Old World Blues_ Random Encounters in _Fallout: New Vegas_ double as this and Mook Horror Show. Imagine that you’ve been tasked with bringing down a profligate who, after going off the grid for weeks, has finally turned up somewhere southwest of Vegas. Your team tracks him through the wilderness, noting that his footprints are heavier than normal and that he must be carrying an extra load. You find him wandering through the desert at midday, seemingly unburdened by either the extra load or the sun, and scope him down with the anti-materiel rifle (Why they sent this with you for one man, Caesar only knows). His head finally centered in the crosshairs, you pull the trigger, expecting a grisly red mist and the muted thump of a fresh corpse on the sand. Instead, you’re treated to an audible, metallic ricochet and the cold gaze of a newly-forged demigod. As he closes the distance to your contubernium with inhuman speed, you’re not sure the anti-materiel rifle was _enough_.
    -   Another one in _Fallout 4_: Danse, the kill-all-synths Brotherhood paladin, is the very thing he pledged his life to kill. The best part? He doesn't even figure out himself until his commanding officers order his death, meaning he has a robotic reveal of _himself_.
    -   Also from _4_: Deacon didn't realize his beloved was a synth until the anti-synth gang he used to run with killed her for being a synth. When he tells you this, it is one of the precious few times when he is NOT a Consummate Liar.
-   One of the millions of twists in _Ghost Trick_ is that the Big Bad's assistant is an AI.
-   _Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure's_ ending has you fighting Weasleby for a while before he suddenly twitches with electricity coming off him and his head falls out. And then Cole pops out from the remains to reveal himself as The Man Behind the Man.
-   _Jitsu Squad_ have the reveal of the game's main villain, Lord Origami, who appears as a gigantic, demonic-looking face until you damaged him enough, revealing his interiors to be a metal skull. So you've been spending the whole game battling a robotic demon sorcerer?
-   _Karate Blazers_ have mooks in Hazmat Suits in the factory stages, which are later on replaced by robots in suits which appears to be human until you beat them down. Then they explode, blowing off their suits, and revealing their metal exoskeletons which continues fighting you.
-   _Last Alert_ has Dr. Garcia.
-   Not explicitly said, but in _Marathon_, The Security Officer is heavily implied to be a cybernetic warrior created from the corpse of a soldier
-   A minor reveal in _Mass Effect 3_: after chasing down a Cerberus agent on Mars, Vega rams her with a shuttle. Cue her emerging Out of the Inferno... her clothes and skin burned off the robotic frame by the explosion.
-   Seen among the mooks of the arcade/NES gunner _Mechanized Attack_, after laying a few hits on the ones that _don't_ take just one to kill.
-   _Mega Man_:
    -   Dr. Wily at the next-to-last level of _Mega Man 3_. Although it's kind of easy to tell because they play the regular level-ending song. It did surprise some people because this was only the first game where the bad guy was "Not-Wily".
    -   In the ending of _Mega Man 9_, Mega Man is about to free Dr. Light from the cell when Proto Man shows up to inform him that's actually a robot of him in there (And was in fact used to make the fake video of him declaring a Face–Heel Turn to Dr. Wily), and that it's a trap. Mega Man goes to help the robot anyway for the reason of it being one, and it ends up frying him and knocking him out.
-   _Metal Gear_:
    -   In _Snake's Revenge_, Big Boss reveals before the final battle that he was turned into a cyborg. After he sustains enough damage, he transforms into a tall cyborg who chases after Snake across several rooms.
    -   Inverted in _Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake_. In an optional radio call during the final battle, Kasler tells Snake that Big Boss underwent an operation to replace his limbs with cybernetic organs.

    -   Somewhat played with in _Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots_, right before the final boss fight with him, Ocelot dramatically removes his jacket to reveal that Liquid's arm has been replaced with a bio-mechanical prosthetic, hinting that "Liquid" was artificial.
    -   Also inverted in _Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance_. In a cast full of superhuman cyborgs, The Dragon Jetstream Sam is cut open to reveal that he's a normal human with almost no cybernetic enhancements.

-   _Ninja Commando_ have a fire-breathing dinosaur-dragon hybrid monster boss in the prehistoric stage, which appears to follow the Dinosaurs Are Dragons trope. Until you damage it enough, ripping off the monster's skin and revealing it's interior to be a robot.
-   Used to good effect in _Paranoiascape_. As the whole game is in first-person, it's not until the final cutscene where you're revealed to be a sentient, clockwork doll.
-   In _Persona 4: Arena_, when Labrys' Shadow reveals itself, it forcibly removes Labrys' human guise to reveal to everyone that she is actually a robot.

-   Before the final boss in _Rocket Power: Beach Bandits_ Eric Golem Sr. was revealed to be a robot created by Eric Golem Jr.

-   _Snatcher_ has Random - it comes as a surprise to himself as well.
-   Two examples in the Survival Horror game _SOMA_; Catherine is revealed early on to be a robot herself even though she says that robots don't feel anything, and look at yourself, Simon; you're a woman's corpse stuffed into a diving suit, implanted with a neural chip and lined with circuitry.
-   In the first _Sonic Advance_, halfway through the fight with Mecha Knuckles, his outer covering breaks off to reveal his metallic body.
-   In _Starbound_, the Glitch are robots programmed to believe that they (and other Glitches around them) are normal organic beings, and block out anything that would disprove this. Sometimes, the system fails and they realize the truth... and usually have to flee for their lives, as the rest of the simulation will try to prevent the error from spreading.
-   In _Streets of Rage 3_'s Stage 5, you fight Mr. X. Why are you only on the _fifth_ stage when you fight him?

The real Mr. X, who you encounter in Stage 7 (assuming you rescued the Chief of Police), has been reduced to a brain.
-   In _Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People_, near the end of "Dangeresque 3: The Criminal Projective", Dangeresque Too's Evil Twin Uzi Bazooka reveals himself as a robot after being shot.

-   _Tanzer_ has many Mini-Boss opponents (the man being burnt at the stake, the guillotine victim, etc.) appearing to be humans. But when you approach, they suddenly shed their fleshy exterior and start spamming projectile attacks like other robot enemies.
-   The 1988 Strip Poker computer game _Teenage Queen_ has this as a twist ending: If you get the girl to take off every article of clothing she has, but still keep playing, she rips off her skin to reveal a robotic body underneath.
-   In _Terminator 2: Judgment Day_ (the arcade tie-in to the film), you play as the heroic T-800 and could encounter enemy T-800s in the 2029 stages, still bearing the flesh and blood likeness of Arnold Schwarzenegger. When shot they lose their skin and reveals their robotic interiors.
-   _Terminator Rampage_ does this with the "Infiltrator"-type robots, appearing to be regular humans caught in the robot attack only to suddenly shoot at you when you try approaching. Shoot them back and they lose their skin, revealing their mechanical insides.
-   In _Tomb Raider Chronicles_, in the final level you encounter suited henchmen who seem extremely tough, after causing enough damage it is revealed that they are Cyborgs and must be killed by alternative means to shooting.
-   Played straight with the final boss of the first _Turok_ game. The Campaigner at first appears to be some sort of barbarian wizard, but as he takes damage his flesh peels off to expose his robotic structure. In some ways there is a subversion of this trope, as the player has already cut down legions of "real" humans by this point.
-   One of the proposed endings for the 2012 reboot of _Twisted Metal_ would've had Dollface reveal to be a robot sent by the Preacher that he would blow up in an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Calypso.

This trope also happens in one of the paths when Sigma's arm is cut and a white fluid comes out of it. By the ending of the path, it is revealed that he has cybernetic arms, but the rest of him is human .
-   _Warframe_: Inverted. Warframes require four separate blueprints, are built and assembled in a foundry, and can be modified just like any other weapon. Many people, in-universe and out, assumed them to be robots, or at the very least Powered Armor. This went further in "The Second Dream," when it was revealed that the Tenno were piloting the warframes from a distance. As it turns out though, the warframes were originally humans, horrifically mutated by a controlled version of the Technocyte Plague. The plague merges biological and mechanical systems, so any cybernetics the human hosts had were integrated into their frames, but in the end they are mostly biological. This was the point, as the robotic Sentients could subvert traditional Orokin technology.
-   One of the characters in the first _Wild ARMs_ game is revealed to be not quite what they seem after he cuts off his arm to get away from the Big Bad. When the others treat the injury, sparks fly out, and they discover that his insides were made of the same properties as the Metal Demons.
-   In _Wonder Boy in Monster Land_, the dragon you've come all this way to slay is revealed to be a robot, possibly from space.
-   _Xenoblade Chronicles X_: When the player character throws themselves in front of Tatsu to protect them from an enemy Skell attack, their arm is blasted off, revealing metal, sparks, and blue bio-electric fluid where their arm used to be. As it turns out, they are actually a highly advanced android controlled via a human consciousness from within the core of the Lifehold. So are Elma, Lin, and _every other_ person in New LA. You were never told because it was such a basic fact of the colonization mission that Elma never realized you didn't know it.
-   _X-Kaliber 2097_ has the boss, Chainsaw, who appears human at first until you defeat him. He then explodes, sheds his human skin, and turns out to be a SkeleBot 9000 underneath with a chainsaw for an arm.

-   _RWBY_:
    -   Penny has skin torn from her hands after she stops a truck from hitting Ruby, revealing metal underneath.

    Webcomics

-   _Sluggy Freelance_:
    -   In the end of "The Island fo Dr. Steve", the brainwashed gymnastic assassin Oasis, who's being controlled by Mad Scientist Dr. Steve, is revealed to be a Robot Girl built by Steve... Or so Torg understands Dr. Steve's words, anyway. He'll be wondering just what she is for the next twenty years of webcomic.
    -   In "Jane Doe", Torg freaks out after seeing Oasis in a hospital, followed by this exchange:
        
        **Doctor:** You sure seemed to know her. And you mumbled something about "mind control" and a "robot" before passing out.  
        **Torg:** Oh, I.. uh... I was thinking of Al Gore when I said it. Just always been curious.  
        **Doctor:** We keep our patients' records confidential, so I can't confirm or deny anything.

    **Makube**: And so, after travelling all over Europe and America-Classic and doing _countless_ hours of research in the halls of the Vatican and Wikipedia... we _still_ do not know how or why he was a cyborg.  
    **Integra**: EXCUSES! Go to America-Zero and don't come back until you've got answers!

When he's eventually caught, the heroes discover they only captured a decoy. He returns for a second run, with mechanical copies of the titular character and his boss, but this time, they catch him for real. As a matter of fact, Hanna-Barbera loves this trope for some odd reason, taking it so far, that sometimes, the main villain of the episode turns out to be one. Nobody seems to question where the robot came from or who built it.

-   In _Sealab 2021_ Quinn reveals in an episode that he is a robot. This isn't mentioned again afterwards and was thought to just be a wacky joke since there's Negative Continuity. But then a later episode mentioned it again. I guess they don't really seem to care much.
-   _The Simpsons_: In "Thanksgiving of Horror", this is used at the end of the second segment as the punchline to speech by Homer.
    
    **Homer:** Our world blurs the line between humanity and technology. Our society asks "_Can_ we do it?" instead of "_Should_ we do it?". But don't worry, I still love you... love you... love you... love you... _(his face falls off to reveal machinery behind it)_
    
    **Marge:** Well, this just makes you forgetting my birthday even _worse_.
    
-   _South Park_
    -   Inverted in "AWESOME-O" where Cartman's robot disguise (consisting of a couple of cardboard boxes) manages to fool nearly everybody until he gives the game away by farting.
    -   Also played straight in the "Trapper Keeper" episode.
-   The _Spider-Man (1981)_ episode "The Doctor Prescribes Doom" had Spider-Man at one point accidentally knock Robbie Robertson out the window, revealing him to be a robot double when he crashes to the ground and breaks into pieces. Spidey doesn't notice this, however, and initially believes that he's killed the real Robbie Robertson, a concern that isn't set aside until he meets up with the real Robbie Robertson, mistakes _him_ for a robot double, and tears off his shirt to expose his human chest.
-   In _Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!_, we have Jinmay. Funny thing is, she was just as surprised as we were.
-   Above quote is the titular _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ first encounter with their most common Mecha-Mooks in the first cartoon series. Despite Leonardo actually slicing one, Michelangelo's exclamation seems to imply they had been previously holding back.
    -   _Turtles Forever_, the crossover between the first two TMNT cartoons, has a reveal when the 2003 Turtles learn the 1987 Foot Soldiers are robots.
        
        **2003 Leonardo:** Robots?  
        **2003 Michelangelo:** _\[enthusiastic\]_ _Exploding_ robots.
        
-   The _Teen Titans (2003)_ episode "Masks" first introduces Slade's trademark mooks, who dress decidedly like ninjas. At the end of the first fight with them, though, Robin rips the mask off one of them, revealing the robotic circuitry beneath. Later episodes also had "Slade" being revealed as one of his android doubles, with the real Slade speaking through them from an unknown location. Averted with other Mecha-Mooks later in the series — the robot soldiers that served Brother Blood and the Brain were clearly shown to be machines from their first appearances.
-   Sari Sumdac from _Transformers: Animated_, ends up with a chunk of her elbow missing, with Cybertronian circuitry poking out. This one was just as much a surprise to her as everyone else, except her "father".
-   In the Wallace & Gromit short _A Close Shave_, when Preston (who, in a world with anthropormorphic dogs like Gromit, didn't look out of place) is put into the sheep-shearing device, wool is actually able to be extracted from him. Sure enough, a metallic hand busts through the door of the machine shortly after, and the Robot Dog emerges stripped to the metal.
-   In the _Xiaolin Showdown_ episode "Omi Town", Omi's "parents" turn out to be robots build by Jack Spicer and made to look like Omi's relatives with Hannibal's Moby Morpher.
-   In the _X-Men: The Animated Series_ four-parter "The Dark Phoenix Saga", Donald Pierce reveals that he's a cyborg by tearing his sleeve from his robotic arm.
-   In _Young Justice (2010)_ Professor T.O. Morrow is revealed to be a robot when Red Volcano kills him. The real Morrow is dying in hospital, having built a robot duplicate to carry on his work. It subverts Comic-Book Time in the process, as Morrow had been active since World War II without seeming to age.
