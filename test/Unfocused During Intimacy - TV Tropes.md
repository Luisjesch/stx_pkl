A character is having a sexual or a romantic moment with another character. However, one of them, or neither, may not be completely into it.

This may be because:

-   When the two are engaging in sexual intimacy or romantic moments we see them having flashbacks/thoughts of another character. They may even have literally imagined their current partner as that one specific character. If a character suffered personal heartbreak over a relationship of any kind with someone and this trope occurs it can sometimes mean that said character is On the Rebound. It could also mean that they are still holding feelings for that one character but may be trying to forget them to avoid further pain.
-   One (or both) of them are thinking of something else. The person may simply be not into sex (at least at the time), or they like something Better than Sex, or they're thinking of more important matters.

As variants of the trope: Lie Back and Think of England is a woman thinking about other things during sex out of boredom, Think Unsexy Thoughts is thinking about something other than sex to delay climax, and the sex-related variant of Wrong-Name Outburst is imagining a different partner during sex and calling their name instead.

Compare and contrast Coitus Uninterruptus, where someone nonchalantly multitasks (or deals with incoming matters) during sex. See also Lousy Lovers Are Losers for one possible explanation.

    Anime & Manga 

-   Somewhat implied but not confirmed with Griffith in _Berserk_ who is believed by a few people to have some manner of feelings towards his best warrior/friend in his army, Guts. When the latter leaves to find his own dream Griffith immediately seeks out sex with Princess Charlotte to make himself feel better about the loss of Guts, even thinking about only him during sex with her.
-   _Black Butler_: It is shown that Alois has feelings for his butler Claude and longs for him through his trials. When he has flashbacks to seducing Lord Trancy and being molested by him he reveals how he would think of Claude to help keep his sanity during this. It is really Trancy who thinks the moment is meant to be romantic and sensual, disturbingly, considering Alois is quite young, and he considered Alois's attempt at seduction to be genuine.
-   To further Dio and Jonathan's Belligirent Sexual Tension in the first part of Jojos Bizarre Adventure, Dio decides to come on to and take the Sacred First Kiss of Erina who is the beloved of Jonathan. He does this to drive the two away from each other, and get at Jonathan, and Erina understandably can only express how disgusting she thinks Dio is for thinking he could come between them.
-   _Outlaw Star_: Harry tries to generate a romantic moment between himself and Melfina but she is developing feelings for Gene. Harry picks up on her thinking of Gene and gets jealous.
-   _PandoraHearts_: It is implied that Vincent has feelings deeper than brotherly affection for his brother Gil. In chapter 34 Vincent is coming on to Lotti and in the midst of doing so, he wonders what kind of expression Gil would have if he found out he's in league with the Baskervilles. He states he would love whatever expression Gil would display. Also, when Vincent is on a date with Ada he thinks about how annoying she is and wonders how Gil would react if he decided to taint her. He thinks about how he wants to see his angry expression and informs Ada that he's jealous of Elliot for having Gil's attention.
-   _Peach Girl_: Momo is in a Love Triangle with Touji and Kairi. In one scene, Touji gives her the ultimatum of choosing between him or Kairi. In the midst of being kissed or about to have sex with Touji, in the anime and manga respectively, her mind goes to Kairi. Touji notices the tears going down her face and comes to the I Want My Beloved to Be Happy conclusion.
-   _Revolutionary Girl Utena_ has a partial example. There's a sex scene between Akio and Utena in episode 33, confirmed by the shot of her naked shoulder and their hands intertwined on a bed. However, she's fourteen years old and he's way older than her, and then there's the topic of discussion. You won't be thinking of sandwiches the same way again for a good while afterwards. All the more nightmarish when you see her gasping in pain and kanji reading afterwards "Stop it...stop it...stop it...". It's like she's desperately trying to retain her composure and get her mind off of the dubious situation with Akio by talking about what she should make for lunch tomorrow or trying to deflect Akio's attention and ministrations on her by mentioning Anthy and how she needs to leave to make lunch. It also so happens that she and Anthy end up as the Official Couple by the series(or at least the film) end, hence her focus on Anthy during the sex scene. Also, more G-rated versions arise when we see plenty of guys, like Touga and Akio, get her involved in a romantic scene with them but all she can think of and worry about is Anthy.
-   Say "I Love You": Aiko's early spotlight showed that she long obsessed over what Yamato meant to her and her poor self-esteem, to the extent that she would imagine that she was having sex with Yamato when she was sleeping with other people. Part of her development was learning to let go of that mental image she had of him.
-   _The Vision of Escaflowne_: Hitomi is in the middle of a Love Triangle between Van and Allen and when she is having romantic moments with Allen her mind always seems to go back to Van, after she falls for Van of course. She also thinks of her crush on Earth who looks just like Allen when in his presence.
-   _Wolf Guy - Wolfen Crest_: Haguro and Ryuuko are evil versions. Haguro has a fixation on Inugami to the point of it being a sexual obsession, all of which started when the latter bested him in his werewolf form. He wants to beat Inugami down and prove himself the superior beast. To make himself feel powerful he has violent sex with his girlfriend Ryuuko (who lusts after and thinks of Inugami during sex with Haguro) and has an orgasm while screaming Inugami's name. He also rapes the hell out of his male subordinate while, again, thinking about Inugami and how this is a punishment for him. And then there is his raping Aoshika while recording it so that Inugami can see, practically talking to the camera (and, therefore, to Inugami) through the entire thing so that Inugami will come back to him. When he finally gets his hands on Inugami, he mutilates him, starting with two fingers that he eats and _gets a boner from doing so_ because he feels a rush from feeling himself a superior badass to Inugami. He also throws himself on his sword just to be able to hold Inugami close.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   _A Clockwork Orange_: The Film does this in a way to Alex's debauchery (involving sex and violence usually) he gets up to that he does so much it is always on his brain as well as his love of Beethoven. As such, when he has a consensual three-way with a couple of girls pre-Technique, it is sped up and set to the William Tell Overture with hilarious results that underscore how little sex means to him, it's just something to pass the time and his mind is always on violence.

-   In _The Notebook_, Allie is torn on choosing between her fiancé Lon and Noah the man she had a summer-long passionate relationship with. She got engaged to Lon as she did fall for him but that was also partially because she thought Noah wasn't interested in her anymore. As it turns out, Noah had sent her love letters every day for a year but her mother intercepted them. The truth comes out and they rekindle their passionate relationship. When Lon finds out, he is heartbroken, as he loves Allie and wants to be with her. As he explains it to her, he knows she is madly in love with Noah and that he has to let her go. Lon knows she will never stop thinking about Noah even if she and him did continue with their original plans and get married. Which is what he meant when he told her he doesn't want to have to convince his fiancée that she should be with him and that whatever he does won't win him her hand.
-   _Seeds of Yesterday_: Bart beds Melodie shortly after Cindy catches him spying on her while she's at the pool. Later, he visits a brothel and selects a prostitute who resembles Cindy.

-   In Jessica Stevens' book _Within Reach_, Lila has a boyfriend Xan who dies but lives on as a ghost and tries to show Lila she isn't alone, while she struggles to comprehend how her life has changed without him. Six months ago her life was perfect: she was on her way to becoming a professional dancer, her parents were still married, and her boyfriend was alive. But now, with her anorexic tendencies stronger than ever, she must decide between letting go to be with a boy she doesn't love or holding on to the unreasonable yet overpowering feeling that Xan is still within reach and loves her...and is trying to show her something.
-   Count Lionel Savignac from _Reflections of Eterna_ is exceptionally good at this. While he sleeps around as much as expected from an unmarried noble to keep up appearances, he is uninterested in most women and mentally checks out during sex to think about his political schemes and war plans. Because he is so good at lying, only one woman, Baroness Marianne, has ever realized what he was doing, and when she demanded him to either "be here completely", or to leave, he chose the latter and sent her an expensive gift the next morning — not to get back into her good graces (they have never met afterwards), but as an apology for getting caught.
-   In the second _Xanth_ novel, King Trent confides that, since he's still mourning his first wife, he doesn't think that he can actually have sex with his new, politically-chosen queen, Iris. The obvious solution—using magic to make Iris look like his dead wife—is rejected out of hand. Bink then makes the suggestion of changing _both_ of their appearances and pretending to be completely different people, which works.

Lestat, who had been showering Louis' neck and chest with kisses, notices that his boyfriend isn't in the moment, so he stops and speaks Louis' name to try to regain his attention. Louis then kisses Lestat on the mouth, but once Lestat resumes his amorous exploration of his lover's body, Louis remains visibly dissociated from the intimate act even after Claudia ends their psychic communication.

    Music 

-   "Missing You" by Ingrid Michaelson definitely has this.
    
    _He's got his hands in all the right places  
    But the wrong face is in front of me  
    I close my eyes and see it so clearly  
    But you're not here and it's killing me  
    And I can feel you through the static  
    You're in my head again  
    I can't get you out  
    I try but you just never move  
    I'm in his bed again  
    Feeling like a stranger  
    When he's kissing me, I'm missing you  
    Kissing me, I'm missing you  
    He's kissing me, I'm missing you  
    Kissing me, I'm missing you  
    You lay beside me in my bedroom  
    Never made a move but I wanted to  
    You sleep and I stared at the ceiling  
    Counting my feelings, they were all for you_
    
-   Keith Whitley's "Don't Close Your Eyes":
    
    _Don't close your eyes  
    Let it be me  
    Don't pretend it's him  
    In some fantasy  
    Darling, just once let yesterday go  
    And you'll find more love  
    Than you've ever known  
    Just hold me tight  
    When you love me tonight  
    And don't close your eyes_
