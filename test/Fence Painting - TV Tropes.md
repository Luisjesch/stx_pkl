Today's Tom Sawyer, he will ply on you  
And these trades he is making get by on you

**Calvin:** Can I run the vacuum cleaner?  
**Calvin's Mom:** No. Not until you're older.  
**Calvin:** I'm old enough! I could do it!  
**Calvin's Mom:** Well, maybe just this once, if you do a good enough job.  
**Calvin:** _\[vacuuming\]_ That suppressed smile worries me.

Bob cons others into helping him with a tedious, thankless, or otherwise unpleasant task. Usually, Bob was meant to do the chore himself, and runs this con to drop the work onto another person's shoulders. The victim may or may not realize that he's been had.

How Bob pulls off this impressive social feat varies. Reverse Psychology is popular, as is pulling a Bavarian Fire Drill, or making a Chain of Deals (but anyone with enough guile to do this usually has many tricks up his sleeve). If the "fence" is a dangerous or potentially lethal thing to "paint," Bob might appeal to the victim's sense of honor, pride, nobility, or religion while simultaneously downplaying the risks involved. Sometime no deception is needed when this overlaps with Only One Finds It Fun, as they already genuinely enjoyed the task and often volunteered themselves for the task.

Notable Fence Painting activities include being in a Mad Scientist's experiment, any Deal with the Devil, or joining a war against a country you didn't even know existed. Or painting a fence.

Based on the famous whitewashing scene in Mark Twain's _The Adventures of Tom Sawyer_, where Tom not only tricks the local kids into doing his chore for him, he convinces most of them to pay him for the opportunity. This makes it Older Than Radio.

    Literature 

-   An incident in Mark Twain's _The Adventures of Tom Sawyer_ is the Trope Namer as well as the Trope Codifier. Punished for disobedience, Tom has to whitewash his Aunt Polly's fence. But, when another kid named Ben comes along, Tom acts like it's an enjoyable activity that his Aunt Polly is very particular about, and that he now sees it as a privilege. By making it seem like he really wanted to do it, Tom ends up getting Ben, and soon most of the kids in the neighborhood, to perform the chore for him. All the while, Tom treats painting the fence like something he'd be proud to do. In at least one adaptation, the kids eventually realize they've been had and turn on Tom. But in the original story, Tom's plan goes off without a hitch. It serves as the Establishing Character Moment for Tom as a boy who gets by on his wits.
    
    "\[Tom\] had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it — namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to obtain."
    
-   _Feet of Clay_ features Nobby's resistance to being volunteered, and he ruminates on military attempts to convince people to volunteer. Specifically, he says that if the sarge asks "Who here likes good food" the person who answers is going to end up Peeling Potatoes.
-   The main character for _The Great Brain_ books was pretty good at this. Tom is a budding con artist; while he's home from boarding school he asks his younger brother John (the narrator) if there's anything new in town, and on receiving a negative reply, bets that if John's wrong and there is something new in town, John will do all Tom's chores while Tom's home on break. John being a 1900s US young male, hadn't thought about babies being born.
-   There's a short story by Italian writer Italo Calvino that plays with the idea in a weird way, where a man continues to shout the name Teresa at a building, and when she doesn't come out, people gather around and help him of their own volition, and eventually form a cohesive group. At the end, someone finally asks, "Are you sure she's home?" The original shouter says, "Who?" "Teresa." "I don't know anyone named Teresa." And everyone wanders off.

Naturally, the Blockblister patron who wrote his book report on this, instead of on _Tom Sawyer_, ended up receiving an F.
-   In _The Big Bang Theory_ episode, "The Collaboration Contamination", Sheldon is jealous that Amy is collaborating with Howard on a project, and Bernadette uses this to get him to do chores around the house, telling him that Howard loves doing chores and Sheldon doing them for him would upset him. She even mentions the Trope Namer when she asks Sheldon if he's read _Tom Sawyer_. Played with in that Sheldon genuinely _does_ enjoy cleaning and organizing tasks that most people try to avoid (and admitted to Bernadette that he _was_ having fun) but he was still upset over the deception.
    -   In "The Meteorite Manifestation", Sheldon mistakes Howard and Bernadette complaining about spending all day at the zoning office for bragging and rubbing his nose in it, doubling as Only One Finds It Fun, because Sheldon _extremely_ eagerly volunteers to go with them to help them solve their issue. Unlike the previous example, no deception was involved, just Sheldon's weird idea of fun working to their advantage.

    **Charlie:** Has that chair been dipped in gold?
    
-   Averted in "The Garage Painters" episode of _Leave It to Beaver_, when Ward introduces Wally and Beaver to _The Adventures of Tom Sawyer_.

    Mythology 

-   This is at least Older Than Radio, if not older: It was the primary modus operandi of Anansi The Spider, the West African Trickster, for whom conning people into doing his hard work, or out of their hard work to his benefit, was practically an art form both used by him and turned against him by people wise to his game.

    Video Games 

-   _Billy vs. SNAKEMAN_ has a recurring quest in which for one of your rounds of training under MC Stripeypants, you wash his car.

Your reward is getting introduced to a cat.
-   Subverted in _The Next Big Thing_. The task to be done is, in fact, a dangerous and untested Mad Scientist's experiment, so you would think you need to scam someone into testing it... but the Mad Scientist is more responsible than most, so he doesn't want you anywhere near the thing. In fact, he's only accepting volunteers who are aware it's a terrible idea, but are suicidal enough not to care, and who meet the standards he's set for being worthless to society. The scam is you need to convince _the scientist_ that _you're_ worthless to society, so you can test his experiment and abuse it for your own ends.

-   A _Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends_ short has Mr. Herriman punish Bloo with the chore of sorting the trash. Mac comes up with the idea for Bloo to make the other imaginary friends think that the job is fun so they would wanna do it and the two of them can sneak off and play (having been inspired by the Tom Sawyer book). This actually works; however, Bloo starts to think maybe sorting the trash really _is_ fun, and forces everyone else to leave so he can have all the fun to himself. After chasing them all off, he quickly recalls that oh yeah, they were tricking everyone, and now he's stuck doing the job himself.
-   From _Futurama_, when characters enter books to hunt down a giant brain...
-   In the _Kim Possible_ episode "Car Trouble", Dr Drakken kidnaps a cybernetics expert to help build an army of robots.

-   In _The Simpsons_ parody of Tom Sawyer, Bart (as Tom) tries this but Milhouse doesn't fall for it. So Nelson (as Huck) threatens him with physical violence, which works much better.
-   _South Park_: Cartman manages to make a dying amusement park thrive by creating ads telling people they aren't allowed in. This false scarcity creates booming interest in the park. However, this was completely unintentional on Cartman's part; he really _didn't_ want to let anyone in and wanted to keep the park all to himself, only creating the ads to troll people. But then, one of the rides breaks, so Cartman is forced to let in two customers per day so he could afford to hire a repairman to fix it. Then, he has to let in two more customers per day so he could hire a security guard to stop people from sneaking in. Then he has to let in more, and so on and so on, until the park was totally packed all day every day. Cartman was making tons of money from the now-thriving park, but he didn't even care, because all he wanted was his own private amusement park where he didn't have to wait in line for rides.
-   The _Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?_ episode "Chapter and Verse" has Zack and Ivy crash-land in Hannibal, Missouri, breaking a picket fence.

He even manages to trade his brush for a skateboard and some fishing wire.

    Real Life 

-   One of the most effective ways to get people to join a group is to gather together a large number of people mildly interested in joining said group, then telling them that space is limited and only a few people will make the cut. Mass job interviews, Greek Week, and volunteer rallies all depend on participants seeing how many people want to join, being told there's only a few spots available, and watching people fight for the spots.
-   Lobster was actually considered a poor person's meal until a few fishermen got the bright idea to send small amounts of them to the inner United States where rich people wouldn't know the stigma against eating it. It also helped that lobster ended up being scarcer than people thought after all, helping its popularity among the wealthy even further. It helped, too, that the railroads were looking for a new entree they could serve right about the same time, and also new techniques in storage and preparation for lobster were being discovered that dramatically improved the flavor and shelf-life. All of this ended up turning lobster from a ocean pest into a rare delicacy.
-   Mark Twain himself points to his inspiration being in England, where wealthy gentlemen would pay coach-drivers for the privilege of taking over the reins.
