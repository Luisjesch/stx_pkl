_"When you haven't been getting any, other people notice that. Other people pick up on that. You yourself don't know that you haven't been getting any; you just think, 'oh, another week has gone by'... But on the other hand, when I haven't been getting any **and then I get some,** overnight I become a different person. Next day you wake up, you're Mahatma Gandhi. You're full of love. You're a visionary. You care about world peace. I have a smile for everyone. 'Why yes, I'd love a Street Sheet! In fact I'll take all that you have! Keep the spare change! Why yes, I am getting some!'"_

— **Marga Gomez**

This is when a character not known for their active sexual life acts differently enough (usually more cheerful or mellow) for other characters to notice and question it. They (and sometimes the audience) find out that it is because said character somehow got laid.

(Alternatively, they'll go through the Did You Get a New Haircut? routine.)

Normally used on characters that are a bit grumpy or disillusioned, proving that all they needed was to get laid. It's almost Always Male in this case, as the female equivalent is more subdued.

Compare to Virgin Vision, where another person can tell a character has had sex without any clues being given off, and Virginity Flag, where there is a blatantly obvious sign of the loss of virginity. See also Sex Dressed and Sexy Shirt Switch.

Not to be confused with Did They or Didn't They?.

    Anime & Manga 

-   _Bakemonogatari_: Araragi is seen in what one might call an exuberant and joyful mood. It's difficult to confirm that anything really did happen the previous night, but he does seem awfully happy.
-   During the first flashback arc in _Cavalier of the Abyss_, Jae Hyuk is seen passionately kissing Serin on top of a bed.

-   Implied in _Ergo Proxy_. After a certain point in the plot Vincent and Re-l start acting a lot nicer to each other. This is never explained.
-   _Gravitation_: Played with/inverted. The night after Shuichi first has sex with Yuki, he walks around with glowing eyes and an enormous smile, asks his best friend to ask him what happened last night, and then won't specify.
-   _Haruhi Suzumiya_: In the tenth novel, when Kyon is acting more cheerful and upbeat than usual, Taniguchi mutters "What's with you? Don't tell me you and Suzumiya finally... no, never mind." Considering that he makes no secret of the fact that he assumes the two are dating, it's pretty clear he thought they had their first time when he wasn't paying attention. They didn't.
-   In _Junjou Romantica_, Miyagi teases his collegue Hiroki about this a few times, once just to watch him squirm.
-   _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War_:
    -   In Chapter 155, Iino notices that Ishigami smells more like Tsubame than he did before she went to sleep. Due to the fact that they were alone for a few hours and that it's Christmas, she counts one and one together and concludes that Ishigami slept with Tsubame, congratulating him. However, Ishigami refused to sleep with Tsubame because she didn't want a Long-Distance Relationship with him (later revealed to just be a cover for her Commitment Issues), and Ishigami didn't want a one-night stand.
    -   In Chapter 39 of _We Want to Talk About Kaguya_, Karen comes to the conclusion that Kashiwagi and Tsubasa has Their First Time over summer break after noticing that Kashiwagi seems to be positively glowing with sex appeal. She's absolutely right to think that.

-   _Maison Ikkoku_: After one-hundred-forty-nine chapters — containing dozens of fights and annoying misunderstandings — Yusaku and Kyoko make love for first time.

-   In _Ouran Highschool Host Club_, the hosts walk in on Tamaki and Haruhi while Tamaki is helping her with her fear of thunderstorms. At the moment, he's putting a blindfold and headphones on her to assure that she won't hear or see anything. Needless to say, they assume that it's something else.
-   _Rebuild World_: When the protagonist's Squad of Private Military Contractors (known as "Hunters") take an hour of R&R from their medevac operation, the Old Soldier Shirakabe gets shoved into the back of his APC by the Heroic Seductress Carol, so she can sleep with him for information after he repairs and restocks the vehicle. Since Shirakabe is known for being early, him meeting the rest of the squad exactly on time afterwards alongside Carol, leads to an awkward exchange with everyone else staring at him because they could figure out what happened.

-   _School Days_: While never asked, Taisuke has this expression in a certain episode. This being School Days, that's because the night before, he indeed had sex, or rather, forced himself on Kotonoha while she was shocked at knowing that Makoto chose Sekai for his Folk Dance partner. She coldly dismissed him the day after and Taisuke is none the wiser that what he had done is basically rape. Did we mention this anime is a Dysfunction Junction?
-   _Shimoneta_: Zigzagged in chapter 10, when Ayame walks in on Tanukichi and Oboro in the girls' locker-room and sees Tanukichi has pinned Oboro on the floor. Then sees Oboro is breathing heavy and smiling with a faint blush from just having his first orgasm.

Occasionally, beef bourguignon will also appear as a Mythology Gag.

-   In chapter 8 of _Advice and Trust_ Rei manages to piece together that Shinji and Asuka were just having sex in a supply closet based on how they smelled, their lack of tension, and the fact that they arrived back at the classroom at the same time even though they left separately.

-   Victoria, in the _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ fanfic _All This Sh\*t is Twice as Weird_, knows that Mahanon is setting up his Grand Romantic Gesture for Cassandra.

-   Alluded to in _The Apprentice, the Student, and the Charlatan_. Trixie's first appearance sees her teasing Twilight over apparently getting laid with Nova, due to the fact that she seems like she's in a lot better mood than usual that particular morning, not to mention the way she was looking at him, though it turns out it's just because it's the first proper night of sleep she's had in months.
-   In Chapter 14 of _As Fate Would Have It_, Rosa meets up with her two friends Nate and Yancy the morning after the two have had Their First Time.

Eventually, they come clean and admit it to her.

-   _A Crown of Stars_: In chapter 44, when Daniel greets Shinji and Asuka he notes that they seem very pleased and asks if they got any sleep the last night.

-   _Doing It Right This Time_: In Chapter 3, Ritsuko is looking ridiculously cheerful and sporting a huge hickey. Misato tries to work up the nerve to ask the obvious question... And then Maya walks into the room sporting a _collar_, which answers questions Misato didn't want to ask.

Do you require some post-coital refreshment?_
    
-   In the _Homestuck_ fanfic _Like Lovers Do_ Aradia manages to not only tell that Eridan and Feferi have pailed, but also to convey her smugness about it without saying anything in particular.
    
    _\[at breakfast the morning after\]_  
    **Aradia:** In a good mood, aren't we. Slept well?  
    **Eridan:** It's just this cream. It's really good.  
    **Aradia:** That it is.  
    **Narration:** In the meanwhile, Aradia just finishes washing her cup and goes upstairs without any other comment. And that's pretty much it. You're sure she knows, she just doesn't give a damn about it.

-   The _Star Wars Rebels_ fanfic _Rain/Fall_: The morning after Hera and Kanan are busy having a "meeting" alone on the ship, everyone is very annoyed about how chipper the pair are.

-   _Tales of the Otherverse_: At the end of the fifth chapter, Jennifer Walters runs into Rogue singing and fixing breakfast while Kara is acting unusually perky. Jennifer easily puts two and two together and gives congratulations to both women.
    
    She spun to see an equally cheery Kara bearing down on her, her arms full of printouts. Like Rogue, she was still dressed in her nightclothes. She stepped aside and watched as Kara zipped by to plop her burden on the table. Then she saw the unexpected. Kara had gone straight to the coffee pot, and stopped long enough to quickly kiss Rogue. And, despite its quickness, there was nothing chaste about the kiss. Jenny had no doubt she had just witnessed a kiss between lovers.  
    "Well, I'm glad someone got laid last night!" She drawled, leaning in the doorway.
    
-   Luna immediately figures this out, by picking up on Celestia's good mood and the spring in her step in _TD the Alicorn Princess_.
-   _White Sheep (RWBY)_: Right before the final battle, Ruby is annoyed that she can tell that her sister Yang had sex. She already _knew_ Yang had sex, as she wasn't exactly subtle during the act, but she's annoyingly cheerful and clearly much less stressed than she should be considering the situation.

    **Friday:** Not that it's any of your business, Mr. National Enquirer, but I had the pleasure of spending a quiet evening in the company of Connie Swail.  
    **Streebeck:** Wait a minute. "Connie Swail?" Don't you mean "_the virgin_ Connie Swail"?

    Literature 

-   In one of the _Alien Nation_ books, Sykes _tries_ to have sex with an alien, leaving him with bruises on his neck from her legs; the aliens become very "uninhibited". While humans generally don't know enough about Tenctonese physiology to figure out what happened to him, his coworker is an alien too. He rehearses lying to cover it up. The _moment_ he enters the workplace, another alien says "did you copulate with a Tenctonese last night?" Sputtering, he tries to run off, with the alien shouting behind him "sexual ignorance is dangerous!" Meeting his coworker only leads to more awkwardness (as his coworker knows his alien girlfriend). An almost identical scene, following almost identical events the night before, occurs in the TV series.

-   In _Ciaphas Cain: Choose Your Enemies_, Cain sees both Colonel Kasteen and Major Broklaw entertaining the attentions of local nobles at a banquet in the 597th's honor, and wryly thinks to himself that neither the CO nor XO are likely to spend the night in their own quarters.

-   Paul Robinson's _Instrument of God_: Supervisor 246 recounts his first time with a woman as another teenager shows up. "‘Look, I'd better go,' I said, and I tried to walk past him. Well, I guess her boyfriend could smell it on me, because he said, ‘Did you just fuck her?' I probably should have just lied, and said ‘no,' then left. ‘Yeah,' I said."
-   A more subtle example in _The Lost Fleet_. After the first time Victoria Rione seduces John Geary, both of them come to the _Dauntless_'s bridge, where Captain Tanya Desjani takes one look at them and instantly figures it out, despite Geary trying to act normal, and Rione being a politician (i.e. can easily fake any expression). Desjani makes a suggestive comment and leaves the bridge. Dumbstruck, Geary mouths "How?" to Rione resulting in a "need to know" speech, which Geary interprets as Women's Mysteries.
    -   This scene becomes Hilarious in Hindsight a few books later when Desjani develops feelings for Geary herself.

-   In _Starfighters of Adumar_ from the _X-Wing Series_, Wedge, the leader and responsible type of Red Flight, reconciles with his old love interest Iella Wesseri. The next morning he is exuberant, a little flighty, and joking readily, while his Wing Man, who normally is the one with all those traits but spent the night on the balcony watching for attackers, is grumpy. It's never _said_ outright, but the scenes do imply that Wedge and Iella had sex, and Wes almost-but-doesn't-quite ask him.

-   _Empty Nest_. Barbara takes one look at the post-coital Carol and is able to deduce that she just had sex. Charlie tops this by figuring out every single significant characteristic about him—"you're still flushed, so he must be pretty young", "it's the middle of the day, so he probably doesn't have a job", "judging from your posture, he's about this tall" (gestures with his hand just as the man in question walks in).

    -   In "The One After Ross Says Rachel" when Phoebe sees Chandler and Monica for the first time since their trip to London, where the two hooked up, she immediately yells out "You had sex!" to which the two start sputtering and trying to deny it. Phoebe says to Chandler, "Well, obviously not YOU. I meant Monica." Monica then denies it as well. In a rare subversion, Phoebe accepts this, saying "Man, this pregnancy's throwing me all off."
-   Rather a sad example in _Gilmore Girls_. Lorelai comes home and sees Rory and the very married Dean stumble out of Rory's bedroom looking dishevelled and a little too happy. The anger and disppointment on Lorelai's face is heartbreaking.
-   _Gen V_: In "Jumanji" Jordan immediately comments on Emma's "sex hair" when she returns to the frat house with Sam in tow. Emma lies and claims she didn't.
-   In season three of _Glee_ after Will Schuester and Emma Pillsbury finally have sex (after the New Directions finally win at Nationals) Sue sees her the next day and quips "Why do you look different?"
-   _The Golden Girls_:
    -   Blanche likes to invoke this trope whenever she has a particularly exciting experience with a gentleman caller, often deliberately acting out of breath or sighing heavily when she comes into the room. It often leaves her open to quips from Dorothy: "Why do I suddenly feel the need to bathe?"
    -   Parodied in another episode when Sophia takes offense to being compared to a pet; right afterward, she _sniffs_ Blanche and says "You've been with a man, haven't you?"
    -   A variation occurs in "Mary Has a Little Lamb," when the girls' teenage next-door neighbor Mary comes over for a visit. After Dorothy, Rose, and Blanche greet her, Sophia enters, says hello, and immediately asks "When's the baby due?" Mary confirms that her boyfriend has gotten her pregnant, and Sophia explains that she recognized the similarities to Dorothy when _she_ came home "in trouble" as a teen.
-   In season two of _House_ the team has gathered in the middle of the night and wonder what is taking House so long. They know he left with Stacey, but Cameron is sure that they didn't have sex (while Foreman hopes they did, since it might put House in a better mood). Enter House, singing and smiling. Played with, as House was not happy about the sex itself (he hires prostitutes from time to time, so...), but because he still had feelings for Stacy.
-   Barney does this in _How I Met Your Mother_. "Aww, man, you guys did it, didn't you?"
-   _Just Shoot Me!_:
    -   Finch comes into work after sleeping with his supermodel girlfriend and somebody comments, "Wow, the only time I've seen you this happy is two years ago whe—_you had sex, didn't you?_"
    -   In another episode, Nina claims that Maya has sex every twelve months, which is how she knows to set the clocks back for Daylight Savings Time.
-   In French series _Lazy Company_, Louise can tell almost instantly that formerly shy virgin Private Henry is not a virgin any more, because he is "a little taller, a little less honest".
-   _Life_:
    -   Crews got the picture when he and Reese are on their way to the desert, and a song's playing on the radio, and Reese is humming along without realizing. Crews quips, "You were humming," Reese goes, "What? No I wasn't," and Crews goes, "When people hum without realizing, it usually means they're... happy." To which Reese replies, "I wasn't humming, and I'm not happy!"
    -   What really blows her cover is when their boss calls the hotel room the two are staying in, and immediately starts talking dirty over the phone having assumed they had separate rooms and that Reese would answer.
-   _The Nanny_:
    -   Happens to Niles and C.C. in "Yetta's Lettas", Niles enters singing and C.C., normally an Enemy to All Living Things, gets a scene where she sings and attracts a dove to her hand like a Disney princess.
    -   In "Strange Bedfellows", Fran drunkenly stumbles into Max's room and ends up sleeping in his bed (Maxwell was sound asleep due to taking sleeping aids). The next morning, they panic and wonder if they had sex, but ultimately decide it didn't happen, as they each have a particular "tell." But then, just as the episode ends, they begin doing those very things.
-   _NCIS_
    -   "Endgame" has Tony doing this when McGee walks into the office extremely happy. Tony refers to it as "Pulling a Heston" in a reference to _Planet of the Apes._
    -   Ziva does it to Tony once as well — _gleefully_. "It's okay to admit it, we're all adults here!" Of course, Fornell is behind her: "That's a subject I'd be willing to debate, Officer David."
-   _New Tricks_: The boys have this reaction when Sasha enters the office with a spring in her step in "The Lottery Curse". Leads to a Side Bet about whether she had or not.
-   In _Night Court_, the day after Christine gets charmed by a young artist she successfully defended, she shows up smiling as usual. Resident lecher Dan takes one look at her and declares "You bopped the kid!".
-   Ron Swanson from _Parks and Recreation_ always dresses like Tiger Woods after a night of sexytimes.
-   Happens offscreen on _Party of Five_. Nina was immediately able to tell that Julia was no longer a virgin.
-   _Scrubs_
    
    -   There's only one day of the year when Dr. Bob Kelso's in a good mood (the day after his wedding anniversary) so people only ask him for anything once a year. This actually turns out to be a subversion: his wife always spends the anniversary at "fat camp". Kelso, however, allows the myth to continue so people only ask him for things once a year.
    -   Another subversion where JD has trouble getting it up and walks into work thinking everyone is doing this when they're not:
    
    **Dr. Cox**: Hey, Newbie, what's up?
    
    **J.D.**: Everything! Everything's up!
    
    **Dr. Kelso**: Rise and shine, sport!
    
    **J.D.'s narration**: What, did someone send out a flier?!
    
    **Todd**: Hey, J.D.! How's your penis?
    
    **J.D.'s narration**: All right, calm down, he says that to everyone.
    
    -   Another example is Turk, who demonstrates an uncanny ability to always know when two people have had sex. He deduces J.D. and Elliot's hook-up solely on how they exchanged nods at work. He then points out two male orderlies who he claims have started dating, and he's quickly proven right. In J.D.'s case, explained by the sex gongs they bought each other. Except, of course, when JD moves out and Turk still hears it...
        
        **Turk**: "Yeah, buddy!"
        
    -   A great example is when Dr Cox starts dating pharmaceutical rep Julie (played by Heather Locklear) in season two. He goes from surly Cox to carrying Julie piggyback singing "Perry's gonna get some loving!" while she smacks his ass. He even winks at J.D.
    -   Turk learns about Denise's and Drew's relationship from Todd, who's apparent super-pervert skills allow him to detect any sex in the hospital, their position, and what clothes they are/aren't wearing.
        -   "Why won't you let him take off his pants?"
-   Subverted in _Sliders_ where it is actually Wade's disheveled and decidedly un-chipper appearance and demeanor that cause Quinn to say "Did you get lucky or run over?" Neither; she'd been partying with vampires who were trying to change her.
-   _Spin City_
    -   Loser Paul walks into work singing and skipping after having sex. He struts down the hall to the Bee Gees' "Stayin' Alive" ala _Saturday Night Fever_.
    -   James comes in one day with a subdued smile on his face, which piques Nikki's interest.
        
        **Nikki:** That look... I know that look. You had sex last night.
        
-   One episode of _Stargate SG-1_ features Carter and O'Neil riding an elevator with Carter humming the whole way, prompting an amusing exchange.
    -   It gets better: Word Of God says she was supposed to hum the _MacGyver_ theme tune to surprise Richard Dean Anderson, but no one could remember it, and asking him would've spoiled the surprise.
    -   Then there's a scene in the episode "Crossroads" involving Teal'c, of all people. An old flame has come to the SGC to get help. They are shown kissing in her room. Cut to Teal'c leaving the room grinning from ear to ear as Daniel walks up.
-   _Star Trek: Voyager_: In "Darkling", Kes is shown kissing a local alien, then later beams up to Voyager at three in the morning with her hair tousled and a sore back, grinning like she just got laid. The female transporter operator gives her a knowing smile.
-   In _Taxi_, after Latka got married to Simka, he ended up stranded in a broken down cab with a female cabbie in the freezing cold. She told him the only option was for them to have sex or freeze to death. After the ordeal, Latka went home hoping Simka wouldn't find out, but as soon as they hugged, Simka screamed, "YOU DID IT WITH ANOTHER WOMAN!"
-   In _That '70s Show_, the day after Eric and Donna have first made love, a weirded-out Donna appears from Jackie's point of view to have the words "I had sex" on her forehead. Eric, on the other hand, had the words "Guilty" written on his forehead when talking to Donna's father.
-   In season two of _Veronica Mars_, immediately after Veronica sleeps with Duncan she bumps into Logan who says she looks different and asks if she's changed her hair. At home her father makes a similar comment and she wonders whether he's really such a good detective that he can tell she's had sex.
-   In _Who's the Boss?_, Tony runs into Mona after he's had a "successful" date. Mona nonchalantly busts him.
    
    **Tony**: \[stunned\] How could you tell?
    
    She also knows he didn't sleep with Angela, because she wasn't singing "Climb Every Mountain".
    
-   _Will & Grace_:
    -   An episode had two characters do this to Grace, with one actually able to identify the other man with this too. Both cases are a simple "You had sex!"
    -   Karen is able to tell _exactly_ what Grace has done with a man in a matter of seconds. Grace is understandably terrified of this power.

    Music 

-   The Lonely Island just had sex, and the video is made of this trope. With TV broadcast and fireworks. Seriously, look at Akon's face whenever he's on-camera.
-   Madonna's "Did You Do It?" from _Erotica_ is about this.

    Video Games 

-   _Divinity: Original Sin II_: Malady might be on the verge of a Heroic RRoD from Thinking Up Portals, but can still spot the afterglow from a player character's Optional Sexual Encounter:
    
    _"What's wrong with you. You seem..._ happy_."_
    
-   _Dragon Age II_: All of the post romance banters but this one is particularly good.
    
    **Merrill:** Are you happy?  
    **Anders:** Beg your pardon?  
    **Merrill:** S/he seems happy. Hawke, I mean. Are you?  
    **Anders:** Yes. I suppose I am.  
    **Merrill:** Good. You've spent much too much time being grumpy. It's a nice change.
    
-   Hinted in _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ by a pair of Orlesian courtiers hanging around in the main hall at Skyhold. After the Inquisitor and their romance partner of choice have cemented the pairing, these two can be overheard gossiping about things. Their exact commentary depends on who the Love Interest is. Outright stated if a male Inquisitor romances Dorian and has him and Cole in the party later. Cole remarks on how good it is to see Dorian smiling because of the Inquisitor.
-   _Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords_: Given that the result of getting enough light side points is a sort of healthy glow, Mira invokes this by commenting that she thought the player and whichever potential love interest he/she has a higher Influence with "hooked up a power coupling".
-   _The Legend of Heroes: Trails from Zero and Trails to Azure_: Lloyd having an intimate but platonic evening with Elie causes the rest of the Special Support Section to assume they did the deed after seeing how close they are and mock them. This continues as a Sustained Misunderstanding, with Lloyd's aunty reacting to his changed demeanor by telling him that he's finally "become a man" like his older brother.

-   Several times in _Dominic Deegan_. Most notably, when Greg and Pam do it for the first time, Dominic figures it out because, as he points out, some people have a "glow" about them after their first time, but because Greg is a powerful White Mage, in his case, it's a little more literal.

-   Makes an appearance in this _Least I Could Do_ strip.

    -   When Mell explains to Artie: "I mean, check him out, he's wearing the red shirt ... ." "The shirt is significant" "It's his best shirt, and it's always Thursday in the rotation. He moved it up to Monday. Plus he cleaned his glasses." "From this you deduced he's had sex?" "No, I knew he had sex 'cause he's smiling. I'm just trying to educate you"
-   _Out There_: The insightful Miriam concludes that Sherry has broken her long dry spell upon observing the latter's visible discomfort with discussing the topic \[1\]; James makes a lucky guess based on a similar observation \[2\], and Clayton explains the most compelling reason she's unable to conceal what everybody else can see \[3\].
-   _Questionable Content_:
-   In _Rhapsodies_ Kate's employees have noticed this... frequently... and it's getting on their nerves.

    Web Videos 

-   In _Let's Drown Out WWF No Mercy_, Gabriel Mortom has created a wrestler to imitate his friend and commentary partner, Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw, and have stated that everything about Wrestler!Yahtzee, sans the face, is accurate to the real one including a rather pompous entrance dance. According to him, Yahtzee does the exact same dance after he got laid.

-   _Time Squad_: In "Ex Marks the Spot," Larry suddenly acts cheerful and more accommodating around Tuddrussel. Otto even questions why Larry is so cheerful. The sudden change in mood was handwaved as Larry finally giving up being snarky and being nicer, but given the suggestive imagery in Larry preparing Tuddrussell's meal (i.e., the gravy being pumped inside a turkey to the point of near bursting and a lone cherry sinking into the turkey), it had to be something more.
