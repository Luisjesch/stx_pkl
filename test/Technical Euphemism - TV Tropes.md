**Guinan:** What are you going to do? Go back to your room and pout?  
**Ro Laren:** I am _not_ twelve years old! If I want to go to my quarters and contemplate my situation, that does not mean that I am... pouting!

Most euphemisms sound less accurate than the thing they're a euphemism for (for example "buying the farm" for death). _These_ euphemisms, however, are _overly_ accurate, to the point that the speaker sounds like a walking encyclopaedia.

Uses of Sesquipedalian Loquaciousness, Spock Speak, or Gratuitous Latin (or dog Latin) to cover up a disturbing, embarrassing, or gross term (like saying, "emesis" instead of "throwing up") is what a Technical Euphemism is.

People may use them because technical words sound clinical and thus are less likely to come off as uncivilised or disturbing. They may also be used as a Less Embarrassing Term for something the speaker finds childish (e.g. "It's not tears, it's lacrimal fluid!") because a person is less likely to be thought of as childish if they're using "grown-up" words. Sometimes, such as in cases of Friendship Denial, it might also be an attempt to avoid sounding emotionally-charged. If someone repeats what the speaker said in Layman's Terms, that's a Euphemism Buster.

    Real Life 

-   Aerospace engineers like to call a test plane or rocket blowing up in mid-flight "rapid unplanned disassembly" or "rapid unscheduled disassembly", sometimes abbreviated RUD. This led to some confusion when in 2023 the first orbital test flight of the SpaceX Starship exploded 4 minutes after launch and the official SpaceX Twitter account reported that the spacecraft had undergone an RUD. Observers unfamiliar with the aerospace-engineering in-joke thought the company was trying to put a positive spin on a disaster, when in fact the engineers had expected the rocket to explode _sooner_ than it did and were ecstatic it lasted a whole four minutes before blowing up.
-   In the last days of World War II, Hirohito's pre-recorded speech to announce Japan's surrender on 1945 never used words such as "defeat" but rather "the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage" and "our empire accepts the provisions of their joint declaration." Combined with the poor sound quality of the speech (which was played on a 78 rpm phonograph over fuzzy radio waves) and Hirohito's use of impenetrably antiquated Japanese, this resulted in an announcer having to follow up the speech by stating in plain terms that Japan was surrendering to the Allies.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   "Vertically challenged" is sometimes used as a (usually tongue-in-cheek) euphemism for "short".
    -   In the same vein, "follically challenged" can be used for "bald".
-   The euphemism treadmill surrounding the words "idiot," "imbecile," and "moron" became increasingly reliant on this with each iteration. Originally, all three terms referred to different classes of intellectual disability, but when they became generic insults of intelligence, they were replaced with "mentally retarded," the idea being that "retard" was too technical-sounding (coming from the Latin word for slowness) to enter the popular vernacular. Not only did it do exactly that, but by the late 2000s it was considered an outright slur, leading it to be deprecated in formal usage in favor of "mental impairment," then "intellectual disability."
-   The aviation safety term "controlled flight into terrain" (CFIT) is sometimes misunderstood as a Technical Euphemism for "plane crash." In fact, it's a completely transparent term for a _specific kind_ of plane crash: one in which the pilots, while retaining control of a plane in full working order, crash it either because of not knowing where the ground is (e.g. flying it into a mountain), or on purpose.
