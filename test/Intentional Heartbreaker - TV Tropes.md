_"My plan is to make Fanny Price in love with me. I cannot be satisfied without Fanny Price, without making a small hole in Fanny Price's heart. (...) I will not do her any harm, dear little soul! only want her to look kindly on me, to give me smiles as well as blushes, to keep a chair for me by herself wherever we are, and be all animation when I take it and talk to her; to think as I think, be interested in all my possessions and pleasures, try to keep me longer at Mansfield, and feel when I go away that she shall be never happy again. I want nothing more."_

Love is a beautiful thing, but there are a lot of stumbling blocks that can get in the way of someone experiencing it. Unfortunately, the possibility of winding up with a broken heart is all too real, and for those who have had their hearts broken, the pain can be extreme. In fact, the emotional hurt that comes from being dumped can be _literally_ painful, and even traumatic. So, it stands to reason that any compassionate person would take steps to ensure that, even if they have to break up with someone, they do it gently and respectfully, minimizing the pain.

And then there's _this_ person. Rather than break hearts through ignorance, circumstance, or even by mistake, these characters do it willfully and deliberately, leading their victims along and allowing them to get attached, before shattering their heart with little to no remorse.

They may be the Alpha Bitch, stringing unlucky nerds along for her own cruel amusement and taking advantage of their crushes on her. They may be a serial womanizer, looking for sex, and attracting so many partners they couldn't care less about the ones who've developed feelings for them. They may be a typical Jerkass with a Lack of Empathy, someone who cares only about themselves, or even a Narcissist or Sociopath, up to being a Sadist, in the most extreme cases. In many cases, they're manipulative enough to be a Manipulative Bastard, intentionally fooling their victim. Regardless of who they are, though, they have one thing in common: they find a romantic partner, trick them into thinking the romance is real or allowing them to think it is, and then carelessly toss them aside, intentionally or willingly hurting them in the process. Characters who do this are also more likely to pull other cruel tricks on their "lover", such as breaking up with them over email, cheating casually and often, or even committing acts of Domestic Abuse.

As such, it's no surprise the character who does this is usually the bad guy. Even if their victim is being targeted out of revenge, often for having broken _another person's_ heart or because the heartbreaker themselves has had their heart broken in the past, this will be portrayed as a morally ambiguous act at best, something too cruel for even the resident asshole to deserve. Even if the person has a conscience and feels guilty over it, they'll still go through with it, despite knowing it's wrong. Of course, if the entire relationship is done for the purpose of breaking someone's heart, there's a high chance of the manipulator Becoming the Mask; in those cases, dual-heartbreak is on the horizon.

A similar trope is Relationship Sabotage; where both tropes can result in someone having a broken heart, Relationship Sabotage involves an outsider messing with the relationship, which could result in _both_ partners getting hurt. Also compare this to Commitment Issues, where someone may go into a relationship with no intention to stay in it but aren't doing it maliciously. Other tropes to compare are Operation: Jealousy, Shock Value Relationship, Fake Relationship, I Was Only Pretending To Like You, and Hope Crusher. This may result in It Meant Something to Me, Ladykiller in Love or Did You Actually Believe...?, and is often committed by a Handsome Lech, The Casanova, The Vamp, or the Troll. This is often a Kick the Dog moment, or if done particularly cruelly, an out-and-out crossing of the Moral Event Horizon. See also The Schlub Pub Seduction Deduction, when a man probably should have suspected the hot woman had ulterior motives. Not to be confused with Break His Heart to Save Him, which is where a character only cruelly dumps someone out of desire to protect them.
