People getting covered in gunge (also known as slime). A variant involves a large cake and comedies: it is inevitable in such shows that someone will end up with their face in the cake. If the cake is big enough (as many wedding cakes are), they'll do a full-body dive into it.

Often a result of a Food Fight, Powder Gag, or Bucket Booby-Trap. Edible gunge can lead to I Taste Delicious if the person covered in gunge tries to eat his way out.

A trope of the Saturday Morning Kids’ Show genre or anything else aimed at kids. This trope is also popular in a number of programs aimed at adults. The game show use of gunge was particularly ubiquitous during the late 80s and early 90s, but it seems to have died down now as health and safety and general dignity take increasing hold.

Britain started all this in the 1960s with _Not Only… But Also_ and the festival of anarchy that was _Tiswas_. Slightly later on, America got into it as well thanks to the Canadians with the sketch show _You Can't Do That on Television_, and it became a hallmark of the network Nickelodeon. In general, American game shows tended to use slime as an obstacle or even reward, while the British, with their typical mastery of villainy, treated it more as a sort of ritual punishment with various elaborate and spectacular gungings being dealt out to celebrities or the general public courtesy of The BBC.

A character partial to Filthy Fun is likely to end up like this, with The Pig-Pen being someone seen covered in gunge _far_ more often than not. May result from Slipping into Stink or a Garbage Hideout. When it's blood that somebody is covered with, it's Blood-Splattered Innocents; if they did it intentionally and like it, it's Blood Is the New Black. If it's mud they're covered in, it's... well... Covered in Mud. An Older Than Television version is Pie in the Face. If a character is covered from head-to-toe in _projectiles_ rather than filth, they're a Human Pincushion.

Often an essential ingredient in a good Humiliation Conga.

Not to be confused with something being Covered in Grunge.

    Game Shows 

-   The earliest use of gunge on an American game show was likely _The Cheap Show_, where a contestant's husband would be on the receiving end of a bucket of slime or a Pie in the Face if she got the question wrong, or if her opponent got it right.
-   Nickelodeon's _Double Dare_ was the Trope Codifier for gungy game shows in the US with their branded green slime "Gak." Then it became _Super Sloppy Double Dare_ and the show never looked back. _Double Dare 2000_ introduced "Goooze".
-   Other Nickelodeon game shows from the same era that followed suit:
    -   _Finders Keepers_, to an extent - mainly if the Pastry Shop was one of the rooms in the house, or if they hid the clue or object in a bucket of slime; otherwise contestants merely got sprayed with or fell into water at most.
    -   _Think Fast_.
    -   _What Would You Do?_ - Various challenges given to studio audience members, usually involving giant pies. Also hosted by Marc "OCD" Summers.
    -   _Wild and Crazy Kids_ - featured random teams of kids competing in various games, many of which involved gunge of some sort, especially toward the end of the series.
-   Non-Nick shows from the same time period:
    -   _Fun House (1988)_, arguably the most successful, both in the US and the UK. Whole lot of fun, Prizes to be won. While gunge is chucked about liberally.
    -   The most blatant _Double Dare_ ripoff, _Slime Time_, and its sister show _Treasure Mall_.
    -   The first version of _Pictionary_. The Bonus Round that made it to air involved kids simply getting wet in the "Water Works", although clips of the pilot shown on the commercials showed them playing a game with pies.
    -   Hanna-Barbera produced one called _Skedaddle_, basically a "hot potato"-style game played in an Absurdly-Spacious Sewer. This was the standard penalty for wrong answers, throwing the object out of bounds, running out of time, etc.
-   Current Nickelodeon game shows that continue the tradition:
    -   _Figure It Out_: Any panelist who triggered the "Secret Slime Action" got to see why that weird pipe was hanging ominously over his or her head. In the current revival, the slime from the Secret Slime Action can come from _anywhere_, and clues are often delivered by spraying massive amounts of some kind of related liquid into the panelists' faces. The _contestant_ can get slimed as well if a panelist guesses the "Word of Honor", the word in the puzzle most critical to guessing the player's secret.
    -   _BrainSurge_: Either lose at any point and get sent down the "Brain Drain", a slide filled with "earwax" foam, or win the game and the Bonus Round and be subjected to the standard Nick green slime treatment.
    -   _Web Heads_: At the end of the show, the winning contestant is sprayed with slime while riding a mechanical surfboard.
-   _Crackerjack!_. In the later era, hosted by Stu Francis, the original finale game of "Double or Drop" was dropped in favour of a new game called "Take A Chance". Here the two celebrities would compete against Stu for extra points for the child contestant by picking a "Joker" colour. Two slats above two booths would appear stating the points available and what the tank above them contained, "The Points to be won, or the penalties to pay". The celeb would sit in one and Stu in the other. One of the assistants would ask a question and the winner received the points for their child contestant. The loser received the contents of the tank above. The ladies (not always) usually got away with it but the male celebrities were always gunged along with Francis, who copped it every week.
-   _Noel's House Party_, a UK Saturday evening entertainment show from the 90s, is probably the biggest example of this for shows aimed at adults (as much as you could describe it as 'grown-up' at all). Gunge was a staple of the programme, and it featured throughout its lifetime:
    -   _Gunge Tank_: Simply, a clear booth with a seat and a reservoir of gunge on the top. In its first form, on a precursor to _House Party_ called _Noel Edmonds' Saturday Roadshow_, a member of the audience would play a word game, with Noel and the celebrity of the week assisting them. The answers to separate clues would combine loosely to form a larger phrase, and the contestant would have to bet on how many of these phrases they could get in 90 seconds - if they failed to reach their number, the gunge was released.
        -   The gunge tank was carried over into _Noel's House Party_, where it would be used to deal justice to a member of the public who had been nominated by their friends for some grudge between them. Later on in the show's life, its use changed to gunging celebrities, who would be put against each other in a phone vote each week to decide who had to go inside. Two foam pumps were also added at the bottom of the tank, which would fill the booth with colored foam around the victim while they were gunged from above.
        -   The third style of tank was more conveyor-like, with the victim being carried on a chair through a set of carwash-style brushes to the center before they were covered by the main tank.
        -   Finally, the tank was replaced by the Trip Around the Great House, a ghost-train-like ride around the manor-themed studio. The riders (usually a celebrity and an unfortunate audience member) were covered in foam and various other mess at every turn before finally ending up behind the large fireplace, where the main flood of gunge would be spewed from the ceiling.
    -   _Number Cruncher_: This was another gunge booth, disguised as a phone box, that would be left on a random street corner each week. Watchers would be shown a picture of where the box was located and then, if they recognized its location, race the country to be the first one inside. Once they had got in, unknown at first to them (although everyone must have realized after the first couple of weeks) the tank would then lock them inside and the only way to escape was to play the game. Four numbers would be shown to the contestant via an LCD screen on the tank's phone, after which they had 45 seconds to put them in order by process of trial and error to find the combination to unlock the door and get out before the gunge tank started up. Each button press on the phone would add to the prize money, leading some people to frantically dial in 9s for as long as they dared before attempting to then escape.
        -   Later shows turned this into a versus game, with twin booths and two contenders trying to find the combination and gunge the other first.
    -   _Panel Beaters_: As if the final iteration of the gunge tank just wasn't severe enough, this game put a team of three celebrities against a panel of three people with unusual occupations, and if they failed to guess their jobs after interrogating them, the celebrity team's entire desk was dragged backwards into a large alcove in the studio wall where they were covered in a positively ludicrous amount of foam and gunge. (If they succeeded, the panel got it instead.)
-   _Tiswas_: There's an interesting example vis buckets of water. One time, the band Rainbow were in the cage (along with some other people). One of them- Tarrant still refuses to say who- lit up a joint live on national TV. Tarrant threw a bucket of water over him (and the spliff) pretty much immediately.
    -   The cage itself is an example of beautiful simplicity: It served no purpose except to house the unfortunates condemned to it, who themselves had no role beyond being drenched at regular intervals.
    -   The same show gave us _The Phantom Flan-Flinger!_ (\*musical sting\*), a 'mysterious' masked and caped figure who would leap out of the shadows at random moments and hurl cream pies at presenters, the audience, the cameramen etc...
-   _Run the Risk_ was created in the UK as a sequel of sorts to _Double Dare_, with the physical challenges usually involving a large knee-deep moat of the stuff. The final part of the show, as the last part of a race where you'd already be quite slippery from other obstacles, was to attempt to climb an inflatable ramp out of the moat while having even more of the stuff poured down on you from the ceiling - naturally this was completely bloody impossible.
-   _Get Your Own Back_ is a show that had kids compete to dunk an authority figure into the "Gunk Dunk", an enormous vat of gunge. One of the most memorable episodes started off as usual only for one of the contestants to reveal their real target... the show's host.
    -   The finale and main attraction of the show went through a number of different forms with games tied to them. In the first series, the 'winning' team (child with the most points and their nominated adult) were both seated poised above a cauldron-like container of watery slime, and had to race to be the first to answer five questions correctly to dunk the other one in. However, if the child ever went in first, they made sure the adult always got it in the end because of the rule that "all children must be accompanied by a grown-up". Hooray.
    -   The second form had a Halloween-style setting, with the adult of the team still poised above the vat but the child now standing inside a gunge booth to the side. In this game, the adult's objective was still to answer five questions correctly and light five pumpkin lights next to them, but they would instantly lose if they ever answered with a word that began with a certain letter announced at the beginning of the game. The questions were usually deliberately set to lead them into doing this (if the letter was B, for example, a question might be "What is the opposite of 'forwards'?" - the adult avoided this one by answering "Reverse"). If they made a mistake or ran out of time, they were plunged into the vat - if they managed to get five correct within the time then their nominator was gunged instead. The rule above still applied, though, even if it made rather less sense in context.
    -   The third series used a much lighter 'fairground' setup, and the child's danger of being gunged was removed entirely (it was replaced very briefly by the Forfeit Furnace, in which the host would 'burn' a forfeit that the child had taken with them if they were on the losing team - thankfully this was dropped very quickly after complaints from viewers, though the host reassured in an interview that no possessions were really destroyed). Instead, the losing adult had to answer three multiple choice questions, where answering wrongly would allow their nominator to pull a lever and cover them in one of three colors of gunge. All this was naturally irrelevant, because in the end they always got to send them into the vat below anyway. Again.
    -   After this, the next few series seemed to settle on a reasonably standard ritualistic format for the Gunk Dunk, an industrial/futuristic set with a chair mounted on a ramp leading down and towards the vat of gunge. The adult was still asked three questions, but this time answering wrongly would, after a rabid call of "Crank 'em up!" from the audience (shown in the page quote), raise them one notch away from the vat ensuring that they would be thrown into it more violently when they were inevitably dunked. For a while, the danger to the child of the team was also reintroduced, with a choice of two levers before the big moment - one of the identical levers would award them an extra prize, the other would release the tank of gunge above their own head.
    -   The last series of the show completely changed the style of the end game, with both teams now taking part, each adult seated on a ramp, and the kids answering questions to slide them up a level - the one who reached the fifth notch first was then thrown in. The team that had accumulated the most points during the game being given a slight head start, but it didn't really shake the feeling that it made the rest of the games slightly pointless.
-   Another UK show by Dave Benson Phillips called "Wake Up in the Wild Room" had most mess via pies in the face from a creepy ghost. However there was one game (frequently but not always played) which resulted in a kid being locked in a gunge tank and their partner finding keys to get them out. Fail and their hair got absolutely ruined with a particularly generous amount of thick and nasty looking gunge.
-   Live And Kicking had the inevitable Saturday Morning Kids’ Show gunge tank built into its set in its last series in about 2000. Members of the studio audience were selected as victims, often apparently as a complete surprise to them. The game played varied throughout the series' unusually long lifetime:
    -   _The Kid Gets It_: A kid from the audience, usually nominated in secret by a friend, would be called down to sit inside the booth, and had to pick one of the celebrity guests on the show that week to attempt the challenge. The chosen player would have to speak for one minute about themselves (often with prompting from the hosts) without saying a certain "trigger word" that had been shown to everyone else via the low-tech medium of a bit of paper waved around at the audience beforehand. Naturally they always said the forbidden word in the end and the Kid very much Got It.
    -   The second variant was also called _The Kid Gets It_, but completely changed the idea to a courtroom-type setup where one contestant would plead the case for gunging one of their friends to a panel of celebrity judges (common crimes included borrowing stuff and not giving it back, or being obsessed with a band the other one couldn't stand). If successful, the friend would be led into the tank and gunged - if not, the nominator would be gunged instead for "wasting the court's time".
    -   Next, the game changed into _The Leakiest Sink_, a fairly poor take-off of _The Weakest Link_, where two players would have to take turns sitting inside the booth while a celebrity guest pulled one of six plugs apparently attached to it somehow. One of these plugs would start up the gunge tank, so the danger increased as the game went on and the chance of picking the 'right' (wrong?) one got higher.
    -   _Stop the Snot_ was the last variant, where the show added a whopping great model nose to the front of the tank. This was similar to the very first game, except a celebrity was quizzed for a minute with the rule that they could never say "Yes" or "No", with results that should be obvious by now should they ever do so.
-   The fondly-remembered Canadian game show _Uh Oh!_, which is played with teams of two. There were a few mini-games chosen by a wheel. The titular Uh Oh! space challenged the player who landed on it with a question. If the player got it right, the team got points, but getting it wrong results in slime being dumped... on their partner.
    -   During the final round, there was a category called "Double Uh Oh!" which (as you can guess) resulted in double points, or double sliming.
    -   And then, there was the premium option of "Uh Oh! Deluxe", which was the same. Except it was worth more points, or your partner got _metallic_ coloured gunge dropped on them.
    -   Not even the audience was safe in this show. The Punisher would dunk a kid in a kiddie pool, or spray the audience with a water gun during the opening, some games had the contestants tossing slime-filled water balloons at some kind of target or bucket (held by audience members)
    -   And the last-place team _always_ got slimed at the end of the show.
-   _Hangar 17_ was a children's magazine-type show that had a couple of sections of this - the first was a talent/variety show section where three acts were judged by a panel of kids while seated underneath giant prop ice cream cones - only the highest scorer was let off. The second section was called _Teacher on the Hotseat_, where a teacher nominated by some of the audience had to sit inside a futuristic cockpit-like booth and answer three questions on the subject they taught, only being told if they had got the answers right (and therefore escaped) at the end. Only one teacher ever escaped the gunging, which was fairly vicious even by British standards, with the stuff being sprayed from all sides of the device before they were finished off with a torrent from above - when this happened, they let him out and put the girl who had nominated him in instead.
    -   There was something similar in the Italian show _"Disney Club"_, where the last segment was the aptly-titled **"Teacher torture"**. If that episode's teacher wasn't able to answer the question... well, do the math.
-   _Eyespy_, a UK show from the 80s, featured gunge cubicles as part of its final obstacle course round. After answering a question correctly to be allowed to start, contestants would have to find pieces of a code by picking from a row of ten cubicles, only finding out if they had picked one of the four safe ones once they had shut themselves inside.
-   _Clockwise_ was another children's show where the contestants risked their cleanliness - it often featured games in which one member of a team would have to save the other. Two memorable examples were the "steady hand" game where one team member would have to guide a loop along a twisted wire, with the addition that the buzzer was also wired up to a gunge tank with their team-mate inside, and a similar one where the teams had to shoot six targets with catapult-like contraptions before time expired. The final round was called the Tunnel of Time, where the winning team would ride a roller coaster car-like thing through a tunnel, having to answer questions while being covered by various devices throughout.
-   _Pump It Up_, another UK game show, used gunge as its entire scoring system - winning any of the games before the final would allow a team to turn off one of the "gunge zones" on the giant inflatable obstacle course at the end. If a zone wasn't turned off when a team reached it, a load of gunge would be spewed down on to them from the ceiling, making progress difficult at best, and if it happened to be on an uphill ramp, hilariously impossible.
-   The British loved this, didn't they? _Twister_ was a game show in 2001 that wasn't often messy, but occasionally had games that involved contestants being fastened in place under huge industrial hoppers and being covered in _ridiculous_ amounts of gunge throughout. One of them was set up so that their team-mates had to avoid hitting "triggers" on the floor - the resultant carnage can be viewed here.
-   Beginning in Season 3, _Wipeout_ began using more gunge in its obstacles, the most prominent examples in the qualification course being the "paint sprayer" Sucker Punch (which added exactly that to its usual content of boxing gloves on sticks), and one that is usually a kitchen-based setting but has a different theme every time in season 4.
-   On the Israeli game show _Crime and Punishment_, participants who made it to the final stage (after beating two others, so it was one finalist per episode) had to sit on a chair above a huge tank of slime while connected to a polygraph. They were told to answer five embarrassing questions truthfully: if they did, they’d get all the money they’d earned (usually around 2,000 NIS); if they failed, they’d fall into the slime and get nothing.
-   _Dick & Dom in da Bungalow_ lived for gunge; all the contestants tended to get mushy peas, tomatoes, rice pudding, and other substances including the sinister Dirty Norris thrown over them during the show, and then the loser would have to sit under a gunge tank for good measure. Possibly the only show to buy custard powder by the tonne.
    -   _The Legend of Dick and Dom_, their follow-up show, has lots of gunge-covered Shout Outs to Da Bungalow, like the heroes being put in the stocks and having tomatoes flung at them.
-   _I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!_ gets celebrities to stick their faces into tanks of slime, get it poured over them or swim in it. Oh, and often there's worms and insects. All this to win food for themselves and their competitors.
-   Canadian kids' show _Zoink'd!_, is pretty much what _The Gong Show_ would be like if it were judged by kids, and pressing their button dropped something on the performers, which progressed up to gunge of course.
-   _Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck_ had this in the form of the "Double Whammy", where, in addition to losing all your current winnings, you also got covered in whatever related to the Whammy animation shown.
-   _@Midnight_: After having featured a clip from a Korean drama involving kimchi being thrown at a character in the opening round, the winner also got kimchi thrown at them.
-   _BOOM!_: Cutting a wrong wire on the Time Bomb associated with your question will result in the bomb "detonating" and spraying you and the audience with gunge.
-   Brazilian show _Passa ou Repassa_ had many contests revolving around soiling yourself (crawling through gunge-covered tunnels, filling a cup atop your head with falling liquid, carrying milkshakes on the head) or your teammate (making gunge "spaghetti" atop his\\her head). The signature contest is even a Pie in the Face Speed Round, where often people would take the opportunity to dirty up the opponent's face and\\or hair as much as possible.
-   MTV (sister channel of Nickelodeon) even got a hold of this trope with its game shows _Trashed_ and _Kidnapped_. On _Trashed_, after two rounds of teams attempting to save their possessions from being destroyed, the third round put one player from each team up for "trashing", which involved gungeing about 50 percent of the time. _Kidnapped_ took this round and made an entire show out of it, seeing three friends attempting to rescue a fourth from repeated tortures, most of which were gungey.
    -   MTV's first ever game show, _Remote Control_, had a mid show "Snack Break". This would entail the contestant holding bowls over their heads as snack food got dumped on them. Typically it would be chips, cheese puffs or other loose food; on at least one occasion, Twinkies — still in the wrapper!— dropped on them.
-   British pirate-themed kids gameshow, _Swashbuckle_ has something called "slop" which is bright green and contains bits of plastic seaweed. The antagonist characters who the team are playing against have to Walk the Plank into a vat of the stuff if the team wins and get repeatedly doused in it in slapstick scenes between rounds.
-   _Fort Boyard_: An unavoidable fate for the contestants facing several challenges is to end up covered in disgusting stuff, such as the mud wrestling, the spiderweb, the tomato sauce fabric or the "Willymix". Though they are at least given the opportunity to clean up before the next challenge, and not stay that way for the rest of the game.

-   _The Dresden Files_: Short story "It's My Birthday, Too!" starts with Harry Dresden and his apprentice Molly arriving home covered from head to shoes in purple pus so malodorous that Harry's pets ran away upon smelling it. When Molly asks if their clothes could be salvaged, Harry just throws his (indestructible) longcoat into the fireplace to burn the sludge off, and tells her he tried bringing his clothes to a laundry after his previous fight with a slime golem, but the next day the laundry's owner set it on fire and attempted Insurance Fraud.
-   At the climax of Daniel Pinkwater's _Young Adult Novel_, the Wild Dada Ducks are suddenly and overwhelmingly assaulted in the Himmler High lunchroom by Kevin Shapiro and his band of Fanatical Praetorians with one thousand portions of extra soggy Grape-Nuts.

-   _All That_, being a Nickelodeon comedy, embraced this repeatedly, but particularly memorable was a combined lampshade/ double subversion: A baker has sent the cast a roomful of cream pies, far more than they could possibly eat, in appreciation of the show. Several cast members ask pointedly what to do with the excess pies, when their Butt-Monkey stage manager walks in. Someone decides to bring the extra pies to the zoo for the zebras. Stage manager calls them on it, and one explains that the baker had also sent over a large cake explicitly for throwing at him.

The sketch further degenerates into a circus setting where the officer is a clown, dumping water on Idle, dropping a large fish down his trousers, upending a bucket of whitewash on him, and shoving a pie into his face, all the time telling him "It's your laugh, mate, not mine!"

-   _Power Rangers_:
    -   _Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers_ did this to Bulk and Skull REPEATEDLY. Cakes, usually, but just about anything could land on those two to end an episode...
    -   Bulk seems to have returned to his role as gunge magnet in _Power Rangers Samurai_.

One episode that had been "taken over" by the Russians features red slimings for saying "free."
    -   Due to the popularity of _You Can't Do That on Television_ on Nickelodeon, the network's Kids' Choice Awards has this done to extreme lengths since the 1980s. Most of the time it happens to celebrity guests, who have included the likes of Will Smith, Jack Black, Robin Williams, Harrison Ford (the source of the page image), Dwayne Johnson, Justin Bieber and Robert Downey Jr.. Green slime has become a motif in the channel's brand.
-   _Young Sheldon_: In "A Free Scratcher and Feminine Wiles", Dr. Lee booby trapped her office so that anyone trying to hack into her computer (in this case, Sheldon) gets their face shot with blue powder.

    Music 

-   The woman on the cover<small>◊</small> of Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass' _Whipped Cream & Other Delights_ was clad in a whipped cream "dress" and what appeared to be absolutely nothing else. For the "Re-whipped" version of the album, the girl on the cover is wearing a whipped cream "bikini".
-   Similarly, the model on the cover of the Ohio Players' album _Honey_ is clad in only honey while suggestively feeding herself the same confection.
-   Comedian Pat Cooper is covered with spaghetti sauce and noodles on the cover of his _Spaghetti Sauce and Other Delights_. It's only one of the myriad lampoons of, and homages to, the _Whipped Cream_ album.
-   This happens to Avril Lavigne in the video for "He Wasn't"
-   Jessie J does this to herself in the video for "Who's Laughing Now"
-   The music video for singer/songwriter Lisa Hannigan's song "Knots" starts with her singing cheerfully in a white dress, playing a white ukulele against a white background. Then a hand comes in and sprays paint on her dress. Then more paint gets sprayed on her. Then more. By two minutes into the song her dress is completely multi-coloured — and then they start spraying paint in her face. Because they could only do it in one take, they couldn't stop, and she admitted that while making the video was great fun, it wasn't easy singing while completely blinded with paint.
-   Happens to two Adams from the music world;
    -   Adam Levine of Maroon 5 in their video for "Love Somebody".
    -   Adam Gontier of Three Days Grace in their video for "Break"
-   Happens to Charli XCX in the video for "Break the Rules", courtesy of a Sadist Teacher played by Rose McGowan. It's presented as a Shout-Out to _Carrie_, but the pink goo thankfully isn't animal blood, and she and everyone else find it fun.
-   Avicii has _The Days_, involving gungesploitation....

    Pro Wrestling 

-   Happened to Chris Jericho on the July 15, 2020 edition of _AEW Dynamite_. After having defeated Orange Cassidy two weeks earlier at the second night of Fyter Fest 2020<sup>*&nbsp;</sup> , he and the Inner Circle went into the ring, and Jericho proceeded to cut a promo on Cassidy, telling the audience that Cassidy wouldn't get a rematch and that his career was dead. Cue Cassidy coming into the arena, listening to a little more of Jericho's remarks, not saying a word, and then slowly raising his fist into a thumbs-down gesture. Followed by the Inner Circle being drenched in orange juice dropped from the rafters. To add further humiliation, Jericho received a towel from ringside to wipe himself off, not finding out until several seconds later that it was an Orange Cassidy towel.

    Roleplay 

-   Played for Drama and mixed with Gorn in _Dawn of a New Age: Oldport Blues_. Zia psychically attacks a reptile monster, causing its brain to explode inside its head.

    Sports 

-   In U.S. sports (most commonly baseball and football), it is a common custom to drench the coach or a key player of a team with whatever is in the cooler after a win, most commonly Gatorade (leading to the ritual being known as a "Gatorade shower").
    -   The New Orleans Saints' head coach got the Nickelodeon slime treatment in a similar fashion after winning an NFL playoff game being simulcast by the channel.
-   A related tradition in Major League Baseball is to give a shaving (or whipped-)cream pie-in-the-face to someone who made a walk-off hit while they are being interviewed after the game.

    Theatre 

-   Traditional British pantomimes often feature a slosh scene at the end of the first act, in which two or more comic relief characters start a completely innocent activity such as baking a cake or putting up wallpaper, and inevitably end up covered in whatever messy stuff they're using.
-   _U.S.L.E.S._ pantomimes, while done on shoestring budgets, still include slosh scenes, although water, talcum powder and shaving foam tend to be substituted for gunge, being both cheap and easy to clean up. Often leads to characters lampshading the inevitable mess with lines like, "Better put down this handy tarpaulin just to be on the safe side!"
-   Martin McDonagh is fond of getting messy: he's got raw eggs to the head in _The Cripple Of Inishmaan_, bone chips/dust in _A Skull in Connemara_, torture with hot oil in _The Beauty Queen of Leenane_, and Gorn that drenches the innocent and not-so-innocent alike in _The Lieutenant of Inishmore_. It's like he does it _just_ to torment the stage management team!

    Theme Parks 

-   In the former _Jimmy Neutron's Nicktoon Blast_ at Universal Studios, Ooblar gets slimed after running into the Nicktoon Studios' "Slime Tower".

    Video Games 

-   A powerup like this will appear in _Backyard Sports: Sandlot Sluggers_.
-   An item called Sticky Juice in _Water Warfare_ will fill your water gun up with, well, sticky juice, which will temporarily cover an enemy in yellow goo that slows them down (and changes your water's splashing animation and sound effects to huge, gloppy splats). The instruction manual calls this Status Effect "soaked," but _we_ know better.
-   This is your entire _means of combat_ in the Platform Game _SPRay: Spirited Prince Ray._
-   In the PS3 game ''Folklore there are certain enemies, such as Impets, that can immobilize the player this way.
-   Can you say _Portal 2_? Three varieties of colored gel involved in numerous puzzles... Unless a player is really careful, they're bound to get covered in the stuff at some point.
    -   Which is something of a worry given this recorded announcement:
        
        **Cave Johnson:** Oh, in case you get covered in that repulsion gel, here's some advice the lab boys gave me: _do not get covered in the repulsion gel._ We haven't entirely nailed down what element it is yet, but I'll tell you this: it's a _lively_ one, and it does _not_ like the human skeleton. Don't worry. It's actually safe enough. _And_ it washes off.
        
-   _Ghostbusters: The Video Game_ follows up from the original films...and this time Venkman _does_ get that second helping. But you and him get even; he coaches you in catching Slimer. From here out, you're discouraged from getting coated, as it's usually a charging ghost, toxic Black Slime, or giant marshmallows being hurled by Stay Puft. All of them hurt. The game does give you an Achievement for getting slimed. It's kind of a rite of passage for that job, one assumes.
-   _Tomb Raider (2013)_: Lara spends a _lot_ of time covered in mud, blood (much of it her own) and general filth.
-   In _Word Rescue_ and _Math Rescue_, this trope was used in lieu of dispatching enemy Gruzzles with violent weaponry. The player character would simply point at the Gruzzle and Benny Bookworm/Butterfly would instantly drop a bucket of pink slime on them. _Math Rescue_ justified this trope by explaining the slime was stink mud, and the Gruzzles slimed by it would teleport to their spaceships to take baths and not return.
-   All the characters in _Splatoon_ are armed with ink-based weaponry. Splattering is a core part of the gameplay. You can actually tell how damaged someone is just by looking at how much of their body is covered in your (team's) ink. Just don't stare too long.
-   _Super Mario Bros._:
    -   _Super Mario Sunshine_: Mario can get completely covered in the various types/colors of sludge he needs to clean up if you slide around in it long enough. A simple spin jump or diving in some water will remove it immediately.
    -   _Mario Party 10_: In Paintball Battle, any players that get hit by a paintball will get covered in paint that matches the color of the paintball that hit them.
-   The Pokémon Goodra is said to enjoy giving their trainer big hugs despite being covered in thick slime.
-   Iva from _Battlerite_ has a Jet Pack that leaks oil, resulting in this trope for any enemies below. She can then follow up with an explosion from her _Rocket X-67_ or _Flame Thrower_ to light the oil.
-   This is the entire motto of the Boomer in the _Left 4 Dead_ games. If it vomits on or explodes near a survivor, s/he'll be a semi-blind zombie magnet until it wears off. Jars of refined bile in _Left 4 Dead 2_ flip the tables for the survivors, who can cover the infected themselves in gunge, although it's not as alluring as the natural bile on a survivor's skin and worker infected don't react to it.
-   _Super Smash Bros._ has this as a gameplay mechanic for Inkling. Several of their moves can temporarily coat their opponents in ink, which acts as a Damage-Increasing Debuff.
-   One of the puzzles in _ZZZZ_ on the ZX Spectrum requires the player to fall (or climb) into a barrel of sludge, so they can gain access to the bathroom upstairs. All this taking place on board a bus; _ZZZZ_, as its name implies, runs on dream logic.
-   In the 8-bit video game _How to Be a Complete Bastard_, the player is required to sabotage a yuppies' party. Several of the yuppies are disposed of by throwing paint, oil or similar over them, at which point they disappear.
-   In the following _Game & Watch_ games and _Gallery_ remakes, these instances result in misses.
    -   _Manhole_: Letting pedestrians fall in sewers. The original game has generic people while the update has Yoshi trying to save Toad, Donkey Kong Jr. and Mario from this fate.
    -   _Oil Panic_: Throwing oil onto customers in the original and Donkey Kong Jr. or Luigi in the remake.
    -   _Mario's Cement Factory_: Letting the mixers overflow. In the original, the excess cement will fall on one of the truck drivers and pin him against the ground. In the modern version, an overflowing basin will dump cookie dough on Yoshi or Toad.
    -   In the updated version of _Rain Shower_, Mario must protect his friends from Bowser's paint balloons. Any character who gets hit will be covered in paint for the rest of the game. Subverted with Yoshi who eats the balloons.
-   Downplayed in _Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout_, since you don't actually see your character covered in it, but many events feature slime as a nod to this trope's use in game shows, either as an inconvenience that slows you down, or a dangerous trap that eliminates players who fall in it.
-   _Game & Watch_: Results in a miss in the following games.
    -   Letting pedestrians fall in an open sewer in _Manhole_.
    -   Throwing oil onto customers in _Oil Panic_.
    -   In _Mario's Cement Factory_, letting one of the mixers overflow and drop cement on one of the truck drivers.
-   In _Red Dead Redemption II_, Arthur Morgan (and in the epilogue, John Marston) can get caked in mud, blood and other some such gunk during strenuous activities, usually pitched gunfights, and thus walk about without a care in the world. Surprisingly for this trope, many NPCs will refuse to give the player the time of day if they're in such a state, and a blood-covered Arthur/John is not only going to cause a panic but local lawkeepers will become hostile to them. the player is usually encouraged to make frequent use of baths dotted around the game world. Finally, if Arthur makes the mistake of returning to his gang's current camp while caked in filth, Miss Grimshaw will make damn sure he washes his face at least.

-   In _TOME_, Doubling and Splats' attacks are slime based.
-   _Dreamscape_: This sometimes happens to people who ride inside CHEN's mouth.
-   _Puffin Forest_: The first game of Dungeons & Dragons Ben ever DM'd had the heroes searching an Absurdly-Spacious Sewer for a missing boy. One of the characters was an athletic, blonde elf war-maiden. She fell into a cesspit while in the sewer and got covered in shit. Things did not improve for her after.

    Webcomics 

-   This is a Running Gag in _Dominic Deegan_, though it hasn't been seen as much as of late. Whenever Dejah, a living Slime, uses his "Slime Geyser" teleport spell, one of the teleported always, _always_, gets covered in slime. It's always, _always_ Luna (and she always, _always_ has an exasperated look on her face when it happens). Well, almost always...
-   A minor antagonist in _Ennui GO!_ is Chocly the Sweetboy, a monster that started out as a Christmas mascot but went horribly bad. It leaves kids it encounters slathered with fudge.
-   _Girl Genius_:
    -   In the "Personal Trainer" side-story, thanks to a clank creation of Aghata, Zeetha ends up (according to Krosp) thrown out "into the pig sty, the duck pond, the _beehives_, a vat of oatmeal, and down the main chimney." Not too surprisingly, the very-much-covered in gunge (and bees) Zeetha is really mad at her student afterward.
    -   Gil ends up covered in green gunk after cutting his way out of a giant carnivorous plant.
-   In _Jupiter-Men_, Quintin can inflict this on others thanks to his slime powers. While getting a gun pointed at him by a gang member, Quintin tries to stick his hands up to get the mugger to wait, only to accidentally fling slime at the man's gun. This slime is so thick that it stops the bullet as mugger tries to pull the trigger, saving Quintin's life.
-   Lloyd and Radic from _Murphy's Law_ get covered in Giant Spider innards.

-   _You Shouldn't Do That in Comics_. Written/"drawn" by a WAM fetishist, and inspired by _You Can't Do That on Television_.

-   It seems like half of the polls on Mister Poll consist of this (you can probably chalk it up under "Weird Fetishes").
-   From The Onion: "Ex-Nickelodeon Stars Relate Horrors Of Green Slime Syndrome".

    Web Videos 

-   The Slow Mo Guys _love_ this, especially since one of their favorite subjects to film is paint. 9 times of 10, it's Dan who ends up covered, although Gavin is not immune to getting splattered. One episode of _The Super Slow Show_ was the duo getting blasted with _eight paint cannons._

    Western Animation 

-   Subverted in an episode of _Arthur_ where the characters begin pulling mean pranks on Francine after she insults one of them. One of their teachers, who's working as a fortune teller at a fair, tells them that she can rig things so that Francine will get covered in goop from a box trap during a visit to her. They eagerly agree but when Francine laments during her fortune-telling session how she regrets her insult and feels saddened that everyone has been doing nothing but mocking her, they feel guilt and decide not to activate the trap. The subversion is doubled down on when they leave and the teacher activates the trap, revealing that the box actually didn't contain any goop but confetti instead.
-   _Avatar: The Last Airbender_:
    -   "The Boy in the Iceberg": Sokka is instantly established as the local Butt-Monkey when he gets covered in flying bison snot.
    -   "Return to Omashu": Sokka gets covered in sewer slime when he, Aang, and Katara sneak into Omashu. Aang and Katara can protect themselves by bending the gunk out of the way, but it all winds up on Sokka.
    -   "The Drill": Tunnel boring machines often mix the excavated soil with water to ease removal. No prizes for guessing where two thirds of Ozai's Angels and three-fourths of the Gaang end up at the end.

-   _The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes_: In "Living Legend", the Avengers (and much of the surrounding area) are left in this state after they manage to defeat the Blob Monster Doughboy.
    
    **Thor:** Victory... is ours.  
    **Wasp:** Hooray.
    
-   In an episode of _Batman: The Animated Series_, Harley Quinn bakes a gigantic cream pie for the Joker... and lies in it waiting for him.
-   _Danny Phantom_:
    -   Tucker was a victim when ghost hunters attacked him when he was dressing up as a ghost. We earn this gem:
        
        **Tucker:** _\[covered in ectoplasm\]_ I'm not gonna grow a third arm, am I?
        
    -   And a few seconds before we get this one:
        
        **Sam:** In retrospect, maybe dressing like a ghost in a parking lot full of ghost hunters wasn't a great idea.
        
-   Dexter in _Dexter's Laboratory_ wound up repeatedly covered in mud, pies, whipped cream, etc. while competing against Dee Dee on a game show. Somehow his Nerd Glasses always remained clear so he could register his displeasure.
-   _Fanboy and Chum Chum_ characters are prone to this, but especially Fanboy.
    -   He has been sneezed on, covered with Frosty Freezy Freeze, gotten a Pie in the Face several times, been assaulted with eggs, had the school cafeteria food all over him and once his costume got so dirty it actually _came to life_.
    -   The episode "Slime Day" is all about the eponymous duo trying to get covered in slime by saying the secret phrase before the day is over, but they're too stupid to figure out what the secret phrase is.
-   In the _Generator Rex_ episode "Breach", when Rex started destroying everything around him to cause Breach to create portals so that he could try to escape, all while Breach is throwing out the junk into different parts of the world, a portal appeared right over some Evo scorpions that Six and Bobo were fighting, dropping some junk and squishing the bugs. What came next was white goop (ice cream) covering both Six and Bobo. Bobo comments, "I'm not complaining."
-   More or less the entire idea behind the Discovery Kids show _Grossology_.
-   _Kaeloo_: In the episode "Let's Play Market Vendors", Quack Quack blows bubbles out of yogurt. When he makes a particularly large one, it pops and Kaeloo, Stumpy and Mr. Cat are covered in yogurt.
-   _Metalocalypse_ — already upset at believing he's not getting the respect his bandmates get, Toki is slimed while getting a kids-choice award, turning him dark and angry, especially toward kids.
-   _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_:
    -   In "Baby Cakes", Pinkie Pie gets covered in soppy dough after getting sprayed with bathwater and then dumping a bag of flour on herself to amuse a pair of baby twins.
    -   In "Make New Friends and Keep Discord", Discord's guest at the Grand Galloping Gala is the Smooze, a Blob Monster. Pretty much everyone in the episode gets covered in the resulting goo at some point. Several ponies also get messy when Discord smashes a watermelon.
-   _The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh_: In the episode "The Old Switcheroo", Tigger and Roo get covered in mud and bubblegum while playing together.
-   _Robot Chicken_ had this as the end of the first season and opening of the second, in a Shout-Out to _You Can't Do That on Television_. (Same set, same trigger words.)
-   _The Simpsons_: In "Brother from the Same Planet", Homer tries to make it up to Bart (for forgetting to pick him up after soccer practice) by offering him a hot-fudge sundae, but he accidentally spills it over his head.
-   _Steven Universe:_
    -   One off-screen mission in "Tiger Millionaire" ends with Amethyst getting Steven covered in goo from a "blood polyp". Steven being Steven, he's not particularly bothered, until it crystalizes, leaving him stuck in one place for hours.
    -   A typical side effect of destroying Plug Robonoids is they spray goop everywhere afterward. The first time this happens in "Marble Madness", Amethyst, who is covered head to toe in the stuff, gleefully chases after Pearl to give her a "goop hug". Then she gives Garnet one too.
-   Happens quite frequently in _Thomas & Friends_ as a result of the many accidents on Sodor. Percy and Thomas are the most frequent victims of this.
-   In the _Vampirina_ episode "April Ghoul's Day", the first prank that Vee plays on Poppy and Bridget is to dump a bucket of slime on them.
