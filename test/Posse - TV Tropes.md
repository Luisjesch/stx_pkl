A group of men deputized by The Sheriff or U.S. Marshal to assist in the pursuit of justice, such as capturing fugitives.

The word comes from the Latin phrase "_posse comitatus_", roughly "to have the right to an armed retinue." In the 1800s, especially in the Old West before the appearance of organized police forces, a town often had only one or two law-enforcement officers: the sheriff, maybe a deputy, perhaps a US Marshal. If the sheriff needed several men to deal with a crisis, he could essentially draft any man handy (with certain restrictions) into a posse to handle the situation. The process would often include the line "I hereby deputise you."

After 1878, it was illegal to use military personnel in a posse. As more jurisdictions formed large organized police forces, posses became unnecessary. Nowadays many jurisdictions have banned the formation of posses, because sheriffs seldom have need of them due to improved communications and manpower.

Note that if it is not legally convened by a sheriff or marshal, the group of men is _not_ a "posse", even if they call themselves that. They're just a mob or gang. Although, if they do claim to be an apparatus of justice, see Vigilante Militia.

In modern slang, a "posse" is just a group of people who hang out with each other all the time; see Girl Posse and Production Posse for examples of this sort of "posse."

    Literature 

-   The western novel series started by William Johnstone and his niece J.A. frequently have civilian posses formed to pursue bank robbers, murderers, and the like, generally after a villainous Establishing Character Moment. In most books, they get attacked in an ambush and are either wiped out or turn back in fright after losing a member or two. On a few occasions (such as in _MacCallister: The Eagles Legacy: Kingdom Come_), the posse successfully captures the killers, only for them to pull off a bloody jailbreak later on. On the rare occasions where a main character is part of an organized posse (such as in _Blood Bond: Gunsight Crossing_ and _Revenge of the Mountain Man_), the whole affair is likely to be a Roaring Rampage of Revenge.
-   _The Ox-Bow Incident_ by Walter Van Tilburg Clark, a book later turned into a movie, has a posse illegally drafted by a deputy sheriff. By the end, the sheriff forms a genuine posse.
-   In _Star Wars: Kenobi_, the group of settlers who participate in the Settlers' Call refer to themselves as a posse, and there isn't a legal authority in rural Tatooine to contest the designation. Settlers who buy in to the Call have a loudspeaker mounted on their property in case of a raid by the Sand People; when it's activated, it broadcasts a krayt dragon roar to scare the Tuskens off, then transitions into a siren (and also a radio transmission) that calls the posse to the location, ready to drive the Tuskens away or hunt them down in retaliation.
-   _The Steel Bonnets_: By law, after a raid, the victim clan had the right of "trod" to pursue the raiders for a week after they struck. If they set off within a couple of hours, it was a "hot trod", if they set off within a week, it was a "cold trod". There were well understood differences between a trod and a reprisal raid, the chief one being that a trod was aimed (at least nominally) towards recovering specifically named and enumerated property stolen by a band of raiders, whereas a reprisal raid was basically "you stole from us so we're gonna steal from you".
-   In Edgar Pangborn's short story "Tiger Boy", which is set in the same post-holocaust world as his novel _Davy_, some villagers form a posse (legal status unclear) to apprehend the title character whom they consider to be a demon with an animal familiar. Actually he's just some kid who wanders around with a half-tame tiger looking for a friend, and he finds one in the form of an intelligent but mute village boy. The two of them plan to run away together, but with the posse on their trail it can't end well.

    Live Action TV 

-   _Bonanza_ had a posse formed at least three times a season. With 15 seasons, that's a lot of posse forming.
-   _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_. In "The Circle", Constable Odo deputizes petty crook and gambler Quark because he needs the Ferengi's underworld contacts to gather information on who's supplying weapons for an coming Civil War. Quark finds this Actually Pretty Funny until Odo points out the alternative—he locks up Quark for obstruction at a time when Quark might need to get off the space station in a hurry. Despite the Space Western themes of DS9 however, Odo never goes as far as forming a posse of civilians, relying instead on Starfleet personnel or Bajoran security deputies to back him up when needed.
-   _Supernatural_ has a Wild West themed episode that involves the formation of a posse. Dean is very happy about that. He loves the posse. He's a posse magnet.
-   _Twin Peaks_ has the Bookhouse Boys, townsfolk recruited by the Sheriff to help in some.... slightly less than legal law enforcement operations.

    Music 

-   The song "One Hour Ahead of the Posse" by Burl Ives, which told the story of a murderer trying to reach the Rio Grande river and sanctuary in Mexico.

    Newspaper Comics 

-   One _The Far Side_ cartoon shows why the sheriff should be the one doing this. 'A posse is something you have to _organize_.'

    Tabletop Games 

-   Inquisitors in _Warhammer 40,000_ have the power to Flashed-Badge Hijack anything up to and including entire planetary populations, but most just run around with a small retinue that serves the same purpose as a Posse.
    -   The spinoff game _Inquisitor_ is based around such retinues battling each other.
    -   In _Dark Heresy_ 1st Edition, the player characters are deputized civilian agents of the Inquisition called "acolytes", recruited by an Inquisitor and organized into discreet cells that carry out whatever odd-job assignments their master hands them. This is treated as distinct from an Inquisitor's personal retinue, as acolytes are considered largely expendable and are expected to accomplish their goals with as little direct help from their master as possible.

    Theme Parks 

-   _Tweetsie Railroad_: The Marshal always travels with them, and since the train show became more comedic, they are hilariously incompetent and generally not very bright.

    Video Games 

-   You can form or join posses in _Red Dead Redemption_'s multiplayer. You can also incur the wrath of some NPC posses if you're sufficiently villainous or have a big enough bounty on your head. You'll also join Marshal Leigh Johnson's posse in the course of the story campaign. One comprised of the US Army comes for you at the end of the game when your Bureau handler turns on you. There's no running from them, and no surviving their overwhelming ambush. Just take out as many as you can.

    Web Original 

-   _Swarm on the Somme_: The posses in the United States don't last very long against the Grex, especially in trying to eradicating Grex nests.
