**TV's Frank:** I shaved my head and got you a watch fob.  
**Dr. Forrester:** Oh, you sold your hair and bought me this beautiful watch fob?  
**TV's Frank:** ..._Sold_ my hair? No.

A plot reproducing "The Gift of the Magi", where two people buy a present for each other — each gift meant to go with something the other highly values — and then find that both of them had to sell their respective treasures to pay for each other's gift, making the gifts simultaneously priceless and worthless.

In a common variation, the story is given a Lighter and Softer ending in which both characters get back the items they sacrificed. This is likely if they both sold their precious objects to the same person who realises what is happening, and even more likely if that person is a mutual friend or relative.

This is a Sub-Trope of Whole-Plot Reference, Prized Possession Giveaway and Sell What You Love, and a multiple person subtrope of Two Rights Make a Wrong. In homage to the original it's often used in a Christmas Episode, though it doesn't have to be.

Compare Tragically Misguided Favor and Outhumbling Each Other. A Sister Trope to Christmas Every Day, Yet Another Christmas Carol, It's a Wonderful Plot, How the Character Stole Christmas, Always Need What You Gave Up, and The Parody Before Christmas. Has nothing to do with The Gift.

Sapphire got attacked by a wild Salamence and Ruby fended it off, getting injured in the process. When Ruby saw how scared she was, he thought she was scared of his strength and decided to give up on battling and focus on beauty, believing that when they met again that he would dazzle her with his beauty and grace. Sapphire berated herself for being too weak to defend herself and getting Ruby hurt, so she decided to give up on beauty and focus on strength, believing that when they met again that she would impress him with her battling prowess.

When Hiei meets the surgeon again and has to duel him, the surgeon agrees to rescind the condition if Hiei wins. While Hiei claims that he had no intention of ever revealing himself to his sister, the surgeon believes that actually meeting her might have changed Hiei's mind.

    Literature 

-   The Trope Maker is O. Henry's Short Story "The Gift of the Magi". One Christmas, Della sells her long hair to a wigmaker to buy a chain for her husband Jim's heirloom watch, only to discover that Jim pawned the watch to buy combs to pin up her hair. While it's a "Shaggy Dog" Story and there's no indication that Jim ever gets the watch back, the author chooses to focus on the paradoxical wisdom of their Act of True Love, which — foolish as it was — proved they loved each other more than they loved their most treasured possessions.
-   There is a parody sequel to the story where the husband trades his arms to an armless French hatmaker for a fancy hat, and the wife sells her _head_ to the wigmaker so she can buy him a wristwatch.
-   There was a short story in the children's magazine _Cricket_ in which the protagonist sold an heirloom decorative plate to buy her boyfriend a bike helmet, and he sold his bike to buy her a carved wooden display stand for the plate.

-   In the _Cars_ story "The Best Present Ever", Mater longs to go to Kersploosh Mountain for Christmas to try out the one-day ice slide, but Lightning has to go to Russia to compete in an Ice Racers Cup that week.

When they receive their presents, they reveal to each other about the switch-up and are upset having left with presents they can't use, but are happy to be best friends and spending Christmas with each other is a true gift. Fortunately, the problem gets resolved at the end when they use the tires to make a new two-person sled so they can go to Kersploosh Mountain after all.
-   _Discworld_: Subverted in _Hogfather_, when the Dean gives the Bursar a box to keep his dried frog pills in. The Bursar, naturally, doesn't have any pills to put in it... because the Dean already swiped them from the Bursar's room, so he wouldn't have to shell out any more money to give him a _full_ pillbox.
-   _Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas_ has a variation: Emmet has to put a hole in his mother's washtub, and she has to sell his tools, for both of them to enter a talent contest to win money to buy gifts for each other. The washtub and tools were unrelated to the gifts they had in mind, but they were the only means either of them had to make a living. In a rather depressing variation on the tale, they both lose.

-   The final book of _The Saddle Club_ series has a three-way variation between the three members of the eponymous club. All three of them want to ride in a prestigious horse show a few days after Christmas, but it's a seventy-five dollar entry fee, their parents won't or can't pay, and Carole and Stevie are forced to spend their savings on a new bridle and new boots respectively (Carole's bridle was falling apart and Stevie's boots no longer fit), while Lisa didn't have the money to begin with. Meanwhile, Spoiled Brat Veronica DiAngelo — who has more money than she knows what to do with — is openly coveting Stevie's new boots and Carole's new bridle (both of which were the last of each item in the store), and has also missed the deadline to order the application form for the aforementioned show. Come Christmas, it's revealed that each of them sold Veronica something for exactly seventy-five dollars in order to give one of the others the entry fee money as a Christmas gift; Stevie sold Veronica her boots to give Carole the entry fee, Carole sold Veronica her bridle to give Lisa the entry fee, and Lisa sold Veronica her application to give Stevie the entry fee. It ultimately works out for them; the show turns out to be a moot issue because the three of them and the horses get snowed in at Pine Hollow and would have had to miss the show anyway, Stevie and Carole use the money they got to buy back the boots and bridle, and Lisa decides to use her seventy-five dollars to treat the club to something special.
-   An odd variation in Christopher Moore's _The Stupidest Angel: A Heartwarming Tale of Christmas Terror_.

But when Christmas comes Theo wants to get her a priceless antique sword that would be absolutely perfect for her Action Girl persona. To afford it, he starts growing pot again to sell it and falls off the wagon. Meanwhile, she's getting him a massive, elaborate bong. To afford that, she stops taking her meds.

-   Kind of the basis of the _iCarly_ episode "iDon't Want to Fight", on one side. It's Carly and Sam's 5th friendship anniversary, and Carly gives Sam a Special T-Shirt, while Sam promises to give Cuddlefish concert tickets, so she trades the T-Shirt to "Ripoff Rodney" for the tickets.

To which Frank responds, "Oh, Henry!"
    -   Parodied _again_ in the _Santa Claus (1959)_ episode: Frank shaved his head and bought Dr. Forrester a watch fob (one half of the original _Gift of the Magi_ story), but Dr. Forrester had neglected to buy Frank _anything_. He tried to save face with a $25 savings bond, but Frank was, to say the least, not pleased with the results. ("My hair! My beautiful head of TV's Frank hair!")

Not a completely straight example as the painting would be a home for everyone living in the Painted World.
-   The original is discussed by Jeanne d'Arc Santa Alter Lily in her debut event in _Fate/Grand Order_. She's not a fan of the ending:
    
    Personally, the truly moving moment kinda falls flat! Hair can grow out, but the special family watch is gone forever! From the way the story goes, the husband prolly won't be getting a new watch. And every time the wife uses the combs, she'd feel real bad, and every time the husband sees the combs, he'd feel kinda dumb. And that's bad. 'Course they wanted to be nice, but their gifts didn't make them magi, they made them dummies!

-   Parodied in _Futurama:_ Zoidberg gave combs to Amy, who sold her hair to buy combs for Hermes, who sold his hair to buy combs for Zoidberg (who he hates more than anyone, and who is bald). Zoidberg thanks him, saying this will go great with his new hair—then removes his hat to reveal Hermes' and Amy's hair.
    
    **Zoidberg:** Finally! I look as pretty as I feel!
    
-   A non-Christmas example happens in an episode of _Horseland_. Two of the girls, who are siblings, sell clothes that will match things they own for a parade. Unlike the original story, they solve the problem that the thing that matches each clothing item was sold by having them sell something else that wasn't clothing to buy fabric.
-   The _Looney Tunes_ short "Really Scent" saw the object of Pepé Le Pew's affections finally realize that Pepe was the only male giving her attention at all. So, in an attempt to make the relationship work, she hung around a limburger factory to gain a bad smell. Meanwhile, Pepe finally realized that it was his stench that had put the cat off and hung around a perfume factory to gain a good smell. The end of the short sees a nice turnaround to the Mad Love scenario: the cat chasing the skunk.
-   One of the stories told in _Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas_ sees Minnie Mouse selling her watch to buy Mickey a case for his harmonica, while Mickey has pawned his harmonica to get her a chain for her watch. As in the original short story, no setting-right takes place come Christmas morning.
-   The short series _The Mix-Ups_ had a short in which each of the main characters sells a possession to buy another a birthday present. They all end up receiving presents meant to go with the things they sold but fortunately manage to find new uses for them.
-   The _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_ episode "The Gift of the Maud Pie" uses only half of this trope, with Pinkie Pie selling her party cannon to get her sister Maud a rock pouch, while Maud simply bought Pinkie confetti to use for the cannon. Upon learning what happened, Maud re-exchanges the pouch so her sister can have her cannon back.
-   Played With in the _Phineas and Ferb_ Christmas Special. Jeremy gives Candace a pair of earrings that she wanted (and was going to have her good necklace made into a pair like them), but he sold his guitar (which he was going to trade in for a silver one) to pay for them. Candace, meanwhile, buys the silver guitar by selling her good necklace, so instead of them both losing something they valued for a pointless gift they both ended up with the same things they would have if neither bought any presents at all.
    -   One comic story in the _Phineas and Ferb_ magazine has the titular stepbrothers making gifts for each other for National Inventor's Day. Phineas has his wrenches melted down to make a steel carrying case for Ferb's blueprints, while Ferb cuts his blueprints into a pegboard for Phineas' wrenches.
-   _Robot Chicken_ had a great parody of this story- the wife naturally sells her hair to buy a chain for her husband's pocket watch. When we see the husband trying to buy his wife some combs, the shopkeeper suggests he sell his watch to afford them... only for the husband to point out that his watch is an antique in perfect working condition and is worth way, way more than a pair of combs, no matter how fancy. "What are they, solid gold?" <sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  He buys her some lingerie instead.
-   In the first _Rugrats_ Christmas special, "The Santa Experience", Angelica puts Phil and Lil in a "Gift Of The Magi" Plot situation as part of a prank: she trades Lil a Reptar space helmet to give to Phil in exchange for her favorite coloring book, and takes Phil's Reptar doll in exchange for a box of crayons that he can give to Lil. Upon discovering that bad kids don't get presents, however, Angelica struggles to fix the situation, and ultimately gives them their original presents back as their Christmas gifts.
-   In _The Simpsons_ episode "White Christmas Blues", Lisa gives Bart a book for Christmas, not because she knew he would like it, but because she wanted to make herself feel good, which he calls her out on while burning said book. Lisa later makes up for it by buying Bart a kindle, which she got by selling the gift Bart had given her. She states she got the idea from a book, "The Gift of the Magi" which she downloaded onto the kindle. This only makes Bart assume that Maggie actually gave him the gift, but Lisa is passing it off as her own.
-   Parodied in a Show Within a Show in _SpongeBob SquarePants_ episode "Idiot Box", during Squidward's Cold Turkeys Are Everywhere sequence: "I couldn't afford a present this year, so I got you this box." "That's what I got you!"
-   In the _Squidbillies_ episode "Pile M for Murder," the Cuylers sell all the dirt on their land to buy gas so they can go mudding... in the mud they no longer have.
-   In _Star vs. the Forces of Evil_ finale, Star is prepared to leave her world and everyone in it forever in order to be with Marco on Earth, only to find that the portal had already closed. However as it turned out, Marco had done the exact same thing in an attempt to be with Star.
-   In the _Teen Titans Go!_ episode "Opposites", Cyborg and Jinx's respective teams wouldn't allow them to date. Jinx managed to convince the HIVE Five to turn good, but Cyborg convinced the Titans to turn evil, so they were still enemies.

    Real Life 

-   In one of his volumes of kidspeak, Rabbi Chaim Potok shares a letter from a young boy who sold his fancy and expensive calculator to buy ink for his father's beloved fountain pen. His reasoning is that his father's birthday is coming up and that his calculator's battery, which is a rare and hard to obtain type, has run out. When his father's birthday comes, he presents his father with his gift, only for the father to reveal that he has sold his pen to buy batteries for the calculator.
