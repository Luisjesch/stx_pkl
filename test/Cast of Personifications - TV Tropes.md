_"You are utterly the stupidest, most self-centered, appallingest excuse for an anthropomorphic personification on this or any other plane! \[…\] I don't believe this Dream, you're as bad as, as – as Desire!"_

If you're wondering about "what if a group of things are shown as humans, what would they do", look no further than this trope. This is Older Than Dirt, as people since the beginning of time tended to assign personality and (usually humanoid) form to the phenomena of the world, usually because humans understood them better that way: this is the basis for many mythologies. Similarly, works with this trope are made because of the potential human perspective of the things that are personified, or at least the chance to see what they would say or how they would interact with the world.

Usually, the work will treat the personified characters like the things they originally were, only with them being able to talk to each other and act like humans. Sometimes, however, they might lampshade their "humanity" as something alien to them; among other things, they may question why or how they became humans (or why they got sapience or sentience to begin with), or lament about how lame humanity is, or how good being "humans" may be, etc. They may also sometimes get an equivalent of Furry Reminder in that they hang a lampshade over what they originally are.

How they actually become personified is usually not addressed; however, some works may either show them turning into humans, or have them question how they become humans in the first place, if not actively seeking answers for it.

Sub-Trope of Anthropomorphic Personification and Moe Anthropomorphism. Compare Cute Monster Girl, which is when monsters or other inhuman beings resemble attractive human girls, One Person, One Power, which is often a subtler version of this trope, Nations as People, which is about the personifications of countries appearing in a work regardless of whether the cast is mostly personifications or not, Animate Inanimate Object, where inanimate objects are given life but not human form, and World of Funny Animals, where the work takes place in a world where everyone is an animal with some amount of human traits. Those tropes and this one _can_ overlap, though this trope is more about non-human objects and concepts being depicted as humans.

Other, minor characters in the movie are personifications of other things in your mind, such as fears, dreams, memory, and more.
-   _Osmosis Jones_ depicts the human body as a city and the various cells as its citizens. White blood cells, like the title character, are cops, while germs and viruses are criminals.
-   _My Moon_ centers around personifications of the Earth, Sun and Moon, and depicts daytime and nighttime on Earth as a Love Triangle between the characters.

    Literature 

-   The titular _American Gods_. The old gods are characters from old-world mythology and are a hit-or-miss with this trope, depending on their traditional domains, but they interact with the new gods, which are personifications of modern crazes (eg. media, technology).
-   The _Hello Ruby_ series by Linda Luikas, meant to introduce young children to programming and computer science, features many real-world programming languages and software as typical storybook characters (humans, animals, Animate Inanimate Objects..). There's the eponymous Ruby, Robots (Android), Penguin (Linux), Django, Python, Foxes (Mozilla Firefox), Snow Leopard (Mac OS X Snow Leopard), Scratch Cat, Julia, and many, _many_ more.

    Myths & Religion 

-   Classical Mythology:
    -   The twelve Olympian gods and the numerous minor gods all represent a specific concept (be it an abstract concept or a natural phenomenon). Ares/Mars represents war, Aphrodite/Venus represents love, Hades/Pluto represents the dead, Poseidon/Neptune represents the sea, Dionysus/Bacchus represents wine, etc. In the case of minor gods, their name often literally is the Greek/Latin word for the concept their represent: Nike/Victoria means "victory", Thanatos/Mors means "death", Eros/Cupid means "desire", etc.
    -   Even deeper are the primordial gods and Titans who represents much bigger concepts; such as Erebus ("darkness") and Gaia ("earth"). Compare the sun titan Helios and sun god Apollo.

    Music 

-   _Tsukiuta_ is the months of the year as idols. There's a boy and a girl for each month. Their parent agency, Tsukipro, has groups based on the elements (fire, earth, air, water) and on birthstones, also including a group that's a bunch of personifications of Glico brand sweets.

    Toys 

-   _Milky Way and the Galaxy Girls_ personifies the solar system as a diverse group of women who wear roller blades, though the physical planets still exist.

    Video Games 

-   _Food Fantasy_ is a mobile game in which you summon personified food called Food Souls to battle Fallen Angels and manage restaurants. The Food Souls are said to be spirits that inhabited the food, and have very human-like appearances. Foods from around the world are personified.
-   _Genesis Noir_ is a Film Noir story about the personifications of various physical concepts (Noman is Time, Ms. Mass is Mass, Golden Boy is Energy and/ or the Golden Ratio) and how Golden Boy shooting Ms. Mass after she cheated on him with Noman Caused the Big Bang with Noman using his Time Master powers to try to undo it.
-   _KanColle_ is a game where you as an Admiral gather and organize "fleet girls" (_kanmusu_), warships that take form of girls, in a war against horrors of the sea, called the "Abyssal Fleet". Specifically, the fleet girls personify ships that took part in World War II, and bring with them the characteristics and history of each ship in question. At first the ships are taken from the Imperial Japanese Navy, but later updates give us ships from Germany and Italy, and even later ones give us ships from the Allies' side as well.
-   _Touken Ranbu_ has you as a time-traveling sage gathering various Japanese swords and give them life and human forms - as pretty boys, that is. Specifically, they're the swords used by various historical Japanese figures, such as Okita Souji or Oda Nobunaga, and brings with them characteristics and history of each swords in question (along with their former owners). Unlike _KanColle_ (both this and that game are made by DMM), this game explains how they came to be.
-   _Warship Girls_ is pretty much the Chinese's response to _KanColle_, as it also features personified World War II warships, in form of girls. The difference is that they featured ships of multiple countries right off the bat as opposed to just the IJN.
-   The cast of the _Neptunia_ series consists of personifications of game consoles, video game companies and video game franchises. Villains also often personify some game-related concept, such as digital piracy. This isn't present for all sides of the console wars, however: the PC Continent has none due to there being so solid console for PC gaming (the closest they've got to one is the anime universe's Setag, and the one that would have held that distinction died some time ago), although mobile gaming is personified as the nation's handheld counterpart.
-   _Disco Elysium_ does this with the Player Character's skills. As skill points are invested into the skills, they start manifesting as voices inside his head and essentially become party members in their own right, chiming in with advice, their own opinions, conflicting desires, and even personal sidequests as you encounter different situations. You banter back and forth with them throughout the game, even stopping in mid-conversation with other people to hear them out or argue with them. Interestingly, skills can also become too strong if too many points are invested in them. What begins as advice can eventually become a compulsion, restricting what dialogue options you can choose in certain circumstances or just becoming overbearingly loud compared to the other skills.
-   _Virgo Versus the Zodiac_: Many of the characters are personifications of the Western Zodiac constellations and their stars. The Zodiacs are also said to be the children of the personifications of the planets, the sun, and the moon; for example, Virgo and her sister Gemini are both children of Mercury. The Mutable Ending reveals that these are all people's memories of those things given forms.

    Visual Novels 

-   In _her tears were my light_, all the characters are the Moe Anthropomorphisms of aspects of the universe, namely time, space, and the void. They all have the forms of young women who have powers related to what they personify.

    Web Animation 

-   The cast of _AstroLOLogy_ consists of the animals of the Western Zodiac, in humanoid forms, with personalities that supposedly fit those of the people who are born under their respective constellations (so, for example, Leo is prideful while Pisces has a creative flair).
-   _Grej_, like Jreg below, have a cast who personify political ideologies. Rather than the main characters being extremist ideologies, they are so extreme they can't be put on a political compass. Their enemies are the Realists, who personify different realist ideas.

-   _Afganisu-tan_ explains the history of the relationships between the nations of Central Asia by personifying them as cute little girls. The contrast between the playful antics of the characters and the somber explanations of what historical event it represents is striking.
-   _Scandinavia and the World_ is a comedy that centers around the personifications of the Scandinavian countries interacting with each other, with less frequent appearances from other countries.
-   (Pictured above) _Nebula_ is a story about the personifications of the solar system, who act out various space phenomena- Earth gets into other planets' personal space and asks them intrusive questions, Sun is in charge because everyone is intimidated by him, etc. They're all shown as Monstrous Humanoids who lack faces and who are nearly immortal unless killed.
-   _Hetalia: Axis Powers_ uses anthropomorphic personifications of various nations across the world as the main characters, using typical stereotypes to create the exaggerated personalities.
-   _Periodus_ is about the personifications of four elements on the periodic table living together in one house.

-   Most of the creatures from _Awful Hospital_ are "conceptoids," who are an embodiment of, well, a concept. Chip, for example, is a Soul-Sucking Retail Job represented by a nervous young man wearing a Starbucks uniform, with a cup of coffee for a head. Another one embodies infestation itself, manifesting as a Cute Witch and a sapient colony of maggots at different points in the story.
-   _Stellarscape_: The cast prominently features anthropomorphized versions of stars, with the protagonist being the brightest star in the Orion constellation, Rigel. The Character Blog also confirms that side characters included anthropomorphized planets, but they never featured in the comic.

    Web Original 

-   _Jreg_:
    -   Jreg's videos usually deal with personifications of different political ideologies from all across the political spectrum. The _Centricide_ series has the four extremes of the political compass put aside their differences to fight off a group of centrist ideologies. As their leader Jreg regards them as an example of the Golden Mean Fallacy and getting in the way of progress.
    -   After _Centricide_ was completed, Jreg began a new series called _The Mental Illnesses_ about a cast of personified mental illnesses.
-   _Personifications_ is a roleplay about the personifications of the Seven Heavenly Virtues and the Seven Deadly Sins interacting with each other. While they are mostly immortal, they can be killed and a new entity personifying that thing will come into existence. Personifications of things other than virtues and sins also exist in that universe, such as Money and Love.
-   _Fandomstuck_ takes this to a new level: it's a largely tumblr-driven Shared Universe that revolves around the personifications of various fandoms that have sprung up around popular tv shows, books, animes, and webcomics — including but not limited to Homestuck, Hetalia: Axis Powers, Supernatural, Sherlock, Doctor Who, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, etc...
-   _My Senior, IE-kun_ is an independent "Office slapstick comedy about a silly Senior and his competent juniors".<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Earth-Chan, which is a bunch of comics where the solar system (plus a black hole) is depicted as cute anime girls.
-   Before Earth-chan came to fruition, there was a huge fandom around "JupitEarth", also known as the Milky Way Fandom, which also personified planets. In September 2012, Jupiter blocked an asteroid collision from Earth; Tumblr users humorously started shipping the two, and then it quickly spiraled into a full-on _fanfiction_ about personified characters of Jupiter and Earth in a relationship. It wasn't long before other fanartists started making ships and characters dedicated to other celestial objects (Earth x Mars, or Marth, not to be confused with the Fire Emblem character, also gained some traction thanks to the fandom popping up a month after the Curiosity rover's landing), and the fandom got so big so fast it even inspired an article from the Daily Dot.

    Western Animation 

-   The _What A Cartoon!_\-era _Dexter's Laboratory_ episode "Dimwit Dexter" uses this inside his brain.

-   _Il était une fois... la Vie_ (_Once Upon a Time... Life_) is an education animated series about the human body, with most of the characters being personification of white cells, red cells, microbes, virus, nutrients, and "workers" inside the cells themselves. They do look like the Universal-Adaptor Cast of the other series in the franchise, and we do also see the humans whose activities lead to whatever drama happens inside their bodies.
