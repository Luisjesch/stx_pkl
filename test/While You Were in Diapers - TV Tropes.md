_"While you were still learning how to SPELL YOUR NAME, I was being trained TO CONQUER GALAXIES!"_

_I was describing tropes here while you were in kindergarten._

For some people, looking back at their past achievements is not a sign they are over the hill, but a sign that they've been awesome all along, and that the awesome just compounded over the years. This trope comes into play with them saying to younger people that they were doing awesome things when those younger people were too young to do anything great, or maybe even before they were a gleam in their parents' eyes, often in the form of "I was doing X while you were in diapers."

Sometimes said by old people, but more often than not it is said by any adult character to claim that they have Seen It All, or as a Badass Boast. It is unlikely to find a Chekhov's Gun in those boasts, as those past experiences rarely become plot-relevant later on.

A common variation is a Long-Lived character, or an immortal supernatural being, stating "I was doing X while your ancestors were in diapers." Also, "I've forgotten more about X than you will ever know!"

Cultural Posturing often involves this kind of statement, except that it's "my culture was awesome when your culture was still banging rocks together!"

In real life, you _really_ should keep this to a minimum, or better yet, not at all. It's very hard to do this without coming off as condescending or dismissive.

Compare When I Was Your Age..., Years Too Early.

Contrast Glory Days.

    Anime & Manga 

-   A variant occurs in _Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS_. Hayate, speaking with Auris Gaiz, suggests that Auris' superior, Lieutenant Genderal Regius Gaiz, is somehow involved with the Jail Scaglietti incident. Auris then asks Hayate how long she has been with the Bureau, and the 19-year-old Hayate says she has been with them for 10 years. Auris then says that Regius has been in the Bureau for 40 years, and when Hayate was committing crimes to save her life during the Book of Darkness Incident,<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>  Regius was upholding the law and defending the people, implying Hayate has no right to question him.
-   _Naruto_:
    -   Kakuzu makes a point of reminding his opponents that he once fought the First Hokage — a man who's _at least_ seventy years dead. Essentially, he fought the most powerful shinobi to ever live before any of the main characters were even born.
    -   Interestingly enough, the Edo Tensei reanimated Second Mizukage remembers Grumpy Old Man Ohnoki, the current Tsuchikage, from when he was a child. Though it only ever comes up three times, Ohnoki fought Madara when he was _a lot_ younger and remembers the encounter with fear. (It's implied that his fight with Madara is why he became a grumpy old shinobi as opposed to the Wide-Eyed Idealist he was in his youth.)
-   _One Piece_: During the Battle of Onigashima, Big Mom boasts to Eustass Kid and Trafalgar Law that she and Kaido have been Emperors of the Sea since before the Worst Generation were "Weaned off your mother's milk."

Leather nappies!" He immediately walks into a low-hanging branch.

    Comic Books 

-   _Batman_ comics and other adaptations often have Alfred invoke this trope. In the _Justice League_ animated series, Alfred tells the Flash that he had been working for the Wayne family "since Master Bruce was in diapers", and on several occasions when Batman brushes off Alfred's assistance or gets frustrated with him, Alfred is quick to remind Master Bruce that he was an MI6 agent before he was born.

    Films — Animated 

-   In _Moana_, Maui's song "You're Welcome" has him bragging "What has two thumbs and pulled up the sky / While you were waddling yea-high? This guy!"

-   In _Blue Thunder_, Braddock says he was in the police force when new recruit Lymangood was "watching cartoons" and "eating a Fudgesicle".
-   Sheriff Teasle does this to illustrate why he's so determined to find and kill Rambo in _First Blood_ after the latter had accidentally caused his asshole deputy's death:
    
    **Teasle:** _Look, goddamn it! That's Art Galt, boy; me and him were friends when your mama was still_ wipin' your **nose!**
    
-   "I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders!" snarls Moe Greene in _The Godfather_.
-   From _The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp_:

-   _Mandy (1952)_: When Ackland and Searle are fighting over how the deaf school should be run, Ackland says, "I was working for this school when you were still a boy!"
-   From _O Brother, Where Art Thou?_:
    
    **Vernon T. Waldrip:** I can't switch sides in the middle of a campaign. Especially to work for a man who lacks moral fiber.  
    **Pappy O'Daniel:** Moral fiber? Why, you little pasty-face sumbitch. I invented moral fiber! Pappy O'Daniel was displaying rectitude and high-mindedness when that egghead you work for was still messing his drawers!
    
-   _Parachute Jumper_: Bill, an ex-Marine pilot, is trying to get a job with the parachute stunt pilots. He is asked if he has any experience. He says "I was flying airplanes when you thought a joystick was a lollipop!".
-   A variant of this occurs in _Point Break (1991)_ with Angelo telling Johnny "I was takin' shrapnel in Khe Sanh when you were crappin' in your hands and rubbin' it on your face!" He does it again later on to a somewhat older man: "I was in this bureau when you were still popping zits on your funny little face and jacking off to the lingerie section of the Sears catalogue."
-   In _The Rock_, during his negotiations with the government, General Hummell calls out the White House Chief of Staff, reminding him that he and his men were in combat when the Chief was 9 years old.

-   _Star Trek_:
    -   Encountering Captain Terell and Commander Chekov on Ceti Alpha V in _Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_, Khan Noonien Singh tells Terell and Chekov that appealing to Khan's people was useless as these people had sworn themselves to him 200 years before Terell and Chekov were born.
    -   In _Star Trek: Generations_, Kirk says this about Picard's grandfather being in diapers. The problem that many fans noticed was the context of the line was why he should enjoy a form of retirement, which directly contradicts scenes both before and after this, within the very movie. The funny thing about this line is that it's _not true._ Kirk, for all his recent knowledge that the man he's speaking to is from the future, is only seventy two years older than Picard. While this is no small age gap, he was probably having adventures while Picard's _father_ was in diapers, not his grandfather.
        -   Kirk entered service approximately 50 years before Picard was born. If we assume he and at least one of his parents were born when their own parents were in their twenties, it works out.
-   This exchange from _Undercover vs. Undercover_. The speaker is the elderly bombmaker known as "The Master", and she's taunting one of the comparatively younger heroes while in the middle of a car chase, though the trope somewhat loses its effect when nobody else can hear it over the sound of speeding vehicles and explosions:
    
    **The Master:** You think you can arrest me, you punk? I've been racing ever since you're sucking on your mother's tits!
    
-   _X-Men Film Series_:
    -   _X2: X-Men United_: Colonel Stryker says this to Senator Kelly (or who he thinks is Kelly).
        
        _"I was piloting Black Ops missions in the jungles of North Vietnam while you were sucking on your mama's tit at Woodstock, Kelly."_ <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
        
    -   _X-Men: The Last Stand_: Beast pulls one of these on Wolverine, but, unbeknownst to both, the former is approximately _110 years younger_ than the latter.
        
        _"My boy, I have been fighting for mutant rights since before you had claws."_

-   Meets Older Than They Think in _The Junk and the Dhow_ by Rudyard Kipling, reminding his compatriots that being kings of the sea currently doesn't mean they gave baby Poseidon his first trident:

    And such contrivances were used

-   _Reserved for the Cat_: Thomas loses patience with Jonathon's snarking.

-   _The Uncomplaining Corpses_: Private detective Michael Shayne's Friend on the Force, Chief Will Gentry, helps him in part because Gentry dislikes his rival and Shayne's enemy, Chief Peter Painter. A scornful Gentry says that "I was running this department when Painter was wearing a safety pin instead of a belt buckle."

    Live-Action TV 

-   _Buck Rogers in the 25th Century_: Blatant lampshading in the episode "Planet of the Slave Girls", when retired 'Commander Gordon', played by Buster Crabbe, the original Buck Rogers, chides Gil Gerard's Buck during a dogfight that "I've been doing this since before you were born, young man." (_Literal_ because the Buck Rogers serials date to 1939, years before Gil Gerard's birth; _ironic_ since Buck comes from the 20th century via suspended animation and his character is centuries older than the 'vintage' fighter pilot Crabbe plays here.)
    
    **Buck:** You think so, huh?  
    **Commander Gordon:** Young man, I _know_ so.

-   A variant in _Daredevil (2015)_ when Karen Page is talking with Ben Urich about Union Allied:
    
    **Karen Page:** I read every big story with your byline. The VA kickbacks, toxic runoff, the Teachers Union scandal. Hell, you pretty much brought down the Italian mob back when I was in diapers! What ever happened to _that_ reporter, Mr. Urich?  
    **Ben Urich:** He got old. And a hell of a lot less stupid.
    
-   _Doctor Who_:
    -   "An Unearthly Child" has this from the First Doctor, combined with Cultural Posturing.
        
        **First Doctor:** For _your_ science, schoolteacher, not for ours! I'll tell you, before your ancestors turned the first wheel, the people of _my_ world had reduced movement through the farthest reaches of space _**to a game for children!**_
        
    -   Again in "Genesis of the Daleks", and again with Cultural Posturing.

    **Zhaan:** My dear, I've kicked more ass than you've sat on.
    
-   _Game of Thrones_:
    -   In "The Ghost of Harrenhal", one of Theon Greyjoy's crewmen, less than impressed by their new captain, goes even further back, saying that "I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon's balls."
    -   In the season five episode "High Sparrow", Lord Janos Slynt refuses to take a post at Greyguard, telling Jon Snow that he was "charged with the defense of King's Landing while you were soiling your swaddling clothes". This defiance earns him a swift death.

-   _The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power_: A variation happens in "Adrift". Galadriel angrily tells Halbrand that she has been hunting her foe even before the existence of the first sunrise and that it would take more than Halbrand's human lifespan to even name all the people she lost in that time.
-   In _Mama's Family_, Mama says to Iola: "I was making booties before you had feet!"
-   In one of Colonel Flagg's _M\*A\*S\*H_ episodes, he showed up insisting that a bombardier who believed himself to be Christ should get "his highly trained thumb" back into action immediately.

    -   Later done in _Mass Effect 3_ with Javik, resident Last of His Kind former Precursor Popsicle, who is fond of mentioning what the dominant species of the current cycle were like in his time: humans lived in caves, hanar were like minnows in the ocean, yahg were small and salarians ate flies and licked their own eyes. He also jokes that asari used to be unable to count beyond ten without their toes but then again this is Javik we're talking about...
    -   Comes up again in _Mass Effect: Andromeda_. If Ryder criticizes Sarissa Theris for putting the asari ark at risk by stealing kett navigational data, Sarissa will snidely shoot back that she was studying tactics when Ryder's ancestors were toddlers. Ryder is not impressed.

-   In the "Kill Killbane" ending of _Saints Row: The Third_, Final Boss Cyrus Temple boasts to the Boss, "I've been a soldier longer than you've been alive!" This boast loses a lot of its effect if you've made your Boss just as old as or even older than him.
-   In _Suzerain_, if the player decides to partially or even entirely nationalize Bergia Steel, the company run by the powerful oligarch Walter Tusk, an angry Tusk will threaten President Anton Rayne as he signs away the rights to the company's daily operations. If the player have Anton say that he is not intimidated by Tusk's threats and that it is Tusk who is the one should be worried if he tries anything, he will spit this line at Anton:
    
    **Tusk:** Do you know who I am? I've been chewing up and spitting out Sordish politicians since you were in diapers.
    
-   _Warriors Orochi_ gives us Huang Zhong, who, in spite of the quote below, is not actually senile.

-   In _World of Warcraft_, Xaril the Poisoned Mind, one of the mantid Paragons (heroes sealed in amber and released in times of crisis — although for Xaril, it was in the relatively recent past, as opposed to centuries or millennia ago), says he remembers when Amber Shaper Un'sok, one of the sha-corrupted Empress' minions and the penultimate boss in Heart of Fear, was afraid to mix his first toxin.

    Webcomics 

-   _DM of the Rings_, after Frodo cringes at Gimli's IC introduction (not so far back as the others being in diapers, but it counts):

-   _The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!_:

    Web Original 

-   When Richard of RatedRR made a video of failing to blend an iPhone 6 and Tom Dickson successfully did so on _Will It Blend?_, many of RatedRR's fans accused Tom of faking the results. Tom responded by calling out Richard and even pointing out that he's been blending stuff since 1980, which is years before Richard was ever born. Then Tom challenged him to meet up and do a special together to show Richard that the iPhone 6 actually does blend. Richard stopped too early; the _Will It Blend?_ episode shows the iPhone 6 taking a much longer time to blend than previous models.

    Western Animation 

-   _6teen_: Ron the Rent-a-Cop decides to get a job at the Khaki Barn, and starts folding some shirts. When Kristen and Kirsten tell him he's doing it wrong, he responds with a harsh, _very_ loud "I WAS FOLDING SHIRTS IN THE JUNGLE WHEN YOU TWO WERE IN DIAPERS!".

    **New Bully:** Oh, just this morning then?
    
-   As a possible Shout-Out to a similar quote from the source material, the Animated Adaptation of _Donkey Kong Country_ has this quote from the episode, "Best of Enemies", when Donkey Kong tries to stop Cranky from participating in a wing-walking competition against King K. Rool:

-   _Dragons: Riders of Berk_ feature this exchange when Hiccup is trying to find a job for Gobber:

    **Gobber:** Exactly. That's why you should let Gobber do what Gobber does best. I've been making saddles since you were in diapers. In fact, I made your diapers.
    
-   _Futurama_:
    -   Fry's status as a Human Popsicle means he's able to accurately tell Leela, "I was delivering things before you were born!" He may be right, but that doesn't make him competent.

    Real Life 

-   Sir Benjamin Disraeli, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in the reign of Queen Victoria, was occasionally attacked for his Jewish heritage. One such attack came in 1835, when the Irish Roman Catholic politician Daniel O'Connell vilified Disraeli in the House of Commons. Disraeli replied, "Yes, I am a Jew, and while the ancestors of the right honorable gentleman were brutal savages in an unknown island, mine were priests in the Temple of Solomon." This piece of invective makes this trope Older Than Radio—and probably older.
-   George C. Wallace once replied to a group of hippies who called him a fascist, "_I was killing fascists when you punks were in diapers._"
-   This trope was pointed out when tennis player Kimiko Date-Krumm returned from retirement at the age of 37. She started playing in 1989, before a good portion of her opponents were born and when another portion of them were small children (for reference, Serena Williams was born in 1981 and went pro in 1995, a year before Date-Krumm first retired).
    -   In 2019, this trope was flipped for Serena Williams when Bianca Andreescu challenged Williams for both the Canadian Open and the U.S. Open. Bianca, being herself born in 2000, pointed this out to Serena herself (when the latter had to withdraw from the finals of the Canadian Open due to injury) by noting that she grew up watching Serena compete and that Serena was an inspiration for Bianca. Bianca would end up defeating Serena in the 2019 U.S. Open.
-   Also pointed out at the start of the 2019–20 NBA season, when Vince Carter took sole possession of the record for most seasons in the league at 22. Four of Carter's opening-night teammates with the Atlanta Hawks had yet to be born when he was chosen in the 1998 NBA draft, and two others were less than a year old at that time. His youngest teammate wasn't born until about 7 months after Carter played his first NBA game.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   Flat-out invoked during the 2022 NFL Draft, when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers made Logan Hall, a defensive end out of Houston, the first pick of the second round. Hall was born on April 22, 2000—six days after the the Bucs' starting quarterback Tom Brady _was drafted_ by the New England Patriots. The linked story even stated, "Brady already had a Super Bowl win when Hall was still in diapers."
-   This trope is commonplace in golf, a sport in which top players regularly remain competitive against younger players well into their forties, and sometimes their early fifties. To give just one example on the US-based PGA Tour, the 2020 Farmers Insurance Open saw all-time great Tiger Woods paired for the first two days with Collin Morikawa, marking the first time that Woods had played in a tour event alongside someone who was born after he turned pro.<sup>note&nbsp;</sup> 
-   After Wesley So insinuated that Tigran L. Petrosian had been cheating at chess, the latter responded with an angry rant containing the sentence "You was doing PIPI in your pampers when i was beating players much more stronger then you!\[sic\]"<sup>note&nbsp;</sup>
