"Watch in wonder as I pass this hoop completely around her!"

_"Not much experience, but she knows the basics. She knows how to present herself, and a pretty assistant’s the most effective form of misdirection."_

In showbiz, you have the male performer and his lovely assistant.

A Lovely Assistant is just that, an attractive young woman who assists the performer or primary host. This can be by fetching things, being the object of whatever the performer is to do, giving out prizes, handling the lottery equipment, distracting the audience's attention away from a magician's skullduggery, or doing minor performances herself. They are almost Always Female (even if the magician is female herself).

But primarily, her job is to look good, strike attractive poses, and give the performer room to do his thing. The clothing can vary from modest but sexy to outright Stripperiffic.

A variation appears in a Stage Magician's show, where there are practical reasons for small, female assistants in tight-fitting clothes. Some physical-displacement type tricks (moving boxes, sawing a person in half) require the person to be quite small in order to fit into the device (most magic equipment is designed for an assistant who's 5′2″ tall). The same is true of quick-change acts, where the model must be small enough to wear many layers of trick clothing without appearing bulky. In these cases the "assistant" is an integral part of the act who requires skill and training, but plays off the audience expectations that she is nothing but eye candy in order to set up the trick and make the magician look impressive. A lot of them are also twins, for various purposes.

Some common roles of the Lovely Assistant are as co-host of a game show, a Stage Magician's assistant or object for tricks, or the target of a Knife-Throwing Act.

A Sub-Trope of Distracted by the Sexy.

A Sister Trope to Chorus Girls.

Compare Bridge Bunnies, Foil. Not to be confused with Science Hero's Babe Assistant.

And then took he forth a saw and cleft her in twain, and there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth. But Jesus said, "O ye of little faith," and he threw open the box and lo, Mary was whole. And the crowd went absolutely bananas. And Jesus and Mary took a big bow, and he said unto her, "From now on you shall be known as Sharon, for that is a good name for an assistant."_
    

    Fan Works 

-   In the Discworld as envisioned by A.A. Pessimal, the Guild of Fools and Clowns is forced to accept that it must go co-educational and accept women as members. The key for this seismic shift was when the Guild took over the Guild of Conjurors. As Vetinari pointed out, every stage magician comes with his Doris, the lovely assistant in spangled tights and leotard. Therefore the Dorises should also be Guild members too. And while you're about it... The Fools' Guild now trains Dorises, tightrope artistes, knife-throwers' assistants, lion-tamers, and all categories of women whose working lives involve leotards and spangly tights. After a civil war provoked by the issue of women Fools, it is reluctantly accepted that the girl students should be able to study Troubador, Jester and even Clowning skills, but only as a minor course and strictly in a non-performing sort of way.
-   Gender Flipped in _Disney High School,_ with Esmeralda as the magician and Hercules as the assistant.

    Films — Live-Action 

-   The song "Eglantine" in _Bedknobs and Broomsticks_ is Mr. Browne asking Miss Price to be _his_ lovely assistant for magic shows... and the one actually doing the magic. Not only does she realize he's trying to exploit her, she's a bit annoyed with his casual use of her first name.
-   Subverted — or at least complicated — in the early scenes of _Gun Crazy_. Laurie uses a female assistant in her sharpshooting act; the assistant wears a more feminine costume than Laurie, but is older than her and less conventionally attractive.
-   _Leprechaun 3_: Tammy works as one for Fazio in order to learn the ropes so that she can become a magician herself one day. Though much like everyone else, she holds him in very little regard.

-   In _The Unknown_, Nanon (Joan Crawford) is Alonzo's (Lon Chaney) lovely assistant in his Knife-Throwing Act. As part of the act, he uses his knives to strip away the veils that make up her costume.

    Game Shows (Fictional and Nonfictional) 

-   Subverted by _Avanti Un Altro_ for Rule of Funny; a random person is selected from the audience each episode to be the assistant (more precisely, a "valet").
-   Roxanne on the original CBS version of _Beat the Clock_.
-   The original _Concentration_ had Paola Diva as its prize model, and _Classic Concentration_ had Diana Taylor and Marjorie Goodson-Cutt.
-   Some shows had male Vannas, such as Joe Alaskey on _Couch Potatoes_ and Dan the Centurian on _Caesar's Challenge_.
-   Carol Vorderman from _Countdown_ was picked for her ability to solve the Numbers Game in her head practically every time as much as for her ability to stand around pinning letters to boards.
    -   In the British comedy Panel Show _Would I Lie to You?_, Carol stated that she played games for most of the 30 seconds of the Numbers Round because she'd already solved it.
    -   Since Carol left the show, her (younger, taller, blonder and cheaper) replacement Rachel Riley has taken the role.
    -   Though many years before, back in the '80s, solving the numbers game and checking the contestants' answers was Carol's only job. There were other assistants there to put up the letters and numbers tiles <sup>note&nbsp;</sup> \- initially each of the games was done by two separate ladies but it soon became apparent this was too many...
-   Parodied by David Letterman's Show Within a Show "Will It Float?", with the hula-hoop girl and that chick wearing a steel bustier and a working metal grinder.
-   The American version of _Deal or No Deal_ featured _twenty-six_ models (down to two in syndication).
-   The American version of _Duel_ had "chip girls" whose only job was to walk to the players' podium after each question to collect chips spent on incorrect answers.
-   Since the 2001-02 season, _Jeopardy!_ has had the Clue Crew, a team of assistants (two female, one male) who present pre-recorded visuals on some clues.
-   Predating Vanna White in the United States was Carol Merrill, the sole model on the original _Let's Make a Deal_. The new version of _Deal_ with Wayne Brady originally had Alison Fiori as the assistant, then Tiffany Coyne.
-   _Lingo_ tried to subvert this by having main host Chuck Woolery act The Fool and set up beautiful co-host Shandi Finnessey as the smart one. It... didn't really work.
-   In a _Married... with Children_ episode, where Al and Peggy compete in a game show:
    
    **Host:** Hello there, and welcome to _How Do I Love Thee?_! The game show that dares to ask; "How do I love thee?" For those of you who're totally ignorant of today's superstars, I'm Bink Winkleman. _\[one person applauds\]_ Thank you! And here's our own little piece of fluff that the network thrust upon me, The Lovely Zelda. _\[great applause\]_
    
-   A rare male example: Richard Osman on _Pointless._
-   Barker's Beauties in _The Price Is Right_ (after Drew Carey took Bob Barker's place, they started simply being referred to by name).
    -   In late 2012 the show broke its Always Female mold by hiring their first male model — although they had been having male celebrities as "guest" models for some time prior (including a contestant who joked about being one on his shirt), as well as occasions where the male announcer would model certain prizes.
-   MTV's _Remote Control_ had a new one for just about every season.
-   First Jenny McCarthy and then Carmen Electra on MTV's dating game show _Singled Out_.
-   Bruce Forsyth has had many of these over the years; including in _Strictly Come Dancing_ with Tess Daly. Since he semi-retired from that show, Tess has become the main host, with Claudia Winkleman taking on her role, although the emphasis is is less on the 'lovely' and more on the 'slightly mad' part of the role.
-   _Temptation: The New Sale of the Century_, used male models in an attempt to attract a middle-aged female demographic to the show. It didn't help that 99% of its contestants were female.
-   Vanna White of _Wheel of Fortune_, and the former Trope Namer. She wasn't the first letter-turner on the show (Susan Stafford was), but her iconic nature in the wake of _Wheel_'s 1980s success has made her a quintessential example of this trope.
-   Similarly, the late Adriana Xenides, "co-host" of the Australian _Wheel_ from the first episode in July 1981 until November 1996, when due to severe illness, she had to leave; and from July 1997 until June 1999 after recovering. When she left, Adri was the longest-serving female co-host of a game show; now Vanna holds that record.
-   _WinTuition_ subverted this with a short, bald male assistant named "Gorgeous George", who acted as if he would rather be anywhere else whenever he hauled in props for a question.

-   _Esther Diamond:_ The first book's mystery is how six magicians' assistants disappear from vanishing cabinets for real. Four of the six are glamorous young women who are assisting struggling magicians (or in one case, an actor playing a magician) who take their work seriously. One is an older woman who vanishes from a party her boyfriend is hosting and providing the entertainment for. The sixth is a man who performs in a drag show wearing nothing but a thong.
-   Subverted in _Lovely Assistant_ by Geoph Essex: Jenny is both a magician's lovely assistant _and_ the main protagonist. Even in the magic act, Jenny is more than just a pretty thing to look at. (She's also one of Calvin's most effective props, and does some tricks herself.) As the plot develops, this trope zig-zags: as a Grim Reaper, Jenny "assists" death by sending the recently departed off to their next journey; but she's still not just eye candy, as the Angels of Death don't seem to have any defined employer and are a pretty mixed lot.
-   Nynaeve gets this job at Valan Luca's circus in _The Wheel of Time_.
-   In _Stranger in a Strange Land_ Valentine Michael Smith does a carnival magic show with Jill as his lovely assistant. Despite his real powers, the show flops.\]

    Live-Action TV 

-   The episode of _ALF_ wherein ALF decides to become a stage magician and accidentally breaks a flowerpot with his magic wand as part of his first trick:

    **Willie:** _\[sighs\]_ I guess _I'm_ the lovely assistant. _\[gets a whisk broom\]_
    
-   _Banacek_: In "Now You See Me, Now You Don't", the vanishing Stage Magician was using his daughter as his lovely assistant. She is seemingly as much in the dark about what happens to her father as everyone else.
-   _Beakman's World_ had three lovely assistants (Josie, Liza and Phoebe, depending on season), and one not-so-lovely assistant (Lester). He even used Phoebe as the Lovely Assistant for the magic trick displayed in the page image.
-   _The Brady Bunch_: Peter has magic as a Fleeting Passionate Hobby and does the Disappearing Girl trick with Jan as his lovely assistant, which freaks Cindy out. Even when they try to explain the trick to her she is still terrified. Then on the day of the Talent Show Jan twists her ankle and can't perform with Peter, so Cindy steps up and takes her place. Once she's been in the cabinet and sees how it's done she gets very enthusiastic, even wanting to do the trick again.
-   On _Brainiac: Science Abuse_ we get Professor Myang Li, who determines "Does this fruit float?" You do doubt her academic credentials given her Stripperiffic outfit.
-   Quite common in Brazilian TV. The Trope Codifier was Chacrinha and his "chacretes"<small>◊</small> (pun on vedette), to the point the suffix -ete is quite common: Hzetes, Panicats... the lightest version were kids TV host Xuxa and her Paquitas,<small>◊</small> which even had male versions.<small>◊</small>

Both "Float" and "anything" have the Grinder Girl (a woman who holds a metal grinder to a piece of metal on her costume's thorax) and the Hula Hoop Girl (a woman who hulas a lot of hoops) doing their thing to either side during the segment. Both GG and HHG were originally "discovered" on previous installments of "Is this anything?"
-   On _Leverage_ Parker is this in the episode "The Top Hat Job" as the team is infiltrating a company by posing as the entertainment, a stage magic show. Interestingly her main role in the team is also similar to this in that she is often underestimated and often serves to make her boss look good. Throughout the episode, Sophie (who loves to be on stage) sulks that _she_ has actual experience as this trope and it's not fair that she doesn't get to play the part just because her skills as The Face are needed elsewhere on the job.
-   Tony Blake used a variety of lovely assistants over the course of _The Magician_; seemingly hiring a new one in each city he performed in. When the format of the show changed to give him a permanent base of operation, he gained a permanent lovely assistant named Kathy. He sometimes also used a male assistant named Larry.

-   _Taskmaster_ has Alex Horne, who is co-host and Greg's personal assistant.
-   During Johnny Carson's run as host of _The Tonight Show_, one of his regular skits was playing Art Fern, a sleazy huckstering daytime-movie host.

-   The hosts of _The Sunny Side Up Show_ are this to Chica.
-   _WandaVision_: The second episode features a town talent show, where Wanda wears a sequined corset and fishnet stockings and fetches props for magician Vision. During the actual show however, Wanda ends up having to pull most of the weight, because Vision's works are literally gummed up. He keeps using his superpowers and she has to find ways to make them appear as mere magic tricks (like conjuring a rope and pulley to make his flying look fake, and hiding his superstrength by turning a piano into a cardboard cutout).
-   _Whodunnit? (UK)_:
    -   The Victim of the Week in "Before Your Very Eyes" is a Stage Magician's lovely assistant who is murdered when the killer sabotages the sword cabinet, causing her to be fatally stabbed on stage.

    Professional Wrestling 

-   The National Wrestling Alliance features "Magic" Jake Dumas, a heel wrestling magician. Naturally, his valet/manager is his Lovely Assistant, CJ.

    Puppet Shows 

-   _Fraggle Rock_: Convincing John, who can convince anyone to do anything, has a trio of female backup singers, the Fragglettes, who accompany him almost everywhere.

-   In the _Dark Tales_ game series, the Freemium side game _Nightfall_ provides Dupin with one of these in the form of Anna Fleurs.
